{"title": "Washington: STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS", "body": "\nWashington: The Library of Congress, The Government of USA has issued the following house proceeding:\n\n By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Tester, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Manchin, Mr. Daines, Ms. Harris, and Mr. Boozman): S. \n1754. A bill to reauthorize section 340H of the Public Health Service Act to continue to encourage the expansion, \nmaintenance, and establishment of approved graduate medical residency programs at qualified teaching health \ncenters, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Ms. COLLINS. \nMadam President, I rise today to introduce legislation with my colleague from Montana, Senator Tester, that would \nextend an important program to fund Teaching Health Centers, which support the health and well-being of families \nin rural and medically underserved communities. I am pleased that Senators Cochran, Manchin, Daines, Harris, and \nBoozman, have joined us as cosponsors. In the background of the health care debate, there is another crisis that \nlooms. \n\nWe are facing a severe shortage of doctors. By 2025, we will need more than 100,000 new primary care doctors to \nmeet the growing demand for health care services across the Country. The shortage is especially critical in rural \nand underserved communities, which are often those that have been hit hardest by the opioid epidemic. The most \nsignificant shortages are in family medicine, general internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, \npsychiatry, and dentistry. These shortages have reached crisis levels in many places. In clinics and health centers \nin Aroostook County, Maine's northernmost county where I grew up, I hear stories about vacancies forcing Mainers \nto travel many miles simply to see a primary care doctor or dentist. For the past six years, one program, the \nTeaching Health Centers Graduate Medical Education Program, has worked to fill these gaps. This program helps \nto train medical residents in community-based settings, including low-income, underserved rural and urban \nneighborhoods. For example, since 2011, the Penobscot Community Health Care Center has trained 31 residents \nand served more than 15,000 dental patients in Bangor, Maine. We need to meet people in the communities in \nwhich they live and work. This program is training the next generation of physicians, and has produced real results. \nWhen compared with traditional Medicare graduate medical education residents, those who train at teaching health \ncenters are significantly more likely to practice primary care and remain in underserved or rural communities. The \nnumbers speak for themselves: 82 percent of Teaching Health Center, or THC, residents choose to practice \nprimary care, compared to 23 percent of traditional Medicare Graduate Medical Education residents; and 55 \npercent of THC residents choose to remain in underserved communities, compared to 26 percent of traditional \nMedicare GME residents. Teaching health centers are serving Americans from coast to coast. A total of 742 THC \n\n\nresidents are serving in 27 states and the District of Columbia. The program is competitive, and trains the best of \nthe best. For each residency position, THC programs receive more than 100 applications. In 2017, THC residents \nand faculty will provide more than one million primary care medical visits to underserved communities. Teaching \nHealth Centers have demonstrated a record of success, and it is imperative that we support them. Our legislation \nwould reauthorize the Teaching Health Centers Graduate Medical Education Program for three years. It would also \nallow new programs to expand within existing centers and the creation of entirely new teaching health centers. This \nbill is widely supported by leading community health and physician organizations, including the American \nAssociation of Teaching Health Centers, National Association of Community Health Centers, American Academy of \nFamily Physicians, American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, American Osteopathic Association, \nAmerican Council of OB/GYNs, Society of Teachers of Family Medicine, and Council of Academic Family Medicine. \nWe have also received letters of support from teaching health centers in Maine, Montana, Tennessee, Iowa, \nOklahoma, North Carolina, California, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Washington, Texas, Connecticut, New York, \nIllinois, Massachusetts, and Idaho. In the face of nationwide physician shortages, our legislation would provide a \nsolution for communities today and a path forward to train the physicians of tomorrow. I urge all of my colleagues to \njoin in support of this important legislation, the Training the Next Generation of Primary Care Doctors Act of 2017. \nMs. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters be printed in the Record. There being no \nobjection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Penobscot Community Health Care, \nAugust 2, 2017. Hon. Susan Collins, U.S Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of Penobscot \nCommunity Health Care's General Practice Dental Residency program, a Teaching Health Center training 3-6 \nresidents a year (with over 28 residents trained since 2011) and serving 15,000 dental patients in Bangor, Maine, I \nwant to express our appreciation for your relentless efforts to develop legislation to continue funding and expand \nthe Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) program. We know that you and your staff \nhave worked long and hard with multiple stakeholder organizations, including the American Association of Teaching \nHealth Centers, to create the best possible legislation that will fund [[Page S4832]] adequately this vital program for \nat least another three years and provide for expansion to additional medically underserved areas of our country. \nTHCs currently train more than 742 residents nationally and are providing more than a million patient visits in \nunderserved rural and urban communities. The continuation of this program is vital in all of the communities they \nare located, and preserving this program is critical to the health of hundreds of thousands around the country. This \ninvestment of federal funding in the THCGME program, coupled with private, nonfederal resources, guarantees that \nevery dollar is used exclusively for primary care training, all in community-based settings. Residents trained in \ncommunity- based settings are three times more likely than traditionally trained residents to practice primary care in \na community based setting ensuring that doctors trained in these settings remain in communities where they are \nneeded most. Penobscot Community Health Care appreciates your leadership on this important issue and is \npleased to support your legislation, which is helping to address the doctor and dentist shortage that plagues so \nmany communities, both urban and rural. You have always championed Community Health Centers, and \nconcurrently Teaching Health Centers, recognizing the need for accessible, affordable health care for all no matter \nif you live in Caribou, Maine or New York City. Thank you for your tireless efforts and leadership in the United \nStates Senate as you strive to preserve and improve health care for all Americans. Sincerely, Kenneth Schmidt, \nMPA, President and CEO. ____ Resurrection Family Medicine, Memphis, TN, August 1, 2017. Hon. Susan Collins, \nU.S Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of Resurrection Health Family Medicine Residency, \na Teaching Health Center training 25 residents and providing 15,000 patient visits per year in Memphis, TN, I write \nto express our appreciation for your relentless efforts to develop legislation to continue funding and expand the \nTeaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) program. We know that you and your staff have \nworked long and hard with multiple stakeholder organizations, including the American Association of Teaching \nHealth Centers, to create the best possible legislation that will fund adequately this vital program for at least another \nthree years and provide for expansion to additional medically underserved areas of our country. THCs currently \ntrain more than 742 residents nationally and are providing more than a million patient visits in underserved rural \nand urban communities. The continuation of this program is vital in all of the communities they are located and \npreserving this program is critical to the health of hundreds of thousands around the country. This investment of \nfederal funding in the THCGME program, coupled with private, nonfederal resources, guarantees that every dollar \nis used exclusively for primary care training, all in community-based settings. Residents trained in community- \nbased settings are three times more likely than traditionally trained residents to practice primary care in a \ncommunity based setting ensuring that doctors trained in these settings remain in communities, where they are \n\n\n\nneeded most. Resurrection Health Family Medicine Residency appreciates your leadership on this important issue \nand is pleased to support your legislation, which is helping to address the doctor shortage that plagues so many \ncommunities, both urban and rural. Sincerely, Jeremy Crider, MD, Residency Director. ____ The American \nCongress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Washington, DC, August 3, 2017. Hon. Susan Collins, U.S Senate, \nWashington, DC. Hon. Jon Tester, U.S Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Senators Collins and Tester: The American \nCongress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), with more than 58,000 physicians and partners dedicated to \nadvancing women's health, is pleased to endorse the Training the Next Generation of Primary Care Doctors Act of \n2017. Your bill would help improve access for women in rural and underserved areas to timely, high quality health \ncare by training primary care physicians, including obstetrician-gynecologists. Today, women living in half of all US \ncounties are in areas without an ob-gyn, including one of Maine's 16 counties, and 35 of Montana's 56 counties. \nFurthermore, the ob-gyn workforce is aging and a large number of ob-gyns are retiring at a time when the female \npopulation is expected to increase 36% by 2050. ACOG projects an ob-gyn shortage of 18% by 2030. Your bill will \nhelp alleviate these workforce challenges by ensuring the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education \n(THCGME) program can continue to train ob-gyns and other primary care physicians in an efficient and effective \nmanner. Community-based THCGME medical training programs are critical to filling workforce shortages, as \nphysicians trained through this program are more likely to practice in underserved communities. According to the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), primary care residents trained in community-based settings \nare three times more likely to practice in an underserved community-based setting. An investment in THCGME to \nimprove access to care in rural and underserved communities has a long-term impact positive impact. Thank you \nfor introducing this legislation to improve access to high quality care for women. Should you have any questions or \nif we can be of assistance in any way, please contact Mallory Schwarz, ACOG Federal Affairs Manager. Sincerely, \nHaywood L. Brown, MD, FACOG, President. ____ American Osteopathic Association, Washington, DC, August 3, \n2017. Hon. Susan Collins, U.S Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. Jon Tester, U.S Senate, Washington, DC. Dear \nSenators Collins and Tester: On behalf of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) and the nearly 130,000 \nosteopathic physicians and osteopathic medical students we represent, thank you for introducing the ``Training the \nNext Generation of Primary Care Doctors Act of 2017.'' This important bipartisan legislation renews the commitment \nto the continued development of the Teaching Health Centers Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) program to \nhelp ensure a robust primary care workforce in our nation's rural and underserved communities. We are grateful for \nyour leadership on this critical issue. The THCGME program is a vital source of training for primary care residents \nto help expand access to care in rural and underserved communities throughout the country. These programs, \nlocated in 59 teaching health centers in 27 states, currently train 742 residents in much-needed primary care fields \nincluding family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry, geriatrics, and \ndentistry. The majority of these programs are accredited by the AOA or are dually accredited (DO/MD) programs, \nsupporting nearly 800 osteopathic resident physicians through their training since the program began. And true to \nthe intent of the THCGME program, residents who train in these programs are far more likely to practice primary \ncare and remain in the communities in which they have trained. As osteopathic physicians, we are trained in a \npatient- centered, hands-on approach to care that focuses on the whole person, including the physical, mental, and \npsychosocial aspects of health. Our training and philosophy includes a strong emphasis on primary care--in fact, \napproximately half of all osteopathic physicians practice in primary care specialties. Given this strong presence in \nprimary care, osteopathic medicine aligns naturally with the mission and goals of the THCGME program that has \nproven successful in helping address the existing gaps in our nation's primary care workforce. Your legislation \nprovides much-needed stability through continued funding for the THCGME program, and also creates a pathway \nfor the expansion of existing centers as well as the creation of entirely new teaching health centers. We deeply \nappreciate your commitment to training the future of the primary care workforce and thank you for introducing this \nimportant legislation. The AOA and our members stand ready to assist you in securing its enactment into law. \nSincerely, Mark A. Baker, DO, President. ____ Council of Academic Family Medicine, Washington, DC, August 3, \n2017. Hon. Susan Collins, U.S Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. Jon Tester, U.S Senate, Washington, DC. Dear \nSenators Collins and Tester: On behalf of the Council of Academic Family Medicine (CAFM), including the Society \nof Teachers of Family Medicine, Association of Departments of Family Medicine, Association of Family Medicine \nResidency Directors, the North American Primary Care Research Group, we thank you for introducing the Training \nthe Next Generation of Primary Care Doctors Act of 2017. This legislation is an important step to providing \nsustainable funding and growth for a critical program that helps address the primary care physician shortage in our \ncountry. We appreciate your leadership on this issue and give you our whole-hearted support for the legislation. To \n\n\n\nhelp sustain this important program the proposed legislation provides suitable funding for current Teaching Health \nCenter Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) programs to help address the crisis-level shortage of primary care \nphysicians. The funding level included in the bill will allow for a per resident amount to be paid for training that is on \npar with the Heath Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) funded study identifying a median cost of \napproximately $157 thousand per trainee. Evidence shows [[Page S4833]] that the THC program graduates are \nmore likely to practice in rural and medically underserved communities. We are pleased that the proposed \nlegislation supports ten new THC programs, with a priority for those serving rural and medically underserved \npopulations and areas, recognizing the importance of growing this successful program. The Council on Graduate \nMedical Education (COGME), an advisory body empaneled by Congress, has urged Congress to continue of the \nTHCGME program stating that ``THCGME programs deliver excellent value in physician training,'' and that the \nprogram encourages training in ``delivery systems that emphasize team-based care in Patient Centered Medical \nHomes that maximize quality at a moderate cost''; Additionally, the Institute of Medicine (IOM), [now National \nAcademy of Medicine] in a 2014 report identified the THCGME program as helping meet the need for primary care \nphysicians, especially those who provide care to underserved populations and worthy of a permanent funding \nsource. The current authorization for this vital program expires at the end of this fiscal year. Without legislative \naction, the expiration of this program would mean an exacerbation of the primary care physician shortage, and a \nlessening of support for training in underserved and rural areas. We are grateful to you both for your exceptional \nleadership in supporting and sustaining this vital program by introducing this bill and helping to shepherd it toward \nenactment. The CAFM organizations and our members are pleased to work with you to secure this legislation's \nenactment. Sincerely, Stephen A Wilson, MD, President, Society of Teachers of Family Medicine. Valerie Gilchrist, \nMD, President, Association of Departments of Family Medicine. Karen B Mitchell, MD, President, Association of \nFamily Medicine Residency Directors. William Hogg, MD, President, North American Primary Care Research \nGroup. ____ RiverStone Health, Billings, MT, August 2, 2017. Hon. Susan Collins, U.S Senate, Washington, DC. \nDear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Montana Family Medicine Residency and RiverStone Health Clinic, one of \nthe nation's original eleven teaching health centers training 24 family medicine residents and serving over 15,000 \nresidents or Yellowstone and Carbon County, NIT, I want to express our appreciation for your relentless efforts to \ndevelop legislation to continue funding and expand the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education \n(THCGME) program. We know that you and your staff have worked long and hard with multiple stakeholder \norganizations, including the American Association of Teaching Health Centers and the National Association of \nCommunity Health Centers, to create the best possible legislation that will fund adequately this vital program for at \nleast another three years and provide for expansion to additional medically underserved areas of our country. THCs \ncurrently train more than 742 residents nationally and are providing more than a million patient visits in \nunderserved rural and urban communities. The continuation of this program is vital in all of the communities they \nare located and preserving this program is critical to the health of hundreds of thousands around the country, \nparticularly those who lack access to healthcare absent their local community health center and its providers. This \ninvestment of federal funding in the THCGME program, coupled with private, nonfederal resources, guarantees that \nevery dollar is used exclusively for primary care training, all in community-based settings. Residents trained in \ncommunity-based settings are three times more likely than traditionally trained residents to practice primary care in \na community based setting ensuring that doctors trained in these settings remain in communities where they are \nneeded most. Some 70% of our residency's over 100 graduates practice in MT, a state with widespread provider \nshortage areas and multiple counties with no medical care provider at all. RiverStone Health and Montana Family \nMedicine Residency appreciate your leadership on this important issue and are pleased to support your legislation, \nwhich is helping to address the doctor shortage that plagues so many communities, both urban and rural. Sincerely, \nJohn Felton, MPH, MBA, FACHE, President & CEO / Health Officer. ______ By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. \nBarrasso, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Tillis, Mr. Heller, Mr. Scott, and Mr. Inhofe): S. 1757.
