It said the increase in June alone was $42 billion \u201d nearly equal to growth for the full final quarter \nof last year.\nChinas reserves have ballooned as the central bank buys up dollars generated by its huge trade surplus and influx \nof investment.

China is Washingtons biggest foreign creditor and is believed to keep \nalmost half of its reserves in U.S. Treasury bonds and notes issued by government-affiliated agencies.\nDespite such concern, the U.S. government says Beijing is continuing to buy substantial amounts of Treasuries.\nChinas exports fell for an eighth month in June, plunging 21.4 percent from a year earlier, and its global trade \nsurplus narrowed to just $8.2 billion, the second-smallest gap in many years.\nChina added just $7.7 billion to its reserves in the first quarter of this year as trade and investment plunged due to \nthe global financial crisis. That compared with a $45 billion increase in the final quarter of last year.\nThe growth in reserves over the first half was down by $95 billion from the expansion in the same period last year, \nthe central bank said.\nMeanwhile, foreign direct investment fell in June for the ninth straight month, but the decline narrowed, adding to \nsigns of an economic recovery..\nActual foreign direct investment in June totaled $9 billion, down 6.8 percent from a year earlier, while the number of \nnew approved foreign companies totaled 2,529, down 3.8 percent, an official said.\n\nThe FDI drop compared to a 17.8 percent fall in May, likely another sign of improvement in Chinas\n           \u201d Hat tip: heroyalwhyness [|Return to headlines]\n\n           France Approves Sunday Work\nPARIS \u201d French legislators have approved a divisive bill that allows more stores to stay open \u201d and more people to \nwork \u201d on Sundays.\nThe law was adopted Wednesday by a vote of 282 to 238 in Frances lower house of parliament.\nOne of President Nicolas Sarkozys key reform pledges, the bills proponents say expanding Sunday opening hours \nwill give the French economy a much-needed jolt as the nation wrestles with recession.\nBut Frances leftist opposition calls it an affront to labor protections, and traditionalists decry it as an attack on the \ntime-honored day of rest.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: heroyalwhyness [|Return to headlines]\n\n           French Auto Workers Threaten to Blow Up Factory in Extreme Example of Resistance to Cost Cuts\nOutside view of the New Fabris car parts manufacturer in Chatellerault, central France, Wednesday July 15, 2009.A \nlocal official dismissed a threat by laid-off French workers to blow up their auto parts factory, saying the gas \ncanisters, center left, they placed outside the plant are apparently empty. The factorys more than 350 workers were \nfired last month. They are demanding Euros 30,000 ($41,000) each by the end of the month in compensation from \nthe main clients, PSA and Renault, union officials say.

They are taking turns guarding 20 canisters of acetylene and butane, once used for gas-operated tractors \nand now spaced out on both sides of the plant and attached by a cable. Guy Eyermann of the CGT union said half \nof them are full, though that was impossible to verify.\n\u0153We are at the end of the line, Eyermann said. \u0153A lot of people worked here for 25, 35 years. Many have given \ntheir lives to the company. He called on \u0153all factories in Europe that are closing to protest and do what the workers \nare doing here.\nNew Fabris closed down June 16 and all its 366 workers are being gradually laid off. They blamed Peugeot-Citroen \nand Renault for canceling contracts that represented the bulk of the companys sales, and began their protest June \n20.\nOn the gates out front, laid-off workers put up black cardboard cutouts in the shape of coffins noting workers name, \nyear of birth, and \u01532009 \u201d the year they were let go. A workers empty blue uniform hung from the gate. Enormous \nmachines hauled from inside the factory stood in the courtyard, gutted and charred after employees torched them.\nThe shuttered factory still holds parts and costly machinery, and the workers are trying to keep Renault and \nPeugeot-Citroen from collecting any material.\nThe workers are meeting with officials at Renault headquarters on Thursday, and are asking for euro15,000 each \nfrom the company. The workers met with officials at Peugeot-Citroen last week, also asking for euro15,000 apiece.\nPSA Peugeot Citroen spokesman Pierre-Olivier Salmon said the company rejected the demand.\n\u0153Its the world upside down, Salmon said. \u0153Its not our job to replace the companys shareholders or the state. Why \nshould PSA pay for this?\nSalmon said PSA had offered to buy New Fabris remaining inventory for euro1.2 million, even though PSA had no \nneed for the spare parts.\nRenault spokeswoman Gita Roux said the possibility of buying the factorys remaining inventory is a possible topic \nof negotiations at Thursdays meeting. As for the workers demand for compensation, Roux said, \u0153It is not for us as \nclients to pay redundancy packages for a supplier.\nThe workers on Thursdays \u0153morning shift guarding the gas canisters whiled away hours playing ping pong, \npetanque or simply chatting. No police were in sight, though local officials say police are monitoring the situation.\n\u0153I got a severance package of euro3,500, about two months of salary. With the economic downturn if I dont find \nanother job this isnt going to get me very far, said Marc Pinardon, 41, a machine operator who worked at the factory \nfor nine years.\nSeveral car-related factories in the region are laying off workers \u201d along with thousands of auto workers losing their \njobs worldwide as the industry undergoes its worst slump in decades.\nPinardon and a colleague, Bruno Perre, a 50-year-old technician at the factory for 29 years, walked through the \nshutdown factory.\n\u0153They throw us a way like Kleenex, Perre said.\nTheir action prompted a copycat event at a factory of Canadian telecoms firm Nortel Networks. Workers at the \nfactory in Chateaufort west of Paris briefly installed gas canisters at their plant before removing them Thursday.\nLabor Minister Xavier Darcos said he \u0153understood the anger of the workers but warned against such \u0153incredible \nviolence.\nThe factorys outgoing director Pierre Reau walked briskly past workers Thursday without interacting with them.\n\u0153It worries everyone because some people are uncontrollable, he told The Associated Press.\nAnne Frackowiak, top aide to the local governor in Chatellerault, said she thinks the workers gas canisters are \nempty but that \u0153we are watching.\n\u0153The biggest risk is a gigantic fire, but the fire department is on permanent alert, she said.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: heroyalwhyness [|Return to headlines]\n\n\n\n           Treasury Boss Courts Mideast, Sees Gradual Rebound\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner reached out to Gulf Arab leaders Tuesday, stressing to some of \nAmericas top creditors that his country has a \u0153special responsibility to steer the world through a global recession \nthat may finally be showing signs of easing.\nA key aim of Geithners trip is to convince the major oil producers that the U.S. still welcomes their business, and \nhas plans to get itself out of a crisis stemming from what he said was an \u0153unsustainable fiscal path.\n\u0153The force of the global recession is receding, Geithner told Saudi Arabian business leaders in the commercial \nhub of Jiddah, the starting point of his first official visit to the Middle East.. \u0153Global trade is just starting to expand \nagain.\nBut while noting that the International Monetary Fund has revised up growth forecasts in the second half of 2009 \nand into 2010, he cautioned that the signs of improvement were fragile and that the \u0153process of repair and \nrecovery is going to take considerably more time.\n\u0153This crisis has been brutal in the extent and severity of damage to economies around the world, he said. \u0153Given \nthe extent of damage to financial systems \u00a6 it seems realistic to expect a gradual recovery, with more than the usual \nups and downs and temporary reversals.\nGeithners Mideast trip was billed as a follow-up to President Barack Obamas recent overtures to the region. But the \nstop in the Saudi Arabia \u201d the Arab worlds largest economy and OPECs de facto leader \u201d is also a clear reflection of \nthe growing financial clout of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council.\nThe treasury secretary arrives for talks in the neighboring United Arab Emirates, the No. 2 Arab economy, on \nWednesday.\nWhat Geithner has to say in private to officials in the oil-rich region could help determine whether the Obama \nadministrations efforts to right the U.S. economy succeed. The Arab Gulf states are major backers of U.S. \ncompanies and government bonds and, as a group, are the biggest U.S. creditor after China.\nAs the American economy has weakened, it raised questions as to whether the dollar could remain the worlds top \nreserve currency, a key issue for the heavily leveraged U.S. with a deficit that recently topped $1 trillion for the first \ntime. The slowdown also increased concerns that major foreign creditors could look to more lucrative investments in \nstrong developing economies outside the U.S.\n\u0153The (Gulf) countries have a big stake in the financial stability of the United States. Theyre a big creditor, said \nNasser Saidi, chief economist of the Dubai International Financial Center. \u0153The earlier you bring the Gulf and the \nMiddle East onto the agenda, the better.\nThe Gulf states wealth skyrocketed during oils earlier boom years, but they have grown increasingly concerned as \ncrude prices and the value of their investments soured.\nFive of the GCC nations \u201d Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar \u201d peg their currency to the dollar. \nKuwait uses a basket of currencies that includes the greenback.\n\u0153This is a visit to really re-emphasize U.S. leadership and U.S. pre-eminence in the world economy even in the \nmidst of this global downturn, said Tarik Yousef, dean of the Harvard-affiliated Dubai School of Government. \u0153The \nlast thing the U.S. wants is for people to lose confidence in its policies and its currency.\nGeithner, who was in London on Monday, said the Obama administration is committed to preserving the openness \nof the U..S. economy. He said the U.S. realizes it has \u0153a special responsibility in protecting the value of the dollar, \nwhich remains the worlds dominant currency.\nHe was to hold talks with Saudi King Abdullah and his top financial advisers later Tuesday, and will meet with \nofficials from the UAEs powerful state investment funds on Wednesday. From the Emirates, he heads to Paris.\nIn Saudi Arabia, Geithner laid out a four-point strategy that he said is essential for economic recovery.\nIt includes stabilizing and repairing the U.S. financial system, helping offset the dramatic contraction in demand, \nworking with the major economies of the world on a coordinated program of macroeconomic stimulus and financial \nstabilization and focusing on the future by building a stronger and more productive economy.\n\u0153In the United States, we need to make sure that as we rebuild, we build a stronger and more productive \neconomy, less prone to crisis, with the gains of growth more broadly shared, he said, adding that the government \nwas determined to cut the deficit once officials were sure the global crisis was over.\nAmerica \u0153was on an unsustainable fiscal path before this crisis, and we will not succeed in establishing \nsustainable recovery without a credible commitment to address our long-term deficits, he said.

A companion bill \nis pending before a House Judiciary subcommittee.\nSteve Largent, president and CEO of CTIA-The Wireless Association, testified that he didnt believe cell phone \njamming would fully address the issue. He told the committee there are better technological alternatives.\nOne alternative Largent proposed is called cell detection, technology that would enable prison officials to find a cell \nphone used inside a correctional environment without sending an interfering signal. By detecting the cell phone, \nprison officials could find and confiscate cell phones in prison without interfering with citizens cell phone use or \npublic safety channels.\nLargent said another approach to the problem would be to use technology to manage wireless access in a prison. \nManaged access would restrict cell phone use in a certain area to people who are authorized to use it.\n\u0153Put simply, the right solution is one that effectively prohibits access by those who should not have it while \nensuring that law-abiding citizens and public safety users enjoy the most reliable service possible, Largent said. His \ngroup, CTIA, is the international association for the wireless telecommunications industry.\nThe dangerous and far-reaching aspects of prisoner cell phone use were illustrated in Maryland two years ago, \nwhen a Baltimore drug dealer used a cell phone to plan the killing of a witness from the city jail. In May, Patrick A. \nByers Jr. was convicted of murdering Carl S. Lackl Jr., who had identified Byers as the gunman in a previous killing.\nGary Maynard, secretary of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, emphasized that \nthe problem is a national issue, noting that California prison officials collected more than 2,800 cell phones last year \n\u201d two times the amount found the previous year.\n\u0153We need to fight technology with technology, Maynard said.\nMaryland has made a request to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration for a 30-minute \ndemonstration at a Maryland prison that houses federal inmates to inform Congress about available technology to \ncombat illicit cell phone use.\nThe agency shares responsibility for managing the nations communications network with the Federal \nCommunications Commission.\nLast week, South Carolinas prison chief said corrections directors in 26 states signed on to a petition he sent to the \nFCC asking federal regulators permission to jam cell phone signals inside state penitentiaries.\nLawrence E. Strickling, assistant secretary for communications and information at the Commerce Department, cited \nthe South Carolina filing in a response to Maryland Gov. Martin OMalleys request to the NTIA. Strickling wrote that \nhe has reached out to the FCC \u0153so that the two agencies can develop a coordinated approach with respect to the \njamming issue generally and your specific proposal in the state of Maryland.\nThe FCC has authority over non-governmental radio communications, while the NTIA has authority over federal \nuses of the radio spectrum.\nUnder current law, the FCC can only allow federal agencies \u201d not state or local authorities \u201d permission to jam cell \nphone signals. The FCC has denied two recent requests from the District of Columbia and Louisiana for test \njamming sessions.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: heroyalwhyness [|Return to headlines]\n\nhttp://www.newsday.com/news/politics/wire/sns-ap-us-prisons-cell-phones,0,5314677.story\n\n\n           Denmark: Arctic Rivalry Heating Up\nParliaments plans to build up the militarys presence in the Arctic will provoke an arms race in the region, worries \nformer military commander\nThe military is ready to begin a military build up in Greenland that will see the creation of an Arctic task force and an \nArctic command.\nThe efforts will strengthen Denmarks military presence in the region at the same time as Canada and Russia have \nalso announced that they will adjust their national defence strategies to adapt to more traffic, more mining and more \npotential conflicts in the Arctic.\nParliaments recently adopted defence budget for 2010 to 2014 concludes that increasing activity in the Arctic will \ntransform the regions strategic importance and eventually lead to more challenges for the military.\nIn order to meet those challenges, an arctic task force drawing on elements from all branches of the military \ncapable of operating in the Arctic will be set up from the existing defence capabilities.\nThe plan also calls for the possible use of fighter jets for occasional tasks related to monitoring and assertion of \nsovereignty in and around Greenland, as well as for a study into whether the US Air Forces Thule Air Base could \nplay a larger role in defence tasks in and around Greenland, in cooperation with other partner countries.\nAxel Fiedler, former head of the Greenland Command, warned however against an \u02dcunnecessary militarisation.\n\u02dcWhy start talking about fighters to Greenland? There is no threat whatsoever towards Greenland and no one \ndenies the sovereignty of Greenland he said.\nIn addition to Denmarks on-going border dispute with Canada, the two countries, along with Russia, Norway and \nthe US are currently in the process of staking their territorial claims in the Arctic with the UN.\nThe process will see the Arctic Ocean divided up amongst the five Arctic powers, and Fiedler believes that the \ndefence bill could provide Canada with new arguments for continuing its arms build up in the Arctic, just as \npoliticians in Russia can use it to demand that the Russian military become more visible in the region.\nFiedler urged Greenlands self-rule government to protest against the plans, but Premier Kupik Kleist backs the \nproposals plans to improve efforts to prevent environmental and shipping disasters.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: TB [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Far Right is Left Out at E.U.s Assembly\nBy STEPHEN CASTLE\n\nSTRASBOURG \u201d It was hardly the ideal start for a career in the European Parliament. Traveling to his first \nappearance in Strasbourg this week, Nick Griffin, the leader of the far-right British National Party, found himself by \nthe side of the highway explaining to the French police why his car had broken the speed limit.\n\u0153I wasnt driving, Mr. Griffin said Tuesday in describing his encounter with the French authorities. He added that the \ncar was doing only \u0153about 10 over the limit.\nAll in all, it was not a great debut for Europes far right, whose arrival here failed to generate the anticipated \npyrotechnics. Newly elected members from extremist parties found themselves marginalized, with no speaking slot \nwhen the Parliament elected Jerzy Buzek, a former Polish prime minister, as president.\nThey will have a chance to speak soon, but the B.N.P. and other far right parties will not control any of the \nassemblys influential committees.\nThere was much attention paid last month when extremist parties made gains in the European Union elections, a \nsuccess that reflected widespread disenchantment with the traditional parties. But though Parliament was braced \nfor publicity-seeking tactics Tuesday, the far right parties made a minimal impact.\nOne member from the Hungarian party Jobbik was seen in paramilitary fatigues, and another wore traditional dress. \nBut both were overshadowed by the arrival of a center-right Czech member who had cycled from Prague to \nStrasbourg and appeared in the chamber in his cycling shirt and shorts.\n\nFar-right members from the Netherlands, Austria and Bulgaria were low key, and the B.N.P., which is trying to shed \nits image for menacing street politics, sought to portray itself as a mainstream political party. The B.N.P. won its first \nrepresentation in the European Parliament last month. Mr. Griffin, one of the two elected, complained about being \ndenied access to the same briefing and information that other British members get.\n\nhttp://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/46275-arctic-rivalry-heating-up.html\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/world/europe/15iht-union.html?_r=1\n\n\n\u0153Im disappointed but not surprised, he said. \u0153We are second-class citizens. Its unfortunate to be in this position, \nbut Im not surprised.\n\nBritish officials said they give the B.N.P. members standard briefings and other documents on request but are not \nengaging proactively with them. Unlike other British members, the two representatives from the B.N.P. have not \nbeen invited to a reception Wednesday hosted by Britains minister for Europe, Glenys Kinnock.\nThe far right also found itself on the outside when it came to forming transnational groups with common ideological \noutlooks. Such groups get more financing from the Parliament and also get to head the most influential committees. \nBut the far right failed to find common cause with enough other parties to form a group.\n\u0153They can start a dispute or create a scandal, said Dirk Sterckx, a Liberal Democrat member from Belgium, \u0153if \nthey publish material with money from the Parliament. They can use the Parliament as a way to attract attention.\n\u0153But if you are a party like the B.N.P. or the Vlaams Belang in Belgium, you dont play a role on policy here on \nimmigration, the accession of Turkey to the E.U., or human rights and civil liberties.\nThe composition of the new European Parliament underlines a shift to the right after the failure of the center-left to \nmount an effective challenge to most European center-right governments.\nBritains Conservative Party, which left the Parliaments main center-right grouping, formed another 55-strong bloc \nwith the Czech party O.D.S. and the Polish party Law and Justice. But strains within the group emerged \nimmediately when a Conservative member, Edward McMillan-Scott, was suspended from the party organization for \nrunning against another member of the group for a vice-presidential position within the European Parliament.\nA grouping that includes the U.K. Independence Party, which wants to take Britain out of the European Union., and \nthe Northern League in Italy now numbers 30 members as opposed to the 22 in the U.K.I.P.s group last time.\n\u0153If there is a larger representation of Euroskeptics in the European Parliament, Mr. Buzek said, \u0153this is a signal \nthat our message to the population of the continent was not clear enough.\nThe Parliament should, he added, \u0153demonstrate to them what integration is about and how hard their lives would \nbe without this integration.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: TV [|Return to headlines]\n\n           France: July 14, 240 Arrests in Clashes With Police\n(ANSAmed) \u201d PARIS, JULY 14 \u201d Approximately 240 people were arrested in France last night on the eve of the \nnational celebration of July 14, in clashes with the police.

For those who need to be \nintroduced to, or just reminded of, this tough specialized police force, it was originally created to keep \u0153order in the \ncountryside and soon enough acquired a reputation for ruthlessness and freewheeling violence. When the time \ncame, it was also the gendarmerie who carried out the deportation of Jews into the arms of their executioners in \nAuschwitz and other destinations. Also, they were the ones who attempted a coup against Governor Mikl\u00f3s Horthy \nin July 1944, from which only a tank division of the military could dissuade them.\n\nBut back to our time! Enter Zsolt Lipusz. This unusual name belongs to a successful and respected high school \nteacher of history in the city of Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za. He moonlights as the deputy chief of the local organization of Jobbik \nand is also the author of incredibly vicious articles, where else, but on            www.kuruc.info.hu and of course \nSzent Korona R\u00e1di\u00f3 (the Radio of the Sacred Crown). Lipusz also advocates the re-establishment of the \ngendarmerie because, as all ultra-rightists believe, only a super hard organization like that can restore \u0153order in a \ncountry riddled with \u0153Gypsy crime. He nostalgically tells the story of how a couple of gendarmes scared a whole \nvillage of Gypsies into submission by just threatening them. None of that fancy-schmancy due process for those \ngendarmes! He even supplies pictorial support for his assertion, and indeed the picture speaks for itself:\nNo wonder the word \u0153gendarmes was often hyphenated with \u0153terror: \u0153csendor-terror. But Lipusz, in keeping with \nJobbiks highest desires, calls the picture \u0153heartwarming.\nThe gendarmerie was not only an instrument of terror in the villages. They were also key players in the Hungarian \nHolocaust. As an arm of the state, they collected all the worldly possessions of the dispossessed Jews before \nshepherding them into the ghettos. They made sure that the Jews got no food, water, or any other \u0153comfort before \nthey were forced into the cattle cars.\nGendarmes escort the deportees in Nagykor\u00f6s\nGendarmes lead the Jews to the railroad stations\nThey bring the Jews of Kiskunmajsa to the wagons\nAnd they deliver these children from Transylvania to Auschwitz\nIf all these \u0153heroics of the gendarmerie were not enough, one of the highlights of their activities was the occupation \nof Northern Serbia, particularly Novi Sad (??jvid\u00e9k), in the winter of 1942.

The number of victims was never firmly established; some estimates are \nas high as 12,000, but even the lowest is 3,000-4,000. Some victims were rounded up on the frozen river Danube, \nin which openings in the ice were created by grenades, and the people were shot and tossed into the water through \nthese holes. This was also the work of the gendarmerie:\nNovi Sad in 1942\nAnd of course, they were not without a sense of humor. For amusement they humiliated the local rabbi, forcing him \nto wash their car:\nThe Jobbik and with them the entire right-wing of the Hungarian political class, with the support of the Catholic \nChurch, is enthusiastically campaigning for the resurrection of the gendarmerie. They believe that this is the only \nway to restore order to the country. In the meantime, to accomplish that goal, they dont hesitate to break the law \nand they work feverishly to overturn the present regime at every opportunity they find, because, they claim, the \npresent order is not order.

The Guard \nhas already held two demonstrations against the ban, one of which ended in a clash with police, and has vowed to \nreorganise itself in a number of inventive ways.\nThe Hungarian Guard is likely to continue holding marches regularly to exert its presence, \u0153testing and provoking \nlegislators and political actors, the analysts said. They predicted that Jobbiks political control over the Guards \nactivities would lax in the future.\nThe ban has put Jobbik under considerable pressure, as the Hungarian Guards role as a \u0153bridge between the \nparty and the most extreme, splintered groups comes under strain. Jobbik leadership has tried hard to prevent a \nbreakaway, with Jobbik leader Gabor Vona attending a sit-down against the Guards ban, the analysts added.\nOn the other hand, the governments firm stand against the Guard reflected in the ban and its ensuing \nimplementation backed by police action could help return voters to the ruling Socialist party, the analysts said, \nadding that polls show a majority of Hungarians approving of the ban.\nThe main opposition Fidesz party has already encountered difficulties with the strengthening of Jobbik as seen in \ntheir good results in the European elections in June, and the ban on the Hungarian Guard could bring more \nuncertainty to the partys ranks. Although Fidesz has distanced itself from Jobbik and said it would not enter \ncoalition with them if given the chance, there are overlaps in important issues for the two parties where a fight to \npull voters continues, the analysts said.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: heroyalwhyness [|Return to headlines]\n\n           If this Kind of thing is the First Draft of History, I Pity them\nVia Blogger Nopasaran!\nposted by Joe Noory @ 10:54\nThis weekend whilst leafing through the news, I found myself looking for written evidence of something I had heard \nfrom an international broadcaster which seemed to me like a stunning breakthrough for the slow-moving world of \nmedia in Europe. The Polish will actually be privatizing their state-run media. Period. End of story.\nThe largest communications conduit in their language can no longer ever be commandeered by an elected official. \nIts a stunning development for an environment like the EU, and exhibits a shockingly high level of trust that a \nsociety can have for its population by European standards. Im quite sure Natalie and Co. are over the moon about it \ntoo.\nHowever, as of Sunday, there was little to be found about it from the big news agencies, with one rather \nschizophrenic report where it is buried in an item about a politician who once associated himself with people who \nturned out to be garden-variety European neo-fascists.\nAdding to the confusion, members of TVPs own supervisory board turned against Farfal last week, suspending him \nand replacing him with a former deputy. But the government, though keen to oust Farfal, branded that move \ntechnically invalid.\nGrad accused Farfal and what he called TVPs \u0153highly politicised supervisory board of wasting public money.\n\nhttp://www.politics.hu/20090715/analysts-say-ban-on-magyar-garda-has-risks-for-jobbik\nhttp://no-pasaran.blogspot.com/2009/07/if-this-kind-of-thing-is-first-draft-of.html\n\n\n\u0153The situation (at TVP) is bad but the easiest way to resolve it is for President Kaczynski to sign the new media bill \nnow waiting on his desk, said Grad.\nApart from making it easier to remove Farfal from his post, the new bill would cut back state funding for public \nmedia, scrap Polands national television and radio licence fee and prepare TVP for digitalisation.\nWith an amazing lack of self awareness the report even made a point of telling us that the two stories were not \nrelated, a mere few paragraphs after defaming privatization through association \u201d a strange thing for an \ninternational, non-state media racket like Reuters to report.\nIts really strange, actually, to see how some reporters minds operate in the vacuum like that. The ideological \nposition held by the inverse of the target of this story is precisely the one normally all about the defending of a \npotent state media with as little editorial and information gathering competition as possible.\nGrad accused Farfal and what he called TVPs \u0153highly politicised supervisory board of wasting public money.\n- something that has never seemed to bother the European left for a moment, so long as it operated in the \nnarrowing of the public realm around the socialist world view, but here we see an interesting development: a nation \nwhere the dominant parties in political society in agreement about the role of freedom of speech and the state.\nOnce you scrape away the statements and the window dressing that comes out of every other state-related media \nsource in Europe, the move by the Poles is as radical as it gets. Compared to the government reigned-in oligarchs \nthat operate Russias supposed \u0153independent media, it simply stunning.\nSo the question remains why something that big could be fumbling around with so little relevance in some writers \nhead, that IT isnt the lead item or a story of its own.\n\nThink about it \u201d the French and the British \u201d two of the societies with a past history of the proponency of freedom of \nexpression, and both with no shortage of understanding of the burden and suspicion that a state-run media can \nburden a society with STILL have state run media establishments, but Poland is simply disposing of theirs for \nprecisely the right reasons.\nBut the story gets bound up with a near press-release style political folly.

I understand that these are blast bombs that \nare used and they are sort of, if you like, crowd control weaponry. I dont think that we are seeing a return to the \ntypes of bombing that we saw in the 70s, 80s and even in the 90s which resulted in large loss of life.\nI think that the political situation is critical but stable might be a good way of describing it.\nBecause you have got the two most extreme groups from the Protestant side \u201d the Democratic Unionist Party and \nfrom the republican side, Sinn Fein \u201d actually locked into a power sharing agreement at Stormont which is Northern \nIrelands Parliament House, I think that that is actually quite a good outcome because it means that these two \nextremist groups are not marginalised and they are actually part of the peace process in a way that they werent \nbefore 2007 and whilst this has been actually bad news for the more moderate nationalist and unionist parties, I \nthink it does give the hopes of peace a greater chance in Northern Ireland.\nI dont think that things like this, whilst they are serious, I dont think they are going to derail the whole peace \nprocess.\nBRONWYN HERBERT: Sinn Feins Gerry Kelly, now an Irish republican MP has blamed the Real IRA for the \ntrouble in northern Belfast. Would you agree?\n\nBEN WELLINGS: Um, yes. I mean this is some sort of splinter group. I mean I couldnt say for definite whether it is \nthe Real IRA or not but it seems to be some kind of splinter group who have detached themselves from the IRA \nwho they feel are too involved in the peace process so it seems to me that this is trouble being caused by a \nminority of people but it also might suggest that there is still a group of maybe young protesters who are quite keen \nto riot.\nNow, whether they are politically motivated or I mean, I have even seen it referred to as recreational rioting, again is \nsomething that may vary from place to place but I do think this is the work of a minority splinter group.\nPETER CAVE: Dr Ben Wellings from the Australian National University, speaking there to Bronwyn Herbert.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: heroyalwhyness [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Potentially Powerful: The European Defence Agency at Five Years\nEUOBSERVER / COMMENT \u201d Most Europeans have probably never heard of the European Defence Agency, \nwhich celebrates its fifth anniversary this month. Yet, this little known EU agency has slowly created a basis for the \ndevelopment of common military projects. While its achievements can certainly not be called spectacular, in the \ncontext of the problematic nature of European defence cooperation, the EDA has shown more potential than its \npredecessors.\nDiverging national interests in the areas of procurement and defence industry policies still impede much of the \nagencys planned progress. Industry takes a front seat in the EDA decision-making process, with easy access to all \nrelevant players though, naturally, it complains about the lack of speed.\nLike most developments in the area of European military co-operation, the work of the EDA is happening \ncompletely outside the view of the wider general public. The lack of public involvement in an area that is still highly \ncontroversial, undermines its legitimacy and risks further erosion of public support for the wider European project.\n\nhttp://euobserver.com/13/28451/?rk=1\n\n\nWith a long history of failures to foster European co-operation on arms production and procurement, the \nestablishment of the European Defence Agency (EDA) on 12 July 2004 was received with considerable scepticism.\nEnd of the Cold War era\nThe end of the Cold War era had changed perspectives on European defence, while emerging conflicts across its \nborders \u201d especially in the Balkans, but also outside Europe \u201d gave a significant impetus to increased military co-\noperation. European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) developed rapidly. On the legal front, ESDP was \nforemost in the process towards the EU Constitution, while out-of-area operations have mushroomed over the past \nfew years.\nThe statement in the Constitution that \u0153Member States shall undertake progressively to improve their military \ncapabilities is directly linked to the establishment of the EDA. It has led many to doubt whether Europe intends to be \na friendly military power. Such suspicions have been further fuelled by the EDA mantra that \u0153we need to spend \nmore and to spend better. Its claims that military co-operation would lead to rationalised forces and thus save \nmoney, have not proved credible.\nAlong the same lines, French President Sarkozy has argued that, \u0153Europe cannot be a dwarf in terms of defence \nand a giant in economic matters. Then Greek Defence Minister Papantoniou said in 2003: \u0153We [Europe] must \nstrengthen our presence, especially in the defence field, in order for the United States to view us seriously. \nCuriously, he saw the main obstacle being \u0153that after the Cold War there is no strong threat. We have to overcome \nthis problem.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: islam ophobe [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Spanish Court Drops Charges Against US Soldiers\n\nMADRID \u201d A Spanish court on Tuesday threw out charges against three U.S. soldiers in the death of a Spanish \njournalist in Iraq six years ago and recommended the case be closed.\nThe National Court said investigative magistrate Santiago Pedraz had produced no new evidence to indicate that \nthe soldiers had acted incorrectly, given that they were in a war situation.\nThe soldiers, members of a tank crew, said they were responding to hostile fire when they shot at a Baghdad hotel \nhousing Western journalists during the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.\nSpanish cameraman Jose Couso was one of two journalists killed in the shooting. The other was Reuters \ncameraman Taras Portsyk.\n\nPedraz first charged the soldiers in 2007. The National Court threw out that indictment this year, saying the \nevidence was insufficient and concluded the Cousos death was an accident of war.\nBut Pedraz reinstated it in May citing new evidence from three Spanish journalists who were at the hotel at the time \nof the shelling and looking out of a hotel window along with Couso.\nThese reporters testified that the tank had not come under fire before shooting at the Palestine Hotel.\nBut in the latest ruling, the National Court said their testimonies provided no new evidence which could lead the \ncourt to question the soldiers claims that they believed, rightly or wrongly, they had come under fire, possibly from a \nsniper.\nU.S. officials said investigations had shown the soldiers acted correctly.\nThe American soldiers \u201d Sgt. Shawn Gibson, Capt. Philip Wolford and Lt. Col. Philip DeCamp \u201d were all from the \nU.S. 3rd Infantry Division, based in Fort Stewart, Georgia.\nFollowing the incident, then-U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said American troops had opened fire after hostile \nfire from the hotel, perhaps from a sniper. He said a U.S. review of the incident found the use of force was justified.\n\nTuesdays ruling came after state prosecutors appealed against Pedrazs decision to reinstate the charges.\nThe court said the latest ruling could not be appealed.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: heroyalwhyness [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Sweden: \u02dcSackey Wasky Whacks Wallets of Swedish Men\n\nhttp://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090714/ap_on_re_eu/eu_spain_journalist_death\nhttp://www.thelocal.se/20682/20090715/\n\n\nA cunning internet con artist posing as a love-struck woman from Ghana has succeeded in defrauding a number of \nSwedish men of hundreds of thousands of kronor.\nGoing by the name Sackey Wasky and lurking on the popular Match.com dating site, the fraudster managed to \nconvince hundreds of men to open their wallets for what they thought were pleas for assistance for everything from \nplane tickets to shipping costs.\nThe scam was aided by authentic looking passport and visa documents meant to assuage any lingering doubts in \nthe minds of Sackey Waskys unsuspecting targets.\n\u0153I must be honest with you that I really miss you so much.

The right to use the powers has to be renewed every 28 days.\nBut Hampshire Assistant Chief Constable David Pryde conceded his forces figures on stop and search had made it \nthink again.\n\u02dcAfter review, we determined that it would be appropriate to be more in line with other forces, he said. \u02dcWe now \nhave suspended Section 44 Stop and Search until such time as the perceived threat is raised to the highest level.\nMr Pryde said the figures reflected several factors including the car bomb at Glasgow Airport on June 30, 2007, \nwhen the terrorism threat level was raised to critical nationally.\nMinistry of Defence Police Section 44 Stop and Search incidents are also recorded under Hampshire and there are \na large number of military installations in Hampshire.\nHowever, another neighbouring force, Surrey Police, did use it 2,559 times in 2007/8 but again with no arrests for \nterrorism recorded.\nAccording to Home Office statistics, 124,687 Section 44 stop and searches were carried out in England and Wales \nin 2007/08 \u201d almost three times the 41,924 of the previous year.\nEighty seven per cent of the searches took place in the Metropolitan Police area. Just one per cent of suspects \nwere arrested.\nJames Welch, of Liberty, said: \u02dcHampshire Polices suspension of Terrorism Act stop and search is an extremely \nwelcome step. Normal stop and search powers, triggered by reasonable suspicion, are more than adequate for \nroutine policing and far less likely to alienate law-abiding people.\nChief Constable Craig Mackey, of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: \u02dcPowers to stop and search are an \nimportant part of tackling terrorism but should always be used in a proportionate way.\n\u02dcThe use of stop and search by forces is something that is constantly under review. Used correctly, stop and search \nis a powerful tool that can help protect all our communities from terrorism. \u02dc\nHampshire effectively suspended its use of Section 44 on April 22 when it did not re-apply to extend its powers.\nThe Metropolitan Police is reviewing how Section 44 is used across the whole of the capital, including a pilot of its \nmore restricted use.\nLast month Lord Carlile, a Liberal Democrat peer and QC, suggested whites are being needlessly stopped in order \nto balance the books.\nHe said: \u02dcIf, for example, 50 blonde women are stopped who fall nowhere near any intelligence-led terrorism profile, \nits a gross invasion of the civil liberties of those 50 blonde women.\n\u02dcThe police are perfectly entitled to stop people who fall within a terrorism profile

and \nthreatened to take it to the police unless she was given money.\nSturges, herself a Muslim convert, was found guilty following a three-week trial at Truro Crown Court of three \ncounts of

\ncompensation and legal costs of \u00a38,500.\nJudge Paul Darlow told Sturges that blackmail was a \u02dcwicked and ugly crime and she had \u02dcgrossly betrayed Miss \nHussains trust.\nHe said: \u02dcThis was a sustained campaign lasting five to six weeks, a campaign where you used her religious beliefs \nand ethnicity to isolate and frighten her.\n\u02dcThe motive must have been one of sheer greed.\nThe judge said Sturges knew the Hussain family were \u02dchard-working, modestly-paid people and she had extracted \nmoney \u02dcthey could barely afford.\nDuring the trial, prosecuting barrister Llewellyn Sellick said Sturges told Miss Hussain to get her family in Woking, \nSurrey, to pay various sums of money escalating from \u00a3200.\nWhen they became suspicious, her father travelled to Devon and the police were informed.\nThe court heard that, during the time of the offences, more than \u00a37,000 was transferred into Miss Hussains bank \naccount and she withdrew around \u00a39,000.\nSturges, a gift shop owner, was acquitted of three counts of blackmail relating to money handed over before Miss \nHussains family were involved.\nMiss Hussain told the court she was

Another would be the \nruthless campaign of \u0153targeted assassinations, whereby Israeli agents took out important leaders of Hamas and \nIslamic Jihad, the two organizations most committed to \u0153martyrdom operations.. A third might be the temporary \ntruces or cease-fires to which Hamas (but not Islamic Jihad) have from time to time agreed.\nBut, actually, none of these would explain why the suicide campaign went into remission.

He \nadvocated Karabakh independence. But this perception made the situation more difficult, he said.\nEvaluating the Russian mediation of the talks, Grigorian said he did not believe Moscow was honest about a clear \nsolution to the dispute, adding: \u0153Russia just pursues its own interest in the negotiations. Therefore, a solution will \nnot be possible unless the interests of Russia, along with the U.S., have been met.\nAccording to Grigorian, Russia wants to be the only power in the Caucasus region and a possible deal between \nYerevan and Baku means waning Russian influence in both former Soviet countries. Recalling Russias recognition \nof the Georgian rebel regions of South Ossetia and Abhkazia, Grigorian said that like the international community \nRussia had never recognized the independence of Karabakh.\n\nhttp://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=-2009-07-15\nhttp://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=no-breakthrough-from-caucasus-talks-says-armenian-official-2009-07-14\n\n\n\u0153Armenia thinks Russia will always be the protector country, but this is a big mistake. Russias stance on \nKarabakhs independence should be an important lesson for Armenia, he said.\nCriticism of optimism:\nGrigorian said he thought attempts by Bryza for a solution were left wanting. \u0153It is hard to understand the optimism \nof Bryza on the Karabakh issue. Optimistic statements raise expectations and that is extremely wrong. Bryza does \nnot know the area well enough and this is a great danger.\nHe also suggested that rushing the process might pose grave risks to the region and could even lead to another \nwar, which would cause instability not only in the Caucasus but also in the Middle East.\nGrigorian said among all EU nations, only the policies of France were similar to the Russian stance \u0153because of \nthe French hostility toward Turkey.\n\u0153France does not want Turkish-Armenian relations improved, he said, adding: \u0153Ankara is seeking a deal with the \nArmenians that will open the EUs doors to Turkey. However, France does not want to see Turkey among the EU \nfamily.\nAs a result the key to a solution is in the hands of the Armenian and Azerbaijani people, Gregorian said, adding that \nthey should be further informed because both societies were not ready for the solution process yet.\nGregorian said he also believed Turkey might play an active role in the process by establishing dialogue with \nArmenia. But warned: \u0153Like Cyprus, the Karabakh problem is not one that can be solved quickly.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: heroyalwhyness [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Russian Activist Found Murdered\nA prominent Russian human rights activist, Natalia Estemirova, has been found dead in the North Caucasus.\nShe was bundled into a van and abducted as she left her home in Chechnya on Wednesday morning, a colleague \nsaid.

He runs for his life as the \nenormous cloud of smoke, dirt and shrapnel conceals the bodies of two U.S. Marines killed by the explosion.\nThe picture was taken yesterday as the bodies of eight UK servicemen killed in 24 hours last week were flown \nhome to RAF Lyneham and honoured by thousands lining the streets of the Wiltshire town of Wootton Bassett.\nSeven were killed by IEDs in three separate incidents \u201d five from the 2nd Battalion The Rifles died together in an \nambush near the town of Sangin, northern Helmand.\nA Taliban fighter looks through binoculars in an undisclosed location in Afghanistan\n\nThis year 36 of the 47 British soldiers killed in Afghanistan have been victims of IEDs, which have become the \nTalibans most feared and effective weapon. The soldier in this picture and the two killed in the Gamsir district of \nHelmand were from the U.S.. 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade.\nTheir deaths bring the number of U.S. soldiers killed by IEDs in Helmand over the last three days to six. The total \nnumber of American troops killed in Afghanistan so far this year is 107, compared with 151 in the whole of 2008.\nAn Italian soldier was also killed by a roadside bomb which exploded in the western province of Farah yesterday.\nThree others were wounded. Three hundred UK bomb disposal specialist soldiers are to be sent to Helmand to help \nto counter the threat. Last year 3,276 IEDs were detected and safely detonated by bomb disposal officers.\nIn recent months, the Taliban has used increasingly sophisticated tactics in its attacks \u201d many perfected by Al \nQaeda and insurgents in Iraq \u201d and placed hundreds of IEDs along routes.\n\nBomb makers have been able to adapt their devices and tactics as U.S. and British forces have introduced \nmethods to counter the threat.\nThey have been using three types of IED: the roadside bomb where an insurgent detonates the device by wire; the \nremote bomb set off by radio or mobile phone signal; and the conventional landmine which is buried beneath the \nroad surface before being detonated by the pressure of a passing vehicle.\nThe IEDs generally consist of a landmine or artillery shell rigged to a makeshift detonator and, increasingly, to \nfertiliser to give it greater impact.\nSome are extremely basic, but others are more inventive and it is possible for the bomb to be set to explode under \na third or fourth vehicle in any convoy.\nIn Iraq, insurgents would often block a road with other vehicles to stop a convoy in a precise position over an IED, \nbut in Afghanistan many of the attacks have been against soldiers on foot patrols and triggered by trip wires or \nbooby traps.\nHelmand is ideal territory for bomb makers as patrols often go through compounds of mud walls where holes can \nbe cut, a bomb implanted, and the hole filled with mud which will have dried within a couple of hours.\nSoldiers usually carry electronic equipment that creates a \u02dcbubble around them, blocking any electronic signal that \nmight trigger a bomb \u201d but the Taliban has found ways around this.\nA civilian helicopter ferrying humanitarian aid was shot down in Helmand yesterday, killing all six Ukrainian crew \nmembers and a child on the ground, officials said.\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1199753/Two-U-S-soldiers-lie-dead-Captured-film-boobytrap-bombs-killing-British-troops.html\n\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: heroyalwhyness [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Will History Repeat Itself in Afghanistan?\n\nBritish military intervention in Afghanistan has a chequered history, making it easy to conclude that British forces \nwill fail again.

However, if one compares the specific experiences of soldiers and officers, there is much to learn \nfrom Britains history in Afghanistan.\n\nMany know that the British tried three times between 1839 and 1919 to subjugate Afghanistan, and each time they \nfailed.\n\nBut when dealing with the history of British military involvement in Afghanistan, and in the difficult business of \nlooking for parallels between then and now, it is necessary to separate the general from the specific.\nThe reasons for the wars in the 19th Century were somewhat different and incomparable with the reasons for the \nwar now. If general comparisons of the conflicts are made, without looking at the specifics, it might be easy to \nconclude that there is little hope for success in Afghanistan.\n\nThe First Anglo-Afghan War broke out when Britain invaded Afghanistan because she feared Russian \nencroachment into Central Asia. The British were eventually routed and the 16,000 strong army forced to flee \nKabul in the winter of 1841.

Yesterday, Premier Recep Tayyip Erdogan defined \nwhat is happening in China as \u0153nearly genocide. The Turkish prime minister made this statement at the end of the \nG8 in LAquila, where the heads of nations did not mention events in Xinjiang at all, though President Hu Jintao \ncancelled his presence at the summit as a result of the demonstrations and subsequent clashes between Uyghurs \nand police and between Han and Uyghurs in recent days.\n\u0153On the one hand \u201d said Erdogan \u201d we talk about universal human rights, but on the other hand, we have to \nwitness something like this. Stating that he has expressed his concerns to the heads of state and ministers of the \nG8, the Turkish premier added: \u0153I have used the word \u02dcatrocity before?? no other word can describe a situation \nwhich is nearly genocide in which hundreds have been killed and more than 1,000 others wounded.\nErdogan also said that Turkey is considering putting the issue of the Uyghurs on the agenda of the Security \nCouncil, but it is almost certain that China would block the step, it being a permanent member of the Council and \nstating that Xinjiang is an internal problem.\nIn the Islamic  world there are some demonstrations in favour of the Uyghurs. Yesterday in Istanbul about 5 \nthousand people demonstrated in front of the Fatih mosque after Friday prayers shouting \u0153No to ethnic cleansing \nand burning Chinese products. Two days ago, Nihat Ergun, the Turkish trade minister called on his fellow \ncountrymen to boycott Chinese goods. The population of Turkey has historical, linguistic and ethnic bonds with the \nUyghurs.\nThe demonstrations and protests worldwide that have occurred in recent days are all due to the exiled Uyghur \ncommunity.  In Canberra (Australia) 200 people gathered in front of the parliament shouting \u0153death to Chinese \nterrorists.   In Holland, in The Hague other exiled Uyghurs launched stones against the Chinese embassy; other \nexiles in Berlin staged a sit-in in front of the embassy.\nMany ordinary Muslim people have expressed sorrow for what is happening in Xinjiang, but governments are being \nlukewarm in their reactions.\nThe Organization of Islamic Conferences has condemned the use of \u0153disproportionate force and called on China \nfor an \u0153honest inquiry into the incidents.\nThe Iranian foreign minister, Manuchehr Muttaki said that he will telephone his Chinese counterpart to discuss the \nsituation in Xinjiang with him.\nChina is the main trading partner of the Arab countries, surpassing the United States. Between 2004 and 2008 \ntrade between China and Arab countries came to about 100 billion dollars.\nBeijing has also long secured the friendship of Saudi Arabia and Iran. China has increasingly large economic ties \nwith them, with its ever-growing need for oil. In return, Beijing has become their advocate in the international \ncommunity, putting a stop to certain points of the UN embargo against Tehran and willingly closing a eye on the \nworlds criticism of Saudi Arabias human rights record.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: C.

Because the \nGovernment, the Chinese state, has officially said this region is called Xinjiang Autonomous Region but in fact there \nis lack of autonomy, lack of self determination, lack of human rights, dignity or you know human rights activities, \nespecially for the Uighur minority people in this region.\nThats why the priority is given to the Han Chinese and the local Uighurs has been separated, has been assimilated \nand you know, the majority rights, the legal rights, constitutional rights is given to Chinese.\nFor example, obtaining employment, land rights and opening a company, working in any sector of the Government \nemployment sector \u201d its first priority is given to Chinese.\nMARK COLVIN: I think you just used the phrase the \u0153Uighur minority. I thought it was about half and half Han \nChinese and Uighur.\n\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2008/s2620505.htm\n\n\nNUR MUHAMMAD MAJID: At this time, in 2009, the Uighur have become, have officially become the minority in \nthis region.\nMARK COLVIN: And thats because of the Chinese Central Government has migrated central Han Chinese into this \narea?\nNUR MUHAMMAD MAJID: Thats correct. In 1949 there was only 6 per cent of Chinese in our country but now 46 \nper cent of Chinese have been living. This officials say, and we dont believe this one because we have seen every \nday by train, Chinese are migrating; 90,000 illegal migrants are coming into this region.\nMARK COLVIN: To what extent is this conflict about religion? Because Uighurs are mostly Muslim and the Chinese \nhave in some ways tried to paint to paint the idea of Uighur autonomy to connect it in some way with Osama bin \nLaden and so on.\nNUR MUHAMMAD MAJID: Chinese authority would always find some excuse to accuse the people, innocent \npeople because if they dont find some sort of excuse they wont have any sort of things to defend their actions. The \nUighur people inside the East Turkestan region wouldnt have any direct connection with Osama bin Laden, neither \nwith Al Qaeda or neither any Islamic, Islamic movements around the world.\nBecause if you go to any Islamic country or Muslim countries, if you ask, \u0153Do you know about the Uighur people? \nNo, no single one person would say, \u0153Yes, because there is no connection from the Uighur Muslims to the outside \nMuslim communities as well.\nMARK COLVIN: Now tell me what contacts youve had in the last couple of days into Urumqi and other cities in \nXinjiang and what youve been told.\nNUR MUHAMMAD MAJID: The clash is now become so severe, the BBC reported 156 people were dead during \nthe clash and even in Chinese state media didnt show the bodies of the dead people. Why? Because the dead \nbodies are belong to the Uighur community not to the Han Chinese. You have seen the Han Chinese were bleeding \nand you know shouting in the streets and you have seen on TV. Why cant you see dead bodies of the Han \nChinese? There was no Han Chinese bodies dead and you know, all of these, killed people or you know, people \nare Uighurs and my friends told me, \u0153Just laugh mate. Chinese, the people, the local residents also start house to \nhouse searching Uighur residents around their area and start to kill them.\nMARK COLVIN: We reported last night that there were Han Chinese mobs armed with sticks and clubs and other \nweapons rampaging through the streets.\nNUR MUHAMMAD MAJID: But did you report that they have killed several people?\nMARK COLVIN: No, what do you know about that?\nNUR MUHAMMAD MAJID: Two Uighur young female were beheaded in medical university of Xinjiang and thrown \ntheir bodies were thrown into the street.\nMARK COLVIN: And how sure are you of that because rumours spread very fast in situations like this.\nNUR MUHAMMAD MAJID: Because this news was called from my local resident to our family members in Australia \nand its very in dangerous situation they just call to tell this information to us. Some photos were also put in the \nwebsite of these dead females now.\nMARK COLVIN: What do you fear and what do you hope from the situation now?\nNUR MUHAMMAD MAJID: We fear now that the situation is being worsened because the Chinese state President \nHu Jintao has now returned from Italy and I believe Hu Jintao, the state President, Chinese state President, was the \nTibetan secretary when he cracked down the Tibetan people in 1995.\nThis does not mean to Chinese state leader will bring a peaceful resolution into the Xinjiang region. This is not like a \naccident. This is not an accident. This is a state, well planned accident, well-planned orchestrated you know their \npolicy. They say, \u0153Kill the Uighurs and we dont ask. I have read in the news theyre saying the Chinese were \nshouting, \u0153Kill the Uighurs, and nobody asked. \u0153Kill the Uighurs.\nMARK COLVIN: Thats Nur Muhammad Majid, a Uighur who came here as a refugee from Xinjiang and is now an \nAustralian, speaking on the line from Adelaide.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: heroyalwhyness [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Tension in Urumqi. \u0153Al Qaeda Threatens China\nAn Algerian Islamic group has promised revenge against Chinese companies in North Africa.

Instead witnesses say that the three, \nexiting a mosque and armed with knives, tried to attack the police, who responded with fire. The incident shows the \nheight of tension in the city, after the interethnic clashes last week, and also shows that the police is not seen as the \nguarantor of order, but as an enemy of the Uyghurs.\nThe Chinese media, to defuse the tension, continue to show the great love of people towards soldiers and police.\n\nThe Muslims Uyghur population has suffered decades of political, social and economic exclusion in the region rich \nin oil and gas.

Beijing, to prevent the emergence of Islamic fundamentalism, \nkeeps tight control of the entire religious life of the Uyghurs.

He has denounced the accusations against him as \u0153disinformation, \nmisinformation, lies, rumors.\nHe took the stand for the first time Tuesday after listening in silence to 91 prosecution witnesses, many of them \ndescribing murders, mutilations, tortures and acts of cannibalism by Sierra Leonean rebels. Others who claimed to \nbe former Taylor aides gave accounts of his communications with the rebels and supplying them with weapons, and \nthe transfer of illicit diamonds in return.\nIn 10 hours of testimony over two days, Taylor portrayed himself as a liberator of the Liberian people whose \nintention was to sweep away the corrupt military regime in Monrovia and establish democracy.\nHis lawyer, Courtenay Griffiths, said the former president is enjoying his time on the stand at the Special Court for \nSierra Leone.\n\u0153Hes over the moon, hes buzzing, Griffiths told reporters during a break.\n\nTaylors testimony is expected to take several weeks before prosecutors begin their cross-examination.\nIn his second day of questioning by Griffiths, Taylor described a tumultuous period of coups and executions in \nLiberia, a West African nation buffeted by Cold War politics after a sergeant major in the Liberian army, Samuel \nDoe, seized power in a bloody coup in 1980.\nWaving his hands or pointing his finger, Taylor gave an animated account of his falling out with Doe, his flight to the \nUnited States for safety and his escape via a sheet knotted to a windows bars from a Massachusetts prison where \nhe was being held on an extradition request after the regime accused him of embezzling $900,000.\nTaylor said U.S. authorities helped organize his escape days before a failed 1985 coup by a former close friend, \nGen. Thomas Quiwonkpa, who was later butchered by Doe loyalists.\n\u0153He was cut to pieces and his flesh was eaten by military people, he said.\nTaylor said he was \u0153100 percent positive the CIA bought weapons used by Quiwonkpa and his rebels in a coup \nTaylor supported, even though Washington had earlier pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into Does anti-\ncommunist regime.\nGriffiths told reporters that by 1985, the U.S. government appeared to be embarrassed by the excesses of the Doe \nadministration so that supporting the Quiwonkpa coup and Taylors escape was likely \u0153another route to a bit of \nregime change.\nReturning to Africa via Mexico and Belgium, Taylor began recruiting rebel fighters to stage his own coup in Liberia. \nHe sent them for training in Libya at a sprawling former U.S. military base outside Tripoli where they spent two \nyears.\nThe Libyans \u0153were seriously involved in trying to free the rest of Africa and that is why I think Gadhafi \u201d whether \npeople like it or not \u201d is an African hero, Taylor said, banging his finger hard on his desk.\n\nProsecutors allege that Taylor plotted to terrorize the people of Sierra Leone with rebel leaders at the Libyan \ncamp.

Colombia could also get preferential treatment in \narms and aircraft purchases.\nThe centerpiece of the talks is the Palanquero air base at Puerto Salgar on the Magdalena river 100 kilometers (60 \nmiles) northwest of Bogota.\nThe U.S. interdiction missions it would assume \u201d identifying suspect vessels and planes so Coast Guard and Navy \nships can intercept them and look for drugs \u201d had been flown out of Manta, Ecuador, on the Pacific Ocean.\nAbout 220 Americans shared space at a Mantas international airport but were allowed no more than eight planes at \na time.\nThe E-3 AWACs and P-3 Orion surveillance planes based there were credited with about 60 percent of drug \ninterdiction in the eastern Pacific. But the U.S. mission there is shutting down this week because President Rafael \nCorrea refused to renew its lease, calling their presence a violation of Ecuadors sovereignty.\nPalanquero was off-limits to U.S. military operations until April 2008 after a human rights sanction: A Colombian \nmilitary helicopter operating out of it had killed 17 civilians in the 1998 bombing of a northern town that was initially \ncovered up.\nA bill passed by the U.S. House and pending in the Senate would earmark $46 million for construction at \nPalanquero, which has a 3,500-meter runway and two huge hangars and is home to Colombias main fighter wing.\nThe money would be released 15 days after an agreement is signed, according to a key congressional staffer who \nspoke on condition of anonymity because hes not authorized to comment publicly on such matters.\nThe U.S. Embassy declined to comment about the talks, as did Colombias acting defense minister, Gen. Freddy \nPadilla. \u0153Nothing is agreed upon until everything is agreed upon, told the AP.\nAsked recently about the talks, U.S. Ambassador William Brownfield stressed that Washington would not be \nacquiring bases but rather obtaining increased access to Colombian facilities.\nU.S. Southern Command spokesman Robert Appin said the Pentagon would have no immediate comment.\nHowever, one indication of the Pentagons goals can be found in a U.S. Air Mobility Command document \u0153Global \nEn Route Strategy that was presented in early April at a symposium at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. Beyond \ncounternarcotics, Palanquero could become a \u0153cooperative security location from which \u0153mobility operations \ncould be executed the document proposes.\nA potential jumping-off point for operations by expeditionary forces, in other words.\n\u0153Nearly half the continent can be covered by a C-17 (military transport) without refueling from Palanquero, the \ndocument says.\nRafael Pardo, a former defense minister and candidate for president in May 2010 elections, has complained of \nsecrecy surrounding the negotiations, and worries about alienating other South American nations. The radar and \ncommunications intercept ability of U.S. aircraft can extend well beyond Colombias borders.\n\u0153If its to launch surveillance flights over other nations then it seems to me that would be needless hostility by \nColombia against its neighbors, Pardo said, although one of the Colombian officials said the agreement will specify \nthat U.S. flights wont cross Colombias borders without permission from affected countries.\nIt is not clear what other restrictions would be placed under a new bases agreement on U.S. military aircraft, \nwarships or troops. Putting more Americans on the ground would raise the risk of casualties, although Colombias \nleftist rebels \u201d chiefly funded through cocaine trafficking \u201d have no record of attacking Americans in the country.\nAbout 600 U.S. service personnel and civilian contractors already work in Colombia, according to the most recent \nfigures available. Advisers are attached to Colombian army divisions, have their own offices at armed forces \nheadquarters and have trained thousands of Colombian troops since 2000.\nUnder U.S. law, the number of Department of Defense employees in Colombia cannot exceed 800 while the \nnumber of military contractors cannot top 600.\nThat number would not change under the draft accord, the senior Colombian officials said. Nor, they said, would \nU.S. troops lose their immunity from criminal prosecution.\n\n\n\nWhile drug interdiction is the chief U.S. goal, some worry that bringing in more Americans will lead to the U.S. \ntaking sides in a conflict involving Colombias military, rebels and private militias over land and cocaine that has led \nto hundreds of extra-judicial killings of civilians over the years.\nThe U.S. could be pushing Colombia to negotiate a solution with the leftist rebels, said John Lindsay-Poland of the \nU.S.-based Fellowship of Reconciliation. Instead, \u0153this is an indicator that the United States is going to be \nsupporting a military approach.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: heroyalwhyness [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Zelaya Issues Ultimatum: \u02dcReinstate Me or Else\nNegotiations to end Honduras political crisis faced a new challenge after the ousted president vowed to act on his \nown if he is not returned to power in the next round of talks, possibly this weekend.\nManuel Zelaya, who was toppled by a military-backed coup and flown out of the country in his night clothes on June \n28, was clearly frustrated by the slow movement of negotiations mediated by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, \nwhich have produced no breakthrough after two rounds.\n\u0153We are giving the coup regime an ultimatum, Zelaya said Monday at a news conference in Nicaragua, where he \narrived Sunday night following a brief trip to Washington.\nIf at the next round of talks the interim government does not agree to reinstate him, \u0153the mediation effort will be \nconsidered failed and other measures will be taken, he said.

Imposition \nof visas for all Canadian citizens would need to be agreed in co-operation with other EU states.\nBut the Czech government has also officially requested the European Commission to invoke the blocs solidarity \nprocedure which could theoretically result in a decision by all 27 EU member states to introduce visa to Canada.\n\u0153Im curious to know how the other EU member states will react, Czech prime minister Jan Fischer told reporters in \nStrasbourg on Tuesday, after meeting commission president Jose Manuel Barroso to discuss the matter.\nThe Czech leader said Mr Barroso had already spoken to Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper and promised \nhe would try hard to help Prague to achieve the lifting of the visa requirements from Czechs.\n\u0153We expect the measures introduced by Canada to be temporary, and we hope that full visa-free travel between \nthe EU and Canada is re-established soon, the commission spokesman Michele Cercone told journalists in \nBrussels.\nThe EU executive will reply to Pragues official request within three months and submit a report assessing the \ndemand for reciprocity to the council, representing member states.

They would be wrong. Trafficking is not some theoretical \n\nhttp://euobserver.com/9/28458\nhttp://www.arabnews.com/?page=7&section=0&article=124585&d=15&m=7&y=2009\n\n\nactivity. It is a real issue \u201d and a real problem. There is a number of foreigners whose presence in the Kingdom, \nwhether legal or illegal, was organized by unscrupulous characters who trade in human misery.\n\nThe new law is deliberately wide in its interpretation of trafficking, and rightly so. Most people consider human \ntrafficking as the organized movement, often the smuggling of illegal immigrants from one country to another \u201d \nKurds into the UK, for example, or Afghans to Australia; or shipping prostitutes, willing or unwilling, from East to \nWest Europe. It can be that; there are organized rackets bringing beggars to the Kingdom, especially during \nRamadan and the Haj season. But in this case, it is more complex.\n\nIt is not so much a question of people being brought to the Kingdom against their will as people being brought \nunder false pretences and then kept against their will, maltreated, underpaid (if not unpaid), forced to work all hours \nor perform under conditions that amount, in extreme cases, to nothing less than slavery.\nThe problem starts because of Saudi Arabias reputation as a land with streets paved with gold \u201d black gold. People \nimagine in poor countries that prosperity awaits them here. They make easy prey for unscrupulous traffickers.\n\nTake, for example, the poor young man in Bangladesh with no hope of a job or the widow in Indonesia with two \nchildren to look after. First, they are deceived by a local agent who tells them that there is a job available in Saudi \nArabia paying $1,000 or more a month. Having signed up, they arrive full of expectations \u201d only to be told that they \nare going to get $100 a month or less and that there is nothing that they can do about it. Or maybe they are not paid \nat all. In some cases, maids are kept imprisoned in their employers homes, subject to sexual abuse from the men \nof the house and violence from them and the women.\n\nIt is not a widespread problem, but even one case would be one too many, and it is certainly more than that.\n\nLike the organizers of the begging rackets, those who lie to people about salaries and the work description, those \nhere who are part of the immigrant labor chain and complicit in those lies, and those employers at the end of the \nchain who refuse to pay the agreed wage or who treat their staff badly; all need to be tracked down and punished.\n\nBut this is not the most important part of this initiative. There is no shortage of existing laws on human trafficking, \nkeeping people in bondage or sexually abusing them. The courts are usually very good at delivering justice when \ncases are lodged with them. It is about ensuring that those breaking the law are rapidly brought to court. That is \nwhere the main effort has to be. A few well publicized stiff sentences would do wonders in bringing the problem to a \nswift end.\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: heroyalwhyness [|Return to headlines]\n\n           EU Lifting Visa Requirements for Some Balkan Nations\nEU Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Jacques Barrot talks to the media during a press conference at the EU \nCommission headquarters in Brussels.\nThe European Union proposed visa-free travel for citizens of Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia, thus extending \nsome benefits of its common market to the Balkans.\nThe no-visa rule would apply to a passport-free travel zone that embraces 22 EU countries plus Switzerland, \nNorway and Iceland. That free-travel zone excludes the U.K., Ireland, Romania, Bulgaria and Cyprus. While the \nscrapping of the restrictions will prompt a \u0153considerable increase in travel from the Balkans, the EU has not put a \nnumber on it, EU Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Jacques Barrot told a press conference.\nBut, \u0153there are no current plans to loosen visa restrictions on citizens of Turkey, said Barrot, Bloomberg reported.\nEU officials said the move would end a requirement that has made it nearly impossible for citizens of the three \nnations to travel freely to the rest of Europe for nearly two decades.\n\nThe proposal still needs the backing of all 27 EU member states, which could come in October, paving the way for \nvisa requirements to be dropped Jan. 1, Barrot said.\n\u0153This is a historic moment in our relations with countries of the western Balkans, Barrot told reporters. \u0153This will \nallow for far closer and more frequent relations between citizens of those three countries and the European Union.\n\nhttp://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=eu-lifting-visa-requirements-for-3-balkan-nations-2009-07-15\n\n\nBarrot said that while Macedonia had fulfilled all the EUs conditions, Serbia and Montenegro still had to carry out \nmeasures to enhance their management of borders, migration policies, and their fights against organized crime.\nMacedonia has been a candidate for EU membership since 2005, but has still not received a date for opening entry \ntalks due to a name dispute with neighboring Greece. Montenegro and Serbia are also seeking membership, but \nthe latter has been blocked by a Dutch requirement that it capture its last two war-crimes suspects.\nEU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said that while the Netherlands continues to block pre-membership trade \nties with Serbia, the government is \u0153fully supportive of lifting travel restrictions.\nThe EU Commission stopped short of recommending that citizens of two other Balkan nations, Albania and Bosnia \nand Herzegovina, also be allowed visa-free travel because they still lack enhanced passports containing microchips \nwith biometrics data.\nEuropes newest nation, Kosovo, has not yet been included in the visa liberalization program due to security \nconcerns, EU officials said, according to a report by The Associated Press.\n\u0153It is our common goal that Albania and Bosnia could follow their neighbors soon, if the authorities in these two \ncountries put their full weight behind this effort, Rehn said.\nIn Belgrade, Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic called the commissions comments \u0153great news.

Since \nthen, the discourse has been based on the compatibility of the new German regulation with the European Court of \nJustice, or ECJs, Soysal l ruling in February that declares the visa requirement for Turkish service providers is in \nbreach of both community law and the EC-Turkey Partnership law.\n\nhttp://www.ansamed.info/en/news/ME01.@AM44641.html\nhttp://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=germanys-visa-exemption-a-test-of-the-eus-sincerity-2009-07-13\n\n\nSince the 1990s, the ECJ has played a key role in improving EC-Turkey Partnership law through determining the \nlegal nature of the Ankara Agreement (1963), Additional Protocol (1970), Associate Council Decisions (No 2/76, \n1/80, 3/80) and the legal status of Turkish nationals in Europe. Following the failure of the Associate Council to \nintroduce a concrete timetable for abolishing restrictions on freedom of establishment and to provide services \nbetween contracting parties, the ECJ began to look at individual cases brought by Turkish nationals who have \nclaimed that EU countries foreigners laws are in breach of Turkey-EU Partnership Law and hinder them from \nefficiently establishing themselves in EU countries or providing services. At that point, Article 41/1 of the Additional \nProtocol, which was signed on Nov. 23, 1970, constituted the main legal basis of the applications. According to \nArticle 41/1, \u0153The Contracting Parties shall refrain from introducing between themselves any new restrictions on \nthe freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services. The European Court of Justice confirmed for the \nfirst time in its Savas ruling that this provision has a direct effect since it provides clearly, precisely and \nunconditionally an unequivocal standstill clause that envisages certain obligations on contracting parties not to act. \nThus, Turkish nationals were permitted to rely on Article 41/1 before the national courts of EU member states. \nHowever, the court stated that Article 41/1 is not in itself capable of conferring on Turkish nationals a right to enter \nEU countries and reside there unlawfully. This provision only envisages a general prohibition for contracting parties \nnot to introduce any new stricter conditions than those that are applied to citizens of the parties at the time when the \nAdditional Protocol entered into force.\nTurkish nationals long-lasting legal struggle for visa exemption finally yielded results in the ECJs Soysal ruling and \nthe ensuing diplomatic openings placed considerable pressure on the German government to introduce a \u0153more \nfavorable treatment for Turkish nationals. Before examining the new German regulation in detail, it is important to \nput forward the most striking points of the Soysal ruling. In the main proceedings, the ECJ examined for the first \ntime, the legality of visa requirements within the context of entrance conditions for Turkish nationals.. The court \nonce more confirmed the direct effect of Article 41/1 of the Additional Protocol and stated that this provision \nprecludes the introduction, as from the entry into force of Additional Protocol, of a requirement that Turkish \nnationals must have a visa to enter a member state since on that date, such a visa was not required.\nAlthough the ECJ didnt clarify the scope of the \u0153freedom to provide services, it should be interpreted widely and in \nline with the Community law and the ECJs well-established jurisprudence. In other words, the courts decision \nshould include both \u0153freedom to provide services and \u0153freedom to receive services. Moreover, Article 14 of the \nAnkara Agreement states, \u0153The Contracting Parties agree to be guided by Articles 55, 56 and 58 to 65 of the \nTreaty establishing the Community for the purpose of abolishing restrictions on freedom to provide services \nbetween them. In this context, besides Turkish service providers, Turkish service receivers such as students, \npatients and tourists must benefit from this right. However, as will be emphasized in the forthcoming paragraphs, \nthe German government preferred to interpret the freedom in a narrow sense and introduced visa exemption only to \nTurkish service providers who belong to specific professional groups.\nThe ECJs interpretation on the legality of the visa requirement paved the way for the adoption of the new German \nvisa regulation. Last month, the German Embassy in Ankara announced that hereafter, Turkish service providers \nwho belong to the enlisted professional groups in the decision could freely travel to Germany by providing a visa \nexemption document from German consulates. However, it has to be noted that the regulation introduces a different \nvisa procedure under the name of \u0153visa exemption instead of a new system that guarantees the legal gains of \nTurkish nationals.\nUnder the new decision, some specific professional groups are enlisted and two pre-conditions are required: 1) \nThose Turkish nationals should preserve their usual place of residence in Turkey. 2) The maximum duration of stay \nin Germany with the aim to provide services should not exceed two months. In this context, Turkish nationals who \nbelong to the professional groups specified below are exempt from obtaining a visa to travel:\n1) Those who are employed by a Turkish company established in Turkey and who travel to Germany with the aim to \nprovide services for a temporary period: a) driver personnel and ship/plane crew members engaged in the \ninternational transportation of goods and passengers, b) maintenance workers.\n2) Those who will travel with the aim to carry out activities of a commercial character: a) Those who will make a \npresentation or performance that is of great artistic value (internationally recognized artists or groups of artists \nwhose performances are distinguished from their counterparts.) b) Those who will make a presentation that is of \ngreat scientific value or, c) Those professional sportsmen who predominantly earn their living from this profession.\nAs is seen, the right to enter Germany without being subject to visa requirement is only granted to a very limited \ngroup of people. Contrary to the ECJs well-established jurisprudence, the freedom to provide services is interpreted \n\n\n\nin a narrow sense and does not include service receivers. Another noteworthy point is that the new regulation \nprescribes a condition requiring the commercial activity to have a \u0153special value. However, the regulation does not \nmention a competent authority that will evaluate this very subjective condition. According to my opinion, the main \ngoal is to ensure the implementation of the visa exemption is as limited as possible, which is definitely in violation of \nEC-Turkey Partnership Law.\nAnother critique that can be directed to the German regulation is that it requires a bunch of official documents to \nobtain a visa exemption document and this method inevitably reminds of the regular visa system. Especially, those \nrequested documents revealing the type and amount of the remuneration earned, raises question marks over the \nsincerity of the new regulation.. Moreover, Turkish nationals are \u0153kindly asked to apply for a visa exemption \ndocument 10 days before they travel, which is probably going to lead to difficulties in future implementation.\nHowever, one must not forget that this non-legally binding document does not provide absolute protection for \nTurkish service providers since German border authorities reserve the right to reconsider whether those Turkish \nnationals meet the exemption criteria. This option strengthens the arbitrariness of the future implementation. Lastly, \nthe German government states that the visa exemption regulation, \u0153which introduces a more favorable treatment \nfor Turkish nationals, is only valid for travel to Germany. In other words, Turkish nationals cannot rely on the \nGerman regulation while traveling to the other Schengen countries. However, this approach constitutes an apparent \nviolation of the ECJs Soysal ruling since the courts decision is not only binding over German visa requirements. \nFirstly, the nine states that had been admitted to the Community by Jan. 1, 1973, (the date on which the Additional \nProtocol entered into force) did not have a visa requirement for Turkish nationals at that time and consequently the \nstandstill clause embedded in Article 41/1 became binding for those countries. However, there are contradicting \nviews regarding the situation of EU countries that became members after Jan. 1, 1973. According to the dominant \nview, the standstill clause goes into effect for those countries on the date of their accession to the EC/EU. \nAccordingly, if those countries had a visa requirement for Turkish nationals on the date of their accession, then the \napplication would continue.\nTaking into consideration the main idea behind European integration \u201d to create an Internal Market without borders \u201d \ndifferentiation between member states regarding visa exemption for Turkish nationals probably will make \nimplementation impossible. Yet, this complexity should not abandon the responsibility of member states to act in \naccordance with their loyalty obligation embedded in Article 10 of the EC Treaty. Accordingly, they should \nundertake the necessary amendments in their national laws. Since the Ankara Agreement envisages certain \nobligations for both the European Community and member states, the EU Commission should also act in \naccordance with its responsibilities through introducing a comprehensive and just solution to this long-lasting \nproblem. The Commission firstly has to adopt a common stance in line with the ECJs ruling and prepare a draft \nproposal that includes the necessary amendments in Council Regulation no 539/2001 on Schengen Visa.\n\nTo sum up, the ECJs Soysal ruling constitutes one of the milestone decisions in terms of its consequences, \nespecially the confirmation of the illegality of the visa requirement that Turkish nationals have been subjected to for \na very long time. Hereafter, the legal process has to be accompanied by a political dialogue respecting the equality \nof the parties. A comprehensive solution taking into consideration the concerns and rights of both parties must be \nthe main goal. Turkey, as a negotiating country with the European Union, should be treated on an equal footing with \nmember states already admitted to the Union and have gone through the same EU process. As in the case of \nBulgaria and Romania, Turkey should be presented a road map on visa liberalization that is in conformity with \nTurkish nationals granted legal rights. It is an undeniable fact that easy traveling conditions will increase mutual \nunderstanding between the parties and ease the full integration of Turkey into the EU.\n(Ceren Mutu??? is a researcher at the Center for European Studies International Strategic Research Organization, \nor USAK.)\n\n           \u201d Hat tip: heroyalwhyness [|Return to headlines]\n\n           Patra Immigrant Camp Cleared Out\n\nA migrant scales the wall of an unfinished building to escape a fire that broke out yesterday at a camp \naccommodating illegal immigrants next to the port of Patras.
