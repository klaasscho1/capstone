{"title": "California: Promise To Speed Naturalization Applications", "body": "\nImmigration authorities have agreed to complete 90 percent of naturalization applications from immigrants in \nSouthern California within six months, in a lawsuit settlement that was approved by a federal judge in Santa Ana. \nThe suit was filed in 2007 by the National Immigration Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union, on behalf \nof immigrants seeking to become citizens whose applications had stalled for years because of delays with \nbackground checks. As a result of the suit, the court required the F.B.I. and Citizenship and Immigration Services to \nreport regularly on their progress in reducing backlogs nationwide. Linton Joaquin, general counsel for the law \ncenter, said the agencies had significantly reduced the backlogs, with about 400 cases remaining in the Los \nAngeles area covered by the settlement. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
