The last outbreak of blue flu hit the country on May 1, but gardai kept \na lid on the situation by drafting in trainees and senior officers.\n\n There was no major increase in the crime rate on the day, but armed gardai foiled a terrorist cash heist in Wicklow \nand shot dead Dubliner Ronan MacLochlainn.\n\n Commissioner Conroy vowed last night that criminals would not enjoy a free-for -all this time out either.\n\n Last night the Garda chief was in crisis meetings with senior officers to draw up a plan of action to deal with the \nlatest blue flu day.\n\n There will be 800 probationary gardai as well as trainees available to police the country.\n"}
