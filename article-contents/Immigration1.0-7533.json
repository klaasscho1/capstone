{"title": "READER RESPONSES: LATINO WORKERS; Immigrants being exploited", "body": "\nIn \"The big wink\" (Page One, Jan. 23), one builder claims Latinos \"will do for $ 7 an hour what I can't get white guys \nto do for $ 12.\" In other words, the labor is worth at least $ 12, but he has found an exploitable \nalternative.AJCAnother claims the price of a house would jump without undocumented workers.\n\nHouse prices are dictated by the market. Any savings in labor goes directly to the builder, not to the buyer. Most of \nthe workers featured are just here to make a quick buck. Unlike other immigrant groups, most have no interest in \npursuing the American dream of citizenship, home ownership and financial independence. Which is just that --- a \ndream --- for those willing to sell $ 12 worth of labor for $ 7.\n\nSTEPHEN KILBRIDE\n\nKilbride, a pastry chef, lives in Atlanta.\n"}
