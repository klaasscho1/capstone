{"title": "Blog; Political Insider; Immigration as an '08 issue: Tancredo for president?", "body": "\nThursday, November 30, 2006, 02:20 PM\n\nJust chatted an hour or so ago with Steve Scheffler, president of the Iowa Christian Alliance. He said he's come \nacross feelers that U.S. Rep. Tom Tancredo, the Colorado Republican, has put out for a presidential run.\n\nA Tancredo candidacy could test the continued strength of immigration as a key to the Republican base. The \nColorado congressman has made a cottage industry of criticizing U.S. immigration policy. Most recently, he ticked \noff Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, the president's brother, for referring to Miami as \"a Third World country.\"\n"}
