{"title": "BRILLIANT IMMIGRANT'S CASE BUMPED TO TOP OF LIST", "body": "\nAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT who became a brilliant Ivy Leaguer after growing up in New York homeless shelters \nhas had his case pushed to the top of the immigration authority.\n\nBut Dan-El Padilla Peralta's outstanding academic achievements will play no part in decisions on his future status, \nhis lawyer Stephen Yale-Loehr said yesterday.\n\nPadilla, 21, who came to the U.S. from the Dominican Republic 17 years ago, graduated second in his class at \nPrinceton this week and won a scholarship to England's prestigious Oxford University.\n\nBut the classics scholar declared his secret status after discovering he could be barred from returning to the U.S. if \nhe took his Oxford place.\n\n\"Because of the publicity this case has generated, [his application] has been bumped to the Citizenship and \nImmigration Services' headquarters in Washington,\" Yale-Loehr said.\n\n\"But his intellectual achievements will not be a part of the consideration. The fact that he's smart or dumb, or black \nor white, cannot be considered as a matter of law.\"\n\nInstead, Padilla has to prove that extraordinary factors stopped him from applying for legal status when his tourist \nvisa expired 17 years ago.\n\nPadilla was brought to New York by his parents after his pregnant mother traveled for medical attention. \nComplications meant they overstayed their tourist visa.\n\n\"He was 4 years old, they were living in homeless shelters, his father abandoned them and they lost their \nimmigration paperwork in a flood,\" said his lawyer.\n\nanichols@nydailynews.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\n\nBLOOMBERG NEWS Dan-El Padilla Peralta\n"}
