{"title": "11.2 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN U.S. LAST YEAR, REPORT SAYS", "body": "\nAbout 11.2 million illegal immigrants were living in the United States in 2010, a number essentially unchanged \nfrom the previous year, according to a report published Tuesday by the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan \nresearch organization in Washington.\n\nDespite continuing high unemployment among American workers, record deportations by the Obama administration \nand expanding efforts by states to crack down, the number of unauthorized immigrants in the work force -- about 8 \nmillion -- was also unchanged, the Pew report found. Those workers were about 5 percent of the U.S. work force.\n\nThe population of illegal immigrants leveled off after peaking in 2007 at 12 million, then dropping sharply over two \nyears to 11.1 million in 2009, according to the report, which is based on census data. The declines occurred \nprimarily because fewer people from Mexico and Central America came illegally to the U.S., Pew concluded.\n\nThe report found no evidence of an exodus of illegal immigrants from the country. In particular, there is no sign \nthat Mexicans, the largest group -- 58 percent -- of illegal immigrants, are leaving in larger numbers, the report \nfinds.\n\nThe Pew report suggests that the high numbers of unauthorized immigrants are confounding enforcement efforts \nby the Obama administration and also a recent spate of measures by state legislatures to crack down locally.\n"}
