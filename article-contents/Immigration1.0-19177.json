{"title": "Metro Briefing  New York: Brooklyn: Charges In Money-Smuggling Scheme", "body": "\nTwo lawyers, an 81-year-old mortgage banker and several Yemeni men were arraigned in federal court in \nBrooklyn yesterday on charges that they ran an unlicensed money transferring business that smuggled more than \n$5 million to Yemen. One of the lawyers, Neil S. Kramer, 58, and four of the Yemeni men were also charged in a \nloan sharking scheme that prosecutors said preyed on Yemeni immigrants, making loans ranging from $5,000 to \n$100,000. The borrowers were required to sign judgment papers with the amount, terms and due date of the loan \nleft blank and, in some cases, to surrender leases to their businesses, as well as green cards and passports until \nthe debts were paid. All of the defendants pleaded not guilty before United States Magistrate Judge Joan M. Azrack \nand all but one, Hamood Zokari, 53, were freed on bond. The arrests were the result of a three-year investigation by \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement agents.    WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM (NYT)\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
