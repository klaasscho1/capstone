{"title": "In McCarthy Era, TV Networks Cowered;McCarranism", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nAs Congress finally gets around to eliminating some of the last vestiges of the McCarthy era by repealing the anti-\nCommunist provisions of the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act (\"Landmark Accord Promises to Ease Immigration Curbs,\" \nfront page, Oct. 26), it is a shame that you are rewriting the history of the period.\n\nSenator Joseph R. McCarthy gave his name to the anti-Communist furor of the 1950's, but he bore little \nresponsibility for most of the actual repression. He did not, as you state, lead the fight to keep out undesirable \naliens. Nevada's powerful Democratic Senator Pat McCarran did.\n\nBut blaming individuals for the excesses of McCarthyism distorts reality. Most American politicians supported these \nmeasures. Only 10 senators voted to sustain President Harry S. Truman's veto of the 1950 Internal Security Act, \nwhich contained the immigration restrictions incorporated in the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act.\n\nIt was the misguided, but widely shared, conviction that the country's security required the restriction of individual \nrights that led to the excesses of the McCarthy era.\n\nSuch concerns still threaten our freedom. Since the Federal Government tends to invoke national security to justify \nincursions against individual rights, that the conference immigration bill allows the Secretary of State to bar aliens \n\"under exceptional circumstances\" is hardly reassuring.\n\n \n\nELLEN W.
