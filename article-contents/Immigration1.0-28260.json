{"title": "GRINCH THAT STOLE AMERICAN DREAM. Fed named Christmas in bribe rap", "body": "\nSANTA CLAUS WON'T be stopping at Melford Christmas' house this year.\n\nThe naughty federal immigration officer was busted yesterday for shaking down at least four victims who were \napplying for citizenship, authorities said.\n\nChristmas, 41, worked in the Garden City, L.I., immigration office, where he interviewed permanent residents \nseeking to become naturalized citizens - testing them for English proficiency and on American history and civics.\n\nThe criminal complaint filed in Long Island Federal Court alleges that Christmas demanded bribes ranging from \n$500 to $3,000 to approve their applications.\n\nIn one case, an applicant had failed the English and American history exams and returned to Christmas' office on \nJuly 24, 2007, for a makeup test.\n\nAfter reading two sentences written by the applicant, Christmas agreed to pass him in exchange for $800, \naccording to the complaint.\n\nAnother time, Christmas allegedly learned an applicant had $3,000 in the bank and told him that although it was \n\"not much money, he would still try to help\" - for $2,750.\n\nBribe money did not change hands in the government office. Christmas allegedly made plans to meet the \napplicants near their homes after work.\n\n\"The defendant allegedly exploited the immigrant quest for citizenship to line his pockets,\" said Joseph Demarest, \nassistant director of the FBI's New York office.\n\n\"In doing so, he corrupted the process and betrayed a position of trust.\"\n\nIf convicted, Christmas' own civic lesson in the criminal justice system could result in 15 years in prison and a \n$250,000 fine.\n\nChristmas, of Woodhaven, Queens, was released on $100,000 bail.\n\njmarzulli@nydailynews.com\n\n"}
