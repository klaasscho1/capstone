{"title": "MORE ALIENS DEPORTED FOR CRIMES", "body": "\nDeportations of illegal aliens convicted of serious crimes are expected to reach 30,000 this fiscal year, 5 percent \nmore than projected, immigration officials report.\n\nMore aggressive enforcement enabled the Immigration and Naturalization Service to send 8,134 convicted aliens \nhome in April, May and June, an increase of more than 10 percent over the previous quarter.\n\nNew rules mandated by last year's anti-crime law could push those numbers up even higher, said Alexander \nAleinikoff, the INS executive associate commissioner of programs. \"We believe this is the beginning of a trend \nwhich will result in the doubling of the number of criminal aliens removed next year. A criminal conviction means jail \ntime and a one-way ticket home.\"\n\nINS had expected to deport 28,579 convicted aliens this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.\n\nRules that went into effect Thursday created \"administrative deportation,\" a new and faster way to deport aliens \nconvicted of aggravated felonies such as murder, armed robbery and narcotics violations, the INS said.\n\nThe aliens now can be deported without a hearing before an immigration judge, if they are not permanent U.S. \nresidents and don't qualify for any program that would allow them to stay in the United States.\n\nThe INS didn't release figures on how many aliens are incarcerated, but said federal prisons house about 29,000 \nforeign-born inmates; about 72, 000 are being held in state prisons.\n\nNot all are illegal aliens, INS spokesman Greg Gagne said.\n"}
