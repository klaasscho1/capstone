{"title": "OUR OPINIONS: No shortcut to driver's license", "body": "\nNeed a new driver's license? Want a license that can never be suspended or revoked? Want an ID for nightclubs \nor hotel check-in?\n\nDream on.\nAJC\n\nThe offer of such an international driver's license --- most often seen in unsolicited e-mail --- is a scam as well as a \nspam. But its appeal has grown for two reasons: Sept. 11, when millions of undocumented immigrants watched \ntheir hopes for gaining legal status set back by terrorism, and tougher driving legislation.\n\nDesperate for some kind of official identification or driver's license, many immigrants are naive and desperate \nenough to pay $100 or more to companies with impressive titles such as the Institute for International Licensing, \nthe International Licensing Bureau and the University Degree Program.\n\nThe offers aren't limited to the Internet, said Ramon Moreno, director of protection services at the Mexican \nConsulate in Atlanta. He's seen businesses on Buford Highway offering \"driver's licenses\" for $100; an ID is $30.\n\nValid international driver's licenses do exist, but they have to be obtained in your country of origin, and are valid \nonly abroad. Mexican immigrants, for example, would have to acquire the license in Mexico for it to be valid here.\n\nLikewise, an official international driver's license issued in the United States is valid only abroad, and only when \nproduced in conjunction with a valid driver's license from this country. Any person who produces a valid driver's \nlicense from a U.S. state can obtain an international driver's license from the American Automobile Association --- \nfor 10 bucks.\n\n\"Avoid tickets, fines and mandatory driver's education,\" the e-mail urges. \"Protect your privacy, and hide your \nidentity.\" And while you're at it, cure cancer and win the lottery, too.\n"}
