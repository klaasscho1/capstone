{"title": "Fighting Terrorism Fairly", "body": "\nAfter some hesitation, the federal government seems to be moving to end abusive practices in its handling of \nimmigrants suspected of terrorism. The reforms, prompted by a blistering report from the Justice Department's \ninspector general, are a welcome improvement. \n\nBut they will need the support of Attorney General John Ashcroft, who has shown little remorse about his \ndepartment's mishandling of immigrants. \n\n     The inspector general's report found \"significant problems\" in the post-Sept. 11 roundup of suspected terrorists. \nMany detainees were classified as terrorism suspects on scant evidence. There was a \"pattern of physical and \nverbal abuse.\" And detainees were denied access to lawyers. Responding to the report, the Justice Department \nsaid it made \"no apologies\" for how it went about protecting the American public. While asking Congress for new \nterrorism-fighting powers, Mr. Ashcroft used similar language. \n\n By adopting the new policies, the government is at least implicitly admitting that mistakes were made. The new \nguidelines, based on 12 recommendations in the inspector general's report, include clearer standards for deciding \nwhen a detained immigrant should be considered a terrorism suspect, and improvements in conditions of \nconfinement.\n\nIf these reforms are going to work, they cannot be mere words in a rule book. Mr. Ashcroft should embrace them \npublicly, and explain to law enforcement why they are necessary. It does not detract from the war on terrorism for \nthe government to admit when it has gone too far. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
