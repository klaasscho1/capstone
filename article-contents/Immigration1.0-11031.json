{"title": "TUNISIAN FLIGHT STUDENTS ARE KICKED OUT OF U.S.;NO CONNECTION WITH SEPT. 11 ATTACKS SEEN", "body": "\nWASHINGTON -- Three Tunisians attending flight schools in Florida, including a student who acknowledged \nknowing a roommate of terrorist hijacker Mohamed Atta's, were ordered deported last week.\n\nNone of the students were accused of being connected to the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nThe FBI noted in a letter, however, that Maryem Bedoui, 21, had attended flight schools in Venice and Punta \nGorda about the same time that hijackers Atta and Marwan Al-Shehhi, had trained at a nearby flight school.\n\nDuring a deportation hearing Thursday on immigration violations in Bradenton, Fla., Bedoui told Immigration Judge \nR. Kevin McHugh that she was friends with one of Atta's roommates, but she denied knowing Atta.\n\nThe immigration judge ordered Mohamed Kharbech and Nabil Ferchichi, both of whom had been in the United \nStates about a year, to leave by the end of the month. Bedoui also was ordered deported once a shoplifting charge \nagainst her is resolved.\n\n\"In ordinary times this may not be such a big thing,\" the judge said during the deportation hearing. \"But these are \nnot ordinary times.\"\n\nAll three said they were the victims of flight schools that misinformed them of immigration rules and took tens of \nthousands of dollars without providing training.\n\nIn Virginia, an attorney said his Saudi client who was arrested the night of Sept. 11 near Dulles Airport, where one \nof the hijackers' flights originated, will plead guilty to a criminal charge that has nothing to do with the terrorist \nattacks.\n\nThe government is dropping a second charge and Khalid al-Draibi would spend only a few months in jail under \nfederal sentencing guidelines after he pleads guilty Monday in Alexandria, Va., said attorney Drew Hutcheson Jr.\n\nAl-Draibi passed two FBI polygraph examinations in which he denied any links to terrorists and denied knowing \nanything about the Sept. 11 attacks, said Hutcheson.\n\nPolice pulled him over for driving on a bare wheel rim 13 miles south of Dulles, where American Airlines Flight 77 \nthat crashed into the Pentagon had taken off from earlier in the day. Flight manuals were found in al-Draibi's car, \nand he carried driver's licenses from eight states. Hutcheson said the plea will be to a charge of making a false \nstatement on a visa application. Al-Draibi has been in custody since Sept. 11.\n"}
