Time the EU had a serious proposal \nfrom the UK Govt if a \u00a3 Brexit deal is to be achievable in October. NI and IRE deserves better!\" \n\n Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer tweeted: \"If Boris Johnson had spent any time listening to \nbusinesses and communities in Northern Ireland, he would know that these proposals are utterly unworkable.\" \n\nOpposition political parties across the Irish Sea also criticised the reported plans.\n\nLisa Chambers, the Fianna Fail Brexit spokeswoman tweeted: \"This is effectively a border with a buffer zone and is \nclearly not a satisfactory alternative to the backstop.\n\n\"With 30 days now to go until Brexit we need to see sensible workable solutions that ensure no hard border on the \nisland of Ireland. What about regulations on goods\"\n\n\"For all the U.K. governments talk that they wouldn't erect a border on the island of Ireland, here they are \nproposing a border as a solution to their \u00a3Brexit paralysis,\" she tweeted.\n\nSinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald tweeted: \"It is further evidence of Tory recklessness and belligerence \ntowards Ireland.\"\n\n Irish Labour Party Leader Brendan Howlin also dismissed the plans. \n\nHe tweeted: \"Leaked proposals from the UK on alternatives to the backstop are completely unacceptable. The UK \nis well aware that a mass of new border checks, wherever sited, breach the agreement reached with the May \ngovernment to avoid regulatory barriers to trade.\"\n\nSDLP Leader Colum Eastwood said the reported proposals fall short of fulfilling the objective of the backstop.\n\n\"The content of these proposals fails to meet the British Government's obligations under the December 2017 joint \nreport to avoid physical infrastructure, checks and controls at the border. It doesn't matter if it's a mile, five miles or \nten miles away, the presence of physical checks will create economic and security challenges that are \nunacceptable,\" he said.\n\nSeparately, the Irish Farmer's Association President Joe Healy said the reported proposal by the UK to install \ncustom clearance centres' at both sides of the border is not a credible alternative to the backstop.\n\n\"These customs clearance centres' are border posts under a different name. The purpose of the backstop is to act \nas a fallback in the event that a future trade deal cannot address the NI Border issue to the UK and EU's \n\n\n\nsatisfaction. This latest proposal is an attempt to put lipstick on a pig. A customs post is a customs post, no matter \nwhat is called or where it's located,\" he said.\n\nThe Tory Justice Secretary also played down the leaked plans.\n\nRobert Buckland told Sky News: \"They're very much preliminary documents.\n\n\"And when it comes to the Irish border they only cover a part of the settlement of that border.\n\n\"I don't think that by any means this is the be all and end all of what I hope will be detailed negotiations over the \nnext couple of weeks. \n\n\"I hear what the Irish have had to say about it and quite clearly there is work to be done.\n\n\"But let's not pretend these documents are a final piece in the jigsaw.\n\n\"I very much hope the negotiations will be conducted away from the gaze of the cameras.\" \n"}
