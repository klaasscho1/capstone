{"title": "Snows Claim Another Life Along Border With Mexico", "body": "\nA 10th body has been found in a mountainous area of the Mexican border east of San Diego where more than a \nhundred immigrants, who had been working their way north on foot through deep canyons, became trapped by a \nspring snow storm.\n\nThe victim, a man, was found at dusk on Friday on the United States side of the border by a team that had been \ntrying to save the immigrants since their predicament became known late Thursday night. The body was in the \nsame general area where other bodies had been discovered earlier in the day, said Mario Villarreal, a spokesman \nfor the United States Border Patrol. He said search crews reported knee-deep snow in the area.\n\nEight of the bodies were found in the United States and two by the Mexican authorities on their side of the border. \nAbout 50 people were rescued on the American side and 80 in Mexico.\n\nThough the search was called off as darkness approached on Friday, one search party did not arrive back at the \ncommand post until 3 A.M. today, an officer said. The formal search for victims has ended, but routine patrols by \nthe Border Patrol and Sheriffs Department will be made in the area starting today.\n\nThe rescued immigrants were treated for hypothermia or exposure. They were then taken into custody by the \nBorder Patrol and are expected to be returned to Mexico. The immigrants had set out from Mexico earlier in the \nweek, traveling into rugged, unfamiliar territory, some dressed only in jeans, T-shirts and tennis shoes.\n\nMore than 140 illegal immigrants died last year crossing from Mexico into San Diego and Imperial Counties in \nCalifornia, Bill Strassberger, a spokesman for the Federal Immigration and Naturalization Service, told The \nAssociated Press. About 20 had died this year before the latest fatalities.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
