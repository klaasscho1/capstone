The president then spoke on his \nstatement that he released Friday.\n\n\"I am not able to respond as quickly as you would like me to respond. I don't respond at the speed of social media,\" \nMarrero said. \"It wasn't until we had via investigation enough information for me to respond to campus. The \napproval for that statement was expedited via the legal and system process and sent to campus Friday afternoon.\"\n\nSGA will be holding another open forum Wednesday on the Statesboro campus. The forum is scheduled for 6:30 \np.m. in the Russell Union Ballroom.  \n\nJason Chapman of The George-Anne Inkwell Edition contributed to this article\n\nNathan Woodruff, Managing News Editor, gaeditor@georgiasouthern.edu\n"}
