{"title": "America's Better Self Got Lost in Aliens Law;'Victims' Who Exploit", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nI cannot fathom why Anthony Lewis and others have painted Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood, President Clinton's first \ntwo nominees for Attorney General, as victims of a male-dominated society simply because they employed illegal \naliens as child care workers (column, Feb. 8).\n\nAdmittedly I am not a mother or a highly paid professional woman. However, I have worked with immigrant rights \ngroups, and I can tell you the main reason people employ illegal aliens is that they will work for much less, and \nbecause of their tenuous status with the Immigration and Naturalization Service they are more compliant and more \neasily exploited.\n\nWith regard to the consequences of the actions of Ms. Baird, Judge Wood and any men whose wives have \nemployed illegal aliens, this is not about keeping women in their place. I wish somebody would keep me in my \nplace as a Federal district judge or a $500,000-a-year general counsel for a Fortune 500 company.\n\nIf these women were low- or middle-income workers who would be put into a serious financial bind by paying the \nprevailing rate for legal nannies, I might feel different. However, this issue has nothing to do with feminism and \neverything to do with the wanton, callous, capitalistic exploitation of the reserve army of the unemployed.\n\nWe've come a long way, baby. Is this the direction we want to continue going in?\n\n \n\nBETSY SHACKELFORD\n\nNew York, Feb. 8, 1993\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nDrawing.\n"}
