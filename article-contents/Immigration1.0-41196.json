{"title": "LUNGREN GIVES DETAILS OF PROP. 187 ENFORCEMENT", "body": "\nChildren born in the United States to undocumented immigrant parents have a right to schooling under the newly \npassed Proposition 187 but probably will end up leaving the country anyway if their parents can't prove their own \nlegal residency, state Attorney General Dan Lungren said Sunday.\n\nLungren's comments came during an appearance on \"This Week With David Brinkley\" in which he gave some \ndetails on how he planned to enforce Proposition 187.\n\nThe measure, which voters approved 59 percent to 41 percent last week, deprives illegal immigrants of education, \nnon-emergency medical care and other social services. It also requires doctors, teachers and police officers to \nreport suspected undocumented immigrants to authorities.\n\n\"With respect to education, there will be a requirement for proof that they have a residency and a legal residency \nwith their family here,\" Lungren said on the news show. \"If that were the case and their family were forced to go \nback to Mexico, I assume they would go as well.\"\n\nSeveral medical and teachers' groups have said they would not enforce the provisions. Other groups filed lawsuits \nagainst the measure.\n\nLungren told the ABC news show that people not enforcing the law would not be punished.\n\n\"They wouldn't be committing a crime,\" he said. \"I've tried to make that very clear. There's not prosecution that \nwould be in the offing.\"\n\nLungren said he would prefer to prevent illegal immigration rather than address the problem after the fact but the \nfederal government has done little to stop people from coming to the United States illegally.\n"}
