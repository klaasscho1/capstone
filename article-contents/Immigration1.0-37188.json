{"title": "U.S. border wall irks Mexicans", "body": "\nA Mexican government official said the United States is being less than neighborly by constructing a 14-mile border \nwall near San Diego and opposition parties called it an affront to their country Wednesday.\n\n The United States ''can do whatever it likes on its territory, although this is not exactly a neighborly act,'' Deputy \nForeign Relations Secretary Javier Barros Valero said earlier this week.\n\nOpposition political parties said during a radio talk show Wednesday their government should file a formal protest \nwith Washington over the wall, which is an affront to Mexicans.\n\n Barros Valero said his government would seek solutions through its ongoing dialogue with Washington.\n\n The two countries, along with Canada, are now negotiating a trilateral free-trade agreement. Barros Valero said the \npresence of the corrugated steel wall along the Tijuana-San Diego border should not affect the talks.\n\n United States officials have said the wall is intended to halt the passage of drugs and arms into their country. \nMexico is a major transshipment point for South American cocaine headed for the United States.\n\n The Tijuana-San Diego area is the most popular spot along the 2,000- mile border for the thousands of \nundocumented Mexican workers crossing into the United States each day.\n\n It has also been the sight of protests by groups opposed to the illegal passage of Mexicans into the United States \nand counter-protests in support of the immigrants.\n\n Plans to build a border drainage ditch by the United States about two years ago sparked a similar controversy.\n"}
