{"title": "National Briefing Washington: Bill For Noncitizen Soldiers", "body": "\n     The House Judiciary Committee approved a measure intended to speed the naturalization process for \nnoncitizens in the military. \n\nThe bill, which will be presented to the House in coming weeks, would allow immigrant soldiers to apply for \ncitizenship after serving one year in the armed forces. The current waiting period is three years. Supporters said the \nlegislation would reward immigrant soldiers. Others warned that the bill would not prevent the deportation of the \nsoldiers' parents.   Rachel L. Swarns (NYT)\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
