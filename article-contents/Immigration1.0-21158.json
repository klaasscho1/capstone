{"title": "Big rise in arrests of immigrants", "body": "\nIn recent months, newly created teams of federal agents have arrested thousands of illegal immigrants who have \nlived and worked in the United States for years without interference. Most have been deported immediately.\n\nSince October, 13,089 immigrants have been detained, a more than 60 percent increase from the same period in \n2004.\n\nImmigrant advocates called the sweeps excessive and heavy-handed, while supporters of tougher enforcement \nsaid that even more must to be done.\n\n``Whenever we do any sort of enforcement action, we get praise and criticism,'' said Dean Boyd of U.S. Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nSince October, the number of fugitive-search teams assigned to finding immigrants where they live has increased \nfrom 18 to 38. The agency plans 14 more teams by the end of September.\n\n``It's a higher priority,'' said John Torres, the director of ICE's detention and removal operations.\n\nBetween October and mid-February, ICE agents arrested 620 people in Northern California and Bakersfield. Of \nthem, 400 had criminal records, according to Virginia Kice, an ICE official in Laguna Niguel.\n\nTorres said officers were not arbitrarily arresting people off the streets, but were targeting immigrants who had \nbeen ordered deported after exhausting all appeals.\n\nMercury News Staff Writer Jesse Mangaliman contributed to this report.\n"}
