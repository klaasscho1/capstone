{"title": "Political Conditions Iran", "body": "\nFrom the 1979 Revolution to 2002\n\nThe 1979 Islamic revolution and the war with Iraq transformed Iran's class structure politically, socially and \neconomically. In general Iranian society remained divided into urban, market-town, village and tribal groups. \n\"Mullahs\" (clerics) tended to dominate politics and nearly all aspects of Iranian life.\n\nAfter the fall of the Pahlavi regime in 1979, much of the urban upper class of prominent merchants, industrialists \nand professionals, favored by the former Shah, lost standing and influence to the senior clergy and their supporters. \nAlternately, bazaar merchants, who were allied with the clergy against the Pahlavi Shah, gained political and \neconomic power in the aftermath of the revolution. The urban working class enjoyed somewhat enhanced status \nand economic mobility, spurred, in part, by opportunities provided by revolutionary organizations and the \ngovernment bureaucracy.\n\nThe early days of the regime were characterized by political turmoil. These included the seizure of the United States \n(U.S.) embassy compound and its occupants on Nov. 4, 1979, by Iranian militants. By mid-1982, a succession of \npower struggles first eliminated the center of the political spectrum, followed quickly by the leftists, leaving only the \nclergy. There was some moderation of excesses both internally and internationally, although Iran remained a \nsignificant sponsor of terrorism. Internally, political struggles and unrest, as well as economic disorder, continued to \nprevail.\n\nIn addition to a turbulent political environment, economic growth and development was hindered by unemployment, \npopulation growth, the economic burden caused by the costly war with Iraq, in addition to shortages of raw \nmaterials and trained managers. Farmers and peasants received a psychological boost from the attention given to \nthem by the Islamic regime, but were not better off in economic terms. The government made progress on rural \ndevelopment, including electrification and road building, but did not make a commitment to land redistribution.\n\nThe Islamic Republican Party, or IRP, was Iran's dominant political party until its dissolution in 1987. The Iranian \ngovernment has been opposed by a few armed political groups, including the \"Mojahedin-e-Khalq\" (People's \nMojahedin of Iran), the People's Fedayeen, and the Kurdish Democratic Party.\n\nSince 1987, Iran has gone through some very dramatic political changes. The religious hierarchy still has great \ncontrol over both domestic and foreign policy. Since the death of the Ayatollah Khomeini on June 3, 1989, however, \nthe government has formed a coalition of sorts between the different factions of Islam. The \"Majlis-e Khobregan\" \n\n\n(Council of Experts) chose the outgoing president of the republic, Ali Hoseini-Khomeini, to be Khomeini's successor \nas the national religious leader, in what pro ved to be a smooth transition. Ayatollah Khomeini has been considered \na hard-liner.\n\nAli Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, speaker of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, was elected president with an \noverwhelming majority; he took office on Aug. 3, 1989. Four years later, Rafsanjani was re-elected with a more \nmodest majority of about 63 percent of the votes cast. Some Western observers attributed the reduced voter \nturnout to disenchantment with the deteriorating economy. Over the course of Rafsanjani's tenure, Iran returned to \nthe hard-line domestic policy it had been moving away from since the death of the Ayatollah Khomeini. Rafsanjani's \nadministration was seen as a coalition balanced very carefully between \"conservatives,\" \"reformers,\" and \n\"technocrats.\"\n\nIn February 1994, an attempt was made on the life of President Rafsanjani. It was later discovered that the self-\nproclaimed \"Free Officers of the Revolutionary Guards\" had committed the attack. In April 199 5, civil unrest and \nriots in a suburb of Teheran occurred. The demonstrators protested against economic reforms instituted by the \ngovernment that had caused a shortage of consumer goods during the previous twelve months.\n\nThe 1996 legislative elections (held on March 8 and April 19) produced a parliament where the conservative \nCombatant Clergy Association (or Society of Combatant Clergy) gathered 110 seats and a slight majority over the \nmore moderate Servants of Iran's Construction, which won 96 seats. The outcome suggested a high degree of \nfactionalism in Iranian politics.\n\nIn 1997, Rafsanjani was appointed Chairman of the \"Shura-ye Tashkhis-e Maslahat-e Nezam\" (Committee to \nDetermine the Expediency of the Islamic Order, or Council for Expediency) for another five-year term, ensuring that, \nalthough he could not run for president, he would still be involved in political life.\n\nPresidential elections were held on May 23, 1997. A young and discontent electorate voted overwhelmingly for the \nreform-minded candidate, Sayed Ali Mohammad Khatami-Ardakani, who was sworn into office on Aug. 3, 1997. \nAnother major figure in Iranian politics, Nateq Nouri, was re-elected speaker of the parliament in June of that same \nyear.\n\nThe moderate, reformist President Khatami emphasized his commitment to sustained and balanced advancement \nin political, cultural, and educational spheres. His administration was geared toward economic development, while \ntrying to manage the conservative and fundamentalist elements of the various governmental bodies. Iranian politics \nhave been marked by an increasing struggle for control over the future direction of Iranian domestic and foreign \npolicy. President Khatami's attempts to implement some political reforms on the domestic front and to open \ndiplomatic channels with former \"enemies of the Islamic Revolution\" were met with fierce resistance by the hard-line \nconservatives, especia lly fundamentalist religious leaders. In particular, Khatami's reforms were frequently at odds \nwith the policy preferences of the supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khomeini.\n\nKhatami's reform program  suffered many setbacks. In 1998, for example, Khatami's Interior Minister, Abdullah \nNouri, was impeached by the conservative-dominated parliament. In April 1999, Zan, a reformist newspaper with an \nemphasis on women's rights, was banned. Later that month, Mohsen Kadivar, a reformist cleric and Khatami \nsupporter, received an 18-month prison sentence for alleged defamation of the Islamic authorities. He had criticized \nthe Ayatollah Khomeini's regime. Also in April, another Khatami supporter, former Tehran mayor Gholamhossein \nKarbaschi, received a two-year prison sentence for alleged corruption. Despite a petition signed by 130 out of the \n270 members of the Islamic Consultative Assembly (parliament) requesting a pardon from the Ayatollah Khomeini, \nKarbaschi wa s imprisoned in early May. Karbaschi maintains that he is innocent and is the victim of political rivals' \ndesire to get rid of him.\n\nThe struggle between reformers and hard-liners was manifested and materialized violently with the student revolt \nand subsequent mass counter-demonstrations in July 1999. The July 7 parliament debate on new legislation to \nseverely curtail freedom of the press provided the impetus for the protests and ensuing violence. On July 8, \nstudents in Tehran gathered to protest the closing of the reformist newspaper Salam, and to demand that freedom \nof the press be maintained and even expanded.\n\n\n\nIn response to the students' demonstrations, police forces and alleged conservative, anti-reform vigilantes attacked \na Tehran University dormitory on July 9, killing an estimated five students in the process. By the next day, the \nstudent rebellion had spread to other cities in Iran, and the minister of education and the university chance llor had \ntendered their resignations.\n\nDespite a July 12 government prohibition of demonstrations, the protests continued, becoming increasingly violent \non the 12th and 13th. Some students rioted, demanding that the government act against the police responsible for \nthe attack on the dormitory and that security forces be placed under the authority of President Khatami and his \nminister of the interior. Khatami's government later did dismiss the police officers responsible for initiating the attack \non the student dormitory.\n\nOn July 14, hundreds of thousands of Iranians took to the streets to protest the students' actions and the ongoing \nviolence. Conservative members of parliament and the Ayatollah Khomeini encouraged these counter-\ndemonstrations. While President Khatami had initially condemned the police and vigilantes' actions against the \nstudents, he was later compelled to speak out against the violence, calling on the students to end their rioting. Pre \nsident Khatami had always advocated a peaceful and legal reform program; the rioting and subsequent public \nbacklash against the student movement provided hard-line elements with a prime opportunity to denounce his \nreforms. Senior members of the Revolutionary Guard went so far as to publicly blame the president and his reforms \nfor the riots. Later, General Rahim Safavi, the head of the Revolutionary Guards, stated that the security forces still \nsupported Khatami.\n\nAlthough authorities claimed to have released most of the 1,400 demonstrators arrested in the July 1999 \ndemonstrations, student leaders insisted that many were still being held; tortured; and coerced to sign confessions. \nStudents and journalists continued to demand that newspapers that had been shut down be allowed to resume \npublishing and that security forces be punished for their actions against students. They also reiterated their demand \nfor police forces to be placed under the authority of President Khat ami's government.\n\nPresident Khatami  also experienced some successes. Reformist candidates swept the March 1999 Tehran \nmunicipal elections, in the first local elections to be held throughout Iran. Ardent Khatami supporters, namely \nmembers of the Iran Islamic Participation Front, won 13 of the 15 Tehran city council positions. Abdullah Nouri, \nKhatami's former minister of the interior, won one of the seats. The pro-Khatami councilors were able to take their \nseats, despite hard-liners' pre- and post-election attempts to disqualify them. In addition to this electoral success, \nDr. Ataollah Mohajarani, Khatami's Minister of Islamic Culture and Guidance, escaped impeachment and removal \nfrom office in May 1999, appearing before the parliament and successfully defending his actions as minister. \nNevertheless, powerful conservatives continued criticizing the reformist minister, and Mohajarani was forced to \nresign in April 2000. President Khatami accepted his resignation in December.\n\nMost importantly, the February 2000 legislative elections revealed that President Khatami's reform policies are \nwidely supported by the Iranian people. In a surprisingly open and competitive election campaign, pro-Khatami \ncandidates dominated the elections, and won a large majority of the 290 Majlis seats. Election fraud and violations \nwere reported, and several electoral areas held a second round.\n\nAt the center of the ongoing political events is the struggle between the reformers and opposition politicians on one \nside and the security apparatuses and the judiciary on the other. In August 2000, participants in a conference \norganized by Iran's largest pro-reform student group, Office to Foster Unity, were attacked by the Basij (voluntary \nIslamic militia) and the elite Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, which are under direct control of the supreme leader \nAyatollah Ali Khomeini. Over the course of several days, scores of people were inju red, a policeman killed, and the \ngovernor-general of the Lorestan province attacked.\n\nA move to clamp down on an increasingly critical media was launched by conservative forces in the spring of 2000. \nSince then, more than 80 pro-reform newspapers have been closed down, and dozens of journalists and political \nactivists jailed. Top investigative journalist Akbar Ganji was convicted to 10 years in jail, and five years in exile, for \nparticipating in an international conference in Germany. Prior to the conference Ganji had written a series of articles \nimplicating senior hard-liners in the killing of opposition activists and writers. Reform-supporters accused the \n\n\n\njudiciary of violating legal rights by jailing writers and activists in favor of reforms merely on political grounds. In the \nlonger term, reformers feared that the judiciary's behavior could undermine the legitimacy of the Islamic state.\n\nIn January 2001, three Iranian intelligence officers were sen tenced to death, and 12 more to prison in connection \nwith the killings of four opposition politicians and writers in late 1998. The case has furthered the divide between \nreformers and hard-liners. Reformers believed the killings were part of a campaign to silence dissidents, and \nclaimed that more than 80 murders and 'disappearances'\" occurred over the last 10 years. Moderates and liberals \naccusef the hard-line judiciary of covering up and ignoring links to high-ranking clerics and other intelligence \nofficials. Deputy Intelligence Minister Said Emami, the most senior government member arrested in connection with \nthe murders, allegedly committed suicide while in jail.\n\nThe forming feature of Iranian politics was to be found in the power-play between the reform-dominated parliament, \nthe hard-line judiciary and the Guardian Council. On two occasions, in June 2000 and January 2001, around 150 \nmembers of parliament signed letters to the head of the judiciary, Ayatollah Ma hmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, \nprotesting the closing of newspapers and the convictions of opposition activists and reform writers to harsh prison \nsentences. The parliament also passed several bills which were rejected as 'un-Islamic' by the conservative Council \nof Guardians. The bills concerned increased press-freedoms; the right of unmarried Iranian women to study abroad; \nand the rise of the legal marriage age from nine to 15 for girls, and from 15 to 18 for boys. If a bill is overruled twice, \nthe issue is referred to the State Expediency Council, or SEC, which arbitrates in disputes between the Majlis and \nthe Guardian Council. The SEC is headed by former President Rafsanjani, who is close to the conservatives.\n\nThe Iranian people gave President Khatami a strong mandate for continued reforms in the June 8, 2001, \npresidential election. Khatami won 76.9 percent of the votes in an election that included no real challengers. The \noverwhelming vote for Khatami, even larger than the 70 percent he won four years ago, is a clear message that the \nIranian people want reforms.\n\nDespite solid support, Khatami faced immense challenges. The conservatives continued to control powerful non-\nelected positions, and continued to make President Khatami's reform-fight an uphill battle. The state-dominated \neconomy was suffering from recession and high unemployment. High oil-prices had so far postponed the need for \nacute reforms, but Khatami was under pressure to deliver results in his second term. The Iranian people, and in \nparticular the youth cohort born during the Iran-Iraq war who now amounted to a quarter of the population, were \nimpatient. The vast majority of Iranians now wanted more than reformist rhetoric; they wanted economic, political \nand cultural reforms to materialize.\n\nEconomically, Khatami remained trapped between the divergent economic views of his allies. The ones on the left \nwanted social justice and equitable distribution of income, while the ones to his right were calling fpr a more free-\nmarked styled economic policy. Economic reform had so far been marred by clerical politics and poor management. \nIf the economic situation did not improve soon, Khatami's supporters were expected to lose patience. Much \nresponsibility was on the regime, but oil prices could make or break the Iranian economy in the shorter term.\n\nSocially, the cost of mismanagement were all too apparent. Divorce rates had reached almost Western levels; an \nestimated two million people were now addicted to drugs, and the educated middle-class was leaving the country at \na rate of 200,000 per year. Culturally, the Internet and satellite dishes were bringing the global environment into \nhomes on a larger scale. Iranian theatre, music and film has been blossoming, and several Iranian filmmakers have \nreceived worldwide success with their innovative and exciting films.\n\nIn the meantime, joblessness and frustra tion created an explosive atmosphere in Iranian society. On Nov. 1, 2001, \nhooliganism mixed with social and political protest occurred when young Iranians took to the streets in Iran's major \ncities after Iran lost a soccer match it was widely expected to win. The crowds drew violent retaliation from police \nand security agents. The vast demographic bulge has created considerable economic, political and cultural \nchallenges for the regimes. While political discourse among the older opposition  remained riddled with \nrevolutionary rhetoric, opposition from younger generations was far more intolerable as they tend not to blame the \nimperialist world for Iran's domestic problems.\n\n\n\nHuman rights organizations continued to report severe human rights violations, such as torture, murder, jailing \nwithout charge or trial. In particular, freedom of expression has been severely restricted, and journalists, editors and \nintellectuals have been  frequently harassed and jaile d. Both Amnesty International and the United Nations \nCommission for Human Rights were denied access to Iran. The United Nations Human Rights Committee passed a \nreferendum asking Iran to stop its human rights abuses that include execution of minors, amputation and public \nfloggings.\n\nIn an uncharacteristic move by the Iranian parliament in November 2001, 175 MPs signed a petition stating that \ntorture and other such mental or physical abuses against prisoners was unconstitutional. They also called for the \nestablishment of a council to monitor the treatment of prisoners. In May 2002, parliament passed a bill that \noutlawed torture to gain information by detainees. However, the following month, the Guardian Council rejected the \nbill over articles it considered unconstitutional. If the reformist parliament refuses to change the bill to appease the \nGuardian Council's criticism, the bill will then be sent to the Expediency Council for approval.\n\nThe new cabinet appointed and approved by the parliament in August 2001 disappointed most of the reform-\nminded. Five new members were brought in, but none of them were radical reformers. While some reform \nsympathizers were  demoralized by the conservative backlash, President Khatami was hoping to avoid tiresome \nconfrontations by building a wider alliance that included moderate conservatives.\n\nIn fact,  political clashes between reformers and hard-liners drew criticism for President Khatami -- largely for his \nsilence regarding pressing political matters. In November 2001, the Guardian Council prevented the parliament \nfrom making amendments to election laws when he charged that any amendments are unconstitutional. The \nproposed parliamentary amendments were aimed at curtailing the power of the Guardian Council over the electoral \nprocess in light of the Council's rejection of some 60 reform-minded candidates from a provincial by-election. The \nparliament, frustrated by b eing consistently blocked by the GC, called for a referendum on democracy to meet the \ndemands of the people before the 2003 legislative elections. President Khatami kept silent during the ordeal, \nleaving many disappointed that he did not come to the direct aid of his parliament.\n\nAnother political crisis occurred at the end of 2001; this time over parliamentary immunity and legislator's freedom \nof speech. In December 2001, the Guardian Council arrested MPs Hossein Loqmanian, Mohammad Dadffar and \nFatemeh Haqiqatjou for making critical and derogatory statements about the GC during parliamentary sessions. \nLoqmanian was sentenced to ten months in prison and more than 60 other MPs were prosecuted for similar \noffenses. Outraged MPs argued that legislators were guaranteed immunity by the constitution in making such \nstatements while parliament is in session. While hard-liners had previously cracked down on reformist intellectuals, \nstudents and journalists, the blatant assa ult on parliamentary members was seen as a clear indication that \nhardliners were now waging a serious war on lawmakers, making a sort of political coup against elected reformist.\n\nOn Jan. 15, 2002, The Speaker of the parliament, along with several other MPs, staged a walkout as a protest the \nverdict against Loqmanian. Hours later Ayatollah Ali Khomeini pardoned Loqmanian. This crisis represented a small \nvictory for the parliamentary over the hardliners, yet it came at the price of a virtual shutdown of democratic \ngovernment while illustrating the GC's disregard for constitutional rights of those officials elected by the people.\n\nIt was becoming increasingly clear that the people were dissatisfied with the present state of affairs in the Iranian \ngovernment. On May 5 and 8, 2002, President Khatami, in a move analysts believed was to re-assert his \ncommitment to reform, and to take the pressure off the besieged reformist camp, harshly chastized conservati ves \nand hard-liners for blocking the path to reform. He also threatened to resign if the hard-liners continued to the block \nchanges desired by the people of Iran. On May 16, the cleric, Ayatollah Ebrahim Amini, the head of the \nconservative Assembly of Experts, warned that Iranian society was \"on the verge of explosion.\" He stated, \"The \nduty of the rulers is not fasting or preying all the time, but to listen to the people, to fulfill their demands, offer them \nbetter life, prosperity and work.\"\n\nOn the foreign policy level, President Khatami continued a policy of gradual normalization to the West, and made \nground-breaking official visits to France, Italy and Germany in 2000. Relations with the United States had been \nslowly improving, despite the United States' concern for Iran-supported terrorism. In August 2000, Iranian and \n\n\n\nAmerican legislators met in New York discussing issues of mutual concern and ways to reduce hostilities. In part \ndue to Iran's staunch pro-Palestin ian stand in the Israel-Palestinian conflict, the Iran Libya Sanctions Act, or ILSA, \nwas prolonged with another five years by the United States Congress on June 20, 2001.\n\nThe political aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001, helped define Iran's role in the \ninternational community. While the Iranian regime surprisingly strongly condemned the attacks, Iran called for a \nUnited Nations-led solution, and opposed the bombing campaign on neighboring Afghanistan.\n\nDespite the slow-moving attempts at improving relations between the United States and Iran, United States \nPresident George Bush's State of the Union address in early 2002 brought all diplomatic relations to a halt when the \npresident branded Iran, along with Iraq and North Korea, as countries forming an \"Axis of Evil.\" The Bush \nadministration alleged Iran actively seeks out weapons of mass destruction and supports terrorist organizations. \nIran immediately denou nced Bush's statement, called the United States \"the Greatest Evil,\" and warned its citizens \nthat it should prepare for an American military offensive.\n\nComplex Geopolitics\n\nIn September 2002, Iran informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that it planned to develop a \nnuclear power program. According to the Iranians, the program was intended to include the entire nuclear cycle. At \nthe time of the announcement, little attention was given to the matter by the mainstream media. Then, in February \nof 2003, Iran's President Mohammad Khatami announced that the country had its own deposits of uranium and, as \nsuch, Iran had begun extraction to produce nuclear fuel. President Khatami noted that uranium was being mined in \nthe Savand region, while processing facilities had been constructed in the cities of Isfahan and Kashan. As well, two \nother facilities at Natanz and Arak were also confirmed as being nuclear plants.\n\nIran insisted that the plants and facilities had been developed for nuclear power production. Indeed, President \nKhatami explained that Iran nuclear program would be developed in accordance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty, and he also expressed the desire to cooperate with the IAEA. In this regard, Iran said that it would welcome \ninspections by Mohamed El Baradei, the head of the IAEA, who was already scheduled to visit Iran in late February \nof 2003. When the matter of Iran's burgeoning nuclear program gained some traction in the media in early 2003, the \nofficials at the IAEA stated that Iran's nuclear developments were not a surprise and expressed little alarm about \nIran's announcements.\n\nNevertheless, El Baradei emphasized the importance of Iran's signature on the IAEA's additional protocol, which \nwould be necessary to diffuse any misgivings regarding Iran's nuclear ambitions. The additional protocol, which was \nformulated in 1991, would all ow United Nations inspectors to have liberal and unscheduled access to nuclear sites \nand facilities. Thus far, there are 28 signatories to the original protocol. The United States is not one such \nsignatory, although it has expressed the intent to adopt its own modified version. For its part, Iran has not agreed to \nthe idea of impromptu inspections, although Iranian officials said that they were willing to discuss the issue in more \ndetail.\n\nBy March 2003, Time magazine reported that Iran's nuclear program was more thoroughly advanced than had \npreviously been understood. In particular, Iran's uranium enrichment facilities were deemed to be considerably \nmore established, to the extent that they may well have been in violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. \nSpecifically, a uranium enrichment facility was reported to house hundreds of gas centrifuges, which can produce \nenriched uranium right away. As well, various parts used in the development of thousands o f other gas centrifuges \nwere being prepared for mass production. The United States expressed outrage over these discoveries. Various \nAmerican politicos observed that the restarted nuclear program in North Korea, as well as the emerging nuclear \nprogram in Iran, suggest that the \"axis of evil\" exposed by United States President George W. Bush in January \n2002, may have been a self-fulfilling prophesy of sorts.\n\nThe issue of Iran's nuclear program garnered attention in June 2003, when the International Atomic Energy Agency \n(IAEA) delivered a report on the nature of Iran's burgeoning nuclear program. Washington hoped that the IAEA \nwould declare Iran to be in violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Against this backdrop, Russia said that \nit would continue to assist Iran in developing the country's first nuclear reactor, despite objections from the United \n\n\n\nStates. Russia, however, noted that it would not provide such assistance unless Iran signed an additional prot ocol \nto the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which would provide for intensive nuclear inspections.\n\nFor its part, Iran refused to sign the additional protocol. Officials in Tehran said that no new treaties would be \nentered until international sanctions, and specifically, the ban on nuclear technology, were dropped. This caveat \nnotwithstanding, the Iranian government said that it would continue to maintain an optimistic perspective regarding \nthe idea of an additional nuclear non-proliferation protocol. Regardless, the United States rejected Iran's suggestion \nthat it would agree to the proposed inspections and protocol on the condition that the ban on nuclear technology \nwould first have to be lifted. Likewise, the IAEA urged Iran's unconditional concurrence on the additional non-\nproliferation protocol.\n\nIndeed, the head of the IAEA, Mohammed El Baradei, stated that Iran had not reported some of its nuclear \nactivities. These claims were denied by the Ira nian government in Tehran. The Iranian government also asserted \nthe view that questions regarding the country's nuclear program had become politicized. Nevertheless, the issue of \nIran's nuclear program emerged at the forefront of the international agenda when an IAEA report on the matter was \nleaked to the public. The report stated that (1) Iran had failed to account for certain nuclear materials; (2) Iran had \nfailed to provide specific documentation related to imported nuclear materials; (3) Iran had failed to report \nsubsequent processing and use of nuclear materials; and (4) Iran had failed to declare facilities where nuclear \nmaterials were stored and processed. This catalogue of revelations was referred to as \"a matter of concern\" for the \nIAEA.\n\nMeanwhile, as the war in Iraq ensued in early 2003, neighboring countries were affected. Iran was faced with \ninternal conflict as hard-line and orthodox Islamic factions of the government in Tehran placed pressure on the \nreformists for failing to more strongly condemn the military action against Iraq. As missiles from both Iraqi and \ncoalition forces hit Iranian soil, the reformist Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi attempted to retain stability by \nobserving that such occurrences were natural consequences of war. His words were directed toward the more \nradical elements of the government, and they were intended to establish a sense of calm among Iranians. They \nwere also a subtle message to Washington denoting Iran's reticence about any entangled conflict with the United \nStates. Iran has been particularly sensitive about such an outcome, having been dubbed one-third of George \nBush's \"axis of evil\" (as mentioned above).\n\nThe divisions between hard-line and reformist camps were most evident in the two diametrically opposed positions \nthey took to the Iraq situation. While some reformers quietly offered support for and cooperation with the United \nStates' plan to disarm Iraq, hard-liners have called for suicide bombings and other terrorist attacks against United \nStates' interests. The official position of Iran has been one of opposition to a war in Iraq. The lack of street protests \nin the streets of Tehran were likely to have been associated with the general dislike Iranians feel for Saddam \nHussein after suffering for many brutal years of war with Iraq. Yet at the same time, a great deal of anti-American \nsentiment in Iran has prevailed, and it could easily have been harnessed if more missiles were to fall -- accidentally \nor not -- in Iranian territory. The reformists aligned with President Mohamad Khatami were anxious to prevent such \nan outcome. Compounding matters was the desire by Shiite Muslims in Iran to have greater influence in post-war \nIraq, which has its own Shi'a population to deal.\n\nDespite Iran's attempts to maintain a low profile, the United States accused Iran of supporting armed groups inside \nIraq and specifically warned the Iran-base d Badr Brigade Shiite group of Iraqi exiles in Iran to refrain from any \nactivity that might be viewed as hostile. Although the Iranian Foreign Ministry dismissed the warnings, the United \nStates Defense Secretary harshly warned of consequences, thus raising the specter of an attack against Iran at \nsome later date. The threat raised concern that, like Syria, Iran might potentially face military action in the aftermath \nof the war against Iraq. Statements denying such a possibility by the United States Secretary of State did not fully \ndispel fears of such an outcome.\n\nIn May 2003, with the reconstruction efforts in Iraq starting, the United States was concerned that groups from \nneighboring Iran might be interfering with the process, while Iran itself might be providing a safe haven for Islamic \nmilitants. Whether or not these fears were justified, the United States speculated that Iranian factions might have \nbeen working to advance the establishment of an Islamic theocrac y in a post-war Iraq. In this regard, United States \n\n\n\nDefense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld stated in a Wall Street Journal article that \"those whose objective is to remake \nIraq in Iran's image will not be accepted or permitted.\"\n\nThe rising tensions between the United States and Iran, however, was not limited to the issue of Iraq. Washington \nlinked the suicide bombing in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia) to Tehran and resultantly, backdoor bilateral dialogue was \nsevered. For its part, Iran denied being a safe haven for terrorists and it reminded the United States that \napproximately 500 al-Qaida suspects and operatives in Iran had been arrested. With pressure intensifying, \nhowever, Tehran warned Washington not to interfere in Iran's affairs. A spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Minister \ncautioned that Iran had always defended itself and its interests and would not hesitate to do so again, if threatened.\n\nAlso in May 2003, Iranian President Mohammed Khatami traveled to Le banon for the first official visit by an Iranian \nhead of state since the Islamic revolution in 1979. At the airport, Khatami was met by the Lebanese President Emile \nLahoud, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, several Cabinet members, as well as the deputy head of Hezbollah, Sheik \nNaim Kassem. Khatami's presence was also greeted with throngs of enthusiastic Shi'a supporters in the streets of \nBeirut. In addition to signing a loan agreement valued at about $50 million, Khatami  also discussed the role of \nHezbollah with the Lebanese leadership. Although Hezbollah operates in Lebanon, its activities have often in the \npast been funded by Iran. Lebanon, Iran, and also Syria, were thusly pressured by the United States to withdraw \ntheir support of Hezbollah.\n\nOn the domestic political front, in March 2003, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami stormed out of a meeting to \nprotest a decision by hard-liners in the government to double funding for the Guardians' Council. The council \nensures that legislation falls in line with Islamic law and the development was a blow to Khatami's reformist agenda. \nSpecifically, it took funding away from Khatami's economic reform program, but symbolically, it represented the \ninternal power struggle between conservative hard-liners and reformers in the Iranian government.\n\nIn June 2003, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) urged Iran to accept stringent nuclear inspections, \nwhich would fall under the jurisdiction of an additional protocol to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Iran, \nhowever, announced it would not agree to intensify inspections of its nuclear program saying that such measures \nwould be considered -- if and when -- the ban on access to nuclear technology was lifted. Iran also maintained the \nposition that its nuclear program did not include ambitions of nuclear weapons development. Nevertheless, Iran \nsaid it would invite the head of the IAEA, Mohammed El Baradei, for a visit, which w ould be intended to clarify \noutstanding \"technical problems\" regarding Iran's nuclear program. The government in Tehran did not specify what \nthose \"technical problems\" might be.\n\nVarious members of the international community urged Iran to accept both inspections as well as the additional \nprotocol. These members of the international community include the United States, which is adamantly against the \ndevelopment of an Iranian nuclear program, as well as Russia, which earlier offered to assist Iran in nuclear \ndevelopment for power generation purposes. The United Kingdom also urged Iran to allow tougher inspections at its \nnuclear facilities, warning that the issue might affect Iran's relations with the European Union (EU). Throughout, \nIran has said that it would expect some sort of reciprocation for its efforts. For its part, however, the United States \nrejected Iran's suggestion that it would agree to the proposed inspections and protocol on the condition that the ban \non nuclear technology would first have to be lifted. Likewise, the IAEA urged Iran's unconditional concurrence on \nthe additional non-proliferation protocol.\n\nThe IAEA also issued a report stating that (1) Iran had failed to account for certain nuclear materials; (2) Iran had \nfailed to provide specific documentation related to imported nuclear materials; (3) Iran had failed to report \nsubsequent processing and use of nuclear materials; and (4) Iran had failed to declare facilities where nuclear \nmaterials were stored and processed. This catalogue was referred to as \"a matter of concern\" for the IAEA. Indeed, \nIran's nuclear program includes the construction of a nuclear plant where centrifuges are developed. Centrifuges \ncan be used to produce enriched uranium, which is itself the principal material used in the creation of nuclear \nweaponry.\n\nIn July 2003, Iran completed a test of a long-range surface to surface Shahab-3 ballistic missile. The missile is \nbased o n the North Korean Nodong-1 missile, however, it has developed further using Russian technology. Military \n\n\n\nanalysts say that the missile had a range of 800 miles and that it could potentially reach Israel. Tehran has not \nbeen supportive of the Jewish state of Israel and has been accused of supporting militant Islamic extremists. \nRegardless, Tehran has said that its missiles are to be used only as deterrents.\n\nBy September 2003, the United States declared that Iran had clearly violated its United Nations nuclear safeguards \nobligations. However, the United States did say it was willing \"to give Iran a last chance to stop its evasions.\" Iran \ncontinued to deny its uranium enrichment activities were part of an illegal weapons program.\n\nA few weeks later, the head of Iran's atomic energy program, Gholamreza Aghazadeh, said that he intended to \nparticipate in discussions with the IAEA about the country's nuclear program. The discussions were to focus on the \npossibility of Iran signing a new protocol (mentioned above). Earlier, Iran's orthodox governmental factions \nappeared on the verge of ending cooperation with the IAEA. Indeed, Iran had threatened to review its relationship \nwith the IAEA after an Oct. 31, 2003, deadline was imposed by which verification would be made about a possible \nnuclear weapons program. Thus, Aghazadeh quelled the fears of many in the international community when he said \nthat the government of Iran remained committed to meeting its responsibilities in regard to the existing treaty.\n\nIn October 2003, following negotiations with the IAEA, and talks with the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, \nFrance and Germany, Iran agreed to temporarily halt its enrichment of uranium. Iran also agreed to sign an \nadditional protocol to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which would provide for spontaneous inspections of \nnuclear facilities in Iran. Both measures were aimed at assuring the IAEA and th e international community that Iran \nwas not pursuing a nuclear weapons program. In return, European foreign ministers agreed to recognize Iran's \nright to \"the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\" Still, since it agreed to these two measures, Iran did not immediately \nend its enrichment of uranium. The Iranian Foreign Ministry said that it was exploring how it might halt the nuclear \nfuel cycle. Iranian President Khatami has said that Iran wished to resolve the matter, so long as its right to nuclear \ntechnology was not compromised.\n\nIran was facing an Oct. 31, 2003 (noted above), deadline to demonstrate to the IAEA that it does not have nuclear \nweapons ambitions. On Nov. 20, 2003, the IAEA reviewed Iranian compliance with its demands. Ultimately, Iran \nsaid it would suspend its uranium enrinchment program and allow tougher United Nations inspections of its nuclear \nfacilities.  However, by February 2004, the United States said it was considering action over what it alleged was \nIran's continued pursuit of nuclear weapons.  The announcement came after United Nations inspectors reportedly \nfound undeclared nuclear technology in Iran.\n\nAs 2003 drew to an end, the future of Iran depended largely on the success or failure of the ruling elite in delivering \ntangible economic, social and political benefits to the ordinary Iranians, as well as their immediate constituencies. If \nstate policies gained legitimacy and consolidated their position in society at large, political reform -- and even a \ndevelopment toward democracy based on Islam -- could have a chance to develop.\n\nTragedy struck the country late in the year.  On Dec. 26, 2003, Iran's southern city of Bam -- about 620 miles (1,000 \nkilometers) southeast of Tehran -- suffered a devastating earthquake. The earthquake had a magnitude of at least \n6.3, according to local sources, although the United States Geological Survey measured it somewhat higher at 6.7.  \nIranian officials estimated the death toll to be around 40,000.\n\nMore than 200,000 people inhabited Bam and its surrounding areas.  Within Bam, most of the structures that were \ndestroyed made of either mud brick or ordinary bricks, which collapsed and left no protected spaces within which \npeople might survive. The outlying villages of Bam were completely destroyed.  Complicating matters was the \nincreasing threat of disease.  Several correspondents on the ground in Iran reported the \"stench of death\" in the air, \nand observed that the failure to clear corpses from the rubble could result deleteriously for survivors.\n\nBam is home to the ruins of a historic citadel -- a 2,000-year-old architectural feature surrounded by a medieval \ncity.  It was listed on UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites.\n\nApproximately 400 foreign experts from 16 different countries were reported to be involved in the rescue efforts.  \nTechnologic ally advanced sound equipment as well as sniffer dogs (despite the view of dogs as unclean in Islamic \nculture), were being used.  Those efforts notwithstanding, the Iranian media variously reported that the rescue \n\n\n\nefforts had been hampered by the government's poor coordination, which included insufficient bulldozers, \nexcavators and other such equipment.  The local media also faulted the government for its lack of preventive \nmeasures in a country that has been repeatedly affected by earthquakes.\n\nFor its part, the Iranian government rejected help from Israeli non-governmental organizations. Nevertheless, in \ncontrast with a similar situation following an earthquake several years ago, Iran did not reject all international aid.  \nDespite the Bush administration's decision to include Iran in its \"axis of evil\" in 2002 (as noted above), two United \nStates aircraft carrying food and aid landed in the city of Kerman -- the first touchdown of United States airc raft on \nIranian soil for about a decade.\n\nIn mid-February 2004, the country was facing another crisis.  This time over the disqualification of thousands of \nreformist candidates from the February 20 elections. The Council of Guardians had announced a list of more than \n5,400 candidates who were approved to run for election around the country.  More than 2,300 candidates -- four \ntimes as many as in the last election -- were disqualified, including many of the most well-known figures in the \nreform movement.  Also disqualified was Mohammad Reza Khatami, the president's brother, who was in charge of \nthe largest reform faction and served as deputy speaker of the outgoing parliament.  He had won more votes than \nany other candidate in the 2000 general elections.\n\nMany candidates were declared not eligible due to an alleged indifference to Islam and to the constitution.  Others \nwere accused of questioning the supreme leader's powers.  ; In the end, a total of 4,737 candidates were vying for \n289 seats.\n\nAt the time, it was believed that the elections could bring about instability and a minority, right-wing government that \nmight be rejected internationally and reverse much of the progress President Khatami had made in regards to \nexternal relations.  Indeed, analysts were predicting a win for the religious conservatives without the mass \nparticipation of pro-reform voters.  A government survey indicated that turnout would likely be around 30 percent \ncountrywide, but falling as low as 10 percent in large cities.\n\nAlthough steady voting was reported, voting turnout was expected to drop dramatically from the 67.2 percent seen \nin 2000 as voters expressed disappointment over the recent political rift and the failure of reformists to carry out \ntheir earlier pledges. The United States said the elections were neither free nor fair.  Meanwhile, supreme leader \nAyatollah Ali Khomeini urged voters to go to the polls, charging that the country's \"enemies\" wanted it boycotted.\n\nAs expected, on the eve of the election, some of the country's most famous intellectuals and journalists called for a \nboycott.  Unable to penetrate the mainstream media, liberals sent boycott e-mails and mobile phone messages to \nmillions of people.  One such message reportedly read, \"Don't take part in the funeral of freedom.\" Whether or not \nthe reformist boycott succeeded or not remained to be seen at the time of writing.\n\nNot surprisingly, once all the ballots were counted, it was announced that Iran's hardliners, conservatives and other \nright-leaning candidates gained control of almost all the major seats despite the record low turnout of eligible voters. \nOnly 50.57 percent of the electorate participated -- a portion 17 percent lower than the last parliamentary elections \nin 2000.  The result was that the new parliament would be composed of a mix of hardliners, conservatives and right-\nleaning independents leaving President Mohammed Khatami, whose term is due to end in June 2005, an isolated \nreformist holding public office in Iran.\n\nAlthough Iranian leaders could claim that the turnout of the electorate was higher than that of certain Western \ndemocracies, it could not so easily ignore the significantly low turnout in urban centers, such as the capital city of \nTehran, where participation was around 28 percent of the electorate.\n\nBy mid-2004, even as global attention was focused on the situation in Iraq, questions about Iran's nuclear potential \nran rampant.  TheInternational Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA), led by chief nuclear inspector Mohamed ElBaradei, \ncriticized Iran for its lack of cooperation in its determination of whether or not Iran was attempting to develop \nnuclear weaponry. Indeed,  ElBaradei said it remained unknown as to how extensive Iran's nuclear program might \nbe, and h ow developed its centrifuge building plans were.  He also noted that it was unknown as to whether or not \nIran had declared all of its enrichment activities, used in the development of nuclear weapons. At issue was the \n\n\n\nlingering question of traces of weapons-grade uranium uncovered in Iran.  While ElBaradei cautioned there was no \nevidence sustaining allegations by the United States of an Iranian nuclear program, he warned that Iran had not \nbeen adequately cooperative and called for greater transparency and responsive engagement.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Kingdom, France and Germany promulgated a draft resolution at the United Nations \ncondemning Iran's conduct on this matter.  Debate was to commence in Vienna on this draft resolution.  Central to \nthe document was a call for Iran to halt aspects of its nuclear program.\n\nFor its part, Tehran  denied all claims of a nuclear weapons programs and told the IAEA that it should stop its \ninvestigation.  At the same time, the Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said that Iran must be recognized \ninternationally as a nuclear nation whose nuclear ambitions are aimed only at electric power generation.  \nParliamentarians in Iran also warned that they would retaliate if either the IAEA or the international community \nexerted too much pressure on the issue.\n\nAround the same time as the criticism from the IAEA arose, according to Iran's Revolutionary Guards, three navy \nvessels from the United Kingdom entered Iranian territorial waters located close to the Iraqi border without \npermission.  The Iranian Foreign Ministry in Tehran said the vessels were seized and that eight of the sailors on \nboard were arrested.  For its part, the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defense in London confirmed it had lost contact \nwith three patrol vessels in the area but it did not confirm the identities of the persons arrested by the Iranian \nauthorities.&nb sp; Reports suggested that diplomats from the United Kingdom were in contact with Iranian officials \nin the hopes of resolving the matter.  Bilateral relations between London and Tehran have remained strained over \nhuman rights, nuclear proliferation as well as policies regarding the Middle East.\n\nIn September 2004, the IAEA again expressed concerns over uranium enrichment, a possible precursor to \nmanufacture of nuclear weapons, and passed a resolution calling for Iran to stop this activity.  The speaker of Iran's \nparliament, Ali Haddad Adel, rejected the calls, saying Iran would make an independent decision on uranium \nenrichment suspension.  Nonetheless, Iran did leave a door open for compromise with the IAEA when it said that \nany further suspension of enrichment activities was a matter for negotiations, although it could not be achieved via \nresolutions. The IAEA then set a meeting date of November 25 to review the Iranian nuclear program. This secured \nfor Iran some time to answer any outstanding questions and avoid possible United Nations sanctions.\n\nOne problem that remained to be addressed was the question of the degree of  advancement of the Iranian nuclear \nprogram. Iran's top nuclear negotiator, Hassan Rohani, said Iran was producing uranium hexaflouride gas out of \nyellow cake uranium at one facility, and had reached the last stage of uranium enrichment at another.\n\nIn November 2004, Iran agreed to suspend much of its uranium enrichment activities by a deadline of Nov. 22, \n2004.  This development  came on the heels of meetings with the European Union. Talks between Iran and the \nEuropean body have been ongoing as regards trade concessions and nuclear power.  The International Atomic \nEnergy Agency (IAEA) said that while this was a positive development, it could not say whether or not there were \nundeclared nuclear materials at stake.  Moreover, a halt on nuclear related activities did not necessarily constitute a \ncomplete halt.  Indeed, the head of the IAEA, Mohammed ElBaradei, said in early 2005 that the full picture \nregarding Iran's nuclear activities and facilities remained unknown.\n\nA week after United States President George W. Bush warned he would not rule out military action against Iran in \nearly 2005, Iran's Supreme Leader Seyed Ali Khanenei responded in a disparaging tone.  The Iranian leader \nreferred to the United States' threats as \"nonsense\" in response to various comments by members of the Bush \nadministration that Iran should be viewed as a threat to the world because of its attempt to develop nuclear \nweapons.  For its part, Iran said that it would defend itself against American aggression and militarism, even as it \ncontinued to engage in talks with the European Union regarding its nuclear program. Iran said that its nuclear \nprogram is for peaceful means and is intended only as a deterrent against enemy states in the region.\n\nIn February 2005,  even as newly-appointed United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice applied harsh \nwords toward Iran's nuclear development, Iranian officials continued to defend its right to develop nuclear power for \npeaceful -- and if necessary -- defensive purposes.\n\n\n\nIn a related development, talks between United States representatives and Iranian representatives on Iran's nuclear \nprogram were marked by cultural gaffes, which included a dinner menu of items inconsistent with traditional Islamic \npractice. The unfortunate circumstances did not bode well for the already dismal state of bilateral relations between \nthe two countries.\n\nMeanwhile, the nuclear issue also took center stage as Iran and Russia signed an agreement by which Moscow \nwould supply fuel for  Iran's new nuclear reactor in Bushehr. Under the terms of the agreement, Iran must return \nspent nuclear fuel rods from the reactor, which had been designed and built by Russia. This condition was \nimplemented in response to growing anxiety by the United States, Israel and others about Iran's nuclear ambitions.  \nThe deal was significant because it was intended to allay the fears of the international community, while at the \nsame time, ensuring that Iran's first reactor was brought on stream.  This latter consideration was a key \nconsideration as the nuclear project had increasingly represented a symbol of national pride in the face of United \nStates opposition.\n\nIn the backdrop of this development was a meeting in Slovakia between Russian President Vladimir Putin and \nUnited States President George W. Bush in which both countries agreed that Iran should not develop nuclear \nweapons.  Russia, however, refused to acquiesce to United States pressure to completely halt cooperation with Iran \non nuclear power.\n\nIn June 2005, six bombs exploded in Iran, collectively killing several individuals and injuring scores of people only \ndays ahead of the presidential election. Four of the blasts targeted government buildings in the south-western city \nof Ahwaz, close to the Iraq border.  This area suffered from unrest between Arabs and Persians a few months \nearlier in April 2005.  A fifth bomb exploded near the Imam Hussein mosque in the capital city of Tehran, killing two \npeople. At the Vali Asr square in central Tehran, a sixth explosion went off. Another three bombs were defused \nbefore they could detonate.\n\nThere have been few bombings in Iran since the war with Iraq ended in 1988. Although no group actually claimed \nresponsibility for the sudden violence, Iran's main security decision-making entity, the Supreme National Security \nCouncil, suggested that the attacks might have been carried out by separatist Arabs. A spokesperson for the \ncouncil also intimated that separatist Arabs might have been helped by an armed opposition group base d in Iraq \ncalled the People's Mujahideen. For its part, however, the People's Mujahideen denied any involvement in the \nattacks. The spokesperson also mentioned possible involvement by the remnants of the Ba'ath Party, as well as \nAmerican and British interests.  No actual evidence pertaining to these claims was, however, offered.\n\nElections of 2005\n\nThe first round of presidential elections were held in Iran on June 17, 2005, to determine the new president and \nsuccessor to outgoing President Mohammad Khatami, who was constitutionally barred from seeking a third term.  \nDespite criticism from the United States government about the political process in Iran, and despite the fact that \ndissidents called for a boycott to protest the prohibition of female candidates and key reformists, turnout was \nnonetheless reported to be quite high.  Indeed, voting had to be extended three times, ending about four hours later \nthan scheduled, in order to accommodate voters.  As such, de spite the ostensible limitations of Iran's political \nsystem, the high level of participation among the electorate provided an air of much-needed legitimacy to a system \nin which all political candidates had to be approved by the clerical authorities, known as the Guardian Council. In \nIran, the council is charged with the task of evaluating candidates on the basis of their support for the Islamic \nsystem of government and moral values.\n\nWhile there was no clear winner predicted, and even as experts predicted it would be the closest election since the \nIslamic revolution in 1979, polls leading up to the election suggested that former President Akbar Hashemi \nRafsanjani was commanding the greatest amount of support.  Still, with competition between both reformist and \nconservative factions, it was conceivable that if one candidate did not manage to garner more than 50 percent and \nan absolute majority, a second round of elections might have to be scheduled.\n\n\n\nRafsanjani was competing within a field of several presidential candidates.  Up to 1,000 other possible presidential \ncontenders had been earlier rejected by the Guardian Council.  Among the hard-liner conservatives within the \napproved field of candidates were the following: the former police chief, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf; the mayor of \nTehran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad; and  the former head of state-run media, Ali Larijani.  Among the reformists within \nthe approved field of candidates were the following: Iran's former parliamentary speaker, Mehdi Karrubi; Former \nEducation Minister Mostafa Moin and leading activist, Mostafa Moin; and Vice-President for Sports Mohsen \nMehralizadeh.\n\nRegarded now as a pragmatist and a centrist who enjoyed good relations with the country's clerical authorities, \nRafsanjani took on a more progressive message for the duration of his campaign.  He called for improved relations \nwith the West and also addressed the country's economic challenges.  Both issues were of paramount importance \nto younger voters who  made up a substantial portion of the electorate.\n\nThe political candidates knew that victory was not possible without capturing a lion's share of this particular \ndemographic group.  But young voters were somewhat frustrated with the Iranian landscape.  Up to a quarter of the \nyouth population has been faced with unemployment and they have become increasingly aware that only through \ngreater integration with the global system will more growth -- and jobs -- emerge.  Meanwhile, their exposure to the \nWest through satellite television and the Internet has meant that they have come to view things through a different \ncultural prism than their parents' generation. As such, they want to see better ties with the West, even as they begin \nto take on more of a Western lifestyle (if only in a clandestine manner). They anticipated the promised reforms of \nKhatami with enthusiasm, but were disappointed when he was unable to deliver on them because of the pressure \nfrom the hard-liners and clerical authorities. After all, the ultimate authority in Iran has resided not with the president \nbut with the unelected supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khomeini.\n\nFollowing the first round of the election, the two main candidates who garnered the strongest support were former \nPresident Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Tehran Mayor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The fact that Ahmadinejad had \ngarnered the second largest portion of the vote share was regarded as surprising, especially since early election \nreturns suggested that a reformist candidate was coming in second to Rafsanjani.  Mostafa Moin and other \ncandidates alleged that the election had been rife with fraud and vote-rigging. The public outcry led to the \ngovernment call for a recount of ballots in four cities, including Tehran.  The allegation of fraud notwithstanding, for \nthe first time, Iran would go through a second round -- or run-off election -- between the two top vote-getting \ncandidates on June 24, 2005.\n\nAs voters headed toward the run-off date, they were faced once again with an ideological choice between \nconservatism and reform.  Conservative factions were encouraged to strongly support Ahmadinejad.\n\nIn fact, Islamic paramilitary forces were reported to have been instructed to vote for him.  In response, the Islamic \nRevolution Mujahideen Organization and the Islamic Iran Participation Front -- both known as being reformist \norganizations --  issued statements opposing military involvement in the political process. Meanwhile, reformist \nleaders urged supporters to throw their weight of support behind Rafsanjani. Whether or not he was their candidate \nof choice in the first round, the priority was to prevent a victory by the conservative hard-liner, Ahmadinejad. Even \ndefeated reformist, Mostafa Moin, urged the country's progressive factions to unite to defeat Ahmadinejad. For his \npart, Rafsanjani called on Iranians to support him against the \"extremist\" in the run-off.  His also referenced the \ncharges of fraud, noting that they had \"tarnished\" the election.\n\nOn the ground in Iran, there was  general feeling of shock among those with reformist inclinations.  Even among \nmoderate conservatives, there was a sense of uneasiness surrounding Ahmadinejad's surprising showing in the \nfirst round of the election. Many Iranians were anxious because a victory for a hard-liner like Ahmadinejad could \nvery well herald a reversal of some of the changes and social freedoms, which had been gained in recent years.  \nSeveral progressive reformists said in interviews that although Rafsanjani did not represent their philosophies, they \nfelt compelled to vote for him in the second round, given the predilections of his opponent. Still, Ahmadinejad's \nconsiderable appeal resided in his populist message, which called for a system in which all people could benefit \neconomically, in keeping with many of the principles of the revolution.  In a country where there has been a divide \n\n\n\nbetween the \"haves\" and the \"have-nots,\" his message appeared to have resonated with a sizable portion of the \nvoters.  His election success also illustrated the fact that while the discourse about Iran has often centered on its \npolitical theocracy and burgeoning nuclear program, on the ground, socio-economic issues, such as class, are \nimportant to many Iranians.\n\nOn June 24, 2005, when voters returned to the polls for the second round, turnout was very heavy. Many Iranians \nseemed very invested in the outcome and aware that their collective choices would chart the future course for the \ncountry.  Once the votes were tallied, it appeared that Ahmadinejad had won a convincing victory with 62 percent in \nthe run-off -- almost twice the amount of votes garnered by Rafsanjani. The outcome meant that conservative  hard-\nliners now controlled all elected and unelected positions of Iranian government.\n\nThe winner, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,  was born in Garmsar (close to Tehran)  in 1956. The son of a blacksmith, he \nalso functioned as a revolutionary guard and was a supporter of the revolution in the late 1970s, which brought \nAyatollah Khomeini to power.  He was also alleged to have been involved with the American  hostage crisis during \nthat period.\n\nHe went on to gain a doctorate in traffic and transport from Tehran's University of Science and Technology; he was \na lecturer at that very institution before being appointed mayor of Tehran in 2003. As mayor, he cut back on many \nof the reforms instituted by the moderates who had earlier been in charge of the city. As well, he shut down a \nnumber of the Western-style fast-food restaurants, removed Western-style advertising, and mandated Islamic-style \nbeards and traditional garb for males. Perhaps as a result of these philosophical differences, he was excluded from \nkey policy setting meetings by President Khatami. When he  entered the presidential election campaign, he was not \nvery well known and expended no money on campaigning.  Instead his candidacy was backed by the conservative \nclerical elite and mobilized in the country's mosques.  His populism -- embodied in his charges against the wealthy, \nhis campaign against corruption and his simple lifestyle -- captured the attention of significant factions of voters.\n\nPost-election Politics and Global Implications\n\nIn a statement presumably directed toward the United States and the West, the new president, Mahmoud \nAhmadinejad, said that his victory was a blow to Iran's enemies. The new Iranian president also noted that his \nintent was to \"build up an exemplary, developed and powerful Islamic society.\"  With regard to concerns about the \npossible retraction of social reforms, he said, that freedom originated with God and that Iranians already enjoyed all \nconceived liberties.\n\nFor his part, defeated Iranian presidential candidate Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani responded by accusing the \nauthorities of dirty tricks and election fraud.  His angry response was echoed by other reformist candidates and their \nassociated factions; they accused Iran's Revolutionary Guards and Basij security services of orchestrating a plot to \nensure a victory by Ahmadinejad.  Indeed, officials from the  Interior Ministry  who were responsible for monitoring \npolling stations apparently received  about 300 complaints of electoral violations in the capital city of Tehran alone. \nThe Guardian Council, however, dismissed all such allegations.\n\nMeanwhile, a spokesperson from the Iranian Foreign Ministry stated that  the country would resume uranium \nenrichment, which had been suspended since late 2004, and it would pursue its nuclear program.  The \nannouncement, which had been issued before the actual election results were known,  was a symbolic indicator \nthat whomever was elected to be president, the actual policy agenda of the country would remain under the control \nof the clerical elite.\n\nOn Aug. 8, 2005, the United Nations nuclear agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed that \nIran had resumed fuel cycle work at its uranium conversion facility, which is located near the city of Isfahan. Since \n2004, such activity was suspended to provide the appropriate climate for negotiations with the European Union \n(EU). However, on Aug. 6, 2005, Iran rejected proposals made by the EU for the purpose of halting its nuclear \nprogram. Iran went on to state that it remained interested in further negotiations with the EU, but that it reserved the \nright to develop its own nuclear power.  Both the EU and the United States have said that a resumption of nuclear \ndevelopment activities of this sort could result with Iran being referred to the United Nations Security Council, from \n\n\n\nwhich economic sanctions could result. The IAEA was expected to meet on Aug. 9, 2005, to discuss the emerging \nsituation.  It was expected that the nuclear watchdog group would then submit a report to the United Nations \nSecurity Council. Indeed, the IAEA backed a United Nations resolution calling for a halt to Iran nuclear development \nprogram.\n\nMeanwhile, United States President George W. Bush responded to news of the resumption of Iran's nuclear \nprogram by stating that he had not ruled out the option of using force against Iran. In an interview on Israeli \ntelevision, Bush said that although he was working on a diplomatic solution, he was skeptical that one could be \nfound. When asked about the possible use of force against Iran, Bush said, \"all options are on the table.\"  Although \nmany people doubted the wisdom of the United States launching another military attack in the Middle East when it \nwas already consumed with the situations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the American president seemed to use these \ncases to press home his point that military action was a viable possibility.  Indeed, Bush said, \"The use of force is \nthe last option for any president. You know we have used force in the recent past to secure our country.\"\n\nThroughout, Iran has insisted that its interest in developing a nuclear program has been for peaceful purposes only, \nin order to develop nuclear power.  The United States has accused Iran of carrying out a clandestine program \nintended to ultimately develop nuclear weaponry.\n\nIn September 2005, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based think tank, assessed Iran's \nnuclear, chemical, biological and long-range missile activities and concluded that Iran was still years away from \nbeing able to develop nuclear weapons capability. The assessment also noted that a diplomatic confrontation was \npossible between the European Union and the United States on the issue.  This was because the European body \nhas been leading diplomatic talks with Iran, and this report could very well enforce the argument that a deliberative \napproach would be feasible, given the lack of nuclear development by Iran. The assessment also pointed to Iran's \npolitical restraint in the recent past, which has included shutting down its nuclear activities while ensconced in talks \nwith the European Union.  Finally, the assessment noted that Iran could well be attempting to avoid international \nreaction and recrimination, and as such, they may decide to develop their nuclear capabilities over a much longer \ntime horizon.\n\nAlso in September 2005, following remarks by Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  that Iran had an inalienable \nright to produce nuclear energy, speculation abounded that the country would be referred by the United Nations \nwatchdog atomic agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to the United Nations Security Council.  \nSuch a referral could potentially result in  sanctions against Iran.  Iran's leadership in Tehran warned that such a \nmove could result in its decision to begin  uranium enrichment, in addition to the uranium conversion process, which \nit had already resumed.  Tehran has also noted that there is a double standard regarding the countries that have \nbeen allowed to become nuclear powers.  This was a position likely to be appreciated by other members of the \nglobal community, and in spite of opposition from the West.\n\nHamid Reza Asefi, a spokesperson for the  Iranian Foreign Ministry, noted that Iran did not seek to pursue nuclear \nenrichment activities in the near future, however, if the IAEA undertook radical measures, it would be forced to \nrespond in a corresponding manner.  The spokesperson also said that  Iran was \"deaf to the language of threats.\"\n\nLater in September 2005, a resolution passed by the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, the International \nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), essentially paved the way for Iran to be referred to the United Nations Security \nCouncil.  In response, Iran characterized  the resolution  as \"illegal.\"  In the voting of the resolution, a majority of \ncountries voted against Iran. These countries included  European countries, which had earlier been mediating an \nend to Iran's nuclear development, as well as India, a country which has usually enjoyed close bilateral ties with \nIran. Russia and China opposed the motion and abstained from voting,  and Venezuela voted against it. Iran's \nforeign ministry accused the United States of placing pressure on other countries to vote for the motion.  Iranian \nofficials in Tehran also maintained that its nuclear activities were not in violation of the Nuclear Non Proliferation \nTreaty and that its nuclear program was intended only for peaceful purposes.  Still, Tehran warned that if it was \nreferred to the United Nations Security Council, it could well respond by starting a process of uranium enrichment, \nand it could also terminate IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities and activities.\n\n\n\nIn October 2005, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad attended a conference in Tehran  titled \"The World Without \nZionism.\"  There, in front of about 3,000 students, he  asserted the view that Israel's establishment had been a \nmove by the West against the Islamic world.\n\nBut it was his statement that Israel be wiped off the map that evoked outcry and harsh criticism from many countries \nacross the world. His actual words were, \"As the Imam [Iran's late revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah \nKhomeini] said, Israel must be wiped off the map.\"\n\nIn response, the European Union, Russia and Canada expressed their condemnation.  The United States said that \nthe comment illustrated why there should be concern about Iran's nuclear program.  For its part, Israel called for \nIran to be expelled from the United Nations.  The United Nations Security Council issued its own statement \ncondemning President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad over his comments.\n\nIran then explained that its president's remarks were not a threat against Israel and not intended to express a \npotential attack on Israel. The Foreign Ministry of Iran also said that it respected the United Nations charter and that \nit was not threatening the use of force. Iranian officials also were quick to point out that as harsh as the rhetoric \nmight have been, there was nothing particularly new about the words uttered by the Iranian president since they \nwere the slogan of the 1979  revolution.  They also accused the international media of not presenting President \nAhmadinejad's words in proper context.\n\nThe rapid response from Iran showed the country's desire to prevent alienation from the international community.  \nThe incident, in its own way, also managed to elicit something of an assertion from Iran that it would not attack \nIsrael -- the first assertion of this kind ever.\n\nIn the first week of November 2005, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator and the Secretary of Iran's Supreme National \nSecurity Council, Ali Larijani,  issued a letter to the United Kingdom, France and Germany, calling for the \nresumption of talks regarding its program of nuclear development.  The letter welcomed constructive and logical \nnegotiations.  No official response from the United Kingdom, France and Germany was immediately forthcoming. \nTalks with the three European countries, known as the \"EU3,\"  had stalled in August 2005 when Iran resumed \nuranium conversion activities.  Observers speculated that the overture from Iran had been sparked by the recent \nfallout from the intemperate remarks by President Ahmadinejad regarding  Israel. The international outrage, \nmanifest symbolically by the cancellation of talks by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, may have \nsignaled a warning to Iran that such destructive rhetoric would not pave the way toward further integration with the \ninternational community.\n\nGeopolitical Situation in 2006\n\nWorld powers commenced meetings in London in mid-January 2006 to discuss how to deal with Iran following its \ndecision to resume nuclear development.  The issue of Iran's nuclear development program escalated after Iran \nbroke the seals on a nuclear facility, ending a two-year moratorium on nuclear research.  The United States (U.S.), \nthe United Kingdom (U.K.), France, Russia, China and Germany were set to consider the strategy pertaining to the \nescalating diplomatic impasse with Iran.  On the table has been the question of whether or not to apply economic \nsanctions.\n\nEarlier the U.K., France and Germany said that ongoing talks with Iran over its controversial nuclear development \nprogram had reached a \"dead end\" and called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations' (U.N.) nuclear \nwatchdog group, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  Indeed, the three European countries began \nwork drafting a resolution to submit to the  IAEA that demanded that Iran to be referred to the  U.N. Security \nCouncil, which has the power to enact economic sanctions.  U.K. Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said that the \nresponsibility resided with Iran to reassure the international community about its intentions.  To this end he said, \n\"The onus is on Iran to act to give the international community confidence that its nuclear program has exclusively \npeaceful purposes.\"  He also warned that trust had been \"sorely undermined by its [Iran's]  history of concealment \nand deception.\"\n\n\n\nWhile the U.S. was expected to strongly back such a resolution, there have been anxieties about whether or not \nChina and Russia would support it. Russian President Vladimir Putin noted that compromise was still possible.  He \nsaid that Iran had not rejected a Russian offer by which the enrichment of uranium would be provided by Russia for \nIran's nuclear program.  Such an arrangement would effectively prevent Iran from actually making nuclear \nweapons.  Despite Russia's own interests in Iran's nuclear industry, however, Western diplomats have hinted that \nRussia would not ultimately stand in the way of sanctions.  Russia, however, did not appear enthused about the \nprospects of moving quickly in the direction of sanctions.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, \"The \nquestion of sanctions against Iran puts the cart before the horse. Sanctions are in no way the best, or the only, way \nto solve the problem.\"  For its part, China has presented more of a challenge and has continued to be reticent \nabout the notion of  sanctions, perhaps due to its own energy interests.  Indeed, the Chinese Foreign Ministry \nissued a statement saying, \"All relevant sides should remain restrained and stick to resolving the Iranian nuclear \nissue through negotiations.\"\n\nBy January 17, 2006, the U.K. appeared to have hardened its own stance, rejecting  both Iran's offer to return to the \nnegotiating table as well as the Russian compromise. Instead, the U.K., France and Germany said that they would \nask for a meeting with the IAEA in early February 2006. After looking back on the past years of negotiations, these \nEuropean countries concluded that the time had been spent by Iran on  further development of its uranium \nenrichment capability, to the extent that traces of weapons-grade uranium had been found on centrifuges.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Union Foreign Policy head, Javier Solana, was  meeting with United Nations Secretary \nGeneral Kofi Annan in New York to discuss the matter.  As well, Mohammed ElBaradei, the head of the IAEA, was \nmeeting with United States Under-Secretary of State Robert Joseph in Vienna regarding Iran.  For his part, \nElBaradei warned that his patience with Iran was running thin.  After three years of intensive efforts, he remained \nunable to conclude whether or not Iran's nuclear program has been aimed purely at energy creation, as the Iranian \ngovernment has claimed, rather than at the proliferation of nuclear weapons, as many in the West have feared.\n\nIran has steadfastly denied that it wishes to develop nuclear weaponry. Indeed, in a rare press conference in the \ncapital city of Tehran in mid-January 2006,  President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad even said that Iran did not need \nnuclear weapons.  He went on to note that nuclear arsenals were needed by people who \"want to solve everything \nthrough the use of force.\" Instead, he maintained the position that Iran had the right to develop nuclear technology.\n\nIt has been this issue -- of Iran's right to develop nuclear technology -- that requires a bit more attention.  For Iran, \nand other countries whose sovereign roots have been growing stronger in the post-independence phase of national \ndevelopment, there is a need to assert selfhood and sovereignty on par with other countries in the global \ncommunity.  International actors and agencies seeking to constrain that \"right\" have thusly found themselves \nensconced in escalating imbroglios, often infused with the spirit of identity politics.  Why should the West have the \nright to nuclear power when Iran cannot?  Why should India and Israel be allowed to have nuclear programs while \nIran does not? Certainly, there has been little public criticism in recent years of the nuclear programs of Israel and \nIndia. Still, neither Israel nor India has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and, as such, neither country is \nbound by its provisions as Iran happens to be.  Moreover, both India and Israel are functioning democracies with \nlegacies of peaceful transitions of power.  As such, they are deemed to be less threatening to global insecurity and \ninstability in comparison with countries such as Iran and North Korea.\n\nIn his press conference, the Iranian president also accused some leaders of the West of having faulty logic on the \nnuclear issue.  To this end he said, \"Leaders who believe they can create peace for themselves by creating war for \nothers are mistaken.\" He also noted that some leaders had \"medieval mindsets\" and wished to deprive Iran of \nvaluable technology, without any evidence that his country had committed any wrongdoing.\n\nWhile this stance may resonate with others in the developing world who do not wish to be bullied by the West, \nsupport for Iran's position has been severely undercut by a series of rather intemperate remarks by  President \nAhmadinejad as regards Israel.  Since coming to power, the Iranian leader has said that \"Israel must be wiped off \nthe map.\"  He also appeared to question the truth of the Jewish holocaust saying, \"They have created a myth today \nthey call the massacre of Jews  and they consider it a principle about God, religions and the prophets.\" Such \n\n\n\nrhetoric has been reminiscent of the late leader of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini who said, \n\"Every Muslim has a duty to prepare himself for battle against Israel.\"  Even Iranian so-called reformists, such as Ali \nAkbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami, have uttered anti-Israel rhetoric.\n\nFollowing on the path of these words, some have concluded that ideological differences lie at the heart of the \nnuclear issue in Iran.  They have argued that popular support for an independent Palestinian state has fueled the \nhard-line position of the Iranian government over the years, and has spurred the vitriol against Israel, and by \nextension, the West.  Still, Iran has never actually gone to war with Israel.  Moreover, in recent years, anti-Israel \nranting has found little resonance among Iranian youth despite the regularity with which it occurs. Iranians today are \nconcerned about democratic rights that have never been realized, the economy, and the problem of \nunemployment.  These frustrations were manifest in the 2002 labor protests.  Meanwhile, it has become \nincreasingly common to hear Iranians say, \"Forget Palestine, what about us?\" Still, in a country that can hardly be \nregarded as a democracy, such dissonance is not likely to result in any policy shift from the Supreme Leader or the \nGuardian Council, which hold the real power in Iranian politics and society and whose positions are stultified.  As a \nresult, leaders have continued to regularly emit vituperative pieces on the evils of the state of Israel, while the \nIranian citizens have increasingly ignored them.\n\nThe eroding connection between the people and the leaders of Iran notwithstanding, it is a common sense of \nIranian identity -- of patriotism and national pride --  that unites people in their belief that Iran should have the right \nto nuclear research and development, without interference from the West.  Bolstered with popular backing for its \nnuclear plans, it is unlikely that Iran will be easily cowed into submission by international pressure. With Europe, led \nby the U.K., France and Germany, recommending action in the form of sanctions by the U.N. Security Council, the \nmatter is sure to become increasingly complex. In anticipation of such a threat, Iran has warned that the imposition \nof economic sanctions would  result in higher oil prices.  Indeed, Iranian Economy Minister Davoud Danesh-Jafari \nsaid: \"Any possible sanctions on Iran... could possibly, by disturbing Iran's political and economic situation, raise oil \nprices beyond levels the West expects.\" As a result, there was increasing anxiety about the possible repercussions \non the global oil market.\n\nWith time running out in late January 2006, the European Union said that it would agree to meet with Iran a final \ntime to try to resolve the impasse over Iran's nuclear program.  Still, a spokesperson from the government of the \nU.K. said that Europe still held its position that the time had come for the U.N. Security Council to become involved.  \nSuch involvement would likely come in the form of economic sanctions.\n\nDuring separate meetings in London, foreign ministers from Europe -- the U.K., France and Germany -- were also \nscheduled to meet with counterparts from the United States, Russia and China to discuss a coordinated response \nto the same matter. Again, Moscow and Beijing argued for more time to resolve the matter with Iran, however, \nneither of the two countries foreclosed the possibility of the IAEA referring Iran to the U.N. Security Council in \nanticipation of possible economic sanctions.  There was still some hope that the Russian compromise (discussed \nabove) might come in to play. Whether or not the Russian compromise was actually advanced, however, U.K. \nForeign Secretary Jack Straw noted that a resolution would have to offer Iran to come out of the negotiations with \nits national dignity in tact.  To this end he said, \"We must have a bargain which enables both sides to come out of it \nwith their head held high.\"  He also emphasized the position held by the Europeans that the impasse with Iran must \nbe resolved diplomatically and not via military action.\n\nOn February 4, 2006, the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, voted to report Iran to the U.N. Security Council \nregarding its nuclear activities.  The actual resolution at stake specified that Iran should extend \"indispenable and \noverdue\" cooperation with the IAEA intended to \"clarify possible activities which could have a military dimension.\" \nThe vote came after several days of intense diplomatic negotiations and was expected to eventually lead to the \nimplementation of sanctions against Iran.\n\nTwenty seven countries on the board of the IAEA voted in support of reporting Iran, five countries abstained, and \nthree countries  voted against the measure.  Russia and China voted in favor of the resolution after being given \nassurances that there would be no immediate threat of sanctions against Iran.\n\n\n\nIndeed, the resolution also deferred any possible action by the United Nations Security Council until the delivery of \na report by the head of the IAEA, Mohamed ElBaradei, on Iranian compliance.  The report was set to be delivered \non March 6, 2006.\n\nSome observers suggested that the overwhelming vote in support of the resolution by the IAEA board showed \nstrong and shared support for the measure.  Certainly, U.S. ambassador to the IAEA, Gregory Schulte, said that the \nvote conveyed a \"very powerful signal\"  and intimated that Iran's response would be telling. Likewise, U.S. \nSecretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, said that the U.S. hoped that Iran would take seriously the \"clear message\" \nfrom the IAEA. But  Javad Vaiedi, the deputy head of the Supreme National Security Council, observed that the \nvote was politically motivated and did not, in fact,  reflect a high level of  international consensus.\n\nFollowing the decision to report Iran to the U.N.Security Council, the Iranian authorities in Tehran maintained that its \nnuclear development efforts were  not for military objectives.  Tehran then went on to assert that its uranium \nenrichment activities would resume.  As well, Iranian President  Ahmadinejad warned that in response to the \nresolution of the IAEA, volutary cooperation with the IAEA would be halted. A day later on February 5, 2006, Tehran \ndeclared its intent to stop snap inspections at its nuclear facilities.\n\nBy February 6, 2006, U.S. Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, asserted that all options, including military action \nagainst Iran, remained on the proverbial table as a possible option.\n\nIn response,  the Russia's foreign minister warned against such threats and the Russian government was expected \nto resume negotiations on the aforementioned compromise plan. Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov \nsaid that he was optimistic that Tehran would seriously consider the proposal as a means of moving forward. As \nwell, Egypt was considering putting forth a proposal by which the Middle East would be a nuclear weapon free \nzone.\n\nMeanwhile, markets responded to the latest developments with a rise on oil prices as anxieties increased about \npossible disruptions in oil from Iran, which is OPEC's second-largest supplier.\n\nIn mid-February 2006, diplomats from the United Nations said  that Iran had restarted the process of uranium \nenrichment, as evidenced by the feeding of uranium gas into centrifuges.  Uranium enrichment is the preliminary  \nstep in the process leading to the production of  fuel for nuclear reactors and bomb-making. The move was \nanticipated since Iranian authorities in Tehran had earlier warned of the resumption of enrichment activities after the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported the country to  the United Nations Security Council. Since \nthen, Tehran has likewise warned that it will also cease cooperation with United Nations nuclear inspectors seeking \nto carry out  snap inspections at nuclear facilities.\n\nIn a further development, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said that he was considering withdrawing \nfrom the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NNPT).  If Iran moves forward with this measure, it will join North Korea \nto form a duet of countries which have abandoned the NNPT and resumed nuclear development in recent years.\n\nThe situation devolved further when Tehran indefinitely postponed talks with Moscow regarding the compromise \nplan for Russia to provide enriched uranium to Iran for its nuclear energy program.\n\nNevertheless, by late February 2006, Tehran moved in a more cooperative direction and said that it would be willing \nto move forward with discussion aimed at exploring the Russian compromise proposal.  While Tehran was not \nexpected to acquiesce to the Russian proposal completely, the return to the negotiating table suggested some \nsmall shift in the nuclear impasse.\n\nThe matter evoked questions about how to strike the correct balance between the right of counties to have nuclear \ntechnology with the right of the international community to limit the proliferation of nuclear weaponry across the \nglobe.\n\n\n\nIn the backdrop of these developments was a story published by the London Daily Telegraph, which intimated that \nPentagon strategists were making plans to launch attacks against  Iran's nuclear sites.  Such attacks would be \nundertaken as measures of \"last resort\" for the purpose of foreclosing any possibility that Teheran might try develop \nnuclear weaponry. While the White House in the United States has said that it would prefer to handle the matter \nusing diplomatic channels, President George W. Bush has not ruled out the possibility of military action.\n\nIn March 2006, Mohamed ElBaradei,  the head of the IAEA,  called on both Iran and the West to return to the \nnegotiating table to discuss Iran's nuclear development program.  He cautioned that there would be long-term \nimplications for global peace.  In this regard, he said, \"It has to do with regional security, the whole Middle East \nregional security is very much at stake and escalation is not going to help.\" ElBaradei  spoke at the commencement \nof an IAEA meeting that could herald United Nations Security Council action against Iran for its uranium enrichment \nactivities.\n\nIran announced on April 11, 2006 that it had succeeded in enriching uranium on a small scale for the first time.  The \nenrichment process used 164 centrifuges at a facility in Natanz. Iranian President Ahmadinejad characterized the \noccasion as a \"very historic moment\" and noted that it signified \"the start of the progress of the country.\"  As he had \nbefore,  he called on the West to respect Iran's  right to pursue the development of nuclear technology for peaceful \npurposes.\n\nIt was a position steadfastly opposed by the U.S., which asserted that Iran should not have any kind of nuclear \ndevelopment program. U.S.  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice responded to the news by warning that the U.N. \nSecurity Council would examine available options aimed at forcing Iran to \"obey the international system.\"\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said that Iran's decision to enrich uranium, albeit on a small-scale basis, \n\"further undermines international confidence in the regime and is deeply unhelpful.\"  China expressed concern \nabout the path Iran was taking, but was believed to be against taking drastic action against Iran, preferring a \ndiplomatic solution. Likewise, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Iran was moving \"in the wrong \ndirection,\" however,  he cautioned against unduly dramatizing the situation and again noted that Moscow was \nagainst military action against Iran.\n\nThe news from Iran came around the same time as public attention was drawn to an article in the New Yorker \nmagazine by Seymour Hersch, which asserted that the United States military was drawing up plans to use military \naction in Iran that included the possible use of nuclear weaponry. For his part, United States President George W. \nBush said he would not rule out the military option in dealing with Iran.\n\nMeanwhile, Mohamed ElBaradei, the head of the IAEA, was set to travel to Tehran to discuss the crisis.  ElBaradei \nwas scheduled to report back to the United Nations Security Council at the close of April 2006 regarding Tehran's \ncompliance with the demand to halt enrichment activity by the close of April, or face the consequence of \ninternational isolation. United Nations  Secretary General Kofi Annan expressed hope on April 12, 2006 that IAEA \nhead would be able to bring Iran back to the negotiating table. But the  mid-April 2006 to Tehran by the head of the \nIAEA, Mohamed ElBaradei, failed to change Iran's position. Still, the nuclear watchdog chief said that an agreement \nwas in place to continue dialogue on the issue.\n\nThe notion of dialogue was echoed on April 16, 2006 in the bipartisan call by members of the U.S. Senate for direct \nbilateral talks between the United States and Iran. Richard Lugar of Indiana, the Republican Chairman of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, said it was too soon to press for sanctions and noted that direct bilateral talks \nwould be \"useful.\" He said, \"The Iranians are a part of the energy picture. We need to talk about that.\"  Democratic \nSenator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut expressed a similar sentiment saying, \"I happen to believe you need \ndirect talks. It doesn't mean you agree with them.... But there's an option.\" The position expressed by these \nSenators was at odds with the unilateral demands articulated by the executive branch of government in the United \nStates.\n\nAccording to Iranian authorities, the country operated 164 centrifuges, thus enabling  \"industrial output\" of enriched \nuranium. However, the process only created low-level enrichment needed for nuclear fuel. In order to create the \n\n\n\nhighly enriched uranium needed for nuclear weapons, Iran would need thousands of centrifuges. Various sources \nhave thusly said that Iran will not be immediately capable of making a nuclear bomb. Some predictions were as \nshort as within a year; others suggested a ten-year timeline. The London-based International Institute of Strategic \nStudies has said that Iran could produce enough fissile nuclear material to make a nuclear bomb within 3 years.\n\nIn late April 2006, just days before a deadline issued by the U.N. for Iran to halt its nuclear program, the \ngovernment in Tehran said that its uranium enrichment and nuclear research activities were  \"irreversible.\" As well, \nHamid Reza Asefi, a spokesperson for the country's Foreign Ministry said that demands for Iran to stop its nuclear \nresearch were \"not on the agenda.\"\n\nLeading up to the April 28, 2006 deadline, diplomatic efforts intesified with some countries calling for a less \nconfrontational stance in negotiations on Iran's controversial nuclear program.  To this end, the U.S. Department of \nState gave permission to U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, to convene direct talks with Iran.  Although \nthe talks were to be oriented toward Iran-Iraq relations, the opening up of dialogue was viewed as a step away from \nthe hardline approach taken so far by the U.S. in regard to Iran.\n\nIn addition, efforts by the Russians were underway to revist the compromise concept of Iranian uranium enrichment \non Russian territory.\n\nBy the close of April 2006, although Iran stood firm in its expressed right to pursue nuclear enrichment, the \ngovernment said that it would allow IAEA inspectors to monitor nuclear sites if the U.N. Security Council did not \nintervene.\n\nThe U.S. dismissed the offer by Iran, stating that Iran would have to entirely give up its nuclear ambitions and \nwithout that, debate would now have to be taken up by the  U.N. Security Council. U.S. Secretary of State, \nCondoleezza Rice, said on April 30, 2006 that Iran was \"playing games\" and that the  U.S. would pursue a  U.N. \nresolution requiring Iran to comply with demands that it cease its uranium enrichment activities.  Rice also \nreferenced Chapter 7 of the U.N.charter, which provides for enforcement via penalties or military action.  Echoing a \npreviously stated position of the Bush administration prior to the invasion of Iraq, she noted that the credibility of the \nU.N. was at stake.  Rice said, \"The international community's credibility is at stake here. And we have a choice, too. \nWe can either mean what we say, when we say that Iran must comply, or we can continue to allow Iran to defy.\"\n\nEconomic sanctions were the most likely route anticipated as regards Iran's non-compliance.\n\nThe  U.S. and its European allies had earlier advanced the notion of sanctions after the IAEA confirmed that Iran \nhad successfully produced enriched uranium and later defied the U.N. Security Council's deadline to cease such \nactivities. But punitive responses, such as sanctions, have constituted a route that two U.N. Security Council \npermanent members -- Russia and China -- have been reticent about supporting.\n\nFor its part, Iran has said that it does not believe that the U.N. would impose sanctions and it has also warned \nabout the possible effects on the price of oil globally.  Meanwhile, in Tehran, a spokesperson for the country's \nForeign Ministry, Hamid Reza Asefi,  said that his country sough to resolve the matter through diplomatic means \nand not as a result of pressure and threats.\n\nIn other nuclear developments, Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad earlier announed that Iran was testing a \nmore advanced centrifuge, known as a P-2, which can quickly enrich uranium.  This announcement did little to \nassuage fears by the West that Iran's ultimate goal is to develop nuclear weaponry.\n\nIn May 2006, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad delivered a letter to the  U.S. presidency via the Swiss \nembassy in Tehran.  An Iranian spokesperson said that the letter contained \"new solutions for getting out of \ninternational problems and the current fragile situation of the world.\"  Hopes for a positive shift in relations, and \nparticularly, as regards Iran's controversial nuclear program, were quickly dashed when  U.S.Secretary of State \nCondoleezza Rice dismissed the letter.  Rice said, \"There's nothing in here that would suggest that we're on any \n\n\n\ndifferent course than we were before we got the letter.\" The White House likewise noted that there was nothing in \nthe letter that substantially addressed its concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions.\n\nOn June 1, 2006, an agreement was reached regarding a unified approach by the world's most powerful countries \nto Iran's burgeoning nuclear program.  The agreement was forged during a meeting in Vienna, Austria and was \nattended by the foreign ministers of the U.K., France, Russia, China and the United States -- all of whom are United \nNations Security Council permanent members. The meeting also included the foreign minister of Germany as well \nas the European Union foreign policy chief.\n\nThe unified approach called on Iran to stop sensitive nuclear research and apparently included both penalties and \nincentives.  The actual details of the \"carrot and stick\" plan were not immediately disclosed because officials said \nthat the proposal package had to be first presented to Iran for consideration.\n\nNevertheless, British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said, \"We are prepared to resume negotiations should \nIran resume suspension of all enrichment related and reprocessing activities as required by the IAEA and we would \nalso suspend action in the Security Council.\" Beckett also warned, \"We have also agreed that if Iran decides not to \nengage in negotiation, further steps would have to be taken in the Security Council ... We urge Iran to take the \npositive path and to consider seriously our substantive proposals which would bring significant benefits.\"\n\nIn the past, Russia and China had opposed punitive measures against Iran while the  U.S. has said that if Iran \nrefused to halt its nuclear enrichment activities, it would be referred to the U.N. Security Council.  The current \nclimate of consensus was, thus, quite a shift in positioning for all three countries.\n\nIn the case of the  U.S., its shift in stance may have been motivated by the need for unwavering Russian support.  \nAs such, the  U.S. agreed to the language in the draft U.N. Security Council resolution that would foreclose an \nimmediate threat of military strikes against Iran.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who had a day earlier announced that Washington was offering direct \ntalks with Tehran, noted that if talks or sanctions did not work, however, military options remained on the table.  \nStill, the State Department appeared to be conveying the message that it was willing to moderate its position in \norder to move the negotiations with Iran forward. Officials in Washington were also urging Iran not to make a quick \nreactive decision, instead calling on Tehran to examine not only the proposal package forged by the joint powers, \nbut also to consider what might seriously be regarded as a policy shift from the White House.\n\nBy June 2, 2006, the message from Washington was not entirely unified when the Director of National Intelligence, \nJohn Negroponte, said in an interview with the British media (BBC Radio) that Iran could have a nuclear bomb \nready within 10 years. He also accused Iran of being a state sponsor on terrorism.  It was not clear whether or not \nthis message had been coordinated with the top officials at the White House.\n\nThere was no immediate response by Iran to the news of the proposal package.  Instead, on June 2, 2006, Iranian \nPresident Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  said that Tehran would not relinquish its right to nuclear technology as a result \nof Western pressure.  It was essentially the same message that the Iranian leadership had been articulating for \nsome time and so there was some worry that the new approach may have been an exercise in futility. But U.N. \nSecretary General Kofi Annan reportedly called President Ahmadinejad to personally ask him to consider the \nproposal at hand.  As well, European Union foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, was expected to personally deliver \nthe proposal to the Iranian government.\n\nA few days later,\n\nAhmadinejad said in a public speech that although he would not bargain away Iran's independence, he did intend \nto examine the plan to determine whether or not it fit with the national interest.  He also said, \"We will not pass \njudgment on the proposals hastily.\"  The Iranian president's public statement that serious consideration of  the \nproposal would be given marked a departure his previously unequivocal stance.\n\n\n\nOn June 6, 2006,  Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, characterized the proposal package at hand as \n\"constructive\" and said that it contained both \"positive steps\" and \"ambiguities.\" Larijani also said that Europe had \nrightfully tried to resolve the nuclear impasse diplomatically.  He also noted that Iran was open to the resumption of \ntalks aimed at finding a fair and rational solution.  The language used by the Iranian negotiator was deemed to be \nencouraging, even conciliatory, and generally free of the customary rhetoric that had previously led to headlines \naround the world. Western diplomats expressed satisfaction with the encouraging nature of Iran's initial response.\n\nOn June 12, 2006, the board of the IAEA  was set to debate Tehran's controversial nuclear development program.  \nThe IAEA board was also expected to examine the most recent report on Iran by the Director-General, Mohammed \nElBaradei. Iran's envoy to the IAEA called for a \"constructive debate\" just as members of the U.N. nuclear \nwatchdog group prepared to meet in Vienna.  The envoy also asked that there not be any \"repetitive allegations,\" \nwhich might cause a deterioration of the situation at hand.\n\nAt the close of August 2006, a report by the IAEA  stated that Iran ignored the deadline to cease work on its nuclear \nprogram. Findings from the IAEA report, which was yet to be officially released, said that Iran continued  to enrich \nuranium well past the deadline for which such nuclear activities should have stopped.  Indeed, a source familiar with \nthe report apparently suggested that Iran commenced a new phase of uranium enrichment just ahead of the August \n31, 2006 deadline. The leaked report further asserted that Iran had not satisfactorily met the assessment \nrequirements of the IAEA regarding the country's nuclear program.  To that end, the report stated, \"Iran has not \naddressed the long outstanding verification issues or provided the necessary transparency to remove uncertainties \nassociated with some of its activities.\"\n\nThat said, there was no conclusive evidence ensconced in the report that Iran's nuclear program was \"of a military \nnature,\" or oriented toward weapons development and proliferation.\n\nIran's intransigence on the nuclear issue was manifest recently in President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's repeated \ndeclaration that his country would not bow in any way to international pressure.  Iran has insisted that its nuclear \nprogram has been developed for peaceful purposes, despite allegations by the U.S. that Iran was attempting to \ndevelop nuclear weaponry.\n\nJohn Bolton, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said that the IAEA report offered clear evidence of the untenable \nnature of Iran's position.  For his part, U.S. President George W. Bush has often warned that Iran would suffer \nconsequences for continuing its nuclear activities in the face of IAEA restrictions. To this end, the U.S. has \nadvocated  the imposition of sanctions against Iran -- a measure that would require consensus among the veto-\nwielding permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.\n\nSince the passage of the deadline to halt enrichment activities in conjunction with the IAEA report, France -- one of \nthe permanent members of the U.N. Security Council --\n\nexpressed regret about Iran's unyielding stance. French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin said, \"We cannot \naccept that Iran does not respect commitments it has made in the past.\"  Whether or not France's regret over Iran's \nrefusal to halt its nuclear activities would translate into a vote in favor of sanctions, as demanded by the U.S., was \nyet to be determined.  Meanwhile, there was little sign that Russia and China -- two other permanent members of \nthe U.N. Security Council -- had shifted their shared position that the mode of response be characterized by \npatience, rather than punishment.\n\nWith Iran's nuclear program at the forefront of the international purview, Javier Solana, the European Union (EU) \nforeign policy chief, was to convene meetings in Germany on September 9, 2006 with Ali Larijani, the chief nuclear \nnegotiator for Iran.  That date would precede scheduled negotiations between multilateral Western parties and \nTehran on a proposed package of incentives for Iran, aimed at halting its nuclear activities.  It was not known \nwhether this package would be well-received by Iran, given the fact the uncompromising position taken by the \ncountry's leadership.\n\n\n\nOn September 14, 2006, the IAEA  branded a United States government report on Iran's nuclear program to be \n\"erroneous\"  and \"misleading.\"  The IAEA was referring to a leaked congressional report that apparently contained \nseveral distortions of the nuclear agency's own assessments regarding the nuclear development activities of Iran.  \nIn particular, the IAEA said that a claim in the report regarding the removal of a safeguard inspector did not reflect \nthe true nature of the situation.  In a protest letter sent by the IAEA, the contention by the congressional report that \nInspector Chris Charlier was removed for  failing to  abide by \"an unstated IAEA policy barring IAEA officials from \ntelling the whole truth\" about Iran was condemned as being \"outrageous and dishonest.\" Equally significant, \nhowever, was the congressional report's assertion that Iran had enriched some weapons' grade uranium -- a direct \ncontradiction of the IAEA's finding that only small amounts of uranium, enriched a lower levels, had actually been \nfound.\n\nIn October 2006, Iran rejected the demands by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and \nGermany to suspend its uranium enrichment activities.  The six countries convened discussions in the United \nKingdom regarding Iran's refusal to stop its nuclear activities and to consider the possible implementation of \nsanctions. For its part, Iran said via its Foreign Ministry, \"The suspension is completely unacceptable and we have \nrejected it.\" Iran also dismissed the threat of sanctions, stating, \"The threat of sanctions is an inefficient means to \nachieve a solution.\"\n\nAs a result of these latest developments, a debate at the U.N. was expected to take place.  At issue on the agenda \nwould be possible measures to be undertaken under the aegis of Article 41 of Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which \nallows  the Security Council to employ non-military means, such as sanctions, to augment its decisions.  The nature \nof such action was likely to be the subject of heated debate.  Indeed, there has been no consensus among the five \npermanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany about what type of sanctions to impose on Iran.  \nWhile the  U.S. was in favor of punitive measures, Russia and China said that they would not support drastic \naction.\n\nOn December 23, 2006, the U.N. Security Council unanimously passed a resolution authorizing sanctions against \nIran, on the basis of that country's controversial nuclear program.  The resolution demanded an end to all uranium \nenrichment work in Iran, banned both the importation and exportation of nuclear material to and from Iran, froze \nsome of the country's overseas assets, and threatened further non-military sanctions.\n\nWhile the resolution disallowed nuclear trade with Iran, the  U.S. complained that the ban was not sufficiently \nstringent.  More strongly-worded draft resolutions were rejected, however, by other U.N. Security Council members, \nincluding China and Russia, both of whom hold veto power.\n\nA day later, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad reacted by rejecting the resolution, dismissing it as only \"a \npiece of paper.\"  The Iranian leader noted that the 15 countries on the U.N. Security Council, which had voted in \nfavor of sanctions, would regret their actions.  He also said that the move by the U.N. meant that the West had \nsquandered its opportunity to improve relations with his country.  Nevertheless, President Ahmadinejad declared \nthat Iran was now an established nuclear state and that it was in the West's best interest \"to live alongside the \nIranian nation.\"\n\nRhetoric aside, Iran announced that it intended to immediately commence the installation of  3,000 centrifuges at a \nuranium enrichment plant at Natanz.  It [the installation of thousands of centrifuges] was a move that could indicate \nintent to enrich uranium for nuclear weaponry. Meanwhile, in Iran's parliament, a clear majority approved \nemergency legislation directing the government to review Iran's relationship with the IAEA.\n\nGeopolitical Situation in 2007\n\nOn February 5, 2007, it was reported that Iran was installing two cascades of 164 centrifuges (328 in total) at an \nunderground atomic facility.  Infrastructure construction was completed at that facility, which could expand Iran's \nnuclear program  an \"industrial scale\" into the arena of enrichment. It was suggested that the cascades would be \ndry-spun and then subsequently be fed with uranium feedstock gas.\n\nThe news came ahead of a formal announcement by the Iranian government set for February 11, 2007.\n\n\n\nDiplomats from the European Union confirmed similar accounts of these activities in Iran, with one noting that this \ndirection was the opposite hoped for by the United Nations Security Council.  Meanwhile, the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency (IAEA) offered  no comment.\n\nOn February 21, 2007, as the deadline expired for Iran to suspend its nuclear activities, President Ahmadinejad \nsaid that his country aimed to achieve nuclear capability as soon as possible.  At the same time, the Iranian \ngovernment again denied claims by the United States that it was seeking nuclear weaponry, asserting once again \nthat its program was for peaceful means.  The government also said that it was open to talks on the matter.\n\nThat said, the Iranian government was faced, for the first time, with opposition not only from the international \ncommunity, but now from within its own midst.  Indeed, a small reformist political party, the Islamic Revolutionary \nMujahadin Organization,  called for Ahmadinejad to accept the U.N.'s demand to halt its nuclear activities and \nmissile program.  It also accused the government of endangering national security, the national interests, and the \nsafety of the Iranian people, by advancing its nuclear ambitions.  The position of the Islamic Revolutionary \nMujahadin Organization marked the first time that the government's nuclear policy has been openly and assertively \nbeen challenged.\n\nIn the background of these developments was the aforementioned December 2006 U.N. resolution that imposed \nsanctions on Iran, and paved the way for tougher measures to be implemented.  The U.N. nuclear watchdog group, \nthe IAEA, was set to report that Iran missed the aforementioned deadline and effectively defied the ultimatum \nimposed by the international community.\n\nOn March 24, 2007, the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council voted in favor of new sanctions against Iran, as a \nresult of its continued nuclear activities.\n\nThe fresh sanctions both prohibit the export of Iranian arms and freeze the assets of individuals involved in nuclear \nand missile development activities.\n\nIn the aftermath of despite this action by the U.N., Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad characterized the \nsanctions as illegal, and asserted that his country had no intention of stopping its controversial nuclear program.  \nOn the presidential website, Ahmadinejad also warned that Iran would re-assess its ties to those responsible for the \nimposition of the new sanctions. Moreover, Iran said that in would further reduce cooperation with U.N. nuclear \ninspectors, effectively demonstrating continued intransigence on the nuclear issue.\n\nMeanwhile, on March 23, 2007, 15 members of the British Navy were captured by members of Iranian forces.  The \nincident occurred when the British Navy personnel boarded a vessel just off the coast of Iraq on the basis of \nsuspected smuggling activities.  The servicemen from the HMS Cornwall were apparently seized by gunpoint by \nIran's Revolutionary Guard.  British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett demanded both the immediate and safe \nreturn of the servicemen, as well as a \"full explanation\" from Iran about its actions.\n\nThe Iranian government subsequently said that the British Navy had illegally entered Iranian waters.\n\nHowever, the British government countered this claim saying that its Navy personnel were conducting routine \npatrols in Iraqi waters.  To this end, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said, \"It simply is not true that they went into \nIranian territorial waters and I hope the Iranian government understands how fundamental an issue this is for us.\"  \nBlair also characterized the detention of the 15 members of the Royal Navy as \"unjustified and wrong.\"\n\nIt was yet to be seen how Iran would react, given the fact that the diplomatic climate abroad, as well as the political \nclimate at home, were not particularly favorable in March 2007.  First, new sanctions were being imposed by the \nUnited Nations (U.N.) Security Council on Iran in regard to its nuclear program.  As well, students at home were \nreacting to the government's claims about the Royal Navy personnel entry into Iranian waters by calling for them to \nface trial.\n\n\n\nUltimately, despite competing claims by the Iranians and the British about the jurisdiction in which the 15 \nservicemen were picked up, the Iranian government opted not to place the foreigners on trial, and eventually \nreleased them.  The favorable outcome for the 15 Britons appeared to have prevented already-tense relations \nbetween Iran and West from devolving further.\n\nOn April 9, 2007, Iran announced that it had the capacity to produce nuclear fuel on an industrial scale.  In referring \nto the milestone, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said, \"With great honor, I declare that as of today our dear \ncountry has joined the nuclear club of nations and can produce nuclear fuel on an industrial scale.\"  The Iranian \npresident reiterated his claim that Iran had a right to develop its peaceful nuclear program, and warned that Iran \ncould step away from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) if further pressure from the international \ncommunity was brought to bear.  Iran was already subject to United Nation sanctions as a result of  its controversial \nnuclear development program.\n\nAbsent from President Ahmadinejad's speech were details of Iran's nuclear capacity, such as the number of \ncentrifuges that were now operational at the nuclear facility in Natanz.\n\nHowever, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, confirmed that his country had begun the process of injecting \ngas into the centrifuges, and other officials noted that up to 3,000 uranium gas enrichment centrifuges were running \nat the Natanz facility.  The situation promised to further complicate existing tensions between Iran and the West.\n\nIn September 2007,  French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said that the world should prepare for war over the \nIran's atomic activities.  In a media interview, Kouchner observed that while negotiations with Iran should be fully \nexhausted before embarking on a new course, the world should be ready for a worst case scenario if such talks \nwere ultimately unsuccessful.  To this end, he warned, \"We have to prepare for the worst, and the worst is war.\"  He \nalso noted that Iran armed with nuclear weapons would present \"a real danger for the whole world.\"\n\nSignaling that France had taken a position in the debate over Iran burgeoning nuclear program, Kouchner said that \nmany French companies had been asked not to do business with Iraq.  Making clear that no prohibitions had been \nestablished, the French Foreign Minister noted that French enterprises have been advised not to do so.  As well, he \nmade clear that France was in favor of European Union sanctions against Iran.\n\nFrench President Sarkozy had earlier characterized war with Iran as \"catastrophic\" and French Prime Minister Fillon \nnoted that all avenues would be exhausted in resolving the matter diplomatically.\n\nSeptember 23, 2007 saw Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad arrive in the United States to attend the \nmeeting of the United Nations General Assembly, and also to speak at a forum at Columbia University.\n\nAhmadinejad's visit was met with protests, most especially by opponents of his speaking engagement at Columbia \nUniversity.  He had originally intended to lay a wreath at the site of the September 11, 2001 terror attack in New \nYork, however, police cited security concerns in denying that request.\n\nIn a television interview on the American network CBS for the show, \"60 Minutes,\" the Iranian president took a \nmeasured tone  and said that his country was not building nuclear weaponry.  To that end, President Ahmadinejad \nsaid, \"Well, you have to appreciate we don't need a nuclear bomb. We don't need that. What need do we have for a \nbomb?\" He continued,  \"In political relations right now, the nuclear bomb is of no use. If it was useful it would have \nprevented the downfall of the Soviet Union.\"  President Ahmadinejad also noted that Iran was not embarking on a \npath to war with the United States, saying,  \"It's wrong to think that Iran and the U.S. are walking toward war. Who \nsays so? Why should we go to war? There is no war in the offing.\"\n\nThese assertions were a departure from President Ahmadinejad's announcement several days prior in which he \nharshly issued a warning to any countries considering military  attacks against Iran.\n\nIndeed, an Iranian air force official noted that if, in a worse case scenario, Iran was attacked by Israel, it had the \ncapacity to respond with air and missile raids.\n\n\n\nOn the other side of the equation, the Bush administration in the United States repeatedly noted that although it \nintended to deal with Iran diplomatically, all possible options remained on the proverbial table.  Meanwhile, the head \nof United States Central Command, Admiral William Fallon, observed that the emotional rhetoric was not \nproductive.  In an interview with al-Jazeera television, he said, \"This constant drum beat of conflict is what strikes \nme, which is not helpful and not useful.\"\n\nIran and the United States have enjoyed poor relations over the years, and bilateral relations were at an all-time low \nover the United States' opposition to Iran's nuclear ambitions.  Adding to the tensions were the accusations by the \nUnited States that Iran was assisting Shi'ite militias in Iraq.  These allegations were disputed by the Iranian \ngovernment, which assured its Iraqi counterpart that no such actions were ongoing.\n\nIn early November 2007, there was movement toward the drafting of a third resolution at the United Nations \nproviding for economic sanctions against Iran regarding its nuclear program.  A vote in the United Nations Security \nCouncil on the draft resolution was expected to follow, if reports by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  \nand the European Union indicated continuing work on Iran nuclear program.  To that end, a meeting was scheduled \nfor November 19, 2007 of world powers (United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia and China) to \nassess these reports.  A vote on further economic sanctions against Iraq had been scheduled for September 2007 \nbut was delayed until November 2007 to allow the new reports to be considered.\n\nIn the background of these developments was the brewing tensions between IAEA head Mohammed ElBaradei and \nsome of the Western countries.  Whereas ElBaradei has asserted that Iran was years away from developing \nnuclear weaponry, the United States (U.S.)  has said that Iran's desire to enrich uranium instead of importing it at \ncheaper prices made clear that its objective was the development of nuclear weapons.\n\nStill, even as relations between the IAEA and the U.S. were tense over this matter, Iran's  former President \nHashemi Rafsanjan suggested that dialogue between his country and the IAEA was moving forward.\n\nIn December 2007, the latest National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) in the United States concluded that Iran halted its \nweapons program in 2003. The NIE, which coalesces information  from the United States' 16 intelligence agencies, \nasserted \"high confidence\" that Iran stopped its nuclear weapons program in 2003 \"in response to international \npressure.\"  The NIE also expressed \"moderate confidence\" in its view that the nuclear weapons program has not \nsince been restarted.  Still, the NIE assessment noted that although Iran appears \"less determined\" to develop \nnuclear weapons, the Middle Eastern country has continued to enrich uranium.  Indeed, the report stated that Iran \nhad successfully installed centrifuges used for the enrichment of uranium but that \"significant technical problems\" \nprevented the operation of new equipment, and deemed the country unable to have actually manufacture a nuclear \nbomb until the 2010-2015 time period.  Accordingly, the NIE reflected similar findings by the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency (IAEA).  Mohammed ElBaradei, the head of the nuclear watchdog agency, said, \"The report gives \nme a sigh of relief because it is consistent with our assessment.\"\n\nWhile enriched uranium is, indeed, used to manufacture nuclear weapons, Iran has maintained throughout that its \nnuclear ambitions are peaceful and not oriented toward the proliferation of nuclear bombs.  This latest NIE \nassessment appeared to bolster Iran's claims about the peaceful purposes of its nuclear program  -- a point noted \nby IAEA chief ElBaradei who said that  Iran had been \"somewhat vindicated.\"  To that end, Iran's Foreign Minister \nManouchehr Mottaki welcomed the report and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that the NIE findings \nconstituted  \"great victory\" in favor of his country's  stance.  In a speech televised to the country, the Iranian \npresident said that the report was a \"fatal blow\" to those who had stirred the fears and tensions surrounding the \nthreat of nuclear weapons development.\n\nNevertheless, the United States and other Western countries continued to characterize Iran's nuclear development \nas threatening.  With Iran currently subject to both United Nations (U.N.) Security Council sanctions, as well as \nunilateral United States sanctions, there was speculation about how, or if, the sanctions regime would be affected \nby the new information.\n\n\n\nUnited States (U.S.) National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley responded to the report by saying that it confirmed \nhis country's concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions and asserted that President George W. Bush had crafted  \n\"the right strategy\" on Iran.  In fact, he called on the international community to \"turn up the pressure on Iran,\" and \nencouraged the use of tactics such as sanctions and  diplomatic isolation against Iran. For his part, U.S. President \nBush said that the report did not alter either his view or his policy on Iran. Bush said that in spite of the new \nintelligence, Iran was still a threat to the world.  In fact, he said that the report proved that Iran was still trying to \nenrich uranium, and that it was a \"warning signal\" that Iran could very well restart its weapons program.  Confirming \nHadley's statement, Bush said that the NIE was \"an opportunity for us to rally the international community.\"\n\nSome of the countries in the West appeared to respond to the U.S. President's rallying call.  French President \nNicolas Sarkozy said that Iran remained a threat and noted that he supported the notion of further sanctions.  \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel stopped short of calling or new sanctions against Iran, but agreed that Iran \ncontinued to pose a threat.  She appeared to support the ongoing path saying, \"We and our partners would like to \ncontinue with the U.N. process.\"  Merkel also appeared to call for talks and diplomatic negotiations saying, \"I think \nwe and our partners need to continue to seek dialogue with Iran.\"\n\nYet even with support from France and Germany, the problem for the U.S. was that its very position [that Iran poses \na dire danger to the world] was now mitigated by the NIE findings.  That is to say, the NIE evoked grave skepticism \nabout the very essence of U.S. President Bush's claim only a month prior that action against Iran was needed to \nprevent World War III.  Indeed, the tone from the White House in using the hyperbolic language of \"World War III\" \nwas now very likely to be decried as both alarmist and spurious.  Seizing upon this view, Mohammad Ali Hosseini, a \nspokesperson from the Iranian foreign ministry said, \"This report proves Bush's statements - which always speak of \nthe serious threat of Iran's nuclear program - are unreliable and fictitious.\"\n\nIn fact, the most immediate outcome of the NIE has been the collapse of the argument in favor of military action \nagainst Iran.  As noted just above, the NIE findings undercut the notion of an imminent threat posed by Iran's \nnuclear capacity.  While dissonance on the international stage was expected to continue to smolder over the fact \nthat Iran has continued to abrogate U.N. Security Council edicts that it stop its enrichment of uranium, the \ntemperature of the conflict was expected to decrease.\n\nMeanwhile, U.N. Security Council members, Russia and China, were now less likely to support the notion of \nstrongly intensifying sanctions against Iran.  Both countries were expected to argue that the NIE proved that the \nnuclear threat posed by Iran was now contained.  Indeed, in light of the NIE findings, Russian President Vladimir \nPutin's view on the matter appeared quite prescient.  Putin said that there was no \"concrete evidence\" that Iran was \nbuilding a bomb.\n\nAs such, many analysts concluded that the NIE report very likely served to reinvigorare the diplomatic path.  To that \nend, IAEA head, ElBaradei said, \"I see this report as a window of opportunity. It's a window of opportunity because \nit gives diplomacy a new chance.\"\n\nRecent Domestic Issues\n\nIn May 2006, thousands of ethnic Azeris in the north-west of Iran protested a newspaper cartoon.  The cartoon was \npublished in state-owned newspaper and showed people attempting to speak to a cockroach and the insect \nresponding \"What do you mean?\" Azeris -- the most sizable ethnic minority group in Iran -- were outraged that the \ncartoon suggested that they were stupid and that they had been compared to an insect.  Due to the mass outrage, \nthe newspaper was shut down and both the editor and the cartoonist were arrested, however, the outrage was not \neasily quelled.  Attacks on government buildings ensued while several banks and a television station were burned \nto the ground. Meanwhile, there were reports from several cities, such as Ardebil, Naqadeh and Meshkin Shahr, \nstating that the Iranian security forces opened fire on the protestors, causing the deaths of several people, scores of \ncasualties and hundreds of arrests.\n\nKey elections in Iran in December 2006 presented a political setback for Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  \nThe elections were held to decide on the composition of the country's powerful religious entity -- the Assembly of \nExperts -- as well as local government.  Turnout was approximately 60 percent with the best election performances \n\n\n\nbeing enjoyed by moderate conservative candidates, as well as reformist candidates who were experiencing a \npolitical resurgence.\n\nOf particular note was the landslide victory for former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to the Assembly of \nExperts.  Rafsanjani's victory signified a comeback of sorts not only for the former moderate president in the \npolitical realm, but also the renewed popularity of moderate politicians in Iran.  Also of significance was the fact that \nno candidate aligned with current President Ahmadinejad appeared to have won seats on councils in several \nimportant cities.\n\nThe poor showing of conservative candidates linked with the president  indicated frustration among some in the \nIranian population about the direction of the country set by the leadership.  The election results also augured the \nneed for some change in policies.  Whether or not such change would actually occur, was yet to be seen.  \nNevertheless, a representative from the reformist Islamic Iran Participation Front said, \"It is a big 'no' to the \ngovernment's authoritarian and inefficient methods.\"\n\nIn February 2007, a Sunni Muslim group claimed responsibility for the bombing of a bus transporting members of \nIran's Revolutionary Guard.  The attack, which took place in the predominantly Sunni city of Zahedan  left 11 people \ndead.  The area, located in the province of Sistan-Baluchestan and  next to Pakistan and Afghanistan, has been \nbeset by poverty and has long been regarded as a hotbed of violence, banditry and crime.  While an attack at a \ncheckpoint in the area in 2006 left 20 people -- including government officials -- dead, this latest attack on the \nRevolutionary Guard was regarded as the most significant incident in years.  Two days after that attack, clashes \nbetween  armed militants and security forced erupted in the same city.\n\nDiplomatic Imbroglio\n\nThe United States (U.S.) Pentagon said on Jan. 7, 2008, that five Iranian boats threatened five U.S. navy ships in \nthe Strait of Hormuz, which has functioned as a major oil transportation route. The Pentagon said the Iranian \nvessels approached and threatened to blow up the U.S. ships in what the U.S. said were international waters.  \nWhen those U.S. ships prepared to open fire, the Iranian vessels -- believed to belong to the Revolutionary Guard -- \nwithdrew.  The U.S. authorities said that Iran's  \"provocative actions\"  could  very well \"lead to a dangerous incident \nin the future.\"  For its part, Iran dismissed the incident as routine saying that the matter was resolved once both \nsides were able to identify one another.  In 2007, a similar incident resulted in the detainment of 15 British sailors \nfor two weeks.\n\nSpecial Note: Parliamentary Elections of 2008\n\nThe election for the Majlis (parliament) of Iran was held on March 14, 2008.  The parties in contention for the  \navailable parliamentary seats were the Conservatives, the Reformists, the Independents, and other unnamed \ncontenders.\n\nIn the wake of the parliament's proposed bill to cut the term of President Ahmadinejad from 4 years to 2 \u00bd years, \nthe election on March 14, 2008, was draped with conspiracy theories and confusion. The Conservatives, under the \nleadership of  President Ahmadinejad, set the election at a controversial time period -- the week before the Iranian \nNew Year.  Many believed this was a move to catch the population of Iran off guard so that as few people as \npossible would vote.  Then,  after the vote, if the election results were less than desirable, they could doctor the \noutcome.  This skepticism was derived from the Reformists' point of view.  The Reformists considered themselves \nto be a target of the Guardian Council, the ruling body of government, since  many of their candidates up for the \nopen spots on the Council were disqualified.\n\nNeedless to say, many believed that the corruption in the government, the devolving economy, and  the bill \nregarding the shortened  term of Ahmadinejad, all factored highly in the March election.\n\nWith the votes counted on election day, it was clear that the Conservatives would retain control of parliament, as \nexpected.\n\n\n\nThe Conservatives' strong showing was partially due to their performance in the Iranian capital of Tehran.  \nHowever, it should be noted that not all the Conservatives were pro-Ahmadinejad; in fact, a significant number of \nthem were viewed as critics of the president.  Despite the fact that many of their candidates were disqualified by the \nGuardian Council, the Reformists also had some reason to celebrate since they enjoyed a modest increase in \nparliamentary representation.  There were also some Independents who won representation in parliament.\n\nThe main outcome of the election was the fact that President  Ahmadinejad could be faced with a lack of \ncooperation in parliament.  This was  due to the parliamentary increase in the number of Reformists and critical  \nConservatives.  This scenario could likely weakene the presidency while strengthening  the country's Supreme \nLeader -- Ayatollah Khomeini.  Such an end could indicate an even more hardline stance on foreign policy and \nretrenchment in regards to Iran's nuclear ambitions.\n\nWestern powers criticized the election as neither free nor fair and criticized the decision to disqualify many \nReformist candidates.\n\nNuclear Politics Return to the Agenda\n\nIn late May 2008, the United Nations nuclear watchdog group, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) , said \nthat Iran was withholding some information about its nuclear program.  The IAEA said in a report that Iran was not \nproviding enough information about its nuclear activities despite agreeing to clarity prevailing questions about the \ncountry's  nuclear development program.\n\nAt issue for the IAEA was the fact that Iran has been operating 3,500 centrifuges  in  Natanz.  (Centrifuges are \nused to enrich uranium, which can then be used to develop nuclear weaponry.)  The IAEA said that Iran had to \nprovide substantially more details about its nuclear development regime.  For its part, Iran insisted that it had \"left \nno question unanswered\" and vowed to continue to enrich uranium.\n\nJune 2008 saw  international negotiators put forth a new package, laden with attractive incentives, to Iran aimed at \nhalting that country's nuclear enrichment activities.  The deal was reached after extensive consultations between \nEuropean Union policy chief, Javier Solana, and  Iranian representatives.  The talks were  aimed at resolving many \nof the contentious issues that had, to date, left the nuclear issue in Iran unresolved.\n\nJavier Solana described the new incentive package for Iran as  \"full of opportunities.\"  Solana said the five members \nof the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (the United States, the United Kingdom,  \nChina, Russia, France) as well as Germany were willing to both recognize Iran's right to have a civilian nuclear \nenergy program, and to assist in its development for peaceful purposes.  To that end, Solana said, \"We are ready to \ncooperate with Iran in the development of a modern nuclear energy program based on the most modern generation \nof light water reactors.\"  He went on to state, \"We can offer Iran legally binding fuel supply guarantees. We are \noffering the construction of nuclear power plants.\" Solana also noted the deal would also include trade benefits for \nIran.\n\nFor its part, Iran has repeatedly warned it would  not accept demands that it  halt its nuclear enrichment activities.\n\nNevertheless,  Iran said it would study the proposal.  United States President George W. Bush was quick to suggest \nthat Iran had already dismissed the deal.  However, Solana pointed out that, in fact, Iran had agreed to consider the \ndeal.\n\nTwo days after the aforementioned incentives package was put forward, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the United \nKingdom and President George W. Bush of the United States warned Iran that it should accept their \"offers of \npartnership\" or deal with harsh sanctions and increased international isolation.  Brown particularly noted that if Iran \nchose not to respect United Nations resolutions, then it would face a more difficult sanctions regime, including the \nfreezing of overseas assets at Iran's predominant bank and the imposition of energy sanctions.\n\n\n\nTough sanctions would have been a lesser consequence of Iranian intransigence on the nuclear issue.  On June \n20, 2008, Israel carried out a military exercise presumed to be a rehearsal for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.  \nUnited States officials said in an interview with the New York Times that more than  100 Israeli fighter jets \nparticipated in maneuvers over the eastern Mediterranean earlier in the month.  The military exercise appeared \noriented toward sending a message to Iran that Israel would carry out an attack on Iranian nuclear targets if Israel \nbelieved that Iran was approaching development of nuclear weaponry.  Iran responded to the development by again \ninsisting that its nuclear program was peaceful and dismissing the threat of an Israeli attack.\n\nMeanwhile, the head of the nuclear watchdog agency, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mohammed \nElBaradei, has discouraged the notion of a military strike by Israel on Iran stating in an interview with Al-Arabiya \ntelevision, \"A military strike, in my opinion, would be worse than anything possible - it would turn the region into a \nfireball.\"\n\nNevertheless, earlier in the month, an Iranian-born Israeli politician and former defense minister, Shaul Mofaz \nwarned that  military action would be \"unavoidable\" if Tehran was able to acquire the technology to manufacture \natomic bombs.  This assertion, along with the military exercises, certainly suggested that a confrontation between \nIsrael and Iran might be possible, especially if the diplomatic efforts failed, and if Iran was shown to carrying out \nparticular nuclear ambitions, such as the processing of weapons-grade plutonium and installation of additional \ncentrifuges.  While other leading figures in Israel had distanced themselves from Mofaz's remarks, Ehud Barak, the \ncurrent defense minister, said that his country would ensure that Iran did not achieve its nuclear ambitions.\n\nOn July 9, 2008, Iran test-fired nine missiles in an apparent warning to Israel and the United States that it was \ncapable of retaliating against any potential military strike on Iran.  The missiles included both short-range and long-\nrange types, as well as the new version of the Shahab-3, which was purported to be have sufficient range as to \nreach Israel.\n\nThe missile test came less than a month after Israel carried out a military exercise presumed to be a rehearsal for \nan attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.\n\nAhead of the missile tests, an adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader made clear that  it would retaliate if it was struck by \nIsrael. Later, Hoseyn Salami, the commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard's Air Force, described his country's \nmilitary capacity saying,  \"Our missiles are ready for shooting at any place and any time, quickly and with \naccuracy.\"  That said, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made clear on the day of the missile testing that \nIran did not intend to attack Israel.  The United States reacted with restraint to the event, urging Iran to \"refrain from \nfurther missile tests if they truly seek to gain the trust of the world.\"\n\nNotes:\n\n-Mullen, the Chairman of the United States Joints Chiefs, said that military action against Iran would further \ndestabilize the region -- a view that appeared to be in line with the White House's official stance in favor of \nnegotiations and an increased sanctions regime.\n\n-While speculation increased about whether or not Israel would strike against Iranian nuclear facilities, Israel would \nnonetheless have to gain approval to penetrate air space controlled by the United States.  Thus, some modicum of \nAmerican involvement in a strike would be necessitated, and there is no sense that the United States is prepared to \ngo down that road yet.\n\n-For its part, Israel's military strike option is predicated on two considerations.  First, it may be prepared to take \naction if it is clear that Iran has enough enriched uranium with which to make a nuclear bomb (a stage that the \nNational Intelligence Estimate in the United States has said has not yet been reached by Iran as noted below).  \nSecond, Israel may be prepared to take action if Iran acquires a new Russian anti-aircraft system, the S-300 (a \nprocess that could take an extended period of time).\n\n\n\n-United States National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) in late 2007 asserted that Iran had not progressed in its nuclear \nambitions.  Nevertheless, the United States has been at the forefront of Western efforts to end Iran's nuclear \nprogram and ensure that it does not develop nuclear weaponry.\n\nRelations with the United States:  New Developments\n\nYears after deeming Iran to be part of the \"axis of evil,\" the Bush administration in July 2008 offered no denial of \nreports that it would establish a diplomatic presence in Iran.  According to the British newspaper, the Guardian, the \nUnited States was set to open an interests section in the Iranian capital of  Tehran.\n\nSince the hostage crisis of 1979, the United Sates has not had a diplomatic presence in Iran.\n\nThe United States Department of State released a statement by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, which noted  \nthat while the United States was not changing its policy in regard to the Iranian government, it was interested in \noutreach to ordinary Iranians.\n\nThat said, the United States was slated to convene talks with Iran in Geneva.  It would be the first time in three \ndecades that a high ranking American diplomat would be involved in such a meeting with Iranian counterparts.  At \nthat meeting, the United  States reinforced its position on Iran's nuclear program, noting that Iranian obstinacy on \nthe matter would lead to a heightened sanctions regime.\n\nUpdate on the Nuclear Issue\n\nIn early August 2008, only a day after the United States and the United Kingdom warned that Iran would face a \nheightened sanctions regime if it did not respond positively to prevailing proposals on how to deal with its \ncontroversial nuclear program, the government of Iran offered an ambiguous response to the European Union (EU).\n\nAt issue was a \"freeze for freeze\"  offer put forth a week earlier by EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana that Iran \nhalt its uranium enrichment program, while international powers would refrain from imposing further economic \nsanctions.  A deadline was set for a response by Iran, which Iranian chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili said his \ncountry would meet by tendering a formal response on Aug. 5, 2008.\n\nTo that end, Iran did indeed sent a message to Solana.  However, it was unclear if that message was an actual \nresponse to prevailing proposals on Iran's nuclear ambitions.\n\nSolana's office confirmed that a letter from Iran had been received but did not furnish any details, saying instead \nthat it would study the contents of the missive.\n\nA spokesperson for the Iranian Supreme National Security Council told Agence France Press that the message did \nnot pertain to the incentives package  that had been  offered by the five permanent members of the United Nations \nSecurity Council (the United States, the United Kingdom,  China, Russia, France) as well as Germany in June \n2008,  which was aimed at halting Iran's  nuclear enrichment activities.\n\nLate September 2008 saw the United Nations  Security Council  unanimously approve a new resolution on Iran.  \nUnited Nations  Security Council  resolution 1835  reified previous demands that Iran halt its uranium enrichment \nactivities but did not expressly impose new sanctions.\n\nInstead, the resolution asserts that Iran must \"comply, and without delay, with its obligations\" set forth in previous  \nresolutions; it also urges Iran to  co-operate with the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, the International \nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  There were no new sanctions in the resolution due to Russia's objections to such a \nmove.\n\n\n\nThe resolution came a week after the IAEA said that it was unable to provide assurances about Iran's controversial \nnuclear development program due to a lack of information.\n\nIran responded to this action by the United Nations by disregarding the edict and, instead,  making it clear that it \nwould not  stop enriching uranium.  Iran, as before, also maintained that its nuclear development activities have \nbeen for peaceful purposes.\n\nIran's chief nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, characterized the new resolution as unconstructive.  Moreover, Jalili \nwarned that the new resolution would only create further \"mistrust\" and would hinder the fostering of international  \npeace,  security and productive cooperation at the global level.\n\nMore Recent Developments:\n\nBy early 2009, it was yet to be seen how the nuclear issue and the broader matter of foreign relations between Iran \nand other country would be handled given the new balance of power in the United States.  United States Secretary \nof State Hillary Clinton, as the top diplomat for the new Obama administration, had signaled the possibility of  talks \nwith Iran.\n\nThat said, on Feb. 20, 2009, a new report by the United Nations' nuclear watchdog entity, the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency (IAEA), asserted that Iran was understating how much uranium it had enriched, and that it had built \nup a stockpile of nuclear fuel.  According to reports by Reuters, the discrepancy in the amount of uranium believed \nto have been enriched and the amount enriched in actuality was not due to subterfuge by Iran, but rather, a result \nof a technical mistake.\n\nThe Obama administration in the United States expressed concern over these revelations and called on the \ninternational community to address the matter with urgency. White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs said, \"The \nreport represents another lost opportunity for Iran as it continues to renege on its international obligations.\"\n\nOn March 1, 2009, United States senior military commander Admiral Mike Mullen said that Iran had enough nuclear \nmaterial to manufacture a bomb. In an interview on the cable network CNN, the chairman of the United States Joint \nChiefs of Staff said, \"We think they do, quite frankly. And Iran having a nuclear weapon, I've believed for a long \ntime, is a very, very bad outcome for the region and for the world.\" This assertion by Mullen came two weeks after \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a report that Tehran had increased its stockpile of fissile \nnuclear material.\n\nThere were some analysts, such as David Albright, president of Washington-based  Institute for Science and \nInternational Security, have said the Iranian stockpile was enough to be converted into enriched uranium sufficient \nfor building one bomb (reported by Agence France Presse). But that view was not shared by United States \nSecretary of Defense Robert Gates, who said in an interview on the NBC news show, Meet the Press, \"I think that \nthere has been a continuing focus on how do you get the Iranians to walk away from a nuclear weapons program? \nThey're not close to a stockpile. They're not close to a weapon at this point.\"\n\nAmidst the rising tide of anxiety over Iran's nuclear ambitions, there were questions of how Israel -- a sworn enemy \nof Iran -- would respond. According to a report published by the Daily Telegraph of London, Israel has launched \ncovert operations against Iran, which included plans to assassinate nuclear scientists.\n\nDrawing upon both United States and other Western intelligence sources, the report in the Daily Telegraph of \nLondon noted that Israel was using \"hit men,\" \"double agents\" and \"front companies,\" in targeted efforts to \nsabotage Iran's nuclear program by eliminating \"key human assets.\" The report made mention of the death of an \nIranian scientist at the Isfahan uranium plant. It reported of rumors linking the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad \nwith the gas poisoning death of Ardeshire Hassanpour in 2007.\n\nMaking good on a campaign promise, United States President Barack Obama offered the possibility of diplomatic \nengagement with Iran. In a videotaped message in the third week of March 2009, President Obama said, \"My \nadministration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us.\"\n\n\n\nPresident Obama made a point of using the official name of the country when he said he wanted \"to speak directly \nto the people and leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\" President Obama also indicated that his administration \nwas committed \"to pursuing constructive ties among the United States, Iran and the international community.\"\n\nPresident Obama's message was broadcast at the same time as the Iranian festival of Nowruz. The timing may \nhave been orchestrated for its symbolic value since Nowruz is a significant celebration on the Iranian calendar \nmarking the start of spring. Making clear that a new era of diplomacy was ahead, President Obama said, \"With the \ncoming of a new season, we're reminded of this precious humanity that we all share. And we can once again call \nupon this spirit as we seek the promise of a new beginning.\"\n\nBut President Obama also struck a warning when he noted, \"This process will not be advanced by threats. We \nseek instead engagement that is honest and grounded in mutual respect.\" He continued, \"The United States wants \nthe Islamic Republic of Iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations. You have that right - but it comes \nwith real responsibilities.\"\n\nIn response, an advisor to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad cautiously welcomed United States President \nObama's message but called for a fundamental shift in American foreign policy. Of particular concern to Iran was \nthe United States' support for Israel, according to Ahmadinejad's advisor, Ali Akbar Javafekr, who also said the \nsanctions against Iran had to end. He continued, \"By fundamentally changing its behavior, America can offer us a \nfriendly hand.\" Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khomeini issued a less diplomatic reaction, instead demanding \nthat the United States radically change its policies.\n\nTense relations between the Washington D.C., and Tehran have been ongoing for decades but took a particularly \nnegative turn when President Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, referred to Iran as part of the \"axis of evil.\" \nBilateral relations devolved further when Iran decided to pursue its controversial nuclear program.\n\nTo date, the United States and many other countries have expressed anxieties about Iran's nuclear ambitions, \nwhich the Iranian government has maintained is for peaceful purposes and not intended to build atomic weaponry. \nThe United States, first under the Bush administration, and now under the Obama administration, wants Iran to \nabandon its nuclear enrichment activities. That said, analysts surmise that in advancing this overture, President \nObama has signaled interest in building a more constructive relationship with Tehran before directly confronting the \nnuclear issue.\n\nIndeed, Javier Solana, the foreign policy chief of the European Union, characterized Obama's overture as \"very \nconstructive\" and called on Iran to heed the United States' president's core message.\n\nIn April 2009, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad presided over the opening of the country's first nuclear fuel \nproduction facility at Isfahan. He also announced that the new facility could produce pellets of uranium oxide, which \ncould potentially fuel a heavy-water reactor being constructed in Arak. Such an ability would suggest that Iran has \nmade great strides in its nuclear development program. Indeed, at full capacity, the new facility could produce \nenough plutonium to produce two nuclear weapons a year, assuming the plutonium was separated from the nuclear \nreactor's spent fuel.\n\nMeanwhile, the Iranian leader said his country had tested two new types of centrifuge with higher capacities at a \nuranium enrichment plant in Natanz. Gholam Reza Aghazadeh, the head of Iran's nuclear program, said the \ncountry had increased the number of centrifuges it was running to 7,000. This claim has yet to be verified since \ninternational inspectors had earlier noted that Iran had less than 4,000 functioning centrifuges.\n\nIran's nuclear program has been a source of controversy, with many Western powers accusing Iran of using its \nnuclear power program as a veil for ambitions to build a nuclear arsenal. For its part, however, Iran has insisted that \nits nuclear development program is for peaceful purposes. But in a speech given at the opening of the nuclear \nproduction facility, President Ahmadinejad went further in explaining Iran's nuclear ambitions by noting that Iran was \nmoving ahead with its nuclear agenda because it was the only way to establish Iran's status on the world stage. \nStated differently, he was emphasizing a national identity interest.\n\n\n\nPresident Ahmadinejad also responded to an offer of dialogue with six world powers when he said that his country \nwas open to the notion. That being said, the Iranian leader said that such talks would only be in the offing in the \ncontext of \"justice\" and respect.\" He said, \"The Iranian nation has from the beginning been after logic and \nnegotiations, but negotiations based on justice and complete respect for rights and regulations.\" He continued, \n\"One-sided negotiations, conditional negotiations, negotiations in an atmosphere of threat are not something that \nany free person would accept.\"\n\nBut Russia and China -- two countries that have urged restraint by the West in dealing with Iran, have urged the \nIranian authorities to accept the invitation. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Iran had to \"convince \nus all of the exclusively peaceful character of its nuclear program.\" The five permanent United Nations Security \nCouncil members and Germany also urged Iran to accept the invitation to participate in talks. In a statement, they \ncalled on Iran \"to take advantage of this opportunity to engage seriously with all of us in a spirit of mutual respect.\" \nUnited States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton indicated that the United States wanted to be a full participant in \nsuch talks, saying, \"Obviously we believe that pursuing very careful engagement on a range of issues that affect \nour interests and the interests of the world with Iran makes senses.\" The United States' top diplomat also \nemphasized the imperative of the effort noting, \"There is nothing more important than trying to convince Iran to \ncease its efforts to obtain a nuclear weapon.\" China applauded the United States' engagement on the matter. Jiang \nYu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said that Beijing was \"glad to see an improvement in relations \nbetween the United States and Iran.\"\n\nPresident Ahmadinejad  responded to an offer of dialogue with six world powers when he said that his country was \nopen to the notion.  Perhaps in an effort to provide the  reassurance sought by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei \nLavrov (as noted above), President Ahmadinejad said Iran has prepared proposals aimed at resolving his country's \nnuclear dispute with the West.\n\nThe Iranian leader said that his country's proposal package would ensure \"peace and justice\" for the world although \nhe offered no details.  On national television, Ahmadinejad said, \"We have prepared a package that can be the \nbasis to resolve Iran's nuclear problem. It will be offered to the West soon.\"\n\nHe went on to describe his proposal by saying, \"It respects rights of all nations.\"  Analysts, however, warned that \nwhat may be viewed in Tehran as an overture of peace and resolution may not find the same resonance in the \ncapitals of the West.\n\nIran tested the patience of the Western community by test firing a medium range surface-to-surface missile during \nthe third week of May 2009. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad hailed the successful missile launch, saying that the \nSajjil-2 missile utilized \"advanced technology\" and had demonstrated accuracy by landing on its unspecified target. \nSeparate reports from the United States confirmed that the missile launch had indeed taken place successfully.\n\nThe missile, with a solid fuel capacity that was believed to increase accuracy, could potentially reach Israel as well \nas American bases in the region. As well, it could theoretically be used to deliver nuclear warheads. Accordingly, \nthere was a growing sense of concern about an apparently provocative act by Tehran at a time when Western \npowers were looking for productive dialogue, aimed at resolving the ongoing dispute over Iran's nuclear ambitions.\n\nBut in another twist, however, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad signaled that he was open to meeting with \nUnited States President Barack Obama, if he was successful in his re-election bid in June 2009.  Ahmadinejad said \nhe was open to debating international issues with  the American president at a forthcoming United Nations session \nscheduled for September 2009.  He noted that he would only be willing to discuss Iran's nuclear program within the \ncontext of International Atomic Energy Agency regulations.  For his part, President Obama has maintained his \nopenness to constructive engagement with Iran.\n\nOn May 28, 2009, a mosque in the Zahedan -- the capital of Sistan-Baluchestan -- was the site of a bomb explosion \nthat left around 20 people dead and more than 60 others injured.  Zahedan is one of Iran's cities inhabited mostly \nbe Sunni Muslims in this predominantly Shi'a Muslim country.  The province of Sistan-Baluchestan is regarded as \n\n\n\none of the most remote and neglected corners of Iran. Bordering  Afghanistan and Pakistan, the province gained \nnotoriety as a trans-shipment point in the trafficking of narcotics including heroine and morphine.  Perhaps not \nsurprisingly, the area has become home to militants and drug gangs.\n\nThe Iranian news agency reported that the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber. At the same time, Jalal \nSayah -- the provincial deputy governor -- placed the blame on the United States. Sayah alleged that the three \nsuspects who had been arrested in connection with the attack were mercenaries hired by the United States.\n\nPrimer on Presidential Election of 2009\n\nBackground\n\nIranians were set to go to the polls in June 2009 to elect a president. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, known for \nhis vitriolic and controversial rhetoric, was seeking re-election. However, the economic challenges in Iran, \nmanifested by falling oil prices, rising inflation and concomitant rising joblessness were expected to potentially hurt \nthe incumbent president's prospects. Ahmadinejad would also be faced with formidable challenges, particularly \nfrom among the reformist bloc.\n\nShould a reformist unseat hard-line President Ahmadinejad, the move would signal a reformist and moderate shift \non the Iranian political landscape. To do so, however, any reformist would have to overcome strong opposition from \nIran's conservatives and rely on the backing from previous reformist and moderate supporters who have become \ndisillusioned by the lack of progress and reform in Iran in recent times.\n\nThe Candidates\n\nAs indicated above, it was announced that incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad would run in the upcoming \npresidential elections. A consultant to Ahmadinejad, Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi was quoted as saying, \"Mahmoud \nAhmadinejad is the 10th presidential elections candidate in June.\" Referring to the president's service to the Iranian \npeople during his tenure in office, Hashemi said the Iranian \"people know their servants better.\"\n\nAmong the incumbent president's challengers was the conservative speaker of the parliament, Ali Larijani, who has \nfunctioned as one of Iran's chief diplomats on the international scene in talks related to Iran's nuclear program. If \nIranians decided they wish to pursue further engagement on the matter, especially with the new Obama \nadministration in the United States, Larijani was viewed as  a solid choice.\n\nAt the same time, after years on the sidelines, Iran's reformists were trying to make a comeback. Ahead of \npresidential elections set for June 2009, Iran's former President Mohammad Khatami announced his candidacy for \nthe country's position as head of state.\n\nAt a meeting of reformists, Khatami said, \"I will seriously take part as a candidate for the election.\" Then, at a news \nconference in Tehran, Khatami pointed to the urgency of the moment as his motivation for contesting the election. \nHe said, \"Is it possible to remain indifferent toward the revolution's fate and shy away from running in the \nelections?\" He also urged a free and open election saying, \"This candidacy doesn't deprive others and the path is \nopen. What should be stressed is that the elections must be held freely.\"\n\nOn March 17, 2009, Iran's reformist former President Mohammad Khatami announced his withdrawal from the \npresidential election. In a statement that came after a meeting with several reformist leaders, Khatami said: \"I \nannounce my withdrawal from the 10th presidential election.\" Calling for a \"free and fair\" election, Khatami said he \nintended to continue to participate politically, and he wanted to encourage massive voter turnout in the upcoming \nelection.\n\nKhatami's withdrawal appeared linked with the decision of former Iranian Prime Minster Mir-Hossein Mousavi, also \na reformist, to also seek the presidency. Clearly, the reformist camp wanted to avoid vote splitting and unite behind \na single candidate.\n\n\n\nAs of June 2009, four candidates were approved by the conservative-controlled Guardian Council to contest the \npresidential election set for June 12, 2009. Profiles of all four candidates are as follows --\n\nIncumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\n\nAhmadinejad is considered a representative of the country's ultra-conservatives and a close disciple of Supreme \nLeader Ayatollah Ali Khomeini. During Ahmadinejad's presidency, Iran has not only refused to halt uranium \nenrichment despite prevailing United Nations Security Council resolutions calling for it to do so, it has in fact \naccelerated its nuclear program. Ahmadinejad also maintains a hard line with the United States and Israel. \nAhmadinejad has dramatically increased government spending and has supported subsidies for lower-income \nfamilies. But the country's escalating rate of inflation and high unemployment have resulted in sharp attacks about \nhis poor stewardship of Iran's economy.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi\n\nMousavi -- an ethnic Azeri -- is a leading representative in Iran's reformist camp and is considered to be the main \nchallenger to Ahmadinejad. As an reformist politician, Mousavi has repeatedly criticized the incumbent \ngovernment's economic policy. He also vows to pursue constructive interaction and improved relations between \nIran and the wider world if he is elected as president. Mousavi has notably advocated liberty of speech and thought, \nas well as improved women's rights -- clear shifts in policy from the current leadership of Iran.\n\nFormer Parliament Speaker Mehdi Karroubi\n\nKarroubi, the current chairman of the National Trust Party, is regarded as a pragmatist reformist on Iran's political \nscene. Karroubi vows to change Iran's executive mode if he is elected as president, saying that Ahmadinejad's \nintemperate statements have served only to cause problems for Iran in the realm of international relations. Karroubi \nfavors \"good diplomacy\" in foreign policy and has said that he seeks a \" logical, wise and proud\" relationship with \nother countries. On the economy, Karroubi has called for the distribution of the oil sector profits to every Iranian \nadult. He also said that while there was nothing lacking in Iranian human rights law, there was a need for its \nenforcement.\n\nFormer Revolutionary Guards chief Mohsen Rezaie\n\nRezaie, currently the secretary of the Expediency Discernment Council, is considered by many observers as a \nmoderate conservative candidate in the upcoming presidential election. He adopted the phrase \"economic rescue\" \nas a campaign slogan and called for a revolution in the Iranian economy. Rezaie has blamed Ahmadinejad for \ndriving Iran's economy to the edge of a \"precipice.\" On foreign policy, Rezaie said he looked for engagement with \nforeign countries, including the United States, and wanted to preserve security and peace in the region. Rezaie has \nperhaps offered the most detailed alternate plan for addressing Western concerns over Iran's nuclear activities. He \nsaid he would continue Iran's uranium enrichment -- but within the framework of an international consortium, which \ncould potentially include the United States, Russia and European countries.\n\nTowards Election Day\n\nElection day on June 12, 2009, was drawing close and Iranians headed to the polls to choose between incumbent \nPresident Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his three rivals -- Mohsen Rezaie, Mehdi Karroubi and the main challenger, \nMir Hossein Mousavi.\n\nIn the final days of the campaigning for the Iranian presidential election was marked by large rallies with thousands \nof attendees, as well as ever-increasingly heated political rhetoric. In his last media appearance, Ahmadinejad \nmade virulent accusations of his opponents, including the claim that his opponents had conspired with Israel \nagainst him. In fact, he referred to \"Zionist entities\" -- an apparent reference to Israeli companies -- which he \nclaimed had been used to falsify information and discredit his government. But the other three candidates had not \nbeen offered equivalent time for media appearances and so they were not able to counter these claims.\n\n\n\nThe political climate had become so fractious and acrimonious that former President Hashemi Rafsanjani called on \nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khomeini to restrain Ahmadinejad's ever-increasingly vociferous statements. \nAs well, fervent supporters of Mousavi gathered in throngs to show their support for him, and to decry Ahmadinejad \nfor his handling of the economy -- which is characterized by high inflation and structural unemployment -- and \nundermining Iran's reputation internationally.\n\nAhmadinejad's main core of support has come from the Revolutionary Guard and Iran's ruling clerics, although \nneither group had officially endorsed him. He was also supported by the Basij militia, and perhaps most importantly, \nby Ayatollah Khomeini. President Ahmadinejad additionally commanded the support of both the urban poor and \nrural inhabitants, and his promise of sharing oil wealth has found resonance among struggling families. On the other \nhand, however, his poor stewardship of the economy offered an opening to his rivals. Accordingly, those rivals \ngarnered support among the intelligentsia, the middle classes, and the more educated portions of the urban \npopulation.\n\nThere were three key demographic groups that were also expected to play decisive roles in the election. Of primary \nimportance were Iranian women who, in their pursuit of increased personal liberty, were expected to cast their \nsupport for reformist candidates. In fact, Mousavi's tendency to campaign and even hold hands with his wife -- a \nnoted university professor -- in this conservative country was considered a culturally radical shift. That said, \nconservative Ahmadinejad was not without his own female supporters thanks to his advocacy of insurance for \nhousewives. The substantial youth and student vote -- and particularly, young females who make up 65 percent of \nthe country's university students -- were also expected to be influential. Finally, the reformist candidates were also \nexpected to secure support from national and religious minorities.\n\nPolls ahead of the election suggested that the main contest was between Ahmadinejad and Mousavi. In the week \nbefore election day, several independent polls showed that Mousavi had advanced a decisive lead over \nAhmadinejad.  That said, even with such polling data available, there was no guarantee that any candidate would \nacquire the 50 percent majority to avoid a run-off among the two top vote getters.\n\nTo that end, Mousavi's challenge would be to capture enough of the anti-incumbent vote to either win outright or \ngarner enough support to get him to the second round. He was helped by the fact that former President  Rafsanjani \nmade it clear via an open letter to the Supreme Leader Khomeini that the continuation of an Ahmadinejad \npresidency would run counter to Iran's best national interests.  For his part, Ahmadinejad's objective was to win an \noutright majority and avoid having to deal with a run-off election, where he would be faced with a consolidated anti-\nincumbent voting bloc.  Among the two other candidates, conservative voters looking for an alternative option to \nAhmadinejad were expected to cast ballots for Rezaie, while Karroubi was expected to share the moderate vote \nwith Mousavi.\n\nElection Results\n\nOn June 12, 2009, voter turnout was so high that polling stations had to extend their operations for several hours to \naccommodate Iranians who wanted to cast their ballots. Reports from the ground suggested that voter participation \nwas unprecedented. Since there was no exit poll data, it was unknown as to which candidate was in the lead.  That \nsaid, fierce and rancorous debates between the candidates, fervent competition between the conservative and \nreformist camps respectively, aforementioned polling data, the massive rallies attended by tens of thousands of \nMousavi's supporters, as well as unprecedented voter turnout, gave hope to the reformists that possible victory was \nat hand.\n\nBut soon after the polls closed, both reformist former Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi and incumbent President \nMahmoud Ahmadinejad claimed to have won the election, according to international media. Actual results were not \navailable at the time these competing claims were made and, following the pattern of past elections, vote counting \nand verification was not expected to be completed until the next day.\n\nWith that said, there were reports that Mousavi was in line to win a landslide victory.  One of his campaign \nspokesmen, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, said that the Mousavi camp had been contacted by the Interior Ministry to advise \n\n\n\nthem to commence preparations for a victory statement.  They were also cautioned to be show restraint in so doing, \nout of respect for Ahmadinejad's supporters.\n\nSuddenly, however, the political landscape changed radically.  Mousavi's websites were blocked, text messaging \nand other forms of mobile communications were cut off, various social networking communications were curtailed,  \nand one of Mousavi's campaign headquarters was reportedly raided.\n\nSoon thereafter, a former Revolutionary Guard commander who now led the Interior Ministry, Sadegh Mahsouli, \nannounced that it was  Ahmadinejad who was far ahead in the vote count.  Iranian state media then declared \nAhmadinejad the winner by landslide. This announcement was a clear shock since the very same Interior Ministry \nallegedly suggested it was Mousavi who was on track for his own landslide victory only a little while earlier.\n\nIn contrast to other contested election results showing a competitive race with close vote totals for the candidates, \nthis was a  confusing case of two sides  respectively claiming decisive \"landslide\" victories.  As strange vote totals \nwere released showing Mousavi even losing ethnic Azeri enclaves and other likely strongholds, questions arose \nabout the veracity of the numbers. The communications blockage and climate of disbelief only served to increase \nsuspicion about the questionable election results and stoke fears of fraudulence. The scenario was evolving into a \npolitical powder keg of sorts.\n\nPost-Election Protests\n\nThe intensity of that political powder keg increased when Mousavi issued a strong statement vociferously rejecting \nthe  election results, alleging fraud,  and  promising resistance.  He argued that nullification of the election results \nwas \"the only possible way for regaining the people's trust and cooperation with the government.\"  He also called \non his supporters \"to peacefully protest and defend legal rights civilly and without confrontation and violence all over \nthe country.\"  As well, Mousavi issued a letter calling on the Council of Guardians to void the election saying \"fraud \nis evident,\" and he dispatched a letter to Ayatollah Khomeini protesting the vote counting.  His face-to-face  meeting \nwith Ayatollah Khomeini was expected to be as futile as his letter in reversing the announced election results.\n\nMeanwhile, it was reported via Mousavi's official \"Twitter\" (a social networking mechanism) account that he had \nbeen placed under house arrest. The message read: \"Dear Iranian People, Mousavi has not left you alone, he has \nbeen put under house arrest by Ministry of Intelligence.\"  In a separate message on Mousavi's website, he again \ncharged that the will of the people had been violated, but warned his supporters not to resort to violence as they \nprotested the unfolding situation.\n\nMousavi expressed hope that the security forces of Iran would treat the protestors with care as the people \nregistered their discontent.\n\nSuch an end was not to happen.  Mousavi's supporters did indeed take to the streets to protests Ahmadinejad's \nclaim of victory.  Indeed, demonstrations broke out across the country from the capital city of Tehran to Mashhad in \nthe north eastern part of the country and Baabol to the north.  But various reports from the ground in Iran suggested \nthat several well-known reformists, intellectuals, human rights advocates, and members of the opposition were \narrested.  Among those detained was Mohammad Reza Khatami -- the brother of former reformist President \nKhatami. Meanwhile, hundreds of Mousavi's ordinary supporters were arrested and beaten.\n\nThe Mousavi camp was joined by the other reformist presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, who threw off his \nclerical robes in protest.  Karroubi virulently condemned the election results and echoed Mousavi's call for \nresistance saying, \"If we do not resist this [fraud], people will never help us again.\"\n\nAlso joining the fray was the fourth presidential candidate, Mohsen Rezaie.  According to Lara Setrakian of ABC \nNews, Rezaie wrote and published a strong condemnation of the Iranian election results.  It was significant that the \nonly other conservative candidate, who also served as the former head of the Revolutionary Guard, had staked out \nsuch a position in opposition to Ahmadinejad, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini, and the overall established \norder of Iran.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, various media outlets in the region, including al-Jazeera, reported that former President Rafsanjani \nresigned from a  powerful position.  Specifically, he resigned from one of the constitutional bodies upon which he \nsat -- the Expediency Council -- in protest of the situation unfolding in Iran.\n\nThose opposing the election results were not limited to the political arena.  Grand Ayatollah Sanei declared \nAhmadinejad's presidency to illegitimate.  He warned that cooperation with Ahmadinejad's government was \ntantamount to acting against Islam.  Ayatollah Sansei had earlier issued a fatwa against vote rigging, characterizing \nit as a mortal sin.  His moral and religious edicts did not find resonance among those trying to hold onto power as \nsome reports alleged that police had surrounded his home and office.\n\nResistance unfolded at the civic level across the country.  Notably, 120 faculty members of Sharif University \nresigned en masse in protest.  At the University of Isfahan -- one of Iran's largest institutions of higher learning -  \n700 student protestors broke into riot mode.  In response, the Revolutionary Guard and police moved into action, \nchasing the students back into the dormitories, where they were beaten and arrested.  Some students were able to \nescape and go into hiding, but reports on the ground suggested that as many as100 students were critically injured \nand another 500 suffered wounds.\n\nThere were other reports that former President Khatami and former President Rafsanjani met with Mousavi at the \npresidential candidate's house.  The meeting, which brought together leading political figures for common purpose \nin opposition to the establishment, took place at Mousavi's house  presumably because he was now under house \narrest, as indicated above.  No further information about that meeting was available at the time of writing. However, \nthere were subsequent reports that Mousavi's wife, Zahra Rahnavard, called for peaceful protests, followed by  a \nnational strike.  To that end, Mousavi said he would request permission for a protest rally.  Perhaps not surprisingly, \nthat request was denied.  Undeterred, Mousavi's supporters said they would instead march to the shrine to \nRevolutionary Leader Ayatollah Khomeini.  The bold move was sure to provoke a confrontation between the \nreformist and establishment elements within the context of revolutionary principles.\n\nMeanwhile, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued repeated declarations of support for the re-election victory \nof Ahmadinejad, even characterizing the election outcome as a \"divine assessment.\"  Then, two days after the \nelection, Ahmadinejad himself asserted his political power and again claimed election victory at an international \nnews conference.\n\nOn June 14, 2009, Ahmadinejad took questions from the international media at a news conference.  In response to \nquestions pertaining to the violence in the streets, Ahmadinejad dismissed the protestors, equating them with \ndisgruntled fans of the losing team at a soccer match.  He said, \"Some believed they would win, and then they got \nangry.  He continued, \"It has no legal credibility. It is like the passions after a soccer match. ... The margin between \nmy votes and the others is too much and no one can question it.\"\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Ahmadinejad also dismissed allegations of election fraud, emphatically affirming \ninstead that his re-election was \"real and free.\"  Indeed, Ahmadinejad went even further to accuse the international \ncommunity of waging \"psychological warfare\" against Iran, by challenging his legitimacy as the re-elected leader of \nIran.  According to the BBC, Ahmadinejad said, \"This is a great victory at a time and condition when the whole \nmaterial, political and propaganda facilities outside of Iran and sometimes... inside Iran, were total mobilized against \nour people.\"\n\nAt the news conference, Ahmadinejad  was asked by CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour about the safety of \nMousavi.  She posed the following questions:  \"What is the situation with your challenger Mir-Hossein Mousavi and \nwill you guarantee his safety? And why have opposition reform individuals, officials, been arrested?\"  Perhaps \ninstructively, Ahmadinejad sidestepped the question about Mousavi's safety, saying instead: \"The situation in the \ncountry is in a very good condition. Iran is the most stable country in the world, and there's the rule of law in this \ncountry, and all the people are equal before the law. And the presidential election has witnessed people's massive \nturnout. As I said, even in a soccer match, people may become excited and that may lead to a confrontation \nbetween them and the police force. This is something natural. A person coming out of a stadium may violate the \ntraffic regulations. He will be fined by the police no matter who he is, an ordinary person or even a minister.\"\n\n\n\nGoing forward, Ahmadinejad has said his apparent election victory has afforded him political capital to accentuate \nhis policies.  Indeed, at a news conference two days after the election, Ahmadinejad was asked if he would take a \nmore moderate stance in his second term.  In response, he promised, \"I'm going to be more and more solid.\" \nHuman rights advocates warned that a more \"solid\" position by Ahmadinejad promised further repression of \nreformist, moderate, pro-democracy and student elements.  Geopolitical analysts warned of greater influence by the \nRevolutionary Guard as well as intensified nuclear development. Economists warned of further financial woes in a \ncountry already beset by economic challenges.  Whether or not these prognostications would prove true was yet to \nbe seen.\n\nFollowing the news conference, Ahmadinejad's supporters convened a victory rally.  But the streets were also filled \nwith protestors and activists, effectively setting the stage for conflict.  To that end, journalists on the ground reported \nthat pro-Ahmadinejad demonstrators were allowed to express themselves in celebration while protestors and \nactivists were subdued by security.\n\nJim Sciutto of ABC News reported via Twitter: \"Inside the protests tonight, if you support Ahmadinejad, no police, \nyou criticize him, get pepper spray, tear gas, batons... Anti-gov't protests have spread to other Iranian cities, \nincluding Rasht... We witnessed police spraying pepper gas into the eyes of peaceful female protesters... Two \nworlds in Tehran tonight. Support Ahmadinejad, free rein. Oppose him, risk police attacks, tear gas, batons, arrest.\"\n\nApparently, protestors were not the only ones to feel the effects of what was clearly a crackdown by the political \nestablishment as members of the foreign press were being shut down. It started with the removal of two of the \nbiggest German television stations covering the election in Iran.  As well, the al-Arabiya network was shut down and \nBBC News was ordered to exit Iran immediately.  The BBC also said its satellites used for its Persian television and \nradio services were subject to \"heavy electronic jamming.\" Then, there were unconfirmed reports that NBC News \noffices in Tehran were raided, and that NBC's cameras and equipment were all confiscated.  This was followed by \nallegations that journalists at ABC News  had their cameras and film confiscated.  ABC's Jim Sciutto  confirmed this \nreport by noting: \"Police confiscated our camera and videotapes. We are shooting protests and police violence on \nour cell phones.\"  At the broader level, Internet access and mobile communications were curtailed.  In another \ndevelopment, a Canadian journalist, George McLeod of the Globe and Mail, was reportedly mistaken for a \nprotestor, detained and beaten.\n\nOn  June 14, 2009, two days after the Iranian presidential election took place, dissent was registered from the \nrooftops of Iranian homes and buildings.  The day had seen some of the most fierce street conflict between \nprotestors and security forces.  Then,  after sundown, supporters of Mousavi uttered shouts and cries of \"Allahu \nAkbar,\" or \"God is Great\" from rooftops  to register their dissent in one of the most powerfully symbolical ways.  \nIndeed, \"Allahu Akbar\" was the rallying cry against the Western-backed monarchy that fell to the 1979 Islamic \nRevolution.  Now that rallying cry was being used against the very power structure that came into being via the \nrevolution.\n\nA day later, in a rather unanticipated move, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khomeini appeared to agree to \nMousavi's request that possible  election fraud be considered.  He directed the Council of Guardians to investigate \nthose allegations of election fraud.  It was unknown if the action would end with the election results actually being \nquestioned by the body, which is charged with authorizing the official election outcome. The move was viewed by \nsome as a way for the leadership of Iran to quell the uprising of protestors who relentless took to the streets since \nthe election result was announced.  There was speculation that the establishment had hopes that the high intensity \nof the protestors' anger would subside during the period in which the investigation was unfolding.\n\nBut even under threat of live ammunition fire by security forces, protestors attended Mousavi's rally for which \npermission had been denied. Mousavi himself was in attendance at the rally, which the Iranian government deemed \nto be illegal.  At the time of writing, hundreds of thousands of people were in attendance and at least ten  people \nhad been shot to death, five others were missing, and several others were critically injured by  Islamic Basij \nmilitiamen.\n\n\n\nMass protest action continued in the following days.  Then on June 18, 2009, hundreds of thousands of people \nanswered Mousavi's call to attend  a \"day of mourning\" rally in Tehran to commemorate those  killed while  \nexpressing their voices of opposition to Iran's official election result.\n\nMany attendees at the \"day of mourning\" rally wore black to symbolize the deaths of fellow protestors at the hands \nof  Islamic Basij militiamen and to illustrate a funeral procession, while some displayed banners and signs \nquestioning the rationale for those deaths.  Protest tactics had changed over the course of days with protestors now \noften marching in silence, rather than chanting slogans, and dropping to the ground en masse when Islamic Basij \nmilitiamen were spotted. The new tactics seemed to be in keeping with Mousavi's call for peaceful demonstrations \nthat did not antagonize the opposing side.  Mousavi himself was in attendance, causing the protestors to break \ntheir silence and express their support for him.\n\nOutside Tehran, a silent demonstration took place at a shrine in the south-western city of Shiraz.\n\nPerhaps in a bid to modify his earlier comparison of protestors to the angry soccer fans of a losing team, President \nAhmadinejad said he was referring only to those who \"riot.\"  He also struck a more conciliatory tone in reference to \nthe opposition saying,  \"Everyone is a winner. Iranians are very much valued and respected, and the cabinet \nbelongs to all Iranians.\"  His supporters launched their own counter-protest with thousands in attendance.\n\nIn other developments, the Council of Guardians decided not to carry out a new election as called for by Mousavi, \nbut to simply carry out a partial recount of some ballots.  As well, the Iranian authorities were making high level \narrests of individuals associated with the opposition.  Among those detained were former President Rafsanjani's \ndaughter and son, as well as former Foreign Minister  Ebrahim Yazdi -- the head of the Freedom Movement of Iran \n-- who was arrested while undergoing cancer treatment at a Tehran hospital.\n\nCrackdown Against the Opposition\n\nThe climate on June 18, 2009 was one of anticipation as Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini was expected to \ndeliver the sermon at Friday's prayers.  His address was expected to be a harbinger of the government's stance.  \nWould Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini  go the way of the people now that he was under pressure from Grand \nAyatollah Montenzeri and Grand Ayatollah Sanei -- both of whom had now expressed opposition to the election \nresult and vociferously questioned Ahmadinejad's legitimacy ?  Or would he take a moderate position, augmenting \nAhmadinejad's official victory but also offering concessions to the opposition forces?  Alternatively, would he \ninstead take a hard line position?\n\nIn fact, it was the hard line position that was adopted by Iran's supreme leader on June 19, 2009.  Ayatollah \nKhomeini declared that the election outcome had been decided at the ballot box and would not be overturned by \nprotestors in the streets of Iran.  He said, \"Some may imagine that street action will create political leverage against \nthe system and force the authorities to give in to threats. No, this is wrong.\" Khomeini also dismissed any allegation \nof election fraud or irregularities as impossible in Iran,  and  he reiterated his strong support for President \nAhmadinejad.\n\nAs well, Iran's supreme leader  issued a strong warning that those continuing to participate in protests would face \nharsh repercussions.  He specifically warned that  opposition leaders would  \"be held accountable for all the \nviolence, bloodshed and rioting\" if they did not stop the protest rallies.\n\nThe Iranian leader  additionally blasted the countries of the West, and incorrectly accused United States President \nObama of saying, \"We were waiting for a day like this to see people on the street.\" In fact, the American president \ncarefully avoided any such statements against the objections of other politicians in the United States.  But Khomeini \nsaved his harshest criticism for the United Kingdom, which he characterized as \"the most evil of them,\" for trying to \nstoke instability in Iran. To that end, he said: \"Some of our enemies in different parts of the world intended to depict \nthis absolute victory, this definitive victory, as a doubtful victory.\"\n\n\n\nThe day after Khomanei staked out this hard line position, opposition supporters returned to the streets in defiance \nof the authorities and in the face of likely bloodshed.\n\nThe extent of the injuries that occurred during street clashes was unknown although reports from hospitals \nsuggested an extensive casualty list.  Slowly, images began to be dispersed through still-functioning forms of media \nand communications and revealed a picture of grave brutality as security forces used guns with live ammunition, \nbatons,  water cannons and tear gas against the protestors.  But the protestors were not about to be quelled easily \nand they fought back against the police and militias  by pelting stones at them.  They were not to be quickly \nsilenced either as many in the crowd screamed, \"Death to the dictator!\" in the streets  and, as before, the shouts \nand cries of \"Allahu Akbar\" resounded from rooftops in an expression of opposition.\n\nIt was the most serious case of civil chaos and instability in Iran since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.\n\nBy June 21, 2009, however, it was clear that the authorities had now managed to suppress the opposition to some \ndegree.  Several political leaders associated with the opposition had been arrested and the streets were now \nteeming with a heavy security presence on every street corner.  Consequently, it was difficult for protestors to carry \nout mass action.  In addition, most of the  foreign media had either been asked to leave the country or had their \noperations severely curtailed.  Indeed, more than 20 journalists and bloggers had been detained, according to \nReporters Without Borders.  For his part, Mousavi showed that he would not back down.  He urged supporters to \nkeep up their protests and said he was prepared to a martyr on behalf of the people.\n\nTwo weeks after its contested presidential elections, Iranian protestors continued to take to the streets in defiance \nof the government's warning that dire consequences were in the offing.  On June 24, 2009, Supreme Leader \nAyatollah Ali Khomeini's repeated decrees that demonstrators should stop their mass action went unheeded and \nthey braved the streets to register discontent over the Iranian leader's assertion that he would \"not yield\" over the \nelection results, which the government said made incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the winner over \nreformist candidate, Mir Hossein Mousavi.\n\nThere was speculation that the ire of the opposition protestors had fueled, in part, by the well-publicized and horrific \nvideo footage of a young Iranian university student being gunned down as she exited a car and bled to death on the \nstreet. Regardless of their actual motivation, pro-reformist protestors and supporters of Mousavi rallied in the streets \nand clashed with Iranian riot police, according to reports from eye witnesses.  Police fired tear gas at the crowds, \nshot live ammunition into the air, and used clubs to beat some protestors, in an effort to disperse the crowds.  \nThese reports could not be verified by mainstream international journalists, who have been severely restricted from \nfreely reporting post-election developments in Iran.\n\nFor his part, Mousavi was not seen in public, although the wife of the reformist candidate, Zahra Rahnavard, urged \nprotestors to continue their opposition and called for the release of those detained since the disputed election took \nplace. Among those detained were several employees of Mousavi's newspaper as well as 70 academic scholars. \nSpeaking via Mousavi's website,\n\nRahnavard said, \"It is my duty to continue legal protests to preserve Iranian rights.\" she was quoted as saying on \nthe website.\n\nAccording to Reuters, one of Mousavi's fellow presidential candidates, moderate Mehdi Karoubi, joined the chorus \nin denouncing the government as \"illegitimate.\"  Karoubi said,  \"I do not accept the result and therefore consider as \nillegitimate the new government. Because of the irregularities, the vote should be annulled.\"\n\nThe proverbial \"line in the sand\" between the two sides was hardening, because as the reformists and moderates \nstood in solidarity, so too did the conservatives and hard liners join ranks.  In fact, hard line cleric Ahmad Khatami \nsaid that protestors should be dealt with \"severely and ruthlessly\"  and demanded harsh retribution for those daring \nto defy the regime.  Addressing worshippers at Tehran university, he said: \"I want the judiciary to... punish leading \nrioters firmly and without showing any mercy to teach everyone a lesson.\"\n\n\n\nThe streets of Tehran went quiet for a few days but erupted in clashes between riot police and thousands of \nprotestors once again on June 28, 2009.  As before, police used tear gas and clubs against the protestors in an \neffort to disperse the crowds.  One particularly brutal account by eye witnesses involved the beating of an elderly \nwoman close to the Ghoba Mosque.  Again, these reports could not be verified due to severe restrictions on \njournalists working in Iran.\n\nBy the start of July 2009, Iran's military chief, Major General Hassan Firouzabadi, said that the European Union \n(EU) was no longer qualified to participate in talks regarding Iran's nuclear program.  For its part, the EU said it was \nconsidering whether or not to withdraw its ambassadors from Iran in response to the ongoing diplomatic dispute.  \nWhile the United Kingdom was calling for such a move, other countries such as Germany and Italy, have argued \nthat the lines of communication with Iran should be maintained.\n\nAt issue has been the detainment of several British embassy staffers by the Iranian government, which has blamed \nthe United Kingdom for inciting riots among opponents of the regime.\n\nOn the domestic front, the Basij militia in Iran have said that opposition presidential candidate, Mir Hossein \nMousavi, was guilty of propaganda against the state.  Basiij militia also characterized Mousavi as  the ultimate \narchitect of the post-election instability facing the country and called for his prosecution as a result.  For his part, \nMousavi was not backing down.  Indeed, on his own website, Mousavi said, \"It is our historic responsibility to \ncontinue our complaint and make efforts not to give up the rights of the people.\"\n\nMousavi also demanded the release of the \"children of the revolution\" - - an apparent reference to the arrests of \nhundreds of reformist activists.\n\nOn July 8, 2009, weeks after the contested Iranian election, fresh opposition protests erupted in Iran in defiance of \nwarnings by the government that such demonstrations should cease.  Hundreds of protestors nonetheless took to \nthe streets and started marching toward Tehran University.  The march appeared to be symbolically timed to \ncoincide with the 10th anniversary of the 1999 student protests, which saw conflict between pro-reformists and Basij \nmilitia. The protestors chanted \"Death to the dictator,\" and reportedly broke windows of offices and set fire to \ngarbage cans. In response, Iranian police fired tear gas at them in an attempt to quell the crowds.  There were also \nreports that police wrote down the license plate numbers of vehicles from which horns were sounded in solidarity \nwith the protestors.\n\nMeanwhile, two lawyers -- Mohammad Ali Dadkhah and Abdolfatah Soltani -- were detained.  Both individuals have \nbeen aligned with Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi's human rights group, and both have provided legal \nrepresentation to some of the activists who were detained in the aftermath of the contested Iranian presidential \nelection.\n\nIn other developments, a group of clerics known as the Assembly of Qom Seminary Scholars and Researchers, \nhave backed the opposition in Iran by characterizing Iran's presidential election as invalid.  The statement by the \nclerics also condemned moves made by some members of the Guardian Council, saying that they had \"lost their \nimpartial image in the eyes of the public.\"  The declaration was a clear act of defiance against Supreme Leader \nAyatollah Ali Khomeini and laid bare the emerging schism among the establishment of Iran.\n\nIn mid-July 2009, former Iranian President Ali Akbar Rafsanjani called for the release of protestors who were jailed \nduring demonstrations following the contested presidential election. He noted, \"In the current situation it is not \nnecessary for us to have a number of people in prisons... we should allow them to return to their families.\" In a \nsermon delivered at Tehran University, former President  Rafsanjani also said that many Iranians held no faith in \nthe official results of the election, which proclaimed Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to be the winner. He additionally \nasserted that the media should be allowed to discuss the contested and controversial nature of the election openly.  \nTo this end, he said:  \"It is not necessary to pressure media. We should allow them to work freely within the law.\"\n\n\n\nHis words were met by approval from some in the hall who shouted \"Freedom!  Freedom!\" and carried green prayer \nmats to show support for  opposition and reformist candidate, Mir Hossein Mousavi. Viewed as an important player \non the Iranian political scene, former President Rafsanjani was now making it clear that he supported Mousavi. As \nsuch, these assertions made during Iran's all-important Friday prayers were a direct challenge to  Supreme Leader \nAyatollah Ali Khomeini.\n\nAlso attending the prayers was another opposition candidate, Mehdi Karoubi, as well as Mousavi, who urged \nsupporters not to cease their protest actions.  Mousavi's calls appeared to be heeded since outside the university, \nthousands of people wearing green  gathered to rally in the streets.  It was the first public demonstrations in a week. \nAs before, shouts of \"Allahu Akbar\" (God is great) and death to the dictator\" were reported to have been heard.  \nPolice used tear gas to try to disperse the crowd.\n\nInternational Response\n\nAt the international level, what kind of relationship would Iran have with the West? Clearly, finding a negotiated \nsettlement to the ongoing dispute over Iran's nuclear program was not made any easier for the Obama \nadministration in the United States.  As noted by Suzanne Maloney at the Brookings Institute, \"Washington now \nfaces a newly fractured Iranian polity ruled by a leadership that is willing to jettison its own institutions and \nlegitimacy in its determination to retain absolute control. That does not bode well for Iran's capacity to undertake \nserious talks and eventually engage in historic concessions on its nuclear program and support for terrorism.\"\n\nWith these challenges in full view, the United States has not expressed acceptance for the Iranian election results, \nwith the Obama administration preferring to take a cautious \"wait-and-see\" position.  Indeed, the lead from the \nAssociated Press one day after the election was as follows: \"The U.S. on Saturday refused to accept hard line \nPresident Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's claim of a landslide re-election victory in Iran and said it was looking into \nallegations of election fraud.\"  This position was quite distinct from the European Union, which has indicated that it \naccepts that Ahmadinejad is the president, although it acknowledges voting irregularities.\n\nThe United States took a more decisive turn following the violence unfolding in the streets of Iran on June 15, \n2009.  The United States Department of State  said it was \"deeply troubled\" by reports of violence and voting \nirregularities in the election.  As well, President Obama made clear that he was concerned about the safety of the  \nprotestors and their right to be heard in the face of apparent voting irregularities, but he explained that he did not \nwish the United States to be viewed as meddling in Iran's affairs with possible dire results.\n\nOn June 19, 2009, however, as Supreme Leader Khomeini augured a possible crackdown on protestors,  the \nUnited States House of Representatives took an even  more clearly defined line by issuing an almost-unanimous  \ncondemnation of Tehran's handling of the opposition protest movement and in support of fair and democratic \nelections.  The move had  little actual effect on United States foreign policy, which is primarily set in the White \nHouse, but served to issue the most vociferous response from the United States.\n\nAmnesty International said it was \"extremely disturbed\" by the content and tenor of Supreme Leader Khomeini's \nspeech, and warned that it suggested a harsh crackdown on those who continued to voice their opposition.  As well, \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, said that he was  concerned about the \nmagnitude of arrests against opposition supporters and called on Tehran to restrain the  Islamic Basij militiamen.\n\nPresumably in response to the threat of a violent crackdown ensconced in Supreme Leader Khomeini's speech, \nUnited States President Obama warned the Iranian clerical leadership, \"The whole world is watching.\"  Once the \nharsh crackdown against opposition protestors commenced, President Obama demanded that the ruling Iranian \nregime cease its \"violence and unjust action against its own people.\"\n\nPresident Obama also called on  Iran's leaders to \"govern through consent, not coercion.\"  In his strongest \nassertion yet, the American president issued a statement of solidarity with the people of Iran, which read: \"The \n\n\n\nuniversal rights to assembly and free speech must be respected, and the United States stands with all who seek to \nexercise those rights.\"\n\nThe Iranian regimed continued to step up its efforts against Western governments, which it blamed for spurring on \nthe protests.  Indeed, Iran expelled two British diplomats for \"activities incompatible with their status\" and said it was \nconsidering downgrading bilateral ties with the United Kingdom.  In retaliation, the United Kingdom asked two \nIranian diplomats to leave the country.\n\nIran's relationship with the West devolved further after local employees of the British Embassy in Tehran were \narrested.  Iran accused them of inciting protests but British Foreign Secretary David Milliband said Iran was guilty of \n\"harassment and intimidation.\" The European Union issued its own condemnation of the arrests of the embassy \nemployees and demanding their release.  The European bloc also appeared to issue a warning of sorts to Iran via \na statement that read, \"harassment or intimidation of foreign or Iranian staff working in embassies will be met with a \nstrong and collective EU response.\"\n\nAcross the Atlantic, the United States rescinded invitations to Iranian diplomats to attend Independence Day \ncelebrations. On June 25, 2009, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad warned United States President Barack \nObama to \"avoid interfering\" in Iranian affairs. Ahmadinejad was presumably reacting to President Obama's \nforthright critique of Iran's crackdown on the protestors during  a joint news conference with German Chancellor \nAngela Merkel.  President Obama said that the Iranian people had a universal right to assemble and express their \nvoices freely.  He also expressed praise for the opposition demonstrators, saying, \"Their bravery in the face of \nbrutality is a testament to their enduring pursuit of justice. The violence perpetrated against them is outrageous.\" \nThus, in response to the sharpened language coming from the American president, Ahmadinejad posed a question \nof President Obama, \"Do you want to speak with this tone? If that is your stance then what is left to talk about?\" He \nalso accused President Obama of behaving like former President George W. Bush.\n\nBut the international community appeared fairly unified in its condemnation of Iran's treatment of opposition \nprotestors.  Foreign ministers from the major industrialized countries, known as the G8, were meeting in Italy and \nissued a shared statement deploring the post-election violence in Iran. The statement additionally said: \"We \nexpress our solidarity with those who have suffered repression while peacefully demonstrating and urge Iran to \nrespect fundamental human rights.\"\n\nAnalysis: Is this Iran's version of the Velvet Revolution or is this Iran's Tiananmen moment?\n\nThe coverage  discussed above has been set within the context of the 2009 Iranian presidential election and the \nensuing fight between Ahmadinejad and the conservatives versus Mousavi and the reformists.  But this dichotomy, \nto some extent, obfuscates the political complexity of the Iranian scene, as well as the broader political elements \nand dynamics.  Of note is the fact that Ahmadinejad's political fate is inextricably linked to the power of Ayatollah \nKhomeini --and the Supreme Leader's fate is itself intertwined with the political viability of Ahmadinejad.  A \ncontrived election result that reifies the current balance of power, flies in the face of legitimacy, and contravenes \nagainst revolutionary principles about \"people-centered\" power, is sure to not only spark the fire of popular \ndiscontent among Mousavi's supporters, but also certain elements outside his circle. Thus, it was not surprising to \nsee Mousavi's own presidential rivals as well as some of the country's spiritual leaders joining the resistance, as \nnoted above, as a crisis of confidence unfolds.\n\nIn a sense, in the effort to retain Ahmadinejad's power -- under what may arguably be viewed as questionable \ncircumstances --  an anti-establishment protest movement is now coalescing in Iran in the days after the election.  \nNo longer is the attention singularly on Ahmadinejad's presidential power; instead, the focus is moving toward the \npolitical and spiritual establishment of Iran, headed by none other than Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini.\n\nThe 2009 election story remains unfinished at the time of writing.  Will popular resistance -- now evolving into an \nanti-establishment movement --  end in Iran's answer to the Velvet Revolution?  Or will the established order \ncontinue to crackdown in hard line fashion against those who dare dissent and challenge its authority?  And could  \nthat crackdown end for Iran as it did for student protestors at Tiananmen Square decades ago?\n\n\n\nThe stance by Supreme Leader Khomeini augured a strong possibility that those choosing to continue to voice their \nopposition to the government in Tehran would face a harsh crackdown reminiscent of Tiananmen Square two \ndecades ago.  Indeed, that crackdown  already began, as discussed above,  and has -- to some degree --  resulted \nin the sustained suppression of the opposition. As well, Mousavi has shown no sign that he was ready to surrender, \nsaying that he was willing to be a martyr for the cause of political form.\n\nEditor's Note:\n\nWhile limited journalistic access has prevented proper verification of the facts on the ground in Iran, human rights \ngroups have said that hundreds of people, including reformist politicians and activists, journalists, as well as \nlawyers, have been detained since the protests began in June 2009. Many of these individuals were being held on \ncharges that they acted against the interests on national security and, therefore, were at risk of suffering the death \npenalty.  Their situation was not helped by emerging reports that some of these detainees were tortured to extract \nconfessions.  The legal trials of scores of these detainees commenced at the end of July 2009.\n\nRecent Developments on Domestic Scene\n\nMahmoud Ahmadinejad was to be inaugurated for a second term in office as president on Aug. 5, 2009.  But in the \ndays leading up to his inauguration, he found himself mired in a political imbroglio with members of his own hardline \ncamp over key decisions in government and in dealing with detained opposition protestors. Ahead of his swearing \nin ceremony, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad insisted that there was no rift between him and Iran's Supreme Leader \nAyatollah Ali Khomeini.\n\nAt issue was the ongoing political crisis that had gripped the country in the aftermath of the contested June 2009 \npresidential election between incumbent Ahmadinejad and other contenders, including opposition leader Mir-\nHossein Mousavi.  Select exit poll data had signaled a possible win by Mousavi, and even set against contrary exit \npoll date, a close election race was anticipated to be likely.  The official result giving a landslide victory to \nAhmadinejad was soundly rejected by significant portions of the Iranian electorate.  Indeed, it led to demonstrations \nby an outraged public at a level unseen since the Islamic Revolution of 1979, a state of  political strife nationally, \ncondemnation of the election at home and internationally, as well as a brewing power struggle between hardliners \nand reformists among the political establishment.\n\nIt was an extension of this latter issue that was the source of Ahmadinejad's assertions. Given the controversial \nnature of the election outcome, it was not surprising that there were increasing tensions and an ever-increasing \nchasm between hardliners and reformists.  That said, it was somewhat unexpected to find that a rift had emerged \nwithin the hardline or conservative faction of the political class.  One principle cause of consternation was \nAhmadinejad's decision to write a letter to the Iranian judiciary demanding \"maximum Muslim leniency\" toward the \nprotestors and opposition figures who had been  detained, even noting that the \"duration of the detentions has been \nmore than normal.\" This admission tacitly acknowledged claims made by human rights advocates and contradicted \nthe government's own claim that detainees were being fairly treated.\n\nAlso of concern was Ahmadinejad's decision to select his close ally, Esfandiar Rahim-Mashaie, as his deputy in \ndefiance of Supreme Leader Khomeini. Mashaie gained something of a reputation of being culturally liberal.  As \nMinister of Tourism, he invited Israelis to visit Iran, and during a visit to Turkey, he remained at an official dinner \nwith female entertainers. Both moves were not well-received by the ultra-conservatives in government.  Supreme \nLeader Khomeini ordered Ahmadinejad to dismiss Mashaie as a result, but the president refused to comply for over \na week. In the Iranian Islamic system, the Supreme Leader's word was not to be ignored.  Given Khomeini's strong \nsanction of Ahmadinejad as the winner of the contested election, this decision to go against the Supreme Leader \nwas even more pronounced.  Although Ahmadinejad eventually assented to Khomeini's will,\n\nhe nonetheless raised the ire of hardliners and conservatives within his ranks, and also managed to keep Mashaie \nin the presidential fold as his chief of staff and special adviser.\n\n\n\nIn yet another case, which widely seen as an act of defiance, Ahmadinejad fired Intelligence Minister \nGholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei.  The intelligence minister had accused reformist presidential candidates Mir-Hossein \nMousavi and Mehdi Karroubi of having links with foreign powers and inciting instability.  But these views were \ncommon among hardliners and, as such, Ahmadinejad's actions -- to remove Mohseni-Ejei from cabinet along with \nthe short-lived appointment of Mashaie as deputy -- raised the ire of several other hardliners and ultra-\nconservatives, who would normally be Ahmadinejad's natural political allies.\n\nAhmadinejad dismissed the notion of there being problem in his relationship with Iran's Supreme Leader Khomeini.  \nDescribing his connection with Khomeini during a speech in the holy city of Mashhad, Ahmadinejad said: \"This is \nnot a political relationship ... our relationship is based on kindness. It is like a relationship between a father and his \nson.\"  He decried those trying to exploit perceived divisions saying, \"Your efforts will bear no fruit. This road is \nclosed for those devils who dream about harming our relationship. Their dream will be buried along with them.\"\n\nThe situation within the hard-line camp illuminated a complex set of dynamics.  Assuming Ahmadinejad's \nannounced margin of victory in the June 2009 election was correct, then it was plausible that the re-elected \npresident was asserting his political capital.  On the other hand, if the election result was more suspect -- perhaps \neven facilitated by those in power, with the Supreme Leader Khomeini at the helm -- it was plausible that the hard-\nline elite expected to wield the effective power that it nominally  bestowed on Ahmadinejad.\n\nIn the background of these contrary and complicated internal political dynamics was the ongoing state of instability \nin Iran in the aftermath of the contested election. Protests, while less frequent, were still taking place, and usually \nensued to mark a particular threshold or symbolic event.  To this end, protestors gathered to commemorate the \ntragic killing of a young girl,  Neda Agha-Soltan, who became an iconic martyr of the reformist movement during the \nheight of the post-election protests. As before, protestors clashed with security forces, and Iranian riot police used \ntear  gas and the threat of arrests to disperse the crowd.\n\nOpposition leader Mousavi tried to join in the demonstrations but was prevented from doing so by the authorities. \nHard-line and conservative politicians have continued to call for Mousavi's arrest, claiming that he was guilty of \nfomenting dissent and instability in post-election Iran. But for his part, Mousavi has not backed down from his claim \nthat the election result was fraudulent, the new government was \"illegitimate\" and that the Iranian authorities were \nresponsible for killing, harming and detaining  his supporters.  He has been joined by former President Mohammad \nKhatami, who has decried the attacks on the crowds of demonstrators, and also promised to continue to heed the \nreformist call.\n\nOn Aug. 6, 2009 -- one day after Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was inaugurated into office for a second term -- hundreds \nof supporters of opposition leader Mir-Hossein Mousavi  took to the streets to protest and register their opposition.  \nThe protestors marched in defiance of the heavy presence of riot police in Tehran and chanted \"Death to the \ndictator\" as they moved toward Vanak Square.  Meanwhile, a mass trial for those who were arrested in the \nopposition's demonstrations that took place after the contested presidential election.\n\nOn the previous day, several key reformists boycotted Ahmadinejad's inauguration ceremony, flouting Supreme \nLeader Khomeini's authority by refusing to heed his call for unity on that day.  For his part, Ahmadinejad was yet to \npresent a cabinet to parliament for approval. As he moved into his second term, he was faced with detractors on \nboth sides, as noted above.\n\nBy late August 2009, Ahmadinejad was under fire for his choice of cabinet.  While a confidence vote was expected \nin the conservative parliament,  members of parliament expressed objections to his some of his selections. In \nparticular, they objected to his choice for education minister, who was one of three women nominees, on the basis \nof a lack of  experience.\n\nMeanwhile, the international community decried his decision to choose a defense minister-designate, Ahmad \nVahidi, who was  wanted by Interpol in connection with a 1994 bombing of a Jewish center in Argentina that killed \n85 people.  Conversely, this particular selection of Vahidi  was likely to be supported by hardliners in the \nconservative parliament.\n\n\n\nUltimately, while Ahmadinejad's choice of education minister was rejected, another woman -- Marzieh Vahid \nDastjerdi-- was  approved as Iranian health minister.  Dastjerdi, the first female minister in the 30-year history of the \nIslamic republic, was known to be a conservative who has advocated on behalf of gender-segregated health care in \nwhich only female medical professionals treat female patients and only male medical professionals treat male \npatients.  Also, as expected,  Vahidi won strong support in the Iranian parliament despite his alleged involvement in \na terrorist act in Argentina.\n\nMeanwhile, a cadre of former Iranian parliamentarians have called on the country's Assembly of Experts to legally \ninvestigate if Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khomeini should maintain his position of power.  As expressed in a \nletter, which was addressed to former  President Ali Akbar Rafsanjani (the head of the Assembly of Experts), the \nparliamentarians decried the harsh crackdown on protestors who opposed the contested election results that \nreturned Mahmous Ahmadinejad to power over reformist Mir-Hossein Mousavi.  The parliamentarians charged that \nthe Assembly of Experts had a responsibility to do so under the aegis of Article 111 of the constitution, which \nspecifically notes that if the supreme leader  \"becomes incapable of fulfilling his constitutional duties,\" then he can \nbe dismissed. For its part, the Assembly of Experts is one of the most powerful bodies in Iranian governance with \nthe power to remove the person occupying the position of supreme leader.  However, it was yet to be seen if the \nAssembly of Experts would take on the task of directly challenging the sitting supreme leader of the country.\n\nAlso occurring at the same time was a move by a senior cleric, Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami, who called for former \nreformist presidential contender, Mehdi Karroubi Karroubi, to be prosecuted. Karroubi was under fire for his \naccusations that some opposition protestors had been raped or tortured to death while detained in prison. Khatami \nsaid that Karroubi's claims were \"full of libel\" and \"against the Islamic system\" and therefore deserved legal \nconsequences.  He also said that Karroubi's words were a boon to Iran's enemies like the United States and Israel.\n\nThousands of opposition supporters clashed with security forces in Tehran during a pro-Palestinian  rally on Sept. \n18, 2009.  Opposition supporters had been warned not to disrupt the Quds Day event, which was sponsored by the \ngovernment.  While the event began calmly, reformists were not inclined to heed the post-election ban.  The \nsituation took a negative turn when reports emerged that two leading reformists -- opposition leader Mir-Hossein \nMousavi and former President Mohammad Khatami -- were both attacked by loyalists and security forces. \nMeanwhile, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad delivered a speech, which included his often-uttered denial of the \nNazi Holocaust as well as his criticism of the Jewish state of Israel. As before, Western officials condemned his \nremarks. British Foreign Secretary David Miliband characterized Ahmadinejad's denial of the Holocaust as \n\"abhorrent as well as ignorant,\" while the Obama administration  excoriated Ahmadinejad for his \"ignorant and \nhateful\" remarks.\n\nOn Oct. 18, 2009, a suicide bombing left at least 35 people dead and another 30 injured.  Among the dead were \nfive senior officers of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps, including Nour Ali Shoushtari -- the deputy head of the \nRevolutionary Guard Corps' ground forces -- who was mediating talks between Iranian Shi'ites and Sunnis in \nSarbaaz in south-eastern Sistan-Baluchistan.  That area of Sistan-Baluchistan has been predominantly inhabited by \nthe Baluchi ethnic group -- a Sunni Muslim minority in Shi'a-ruled Iran.\n\nWhile some voices in Iran at first placed the blame on the United States for the attack, Iran later accused Pakistan  \nof being behind the suicide bombing.  Indeed, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  said that Pakistani agents were \nbehind the violence and demanded that the Pakistani government arrest those responsible.  Emerging reports have \nsuggested that the Sunni resistance group, Jundullah, might have carried out the attack. However, the Pakistani \nforeign office has denied claims by Iran that Jundullah's leader was in Pakistan.\n\nOn Oct. 21, 2009, Iranian commanders urged their country's authorities to launch an offensive operation  against \nthe Jundullah Sunni resistance group.  In an interview with the Fars news agency, Brigadier General Mohammad \nPakpour, the commander of the Islamic Revolution Guard ground forces, said, \"This is not acceptable to us that \nterrorists enter Iran from a neighboring country and stage terrorist action.\"\n\n\n\nTensions between Iran and Pakistan were further accentuated when on Oct. 26, 2009, Pakistani police arrested 11 \nIranian Revolutionary Guard officers for illegally entering the country via the shared border with Iran in the \nsouthwestern province of Baluchistan.\n\nEditor's Note:\n\nIran's Revolutionary Guard Corps - composed of more than 200,000 members -- was originally established to \nprotect the leaders of the revolution. In recent times, its purpose has been extended to enforce the government's \nstrict Islamic moral codes and to protect Iran's interests, such as oil fields and missile arsenals.\n\nRecent Developments Related to the Nuclear Issue\n\nIn September 2009, the issue of Iran's controversial nuclear program came to the fore.  A report by the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted that Iran's Natanz nuclear plant registered a reduction in the \nnumber of centrifuges used to actively enrich uranium.  Nonetheless, the IAEA also charged that Iran was not \ncooperating in an investigation of allegations that Iran was on the path toward weaponization of uranium.\n\nTo that end, the United States envoy to the IAEA, Glyn Davies, asserted that Iran was continuing to enrich uranium \nin defiance of the United Nations Security Council and could already have garnered sufficient enriched uranium to \neventually produce a nuclear bomb.  At a meeting of the IAEA in Vienna, Davies said, \"We have serious concerns \nthat Iran is deliberately attempting, at a minimum, to preserve a nuclear weapons option.\"\n\nIn response, Iran's envoy to the IAEA, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, argued there had been false accusations about Iran's \nnuclear program  from the United States before.  He said, \"The world is observing curiously whether or not this \n[American] administration follows the same trend as the Bush administration - pursuing hostile political \nconfrontation, using fabricated baseless allegations.\"  Iran has maintained that its nuclear program has only a \ncivilian energy development purpose and that its rocket-building activities would be oriented toward satellites alone.\n\nBut analysts warned that Iran's vociferous defense of its nuclear program could be a strategy intended to stall \nfurther international action that might be in the offing. Indeed, United States President Barack Obama has warned \nIran that its friendly overtures toward engagement with Tehran would expire by the end of September 2009. At that \ntime, the United States president was prepared to pursue new sanctions  against Iran.\n\nMohamed El Baradei, the head of the IAEA, urged Iran to accept the United States' offer of dialogue. Ahead of the \nIAEA meeting in Vienna, he said, \"The U.S. is making an offer without preconditions and on the basis of mutual \nrespect.\" He continued, \"The offer by the U.S. is an offer that should not be refused, that cannot be refused, \nbecause it has no conditions attached to it. And I hope [the] response will be positive.\"\n\nSuch hopes of dialogue were somewhat complicated after Iran put forth its package of proposals to the five  \npermanent United Nations Security Council members and Germany.  According to the independent United States-\nbased entity, ProPublica, the five-page proposal, Iran called for  \"comprehensive, all-encompassing and \nconstructive\" negotiations on a range of security issues, including global nuclear disarmament.  However, the \ndocument detailing Iran's latest proposals on its nuclear ambitions conspicuously failed to mention Iran's own \nnuclear program.\n\nThe United States reacted by registering dissatisfaction with the proposal package.  Philip Crowley, the United \nStates Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, said that the proposed measures failed to address the status \nof Iran's nuclear program.  He said, \"Our concern is that the response itself did not really address what is the core \nissue of the international community and the core concern, which is Iran's nuclear ambitions.\"\n\nConversely, Russia reacted by suggesting that the Iranian proposals signaled positive progress. Russia's Foreign \nMinister Sergei Lavrov said, \"Based on a brief review of the Iranian papers my impression is there is something \nthere to use.\"  Lavrov also indicated that there would be no  oil sanctions against Iran. \"Some of the sanctions \nunder discussion, including oil and oil products, are not a mechanism to force Iran to co-operate, they are a step to \na full-blown blockade and I do not think they would be supported at the United Nations Security Council.\"\n\n\n\nThe American and Russian responses showed divergent approaches to the Iranian nuclear issue, and suggested \nthat consensus on the matter would  not be easily achieved. The controversy surrounding Iran's nuclear program \ntook on greater significance after the IAEA meeting, as discussed above.  If Russia was indicating that  it would not \nsupport strong oil sanctions against Iran, then what options would be available to countries such as the United \nStates, which has made clear that consequences were in the offing if Iran failed to resolve the international \ncommunity's concerns about its nuclear ambitions?\n\nIn mid-September 2009, experts at the United Nations nuclear monitoring agency, the International Atomic Energy \nAgency (IAEA), indicated their belief that Iran could have the ability to manufacture a nuclear bomb.  In a report \ndrafted by IAEA officials, the report titled, \"Possible Military Dimension of Iran's Nuclear Program,\" also intimated \nthat Iran could well be trying to develop a  missile system capable of carrying an atomic warhead.  The document \nwas based on intelligence provided by internal IAEA investigations, external nuclear arms experts, as well as IAEA \nmember states.  Excerpts of this confidential report was made public by the Associated Press.\n\nOf particular concern in the document were the following three findings by the IAEA:\n\n- Iran worked on the development of an internal chamber of a ballistic missile, which would have the capacity to \nhouse a warhead payload described as \"quite likely to be nuclear\"\n\n- Iran may have engaged in \"probable testing\" of explosives used to detonate a nuclear warhead; this method is \nreferred to as \"full-scale hemispherical explosively driven shock system\"\n\n- Iran may have enough technical knowledge to enable the design and production of  an implosion nuclear device \n(i.e. an atomic bomb) \"using highly enriched uranium as the fission fuel\"\n\nMoreover, the document concluded that while Iran was not yet capable of attaching nuclear warheads to its \nShahab-3 medium-range missile, further research and development could lead to the production of a prototype \nsystem.  To that end, the Shahab-3 missile -- with a range of up to 1,250 miles (2,000 kilometers) -- would place \nIsrael within striking distance. Thusly, the IAEA has called on Iran to remove all doubts about its claim of an \nexclusively peaceful civilian nuclear energy program.\n\nThere was some hint that IAEA head, Mohamed ElBaradei, was not keen on sharing the substance of the report, \nwhich some IAEA member states have called a \"secret annex.\"  For its part, the IAEA has referred to the notions of \na \"secret annex\" on Iran as misinformation. With the report now in the public purview, the IAEA did not deny the \nexistence of the document detailing Iran's nuclear record.  Instead, it released a statement noting that the IAEA had \n\"no concrete proof that there is or has been a nuclear weapon program in Iran.\"  This position was similar to \nElBaradei's statement in 2007 in which he maintained that there was no \"concrete evidence\" that Iran was carrying \nout atomic weapons work.\n\nNevertheless, in recent times, ElBaradei has moved away from his typically restrained tone in regard to Iran's \nnuclear program.  He has forthrightly encouraged Iran to cooperate with IAEA investigations and has urged \ndialogue sought by the United States.  Perhaps more importantly, in a private meeting with IAEA board members, \nElBaradei reportedly said that if the intelligence on Iran's alleged nuclear weapons experiments were true, then \n\"there is a high probability that nuclear weaponization activities have taken place - but I should underline 'if' three \ntimes.\"\n\nEarlier in 2009, the IAEA reported that Iran  had produced more than enough low-enriched or fuel-grade uranium for \none nuclear weapon.  Clearly, it was plausible that  Iran's  enrichment capacities may have expanded since that \ntime at the start of the year. Perhaps not surprisingly, that possibility -- in conjunction with this confidential report -- \nhave fueled the prevailing anxieties of countries, such as the United States, Israel and France, who have  already \nexpressed alarm over Iran's controversial nuclear program.  Indeed, despite Iran's enduring insistence that its \nnuclear development has been purely for civilian energy purposes, the United States has long argued that Iran's \nuranium enrichment program could not be simply understood in those terms.  Now, it would seem that the United \nStates' allegations were being bolstered to some degree by the emerging intelligence, its actual accuracy \nnotwithstanding.\n\n\n\nOn Sept. 17, 2009, United States Defense Secretary Robert Gates expressed concern about Iran's apparent \nstalling tactic saying,  \"We are all concerned about Iran running out the clock on us on their nuclear program.\"  He \ncontinued, \"And our view is there is still time for diplomacy and, I might say, sanctions to persuade the Iranians that \ntheir security will be diminished by going down the track of nuclear weapons.\"\n\nFor its part, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khomeini has continued to dismiss allegations that Iran has nuclear \nweapons ambitions.  In a speech broadcast on Iranian state television, Khomeini said, \"We fundamentally reject \nnuclear weapons and prohibit the production and the use of nuclear weapons.\"  But he also took aim at the United \nStates, describing the American government's claims of Iran's nuclear ambitions as being  \"false.\"  He also accused \nthe current Obama administration in the United States as hostile and anti-Iranian despite its seemingly friendly \novertures of engagement.\n\nIn a separate interview with NBC, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said his country had no need for \nnuclear weapons.  He noted, \"We don't need nuclear weapons.  Without such weapons, we are very much able to \ndefend ourselves.\" That said, Ahmadinejad insisted on Iran's right to pursue its own nuclear energy program.  He \nsaid, \"If you are talking about the enrichment of uranium for peaceful purposes, this will never be closed down here \nin Iran.\" In this way, Ahmadinejad was making clear that Iran would not yield to pressure from the international \ncommunity.\n\nWith the controversy surrounding the actual purpose of Iran's nuclear program still percolating, attention fixed on \nthe fate of Israel -- a state Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has repeatedly stated should be \"wiped from \nthe map.\"  The aforementioned intelligence about the possibility of attaching a nuclear bomb to a ballistic missile \ncapable of hitting Israel has only increased fears about regional stability.  Additionally, it certainly has posed \nexistential questions for Israel. With no concurrence on international sanctions against Iran, what options could be \ndeployed against Iran if it failed to satisfy global concerns about its nuclear ambitions?\n\nNeither the United States nor Israel have ever actually foreclosed the possibility of targeted air strikes against Iran, \nwhich would be specifically aimed at preventing that country from obtaining a nuclear weapon.  Russian Prime \nMinister Vladimir Putin entered the fray, speaking against military action and  the imposition of new sanctions \nagainst Iran. Prime Minister Putin characterized any attack on Iran as \"very dangerous\" and warned that it would \nlead to \"an explosion of terrorism.\"  That said, he also called on Iran to show \"restraint\" in its nuclear program and \nto be mindful of Israel's security concerns.  Prime Minister Putin said, \"This is a dangerous region and Iran should \nshow responsibility, especially by taking into account Israel's concerns.\"\n\nOn Sept. 20, 2009, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said during an interview on CNN that Israel had no plans \nto attack Iran.  The Russian leader said that after talks with Israeli President Shimon Peres, he was assured that \nIsrael had no such intent saying, \"My Israeli colleagues told me they were not planning to act in this way, and I trust \nthem.\"  President Medvedev, like his colleague, Prime Minister Putin, warned against military action.  He described \nthe notion of strikes against Iran as  \"the worst thing that can be imagined,\" saying it would lead to a \"humanitarian \ndisaster.\"\n\nIn late September 2009, Iran revealed the existence of a second uranium enrichment plant in defiance of provisions \nset forth in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The second uranium enrichment plant \nwas reported to be an underground facility under construction close to the holy city of Qom.  Diplomatic sources \nindicated that the construction of the facility began in mid-2006, and was in the location of a former missile site \ncontrolled by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.\n\nSpeculation arose about the intent of the Qom site. Some analysts argued that Iran wanted to construct a back-up \nfacility in the event that the Natanz site was attacked.  But experts have also suggested that Iran may endeavor to \nenrich uranium at levels consistent with a nuclear explosion.  Iranian officials have said that Qom facility was not \nyet operational and was intended only for the use of nuclear energy.  Iranian officials also claimed that no nuclear \nmaterial had been introduced to the plant, and that enrichment levels would only be sufficiently high as to make \nnuclear fuel and not a bomb. However, Iranian claims were being met with skepticism since, until this point, Iran \nhad only acknowledged the existence of one uranium enrichment plant at Natanz.\n\n\n\nThe broader issue of Iran's actual nuclear ambitions have remained a matter of debate.  While Iran has insisted \nthat its nuclear activities have been limited to a civilian program and have been oriented toward a peaceful program \nof nuclear energy, the West -- led by the United States -- have long disputed this contention.  Thus, this discovery of \na new nuclear facility close to Qom would likely only bolster the case by the West against Iran.  Indeed, it would \naugment burgeoning plans to impose a stricter sanctions regime on Iran until it suspends all its enrichment \nactivities, as required by the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council.\n\nExperts observed that Iran revealed the news about the covert facility to the United Nations only because it realized \nthat the United States and other Western government had already learned of its existence. For its part, Iranian \nofficials have claimed that the second uranium  enrichment plant was not intended to be a secret. In an interview \nwith Agence France Presse, Ali Akbar Saleri, the head of Iran's nuclear agency, said, \"This installation is not a \nsecret one, which is why we announced its existence to the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency].\"  However, \nthis argument was not likely to be helped by a statement issued by the world watchdog nuclear agency itself, \nwhich intimated that it had only recently been informed of the existence of the facility close to Qom.\n\nIndeed, the revelation by Iran of its covert uranium enrichment facility was preceded by an announcement from the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  Specifically, the IAEA confirmed that Iran acknowledged the \nconstruction of a previously undisclosed facility to manufacture nuclear fuel in a Sept. 21, 2009, letter to the world's \nnuclear watchdog body.  IAEA spokesperson Marc Vidricaire noted: \"I can confirm that on 21 September Iran \ninformed the IAEA in a letter that a new pilot fuel enrichment plant is under construction in the country.\" He \ncontinued, \"The letter stated that the enrichment level would be up to five percent (re: low enriched uranium). The \nAgency also understands from Iran that no nuclear material has been introduced into the facility.\"\n\nSpeaking from the G-20 summit in Pittsburgh, United States President Barack Obama accused  Iran of concealing \nthe construction  of the Qom uranium enrichment plant from the international community and the necessary \ninternational agencies.  He argued that Iran's decision to construct a clandestine nuclear facility represented a \n\"direct challenge to the basic compact\" of the global non-proliferation regime.\n\nAt issue was the fact that Iran's clandestine nuclear activities would be a clear violation of international law. The \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which dates back to 1968, has  189 signatories, \nincluding Iran. According to Article Three of the Treaty:  \"Each Non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty \nundertakes to accept safeguards... for the exclusive purpose of verification of the fulfillment of its obligations \nassumed under this Treaty with a view to preventing diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to nuclear \nweapons or other nuclear explosive devices. Procedures for the safeguards required by this Article shall be \nfollowed with respect to source or special fissionable material whether it is being produced, processed or used in \nany principal nuclear facility or is outside any such facility. The safeguards required by this Article shall be applied \non all source or special fissionable material in all peaceful nuclear activities within the territory of such State, under \nits jurisdiction, or carried out under its control anywhere.\"\n\nGiven this clearly set forth set of rules, Iran -- as a non-nuclear weapons state and party to the Treaty -- must \ncomply with its safeguard agreements, which constitute the core of the agreement. Failure to declare activity related \nto enriching nuclear material would be an ostensible violation of the NPT.\n\nAlmost a week after the revelation about the secret nuclear facility at Qom,  the head of the IAEA, Mohammed \nElBaradei, said that Iran was in violation of the law by not informing his agency of this development sooner.  In an \ninterview with CNN,he said, \"Iran has been on the wrong side of the law in so far as to inform the agency at an \nearlier date.\" He continued, \"Iran was supposed to inform us on the day it was decided to construct the facility. They \nhave not done that.\" The head of the nuclear watchdog also noted,  \"They [the Iranian authorities] are saying that \nthis was meant to be a back-up facility in case we were attacked and so they could not tell us earlier on.\"  In this \nway, ElBaradei put to rest the speculation surrounding Iran's motivation for developing the secret nuclear facility at \nQom.\n\nMeanwhile, as information began to emerge about the Qom facility, there were reports that its size was inconsistent \nwith the  claim of it serving civilian nuclear purposes.  Indeed, it was thought to be capable of accommodating 3,000 \n\n\n\ncentrifuges according to the IAEA -- clearly an amount sizable enough  for manufacturing material for weapons use, \nyet insufficient to power a nuclear reactor.\n\nIronically, Iran's revelation about the new nuclear facility came just one day after world leaders emphasized the \nneed for greater cooperation on nuclear disarmament and against nuclear proliferation.  The ironic timing of the \nrevelation was also emphasized in the fact that Iran was set to engage in comprehensive talks with the five \npermanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, \nChina and France -- as well as Germany.  Those talks were set to convene on Oct. 1, 2009, in Geneva.  It was not \nknown how these latest developments would impact the meeting.  Nevertheless, the news that Iran test-fired two \nshort range missiles, and had plans for a long range missile test,  was not expected to yield positive reactions from \nthe international community.\n\nIranian state television reported that two short-range missiles -- the Tondar-69 and Fateh-110 -- had been test-fired \nduring military exercises.  Both missiles have a range of approximately 100 miles. Iranian state television also \nannounced plans to test fire the long-range Shahab-3 missile, whose range of up to 1,250 miles would place Israel \nwithin striking distance.  Indeed, by Sept. 28, 2009, it was reported that Iran had test-fired not only the ballistic  \nShahab-3  but also the surface-to-surface Sajjil.\n\nThe short-range missile tests raised the ire of the players in the anticipated multilateral talks and were viewed as \ngestures of defiance by Iran. The  test firing of the Shahab-3 was expected to spur condemnation from the \ninternational community, and, conceivably, could be viewed as an unambiguous act of provocation by Iran.  But the \ntest-firing of the Sajjil would likely increase anxiety by the West over Iran's intent, given that missile's use of solid \nfuel, which is regarded as more likely to ensure  accurate delivery than liquid fuel rockets, as well as its longer \nrange potential.\n\nOnly a week earlier, a confidential  IAEA report surfaced in which it was alleged that Iran was working on the \ndevelopment of an internal chamber of a ballistic missile. This internal chamber of a ballistic missile  would have the \ncapacity to house a warhead payload described as \"quite likely to be nuclear.\"  The IAEA document  concluded that \nwhile Iran was not yet capable of attaching nuclear warheads to its Shahab-3 medium-range missile, further \nresearch and development could lead to the production of a prototype system.\n\nDirectly following the revelation about the facility at Qom, the leaders of the United States, the United Kingdom  and \nFrance, condemned the clandestine nature of Iran's nuclear activities in a joint statement.  The key part of that \nstatement read as follows: \"Now, Iran's decision to build yet another nuclear facility without notifying the IAEA \nrepresents a direct challenge to the basic compact at the center of the non-proliferation regime.  These rules are \nclear:  All nations have the right to peaceful nuclear energy; those nations with nuclear weapons must move \ntowards disarmament; those nations without nuclear weapons must forsake them.  That compact has largely held \nfor decades, keeping the world far safer and more secure.  And that compact depends on all nations living up to \ntheir responsibilities.\"\n\nPresident Obama and the other Western leaders additionally demanded that Iran \"act immediately\" in allowing \nUnited Nations nuclear inspectors to investigate the newly-revealed facility, and to satisfy calls for full disclosure on \nIran's nuclear activities. They noted that despite Iran's oft-made claims of a nuclear program for peaceful purposes, \nthe revelation of a second nuclear plant was not consistent with those claims. Flanked by British Prime Minister \nGordon Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President Obama said, \"Iran must comply with U.N. Security \nCouncil resolutions and make clear it is prepared to meet its responsibilities as a member of the community of \nnations.\" Intransigence in the face of this clear demand for compliance would mean that Iran would well face the \nprospect of harsh international sanctions and a tougher sanctions regime, as indicated above.  To that end, \nPresident Obama stressed that Iran would be held accountable for any failure to meet these responsibilities.\n\nEchoing President Obama's unyielding tone, British Prime Minister Brown declared that  his country -- in addition to \nFrance -- were \"at one\" with the United States in responding to Iran's revelation.  He also accused Iran of engaging \nin \"serial deception\" against the international community and, accordingly, there was \"\"no choice but to draw a line \n\n\n\nin the sand\" over the nuclear issue.  Dismissing any pretense of ambiguity, Prime Minister Brown asserted, \"Iran \nmust abandon any military ambitions for its nuclear program.\"\n\nLikewise, French President Nicolas Sarkozy made it apparent that the world would be watching to see if a \"step \nchange\" from Iran was in the offing.  Without such a change, the French leader warned that all options for \nconsequences were \"on the table.\"\n\nWith the prospect of further -- and more stringent -- sanctions looming, attention was focused on Russia and China.  \nThe two permanent members of the United Nations Security Council have historically been reticent about \nresponding harshly to provocative and/or problematic actions by both Iran and North Korea.\n\nThat said, Russia was now indicating that it was more likely to join forces with the Western leaders in this case, \ngiven the recent discovery of Iran's covert nuclear activities. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev explained that \nalthough his country did not normally view the imposition of sanctions as productive, they were nonetheless \n\"inevitable\" in certain cases.  Following a meeting with President Obama, he said, \"We need to help Iran to [make] \nthe right decisions.\"\n\nOn the other hand, China was not yet ready to move in that direction.  Indeed, China's Foreign Ministry \nspokeswoman, Jiang Yu, called for a redoubling of diplomatic efforts.  Jiang  said, \"We believe that sanctions and \nexerting pressure are not the way to solve problems and are not conducive for the current diplomatic efforts on the \nIran nuclear issue.\" It should be noted that this statement from China was a repetition of its long-standing policy of \nnon-interference and, hence,  not to be interpreted as the final position on the matter.  To that end, United States \nsources said the Chinese were still digesting the new information about Iran's secret nuclear plant.\n\nMultilateral talks on Iran's nuclear program ensued in Geneva several days after the revelation about the Qom \nfacility and despite  Iran's volley of missile tests.  Iran's foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, described the \nnegotiations as having taken place in a \"constructive\" atmosphere.  The meeting included Iran, the five permanent \nmembers of the United Nations Security Council, and Germany, and marked the first return to the negotiating table \nsince mid-2008 when previous talked ended in a stalemate.  This time, the talks ended with an agreement to \ncontinue the dialogue. Javier Solana,  the European Union's foreign policy chief, explained  that all parties had \n\"agreed to intensify dialogue in the coming weeks\" and hold further discussions before the end of October 2009.\n\nThat said, President Obama of the United States  warned that his country's patience with Iran was \"not unlimited.\"  \nHe said, \"We're committed to serious and meaningful engagement, but we're not interested in talking for the sake \nof talking.\"  As well, President Obama urged that Iran take the necessary actions to prove its peaceful intentions \nsaying, \"Iran must take concrete steps to build confidence that its nuclear program will serve peaceful purposes.\" \nPresident Obama additionally reiterated his demand that IAEA nuclear inspectors be granted \"unfettered access\" to \nIran's second uranium enrichment facility within a two week time frame.\n\nBeyond the multilateral negotiations, there was also a rare bilateral meeting between the United States and Iran \nthat took place with Undersecretary of State, William Burns, and Tehran's chief nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, in \nattendance. After that meeting, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton echoed President Obama's tone, \nacknowledging the significance of the occasion, but nonetheless noting that action and not just words and gestures \nwere needed from  Iran.\n\nTo that end, on Oct. 1, 2009, Iran said it would soon open its Qom plant for inspection in a move that averted an \nimmediate global confrontation. In an interview with the BBC, the foreign policy head of the European bloc, Javier \nSolana, asserted: \"Iran has told us that it is plans to co-operate fully and immediately with the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency on the new enrichment facility near Qom, and will invite experts from the agency to visit soon, we \nexpect in the next couple of weeks.\"  In fact, the IAEA acknowledged that its inspectors would visit the nuclear site \nat Qom on Oct. 25, 2009. The head of the IAEA, Mohammed ElBaradei, said, \"I see that we are shifting gears from \nconfrontation into transparency and co-operation. I continue, of course, to call on Iran to be as transparent as \npossible.\"\n\n\n\nIndeed, as scheduled, a team of IAEA inspectors carried out its inspection at the facility close to Qom. Details \nrelated to the visit were not disclosed. While this procedure signaled Iranian cooperation, a report by the \nWashington Post indicated that senior United States officials believed that the nuclear plant was emblematic of \nIran's desire to weaponize.\n\nIran also agreed to a plan to transport some of its low-enriched uranium (LEU) for reprocessing outside Iran's \nborders. The plan would involve enrichment in Russia and  the fabrication of fuel assemblies in France. This LEU \nwould be used in an IAEA-monitored research reactor producing medical isotopes, and would serve medical \nresearch purposes, while also reducing Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium.  The evident benefit would be that \nIran's LEU could no longer be enriched to the point that it could facilitate weaponization. Stated another way, Iran's \nnuclear breakout capabilities would be curtailed. A follow-up meeting between officials from Iran, the United States, \nFrance and Russia was scheduled for Oct. 19, 2009, in Vienna to discuss the particulars of this plan for the Tehran \nResearch.\n\nBy late October 2009, Iran missed the deadline to respond to the compromise plan advanced by the United \nNations. That said, Iran's foreign ministry indicated a willingness to move forward with a plan to send its enriched \nuranium elsewhere for reprocessing. The IAEA confirmed that Iran did eventually submit a reply, the details of \nwhich were reported to have included significant changes ensconced within the original deal.\n\nThese moves have been cast as part of the \"freeze-freeze\" package of incentives by the West, whereby a halt on \nIran's centrifuges could well result in a withdrawal of sanctions.  Augmenting this proposal were President Obama's \nassurances that he would stand by a 2008 package of incentives that included security commitments to Iran.  It was \nyet to be seen if Iran would agree totally to the \"freeze-freeze\" proposal. Indeed,  Iran has not yet agreed to \ncompletely halt its nuclear enrichment activities, and this shift in direction by Iran toward cooperation remained in \nthe genesis stages.\n\nIran commenced five days of war  exercises spanning  230,000 square miles of territory.\n\nThe central objective of these large-scale exercises was to practice thwarting potential aerial attacks on its nuclear \nfacilities.  In an interview on Iranian state media, the head of Iran's air defense -- Brigadier General Ahmad Mighani \n-- explained that the war games were intended \"to display Iran's combat readiness and military potentials.\"  In this \nway, Iran was extroverting an aggressive military stance in an effort to stave off strikes on its nuclear facilities.\n\nOther Iranian officials warned of retaliation in response to any attempt by foreign entities to target its nuclear sites. \nTo that end, Iran warned it would not hesitate to carry out a retaliatory missile strike on Tel Aviv if  its nuclear \nfacilities were attacked by Israel. Mojhtaba Zolnoor, an aide to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khomeini, \nissued the following statement: \"If the enemy attacks Iran, our missiles will strike Tel Aviv.\"  In an interview with the \nFars News Agency, Amir Ali Hajizadeh -- the commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards' air force wing -- offered \nhis own warning to Israel as follows: \"Their [Israeli] F-15 and F-16 fighters will be trapped by our air defense forces \nand will be annihilated.\"\n\nIt should be noted that such action by Israel -- or even the United States -- has never been foreclosed.  Indeed, both \ncountries have reserved the right to launch targeted strikes against Iran's nuclear sites in order to crush Iran's \nnuclear proliferation capacity.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran also failed to gain the goodwill of the main players in the global community when it rejected a \nprevailing proposal to transport some of its low enriched uranium outside its borders for processing into fuel rods for \nthe Tehran Research Reactor.  The proposal (discussed above), which was brokered by the United Nations' \nnuclear watchdog entity, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), was intended to provide Iran with a means \nfor its research reactor to produce medical isotopes, while also reducing Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium.  The \nevident benefit would be that Iran's uranium could no longer be enriched to the point that it could facilitate \nweaponization.\n\n\n\nIran said that rather than comply with the IAEA compromise proposal, it was considering the purchase of enriched \nuranium instead.  In an interview with the Mehr News Agency, Kazem Jalali said: \"Purchase of uranium enriched to \nthe level of 20 percent is the best option to supply the fuel needed for the Tehran reactor.\" The spokesperson for \nthe Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Commission continued, \"Production of 20 percent enriched uranium \ninside Iran is another option on the table.\"\n\nIran's rejection of the proposal that it had earlier embraced was a blow to the diplomatic process.  Consequently, a \nmultilateral bloc composed of the United Nations Security Council's permanent members (China, France, Russia, \nthe United Kingdom and the United States) and Germany  called on Iran to  reconsider its position.  In fact, the \nUnited Nations Security Council urged Iran to work cooperatively on a resolution, given the fact that it had already \napproved three rounds of sanctions, should Iran continue its existing uranium enrichment activities.  As if to \nunderscore this possible outcome, Russian President Dimitry Medvedev warned that Iran could face new sanctions \nif it failed to take quick action in assuaging global doubts and suspicions about its nuclear ambitions.\n\nThese recent actions by Iran -- its show of military force as well as the rejection of the IAEA compromise proposal -- \ncame at a time when that country was faced with sharp pressure from the international community to prove its claim \nthat its nuclear development program was oriented toward nuclear energy generation.  Despite Iran's insistence \nthat its nuclear ambitions have had a peaceful purpose, its failure to comply with the IAEA compromise proposal, as \nwell as the recent revelations about a clandestine nuclear facility at Qom (discussed above), have only bolstered \nthe United States' accusation that Iran seeks to build a nuclear bomb.\n\nAs of November 2009, Iran's nuclear facility at Qom was the central focus of the nuclear debate.  A report by the \nIAEA asserted  that  the underground nuclear enrichment facility was \"in an advanced state.\"  While IAEA \ninspectors noted that no centrifuges were yet installed, they nonetheless confirmed that the Qom nuclear plant was \ndesigned to accommodate 3,000 centrifuges.  As aforementioned, this amount was sufficient for the production of \none or two nuclear  weapons on an annual basis, yet insufficient to power a civilian nuclear reactor.\n\nThese findings formalized the previous reports made in September 2009, however, the IAEA went further in noting \nthat Iran's reluctance to disclose the existence of the Qom facility \"reduces the level of confidence in the absence of \nother nuclear facilities under construction, and gives rise to questions about whether there were any other nuclear \nfacilities in Iran which had not been declared to the agency.\"\n\nThe IAEA Board of Governors was scheduled to meet on Nov. 26, 2009 to discuss these issues in the broader \ncontext of Iran's actions related to its controversial nuclear program.  Of central importance was Iran's rejection of a \nbroad compromise agreement, which would theoretically allow Iran to continue nuclear development at the Tehran \nResearch Reactor by transporting low enriched uranium outside its borders for processing, while simultaneously \nreducing Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium and curtailing nuclear breakout activity.\n\nAnalysts suggested that the IAEA  Board of Governors could very well conclude that Iran's clandestine Qom facility \nwas constructed in violation of nuclear non-proliferation safeguards, effectively referring Iran to the United Nations \nSecurity Council, with serious consequences to follow. Such a move would likely trigger further Iranian defiance and \nwould invariably contribute to the devolution of the diplomatic process.  Should Iran decide to reconsider the IAEA \ncompromise proposal  for the Tehran Research Reactor, then it was possible that the anticipated referral of Iran to \nthe United Nations Security Council could be offered in softer tone (i.e. without setting an absolute course towards \nsanctions).\n\nBy late November 2009, the governing body of the IAEA passed a resolution condemning Iran for developing a \nclandestine uranium enrichment site at Qom.  The IAEA's governing body also demanded that Iran freeze its \nactivities at Qom immediately. It was the first resolution to be passed against Iran in four year and had strong \nsupport from the vast majority of the board members.  Indeed, the resolution  passed by a 25-3 margin with six \nabstentions. The resolution gained crucial backing from China and Russia, who appeared to have been frustrated \nby Iran's intransigence on the nuclear development controversy and its refusal to assent to the aforementioned \ncompromise proposal. Their support for the rebuke indicated possible -- albeit not guaranteed -- support for \nsanctions in the future.\n\n\n\nBritish Prime Minister Gordon Brown warned that stiff sanctions were in the offing for Iran if it did not respond \ngeneratively to this rebuke from the international community.  Speaking from a Commonwealth summit in Trinidad \nand Tobago, he said, \"I believe the next stage will have to be sanctions if Iran does not respond to what is a very \nclear vote.\" Russia's Foreign Ministry urged Iran to respond to this development \"with full seriousness\" to the \nresolution. Striking a similar tone, the White House in the United States warned that Iran would have to address \n\"the growing international deficit of confidence in its intentions.\"\n\nBut rather that taking a moderating position to these developments, Iran's reaction was one of defiance instead.  \nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ramin Mehmanparast characterized the IAEA vote as \"a theatrical move \naimed at pressuring Iran,\" which he promised would be  \"useless\", according to the IRNA state news agency.  \nThen, Iran threatened to reduce its cooperation with the IAEA, stopping just short of breaking ties completely.  \nIntensifying the stakes, Iran's government additionally announced that it intended to build 10 new uranium \nenrichment sites. These three moves were contrary to the desired response sought by the international community \nand made clear that negotiations on Iran's nuclear program had reached a stalemate.\n\nUnderscoring that stalemate, the head of the IAEA, Mohammed ElBaradei, noted that his inspectors had seen little \ncooperation from the Iranian authorities and, as such, the IAEA had made no progress in its attempts to verify the \nso-called peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program. El Baradei also issued a rare and gloomy depiction of the \nnegotiating landscape.  He said, \"It is now well over a year since the agency was last able to engage Iran in \ndiscussions about these outstanding issues. We have effectively reached a dead end, unless Iran engages fully \nwith us.\"\n\nEditor's Note:\n\nThe existence of Iran's nuclear facility at Qom is very likely a violation of international law. The Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which dates back to 1968, has  189 signatories, including Iran. According \nto Article Three of the Treaty:  \"Each Non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes to accept \nsafeguards... for the exclusive purpose of verification of the fulfillment of its obligations assumed under this Treaty \nwith a view to preventing diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons or other nuclear \nexplosive devices. Procedures for the safeguards required by this Article shall be followed with respect to source or \nspecial fissionable material whether it is being produced, processed or used in any principal nuclear facility or is \noutside any such facility. The safeguards required by this Article shall be applied on all source or special fissionable \nmaterial in all peaceful nuclear activities within the territory of such State, under its jurisdiction, or carried out under \nits control anywhere.\"  Given this clearly set forth set of rules, Iran -- as a non-nuclear weapons state and party to \nthe Treaty -- must comply with its safeguard agreements, which constitute the core of the agreement. Failure to \ndeclare activity related to enriching nuclear material would be an ostensible violation of the NPT.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\nOn  Dec. 16, 2009, Iran said it had successfully test-fired an advanced variant of its Sajjil-2 ballistic missile.  If \nconfirmed, this test would demonstrate an acceleration of Iran's missile development program, given the fact that \nthe two-stage Sajjil-2 was powered by solid fuel, effectively affording it greater range and accuracy than the liquid-\nfueled Shehab-3 missiles typically used by Iran. The Sajjil-2 was also known to have a more advanced guidance \nsystem. It should be noted that Iran test-fired a Sajjil-1 missile  earlier, evoking similar fears about that country's \nintent and its advances related to the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles used to carry nuclear \nwarheads.  For his part, Iran's Defense Minister Ahmad Vahid said that the test-firing exercise was intended to \nshow Iran's deterrent capabilities.  Regardless, the missile test appeared to be a clear act of defiance against the \nWest and Israel, which has become increasingly alarmed about Iran's nuclear ambitions.  The United States \nresponded by saying that its Missile Defense Agency in the Pacific would  conduct a missile test of its own in \nJanuary 2010.\n\nMiscellaneous Recent  Developments\n\n\n\nOn Dec. 18, 2009, Iran briefly seized control over an Iraqi oil well.  Reports stated that Iranian troops entered the \nsouthern part of  Iraq and raised the Iranian flag over the Fakkah oil field.  Iraq's Deputy Interior Minister Ahmed Ali \nal-Khafaji first denied these actions took place but subsequently confirmed that the Iranian troops were in Iraq and \nhad control of the oil well. Iraqi officials  then appeared to downplay the incident by saying that the area at stake  \nwas a disputer border region. On the other side of the equation, Iran denied taking control of any oil well inside Iraqi \nterritory.\n\nDecember 2009 also saw the re-emergence of the reformists versus the hardliners on the political scene. The \npolitical opposition in Iran, led by  Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, called for supporters to turn out in \nlarge numbers in the holy city of Qom for the funeral of one of the country's most well-known clerics. Grand \nAyatollah Hoseyn Ali Montazeri was once designated to be the successor to the revolutionary leader, Ayatollah \nKhomeini.  However, he eventually parted ways with Khomeini, arguing that the 1979 revolution never brought \nabout liberation it promised, but instead imposed a dictatorship on the people.  He also criticized human rights \nabuses in Iran.  His stand against the theocratic establishment of Iran reached its apex in the aftermath of the \ncontroversial and disputed presidential election of 2009, in which he joined the political opposition in alleging \nelectoral fraud. Since then, the Iranian leadership has referred to Montazeri as \"the rioters' cleric.\" His funeral was \nexpected to spur political activism by the reformists.\n\nBy late December 2009, Iran was embroiled in an explosion of anti-government protests. The demonstrations \ncoincided with important Shi'a Muslim celebration of Ashura, which marks the death of Imam Hussein, a grandson \nof the Prophet Muhammad, in the seventh century.  Ashura has a strong historical and symbolic legacy  for \nShi'ites.  According to Shi'ites,  Hussein and his small group of companions numbering less than 100 fought with,  \nand were massacred by,  the army of the governor of Kufa.  The holy festival brought heavy crowds of opposition \nand reformist supporters to the streets of the  Iranian capital of Tehran -- some of them boldly chanting \"Khomeini \nwill be toppled\"  and \"this is the month of blood.\"\n\nThe political opposition and reformist factions had hoped the symbolism of the day (the martyrdom of Hussein \nagainst the established powers) would inspire heavy turnout, and such an end was realized -- possibly even \nexceeding expectations.  That said, the scenario was marked by violent confrontation and death.\n\nIndeed, on Dec. 27, 2009, at least eight opposition protestors were killed during these anti-government \ndemonstrations in  Tehran when security forces opened fired on the crowd.  Among the dead was the nephew of \nreformist leader and opposition presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi. In the northwestern part of the country, \nand in cities of Isfahan and Najafabad, further deaths were reported on opposition websites, although there has \nbeen little confirmation from mainstream international media due to journalistic limits imposed by the government.\n\nDespite the bloodshed and attempts to disperse crowds using tear gas, Iranian security forces  had trouble \nsubduing the protestors who continued to gather at state-run radio and television headquarters, and eventually filled \nlarge swaths of central Tehran.  Faced with this rather unprecedented defiance by the opposition support base,  the \nauthorities began to round up  several opposition activists and figures.  Among those detained were senior aides to \nMir Hossein Mousavi and a former foreign minister.\n\nAt the political level, a dichotomy is becoming more entrenched in Iran.  On one end of the spectrum is the \nautocratic and hardline leadership of the country, which seems unwilling to acknowledge a groundswell of post-\nelection opposition discontent, which shows little sign of being quelled.  But on the other side of the spectrum, that \nopposition and reformist faction is bereft of leadership and without tangible means of upsetting the balance of \npower.  Indeed, despite Western hopes that these demonstrations augur the spread of a new and democratizing \nrevolution across Iran, it is far more likely that Iran's fundamental core of power -- Ayatollah Khomeini backed by the \nRevolutionary Guard -- will take an even harder line with dissenters, thrusting the country further in the direction of \ndictatorship.\n\nAt the international level, the Western world has had to strike a delicate balance between registering discontent \nover the clear human rights violations of Iranian citizens, and appearing too supportive of the opposition and \nreformist factions -- a stance that might work against those elements in Iran.  The Obama administration in the \n\n\n\nUnited States had thusly vociferously condemned the  \"unjust suppression of civilians in Iran,\" while the French  \nforeign ministry condemned the \"arbitrary arrests and the violent actions\" taken against protesters defending \"their \nright to freedom of expression and their desire for democracy.\"\n\nIn his first commentary since the death of his nephew and other anti-government protestors, Iranian opposition \nleader Mir Hossein Mousavi said he was not afraid to die for the reformist cause.  On his website, Mousavi posted \na statement which read: \"I am not unwilling to become a martyr like those who made that sacrifice after the election \nfor their rightful national and religious demands.\"\n\nMousavi also posted a five-point solution to the post-election crisis gripping Iran in which he called for the creation \nof a \"transparent\" election law, the release of political prisoners, the recognition of media freedom, and the right of \npopular assembly. Mousavi also demanded that the government, parliament and judiciary accept \"direct \nresponsibility\" for the situation, saying \"I say openly that until there is an acknowledgement of the existence of a \nserious crisis in the country, there will be no possibility of resolving the problems and issues.\" He additionally \ndismissed accusations by Iranian hardliners that opposition activists have incited unrest. The opposition leader \nobserved as well that  the arrest or death of either himself or other opposition leaders would \"not calm the \nsituation.\"\n\nIt was deemed to be the most defiant opposition treatise in Iran in recent memory and appeared aimed at Iran's \nclerical leadership, which has sanctioned draconian measures against opposition activists, even going so far as to \ncall for the execution of Mousavi and others.\n\nOn July 16, 2010, around 30 people were killed and at least 100 others were injured as a result of twin suicide \nbomb attacks at the Jamia Grand Mosque in the city of Zahedan, located in the Sistan-Baluchestan province of \nIran. The attack occurred as worshippers marked the anniversary of the birth of Imam Hussein, grandson of the \nProphet Muhammad. Among the dead were members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard. While there was no \nimmediate claim of responsibility, the location of the attacks in remote and restive Sistan-Baluchestan -- the site of a \nSunni Jundallah insurgency - caused suspicion to be cast on this particular movement. Indeed, Iranian media soon \nreported that Jundullah was, in fact, claiming responsibility for the bombings, which it said had been carried out the \nattacks in retaliation for the hanging of its leader a month earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, Iranian authorities posited the theory that at least one of the suicide bombers was dressed in women's \nclothing. The clerical leadership of Iran also cast blame on the United States, which they said was sympathetic to \nJundallah and anxious to cause instability within its borders. Despite this accusation by Iran, United States \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned the attacks and urged that the perpetrators be apprehended and \nbrought to justice.\n\nOn September 3, 2010, pro-government mobs attacked the residence of reformist opposition leader, Mehdi \nKarroubi. The notorious Basij pro-government militia attacked Karroubi's home with firebombs, leaving it \ndevastated; they also beat a bodyguard to the point of unconsciousness. Karroubi was at home at the time of the \nattack but was not injured himself. These acts by the Basij constituted a clear warning against all those daring to \nshow signs of dissent, given the timing of the attack -- only hours ahead state-sanctioned rallies. Despite the force \nof the opposition's expression in the period following the contested presidential election of 2009, Iran in 2010 was a \nplace where political activism unsupportive of the current hardline regime would be subject to harsh oppression. \nThe fact that Karroubi's home was the latest target of the hardline crackdown on dissent was not a surprise. In \nrecent times, Karroubi -- a cleric and former parliament speaker -- has been one of the more outspoken opposition \nvoices in Iran. Of course, such dissention has come with a price, as seen by the attacks on his home and his \nbodyguard.  By mid-September 2010, security forces attacked the office of Mir Hussein Moussavi, the former \npresidential candidate and Iranian opposition leader, seizing his computers and other property.\n\nIranian prosecutors said that they were building a case against both Mousavi and Karroubi, warning that both \nreformist opposition figures would soon face trial.\n\n\n\nDecember 2010 saw President Ahmadinejad sack Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki while the country's top \ndiplomat was on an official visit to Africa. Mottaki was replaced by nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi. For his part, \nMottaki criticized Ahmadinejad for the move, saying that the dismissal in absentia was \"un-Islamic, undiplomatic \nand offensive.\"\n\nOn Dec. 15, 2010, a suicide bombing at the Imam Hossein Mosque in the Iranian south-eastern city of Chabahar \nleft around 40 people dead. Women and children were among the victims and it appeared that pilgrims \ncommemorating the Shi'a festival of Ashura were the targets of the attack. The location of the suicide bombing -- \nSistan-Baluchistan province -- has been beset by sectarian violence, with the predomninatly Sunni population of the \narea railing against Iran's Shi'a majority. Perhaps not surprisingly, the extremist Sunni Muslim group Jundullah \nclaimed responsibility for the attack. Jundullah has been known to operate along Iran's border with Pakistan and \ntwo suicide bombings in Zahedan on the border in mid-2010 were blamed on the group. Throughout, the \ngovernment of Iran has suggested links between Jundullah and the United States; however the United states \nDepartment of State has designated Jundullah to be a terrorist group.\n\nOn Feb. 14, 2011, thousands of opposition supporters took to the streets in the Iranian capital of Tehran. Other \nprotests were reported across the country in Isfahan, Mashhad and Shiraz. This mass action came on the heels of \nthe successful \"Jasmine Revolution\" in Tunisia, followed by the successful \"Nile Revolution\" in Egypt, both of which \nswept the \"old guard\" from power in those respective countries.\n\nIran, though, was not home to a government struggling with the question of how to express power and authority in \nthe face of a tumultuous political climate. Instead, thehard line government wasted no time in deploying security \nforces to the streets, using tear gas against protesters, and detaining scores -- if not hundreds -- of people daring to \nparticipate in anti-government demonstrations.\n\nDays earlier, Iranian opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi, and Mehdi Karroubi had been placed under house \narrest. That move was clearly intended to stop Mousavi and Karroubi from not only participating in the protests, but \nalso issuing rallying calls for opposition supporters of the unsuccessful \"Green Revolution\" in that country only a \nfew years earlier, which never managed to accomplish a shift in governance.\n\nStill, these moves at repressing the protesters paled in comparison to the brutal crackdown on pro-opposition \nsupporters during the time of the Green Revolution and the months that followed. Scores of people were killed \nand/or detained at that time.\n\nUnited States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned against the government's use of violence and applauded \nthe rights and aspirations of the protesters. She said, \"We are against violence and we would call to account the \nIranian government that is once again using its security forces and resorting to violence to prevent the free \nexpression of ideas from their own people.\" Clinton continued, \"Secondly, we support the universal human rights of \nthe Iranian people. They deserve to have the same rights that they saw played being out in Egypt and that are part \nof their own birthright.\" Turkish President Abdullah Gul, on a trip to Iran, warned that countries trying to repress their \npeople would serve only to ignite mass action against the government. He said, \"When leaders and heads of \ncountries do not pay attention to the demands of their nations, the people themselves take action to achieve their \ndemands.\"\n\nNote that by Feb. 20, 2011, Faezeh Hashemi Rafsanjani, the daughter of reformist  former President Akbar \nHashemi Rafsanjani, was arrested in Tehran for participating in a banned protest march.  Official state media said \nthat Rafsanjani was being held in due to her \"blunt statements\" and because she used \"provocative slogans.\"\n\nThe Iranian government's desire to silence and suppress the opposition took a dire turn on Feb. 28, 2011 when it \nwas reported that the country's two most well-known opposition leaders, Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mahdi Karroubi, \nas well as their wives, Zahra Rahnavard and Fatemeh Karroubi, were taken to  the Heshmatieh  prison in Tehran.  \nThe two opposition figures had already been placed under house arrest so their transfer to the prison was regarded \nas a new sign of the Iranian regime's intent to deal harshly with any and all threats to its power.\n\n\n\nIn the first part of May 2011, a feud unfolded between Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and President \nMahmoud Ahmadinejad. According to Morteza Agha-Tehrani, a stalwart of the president, Khamanei has issued an \nultimatum to Ahmadinejad over the inclusion of a certain candidate for a cabinet post. At issue was Khamenei's \ndemand for the reinstatement of Hevar Moslehi as Intelligence Minister who was relieved of his portfolio by \nAhmadinejad. Failing to ultimately go the way of Khamenei's dictate would end in Ahmadinejad's resignation. Even \nwith this threat upon him, the Iranian president, in a rare show of intransigence, was not quick to assent to the \ndemand.\n\nWhile it is generally known that Iranian presidents wield operational power and the Guardians Council and the \nAyatollah hold ultimate power in Iran, overt autocratic power is rarely wielded in such a manner. Thus, the fight over \nMoslehi has been interpreted as a proxy for an increasing chasm between the two men on the Iranian political \nlandscape.\n\nAs May 2011 came to a close, the precariousness of Ahmadinejad's political position was in sharp relief when an \nIranian court barred one of the president's allies, Vice President Hamid Baqaie, from holding office for four years \ndue to \"violations\" while in a previous job as the head of Iran's Cultural Heritage and Tourism Organization. The \ncourt did not furnish any details about the so-called violations. As well, a constitutional watchdog agency \noverturned a decision by Ahmadinejad to temporarily assume the position of oil minister. As before, Ahmadinejad \nappeared to be under pressure from the ultra-conservative elements of the Iranian power base yet the government \nof Iran has dismissed reports of there being any power struggle.\n\nA dark cloud settled over Iran's already-repressed anti-government movement in mid-2011.\n\nAt issue was the disappearance of a well-known opposition leader and activist, Mehdi Karroubi, who had come to \nthe fore at the height of the reformist anti-government uprising, known as the \"Green Revolution,\" following the \ncontested presidential elections of 2009.  It should be noted that the \"Green Revolution\" ended unsuccessfully with \nthe deaths and incarceration of opposition activists, and a harsh crackdown by the theocratic and totalitarian Iranian \nauthorities on dissent.\n\nIn February 2011, according to the opposition website Kaleme, both Karroubi and the \"Green Revolution\" leader, \nMir Hossein Mousavi, were taken to the Heshmatiyeh prison in the capital city of Tehran. They were respectively \ndetained after calling on the Iranian people to once again take to the streets in demonstrations.  Clearly, in an effort \nto short-circuit any displays of anti-government dissent, the Iranian authorities wasted no time in incarcerating the \ntwo opposition icons, whom they have accused of treason and threatened with execution. Now, at the close of \nAugust 2011,  Iranian and international human rights activists were expressing \"extreme concern\" over the welfare \nof Karroubi, who had been missing for as many as six weeks.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Hadi Ghaemi, the director of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, said: \n\"We are extremely concerned for the health and well-being of Karroubi, who is 74 years old, and no one has heard \nfrom him for six weeks, not his wife, any family or associates.\"  Ghaemi also expressed fear that Karroubu was \nbeing subject to coercive \"brainwashing\" while in custody.\n\nIn an interview with  the American television station, NBC News, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  said \nthat two American hikers jailed for spying in Iran would soon be released. In a separate interview with the \nWashington Post, President Ahmadinejad explained that the release would be permitted  as \"a humanitarian \ngesture.\"\n\nThe hikers -- Shane Bauer and Joshua Fattal -- have been in Iranian custody since their arrest in 2009, and were \nsentenced to prison for eight years in mid-2011.  Harsh sentences for the two Americans raised already-poor \nrelations between Iran and the United States, especially since the Obama administration has strenuously denied \nthat Bauer and Fattal were involved in any  intelligence activities.  A third hiker, Sara Shourd, was arrested along \nwith Bauer and Fattal, but was released  in September 2010 on medical and humanitarian grounds. Now a year \nlater, Iranian authorities were indicating that the two men could also be released after paying bail of $500,000 each.\n\n\n\nIn response to the news, United states Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that she was encouraged and noted, \n\"We hope we will see a positive outcome from what appears to be a decision by the [Iranian] government.\"  The \ndecision to release the two Americans came ahead of a visit by President Ahmadinejad to the United States for a \nmeeting of the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 22, 2011.\n\nA day before -- on Sept. 21, 2011 -- reports emerged from Iran that the two hikers had been released on bail (as \ndiscussed above) and were being flown from that country to Oman. It was not known who actually paid the total bail \namong of one million dollars.  It should be noted that the release of Bauer and Fattal had been brokered by the \nKingdom of Oman.  United States President Barack Obama reacted to the news of their release as follows: \"The \ntireless advocacy of their families over these two years has won my admiration, and is now coming to an end with \nJosh and Shane back in their arms.\"\n\nIt was not know if the careful timing of the release held particular political significance.  Was it intended to help \nAhmadinejad who was sure to encounter protests on United States soil at the meeting of the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly?  Or was it intended to thaw abysmal relations between Tehran and Washington, in the context \nofIran's controversial nuclear program?\n\nRegardless, after their release, once home on United States soil, Fattal and Bauer wasted no time in opening up \nabout their detention in Iran and the charges against them.  The two American hikers  rebuked Iran  for their ordeal \nthat had gone on for years, asserting  that they had been detained because of their American nationality,  and not \nbecause they may  have illegally crossed the border from Iraq into Iran.  To this end, Fattal said: \"From the very \nstart, the only reason we have been held hostage is because we are American. Iran has always tied our case to its \npolitical disputes with the U.S.\"\n\nHe continued by noting that although he and Bauer applauded the Iranian authorities \"for finally making the right \ndecision,\" they nonetheless  \"do not deserve undue credit for ending what they had no right and no justification to \nstart in the first place.\"\n\nOn Nov. 24, 2011, according to the state-run IRNA news agency, Iran announced it had broken up an American spy \nnetwork and that 12 individuals had been arrested. Iranian officials claimed that the 12 individuals were \"spies\" \nworking on behalf of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to undermine the country's military and its \nnuclear program. No information was available about the identity or nationality of the dozen so-called agents. Parviz \nSorouri, an influential member of the  National Security and Foreign Policy Committee in the Iranian parliament, \nwas reported to have said that the agents were working cooperatively with Israel's Mossad.  He was quoted in \ninternational media having said, \"The US and Zionist regime's espionage apparatuses were trying to use regional \nintelligence services, both inside and outside Iran, in order to deal a strong blow to our country. Fortunately, these \nsteps failed due to the quick measures taken by Intelligence Ministry officials.\" Iranian officials have further alleged \nthat the United States has recruited spies from diplomatic missions in Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and \nMalaysia.\n\nSpecial Report:  Iran's Nuclear Enrichment Program\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn January 2010, attention was upon possible sanctions being placed on Iran in response to its intransigence over \nits controversial nuclear development program and its possible violations of international law in this regard.  There \nwas a prevailing sanctions proposa being advanced by the United States, given the fact that the Middle Eastern \ncountry missed the Dec. 31, 2009, deadline to accept a compromise deal to transfer its low enriched uranium \noutside its terrain for processing into fuel rods with a purity of 20 percent.  Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr \nMottaki demanded that nuclear fuel be sold to Iran or swap nuclear fuel for Iran's low-enriched uranium.  He issued \na one-month deadline of his own as well as an ultimatum as follows: \"Otherwise, Tehran will enrich uranium to a \nhigher purity needed for the fuel. This is an ultimatum.\"  Also at issue has been  the fact that Iran has not opened \nits clandestine uranium enrichment plant near Qom for international inspection.\n\n\n\nIran's Latest Moves --\n\nIn February 2010, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called on his country's nuclear head, Dr. Ali Akbar \nSalehi, to intensify  uranium enrichment, in defiance of the international community.  The move was essentially a \nfulfillment of an earlier threat by Iran to enrich uranium at a higher purity level of 20 percent. At issue has been \nIran's claim that it is entitled to carry out a civilian nuclear program, aimed at generating energy.  This claim has \nbeen disputed by several countries of the West, and Iran's case has been compromised by revelations of \nclandestine nuclear development facilities including the discovery of a secret nuclear facility at Qom.\n\nThis move by Iran to intensify its uranium enrichment came after Iran rejected a compromise deal to transfer its low \nenriched uranium outside its terrain for processing into fuel rods and, instead, imposed an ultimatum of its own. \nSpecifically, Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki warned that his country would enrich uranium at the \nhigher purity level (20 percent) if the West did not meet its counter-demand that nuclear fuel be sold to Iran or \nnuclear fuel be swapped for Iran's low-enriched uranium.  Of significance has been the fact that civilian nuclear \npower requires uranium enriched to about only three percent, whereas weapons grade uranium has to be enriched \nto 90 percent.  Intensification beyond the three percent range has, therefore,  signaled alarm bells across the globe.\n\nClearly, the situation marked a further deterioration of relations between Iran and the West, and prompted the \nBritish Foreign Office to issue a statement asserting:  \"This would be a deliberate breach of five UNSCRs [United \nNations Security Council Resolutions].\"  As well, the United States called for united global action in the face of a \npossible Iranian nuclear threat.  With sanctions in the offing, United States Defense Secretary Robert Gates said \nthat while there was time for the proposed sanctions to work, the world would have to \"stand together.\"  During a \nvisit to Italy, Gates said, \"Pressures that are focused on the government of Iran, as opposed to the people of Iran, \npotentially have greater opportunity to achieve the objective.\"\n\nBy February 11, 2010, Iranian President Ahmadinejad announced in the capital city of Tehran that his country had \nnow enriched its first batch of uranium to 20 percent.  The declaration came during a celebration marking the 31st \nanniversary of the Islamic Revolution. President Ahmadinejad said that the \"first consignment of the 20 percent \nenriched uranium has been produced and handed over to the scientists.\"  He continued, \"God willing, the work will \ncontinue until completely supplying the country's needs.\"  The Iranian president appeared to issue a veiled warning \nto the international community by noting that while his country was capable of enriching uranium up to 80 percent -- \nthe intensity level of weapons grade enrichment -- it would not move in that direction.  Left unstated was the \npossible corollary:  Iran would not yet move in that direction.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the New York Times, Iranian officials claimed that the 20 percent uranium enrichment \nprocess occurred at the Natanz facility and in the presence of inspectors from the United Nations nuclear watchdog \nagency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  However, the IAEA would not confirm these claims by \nIran.  Indeed, a memorandum dispatched by IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano to member nation states noted \nthat  when the inspectors arrived at the Natanz facility, they were informed that Iran had already commenced the \nprocedure of feeding low-enriched uranium into centrifuges for enrichment.\n\nBackground on Sanctions --\n\nAs noted above, the attention of the world's leading powers has been upon possible sanctions against Iran since \nthe start of 2010.  Sanctions would be imposed in response to its intransigence over its controversial nuclear \ndevelopment program and its possible violations of international law in this regard.  There was a prevailing \nsanctions proposal, given the fact that the Middle Eastern country missed the Dec. 31, 2009, deadline to accept the \naforementioned compromise deal to transfer its low enriched uranium outside its terrain for processing into fuel \nrods.  Also at issue has been  the fact that Iran has not opened its secret uranium enrichment plant near Qom for \ninternational inspection.\n\nAccordingly, five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany met for several hours \non Jan. 16, 2010, to discuss the matter.  The meeting, however, ended without a clear agreement.\n\n\n\nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov explained that  the meeting was \"inconclusive in a sense that we \ndidn't make any decisions right away,\" but he notably added that most of the discussions were focused on the \n\"second track\" - a reference to the path of sanctions.  Those sanctions were expected to be levied against the \nIranian government, as well as the Revolutionary Guard Corps, which has seen increased influence within Iran in \nrecent times. Robert Cooper, a senior European Union official who led the meeting, said:  \"We will continue to seek \na negotiated solution but consideration of appropriate further measures has also begun.\"\n\nIt should be noted that the new target of proposed sanctions -- Iran's Revolutionary Guard -- has emerged because \nof its growing significance as a power center within the country.  Analysts have drawn  attention to the accelerating \ntransfer of power to the Revolutionary Guard Corps, which was originally established in 1979 to protect the ideals of \nthe Islamic revolution.  The political power and influence of the Revolutionary Guard was on full display in the anti-\ngovernment protests that have occurred in Iran following its 2009 contested presidential election, making clear that \nthey have become more closely intertwined with the base of clerical power surrounding Iran's Supreme Leader \nAyatollah Ali Khameini.  Moreover, the Revolutionary Guard was believed to be the leading entity behind Iran's  \nnuclear ambitions.\n\nIn addition to its political power and influence has been the fact that the Revolutionary Guard has also become a \npowerful economic force in Iran.  It controls construction and even companies, earning  billions in public contracts \nover a two-year span, as reported by the Washington Post.  In that report, the Washington Post quoted Mashallah \nShamsolvaezin of the Center for Scientific Research and Middle East Strategic Studies in Tehran, who said:  \"They \n[the Revolutionary Guard Corps] have become the main, most faithful caste, to protect the system of Islamic \ngovernment. In exchange, wealth, power and respect are being transferred to them at an increasing rate.\"\n\nUnited States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has reportedly been discussing a sanctions proposal with allied \nnations aimed at placing pressure on the Iranian regime and the Revolutionary Guard. Indeed, Secretary Clinton \nemphasized the inclusion of the Revolutionary Guard in this proposal saying, \"We have already begun discussions \nwith our partners and with like-minded nations about pressure and sanctions.  Our goal is to pressure the Iranian \ngovernment, particularly the Revolutionary Guard elements, without contributing to the suffering of the ordinary \npeople, who deserve better than what they currently are receiving.\"\n\nBut certain voices have argued that such sanctions will do little to stem the tide of power emanating from this \nenclave.  Indeed, Iranian parliamentarian Kazem Jalali said, \"U.S. sanctions will have no negative effect since the \nGuard organization is self-sufficient.\"\n\nLatest Developments --\n\nOn Feb. 10, 2010, the United States Treasury Department levied specific sanctions against the Iranian \nRevolutionary Guard by  freezing the assets of one individual -- General Rostam Qasemi -- as well as four \ncompanies affiliated with the Corps. Qasemi was the head of the engineering arm of the Iranian Revolutionary \nGuard, known as Khatam al-Anbiya Construction.  As noted by Stuart Levey, the  United States Treasury's Under-\nSecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, the Revolutionary Guard \"is hiding behind companies like \nKhatam al-Anbiya and its affiliates to maintain vital ties to the outside world.\"  Clearly, this move by the United \nStates Treasury was just one indication of the types of actions that might be levied against Iran in the near future.\n\nIndeed, United States President  Barack Obama noted that his administration would develop \"a significant regime of \nsanctions\" over the next several weeks (February 2010) targeting Iran. Striking a much different tone from his \nearlier conciliatory intonation in regard to Iran, President Obama expressed confidence that the international \ncommunity would coalesce efforts against that country.  He said, \"The international community is unified around \nIran's misbehavior,\" and suggested that global powers would work together to apply pressure on Iran.\n\n\n\nIn particular, President Obama acknowledged the new stance being taken by Russia, which has previously been \nreticent about applying sanctions to Iran.  Indeed, the United States president said he was pleased to see \"how \nforward-leaning the Russians have been on this issue.\"\n\nBolstering this position was a statement by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov  in the aftermath of \nIran's announcement that it was enriching uranium at higher levels.  Ryabkov explained in an interview with Interfax \nthat sanctions against Iran were now more likely saying, \"In this new situation, the question of sanctions, of drafting \na resolution for new sanctions has become more relevant.\" Russia seemed to yet maintain its hope for dialogue  \nand diplomacy with Ryabkov remarking, \"However the situation may develop, a platform must remain for talks and \nways must be sought to mitigate international concerns about Iran's nuclear program by involving Iran in diplomatic \nefforts.\"\n\nRegardless of Russia's evolving position in regard to tough sanctions against Iran, China -- which wields veto power \nat the United Nations Security Council -- maintained its negative resolve against such action.\n\nFor its part, Iran has been telegraphing contradictory signals in what could only be described as mixed messages.  \nEven as Iran rejected the compromise deal discussed above, followed by Iranian President Ahmadinejad's \nannouncement of uranium enrichment at higher intensity levels, Iran was still signaling its interest in engagement \nwith the West.  Indeed,  Ali-Akbar Salehi, the director of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, said his country was \nstill open to discussions around the possibility of sending Iranian uranium abroad for enrichment.  Specifically, Iran's \nnuclear energy chief said in an interview with Iranian state television that Tehran was open to exchanging its 3.5 \npercent enriched uranium for 20 percent enriched nuclear fuel.  Salehi said, \"If they [re: the global powers] come \nforward and supply the fuel, then we will stop the 20 percent enrichment.\" He explained that the Tehran Research \nReactor required 20 percent enriched uranium to produce medical radioisotopes, necessitating the imperative that \nthe nuclear reactor not exhaust its supply of fuel.  Salehi continued, \"All we have asked the West or countries that \nhave the capacity to produce the fuel is 'Please supply us with the fuel.' So the deal is still on the table.\"\n\nWhether or not the global powers were actually interested in entertaining this complicated positioning by Iran was \nyet to be seen.  Certainly the United States was not wasting any time in trying to shore up support for its plans for \nIran.  To those ends, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton traveled to the Middle East to seek support \nfrom Arab countries for harsher sanctions against Iran.  The keystone of the United States' diplomatic offensive was \na speech by Secretary Clinton at the United States-Islamic World Forum, which was being hosted by the \nWashington-based Brookings Institute and the government of Qatar.  The speech was billed as a sequel to \nPresident Barack Obama's historic address in Cairo, in which he called for the cessation of \"the cycle of mistrust \nand discord\" between the United States and the Muslim world.  At the forum in Qatar, Secretary Clinton urged Iran \nto reconsider its nuclear program and what she described as  \"dangerous policy decisions.\"\n\nAlso central to Secretary Clinton's diplomatic offensive was dialogue with Saudi Arabia.  At issue was Saudi \nArabia's flourishing trading relationship with China, and the concomitant belief that Riyadh could entice Beijing into \nabandoning its opposition to the plan for harsh sanctions against Iran.\n\nAssistant Secretary of State Jeffrey Feldman explained this maneuver as follows: \"We would expect [the Saudis] to \nuse their relationships [with China] in ways that can help increase the pressure that Iran would feel.\"  Perhaps \npartially driving China's continued reticence against sanctions has been  a possible loss of revenue from \ninvestments in Iran and a disruption in oil supplies from that country.  Accordingly, Saudi Arabia could play a vital \nrole in reassuring China that it could neutralize any disruptions emanating from Iran.\n\nIn the third week of February 2010, the United Nations watchdog agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency \n(IAEA), expressed concern that Iran was trying to develop nuclear payload for a missile.  The report conveyed \nstrong doubts about Iran's adherence to international transparency obligations as follows:  \"Altogether this raises \nconcerns about the possible existence in Iran of past or current undisclosed activities related to the development of \na nuclear payload for a missile.\" The report also noted that Iran's resistance in cooperating with IAEA investigators \ncompounded global anxieties \"about possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program.\"  The information, \n\n\n\nwhich was revealed via a leaked confidential report by the IAEA, also contained confirmation that Iran had begun \nenriching uranium at higher levels.\n\nThese new revelations collectively provided support for the United States' claim that Iran has not met its \ninternational responsibilities and they could, potentially, bolster the argument in favor of sanctions.  To this end, the \nUnited States recapitulated its warning that Iran faced consequences if it continued along its current path. White \nHouse Press Secretary Robert Gibbs noted, \"We always said that if Iran failed to live up to those international \nobligations, that there would be consequences.\" Russia said that it was \"very alarmed\" at the findings contained in \nthe IAEA report. During a radio interview, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said: \"We are very alarmed and \nwe cannot accept this, that Iran is refusing to co-operate with the IAEA.\" The United Kingdom and  Germany both \nsaid the report augmented  great concerns about Iran's  nuclear activities.  The United Kingdom's Foreign Office \nissued a statement that read: \"This most recent report notes that as well as ignoring the requests for information \nabout possible military dimension of their program, Iran built a secret enrichment plant in Qom, and Iran enriched \nuranium up to 20 percent despite the [IAEA] telling them not to do so.\" Germany warned that Iran's failure to \ncomply with IAEA rules on its nuclear program was compelling the international community to pursue the path of \nfurther sanctions.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, Iran expressed a very different view.  Indeed, Iran's envoy to the IAEA, Ali Asghar \nSoltanieh, told the IRNA news agency that the  report \"verified the peaceful, non-military nature of Iran's nuclear \nactivities.\"  As well, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, strongly denied his country was developing \nnuclear weapons, saying that any fears that  Iran was trying to develop nuclear weapons were \"baseless.\"  \nAccording to Iranian media, Khamenei said, \"The West's accusations are baseless because our religious beliefs bar \nus from using such weapons. We do not believe in atomic weapons and are not seeking that.\"\n\nAnother area of concern articulated in the IAEA report was the finding that Iran has transported its stockpile of \nenriched uranium from below ground to an above ground site.  There was some speculation that the move could be \nmotivated by Iran's desire to provoke a military strike (possibly by Israel) -- a move that could have political benefits \nat home to the Iranian regime.  Regardless of Iran's motivation behind this decision to move its stockpile of enriched \nuranium, Israel was certain to be considering its options as regards a nuclearized Iran.\n\nIranian Nuclear Summit\n\nIn mid-April 2010, Iran convened a nuclear disarmament conference in the capital city of Tehran.  There, Iran's \nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei charged that \"Only the U.S. government has committed an atomic crime.\"  \nHe continued, \"The world's only atomic criminal lies and presents itself as being against nuclear weapons \nproliferation, while it has not taken any serious measures in this regard.\" This assertion from the Iranian leadership \nappeared to have been driven, at least in part, by the newly-reviewed United States nuclear posture, and came \nafter the United States and Russia forged an agreement to decrease their respective nuclear arsenals.\n\nIn an apparent bid to show that his country did not intend on using nuclear weapons -- its acquisition \nnotwithstanding -- Khamenei also said that the use of nuclear weapons was prohibited by religion. Emphasizing his \nmoral objection to the use of nuclear weaponry, Khamenei characterized the potential deployment of a nuclear \nweapon as \"haram\"  -- a prohibition under Islam.\n\nAt the conference, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called for an independent body to oversee nuclear \ndisarmament.  Presumably, Ahmadinejad did not view the existence of the nuclear watchdog agency, the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), as such an institution, despite its expressed purpose.  However, he did \ncall for United States and other countries in possession of nuclear weapons to be suspended from the IAEA.  Iran \nalso demanded that Israel, which is believed to possess an undeclared nuclear weapons program, to join the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, as a means of assuring a nuclear weapons-free Middle East.\n\nFor its part, Israel made it clear that it viewed Iran as the main security threat, not just to the region, but to the \nwhole globe.  Speaking at a war memorial ceremony, Israeli  President Shimon Peres declared that Iran was a \nthreat to the entire civilized world.\n\n\n\nFurther Nuclear Moves\n\nOn April 19, 2010,  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  approved  the construction of a new nuclear \nenrichment plant.\n\nA senior adviser to the president, Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi, said: \"The construction process of the new site will \nbegin upon the president's order.\"  The announcement came two months after Iran said that it commenced \nenrichment of  low-level uranium for a research reactor in Tehran.  At that time, Iran said that it intended to begin \nconstruction on at least two new enrichment facilities.  Hashemi also said that while Iran remained open to \nnegotiations on the concept of  a nuclear fuel swap ( a reference to a proposed plan to send most of its uranium \nabroad for processing and conversion into fuel rods for use in the research reactor), it would  not stop producing its \nown fuel in the interim. Accordingly, many Western countries have observed that Iran's actions are consistent with \nthat of a country determined to produce nuclear weapons, it claims to the contrary, and its declarations of the \nimmorality of the use of atomic weaponry notwithstanding.\n\nIn May 2010, as Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan traveled to Tehran for negotiations on Iran's \ncontroversial nuclear program in that country, there were suggestions from Ankara that a compromise deal was at \nhand.  The Turkish leader, along with Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, were playing key roles in trying to \npersuade Iran's government to agree to a deal that would transport its nuclear material abroad for processing. \nThere were hopes that the two countries, which have enjoyed relatively friendlier diplomatic terms with Iran than the \nWestern powers and Russia, might be positioned to successfully make the case for compromise.\n\nThis plan has seen several iterations over recent times, including provisions for the transfer of stockpiles of low \nenriched uranium to Russia and France for processing. It should be noted that until this time, the proposal has \nnever garnered Iranian concurrence. In this new arrangement, the low enriched uranium would be transferred to \nTurkey.  With Iran already trying to avert the prospect of new sanctions being imposed by the United Nations, it was \npossible that there would be greater receptivity to the resurrected compromise deal, albeit with a more neutral \ncountry as the partner state.  There were hoped that such a proposition would  allay the West's fears that Iran's \nnuclear ambitions include nuclear weapons proliferation.  These anxieties  have only been strengthened by \nrevelations about secret nuclear facilities in Iran, and non-compliance with monitoring regulations set forth by the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.\n\nHowever, the United States dismissed the deal brokered by Turkey, and drafted its own proposal to levy new \nsactions against Iran. That United States-drafted proposal was tabled at the United Nations Security Council, \nprompting Turkey to call for a delay in the interests of further negotiations.\n\nSuch a delay was unlikely, as United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that the strong draft proposal \nagainst Iran was already backed  by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. For his \npart, United States President Barack Obama made it clear that his country intended to pursue the new sanctions \nagainst Iran, irrespective of the new nuclear deal with Turkey and Brazil.  President Obama reportedly informed \nTurkish Prime Minister during a phone call that the new agreement  failed to build \"necessary confidence\" that Iran \nwould abide by its international obligations.  Further, the United States leader acknowledged Turkey's and Brazil;s \nefforts, but noted that the new deal left open a host of \"fundamental concerns\" about Iran's atomic ambitions and \nbroader nuclear program.\n\n.\n\nFrom Tehran,  the head of Iran's atomic energy organisation, Ali Akbar Salehi, dismissed the prospect of looming \nsanctions and predicted that such a move by the international community would ultimately backfire.  Salehi said, \n\"They won't prevail and by pursuing the passing of a new resolution they are discrediting themselves in public \nopinion.\"  Nevertheless, the draft resolution on sanctions against Iran was reported to be already circulating in the \nchambers of the United Nations Security Council.\n\n\n\nUnited Nations imposes new sanctions on Iran\n\nOn June 9, 2010, the United Nations Security Council voted in favor of fresh sanctions to be imposed on Iran over \nits failure to end its controversial nuclear program.  The vote in the United Nations Security Council was 12 in favor \nof the new round of sanctions, two against the sanctions, and one abstention.\n\nThe detailed vote count was as follows:\n\n\"Yes\" votes from permanent (i.e. with power of veto) United Nations Security Council members --\n\nUnited States, United Kingdom, France, Russia, China\n\n\"Yes\" votes from non-permanent (i.e. without power of veto) United Nations Security Council members --\n\nJapan, Austria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mexico, Nigeria, Gabon, Uganda\n\n\"No\" votes from non-permanent (i.e. without power of veto) United Nations Security Council members --\n\nTurkey, Brazil\n\n\"Abstention\" (from non-permanent member without power of veto --\n\nLebanon\n\nThe sanctions would constitute the fourth round of such punitive actions against Iran, and was regarded as the \nharshest set of measures to date. The main provisions included an arms embargo, which would prohibit Iran from \npurchasing heavy weapons, such as attack helicopters and missiles;  stringent rules regarding financial transactions \nwith Iranian banks;  and a wider swath of Iranian individuals and companies to be subject to travel bans and asset \nfreezes. In addition, a new system of cargo inspections would be established to detect and stop Iran from acquiring \nbanned materials.\n\nThe new sanctions regime was based on a draft prepared by the United States, which was tabled at the United \nNations Security Council weeks prior. At the time, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that the \nstrong draft proposal against Iran was already backed by the five permanent members of the United Nations \nSecurity Council. For his part, United States President Barack Obama made it clear that his country intended to \npursue fresh sanctions against Iran, as a consequence of the prevailing \"fundamental concerns\" about Iran's atomic \nambitions and broader nuclear program. Now, with the imposition of the new sanctions regime, President Obama \nheralded the measure as an unmistakable message to halting the spread of nuclear arms. The United States \nposition was mirrored by the United Kingdom with Foreign Secretary William Hague saying that the vote in favor of \nfresh sanctions delivered a \"strong statement of international resolve,\" and would increase the pressure on Iran.\n\nDespite Iran's insistence that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, its failure to comply with the standards \nimposed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the revelations about clandestine nuclear sites, \nhave fueled anxieties by the international community that Iran does, in fact, intend to manufacture a nuclear bomb.  \nIndeed, China took a rare stand against Iran, emphasizing the imperative to deal with the threat of nuclear \nproliferation.  China's ambassador to the United Nations, Zhang Yesui, characterized the sanctions regime as an \nattempt to prevent nuclear proliferation in Iran.  The Chinese diplomat also noted that the new sanctions were \ntargeted and would not hurt \"the normal life of the Iranian people.\"\n\nMeanwhile, backers of the new sanctions regime were denied a unanimous vote in its favor due to the \"no\" votes \nfrom Turkey and Brazil, who managed to cobble together a compromise deal with Iran weeks earlier on the \ntransportation of low enriched uranium outside of Iran for processing.  That deal was regarded by the United States \nas not sufficiently strong to curb Iran's nuclear goals.  Indeed, as reportedly detailed in letters dispatched to the \nIAEA by Russia and France, the deal brokered by Turkey and Brazil would only cover 1,200 kilograms of low \nenriched uranium and would leave Iran with enormous stocks in their possession. For their parts, Turkey and Brazil \ntook a different view, pointing to the concessions made by Iran in their own (now abandoned) compromise deal. \nTurkey and Brazil concluded that further sanctions against Iran would be counter-productive, hence their \"no\" votes.\n\n\n\nCritics have argued that as strong as the new sanctions regime may be in comparison to measures of the past, it \nnonetheless falls short of the heavy pressure favored by hardliners. For example, there was no call for an oil \nembargo, and there were no crippling economic actions that could deleteriously affect Iran's vital interests. That \nbeing said, an even stronger sanctions regime was not likely to gain support from veto-wielding members of the \nUnited Nations Security Council, such as Russia and China. Moreover, while average Iranians were not likely to \nexperience the effects of the new sanctions, the powerful Iranian Revolutionary Guard would not be so lucky.  \nIndeed, this was one of the expressed objectives set forth by the United States when it first began to consider the \nfourth round of sanctions against Iran.\n\nThe aim of a new sanctions regime was to specifically target the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, which has emerged \nas a power center within that country.  Analysts have drawn attention to the accelerating transfer of power to the \nRevolutionary Guard Corps, which was originally established in 1979 to protect the ideals of the Islamic revolution.  \nThe political power and influence of the Revolutionary Guard was on full display in the deadly anti-government \nprotests that occurred in Iran following its 2009 contested presidential election, making clear that they have become \nmore closely intertwined with the base of clerical power surrounding Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini.  \nMoreover, the Revolutionary Guard was believed to be the leading entity behind Iran's nuclear ambitions.\n\nIn addition to its political power and influence has been the fact that the Revolutionary Guard has also become a \npowerful economic force in Iran.  It controls construction and even companies, earning billions in public contracts \nover a two-year span, as reported by the Washington Post.  In that report, the Washington Post quoted Mashallah \nShamsolvaezin of the Center for Scientific Research and Middle East Strategic Studies in Tehran, who said:  \"They \n[the Revolutionary Guard Corps] have become the main, most faithful caste, to protect the system of Islamic \ngovernment. In exchange, wealth, power and respect are being transferred to them at an increasing rate.\"  Thus, \nthe intrinsic value of targeting the new sanctions in such a way as to strike at the core of the Revolutionary Guard \nCorps.\n\nFrom Tehran, the head of Iran's atomic energy organization, Ali Akbar Salehi, dismissed the prospect of looming \nsanctions and predicted that such a move by the international community would ultimately backfire. Salehi said, \n\"They won't prevail and by pursuing the passing of a new resolution they are discrediting themselves in public \nopinion.\" Now, with the sanctions a reality and not a theoretical measure, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad \nadopted a dismissive tone. In an interview broadcast on Iran's ISNA news agency, he said: \"I gave one of the [world \npowers] a message that the resolutions you issue are like a used handkerchief, which should be thrown in the \ndustbin. They are not capable of hurting Iranians.\"  Clearly, Iran was trying to deliver the message that it would not \nbe intimidated by the international community's punitive actions.\n\nThat being said, in mid-June 2010, both the United States and the European Union announced their own unilateral \nsanctions to be imposed on Iran.  In the case of the United States, the new sanctions by the Treasury Department \ntargeted Iran's nuclear and missile programs, by concentrating on the financial sector, the shipping industry and \nIslamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.  The new sanctions imposed by the European Union included a ban on \ninvestments and technology transfers to Iran's key oil and gas industry.  Russia responded by criticizing these \nseparate sanctions efforts, despite its support for the new round of sanctions imposed by the United Nations, as \ndiscussed above.  In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Russian President Medvedev said, \"We didn't agree \nto this when we discussed the joint resolution at the United Nations.\"\n\nIran prevents IAEA inspectors from entering the country\n\nOn June 21, 2010, Iran informed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that two of its inspectors would \nnot be allowed to enter the country.\n\nAli Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, explained that the action had been taken because \nthe IAEA  had published a report his country deemed to be  \"untruthful\" in regards to Iran's nuclear activities.  \nSalehi said, \"If an inspector makes a report contrary to the standing fact... we have the right to place a protest as \nwe did in regard to the report by two inspectors.\"  Salehi did not specify exactly what portion of the IAEA report was \n\n\n\nregarded as inaccurate by Iran.  That being said, general consensus that the issue at the core of the controversy \nprobably involved Iran's claim at the start of the year that its scientists had carried out pyroprocessing experiments -\n- a process which potentially used to purify uranium for use in nuclear weapons.  The IAEA responded to the claim \nby requesting further information from Iran, but by March 2010, Iran was reversing its initial claims and saying that it \nnever conducted such activities.  That scenario, clearly, left the IAEA somewhat suspicious of Iran's actual nuclear \nactivities.  That suspicion was further stoked when in May 2010, IAEA inspectors visited the site of the claimed \npyroprocessing experiments and found that an electrochemical cell had been \"removed,\" as disclosed in the IAEA \nreport.\n\nIran's provocative moves:\n\nOn Aug. 22, 2010, Iran unveiled its newest addition to its military -- an unmanned bomber jet. While the Karrar \ndrone was not expected to have a significant impact on the strategic balance of the Middle East, Iran's decision to \nprocure the craft appeared to signify that country's desire to expand its conventional weapons capabilities. Not one \nto miss an opportunity to threaten geopolitical antagonists, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was \naddressing the country's annual Defense Industry Day ceremonies, described the Karrar drone as a \"messenger of \ndeath for the enemies of humanity.\"\n\nOnly days later, Iran remained in the international spotlight when it announced that it had successfully test-fired an \nupgraded version of a short-range surface-to-surface missile. The new version of the Fateh-110 missile, which \ntranslates into \"conqueror\" in Farsi, has been equipped with a guidance control system known for its accuracy. As \nwell, its range has been increased as compared with earlier versions. According to Iranian Defense Minister Ahmad \nVahidi, the solid-fuel Fateh-110 missile was developed domestically by Iran's Aerospace Industries Organization \nand held the potential of striking targets up to 120 miles away. On Iranian state television, Vahidi said, \"Employing a \nhighly accurate guidance and control system has enabled the missile to hit its targets with great precision.\" The \nupgraded missile was to be transferred to the possession of the Iranian military by September 2010.\n\nWhile a short-range surface-to-surface missile was not evidence of a nuclear threat, it nonetheless recalled a report \nissued a year earlier by experts at the United Nations nuclear monitoring agency, the International Atomic Energy \nAgency (IAEA), which indicated their belief that Iran could have the ability to manufacture a nuclear bomb. In that \nreport titled, \"Possible Military Dimension of Iran's Nuclear Program,\" experts intimated that Iran could well be trying \nto develop a missile system capable of carrying an atomic warhead.  That document concluded that while Iran was \nnot yet capable of attaching nuclear warheads to its Shahab-3 medium-range missile, further research and \ndevelopment could lead to the production of a prototype system. To that end, the Shahab-3 missile -- with a range \nof up to 1,250 miles (2,000 kilometers) -- would place Israel within striking distance. Clearly, the upgraded Fateh-\n110 would not have comparable range; however, it was clear that Iran was intent on publicizing its growing military \nweapons capacity to the outside world. This was the case in September 2009 when Iran test-fired two short-range \nmissiles -- the Tondar-69 and the earlier incarnation of the Fateh-110 -- followed by the long-range Shahab-3 \nballistic missile and the surface-to-surface Sajjil.  Once again, these unambiguous acts of defiance by Iran in 2010 \nwere sure to raise the ire of the West.\n\nMeanwhile, around the same period (August 2010), Iran announced it would commence building a new uranium \nenrichment plant in early 2011. The new facility would be only one of 10 new uranium enrichment facilities planned \nfor construction in Iran. Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran's nuclear program, said in an interview with Iranian state \ntelevision that \"studies on finding locations for the construction of 10 new sites are going through their final stages.\" \nHe also confirmed that construction would commence on one of these sites \"by the end of the current Iranian year \n(in March 2011), or shortly afterwards.\"\n\nThese moves have been part of Iran's insistence on pursuing a nuclear program in defiance of Western powers, \nwho have accused Iran of having a nuclear weapons proliferation agenda. While Iran has denied these ambitions \nand insisted on a program for peaceful purposes, it has nonetheless violated international regulations by \nconstructing a clandestine enrichment plant at Qom. The construction of the secret enrichment plan in Qom -- \nrevealed in 2009 -- was in violation of the safeguard provisions set forth in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons (NPT), and effectively fueled global anxieties about Iran's true intent. In response, the United \n\n\n\nNations, as well as the United States and European Union, have imposed sanctions against Iran in an effort to \nsuppress that country's nuclear ambitions.\n\nOn Aug. 20, 2010, Iran launched its first nuclear reactor at the Bushehr nuclear power station in the southern part of \nthe country. The plant, which took 35 years to construct due to a series of delays, was to be operated by Russia. \nIndeed, Russia was to be responsible for supplying nuclear fuel and removing the nuclear waste. Due to Russian \ninvolvement in the project, the opening ceremony of the Bushehr nuclear power station was witnessed by Iranian \nand Russian officials.\n\nThe Iranian government hailed the development as a victory over its enemies. However, because the power plan \nhas taken more than three decades to construct, it was an older model with limited contribution to the national grid. \nAs a result, despite the celebration surrounding the opening of the plant, which would begin producing electricity in \nfour weeks from the launch date, the significance of the Bushehr power station was regarded as more symbolic \nthan substantive. Moreover, the real issue within the international community has not been a matter of nuclear \nenergy production, but fears that Iran seeks to build a nuclear weapon. Accordingly, Iran has been the target of four \nrounds of United Nations sanctions due to its uranium enrichment program, which was quite separate from this \nnuclear reactor project. That is to say, whereas the Bushehr nuclear power plant used uranium enriched by 3.5 \npercent, weapons-grade uranium must be enriched by more than 90 percent. Throughout, it has been Iran's \nuranium enrichment activities at levels higher than three percent that have sparked alarm bells across the West.\n\nNevertheless, as before, Iran appeared intent on defying the international community with the head of Iran's Atomic \nEnergy Organization, Ali Akbar Salehi, saying that his country would continue uranium enrichment. To that end, a \nserious concern for the international community has been a pilot program to enrich uranium to 20 percent, which \nIran contends is necessary for a medical research reactor. Clearly, this higher level of uranium enrichment has \nbeen a concern for Western powers more than Bushehr nuclear power station, sparking fears in Israel, which has a \nparticularly hostile relationship with Iran and has suggested the notion of targeted military strikes against Iranian \nnuclear facilities.\n\nIsrael's options in dealing with Iran's nuclear program --\n\nWith  Iran's nuclear moves dominating the geopolitical landscape, there was increasing speculation about Israel's \nown alternative options.  Indeed, the one country in the Middle East most likely to feel threatened by a nuclearized \nIran was Israel, given the clear antipathy expressed by the Iranian regime against the Jewish state of Israel.  \nSpeculation has abounded that Israel has been contemplating military strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, not \nunlike the 1981 air strike Israel reportedly carried out against Saddam Hussein's nuclear reactor in Osiraq. That \nscenario has frequently been touted as a model of preventative military strikes to be used against looming nuclear \nthreats.\n\nBut the landscape in 2010 was quite different from the situation almost three decades ago. Notably, in 1981, even \nthough Iraq and Iran were embroiled in a war, Israeli F-16 jet fighters encountered little resistance as they carried \nout their mission. While there was limited anti-aircraft fire, there were no air patrols of surface-to-air missiles to \ncontend with. Clearly, three decades later, Israel was not likely to have such an easy field of action in Iran.\n\nThen there has been the matter of whether Israel can achieve the same objective in 2010 as it did in 1981. Almost \nthree decades ago, Israel was able to land such a blow on Iraq's nuclear facility that Saddam Hussein's regime was \nnever able to build nuclear weapons. As of 2010, there was no such confidence that Iran's nuclear breakout \ncapabilities would be curtailed in similar strikes. Of significant consideration has been the fact that Iran's multiple \nnuclear sites are dispersed with some in remote areas and others underground. The revelation about the \nclandestine Qom facility only bolsters the belief that there may be other such nuclear facilities across Iran. Indeed, \nIsraeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak acknowledged during a parliamentary meeting that facilities such as the Qom \nsite \"cannot be destroyed through a conventional attack.\" Accordingly, there is no guarantee that air strikes could \ndo more than setback Iran's nuclear ambitions a year or two.\n\nNevertheless, there were clear signs that the military option remained on the table, given the Netanyahu \ngovernment's decisions to increase the defense budget, distribute gas masks to all citizens, and simulate a \n\n\n\nbiological attack. But there were also signals of Israel's awareness that the military options may not yield optimal \nresults. Accordingly, Israel has shown support for the notion of sanctions against Iran, although its call for crippling \nsanctions may not coincide with the new impetus by the international community for targeting the Iranian \nRevolutionary Guard Corps in its sanctions. The international community, including the Obama administration in the \nUnited States, has not been keen to punish the Iranian people for the regime's ills, and has had to balance reticent \npowers, such as Russia and China, to even entertain the notion of sanctions. Thusly, targeted sanctions against the \nRevolutionary Guard and clerical elite have gained support. But Israel believes that only crippling, broad-based \nsanctions will have a sufficiently strong effect to stoke internal fissures, and possibly spur the collapse of the clerical \nregime.\n\nBy August 2010, around the same period that Iran launched a nuclear reactor at Bushehr and announced its plans \nto start building new uranium enrichment plant in 2011, the government of the United States reportedly tried to \nassuage Israel on the nuclear threat posed by Iran. According to a report by the New York Times, the Obama \nadministration conveyed evidence to Israeli counterparts showing that problems within Iran's nuclear program \nmeant that it would take at least a year for that country to actually build a nuclear weapon. That timeline, it was \nbelieved, would decrease the possibility that Israel would soon carry out a pre-emptive strike against Iran's nuclear \nfacilities.\n\n\"Soon,\" though, has been a relative consideration. According to Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic Monthly, Israel was \nbiding its time to see if the non-military options could yield positive results; however, it was nevertheless prepared to \ncarry out unilateral strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. To that end, Goldberg contended that, at this time, it was \nIsrael's belief that strikes against Iran's nuclear sites could halt progress on that country's nuclear development \nprogram for several years. That is to say, Israel now held the view that it could strike a blow at the nuclear breakout \ncapability of Iran.\n\nIt should be noted that several strikes -- in the plural --would be needed to achieve such an end; among the likely \ntargets would be the uranium-enrichment facility at Natanz, the formerly clandestine enrichment site at Qom, the \nnuclear-research center at Esfahan, and the Bushehr reactor.  Undoubtedly, flying multiple jet fighters through \nforeign air space would present Israel with a constituently complicated proposition.\n\nThe logistics of such a military operation by Israel notwithstanding, the cost of such an offensive endeavor might be \ndetermined to be too high. Certainly, the likely effects were forecast to be manifold ranging as they do from \ngeopolitical chaos to economic turbulence due to a potentially drastic spike in the price of oil.  Iran and its allies \ncould well retaliate by firing rockets at Israeli cities, which could effectively ignite a regional war.  As well, extremist \nterrorist enclaves in the region, such as Hezbollah and Hamas, would have an accentuated rallying cry. The result \nmight be an even more imperiled Israel.\n\nYet the question of peril has been at the top of Israel's agenda, given the belief that Iran may gain the technological \nknowledge to construct nuclear bombs within a relatively short period of time. It may be Israel's calculation that \npotentially deleterious consequences are worth the effort, given the existential stakes for the Jewish nation state.  \nThose existential stakes were brought into high relief as a result of the vituperative threats uttered by Iran's leaders \nthat Israel should be \"wiped off the map.\"\n\nWorth noting is the fact that a nuclearized Iran poses a threat not only to Israel but to other countries in the Middle \nEast. Indeed, a nuclear-armed Iran would, itself, have a destabilizing effect across the Middle East, most obviously \nby potentially triggering a nuclear arms race in the region among other countries not willing to cede power to \nnuclearized Iran. But quite in contrast to the arms race of the Cold War, which actually functioned as a deterrent \nand managed to stabilize the international scene in some \"realpolitik\" sense, a modern arms race in a region known \nfor suicide bombings could trigger catastrophic results.\n\nFor this reason, Israel may find some unlikely allies in its neighborhood in the form of certain powerful Arab \ncountries, such as Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, which is not keen on the notion of a nuclearized Shi'a-dominated \nIran in their backyard. Israel may also find there is a geopolitical benefit to resolving the Palestinian issue, thereby \nminimizing its field of enemies.  But the very complexity of the Arab backyard may present yet another reason why \n\n\n\nIsrael may decide that targeted strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities -- regardless of the risk -- are worth the effort. \nThe smaller Arab states may be compelled to move from moderation and tacit pro-Western inclinations toward \nmore hardline and pro-Iranian stances by virtue of the influence of a nuclearized Iran. That is to say, small Arab \nstates may believe they have no choice but to throw their lot in with a nuclear Iran despite their past cooperation \nwith the West. It was implausible that Israel -- and, indeed, the West -- would look positively on the prospect of a \npolitically-strengthened and nuclearized Iran standing strong in the heart of the Middle East.\n\nUpdate --\n\nWith the prospect of strikes by Israel against Iran's nuclear facilities looming, on September 5, 2010, Iranian \nPresident Mahmoud Ahmadinejad warned that any attack against his country would mean the end of the Jewish \nState of Israel. During  a visit to Qatar, Ahmadinejad said, \"Any offensive against Iran means the annihilation of the \nZionist entity.\"  Expressing his antipathy for Israel, he continued, \"Iran does not care much about this entity \nbecause it is on its way to decay.\" Ahmadinejad also appeared to dismiss the notion of an attack by either Israel or \nthe United States on Iranian nuclear facilities in the first place, saying that those two countries, \"know that Iran is \nready and has the potential for a decisive and wide-scale response.\"  But with an eye on shoring up support from \nsmaller Arab countries that house United States military bases, Ahmadinejad said called for more cooperation \nbetween Muslim countries of the Middle East despite the sectarian schism between Shi'ites and Sunnis.\n\nOn September 23, 2010, delegates from the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Costa Rica and 27 \nEuropean Union countries walked out in protest during Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's address to the \nUnited Nations General Assembly.  At issue was the Iranian president's  statement that \"some segments within the \nU.S. government\" may have orchestrated the  September 11, 2001 terror attacks in the United States as part of an \nAmerican conspiracy to protect Israel.\n\nMark Kornblau, a spokesman for the United States Mission to the United Nations issued a statement asserting that \nthe Iranian president \"has yet again chosen to spout vile conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic slurs that are as \nabhorrent and delusional as they are predictable.\"  The situation would not help efforts to bring Iran together with \nthe six powers -- the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Russia, France and Germany -- for negotiations on \nthe matter of Iran's controversial nuclear development program.  British  Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg  \nhighlighted the pall cast on the hopes for renewed negotiations by Ahmadinejad's comments saying: \"An issue of \ngrave global concern has been overshadowed by the bizarre, offensive and attention-grabbing pronouncements by \nPresident Ahmadinejad from this podium yesterday. His remarks were intended to distract attention from Iran's \nobligations and to generate media headlines. They deserve to do neither.\"  Outside the United Nations compound \nin New York, thousands of demonstrators gathered to protest the presence of President Ahmadinejad there.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the multilateral walkout of Ahmadinejad's speech notwithstanding, the Iranian \npresident hinted on September 24, 2010 that his country would consider ending uranium enrichment, if nuclear fuel \ncould be sent to Tehran for a medical research reactor that produces medical isotopes for patients. He said, \"We \nwill consider halting uranium enrichment whenever nuclear fuel is provided to us.\"  Ahmadinejad explained that Iran \nhad no need to enrich uranium at levels of three to 20 percent beyond medical research, but that his country was \nforced to do so out of necessity.  Indeed, such levels of enrichment, while still not as high as that needed for \nweapons-grade development, have nonetheless alarmed the West.  In an interview with the Associated Press, \nAhmadinejad said, \"We were not interested to carry out 20 percent enrichment. They (the U.S. and its allies) \npoliticized the issue. We were forced to do it to support the (medical) patients.\"  President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad \nalso said that Iran was interested in setting a date to re-open talks with the aforementioned six powers. In this way, \nby the autumn  of 2010, Iran was indicating that it was ready to return to the negotiating table for discussions with \nworld powers pertaining to that country's controversial nuclear program.\n\nAt issue has been Iran's insistence on pursuing a nuclear program in defiance of Western countries, who have \naccused Iran of having a nuclear weapons proliferation agenda. While Iran has denied these ambitions and insisted \nthat its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, it has nonetheless violated international regulations by \nconstructing a clandestine enrichment plant at Qom. The construction of the secret enrichment plan in Qom -- \nrevealed in 2009 -- was in violation of the safeguard provisions set forth in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \n\n\n\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), and effectively fueled global anxieties about Iran's true intent. In response, the United \nNations, as well as the United States and European Union, have imposed sanctions against Iran in an effort to \nsuppress that country's nuclear ambitions.\n\nNow, there seemed to be some multilateral efforts to see the nuclear talks resumed with Catherine Ashton, the \nsecurity and foreign affairs chief of the European Union, suggesting that fresh negotiations be held in Vienna \"over \nthree days in mid-November.\" Such a meeting would presumably take place with the participation of the United \nStates, Britain, China, France, Russia and Germany. This announcement came after a meeting between Ashton \nand United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Belgium. Referring to Iran's main nuclear diplomat, Darren \nEnnis, a spokesperson for Ashton, said: \"Ashton hopes Mr. (Saeed) Jalili will respond positively and looks forward \nto constructively engaging with Iran next month.\" For his part, Jalili was reported to have welcomed Ashton's \noverture during an interview on Iranian state television. Jalili reportedly said, \"We have always said talk for \ncooperation with Iran is the only suitable alternative for (the West).\"\n\nBy  October 29, 2010, Iran said that it was prepared to participate in talks dealing with its controversial nuclear \nprogram. According to Ashton, a letter received from Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Jalili, made clear that \nnegotiations could resume at a date after November 10, 2010.  The announcement came at a time when the United \nStates was reportedly forging a new fuel exchange deal (re: a proposed plan to send  Iran's uranium abroad for \nprocessing and conversion into fuel rods for use in the research reactor). Indeed, United States Department of \nState spokesman, P.J. Crowley reportedly confirmed the reports that his country, in collaboration with European \nallies, were working on a new nuclear exchange proposal for Iran.  A previous proposal, which was rejected by Iran, \nwould have transported 2,650 pounds of uranium outside of Iran for enrichment; this new proposal would \nsignificantly increased the amount of uranium to be enriched externally ultimately for use in a medical research \nreactor.  Iran would also be asked to halt production of nuclear fuel at 20 percent enrichment levels; typically, higher \nenrichment levels denote weapons grade uranium and a cessation of nuclear fuel production at that level would \nindicate good faith toward Iran's claim that it has no nuclear weapons development agenda.\n\nIt was yet to be seen how Tehran would respond to these new conditions. Iran's willingness to return to the \nnegotiating table could well suggest that the newest round of sanctions against Iran have had an effect on the \ncountry, effectively thrusting it into a position of flexibility. However, such presumed flexibility was not on display on \nNov. 10, 2010 when Iranian President Ahmadinejad characterized his country's right to nuclear capabilities as non-\nnegotiable. In a televised speech, he said, \"We have repeatedly said that our (nuclear) rights are not negotiable ... \nWe only hold talks to resolve international problems ... to help the establishment of peace.\" Diplomats from the \nEuropean Union offered the most favorable interpretation of Ahmadinejad's statement, suggesting he was simply \nrecapitulating Iran's expressed stance while not foreclosing negotiations on finding a resolution.\n\nAround the same period, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Jalili, dispatched a letter to EU foreign affairs chief Ashton \nin which the dates November 23, 2010, and December 5, 2010, were mentioned in terms of scheduling the much-\nanticipated nuclear negotiations. With the November date passing, all eyes were on forthcoming nuclear \nnegotiations to convene in December 2010. Meanwhile, on November 9, 2010, United States President Barack \nObama renewed an existing freeze on Iranian government assets held in his country. That freeze has been in place \nsince the Iran hostage crisis of 1979 and is subject to annual renewal.\n\nBy the start of December 2010, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  excoriated Iran for its non-\ncompliance with international nuclear monitoring. The director of the IAEA, General Yukiya Amano, railed against \nIran for failing to cooperate with IAEA inspectors.  He said, \"The agency needs Iran's cooperation in clarifying \noutstanding issues which give rise to concerns about possible military dimensions to its nuclear program.\" This \nparticular statement appeared to bolster Western fears that Iran does indeed possess nuclear weapons \ndevelopment ambitions, its protestations to the contrary notwithstanding. Indeed, areport released in February 2010 \nby the IAEA suggested that Iran was already working on the development of a nuclear-armed missile.\n\nWith the nuclear negotiations looming, on December 2, 2010, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany issued a \njoint statement that read as follows: \"There is no alternative: Iran must actively address the lack of confidence in the \nexclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear program.\"  The statement noted that the aforementioned report on Iran's \n\n\n\nnuclear program by the IAEA \"paints a very disturbing picture\" of Tehran's actions.  The statement continued of the \nIAEA report, \"It again testifies that Iran continues down the path of non-compliance and confrontation.\"  Accordingly, \nthe United Kingdom, France, and Germany called on  Iran to move off the \"path of non-compliance and \nconfrontation\" and, instead, act in a productive manner at the much-anticipated multilateral talks to be held in \nGeneva, Switzerland.\n\nFor its part, Iran agreed to meet with a representative of a six-party multilateral bloc [Catherine Ashton]  but \nemphasized that it would  not negotiate about its \"nuclear rights.\"  The reference to \"nuclear rights\" has been \nregarded by Western powers as a  euphemism for Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions.  Indeed, Iran has been \nsteadfast on its insistence that it should not have to limit or curb uranium enrichment.\n\nMultilateral nuclear negotiations were scheduled to begin on December 6, 2010 in Geneva, Switzerland with Iran \npresent to discuss its controversial nuclear program with the major powers -- the United States, the United \nKingdom, France, Germany, Russia and China.\n\nAll six countries would like to see Iran  suspend uranium enrichment in return for an incentives package.\n\nTo that end, the United Kingdom, France, Germany were hoping that the negotiations in Geneva would serve \"to \nengage Iran into a phased approach of confidence building which should lead to meaningful negotiations.\"  The \nUnited States envoy to the IAEA, Ambassador Glyn Davies, struck a similar tone saying that his aspirations were \nfor \"frank, constructive and meaningful\" negotiations with Iran.  He continued, \"We would like to arrive at an early \nnegotiated resolution of international concerns with Iran's nuclear program.\" Davies was also realistic about the \ndifficulty of the goals at hand, noting, Iran nuclear program and uranium enrichment constituted \"a problem that will \nnot go away absent meaningful and concrete steps by Iran.\"\n\nPerhaps indicating that the two sides were not viewing the agenda in quite the same way, Iran's ambassador to the \nIAEA, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, said that his country was ready for talks to resolve global and regional issues, \ndescribed as \"conflicts of the whole world.\"  But dealing with \"conflicts of the whole world\" was hardly  the stated \ngoal of the nuclear negotiations and could indicate that Iran seeks to dilute the discussions at hand.\n\nAnother problem at hand has been Iran's skepticism about the intentions of the wider global community, manifest in \na quasi-covert war against Iran.  Of concern for Iran have been the assassinations of two Iranian nuclear scientists, \nalong with  the attempted murder of a third such professional. In addition, Iran's computer systems at the  Bushehr \nnuclear reactor was  subject to a computer virus, which was believed to have caused the temporary  shutdown of \nthe Natanz centrifuges in November 2010.  In Iran, these incidences have been attributed to either Israel or the \nUnited States and was likely to fuel further intransigence by an infuriated Iran.\n\nSuch an end was not helped by the infamous \"Wikileaks\" revelations in which confidential government cables were \npublicized.  Of note was the  revelation that some Arab governments aligned with the United States actually \nencouraged the United States to  carry out targeted strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities.  While it would come as \nno surprise to find that Israel considers Iran's nuclear ambitions to be a threat, the revelation that Arab countries in \nthe Middle East would find consensus with Israel on the matter of a nuclearized Iran could be seen as somewhat \nmore surprising.  Nevertheless, as the Sunni-Shi'a schism escalates around the world, perhaps it is not so unlikely \nthat Israel and Arab regimes might a shared anxiety about a nuclear-armed Iran in their collective backyard. The \nresult of the \"Wikileaks\" revelations, though, was that smaller Arab countries in the Middle East might now seek to \nassuage infuriated Iran, effectively lessening the weight of global power against Iran's burgeoning nuclear program.\n\nBut another outcome of the \"Wikileaks\" revelations has been that the Obama administration in the United States \nexpected its outreach to Iran to end in failure. The \"Wikileaks\" document deluge included evidence that the United \nStates was quite prepared for Iran's intransigence and unwillingness to meet in the proverbial middle.  Clearly, that \noutreach to Iran was for the benefit of other world powers, in the hopes that by exerting all diplomatic avenues, \ncountries such as France and Russia would be more amenable to the idea of harsh sanctions against Iran.  To that \nend, it would appear that the Obama administration was successful in applying the so-called \"carrot and stick\" \napproach to Iran's uranium enrichment activities, if its actual goal was the institution of a harsh sanctions regime.  \n\n\n\nBut success in actually curtailing Iran's uraniumactivities was yet to be determined.  The talks set to commence in \nGeneva would be a step in the direction of progress, if the world powers are able to make progress on a fuel-swap \ndeal for a Tehran medical research reactor.\n\nOn December 5, 2010 -- on the eve of the nuclear talks,  Iran announced that it had made strides in its efforts to \nproduce raw uranium.  Iran said that it had not only produced raw or \"yellowcake\" uranium, but that it was ready for \nenrichment.  According to Iran's nuclear chief, Salehi, the batch of domestically-produced yellowcake uranium from \nthe Gachin mine would be transferred to the Isfahan nuclear conversion facility, where it can be enriched.  Of \ncourse, enriched uranium at high levels is used for the production of nuclear bombs. By releasing this information \nahead of the much-anticipated nuclear negotiations,  Iran to staking out a defiant position on the global landscape.  \nClearly,  Iran wanted the world to know that they had access to raw uranium despite the general view that it was \nrunning low on such stocks.  In so doing, Iran was making to clear to the world that it was within its power to move \nforward with uranium enrichment.  Was this move intended to bolster Iran's negotiating power?  Or was it intended \nto provoke an international response? These are open questions yet to be determined as the wider global \ncommunity closes ranks over the prospect of a nuclearized Iran.\n\nAt the close of the talks, Iran and the multilateral parties agreed to resume negotiations in January 2011 in the \nTurkish city of Istanbul.\n\nOn January 8, 2011, the Wall Street Journal reported that Iran's weapons development capacity may have been \ncurtailed by the more stringent sanctions regime championed by the West and imposed by the United Nations \nSecurity Council.  According to Israel's outgoing intelligence head, Meir Dagan,  Iran was unlikely to be able to build \na nuclear weapon until 2015.  Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Moshe Yaalon was making a similar claim on Israeli \nArmy Radio also that Iran was three years away from developing a nuclear warhead.\n\nThis stance was quite a departure from an earlier timeline by Israel that suggested Iran was close to being able to \nbuild a bomb, thus raising speculation about a potential strike by Israel on nuclear targets in Iran. Now, Israel's \nposition  appeared to be in line with the United States' claim that international sanctions have limited Iran from \nprocuring materials needed for the building of a nuclear bomb.  Of course, the outgoing Dagan also pointed to \n\"covert activities\" as being an additional reason for the revised timeline.  In fact, officials across the world have \nnoted that Iran's ability to deploy advanced centrifuge machines, which would be needed for the production of \nhighly enriched uranium, has been stymied to some degree. That is not to say that concerns about Iran's nuclear \nambitions have abated in any way.  Both Israel and the United States have maintained the view that Iran actively \nseeks to produce nuclear weapons and that it has sufficient stockpiled low enriched uranium to build up to four \nnuclear bombs, assuming that further processing was possible.  That being said, the revised timeline would suggest \nthat Israel was unlikely to carry out targeted strikes on nuclear facilities in Iran in the near future.  As well, the \nUnited States was highly likely to champion the idea of continuing, and even intensifying, the harsh sanctions* \nimposed on Iran.  Note that multilateral talks on Iran's nuclear program resumed in late January 2011 in Turkey.\n\n*The punitive  sanctions imposed in June 2010 were regarded as the harshest set of measures to date. The main \nprovisions included an arms embargo, which would prohibit Iran from purchasing heavy weapons, such as attack \nhelicopters and missiles;  stringent rules regarding financial transactions with Iranian banks;  and a wider swath of \nIranian individuals and companies to be subject to travel bans and asset freezes. In addition, a new system of cargo \ninspections would be established to detect and stop Iran from acquiring banned materials.  This round of sanctions \nwas intended to bypass affecting the lives of average Iranians while concentrating on the powerful Iranian \nRevolutionary Guard, which has emerged as a power center within that country, and which was believed to be the \nleading entity behind Iran's nuclear ambitions.\n\nAt the close of February 2011, the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, the  International Atomic Energy \nAgency (IAEA), expressed concerns about the \"possible military dimensions\" of Iranian nuclear agenda.  At issue \nwas a report by the IAEA that reportedly included the following assessment: \"Based on the agency's analysis of \nadditional information since August 2008, including new information recently received, there are further concerns \nwhich the agency also needs to clarify with Iran.\" The IAEA then called on Iran to comply with the investigations into \nIran's  weapons experiments -- requirements not met by that country since 2008. The report also noted that Iran \n\n\n\nwas not cooperating in the effort to assure the IAEA that all nuclear material in Iran was for only peaceful \npurposes.  This has been the claim of Iran since the start of its nuclear development program, however, it cannot be \nverified without that country's cooperation in IAEA investigations.  Clearly, such investigations were unable to be \ncarried out.  Of particular concern was the allegation that Iran was trying to develop nuclear payload for its missiles.\n\nYet even as these concerns by the United Nations were being expressed, Iran experienced a setback with its \nnuclear program when unspecified safety concerns compelled technicians to unload fuel rods from the nuclear \npower plant at Bushehr. Speculation arose as to whether or not the mysterious Stuxnet computer virus may have \nbeen to blame for this latest complication with Iran's nuclear development program. Stuxnet --a malicious computer \nvirus believed to be developed either by the Israelis or the Americans --  already resulted in previous setbacks to \nIran's overall nuclear program. Fot its part, Iran denied that Stuxnet was a factor. That being said, the plant at \nBushehr has never been a concern for the IAEA since it was constructed by Russia under international approval \nand has been subject to the nuclear watchdog agency's supervision.  That being said, it was clear that Iran was \nplaced in an embarrassing position on the world stage, since the Iranian authorities  have  wasted few opportunities \nto tout its nuclear success at the Bushehr plant.\n\nAs reported by Iranian news, Ali Asghar Soltanieh -- Iran's s ambassador to the IAEA -- explained the situation as \nfollows: \"Upon a demand from Russia, which is responsible for completing the Bushehr nuclear power plant, fuel \nassemblies from the core of the reactor will be unloaded for a period of time to carry out tests and take technical \nmeasurements. \"After the tests are conducted, (the fuel) will be placed in the core of the reactor once again.\"\n\nBy Feb. 28, 2011, Russia's nuclear energy shed further light on the situation in Iran by explaining that the  order to \nremove fuel from the nuclear plant was made as a result of concerns that metal particles might be contaminating \nfuel assemblies.\n\nMay 2011 saw the emergence of a report by the United Nations watchdog nuclear agency, the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency (IAEA), in which it was reported that Iran was continuing its efforts to build nuclear weapons, in \ndefiance of United Nations sanctions. The IAEA asserted that Iran was stockpiling low-enriched uranium, pointing \ntoward the fact that Iran's total output of low-enriched uranium since 2007 had reached 4.1 tons -- an increase from \n3.6 tons earlier in the year, and indicating an amount that, if refined further, could potentially contribute to the \ndevelopment of at least two bombs. Throughout, Iran has claimed that its nuclear program is for civilian energy \ngenerating purposes, the actual evidence notwithstanding. The report by the IAEA, which was compiled ahead of a \nmeeting of the IAEA board in June 2011, was expected to be delivered to the United Nations Security Council, \nwhere that body would have to consider how to respond to the nuclear developments in Iran. The key question to \nbe addressed would be whether Iran would be regarded as meeting its international obligations in the context of \nnuclear development.\n\nIn mid-June 2011, as reported by the Associated Press, Iran was set to install advanced  and efficient centrifuges  -- \nappropriate for higher grade uranium enrichment -- at its new uranium enrichment site at Qom.  That site at Qom \nhad been constructed secretly, out of the eyes of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  Ultimately \ndiscovered by Western intelligence, revelations about the existence of the Qom site undermined Iran's claims that \nits nuclear ambitions were peaceful.  Iran's endeavors to produce raw or \"yellowcake\" uranium at the Gachin,  \nready for enrichment at the Isfahan conversion facility (publicized in late 2010), only served to further undermine \nIran's claims.  A February 2011 by the IAEA further deepened worries about Iran's nuclear ambitions as it noted \nIran was trying to develop nuclear payload for its missiles. Indeed, making matters even more intense, Iranian Vice \nPresident Fereidoun Abbasi said in June 2011 that his country intended to increased its output of higher enriched \nuranium threefold in 2011, and that the entire nuclear enrichment program was to be moved to the clandestine \nfacility at Qom.  Of course, enriched uranium at high levels is used for the production of nuclear bombs.  These \nmoves seemed to highlight Iran continuing intransigence about its controversial nuclear program.\n\nBy late June 2011, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard tested 14 surface-to-surface missiles as part of its  \"Great \nProphet 6\" war games exercises, which were intended as a show of strength towards.  Among the missiles fired \nnine Zelzal missiles, two Shahab-1s, two Shahab-2s and one upgraded Shahab-3 missile.  It was not immediately \nknown if any of the missiles tested were capable of carrying nuclear weaponry.  According to the Iranian state \n\n\n\nmedia, the surface-to-surface missiles had a maximum range of 1,250 miles ( 2,000 kilometers).  The head of the \nIranian Revolutionary Guards' aerospace division, Commander Amir Ali Hajizadeh, made a point of  noting that  \nIran was prepared to retaliate against potential attacks by hostile nations, such as the United States (U.S.) and \nIsrael. Indeed, he emphasized the fact that American military bases were located well within the range of several of \nthe tested missiles, and were therefore vulnerable targets.  At issue for Iran have been suggestions from the U.S. \nand Israel that they would not foreclose military strikes on Iran if diplomatic overtures do not result in an end to that \ncountry's nuclear weapons  development activity.  For its part, the U.S. has noted that the prevailing United Nations \nSecurity Council Resolution 1929 levied against Iran prohibits that country from any activity related to ballistic \nmissiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons.\n\nIn a related development, Russia decided to suspend the delivery of S-300 missiles to Iran after the U.S. and Israel \nconveyed  concern that Iran could use the anti-aircraft missiles as a means to protect its nuclear facilities, which \nwere under scrutiny.\n\nNote that in mid-July 2011,  Iran's foreign ministry announced that it was installing advanced models of centrifuges \nfor the purpose of  enriching uranium.  Since  the new centrifuges could significantly shorten the time needed to \nstockpile material used for both civilian and military purposes, the move aimed to accelerate Iran's nuclear \ndevelopment program and promised to raise alarm bells in the West. France quickly responded to the news by \ncondemning Iran's action and casting it as  \"a clear provocation.\" France said that Iran's actions clearly undermined \nthat country's claims of a peaceful civilian nuclear program and dispatched a statement which read as follows: \"(It) \nclearly confirms the suspicions of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and of the international \ncommunity about the finality of a program with no credible civilian application.\" But for its part, Iran appeared \nundaunted, instead claiming that it had notified the IAEA of its moves to  install new centrifuges.  Iranian Foreign \nMinistry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, said,  \"The agency is aware that our peaceful nuclear activities are \nprogressing ... the installment is a confirmation of the Islamic Republic's success in the nuclear field.\"\n\nAt the start of September 2011, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency expressed \"growing concern\" over \nIran's controversial nuclear development agenda. At issue was the claim by the  International Atomic Energy \nAgency (IAEA) that Iran shows signs of working on a clandestine nuclear weapons program.  The IAEA said that its \nconcerns were based on  \"extensive and comprehensive\" information that had been provided by several countries.  \nAccording to extracts of the report detailed by Agence France Presse, the evidence pointed towards the \ndevelopment of a nuclear payload for a missile.  As well, the report indicated Iran's intent to enrich uranium at an \nunderground bunker close to Qom.  It should be noted that  a nuclear facility at Qom was constructed secretly, out \nof the eyes of the IAEA some time prior.  Ultimately discovered by Western intelligence, revelations about the \nexistence of the Qom site undermined Iran's claims that its nuclear ambitions were peaceful.\n\nNow in 2011, with these concerns mounting on the part of the IAEA, the nuclear watchdog agency's  Director \nGeneral Yukiya Amano had written to Iran's nuclear chief, Fereydoun Abbasi Davani, to remind that country that it \nshould adhere to its international obligations.  Director General Amano urged Iran to chart the course of prudence in \norder to establish its credibility in the eyes of the global community, which largely does not believe Iran's claim that \nits nuclear agenda is peaceful.  Note that the the United Nations Security Council has imposed four rounds of \nsanctions on Iran due to its refusal to freeze its enrichment program.\n\nIn the autumn of 2011, the United States was looking to parlay the allegations (discussed below) that the Iranian \nQuds Force attempted to assassinate the Saudi ambassador into international action against Iran's nuclear \ndevelopment program.  To this end, United States President Barack Obama pressured inspectors from the United \nNations nuclear watchdog agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to release classified intelligence \ninformation illuminating Iran's continuing efforts to develop nuclear weapons technology.\n\nThere have been some hints of the evidence against Iran available via the claims of IAEA director, Yukiya Amano, \nwho suggested in September 2011 that Iran was working on nuclear triggers and warheads. According to the New \nYork Times, insiders familiar with the findings of the classified IAEA report have intimated that Iran has made efforts \nto develop specific technologies related to the design and detonation of a nuclear device, including the mechanisms \n\n\n\nfor creating detonators, the method for turning uranium into bomb fuel, and the formulas for generating neutrons to \nspur a chain reaction, and also casting conventional explosives in a shape that could set off a nuclear explosion.\n\nClearly, coming after the revelations about a disturbing assassination and terrorism plot linked to the Iranian Quds \nForce, the move to declassify the IAEA's report was oriented toward isolating Iran, now with accentuated political \nammunition.  Indeed, the United States aimed to argue the point that Iran was a grave threat to global security, \ntherefore, the need to halt work on Iran's suspected weapons program was imminent. To this end, Tommy Vietor, a \nspokesperson for the National Security Council, said: \"The United States believes that a comprehensive \nassessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and \nwhat to do about it.\"\n\nOf course, one of the risks of disclosing the findings of the classified report was that Iran could move to eject IAEA \ninspectors from that country, effectively foreclosing one of the few avenues available to the international community \nto monitor Iran's nuclear activities.\n\nMeanwhile, among the punitive measures being advocated by senior White House officials was a prohibition on \nfinancial transactions with Iran's central bank.  Another punitive measure under consideration was the expansion of \nthe prevailing ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by Iranian companies under the control of the Islamic \nRevolutionary Guards Corps.\n\nThese options have not, in the past, gained traction due to objections by China among other Asian countries.  In \nthe case of China, as a significant buyer of Iranian oil, that country's energy interests could be affected.  At the \nsame time, key United States allies, such as Japan and South Korea, are also buyers of Iranian oil but additionally \nhandle transactions via the Iranian Central Bank. Complicating the scenario even further, oil and financial sanctions \ncarry with them the threat of spiking the price of oil at a time when the economies of the United States, the \nEuropean Union, and several other major global players, were enduring sluggish growth.\n\nBy the start of November 2011, the Washington Post reported that Iran had received development assistance from \nexperts from Russia, Pakistan, and North Korea to build a nuclear weapon. David Albright, a former official with the \nIAEA and the president of the Institute for Science and International Security, was reported to have said that while \nIran may have halted its nuclear agenda in 2003 due to international pressure, nuclear weapons development \nresearch has since kicked into high gear. As stated by Albright in an interview with the Washington Post, \"After \n2003, money was made available for research in areas that sure look like nuclear weapons work but were hidden \nwithin civilian institutions.\"\n\nThese allegations were expected to be outlined more fully by the IAEA itself in a new report.  Leaked information \nsuggested that the IAEA report would register Iran's clandestine nuclear weapons development program, which \nincludes computer models of nuclear warheads.\n\nIndeed, on Nov. 8, 2011, United Nations weapons inspectors released information indicating a \"credible\" case that \n\"Iran has carried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear device\" and arguing that such activities \ncould well be ongoing.  United Nations nuclear inspectors gave no estimate of how long it would be until Iran would \nbe able to produce a nuclear weapon; however, they confirmed the aforementioned claim that Iran had created \ncomputer models of nuclear explosions in 2008 and 2009, and conducted experiments on nuclear triggers.  The \nIAEA was emphatic in noting that the research would only be used to develop a nuclear bomb trigger. In this way, \nthe report, which was published on the Institute for Science and International Security's website, was deemed the \nharshest assessment by the IAEA of Iran's nuclear development program.\n\nThe IAEA then passed a resolution expressing \"deep and increasing concern\" about Iran's nuclear program, and \ndemanded that Iran clarify outstanding questions related the country's nuclear capabilities. The resolution was \nadopted following a vote at the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, with 32 votes in its favor and only Cuba \nand Ecuador voting against it. Iran's IAEA envoy,  Ali Ashgar Soltanieh , dismissed the development and  said the \nresolution would only strengthen Iran's resolve to go forward with its nuclear development.  He said, \"It will be \nbusiness as usual... We will continue our work as before.\"\n\n\n\nWhile Iran was not on the verge of a declaration of its nuclear breakout capability, clearly, these revelations would \nserve to reinvigorate the debate about what method could be used to stop Iran from accessing a nuclear weapon. \nUnder consideration would be options ranging from sanctions, to sabotage and military action.  Despite Israeli \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's assertion that the report made clear the need for global action to stop Iran \nfrom developing nuclear weapons, Russia wasted no time in foreclosing the possibility of its support for fresh \nsanctions.  With United Nations sanctions unlikely,  on Nov. 21, 2011, the United States, the United Kingdom, and \nCanada slapped fresh sanctions on  Iran's financial and energy sectors.\n\nIran has argued that its nuclear development program is strictly for civilian energy purposes, but which the West \nhas insisted that Iran seeks nuclear weapons.  Ahead of the aforementioned IAEA report, Iran  rejected the already \ncirculating charges. Indeed, Iran's Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar Salehi said the findings of the IAEA  were \"unfounded \nand baseless.\"\n\nSee below for latest developments related to Iran's nuclear development program and international relations.\n\nSpecial Report:\n\nU.S uncovers plot by Iranian agents to assassinate Saudi envoy and bomb Saudi and Israeli embassies\n\nSummary:\n\nU.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies uncovered a conspiracy plot by Iranian agents working on behalf of \nthe elite Iranian Quds Force. The plot included plans to assassinate the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United \nStates, and to bomb the Saudi and Israeli embassies in Washington D.C. and Buenos Aires. The White House has \npromised to hold Tehran responsibility for its involvement in this elaborate plot of assassination and terrorism.  \nMeanwhile, a connection between the Iranian agents and Mexican drug cartels has been uncovered, effectively \ncomplicating the already-tangled web of complex geopolitics.  The U.S. wasted no time in attempting in leveraging \nthese allegations to isolate Iran and place pressure on that country's nucleardevelopment program.\n\nIn detail:\n\nFederal law enforcement authorities and intelligence agencies in the United States have reportedly uncovered and \nfoiled a plot by Iranian agents to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States, Adel Al-Jubeir, and to \nbomb the embassies of Saudi Arabia and Israel in Washington D.C. United States officials indicated there were \ndiscussions about extending the bombing targets to the Saudi and Israeli embassies in Buenos Aires -- the capital \nof Argentina.\n\nAccording to court documents filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York, the individuals accused of \nconspiring to carry out this plot were two men of Iranian origin -- Manssor Arbab Arbabsiar and Gholam Shakuri.  \nOne of the men, Arbabsiar, was a naturalized United States citizen holding passports from both the United States \nand Iran. He was arrested on Sept. 29, 2011, and was said to be in United States custody and cooperating with \nAmerican authorities.  Indeed, Arbabsiar confessed his involvement in the plot, according to media reports. The \nother man, Shakuri, was apparently still at large, presumably in Iran where he was reported to be a member of \nIran's Quds Force --  --  an elite division  of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.\n\nBoth defendants were charged with conspiracy to murder a foreign official; conspiracy to use a weapon of mass \ndestruction (explosives); and conspiracy to commit an act of international terrorism transcending national \nboundaries. Arbabsiar was further charged with an additional count of foreign travel and use of interstate and \nforeign commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire. Arbabsiar was due to appear in a federal court in \nNew York; if convicted of all charges, he would face life imprisonment.\n\nIn a news conference on Oct. 11, 2011, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said: \"The criminal complaint unsealed \ntoday exposes a deadly plot directed by factions of the Iranian government to assassinate a foreign Ambassador on \nUnited States soil with explosives.\" He continued, \"Through the diligent and coordinated efforts of our law \n\n\n\nenforcement and intelligence agencies, we were able to disrupt this plot before anyone was harmed.  We will \ncontinue to investigate this matter vigorously and bring those who have violated any laws to justice.\"\n\nAttorney General Holder explained that while payment for the operation had already been transferred via a New \nYork bank, the conspiracy had not yet progressed to the point of the suspects acquiring explosives for the bombing \naspect of the operation.  Attorney General Holder also confirmed reports that Arbabsiar and Shakuri were \nconnected to the Quds Force --  the elite division of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which has been \naccused of being responsible for operations in other countries, and which has been a major player in Iran's \ncontroversial nuclear development program.  Attorney General Holder additionally made it clear that the plot was \n\"conceived\" in Iran by the Quds force, effectively drawing a clear  line of connection to Iran's power base.\n\nAttorney General was unrestrained in his characterization of the plot, which he said had been orchestrated from the \nspring of 2011 to October 2011.  He emphatically asserted that the conspiracy was  \"conceived, sponsored and \ndirected by Iran,\" and warned that the White House would hold Tehran accountable for it alleged involvement in an \nelaborate plot of assassination and terrorism.  It should be noted that United States officials were tying the plot to \nhigh levels of the Iranian government, albeit not directly to the Iranian president or ayatollah.  It  should also be \nnoted that the United States Department of State has listed Iran as a \"state sponsor\" of terrorism since 1984; now in \n2011, this latest revelation of an international conspiracy would no doubt reify that classification.\n\nA Justice Department report detailed Arbabsiar's recruitment by senior officials in Iran's Quds Force, which \nreportedly funded and directed the elaborate assassination and terror plot. Extracts from that Justice Department \nreport also indicated that Arbabsiar had gone so far as to discuss a Washington D.C. restaurant frequented by the \nSaudi ambassador and United States senators, as a possible venue for the target of the assassination.  Those \nextracts suggested that high level Iranians were unconcerned about the additional collateral damage to American \npoliticians or civilians in carrying out such an attack.  As the trusted and long-serving envoy of Saudi Arabia's King \nAbdullah, the assassination of United States-educated Adel Al-Jubeir, along with potential deaths of United States \ncitizens, would undoubtedly cause international furor.\n\nThere was an additional international trajectory, reminiscent of a Hollywood movie script, as the Iranian agents were \ntrying to secure the assistance of Mexican drug cartels in carrying out the assassination element of the plot.  \nIndeed, Arbabsiar was arrested as he attempted to travel to Mexico to meet with a Mexican drug cartel operative, \nallegedly to move forward with this plan.  The Mexican informant was, in fact, working on behalf of the United States \nDrug Enforcement Agency.  The involvement of Iranian agents, Mexican drug cartels, and terror targets on United \nStates and Argentine soil, belonging to Israeli, and Saudi interests, effectively complicated the already-tangled web \nof complex geopolitics and international intrigue.\n\nThe mechanics of the plot notwithstanding, there would no doubt be questions about the motivation for the Iranian \nQuds Force to act against Saudi and Israeli interests on United States and Argentine soil.  Of course, Iran's \ngovernment has never restrained its expression of enmity for Israel; its antagonism towards Saudi Arabia is more \nopaque.\n\nIn fact, the Middle East has become the terrain of an ethno-sectarian power struggle between Sunni Islamic Saudi \nArabia and Shi'a Iran in regional countries with mixed and complicated demographic mixtures of Sunnis and \nShi'ites.  According to United States authorities,  Iranian-backed militias have been responsible for the upsurge in \nsectarian violence in post-invasion Iraq, where Shi'a Iran hopes to extend its influence. United States authorities \nhave also alleged that the Iranian Quds Force has been instrumental in attacking American troops in Iraq.\n\nLikewise, in Bahrain, which has a similar Shi'a-Sunni demographic composition as Iraq, and which has seen its own \nepisode of unrest in the so-called 2011 \"Arab Spring,\" Iran's desire to extend its influence was apparent.  \nSpecifically, as Saudi Arabian troops aided the Bahraini government in cracking down on the predominantly Shi'a \nopposition in Bahrain, Iran was quick to condemn the presence of foreign forces there.  The scenario was a clear \nmanifestation of the prevailing power struggle between the two sectarian power houses of the region -- Sunni Saudi \nArabia and Shi'a Iran.  Thus, it was quite possible that this 2011 assassination and terror plot was another such \nmanifestation of these tensions.\n\n\n\nThere was little doubt that the matter would be taken to the United Nations Security Council, where veto-wielding \npermanent seat holders, China and Russia, have been reluctant to take strong measures against Iran in regard to \nthat country's controversial nuclear development program and its failure to abide with international conventions. \nIndeed, concurrence by China and Russia on the 2010 United Nations Security Council resolution against Iran was \nonly reached due to Iran's unambiguous failure to comply with the standards imposed by the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency (IAEA), and the revelations about clandestine nuclear sites. Now, in 2011,  with news of this \nassassination and terrorism plot, and the implicating of the Iranian regime, heavy pressure would be placed  on \nChina and Russia to again act in concert with the broader international community.\n\nAt the diplomatic level, the Saudi embassy in the United States released a strong statement of appreciation for the \nUnited States government for uncovering and foiling the plot. As well, during a news conference on Oct. 11, 2011, \nUnited States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton delivered a vociferous warning to Tehran that her country would be \nworking with the international community to isolate Iran, and to ensure that it would be held accountable for its \nactions in violation of international norms.  Days later, United States President Barack Obama fortified his country's \nstance by confirming that Iran would pay a price for its involvement in this assassination and terrorism plot.  \"We're \ngoing to continue... to mobilize the international community to make sure that Iran is further and further isolated and \npays a price for this kind of behavior,\" President Obama said.  The United States leader stopped short of accusing \nthe uppermost leadership echelon of the Iranian government of being involved in the alleged plot; however, he \nnoted that even if  Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei or President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  did not possess \noperational knowledge of the plot, \"there has to be accountability with respect to anybody in the Iranian government \nengaging in this kind of activity.\"\n\nFor its part, the Iranian government has mocked any claims of its complicity in the conspiracy, suggesting that the \nentire situation had been a sensationalized scheme fabricated by the United States.  It should be noted that the \nRevolutionary Guards holds control over Iran's nuclear program, as well as being the over-arching authority at the \nhelm of the Quds Force -- the very group believed to behind the assassination and terrorism plot discussed here.\n\nSpecial Report\n\nIran under isolation; relations with the West\n\nAs discussed here, due to revelations about Iran's nuclear development program,  the International Atomic Energy \nAgency passed a resolution expressing \"deep and increasing concern\" about Iran's nuclear program, and \ndemanded that Iran clarify outstanding questions related the country's nuclear capabilities. The resolution was \nadopted following a vote at the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, with 32 votes inits favor and only Cuba \nand Ecuador voting against it. Iran's IAEA envoy,  Ali Ashgar Soltanieh , dismissed the development and  said the \nresolution would only strengthen Iran's resolve to go forward with its nuclear development.  He said, \"It will be \nbusiness as usual... We will continue our work as before.\"\n\nWhile Iran was not on the verge of a declaration of its nuclear breakout capability, clearly, these revelations would \nserve to reinvigorate the debate about what method could be used to stop Iran from accessing a nuclear weapon. \nUnder consideration would be options ranging from sanctions, to sabotage and military action.  Despite Israeli \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's assertion that the report made clear the need for global action to stop Iran \nfrom developing nuclear weapons, Russia wasted no time in foreclosing the possibility of its support for fresh \nsanctions.  With United Nations sanctions unlikely,  on Nov. 21, 2011, the United States, the United Kingdom, and \nCanada slapped fresh sanctions on  Iran's financial and energy sectors.\n\nIn addition to the IAEA resolution discussed above, Iran was also subject to further diplomatic pressure and went \nfurther down the road to global isolation when the United Nations General Assembly voted  overwhelmingly in favor \nof a resolution condemning an alleged assassination plot targeting the Saudi ambassador to the United States. The \nresolution stopped short of directly accusing Tehran of the plot,  but nonetheless demanded that Iran \"comply with \nall of its obligations under international law\" and \"co-operate with states seeking to bring to justice all those who \nparticipated in the planning, sponsoring, organization and attempted execution of the plot.\"\n\n\n\nWith international pressure being intensified against  Iran, the Iranian regime appeared to be reacting by lashing out \nat the Western world.  With hostilities already high between Iran and the United States, Tehran appeared to be \ntaking aim at the United Kingdom.  To this end,  by the close of  November 2011, Iran's  Guardian Council of the \nConstitution unanimously voted to reduce diplomatic ties with the United Kingdom. The change would downgrade \ndiplomatic ties with the United Kingdom from the ambassador level to the level of charge d'affaires within a two-\nweek timeframe. Ratification by the Guardian Council came after a vote in the Iranian Majlis or parliament, \napproving  this move.  Iranian radio reported that during the vote, several members of parliament changed \"death to \nBritain.\"  Iran was reacting to pressure from Western countries, including the United Kingdom, to place greater \npolitical and economic pressure on Iran, and particularly, the Central Bank of Iran, in the wake of the \naforementioned report by the IAEA.\n\nIn a further sign that Iran's relations with the countries of the West were on a downward slide, Nov. 29, 2011 saw \nmilitant students aligned with the hard line conservative government in Tehran storm the British embassy \ncompound.  This action appeared to be part of a violent demonstration against the government of the United \nKingdom, which joined the United States in issuing new financial sanctions against Iran.  The militant activists \nreportedly chanted, \"death to England ,\" vandalized the embassy offices, seized sensitive documents, briefly \ndetained some diplomatic personnel, and burned the British flag in acts that constituted  flagrant violations of \ndiplomatic norms.  A separate attack by militant students and activists on a British diplomatic compound in northern \nTehran was also confirmed by the British Foreign Office.  The scenario disturbingly  recalled the shocking assault  \non the American Embassy in 1979 following Iran's Islamic Revolution.\n\nAlthough Iran expressed \"regret\" over the attacks on the British embassy and secondary diplomatic compound, \nwitnesses on the ground in Iran suggested that Iranian security forces did little to quickly end the outbreak of \nviolence against a diplomatic interest.  Indeed, police reportedly allowed the scene to play out for several hours \nbefore taking control of the situation.  There were serious allegations mounting that the assault on the British \nembassy compounds had taken place with approval from Iranian authorities. Furthermore, speculation rested on \nthe involvement of the regime-backed Basiji militia. For his part, British Prime Minister David Cameron said: \"The \nattack on the British embassy in Tehran today was outrageous and indefensible.\"  British authorities warned its \ncitizens in Iran to remain indoors and await advice; they also warned of consequences for Iran in the offing, and \nsummoned the Iranian charge d'affaires.\n\nThe United Kingdom on Nov. 30, 2011 officially downgraded its ties with Iran.  The United Kingdom withdrew all its \ndiplomats from Iran, closed its embassy in Tehran, urged its citizens to exit that country, and  gave Iran 48 hours to \nremove all its staff from the Iranian diplomatic mission in London. Officials in the United Kingdom also went on the \nrecord to note that they believe the attacks on the British embassy in Tehran and the secondary compound were \ncarried out with the tacit approval of Iran's leadership. British Foreign Secretary William Hague, asserted that there \nhad been \"some degree of regime consent\" in the attacks on the embassy and the other diplomatic compound in \nTehran. Dominick Chilcott, the newly-appointed British ambassador to Iran, said: \"This was a state-supported \nactivity.\" In an interview with BBC News, Ambassador Chilcott said that Iran was a country in which an attack on an \nembassy was conducted only \"with the acquiescence and the support of the state.\" These moves collectively \nmarked the worst deterioration of ties between the United Kingdom and Iran in decades.\n\nThe United Kingdom was backed by the  15-nation United Nations Security Council, which condemned the attack \n\"in the strongest terms.\"  Separately, United States President Barack Obama called for the Iranian government to \nensure those responsible faced justice. Germany's Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle characterized the attacks \non the British embassy compounds as \"a violation of international law.\"  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe placed \nthe blame on the Iranian government, saying: \"The Iranian regime has shown what little consideration it has for \ninternational  law.\"\n\nSeveral European countries -- such as France, Germany,  Italy and the Netherlands -- wasted no time in joining the \nWestern thrust to diplomatically isolate Iran by recalling their own ambassadors from Tehran.  France took a further \nstep by withdrawing its embassy staff from Iran.  French officials said the move was being made out of an \nabundance of caution, given the security risks in Iran to Western interests. France's calls for a ban on Iranian oil \nimports and a freeze on central bank assets was expected to heighten bilateral tensions, and effectively place \n\n\n\nFrance in Iran's  firing line, along with the United Kingdom. Russia, which has often been accused by the West of \nbeing \"soft\" on Iran joined the condemnation of the attacks.\n\nAt home in Iran, militant activist students in that country were  at the airport in Tehran, waiting to welcome the \nexpelled Iranian diplomats from London, and chanting slogans, such as \"Death to Britain.\"  The returning \ndiplomats, however, never had any direct encounters with the students at the airport.\n\nThe situation appeared to highlight cleavages in the Iranian leadership regarding the diplomatic farrago. For \nexample, in an interview with Iran's state-run IRNA news agency, Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi  said,  \n\"There is no doubt that Britain is one of the oldest enemies of Iran.\"  He appeared to offer a slight rebuke to the \nmilitant activists who attacked the British embassy, adding:  \"Young revolutionaries should not go beyond the law.\"  \nMeanwhile, the Iranian government targeted the United Kingdom for exacerbating tensions between that country \nand the West, as Iranian foreign ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, said: \"The British government is trying \nto extend to other European countries the problem between the two of us.\"\n\nAs the year 2011 drew to a close, bilateral relations between the United States and Iran -- already dismally bad -- \nsunk even lower as an American drone was reported to be in Iranian hands. The official account was that the \nAmerican drone had been flying in -- or close to -- Iranian air space, and somehow crashed.  The drone, with its \nsensitive intelligence information, was then taken by Iranian authorities.  But a report by the Christian Science \nMonitor suggested that Iran's possession of the drone may not have been the result of an accidental crash.  \nInstead, according to an Iranian engineer,  the country hijacked the drone  and was able to technically take control \nof the aircraft by jamming the control signals, ultimately forcing it into autopilot mode.  The Iranians then vitiated the \nGPS tracking by reconfiguring the GPS coordinates, effectively \"fooling\" the drone into landing  in Iran, rather than \nin Afghanistan, which was where it was programmed to land. The images of the American drone in Iran's \npossession depict an aircraft remarkably intact -- rather than being subject to crash -- thus bolstering the credibility \nof the report by the Christian Science Monitor.\n\nMeanwhile, as discussed above, in December 2011,  Iran claimed that it successfully test-fired a medium-range \nsurface-to-air missile during military exercises in the Persian Gulf at the close of 2011.\n\nMousavi also noted that further missile launches would be carried out in the near future as part of Iran's  naval \nexercises in international waters close to the strategic Strait of Hormuz. On Jan. 2, 2012,  a day after testing a \nmedium-range missile, Iran reportedly test-fired long-range missiles in the Persian Gulf.\n\nThis news served only to bolster Western fears that Iran has made important progress in its nuclear development, \naugmenting anxieties that Iran's ultimate ambition is to  enrich uranium at the 90 per cent level necessary to create \na nuclear bomb.\n\nThis development came as several Western countries indicated their to impose further sanctions on Iran's oil and \nfinancial sectors, to register discontent over that country's continued nuclear ambitions.  On Dec. 31, 2011, \nPresident  Barack Obama signed legislation authorizing a package ofsanctions\n\nIran's central bank and financial sector.  These new sanctions by the United States aimed to intensify the pressure \non Iran's oil sales, most of which are processed by the central bank. Essentially, they would force multinational \ncompanies to choose whether to do business with Iran or the United States.  Perhaps not surprisingly, the Iranian \ncurrency -- the rial -- slipped in value to a record low as a result of the news.\n\nFor its part,  Iran has warned that it might retaliate against international pressure by closing the Strait of Hormuz \nthrough which a significant amount of oil is transported.  Indeed, Iranian Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi \npromised that \"not a drop of oil will pass through the Strait of Hormuz\" if further sanctions were imposed.  That \nbeing said, analysts have noted that such a drastic step by Iran might serve primarily to hurt the Iranian economy, \nand imperil relations with Russia and China.  Accordingly, the threat was being regarded through the prism of \nskepticism.\n\n\n\nMoreover, United States Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta warned that a closure of the strait would yield \nconsequences.\n\nIran was increasingly slipping into a state of isolation. China and Russia -- typically antagonists to the notion of \nincreased pressure on that country -- seemed to be distancing themselves from Iran.  China was reportedly seeking \nalternative sources of oil, while Russia wwas expressing \"regret\" over Tehran's decision to start work at the new \nFordow uranium enrichment plant near Qom.  Russia went further by saying that Iran should commence \"serious \nnegotiations \u2026 without preconditions\" or face the reality of consequences.\n\nIt should be noted that on Jan. 5, 2012, the United States (U.S.)  Pentagon announced that the U.S. Navy rescued \n13 Iranian fishermen being held by pirates in the Arabian Sea. According to the Pentagon, the U.S. Navy responded \nto a  distress call from an Iranian fishing vessel, which had been boarded by pirates several weeks prior. The U.S. \nNavy was able to apprehend 15 suspected pirates on that fishing vessel and release the Iranian fishermen whom \nthe Pentagon described as having been held hostage under harsh conditions.  A spokesperson for the U.S. Navy \nsaid that after the rescue of the Iranian fishermen,  navy personnel went out of their way to treat the fishing crew \n\"with kindness and respect.\"\n\nThe incident occurred at a time when tensions between Iran and the West were elevated.  Several Western \ncountries had recently indicated their intent to impose further sanctions on Iran's oil and financial sectors, for the \npurpose of registering discontent over that country's continued nuclear ambitions. Iran warned that it might retaliate \nagainst international pressure by closing the Strait of Hormuz through which a significant amount of oil is \ntransported.\n\nOnly days after the U.S. Navy rescued the Iranian fishermen (as discussed here), the Iranian Revolutionary Court \nsentenced an American national of Iranian descent to  death sentence for spying in behalf of the United States spy \nagency, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The family of Amir Mirzai Hekmati said that he was in Iran to visit his \ngrandparents; however, the Iranian authorities claimed that Hekmati was guilty of  \"co-operating with a hostile \nnation,\" \"holding membership in the CIA,\" and \"trying to implicate Iran in terrorism.\"  For his part, Hekmati -- who \nhad served in the Marines as an Arabic translator -- was shown on television admitting that he had been sent to Iran \nby the CIA and was tasked with infiltrate Iran's intelligence agencies.  Of course, the United States Department of \nState has asserted that Hekmati's so-called confession was likely coerced and that the U.S. citizen had been falsely \naccused.\n\nHekmati would have the opportunity to appeal his sentence; it was yet to be seen if Iranian authorities were willing \nto damage already-hostile bilateral relations with the United States by executing a U.S. citizen.  Such a move would \nnot help Iran in the public relations game on the international scene, given the fact that the U.S. Navy had rescued \nthe aforementioned Iranian fishermen from pirates.\n\nAs discussed above, Iran's controversial nuclear program returned to the international spotlight in January 2012 \nwhen  a nuclear scientist working at Iran's Natanz uranium enrichment plant was killed in a car bomb attack.  The \nmagnetic bomb was reportedly attached to to the vehicle carrying the nuclear scientist by  a motorcycle rider.  \nIranian officials wasted no time in blaming Israel for the death of Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, which they said was \nquite similar to the killings of other Iranian nuclear scientists. There was no immediate response from Israeli officials \nas to this allegation.  That being said, the French newspaper, Le Figaro,  has reported that the Israeli Mossad has \nbeen training Iranian dissidents in Iraqi Kurdistan to destabilize the Iranian regime.  There was no actual evidence \nthat Israeli-trained Iranians  were behind the assassination of Roshan in Tehran;  however, Israeli Mossad's hand \nhas been suspected in a number of targeted killings of Iranian nuclear scientists, effectively fueling speculation \nabout a covert effort to undermine Iran's nuclear program. Meanwhile, United States Secretary of State Hillary \nClinton vociferously denied her country's involvement in the incident.\n\nAs discussed above, the missile launches, the nuclear development news, the  sanctions, the threats regarding the \nclosure of the Strait of Hormuz,  and the targeted assassination of an Iranian nuclear scientist, collectively raised \n\n\n\nthe stakes in a burgeoning confrontation between  Iran and the wider international community.  As January 2012 \nwas coming to a close, attention was on the question of what form that confrontation would take.\n\nSpecial Report: Iran's nuclear program in global context\n\nNuclear development, assassination, and brinkmanship at Strait of Hormuz\n\nAt the close of 2011, according to reports via the state-run media, Iran successfully test-fired a medium-range \nsurface-to-air missile during military exercises in the Persian Gulf.\n\nIranian naval commander Mahmoud Mousavi lauded the operation, noting the missile was equipped with the \"latest \ntechnology\" and \"intelligent systems.\"  Mousavi also noted that further missile launches would be carried out in the \nnear future as part of Iran's  naval exercises in international waters close to the strategic Strait of Hormuz.\n\nOn Jan. 2, 2012 --  one day after testing a medium-range missile --  Iran reportedly test-fired long-range missiles in \nthe Persian Gulf.  Making good on his previously-made vow that Iran would continue this path, Mousavi said on \nbehalf of the Iranian government, \"We have test fired a long-range shore-to-sea missile called Qader, which \nmanaged to successfully destroy predetermined targets in the gulf.\"\n\nThis news by Mousavi was followed by a disclosure by the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization that its scientists \n\"tested the first nuclear fuel rod produced from uranium ore deposits inside the country.\"  As well, the IAEA was \nsoon noting that uranium enrichment had begun at the Fordow underground site near Qom.  Indeed, the uranium at \nthe Fordow site was reportedly being enriched to 20 percent -- a distinctly higher level than the 3.5 percent needed \nfor nuclear plants. These disclosures served only to bolster Western fears that Iran has made important progress in \nits nuclear development, augmenting anxieties that Iran's ultimate ambition is to  enrich uranium at the 90 percent \nlevel necessary to create a nuclear bomb.\n\nIt should be noted that these revelations from Iran came after  several Western countries indicated their intent to \nimpose further sanctions on Iran's oil and financial sectors, for the purpose of registering  discontent over that \ncountry's continued nuclear ambitions.  Indeed, the United States wasted no time in taking action and on Dec. 31, \n2011, President  Barack Obama signed legislation authorizing a package of sanctions on  Iran's central bank and \nfinancial sector.  These new sanctions by the United States aimed to intensify the pressure on Iran's oil sales, most \nof which are processed by the central bank. Essentially, they would force multinational companies to choose \nwhether to do business with Iran or the United States.  Perhaps not surprisingly, the Iranian currency -- the rial -- \nslipped in value to a record low as a result of the news.\n\nFor its part, Iran has warned that it might retaliate against international pressure by closing the Strait of Hormuz \nthrough which a significant amount of oil is transported.  Indeed, Iranian Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi \npromised that \"not a drop of oil will pass through the Strait of Hormuz\" if further sanctions were imposed.  That \nbeing said, analysts have noted that such a drastic step by Iran might serve primarily to hurt the Iranian economy, \nand imperil relations with Russia and China.  Accordingly, the threat was being regarded with skepticism.\n\nMoreover, United States Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta warned that a closure of the strait would yield \nconsequences.  Specifically, Defense Secretary Panetta said  the United States  would \"not tolerate\" the blocking \nof the Strait of Hormuz, and warned that was a \"red line\" for his country, to which there would be a response.\n\nIran was increasingly slipping into a state of isolation. China and Russia -- typically antagonists to the notion of \nincreased pressure on that country -- seemed to be distancing themselves from Iran.  China was reportedly seeking \nalternative sources of oil, while Russia was expressing \"regret\" over Tehran's decision to start work at the new \nFordow uranium enrichment plant near Qom.  Russia went further by saying that Iran should commence \"serious \nnegotiations \u2026 without preconditions\" or face the reality of consequences.\n\nIran's controversial nuclear program continued to dominate the international landscape well into the second week of \nJanuary 2012 when an apparent  nuclear scientist working at Iran's Natanz uranium enrichment plant was killed in a \n\n\n\ncar bomb attack.  The magnetic bomb was reportedly attached to  the vehicle carrying the nuclear scientist by  a \nmotorcycle rider.  According to the Sharif University in Tehran, Roshan, a chemistry expert, graduated from that \ninstitution and was working as the deputy in charge of commerce at the Natanz site.  The actual attack ensued \noutside the campus of Allameh Tabatai University, where Roshan was a lecturer.\n\nIranian officials wasted no time in blaming Israel for the death of Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, which they said was \nquite similar to the killings of other Iranian nuclear scientists. Tehran province Gov. Safar Ali Bratloo said in an \ninterview with the media, \"The responsibility of this explosion falls on the Zionist regime. The method of this terrorist \naction is similar to previous actions that targeted Iran's nuclear scientists.\" Joining the chorus, Iran's First Vice \nPresident Mohammad-Reza Rahimi accused Israeli agents of being the perpetrators of Roshan's assassination.\n\nThere was no immediate response from Israeli officials as to this allegation.  That being said, the French \nnewspaper, Le Figaro,  has reported that the Israeli Mossad has been training Iranian dissidents in Iraqi Kurdistan \nto destabilize the Iranian regime.  There was no actual evidence that Israeli-trained Iranians  were behind the \nassassination of Roshan in Tehran;  however, Israeli Mossad's hand has been suspected in a number of targeted \nkillings of Iranian nuclear scientists, effectively fueling speculation about a covert effort to undermine Iran's nuclear \nprogram. Moreover,  Patrick Clawson of the Iran Security Initiative at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy \nnoted that such covert efforts  were preferable to a more direct military response.  In an interview with the New York \nTimes, he said, \"Sabotage and assassination is the way to go, if you can do it. It doesn't provoke a nationalist \nreaction in Iran, which could strengthen the regime. And it allows Iran to climb down if it decides the cost of \npursuing a nuclear weapon is too high.\"\n\nMeanwhile, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was vociferously denying her country's involvement in \nthe incident. During a media briefing, the United States' top diplomat said, \"I want to categorically deny any United \nStates involvement in any kind of act of violence inside Iran.\"  But Secretary of State Clinton discussed other \nissues related to Iran's relationship with the wider world.  She drew attention to Iran's recent missile launches and \nnuclear development activities, strongly demanding that Iran \"end its provocative behavior, end its search for \nnuclear weapons, and rejoin the international community and be a productive member of it.\"  Additionally, she \ndiscussed Iran's threat to close the critically-important Straits of Hormuz, saying, \"It's part of the lifeline that keeps \noil and gas moving around the world. And it's also important to speak as clearly as we can to the Iranians about the \ndangers of this kind of provocation.\"\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the Obama administration in the United States reportedly dispatched a message \nvia alternative communications channels to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  warning him that the \nclosure of the Strait of Hormuz would not be tolerated.  In a separate report on CBS News, the United States Joint \nChiefs of Staff Chairman General Martin Dempsey appeared to underline the potential response by his country, \nsaying that the United States would \"take action and re-open the strait.\"  Of course, the general consensus was that \nthe re-opening of the Strait of Hormuz  could only be achieved  by military means.\n\nRecent Developments: Confrontation or Negotiation?\n\nClearly, the missile launch, the nuclear development news, the  sanctions, the threats regarding the closure of the \nStrait of Hormuz,  and the targeted assassination of an Iranian nuclear scientist, collectively raised the stakes in a \nburgeoning confrontation between  Iran and the wider international community.  As January 2012 was coming to a \nclose, attention was on the question of what form that confrontation would take.\n\nGoing the route of \"soft power\" rather than military might, the West wasted no time in intensifying the sanctions \nregime against Iran in a bid to place pressure on the Islamic Republic's regime to curtail its controversial nuclear \ndevelopment moves. Specifically, the European Union was imposing a phased ban on oil purchases from Iran, \nwhile the United States was expanding its sanctions on Iran's banking sector.\n\nAccording to a statement issued in Belgium,  the countries of the European Union would not sign on to new oil \ncontracts with Iran and would terminate any existing contracts by mid-2012.  Since the European market has made \nup a full fifth of Iran's oil exports, this sweeping oil embargo would constitute a crushing blow.  Making matters \n\n\n\nworse for Iran was the news that the European Union would also  freeze the assets of the Iranian Central Bank and \nit would prohibit transactions involving Iranian diamonds, gold, and precious metals.\n\nExpressing marked disapproval for Tehran's lack of transparency regarding its nuclear program, British Prime \nMinister David Cameron, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Iran \nhad \"failed to restore international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear program.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the United States' harsh sanctions regime  against Iran would become even more targeted as it focused \non the Bank Tejarat for its alleged role in (1) financing Iran's nuclear program,  and  (2) helping other banks evade \ninternational sanctions. In December 2011, United States President Barack Obama ordered a prohibition on any \ninvolvement with Iran's central bank. Now, a month later, the United States Treasury  was asserting that the new \nsanctions against Bank Tejarat would target \"one of Iran's few remaining access points to the international financial \nsystem.\"\n\nAlready diplomatically-isolated, Iran was  now well on its way to being seriously financially isolated in the global \nmarketplace. As noted by the United States Treasury Undersecretary for Terrorism David Cohen, \"The new round \nof sanctions will deepen Iran's financial isolation, make its access to hard currency even more tenuous and further \nimpair Iran's ability to finance its illicit nuclear program.\"  Indeed, the rial -- Iran's currency -- was being deleteriously \naffected as it underwent a massive downward slide in value.\n\nIn apparent reaction to the measures by the United States and the European Union, Tehran  again threatened to \nclose the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nThe level of brinkmanship reached new heights as the United States Ambassador to NATO, Ivo Daalder, promised \nthat his country and its allies would use any necessary measures to ensure that the crucial marine thoroughfare to \nthe Persian Gulf remained open. In an interview with BBC News, Daalder said the Strait of Hormuz  \"needs to \nremain open and we need to maintain this as an international passageway.  We will do what needs to be done to \nensure that is the case.\"  He continued, \"Of this I am certain -- the international waterways that go through the Strait \nof Hormuz are to be sailed by international navies, including ours, the British and the French and any other navy \nthat needs to go through the Gulf. And second, we will make sure that that happens under every circumstance.\"\n\nDaalder did not foreclose the possibility of a diplomatic solution, saying that the countries of the West stood \"ready \nat any time to sit down and have a serious conversation with [Iran] to resolve this [nuclear] issue with negotiations.\"\n\nJust days after the war of words was being ratcheted upward, Iranian  President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad declared \nthat Tehran was prepared  to return to negotiating table as regards its nuclear program.  On Jan. 26, 2012, \nAhmadinejad said  he was open to the idea of reviving multilateral talks in order to show that Iran remained \ninterested in dialogue. At the start of 2011, negotiations between Iran and a cadre of six nations (the five permanent \nmembers of the United Nations Security Council -- the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia and \nChina) as well as Germany -- ended in stalemate. Indeed, those talks were marked by Iran's refusal to engage in \nany meaningful dialogue regarding its nuclear program.  Now, a year later, Ahmadinejad  said on state-run Iranian \ntelevision, \"They have this excuse that Iran is dodging negotiations while it is not the case. Why should we run \naway from the negotiations?\"\n\nThere was some suggestion that Iran's interest in a return to the negotiating table might be a sign that international \npressure was taking a toll.  That being said, Ahmadinejad's words could just as easily be interpreted as a symbolic \ngesture by a figure head intent on rallying national sentiment.  To that end, Ahmadinejad suggested the West was \nresponsible for the collapse of negotiations to date, saying. \"It is the West that needs Iran and the Iranian nation will \nnot lose from the sanctions. It is you who come up with excuses each time and issue resolutions on the verge of \ntalks so that negotiations collapse.\"\n\nNote that as January 2012 came to a close, inspectors from the IAEA arrived in Iran for a visit to determine the \npurpose of that country's nuclear development program. Yukiya Amano, the head of the IAEA, expressed hope that \nthe \"outstanding issues\" regarding Iran's nuclear development would be resolved.  Meanwhile, just before \ndeparting for Iran, IAEA Deputy Director General Herman Nackaerts said, \"In particular we hope that Iran will \n\n\n\nengage with us on our concerns regarding the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program.\"  For its part, \nIran said the inspection would finally prove that Iran's nuclear ambitions were peaceful.\n\nUpdate: International Pressure\n\nAs February 2012 began, Israel entered the Iranian nuclear fray.  Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak indicated that \nif sanctions against Iran did not serve to curtail that country's nuclear development, then his country would be \nwilling to consider military action against Iran, before it could become a global threat. Barak said, \"Should sanctions \nfail to stop Iran's nuclear program, there will be a need to consider taking action.\" Barak continued, \"There is \nwidespread international belief that it is vital to prevent Iran from turning nuclear and that no option should be taken \noff the table.\"  As regards the prospects of Iran \"turning nuclear,\"  Israel's director of military intelligence, Major \nGeneral Aviv Kochavi warned that Iran was close to being able  to produce nuclear bombs.\n\nIt should be noted that United States Defense Secretary Leon Panetta expressed the view that Israel could very \nwell strike Iran in the spring of 2012 -- citing a timeline of April through June.  Panetta was cited in an article written \nby the Washington Post columnist David Ignatius, which suggested that Israel sought to hit Iran's nuclear targets \nbefore that country entered a \"zone of immunity\" in the effort to build a nuclear bomb. The article noted that the \nUnited States was opposed to such an attack, noting that it would imperil an increasingly successful non-military \neffort to isolate Iran, including the imposition of a harsh international economic sanctions program.  Indeed, the \nObama administration in the United States was reportedly worried about the \"unintended consequences\" of military \naction by Israel.\n\nFor its part, Iran had already said it was undeterred by either sanctions or threats of military action.  Iranian Oil \nMinister Rostam Qassemi said  the country would continue with its nuclear agenda regardless of pressure from \nforeign countries.  At a news conference, he said, \"We will not give up our righteous stance.\" Qassemi also  was \nunconcerned about the notion of oil embargoes, even threatening to cut oil exports to certain countries -- \npresumably ones participating in any pressuring actions against Tehran.\n\nAs well, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei had earlier claimed that Iran was actually benefiting from \nWestern sanctions. He insisted that the sanctions were helping his country to grow domestically, and said that war \nwould only hurt the United States and other Western countries.  Moreover, Khamenei issued a disturbing warning \nthat Iran had its own \"threats to make, which will be made in its due time.\" It was not known if those future threats \nwould be of a military nature although Iran began military drills on Feb. 5, 2012.  At that time, Iran's military made \nclear that it would react quickly to any military attack  from an external power on its interests.\n\nBy Feb. 6, 2012, United States President Barack Obama announced the imposition of  new sanctions against Iran's \nbanks, including its central bank, the Iranian government, and  all other Iranian financial institutions. In a letter to \nCongress detailing his executive order, President Obama wrote: \"I have determined that additional sanctions are \nwarranted, particularly in light of the deceptive practices of the Central Bank of Iran and other Iranian banks to \nconceal transactions of sanctioned parties, the deficiencies in Iran's anti-money laundering regime and the \nweaknesses in its implementation, and the continuing and unacceptable risk posed to the international financial \nsystem by Iran's activities.\"  As before, the United States was hoping that the even stricter sanctions regime would \nfurther isolate Iran.\n\nPresident Obama also made it clear that the United States would stand in solidarity with Israel to prevent Iran from \nbecoming a nuclear power. In an interview with the NBC news, President Obama said the United States and Israel \nwould work \"in lockstep\" to deal with the Iranian nuclear issue. \"I will say that we have closer military and \nintelligence consultation between our two countries than we've ever had.\"  President Obama also emphasized that \nwhile his objective was to resolve the nuclear standoff diplomatically, he was not taking any options off the table.\n\nOf course, as noted above, the United States has sought to discourage Israel from going down the military route.  \nThis stance was emphasized on Feb. 19, 2012 when Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the United States Joint \nChiefs of Staff, said in an interview with CNN that  his country viewed a military strike on Iran by Israel as \"not \nprudent.\" Dempsey noted that United States officials were attempting to move Israel away from that path saying, \n\"That's been our counsel to our allies, the Israelis.\"  He continued, \"I'm confident that they [the Irsaelis] understand \n\n\n\nour concerns that a strike at this point would be destabilizing and wouldn't achieve their long-term objectives.\"  That \nsaid,  Dempsey had no illusions about the effectiveness of this argument as he noted: \"I wouldn't suggest, sitting \nhere today, that we've persuaded them that our view is the correct view.  Nevertheless, Dempsey suggested that \nIran was  \"a rational actor\" and \"the current path [re: diplomacy and sanctions] that we're on is the most prudent at \nthis point.\"\n\nThe \"soft power\" of crippling sanctions has, in fact, been yielding results. According to a report by Reuters, Iran was \nfinding it difficult to purchase staples such as rice and cooking oil, which  are needed to feed its population.  For \nexample, Malaysian exporters of palm oil stopped sales to Iran because they could not receive payment.  Likewise, \nthere were reports that Iran had defaulted on payments for rice from India -- its main  supplier.  As well, shipments \nof maize from Ukraine had apparently been cut in half. Meanwhile, the price of basic food was exponentially \nescalating. Meanwhile, countries around the world that previously did business with Iran, such as South Korea, \nwere looking for alternative sources of oil.  As well, multinational corporations based in Europe were suspending \ndeals with Iran due to the new European Union sanctions.\n\nPerhaps more detrimental for Iran were obstacles in  selling its oil and receiving payments for its oil  exports. In \nplaces where Iran is still able to sell oil, it has been stymied from receipt of funds due to prevailing sanctions, \nespecially those levied by the United States.  And in another twist, if Iran cannot sell its typical  2.6 million barrels of \noil a day, or, it it must  sell those barrels at deep discounts, the decreased revenue will inevitably have a debilitating \neffect on the Iranian economy, adding to the possibility of social unrest.\n\nThese findings from international commodities traders, which were part of a Reuters investigation, indicated real \ndisruptions to Iran and flew in the face of claims from Tehran that sanctions were having no effect.\n\nNote that the Iranian regime on Feb. 19, 2012 said that it would halt oil sales to British and French companies, \nsaying that it would instead sell oil to new customers.  But with prevailing European Union sanctions set to go into \neffect, this news was unlikely to strongly affect France, which only bought three percent of is oil from Iran the \nprevious year anyway, or the United Kingdom, which imported even less Iranian oil. As discussed here, it was Iran \nthat was more likely to be affected negatively by curtailed oil sales.\n\nIran promises big nuclear announcement and possible military action\n\nNote that on Feb. 11, 2012,  during a rally marking the 33rd anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, Iranian President \nMahmoud Ahmadinejad said his country would unveil \"major achievements in the nuclear domain.\"\n\nHe said, \"Today, you see that the Iranian nation has become nuclear and can supply many of its demands. And \nGod-willing, in next few days, the whole world will witness the inauguration of several major achievements in the \nnuclear domain.\"  On a televised broadcast days later, the Iranian president declared that his country had \ndeveloped \"advanced nuclear centrifuges,\" and that scientists had inserted nuclear fuel rods into Tehran's reactor \nthat were  enriched to 20 percent. Ahmadinejad also defiantly made clear that Iran had no intention of halting its \nuranium enrichment program.\n\nThe West offered a symbolic yawn in response to Iran's nuclear announcement.  France and the United Kingdom \nissued pro forma statements of \"concern\" while the United States Department of State spokeswoman, Victoria \nNuland, dismissed the announcement as \"not terribly new and not terribly impressive.\"\n\nBut on Feb. 21, 2012, Iran was now taking a belligerent tone as regards the prospects of military action with an \nIranian military commander declaring that his country will take pre-emptive actions against enemies if its national \ninterests are threatened.  The deputy head of Iran's armed forces, Mohammad Hejazi, said in an interview with the \nIranian Fars news agency, \"Our strategy now is that if we feel our enemies want to endanger Iran's national \ninterests, and want to decide to do that, we will act without waiting for their actions.\" Since Iran's leadership has a \ntendency to assert the country's ability to crush perceived enemies, it was difficult to determine if this statement \nshould be regarded as the ratcheting up of rhetoric or a warning.\n\nIAEA visit to Iran ends in failure; reports increased uranium enrichment\n\n\n\nNote that in mid-February 2012, a delegation from the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) had arrived in \nIran for a second trip in less than a month  to attend talks on the country's nuclear program.  Officials from the \ninternational nuclear watchdog agency said that they hoped for a \"constructive visit.\"\n\nOn Feb. 24, 2102, however, the IAEA concluded that Iran was not cooperative and that prevailing questions \nregarding the possible military dimension of the Iranian nuclear development program remained unanswered. Of \nparticular concern was the fact that  the IAEA was prohibited by the Iranian authorities from visiting the Parchin \nnuclear site, to the south of Tehran, where suspected military capability was being developed. Clearly, the refusal to \nallow IAEA delegates from entering the Parchin site would do nothing to alleviate suspicions about Iran's military \nnuclear ambitions.\n\nMoreover, leaked elements from the IAEA report noted that Iran increased the number of centrifuges used to enrich \nuranium and intensified the  production of uranium enriched to the higher level of 20 percent. Leaked information \nfrom that report also indicated that Iran stepped up its uranium enrichment at main nuclear plant at Natanz, as well \nas at the underground site of Fordo.  It should be noted that the Fordo plant, which is constructed under a \nmountain, would be almost impossible to damage in a potential military strike by Israel or the United States.\n\nAccordingly, the IAEA declared the following: \"As Iran is not providing the necessary co-operation... the agency is \nunable to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran. The \nagency continues to have serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program.\"\n\nOverall, the findings from the IAEA would likely serve only to underline existing suspicions by the West that Iran \nheld ambitions to build a nuclear bomb.\n\nFor its part, Iran insisted that the country was, in fact, cooperating with the IAEA, while simultaneously defending \nIran's right to a nuclear development program.  Iran was also insisting -- as before -- that it was not pursuing a \nnuclear weapon.  Speaking at the international Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar \nSalehi argued, \"We do not see any glory, pride or power in the nuclear weapons -- quite the opposite... The \nproduction, possession, use, or threat of use of nuclear weapons is illegitimate, futile, harmful, dangerous and \nprohibited as a great sin.\"  On the other side of the equation, the United States envoy at the conference, Laura  \nKennedy, responded saying Iran's expressed commitment to peaceful nuclear development stood \"in sharp \ncontrast\"  to its failure to comply with international obligations.\n\nEditor's Update on Iranian Nuclear Issue:\n\nAs February 2012 drew to an end, the six parties involved in nuclear negotiations with Iran -- the United States, the \nUnited Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China -- appeared to be ready to resume talks with Tehran.  The \ntalks stalled more than a year earlier and the return to the negotiating table was not being regarded with serious \noptimism.  That being said, even without high hopes for a breakthrough, all six countries agreed that all peaceful \navenues should be explored, in order to minimize the possibility of a new conflict in the Middle East.\n\nIn an interview with The Atlantic magazine published  at the start of March 2012, President Obama issued a double \nwarning -- to Iran and to Israel respectively.  He said that he was not bluffing about a possible attack on Iran,  if it \nbuilds a nuclear weapon, while also cautioning Israel that a premature attack on Iran would be more harmful than \nhelpful to global security.\n\nAs stated by the United States leader: \"I think that the Israeli government recognizes that, as president of the \nUnited States, I don't bluff. I also don't, as a matter of sound policy, go around advertising exactly what our \nintentions are. But (both) governments recognize that when the United States says it is unacceptable for Iran to \nhave a nuclear weapon, we mean what we say.\"\n\nFor his part, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seemed  impatient about the path of diplomacy and \nsanctions, and emphasized his country's right to defend itself -- presumably in the form of targeted strikes against \nIranian nuclear facilities.  He said,  \"Israel must reserve the right to defend itself, and after all, that's the very \npurpose of the Jewish state: to restore to the Jewish people control over our destiny.\"\n\n\n\nOn March 5, 2012, in response to accusations by Republican rivals that he would allow Iran to become armed with \nnuclear bombs, United States President Obama cautioned against the rush the war.  Addressing the American \nIsrael Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) lobbying group, the American president disparaged Republicans' pro-war \n[on Iran] rhetoric saying, \"Already, there is too much loose talk of war.\" He continued, \"Over the last few weeks, \nsuch talk has only benefited the Iranian government, by driving up the price of oil, which they depend on to fund \ntheir nuclear program. For the sake of Israel's security, America's security, and the peace and security of the world, \nnow is not the time for bluster.\"  Outlining his own \"soft power with a sharp edge\" foreign policy, President Obama \nsaid, \"Now is the time to let our increased pressure sink in, and to sustain the broad international coalition we have \nbuilt. Now is the time to heed the timeless advice from Teddy Roosevelt -- speak softly; carry a big stick.\"\n\nA day later at a press conference, President Obama made clear that his stance regarding Iran's nuclear program \nwas not one of containment but rather one of prevention.  He said, \"We will not countenance Iran getting a nuclear \nweapon,\" the president told reporters. At the same time, the president was not willing to abandon the diplomatic \ntrack saying,  \"At this stage, it is my belief that we have a window of opportunity that this still can be resolved \ndiplomatically.\"\n\nOn March 8, 2012,  Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei appeared to welcome President Obama's observation that the \n\"window\" for diplomacy remained open.  Iran's supreme leader characterized the American president's statement \nas follows: \"These words are good words and are a sign of no longer being in delusion.\"  Still, Khamenei criticized \nthe sanctions regime being levied against Iran.  The White House was undeterred from its path. White House Press \nSecretary  Jay Carney said, \"The president's policy towards Iran is focused in a very clear-eyed way on behavior \nrather than rhetoric... The pressure on Iran will continue. The ratcheting up of sanctions will continue.\"\n\nIt should also be noted that only a day before, a report by the Associated Press appeared to indicate that Iran was \ntrying to clean up radioactive traces in the aftermath of possible tests of a nuclear weapons trigger. The report \ndisplayed satellite images of an Iranian military facility, with trucks and other vehicles at the site, quite possibly \nengaged in such clean up or sanitization activities. There were also references to claims by diplomats that crews at \nthe Parchin military site could be trying to erase evidence of tests of an experimental neutron device used to set off \nnuclear explosions.  Of course, a  neutron initiator would only be used in the development of  nuclear arms. At the \nsame time, it was possible that radioactive traces could also be left by material other than a neutron initiator -- for \nexample, uranium metal used as  a substitute for testing purposes.\n\nThese findings came to light even as Iran indicated it would allow international inspectors to visit a key military base \nin Parchin, which the IAEA believes may be involved in a nuclear weapons program. The pictures could plausibly \nboost the theory that the Iranians were trying to hide evidence of their nuclear progam in anticipation of that visit.\n\nNote that in late March 2012, nuclear politics were at the forefront of the international purview when world leaders \ngathered at the Nuclear Security Summit.\n\nThere, United States President Barack Obama reiterated his call for  \"a world without nuclear weapons\" and \nadvanced his foreign policy agenda that advocates  non-proliferation and the reduction of  nuclear weapons through \nincreased diplomacy.\n\nIn a speech to students at Hankuk University, President Obama said that the United States -- the only nation to \nhave ever used nuclear weapons -- was fully committed to  reducing its stockpile of nuclear arms.  President \nObama also drew thunderous applause from the audience of students when he said that, as a father, he did not \nwish to see his daughters growing up in a world with nuclear threats. President Obama acknowledged his country's \nunique position in the world, but he noted that \"serious sustained global effort\" was needed to achieve his \nexpressed hope for a nuclear weapons-free world.\n\nThe issue of nuclear proliferation has been at the forefront of the international purview given the ongoing concerns \nabout North Korea's nuclear arsenal as well as Iran's nuclear ambitions.  To that latter end, President Obama was \nexpected to meet with Russia's outgoing President Dmitry Medvedev on the matter of Iran's nuclear program -- an \nissue that has not always seen progress due to divisions among countries with veto power on the United Nations \n\n\n\nSecurity Council. With an eye on working cooperatively with such countries, President Obama pledged to work with \nRussia and China at reducing the risk of nuclear terrorism.\n\nPresident Obama addressed the issue of Iran's controversial nuclear development program, saying that time \nremained to resolve the deadlock through diplomacy.  \"But time is short,\" said President Obama. \"Iran must act with \nthe seriousness and sense of urgency that this moment demands,\" he continued.\n\nFor its part, Iran has insisted that it has the right to develop nuclear development for peaceful civilian purposes.  On \nthe other side of the equation, the West has asserted that Iran is seeking  to build nuclear weapons via its \nclandestine nuclear arms development program.  While Iran has been subject to sanctions as a result of its failure \nto fulfill its international obligations, international concurrence has not come easily due to objections from China and \nRussia.  However, President Obama was making it clear that he intended to work with these two countries as he \nstated: \"Today, I'll meet with the leaders of Russia and China as we work to achieve a resolution in which Iran fulfills \nits obligations.\"\n\nAs March 2012 drew to a close, President Obama was clearing the way to tighten sanctions against Iran.  \nSuggesting that there was enough oil on the world market to  allow countries to withstand the loss of some Iranian \noil, President Obama moved to ramp up sanctions against Iran that would penalize foreign entities that purchase oil \nfrom Iran's central bank, which collects payment for most of the country's energy exports. This move was intended \nto pressure Iran to halt its nuclear program.\n\nIn  April 2012, global concerns over the prospects of Iran developing a nuclear weapon tamped down to some \ndegree.  At issue was a claim by the head of the Israeli military that  Iran was not yet committed to the path of \ndeveloping nuclear weapons.  In an interview with the Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, Chief of Staff Lieutenant General \nBenny Gantz said he did not believe Iran would necessarily develop nuclear weapons. He said Iran's Supreme \nLeader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had not yet made a final decision whether to build a nuclear bomb.\n\nWhile Gantz acknowledged that Iran was moving \"step by step to the place where it will be able to decide whether \nto manufacture a nuclear bomb,\" he expressed the view that the Iranian regime \"hasn't yet decided to go the extra \nmile.\" Gantz additionally said the following of Ayatollah Khamenei and the Iranian power brokers: \"I don't think he \nwill want to go the extra mile. I think the Iranian leadership is composed of very rational people.\"  But Gantz also \nwarned that a decision of some sort in the offing. He said, \"Either Iran takes its nuclear program to a civilian footing \nonly, or the world -- perhaps we too -- will have to do something. We're closer to the end of discussions than the \nmiddle.\"\n\nThis tempered view was a far cry from the rhetoric to date that Iran has been intent on a plan to develop weapons \nas part of its nuclear technology program.  Those fears by leading members of the international community have \nonly been accentuated by Iran's failure to abide by international agreements regarding the monitoring of its nuclear \ndevelopment activities.  Indeed, in late 2011, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) published a report \nwhich noted the fact that it was unable to \"provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear \nmaterial and activities in Iran.\" The IAEA report also warned that  it continued to have \"serious concerns regarding \npossible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program.\"\n\nMore recently in February 2012, the IAEA concluded that Iran was not cooperative and that prevailing questions \nregarding the possible military dimension of the Iranian nuclear development program remained unanswered. Of \nparticular concern was the fact that  the IAEA was prohibited by the Iranian authorities from visiting the Parchin \nnuclear site, to the south of Tehran, where suspected military capability was being developed. Clearly, the refusal to \nallow IAEA delegates from entering the Parchin site would do nothing to alleviate suspicions about Iran's military \nnuclear ambitions. Moreover, leaked elements from the IAEA report noted that Iran increased the number of \ncentrifuges used to enrich uranium and intensified the  production of uranium enriched to the higher level of 20 \npercent. Leaked information from that report also indicated that Iran stepped up its uranium enrichment at main \nnuclear plant at Natanz, as well as at the underground site of Fordo.  It should be noted that the Fordo plant, which \n\n\n\nis constructed under a mountain, would be almost impossible to damage in a potential military strike by Israel or the \nUnited States.\n\nAccordingly, the IAEA declared the following: \"As Iran is not providing the necessary co-operation... the agency is \nunable to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran. The \nagency continues to have serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program.\" \nOverall, the findings from the IAEA would likely serve only to underline existing suspicions by the West that Iran \nheld ambitions to build a nuclear bomb.\n\nTo date, Iran's continued non-compliance with nuclear monitoring has led to the imposition of sanctions by the \nUnited Nations, as well as by individual countries including the United States,  Canada, Japan, Australia, as well as \nthe European Union. For his part,  Israeli military chief Gantz  appeared to be of the mind that international pressure \nwas yielding results.\n\nStill, not everyone in Israel was of the same view.  In an interview with CNN, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin \nNetanyahu  said that he would not want to bet \"the security of the world on Iran's rational behavior.\"  Moreover, \nNetanyahu made it clear that he was willing  to take action against Iran to stop it obtaining a nuclear weapon.  That \nbeing said, the nuanced differences between the words of Gantz and Netanyahu highlighted a growing divide in \nIsrael between political leaders and military/intelligence specialists over the wisdom of attacking Iran.  As such, the \noverall political and diplomatic climate had cooled from its previous level of heated turmoil.\n\nIt should be noted that around the same period (late April 2012), Iran made it clear that it would be returning to the \nnegotiating table  for a new round of talks with the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA. Talks were set for May \n13-14, 2012, in Austria.  Tehran said that its  decision to resume talks with the IAEA \"shows the peaceful nature of \nall of its nuclear activities, while showing that claims against Iran are baseless.\" A second round of talks  involving \nthe so-called \"six powers\" of the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany was scheduled to take \nplace in Iraq; a first round had already occurred in April 2012 in Turkey.\n\nIn late May 2012, six world powers met in Iraq to discuss Iran's controversial nuclear program and agreed to \ncontinue talks in Russia a month later.  At issue was the status of nuclear negotiations between Iran and the six \nparty group composed of  the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China.  The \ndiscussions were aimed at finding an agreement in which Iran would abandon its medium-level uranium enrichment \nprogram, while holding onto its peaceful nuclear program and reversing some of the damage yielded by \ninternational sanctions.\n\nIran's desire to end those crippling sanctions, in combination with the West's desire to see Iran end its nuclear \ndevelopment program, together created a political climate where negotiations were again attractive.  Of course, \nthere was only limited optimism that such talks would actually yield constructive results; however, there was enough \nof an incentive for all sides to re-enter the negotiating arena.  Stated differently, even without high hopes for a \nbreakthrough, the six countries agreed that all peaceful avenues should be explored, in order to minimize the \npossibility of a new conflict in the Middle East. .\n\nDuring these talks in Iraq,  sources from the European Union said that although \"significant differences\" remained, \nthere had been progress in forging common ground. The six world powers were reportedly  offering Iran a deal \naimed curbing uranium enrichment and allowing IAEA inspectors \"in country\" to verify that Iran's nuclear activity \nwas indeed for peaceful purposes.  The deal would include medical isotopes and co-operation on nuclear safety in \nexchange for the cessation of Iran's medium-enriched (20 percent) uranium enrichment program. Of course, even \nin the face of this offer, Iran was maintaining  its right to uranium enrichment.  Still, Iran was clearly seeking to end \nthe international sanctions campaign -- led by the Obama administration in the United States -- which has badly \ndamaged the Iranian economy.  While there was no immediate breakthrough, there was enough movement to \nnecessitate scheduling further talks in mid-June 2012 in the Russian capital of Moscow.\n\nAt the start of June 2012, satellite imagery emerged  showing  the destruction of buildings and removal of soil  at \nthe  Parchin military site in Iran -- a venue intended for monitoring by the United Nations\n\n\n\nnuclear watchdog agency. The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) posted the imagery on its \nwebsite and came in the aftermath of a meeting between the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  and \nWestern diplomats regarding the possibility of a nuclear clean-up effort at Parchin.  At a news conference, IAEA \nhead, Yukio Amano, said: \"The satellite imagery indicates that these activities include the use of water, demolishing \nof buildings, removing fences and moving soil.\"  He expressed concern that such activities would negatively affect \nthe IAEA's efforts to investigate the Parchin site.\n\nThe reports of Iran  trying to clean up radioactive traces appeared to be reinforced by satellite imagery showing the \ndestruction of buildings and removal of soil at Parchin. The revelations of apparent \"sanitization\" would likely \nreinforce doubts by the West that Iran has been acting in good faith as regards its nuclear program.  They would \nalso situate the Parchin military site at the core of the argument. Iran has insisted that Parchin is a conventional \nmilitary complex; however, the West has argued that it is the site of experiments, possibly aimed at developing \nnuclear bombs.\n\nThese developments occurred ahead of a new round of nuclear talks between the United Nations nuclear watchdog \nagency, the IAEA, and Iran. These talks were intended to advance the development of a framework for cooperation \nwith Iran, which Iranian authorities have said would be needed before allowing inspectors from the United Nations \nnuclear watchdog agency to visit Parchin.  But on June 8, 2012, the IAEA said that negotiations in Austria ended \nwithout progress having been made.  IAEA chief inspector Herman Nackaerts said the lack of progress at the talks \nin Vienna was \"disappointing.\" Iran's ambassador to the IAEA Ali Ashghar Soltanieh, offered a more sanguine view \nsaying: \"We are ready to remove all ambiguities and prove to the world that our activities are exclusively for \npeaceful purposes and none of these allegations [of developing a nuclear bomb] are true.\"  Of course, such \ndeclarations were unlikely to assuage the IAEA and the West, which would be more apt to view Iran's actions as \nillustrative of a country failing to act in good faith.\n\nMeanwhile, a separate set of negotiations were being held with the participation of  Iran and the so-called six \npowers --  the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China. The six world powers were \nreportedly  offering Iran a deal aimed curbing uranium enrichment and allowing IAEA inspectors \"in country\" to \nverify that Iran's nuclear activity was indeed for peaceful purposes.  The deal would include medical isotopes and \nco-operation on nuclear safety in exchange for the cessation of Iran's medium-enriched (20 percent) uranium \nenrichment program and Iran relinquishing its  stockpile of enriched uranium.\n\nThe first round of negotiations between Iran and the six powers  was held in May 2012.  During those May 2012 \nnegotiations, sources from the European Union said that although \"significant differences\" remained, there had \nbeen progress in forging common ground.  Even in the face of this offer, Iran maintained  its right to uranium \nenrichment.  Still, Iran was clearly seeking to end the international sanctions campaign -- led by the Obama \nadministration in the United States -- which has badly damaged the Iranian economy.  While there was no \nimmediate breakthrough, there was enough movement to necessitate scheduling further talks. Further negotiations \nwere due to be held in the Russian capital of Moscow later in June 2012.\n\nWhile talks to date have not yielded concrete results, Iran's desire to end the campaign of  crippling international \nsanctions, in combination with the West's desire to see Iran end its nuclear development program, together created \na political climate where negotiations could be attractive to all vested interests.\n\nOn June 18, 2012, after the most recent round of talks on Iran's nuclear program ended in the Russian capital city \nof Moscow without progress being made.  According to Russian negotiators, the talks yielded no breakthrough \nsince the differences between Iran and the six world powers remained irreconcilable. As reported by the Russian \nnews agency, Interfax, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said: \"The main stumbling block is that the \nsides' positions are rather difficult and tough to reconcile.\"\n\nAccording to Michael Mann, a spokesperson for the world powers, the discussions began in a positive manner with \nhigh hopes that Iran would seriously consider the proposals discussed above.  But as before, Iran was demanding \nthat the West lift its sanctions and that its \"non-negotiable\" right to enrich uranium  be recognized.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, amidst the various rounds of negotiations, June 2012 saw the New York Times feature an excerpt of \nthe book, \"Confront and Conceal: Obama's Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power,\" by David Sanger, \nwhich detailed the United States' cyber war against Iran. Cyber war was the \"smart power\" option available to the \nUnited States and its allies in preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, in contrast to the \"soft power\" \noption of sanctions or the \"hard power\" alternatives such as military strikes.\n\nThe alleged cyber war against Iran dated back to the previous Bush administration in the United States, with the \nhelp of Israel, in developing an effort  code-named Olympic Games.  Under the succeeding Obama administration \nthat cyber war program was preserved and even accelerated.  Indeed,  Sanger's book, which was based on \nanonymous American, European, and Israeli expert sources, suggested that the United States was being pushed \ninto new and uncharted territory. As noted by Sanger, the cyber war program was credited with \"achieving, with \ncomputer code, what until then could be accomplished only by bombing a country or sending in agents to plant \nexplosives.\"\n\nThe computer worm project was actually implanted in a clandestine manner using  undercover intelligence agents.  \nIt was intended to cause damage to Iranian centrifuges and reportedly accomplished that goal. However, President \nObama ordered more sophisticated computer attacks on Iran's main nuclear enrichment facilities in an expanded \nprogram of cyber war -- even after aspects of the program, known as the Stuxnet computer virus, were accidentally \nleaked into the public purview in mid-2010 as a result of a programming error.  Experts surmised that the cyber war \nprogram  set back Iran's nuclear program up to two years.  That being said, some sources suggest that Iran's \nenrichment levels are recovering, and thus could leave Iran with enough resources to yet develop nuclear \nweapons.  Of course, the question remains an open one as to whether or not Iran is actively pursuing this path.  \nTehran's continued intransigence in cooperating with the IAEA has done little to assuage the doubts of the West.\n\nSpecial Note on Bulgarian bombing; Israel blames Iran and Hezbollah\n\nOn July 18, 2012, eight people died and more than 30 others were injured when a bomb exploded at the Burgas \nairport in Bulgaria.  The victims included the Bulgarian bus driver and the suspected suicide bomber who carried out \nthe attack. The bombing appeared to target a bus carrying Israeli tourists in the Black Sea region of Bulgaria. \nSignificantly, the attack occurred on the 18th anniversary of a deadly attack on a Jewish community center in \nArgentina, raising the likelihood that the Bulgaria bombing was another instance of anti-Jewish terrorism by \nextremist elements.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasted little time in blaming Iran for the act of terrorism in a statement \nthat read: \"All the signs lead to Iran. Only in the past few months we have seen Iranian attempts to attack Israelis in \nThailand, India, Georgia, Kenya, Cyprus and other places.\" He additionally promised retaliation, asserting in the \nstatement, \"Murderous Iranian terror continues to hit innocent people. This is an Iranian terror attack that is \nspreading throughout the entire world. Israel will react forcefully to Iranian terror.\" A day later, Israeli Defense \nMinister Ehud Barak expanded on Netanyahu's claim that Iran was behind the act of terrorism, explaining that the \nLebanese Hezbollah was the direct perpetrator of the attack, but had been acting under the aegis  of Iran.  \nNetanyahu himself explained the connection using the following phrase: \"Hezbollah, the long arm of Iran.\"\n\nAnalysts were suggesting that the terror attack in Bulgaria was likely another manifestation of the covert  war \nbetween Israel and Iran.  To that end, there were intimations that the Bulgaria bombing might have been a \nretaliatory attack for the series of targeted strikes against  Iranian nuclear scientists.\n\nFor its part, Iran dismissed the accusation and expressed condemnation for \"all terrorist acts.\"  No statement, \nthough, came from Hezbollah.\n\nBy July 20, 2012, United States officials were suggesting that the suicide bomber on the bus in Bulgaria was a \nmember of Hezbollah.  According to the New York Times,  their sources did not wish to be identified as the \n\n\n\ninvestigation was under way, however, the suicide bomber was in Bulgaria on a mission to attack Israeli interests. \nThe New York Times' unnamed sources also observed that Hezbollah was being guided and sponsored by Iran in \nthis effort. Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov was on the record confirming that the suicide bomber had \nbeen \"in country\" for several days prior to the terror attack.\n\nParliamentary Elections of 2012\n\nParliamentary elections were set to be held in Iran on March 29, 2012.  At stake were the 290 seats in the \nunicameral \"Majlis-e-Shura e Eslami\" (Islamic Consultative Assembly).  Member are elected by popular vote from \nsingle-seat constituencies to serve four-year terms; all candidates must be approved by the \"Shura-e-Nigahban\" \n(Council of Guardians).\n\nThe last elections for the Majlis (parliament) of Iran were held on March 14, 2008.  The parties in contention for the  \navailable parliamentary seats were the Conservatives, the Reformists, the Independents, and other unnamed \ncontenders. With the votes counted on election day, it was clear that the Conservatives would retain control of \nparliament, as expected.\n\nThe Conservatives' strong showing was partially due to their performance in the Iranian capital of Tehran.  \nHowever, it should be noted that not all the Conservatives were pro-Ahmadinejad; in fact, a significant number of \nthem were viewed as critics of the president.  Despite the fact that many of their candidates were disqualified by the \nGuardian Council, the Reformists also had some reason to celebrate since they enjoyed a modest increase in \nparliamentary representation.  There were also some Independents who won representation in parliament. The \nmain outcome of the election was the fact that President  Ahmadinejad could be faced with a lack of cooperation in \nparliament.  This was  due to the parliamentary increase in the number of Reformists and critical  Conservatives.  \nWestern powers criticized the election as neither free nor fair and criticized the decision to disqualify many \nReformist candidates.\n\nAhead of the 2012 elections, and coming in the wake of the Arab Spring in the region, Iranian authorities were \nensuring that no strong voices for the opposition would be able to advocate for change.  Already, well-known \nopposition leader and activist, Mehdi Karroubi, who had come to the fore at the height of the reformist anti-\ngovernment uprising, known as the \"Green Revolution,\" following the contested presidential elections of 2009, had \ndisappeared.  It should be noted that the \"Green Revolution\" ended unsuccessfully with the deaths and \nincarceration of opposition activists, and a harsh crackdown by the theocratic and totalitarian Iranian authorities on \ndissent.\n\nIn 2011, according to the opposition website Kaleme, both Karroubi and the \"Green Revolution\" leader, Mir Hossein \nMousavi, were taken to the Heshmatiyeh prison in the capital city of Tehran. They were respectively detained after \ncalling on the Iranian people to once again take to the streets in demonstrations.  Clearly, in an effort to short-circuit \nany displays of anti-government dissent, the Iranian authorities wasted no time in incarcerating the two opposition \nicons, whom they have accused of treason and threatened with execution. Now, at the close of August 2011,  \nIranian and international human rights activists were expressing \"extreme concern\" over the welfare of Karroubi, \nwho had been missing for as many as six weeks.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Hadi Ghaemi, the director of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, said: \n\"We are extremely concerned for the health and well-being of Karroubi, who is 74 years old, and no one has heard \nfrom him for six weeks, not his wife, any family or associates.\"  Ghaemi also expressed fear that Karroubu was \nbeing subject to coercive \"brainwashing\" while in custody.\n\nNow in 2012 ahead of the parliamentary contests, Faezeh Hashemi, the daughter of former Iranian President Akbar \nHashemi Rafsanjani who backed opposition leader Mousavi after the 2009 post-election uprising, was sentenced to \nsix months in jail for propaganda against the state.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, former President Khatami said reformists would not bother to announce any candidates for the \nelections because \"the conditions for the reformists to participate were not met.\"  Khatami said that the conditions \nfor  reformists to participate in the elections would have to include the release of political prisoners  and the \nestablishment of a political transparent atmosphere.  Clearly, neither of those two conditions had any hope of being \nactualized.\n\nBy the close of February 2012 -- just days ahead of Iran's parliamentary elections -- Iranian  officials were urging  \nvoters to participate in the vote.  The Iranian authorities argued that strong voter turnout would be a blow to Iran's \nenemies -- particularly those seeking to block Iran's pursuit of nuclear development.  The call was a clear attempt to \nheighten national sentiment while excoriating the West.  Of course, as discussed here, regardless of the level of \nvoter turnout, the reality was that most of Iran's reformist opposition leaders were under arrest, and the reformist \nactivists were not bothering to contest the elections anyway.  Instead, voters would have a choice between a cadre \naligned with President Ahmadinejad and  those aligned with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  The vote \nwould, therefore, be something of a ratification of the status quo, effectively explaining the Iranian regime's \nenthusiasm for the notion of voting in these elections.\n\nBy the first week of March 2012, the official election results were announced . In line with expectations,  Iran's \nconservative hardliners won an overwhelming majority in the parliamentary elections.  Of course, as noted here,  \nthe real election fight was between loyalists of Khamenei and stalwarts of Ahmadinejad.  Given this context, the fact \nthat Iran's conservative hardliners won an overwhelming majority in the parliamentary elections was a matter of \ninterpretation.  Just whose conservative hardliners had won the most seats? In fact,  loyalists of  Khamenei won as \nmany as 70 percent of the seats at stake, effectively delivering the message that the reform movement was \ndormant in Iran, that President Ahmadinejad was to be regarded as a figurehead of sorts, and that the real base of \npolitical power in Iran resided with the Supreme Leader -- Ayatollah Khamenei.\n\nCould Iran's upgraded ballistic missile and increased nuclear development spur an Israeli strike?\n\nOn Aug. 21, 2012, Iran unveiled an upgraded version of a short range surface-to-surface ballistic missile.  Known \nas the Fateh-110, or Conqueror, it was intended to showcase Iran's military deterrence capabilities, according to \nIranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  The new ballistic missile reportedly enjoyed a more rapid  launch time, \ngreater longevity, and could be deployed during inclement weather conditions.\n\nDuring the unveiling ceremony for the Fateh-110, President Ahmadinejad said: \"We do not seek progress in the \ndefense industry for conquest. We want it to defend ourselves, our territory, our existence. Secondly, we want it for \ndefending human dignity.\"\n\nThe development in Iran would, no doubt, fuel speculation about Iran's controversial nuclear development program, \nits progress therein, and Israel's potential reaction to militarily thwart Iran's nuclear development.  The conventional \nwisdom as of August 2012 was that Israel was seriously considering such action, although no final decision had yet \nbeen made.  It was yet to be seen if the news of the new ballistic missile would influence Israeli powers as to their \nplan of action.\n\nIt should be noted the surface-to-surface Fateh-110 ballistic missile was not believed to possess the capability to \nlaunch a nuclear weapon, and thus was not to be regarded as part of the Iranian nuclear threat.  Specifically, as \nreported by BBC News, Iranian ballistic missiles were not believed to be large enough for conveying conventional \nweapons and lacked the accuracy to hit targets with precision or reliability.\n\nThat being said, by the end of the month, the Iranian nuclear threat resurfaced with International Atomic Energy \nAgency's (IAEA) report that Iran had doubled its nuclear development capacity at the Fordo nuclear site. According \nto the IAEA, there were now more than double the number of enrichment centrifuges at Fordo although new \n\n\n\nequipment was not yet functional.  The IAEA also said that Iran had \"significantly hampered\" its ability to inspect \nthe Parchin military site, which the nuclear watchdog agency said had been \"sanitized,\" presumably to obfuscate \nIranian nuclear activities.  Undoubtedly, this collective news would concern Israel, raising the specter of an Israeli \nstrike on Iranian nuclear facilities.  Of significance was the fact that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was \nset to address the United Nations General Assembly in September 2012 on the dangers of Iran's nuclear program.\n\nIsraeli PM wants \"red line\" on Iran over nuclear threat; Iran threatens retaliation for possible attack\n\nAs September 2012 began, the Iranian nuclear threat resurfaced with International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) \nreport that Iran had doubled its nuclear development capacity at the Fordo nuclear site. According to the IAEA, \nthere were now more than double the number of enrichment centrifuges at Fordo although new equipment was not \nyet functional.  The IAEA also said that Iran had \"significantly hampered\" its ability to inspect the Parchin military \nsite, which the nuclear watchdog agency said had been \"sanitized,\" presumably to obfuscate Iranian nuclear \nactivities.  Undoubtedly, this collective news would concern Israel, raising the specter of an Israeli strike on Iranian \nnuclear facilities.  Of significance was the fact that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was set to address \nthe United Nations General Assembly in September 2012 on the dangers of Iran's nuclear program.\n\nWith that gathering of the United Nations General Assembly in New York in the offing, Israeli Prime Minister \nattempted to schedule a meeting with United States President Barack Obama. Media reports indicated that \nNetanyahu said that he was prepared to travel to Washington D.C. to meet with President Obama.  The White \nHouse declined the meeting on the basis of the United States' leader schedule; it also drew attention to the fact that \nthere were no bilateral meetings scheduled for the United States president with any other leaders.  The White \nHouse also pointed to a meeting between Prime Minister Netanyahu with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .\n\nThe White House further noted that there was ongoing contact between President Obama and Prime Minister \nNetanyahu over a number of security issues, including the nuclear threat posed by Iran. In  statement, the  White \nHouse confirmed that President Obama had just spoken with President Netanyahu for an hour on Sept. 11, 2012.  \nThe statement included the following assertions: \"The two leaders discussed the threat posed by Iran's nuclear \nprogram, and our close cooperation on Iran and other security issues. President Obama and Prime Minister \nNetanyahu reaffirmed that they are united in their determination to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, \nand agreed to continue their close consultations going forward.\"\n\nNevertheless, Netanyahu's inability to secure a meeting with President Obama fueled speculation about poor \nrelations between the two men.  It was certainly possible that the White House was not in the mood to reward \nNetanyahu after he criticized the United States for not being tough enough on Iran over its nuclear program.  \nDuring  a news conference in Jerusalem with  Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov,  Netanyahu spoke of of the \ninternational community's reluctance to sanction a military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities.  He said, \"The \nworld tells Israel: wait, there's still time. And I say: wait for what? Wait until when?\" He continued, \"Those in the \ninternational community who refuse to put red lines before Iran don't have a moral right to place a red light before \nIsrael.\"  Prime Minister Netanyahu went on to characterize  Iran as \"the greatest threat to world peace.\"  The level \nof rhetoric from the Israeli leader was so high that the Haaretz newspaper described Netanyahu's remarks as \"an \nunprecedented verbal attack on the United States government.\"\n\nBy the close of September 2012, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu had addressed the United Nations General \nAssembly and declared that time was running out to halt Iran's push to acquire enough enriched uranium to develop \na nuclear bomb.  Using a crude visual and a red pen, Netanyahu again reiterated his demand that there be a \"red \nline\" draw as regards the Iranian nuclear threat.\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Netanyahu charged that Iran might have sufficient material to create a nuclear bomb by the middle \nof 2013, thus requiring a clear message from the international community in the form of the \"red line.\"  Netanyahu \nsaid, \"Red lines don't lead to war, red lines prevent war. Nothing could imperil the world more than a nuclear-armed \nIran.\"  He also dismissed the effectiveness of sanctions passed against Iran, saying that they had not curtailed \nIran's nuclear program and asserting that \"The Iranian nuclear calendar does not take time out.\"\n\nIt should be noted that the United States has generally taken the view that an aggressive sanctions regime was the \nbest path to placing pressure on Iran to end its nuclear development program.  As well, United States Secretary of \nState Hillary Clinton seemed to dismiss Netanyahu's call, saying instead that her country was not prepared to \ncommit to drawing \"red lines.\"  In his own address to the United Nations General Assembly, President Barack \nObama asserted that his country  would \"do what we must\" to stop Tehran acquiring nuclear arms.\"  But he also \nmade it clear that while the United States has not foreclosed a military option against Iran, multinational \nnegotiations and sanctions should be given time to work.\n\nFor its part, Iran responded  to the Israeli prime minister's address by warning that it had the right to retaliate to any \nmilitary strike on its territory or interests.  Iran's deputy United Nations ambassador also said that his county \npossessed enough military might to defend itself and that it was not seeing nuclear weapons capability in the first \nplace.  Eshagh al-Habib said his country was \"strong enough to defend itself and reserves its full right to retaliate \nwith full force against any attack.\"\n\nThat being said, Iran's often-repeated claim that it had the right to a civilian nuclear program was itself subject to \nserious challenge. In mid-September 2012, the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency (IAEA), issued a stern rebuke of Iran's refusal to suspend uranium enrichment. Notably, the IAEA's \nresolution was proposed jointly by the United States, China, Russia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom in \na rare display of unity as regards the Iranian nuclear development issue. Meanwhile, IAEA Director General Yukiya \nAmano noted that despite a series of meetings with Iran throughout 2012 aimed at ensuring that the IAEA would be \nable to carry out its investigations, there had been no concrete results.  Amano characterized the lack of progress  \nas \"frustrating.\"\n\nBilateral Talks with the United States?\n\nOn Oct. 21, 2012, the New York Times reported that Iran had agreed to bilateral negotiations with the United States \nover its controversial nuclear development program. The New York Times, in its report, suggested that the talks \nmight be held after the November 2012 general elections in the United States. But shortly after this news item broke \nin the public sphere, the Obama White House was denying key aspects of these claims, asserting instead that while \nit was, in principle, prepared to meet with Iran bilaterally, there was actually no such plan afoot.\n\nTommy Vietor, a spokesperson for the United States National Security Council, offered the following statement: \"It's \nnot true that the United States and Iran have agreed to one-on-one talks or any meeting after the American \nelections.\" He continued: \"We continue to work... on a diplomatic solution and have said from the outset that we \nwould be prepared to meet bilaterally.\" Vietor reiterated the Obama administration's stance, saying: \"The president \nhas made clear that he will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and we will do what we must to achieve \nthat. The onus is on the Iranians to do so, otherwise they will continue to face crippling sanctions and increased \npressure.\"\n\nThis latter statement referred to the ongoing approach to dealing with Iran. With an eye on pressuring Iran, the \nUnited States, countries of the European Union, and other Western nation states have levied harsh sanctions on \nthat country.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, in the period of early November 2012, possible goodwill between the two sides was likely strained when \nIranian fighter jets shot at an unmanned United States drone carrying out routine surveillance mission over \ninternational waters. According to the Pentagon, two Iranian jets intercepted the Predator drone and fired \"multiple \nrounds\" in its direction. The Pentagon also made it clear that the drone was over international waters and never in \nIranian air space. That being said, the shots from the Iranian jets ended in futility as the drone was guided back to \nbase successfully. The Pentagon noted that the United States was undeterred from its intent to continue \nsurveillance in the area. Speaking on behalf of the Pentagon, spokesperson George Little said: \"The United States \nhas communicated to the Iranians that we will continue to conduct surveillance flights over international waters over \nthe Arabian Gulf.\"\n\nIs Iran suspending or increasing uranium enrichment?\n\nWith an eye on pressuring Iran, the United States, countries of the European Union, and other Western nation \nstates have levied harsh sanctions on that country. The United States, in particular, has taken the view that an \naggressive sanctions regime was the best path to placing pressure on Iran to end its nuclear development program. \nWhile United States President Barack Obama has not foreclosed the option of a military strike (either by the United \nStates or Israel) on Iran's nuclear facilities, and he has made his determination to stop Iran from building a nuclear \nbomb clear, he has also been emphatic that the harsh sanctions regime be given a chance to work. In a September \n2012 address to the United Nations General Assembly, President Barack Obama asserted that his country would \n\"do what we must\" to stop Tehran acquiring nuclear arms.\" But he also said that multinational negotiations and \nsanctions should be given time to work.\n\nTo that end, Iran was certainly suffering as a result of the crippling sanctions that included restrictions on banking, \nshipping, trade, insurance, as well as commodities and energy transactions. Together they have struck a blow on \nIran's commercial ties to the outside world. One area of sanctions that has seen notable success has been the \nexhaustive ban by SWIFT -- an international financial clearinghouse -- which prohibits the transfer of Iranian funds. \nThe SWIFT ban has affected access by ordinary Iranians to basic food items. At the same time, Iranians were being \nsubject to inflated prices of cooking oil and other staples, as well as a precipitous decline of Iran's national currency, \nwhich itself led to domestic unrest. Meanwhile, customs data from around the world showed that Iranian oil exports \nand oil revenues had sharply decreased. The question, of course, was whether or not the burgeoning decimation  \nof the Iranian economy would actually affect Tehran's behavior on the nuclear issue.\n\nA possible indication of the answer to that latter question came on Nov. 3, 2102, when the British-based Guardian \nnewspaper reported that Iran suspended its 20 percent uranium enrichment levels as a goodwill gesture ahead of \npossible talks with the United States. Higher levels of uranium enrichment was a precursor to weapons-grade \nuranium. The Guardian cited a report on the Al Arabiya website, which quoted Mohammad Hossein Asfari, a Iranian \nmember of parliament, expressing hope that damaging sanctions would be lifted in return for this move. The report \nseemed to be on something of a collision course with a recent revelation that Iran had recently finished installing \ncentrifuges for enriching uranium at its underground nuclear facility in Fordo. It should be noted that the Guardian \nsoon published a clarification of its original story, noting that Asfari was misquoted and that Iran had, in fact, not \nalready halted 20 percent uranium enrichment. Instead, Asfari was indicating Iran's willingness to stop enrichment \nat these higher levels if sanctions were lifted.\n\nIn President Obama's first news conference after winning re-election on Nov. 14, 2012, he dismissed the reports of \ntalks with Iran, saying they were simply \"not true.\"\n\n\n\nIn mid-2012, the very notion of a possible suspension of uranium enrichment by Iran was utterly blown away. A \nleaked report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that Iran was ready to double output at its \nFordo underground uranium enrichment facility. According to the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, Iran \ncould soon double the number of its operational centrifuges from 700 to 1,400. Inspectors from the IAEA who have \nmonitored the Fordo facility, which is buried in a mountain close to the holy city of Qom, have noted that while the \nuranium enrichment plant was not fully operational, it could well be ready in the space of only months. Moreover, \nincreased production of 20 percent medium-enriched uranium would be possible. Medium enriched uranium (at 20 \npercent levels) can be used for conversion into fuel for Iran's medical research reactor; however, highly-enriched \nuranium at the 90 percent level would be needed for the development of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe main question for the IAEA -- and the global community -- involved the matter of how easy (or difficult ) it would \nbe for Iran to increase its uranium enrichment activities in a manner that would allow for the development of a \nnuclear bomb. Further, what kind of timeline was at stake in achieving this end?\n\nIt should also be noted that this leaked report by the IAEA also indicated that \"extensive activities\" at the Parchin \nmilitary site had ensued. The nuclear watchdog agency warned that Iran may have been trying to hide evidence of \nsome sort of nuclear weapons experimentation. Accordingly, the IAEA concluded that it was \"unable... to conclude \nthat all nuclear material in Iran [was being used for] peaceful activities.\"\n\nSpecial Report on Iran's Nuclear Program (as of Spring 2013)\n\nOn Feb. 6, 2013, the United States tightened its financial sanctions against Iran, making it more difficult for that \ncountry to spend oil revenue.  Iran has already been subject to harsh international sanctions due to its controversial \nnuclear development program, its clandestine nuclear development activities, and its lack of cooperation with \nnuclear inspectors at the International Atomic Energy Agency.  It has additionally been subject to unilateral financial \nsanctions by the United States and other Western countries, in an effort to place pressure on Iran to relinquish its \nnuclear program, which most international powers believe is not intended for peaceful purposes but oriented \ntowards nuclear weaponization.  Existing financial sanctions were already having an effect on Iran's economy, \nmaking it difficult to procure basic goods, such as cooking oil and medical supplies,  creating huge obstacles for \nIran to do business with other countries, and contributing to a precipitous decline in the value of the Iranian \ncurrency, the rial.\n\nOn Feb. 7, 2013, Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rebuffed the notion of direct talks with the United States during an \naddress that was published on the Internet.  With an apparent reference to United States Vice President Joe \nBiden's suggestion of direct bilateral talks, followed by the tightening of sanctions, Khamenei said the United States \nwas giving the appearance of being open to negotiations while simultaneously  \"pointing a gun at Iran.\"  He further \nasserted that talks with the United States \"would solve nothing.\"  At issue were upcoming multilateral talks on \nIran's nuclear program.\n\nBiden was suggesting parallel bilateral talks, saying that his country was prepared to hold direct negotiations with \nIran \"when the Iranian leadership, supreme leader, is serious.\"  He continued, \"That offer stands, but it must be real \nand tangible and there has to be an agenda that they are prepared to speak to. We are not just prepared to do it for \nthe exercise.\" Of course, on Feb. 7, 2013,  with Khamenei's reaction on the record, it was apparent that the notion \nof bilateral talks was just an exercise in theory.\n\nIn the face of these developments, Iran continued to assert that its nuclear development program did not have a \nweapons dimension.\n\nOn Feb. 16, 2013,  Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, insisted that his country was not \ndeveloping nuclear weapons.  He also said that his preference would be the prohibition of nuclear weapons across \nthe world.  Still, Khamenei foreclosed the notion of global pressure on Iran and made it clear that if Iran wanted to \n\n\n\nmanufacture a nuclear bomb, no other country would be able to stop the process.  He said: \"We believe that \nnuclear weapons must be obliterated, and we do not intend to make nuclear weapons, but if we had not had this \nbelief and had decided to possess nuclear weapons, no power could have ever been able to stop us.\"\n\nWith a presidential election scheduled to be held in June 2013, there was no likelihood that the Iranian authorities \nwould give way to the will of the international community.  In fact, outgoing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad gave \nvoice to the domestic political climate in Iran when he said in a national address on state television: \"On behalf of \nthe Iranian nation, I say that whoever thinks that the Iranian nation would surrender to pressure is making a huge \nmistake and will take his wish to the grave.\"\n\nMeanwhile, talks in mid-February 2013 involving United Nations inspectors  yielded no progress.  Inspectors from \nthe United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), had traveled to Iran \nto try to reach an agreement aimed at allowing inspectors back into the country to continue their investigation into \nIran's suspected nuclear weapons program.  Of particular concern to IAEA inspectors has been the Parchin military \nbase where explosives tests related to nuclear weaponry were suspected to have taken place.  There were \nprevailing suspicions that Iran had  \"sanitized\" the site to conceal evidence of clandestine activities. That being said, \nIAEA inspectors attempting to reinvigorate the  nuclear investigation characterized their efforts with the Iranians as \nwholly unproductive.  In a news conference, the chief United Nations inspector, Herman Nackaerts, said that he and \nhis colleagues \"could not finalize the document\" aimed at resuming the inquiry, and that no new date had been set \nfor further negotiations.\n\nThere was an emerging sense -- even from the West -- that the door was closing on a peaceful resolution to the \nchallenge of the Iranian nuclear issue. According to a report by Reuters News,\n\na Western diplomat accredited to the IAEA was on the record saying: \"Despite its many commitments to do so, Iran \nhas not negotiated in good faith. It appears that we now have to ask ourselves if this is still the right tactic.\"\n\nThe expressed admission  by an IAEA-aligned diplomat of the failure of the negotiations progress meant that non-\nmilitary options were quickly dissipating.  Without progress on the diplomatic front, and with Iran in a stalemate with \nthe international community,  the specter of military action loomed large.  Israel has made it clear that it was willing \nto  use force, if necessary, to prevent Iran from developing its suspected nuclear weapons program.\n\nIt should be noted that Iran has done little to reduce the anxiety of the Western world.  First, the IAEA had already \nmade it clear that engagement with Iran  yielded absolutely no progress and that concerns related to Iran's nuclear \nprogram remained in tact.  Second,  Iran had denied IAEA inspectors from visiting the aforementioned Parchin site.\n\nThe case against Iran was further bolstered by the news that IAEA inspectors identified  new centrifuges at  Natanz \n-- Iran's main enrichment plant.  As reported by Reuters News on Feb. 21, 2013,  Iran  was now  installing \nadvanced machines to refine uranium -- a development that could potentially accelerate the  accumulation of \nmaterials used to develop a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe  new model of centrifuges, known as the IR2m, was able to enrich  uranium at rates two or three times faster \nthan prior levels  to date.  Although the new model of centrifuges were not yet believed to be fully functional, Iran \nwas already expanding its stockpile of higher grade uranium,  moving gradually closer to the so-called \"red line\" \nidentified by Israel as its final grounds for taking military action.\n\nIn a bit of encouraging news,  the IAEA also reported that Iran resumed converting some of its 20 percent \nconcentration uranium  for use as reactor fuel in late 2012.  That usage likely curtailed Iran's ability to develop a  \nhigher-grade uranium stockpile.  It was  possible that this information could cause Israel to delay military action \nagainst Iranian nuclear facilities.  Nevertheless, in the third week of February 2013,  Israel's Ambassador to the \nUnited States Micheal Oren reiterated his country's position that if no progress was made in the effort to stop Iran's \nnuclear development program, there was a high likelihood of a military gesture by mid-2013.  Oren made these \nremarks during an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" television show.\n\n\n\nFor its part, the Obama administration in the United States wasted no time in condemning Iran  over the installation \nof the IR2m centrifuges at the main uranium enrichment plant of Natanz.  As stated by United States Department of \nState spokesperson Victoria Nuland: \"The installation of new advanced centrifuges would be a further escalation \nand a continuing violation of Iran's (U.N.) obligations. It would mark yet another provocative step.\"\n\nAt  the end of February 2013, Iran  attended multilateral talks in Kazakhstan with the  so-called P5+1 group -- the  \nUnited Nations Security Council permanent members of China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom,  and the \nUnited States, plus plus Germany. According to Reuters News,  Vincent Floreani, a spokesperson for France's \nForeign Ministry, said the P5+1 countries were prepared to table a new offer for Iran, which could change the \ntrajectory of the negotiations to date .  He said, \"We will make a new offer that will have significant new elements. \nThe approach ... is to begin gradually with confidence-building measures. We want a real exchange that will lead to \nconcrete results.\"  For its part, Iran was claiming that it looked forward to these talks.  Iran's United Nations \nAmbassador Mohammad Khazaei said: \"As the representative of the Islamic Republic, I announce that Iran is not \nessentially against negotiations. Iranians are a civilized nation and always favor dialogue and are opposed to war.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the discussions in Kazakhstan, Saeed Jalili, Iran's chief negotiator, characterized the meeting in \na positive tone, describing the aforementioned new offer from the P5+1 countries as  \"more realistic and positive\"  \nand \"a little closer to Iran's position.\" According to the New York Times, the offer would require  Iran end its program \nof  uranium enrichment to 20 percent,  export its stockpile of existing more highly enriched uranium, and close its \nFordo enrichment facility.  In return or these three actions, the P5+1 countries would offer Iran sanctions relief,  \nincluding permission to resume trading of gold and precious metals, and permission to resuming limited  petroleum \ntrading and international banking.\n\nAt the end of these talks in Kazakhstan where the new offer was brought forward, all the parties reportedly agreed \nto a round of further discussions in April 2013.  It was to be seen if these negotiation on the basis of the new \nproposal  would prove fruitful or accentuate the prevailing perception that the door on a negotiated resolution was \nrapidly closing.\n\nPressure on Iran was mounting with the call from the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), \nYukiya Amano, on March 4, 2013, saying that Iran should \"proceed with a sense of urgency\" and focus on \nachieving real and rapid results.  Amano reiterated its stance that the IAEA \"cannot conclude that all nuclear \nmaterial in Iran is in peaceful activities.\"  At issue was the IAEA's desire to inspect the  Parchin military site where \ntesting related to nuclear weapons development was believed to have taken place, but where access to IAEA \ninspectors has long been subject to denial by Iran.\n\nOn the same day, United States Vice President Joe Biden said that President Barack Obama was \"not bluffing\" \nabout the United States' determination to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.  In a speech in front of a \nmajor pro-Israeli lobbying group, he said, \"We're not looking for war. We're ready to negotiate peacefully. But all \noptions including military force are on the table. While that window is closing, we believe there is still time and \nspace (for diplomacy).\"\n\nThe main question for the IAEA, the United Nations Security Council, the P5+1 countries, Israel, and the global \ncommunity at large, involved the matter of how easy (or difficult) it would be for Iran to increase its uranium \nenrichment activities in a manner that would allow for the development of a nuclear bomb. Further, what kind of \ntimeline was at stake in achieving this end?  Was United States Vice President Joe Biden's statement on Iran on \nMarch 4, 2013, pure bluster? Or was it a warning  of sorts from Washington to Tehran?\n\nThese questions would likely be complicated by the announcement of  new uranium discoveries in Iran and the \nIranians' declaration that it was expanding its nuclear development program.  Iran said that it had found  new \nuranium deposits and as many  as 16 sites were deemed to be suitable for the construction of new power plants.  \nIran additionally said that the discovery of uranium deposits would multiply \"the current amount of [uranium] \nresources,\" and thus facilitate the expansion of the country's nuclear development program.\n\n\n\nBy mid-March 2013, as United States President Barack Obama was preparing to embark on his first official visit to \nIsrael as a sitting American head of state,  the issue of Iran's nuclear development program was dominating the \ninternational geopolitical landscape.  For some time, Israel has threatened strikes on suspected Iranian nuclear \nfacilities, in the interests of national security.  Indeed, Iran does not recognize the Jewish state of Israel and has \nissued repeated (often anti-Semitic) warnings to \"wipe Israel off the map,\" essentially posing an existential threat to \nthe Jewish State.\n\nWhile the United States has eschewed imprudent military action against Iran, it has nonetheless stood with Israel in \nasserting that it would take necessary action to prevent the Islamic Republic of Iran from ever producing a nuclear \nweapon.\n\nAhead of this visit to Israel, President Obama was signaling that Iran was yet some ways away from being able to \nproduce a nuclear weapon.  In a pre-visit interview with Channel 2 in Israeli, he said that Iran was \"over a year or \nso\" away from being able to develop a nuclear weapon.  Still, President Obama said that he was not interested in \nleaving action against Iran for the last moment.  He said, \"We think that it would take over a year or so for Iran to \nactually develop a nuclear weapon but obviously we don't want to cut it too close.\" Describing the purpose of his \nmeeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the issue of Iran, President Obama said, \"My message  \nwill be the same as before: if we can resolve it diplomatically, that's a more lasting solution. But if not, I continue to \nkeep all options on the table.\"  The United States leader did not foreclose military strikes against Iran's nuclear \nfacilities, saying, \"When I say that all options are on the table, all options are on the table and the United States \nobviously has significant capabilities.\"\n\nOnce \"in country\" in Israel, President Obama confirmed his stance on Iran, asserting the United States' resolve to \nprevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu  underlined the United States \npresident's commitment on this issue,  saying he was \"absolutely convinced that the president [Obama] is \ndetermined to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. In a significant development, Netanyahu acknowledged \nthat Obama's stated one  year timeline on Iran's nuclear weapons development capacity was correct, although he \nnoted that his [Netanyahu's] so-called \"red line\" involved the uranium enrichment aspect of weaponization and not \nthe actual building of a nuclear weapon.  Of course, both uranium enrichment and the manufacture of a bomb would \nbe involved in nuclear weapons development.  Accordingly, it seemed that  President Obama and Prime Minister \nNetanyahu were respectively offering a sense of unanimity on the issue of Iran and its nuclear development \nprogram.\n\nIn April  2013, multilateral talks  on Iran's nuclear development program concluded with no resolution.  Participants \nat the meetings included representatives from Iran, as well as the so-called P5+1 multilateral cadre consisting of the \nthe five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- the United States,  the United Kingdom, \nFrance, Russia, China, plus Germany.\n\nThe new round of meetings in Kazakhstan took place over the course of two days and were intended to reach  a \nresolution on the matter of Iran's controversial nuclear development program, which the West believes is intended \nto ultimately produce nuclear weapons.  Despite reports by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that Iran \nhas been non-cooperative on the status of its program, as well as the discovery of a clandestine nuclear \ndevelopment site,  Iran rejects this claim and maintains that its nuclear agenda is for purely peaceful purposes.\n\nOn the table for discussion during the April 2013 round of multilateral talks was a deal that would require Iran to \nrelinquish its most sensitive nuclear activities in exchange for the easing of harsh sanctions, which have been \ndamaging to the Iranian economy.  Yet even with this offer at stake, the meeting in Almaty ended without resolution \nand with world powers lamenting that the respective positions of Iran and the world powers remained \"far apart\" and \nthat there had been \" no  breakthrough.\"\n\n\n\nAs noted by the foreign policy chief of the European Union, Catherine Ashton,  \"It became clear that the positions... \nremain far apart on the substance. We have therefore agreed that all sides will go back to [their] capitals to evaluate \nwhere we stand in the process.\"  Striking a similar tone, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said, \n\"Unfortunately we were unable to achieve a breakthrough and are still on the threshold.\"  There has been no time or \nvenue established for further negotiations.\n\nEditor's Note\n\nIt should be noted that in mid-2012, a leaked report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated \nthat Iran was ready to double output at its Fordo underground uranium enrichment facility. According to the United \nNations nuclear watchdog agency, Iran could soon double the number of its operational centrifuges from 700 to \n1,400. Inspectors from the IAEA who have monitored the Fordo facility, which is buried in a mountain close to the \nholy city of Qom, have noted that while the uranium enrichment plant was not fully operational, it could well be \nready in the space of only months. Moreover, increased production of 20 percent medium-enriched uranium would \nbe possible. Medium enriched uranium (at 20 percent levels) can be used for conversion into fuel for Iran's medical \nresearch reactor; however, highly-enriched uranium at the 90 percent level would be needed for the development of \nnuclear weapons.\n\nIt should also be noted that this leaked report by the IAEA also indicated that \"extensive activities\" at the Parchin \nmilitary site had ensued. The nuclear watchdog agency warned that Iran may have been trying to hide evidence of \nsome sort of nuclear weapons experimentation. Accordingly, the IAEA concluded that it was \"unable... to conclude \nthat all nuclear material in Iran [was being used for] peaceful activities.\"\n\nAs noted here,  attempts in 2013 to reinvigorate the inquiry into activities at Parchin yielded no progress.  Moreover, \nIran announced in February 2013 that it would be installing advanced machines to refine uranium at Natanz  -- a \ndevelopment that could potentially accelerate the  accumulation of materials used to develop a nuclear weapon. \nTogether, this news  only served to raise the stakes  and increase the sense of anxiety over Iran's controversial \nnuclear development program.\n\nSpecial Report: Western sanctions against Iran taking a toll on economy\n\nAt the start of  May 2013 --  ahead of the presidential election in Iran -- United States data sources indicated that \ncrippling sanctions imposed by Western countries on Iran for its intransigence on its nuclear program were yielding \nresults.  At issue were a package of ever-increasingly harsh sanctions imposed since 2010  by the United States \nand European union on Iran's central bank and financial sector. The sanctions effectively  functioned as a  blockade \non  payments for oil exports by forcing trading countries to decide whether they wanted to do business with the likes \nof the United States or Iran.\n\nGoing back to  2012, a report by Reuters had noted that  Iran was finding it difficult to purchase staples such as rice \nand cooking oil, which  are needed to feed its population.  For example, Malaysian exporters of palm oil stopped \nsales to Iran because they could not receive payment.  Likewise, there were reports that Iran had defaulted on \npayments for rice from India -- its main  supplier.  As well, shipments of maize from Ukraine had apparently been \ncut in half. Meanwhile, the price of basic food was exponentially escalating.  As well, countries around the world that \nhad previously dobe business with Iran, such as South Korea, were looking for alternative sources of oil.  In \naddition, multinational corporations based in Europe were suspending deals with Iran due to the new European \nUnion sanctions.\n\nPerhaps more detrimental for Iran were obstacles in  selling its oil and receiving payments for its oil  exports. In \nplaces where Iran is still able to sell oil, it has been stymied from receipt of funds due to prevailing sanctions, \nespecially those levied by the United States.  And in another twist, if Iran could not sell its typical  2.6 million barrels \n\n\n\nof oil a day, or, if its was forced to  sell those barrels at deep discounts, the decreased revenue would inevitably \nhave a debilitating effect on the Iranian economy, adding to the possibility of social unrest.\n\nThese findings from international commodities traders, which were part of a Reuters investigation, indicated real \ndisruptions to Iran and flew in the face of claims from Tehran that sanctions were having no effect.\n\nIn May 2013, as noted above,  United States data sources indicated that the crippling sanctions imposed by the \nUnited States and European Union countries on Iran  were exacting a heavy toll.  Indeed, these United States \nstatistics showed Iranian oil exports tumbling to a 26-year low.  The United States Department of Energy estimated \nthat Iran's oil exports earned less than $70 billion billion in 2012 -- a  27 percent decrease as compared with  $95 \nbillion in 2011.  As well, the  International Energy Agency -- a  watchdog entity --  estimated Iran lost more than $40 \nbillion in export revenues in 2012.\n\nStill, according to the Financial Times, Iran was mitigating the effects of devolving oil exports via higher oil prices. \nAs well, Iran was trying to circumvent the sanctions imposed by the United States and European union on Iran's \ncentral bank and financial sector by trading oil for goods.\n\nYet even with these moves,  there were reports that Iran was storing an unusually large volume of oil in \nsupertankers in the Persian Gulf.  This was due to dwindling purchasers from Asian markets.  As noted by the \nFinancial Times, all expectations were that Iran would eventually have to  cut its already low production, which \nwould exacerbate its burgeoning economic crisis.  With Iranians feeling the pain of the sanctions  in the form of \ninflation, the sliding  value of its currency (the rial),  and high unemployment,  and with a presidential election \nunlikely to provide any hope for substantial political change, the anxieties over public discontent were increasing.\n\nSpecial Report\n\nA note on sanctions against Iran and the effects on the Iranian economy  (some content repeated from section on \nsanctions above)--\n\nAs intimated above, Iran's nuclear program has been directly related to the country's economic woes.  Indeed, the \ncombination of poor economic stewardship by former President Ahmadinejad, in conjunction with the harsh financial \nsanctions regime imposed by the West (and led by the United States), was deeply damaging to the Iranian \neconomy. Progress on nuclear negotiations could potentially lead to sanctions relief and thus, a much needed \neconomic jolt for Iran.\n\nAt the start of  May 2013 -- one month ahead of the presidential election in Iran -- United States data sources \nindicated that crippling sanctions imposed by Western countries on Iran for its intransigence on its nuclear program \nwere yielding results.  At issue were a package of ever-increasingly harsh sanctions imposed since 2010  by the \nUnited States and European union on Iran's central bank and financial sector.

With Iranians feeling the pain of the sanctions  in the form of \ninflation, the sliding  value of its currency (the rial),  and high unemployment,  economic anxieties and public \ndiscontent characterized the socio-economic climate in Iran.\n\nPrimer on  2013 Iran's presidential election\n\nA presidential election was set to be held in Iran on June 14, 2013.\n\nIn Iran, executive power actually lies with the supreme leader of the Islamic Revolution, as well as three oversight \nbodies: the Assembly of Experts, the Expediency Council, and the Council of Guardians. That being said, president \nfunctions as the head of government and is viewed as the \"face of the nation\" to the international community. \nAlthough Iranians vote in popular election for president, candidates to this post are approved by the upper echelons \nof executive government, the bodies of which are listed above.\n\nIn 2005, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected as president by popular vote in the second round of elections; he \nclaimed re-election win in 2009 under contested conditions. While Iran's government announced that Mahmoud \nAhmadinejad won re-election on June 12, 2009, his main rival Mir-Hossein Mousavi claimed victory and accused \nthe authorities of indulging in widespread fraud and vote rigging to deprive him of winning the presidency. The \nreformists in Iran as well as the international community largely condemned the election results. Mass protests in \nthe form of the \"Green Revolution\" (to mark Mousavi's emblem) ensued but were eventually squashed violently by \nthe government forces, with bloody results. Since that time, most of Iran's leading reformists have been jailed or \ndetained, essentially suppressing the most effective elements of the reform movement in the country.\n\nIn 2013, Ahmadinejad was not eligible to contest the presidential election again. Instead, a new cadre of candidates \nwould be on the ballot. The Interior Ministry in May 2013 released its official slate of approved candidates. In Iran, \nas noted above, although the presidential election is touted to be a popular contest, in fact, the candidates must be \napproved by the executive oversight bodies that hold the real reins of power in the country. This \"approved\" listing \n\n\n\nof presidential candidates included the following individual: Iran's nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, former nuclear \nnegotiator Hassan Rouhani, Tehran Mayor Mohammad-Baqer Qalibaf, former Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar Velayati, \nformer Oil and Telecommunications Minister Mohammad Gharazi, former senior military commander Mohsen \nRezaei, senior lawmaker Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel, and Mohammad-Reza Aref, who served as the former Iranian \nfirst vice president under the reformist President Mohammad Khatami. It should be noted that Jalili, Velayati, and \nHadad-Adel were known to be stalwarts of the Iranian Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei.\n\nConspicuously absent from the list or approved candidates was former moderate President Akbar Hashemi-\nRafsanjani, who had announced his intention to contest the presidency, as well as Esfandiar Rahim-Mashaei, a top \naide of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. These two omissions, in conjunction with the inclusion of Jalili, Velayati, \nand Haddad-Adel, made it clear that the Supreme Leader -- Ayatollah Ali Khamenei -- intended to continue to wield \nthe real power in Iran. Indeed, the ayatollah was making sure that the bench of presidential contenders was filled \nwith his own supporters, while his possible rivals would be side-lined.\n\nFirst, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was ensuring that the reformists and moderates would have no outlet in this election \nby disqualifying Rafsanjani from the presidential race. Second, he was dispensing with the pro-Ahmadinejad wing, \nwhich had in recent years become a thorn in the side of the existing power brokers. Clearly, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \nwas making sure that conservatives and hard liners would maintain their hold over the affairs of Iran by suppressing \nthe moderates and reformists who might be attracted to Rafsanjani, while neutering the Ahmadinejad wing, with \nwhom it had become embroiled in an inconvenient and irritating power struggle.\n\nNot one to stay silent on his exclusion from the presidential contest, Rafsanjani said he wanted to contest the \nelection because he believed that religious principles were no longer effective governing policies in Iran and he \nurged economic liberalization, ameliorated relations with the international community, and the empowerment of \nIran's elected bodies. According to the opposition website, Kaleme and Rah-e-Sabz, Rafsanjani also referenced the \nGuardians Council decision to exclude him from the final list of candidates , saying, \"I think it is not possible to run \nthe country worse than this, even if it had been planned in advance... I don't want to stoop to their propaganda and \nattacks, but their ignorance is worrying. Do they even understand what they're doing?\"\n\nHis rhetoric appeared to have resonance as Zahra Mostafavi Khomeini, the daughter of Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah \nKhomeini (Iran's revolutionary leader) dispatched a letter to the current supreme leader, Khamenei, urging that \nRafsanjani be approved as a candidate, and noting that his disqualification from the approved list of presidential \ncandidates displayed \"disrespect to the wishes of the people\" and \"great harm\" to the regime.\n\nMeanwhile, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad addressed the disqualification of his ally, Esfandiar Rahim-\nMashaei, by promising to take up the matter with the leadership of Ayatollah Khamenei. Ahmadinejad was on the \nrecord saying, \"I will take up the issue with him (Khamenei) and pursue it to the last moment, and I hope the \nproblem will be solved.\"\n\nThe international community entered the fray at the end of May 2013 when a cadre of independent human rights \nexperts from the United Nations expressed their concerns over the disqualification of several candidates in the \npresidential election. Their concerns were not limited to the high profile cases of Rafsanjani and Mashaei, but also \nthe disqualification of more than two dozen women who wanted to contest the presidential race. Ahmed Shaheed, a \nspecial rapporteur on human rights in Iran, was reported to have said: \"This mass disqualification including that of \nwomen wishing to stand in the presidential elections is discriminatory and violates fundamental right to political \nparticipation, and runs contrary to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Iran has ratified.\" \nShaheed continued, \"Any restrictions on this right must be based on objective and reasonable criteria without \ndistinction of any kind, including race, gender, religion, and political or other opinion.\"\n\n\n\nAhead of the elections, the candidates of the approved list participated in a series of high-controlled and state-\nadministered debates. The economy emerged as a key issue with the candidates promising to move Iran past its \neconomic difficulties sourced in serious sanctions levied by the West over Iran's nuclear program. As for that very \nnuclear program, there was some divergence from the candidates on this controversial issue.\n\nHardliner conservative Saeed Jalili, who has been Iran's nuclear negotiator, insisted on maintaining Iran's \nintransigent position during a debate. He said, \"If our interests are at odds with (the demands) of some countries, \nwe should defend our rights by resistance.\" He continued saying, \"One of our discussions is that we do not accept \nthe hegemonic power in the world and are in challenge with it. We are being challenged by a system which intends \nto forcefully rule the world.\"\n\nFormer Iranian Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar Velayati took a somewhat different perspective as he pointed out the \nfailure of Jalili's brand of diplomacy in recent years. He said, \"This is not diplomacy to sit face-to-face with the other \nside and to recite the same words...This is not diplomacy to read a statement before other countries.\" He \ncontinued, \"The art of diplomacy is to preserve the country's nuclear right and, at the same time, we diminish \nsanctions.\" Velayati thus argued that Iran should have worked constructively with the international power brokers on \nthe deal advanced by the P5+1 group (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus \nGermany) in the most recent round of nuclear talks in Kazakhstan.\n\nModerate candidate and former nuclear diplomat, Hassan Rouhani, also pointed to the failure of the current \ndiplomatic track under Jalili and broadly called for \"wisdom\" and a more rational nuclear policy. He also suggested \nthat Iran should consider the temporary suspension of its uranium enrichment program, due to the economic \nhardship endured under the West's sanctions regime.\n\nTehran's Mayor Mohammad-Bagher Qalibaf joined the chorus of critics over the incumbent executive branch's \ndiplomatic efforts. Qalibaf said he intended to consider diplomatic overtures from the international community while \npreserving the interests and identity of the nation.\n\nGholam-Ali Haddad-Adel stood in line with Jalili's stance as defended Iran's defiance and placed the blame for the \nlack of diplomatic progress on the United States. He said, \"The United States cannot stand political and cultural \nindependence of Iran after the 1979 Islamic revolution.\"\n\nOnly days before the Iranian election was set to take place, reformist candidate, Mohammad-Reza Aref, withdrew \nfrom the presidential race and said that he was placing his support behind the moderate candidate, Hassan \nRouhani. The move seemed to be aimed at ensuring that the reformist and moderate constituencies were not split \nbetween the two men, and indirectly giving a boost to the hardliners in the field. Instead, moderates and reformists \nwere making a tactical decision to consolidate their vote shares. The move was backed by former reformist \nPresident Mohammad Khatami and former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani -- a quasi-moderate whose \ncandidacy for the presidency was not approved by the Iranian authorities, as discussed above.\n\nEarlier, the field was further depleted when apparent hardliner, Gholam Ali Haddad-Adel, withdrew his candidacy \nfrom the country presidential election. In his case, this move appeared aimed at ensuring he did not take votes \naway from fellow conservative, Saeed Jalili. He also was clear about indicating that Iranians' votes should not be \ncast according to personal preferences but, instead, be a reflection of the will of the country's leadership. Indeed, \nHaddad-Adel called on Iranian voters to \"strictly observe\" the guidance of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali \nKhamenei when they went to the polls to vote.\n\nMeanwhile, a cadre of conservative clerics belonging to the Qom Seminary Scholars Association offered its \nendorsement too former Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati.\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that Velayati was viewed as the frontrunner in the presidential race by many Iranian analysts due \nto his closeness to the Iranian political establishment.\n\nWhy is this election important?\n\nFor decades, Iran has had a conflict-ridden relationship with the countries of the West, and an overtly hostile \nrelationship with the United States and its closest ally in the Middle East, Israel. Iran's more recent nuclear \nambitions have served only to raise geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, with several Arab countries \nincreasingly anxious about a future nuclear-armed Iran in their neighborhood. Even without much chance of a \nplausible reformist at the helm of Iran after this 2013 presidential contest, the Western world likely hopes that \nAhmadinejad's successor might be more amenable to productive nuclear negotiations, with an eye ultimately on \nglobal security.\n\nElection Results:\n\nOn election day in Iran, turnout was reported to be very high and estimated to be around 80 percent. \nRepresentatives of all of the candidates issued a joint statement calling on their supporters to stay calm until the \nofficial results were known.\n\nEarly election results gave the moderate candidate, Rouhani, a significant lead in the Iranian election, with Qalibaf \nin second place, and the conservatives and hardliners like Jalili and Velayati trailing far behind. It was to be seen if \nthis trend would hold when the vote count was complete. If no one candidate secured 50 percent of the vote share, \na second round would take place a week later on June 21, 2013.\n\nBut several hours after the polls had closed and the long process of counting the votes was finally complete, there \nwas a shocking development on the Iranian political landscape. Not only had the lone moderate candidate in the \nfield -- Rouhani -- manged to capture the most votes, he had also crossed the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid \na second round and had won with an outright victory. The election results gave Rouhani 52 percent, Qalibaf 17 \npercent, Jalili 11 percent, and left the other candidates, including Velayati, even further behind.\n\nIn comparison to the votes secured by his fellow candidates, one could argue that Rouhani scored a landslide \nvictory. The people of Iran were certainly treating it as such, with thousands of people taking to the streets of \nTehran to celebrate Rouhani's election success. One report from the ground in Tehran, via Twitter, was as follows: \n\"We are celebrating that we are free after eight years of Ahmadinejad.\" Other Twitter feeds reported the following \nmessages from Iranians in the streets: \"Bye, bye Ami!\" and \"Long live reform, long live Rouhani.\"\n\nThe interior ministry confirmed that Rouhani had won the presidency in a statement to the public. As declared by \nInterior Minister Mostafa Mohammad-Najjar: \"Mr. Hassan Rohani ... got the absolute majority of votes and was \nelected as president.\"\n\nThe long process of vote counting in Election 2013 was a contrast to Election 2009 when results were announced in \nshort order to the benefit of Ahmadinejad amidst accusations of fraud. In 2013, it seemed to be a sign of political \nprogress that the Iranian establishment authorities acknowledged outright that Rouhani -- the candidate they had \nnot endorsed -- had actually won the election. There were many Iranians who were now suggesting that Rouhani's \nupset victory, to some degree, \"redeemed\" Iran's political system, which was so badly tainted in the aftermath of the \n2009 disputed presidential election. At the very least, the handling of these elections in 2013 placed a patina of \nlegitimacy on Iran's damaged electoral system.\n\nSpecial Report\n\n\n\nRouhani inaugurated as Iranian president\n\nIntroduction:\n\nOn Aug. 4, 2013, Hassan Rouhani  was inaugurated as the new president of Iran, succeeding outgoing Mahmoud \nAhmadinejad.\n\nA former nuclear negotiator, Rouhani has been known as a moderate and has advocated both reform and an end to \nthe international diplomatic isolation that has plagued Iran due to its controversial nuclear program.\n\nAhead of the formal swearing in ceremony. Rouhani said: \"I have assumed this responsibility with the support of \nthose people who want change, who want a better life, away from corruption, poverty and discrimination, people \nwho want more respect and dignity, and hope in a secure future.\"  Then, in his first speech as president, Rouhani \nurged an end to the crippling sanctions that have damaged Iran's economy.  It was to be seen how far Rouhani \nwould be willing to go -- in terms of serious diplomatic engagement over its nuclear program --in order to lift Iran out \nof its state of international alienation.\n\nRouhani's victory and the policy agenda going forward --\n\nIn many senses, Rouhani's victory was a repudiation of the conservative and hardline base that controls most of the \npower in Iran. Rouhani's strong performance -- evidenced by his first round outright victory -- certainly suggested a \npopular rejection of the conservative and theocratic power base, despite the fact that Ayatollah Ali Hoseini \nKhamenei and his leadership cadre had tried to \"stack\" the proverbial deck of candidates with hardliner stalwarts. It \nwas noteworthy that the candidates backed by the hardliners and conservatives were at the proverbial \"back of the \npack\" and garnered the least amount of popular support. As well, Rouhani's election win made it clear that the \nreformist movement remained alive, despite the Iranian authorities' efforts to sideline well-known moderates, such \nas Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, and leaders of the 2009 \"Green Revolution\" reform movement, such as Mousavi and \nKarroubi.  While Rouhani himself was no activist reformist, as a moderate, he was the only palatable option for \nvoters with reformist inclinations.\n\nUltimately, Rouhani's victory illuminated the reality that the Iranian public was ready for an end to the policies that \nhave yielded economic havoc and international isolation, and hungry for transformation. Of course, the desires of \nthe public and the political elite were not necessarily in sync with one another.\n\nFor his part, Rouhani has promised \"constructive interaction with the world\" including measures aimed at assuaging \nthe West over Iran's controversial nuclear program. A sharp critic of the belligerent tone taken by the outgoing \npresidency of Ahmadinejad, and the lack of diplomatic progress made in the previous eight years on the \ninternational front, Rouhani was reported to have said in a campaign speech: \"We won't let the past eight years be \ncontinued. They brought sanctions for the country. Yet, they are proud of it. I'll pursue a policy of reconciliation and \npeace. We will also reconcile with the world.\"\n\nIt was to be seen if Rouhani would make good on this promise, and if Ayatollah Khamenei, the Guardians Council, \nand the rest of Iran's executive power base would actually allow the new president to pursue this path. As noted by \nAli Vaez of the International Crisis Group, \"Remember that Iran is governed by complex institutions and competing \npower centers that inherently favor continuity over radical change.\"\n\nThat being said, it was clear that Rouhani -- a mild-mannered moderate and former nuclear negotiator with fluency \nin several languages -- had a popular mandate for change. Perhaps his presidency would provide the Ayatollah \nKhamenei and the conservative clerics with an imprimatur of sorts to soften their own stances, while claiming that \nIran was simply following the natural democratic course. Stated differently, it was possible that Rouhani's clear \n\n\n\npresidential victory would offer him political latitude to make some progress in pursuing improved relations with the \ninternational community, especially on the nuclear development front. Progress on nuclear negotiations could lead \nto economic relief as economic and financial sanctions by the West have been deeply damaging to the Iranian \neconomy. But no doubt the West was waiting to see what a Rouhani presidency would actually look like with the \ncampaign rhetoric at an end, and the actual governing set to begin.\n\nAt the start of July 2013, Rouhani reiterated his commitment to engagement and cooperation with members of the \ninternational community. As reported by Iranian state media, Rouhani said: \"Expanding ties with the neighboring \ncountries and strengthening regional cooperation in order to maintain peace and provide the interests of the \nregional nations is one of the foreign policy priorities of Iran's 11th administration.\"\n\nNote: Rouhani was set to be inaugurated into power as Iran's new president in August 2013.\n\nOn Aug. 3, 2013 -- one day ahead of the formal swearing in ceremony -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah  \nKhamenei officially endorsed Rouhani as the country's president.  Khamenei said he took satisfaction in the recent \npresidential elections as the manifestation of \"religious democracy\" and encouraged Rouhani to adhere to  \n\"religious values\" in his role as president.\n\nFor his part, Rouhani took the bold step of saying that he rejected extremism of any kind, and reminded people that \nhis moderate political orientation was compatible with Islam.  During the endorsement ceremony, Rouhani also \nmade note of the fact that the Iranian people voted for \"change\" in the presidential election and, as such, he was \ncommitted to fulfilling his campaign promises.  To this end, he said: \"I have assumed this responsibility with the \nsupport of those people who want change, who want a better life, away from corruption, poverty and discrimination, \npeople who want more respect and dignity, and hope in a secure future.\"\n\nHassan Rouhani  was  formally inaugurated as the new president of Iran in August 2013, succeeding outgoing \nMahmoud Ahmadinejad. Just ahead of his inauguration, Rouhani took the bold step of saying that he rejected \nextremism of any kind, and reminded people that his moderate political orientation was compatible with Islam.  \nDuring the endorsement ceremony, Rouhani also made note of the fact that the Iranian people voted for \"change\" in \nthe presidential election and, as such, he was committed to fulfilling his campaign promises.  To this end, he said: \"I \nhave assumed this responsibility with the support of those people who want change, who want a better life, away \nfrom corruption, poverty and discrimination, people who want more respect and dignity, and hope in a secure \nfuture.\"\n\nDuring his inauguration speech to parliament, Rouhani called on the countries of the West to drop their sanctions \nagainst Iran and treat Tehran with respect.  Rouhani said, \"If you want an adequate response, you shouldn't speak \nthe language of sanctions, you should speak the language of respect.\" Left unsaid was the fact that those sanctions \nhad been levied due to Iran's lack of cooperation and transparency provided to United Nations nuclear inspectors \ntrying to examine suspected nuclear sites in Iran.\n\nNot surprisingly, the populist declaration was met with cheers from the members of parliament.  But Rouhani did \nnot abandon his moderate credentials.  He also said his government would attempt to improve relations with the \nwider world, and build greater trust with the international community.  Crucially, Rouhani declared, \"In international \ninteractions, my government will try to build mutual trust between Iran and the regional and global countries.\"\n\nThe United States wasted little time in issuing a response, saying Iran now had an opportunity to dispel the fears of \nthe global world over its nuclear ambitions.  The Obama White House said it would be a \"willing partner\" if Iran \nengaged seriously with the international community, and met its obligations regarding its nuclear program. As noted \nby White House Press Secretary Jay Carney: \"Should this new government choose to engage substantively and \nseriously to meet its international obligations and find a peaceful solution to this issue, it will find a willing partner in \nthe United States.\"\n\n\n\nIt was to be seen if Iran under Rouhani would actually move in the direction of productive engagement over its \nnuclear program following years of diplomatic impasse.  On the other hand, it was also possible that Iran under \nRouhani would spell continued diplomatic stalemate, minus the fiery  Ahmadinejad-style rhetoric.\n\nSpecial Report:\n\nBombing at Iranian embassy in Beirut highlights increasing Sunni-Shi'a sectarian conflict in the Middle East\n\nOn Nov. 19, 2013, a double suicide bombing outside the Iranian embassy in the Lebanese capital of Beirut left \nmore than 20 people dead and more than 140 others injured.  The first bombing was carried out by a suicide \nattacker on a motorcycle, while the second was executed by a suicide bomber in a a four-wheel drive vehicle. \nAmong the dead was the Iranian cultural attache, Sheikh Ibrahim Ansari, who had just assumed his diplomatic post \na month prior. \n\nBecause Iran has been a well-known supporter of the Lebanese Shi'a Islamic extremist group, Hezbollah, which \ndeployed  fighters to Syria to help the government of Bashar al-Assad hang onto power against rebel forces, there \nwere suggestions that this attack was a manifestation of spillover violence from the Syrian civil war.\n\nCertainly, the violence and bloodshed augured negatively for Lebanon as it pushed the country  further into a state \nof turmoil. Noteworthy was the fact that it was the first  since Lebanon's 1975-90 Civil War that an embassy had \nbeen targeted.  Moreover, the brazen act of violence illustrated the ease with which Lebanon  was being pulled into \nSyria's destructive orbit.\n\nThere was also a sectarian element to the attack as the  Sunni Jihadist group, Abdullah Azzam Brigades, claimed \nresponsibility for the violence at the Iranian embassy in Beirut.  Via the Twitter account of the group's religious \nguide, Sheikh Sirajeddine Zuraiqat, Abdullah Azzam Brigades issued its formal claim of responsibility, declaring: \n\"The Abdullah Azzam brigades - the Hussein bin Ali cells - may they please God - are behind the attack on the \nIranian embassy in Beirut.\"  The group, which is linked with the notorious terror enclave, al-Qaida, also said that the \nbombings were a \"double martyrdom operation carried out by two heroes from the heroic Sunnis of Lebanon.\"  The \ngroup threatened more attacks in Lebanon until Iran withdrew its forces from  Syria, bolstering the view that a \nsectarian conflict that transcended borders was emerging in the Middle East.\n\nIn Lebanon, caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the violence, calling it \"a cowardly terrorist act.\"  \nLebanese Parliamentary Speaker Nabih Berri -- a member of the Hezbollah faction in the Lebanese parliament -- \nwarned that the terrorists behind the attack on the Iranian embassy were the people who attempted to assassinate \nhim a year prior.  He was quoted in  Lebanon's Daily Star newspaper as saying, \"Those who targeted the embassy \n[Tuesday] are the same team that threatened to assassinate me.\"\n\nThere was also a global outcry against the bombings, especially given the fact that a diplomatic post was the target. \nUnited Kingdom Foreign Secretary William Hague  said: \"The U.K. is strongly committed to supporting stability in \nLebanon and seeing those responsible for this attack brought to justice.\"  United States Secretary of State John \nKerry said, \"The United States knows too well the cost of terrorism directed at our own diplomats around the world, \nand our hearts go out to the Iranian people after this violent and unjustifiable attack.\"\n\nAt the start of January 2014, DNA tests  confirmed that a man arrested in Lebanon was likely  wanted in connection \nwith the bombing of the Iranian Embassy in Beirut months earlier in November 2013.  The man was identified as \nMajid al-Majid, the head of the Abdullah Azzam Brigades, which claimed responsibility for bombing. According  to \nthe Daily Star in Beirut,  Majid had been captured by the Lebanese army and was on Saudi Arabia's list of 85 most \nwanted individuals for his links to the Islamist Jihadist  terror enclave, al-Qaida.\n\n\n\nForeign Relations Note: \n\nYemen turns into proxy war between Shi'a Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia\n\nForeign Relations Note: Yemen turns into proxy war between Shi'a Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia\n\nOn March 20, 2015, the notorious and blood-thirsty terror group, Islamic State (also known as Islamic State in the \nLevant or ISIL), carried out double deadly suicide bombings in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, killing close to 140 \npeople and injuring 300 others.\n\nThe terror group, Islamic State has held sway in large portions of Syria and Iraq and been responsible for some of \nthe most barbaric acts of murder, slavery, abduction and abuse seen in recent history.  While its aim to establish an \nultra-hardline  Sunni Islamic caliphate has concentrated on the Syria-Iraq region (known as the Levant), an attack \nearlier in the week in Tunisia, as well as recently announced alliances with other Islamist terror groups, such as \nBoko Haram in Nigeria, indicate an emerging global Jihadist agenda.\n\nAlready, Yemen has been dealing with exactly this threat of global Jihadism from al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula \n(AQAP) from within its own borders.  But now, with large swaths of Yemen under the control of the Shi'ite Zaidi \nHouthis, and with the country fracturing, Islamic State was exploiting the power chasm by making Yemen a terror \ntarget.  The fact that the suicide bombings ensued in Houthi-controlled Sanaa made clear that Islamic State was \ndeliberately targeting the Shi'ite rebels, whom they consider to be apostates.\n\nFor their part, the Houthi rebel movement (also known as Zaidis due to their Shi'ite Zaidi beliefs) had been engaged \nin fierce gun battles with Yemeni armed forces in 2014, ultimately gaining control of the capital of Sanaa and forcing \nthe resignation of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, whose supporters were resisting the Houthis from their base \nin Yemen's second city of Aden.\n\nIn the backdrop of these developments was a spate of vicious attacks by the Yemen-based terror group, al-Qaida in \nthe Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) as they railed against the perceived ascendancy of the Houthis. Angered by the \npolitical gains of the Houthis,  the  terror enclave, AQAP commenced a campaign of violence and bloodshed in \nresponse. These developments heralded an emerging power struggle between the Houthis and AQAP, with the \npeople of Yemen likely to be the ultimate victims. The main question in the immediate future was if this fight \nbetween the Houthis and AQAP would be limited to a power struggle for influence in Yemen where President Hadi \nwas being increasingly sidelined, or if it would metastacize into a civil war.\n\nThe developments in March 2015, marked by the entrance of Islamic State into the equation, served only to \ndestabilize the Yemeni landscape even further.  The situation was morphing into a geopolitical morass, with the \nadvance of the Iranian-backed Houthis on the second city Aden, the decision by President Hadi to flee the \npresidential palace, and the commencement of air strikes by Saudi Arabia on Yemen.\n\nMeanwhile, with Yemen embroiled in an escalating crisis, and as Western powers moved to distance themselves, \nregional powers were now signaling their entrance to the Yemeni landscape.  Already, Shi'a Iran was being blamed \nfor backing the Houthis.  But soon Sunni Saudi Arabia was warning that it would intervene into Yemen to act as a \ncountervailing power against Iran.\n\nPrince Saud Al Faisal promised to protect Yemen's sovereignty, saying,  \"We are against Iran's intervention in \nYemen ... it is actually an act of aggression... We are keen on protecting Yemen's sovereignty, the legitimacy of \nYemen represented by President Hadi.\" He continued,  \"We are ready to take the necessary measures if needed.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia's possible intervention was welcomed by the internationally-recognized Hadi government of Yemen.  \nPresident Hadi himself had called for the United Nations Security Council to authorize military intervention into \n\n\n\nYemen. Also of note was a call by the Yemeni foreign minister, Riyadh Yaseen, for Arab neighbors to assist \nmilitarily to stop the advance being made by  Houthi fighters.  He said, \"We have addressed both the [Gulf \nCooperation Council] and the U.N. for the need of [imposing] a no-fly zone and banning the use of warplanes at the \nairports controlled by the Houthis.\"  Of course, that intervention was aimed at stemming the advanceof the Houthis \nand not necessarily at addressing the terror threats posed by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula or Islamic State.\n\nIn the early hours of March 26, 2015, following  the news the day before that President Hadi had fled the \npresidential palace in Aden, Saudi Arabia announced it had commenced air strikes in Yemen.  In fact, Saudi Arabia \nsaid its military operation was being conducted in coordination with a coalition of several regional partner countries.  \nThe Saudi effort was aimed at stemming the Houthi tide  and restoring the internationally-recognized \"legitimate\" \nHadi government to the helm in Yemen. But with the Houthis -- a Zaidi Shi'ite rebel movement -- being backed by \nIran, and with Sunni Saudi Arabia now entering the fray, Yemen was quickly turning into a sectarian and geopolitical \nproxy war.\n\nNote that the United States soon announced that while it was not one of the partner countries carrying out air \nstrikes in Yemen, it was nonetheless providing logistical and intelligence support to the Saudi-led operation in \nYemen.\n\nAfter only a few days of air strikes, the Saudi-led regional forces had not yet overpowered the Houthis; however, \nthey were limiting movement of the Shi'ite Zaidi rebellion and were successfully imposing a naval blockade.  As \nMarch 2015 was coming to a close, Saudi and Houthi fighters were embroiled in fierce fighting along the Saudi-\nYemeni border.\n\nFighting was also taking place in Aden between Houthi fighters and pro-Hadi loyalist forces.\n\nAt the start of April 2015, despite the air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition, the Houthis were actually making gains \non the  southern port city of Aden -- the one time stronghold of President Hadi.  With fighting increasing, a \nhumanitarian crisis emerging, and the death toll increasing (almost 200 people were killed from late March through \nthe first few days of April 2015 alone), several countries began the process of evacuating its citizens from Yemen, \nwhile the Red Cross was bringing in humanitarian aid supplies.\n\nIt should be noted that in an interview with the Arabic television channel al-Arabiya Hadath, Yemeni Foreign \nMinister Riyadh Yasseen sanctioned the intervention of Arab powers into Yemen, calling for an actual Arab regional \nforce help restore the elected goverment of President Hadi to power in Yemen and save the country from its \nslippage into chaos.\n\nHe said, \"Yes, we are asking for that, and as soon as possible, in order to save our infrastructure and save \nYemenis under siege in many cities.\"\n\nEvidence of the Iranian-Saudi proxy war in Yemen was manifest in the second week of April 2015 when Iran called \nfor the formation of a new Yemeni government, and even said it would be willing to offer its assistance in Yemen's \npolitical transition.  The statement came at a time when the Iranian-backed Houthis advance on the city of Yemen.  \nFor its part, Saudi Arabia has been involved in air strikes on Yemen, with the intent aim of restoring President Hadi \n(who had taken refuge in the Saudi capital of Riyadh) to the helm of government.  It was apparent that the two \ncountries were not only a military collision course but also on a parallel political one.\n\nNote that on April 14, 2015, the United Nations Security Council imposed an arms embargo on the Iran-backed \nHouthis. The resolution was overwhelmingly backed by security council members, although Russia abstained from \nthe vote.\n\n\n\nAs the Yemeni conflict escalated, the United States dispatched an aircraft carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, \nand a guided-missile cruiser, the USS Normandy,  to the maritime waters close to Yemen.  The general consensus \nwas that the presence of the USS Theodore Roosevelt and the USS Normandy was for strategic reasons, and \nintended to ensure that the United States was positioned to take rapid action if the situation necessitated it.  For its \npart, the United States  Pentagon said that its presence in the Arabian Sea was not to intercept Iranian arms \nshipments to Yemen, but rather to  \"ensure the vital shipping lanes in the region remain open and safe.\"\n\nIn a surprise move on April 21, 2015, Saudi Arabia announced that it was ending its bombing campaign against the \nHouthis. Saudi authorities declared the joint alliance had  achieved the military goals of the operation.  An official \nstatement read as follows: \"Operation Decisive Storm has achieved its goals...(including) removing the threat to \nSaudi Arabia and neighboring countries, especially in terms of heavy weapons.\"  The joint alliance would thus \ntransition its efforts to a new mission called \"Restoring Hope.\" The new operation would be aimed at counter-\nterrorism and security, and would look towards a political resolution in Yemen. Nevertheless, Saudi authorities \nwarned that it reserved the right to go after the Houthis, with Saudi Brigadier General Ahmed Asseri saying, \"The \ncoalition will continue to prevent the Houthi militias from moving or undertaking any operations inside Yemen.\"\n\nYemen's internationally-recognized leader, President Hadi, offered his thanks for the Saudi-led regional effort, \nsaying, \"I express the deepest gratitude and respect to our Arab and Muslim brothers and friends in this exceptional \nstrategic alliance in my name and on behalf of the Yemeni people.\"\n\nWhile Iran welcomed the end of \"Operation Decisive Storm,\" the fact of the mater was that the fighting continued to \nplague Yemen, with around 1,000 people dying in the four week period from late March to the third week of April \n2015.  Indeed, Houthis and factions loyal to President Hadi continued to engage in battles across the country, while \ninfrastructure was being destroyed, and food and aid supplies were being depleted.  Accordingly,  there was an \nincreasing call for United Nations negotiations to resume, with an eye  on finding a peaceful political solution to the \nconflict in Yemen.\n\nFor their part, the Houthis intimated that a diplomatic process was underway, and there was an attempt to forge an \nagreement that would bring an end to the fighting.  But the Houthis  were unsure whether the Saudi announcement \nregarding an end to \"Operation Decisive Storm\" was part of that agreement.  Indeed, the news emerged on April \n22, 2015 that even though an end to \"Operation Decisive Storm\" was over,  Saudi-led strikes were still taking place \nin southern Yemen.  It seemed that a mission remained in place to protect the port city of Aden from the Houthis.  \nSaudi Arabian ambassador Adel al-Jubeir explained the situation, saying, \"When the Houthis or their allies make \naggressive moves there will be a response. The decision to calm matters now rests entirely with them.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Iran was calling for \"urgent humanitarian assistance\" in Yemen, with Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad \nJavad Zarif stating via the social media outlet Twitter, \"Positive developments in Yemen should be followed by \nurgent humanitarian assistance, intra-Yemeni dialogue and broad-based govt. Ready to help.\"  Iranian President \nHassan Rouhani  was meanwhile urging negotiations and a peaceful end to the bloodshed in Yemen, as he said, \n\"We believe that sustainable peace can prevail if military intervention is ceased and proper conditions are prepared \nfor talks and dialogue among all political groups.\" The Houthis themselves were signaling an interest in a return to \nUnited Nations-brokered negotiations, along with an end to the Saudis' aerial bombardment campaign.  Via the \nsocial media outlet Facebook, the Houthis' spokesperson, Mohammed Abdul-Salam,  declared:  \"We call for -- after \nthe complete cessation of the brutal aggression on Yemen and the total dismantling of the blockade on its people -- \nthe resumption of political dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations.\"\n\nAs April 2015 came to a close, the marine waters surrounding Yemen saw some de-escalation when the \naforementioned Iranian flotilla, which was believed to be carrying arms to the Houthis, sailed past Yemen  and to \nthe north.  The general consensus was that the presence of the USS Theodore Roosevelt and the USS Normandy \nin the area, may have had an effect. However, in a separate incident, Iranian forces fired warning shots and \nboarded a Marshall Islands-flagged cargo ship, the MV Maersk Tigris,  with a Danish crew in the Strait of Hormuz. \nThe vessel was reported to be following a normal commercial route between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab \n\n\n\nEmirates when the shots were fired, thus spurring the crew to issue a distress call that was picked by by United \nStates forces.  While Iranian authorities downplayed the incident, the United States Pentagon characterized the \nincident as a provocation.\n\nIn early May 2015, the hotspot in Yemen continued to be the southern city of Aden where Houthi fighters battled \nforces loyal to President Hadi, despite continued Saudi-led strikes.  The fighting was quite fierce with more than 120 \npeople killed on May 6, 2015, alone. Among the dead were people trying to flee the violence in a boat that was \nstruck by shelling from Houthi fighters.  The situation in Aden was quite dire with Houthis advancing in the historic \ndistrict of al-Tawahi -- the location of the presidential palace.\n\nMeanwhile, in the north, close to the border with Saudi Arabia, mortar and rocket fire killed five Saudi civilians, \nprompting retaliatory strikes by Saudi-led forces in that region.\n\nBy mid-May 2015, Saudi Arabia was reported to be sending a \"strike force\" to its own border zone  with Yemen.  \nThe move came after fierce artilery clashes with Houthi rebels in the area and was intended to reinforce the zone. \nAlso in mid-May 2015, Saudi Arabia was launching air strikes on Sanaa. One strike on a rocket base left 90 people \ndead and hundreds others injured. It should be noted that these strikes were ensuing weeks after Saudi Arabia \nannounced that it was ending its bombing campaign in Yemen, known as \"Operation Decisive Storm,\"  and only \ndays before a fresh ceasefire.\n\nIt was apparent that despite the intervention of regional forces, and occasional announcements of breakthroughs, \nthe Yemeni landscape continued to be one marked by chaos and turmoil in the spring of 2015.\n\nBy the start of June 2015, regional coalition forces, led by Saudi Arabia, were striking Houthi targets in Yemen, with \nscores of people dying as a result.  A significant number of the dead included women and children in their own \nhomes in the rural north of Yemen, close to the border with Saudi Arabia, which has long been the center of the \nHouthi rebellion.  Strikes were also  taking pace elsewhere in Yemen -- in Sanaa,  at Yemen's naval command  \nbase at the port city of Hodaida on the Red Sea,  at a customs office in the northern province of Haradh, and even \nin the\n\nsouthern city of Aden.\n\nDespite the fatal effects of the strikes on Houthi civilians, Saudi Arabia and its allies were resolute in their efforts to \nstabilize Yemen and return the country to a state of legal governance -- ideally with President Hadi at the helm.  In \nan interview with Reuters News, Khaled al-Attiyah, the  foreign minister of Qatar, agued that the Saudi-led coalition \nstrikes on the Houthis in Yemen had prevented the rebel movement from completely taking over the country.  He \nsaid, \"If there had not been (Operation) Decisive Storm, we would have seen the Houthis and Ali Abdullah Saleh's \npeople all over Yemen.  I think Decisive Storm ... has restored legitimacy in Yemen.\"\n\nIt would seem that Foreign Minister Khaled al-Attiyah's claims held some truth given the Houthis' interest in \nreturning to the negotiating table. Indeed, in the immediate aftermath of this latest spate of strikes, the Houthis were \nsignaling their willingness to participate in United Nations-sponsored peace talks in Switzerland set for June 14, \n2015.  Daifallah al-Shami, a member of the Shi'ite Zaidi leadership,  said in an interview with Reuters News  that the \nHouthi movement  was ready to support \"without preconditions the efforts of the United Nations to organize \nYemeni-Yemeni dialogue.\"  With rival groups, including those supportive of President Hadi and former President \nSaleh, also set to attend the peace talks, it seemed there was a genuine opportunity ahead to bring an end to the \nchaos rocking Yemen. South seccessionist factions, however, would not likely be in attendance and could function \nas the proverbial \"fly in the ointment.\"\n\n\n\nBy mid-June 2015, there were fews signs that United Nations-sponsored talks in Switzerland would produce \nanything substantial, or that the warring sides were willing to make the hard compromises needed for peace and \nreconciliation.\n\nOf note was the fact that as the talks were convened, the Saudi-led Arab coalition was striking Houthi targets in the \nYemeni capital of  Sanaa.  Also of note was the intransigence of the pro-Hadi wing and the Houthis respectively.\n\nWhile  Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed  - the United Nations envoy to Yemen -- cast the talks as an opportunity to end \nthe conflict in Yemen, he nonetheless acknowledged that a massive gulf divided the two sides.  He said,  \"All the \nparties are still barricaded behind their positions and continue to bet on war rather than a political settlement.\"\n\nIndeed, there was no reason for either side  to buy into the benefits of peace when  the  facts on the ground were \nas follows:  1. Despite an aggressive air campaign, the Saudi-led coalition had failed to dislodge the Houthis;  and \n2. Any peace agreement would likely be to the detriment of pro-Hadi forces in Yemen. For both sides, war offered a \nmore promising path to power.\n\nIn July 2015,\n\nSaudi authorities announced a ceasefire after air strikes hit a residential area of the Red Sea town of Mokha, killing \napproximately 120 people and injuring as many as 150 others.  Children were among the casualties, prompting the \nUnited Nations, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch to respectively warn the Saudi-led coalition that \nindiscriminate bombardment  of populated areas was a violation of international law.  It was not guaranteed that the \nSaudi-led coalition would  heed this admonishment; however, the coalition did respond to a call by Yemeni \nPresident Hadi  to halt the military activity long enough for humanitarian aid  to be rendered.  To this end, the \ncessation of the air campaign was to last for five days to allow emergency response teams to offer assistance and \nto deliver supplies to the victims.\n\nAlthough attention was focused at this time on the ceasefire,  the Saudi-led  coalition targeting the Houthis in \nYemen warned that it would, nevertheless, reserve the right to retaliate against any military activity taken by the \nHouthis.  Of related significance was that the ceasefire did not bring a complete end to hostilities.  Clashes erupted  \nin the city of Taiz as a result of shelling by  Shi'a Houthis rebels several districts.\n\nAs well, fighting was reported the the north of the restive port city of Aden and in the provinces of Marib  and Lahj.\n\nIn September 2015, with the sectarian conflict between  Iranian-backed  Houthis and  the Saudi-backed Hadi \ngovernment  forces still raging on, the landscape was complicated by the decision by Qatar to deploy 1,000 ground \ntroops to Yemen.  The move came ahead of a massive offensive operation by regional Sunni Arab forces against \nthe Iranian-backed Houthis who continued to hold sway in the Yemeni capital city of Sanaa.  Qatar was already part \nof the Saudi-led regional operation carrying out air strikes on Houthi-controlled regions of Yemen; however, its \ndecision to deploy ground forces marked a notable shift in a campaign that has been stalled for several months, \nalthough some progress was made in driving Houthis and forces allied with former President Salleh from Aden.\n\nIn the same period, Saudi-led air strikes continued to pound Houthi targets in Yemen.  The air battle  actually \nincreased in strength after a particularly deadly attack  in the first part of September 2015 when a Houthi missile \nattack killed scores of Gulf Arab troops stationed to the east of Sanaa.  In retaliation, the air strike campaign by \nSunni Arab states  on the capital  intensified and  deployments of troops were increased.  These developments \ncame ahead of an offensive operation discussed above, which was being  billed as a \"decisive battle to liberate \nSanaa.\" Of course, Saudi ground forces were already \"in country\" and carrying out an offensive in the province of \nMarib, aimed at driving out the Houthis.  The Sanaa offensive was to be understood as a continuation of that \noperation.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, even as plans for a final battle for Sanaa was in the works, the United Nations was planning to broker \npeace talks on the Yemeni crisis.  But those plans hit a snag in mid-September 2015 when Yemen's  government in \nexile, headed by President Hadi,  said it would not participate unless the Houthis withdrew from the terrain it \ncaptured. Of note was the fact that Hadi and his stalwarts were simply articulating the need to make good on  a \nprovision already enshrined in the prevailing United Nations Resolution 2216.\n\nA few days later, Yemen's exiled government modified its stance, saying it would  join the United Nations-\nsponsored talks, but under the condition that the  Houthis publicly accepted  the terms of the United Nations \nresolution, which called for them to withdraw from the main cities of Yemen and recognize Hadias the elected \npresident of the country. As noted by Yemeni government spokesperson Rajeh Badi in an interview with Reuters \nNews,  \"If the Houthis are serious about sitting down for negotiations about implementing resolution 2216, they \nmust publicly announce their recognition of this resolution.\"\n\nIn the last week of September 2015, the capital city of Sanaa was the site of bloodshed and violence due to double \nsuicide bombings at a mosque that left at least two dozen people dead and scores more seriously injured.  Islamic \nState claimed responsibility for the attack at the  al-Balili mosque, which ensued just as worshippers were \ncelebrating the Eid al-Adha festival.\n\nIn the same period of late September 2015, the Red Sea port city of Mocha was struck by tragedy when suspected \nair strikes hit a wedding party, killing at least 130 people.  The Saudi-led coalition operating in Yemen  and charged \nwith targeting the Houthi rebellion  quickly dismissed any charges of culpability as follows: \"There have been no air \noperations by the coalition in that area for three days. This is totally false news.\" Yet even as  the Saudi-led \ncoalition  denied any responsibility for the incident, there were few other plausible explanations for a fatal air strikes \nin the area.\n\nIt was unknown, however, as to whom was actually responsible for the deaths of more than 130 people at a \nwedding party.  Not surprisingly, the United Nations expressed condemnation for the incident, noting that the air \nstrikes were emblematic of  \"the disregard shown by all sides for human life\" in Yemen.\n\nOn October 6, 2015, members of the Yemeni government were targeted in a terror attack on the Qasr hotel where \nthey were staying in Aden.  Prime Minister Khaled Bahah and members of his government escaped the double \nbombing at the hotel unharmed.\n\nBut a series of attacks at two military installations housing coalition forces from the United Arab Emirates also took \nplace on the same day with different results.  The violence at the military outfits exacted a death toll as 15  pro-\ngovernment and Saudi-led coalition forces were killed.\n\nWhile initial blame for the spate of attacks fell on the Houthis, the terror group, Islamic State, soon claimed \nresponsibility.  Clearly the Islamist terror group was taking advantage of the power vacuum created as a result of \nthe power struggle between the Saudi-backed government and the Iranian-backed Houthis.\n\nMeanwhile, also in late September 2015,  President  Hadi returned from exile in Saudi Arabia to his stronghold in \nthe southern city of Aden.\n\nBy the start of October 2015, President Hadi's government moved to sever its diplomatic ties with Iran.\n\nWhile there was no detailed explanation offered for the move, the general consensus was that the legitimate \ngovernment of Yemen objected to Iran's backing of the Houthis, and viewed Iran's actions as overt acts of \ninterference in its sovereign affairs.\n\n\n\nOf course, as discussed here, the fact remained that several countries, including a Gulf Arab alliance, were now \nintervening into the affairs of Yemen.\n\nBy October 2015, there was a glimmer of hope on the turmoil-etched Yemeni landscape as the Houthi rebels finally \ncommitted to the United Nations-brokered peace process,  although it was not known if they officially accepted the \nterms of a prevailing United Nations resolution.\n\nIn a letter, the Houthi leadership declared: \"We, from our side along with other parties, commit to these seven \npoints as one unified bundle. We welcome the UN call for all sides to return to the table of dialogue.\"  At issue was \nthe seven-point Muscat peace plan that was forged in Oman and which stalled for some time, but was now being \nrevived with the Houthis signing on to the deal.\n\nShould the Houthis actually move forward by implementing the provisions of the Muscat agreement -- specifically,  \nenacting a ceasefire, withdrawing  from the cities, and accepting the return of the legitimate government to the \ncapital city of  Sanaa  -- Yemen could well be backing away from the precipice of the crisis that has rocked the \ncountry for some time.\n\nSpecial Report\n\nP5+1 multilateral negotiations result in historic framework deal on Iran's nuclear program; agreement marks a \nsignificant achievement in  diplomacy for the benefit of global security \n\nSummary:\n\nThe international community has been focused on aggressive multilateral negotiations  between Iran and the P5+1 \ncountries of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China, aimed at arriving at a \nlandmark nuclear deal.  At issue was the goal of forging an accord that would regulate Iran's nuclear program, its \nstockpile of enriched uranium, and curtail Iran's ability to develop a nuclear bomb.  For Iran, the objectives were \ntwofold.  First, Iran hoped to  prove that its nuclear development was for peaceful purposes and not aimed at \nweaponization, as charged by the West. Second, Iran was keen to end a painful international  sanctions regime that \nhas badly damaged Iran's economy.\n\nGoing back to January 2014,  an interim Iranian nuclear deal went into force. Under the terms of that interim \nagreement, Iran began the process of diluting its stockpile of  uranium enriched to 20 percent, with all such uranium \nexpected to be eliminated within a six-month period. There were also provisions for  inspections  at the Arak heavy \nwater reactor and the Fordo uranium enrichment site close to Qom.  While the interim deal constituted only a first \nstep in the diplomatic track, it was certainly a significant development in that process aimed at establishing an \nenduring accord. Indeed, it represented a sea change in Iran's relationship with the United States, which was \nactively evolving from one singularly marked by hostility to one of (albeit limited) engagement. Now, with a final \nnuclear deal at stake, it was to be seen if that engagement would be ultimately deemed productive.\n\nAt the end of March 2015,  the P5+1 multilateral talks with Iran were set to end, with all eyes on a framework for a \nlong-term agreement.  But the negotiations were mired by various sticking points, prompting the parties to extend \nthe negotiating process. Finally, in April  2015, after marathon talks, the P5+1 countries and Iran announced that \nthe hard work of negotiations and diplomacy had yielded results, and that a framework agreement on Iran's nuclear \nprogram had been reached. The agreement presaged a long-term deal, which would have to be made by the final \n\"hard\"  deadline on June 30, 2015.  The prevailing question  continued to dominate:  Could a final accord on Iran's \nnuclear program be forged?  Nevertheless, the framework agreement  marked a massive breakthrough in the realm \nof international diplomacy for the purpose of global security.\n\n\n\nPolitical resistance from rival Republicans and skeptical Democrats in the United States Congress and from Iran \nitself could upend the deal.\n\nNevertheless, new rounds of nuclear negotiations commenced later in the spring of 2015 with an eye on forging  a \nsustainable final accord.  That final agreement  finally emerged on July 14, 2015, and, as expected,  evoked \npassionate resistance from hardliners at home in Tehran, and in other capitals across the world, including \nWashington D.C.\n\nOver the course of the rest of July 2015 and then through August 2015, the Obama administration in the United \nStates was busy lobbying members of Congress to support the deal.  The goal was to gain enough support to \nsustain the expected presidential veto on a so-called \"disapproval resolution\" being advanced by Republicans in the \nlegislative chambers, with support from skeptical Democrats. Of course, the detrators of the deal were also doing \ntheir part to garner enough support to override the expected presidential veto.  But by the start of September 2015, \nall signs posted to a political victory for President Obama and his administration's diplomatic efforts.  Indeed, the \nObama administration garnered enough Congressional support for the deal. Debate and voting on the \"disapproval \nresolution\"  commenced in the second week of September 2015, with Democrats successfully blocking a vote in the \nSenate.\n\nNote: Regardless of the political dimensions, the Iranian nuclear accord was being celebrated as a historic \ndevelopment in the realm of international diplomacy and global security.\n\nSee below for the major developments leading up to the deadline for a proposed landmark accord.\n\nBackground:\n\nIn September 2013, as the United Nations meeting of the General Assembly in New York was set to take place, \nthere were plans afoot for a sideline meeting of the six world powers (generally known as P+5 composed of the \npermanent United Nations Security Council members -- the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, \nand China -- as well as Germany) with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif.  The main topic to be addressed would \nbe re-engagement on the Iranian nuclear issue. The meeting, which would include United States Secretary of State \nJohn Kerry, would mark the highest level bilateral contact between the United States and Iran in three decades.\n\nWhile the United States welcomed Iran's new tone and its interest in diplomacy, thanks to the election of the \nmoderate Hassan Rouhani to the Iranian presidency, authorities in Washington D.C. also made it clear that the \nproverbial  ball \"was firmly in Iran's court.\"  Of course, of significanc was the fact that Rouhani, upon his election, \nsaid that he rejected extremism of any kind, reminded people that his moderate political orientation was compatible \nwith Islam, and  vowed to fulfill his campaign promises. At the top of that list was Rouhani's commitment to end the \ntough sanctions against Iran, which were imposed due to the West's conviction that the Iranian nuclear \ndevelopment program was not entirely for peaceful purposes, and included nuclear weaponization ambitions.\n\nIt should be noted that in his own address to the United Nations, President Rouhani excoriated the harsh sanctions \nregime that was imposed on Iran, characterizing the sanctions as \"violent... pure and simple\"  He emphasized the \nfact that common people, rather than political elites, were the primary victims  of the sanctions.\n\nIt was apparent that President Rouhani's speech at the United Nations was not a continuation of the international \n\"charm offensive.\" Instead, it seemed that the speech was geared towards a domestic Iranian audience, intended to \nvalidate the economic suffering being suffered at home.  That being said, Rouhani's admission regarding the \ndamage done by the sanctions against Iran suggested that President Obama's \"smart sanctions\" policy was \nactually yielding results by forcing Iran from its former position of intransigence.  As September 2013 came to a \nclose, a remarkable shift on the geopolitical landscape occurred as United States President Obama and Iranian \n\n\n\nPresident Rouhani  shared a historic call, marking the highest level direct contact between the leaders of two \ncountries that have been in a state of enmity for decades.\n\nBy October 2013 and well into November 2013, landmark negotiations were under way to deal with Iran's \ncontroversial nuclear program and there were cautious hopes that an agreement might emerge. In November 2013, \ntalks ended without an agreement although there was concurrence that negotiations should be pursued, with an \neye on a deal in the future.\n\nEconomic Imperatives for Iran:\n\nThere were serious economic imperatives that could nudge Iran in the direction of productive negotiations.  Due to \nthe harsh international sanctions regime,  Iran has had to overcome steep obstacles in  selling its oil and receiving \npayments for its oil  exports. In places where Iran was still able to sell oil, it has been stymied from receipt of funds \ndue to prevailing sanctions, especially those levied by the United States. But if Iran was not able to sell its typical  \n2.6 million barrels of oil a day, or, if it was forced to  sell those barrels at deep discounts, the decreased revenue \ninevitably had a debilitating effect on the Iranian economy, adding to the possibility of social unrest.\n\nIn 2013, United States data sources indicated that the crippling sanctions imposed by the Western countries on \nIran  were exacting a heavy toll.  Indeed, these United States statistics showed Iranian oil exports tumbling to a 26-\nyear low.  The United States Department of Energy estimated that Iran's oil exports earned less than $70 billion \nbillion in 2012 -- a  27 percent decrease as compared with  $95 billion in 2011.  As well, the  International Energy \nAgency -- a  watchdog entity --  estimated Iran lost more than $40 billion in export revenues in 2012.\n\nWhile Iran was mitigating the effects of devolving oil exports via higher oil prices (at the time), and despite trying to \ncircumvent the sanctions on Iran's central bank by trading oil for goods, there were reports that Iran was storing an \nunusually large volume of oil in supertankers in the Persian Gulf.  This was due to dwindling purchasers from Asian \nmarkets.  As noted by the Financial Times, all expectations were that Iran would eventually have to  cut its already \nlow production, which would exacerbate its burgeoning economic crisis.  With Iranians feeling the pain of the \nsanctions  in the form of inflation, the sliding  value of its currency (the rial),  and high unemployment,  economic \nanxieties and public discontent characterized the socio-economic climate in Iran.\n\nIt was, thus, not surprising that the  newly-inaugurated President Rouhani's first speech at the helm included a call \nfor an end to the crippling sanctions against Iran. Of course, Rouhani had to be aware that those sanctions were \nnot about to dissipate without diplomatic progress and measurable policy changes as regards Iran's nuclear \nprogram.\n\nIt was to be seen how far Rouhani would be willing to go -- in terms of serious diplomatic engagement over its \nnuclear program --in order to lift Iran out of its dismal  state of international alienation.\n\nHistoric Diplomatic Shifts\n\nThe prospects for diplomacy -- or at least, for less hostile relations between Iran and the United States -- increased \nslightly in the third week of September 2013.  In an interview with NBC News,  Rouhani confirmed that United \nStates President Barack Obama had sent him a letter after his election as Iranian president. President Rouhani \ncharacterized President Obama's letter in positive terms, saying to NBC journalist Ann Curry, \"From my point of \nview, the tone of the letter was positive and constructive.\"  Earlier, the White House said explained the \ncorrespondence with spokesperson Jay Carney saying that the United States was \"ready to resolve the nuclear \nissue in a way that allows Iran to demonstrate that its nuclear program is for exclusively peaceful purposes.\"\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that during the interview with NBC News, Rouhani also said  his administration would never \ndevelop nuclear weapons.  Rouhani additionally dismissed speculation that he did not have the real political \nauthority to substantively address the Iranian nuclear development issue by emphasizing that he possessed the full \nauthority to forge a deal with the West.\n\nAs discussed here, by the second part of 2013, diplomatic engagement was under way, starting with the sideline \nmeetings at the\nUnited Nations General Assembly in New York  between Iran and the six world powers (generally known as P+5 \ncomposed of the permanent United Nations Security Council members -- the United States, the United Kingdom, \nFrance, Russia, and China -- as well as Germany).\n\nAhead of that landmark meeting, Iran seemed intent on softening its image on the world stage.  In addition to the \nIranian president signaling his interest in re-engaging in nuclear talks, Iranian authorities also pardoned and \nreleased 80 prisoners including leading opposition figures who have been persecuted and jailed in the aftermath of \nthe disputed presidential election of 2009 that gave rise to the failed \"Green Revolution.\"\n\nAfter the meeting, more news stunned the world. Of note was the fact that President Obama  had spoken directly to \nIranian President Rouhani on the phone as the Iranian leader was en route to the airport in New York. The call \ncould only be regarded as historic since it was the first direct contact between the leaders of the United States and \nIran in almost 35 years. According to President Obama himself, the 10-15 minute discussion focused on  Iran's \nnuclear program, and the conclusion reached was that there was a foundation for an agreement to be made.  As \nstated by President Obama, \"While there will surely be important obstacles to moving forward and success is by no \nmeans guaranteed, I believe we can reach a  comprehensive solution.\"\n\nFor his part, President Rouhani appeared eager to move forward, saying he hoped to reach an agreement on his \ncountry's nuclear program within a six-month period.  But perhaps more remarkable was President Rouhani's \ncomments about his conversation with President Obama that he chose to share via Twitter.  The Iranian leader \ntweeted: \"In phone convo, President #Rouhani and President @BarackObama expressed their mutual political #will \nto rapidly solve the #nuclear issue.\"  President Rouhani went further to note that he ended his call with President \nObama by saying  \"Have a Nice Day!\" to which President Obama responded by saying, \"Thank you. Khodahafez.\"  \nThe word, \"Khodahafez\" is Persian for \"May God be your Guardian.\"\n\nThis level of cultural respect and  amity between the leaders of two nation states that have been in a state of enmity \nfor more than three decades could only be regarded as stunning. Indeed, the fact that the Iranian president was \napprising the world of his conversation with the leader of the free world -- Barack Obama --  via social media \nshocked even the CEO of Twitter himself.\n\nDick Costolo issued the following observation, \"I feel like I'm witnessing a tectonic shift in the geopolitical \nlandscape reading @HassanRouhani tweets. Fascinating.\"\n\nIn the first week of October 2013, Iran's  supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, endorsed the historic diplomatic \nprogress made between his country and the United States.  Via the Internet, Khamenei said: \"We support the \ndiplomatic initiative of the government and attach importance to its activities in this trip.\"  However, Khamenei also \nexpressed skepticism that actual progress could be made, adding, \"We are pessimistic towards the Americans and \ndo not put any trust in them.\"  Nevertheless, the supreme leader's de facto endorsement bolstered the possibility -- \nhowever remote -- of bilateral progress and the possibility that a deal might, in fact, be reached on Iran's \ncontroversial nuclear program.  Not all hardliners in Iran were as amenable to the new political landscape as \nRouhani was met by protesters chanting \"Death to America\" when he arrived in Tehran from his visit to the United \nStates to attend the United Nations meeting of the General Assembly.  Still, he was also greeted by supporters \nclearly pleased about the shift in tone in regards to relations with the United States.\n\n\n\nDemands of the West:\n\nIt should be noted that the P5+1 countries have called on Iran to stop its production and stockpiling  of 20 percent \nenriched uranium (a capacity en route to the degree of enrichment needed to develop a nuclear weapon).  They \nhave also asked that Iran close its underground uranium enrichment facility at Fordo, close to the city of Qom, \nwhere most of the higher-grade enrichment is produced. Another demand entailed Iran ending its construction of a \nnuclear reactor in Arak. The United States was looking for verifiable evidence that Iran was taking action on such \nmeasures.  Should these actions be taken, the P5+1 countries said they would entertain the possibility of easing the \ncrippling sanctions regime that has terribly damaged Iran's economy.  That being said, it is worth noting that without \nthe pressure of this very crippling sanctions regime, it was hard to imagine that President Rouhani would have been \nelected to power in Iran in the first place, or that he would be engaging in diplomacy at all.  As such, the success of \nthe Obama administration's soft power approach of \"smart sanctions\" have to be acknowledged as the mean by \nwhich Iran was compelled to return to the diplomatic table.\n\nProductive Negotiations but no deal (yet):\n\nAs intimated above in the section titled \"Background\", the first tranche of nuclear negotiations commenced in \nOctober 2013 in the spirit of cautious optimism. Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said, \"We had very \nconstructive, very good exchange of views, very serious. It was, I can say, very businesslike.\"  However, Araqchi \nexpressed caution as he added: \"It's too soon to judge.\"  Michael Mann, a spokesman for European Union foreign \npolicy chief Catherine Ashton,  appeared to back that version of the landscape as he said there was a sense of \n\"cautious optimism.\" Mann later went further in suggesting that these were the first nuclear talks with Iran to go \nbeyond the superficial level. He said, \"For the first time, very detailed technical discussions continued.\"  Likewise, \nIranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton went so far as to \nissue a joint statement in which they characterized the talks as  \"substantive and forward-looking.\"\n\nIsrael showed little enthusiasm for the process with the government of that country releasing a statement that read \nas follows: \"Iran will be judged by its actions and not its PowerPoint presentations. Until we see practical steps that \nprove Iran is decommissioning its military nuclear project, the international community must continue with the \nsanctions,\"\n\nA fresh round of negotiations ensued in November 2013. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said progress was \nbeing made, despite the \"tough\"  nature of the talks taking place.  In an interview with Reuters News, Zarif said,  \n\"The talks went well ... I'm hopeful that we can move forward. We are making progress, but it's tough.\" Meanwhile,  \nMann characterized the progress at the meetings as \"good\" but refrained from offering further details.  Despite \nthese encouraging statements by Zarif and Ashton,  the meeting in Geneva  ultimately ended without an agreement \nbeing forged on Iran's nuclear program.  European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said, \"A lot of \nconcrete progress has been made, but some differences remain.\"  Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif took a \nmeasured tone in describing the failure to forge a deal when he said, \"I think it was natural that when we started \ndealing with the details, there would be differences.\"\n\nThere were some suggestions, however, that it was not only the granularity of the details in the proposed deal that \nappeared to have derailed the negotiations process, but dissonance within the negotiations group itself.  At issue, \naccording to emerging media reports, was France's objection to the framework agreement.  Specifically, France \nreportedly objected to the  deal, believing that it would not do enough to curtail Iran's uranium enrichment.  Another \nparticular bone of contention was the heavy-water reactor being constructed close to the city of Arak that would be \ncapable of produce plutonium. Of note was the fact that plutonium can be used as an alternate means  (vis a vis \nuranium) to produce a nuclear bomb.\n\n\n\nThere were also some fissures between the United States and the European countries on the matter of what \neconomic sanctions against Iran might be reversed as part of a proposal.  Since the United States Congress \ninitiated the harshest set of financial sanctions against Iran, and members of Congress were not in a mood to end \nthem, United States President Barack Obama was looking towards a fairly circumscribed proposal involving Iranian \nfunds frozen in overseas banks.  Sanctions by the European Union could more easily be reversed -- but to do so \nprecipitously could incur unwanted results, such as the challenge of reinstituting the sanctions if Iran did not fulfil its \nobligations in a future deal.\n\nTaken together, the news at the time was that these unresolved issues complicated the conclusion of a deal.  But it \nwas soon revealed that there was a third -- and significant -- element that led to the end of negotiations in  \nNovember 2013 without a conclusion.  According to United States Secretary of State John Kerry, the central reason \nfor the lack of an agreement was the fact that Iran had walked away from the deal on the table. This revelation \nseemed to supplement (perhaps even contradict) the conventional media reports that France's objections had \nderailed the deal-making process.  In fact, Secretary of State John Kerry made clear that the deal on the proverbial \ntable was approved by both France and the United States.  In statements to journalists, Secretary of State John \nKerry explained that Iran was not yet prepared to accept the proposal.  The United States top diplomat said, \"The \nFrench signed off on it, we signed off on it, and everybody agreed it was a fair proposal....Iran couldn't take it at that \nparticular moment; they weren't able to accept.\"  Secretary of State John Kerry added that, given time, he had high \nhopes that the Iran and the P5+1 countries could  \"find an agreement that meets everyone's standards.\"\n\nAccording to various sources, the main issue was not the Arak heavy-water reactor as had been suggested \ninitially; indeed, the real sticking point was the same central source of controversy throughout the years:  Iran's \ninsistence on its right to enrich uranium.\n\nAnother round of talks was scheduled to be held later in 2013.  Noteworthy was the fact that the new talks were of a \nlower level and would not involve foreign ministers.  Still, the fact that the parties were willing to continue the \nnegotiations suggested that there was an impetus to ultimately reach concurrence. For his part, Iran's top diplomat, \nZarif, emphasized the positive aspect, saying: \"What I was looking for was the political determination, willingness \nand good faith in order to end this.  I think we're all on the same wavelength and that's important.\"\n\nOf course, that \"same wavelength\" mentioned by Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif was cause for concern by Israel, \nwith that country's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, demanding that Iran relinquish all its uranium -- not just the \nuranium enriched to the 20 percent level discussed above -- and close the nuclear reactor at Arak. There was little \nlikelihood that Iran would agree to a  future deal involving the relinquishment of all its uranium, since such a move \nwould foreclose any its leverage on the world stage.\n\nThat being said, the international power brokers were taking Israel's demands seriously.  As stated by United States \nSecretary of State John Kerry, \"There are very strong feelings about the consequences of our choices for our \nallies...We have enormous respect for those concerns.\" United States Secretary of State Kerry also dismissed \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's excoriation of the proposed agreement as a \"bad deal,\" saying \ninstead, \"We are confident that what we are doing can actually protect Israel more effectively and provide greater \nsecurity.\"\n\nIAEA report bolsters diplomatic track:\n\nIn a positive sign that the diplomatic track was not being abandoned, the  International Atomic Energy Agency \n(IAEA) said it had actually reached an an agreement on cooperation with Iran aimed at resolving the concerns over \nits nuclear program. The head of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano,  explained that the agreement facilitated  inspections by \n\n\n\nthe United Nations' nuclear watchdog group to visit the aforementioned Arak heavy-water reactor as well as the \nGachin uranium mine.\n\nThen, according to the quarterly IAEA report released in November 2013, Iran seemingly stopped expanding its \nuranium enrichment capacity in recent months and added no  major components  to its potential plutonium-\nproducing reactor at Arak. Stated differently, Iran apparently \"paused\" its nuclear program for about three months.\n\nThe moves appeared to be geared towards bolstering the diplomatic track. As noted by  Thomas Erdbrink, the \nTehran bureau chief for the New York Times, via Twitter: \"For past three months Iran quietly essentially halted \nexpansion and seriously slowed down production in nuclear program, unprecedented since '03.\"\n\nKey findings of the report included the following:  Minor work was done on Arak reactor and access to heavy water \nplant was granted for first time since 2011; production of enriched uranium was reduced;  there were no new \ncentrifuges in Fordo although there were four in Natanz.\n\nOf course, despite these seemingly encouraging signs, there were also indications of Iranian intransigence. Indeed, \nthe report made it clear that Iran  was still forging ahead with some of its most controversial  nuclear activity, such \nas the enrichment of uranium to fissile concentration of 20 percent -- the \"problem\" level on the precipice of \nweapons-grade material.\n\nAs such, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized that he was \"not impressed\" by the so-called \nconcessions by Iran.  He said, \"They've got enough facilities, enough centrifuges to develop and to complete the \nfissile material which is at the core of an atomic bomb.\"\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, there remained a call for Iran to take much more significant steps in assuaging the \ninternational community of its peaceful nuclear ambitions, including the suspension of uranium enrichment.\n\nAccordingly, the report was reflective of the diplomatic landscape.  From the point of  view of Iran, it had made \nseveral concessions in the interest of finding a diplomatic solution; from the point of view of the West, the \nframework for agreement had to include the suspension of uranium enrichment.\n\nInterim breakthrough deal forged on Iranian nuclear program:\n\nA new round of talks in Geneva began at the end of November 2013.  This time, hopes of an agreement were now \nmore subdued due to the fact that the earlier negotiations had not ended as the diplomats had hoped.  Moreover, \nforeign ministers from the P5+1 countries were not present as they had been in the previous round of negotiations.  \nFor the moment, at least, the talks would go forward at a \"lower level\" of diplomatic engagement, although the goal \nremained the same: to forge a comprehensive accord on Iran controversial nuclear program.\n\nPresumably, progress was actually being made as United  States Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Geneva. \nThe presence of the United States top diplomat hinted towards the possibility that negotiations were moving in a \nproductive direction.  According to Jen Psaki, the spokesperson for the United States Department of State,  Kerry \nhad traveled to Geneva\n\nto \"help narrow the differences and move closer to an agreement.\"  She also indicated that the immediate objective \nwas to reach an agreement that would ensure a temporary freeze on Iran's nuclear program for a six-month period. \nThat halt would effectively give  negotiators more time to pursue a comprehensive accord on Iran's controversial \nnuclear program and to ensure that Iran was not allowed to build a nuclear weapon.\n\n\n\nLate in the evening on Nov. 23, 2013, Iran and the six world powers (the United States, the United Kingdom, \nFrance, Germany, Russia, and China)  announced that an interim breakthrough deal had been forged on Iranian \nnuclear program.  The announcement was made with great enthusiasm  by the foreign ministers of all of the \ncountries involved in the negotiations process. The landmark agreement would temporarily freeze Iran's nuclear \nactivities, even rolling back certain elements, in return for circumscribed sanctions relief.  The six-month halt would \nlay the foundation for a future accord by building confidence between sides who have little history of cooperation, \nand offering time to carry about the difficult task of drafting that agreement.\n\nBaroness Catherine Ashton, the European Union foreign policy chief, noted that the accord included \"reciprocal \nmeasures by both sides.\"  She explained that the terms of the agreement would be coordinated by the International \nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nThe central provisions of the deal were as follows:\n\n- Iran would  curtail its nuclear activities for an initial six-month period\n- Iran's uranium enrichment activities would be limited to levels below five percent purity -- the level needed to make \na nuclear bomb\n- Iran would neutralize its stockpile of near-20 percent enriched uranium (via dilution to less than five percent or \nconversion to a form that cannot be further enriched)\n- Iran would refrain from installing further centrifuges used to enrich uranium\n- Iran would ensure that at least half of the centrifuges at the Natanz and Fordo enrichment facilities were \ninoperable\n- Iran would halt work on the construction of its heavy-water reactor at Arak and refrain from  plutonium production \nthere\n- Iran would provide access to its nuclear facilities to international inspectors in order to verify that it was keeping its \ncommitments\n\n- In return for these moves, Iran would garner limited relief from sanctions and would not be subject to further \nsanctions for a period of six months\n\nIt should be noted that the sanctions relief included a suspension of restrictions on Iran's petrochemical exports and \ncertain other sectors such as gold and precious metals, thus yielding $1.5 billion in revenue.  As well, $4.2 billion \nfrom sales of Iranian oil would be allowed to be transferred in installments. Finally, there would be no new sanctions \nimposed on Iran for six months.\n\nFor his part, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said, \"This is only a first step.\"  He continued, \"We \nneed to start moving in the direction of restoring confidence, a direction in which we have managed to move against \nin the past.\"  Zarif also said the agreement presented an opportunity for the \"removal of any doubts about the \nexclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program.\"  Zarif was adamant that Iran had not relinquished its  right to \nenrich uranium, albeit within a framework for usage that met the requirements of the deal at hand.  He said, \"We \nbelieve that the current agreement, the current plan of action as we call it, in two distinct places has a very clear \nreference to the fact that Iranian enrichment program will continue and will be a part of any agreement, now and in \nthe future.\"\n\nThat latter issue could present a bone of contention since the United States emphasized that the deal forged in \nGeneva, in fact, held no reference to  an Iranian right to enrich uranium. That being said, the fact of the matter was \nthat this agreement was the first significant development in years on the issue of Iran's controversial nuclear \nprogram, which has periodically raised the specter of military actions.\n\nAccordingly, United Kingdom Foreign Secretary William Hague said the agreement was \"good news for the whole \nworld.\"  As well, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said, \"After years of blockages, the agreement in Geneva \n\n\n\non Iran's nuclear program is an important step to preserving security and peace.\" Meanwhile United States \nSecretary of State  John Kerry argued that the agreement would \"make our partners in the region safer.\"  He added, \n\"It will make our ally, Israel, safer.\"\n\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu had a very different view of the matter and angrily denounced the deal \nsaying, \"This is a bad agreement that gives Iran what it wanted: the partial lifting of sanctions while maintaining an \nessential part of its nuclear program.\"  Netanyahu also said that Israel did not feel bound by the agreement, thus \nsuggesting that his country might carry out its own unilateral action against Iran if it felt that action would be in the \nbest interests of Israel.\n\nRegardless of these threats by Israel, United States President Barack Obama welcomed the agreement, and \nemphasized that the terms of the deal included \"substantial limitations which will help prevent Iran from building a \nnuclear weapon.\"  As well, President Obama noted that Iran would be held to account on keeping the commitments \nset forth in the deal.  In a news conference, the United States president noted that if Iran violated the terms of the \nagreement, \"We will turn off the relief and ratchet up the pressure.\"\n\nObama and the Iranian deal --\n\nWhile the deal constituted only a first step in the diplomatic track, it was certainly a significant step on the path \ntowards rapprochement between the Islamic state of Iran and the West at large. Indeed, the accord represented a \nsea change in Iran's relationship with the United States in particular,  which was actively evolving from one marked \nby hostility  to one of engagement. It was to be seen if that engagement would be ultimately deemed productive.\n\nOn the issue of engagement, it should be noted that the United States and Iran had been carrying out clandestine \nface-to-face meetings over the course of the year -- beginning prior to the election of President Rouhani.\n\nAccording to a report by the Associated Press,  William Burns -- the United States Deputy Secretary of State --  and \nJake Sullivan -- the senior foreign policy adviser to Vice President Joe Biden -- convened meetings with Iranian \nofficials several times earlier in 2013, with some of their talks taking place in the country of Oman.  These meetings, \nwhich were authorized by United States President Barack Obama,  were kept hidden from United States allies, \nincluding Israel, until September 2013.\n\nOf key importance was the realization that this agreement with Iran was not simply a sudden development resulting \nfrom marathon negotiating sessions only in the month of November 2013.  Instead, the accord was the fruit of \nPresident Obama's vision of outreach to Iran, matched by time-consuming diplomacy, and  marked by several key \nconfidence-building steps aimed at dispelling the doubt, dissonance, suspicion, and even enmity that had, until this \ntime, characterized United States-Iranian relations.\n\nIndeed, the revelations about secret meetings with the Iranians gave weight to the view that Barack Obama had \nbeen serious when he advocated for direct negotiations with Iran back in 2008 during his campaign  for the \npresidency of the United States.  Barack Obama's outreach towards Iran was pilloried by hardline factions in the \nUnited States in 2008, although it was this policy of vigorous diplomacy that gained him support during the primary \nelection process from a United States citizenry weary from wars already taking place at the time in Iraq an \nAfghanistan.  Since becoming president, Barack Obama's \"smart sanctions\" approach to pressuring Iran was also \nsubject to complaint and criticism from conservatives in the United States political sphere, who were calling for a \nmilitary solution instead.\n\nIdeological differences aside, there was no debating the fact that it was the Obama administration's  imposition of \n\"smart sanctions\" that compelled Iran to come to the negotiating table in 2013.  In fact, \"smart sanctions\" may have \neven driven the Iranian  populace --  now tired of economic pressures such as inflation wrought by these punishing \n\n\n\nsanctions --  to select the most moderate of the presidential candidates  in that country's 2013 election.  Certainly, \nthe election of Rouhani in Iran appeared to have acted as an imprimatur for diplomacy and engagement by the \nIranian political establishment.\n\nIndeed, it was abundantly clear that despite the disapproval and criticism from hardliners and conservatives in the \nUnited States and Iran respectively, the diplomatic track was -- for the moment -- yielding results.  Of course, its \nultimate success was yet to be determined. That success would be affected by the question of whether or not the \nUnited States Congress pushed forward new sanctions against Iran.  While the Republican-led House of \nRepresentatives was likely to support such a move, the Democratic-led Senate was still considering the best course \nof action.  All expectations were that the Senate would likely wait for the passage of the six month period specified \nin the interim nuclear deal  before moving forward with fresh sanctions.\n\nFor his part, President Barack Obama shot back at his hawkish critics who opposed the recently brokered nuclear \ndeal with Iran, emphasizing that their rhetoric was good for politics but did little to advance national security.\n\nPresident Obama also emphasized the fact that he made no secret of his foreign policy agenda during his time as \nCandidate Obama, noting that he was keeping his campaign promises to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and \nto engage with Iran for the purpose of ensuring that country was not able to manufacture a nuclear bomb. During a \nvisit to California at the end of November 2013, he said, \"When I first ran for president I said it was time for a new \nera of American leadership in the world, one that turned the page on a decade of war and began a new era of our \nengagement with the world.\"  He continued, \"As president and as commander in chief, I've done what I said.\"\n\nThe United States president had a particularly direct response to his critics at home regarding the Iranian deal, as \nhe declared, \"Huge challenges remain, but we cannot close the door on diplomacy, and we cannot rule out peaceful \nsolutions to the world's problems. We cannot commit ourselves to an endless cycle of conflict... Tough talk and \nbluster may be the easy thing to do politically, but it's not the right thing for our security.\"\n\nThe president also emphasized the human cost of that \"endless cycle of conflict.\" Speaking of his visits to the \nWalter Reed National Military Medical Center where injured soldiers were treated for their war wounds, President \nObama said, \"I spend too much time at Walter Reed looking at kids -- 22, 23, 24, 25 years old -- who've paid the \nkind of price that very few of us in this room can imagine on behalf of our freedom, not to say that I'm going to do \nevery single thing that I can to try to resolve these issues without resorting to military conflict.\"\n\nHis words appeared to have found resonance with the American citizenry.  Although he was suffering from low \napproval ratings -- as was the case for all United States politicians from the two main parties -- President Obama's \nforeign policy approach to dealing with Iran was earning him high marks.\n\nAccording to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, Americans were backing the Obama administration's Iran deal by 2-to-1 margin.  \nAs well, the polling data showed a war-weary  American citizenry -- indeed, one mistrustful of the Iranians yet  \nhighly skeptical of further military action,  even if  the diplomatic track with Iran failed to yield positive results.  \nAccording to the poll, if the Iranian deal on the table were to fail, close to 50 percent of people preferred the notion \nof increased sanctions against Iran, 31 percent favored greater diplomacy, and a paltry 20 percent favored military \nforce against Iran.  Stated differently, despite strong Republican support for a hardline approach to Iran, there was \nactually no public appetite for it.\n\nThat being said, for President Obama, there was also the question of political legacy.  He could potentially enter \nhistory as the president who crafted a landmark deal with Iran, paving the way for greater global security -- or -- he \ncould be the president who allowed Iran to move further along the path to becoming a nuclear power in the world's \nmost volatile region.\n\n\n\nDate set for Iranian nuclear deal  to go into force:\n\nIn January 2014,  a date was set for the Iranian nuclear deal to go into force.  On Jan. 20, 2014, Iran would begin \nthe process of diluting its stockpile of  uranium enriched to 20 percent, with all such uranium expected to be \neliminated within a six-month period.  As well, there would be provisions for monthly inspections  at the Arak heavy \nwater reactor, and daily access made available to nuclear inspectors to the Fordo uranium enrichment site near the \nholy city of Qom.\n\nUnited States  President Barack Obama  applauded the news  of a \"go-forward\" date but also acknowledged that \nfurther effort was needed to forge a long-term deal. He warned that fresh sanctions would be afoot if Iran violated \nthe terms of the deal.  In a statement, President Obama said \"Beginning 20 January, Iran will for the first time start \neliminating its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium and dismantling some of the infrastructure that makes \nsuch enrichment possible...Meanwhile, we will continue to vigorously enforce the broader sanctions regime, and if \nIran fails to meet its commitments we will move to increase our sanctions.\"  Of course, it should be noted that the  \nvery deal could be thwarted by the effort of the United States Congress, which was preparing to impose additional \nsanctions.  For his part, President Obama made it clear that he would veto any legislation that advanced fresh new \nsanctions during the period  when there were ongoing negotiations with the Iranians.\n\nUnited States Secretary of State John Kerry  echoed President Obama's sentiments, as he lauded the \nimplementation of the nuclear agreement with Iran as a significant step, while also noting the difficulties in forging a \nlonger-term deal.  Secretary of State Kerry warned the next phase of negotiating a long-term nuclear agreement \npresented a \"far greater challenge.\"  He said, \"The negotiations will be very difficult but they are the best chance \nthat we have to be able to resolve this critical national security issue peacefully and durably.\"\n\nDevelopments related to the interim nuclear deal in 2014:\n\nOn Jan. 20, 2014, the landmark nuclear deal went into effect with Iran starting the process of curbing uranium \nenrichment. To this end, the IAEA confirmed that  Iran had ceased enriching uranium above five percent purity mark \nat both the Nantaz and Fordo facilities.  Meanwhile, the Iranian media was reporting that the centrifuges used for \nenrichment at the Natanz plant were disconnected.  As he announced this very process at Natanz, the head of \nIran's Atomic Energy Organization, Ali Akbar Salehi, said  \"The sanctions iceberg against Iran is melting.\" In \nexchange, the United States and the European Union would respond with limited sanctions relief.  Casting the \ncommencement of the agreement in positive light, Catherine Ashcroft, the European Union's foreign policy head, \nsaid, \"This is an important day in our pursuit of ensuring that Iran has an exclusively peaceful nuclear program.\"  A \nday later on Jan. 21, 2014, the IAEA said that  the first round of inspections went well and, as such,\n\nthere was a need to  double the size of the inspection team used to monitor nuclear activity.\n\nMoving forward to February 2014, the attention was on the negotiations aimed at finding a permanent resolution to \nIran's controversial nuclear program.  For the West, that hypothetical agreement would delineate the parameters of \nan acceptable  nuclear program for Iran and  alleviate their suspicions about Iran's ambitions to build a nuclear \nbomb.  For its part, Iran has consistently insisted that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only; however, \nIran has had a poor record of cooperating with the IAEA,  and its secretive activities at clandestine nuclear facilities \nhave only added to the West's anxieties.\n\nAs the P5+1 countries met in February 2014, the Iranian foreign minister acknowledged  that forging an agreement \nwould be difficult, but he also expressed optimism that a permanent deal was possible.  Iranian Foreign Minister \nMohammad Javad Zarif said, \"If all sides enter the talks with the political will, we will be able to reach positive \nresults. But it will take time.\"\n\n\n\nThe United States was more restrained about its stance, indicating that the negotiations had a 50 percent chance of \nsuccess -- and failure.\n\nOverall, the fact that Iran was actively involved in the diplomatic track  represented a sea change,  Indeed, Iran's \nrelationship with the United States was actively evolving from one marked by hostility to one of engagement. It was \nto be seen if that engagement would be ultimately deemed productive.\n\nThe IAEA noted at the start of March 2014 that although much work remained, Iran was nonetheless meeting its \nobligations to reduce its nuclear stockpile as required by the prevailing nuclear deal.  Of particular note was the \ndilution of its stock of higher-enriched uranium to a lower fissile concentration that would be unsuitable for making \nan  atomic bomb.  Yukiya Amano, the head of the IAEA, said that Iran had made enough progress to warrant \nreceipt of a March 1, 2014, installment of  funds previously blocked by sanctions (the total in this case would be \nabout $450 million).\n\nAt the same time, the West continued to pressure Iran to address its  suspicions over the design and manufacture \nof an atomic bomb -- activity Iran has insisted was not occurring.  The United States warned that Iran would have to \nsatisfy the West's doubts on this matter if they were to forge a final settlement over Tehran's nuclear program. As \nnoted by the United States' ambassador to the IAEA, Joseph Macmanus, \"It is a central element to this negotiation, \nand all parties recognize that.\"  Iran has shown some willingness in this regard, having agreed to provide answers \nin regard to the development of fast-acting detonators with both military and civilian applications.  The West, \nhowever, has cautioned that more effort must be expended by Iran.\n\nMultilateral talks in March 2014 were marked by a willingness to negotiate, juxtaposed against tensions due to \ndisagreements on the future of the Arak heavy water reactor that could potentially produce plutonium for the \nmanufacture of atomic bombs.  Another source of contention centered on the level of uranium enrichment to be \nconducted in Iran. There were no resolutions forged on these matters and the two sides simply agreed to meet \nagain in April 2014.\n\nMeanwhile, as the March 2014 talks were taking place, revelations emerged about  Iran's continued purchase of \nprohibited components links with the country's nuclear program.  According to Vann Van Diepen,  the Principal \nDeputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Non-Proliferation, said Iran was still forming front \ncompanies that were being used to conceal their nuclear procurement activities. In an interview with Reuters News, \nVan Diepen said, \"They still continue very actively trying to procure items for their nuclear program and missile \nprogram and other programs.\"  He added, \"We continue to see them very actively setting up and operating through \nfront companies, falsifying documentation, engaging in multiple levels of trans-shipment ... to put more apparent \ndistance between where the item originally came from and where it is ultimately going.\" While the purchase of such \ncomponents do not violate the recent breakthrough nuclear agreement (discussed directly above), they were \nnonetheless in contravention of the 2006 United Nations embargo that bans other countries from providing Iran with \nmaterials and supplies needed for a nuclear and missile development program. Iran had no comment in response \nto these allegations.\n\nIn April 2014, the world's nuclear watchdog group -- the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- announced  \nthat Iran had \"reduced its stockpile of higher enriched uranium by  half, in keeping with a prevailing nuclear \nagreement aimed at easing the harsh sanctions regime against Iran.  To be specific, Iran diluted half of its higher \nenriched uranium reserves to a fissile levels unsuitable for nuclear proliferation. As well, Iran has continued to \nconvert the other half of its stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium into oxide for making reactor fuel.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, the IAEA made note of the fact that the commissioning of a facility intended to \ntranspose lower enriched uranium into oxide powder had been delayed.  Of concern here was the fact that without \nsuch a facility in effect, Iran would be stockpiling greater quantities of low enriched uranium.  According to the IAEA, \n\n\n\nIran has said that it still intends to convert the uranium, irrespective of the plans for the construction of this particular \nplant.\n\nThese developments overall showed that Iran was making good on its promise to abide by its commitments \nenshrined in the deal.  In return, Iran was  incrementally gaining access to some of its previously frozen overseas \nfunds. Indeed, the United States Department of State soon announced that it was moving to release as much as \n$450 million in blocked assets in response to the IAEA assessment.  As well, there were reports that Japan has \nmade two more payments totaling $1 billion to Iran for crude oil imports.\n\nAt the start of July 2014, United States Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns was expected to participate in \nmultilateral negotiations in the Austrian capital of Vienna aimed at finalizing a long-term nuclear deal  by July 20, \n2014.  Burns' participation indicated the possibility of bilateral negotiations  between the United States and Iran on \nmatters beyond the nuclear politics, quite possibly touching upon the security crisis rocking Iraq at the hands of \nSunni extremist terrorists.\n\nWith an eye on facilitating a productive path, it was  soon announced that United States Secretary of State John \nKerry, along with the foreign ministers from  the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia and China, would be \njoining the negotiating table.  The presence of the six foreign ministers from the P5+1 nation states was not \nnecessarily a sign that a long-term deal to resolve concerns over Iran's nuclear could be reached by the July 20, \n2014, deadline. Instead, the conventional wisdom remained that  an extension of the existing deal was likely \nnecessary, but to even reach that point, the distance between negotiating positions had to be narrowed.  The \nparticipation of the top diplomats from the P5+1 nation states  was more than likely aimed at narrowing that gap.\n\nBy July 14, 2014, following the conclusion of this round of nuclear talks in Vienna, United States Secretary of State \nJohn Kerry made clear that if Iran wanted to secure a long-term agreement with the world powers and bring an end \nto damaging sanctions, it would have to reduce  its capacity to make nuclear fuel. In an address to the media, \nSecretary of State Kerry said, \"We have made it crystal clear that the 19,000 (nuclear centrifuges) that are currently \npart of their program is too many.\"\n\nFor its part, Iran was attempting to advance an alternative path with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad \nZarif suggesting that Iran might keep its enrichment program at existing levels  for a few years (essentially an \nextended \"pause\"), while also holding onto the 19,000 centrifugs it had installed for an industrial-scale uranium \nenrichment program.  However, the P5+1 countries were not as interested in that type of concession as they were \nseeking to ensure that Iran simply did not pursue nuclear fuel needed for the manufacturing of a nuclear bomb.  In \nfact, as noted by United States Secretary of State John Kerry, the  very notion that Iran  would be able to keep all of \nits existing centrifuges was simply \"out of the question.\"\n\nWhile it was not clear that there would be a meeting of the minds on the actual path forward, both sides seemed \nearnest in their efforts to advance the negotiations with Kerry saying, \"It is clear we still have more work to do and \nour team will continue to work very hard to try to reach a comprehensive agreement that resolves the international \ncommunity's concern.\"  He added, \"There are more issues to work through and more provisions to nail down to \nensure that Iran's program can always remain exclusively peaceful.\" Zarif's comments echoed a similar tone as \nKerry's as the Iranian foreign minister saying, \"I see an inclination on the part of our negotiating partners that they \nbelieve more time may be useful and necessary.\"\n\nAs expected, on July 18, 2014, it was announced that the deadline for reaching a deal on Iran's nuclear program \nwould be extended for four months until November 2014.\n\n\n\nThe extension would provide all parties with more time to engage in nuclear negotiations, with the goal of achieving \na final deal by Nov. 24, 2014. A joint statement issued by the European Union foreign policy chief, Catherine \nAshton,  and Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, read as follows: \"There are still significant gaps on \nsome core issues which will require more time and effort.\"\n\nDuring the four-month extension period, most sanctions against Iran would remain in place; however, Iran would be \npermitted to access an additional $2.8 billion of its frozen assets.  United States Secretary of State John Kerry said \nthat in exchange for the access to these funds, Iran would continue to use its most problematic stores of uranium \n(those enriched to a level of 20 percent) for  a research reactor that is used to make medical isotopes. Kerry also \naddressed the contentious issues requiring more negotiations as he said, \"There are very real gaps on issues \nsuch as enrichment capacity at the Natanz enrichment facility. This issue is an absolutely critical component of any \npotential comprehensive agreement. We have much more work to do in this area, and in others as well.\"\n\nNOTE: As of 2015,  a final agreement had been forged, as discussed below.\n\n2015 Update on Nuclear Negotiations:\n\nAs of March 2015, despite a diplomatic contretemps between the United States and Israel over multilateral nuclear \nnegotiations with Iran, the diplomatic process was ongoing.\n\nThat contretempts reached new heights on March 3, 2015, when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  went \nto Capitol Hill in the United States to give an address to Congress. In that speech, he warned that the nuclear deal \nbeing negotiated by global powers and Iran in Geneva, Switzerland, would actually herald a nuclearized Iran.  To \nthis end, he said, \"This deal doesn't block Iran's path to the bomb, it paves Iran's path to the bomb.\" Disparaging \nthe efforts being carried out by United States Secretary of State John Kerry and his counterparts from the United \nKingdom, France, Germany, Russia and China,  Netanyahu said: \"We've been told that no deal is better than a bad \ndeal. Well this is a bad deal, a very bad deal.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, the Israeli leader had harsh words regarding Iran, reminding the chamber -- and the worlds -- that \n\"Iran's regime is as radical as ever, the ideology is deeply rooted in militant Islam... it will always be an enemy of \nU.S.\"  He also noted that the Iranian imprint was growing in the Middle East, as it meddled in the affairs of countries \nsuch as Iraq and Yemen, while backing Lebanon-based Hezbollah.  To this end, Nentanyahu said that Iran was on \na \"march of conquest, subjugation and terror.\"\n\nNetanyahu's speech, despite the boycott by as many as 60 Democrats, was well-received by the Republican-\ndominated Congress.  Indeed, Republicans in Congress made a point to giving the Israeli leader a far warmer \nreception, with more boisterous applause than had been conveyed to President Barack Obama at the State of the \nUnion less than two months earlier.\n\nFor its part, the White House blasted the Israeli prime minister's address as being filled by rhetoric and short of \ngood ideas. As noted by President Obama himself after the Netanyahu visit to Capitol Hill, \"On the core issue, \nwhich is how to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon which would make it far more dangerous, the prime \nminister [Netanyahu] did not offer any viable alternatives.\"\n\nNevertheless, the fact of the matter was that Netanyahu's address was a political success that would likely help him \nwith hardline voters at home, while currying favor with hardliners across party lines in the United States.  Of course, \nit was more difficult to ascern whether the Netanyahu speech was necessarily in the best interests of the United \nStates.\n\n\n\nThe reality was that without an agreement of some sort, Iran would likely move forward with the pursuit of its \nnuclear program, which could potentially involve bomb production. Indeed, it was only the interim nuclear deal (set \nto expire in mid-2015), which created the space for nuclear negotiations to take place, that had brought any halt to \nIranian nuclear acitivites.  Before the interim agreement was forged, despite the imposition of harsh sanctions, Iran \nwas producing centrifuges and fissile material. Without a nuclear accord going forward, Iran would be free to \nresume unfettered nuclear activities.\n\nOf note was the fact that President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu have viewed the Iranian nuclear problem \ndifferently.  For President Obama, the imperative has always been the same: To prevent Iran from producing a \nnuclear bomb.  But for Prime Minister Netanyahu, the objective has been to prevent Iran from having nuclear \ncapability.  While the two respective goals overlap, they must be understood distinctly.\n\nA good deal for President Obama would be one in which Iran's nuclear program is curtailed, regulated, and \nmonitored to the extent that its breakout time for creating a bomb would be lengthy and difficult.  No deal would \nlikely be acceptable to Prime Minister Netanyahu, who was determined to see Iran's nuclear capability ended in \ntotality, and all of its nuclearfacilities dismantled.  Short of military action, it was difficult to see how Netanyahu's \ngoals would be accomplished.  But even military strikes would  be risky since multiple sites -- from the uranium \nenrichment plants at Natanz and Fordo, to the heavy-water plutonium reactor at Arak, not to mention an array of \nlaboratories and mines at stake.\n\nOf significance was the fact  that the very case by Israel (at least, as conveyed by Netanyahu) was being tarred by \nquestions of credibility.  At issue was the release of a cache of confidential intelligence documents that appeared to \ncontradict Netanyahu's claims about Iran being imminently positioned to manufacture a nuclear bomb.  Leaked \ncables -- reportedly from South African intelligence. but which were shared with certain news outlets -- indicated \nthat in an address before the United Nations in 2012, the Israeli leader misrepresented Iran's progress on nuclear \ndevelopment, and even contradicted Israel's own Mossad secret service to make that claim.\n\nGoing back to 2012, Netanyahu famously stood before the United Nations General Assembly with a cartoon \ndepiction of a bomb with a red line and declared that Iran would be positioned to build a nuclear weapons the \nfollowing year.  As such, he demanded global action to prevent Iran from achieving that end.  Now, however, in \n2015, the leaked documents, whch were shared with Al-Jazeera and published by The Guardian newspaper,  \nincluded conclusions from Israel's own Mossad intelligence agency that Iran was \"not performing the activity \nnecessary to produce weapons.\"  The Mossad briefing did note that Iran appeared to be moving in a direction \n\"which will reduce the time required to produce weapons.\"  However, the Mossad briefing also asserted that Iran \n\"does not appear to be ready\" to enrich uranium to the higher levels necessary for nuclear weapons.  (The \nmanufacture of a nuclear bomb would require enrichment of 90 percent.)\n\nIt should be noted that in response to the revelations ensconced in these leaked documents, the Israeli government \nsaid there was little difference in Netanyahu's claims as compared with Mossad's findings.  Both agreed  that Iran \nwas indeed seeking to manufacture a nuclear bomb.\n\nRegardless of Iran's actual intent or the actual timeline at stake, the difficult diplomatic work of trying to forge an \nagreement that would prevent Iran from producing a nuclear weapon was ongoing.\n\nIt should be noted that in the aftermath of the Netanyahu speech, United States Secretary of State John Kerry \nwarned that simply demanding Iran's capitulation was unlikely to compel that country to voluntarily halt its nuclear \ndevelopment program.  Kerry's remarks intimated criticism for the muscular language emitted by the Israeli leader, \nwhich were heavy on rhetoric but unlikely to achieve actual results. Instead, Secretary of State Kerry noted that the \ndiplomatic path presented a serious path forward.  He said,  \"No one has presented a more viable, lasting \n\n\n\nalternative for how you actually prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. So folks, simply demanding that Iran \ncapitulate is not a plan. And nor would any of our P5+1 partners support us in that position.\" At the same time, \nSecretary of State Kerry made clear that the while the hard work of diplomacy was yielding results, there remained \n\"significant gaps and important choices that need to be made\" by Iran.\n\nIn Iran, President Hassan Rouhani emphasized his country's position. Rouhani indicated that Iran was prepared to \nsubject itself to greater scrutiny, in order to satisfy the international community's concerns about nuclear weapons \nproduction.  But at the same time, he reiterated Iran's long-standing stance that it was entitled to nuclear \ndevelopment.  Rouhani said, \"If the basis of these negotiations is for increased transparency, we will accept greater \ntransparency. But if the negotiations are trying to prevent the people of Iran from their inalienable right, in other \nwords advancement in science and technology, it is very natural that Iran will not accept such an understanding or \nagreement.\"\n\nOf course, concerns about Iranian nuclear development, and a potential nuclear deal, extended not only to Israel \nbut also to the Sunni Arab world.  Of note was the ever-increasing sectarian divide between Shi'ites and Sunnis in \nthe Middle East since the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the Arab Spring in 2011. With this schism only deepening, \nSunni countries, such as Saudi Arabia, were increasingly concerned about an ascendant Shi'ite Iran.  Indeed, Iran \nalready had its imprint in the Syria-Lebanon area due to tacit support of Hezbollah, and had tightened its alliance \nwith Iraq in the post-Saddam Hussein era, and was now believed to be clandestinely backing the Shi'ite Zaidi \nrebellion (known as the Houthi rebellion) in Yemen.  The notion of a nuclearized Iran, already with its tentacles \nstretching across the region, was not regarded positively by several Arab countries. Accordingly, Secretary of State \nKerry traveled to Saudi Arabia to calm the anxieties of several Sunni Arab countries, including  Bahrain, Kuwait, \nOman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia itself, regarding a potential Iranian nuclear deal.\n\nSpeaking to this issue, Secretary of State Kerry said, \"For all the objections that any country has to Iranian \nactivities in the region, and believe me, we have objections and others in the world have objections, the first step is \nto prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\"  At stake was the goal of reaching the \"right deal,\" which Kerry \nsaid would  \"close off any paths that Iran could have towards fissile material for a weapon.\"\n\nTo that end, the diplomatic track was continuing and the latest round of multilateral talks -- involving the United \nStates, the United Kingdom, France,  Germany,  Russia, and China -- appeared to be making progress, with all \neyes on late March 2015 as a possible timeline for a deal, with the details ironed out and solidified by a mid-2015 \ndeadline.\n\nUnited States Secretary of State John Kerry indicated that the negotiations were productive, saying to the media: \n\"We made progress.\"  His Iranian counterpart, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif,  said they were forging \"a \nbetter understanding\" at the negotiating table.\n\nThe comprehensive pact appeared to be geared towards constraining Iran's nuclear breakout capability, and \nrestricting Iran's nuclear activities for a 10-year period, with an easing of restrictions on nuclear development after \nthat time. Under consideration was a plan to deal with most of Iran's enriched uranium externally, or to convert it to \na form that would not be easily used in weapons development.  Overall, there would be strict curbs on Iranian \nnuclear development for a decade, particularly with regard to the handling of enriched uranium and the number of \ncentrifuges at stake.  But there would also be \"rewards\" of sorts  for Iranian compliance and cooperation in the form \nof gradually eased restrictions and the lifting of sanctions.  The United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency, the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, would play a central role in any proposed deal, and  would have the primary \nresponsibility of monitoring Iran's compliance and cooperation.\n\n\n\nIn the second week of March 2015, in the wake of the controversial Netanyahu address to Congress, 47 Republican \nsenators published an open letter to Iran.  The  signatories to that document sought to instruct the Iranian \ngoverment about United States constitutional law, which they suggested the Iranians might not \"fully understand.\" \nThe letter, which was spearheaded by freshman Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, made the claim that  \nany nuclear deal that might emerge from the negotiations in Switzerland would be \"nothing more than an executive \nagreement between President Obama and Ayatollah Khamenei,\" and thus require congressional approval while \nbeing subject to revocation by a future president.  To this end, the letter included the following sentence: \"The next \npresident could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen, and future Congresses could modify \nthe terms of the agreement at any time.\"\n\nIt was difficult to interpret the missive as anything other than a transparent attempt to undermine President Barack \nObama's leadership in the realm of foreign policy. Indeed, editorials from more than 22 cities across the country \nexcoriated the 47 Republican senators for their action, which they characterized as a reckless and partisan stunt. \nSome newspaper boards even argued that by dispatching that missive, te 47 Republican senators were marching \nthe country down the road of war.  Almost all the editorials vociferously criticized the 47 Republican senators for \nbetraying the national interests of the United States, whose constitution, accords broad authority to the president to \nconduct foreign policy.\n\nFrom the Senate,  Minority Leader Harry Reid -- the top Democrat in the upper chamber -- minced no words as he \ndeclared: \"Let's be clear: Republicans are undermining our commander in chief while empowering the ayatollahs.\" \nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was expected to seek the Democratic nomination for president in \n2016, entered the fray, saying that the letter's signatories could only be motivated by one of the following two \nrationales. She said, \"There appear to be two logical answers. Either these senators were trying to be helpful to the \nIranians or harmful to the commander-in-chief in the midst of high-stakes international diplomacy. Either answer \ndoes discredit to the letter's signatories.\" White House spokesperson, Josh Earnest, said the letter was intended to \nundermine diplomacy and could spur a \"rush to war, or at least the rush to the military option.\"\n\nFor his part, President Barack Obama responded to the infamous letter by accusing the 47 Republican senators of \n\"interfering\" in nuclear negotiations -- an arena typically reserved for the executive branch of government.  He also  \nsardonically noted that the 47 signatories constituted an \"unusual coalition\" with Iran's hard-line religious leaders, \nwho have also opposed the nuclear negotiations.  As noted by President Obama: \"I think it's somewhat ironic to see \nsome members of Congress wanting to make common cause with the hardliners in Iran. It's an unusual coalition.\"  \nVice President Joe Biden -- a former Senator himself and the official president of the upper chamber -- was more \nvituperative in his condemnation. Vice President Biden said that the letter from the 47 Republicans was \"beneath \nthe dignity of an institution I revere.\" He added, \"In 36 years in the United States Senate, I cannot recall another \ninstance in which Senators wrote directly to advise another country -- much less a longtime foreign adversary -- that \nthe president does not have the constitutional authority to reach a meaningful understanding with them,\"\n\nOf significance was the reaction by the Iranian Foreign Minister, Dr. Javad Zarif, who dismissed the letter as a \n\"propaganda ploy.\" Zarif said, \"In our view, this letter has no legal value and is mostly a propaganda ploy.  It is very \ninteresting that while negotiations are still in progress and while no agreement has been reached, some political \npressure groups are so afraid even of the prospect of an agreement that they resort to unconventional methods, \nunprecedented in diplomatic history.  This indicates that like Netanyahu, who considers peace as an existential \nthreat, some are opposed to any agreement, regardless of its content.\"\n\nEducated in the United States himself, the Iranian foreign minister did not shy away from showing his own \nconstitutional chops, intimating that the Republican Senators who signed onto the letter may not been fully \nconversant with the United States Constitution. To this end, Zarif said, \"A change of administration does not in any \nway relieve the next administration from international obligations undertaken by its predecessor in a possible \nagreement about Iran's peaceful nuclear program.\"  Zarif also noted that a move by a future president to dismantle \na yet-to-be-achieved nuclear agreement would be in contravention to international jurisprudence, saying, \"I wish to \n\n\n\nenlighten the authors that if the next administration revokes any agreement with the stroke of a pen, as they boast, \nit will have simply committed a blatant violation of international law.\"\n\nTo be sure, the letter from the 47 Republican senators emphasized the view that any deal would have to be ratified \nby the upper house of the Congress.  However, both Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif and United States Secretary of \nState John Kerry pointed out that the vast majority of international agreements forged in recent decades have been  \nexecutive measures and not treaties requiring ratification by the Senate.\n\nMoreover, any deal emerging from the nuclear talk would be neither a bilateral agreement nor a conventional treaty \nbetween nation state.  Instead, it would be a multilateral accord, forged by the P5+1 countries, including all \npermanent members of the United Nations Security Council. The accord would likely activated as a Joint \nComprehensive Plan of Action, then sealed under the aegis of the United Nations Security Council, and thus would \nin fact not be subject to modification by Congress. In this regard, it would be follow on the heels of United Nations \nSecurity Council Resolutions 1696, 1737, 1747, 1803, 1835, and 1929 that have also dealt with Iran's nuclear \nprogram.  Neither a Republican-controlled Senate  nor a future president would be positioned to unilaterally  \nreverse the terms of a potential accord of this sort.\n\nCongress, with its power of the purse, could certainly  place certain limits on President Obama or any future \npresident as regards sanctions to be levied upon Iran (or any other country).  However, Congress cannot summarily \noverride international obligations forged in a multilateral frame, and which would be structured as an international \nmeasure, without  being in  flagrant breach of international law.\n\nBeyond the legal perils at stake, there were political perils to consider. The fact of the matter was that any post-\nObama president would be placed in a precarious position within the world community for violating an agreement \nreached and understood as a matter of international consensus.\n\nMeanwhile, there were rumblings in regards to violations of domestic law when some observers noted that the letter \nto Iran could be regarded as a violation of the 18th century Logan Act.\n\nTo be precise, the Logan Act prohibits any \"Private correspondence with foreign governments\" and reads; \"Any \ncitizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly \ncommences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent \nthereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent \nthereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United \nStates, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\"  In truth, it was unlikely that \na law dating back to 1799 would be used to prosecute the 47 senators; however, its discussion has only added to \nthe level of scandal and drama surrounding a potential landmark multilateral agreement on Iran's nuclear program.\n\nReturning to the issue of the prevailing nuclear negotiations -- the fact of the matter was that nuclear talks \ncontinued in Switzerland in the third week of March 2015. The principal parties acknowledged that progress was \nbeing made, particularly with regard to technical provisions.  Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy \nOrganization, expressed delight over his productive meetings with United States Energy Secretary Earnest Moniz, \nsaying, \"We have made progress on technical issues. One or two issues remain and need to be discussed.\"  For \nhis part, Secretary of State Kerry said, \"We're pushing some tough issues but we made progress.\"\n\nHowever, other Western representatives had a different view. A State Department official told Reuters News, \"We \nare pretty far away. There are a lot of issues that still need to be resolved. The Iranians must make substantial \nconcessions.\"  Moreover, as reported by Reuters News, an anonymous European negotiator said: \"Contrary to \n\n\n\nwhat the Iranians are saying with regard to 90 percent of an accord being done, that's not correct.  We are not \nclose to an agreement.\"\n\nClearly, another round of talks was anticipated to resolve a slate of remaining issues.  Of note was the West's \ninsistence that Iran's nuclear activities be curtailed and its nuclear breakout time be circumscribed to one year.  \nStated differently, an arrangement had to be made whereby Iran would need a full year to garner enough fissile \nmaterial (either high enriched uranium or plutonium before it could produce a nuclear weapon.  On the agenda for \ndiscussion was a plan to limit the  number of enrichment centrifuges Iran would be allowed to keep; other \nconsiderations included limits of the size of uranium stockpiles.\n\nNote that on March 21, 2015, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani indicated that progress was being made in nuclear \ntalks, setting the stage for a final deal.  He was quoted by Iranian state media as saying. \"There is nothing that \ncannot be resolved.\"  Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, however, emitted a very different tone from that of Iran's more \nmoderate president, Rouhani. In reference to President Obama's Persian Nowruz message to the Iranian people, in \nwhich the United State leader said a deal on Iran's nuclear program presented \"an historic opportunity to resolve \nthis issue peacefully,\"  Ayatollah  Khamenei  said that his country should not submit to the demands of the global \npowers. Khamenei noted, \"Basically, what he [Obama]  says in his message is that you must accept the terms we \ndictate in the nuclear talks so that jobs, investment, and economic activities will blossom in your country... this view \nwill never lead to any conclusions for us.\"  In many senses, Obama and Rouhani were in similar positions -- both \nwere pragmatic presidents, both were eager to improve bilateral relations between their countries, while meeting \nglobal security goals, yet both men were also politically at odds with the conservative and hardline elements in their \nown countries.\n\nDays later, the landscape for negotiations could only be understood as uncertain.  The various sides appeared to \nbe deadlocked over certain sticking points. France was looking for more stringent restrictions on the Iranians -- a \nposition by France that was at odds with the other P5+1 countries.  Also at issue was the fact that France was not \nkeen on the notion of a quick suspension to United Nations sanctions against Iran -- a demand being made by the \nIranians.  Meanwhile, the United States was advocating that restrictions on Iranian nuclear work should be in place \nfor at least 10 years, while France was looking for a 15 year timeline, along with 10 years of rigorous IAEA \nmonitoring. Other contentions centered on Iran's demand that it be allowed unfettered research and development of \nadvanced centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium for use in nuclear reactors, and ultimately are linked with \nweapons production.\n\nNegotiations in mid-March 2015 abruptly ended when the Iranian delegation announced they were returning to \nTehran because President Hassan Rouhani's 90-year-old mother had died.  The break in negotiations was not \nbeing regarded as problematic; instead, all sides seemed to agree that talks would resume at the end of March \n2015.\n\nThe fact of the matter was that  significant issues remained unresolved with Iran and the P5+1 countries far apart \nin some regards.  Still, the consequences of not reaching a deal would likely destablize the world; as such, the \nimpetus for forging an agreement was strong and all expectations were that the March 2015 deadline would be \nextended again to give the negotiations process further time and space.  For all the players, the March 30, 2015, \ndeadline to reach a political framework agreement was not one to be held in stone.  Instead, they were looking at \nthe June 30, 2015, deadline for a final deal as being more pertinent.\n\nBroken negotiations or breakthrough deal?\n\n\n\nAt the end of March 2015,  the P5+1 multilateral talks with Iran were set to end, with all eyes on a framework for a \nlong term agreement.  But the negotiations were mired by various sticking points, prompting the parties to extend \nthe negotiating process.\n\nAt issue were freshly emerging objections by Iran to the notion that it would ship its enriched uranium out of the \ncountry, where it would be unavailable for potential weaponization purposes.  Since a potential Iranian nuclear deal \nhas -- for years -- rested on this provision, Iran's insistence that its enriched uranium reside in Iranian possession \ncould be an unresolvable obstacle in the negotiations process.  Meanwhile, the other unresolved issues (discussed \nabove) -- from  the pace of lifting sanctions to strict monitoring restrictions --continued to pose challenges.  One \nIranian negotiator, Majid Takhteravanchi, signaled some intransigence as he said in an interview with the  Iranian \nFars news agency that the lifting of sanctions on Iranian terms was essential.  He said, \"There will be no agreement \nif the sanctions issue cannot be resolved. This issue is very important for us.\"\n\nStill, the P5+1 parties agreed to continue the conversation.  As noted by United States Secretary of State John \nKerry, \"There still remain some difficult issues. We are working very hard to work those through.\"  Russian Foreign \nMinister Sergei Lavrov sounded an optimistic note, saying that the chance of resolving the issues was high.  He \nsaid, \"The chances are high. They are probably not 100 percent but you can never be 100 percent certain of \nanything. The odds are quite doable  if none of the parties raise the stakes at the last minute.\" Of course, the \nIranians' objections to the removal of its enriched uranium could well be regarded as \"raising the stakes at the last \nminute.\"\n\nLengthy and difficult talks continued at the Beau-Rivage Ralace hotel in the Swiss city of Lausanne. The March 31, \n2015, \"soft\" or self-imposed deadline actually passed, with all parties set on extending the negotiations.  All eyes \nwere now focused on the first week of April 2015 as a new target date to forge consensus on the structure of a final \naccord.\n\nOn April 2, 2015, after marathon talks in Switzerland, the P5+1 countries and Iran issued a joint statement \nannouncing that the hard work of negotiations and diplomacy had yielded results, and that a historic framework \nagreement on Iran's nuclear program had been reached.  As stated by the European Union foreign policy chief, \nFederica Mogherini,  \"We have reached solutions on key parameters of a joint comprehensive plan of action.\"\n\nThe terms of the agreement would ensure that a longer time horizon -- of one year -- needed by Iran  to enrich \nenough uranium for one nuclear weapon. This breakout period of one year would be held in place for a decade.  Of \nnote was the fact that Iran's existing breakout time was estimated to be only two months.\n\nThe agreement would reduce the number of installed centrifuges from around the 19,000 Iran currently  has in its \npossession to 6,000;  all the centrifuges would be the less efficient  first-generation IR-1 enrichment models  while \nnewer-model centrifuges would be out of commission.  Of those 6,000 centrifuges, about 5,000 would be allowed to \nenrich uranium for 10 years. The remaining centrifuges would be moved to storage and controlled by the United \nNations'  nuclear watchdog group, the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nThe joint comprehensive plan of action would also ensure that Iran's actual stockpile of uranium would be reduced \nfrom 10,000 kilograms of low-enriched uranium to 300 kilograms along a 15-year time horizon. As well,  Iran would \ncease construction on new uranium enrichment facilities for a 15-year period.\n\nAlso central to the joint comprehensive plan of action were provisions to curtail Iran's enrichment facilities to the \nNatanz nuclear site, and convert the nuclear facilities at Fordo and Arak for purely research purposes.\n\n\n\nAccording to a fact sheet from the Government of the United States, Iran would gain sanctions relief only if it \n\"verifiably abides by its commitments.\" That sanctions relief would apply to those nuclear-related measures \nintroduced by the United States and the European Union and not include sanctions related to terrorism and human \nrights abuses.  There would be a \"snap back\" measure so that the sanctions could be re-imposed  if Iran was not \ncompliant with the provisions of the deal.\n\nAlso at stake would be prevailing United Nations Security Council resolutions on Iran's nuclear activities.  A new \nresolution would be introduced that would hold in place certain key provisions  relevant to \"sensitive\" nuclear \nactivities, while also addressing the new measures outlined above.\n\nA rigorous program of verification would remain in place  to  corroborate Iran's adherence to the terms of the \nagreement  and to ensure that Iran meets its obligations.  For example, Iran would have to provide the IAEA with \nunfettered access to its nuclear facilities, uranium mines, and  centrifuge storage facilities, ensuring the IAEA \ninspectors could investigate any suspicious sites or covert activities.\n\nIn an interview with Radio Free Europe, Kelsey Davenport, the director for Nonproliferation Policy at the Arms \nControl Association, explained that the non-proliferation parameters of the agreement were \"very strong.\"  \nDavenport said, \"This deal effectively blocks Iran's pathways to a weapon using both uranium and plutonium, and it \nputs in place stringent monitoring and verification to ensure that any deviation from the agreement or any covert \nprogram will be immediately detected.\"\n\nMark Fitzpatrick, the director of the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Program at the International Institute for \nStrategic Studies, came to a similar conclusion.  In his interview with Radio Free Europe that the agreement would \nresult in a rigid nuclear verification regime.  Fitzpatrick explained that under the verification infrastructure, violations \nof the agreement at any point along the \"supply chain\" would be easy to discern.  He said, \"It would be detected \nvery quickly if Iran were to use any of its declared facilities.  If Iran were to try to hide something, that would also \nvery likely be detected because this deal -- the parameters -- include a lot of verification measures that go beyond \nthe normal IAEA monitoring.\"\n\nThe successful framework agreement reached on April 2, 2015, marked a massive breakthrough in the realm of \ninternational diplomacy for the purpose of global security.\n\nThe agreement  presaged a long-term deal, which would have to be made by the final \"hard\"  deadline on June 30, \n2015.  The prevailing question continued to dominate:  Can a final accord on Iran's nuclear program be forged?  \nThe answer to that question remained the same at the time of writing:  It was yet to be determined if the nuclear \nnegotiations would actually end in a viable and enduring deal.\n\nPolitical Complications:\n\nIn the initial aftermath of the framework announcement, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani vowed that his country \nwould abide by the terms of the agreement, saying in a national address, \"The world must know that we do not \nintend to cheat.\"  He warned of consequences if the partner states did not do their own part, saying, \"If the other \nside acts on its promises, Iran will abide by its promises. If, however, they one day decide to follow a different path, \nour nation too will be always free to make [another] choice.\"\n\nOn the other side of the Atlantic, United States President Barack Obama was set to embark on a political campaign \nof sorts, as he hoped to persuade skeptical members of Congress that the Iranian nuclear deal was the best way of \nensuring Iran did not develop a nuclear weapon.  But he was immediately stymied by Israeli  Prime Minister \nBenjamin Netanyahu  who concluded that the deal  needed additional measures included, such as  a \"clear and \nunambiguous Iranian recognition of Israel's right to exist.\"\n\n\n\nThe Obama  administration, though, noted that the purpose of the agreement was carefully circumscribed to deal \nwith preventing Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon. President Obama himself entered the equation, insisting that  \nthe framework agreement would be good for global security, as it would \"cut off every pathway that Iran could take \nto develop a nuclear weapon.\"  He added, \"We will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security and \nto do so peacefully.\"  It was to be seen if Obama would gain concurrence in the United States Congress, or, if \nhardliners would be able to cull together a veto-proof majority to force the president of the United States to seek \nCongressional approval of the deal.\n\nAn additional complication was emanating from Iran itself, as that country demanded  immediate sanctions relief as \npart of the agreement.  To be precise, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said that not only would all \nsanctions  have to be lifted on the day any deal is signed, but that military sites would be not be open to \ninternational nuclear inspectors. Clearly, immediate sanctions relief was not part of the blueprint unveiled on April 2, \n2015, while a rigorous program of verification stood as the bulwark of the very deal.  As such, the Ayatollah's \nstatements  raised questions as to whether or not a viable agreement was actually on the table.\n\nAnother challenge was presented in the form of Russia's decision to lift a ban on missile deliveries to Iran while \ncommencing an oil-for-goods exchange.  These moves were  being met with concern from the Obama White House \nin the United States.  For Russia, though, it was evident that the plan was to immediately reap economic benefits \nfrom the cessation of sanctions against Iran.\n\nUnited States Secretary of State John Kerry was expected to bring up the subject for discussion with his Russian \ncounterpart, Sergei Lavrov.\n\nSecretary of State Kerry, meanwhile, had his hands full at home in the United States, as he lobbied members of \nCongress to hold off on any legislation that might curtail his abilities to forge a solid final nuclear deal by the June \n30, 2015, deadline mentioned above.  At issue was the fact that hardliners in Congress have been eager to enter \nthe realm of foreign relations, and force any deal signed by the president to be subject to review by the legislative \nbranch of government.  While Congress' hand could not stop the president from signing onto the deal being \nnegotiated, the president would still have to gain cooperation from Congress to modify the sanctions regime against \nIran. President Obama has made clear that he would veto moves intended to blunt or undermine the ability of his \nadministration to negotiate  a final deal with the Iranians.\n\nThe reality, however, was that President Obama could well be could be faced with a veto-proof super majority of \nbipartisan senators, who could conceivably impact his administration's negotiations.  As such, Secretary of State \nKerry, along with reasury Secretary Jack Lew and Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, were  eager to assure \nRepublicans and Democrats of the substance of the agreement, and gain their cooperation in allowig him more time \nto finalize an acceptable nuclear deal with Iran.  Ahead of these key meetings with legislators, Kerry said, \"We hope \nCongress will listen carefully ... but also give us some space so we will be able to complete a very difficult task.\"\n\nNote that on April 14, 2015, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee crafted a compromise bill that include a \nmodest review period of 30 days for a final Iran nuclear deal.  The bill would also specify that sanctions relief  would \nbe dependent on  an end to Iran's support for terrorism, but it would do so in more malleable language.  It seemed \nthat the committee was hoping to avoid a showdown with the executive branch of government.  President Obama \nmade it known that he would support the compromise legislation in this new form.  According to White House \nspokesperson Josh Earnest, the president was \"not thrilled\" with the bill; however, he concluded that the new \nproposal was a more acceptable measure.  It was conceivable that the White House could change its stance if \nobjectionable amendments were attached to the compromise bill. The bill passed by the committee and would be \ntaken up by the full Senate.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the negotiations process was ongoing, with a new round of talks between Iran and the P5+1 powers \nresuming in the last week of  April 2015.  United States  Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that serious \ndifferences remained between Iran and the global powers, but added that they were nonetheless closer than ever to \nforging a sustainable agreement with Iran.  Secretary of State Kerry said,  \"We are, in fact, closer than ever to the \ngood, comprehensive deal that we have been seeking, and if we can get there, the entire world will be safer.\" He \nadded, \"If finalized and implemented, (an agreement) will close off all of Iran's possible pathways to the nuclear \nmaterial required for a nuclear weapon and give the international community the confidence that it needs to know \nthat Iran's nuclear program is indeed exclusively peaceful.\"\n\nAt the start of May 2015, those negotiations concluded, with emphasis on key sticking points --  namely the re-\nimposition of United Nations sanctions, should Iran violate the agreement, and the potential purchase of nuclear \ntechnology' known as a \"procurement channel.\"  The sanctions issue was being regarded as a particularly \nchallenging one, with concerns centering on crafting parameters that would allow for the automatic re-imposition of  \nUnited Nations sanctions (referred to as\"snapback\" provision),  thus by-passing the potential hazard of a veto by \neither China or Russia.  Western negotiators have made it clear that without the implementation of a snapback \nmechanism, there would be no final Iranian nuclear deal.  Meanwhile, the procurement channel issue was being \ntaken seriously, given the United Kingdom's report to the United Nations on a spurious Iranian nuclear procurement \nnetwork, which was linked  with two blacklisted companies.\n\nA fresh round of negotiations commenced in Austria in mid-May 2015.\n\nRecent Nuclear Negotiations Developments\n\nAs May 2015 came to a close, the six P5-1 international powers were able to reach an agreement aimed at \nrestoring United Nations sanctions if Iran was found to be in non-compliance  a complex issue as intimated just \nabove.\n\nUnder the agreement, suspected breaches by Iran would be addressed by a  dispute-resolution panel.  As well,  \nwith the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) monitoring Iran's nuclear program, IAEA reports would be used \nto assess compliance.  If Iran was found to be  in violation of the terms of the deal, then United Nations sanctions \nwould effectively be \"snapped\" back into place.\n\nThe \"snapback\" provision meant that a significant hurdle had been crossed in reaching a comprehensive nuclear \ndeal with Iran.\n\nStill,  Iran had to concur with this measure for the deal to go forward, and  Iran was itself suggesting that it would \nimmediately resume its nuclear activities if the six P5-1 international powers  did not meet their own obligations \nunder the terms of the deal.\n\nMoving forward, there was more diplomatic work to be done regarding access to sensitive Iranian military sites in \norder to verify Iran's compliance with the new nuclear development parameters.\n\nOf particular concern was the matter of the inspection of non-nuclear sites and military installations in  Iran, \npresumably to ensure no clandestine nuclear operations were taking place in violation of the terms of any future \npermanent agreement.  Iran has been cold to the idea of inspections to such facilities while France has threatened \nto block any\nfinal nuclear settlement without a provision for that type of intrusive inspections regime.\n\nThe start of June 2015 was marked by the resumption of negotiations between the six P5-1 international powers \nand the Iranian delegation in Austria. Of note was the  absence of United States Secretary of State John Kerry  as \n\n\n\nhe recovered from a broken leg; however,  the talks went on with  United States negotiator Wendy Sherman \nrepresenting the interests of her country.\n\nThe June 30, 2015, deadline loomed ahead for a final and sustainable agreement to be reached on Iran's nuclear \nprogram.\n\nThe challenge of the task was aptly described by Iran's deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi , who was quoted as \nsaying in an interview with Iranian media, \"There has been progress but still we have a difficult way ahead of us.\"\n\nBy mid-June 2015, all reports from Vienna in Austria were that the nuclear talks between  the delegations from Iran \nand the six P5-1 international powers had stalled and, as such,  the deadline for the final agreement might have to \nbe pushed past June 30, 2015.  Indeed, with only days to go until that deadline, it was announced that nuclear \nnegotiations  between Iran and the six P5-1 international powers would extend beyond June 30, 2015.  There were \nreports that Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif  was heading home to Tehran -- quite likely for \ndiscussions with the government in Iran regarding the difficult final status issues, such as access to IAEA nuclear \nmonitors and  the timing of sanctions relief.\n\nAt the start of July 2015,  Iran and the six P5-1 international powers  remained deadlocked and a breakthrough had \nnot been made in the negotiations process.  However, representatives from the various delegations noted that \nprogress was being made, and that the \"bones\" of a final agreement were slowly taking shape.  As indicated \nabove,  particular sticking points included the matter of sanctions relief and the inspections and monitoring of \nIranian compliance.  That latter issue took on greater relevance when Iran's Ayatollah  Ali Khamenei declared that \nthere would be no sustained freeze of sensitive nuclear development, and that  military sites would not be open to \ninspectors.  This absolutist stance by Iran's Supreme Leader could potentially upend the deal that so many \ndiplomats had worked diligently to forge.\n\nStill, the diplomatic work continued with all parties suggesting that a final agreement might be advanced by  a new \ndeadline of  July 7, 2015.\n\nIn an interview with the media, United States Secretary of State John Kerry indicated that a deal was possible in \nthat timeframe as he said, \"If hard choices get made in the next couple of days and made quickly, we could get \nagreement this week.\"  But Kerry also acknowledged that negotiations had not yet yielded breakthrough results on \nthe key technical issues, as he added that Iran and the  six P5-1 international powers  were \"not where we need to \nbe on several of the most difficult issues.\"  If no progress was made with Iran on those matters, then the United \nStates was ready to walk away -- regardless of the herculean effort to date in the negotiating arena.\n\nThat deadline of June 7, 2015 was extended  yet again and negotiations were set to continue with negotiators \nlooking for a final deal.  The new goal was to reach a nuclear agreement by mid-July 2015.\n\nIn the days leading up to the middle of July 2015, Iran accused the West of complicating the negotiations process \nby introducing new demands, while countries of the West warned that progress was now slow and difficult.  There \nwere also reports of loud arguments between Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif and United States Secretary of State \nKerry.\n\nFor his part, Secretary of State Kerry was signaling that he would be prepared to walk away from the negotiating \ntable as he said, \"We can't wait forever. If the tough decisions don't get made, we are absolutely prepared to call an \nend to this.\"  On the other side of the equation,  Iran responded bitterly with Iranian Envoy Ali Akbar Velayati \nreferring to  Kerry's  statement as \"part of America's psychological warfare against Iran.\"\n\n\n\nBut by July 12, 2015, tensions were calming and there were reports that the foundations of an agreement were \nemerging.  To this end,  Secretary of State Kerry suggested progress was being made as he said,  \"I think we're \ngetting to some real decisions.\"  French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius offered a similar mesage as he said: \"I \nhope we are finally entering the final phase of these marathon negotiations. I believe it.\"\n\nIn the early hours of July 14, 2015,  reported were emerging that a final deal was in the works.  some elements of \nthe final deal were being leaked in the public sphere.  Those elements of the nuclear draft included provisions for \nthe United Nations  inspectors to have access to all suspicious Iranian nuclear sites, including military compounds.\n\nThe agreement would also have to be adopted by the United Nations  Security Council in the form of a  resolution, \nand then the the work on limiting and regulating Iran's nuclear activities, as well as the measured related to  \nsanctions relief,  would be put into effect in 2016.\n\nFinal Iran Nuclear Deal Reached:\n\nOn July 14, 2015, Iran and the so-called P5+1 world powers officially reached a historic accord on Iran's \ncontroversial nuclear program.  The accord was formally announced in the Austrian capital of Vienna where the \nfinal slate of difficult negotiations had taken place.  As presaged in the previous sections of this report, the \nagreement would limit Iran's nuclear activity and development, essentially preventing the production of a nuclear \nbomb.  The agreement was also aimed at extending Iran's nuclear weapons \"breakout\" time from its current \ntimeline of  a month to a year.\n\nThe deal was not intended to address issues related to state-sponsorship of terrorism or human rights abuses. In \nexchange, the West would lift its international oil and financial sanctions imposed on Iran.\n\nIn a separate but related development, Iran and the the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- the  world's \nnuclear watchdog entity --  said they had signed a roadmap to resolve outstanding issues. Already, under the aegis \nof the 2013 interim temporary accord, the IAEA verified that Iran had eliminated its known stockpiles of 20 percent \nenriched uranium.  This 20 percent grade uranium can be used  (1) to produce medical isotopes and  (2) to fuel \nresearch reactors,  but (3) it  can also be  purified to weapons-grade levels.  The IAEA has already verified that Iran \nmet this demand dating back to 2013.\n\nCentral elements of the final deal were as follows -\n\n-  Iran would reduce its enriched-uranium stockpile by 98 percent\n-  Iran would retain a reduced number of uranium centrifuges (5060 in total) for a ten-year period\n-  Iran would be limited to refining uranium  at only a five percent enrichment level for a fifteen-year period\n( this level is consistent for usage at a nuclear power plant and is well short of weaponization levels )\n-  Iran will allow IAEA monitors to inspect facilities under review for suspicious activity for up to 25 years\n\n( Iran does not have to submit to inspections but if it refuses it will be subject to an arbitration panel and possible \njudgement that it is in violation)\n-  Iran would be granted gradual/phased in  sanctions relief, essentially allowing Iran to finally export its oil\n-  Iran would be granted access to more than $100 billion in frozen assets pending the implementation of nuclear \ncurbs\n-  The prevailing United Nations arms embargo on Iran would  remain in place for five years\n-  The prevailing  ballistic missiles embargo on Iran would  remain in place for eight years\n_  Iran would be prohibited from  designing warheads or conducting experiments on nuclear weapons-related \ntechnology\n\n\n\nThe complete  implementation of the provisions of the deal would be contingent on Iran's commitment  to meeting \nits obligations to curtail its nuclear program and satisfy the world's concerns over the  possible military dimensions \nof its  nuclear development activity.  To this end,  a breach of the terms of the accord by Iran would generate a \n\"snapback\" provision, essentially snapping highly punitive sanctions back into place.\n\nUnited States President Barack Obama touted the agreement as a good one, noting the following:\n\n\"This deal meets every single one of the bottom lines that we established when we achieved a framework this \nspring. Every pathway to a nuclear weapon is cut off, and the inspection and transparency regime necessary to \nverify that objective will be put in place.\"\n\nPresident Obama also noted that the deal would make the world \"safer and more secure.\"  He additionally \naddressed his critics  saying that the terms of thee agreement  provided for a rigorous verification regime.\n\nHe added, \"This deal is not built on trust -- it is built on verification.\"  Furthermore, the president emphasized  that \nthere would be immediate consequences if Iran was found to be in violation of the terms of the agreement, as he \nsaid, \"If Iran violates the deal, all these sanctions will snap back into place.\"\n\nFor his part, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani hailed the accord, saying that  the prayers of Iranians had \"come \ntrue.\"  Rouhani -- who was being celebrated in the streets of Tehran as a hero -- said the deal opened a \"new \nchapter\" in Iran's relationship with the rest of the international community.  But the Iranian leader was also realistic \nin his assessment of the agreement, noting that it was \"not perfect,\"  but that it was the \"best achievement possible \nthat could be reached.\"\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon championed the pact finalized in Vienna, casting it to be  \"historic,\" \nand paid tribute to the onerous and difficult work of diplomacy, which he said was  a \"testament to the value of \ndialogue.\" The United Nations chief conveyed his hopes that  the deal would contribute to \"a greater mutual \nunderstanding and cooperation on the many serious security challenges in the Middle East.\"\n\nA similar view came from Federica Mogherini, the  European Union foreign policy chief,  as she expressed \nsatisfaction with the final accord.  She said, \"This is a sign of hope for the entire world. And we all know this is very \nmuch needed in these times.\"\n\nEven with the formal announcement of this historic nuclear  agreement, the process was not over.  There would \nhave to be a vote at the United Nations Security Council.  As well, the deal would still have to find concurrence in \nthe capital cities of Tehran, Washington D.C., London, Paris, Berlin, Moscow, and Beijing where it would face the \nchallenges of hardline domestic politics.\n\nHinting towards the Republicans' opposition would have to any agreement forged by the Obama administration in \nthe United States, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in an interview with Fox News,  \"I think it's going to \nbe a very hard sell, if it's completed, in Congress. We already know it's going to leave Iran as a threshold nuclear \nstate.\" Upon hearing the announcement of the landmark deal, and before actually reading the details of the \nagreement, Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, denounced the deal, declaring \nthat it would  only \"embolden\" Iran.  He said, \"Instead of stopping the spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, \nthis deal is likely to fuel a nuclear arms race around the world.\"  But perhaps the most vituperative feedback came \nfrom Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas who pugnaciously suggested military consequences for Iran as follows: \"Iran \nis an anti-American, terrorism-sponsoring outlaw regime. Iran should have faced a simple choice: they dismantle \ntheir nuclear program entirely, or they face economic devastation and military destruction of their nuclear facilities.\"\n\n\n\nClearly, Republicans in the United States Congress, helped by certain factions of Democrats, would do their part to \nresist, curtail, and even halt the United States' participation in the agreement.  To this end, under a special \narrangement made with the president, they would have 60 days to consider the Iranian agreement in Congress and \neither sanction or reject it. \n\nNote:  Because the Iranian nuclear deal was not a formal treaty between the United States and Iran, there was \nactually no need for a ratification vote by two-thirds of the Senate.  However, in the interests of some degree of \nnational consensus on so sensitive a subject as Iran's nuclear ambitions,  the United States Congress and \nPresident Obama agreed to an arrangement by which legislators would be allowed to either approve or reject the \nagreement by a simple majority.\n\nSince Republicans controlled both Houses of Congress, it was highly likely they would be successful in their efforts \nto defeat the accord.  However, President Obama would himself have the opportunity to veto any legislation passed \nin Congress that aimed to kill the deal.  Warning Republicans and their Democratic allies of this course of action, \nPresident Obama said,  \"So I will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of this deal. We \ndo not have to accept an inevitable spiral into conflict. And we certainly shouldn't seek it. And precisely because the \nstakes are so high this is not the time for politics or posturing. Tough talk from Washington does not solve \nproblems.\"\n\nIn Iran,  despite the positive reception by pro-Rouhani  and other moderate elements, the agreement was \nguaranteed to spark the antagonism of hardliners and conservatives.  As expected, Iranian hardliners and \nconservatives immediately launched their opposition campaign to the nuclear deal, with even  Supreme Leader \nAyatollah Ali Khamenei warning that  some of the world powers that signed on to the agreement were \n\"untrustworthy.\"  In this way, there was no guarantee that Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei would \"bless\" the deal.\n\nIn the United States, there was a parallel process of opposition and acrimony unfolding as hardliners and \nconservatives warned that Iran would find ways to cheat and violate the terms of the agreement.\n\nOf particular concern to United States lawmakers was the provision allowing Iran 24 days before allowing nuclear \ninspectors into suspect Iranian military sites, with many of them complaining that the length of time would allow Iran \nto cover its tracks were it to carry out clandestine nuclear activities  at these sites.\n\nHowever, nuclear experts have noted that current technology would be able to detect traces of sustances used for \nnuclear development activities, making it impossible for Iran to actually hide any \"bad behavior.\"\n\nAs noted by the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Yukiya Amano: \"We are confident we can detect \nany diversion or misuse of nuclear material in a timely manner.\"\n\nThere were also objections to the lifting of sanctions and access to frozen assets, which could be used to fund \nrogue actors across the world.  However, even if the United States held in place its own unilateral sanctions against \nIran, the other world powers were eager to end the sanctions regime against Iran.  Thus, the United States would \nbe left isolated in its effort to keep the sanctions pressure on Iran.\n\nIn Israel, which has been adamantly against an agreement with Israel, the response was rapid and bitter.  Israeli \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cast the deal as a \"stunning historic mistake.\"  He also noted  that sanctions \nrelief  would provide Iran with \"hundreds of billions of dollars with which it can fuel its terror machine and its \nexpansion and aggression throughout the Middle East and across the globe.\"  Netanyahu also made clear that \nIsrael had no intention of abiding with the agreement -- regardless of its eventual enshrinement as a United Nations \nSecurity Council Resolution -- as he warned, \"\"We will always defend ourselves.\"\n\nBut the objective arbiters of the agreement expressed cautious optimism over the successful negotiations process.\n\n\n\nYukiya Amano, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- the world's nucear watchdog entity -- \nsaid that the landmark nuclear agreement  constituted a \"significant step forward,\"  and noted that now the IAEA \nwould be better positioned to\n\n\"make an assessment of issues relating to possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program by the end of \n2015.\"\n\nAs well, the conservative publication, The Economist, made the following conclusion:  \"The concern of critics of \nBarack Obama, both in Washington and beyond, was that the president's perceived desperation to burnish his \nlegacy with an historic deal would result in dangerous compromises surrendered at the last minute to the wily \nIranians. However, that was never likely (Iran's need for a deal has always been much greater than America's) and \nit is not borne out by the details of what has appears to have been agreed... But judged by more pragmatic \nstandards, the deal, while not perfect, appears much better than any of the plausible alternatives.\"\n\nEllie Geranmayeh, a policy fellow at the European Council of Foreign Relations,  gave  the agreement fulsome \npraise, declaring, \"This is probably going to go down in history as one of the biggest diplomatic successes of the \ncentury.\"\n\nIt should be noted that nuclear nonproliferation experts have largely endorsed this agreement.  As reported by Max \nFisher at Vox.com regarding an interview with  Aaron Stein, a nuclear nonproliferation expert at the Royal United \nServices Institute, the Iranian nuclear deal  \"exceeds in all areas.\" Under this agreement, according to Stein, if Iran \nwere to attempt to build a bomb, \"the likelihood of getting caught is near 100 percent.\"  He added,  \"It makes the \npossibility of Iran developing a nuclear weapon in the next 25 years extremely remote.\"  Stein explained his \nassessment further as follows: \" I think the U.S. hand is actually strengthened in this, to be honest with you. A full \naccounting of where everything is [gleaned from invasive inspections and monitoring] is a wonderful targeting \nmechanism for the Pentagon. If we know where all of their stuff is, you can make far more accurate, detailed maps \nabout where to put a cruise missile. Iran knows what it's doing going into this. They know the consequences if they \nscrew up here, and the provisions are very tight, the inspection regime is very robust. The likelihood of getting \ncaught is near 100 percent.  The consequences are far more than just having your sites bombed. It's that they will \nhave reneged on the agreement that basically the whole world supports, except for the Republicans and the Israelis \nand the Saudis.\"\n\nUnited Nations Security Council lifts sanctions on Iran:\n\nGoing forward, the United Nations Security Council would have to adopt a resolution that would lift international \nsanctions related to Iran's nuclear program.  Of course, as has been discussed here, the sanctions  would be \nsubject to the so-called \"snapback\" provision and could be re-imposed if Iran was deemed to be in violation of the \nnew accord.  A vote at the United Nations Security Council ws expected to occur early as the third week in July \n2015.  To that end, United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, said she would submit the \ndraft resolution on behalf of the P5+1 world powers and the European Union, which would then be taken up for a \nvote.\n\nThat vote on a resolution endorsing the agreement was set to take place during the following week.  Since the veto-\nwielding permanent  members of the  United Nations Security Council  were all parties to the negotiations, there \nwas no doubt that the resolution would be adopted.\n\nIndeed, on July 20, 2015, the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved a resolution endorsing the \nIranian nuclear deal, thus clearing the path for sanctions imposed since 2006 to be lifted.  The United Nations \nSecurity Council  also enshrined its nuclear watchdog agency,\n\n\n\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency,  with the authority to \"undertake the necessary verification and monitoring \nof Iran's nuclear commitments.\"\n\nOther measures would have to be undertaken by various governments.  Primarily, Iran's  parliament would have to  \nreview  and ratify the agreement, which was reported to have been \"blessed\" by Supreme Leader  Ayatollah Ali \nKhamenei.\n\nAt the start of September 2015, Khamenei returned to the political purview in Iran to say that he favored a \nparliamentary vote on its nuclear deal.  To this end, Khamenei said,  \"Parliament should not be sidelined on the \nnuclear deal issue ... I am not saying lawmakers should ratify or reject the deal. It is up to them to decide.\"\n\nWhile Khamenei has neither opposed nor endorsed the agreement, his praise of the diplomatic process has been \ninterpreted by some observers as a tacit blessing of sorts.  It was to be seen if an actual vote would ensue in the \nIranian Majlis, however, President Rouhani's government had not yet even advanced legislation for members of \nparliament to consider.\n\nA similar process would have to ensue in the United States where the Republican-led Congress would have 60 \ndays to review and ratify the agreement, but where it was more likely to be rejected.  The fight in the United States \nwould be to secure enough votes to maintain a presidential veto.\n\nNote on Political Landscape in the United States --\n\nAs discussed above,  if the United States Congress was able to disapprove of the Iranian nuclear deal, President \nObama would enact his veto authority. The main question would be whether or not there was enough support in \nCongress to override a presidential veto.  (In the Senate and the House of Representatives, there would have to be \na 2/3 super-majority in each of the two chambers to vitiate a presidential veto.)  Of note was the fact that even a \nvote to \"disapprove\" of the nuclear deal by the United States Congress would do little to actually upend the \nagreement since a United Nations Security Council  resolution had already approved it in the realm of international \njurisprudence.\n\nAssuming the United States president's veto would be enough to halt Republicans' objections to the deal, there \nwould be few options left for hardline conservatives determined to kill any agreement with Iran.\n\nOne of the remaining courses of action for Republicans would be for them to capture the White House in 2016.  \nThen, with a new administration at the helm in 2017, the new president could conceivably begin the process of \nscapping the accord and re-imposing sanctions against Iran.  But that would be a unilateral pathway unlikely to gain \nsupport from the other P5+1 countries, whose diplomats also worked hard to forge this pact, and who were not \neager to see military engagement with Iran.\n\nMoreover, by 2017, most of the pressing sanctions would have been removed anyway, and the re-imposition of \nthem promised to be a herculean task.  As noted by the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \nRepublican Senator Bob Corker,  \"The next president can start from scratch.  What would have happened, though, \nis the international sanctions process would have been totally dismantled.\"\n\nIn the six weeks following the decision by the United Nations Security Council to lift its sanctions against Iran,  \ngroups hostile to the Iranian nuclear agreement launched an aggressive and expensive advertising campaign  \nintent on securing enough support to kill the deal.  As well, Israeli Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu \nrepeated his dire warnings of geopolitical calamity sure to visit the Middle East were the deal to go forward.  But \n\n\n\neven as these forces placed their own pressure on lawmakers in the United States, the Obama administration was \nbusy are work trying to rally support for the deal in Congress.\n\nThe main argument from the White House was that the agreement accomplished its objective of preventing Iran \nfrom obtaining a nuclear weapon.  As stated by President Obama himself, the agreement eliminates \"every \npathway to a nuclear weapon\" for Iran.\n\nWith most of the Democratic representatives in the lower chamber in relatively safe seats, and since many of them \nalready shared the president's internationalist foreign policy, there was a sense of confidence that House Minority \nLeader Nancy Pelosi would be able to bring together enough Democratic votes to deny the House Republicans the \n2/3 majority needed to uphold a disapproval measure.  The real action was in the Senate where some Democrats, \nsuch as Senator Charles Schumer of New York, and Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, had already \nsignalled their skepticism regarding the Iranian nuclear deal, and as exepected, ultimately opted to vote to \ndisapprove of the accord.\n\nSince a total of 34 votes would be needed to deny the Republican-led Senate their 2/3 majority, the job of gaining \nsupport for President Obama's Iran agenda would be difficult, and the final tally was expected to be tight.\n\nBut on Sept. 2, 2015, President Obama secured the support of 34 Democratic senators regarding the Iranian deal, \neffectively foreclosing any sgnificant action from the Republicans to stymie the United States' full participation in the \nlandmark Iranian nuclear curtailment deal.\n\nMost of the senators  expressed similar sentiment, noting that no deal was perfect, that the Iranians were not be \ntrusted, but that the  Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (the legislative title for the Iranian nuclear deal as it is \ndiscussed and debated in the Congress) was the best available option to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear \nbomb.  As noted by United States Secretary of State John Kerry, who did the strenuous work of vigorous diplomacy \nto make the deal a reality, \"The benefits of this agreement far outweigh any potential drawbacks.\"\n\nThe disapproval resolution related to  the  Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action  would be on the legislative agenda \nfor debate when members of Congress returned to the Capitol in Washington D.C. after the August recess on Sept. \n8, 2015.  A vote was expected  later in the month when the resolution would be presumably be passed, and then be \nsubject to a presidential veto.\n\nOn the United States political landscape, there remained a small possibility in the Senate that the disapproval \nresolution would not even be voted on if Democrats in the upper chamber were able to hold together 41 votes to \nsustain a filibuster, thus preventing a vote of cloture cutting off debate.  In such a case, the bill would not be able to \nbe brought to the floor for a full vote and President Obama would not have to use his veto power.  While all \nexpectations were that there would, in fact, be a full vote where the bill would be approved, the landscape changed \non Sept. 8, 2015, when the Democratic tally was complete.  On that day, it was clear that\n\n42 senators had opted to support the deal -- more than the 34 needed to sustain a veto but also more than the 41 \nneeded to filibuster the bill from even going to a vote on the floor of the Senate.  Still to be determined was the \nmatter of whether or not at least  41 senators would be willing to go down the filibuster path.\n\nThat question was answered on Sept. 10, 2015, when Democrats in the Senate delivered a major victory to \nPresident Obama by successfully holding together 42 votes to filibuster the disapproval resolution, thus denying a \nvote on the legislation.\n\n\n\nAll 42 Democratic senators who had expressed support for the nuclear agreement stood in solidarity on the \nprocedural vote after several hours of debate, effectively preventing the bill from even going to a vote, and thus \ninsulating the president from having to exercise his veto authority.\n\nMeanwhile, in the House of Representatives, the Republican leadership was trying to alter its political calculus \nrelated to the disapproval resoluton by dividing it up into three separate bills, in the hopes that it would delay -- if \nnot outright stop -- the nuclear deal from going into effect. Now, one measure centered on the claim that President \nObama  did not comply with the Iran nuclear review act; a second measure was a motion of approval of the nuclear \ndeal; the third measure sought to prevent President  Obama from waiving sanctions against Iran. All three pieces of \nlegislation were cleared for debate, where they were expected to pass due to the fact that Republicans controlled \nthe lower chamber.  However,  the fate of the Iranian  nuclear deal was no longer in doubt  given the outcome in the \nSenate.\n\nThe political victory for President Obama at home in the United States ensured that the nuclear deal would go into \nforce -- irrespective of the objections from Republicans and a handful of Democrats in Congress, and certainly \ndespite the disapprobation of Israel.  Democratic Senator Schumer of New York, who was part of the four-vote \nDemocratic contingent parting ways with the president conceded that the Obama administration had secured a \npolitical victory as he declared: \"Regardless of how one feels about the agreement, fair-minded Americans should \nacknowledge the president's strong achievements in combating and containing Iran.\"\n\nInternational Dimensions:\n\nThe Iranian nuclear deal certainly had support in Europe where the leaders of the United States' allied countries -- \nthe United Kingdom, France, and Germany -- expressed support for it.  In fact, United Kingdom Prime Minister \nDavid Cameron,  French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel wrote a joint opinion \neditorial titled \"Why we support the Iran deal,\" which was published in the Washington Post on Sept. 10, 2015.\n\nIn that piece, the three Western world leaders acknowledged the difficulty of the negotiations process, noting, \"The \nlong history of fruitless nuclear talks with Iran did not give strong grounds for optimism.\"  But they also noted that \ntheir efforts ended in success, as they declared, \"Nevertheless, two years of tough, detailed negotiation have \nproduced an agreement that closes off all possible routes to an Iranian nuclear weapon in return for phased relief \nfrom nuclear-related sanctions.\"\n\nCameron, Hollande, and Merkel repeated what United States Secretary of State John Kerry has long argued -- that \nthe agreement was not based on blind trust.  To this end,  they wrote: \"This is not an agreement based on trust or \non any assumption about how Iran may look in 10 or 15 years. It is based on detailed, tightly written controls that \nare verifiable and long-lasting. Iran will have strong incentives not to cheat: The near certainty of getting caught and \nthe consequences that would follow would make this a losing option.\"\n\nAs such, Cameron, Hollande, and Merkel  reached the following conclusion: \"We fully support this agreement \nbecause it achieves the goals we had set ourselves. It deals with the uranium enrichment route to a bomb by \nrequiring Iran to reduce by 98 percent its stockpile of enriched uranium; to lower by two-thirds the number of its \ncentrifuges; to limit uranium enrichment levels; and to stop using the deep Fordow site for enrichment. It closes the \nplutonium route through changes to the Arak reactor so that it does not produce weapons-grade plutonium. And it \nensures the IAEA enhanced access not only to Iran's nuclear facilities and the entire nuclear fuel cycle but also, \nwhere needed, to any undeclared site.\"\n\nPolitical legacies:\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, regardless of the political machinations  as well as the political posturing, this landmark accord was \nbeing celebrated as a historic development in the realm of international diplomacy and global security.  For good of \nfor ill, the re-integration of Iran into the global community would inevitably shift the geopolitical dynamics in the \nMiddle East.  Moreover, both President Rouhani in Iran and President Obama in the United States had made \nhistory with this landmark nuclear accord by moving their two countries from a state of decades-old enmity, charting \nthe path of diplomacy, and traversing\n\nalong the difficult road of re-engagement.  These efforts would surely define their respective political legacies.  \nWhether or not this nuclear agreement would stand the test of time and survive hardline domestic politics at home \nin Iran and the United States was to be determined, but Rouhani and Obama could take heart in the fact that they \nhad respectively honored their election promises to pursue a peaceful resolution to the Iranian nuclear issue.\n\nForeign Relations Note\n\nSaudi Arabia breaks off ties with Iran after executing prominent Shi'a cleric\n\nTies between Shi'a Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia  reached a new low at the start of 2016 due to Saudi Arabia's \nexecution of a prominent Shi'a cleric.\n\nSheikh Nimr al-Nimr was one of 47 individuals executed by Saudi Arabia for terrorism offenses.  Iranian authorities \nwere vociferous in noting that far from being a terrorist, Sheikh Nimr was simply a peaceful martyr expressive in his \nopposition to Saudi Arabia's ruling regime.\n\nIndeed,  Sheikh Nimr could not be properly understood as a supporter of Iran's hardline leadership since he had \nactually sought to distance himself from expressly pro-Iranian and anti-American stances.  In many respects, he a \npolitical independent of sorts.\n\nTo this end, Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made clear that Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr had been executed precisely for his \npolitical views as he declared via the social media outlet, Twitter,\n\n\"This oppressed scholar had neither invited people to armed movement, nor was involved in covert plots.\" The \nIranian leader added, \"The only act of #SheikhNimr was outspoken criticism.\"  For these reasons, Ayatollah Ali \nKhamenei vowed that retribution in the form of \"divine revenge\"  would be upon Saudi Arabia, noting via Twitter that \nthe \"unfairly spilled blood of oppressed martyr #SheikhNimr will affect rapidly & divine revenge will seize Saudi \npoliticians.\"\n\nAnger in Iran did not stem only from the highest echelon of power.  Indeed, protesters stormed the  Saudi embassy \nin Tehran on Jan. 2, 2016, setting the building ablaze before being repelled by security personnel. A day later on \nJan. 3, 2015, hundreds of angry protesters had gathered outside the diplomatic compound.  Protests were also \nerupting outside of Iran.  Of note was a burst of demonstrations in  Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province, which was \nhome to a marginalized population of Shia Muslims, as well as the eruption of protests across the world from \nIndian-administered Kashmir to Iraq and Bahrain.  In fact, Iraq's top Shi'a cleric,  Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani condemned \nthe execution of Sheikh Nimr, casting it as an act of \"unjust aggression.\"\n\nMoreover, in the days following the execution of the cleric,  protests and unrest broke out if Sheikh Nimr's own \nhome district of Qatif in the oil-producing Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, where angry supporters railed about the \ninjustice of his fate.\n\nWhile Iranian commentators in the media have condemned the execution of Sheikh Nimr and predicted that it could \ncause the collapse of the Saudi regime, the actual Saudi regime at home has dismissed any criticism of its actions.  \n\n\n\nIn fact, the Saudi government has insisted that it had the right to enforce the law, which included exacting \npunishment, while also registering its anger over Iran's  \"blatant interference\" in its internal affairs.\n\nIn truth, the move by Saudi Arabia, coupled with Iran's angry reaction was most likely to fuel the existing sectarian \nhostility between the two countries, as they attempt to gain political ascendancy in the region.  During the course of \nthe previous year, sectarian hostilities between Shi'a Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia were playing out on proxy terrain \nin Yemen, with Iran supporting the Shi'ite Zaidi Houthi movement, and with Saudi Arabia supporting the Hadi \ngovernment forces -- both of which were on a collision course.\n\nThe two countries also have not seen eye to eye on the Syrian civil war. The execution of a Shi'a cleric by Saudi \nArabia, though, would bring the antagonism between Iran and Saudi Arabia into more direct light, with possible \ndeleterious consequences to come across the region.  Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the extremist Shi'a \nHezbollah movement, referred to this very possibility as he accused the Saudi ruling regime of seeking to ignite a \nwar between Sunni and Shia Muslims across the globe.\n\nGiven this dire possibility, there were questions as to why Saudi Arabia would even bother to go forward with the \nexecutions and thus accentuate Shi'a-Sunni sectarian antagonism.  The answer was, very likely,  a matter of \npolitical expediency on the domestic scene.  While Saudi Arabia was home to a Sunni majority and Shi'a minority \npopulation, it is largely reliant on the Sunni Wahhabist population for support.  As a result, taking a harsh stand \nagainst the Shi'ite population has been part of a clear strategy to manipulate the sectarian division in Saudi \nkingdom and shore up conservative Sunni support for the benefit of the House of Saud.\n\nPerhaps with this goal in mind, Saudi Arabia was interested in leveraging sectarian divisions regionally as well.  To \nthis end,  signs of devolving relations came with the decision by Saudi Arabia to cut diplomatic ties with Iran on Jan. \n3, 2016.  The decision came in the aftermath of the storming of the Saudi embassy in Tehran.  Saudi Foreign \nMinister Adel al-Jubeir said that all his country's diplomats would be recalled from Iran while Iranian diplomats \nwould be given 48 hours to depart Saudi Arabia. As well, Foreign Minister Jubeir said trade links with Iran would be \nsevered and air traffic links halted, however, Iranian pilgrims seeking to travel to holy sites in Mecca and Medina \nwould be permitted into Saudi Arabia.  Foreign Minister Jubeir said Saudi Arabia  would not allow would  Iran to \nundermine its right to security, and accused Iran of  \"planting terrorist cells in the region.\"  He added, \"Iran's history \nis full of negative interference and hostility in Arab issues, and it is always accompanied by destruction.\"\n\nFor its part, Iran reacted by accusing Saudi Arabia of \"continuing the policy of increasing tension and clashes in the \nregion.\"  A spokesperson for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, Hossein Jaber Ansari, said: \"Saudi Arabia sees not only \nits interests but also its existence in pursuing crises and confrontations and attempts to resolve its internal problems \nby exporting them to the outside.\"\n\nIt should be noted that Bahrain, Djibouti, and Sudan joined Saudi Arabia in severing ties with Iran, while United \nArab Emirates downgraded its ties and diplomatic staff.  Kuwait, Qatar, and Comoros also joined this group of Arab \ncountries as it recalled its ambassador from Iran.\n\nIn view of the strident rhetoric adopted by the respective governments of Iran and Saudi Arabia, governments in the \nEurope and the United States were urging restraint and diplomacy to resolve the broadening imbroglio.  Meanwhile, \nthe United Nations Security Council issued a statement in which it condemned the attack on the Saudi embassy in \nTehran. Of note was the fact that no reference in the statement was made to the execution of the cleric.\n\nAt the end of the first week of January 2016, the situation grew more tense when Iran accused Saudi Arabia of \nattacking its embassy in Yemen in an air strike.  Iranian state media claimed that the Saudi air strike deliberately \n\n\n\ntargeted the Iranian embassy in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa.  Other reports indicated that the air strikes had \nactually hit targets in the region of the embassy and not the diplomatic mission at all.\n\nNevertheless, the spokesperson for the Iranian Foreign Ministry made the position of the Iranian government clear \nas he declared: \"Saudi Arabia is responsible for the damage to the embassy building and the injury to some of its \nstaff.\"  Accordingly, Iran's government  severed all commercial ties with Saudi Arabia as a result.  For its part, the \nSaudi-led coalition operating in Yemen said that it had  targeted rebel missile launchers, which may have used \nabandoned diplomatic compounds. \n\nConcerned that the growing animosity between Iran and Saudi Arabia could deleteriously affect the global effort \nagainst the terror enclave,  Islamic State, Iraq -- with its majority Shi'a and minority Sunni population base -- entered \nthe fray and offered to mediate the diplomatic fracas.  To this end,  Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi dispatched  \nForeign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari to Iran  to try to quell the tensions.\n\nAs a new conference. Jaafari said,  \"We have solid relations with the Islamic Republic and also we have relations \nwith our Arab brothers and therefore we cannot stay silent in this crisis.\"\n\nSpecial Report on Iran:\n\n- Diplomacy credited for quick return by Iran of U.S. sailors; treatment of sailors in propaganda video raises \neyebrows\n- Diplomacy credited for release of five U.S. citizens from Iran; seven Iranians in U.S. released as part of prisoner \nswap\n- Iran sanctions lifted thanks to P5+1 landmark nuclear deal; U.S. imposes new sanctions on Iran\n\nDiplomacy credited for quick return by Iran of U.S. sailors; treatment of sailors in propaganda video raises eyebrows\n\nOn Jan. 12, 2016, 10 United States sailors were detained by Iranian  Revolutionary Guards after an incursion into \nIranian marine territory.  According to reports, one of the two patrol vessels on a\ntraining mission between Bahrain and Kuwait developed mechanical troubles and, as a result, they strayed into \nIran's waters.  The crew was then held at an Iranian naval base on Farsi Island. The development spurred some \ndegree of panic in the United States about the fate of the sailors, given the fact that in 2007,  15 sailors from the \nUnited Kingdom were detained in a disputed area between Iranian and Iraqi territory and held for weeks.\n\nSoon, however, there were reports that thanks to a recent opening of the diplomatic channels, United States \nSecretary of State John Kerry was in contact with his Iranian counterpart, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and that \ndiscussions were afoot to arrange the release of the sailors.\n\nOf significance was the fact that Iranian General Ali Fadavi cast the United States' sailors as having committed \n\"unprofessional\" acts.  He made  clear that the United States vessel had violated Iranian sovereignty by entering \nIranian waters; however, he indicated that the sailors would soon be released.  As noted by Fadavi, \"Mr. Zarif [Iran's \nforeign minister] had a firm stance, saying that they were in our territorial waters and should not have been, and \nsaying that they [the US] should apologize. This has been done and it will not take long, and the naval force, \naccording to its hierarchy, will act immediately upon the orders it receives.\"  As promised, the sailors were released \nin the early hours of Jan. 13, 2016 although the United States made clear that Secretary of State John Kerry did not \nissue an apology.\n\nFor its part, Iran released videotaped footage showing the United States sailors being held at gunpoint by the \nIranian Revolutionary Guards.  The video also included footage of one sailor offering an apology for straying into \nIranian waters.\n\n\n\nWhile there were strong criticisms of Iran for indulging in what could only be understood as propaganda formation, \nthe general consensus was that such action was to be expected from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, which was \nknown to be one of the most hardline elements of the Iranian governing structure.\n\nIt should be noted that the naval incident occurred at a time when a controversial Iranian nuclear deal was set to be \nimplemented.  At issue was the lifting of punitive sanctions against Iran for its nuclear program.  With that goal in \nmind, along with an open channel of communication between United States Secretary of State Kerry and Iran's \nForeign Minister Zarif, it was perhaps not surprising that the matter was quickly resolved and the sailors were \nreleased.  Indeed, according to State Department spokesperson, John Kirby, the foundation of diplomacy set during \nthe nuclear negotiations is precisely why the United States sailors were freed from Iranian custody in less than 24 \nhours.\n\nDiplomacy credited for release of five U.S. citizens from Iran; seven Iranians in U.S. released as part of prisoner \nswap\n\nOn Jan. 17, 2016, five United States citizens were released from the notorious Evin prison in Iran.  Among the \nreleased individuals were Jason Rezaian, a reporter for the Washington Post; Amir Hekmati, a United States \nmarine;  Saeed Abedini, a Christian pastor; Matthew Trevithic, a student, and a fifth individual identified as \nNosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari.  Rezaian and Hekmati were imprisoned for charges related to espionage; Abedini \nwas jailed for church activities in people's homes while he was in Iran to set up an orphanage.  The charges related \nto the arrests of Trevithick and  Khosravi-Roodsari were unknown, although Trevithick was in Iran to attend \nuniversity and learn the Farsi language.\n\nThe freedom for four of the five Americans  was achieved after secret negotiations between the United States and \nIran, and was part of a prisoner swap deal that also involved amnesty for seven Iranians jailed in the United States. \nThe release  of the fifth American -- Trevithick --  was not part of the prisoner swap.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, the seven Iranians were identified by Iranian media as Nader Modanlo, Bahram \nMechanic, Khosrow Afghani, Arash Ghahreman, Tooraj Faridi, Nima Golestaneh and Ali Saboun.  All seven  were \ndetained and either charged or convicted in the United States due to their violations of prevailing sanctions.\n\nAs with the rapid resolution to the naval incident discussed above, the opening of the channels of communication \nand the diplomatic process were credited for the prisoner swap.  That being said, the diplomatic negotations aimed \nat returning the United States citizens home had been going on for some time and without public discussion of the \nmatter.  If fact, detractors of the Obama administration on the Republican side of the political aisle have long \ndecried the controversial Iranian nuclear deal by drawing attention to the fact that Rezaian, the Washington Post \ncorrespondent, remained in jail in Iran.  They argued that the United States should never have signed onto the \nnuclear deal with the likes of Rezaian in Iranian custody.  Unknown to them, however, was the fact that the Obama \nadministration was steadfastly pursuing the release of the Americans during private negotiations.\n\nIndeed, the determination of the Obama administration was supported by reports from some of the released \nprisoners up until the moments prior to their departure from Iran.  Of note was the fact that Iranian authorities tried \nto prevent Rezaian's wife, Yeganeh Salehi,  and his mother, Mary Rezaian,  from boarding the flight intended to \nevacuate the Americans;  however, representatives from the United States Department of State issued a hardline \nstance saying that the prisoner swap would be called off if Rezaian's wife and mother were not allowed to join him \non the Swiss aircraft.\n\nUltimately, four of the former prisoners -- Rezaian, Abedini, and Hekmati, Trevithick, as well as Rezaian's wife and \nmother, boarded the Swiss aircraft and departed Iran and landed in Geneva, Switzerland.  Nosratollah Khosravi-\n\n\n\nRoodsari, for unknown reasons, opted to remain in Iran.  From Switzerland, three of the four prisoners -- Rezaian, \nAbedini, and Hekmati --  were transported to  the Landstuhl army base in Germany for medical review.\n\nTrevithick returned home to Massachussetts in the United States and was immediately reunited with his family.\n\nFor his part, Rezaian -- the most well known of the prisoners in Iran -- confirmed that he was in good health.  In a \nreport by his employer, the Washington Post, he was reported to have said,  \"I want people to know that physically \nI'm feeling good. I know people are eager to hear from me but I want to process this for some time.\"  In a moment of \nlevity, Rezaian added that  he was doing \"a hell of a lot better than I was 48 hours ago.\"  Abedini issued a \nstatement thanking President Obama, his administration, and the State Department for their efforts in securing his \nrelease, which read as follows: \"I am thankful for our president and all of the hard work by the White House and \nState Department in making this happen.\"  Hekmati, who was met in Germany by his United States Congressional \nRepresentative, Dan Kildee -- a Democrat from Michigan -- used Kildee's Twitter feed to issue the following \nstatement: \"Dear Mr. President: Thank you for making my freedom and reunion wth my family possible. I am \nhumbled that you were personally involved in my case and proud to have you as my president.\"\n\nEditor's Note:  Even as amidst the celebration of the release of five Americans from Iranian custody, it is essential \nto keep in mind that there remains no shortage of people unjustly imprisoned across the world. Of note, is the \ndisturbing number of journalists in prison who have done nothing other than report the news. The Committee to \nProtect Journalists reports that close to 200 journalists are in jail across the globe.

Mogherini's statement included the declaration \nthat  Iran had \"fulfilled its commitment. \"\n\nIt should be noted that the announcement was made after the international nuclear watchdog entity, the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that Itan had complied with the dictated terms of the nuclear \nagreement, which were intended to ensure that Iran would not develop a nuclear weapon.\n\nA recapitulation of the central elements  set forth in the nuclear deal, which was formalized in July 2015 via a \nresolution in the United Nations Security Council, is as follows:\n\n-  Iran would reduce its enriched-uranium stockpile by 98 percent\n-  Iran would retain a reduced number of uranium centrifuges (5060 in total) for a ten-year period\n-  Iran would be limited to refining uranium  at only a five percent enrichment level for a fifteen-year period\n( this level is consistent for usage at a nuclear power plant and is well short of weaponization levels )\n-  Iran will allow IAEA monitors to inspect facilities under review for suspicious activity for up to 25 years\n\n( Iran does not have to submit to inspections but if it refuses it will be subject to an arbitration panel and possible \njudgement that it is in violation)\n-  Iran would be granted gradual/phased in  sanctions relief, essentially allowing Iran to finally export its oil\n-  Iran would be granted access to more than $100 billion in frozen assets pending the implementation of nuclear \ncurbs\n\n\n-  The prevailing United Nations arms embargo on Iran would  remain in place for five years\n-  The prevailing  ballistic missiles embargo on Iran would  remain in place for eight years\n_  Iran would be prohibited from  designing warheads or conducting experiments on nuclear weapons-related \ntechnology\n\nVia the social media outlet, Twitter, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani praised the development with the following \nTweet: \"I thank God for this blessing and bow to the greatness of the patient nation of Iran.\"  For his part,  President \nBarack Obama hailed the move, saying, \"This is a good day because once again we are seeing what's possible \nthrough strong American diplomacy. These things are a reminder of what we can achieve when we lead with \nstrength and with wisdom.\"  Detractors in Iran and United States respectively had a very different view of the \nsituation.  In Iran, hardliners have long argued that the Iranian government should not be in negotiations with the \nUnited States, and sign on to a deal whose terms would be dictated externally.\n\nIn the United States, conservatives have argued that the nuclear deal would result in Iran -- a state sponsor of \nterrorism -- to have access to frozen funds and re-entry to the international markets.\n\nHowever, the counterpoint argument in both Iran and the United States has been that while the agreement would \nhardly result in the normalization of relations between the two countries, there was now a diplomatic channel open \nthat was not available for decades prior.  Moreover, as noted by advocates of global security, the deal was the only \nviable way to reduce the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran.  This sentiment was clear articulated by United States \nSecretary of State John Kerry, who said, \"Today, as a result of the actions taken since last July, the United States, \nour friends and allies in the Middle East, in the entire world are safer because the threat of a nuclear weapon has \nbeen reduced.\"\n\nUnited Nations sanctions against Iran were automatically ended, but with the formal announcement by Mogherini \nand  Zarif, along with the certification of Iranian compliance by the IAEA, the European Union ceased its economic \nand financial sanctions regime against Iran, while the United States lifted its litany of commercial and financial \nsanctions that had been levied against Iran.\n\nWith the sanctions thus lifted, Iran was effectively \"open for business\" with billions dollars of assets now unfrozen, \nand with\n\nits oil now available to be sold on the international market.  Indeed, Iran immediately acted to increase its oil ouput, \nwhile international companies commenced the process of returning to Iran to pursue business deals. However, not \nall the new was positive for Iran.  By Jan. 18, 2016, the United States had imposed  fresh sanctions on \napproximately a dozen companies and individuals for their involvement in Iran's ballistic missile program.  At issue \nwas a  the fact that in October 2015, Iran had  conducted a precision-guided ballistic missile test, in violation of a \nprevailing United Nations prohibition.  As noted by Adam Szubin, the United States acting under-secretary for \nterrorism and financial intelligence, \"Iran's ballistic missile programme poses a significant threat to regional and \nglobal security, and it will continue to be subject to international sanctions.\"\n\nEditor's Note:  Regardless of the political machinations  as well as the political posturing in both Iran and United \nStates respectively, this landmark accord was being celebrated as a historic development in the realm of \ninternational diplomacy and global security.  For good of for ill, the re-integration of Iran into the global community \nwould inevitably shift the geopolitical dynamics in the Middle East.  Moreover, both President Hassan Rouhani in \nIran and President Barack Obama in the United States had made history with this landmark nuclear accord by \nmoving their two countries from a state of decades-old enmity, charting the path of diplomacy, and traversing\n\n\n\nalong the difficult road of re-engagement.  These efforts would surely define their respective political legacies.  \nWhether or not this nuclear agreement would stand the test of time and survive hardline domestic politics at home \nin Iran and the United States was to be determined, but Rouhani and Obama could take heart in the fact that they \nhad respectively honored their election promises to pursue a peaceful resolution to the Iranian nuclear issue.\n\nPrimer on 2016 parliamentary elections in Iran\n\nParliamentary elections were set to be held in Iran on Feb. 26, 2016.  The previous parliamentary elections in Iran \nwere held in 2012.\n\nAt stake in these elections would be the composition of the unicameral \"Majlis-e-Shura e Eslami\" (Islamic \nConsultative Assembly), with its 290 seats.\n\nIn that legislative body, members are elected by popular vote from single-seat constituencies to serve four-year \nterms.  It should be noted that  all candidates for parliament must be approved by the \"Shura-e-Nigahban\" (Council \nof Guardians).\n\nIt should be noted that formal political parties are a relatively new phenomenon in Iran.  That being said, political \ncandidates, regardless of party or bloc affiliation, can roughly be divided into two camps -- hardline conservatives \nand reformists respectively.  In the 2016 parliamentary elections, the Iranian election authorities (mostly controlled \nby the Council of Guardians) had rejected the candidacies of as many as 60 percent of the applicants, with the vast \nmajority of those individuals being regarded as  reformists.\n\nFormer Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani  expressed disapproval over the  disqualification of so many  \nreformist candidates, but went further in condemning the authority of the  Council of Guardians as follows: \"Who \ndecided you are qualified to judge the others? Who gave you the right to take all the guns, have all the Friday \nprayer platform and run state television?\"  This statement was regarded as an overt challenge  and reflective of a \ndeepening conflict between hardliners and reformists in Iran.\n\nIn the second week of February 2016, the  Guardians Council reversed its ban on as many as 1,500  candidates.  \nOf course, it was unknown as to whether or not a significant portion of those 1,500\n\ncandidates were actually reformers.  It was also unknown if the change in policy was motivated in any way by the \ngrowing political chasm between hardliners and reformists.  The new listing was being dispatched to the country's  \nInterior Ministry.\n\nBy election day on Feb. 26, 2016, it was apparent that a good many of the candidates who benefited from the ban \nreversal were reformists and moderates.  This was due to the fact that they actually won many seats in parliament, \nas the counting of the ballots went on, with hardliners actually losing ground.  Official results were not immediately \navailable; however, a tally by Reuters News suggested that conservatives won about 40 percent of seats, reformists \ntook about 30 percent, independents garnered 17 percent, and 13 percent would likely be subject to run-off votes.  \nOverall, the trend was away from hardline control over the legislative body.\n\nThis trend thus  indicated that Iran was charting a new political path - a view echoed in an editorial written in the \nnewspaper, Mardomsalari, which declared: \"This election can be a turning point in the history of the Islamic \nRepublic.\"\n\nAnother significant outcome of these elections was the fact that both President Hassan Rouhani and former \nPresident Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani --two known reformists -- were\n\n\n\nleading the race for membership in the Assembly of Experts, which plays an influential role in determining  Iran's \nforeign policy.  Clearly, this result revitalized the likelihood that Iran would honor its commitment with regard to the \nmultilateral denuclearization agreement intended to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.\n\nPrimer on 2017 presidential election in Iran\n\nA presidential election was set to be held in Iran on May 19, 2017. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate \ncleric, was seeking re-election and a second term.  He would be faced with a number of hardline conservative \ncandidates.  The winner of the election would determine whether or not there would be a shift in relations with the \nWest.\n\nRouhani's strongest challenger was expected to be a hardline cleric, Ebrahim Raisi, who was promising to revive \nthe values of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.  Raisi was backed by Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards, the country's \nmajor security force, the associated Basij militia, as well as several hardline clerics and  clerical groups.  The \ndecision by conservative Tehran Mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf to  withdraw from the race was expected to \nboost Raisi's prospects by consolidating the hardliner vote share.\n\nIn Iran, executive power actually lies with the supreme leader of the Islamic Revolution, as well as three oversight \nbodies: the Assembly of Experts, the Expediency Council, and the Council of Guardians. That being said, the \npresident functions as the head of government and is viewed as the \"face of the nation\" to the international \ncommunity. Although Iranians vote in popular election for president, candidates to this post are approved by the \nupper echelons of executive government.\n\nOn election day, Iranians went to the polls to cast their ballots.\n\nOnce the votes were counted, it was apparent that Rouhani would be decisively re-elected.  Indeed, according to \nthe Interior Minister, Rouhani secured 57 percent of the vote share -- significantly more than the close to 16 percent \ngarnered by his closest rival, Raisi.\n\nIt appeared that while Raisi may have benefited from a consolidated conservative and hardliner vote base, he had \nalso mobilized a counter-effect, with many people coming out to vote against him.  At issue was his background as \na judge who sentenced thousands of political prisoners to death in the 1980s, effectively underlining the terrorizing \npower of the state apparatus at times.\n\nIn his victory speech, re-elected President Hassan Rouhani promised to move Iran into the global community, \nexpanding freedoms, and advancing reforms. The re-elected Iranian President Rouhani  declared, \"Our nation's \nmessage in the election was clear: Iran's nation chose the path of interaction with the world, away from violence \nand extremism.\"\n\nIt was an act of ostensible defiance, given the prevailing power of the country's leading conservatives and hardliner \nclerics, including the Ayatollah, the Guardians Council, the Assembly of Experts, and the Revolutionary Guard. \n However, the landslide victory by Rouhani made clear that he had a mandate of sorts -- and he was wasting no \ntime in claiming it.\n\nRouhani rubbed salt in the wound of those conservatives and hardliners by even praising one of the leaders of the \nreformist camp, former President Mohammad Khatami, who cannot be quoted publicly, according to a court ruling. \nNevertheless, in public remarks, Rouhani thanked \"my dear brother, Mohammad Khatami.\"\n\nIt should be noted that although Rouhani won this election, it was unlikely that the conservative and hardline \nfactions would acquiesce to reforms easily.  In fact, it was possible that they would simply bide their time before re-\nasserting their power, yanking the chains of progress back, and returning Rouhani and the Iranian people to heel.\n\n\n\nU.S. President Trump decides to \"decertify\"  Iran nuclear deal\n\nOn Oct. 13, 2017, President Donald Trump announced that he would \"decertify\" the nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nTrump said,  \"The Iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States ever entered \ninto ... but what's done is done.\"\n\nIt should be noted that the decertification of the  deal is not the same thing as withdrawing from it, which would \nplace the United States in violation of the agreement. Instead, the actual effect would be the establishment of new \nparameters allowing  Congress to quickly (within 60 days) reimpose sanctions on Iran -- ones that would sideline \nthe Democrats in Congress from the process (essentially preventing them from filibustering it).\n\nThat being said, Trump did not actually request that Congress impose sanctions on Iran, which would  unilaterally \nbring the United States participation in the deal to an end.  Rather, he appears to have handed off that judgement to \nthe Congress. He said, \"I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies to address \nthe deal's many flaws.\"  Should the Congress opt not to act, the Iran nuclear deal would remain in place.  \n\nIt should also be noted that General James Dunford of Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as Defense Secretary James \nMattis  and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have all said Iran is in compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal, \nwhich was multilaterally forged during the time of the previous Obama administration.  Thus, Trump's \n\"decertification\" move appeared to be a mostly symbolic attempt to save Trump the annoyance of having to certify a \ndeal forged by his predecessor and nemesis, Barack Obama.\n\nCritics of Trump's move to decertify the deal have noted that allies will likely be mistrustful of the United States in \nfuture joint endeavors.\n\nIndeed, it would suggest a lack of good faith by the United states in international affairs, essentially undermining \ninternational trust in America's commitment to multilateral agreements.  This perception would likely be bolstered by \nthe fact that the Trump administration had already been disparaging of NATO, while moving to exit participation in \nthe Paris Climate Accord and UNESCO. \n\nAlert: Worst protests in Iran since 2009 Green Revolution; Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards deployed to deal with \n\"sedition\"\n\nAt the close of the year 2017, mass protests broke out in Iran.  The protests commenced in Iran's second-largest \ncity, Mashhad. They were sparked by a spike in egg and poultry prices by 40 percent, which the government \nexplained was due to fears of avian flu, but which generated a broader frustration over inflation.  Days later, well \ninto the first week of 2018, demonstrations were ongoing and had, in fact, spread to 50 cities and towns, including \nthe capital of Tehran.  Indeed, the protests were soon a nationwide phenomenon with tens of thousands of Iranians \ntaking to the streets to register their discontent with the government.\n\nThe demonstrations against appeared to have been spurred by frustrations with the Rouhani administration over \nthe ongoing economic malaise, which Iran has confronted since sanctions were imposed for its nuclear program. \n The initial burst of discontent was rooted in the fact that Iran was yet to see economic relief despite forging the \n2015 nuclear deal, which lifted some international sanctions and allowed Iran to resume selling its oil on the \ninternational market.  In fact, the lifting of the sanctions served to improve some economic fundamentals in Iran; \nhowever, inflation remained a serious problem.  As well, youth unemployment has remained high.  Thus, it was \nfrom the locus of economic anxiety that the protest movement was initially emanating.\n\n\n\nOver the course of days, though, the demonstrations took on a more political tone, with protesters registering their \nfrustration with the broader leadership of the Islamic Republic. The climate of popular anger was only exacerbated \nafter a crackdown from Tehran, which shut down social media, and as protesters clashed with authorities.  The \ndeaths of more than 20 people and the arrests of hundreds more, as the protests spread nationwide, served to \nmorph the protests from being an outburst of economic frustration into a full-blown confrontation with the country's \npower brokers.\n\nAt the heart of the matter was the reality that young Iranians wanted jobs and did not have the same intellectual or \nemotional connection to the 1979 anti-Shah revolution that ushered in Islamic rule.\n\nIn fact, the protests appeared to have become a group venue for no shortage of grievances.  For some people \njoining the protests, for example, they were focused on Iran's military support of Syrian President Bashar Assad. \nThey were particularly concerned about the government's priorities in fighting conflicts in other countries, such as \nSyria and Yemen, while money should be spent to help people struggling at home.  For other protesters, their focus \nwas outrage over corruption. Minority groups in Iran -- Kurds, Arabs, and Lurs, Balochs, for example -- were also \namong those protesting the government, driven by their longstanding grievances of marginalization and oppression.\n\nIn this way, although the protests initially commenced as a means to pressure President Rouhani over economic \nstewardship, the demonstrations were now a broader and more amorphous protest movement against political \nrepression and the government at large. No longer was it simply the Rouhani government on the radar of angry \nIranians, now, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (Iran's Supreme Leader), the 12-member Guardian Council that supervises \npolitical candidates, the Revolutionary Guard security force that reports only to the Ayatollah, and Basij militia, were \nadditional registers of outrage.\n\nIndeed, protesters were in the streets railing against  Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, even chanting \n\"death to the dictator\" -- a development unthinkable to an older generation of Iranians.  To that end, some \nprotesters were even calling for an end to the Islamic Republic and a return to the overthrown Shah monarchy.\n\nThus it was that at the start of 2018, Iran was dealing with the worst outbreak of mass discontent since the Green \nRevolution of 2009. That being said, the protests of 2017-2018 must be distinguished from the Green Revolution \nprotests of 2009 in certain significant ways.  \n\nThe primary difference was that the 2009 Green Revolution emerged out of voters' frustrations that the re-election \nof then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had been fraudulent.  By contrast, the 2017-2018 protest movement was \nsourced initially in economic grievances.  With this reality in mind, the government soon reversed its plan to raise \nfuel prices, and went further, promising financial assistance to the impoverished echelons of society. Moreover, \nRouhani's government was indicating that it might pursue a job creation plan.\n\nIt should also be noted that the Rouhani government, unlike that of Ahmadinejad in 2009, quickly made clear that \npeople had the right to protest.  To that end, Rouhani declared that people were \"absolutely free to criticize the \ngovernment and protest.\"  The government nonetheless carried out a crackdown as the demonstrations spread, \nand also cut off social media.  That move, however, was not likely to have much effect.  Whereas the 2009 Green \nRevolution was a student-led phenomenon based in Tehran, and organized on social media, the 2017-2018 \nprotests were spontaneous and nationwide.  More importantly, these protests were attracting a poorer segment of \nsociety not known for their use of social media in the first place.  In fact, there was more reliance on community \nnewsletters from ethnic communities and labor unions.\n\nOne central challenge for Iran's leadership was that the 2017-2018 protests, connecting protesters with many \ndisparate interests across the country, was a leaderless movement.  Without known leaders to target, the \n\n\n\nauthorities would find it difficult to simply round up dissident leaders and throw them in prison, as was the case in \n2009.  Overall, it would be harder for Iranians authorities to track and contain the broad national protests.  \n\nNote that by Jan. 4, 2018, Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards had been deployed to squash the anti-government \nunrest.  Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, the Revolutionary Guards commander, explained that he had ordered \nforces to be sent to Hamadan, Isfahan, and Lorestan provinces to deal with  \"sedition.\"  Soon, the head of the \nRevolutionary Guards was claiming that its  \"enemies\" had been defeated.  As well, Iranian state televisions began \nto feature pro-government rallies in various cities -- presumably to highlight that it still commanded the support of \nthe people.  Still, despite these developments, there were reports that demonstrators were risking conviction of \nrioting -- an outcome that would result in execution -- by continuing to take to the streets in protest.\n\nBy the second week of January 2018, a man arrested during Iran's anti-government protests ultimately died at the \nEvin prison in Tehran after having reportedly committed suicide. Sina Qanbari was among the more than 1,000 \npeople arrested during demonstrations. It was to be seen if Qanbari's tragic death would influence the unfolding of \nthe protests.\n\nMeanwhile, conservative hardliners were attacking reformist President Hassan Rouhani, whom they have viewed \nas a rival, on the issue of the economy.  For his part, Rouhani was channeling his political acumen to point out that \nthe protests were about  more than the economy.  He suggested that there was a broader landscape of discontent, \nwith the aging revolutionary power brokers out of touch with contemporary reality.  \n\nIn an interview with the Tasnim news agency, Rouhani said, \"It would be a misrepresentation (of events) and also \nan insult to Iranian people to say they only had economic demands.\" He added, \"People had economic, political and \nsocial demands.\"  He highlighted the cultural chasm between the aging revolutionary power brokers and Iranian \nyouth -- the locus of the protest movement --  saying, \"We cannot pick a lifestyle and tell two generations after us to \nlive like that. It is impossible... The views of the young generation about life and the world is different than ours.\"\n\nTrump and intelligence community disagree; Democratic leader calls for intelligence officials to stage an \n\"intervention\" with Trump\n\nThe start of 2019 was marked by a contretemps between President Donald Trump and the United States \nintelligence community over Iran's nuclear activities and ambitions.  The situation led to calls from the highest \nranking Democrat in the Senate for intelligence officials to stage an \"intervention\" with the United States president \nand \"educate\" him about intelligence findings.\n\nIn 2018, Trump withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear agreement, hoping that other signatory nation \nstates -- the United Kingdom, France, China, Russia and Germany -- would follow suit.  They did not.  Trump also \nhoped that the re-imposition of sanctions on Iran would force diminish Iran's influence in the Middle East. But his \neffort was not backed by international support.\n\nIn late January 2019, the director Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, testified before the Senate \n Intelligence Committee that Iran was not seeking to develop nuclear weapons capabilities.  He said, \"We do not \nbelieve Iran is currently undertaking activities we judge necessary to produce a nuclear device.\"\n\nGina Haspel, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), also testified before the Senate committee. Haspel \nsaid that despite Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, Iran was \"making some preparations that \nwould increase their ability to take a step back.\"\n\nBoth these insights expressed by Coats and Haspel were at odds with the president who has throughout insisted \nthat Iran was  trying to develop nuclear weapons and the nuclear deal was a failure.\n\n\n\nIn response, Trump issued tweeted: \"The Intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it \ncomes to the dangers of Iran. They are wrong!\"  Trump also said via Twitter: \"Perhaps Intelligence should go back \nto school!\"\n\nThese declarations by Trump spurred rare bipartisan concurrence from Congress with members of Congress on \nboth sides of the aisle rebuking the president for trying to subvert the information provided by the professionals in \nthe United States intelligence community.  Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat, accused  Trump of \"undermining\" the \nintelligence community while, Senator John Thune, a Republican, said that he would prefer if the president stayed \noff the social media outlet, Twitter.\n\nIran entered the fray, making hay of the contretemps brewing in the United States.  Iranian Foreign Minister \nMohammad Javad Zarif emphasized the fact that United States intelligence agencies \"contradicted\" the United \nStates commander-in-chief, Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer sent a letter to Director of National Intelligence, saying that it \nwas \"incumbent\" on Coats,  CIA Director Gina Haspel, and FBI Director Christopher Wray, to stop the president \nfrom harming the integrity of the intelligence community.\n\nSchumer wrote, \"You cannot allow the President's ill-advised and unwarranted comments today to stand. He is \nputting you and your colleagues in an untenable position and hurting the national interest in the process. You must \nfind a way to make that clear to him.\"\n\nSchumer called on them to make Trump understand \"the facts and raw intelligence underlying the Intelligence \nCommunity assessments.\"  He added, \"Impress upon him how critically important it is for him to join you and the \nleadership of our intelligence community in speaking with a unified and accurate voice about national security \nthreats.\"\n\nIn his letter, Schumer also scathingly characterized Trump's criticism of the intelligence community and its findings \nas \"extraordinarily inappropriate.\"\n\nVia Twitter, Schumer declared that it was \"past time for U.S. Intelligence Community leaders to stage an \nintervention\" with the president.\n\nIt should be noted that a day after claiming that intelligence officials were \"wrong,\" President Trump blamed the \nnews media of inaccurately representing the testimony of intelligence officials.  In fact, however, that testimony by \nintelligence officials was made publicly, on the record, with a transcript, and broadcast on CSpan. \n\n-- February 2019\n\nWritten by Dr. Denise Youngblood Coleman.\n\nGeneral sources used in all Country Reviews are available in the Bibliography.\n\nSupplementary sources used to compose body of entry for \"Iran Country Review - Political Conditions\" : New York \nTimes; BBC News; Washington Post; Reuters; NTIS News; United States National Intelligence Estimate; \nGovernment of Iran; Government of United States; United Nations; International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\nSpecific sources used to compose \"Primer on 2009 Presidential Election\" : BBC News, ABC News, NBC News, \nCNN, Reuters, Agence France Presse, Associated Press, New York Times,  al-Jazeera, al-Arabiya, Harvard School \nof Journalism's Tehran Bureau, National Iranian American Committee, and the Brookings Institute.\n"}
