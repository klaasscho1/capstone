{"title": "Letters, Faxes & E-Mail: U.S. welcoming to foreigners", "body": "\nThe editorial \"Immigrants deserve better welcome\" (Aug. 12) suggests that illegal immigrants be granted legal \nrepresentation.ConstitutionIt takes little imagination to see the backlog this would create in the courts. This would \nincrease the detention time and only delay the inevitable deportation. This is a remarkable country that welcomes \nforeigners to settle here. The INS treats these people with courtesy and correctness. I know whereof I speak for I \nam a legal immigrant.\n\nBOB JOHNSON\n\nJohnson, of Lilburn, is an engineer.\n"}
