Under the \nprogram, the State Department gives out 50,000 immigrant visas to people who come from countries with low rates \nof immigration to the U.S.\n\n\"The issue here is waiting until the last minute and that's their choice,\" said Kelly Shannon, a spokeswoman at the \nBureau of Consular Affairs.\n\nWhile prior lotteries took applications only by mail, this one tried to curb fraud by requiring applications to be \nsubmitted electronically.\n\nAn estimated 800,000 people were successful in submitting their electronic applications in the last three days of the \nlottery, Shannon said. Before that, more than 5.4 million people worldwide applied for the random drawing, she \nsaid.\n\nKim Nichols, co-executive director of the African Services Committee in Harlem, said many lessons were learned.\n\n\"The State Department should have advised the public to apply early and should also improve their server's \ncapacity to make sure they can handle all the applicants,\" she said.\n"}
