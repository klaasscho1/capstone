They expect to become citizens within a year.\n\nU.S. Rep. Romano Mazzoli (D-Ky.) gave the keynote speech to group, which included immigrants from four \ncontinents and numerous islands. Former citizens of India and Nigeria were the most numerous, with more than 30 \nnew citizens from each.\n\nSharon and Errol Babb of College Park, formerly of Trinidad and Tobago, have lived in the United States for 25 \nyears and have three children who were born here. Their 4-year-old sat with them during the ceremony.\n\nMazzoli, whose Italian-born father was naturalized 75 years ago, urged opponents of immigration to consider the \nbenefits immigration brings the United States. \"The myths of immigration are that it deletes, depletes, denies and \nreduces,\" said the congressman. In fact, \"it enhances and restores, refreshes and strengthens.\"\n\nHe urged the new citizens to become a fuller part of the United States by registering to vote and serving as an \nexample to their communities.\n\n \n\n\"The American dream exists - it is alive and well,\" Mazzoli said.\n"}
