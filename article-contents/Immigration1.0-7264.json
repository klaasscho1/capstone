{"title": "Letters, Faxes & E-Mail: Target illegal immigrants;2000 CENSUS", "body": "\nI was astounded to learn that the \"census crisis\" I keep hearing about centers on the need to make certain that we \ncount all illegal immigrants to ensure that they receive proper amounts of taxpayer money and full representation \nin Congress (\"Latinos reluctant to be counted,\" Local News, Aug. 15). In addition, we are assuring them that they \nwon't be reported to the immigration or tax authorities.AJCIn fact, it is the census workers who can be fined and go \nto jail for turning in the lawbreaking immigrants.\n\nThis policy is absurd and unfair to those who wait months or even years to enter America legally. Instead of wasting \nmoney to hire people to locate illegal immigrants, we ought to spend it to hire more INS agents to locate them and \nsend them home.\n\nNANCY DESMOND\n\nMarietta\n"}
