{"title": "New Challenges In Fighting AIDS", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\n     Your Aug. 19 front-page article \"With Fears Fading, More Gays Spurn Old Preventive Message\" sheds light on \nthe fact that developments in AIDS treatment and education have also created corresponding challenges. \n\nBut it is important to note that the complexities of risk-taking and decision-making are exacerbated for those \nconfronting racism, poverty and homophobia. \n\n These forces, along with limited access to health care and support, conspire both to inflate risk in their lives and \nconstrict decision-making dramatically, resulting in a disparately high rate of H.I.V. infection and AIDS in gay \ncommunities of color, especially African-American and Latino communities.\n\nANA OLIVEIRA\n\nExecutive Director\n\nGay Men's Health Crisis\n\nNew York, Aug. 23, 2001\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
