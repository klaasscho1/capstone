{"title": "Visa process bans wedding guest", "body": "\nMy son met his wife in Romania while volunteering and teaching in the public schools. She is a medical student in \nher last year. They married last year and currently live in Romania while she prepares for her exit exams.\n\nNow she has applied for a visitor's visa so she can come to the USA for my youngest son's wedding. Little did we \ndid know that being married to a U.S. citizen is actually detrimental.\n\nShe is no longer eligible for a visitor's visa. She was told at the U.S. Embassy that because she is married to a U.S. \ncitizen, she must go through the immigration process to get a visa.\n\nUnfortunately, we all know that the immigration process is expensive, complicated and time-consuming. There is \nno way she can get a visa before my youngest son's wedding on May 26. We were told that October would be the \nsoonest.\n\nMy son and his wife did not want to begin the immigration process. Now they will be forced to do so just so they \ncan visit us. My husband and I have hired a lawyer because we have heard too many horror stories.\n\nRelatives and friends have suggested that we hold the wedding in Mexico. At least there, she could attend the \nwedding.\n\nJudy Drinkall\n\nCapron, Ill. \n"}
