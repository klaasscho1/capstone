{"title": "Don't Punish Aliens With Death by Illness", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nIt is understandable that Alan C. Nelson, Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization Services, should be \nconcerned about encouraging illegal immigration (letter, Sept. 18). But his contention that giving Medicaid to those \naliens would cause ''a dangerous erosion of the Federal Government's ability to control illegal immigration'' is \ndifficult to understand.\n\nIf the Government knows a Medicaid patient is an illegal alien, steps can be taken to deport that individual. \nHowever, while he is in our country, we cannot as humane people allow him to die, of hunger or of illness. Even \nconvicted murderers in our prisons are given food and medical aid.\n\nOur immigration laws must be obeyed, but violation of them is not punishable by death from illness, especially \nillness that may spread to our own citizens if untreated.\n\nPeople who have taken all the risks of entering this country illegally must have powerful motives to get away from \ntheir native lands. Therefore, offering them minimal care while they are here will not result in ''a further attraction to \nimmigrate or stay here illegally.''\n\n \n\nRENA G. KUNIS\n\n  Bellerose, N.Y., Sept. 18, 1986\n"}
