Jan Brewer asked President Obama yesterday to send her National Guard troops \nand build a fence to keep illegal immigrants from crossing the Mexican border.\n\n\"We know that we're not going to agree on certain issues until other issues are worked out. And so we are going to \nbegin some really, more direct, dialogue in a couple of weeks,\" Brewer said.\n\nThe long-awaited meeting was not a showdown between the governor of the state with a tough new anti-\nimmigration law and a President who opposes that statute because he fears it could lead to ethnic profiling. It was \ndescribed by both sides as very cordial.\n\nBrewer said she struck out on her request for construction on a fence on the border, but she was confident \nArizona will get some of the 1,200 National Guard personnel and $500 million Obama announced that he is \nsending to the border.\n"}
