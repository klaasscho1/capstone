{"title": "Editorial: Immigration reform on hold. So is sanity on drug war", "body": "\nMexican leaders were disappointed Monday to hear President Barack Obama's frank pronouncement on \nimmigration reform: It is not on the front burner this year. And if it weren't for all the other pots boiling over on \nObama's front burner   the economy, health care reform, energy   we'd be disappointed, too.\n\nImmigration issues languished for eight years under the Bush administration, which fiddled with enforcement but \nfailed at the difficult task of winning consensus, or at least majority support, on fundamental reform.\n\nBut perhaps the further wait provides time for a more thoughtful approach to what's now the central cross-border \nissue   the drug cartels that grip Mexico. They are armed with guns from the United States and driven by the \ninsatiable demands of the U.S. drug market.\n\nObama's statements at the North American summit in Guadalajara seemed to reinforce the status quo for both the \nUnited States and Mexico. He may have had little choice, given his inability to promise quick work on real reform. \nBut we hope for better from the president when border issues with Mexico do heat up in Washington.\n"}
