{"title": "PULSE;Immigration", "body": "\nImmigration in this region jumped in the 1990's after a series of visa programs aimed at countries \"adversely \naffected\" by the stricter immigration controls enacted in 1965. As these new immigrants use familial ties to sponsor \npeople, legal immigration should continue to rise, experts predict. The latest immigration sweepstakes is the \nDiversity Immigrant Visa Lottery. It will make 55,000 permanent resident visas available annually to people from \ncountries with low rates of immigration to the U.S. such as Japan and most of Western Europe. As a nation's rate \nrises or falls, it can be removed from or added to the list of eligible countries. New York City planners expect more \npeople from eastern Europe and Africa as a result of the new program. The mail-in period for the first \"DV-1\" visas \nis June 1 to June 30.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nChart: \"Immigration\" shows the 1995 Diversity Immigrant Visa Lottery and number of immigrants to the \nmetropolitan area from 1986 to 1992.
