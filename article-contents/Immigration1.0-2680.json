{"title": "S.F. DECLARES IMMIGRANT 'SAFETY ZONE'", "body": "\nAs state and federal governments move to cut benefits to some immigrants, San Francisco is bucking the trend \nby declaring the city a \"safety zone\" for all immigrants, including those here illegally.\n\nThe San Francisco Board of Supervisors has also voted to make a \"good-faith effort\" to provide translators at \nboard meetings for any non-English speaker who asks for one at least 48 hours in advance.\n\nThe legislation, which Mayor Willie Brown is expected to sign, says non-citizens, including illegal immigrants, will \nnot be denied social service and health-care benefits in San Francisco.\n\nThat puts the city in direct opposition to California's voter-approved Proposition 187. The 1994 immigration initiative \nseeks to cut off most state services to illegal aliens. It has yet to be enforced because of court challenges.\n\n\"If any city is going to stand up for equal rights, it's San Francisco, and I think the rest of the nation expects that \nfrom us,\" said Supervisor Mabel Teng, chief sponsor of the legislation.\n"}
