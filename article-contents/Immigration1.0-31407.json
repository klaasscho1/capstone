{"title": "Advocated for immigrants from Central America", "body": "\nSaul Solorzano, who escaped the bloody tumult of civil war in his native El Salvador and became a seasoned \nleader of an advocacy organization for Central American refugees in Washington, died Aug. 17 at Washington \nHospital Center. He was 49.\n\nSince 1994, Mr. Solorzano had been the top executive of the Central American Resource Center, known as \nCarecen. His death, after falling down steps at his home in Northwest Washington, was confirmed by Milly \nRodriguez, Carecen's board chairwoman and an official with the American Federation of Government Employees.\n\n\"Carecen is the most important anchor organization in our region for Central Americans and, more importantly, \nSalvadoran immigrants,\" said Lori Kaplan, executive director of the Latin American Youth Center in Washington. \n\n\"Without Carecen and Saul's leadership, many of our Salvadoran residents would not have had a pathway to \ncitizenship, would not have had access to affordable housing and would not have been able to get the services and \nsupport that Carecen provides them,\" Kaplan said. \"Saul's long-term leadership was critical to the strength of \nCarecen and its ability to help thousands of people over the last several decades.\"\n\nMr. Solorzano helped expand Carecen's mission from helping immigrants seek political asylum to helping them \nbecome permanent residents and U.S. citizens. \n\nIn addition to promoting civic engagement and economic development among the region's tens of thousands of \nSalvadorans, Mr. Solorzano helped advocate successfully for legislation that sought to improve the immigration \nprospects of Central Americans, particularly refugees. \n\nMost of the measures were imperfect, he said, but provided \"a window of opportunity to help people find a \npermanent solution.\"\n\nMr. Solorzano was one of the roughly 1 million Salvadorans who fled to the United States and neighboring countries \nduring a 12-year civil war between violent leftist guerillas and a U.S.-backed military regime that engaged in human \nrights abuses. \n\nBefore a truce in 1992, an estimated 75,000 Salvadorans died. Countless families were torn apart.\n\n\nCarecen was formed in 1981 to address the compelling needs of a generation of Salvadorans who found \nthemselves in the Washington area after being granted temporary refugee status because of the war. Many lacked \nthe skills or resources to find housing, jobs and health care.\n\nLong involved in aiding refugees, Mr. Solorzano joined Carecen in the early 1990s. He battled strong political forces \nintent on curbing immigration under any circumstances, including an effort by some in Congress to end a 1990 \nprogram that offered temporary refugee status to Salvadorans during the civil war.\n\n\"In El Salvador, they came here because five factions were going in and chopping each other to pieces,\" then-Sen. \nAlan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.) said on the Senate floor in 1994, soon before he was poised to become chairman of an \nimmigration subcommittee. \"And now that is all over. You have democratic elections. Have one of them gone back? \nNot one.\"\n\nThe Clinton administration ended the temporary refugee program for the 200,000 Salvadorans living in the United \nStates. Immigration officials said that there would not be wide-scale deportations. \n\nRegarded as a skilled political strategist, Mr. Solorzano formed partnerships with members of Congress and other \nimmigrant-rights groups to shape laws that would provide chances for a green card.\n\nHe continued to oppose periodic efforts, most recently by the Bush administration in 2005, to end special \nprotections for Salvadoran immigrants stemming from the 1980s civil war. \n\nThe initial protections were ordered by a federal judge after a class-action lawsuit claimed that U.S. immigration \nofficials had used threats and other forms of rough treatment to discourage Salvadorans from applying for political \nasylum.\n\nAt times, Mr. Solorzano expressed the bitter feelings of many Salvadorans toward the baffling standards used in \ndeciding who achieved special rights in the immigration process. Some, he said, thought that Nicaraguans seeking \nasylum from the left-wing Sandinista regime were favored.\n\n\"In the 1980s, President Reagan said the Salvadorans were coming for economic reasons, that we weren't political \nrefugees,\" Mr. Solorzano told the Star-Ledger of Newark in 2000. \"Any Nicaraguan who showed up at the border \nand said he hated the Sandinistas was granted asylum.\" \n\nSaul Antonio Solorzano Maga\u00c3\u00b1a was born Oct. 14, 1961, in the capital of San Salvador. His parents sold goods in \na marketplace. \n\nRodriguez, the Carecen chairwoman, said Mr. Solorzano was studying to become an electrician when he left to live \nwith an aunt in Los Angeles. He sold tamales and became increasingly drawn into refugee-aid efforts. He later \nbecame a U.S. citizen.\n\nOver the years, Mr. Solorzano was an outreach worker for a refugee center in Hempstead, on Long Island, and a \nvolunteer coordinator at the Spanish Educational Development Center in Washington. In 1992, he was hired at \nCarecen as associate director and soon became the public face of the organization as its leader.\n\nHe sat on civil rights review panels in the District, raised money for earthquake victims in Central America, \ncampaigned against gentrification and predatory lending practices that threatened the livelihood of low-income \nLatinos, and spoke out against immigration raids on undocumented restaurant workers.\n\nHe received a bachelor's degree in business management from the University of the District of Columbia in 2002 \nand a master's in public administration from American University in 2005. \n\nHaving long worked in advocacy and politics, he made an unsuccessful bid in January for an at-large seat on the \nD.C. Council in a special election to replace Kwame R. Brown (D), who became the council's chairman. \n\nSurvivors include his companion, Wendy Ramirez, and their daughter, Joan, both of Washington; and four sisters.\n\n\n\nIn interviews, Mr. Solorzano spoke of the profound impact that Central American immigrants have had in the \nlarger community. Many of them play vital functions in the service industry, in hotels and restaurants, or mowing \nlawns and cleaning buildings. \n\nAllowing them a way to achieve citizenship, he said, would improve their lives by permitting them to make more \nmoney, buy homes and attend schools. \"It means more stability in the community,\" he told The Washington Post, \n\"and less abuse.\" \n\nbernsteina@washpost.com\n"}
