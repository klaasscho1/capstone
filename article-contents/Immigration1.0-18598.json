{"title": "Metro Briefing  New York: Manhattan: Rally For McCain Immigration Bill", "body": "\nSenator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, received a hero's welcome yesterday from 800 immigrants and other \nNew Yorkers as he championed a federal immigration bill on the home turf of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, \nwho could be his opponent if they both run for the presidency in 2008. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of \nMassachusetts, is co-sponsor of the bill, which would create a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants now in the \ncountry if they pay fines, successfully complete background checks, learn English, and work for a period of years. \nRepresentatives Charles B. Rangel and Anthony D. Weiner, both Democrats, joined Mr. McCain to support the bill.   \nPATRICK HEALY (NYT)\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
