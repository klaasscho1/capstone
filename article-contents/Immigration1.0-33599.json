{"title": "In brief", "body": "\nCuba political reformsCuba's top legislative body will no longer include members of the country's historical \ngeneration of former rebels, part of a broader political reform that began yesterday. Members of the National \nAssembly voted near-unanimously for Miguel-D\u00edaz Canel, 59, to remain president. They also voted for 75-year-old \nEsteban Lazo to remain head of the National Assembly. \n\nLazo also becomes head of the top legislative body, a post previously held by D\u00edaz-Canel and his predecessors \nRa\u00fal Castro and Fidel Castro. On paper, the changes divide the powers once held by Fidel and then Ra\u00fal Castro, \nwho held all of the country's most important positions.Nuremberg trials public Audio recordings from the Nuremberg \ntrials of Nazi leaders will be made available to the public for the first time in digital form after nearly two years of \nwork conducted in secret.

The files capture several hundred hours of the first, high-profile trial of top Nazi leaders in Nuremberg, \nGermany, after World War II. Now, curious listeners will be able to listen to the entirety of the judicial proceedings in \nreading rooms at the Hague, the Shoah Memorial in Paris, and the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.

Captive officers paraded Anti-government protesters have \nparaded captive police officers on a stage, defying Ecuadorian authorities who are seeking dialogue with \nopponents, particularly indigenous groups, after more than a week of deadly unrest. The brazen act occurred in the \ncapital Quito, at a cultural center where indigenous protesters are based as they press demands, including an end \nto fuel price hikes. The government's removal of fuel subsidies has plunged Ecuador into upheaval, triggering \nprotests, looting, clashes with security forces, the blocking of highways and the suspension of parts of its oil \nindustry.  \n\n- Agencies     \n"}
