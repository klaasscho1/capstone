{"title": "CLINTONS & GORE HEADLINING EVENT", "body": "\nWASHINGTON - President Clinton, Vice President Gore and Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton hope to \nraise $2.2 million in New York tonight for their party, marking the first time this campaign the troika has shared a \nstage.\n\nAll three plan to speak at the dinner at the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers during the event sponsored by the \nDemocratic National Committee.\n\nEarlier in the day, the President will attend a $500,000 luncheon fund-raiser for GOP-turned-Democrat Rep. Mike \nForbes, even though the one-time Long Island Republican voted to impeach Clinton.\n\nThe spotlight, however, will be on the highly anticipated, side-by-side-by-side appearance of the Clintons and \nGore, which comes as the President is under fire by the GOP and some Democrats over the handling of the Elian \nGonzalez custody case.\n\nThe President and First Lady share the opinion that the Justice Department and Immigration and Naturalization \nService pursued the right legal course, but Gore has said the case should be settled in family court and not by \nimmigration officials.\n\nBut aides to all three say those differences will give way for a Democratic lovefest expected to draw 1,000 \npartisans.\n\n\"Al Gore has had this position since December and January, so people know Al Gore is in a different place than the \nadministration on this particular issue,\" said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane.\n"}
