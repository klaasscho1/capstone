{"title": "S.F. stores raided for alleged Versace counterfeiting", "body": "\nFederal agents raided five San Francisco antique shops in the heart of the city's tourist districts Wednesday for \nselling fake Versace furniture, dinnerware and art, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nThe same stores were targeted earlier this month when agents arrested 28 foreigners who were illegally employed \nby the companies. In that raid, authorities also sought evidence of the illegal shipment of hippopotamus ivory.\n\nThe latest search was prompted after a New York-based buyer for Versace last week visited three stores in San \nFrancisco's Union Square shopping area -- Lloyd's Fine Art and Antiques, Kings Fine Art and Antiques and Gioia \nFine Art, authorities said.\n\nThe buyer reported spotting furniture, lamps, ceramics and other items being sold as Versace, but the ``shapes of \nthe products, their quality and the intricacy of their patterns were not as good as genuine Versace,'' according to a \nsearch warrant affidavit.\n\nThe buyer said ``several of the stores were telling people that the items were Versace.''\n\nThe other stores raided Wednesday were King's Fine Art and Antiques showroom and Buckingham Palace Fine \nArt.\n\nThe joint investigation by Immigration, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife remains \nongoing.\n\n``The trafficking of counterfeit goods is a global enterprise that robs legitimate companies of billions of dollars in \nrevenues every year,'' said Charles DeMore, a spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n"}
