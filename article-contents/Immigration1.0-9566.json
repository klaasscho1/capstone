Official Census 2000 numbers on foreign-born residents could be released \nwithin a year.\n\nA separate survey released Tuesday by the Center for Immigration Studies, based on census figures, found that \nwhile the biggest immigrant populations were in California, New York and Florida, states with fast-growing \npopulations overall like Colorado, North Carolina and Nevada each experienced jumps of more than 180 percent \nsince 1990.\n\nThe percentage of immigrants among Americans has increased steadily since 1970, from 4.7 percent to 10.4 \npercent in 2000, according to the center, a Washington-based think tank that supports stricter controls on \nimmigration.\n\nMark Mather, an analyst with the Population Reference Bureau, a non-profit Washington research group, said that \nstates along the coasts and with big urban centers continue to attract the most newcomers to America.\n\nBut, \"the foreign-born population is increasing everywhere,\" Mather said. \"They are moving out of the coastal \nareas, but it's a slow process.\"\n\nAbout 37 percent of foreign-born residents were naturalized citizens, the Census Bureau said in its report.\n"}
