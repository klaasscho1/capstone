{"title": "RADIO REV, PAL CHARGED IN IMMIGRANT SCHEME", "body": "\nA popular radio evangelist and an associate were arrested on charges they bilked dozens of immigrants in a \nmassive green card scam exposed by the Daily News, authorities said yesterday.\n\nThe Rev. Errol O'Connor won the confidence of immigrants through his popular Jesus is Lord Ministries program \non WWDJ (970 AM) radio and from the pulpit of his Royal Worship Center International on Laconia Ave. in the \nWilliamsbridge, the Bronx.\n\nThe 48-year-old self-styled apostle allegedly took at least $260,000 from dozens of undocumented immigrants with \nfalse promises of helping them get permanent residence status, authorities said.\n\nAlso arrested was Emanuel Felder, 33, of Argyle Ave., Uniondale, L.I., who allegedly posed as an Immigration and \nNaturalization Service agent in the scam.\n\nThe two were arrested and charged with numerous counts of grand larceny, scheming to defraud and criminal \npossession of stolen property. Felder also was charged with criminal impersonation. They face a maximum of \nseven years behind bars for each count.\n\nThe two men bilked victims of an average of $4,000 each, according to Bronx prosecutors. One man allegedly paid \n$18,000 hoping to get a green card for himself, his wife and two children; another coughed up $10,000.\n\nOne suspect is still at large, investigators said.\n\nThe News exposed the scam in April, after receiving numerous complaints about O'Connor from immigrants, many \nof whom said they had turned over their life's savings in the hope of becoming legal residents.\n\nAfter authorities began investigating, more than 200 immigrants showed up at a meeting with detectives.\n\nOne of them, an undocumented domestic worker who asked to be identified only as Jean, said yesterday she was \n\"delighted that they caught him.\" But, she added, \"I am still out $5,000 and no closer to legal residency. I hope they \nforce him to pay us all back.\"\n"}
