{"title": "Where Cities Help Detain Immigrants", "body": "\nTaylor, Texas, is a suburb around 30 miles northeast of Austin that boasts its history as a railroad hub and small-\ntown authenticity. In 2016, more than half of Williamson County\u00e2(EURO)\"where Taylor is seated\u00e2(EURO)\"           \nvoted for Donald Trump. But recently, county officials decided not to help the president in his push to            \nexpand the detention of unauthorized migrants, including those seeking asylum.On June 26, in a            regularly \nplanned county court meeting, the future of Taylor\u00e2(EURO)(TM)s T. Don Hutto detention center was first on the \nagenda. A county contractwith U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) requires it to oversee the 500-\nbed facility exclusively for migrant women\u00e2(EURO)\"in return for $8,000 per month and $1 daily for each detainee \nhoused. Before the item was put to vote, Commissioner            Terry Cook, the only Democrat on the Williamson \nCounty Court, made a passionate statement.\u00e2(EURO)oeIf the court does vote to terminate the contract, and I hope \nthey do, no one should be celebrate or take credit for this termination. This does not solve that larger \nissue,\u00e2(EURO) she said to the audience, some of whom were holding up anti-Hutto            signs. \u00e2(EURO)oeBut it \ndoes allow us to go back and perform core county functions of health, roads, safety, and all those other items that \nwe are tasked with doing in Williamson County, and every other county in the nation.\u00e2(EURO)When she finished, \nthe council voted 4-1 to terminate the agreement, a decision that was greeted with a sharp eruption of claps and \n\u00e2(EURO)oewoo-hoos.\u00e2(EURO)It\u00e2(EURO)(TM)s not just Williamson County, though. \n\nIn the last few weeks, a handful of localities have taken action to end contracts with federal immigration authorities \nto jail immigrants, as anti-detention activists have long been pushing them to do, including Springfield, Oregon, and       \n     Sacramento, California. Even Atlanta, Georgia,            is considering it. The Trump administration\u00e2(EURO)(TM)s \npractice of            separating migrant families at the border, now           suspended, has left localities scrambling to \nunderstand what role they play. And in some places, the crisis appears to have triggered a moral reckoning about \nthe ways local governments participate in immigrant detention.For those who are troubled by these relationships, \ntake note: There are around 850 contracts between local and federal authorities to detain immigrants in 669 \ncounties, according to ICE data from November 2017.* Some of these facilities are primarily for immigrants. Many \nare local jails or county prisons that rent out beds to federal authorities for immigrant detention.The majority of \nplaces where these contracts have sprung up voted for Trump in 2016, but there are several diverse, Democrat-\nleaning counties that have signed up to jail large numbers of immigrants, too. Some are even considered \n\u00e2(EURO)oesanctuary cities\u00e2(EURO) because they limit police cooperation with ICE.Here\u00e2(EURO)(TM)s what those \nrelationships look like.Where have local governments contracted with the feds?CityLab and location intelligence \ncompany ESRI have mapped all the contracts local governments have with ICE and the U.S. Marshals Service \n(called intergovernmental service agreements) that can be used to detain immigrants, based on the most            \ncomprehensive dataset available. (Click through for the            full-screen version.) Immigrants\u00e2(EURO)(TM) rights \ngroups obtained this data, which goes up to November 2017, through a Freedom of Information (FOIA) request.The \nblue dots in the map above are facilities like local jails, operated by the city or county; the green dots are facilities \nthat might be owned or overseen by local governments, but are operated by private prison companies. The size of \nthe dot corresponds with the average daily population in November 2017 at that facility, wherever that information \nwas available.Clicking on a facility            on the map above revealsdetails of its usage, contract terms (like the \nmoney it\u00e2(EURO)(TM)s earning per day to take in immigrants), and results of its last government inspection, which \n\n\ndetermines whether or not it is \u00e2(EURO)oeauthorized\u00e2(EURO) for use. Not all of the facilities on the map are \n\u00e2(EURO)oeonline\u00e2(EURO)\u00e2(EURO)\"meaning, either they\u00e2(EURO)(TM)re not authorized, or not readily being used \nto detain immigrants right now. But as long as they have live contracts, the federal government can hypothetically \nutilizethem within a short time frame. Some of these contracts were first used back in the 1980s, and many others \nhave come up under both Republican and Democrat administrations;            both parties played a role in \ndeveloping the current immigrant detention system.There were around 110 publicly operated facilities actively \ntaking in immigrants in November 2017, per this data. The ones with the highest average daily populations:            \nYork County Prison in Pennsylvania,            Essex County Correctional Facility and Hudson County Correctional \nFacility in New Jersey,            Theo Lacy Facility in California,           Glades County Detention Center in Florida, \nand            Etowah County Jail in Alabama.What is the oversight of these facilities?To be \n\u00e2(EURO)oeauthorized,\u00e2(EURO) a facility needs to have passed the requisite number of inspections. But when the \nNational Immigrant Justice Center (NIJC)            analyzed this dataset, it found that even facilities where multiple \npeople had died\u00e2(EURO)\"some as \u00e2(EURO)oea            result of            medical neglect\u00e2(EURO)\u00e2(EURO)\"had \nbeen passing inspections since 2012. A            report released in June 2018 by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity\u00e2(EURO)(TM)s Office of Inspector General found other reasons to question the rigor of government \noversight. It concludedthat the inspections of ICE detention facilities were too infrequent and too broad. The \nparticular type of inspection the government conducts at the local facilities with which it has contracts were \n\u00e2(EURO)oeuseless,\u00e2(EURO) according to ICE employees interviewed by the OIG. They were \u00e2(EURO)oevery, \nvery, very difficult to fail,\u00e2(EURO) the ICE employees said in the report.\u00e2(EURO)oeThis report confirms what the \npeople behind bars in immigration jails already know: Migrants in detention suffer abuses, rights deprivations, and \nneglect, and ICE has no interest in investigating or remedying these harms,\u00e2(EURO) said Heidi Altman, \nNIJC\u00e2(EURO)(TM)s director of policy in a statement about the OIG report. NIJC\u00e2(EURO)(TM)s analysis of \nICE\u00e2(EURO)(TM)s dataset also revealed that in November 2017, the agency was detaining roughly 98 people a \nday in jails listed as \u00e2(EURO)oenot inspected.\u00e2(EURO)ICE responded by saying in an email to CityLab that its \nEnforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) division \u00e2(EURO)oehas already initiated several steps to \nbolster\u00e2(EURO) the quality of inspections at contract facilities and \u00e2(EURO)oewill re-evaluate the existing \ninspection scope and methodology\u00e2(EURO) for annual and biennial inspections.What kinds of places sign up for \nthese contracts?The second map below allows a more detailed look. Toggling the firstcheck boxallows a \n\u00e2(EURO)oecluster\u00e2(EURO) view, where the bigger circles signal a larger concentration of contracts. Toggling the \nsecond check box for \u00e2(EURO)oepoint locations\u00e2(EURO) and one of the last four options on the right of the map \npulls up the locations of these contracts against base maps showing the political, economic, and demographic \ncharacteristics of the counties. (This map below doesn\u00e2(EURO)(TM)t work well on all mobile devices, so            \nclick through here for a full-screen version.)Around 71 percent of these counties voted for Trump; in 73 percent, \nthe white population was overrepresented (greater than the 60.3 percent national share per ESRI\u00e2(EURO)(TM)s \n2018 data); and in 66.5 percent, the median household income was below the national threshold based on \nESRI\u00e2(EURO)(TM)s data.Detention contracts are not,however, a partisan practice: Some immigrant-rich, \nDemocrat-leaning counties help detain very large numbers of immigrants. Among the top ten Democrat-voting \njurisdictions within immigrant-friendly states with the highest numbers of detained immigrants: Orange and San \nBernardino counties in California and Prince Edward County in Virginia. (Orange County            voted for Hillary \nClinton in 2016 but is among California counties            pushing back against the state\u00e2(EURO)(TM)s \n\u00e2(EURO)oesanctuary law.\u00e2(EURO)) The list also includes Essex, Hudson, and Bergen counties in New Jersey, \nwhere the new governor            campaigned on the promiseof following California\u00e2(EURO)(TM)s lead and enacting \n\u00e2(EURO)oesanctuary\u00e2(EURO) legislation\u00e2(EURO)\"limiting the cooperation of localities with federal immigration \nauthorities.\u00e2(EURO)oeWhat the map does is highlight the entrepreneurial nature of detention,\u00e2(EURO) writes \nDaniel Stageman, professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York via \nemail. \u00e2(EURO)oeThese facilities thrive on the borders where immigrant populations meet the political and \neconomic conditions that make detention \u00e2(EURO)~markets\u00e2(EURO)(TM) profitable: voter support, a willing or \neager (primarily white) labor force, the right infrastructure, etc.\u00e2(EURO)Does the cost-benefit tally add up for local \njails?With its push to round up undocumented immigrants in the interior of the country, the Trump administration \nappears to have increased its reliance on its existing agreements with local governments. The federal government \nhas been securing thousands of new beds, including in locally-run facilities,           according to theWashington \nPost, and the demand for more is only expected to increaseas the government doubles down on the waves of \nasylum seekers at the border.\u00e2(EURO)oeWe're seeing these contracts come online in some places that you really \n\n\ndon't think of as having large immigrant populations, like you have the Kenosha Jail in Wisconsin,\u00e2(EURO) says       \n     Sharita Gruberg, an immigration law and policy expert at the Center for American Progress.Why? It typically       \n     costs the federal government less to house immigrants in these types of facilities than in private detention \ncenters, and unlike private detention centers that have to be built from scratch, this infrastructure already exists. \nPlus, these contracts can be coupled with other types of collaborations to strengthen the local crackdown on \nundocumented immigrants. In            various counties in Texas, for example, 287(g) agreements through which jail \nofficers can be deputized as ICE agents are being sought in conjunction with jail contracts\u00e2(EURO)\"incentivizing \nlocal governments to create their own pipelines for deportation, critics say. According to TheNew York Times, the \nadministration has also been planning            to lower standards required for local jail facilities to detain immigrants, \nso they can be available more quickly. That would mean even less stringent medical and language requirements, \namong other changes.The conditions at these facilities are by no means up to scratch right now. Margo Schlanger, \nnow a law professor at the University of Michigan,            testified to the Homeland Security Advisory Council on \nimmigrant detention in 2016 that chaotic local jails are even less equipped to deal with immigration populations \nthan even the \u00e2(EURO)oeprison-like\u00e2(EURO) dedicated private detention centers. Many of the ones housing \nimmigrants are in remote areas\u00e2(EURO)\"far from legal counsel and medical amenities.Medical negligence, abuse, \nand maltreatment of immigrant detainees is already well-documented in county jails. An            OIG report from \n2017 found that detainees in some jails were strip-searched, inappropriately segregated, andkept in unhealthy \nconditions. Another from the same year found that detainees            were fed soiled food. A Southern Poverty Law \nCenter (SPLC)            report from 2016 found cases of brutal assaults, denial of due process, and gross medical \nnegligence.            Freedom For Immigrants recently released a study            documenting complaints about \nimmigrants being called \u00e2(EURO)oedogs\u00e2(EURO) and \u00e2(EURO)oebaboons,\u00e2(EURO) and told to \u00e2(EURO)oego \nfetch\u00e2(EURO) their food. In extreme cases, detention at these types of facilities            has been fatal: Most \nrecently, a Honduran man who was separated from his wife and 3-year-old at the border killed himself in the Starr \nCounty Sheriff\u00e2(EURO)(TM)s office.\u00e2(EURO)oeWhen a bona fide asylum seeker who's fleeing violence and recent \ntrauma arrives at the United States, expresses the fear of return and then is transferred to a county jail, it's very \ndisorienting,\u00e2(EURO) Altman told CityLab. \u00e2(EURO)oeIt's traumatizing.\u00e2(EURO)From the perspective of the local \ngovernment, renting out empty jail beds to federal authorities can still be appealing. Politically, it can feed            \ninto the tough-on-crime stance,if that is what the voters are looking for. But often the biggest sell is the economic \nvalue: These contracts are presented as revenue generators, even in places that are immigrant-\nfriendly.\u00c2 \u00c2 \u00e2(EURO)oeThe [immigrant] jail becomes a job-creation program that's not being funded by taxpayers \nin the county or even in your state, but rather by the federal government,\u00e2(EURO) says C\u00c3\u00a9sar Cuauht\u00c3\u00a9moc \nGarc\u00c3-a Hern\u00c3\u00a1ndez, an expert in immigration and criminal law at the University of Denver. \u00e2(EURO)oeIt becomes \nfree money.\u00e2(EURO)But hidden economic costs can arise. When abuses are discovered, the county may face \nlawsuits, or the federal authorities may be pressured to dissolve the contract altogether. The fear of that economic \nrisk and the moral case against these contracts seems to have convinced the officials in Williamson \nCounty.\u00e2(EURO)oeWith commissioners, we used a lot of messaging around liability, the fact that they \nweren\u00e2(EURO)(TM)t receiving proper information about incidents from ICE and CoreCivic, economic messaging \naround being perceived as a prison town, as well as speaking to family and Christian values,\u00e2(EURO) said            \nBethany Carson, from Grassroots Leadership, an anti-detention advocacy group. \u00e2(EURO)oeSome combination of \nthose did it.\u00e2(EURO)Other local governments, however, have proven much more resistant to anti-detention \nmessages. Willacy County, Texas, for example, had contracted with private company MT&C and the Federal \nBureau of Prisons to house            non-citizen inmates in the past. This prison had such a bad reputation that it \ncame to be known as \u00e2(EURO)oeRitmo,\u00e2(EURO) Raymondville city\u00e2(EURO)(TM)s very own \n\u00e2(EURO)oeGitmo.\u00e2(EURO) In 2015, riots broke out and the prison shut down. The county was riddled with debt as \na result and            sued MT&C. Now, the Texas Observer            reports that the county is re-entering into an \nagreement with ICE and the same private company to rent out bed space for immigrants in civil detention. The \nmayor of Raymondville, Gilbert Gonzalez, is hopeful that this new deal will bring the \u00e2(EURO)oebest-paid jobs in \n[the] area,\u00e2(EURO) he told The Observer\u00e2(EURO)(TM)s            Gus Bova. And while heopposes family separation, \nhe is not against immigrant detention overall.\u00e2(EURO)oePeople were getting put in facilities like this one under \nBush and Obama, too,\u00e2(EURO) he told The Observer. \u00e2(EURO)oeIt\u00e2(EURO)(TM)s not really my place to take \nsides on that.\u00e2(EURO)The Democratic sheriff of Albany, New York, which            considers itself a \n\u00e2(EURO)oesanctuary city,\u00e2(EURO) also recently            signed up to let ICE house immigrants in his half-empty \ncounty jail for $119 per person per day. His argument: the facility will provide free legal counsel, international \n\n\ncalls\u00e2(EURO)\"and therefore will be more humane than elsewhere in the country. But some immigration experts \nquestion whether even this argument can be morally justified.\u00e2(EURO)oeThe idea that immigrant detention can be \n\u00e2(EURO)~just business\u00e2(EURO)(TM) overlooks the fact that it is a fundamentally unjust business,\u00e2(EURO) \nStageman says, \u00e2(EURO)oeone that, by its very nature, profits off of human suffering.\u00e2(EURO)*Methodology \nnote: The maps are based on ICE\u00e2(EURO)(TM)s record-keeping, which may not be comprehensive. They do not \nshow privately owned facilities, and also do not include facilities listed in the dataset for which the ownership and \noperations information was missing\u00e2(EURO)\"so some local governments, like Lubbock County, Texas, that have \nsigned up for these contracts are not shown. Some of the contacts depicted may have ended or been terminated \nsince November 2017. We have requested information for 2018 and will update the maps when we receive it.
