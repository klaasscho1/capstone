{"title": "Ruling keeps ex-USF teacher in jail", "body": "\nTampa resident Mazen Al-Najjar's request to get out of jail while he fights  deportation has been denied on appeal.\n\nIn a decision released Wednesday, the Board of Immigration Appeals  dismissed Al-Najjar's argument that he is \nbeing illegally detained on secret  evidence.\nMAZEN\n\nAl-Najjar's appeal of his deportation is still pending.\n\nThe board's ruling means the Palestinian and longtime U.S. resident, jailed  for 16 months, will stay there.\n\nIt frees him, however, to seek relief in federal district court, since he  has exhausted all avenues of relief in the U.S. \nImmigration and Naturalization  Service system. Federal court judges may consider whether constitutional  rights \nhave been violated and other issues outside the jurisdiction of the INS  and its judges.\n\nA former University of South Florida teacher, Al-Najjar was arrested in May  1997 on an expired visa, then denied \nbail based on secret evidence alleging he  associates with terrorists.\n\nNo charges have been filed in the three-year-old investigation. Federal  investigators say a USF-affiliated think tank \nwas used by Al-Najjar and others  as a front for aiding terrorists.\n\nAl-Najjar is one of about two dozen immigrants nationwide, all of them Arab  or Muslim, jailed or accused on secret \nevidence. Use of secret evidence is  unconstitutional and bigoted, say rights groups lobbying for changes.\n"}
