{"title": "THE PIONEER PRESS BOOK CLUB", "body": "\nThe Pioneer Press Book Club this week is reading \"I Begin My Life All Over: The Hmong and the American \nImmigrant Experience.\" This is a collection of oral histories done by California scholar Lillian Faderman and her \nHmong collaborator, Ghia Xiong.\nThe narrators range in age and outlook, from elders telling about their escapes through the jungles of Laos to \nAmerican teens of Hmong descent trying to negotiate through both cultures. Faderman, the daughter of a Jewish \nmother who immigrated from Eastern Europe, finds commonalities between her experiences and those of the \nHmong trying now to adapt to American life.\n\nThe weekly selections in this book-club series parallel the topical reporting on immigrant communities, \"The New \nFace of Minnesota.\" Rounding out the book list for this seven-week series are an overview of human migrations \ndriving immigration, a public-policy argument against widely opening American doors and a collection of \nMinnesota's classic stories of immigrant experiences.\n\nRead along with the series, save its titles for inclusion later in your book group, or start your own list from the rich \nliterature of immigration in America. We include the Pioneer Press Book Club list here for your reference. If you'd \nlike copies of the list for a community organization or discussion group, contact book club facilitator Glenda Holste \nat (651) 228-5478 or by e-mail at gholste@pioneerpress.com.  \n\nNotes\n\nSee microfilm for selections on immigration\n"}
