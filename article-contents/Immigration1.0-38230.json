{"title": "Haitian policy called 'immoral' // Telling people to seek visas 'surrealistic'", "body": "\nOn the U.S. Consulate building, behind a high wall and iron gates, hangs a hand-printed notice: ''Closed for all \nservices except for American citizens. No immigrant visa services are available.''\n\nThe sign - written in English in a country where French creole is the language and many people don't read - reflects \nthe confusion among Haitians, and in Washington, over the fate of the thousands of people who want to leave their \nimpoverished nation.\n\nThis is the consulate Haitians are being told in Voice of America broadcasts to visit if they want to come to the \nUnited States legally as political refugees.\n\n''What do you think would happen if I went to the U.S. Embassy?'' asks Vilson Destin, 20, of Les Cayes, after being \nreturned to Haiti Tuesday morning by the U.S. Coast Guard. He had been on a 15-foot boat with 19 others that was \nintercepted Sunday night - hours after President Bush ordered the Coast Guard to turn back all refugee-laden \nboats.\n\nIn recent weeks, more than 12,500 refugees have been plucked from rickety boats as they tried to flee to the USA. \nMost say they fear persecution from the military regime that ousted elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in \nSeptember.\n\nBush's order ignited a howl of protests from refugee advocates. They are threatening to sue to block the order, \nsaying it violates U.N. conventions on refugees.\n\nSpecifically, they say, the policy prevents Haitians from making a case for asylum on grounds of being persecuted, \nas required by the U.N. treaties signed by the United States.\n\n''It's a surrealistic proposition,'' says Jean Claude Bajeaux, leader of Haiti's Ecumenical Center for Human Rights, \nreferring to the idea that Haitians go to the U.S. Embassy.\n\nThe U.S. diplomatic compound ''is built like a high-security fortress. No Haitian, intimidated and traumatized, would \ndare approach it,'' says Bajeaux, a head of the Socialist Congress of Democratic Movements.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. government monitors are scouring Haiti's towns and countryside to determine whether Haitians \nreturned aboard Coast Guard cutters are being mistreated - as Haitians in the USA and their advocates charge.\n\nState Department spokesman Richard Boucher says embassy officers have contacted more than 2,000 repatriated \nHaitians and ''in no case found evidence of mistreatment connected to their repatriation.''\n\n\nBut violence is prevalent in Haiti. A gunman Tuesday killed a prominent businessman whose brother was the \nleading campaign fund-raiser for the ousted Aristide.\n\nThe slaying was at least the 16th in the capital area in the last week; all appear to be tied to politics.\n\nMeanwhile, 38 Haitians stopped at sea since Bush issued his order were returned Tuesday by the Coast Guard, \nwhich burned their boat.\n\nAnd today, 500 more are to be returned from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where the Coast Guard had taken refugees \npicked up before the order.\n\n''This is really a shameful day for our country,'' says Miami lawyer Ira Kurzban, who works with the Haitian \ncommunity. He's leading an effort to sue the Bush administration by challenging the forced-return order.\n\nBut Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, defended the policy.\n\nDetermining which Haitians are economic refugees and which fear political persecution, Lugar says, ''can best be \ndone in Haiti, where the conditions can best be seen.''\n\nSays White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater: ''We simply have to be concerned about the immigration rules for \nall people who want into this country from all countries.''\n\nNevertheless, Bush's decision - in fact his entire policy on dealing with the Haitians since Aristide was overthrown - \nis coming under growing criticism:\n\n- Lionel Rosenblatt, executive director of Refugees International, says the policy ''violates one of the fundamental \ninternational human rights provisions: the right to political asylum or refuge.''\n\n- Bill Frelick, senior policy analyst for the private Washington-based U.S. Committee for Refugees: ''This creates a \nreally frightening precedent \u2026 (countries) can return refugees to torture, to death, to execution, to sharks at sea. In \na sense it could be the end of asylum.''\n\nBut some of the harshest criticism has come from Congress.\n\n''It's just an illegal, immoral thing that we're doing,'' says Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. ''There's no precedent in \nhistory where a country can just stop people from leaving and arbitrarily returning them.''\n\nHaitians in the USA, especially in the Miami area, believe there is something Bush should do - a naval blockade of \nthe Caribbean nation, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic.\n\nThey say a blockade would force the junta to return democracy.\n\nThe South Florida Haitian community hopes Aristide will spur support for their homeland and its refugees. He's now \nvisiting the USA from exile in Venezuela. He meets today with Miami business leaders.\n\nOne of the issues that further complicates the Haitian problem is that it has triggered charges of racism in U.S. \nimmigration policy.\n\nRangel, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, says the policy wouldn't be in place if the refugees weren't \nblack or poor. ''It's a racial thing, it's an economic thing and it's a political thing because it's an election year. People \ndon't want poor black folks coming here.\n\n''Do you really believe if these people were coming here from Europe that they would be treated this way?'' he \nasks.\n\n\n\nThat point was also made by Stephen Legomsky, a law professor at St. Louis' Washington University. He tutored \nGene McNary on immigration issues before NcNary became commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization \nService.\n\nLegomsky says a more subtle type of racism is involved, although he doesn't think the administration's policies are \nracially motivated.\n\n''But at the same time,'' he says, ''I don't think the American public would stand for this policy if these were \nboatloads of refugees from Ireland or Italy.''\n\nBut Fitzwater seems to dismiss any hint of racism when he says the policy ''is not a question of not wanting any \none nationality.''\n\nThe forced-return policy, Fitzwater adds, ''is consistent with the Constitution'' and is driven by humanitarian \nreasons because ''people are dying every day in these old ships that they're trying to take out.''\n\n Contributing: Juan J.
