{"title": "New Zealand Immigration and Protection Tribunal Decision: VS (Partnership) [2018] NZIPT 204708 (14 May 2018)", "body": "\nWellington: New Zealand Immigration and Protection Tribunal has issued the following decision:   IMMIGRATION \nAND PROTECTION TRIBUNAL NEW ZEALAND  [2018] NZIPT 204708  AT AUCKLAND  Appellant: VS \n(Partnership) Before: Judge P Spiller Counsel for the Appellant: R Sathiyanathan  Date of Decision: 14 May 2018  \nRESIDENCE DECISION  [1] The appellant is a 35-year-old citizen of the Philippines. His application for residence \nunder the Family (Partnership) category of residence instructions was declined by Immigration New Zealand.  THE \nISSUE  [2] Immigration New Zealand declined the appellant\u2019s residence application because he did not meet the \nrequirements of good character and was not granted a character waiver.  [3] The principal issues for the Tribunal \nare whether Immigration New Zealand\u2019s decision was correct; and whether the appellant has special \ncircumstances warranting consideration by the Minister of Immigration as an exception to residence instructions.  \n[4] For the reasons which follow, the Tribunal finds that Immigration New Zealand\u2019s decision was correct. \n\nHowever, it also finds that the appellant has special circumstances.  BACKGROUND  [5] In October 2007, the \nappellant applied for a visitor visa to come to New Zealand. In the application, it was claimed that he had a partner \nwho was living in the United States of America, and that he was residing in the Philippines caring for their child. The \napplication was declined. The appellant later denied this information and that he himself had supplied it.  [6] \nBetween September 2008 and August 2011, the appellant lived in the  United Arab Emirates (UAE), before \nreturning to the Philippines.  [7] In November 2011, the appellant and his partner, a New Zealand citizen, were \nmarried in Sri Lanka. They had a son born in February 2012, who automatically acquired New Zealand citizenship.  \n[8] In June 2014, the appellant, his wife and their son came to New Zealand. In June 2015, the daughter of the \nappellant and his wife was born in New Zealand. She is a New Zealand citizen.  [9] On 1 April 2016, the appellant \nlodged an application for a resident visa under the Family (Partnership) category. In the application form, when \nasked to list the countries where he had lived for 12 months or more in the last 10 years, he did not declare that he \nhad lived in the UAE.  Immigration New Zealand Initial Concerns  [10] On 4 August 2016, Immigration New \nZealand advised the appellant in writing that it had concerns about his application.  [11] Immigration New Zealand \nnoted that, in his visa application in 2007, it was claimed that he had a partner who was living in the United States \nof America, and that he was residing in the Philippines caring for their child, but that he later denied this information \nand that he himself had supplied it. It therefore appeared that he had provided information that was false or \nmisleading and that he was normally ineligible for a resident visa unless the character requirement was waived.  \nAppellant\u2019s Response  [12] On 16 August 2016, the appellant\u2019s counsel responded to Immigration New  Zealand\u2019s \nconcerns.  [13] Counsel stated that the appellant had been in a relationship with a United States\u2019 citizen but they \nwere never married and did not have a child together. The appellant did not provide the wrong information to his \nagent, who filled in the appropriate documents. Counsel accepted that it was ultimately the appellant\u2019s responsibility \nto ensure that correct details were provided in an application, that he had prima facie provided false and misleading \n\n\ninformation, and that he needed to obtain a character waiver. Counsel provided submissions and documents in \nsupport of a character waiver.  Immigration New Zealand\u2019s Further Concerns  [14] On 30 August 2016, \nImmigration New Zealand advised that it had noticed in the information supplied by the appellant that he and his \nwife had met in Dubai before he left for the Philippines. Immigration New Zealand asked the appellant to confirm \nhow long he had resided in the UAE.  [15] On 7 September 2016, the appellant provided information about his \nperiod in the UAE. On 8 September 2016, his counsel stated that he had not provided this in his application form as \nhe had been confused about the question in the form and thought it referred to countries where they were \npermanent residents. Counsel also noted that he would require a police clearance certificate from the UAE and had \nadvised the appellant to obtain this.  [16] On 15 December 2016 and 24 February 2017, Immigration New Zealand \nqueried whether the appellant had received the police clearance certificate. On  2 March 2017, the appellant stated \nthat he was unable to provide the certificate.  [17] On 18 April 2017, Immigration New Zealand advised the \nappellant in writing that it had further concerns about his application. It noted that the appellant had acknowledged \nthat he had lived in the UAE between 2008 and 2011, and so Immigration New Zealand had requested a police \nclearance certificate from the UAE. The appellant stated that he was unable to provide such a certificate, but no \ninformation or evidence was provided in support of this claim. It therefore appeared that he was unable to show that \nhe met the requirements of good character.  Appellant\u2019s Further Response  [18] On 26 April 2017, the appellant\u2019s \ncounsel responded to Immigration New  Zealand\u2019s concerns. Counsel submitted that, in February 2016, the \nappellant  lodged an application for a police clearance certificate with the UAE embassy. On  29 January 2017, he \nwas advised that the police had refused to issue him with a certificate. He had never been charged with or \nconvicted of an offence in the UAE. The only option was for him to travel to the UAE in person, but he would need \nto seek leave from his employer, and purchase flight tickets and accommodation. He therefore sought a waiver from \nthe requirement to provide a police clearance certificate. Counsel provided, in support, a statutory declaration from \nthe appellant and evidence of his police clearance certificate application.  [19] On 5 October 2017, Immigration \nNew Zealand received an email from its Dubai office that \u201cthe UAE authorities have come back and advised \u2018has no \nobjection in UAE and he is clear with no criminality records\u2019, ie there is no record for him being wanted in the United \nArab Emirates\u201d.  Immigration New Zealand\u2019s Character Waiver Assessment  [20] On 4 December 2017, \nImmigration New Zealand conducted a character waiver assessment. It was not satisfied that the benefits of \ngranting the appellant a character waiver outweighed the negative aspects. It therefore decided to decline the \ncharacter waiver.  Immigration New Zealand\u2019s Decision  [21] By letter dated 5 December 2017, Immigration New \nZealand declined the  appellant\u2019s application.  [22] Immigration New Zealand was not satisfied that the appellant \nmet the requirements of good character, and the character requirements were not waived. A copy of the character \nwaiver assessment was attached.  STATUTORY GROUNDS  [23] The appellant\u2019s right of appeal arises from \nsection 187(1) of the Immigration  Act 2009 (the Act). Section 187(4) of the Act provides:  (4) The grounds for an \nappeal under this section are that\u2014  (a) the relevant decision was not correct in terms of the residence instructions \napplicable at the time the relevant application for the visa was made; or  (b) the special circumstances of the \nappellant are such that consideration of an exception to those residence instructions should be recommended.  [24] \nThe residence instructions referred to in section 187(4) are the Government residence instructions contained in \nImmigration New Zealand\u2019s Operational Manual (see www.immigration.govt.nz).  THE APPELLANT\u2019S CASE  [25] \nOn 18 December 2017, the appellant lodged this appeal on both grounds in section 187(4).  [26] In support of the \nappellant\u2019s appeal, his counsel provides submissions (9 January 2018). She submits that Immigration New \nZealand did not carry out a character waiver assessment properly, in that: no clear decision was set down; it failed \nto provide any proper basis for disbelieving the appellant\u2019s explanation for the false information presented in the \nvisitor visa application; it failed to balance the factors applicable, including the strong positive factors in the case; \nand it improperly penalised him for not providing a police clearance certificate when Immigration New Zealand \nobtained the equivalent information.  [27] Counsel also submits that the appellant has special circumstances.  \nASSESSMENT  [28] The Tribunal has considered the submissions provided on appeal and the file in relation to the \nappellant\u2019s residence application which has been provided by Immigration New Zealand.  [29] An assessment as \nto whether the Immigration New Zealand decision to decline the appellant\u2019s application was correct in terms of the \napplicable residence instructions is set out below. This is followed by an assessment of whether the appellant has \nspecial circumstances which warrant consideration of an exception by the Minister of Immigration.  Whether the \nDecision is Correct  [30] The application was made on 1 April 2016 and the relevant criteria are those in residence \ninstructions as at that time. Immigration New Zealand declined  the application because the appellant did not meet \n\nhttp://www.immigration.govt.nz/\n\n\nthe requirements of good character and was not granted a character waiver. The relevant instructions in this case \nare:  A5.25 Applicants normally ineligible for a residence class visa unless granted a character waiver  Applicants \nwho will not normally be granted a residence class visa, unless granted a character waiver (see A5.25.1(b) below), \ninclude any person who: ...  i. in the course of applying for a New Zealand visa (or a permit under the Immigration \nAct 1987), has made any statement or provided any information, evidence or submission that was false, misleading \nor forged, or withheld material information ...  Note:  - When considering whether or not an applicant has committed \nan act that comes under A5.25 (i), (j) or (k) or (l) above, an immigration officer should establish whether, on the \nbalance of probabilities, it is more likely than not that the applicant committed such an act. ...  A5.25.1 Action  a. An \nimmigration officer must not automatically decline residence class visa applications on character grounds.  b. An \nimmigration officer must consider the surrounding circumstances of the application to decide whether or not they \nare compelling enough to justify waiving the good character requirement. The circumstances include but are not \nlimited to the following factors as appropriate: ...  iii. if applicable, the significance of the false, misleading or forged \ninformation provided, or information withheld, and whether the applicant is able to supply a reasonable and credible \nexplanation or other evidence indicating that in supplying or withholding such information they did not intend to \ndeceive INZ;  iv. how long ago the relevant event occurred;  v. whether the applicant has any immediate family \nlawfully and permanently in New Zealand;  vi. whether the applicant has some strong emotional or physical tie to  \nNew Zealand;  vii. whether the applicant's potential contribution to New Zealand will be significant. ...  Effective \n30/03/2015  [31] The appellant applied for a resident visa under the Family (Partnership) category, based on his \nrelationship with a New Zealand citizen. An application under this category will be declined if the applicant does not \nmeet the character requirements of instructions (F2.5.d.v, effective 19 August 2013).  [32] An applicant who will not \nnormally be granted a residence class visa, unless granted a character waiver, includes any person who has, in the \ncourse of applying for a New Zealand visa, made any statement or provided any information or evidence that was \nfalse or misleading, or withheld material information (A5.25.i). The appellant has accepted that false and misleading \ninformation was provided when he applied for a visitor visa in October 2007; and that he failed to declare in his \nresidence application form that he had lived in the UAE for 12 months or more in the last 10 years. He thus \nprovided false information and withheld material information. He therefore became ineligible for a residence class \nvisa unless granted a character waiver.  [33] In conducting the character waiver assessment, Immigration New \nZealand was required to consider the surrounding circumstances of the appellant\u2019s application to decide whether or \nnot they were compelling enough to justify waiving the good character requirement of instructions (A5.25.1.b). \nImmigration New Zealand took into account most of the circumstances which the instructions required to be taken \ninto account. These included:  (a) The significance of the false, misleading or forged information provided, or \ninformation withheld, and whether the applicant was able to supply a reasonable and credible explanation or other \nevidence indicating that in supplying or withholding such information they did not intend to deceive Immigration \nNew Zealand:  (i) In relation to the visitor visa application, Immigration New Zealand noted that the appellant had \nclaimed by email to have had a partner who was living in the USA and that he was residing in the Philippines to \ncare for their mutual child. He later accepted that he had been in a partnership with an American citizen, but denied \nthat they had had a child together. In explaining the inconsistency, he stated that he did not personally sign or see \nany immigration application forms, and that he did not send the email which disclosed his partnership to his \nprevious partner and their \u201cchild\u201d. He claimed that he had no intention to mislead Immigration New Zealand as he \nwas not aware up until 2014 that the immigration advisor had even made an application to Immigration New \nZealand on his behalf. He added that he had openly declared this information on his subsequent visa  application. \nImmigration New Zealand, in assessing this explanation, said that the appellant had not provided any evidence of \npaying the said immigration advisor at that time, and all correspondence regarding the application was sent to the \nappellant\u2019s email address. The applicant\u2019s explanations that he was not aware of the false information submitted to \nImmigration New Zealand in October 2007 appeared neither credible nor reasonable, given that Immigration New \nZealand records at that time showed that he was working for the alleged immigration advisor, and there was \nwritten email confirmation from his account. As to the significance of the false information, this carried significant \nweight around incentives to return after visiting New Zealand, and could carry significant weight towards satisfying \nImmigration New Zealand that the relationship with his wife was genuine and stable.  (ii) In relation to the resident \nvisa application, Immigration New Zealand noted that the appellant did not declare in section G1 that he had lived \nin the UAE in the first instance, which would require him to provide a police certificate from there. The appellant \nadmitted his time in the UAE only after the immigration officer further assessed the details of his partnership. \n\n\n\nImmigration New Zealand was concerned as to the appellant\u2019s intention to withhold the information in Section G1 \nin his residence application that he lived in the UAE for over 12 months in the last 10 years. He was subsequently \nrequired by the immigration officer to submit a police certificate from the UAE after the officer established this. The \nappellant then requested Immigration New Zealand to waive the police certificate requirement.  (b) How long ago \nthe relevant event occurred: Immigration New Zealand noted that the visa application occurred over nine years \nbefore, but that the failure to declare occurred in his present application, and was admitted after further inquiries by \nImmigration New Zealand.  (c) Whether the applicant has any immediate family lawfully and permanently in New \nZealand, and whether the applicant has some strong emotional or physical tie to New Zealand: Immigration New  \nZealand noted that the appellant was married to his New Zealand-citizen wife, had two New Zealand-citizen \nchildren from the marriage, the relationship was genuine and stable, and the decline of this character waiver might \ncause significant negative impacts on the well-being of the two children.  [34] Overall, Immigration New Zealand \nwas not satisfied that the benefits of granting the character waiver outweighed the negative aspects. It found that it \nwas against the public interest for Immigration New Zealand to grant character waivers to applicants who \nintentionally provided material false and misleading information during the course of applying for a New Zealand \nvisa, as this behaviour potentially undermined the integrity of immigration instructions.  [35] The Tribunal has \nconsidered Immigration New Zealand\u2019s character waiver assessment of the appellant. The Tribunal notes that \nImmigration New Zealand did not consider the significance of the information withheld as to his time in the UAE, \nand whether the appellant was able to supply a reasonable and credible explanation or other evidence indicating \nthat in withholding this information he did not intend to deceive Immigration New Zealand.  [36] The Tribunal also \nnotes that Immigration New Zealand did not consider whether the appellant\u2019s potential contribution to New \nZealand would be significant (in terms of A5.25.1.b.vii). The submissions made by his counsel on this point were \nthat he was committed to providing for his family, and he worked hard and contributed to the New Zealand \nworkforce, and so his potential contribution to the New Zealand workforce would therefore likely to be significant. In \nsupport, there was evidence that, from August 2015, the appellant had worked as a despatch assistant and later \nteam leader for aluminium roller blinds firms. From September  2014 to August 2015, he had worked as a \ntemporary contractor for an employment agency. From this evidence, the Tribunal concludes that the appellant\u2019s \ncontribution to New Zealand would be modest rather than significant, and so would not materially have affected the \noutcome of the character waiver assessment.  [37] In response to the submissions made by the appellant\u2019s \ncounsel, the  Tribunal bases its findings on the copy of the character waiver assessment dated  4 December 2017, \nin the Immigration New Zealand file. The Tribunal finds that a reasonably clear decision was set down by \nImmigration New Zealand; it provided a reasoned basis for disbelieving the appellant\u2019s explanation for the false \ninformation presented in the visitor visa application; it balanced most of the factors applicable, including strong \npositive factors in the case; and there is no evidence  that it improperly penalised the appellant for not providing a \npolice clearance certificate when Immigration New Zealand obtained the equivalent information.  [38] The Tribunal \nconcludes that Immigration New Zealand followed the proper procedure and came to a conclusion which it was \nentitled to reach. It considered most of the circumstances of the appellant\u2019s false and withheld information, weighed \nand balanced relevant factors, and provided an explanation, with supporting reasons, as to why the surrounding \ncircumstances of the appellant\u2019s application were not compelling enough to justify waiving the good character \nrequirement of instructions.  Conclusion as to correctness  [39] Immigration New Zealand\u2019s decision to decline the \nappellant\u2019s application was correct. It correctly found that the appellant did not meet the character requirements for \na residence class visa unless granted a character waiver, and that a character waiver should not be granted.  \nWhether there are Special Circumstances  [40] The Tribunal has power pursuant to section 188(1)(f) of the Act to \nfind, where it agrees with the decision of Immigration New Zealand, that there are special circumstances of an \nappellant that warrant consideration by the Minister of Immigration of an exception to the residence instructions.  \n[41] Special circumstances are \u201ccircumstances that are uncommon, not commonplace, out of the ordinary, \nabnormal\u201d; Rajan v Minister of Immigration [2004] NZAR 615 (CA) at [24] per Glazebrook J. Whether an appellant \nhas special circumstances will depend on the particular facts of each case. The Tribunal balances all relevant \nfactors in each case to determine whether the appellant's circumstances, when considered cumulatively, are \nspecial. While very limited evidence was provided with this appeal in support of the special circumstances of the \nappellant, the Tribunal has been provided with further evidence in the deportation non-resident appeal which was \nlodged on 4 April 2018.  Personal and family circumstances  [42] The appellant is a 35-year-old citizen of the \nPhilippines. According to information provided by the appellant, his parents live in the Philippines, although  it \n\n\n\nappears that he has long had no contact with his father. Between 2005 and  2008, he worked as a marketing \nmanager in a studio business owned by his aunt.  [43] Between September 2008 and August 2011, the appellant \nlived in the UAE, and worked as a merchandiser for a clothing business. In May 2011, while there, the appellant \nmet his future wife, who was working for a clothing business. She is a Sri Lankan-born New Zealand citizen now \naged 36 years, who (as a child) lost contact with her father in Sri Lanka, and whose mother is a New Zealand \ncitizen and sister and brother-in-law are permanent residents. The wife came to New Zealand in August 1998 and \nwas granted residence status, and later citizenship.  [44] From August 2011, the appellant and his partner lived \ntogether in the Philippines. In November 2011, the couple moved to Sri Lanka and were married there. They had a \nson, a New Zealand citizen, born in Sri Lanka in February  2012. In March 2013, the couple and their son moved \nback to the Philippines because they were unable to find full-time employment.  [45] In June 2014, the appellant, his \nwife and their son came to New Zealand, having been unable to find employment in the Philippines. In June 2015, \nthe daughter of the appellant and his wife was born in New Zealand. She is a New Zealand citizen.  [46] In New \nZealand, the appellant held a work visa on the basis of his partnership with his wife, and this was subsequently \nrenewed. He worked as a temporary contractor for an employment agency, and then as a despatch assistant and \nlater team leader for aluminium roller blinds firms. His employers have noted that he has shown initiative and a \ngood attitude, he is honest and hard-working, and his industry, punctuality and integrity have been excellent. He \nhas been unemployed since March 2018 on account of his unlawful status, but his previous employer has stated \nthat the appellant would be taken back without hesitation.  [47] The appellant, his wife and two children are active \nmembers of their church community, and their parish priest notes that the appellant and his wife are very \ntrustworthy, hard-working people, and loving parents to their children.  Decline of the appellant\u2019s resident visa \napplication  [48] In assessing the appellant\u2019s application for a resident visa under the Family (Partnership) category, \nImmigration New Zealand was satisfied that he and his wife were living in a genuine and stable relationship. \nImmigration New Zealand  noted that the appellant and his wife had shown that they had been living together for \nthe required duration (set by instructions), there had been no periods of separation, they had provided evidence of a \ncommitted and stable relationship which was likely to endure, and they were married and had a New Zealand-born \nchild of the relationship, and they were of similar ages and culture. The Tribunal is satisfied, on the basis of the \nevidence provided, that the appellant and his wife are living in a genuine and stable relationship.  [49] However, the \nappellant\u2019s application was declined because Immigration New Zealand found that he did not meet the \nrequirements of good character, and that he should not be granted a character waiver. The appellant\u2019s work visa \napplication was later declined on the same basis and he became unlawfully in New Zealand after this.  [50] As \nnoted above, the Tribunal has found that Immigration New Zealand\u2019s decision to decline the appellant\u2019s resident \nvisa was correct in the sense that Immigration New Zealand followed the correct procedure overall and reached a \ndecision that it was entitled to reach. However, the Tribunal notes that the information in support of his visitor visa \napplication was supplied 11 years ago, and the long-term significance of this information is very limited. The \nTribunal also notes that the appellant\u2019s failure to declare his time in the UAE is also of very limited significance, \nparticularly as Immigration New Zealand has received confirmation that there is no recorded criminal offending on \nthe appellant\u2019s part in the UAE.  [51] Nevertheless, although the appellant and his wife are in a genuine and stable \nrelationship, any future application for residence on the basis of his partnership will require character waiver \nconsiderations.  Health and character  [52] Immigration New Zealand was satisfied that the appellant met the \nhealth requirements of instructions. His New Zealand police certificate (10 May 2018), his Filipino and Sri Lankan \npolice certificates, and the certification of his police record in the UAE, were clear. However, Immigration New \nZealand was not satisfied that he met the requirements of good character, and the character requirements were not \nwaived (for the reasons noted above).  The best interests of the appellant\u2019s children  [53] The appellant\u2019s son is \naged six years and his daughter is aged nearly three years. The Tribunal acknowledges, in relation to them, that the \n1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child provides at Article 3.1 that, in all actions concerning children, the best \ninterests of the child shall be a primary consideration \u2013 see also Puli\u2019uvea v Removal Review Authority (1996) 14 \nFRNZ 322 (CA).  [54] The appellant\u2019s children are both New Zealand citizens, their mother being a New Zealand \ncitizen. The son was born in Sri Lanka and lived the first  13 months of his life there, the next 15 months in the \nPhilippines, and the ensuing nearly four years in New Zealand. He has attended pre-school and begun school in \nNew Zealand. He has been thriving in his school, as is evidenced by the awards, reports and certificates that he \nhas achieved. The daughter has lived all of her life in New Zealand, and is due to begin pre-school in June 2018. \nThe children\u2019s maternal grandmother, uncle and aunt live permanently in New Zealand.  [55] If the appellant is \n\n\n\nrequired to leave New Zealand, his children will face one of two situations, neither of which is conducive to their \nbest interests. One option is for the appellant to return to the Philippines without his wife and children. The best \ninterests of the appellant\u2019s children, at their young age, is to have the ongoing love and support of both their \nparents, which they have at present. This will obviously no longer be the case if the appellant is physically absent \nfrom them.  [56] The other option is for the children to accompany the appellant and his wife to Sri Lanka or to the \nPhilippines. The reality is that, as New Zealand-citizen children, they will experience a significant decline in their \nliving and educational opportunities, at least in the immediate future. The appellant and his wife have attempted to \nlive as a couple in both countries without employment opportunities, undermined by the lack of citizenship rights of \nthe appellant and his wife in one or other of the two countries. The house where the appellant and his wife and son \nlived in Sri Lanka has now been demolished, and the house occupied by the appellant\u2019s mother and grandmother in \nthe Philippines has no room for anyone else.  [57] The Tribunal is satisfied that the best interests of the appellant\u2019s \ntwo New Zealand-citizen children are that the appellant should be granted residence status so that he can continue \nto live with his New Zealand-citizen wife and children here on a permanent basis. The children have the right to \nreside here permanently,  and to access all of the benefits, including funded healthcare, education and welfare \nsupport, that comes from being New Zealand citizens.  Discussion of special circumstances  [58] The Tribunal \nacknowledges that the appellant\u2019s resident visa application was correctly declined on character grounds, although \non issues which appear to have limited long-term significance.  [59] However, the Tribunal notes that the appellant \nhas lived in New Zealand for nearly four years. During his time in New Zealand, he has lived with his New Zealand-\ncitizen wife and two New Zealand-citizen children, and they have settled well into their local church and wider \ncommunity. He was employed (until two months ago) and worked to the satisfaction of his employers, and has the \npromise of future employment. While his mother and extended family live in the Philippines, his wife\u2019s family live in \nSri Lanka and in New Zealand. His application for a resident visa was based on his partnership with his wife of six-\nand-a-half years, and Immigration New Zealand found that they have a genuine and stable relationship which is \nlikely to endure. The Tribunal is satisfied that it is in the wife\u2019s interests, and the best interests of the appellant\u2019s two \nyoung New Zealand-citizen children, that he be granted a resident visa.  [60] Having considered the totality of the \nappellant\u2019s circumstances, particularly the interests of his New Zealand-citizen wife and the best interests of his \nNew Zealand-citizen children, the Tribunal considers it appropriate for the Minister of Immigration to consider \nwhether the appellant\u2019s circumstances warrant consideration of an exception to residence instructions.  \nDETERMINATION  [61] This appeal is determined pursuant to section 188(1)(f) of the Immigration Act 2009. The \nTribunal confirms the decision of Immigration New Zealand as correct in terms of the applicable residence \ninstructions but considers there are special circumstances of this appellant that warrant consideration by the \nMinister of Immigration as an exception to those instructions.  [62] Pursuant to section 190(5) of the Immigration \nAct 2009, the Minister of Immigration is requested to make one of the two decisions set out below. Pursuant to \nsection 190(6) of the Immigration Act 2009, the Minister of Immigration  is not obliged to give reasons in relation \nto any decision made as a result of a consideration of the Tribunal\u2019s recommendation.  Order as to Depersonalised \nResearch Copy  [63] Pursuant to clause 19 of Schedule 2 of the Immigration Act 2009, the Tribunal orders that, \nuntil further order, the research copy of this decision is to be depersonalised by removal of the appellant\u2019s name, \nand any particulars likely to lead to the identification of the appellant, his wife and their children.  \u201cJudge P Spiller\u201d \nJudge P Spiller Chair  Certified to be the Research  Copy released for publication.
