{"title": "INS says Hussein stepson is arrested", "body": "\nFederal agents have arrested a man they say is a stepson of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's, saying he flew \ninto town yesterday to take flight training without a student visa.\n\nAgents picked up Mohammed Nour Al-Bin Saffi, an employee of Air New Zealand, at a motel near Miami \nInternational Airport.\n\n\"We had information that Mr. Saffi was coming here for flight training,\" said Jim Goldman, an assistant director for \ninvestigations at the Immigration and Naturalization Service. \"He was arrested without incident on an immigration \nviolation charge.\"\n\nSaffi, 36, a New Zealand citizen, is charged with entering the United States without a student visa, Goldman said. \nAlthough the U.S. does not require citizens of New Zealand to obtain visas to enter the country, they must obtain \nvisas to study or work.\n\nGoldman said there was no evidence Saffi was connected to any terrorism group. Federal agents and published \nreports say he is Hussein's stepson, but Saffi denied any family tie to the Iraqi leader yesterday.\n\nLast night, Saffi was taken to a detention facility, where he will remain pending a deportation hearing.\n\nFBI Special Agent Judy Orihuela said Saffi flew from New Zealand to Los Angeles yesterday. He arrived in Miami \nin the afternoon and was arrested about 7 p.m.\n\nSaffi was in Miami to take a four-day mandatory refresher course at Aero Service flight school, Goldman said.\n\nNew Zealand authorities identified a woman they believe is Saffi's mother, Samira Shahbandar, who was reported \nto have been married to Hussein after a relationship that began in the 1980s.\n\nSaffi dismissed reports of his mother's marriage to Hussein as a rumor.\n"}
