Most of \nthe immigrants are from Mexico.\n\nImmigration already has become a hot political issue in several states, particularly California and Florida, where \ngovernment officials say their welfare and other social benefit costs for immigrants are harming their treasuries.\n\nThe report said U.S. immigration officials found that in 1992, there were about 3.4 million illegal immigrants and \nthat an estimated 300,000 illegal foreigners were settling here each year.\n\nThe largest concentration of immigrants, 33 percent of the foreign-born population of the United States, is in \nCalifornia. An additional 40 percent of immigrants live in five states - New York, Florida, Texas, New Jersey and \nIllinois.\n\nBy the year 2050, the white non-Hispanic population of the United States was expected to drop from 74 percent to \n52 percent, if present immigration rates continued. The number of Hispanics would increase from 10 percent to 20 \npercent of the population; Asians would grow from 3 percent to 10 percent, and blacks would rise from 12 percent \nto 14 percent.\n"}
