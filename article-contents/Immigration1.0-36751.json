{"title": "40,000 BARRED FROM THE U.S.", "body": "\nPresident Kurt Waldheim of Austria is one of 40,000 people on the Immigration and Naturalization Service's ''watch \nlist'' of people who are excluded from the United States.\n\nMost of those on the list, also known as the Lookout Book, are criminals, known terrorists, Communists or people \nwho have been deported from the United States.\n\nPeople may be placed on the list for any one of 33 reasons, ranging from having been a Nazi to having a \ncontagious disease such as tuberculosis. A spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Duke \nAustin, said today that ''probably only a handful'' have been placed on the list for persecuting people in World War \nII.\n\nIf a person on the list tries to enter the United States, he or she is generally turned away at the border. A person \nwho challenges being turned away is entitled to an administrative hearing.\n\nSometimes the person is allowed to post bond and enter the country. In addition, the Attorney General can waive \nthe ban and allow the person to enter the country.\n\nA head of state, such as Mr. Waldheim, who plans to go to the United Nations may receive a temporary visa.\n"}
