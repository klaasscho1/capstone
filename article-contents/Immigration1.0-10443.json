{"title": "A NATION CHALLENGED: NOTEBOOKS; More Eyes Toward Canada", "body": "\nThe number of federal agents patrolling the northern border of the United States would triple to 7,689 from 2,563 \nunder Attorney General John Ashcroft's antiterrorism legislation, which was drafted after the Sept. 11 attacks and is \nexpected to pass in Congress this week.\n\n     Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York said the provision would provide $609 million for new Customs, \nBorder Patrol and Immigration and Naturalization Service personnel to patrol along the world's longest \nnonmilitarized boundary, between the United States and Canada. \n\n It would also provide $100 million for things like biometric surveillance systems, and $2 million for an improved \nfingerprinting system.\n\nSenator Schumer said the increase struck a balance between tightened security and the free flow of an estimated \n$1.4 billion in daily cross-border business between the two nations.\n\n\"The northern border has been like a sieve and if you are a bad, smart person, and want to come into the United \nStates, you know that you should go north and not south,\" Senator Schumer said.\n\nNew York shares about 400 miles of border with Canada. Three upstate cities, Buffalo, Champlain and Alexandria \nBay, are respectively the second, fourth and 10th busiest land border crossings in the country, an aide to Senator \nSchumer said.\n\nThe Canadian border is not unknown to terrorists. Participants in the World Trade Center bombing eight years ago \nappeared to have used Canadian immigration papers to gain access to the United States. Ahmed Ressam, who \nwas arrested by United States customs officials in December 1999 with a carload of explosives and convicted, had \ntried to enter Washington State by a ferry from Victoria, British Columbia.\n\n   AL BAKER\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
