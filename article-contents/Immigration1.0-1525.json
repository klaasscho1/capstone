{"title": "U.S. SCHOOLS FACE RECORD ENROLLMENT IN THE FALL", "body": "\nSecond-generation baby boomers and immigrants will pack America's schools in record numbers this fall, \nsurpassing the surge of postwar babies that filled U.S. classrooms in the 1970s.\n\nThe estimated 51.7 million young people studying in public and private elementary and secondary schools this fall \nwill bring further stress to districts coping with tight budgets.\nThey will have to build schools, use more portable classrooms, buy more books and schedule extra lunch periods.\n\nThis anticipated autumn enrollment will eclipse the 51.3 million baby boomers who were in class in 1971. And U.S. \nschool enrollment is expected to keep climbing - to 55.9 million by 2005.\n\n\"It's a rather dramatic increase in enrollment that we see coming. Some of it is immigration. Some of it is the baby \nboom echo - the children of baby boomers,\" Education Secretary Richard Riley said Thursday.\n\nElementary schools began seeing rising numbers of students in the mid-1980s as the children of about 76 million \nbaby boomers - born between World War II's end and 1964 - headed to school, according to Tom Snyder, an \nEducation Department statistician.\n\nThat second generation of baby boomers is now moving through high school. However, elementary schools have \ncontinued to feel enrollment pressure because the number of births in America, bolstered by immigration, has \nremained steady during the past four or five years, Snyder said.\n\nTo meet the need for space, school districts are building schools and additions or making do with portable \nclassrooms while keeping a close eye on teacher-student ratio requirements in their states. Some districts are \nshifting students by drawing new boundaries. Others are experimenting with holding school year-round.\n"}
