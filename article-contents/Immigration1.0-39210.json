{"title": "Letter: Are the medically disabled useless people to Berkeley?", "body": "\nRe: \"Berkeley blasted for tweet telling medically disabled to use 'own resources' during power outage\" \n(Eastbaytimes.com, Oct. 10):\n\nI am blind and have additional disabilities. I read the article about the city of Berkeley's tweet about finding one's \nown resources if a person with a medical need has to use electronic equipment during the outages.\n\nThis is the same place that started the independent living movement and disability rights.\n\nWhat is the city of Berkeley doing to help those most vulnerable human beings or do they think we are useless \npeople?\n\n                 Letter: Urgent assessment needed of power line maintenance                                      Letter: Make late \nstarts an option for students who can sleep in                                      Letter: I went to CVS for ice, but the freezer \nwas bare - I panicked                                      Letter: Make late starts an option for those who can sleep in                      \n                Letter: Warriors owners' support will be reciprocated by fans          Compare this with a Supreme Court \njudgement in favor of a blind person suing a pizza place for an inaccessible website. Now all the restaurants have \nto make their websites accessible to the blind.\n\nMarianne Haas Berkeley\n\n \n\nSubmit your letter to the editor via this form Read more            Letters to the Editor\n"}
