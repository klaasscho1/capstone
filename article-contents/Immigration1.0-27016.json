{"title": "Expedited Trials of Illegal Immigrants Are Questioned", "body": "\nCriminal defense and immigration lawyers yesterday challenged the government's use of expedited trials to \nconvict 306 illegal immigrant workers at a meat processing plant in Iowa in May, arguing that fast-tracked group \ntrials violated defendants' rights.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's immigration panel, said after a day-long \nhearing that she found the Justice Department's actions against workers at the Agriprocessors Inc. plant in \nPostville, Iowa, \"to be unusual and provocative, and I do have questions about whether they meet the \nrequirements of due process that is guaranteed in our Constitution.\"\n\nA Justice Department official, Deborah J. Rhodes, said all defendants were provided with criminal defense lawyers \nand interpreters, as well as access to immigration lawyers and consular officials. Federal judges also asked them \nand their lawyers if they understood and voluntarily agreed to the terms, she said.\n\n\"While the scope of the case presented unusual challenges, defendants' constitutional rights were carefully \nprotected and exercised,\" Rhodes said.\n\nThe hearings focused attention on the aftermath of the Agriprocessors raid, the largest immigration sweep at a \nsingle worksite, and on the Bush administration's expanding use of criminal charges against illegal immigrants. \nPreviously, illegal workers were generally held on administrative grounds and deported.\n\nErik Camayd-Freixas, one of 12 court interpreters who participated in the two-week Iowa proceedings, called them \na dangerous pilot effort that subjected defendants to unfounded charges, denied them access to bail because of \ntheir immigration status, gave lawyers too little time to advise their clients and deprived judges of a meaningful role \nin plea deals or sentencing.\n\nThe government convicted and sentenced most defendants in four days at temporary court and detention facilities \nset up at nearby cattle show fairgrounds.\n\n\nDefendants, most from Guatemala, were processed in groups of 10. Most were charged with aggravated identity \ntheft with the promise of at least a six-month stay in jail until trial, a mandatory two-year prison sentence if found \nguilty and deportation whether they were found guilty or not. Or they could plead guilty to a lesser charge of \ndocument fraud, serve five months in prison and be deported.\n\nMost agreed to the latter, even though six U.S. circuit courts of appeal have split evenly over the question of \nwhether aggravated identity theft requires that the government prove a defendant knows the person whose identity \nor Social Security number he has taken.\n\n\"If our honorable judges had known how this dubious experiment would have turned out, they never would have \nallowed it,\" Camayd-Freixas said.\n\nHomeland Security and Justice Department officials credit the new aggressive tactics with deterring border \ncrossings. Republicans on the Judiciary Committee accused Democrats of caring more about illegal immigrants \nthan the American workers whose jobs they take. \"The more the administration tries to do its job . . . the more they \nare criticized for enforcing the law,\" said Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.).\n"}
