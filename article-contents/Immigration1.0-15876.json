{"title": "Immigrant Services Envisioned For Enclave; Md. Community's Needs Long Neglected, Some Say", "body": "\nCharles Short stood in a field of balding grass, squinting into the sun -- and the future. \n\nTo his left, near the low-rise, low-rent apartments where many of Langley Park's residents live, was the land where \nhis employer, the Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, intends to build a two-story medical clinic. Beyond that, \nalong the chain-link fence lined with crushed beer cans, was where the youth services building will go. And to his \nright, the abandoned brick building that gang members keep spraying with graffiti will be razed to make way for a \ngym and a 600-seat chapel.  \n\n\"If you can just stretch your imagination, you can see that it will be like a village center, like a downtown for social \nservices,\" said Short, the secretary for social concerns for the archdiocese. \n\nThe archdiocese's project, the Mother Teresa Center, is at the heart of an ambitious plan by nonprofit groups that \nhave long assisted immigrants elsewhere in the Washington area to create a hub of service agencies in Langley \nPark, an immigrant enclave on the border of Prince George's and Montgomery counties. \n\nIn addition to the project on Merrimac Drive -- the center is due to open in two years at the soonest, officials said -- \nMontgomery-based CASA de Maryland is working to establish an employment training and legal aid center in a \nboarded-up mansion a half-block away. The District-based Latin American Youth Center, which would run tutoring \nand mentoring programs out of the archdiocese's planned youth services building, also hopes to open a smaller \noffice in Langley Park as soon as this spring. \n\nThe initiative marks a milestone in Prince George's history. Until recently, the county was known for its decades-\nlong transformation from a majority-white to a majority-black population and its emergence as a magnet for affluent \nAfrican Americans. But the county's Latino population rose during the 1990s and stood at 7 percent of the \npopulation by 2000. More recent census estimates put that figure at 9 percent. \n\nLangley Park, a sprawling zone of modest houses and garden apartment complexes, has been the entry point for \nmany newcomers, most of whom are immigrants. According to the 2000 Census, 64 percent of Langley Park's \nresidents are Latino and 17 percent have incomes below the poverty line. \n\nMany of them receive care at a large county health center in nearby Cheverly. \n\n\nImmigrant advocates, however, have said that the needs of residents have been neglected for years because of \nthe community's proximity to Silver Spring in Montgomery County, which has an even larger Latino population. \n\n\"This community has been caught in this question of, are they in Prince George's or are they in Montgomery \nCounty, and which jurisdiction should take responsibility,\" said Lori Kaplan, head of the Latin American Youth \nCenter. \"Meanwhile, there are thousands of kids and families who are very low income and not a lot of the \ninfrastructure and support services we have in D.C. . . . The need there is just tremendous.\" \n\nGustavo Torres, president of CASA de Maryland, credits Prince George's County Executive Jack B. Johnson (D) \nwith helping to break the impasse. Torres' organization, based in Silver Spring just blocks from the Langley Park \nborder, considered opening a branch in Prince George's eight years ago. \"Almost half of the services we provide \nare to residents from Prince George's,\" Torres said. \n\n CASA de Maryland also has long wanted to open a hiring hall -- separate from its employment center -- for \nlaborers who gather to wait for work at University Boulevard and New Hampshire Avenue in Langley Park, to the \nconsternation of many area businesses. \n\nBut Torres said his organization was deterred by a rocky relationship with former Prince George's county executive \nWayne K. Curry (D). Johnson, by contrast, made overtures to the Latino community within weeks of his election in \nNovember 2002 -- including appointing a Hispanic liaison, William Campos. Last week, Campos won the \nDemocratic Party's nomination to the County Council seat vacated by Peter A. Shapiro, representing the area that \nincludes Langley Park. \n\nEncouraged by such developments and by the support of Shapiro, CASA de Maryland has been negotiating with \nthe owner of a large complex of apartment buildings in Langley Park, Sawyer Realty Holdings, to lease the \nmansion, on a sprawling lawn in the center of that complex.  \n\nEven if a deal is reached, some hurdles will remain, including the yet-undetermined cost of renovating the mansion. \nCASA de Maryland estimates it will need $425,000 annually to operate the center, but Torres said that the group \nhas secured commitments of $40,000 from private foundations and that it will ask Prince George's County for \nassistance. \n\n Sawyer Realty has agreed to effectively donate to the archdiocese three acres a half-block from the mansion. And \nShort said the church has lined up a builder and raised $6 million of the $12 million needed to build the center it \nenvisions.  \n\nIf all the plans go forward, Short predicted, Langley Park could become a national model. \"Years ago,\" he said, \n\"people saw this place as a helpless morass of human suffering and political confusion. Now I'm hoping that people \nwill see this as a place of leadership.\" \n"}
