{"title": "National Briefing  South: North Carolina: Pakistani Pleads Not Guilty", "body": "\nA Pakistani man who was arrested in July after the Charlotte police saw him videotaping buildings downtown \npleaded not guilty to six offenses unrelated to terrorism. Federal prosecutors say the man, Kamran Akhtar, lied to \nthe authorities about his name and his immigration status, possessed false identification and refused to leave the \ncountry after he was denied asylum in 1997. Tapes in Mr. Akhtar's possession included images of buildings and \ntransit systems in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and New Orleans, and the building in Charlotte where the F.B.I. office is \nsituated. Mr. Akhtar's family has said the tapes are innocent tourist ones.   Ariel Hart (NYT)\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
