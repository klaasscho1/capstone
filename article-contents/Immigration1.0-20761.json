{"title": "National Briefing  Southwest: Texas: New Trial Ordered In Smuggling Case", "body": "\nA federal appeals court has ordered a new trial for the truck driver convicted in a 2003 human smuggling attempt \nthat ended 100 miles southwest of Houston and left 19 illegal immigrants dead. The ruling means the driver, \nTyrone Williams, could once more face the death penalty. A three-judge panel of the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled Wednesday that the verdict was invalid because the jury had failed to decide \nwhether Mr. Williams was directly responsible for the deaths. Mr. Williams's lawyer said he would appeal to the \nSupreme Court.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
