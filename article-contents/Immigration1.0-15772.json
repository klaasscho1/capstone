{"title": "Sex Abusers of Children Are Facing Deportation; Agents Target Foreign-Born Criminals", "body": "\nA dozen men convicted of sex crimes against children were arrested in the Washington area last week and \ntargeted for deportation under a new national program aimed at foreign-born sex offenders, Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement officials said yesterday. \n\nThe men were rounded up after federal agents launched a review of the 11,000 people registered as convicted sex \noffenders in Virginia. The agents were looking for those who had committed crimes specifically against children \nand were not U.S. citizens and therefore eligible for deportation, according to Kevin Delli-Colli, acting special \nagent in charge of the Washington Immigration and Customs office. \n\nThe 12 arrests, along with seven in the Richmond and Tidewater areas, were part of a program called \"Operation \nPredator.\"  \n\nThe program culls through sex-offender registries to find possible deportees and has arrested about 2,180 foreign-\nborn child sex offenders nationally since July, said Frank Figueroa, the program's national coordinator. \nNationwide, there are about 304,000 people listed on sex-offender registries, Figueroa said.  \n\nOf the 19 arrested, eight were found in Northern Virginia and four in the District, Delli-Colli said. Immigration and \nCustoms officials, members of a new, combined agency under the Department of Homeland Security, declined to \nrelease the names of those arrested or their convictions yesterday. The 19 detainees came from 15 countries. \n\nPeople who are not born in the United States but obtain a green card, which grants legal residency, can be \ndeported if they are convicted of an aggravated felony. Those who become U.S. citizens cannot be deported. \n\nDelli-Colli said the program was created to protect children from people who might become Internet child \npornographers, child sex traffickers or simply repeat offenders. \"Through Operation Predator,\" he said, \"we are \nsystematically identifying and apprehending those who pose threats to our children.\" \n\nAll 50 states have mandatory sex-offender registries, which require convicted sex offenders to provide their home \naddress to state police in the state where they live, regardless of where they were convicted. The registries often \nare called \"Megan's List,\" in memory of 7-year-old Megan Kanka, who was murdered by a convicted sex offender in \n1994. Her death led to federal legislation requiring states to maintain the registries. \n\n\nIn many cases, when sex offenders are foreign-born and eligible for deportation, local authorities notify \nImmigration and Customs. The offenders are held until after they have served jail or prison time. \n\nDelli-Colli said hundreds of the foreign-born offenders uncovered during the recent Virginia search were in the \ndeportation system. \n\nUsing the federal Cyber Crimes Center in Fairfax, an arm of the new combined immigration agency, along with \nresources of the Virginia State Police, teams of immigration agents and state troopers found 19 child sex \noffenders on Virginia's registry who were eligible for deportation. Four were in the country illegally, making them \neligible for immediate deportation without a hearing, Delli-Colli said. \n\nThe other 15 offenders had legal resident status, but the severity of their crimes made them candidates for \ndeportation. They will face deportation proceedings and are being held without bond. \n\nDelli-Colli said he did not know why the 19 offenders hadn't already been referred to immigration officials for \npossible deportation. In some instances, the offenders might have been released from custody before they could \nbe detained, officials said. \n\nThe convictions of those arrested last week dated from the mid-1990s to 2001. \n"}
