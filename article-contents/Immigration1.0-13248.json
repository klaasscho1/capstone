{"title": "Illegal Immigrants Attacked In Arizona; Two Are Killed", "body": "\n Gunmen opened fire on a dozen illegal immigrants who were apparently waiting to be picked up by smugglers, \nand two of the border crossers were killed. \n\n One man escaped, but the assailants -- possibly immigrant smugglers -- may have kidnapped the other survivors, \nsaid Mike Minter, spokesman for the Pinal County Sheriff's Department. \n\n \"We've been over 15 square miles out here and not found one track from any of the individuals,\" he said Thursday. \n\n The bodies were found Wednesday at a remote cattle pond about 35 miles northwest of Tucson that is often used \nas a spot to pick up and drop off border crossers, Minter said. \n\n The man who ran off ended up at Red Rock Feeding Co., a cattle feed lot about a mile west of the pond. \n\n He told David Cook, the lot's assistant manager, that he and 27 other illegal immigrants had been dropped off at \nthe pond earlier in the day, Cook said. \n\n \"A car came with a [smuggler] and took eight of them. A little while later, a car came and took another eight of \nthem. The 12 of them just waited, and that's when two guys came up on them and shot them,\" Cook said. \n\n On Thursday, Texas troopers discovered 25 other illegal immigrants, including children, in a locked tractor-trailer \nthat was stopped for speeding. They lacked food and water but appeared to be in good health. \n\n The driver was arrested after officers found more than four grams of methamphetamine, a pistol and $ 9,620 in \ncash that may have been paid by the immigrants, officials said. The border patrol said the driver, who was not \nidentified, would be charged with alien smuggling. \n\n Earlier this week, workers opening a train car at a grain elevator in Iowa found the badly decomposed bodies of 11 \npeople believed to have been illegal immigrants smuggled into the country in June. \n"}
