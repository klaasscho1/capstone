What are the Regulatory Plan and the Unified Agenda?\n\n The Regulatory Plan serves as a defining statement of the \n\nAdministration's regulatory and deregulatory policies and priorities. \n\nThe Plan is part of the fall edition of the Unified Agenda. Each \n\nparticipating agency's regulatory plan contains: (1) A narrative \n\nstatement of the agency's regulatory and deregulatory priorities, and, \n\nfor the most part, (2) a description of the most important significant \n\nregulatory and deregulatory actions that the agency reasonably expects \n\nto issue in proposed or final form during the upcoming fiscal year. \n\nThis edition includes the regulatory plans of 30 agencies.\n\n The Unified Agenda provides information about regulations that the \n\nGovernment is considering or reviewing. The Unified Agenda has appeared \n\nin the Federal Register twice each year since 1983 and has been \n\navailable online since 1995. The complete Unified Agenda is available \n\nto the public at http://reginfo.gov. The online Unified Agenda offers \n\nflexible search tools and access to the historic Unified Agenda \n\ndatabase to 1995.\n\n The fall 2014 Unified Agenda publication appearing in the Federal \n\nRegister consists of The Regulatory Plan and agency regulatory \n\nflexibility\n\n[[Page 76457]]\n\nagendas, in accordance with the publication requirements of the \n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act. Agency regulatory flexibility agendas \n\ncontain only those Agenda entries for rules that are likely to have a \n\nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities \n\nand entries that have been selected for periodic review under section \n\n610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Printed entries display only the \n\nfields required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Complete agenda \n\ninformation for those entries appears, in a uniform format, in the \n\nonline Unified Agenda at http://reginfo.gov.\n\n These publication formats meet the publication mandates of the \n\nhttp://reginfo.gov/\nhttp://reginfo.gov/\n\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866 (incorporated in \n\nExecutive Order 13563), as well as moved the Agenda process to the goal \n\nof online availability, resulting in a reduced cost in printing. The \n\ncurrent online format does not reduce the amount of information \n\navailable to the public. The complete online edition of the Unified \n\nAgenda includes regulatory agendas from 61 Federal agencies. Agencies \n\nof the United States Congress are not included.\n\n The following agencies have no entries identified for inclusion in \n\nthe printed regulatory flexibility agenda. An asterisk (*) indicates \n\nagencies that appear in The Regulatory Plan. The regulatory agendas of \n\nthese agencies are available to the public at            http://reginfo.gov.\n\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development*\n\nDepartment of State\n\nDepartment of Treasury*\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs*\n\nAdvisory Council on Historic Preservation\n\nAgency for International Development\n\nCommission on Civil Rights\n\nCommittee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled\n\nCorporation for National and Community Service\n\nCourt Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of \n\nColumbia\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission*\n\nInstitute of Museum and Library Services\n\nNational Archives and Records Administration*\n\nNational Endowment for the Arts\n\nNational Endowment for the Humanities\n\nNational Science Foundation\n\nOffice of Government Ethics\n\nOffice of Management and Budget\n\nOffice of Personnel Management*\n\nPeace Corps\n\nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation*\n\nRailroad Retirement Board\n\nSocial Security Administration*\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau*\n\nConsumer Product Safety Commission*\n\nFarm Credit Administration\n\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission\n\nFederal Housing Finance Agency\n\nFederal Maritime Commission\n\nhttp://reginfo.gov/\n\n\nFederal Trade Commission*\n\nGulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration CouncilNational Credit Union \n\nAdministration\n\nNational Credit Union Administration\n\nNational Indian Gaming Commission*\n\nNational Labor Relations Board\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board\n\nPostal Regulatory Commission\n\nRecovery Accountability and Transparency Board\n\n The Regulatory Information Service Center compiles the Unified \n\nAgenda for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), \n\npart of the Office of Management and Budget. OIRA is responsible for \n\noverseeing the Federal Government's regulatory, paperwork, and \n\ninformation resource management activities, including implementation of \n\nExecutive Order 12866 (incorporated in Executive Order 13563). The \n\nCenter also provides information about Federal regulatory activity to \n\nthe President and his Executive Office, the Congress, agency officials, \n\nand the public.\n\n The activities included in the Agenda are, in general, those that \n\nwill have a regulatory action within the next 12 months. Agencies may \n\nchoose to include activities that will have a longer timeframe than 12 \n\nmonths. Agency agendas also show actions or reviews completed or \n\nwithdrawn since the last Unified Agenda. Executive Order 12866 does not \n\nrequire agencies to include regulations concerning military or foreign \n\naffairs functions or regulations related to agency organization, \n\nmanagement, or personnel matters.\n\n Agencies prepared entries for this publication to give the public \n\nnotice of their plans to review, propose, and issue regulations. They \n\nhave tried to predict their activities over the next 12 months as \n\naccurately as possible, but dates and schedules are subject to change. \n\nAgencies may withdraw some of the regulations now under development, \n\nand they may issue or propose other regulations not included in their \n\nagendas. Agency actions in the rulemaking process may occur before or \n\nafter the dates they have listed. The Regulatory Plan and Unified \n\nAgenda do not create a legal obligation on agencies to adhere to \n\nschedules in this publication or to confine their regulatory activities \n\nto those regulations that appear within it.\n\nII. Why Are The Regulatory Plan and the Unified Agenda published?\n\n The Regulatory Plan and the Unified Agenda helps agencies comply \n\nwith their obligations under the Regulatory Flexibility Act and various \n\nExecutive orders and other statutes.\n\n\n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act\n\n The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to identify those \n\nrules that may have a significant economic impact on a substantial \n\nnumber of small entities (5 U.S.C. 602). Agencies meet that requirement \n\nby including the information in their submissions for the Unified \n\nAgenda. Agencies may also indicate those regulations that they are \n\nreviewing as part of their periodic review of existing rules under the \n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 610). Executive Order 13272 \n\nentitled ``Proper Consideration of Small Entities in Agency \n\nRulemaking,'' signed August 13, 2002 (67 FR 53461), provides additional \n\nguidance on compliance with the Act.\n\nExecutive Order 12866\n\n Executive Order 12866 entitled ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' \n\nsigned September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51735), requires covered agencies to \n\nprepare an agenda of all regulations under development or review. The \n\nOrder also requires that certain agencies prepare annually a regulatory \n\nplan of their ``most important significant regulatory actions,'' which \n\nappears as part of the fall Unified Agenda. Executive Order 13497, \n\nsigned January 30, 2009 (74 FR 6113), revoked the amendments to \n\nExecutive Order 12866 that were contained in Executive Order 13258 and \n\nExecutive Order 13422.\n\nExecutive Order 13563\n\n Executive Order 13563 entitled ``Improving Regulation and \n\nRegulatory Review,'' issued on January 18, 2011, supplements and \n\nreaffirms the principles, structures, and definitions governing \n\ncontemporary regulatory review that were established in Executive Order \n\n12866, which includes the general principles of regulation and public \n\nparticipation, and orders integration and innovation in coordination \n\nacross agencies; flexible approaches where relevant, feasible, and \n\nconsistent with regulatory approaches; scientific integrity in any \n\nscientific or technological information and processes used to support \n\nthe agencies' regulatory actions; and retrospective analysis of \n\nexisting regulations.\n\n[[Page 76458]]\n\nExecutive Order 13132\n\n Executive Order 13132 entitled ``Federalism,'' signed August 4, \n\n1999 (64 FR 43255), directs agencies to have an accountable process to \n\nensure meaningful and timely input by State and local officials in the \n\n\n\ndevelopment of regulatory policies that have ``federalism \n\nimplications'' as defined in the Order. Under the Order, an agency that \n\nis proposing a regulation with federalism implications, which either \n\npreempt State law or impose non-statutory unfunded substantial direct \n\ncompliance costs on State and local governments, must consult with \n\nState and local officials early in the process of developing the \n\nregulation. In addition, the agency must provide to the Director of the \n\nOffice of Management and Budget a federalism summary impact statement \n\nfor such a regulation, which consists of a description of the extent of \n\nthe agency's prior consultation with State and local officials, a \n\nsummary of their concerns and the agency's position supporting the need \n\nto issue the regulation, and a statement of the extent to which those \n\nconcerns have been met. As part of this effort, agencies include in \n\ntheir submissions for the Unified Agenda information on whether their \n\nregulatory actions may have an effect on the various levels of \n\ngovernment and whether those actions have federalism implications.\n\nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4, title II) \n\nrequires agencies to prepare written assessments of the costs and \n\nbenefits of significant regulatory actions ``that may result in the \n\nexpenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, \n\nor by the private sector, of $100,000,000 or more . . . in any 1 year . \n\n. . . '' The requirement does not apply to independent regulatory \n\nagencies, nor does it apply to certain subject areas excluded by \n\nsection 4 of the Act. Affected agencies identify in the Unified Agenda \n\nthose regulatory actions they believe are subject to title II of the \n\nAct.\n\nExecutive Order 13211\n\n Executive Order 13211 entitled ``Actions Concerning Regulations \n\nThat Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use,'' signed \n\nMay 18, 2001 (66 FR 28355), directs agencies to provide, to the extent \n\npossible, information regarding the adverse effects that agency actions \n\nmay have on the supply, distribution, and use of energy. Under the \n\nOrder, the agency must prepare and submit a Statement of Energy Effects \n\nto the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory \n\nAffairs, Office of Management and Budget, for ``those matters \n\nidentified as significant energy actions.'' As part of this effort, \n\nagencies may optionally include in their submissions for the Unified \n\nAgenda information on whether they have prepared or plan to prepare a \n\nStatement of Energy Effects for their regulatory actions.\n\n\n\nSmall Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act\n\n The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Pub. L. \n\n104-121, title II) established a procedure for congressional review of \n\nrules (5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), which defers, unless exempted, the \n\neffective date of a ``major'' rule for at least 60 days from the \n\npublication of the final rule in the Federal Register. The Act \n\nspecifies that a rule is ``major'' if it has resulted, or is likely to \n\nresult, in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or \n\nmeets other criteria specified in that Act. The Act provides that the \n\nAdministrator of OIRA will make the final determination as to whether a \n\nrule is major.\n\nIII. How Are The Regulatory Plan and the Unified Agenda organized?\n\n The Regulatory Plan appears in part II in a daily edition of the \n\nFederal Register. The Plan is a single document beginning with an \n\nintroduction, followed by a table of contents, followed by each \n\nagency's section of the Plan. Following the Plan in the Federal \n\nRegister, as separate parts, are the regulatory flexibility agendas for \n\neach agency whose agenda includes entries for rules which are likely to \n\nhave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small \n\nentities or rules that have been selected for periodic review under \n\nsection 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Each printed agenda \n\nappears as a separate part. The sections of the Plan and the parts of \n\nthe Unified Agenda are organized alphabetically in four groups: Cabinet \n\ndepartments; other executive agencies; the Federal Acquisition \n\nRegulation, a joint authority (Agenda only); and independent regulatory \n\nagencies. Agencies may in turn be divided into subagencies. Each \n\nprinted agency agenda has a table of contents listing the agency's \n\nprinted entries that follow. Each agency's part of the Agenda contains \n\na preamble providing information specific to that agency. Each printed \n\nagency agenda has a table of contents listing the agency's printed \n\nentries that follow.\n\n Each agency's section of the Plan contains a narrative statement of \n\nregulatory priorities and, for most agencies, a description of the \n\nagency's most important significant regulatory and deregulatory \n\nactions. Each agency's part of the Agenda contains a preamble providing \n\ninformation specific to that agency plus descriptions of the agency's \n\nregulatory and deregulatory actions.\n\n\n\n The online, complete Unified Agenda contains the preambles of all \n\nparticipating agencies. Unlike the printed edition, the online Agenda \n\nhas no fixed ordering. In the online Agenda, users can select the \n\nparticular agencies whose agendas they want to see. Users have broad \n\nflexibility to specify the characteristics of the entries of interest \n\nto them by choosing the desired responses to individual data fields. To \n\nsee a listing of all of an agency's entries, a user can select the \n\nagency without specifying any particular characteristics of entries.\n\n Each entry in the Agenda is associated with one of five rulemaking \n\nstages. The rulemaking stages are:\n\n 1. Prerule Stage--actions agencies will undertake to determine \n\nwhether or how to initiate rulemaking. Such actions occur prior to a \n\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) and may include Advance Notices of \n\nProposed Rulemaking (ANPRMs) and reviews of existing regulations.\n\n 2. Proposed Rule Stage--actions for which agencies plan to publish \n\na Notice of Proposed Rulemaking as the next step in their rulemaking \n\nprocess or for which the closing date of the NPRM Comment Period is the \n\nnext step.\n\n 3. Final Rule Stage--actions for which agencies plan to publish a \n\nfinal rule or an interim final rule or to take other final action as \n\nthe next step.\n\n 4. Long-Term Actions--items under development but for which the \n\nagency does not expect to have a regulatory action within the 12 months \n\nafter publication of this edition of the Unified Agenda. Some of the \n\nentries in this section may contain abbreviated information.\n\n 5. Completed Actions--actions or reviews the agency has completed \n\nor withdrawn since publishing its last agenda. This section also \n\nincludes items the agency began and completed between issues of the \n\nAgenda.\n\n Long-Term Actions are rulemakings reported during the publication \n\ncycle that are outside of the required 12-month reporting period for \n\nwhich the Agenda was intended. Completed Actions in the publication \n\ncycle are rulemakings that are ending their lifecycle either by \n\nWithdrawal or completion of the rulemaking process. Therefore, the \n\nLong-Term and Completed RINs do not represent the\n\n[[Page 76459]]\n\nongoing, forward-looking nature intended for reporting developing \n\nrulemakings in the Agenda pursuant to Executive Order 12866, section \n\n4(b) and 4(c). To further differentiate these two stages of rulemaking \n\nin the Unified Agenda from active rulemakings, Long-Term and Completed \n\nActions are reported separately from active rulemakings, which can be \n\n\n\nany of the first three stages of rulemaking listed above. A separate \n\nsearch function is provided on http://reginfo.gov to search for \n\nCompleted and Long-Term Actions apart from each other and active RINs.\n\n A bullet () preceding the title of an entry indicates that \n\nthe entry is appearing in the Unified Agenda for the first time.\n\n In the printed edition, all entries are numbered sequentially from \n\nthe beginning to the end of the publication. The sequence number \n\npreceding the title of each entry identifies the location of the entry \n\nin this edition. The sequence number is used as the reference in the \n\nprinted table of contents. Sequence numbers are not used in the online \n\nUnified Agenda because the unique Regulation Identifier Number (RIN) is \n\nable to provide this cross-reference capability.\n\n Editions of the Unified Agenda prior to fall 2007 contained several \n\nindexes, which identified entries with various characteristics. These \n\nincluded regulatory actions for which agencies believe that the \n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act may require a Regulatory Flexibility \n\nAnalysis, actions selected for periodic review under section 610(c) of \n\nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act, and actions that may have federalism \n\nimplications as defined in Executive Order 13132 or other effects on \n\nlevels of government. These indexes are no longer compiled, because \n\nusers of the online Unified Agenda have the flexibility to search for \n\nentries with any combination of desired characteristics. The online \n\nedition retains the Unified Agenda's subject index based on the Federal \n\nRegister Thesaurus of Indexing Terms. In addition, online users have \n\nthe option of searching Agenda text fields for words or phrases.\n\nIV. What information appears for each entry?\n\n All entries in the online Unified Agenda contain uniform data \n\nelements including, at a minimum, the following information:\n\n Title of the Regulation--a brief description of the subject of the \n\nregulation. In the printed edition, the notation ``Section 610 Review'' \n\nfollowing the title indicates that the agency has selected the rule for \n\nits periodic review of existing rules under the Regulatory Flexibility \n\nAct (5 U.S.C. 610(c)). Some agencies have indicated completions of \n\nsection 610 reviews or rulemaking actions resulting from completed \n\nsection 610 reviews. In the online edition, these notations appear in a \n\nseparate field.\n\n Priority--an indication of the significance of the regulation. \n\nAgencies assign each entry to one of the following five categories of \n\nsignificance.\n\n(1) Economically Significant\n\nhttp://reginfo.gov/\n\n\n As defined in Executive Order 12866, a rulemaking action that will \n\nhave an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or will \n\nadversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the \n\neconomy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public \n\nhealth or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or \n\ncommunities. The definition of an ``economically significant'' rule is \n\nsimilar but not identical to the definition of a ``major'' rule under 5 \n\nU.S.C. 801 (Pub. L. 104-121). (See below.)\n\n(2) Other Significant\n\n A rulemaking that is not Economically Significant but is considered \n\nSignificant by the agency. This category includes rules that the agency \n\nanticipates will be reviewed under Executive Order 12866 or rules that \n\nare a priority of the agency head. These rules may or may not be \n\nincluded in the agency's regulatory plan.\n\n(3) Substantive, Nonsignificant\n\n A rulemaking that has substantive impacts but is neither \n\nSignificant, nor Routine and Frequent, nor Informational/\n\nAdministrative/Other.\n\n(4) Routine and Frequent\n\n A rulemaking that is a specific case of a multiple recurring \n\napplication of a regulatory program in the Code of Federal Regulations \n\nand that does not alter the body of the regulation.\n\n(5) Informational/Administrative/Other\n\n A rulemaking that is primarily informational or pertains to agency \n\nmatters not central to accomplishing the agency's regulatory mandate \n\nbut that the agency places in the Unified Agenda to inform the public \n\nof the activity.\n\n Major--whether the rule is ``major'' under 5 U.S.C. 801 (Pub. L. \n\n104-121) because it has resulted or is likely to result in an annual \n\neffect on the economy of $100 million or more or meets other criteria \n\nspecified in that Act. The Act provides that the Administrator of the \n\nOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs will make the final \n\ndetermination as to whether a rule is major.\n\n Unfunded Mandates--whether the rule is covered by section 202 of \n\nthe Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4). The Act \n\nrequires that, before issuing an NPRM likely to result in a mandate \n\n\n\nthat may result in expenditures by State, local, and tribal \n\ngovernments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of more than \n\n$100 million in 1 year, agencies, other than independent regulatory \n\nagencies, shall prepare a written statement containing an assessment of \n\nthe anticipated costs and benefits of the Federal mandate.\n\n Legal Authority--the section(s) of the United States Code (U.S.C.) \n\nor Public Law (Pub. L.) or the Executive order (E.O.) that authorize(s) \n\nthe regulatory action. Agencies may provide popular name references to \n\nlaws in addition to these citations.\n\n CFR Citation--the section(s) of the Code of Federal Regulations \n\nthat will be affected by the action.\n\n Legal Deadline--whether the action is subject to a statutory or \n\njudicial deadline, the date of that deadline, and whether the deadline \n\npertains to an NPRM, a Final Action, or some other action.\n\n Abstract--a brief description of the problem the regulation will \n\naddress; the need for a Federal solution; to the extent available, \n\nalternatives that the agency is considering to address the problem; and \n\npotential costs and benefits of the action.\n\n Timetable--the dates and citations (if available) for all past \n\nsteps and a projected date for at least the next step for the \n\nregulatory action. A date displayed in the form 12/00/14 means the \n\nagency is predicting the month and year the action will take place but \n\nnot the day it will occur. In some instances, agencies may indicate \n\nwhat the next action will be, but the date of that action is ``To Be \n\nDetermined.'' ``Next Action Undetermined'' indicates the agency does \n\nnot know what action it will take next.\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required--whether an analysis is \n\nrequired by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) \n\nbecause the rulemaking action is likely to have a significant economic \n\nimpact on a substantial number of small entities as defined by the Act.\n\n Small Entities Affected--the types of small entities (businesses, \n\ngovernmental jurisdictions, or organizations) on which the rulemaking \n\naction is likely to have an impact as defined by the Regulatory \n\nFlexibility Act. Some agencies have chosen to indicate likely effects \n\non small entities even though they believe\n\n[[Page 76460]]\n\nthat a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis will not be required.\n\n Government Levels Affected--whether the action is expected to \n\naffect levels of government and, if so, whether the governments are \n\nState, local, tribal, or Federal.\n\n International Impacts--whether the regulation is expected to have \n\ninternational trade and investment effects, or otherwise may be of \n\n\n\ninterest to the Nation's international trading partners.\n\n Federalism--whether the action has ``federalism implications'' as \n\ndefined in Executive Order 13132. This term refers to actions ``that \n\nhave substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship \n\nbetween the national government and the States, or on the distribution \n\nof power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.'' \n\nIndependent regulatory agencies are not required to supply this \n\ninformation.\n\n Included in the Regulatory Plan--whether the rulemaking was \n\nincluded in the agency's current regulatory plan published in fall \n\n2014.\n\n Agency Contact--the name and phone number of at least one person in \n\nthe agency who is knowledgeable about the rulemaking action. The agency \n\nmay also provide the title, address, fax number, email address, and TDD \n\nfor each agency contact.\n\n Some agencies have provided the following optional information:\n\n RIN Information URL--the Internet address of a site that provides \n\nmore information about the entry.\n\n Public Comment URL--the Internet address of a site that will accept \n\npublic comments on the entry. Alternatively, timely public comments may \n\nbe submitted at the Governmentwide e-rulemaking site, http://www.regulations.gov.\n\n Additional Information--any information an agency wishes to include \n\nthat does not have a specific corresponding data element.\n\n Compliance Cost to the Public--the estimated gross compliance cost \n\nof the action.\n\n Affected Sectors--the industrial sectors that the action may most \n\naffect, either directly or indirectly. Affected sectors are identified \n\nby North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes.\n\n Energy Effects--an indication of whether the agency has prepared or \n\nplans to prepare a Statement of Energy Effects for the action, as \n\nrequired by Executive Order 13211 ``Actions Concerning Regulations That \n\nSignificantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use,'' signed May \n\n18, 2001 (66 FR 28355).\n\n Related RINs--one or more past or current RIN(s) associated with \n\nactivity related to this action, such as merged RINs, split RINs, new \n\nactivity for previously completed RINs, or duplicate RINs.\n\n Statement of Need--a description of the need for the regulatory \n\naction.\n\n Summary of the Legal Basis--a description of the legal basis for \n\nthe action, including whether any aspect of the action is required by \n\nstatute or court order.\n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\n\n\n Alternatives--a description of the alternatives the agency has \n\nconsidered or will consider as required by section 4(c)(1)(B) of \n\nExecutive Order 12866.\n\n Anticipated Costs and Benefits--a description of preliminary \n\nestimates of the anticipated costs and benefits of the action.\n\n Risks--a description of the magnitude of the risk the action \n\naddresses, the amount by which the agency expects the action to reduce \n\nthis risk, and the relation of the risk and this risk reduction effort \n\nto other risks and risk reduction efforts within the agency's \n\njurisdiction.\n\nV. Abbreviations\n\n The following abbreviations appear throughout this publication:\n\n ANPRM--An Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is a preliminary \n\nnotice, published in the Federal Register, announcing that an agency is \n\nconsidering a regulatory action. An agency may issue an ANPRM before it \n\ndevelops a detailed proposed rule. An ANPRM describes the general area \n\nthat may be subject to regulation and usually asks for public comment \n\non the issues and options being discussed. An ANPRM is issued only when \n\nan agency believes it needs to gather more information before \n\nproceeding to a notice of proposed rulemaking.\n\n CFR--The Code of Federal Regulations is an annual codification of \n\nthe general and permanent regulations published in the Federal Register \n\nby the agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 \n\ntitles, each title covering a broad area subject to Federal regulation. \n\nThe CFR is keyed to and kept up to date by the daily issues of the \n\nFederal Register.\n\n EO--An Executive order is a directive from the President to \n\nExecutive agencies, issued under constitutional or statutory authority. \n\nExecutive orders are published in the Federal Register and in title 3 \n\nof the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n FR--The Federal Register is a daily Federal Government publication \n\nthat provides a uniform system for publishing Presidential documents, \n\nall proposed and final regulations, notices of meetings, and other \n\nofficial documents issued by Federal agencies.\n\n FY--The Federal fiscal year runs from October 1 to September 30.\n\n NPRM--A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is the document an agency \n\nissues and publishes in the Federal Register that describes and \n\nsolicits public comments on a proposed regulatory action. Under the \n\nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), an NPRM must include, at a \n\nminimum:\n\n A statement of the time, place, and nature of the public \n\n\n\nrulemaking proceeding;\n\n a reference to the legal authority under which the rule is \n\nproposed; and\n\n either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a \n\ndescription of the subjects and issues involved.\n\n Public Law (or Pub. L.)--A public law is a law passed by Congress \n\nand signed by the President or enacted over his veto. It has general \n\napplicability, unlike a private law that applies only to those persons \n\nor entities specifically designated. Public laws are numbered in \n\nsequence throughout the 2-year life of each Congress; for example, Pub. \n\nL. 112-4 is the fourth public law of the 112th Congress.\n\n RFA--A Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is a description and \n\nanalysis of the impact of a rule on small entities, including small \n\nbusinesses, small governmental jurisdictions, and certain small not-\n\nfor-profit organizations. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 \n\net seq.) requires each agency to prepare an initial RFA for public \n\ncomment when it is required to publish an NPRM and to make available a \n\nfinal RFA when the final rule is published, unless the agency head \n\ncertifies that the rule would not have a significant economic impact on \n\na substantial number of small entities.\n\n RIN--The Regulation Identifier Number is assigned by the Regulatory \n\nInformation Service Center to identify each regulatory action listed in \n\nthe Regulatory Plan and the Unified Agenda, as directed by Executive \n\nOrder 12866 (section 4(b)). Additionally, OMB has asked agencies to \n\ninclude RINs in the headings of their Rule and Proposed Rule documents \n\nwhen publishing them in the Federal Register, to make it easier for the \n\npublic and agency officials to track the publication history of \n\nregulatory actions throughout their development.\n\n Seq. No.--The sequence number identifies the location of an entry \n\nin the printed edition of the Regulatory Plan and the Unified Agenda. \n\nNote that a specific regulatory action will have the\n\n[[Page 76461]]\n\nsame RIN throughout its development but will generally have different \n\nsequence numbers if it appears in different printed editions of the \n\nUnified Agenda. Sequence numbers are not used in the online Unified \n\nAgenda.\n\n U.S.C.--The United States Code is a consolidation and codification \n\nof all general and permanent laws of the United States. The U.S.C. is \n\ndivided into 50 titles, each title covering a broad area of Federal \n\n\n\nlaw.\n\nVI.

Thomas,\n\nExecutive Director.\n\nINTRODUCTION TO THE 2014 REGULATORY PLAN\n\n Executive Order 12866, issued in 1993, requires the production of a \n\nUnified Regulatory Agenda and Regulatory Plan. Executive Order 13563, \n\nissued in 2011, reaffirmed the requirements of Executive Order 12866.\n\n Consistent with these Executive Orders, the Office of Information \n\nand Regulatory Affairs is providing the 2014 Unified Regulatory Agenda \n\n(Agenda) and the Regulatory Plan (Plan) for public review. The Agenda \n\nand Plan are preliminary statements of regulatory and deregulatory \n\npolicies and priorities under consideration. The Agenda and Plan \n\ninclude ``active rulemakings'' that agencies could possibly conclude \n\nover the next year. As in previous years, however, this list may also \n\ninclude some rules that agencies will not end up issuing in the coming \n\nyear.\n\n The Plan provides a list of important regulatory actions that \n\nagencies are considering for issuance in proposed or final form during \n\nthe 2015 fiscal year. In contrast, the Agenda is a more inclusive list, \n\nincluding numerous ministerial actions and routine rulemakings, as well \n\nhttp://reginfo.gov/\nhttp://www.fdsys.gov/\n\n\nas long-term initiatives that agencies do not plan to complete in the \n\ncoming year but on which they are actively working.\n\n A central purpose of the Agenda is to involve the public, including \n\nState, local, and tribal officials, in federal regulatory planning. The \n\npublic examination of the Agenda and Plan will facilitate public \n\nparticipation in a regulatory system that, in the words of Executive \n\nOrder 13563, protects ``public health, welfare, safety, and our \n\nenvironment while promoting economic growth, innovation, \n\ncompetitiveness, and job creation.'' We emphasize that rules listed on \n\nthe Agenda must still undergo significant development and review before \n\nthey are issued. No regulatory action can become effective until it has \n\ngone through the legally required processes, which generally include \n\npublic notice and comment. Any proposed or final action must also \n\nsatisfy the requirements of relevant statutes, Executive Orders, and \n\nPresidential Memoranda. Those requirements, public comments, and new \n\ninformation may or may not lead an agency to go forward with an action \n\nthat is currently under contemplation.\n\n Among other information, the Agenda also provides an initial \n\nclassification of whether a rulemaking is ``significant'' or \n\n``economically significant'' under the terms of Executive Orders 12866 \n\nand 13563. Whether a regulation is listed on the Agenda as \n\n``economically significant'' within the meaning of Executive Order \n\n12866 (generally, having an annual effect on the economy of $100 \n\nmillion or more) does not necessarily indicate whether it imposes high \n\ncosts on the private sector. Economically significant actions may \n\nimpose small costs or even no costs.\n\n Regulations may count as economically significant because they \n\nconfer large benefits or remove significant burdens. For example, the \n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services issues regulations on an annual \n\nbasis, pursuant to statute, to govern annual changes in Medicare \n\npayments. These payment regulations effectively authorize transfers of \n\nbillions of dollars to hospitals and other health care providers each \n\nyear. Regulations might therefore count as economically significant not \n\nbecause they impose significant regulatory costs on the private sector, \n\nbut because they involve transfer payments as required or authorized by \n\nlaw.\n\nEOs 13563 and 13610: The Retrospective Review of Regulation\n\n Executive Order 13563 reaffirms the principles, structures, and \n\ndefinitions in Executive Order 12866, which has long governed \n\nregulatory review. Executive Order 13563 explicitly points to the need \n\nfor predictability and certainty, as well as for use of the least \n\n\n\nburdensome means to achieving regulatory ends. These Executive Orders \n\ninclude the requirement that, to the extent permitted by law, agencies \n\nshould not proceed with rulemaking in the absence of a reasoned \n\ndetermination that the benefits justify the costs; they establish \n\npublic participation, integration and innovation, flexible approaches, \n\nscientific integrity, and retrospective review as areas of emphasis in \n\nregulation. In particular, Executive Order 13563 explicitly draws \n\nattention to the need to measure and to improve ``the actual results of \n\nregulatory requirements''--a clear reference to the importance of \n\nretrospective evaluation.\n\n Executive Order 13563 addresses new regulations that are under \n\ndevelopment as well as retrospective review of existing regulations \n\nthat are already in place. With respect to agencies' review of existing \n\nregulations, the Executive Order calls for careful reassessment based \n\non empirical analysis. The prospective analysis required by Executive \n\nOrder 13563 may depend on a degree of prediction and speculation about \n\na rule's likely impacts, and the actual costs and benefits of a \n\nregulation may be lower or higher than what was anticipated when the \n\nrule was originally developed.\n\n Executive Order 13610, Identifying and Reducing Regulatory Burdens, \n\nissued in 2012, institutionalizes the retrospective or lookback \n\nmechanism set out in Executive Order 13563 by requiring agencies to \n\nreport to OMB and the public twice each year (January and July) on the \n\nstatus of their retrospective review efforts, to ``describe progress, \n\nanticipated accomplishments, and proposed timelines for relevant \n\nactions.''\n\n Executive Orders 13563 and 13610 recognize that circumstances may \n\nchange in a way that requires reconsideration of regulatory \n\nrequirements. Lookback analysis allows agencies to reevaluate existing \n\nrules and to streamline, modify, or eliminate those regulations that do \n\nnot make sense in their current form. The agencies' lookback efforts so \n\nfar during this Administration have yielded nearly $20 billion in near \n\nterm savings for the\n\n[[Page 76462]]\n\nAmerican public, with significantly more to come.\n\n The Administration is continuing to work with agencies to \n\ninstitutionalize retrospective review so that agencies regularly review \n\nexisting rules on the books to ensure they remain effective, cost-\n\njustified, and based on the best available science. By \n\ninstitutionalizing retrospective review of regulations, the \n\n\n\nAdministration will continue to examine what is working and what is \n\nnot, and eliminate unjustified and outdated regulations.\n\n Regulatory lookback is an ongoing exercise, and continues to be a \n\nhigh priority for the Administration. As part of that prioritization, \n\nthe Administration requires that agencies regularly report about recent \n\nprogress and coming initiatives. In accordance with Executive Order \n\n13610 and Executive Order 13563, in July 2014, agencies submitted to \n\nOIRA the latest updates of their retrospective review plans. Federal \n\nagencies will again update their retrospective review plans this \n\nwinter. We have also asked agencies to continue to emphasize regulatory \n\nlookbacks in their latest Regulatory Plans.\n\n Reflecting that focus, the current agenda lists 83 rules that are \n\ncharacterized as retroactively reviewing existing programs. Below are \n\nsome examples of agency plans to reevaluate current practices, in \n\naccordance with Executive Orders 13563 and 13610:\n\n--The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is working on a \n\nrule to revise the requirements that Long-Term Care facilities must \n\nmeet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These \n\nproposed changes are necessary to reflect the substantial advances that \n\nhave been made over the past several years in the theory and practice \n\nof service delivery and safety. These proposals are also an integral \n\npart of HHS's efforts to achieve broad-based improvements both in the \n\nquality of health care furnished through Federal programs, and in \n\npatient safety, while at the same time reducing procedural burdens on \n\nproviders.\n\n--The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is working on a \n\nfinal rule to streamline the inspection and home warranty requirements \n\nfor Federal Housing Administration (FHA) single family mortgage \n\ninsurance and, in doing so, would increase choice and lower the costs \n\nfor FHA borrowers. First, HUD would remove regulations that require the \n\nuse of an inspector from the FHA Inspector Roster as a condition for \n\nFHA mortgage insurance. This change is based on the recognition of the \n\nsufficiency and quality of inspections carried out by local \n\njurisdictions, and HUD expects the rule will increase competition and \n\nchoice of inspectors among lenders. Second, this rule would also remove \n\nthe regulations requiring homeowners to purchase 10-year protection \n\nplans from FHA-approved warranty issuers in order to qualify for high \n\nloan-to-value FHA-insured mortgages. This change is based on the \n\nincreased quality of construction materials and the standardization of \n\nbuilding codes and building code enforcement, and HUD expects the rule \n\n\n\nwill reduce burden on homeowners that do not want to purchase \n\nwarranties and increase choice for the homeowners that still want to \n\npurchase warranties. In total, HUD estimates up to $29 million in \n\nwarranty expenditures avoided, $100,000 in paperwork burden savings for \n\nthe public, and $50,000 in administrative cost savings for HUD.\n\n--The Department of Labor is working to revise existing Sex \n\nDiscrimination Guidelines, which have not been substantively updated \n\nsince 1973, and to replace them with regulations that align with \n\ncurrent law and legal principles in order to address their application \n\nto current workplace practices and issues.\n\nE.O. 13609: International Regulatory Cooperation\n\n In addition to using regulatory lookback as a tool to make our \n\nregulatory system more efficient, the Administration has been focused \n\non promoting international regulatory cooperation. International \n\nregulatory cooperation supports economic growth, job creation, \n\ninnovation, trade and investment, while also protecting public health, \n\nsafety, and welfare. In May 2012 President Obama issued Executive Order \n\n13609, Promoting International Regulatory Cooperation, which emphasizes \n\nthe importance of these efforts as a key tool for eliminating \n\nunnecessary differences in regulation between the United States and its \n\nmajor trading partners. Additionally, as part of the regulatory \n\nlookback initiative, Executive Order 13609 requires agencies to \n\n``consider reforms to existing significant regulations that address \n\nunnecessary differences in regulatory requirements between the United \n\nStates and its major trading partners . . . when stakeholders provide \n\nadequate information to the agency establishing that the differences \n\nare unnecessary.''\n\n Executive Order 13609 also directed agencies to submit a Regulatory \n\nPlan that includes ``a summary of its international regulatory \n\ncooperation activities that are reasonably anticipated to lead to \n\nsignificant regulations, with an explanation of how these activities \n\nadvance the purposes of Executive Order 13563,'' and Executive Order \n\n13609. Further, Executive Order 13609 requires agencies to ``ensure \n\nthat significant regulations that the agency identifies as having \n\nsignificant international impacts are designated as such'' in the \n\nRegulatory Agenda. In furtherance of this focus on international \n\nregulatory cooperation, this summer, the Administration and Canada \n\nreleased the U.S.-Canada Regulatory Cooperation Council (RCC) Joint \n\nForward Plan.\\1\\ The Forward Plan represents a significant pivot point \n\nfor the Administration's regulatory cooperation relationships with \n\nCanada, and outlines new Federal agency-level partnership arrangements \n\nto help institutionalize the way our regulators work together. The \n\n\n\nForward Plan will help remove duplicative requirements, develop common \n\nstandards, and identify potential areas where future regulation may \n\nunnecessarily differ. This kind of international cooperation on \n\nregulations between the United States and Canada will help eliminate \n\nbarriers to doing business in the United States or with U.S. companies, \n\ngrow the economy, and create jobs. The Forward Plan identifies 24 areas \n\nof cooperation where the United States and Canada will work together to \n\nimplement over the next three to five years in order to modernize our \n\nthinking around international regulatory cooperation and develop a \n\ntoolbox of strategies to address international regulatory issues as \n\nthey arise. We expect that future Agendas will reflect strong evidence \n\nof this partnership.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\1\\ Available at: http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/oira/irc/us-canada-rcc-joint-forward-plan.pdf.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n The Administration continues to foster a regulatory system that \n\nemphasizes that careful consideration of costs and benefits, public \n\nparticipation, integration and innovation, flexible approaches, and \n\nscience. These requirements are meant to produce a regulatory system \n\nthat draws on recent learning, that is driven by evidence, and that is \n\nsuited to the distinctive circumstances of the twenty-first century.\n\n[[Page 76463]]\n\n Department of Agriculture\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulation\n\n Sequence No. Title identifier No. Rulemaking stage\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.............................

This legislation, which was signed into law on February 7, 2014, \n\nprovides authorization for services and programs that impact every \n\nAmerican and millions of people around the world. The new Farm Bill \n\nbuilds on historic economic gains in rural America over the past five \n\nyears, while achieving meaningful reform and billions of dollars in \n\nsavings for the taxpayer. The new Farm Bill will allow USDA to continue \n\nrecord accomplishments on behalf of the American people, while \n\nproviding new opportunity and creating jobs across rural America. It \n\nwill enable USDA to further expand markets for agricultural products at \n\nhome and abroad, strengthen conservation efforts, create new \n\nopportunities for local and regional food systems and grow the biobased \n\neconomy. It will provide a dependable safety net for America's farmers, \n\nranchers and growers. It will maintain important agricultural research \n\nand ensure access to safe and nutritious food for all Americans. USDA's \n\nregulatory efforts in the coming year will modify existing regulations \n\nand introduce new regulatory actions necessary to implement the 2014 \n\nFarm Bill and to achieve the following goals identified in the \n\nDepartment's Strategic Plan for 2010-2015:\n\n Assist rural communities to create prosperity so they are \n\nself-sustaining, re-populating, and economically thriving. USDA is the \n\nleading advocate for rural America. The Department supports rural \n\ncommunities and enhances quality of life for rural residents by \n\nimproving\n\n[[Page 76468]]\n\ntheir economic opportunities, community infrastructure, environmental \n\nhealth, and the sustainability of agricultural production. The common \n\ngoal is to help create thriving rural communities with good jobs where \n\npeople want to live and raise families where children have economic \n\nopportunities and a bright future.\n\n Ensure our national forests and private working lands are \n\nconserved, restored, and made more resilient to climate change, while \n\nenhancing our water resources. America's prosperity is inextricably \n\n\n\nlinked to the health of our lands and natural resources. Forests, \n\nfarms, ranches, and grasslands offer enormous environmental benefits as \n\na source of clean air, clean and abundant water, and wildlife habitat. \n\nThese lands generate economic value by supporting the vital agriculture \n\nand forestry sectors, attracting tourism and recreational visitors, \n\nsustaining green jobs, and producing ecosystem services, food, fiber, \n\ntimber and non-timber products. They are also of immense social \n\nimportance, enhancing rural quality of life, sustaining scenic and \n\nculturally important landscapes, and providing opportunities to engage \n\nin outdoor activity and reconnect with the land.\n\n Help America promote agricultural production and \n\nbiotechnology exports as America works to increase food security. A \n\nproductive agricultural sector is critical to increasing global food \n\nsecurity. For many crops, a substantial portion of domestic production \n\nis bound for overseas markets. USDA helps American farmers and ranchers \n\nuse efficient and sustainable production, biotechnology, and other \n\nemergent technologies to enhance food security around the world and \n\nfind export markets for their products.\n\n Ensure that all of America's children have access to safe, \n\nnutritious, and balanced meals. A plentiful supply of safe and \n\nnutritious food is essential to the well-being of every family and the \n\nhealthy development of every child in America. USDA provides nutrition \n\nassistance to children and low-income people who need it and works to \n\nimprove the healthy eating habits of all Americans, especially \n\nchildren. In addition, the Department safeguards the quality and \n\nwholesomeness of meat, poultry, and processed egg products, and it \n\naddresses and prevents loss or damage from pests and disease outbreaks.\n\n Important regulatory activities supporting the accomplishment of \n\nthese goals in 2015 will include the following:\n\n Strengthening Food Safety Inspection. USDA will continue \n\nto develop science-based regulations that improve the safety of meat, \n\npoultry, and processed egg products in the least burdensome and most \n\ncost-effective manner. Existing regulations will be revised to address \n\nemerging food safety challenges, streamlined to remove excessively \n\nprescriptive requirements, and updated to be made consistent with \n\nHazard Analysis and Critical Control Point principles. Among other \n\nactions, USDA will amend regulations so that information presented on \n\nfood packaging is useful in assisting consumers with purchasing and \n\npreparation decisions. The agency will also use technology to \n\nstreamline and improve the integrity of export certificates. To help \n\nsmall businesses comply with food safety regulatory requirements, FSIS \n\nwill continue its collaboration with other USDA and State partners in \n\n\n\nits small business outreach program.\n\n Improving Access to Nutrition Assistance and Dietary Behaviors. As \n\nchanges are made to the nutrition assistance programs, USDA will work \n\nto ensure access to program benefits, strengthen program integrity, \n\nimprove diets and healthy eating, and promote physical activity \n\nconsistent with the national effort to reduce obesity. In support of \n\nthese activities in 2014, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) plans to \n\npublish a proposed rule updating meal pattern revisions for the Child \n\nand Adult Care Food Program, as well as a proposal to enhance the \n\neligibility standards for SNAP retailers to increase access to more \n\nhealthful foods. FNS will continue to work to implement rules that \n\nminimize participant and vendor fraud in its nutrition assistance \n\nprograms.\n\n Collaborating with Producers to Conserve Natural \n\nResources. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is \n\namending the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) and Environmental \n\nQuality Incentives Program (EQIP) regulations to incorporate \n\nprogrammatic changes as authorized by the Farm Bill. CSP promotes \n\nconsultation at the local level to identify priority resource concerns \n\nin geographic areas within a State. CSP encourages producers to address \n\nenvironmental concerns while improving and conserving the quality and \n\ncondition of natural resources in a comprehensive manner. EQIP provides \n\nassistance to landowners to address natural resource issues that impact \n\nsoil, water and related natural resources, including grazing lands, \n\nwetlands, and wildlife habitat. The Farm Bill folded the former \n\nWildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP) into EQIP.\n\n Promoting Innovation through Partnerships. NRCS has a long \n\nhistory of providing science-based, technically sound, and proven \n\nconservation practices, advice, and alternatives to America's farmers \n\nand ranchers. Traditionally, NRCS has worked with USDA agencies, \n\nuniversities, and other nongovernmental organizations to identify and \n\nrefine new cutting-edge technology through on-farm trials and research. \n\nUsing this approach, NRCS continually reviews and revises conservation \n\npractices based on new research or changes in technology.\n\n Through the Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG) component of EQIP, \n\nNRCS involves additional partners in identifying and demonstrating new \n\napproaches for possible NRCS adoption. CIG's purpose is to stimulate \n\nthe adoption of innovative conservation approaches and technologies in \n\nagricultural production and leverage additional investments in \n\nconservation. Partners assist NRCS with meeting the CIG goals of \n\nidentifying new conservation technologies and practices, conducting \n\n\n\ndemonstrations and field tests, and integrating widely applicable \n\ntechnologies and practices into NRCS' toolkit of practices and \n\nactivities to help agricultural producers better address natural \n\nresource concerns. NRCS is updating the CIG section of the EQIP \n\nregulation to be consistent with Farm Bill amendments.\n\n Protecting Productive Agricultural Lands and Wetlands. The \n\nFarm Bill combined several NRCS easement programs, including the \n\nWetlands Reserve Program (WRP), the Farm and Ranch Lands Protection \n\nProgram (FRPP), and the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP) into the new \n\nAgricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP). ACEP will require \n\nits own regulation to replace those of the repealed WRP, FRPP, and GRP \n\nprograms. ACEP will have two components: an agricultural land easement \n\ncomponent under which NRCS assists eligible entities to protect \n\nagricultural land by limiting non-agricultural land uses and a wetland \n\nreserve easement component under which NRCS provides technical and \n\nfinancial assistance directly to landowners to restore, protect and \n\nenhance wetlands through the purchase of wetlands reserve easements. \n\nNRCS will maintain the existing easements and contracts formed under \n\nthe previous programs; however, they will all be considered part of \n\nACEP enrollment.\n\n Addressing Conservation Concerns on a Regional Level. The \n\nFarm Bill established the Regional Conservation\n\n[[Page 76469]]\n\nPartnership Program (RCPP) to promote the implementation of \n\nconservation activities through providing support for agreements \n\nbetween producers and partner groups. Producers receive technical and \n\nfinancial assistance through RCPP while NRCS and its partners help \n\nproducers install and maintain conservation activities. These projects \n\nmay focus on water quality and quantity, soil erosion, wildlife \n\nhabitat, drought mitigation, flood control, and other regional \n\npriorities. Partners include producer associations, State or local \n\ngovernments, Indian tribes, non-governmental organizations, and \n\ninstitutions of higher education. RCPP projects affect multiple \n\nagricultural or nonindustrial private forest operations on a local, \n\nregional, State, or multistate level. The Farm Bill combined several \n\nregional conservation initiatives into this program. RCPP is \n\nimplemented through an announcement of program funding through \n\nGrants.gov; however, NRCS is publishing updates in the CSP, EQIP and \n\nACEP regulations to indicate that these are covered programs through \n\nwhich RCPP can operate.\n\n Establish Framework for Managing our Nation's Forests and \n\n\n\nGrasslands. The Forest Service will publish proposed guidance for \n\nimplementation of the 2012 Land Management Planning Rule. This guidance \n\nwill provide the detailed monitoring, assessment, and documentation \n\nrequirements that the managers of our national forests and grasslands \n\nrequire to begin revising their land management plans under the 2012 \n\nPlanning Rule. Currently 70 of the 120 Forest Service's Land Management \n\nPlans are expired and in need of revision.\n\n Making Marketing and Regulatory Programs More Focused. The \n\nAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) plans to amend its \n\nveterinary biologics regulations to provide for the use of a simpler, \n\nuniform label format to better meet the needs of veterinary biologics \n\nconsumers. APHIS also plans to revise tuberculosis and brucellosis \n\nregulations to better reflect the distribution of these diseases and \n\nthereby minimize the impacts on livestock producers while continuing to \n\naddress these livestock diseases. In the area of plant health, APHIS \n\nproposes to expand the streamlined method of considering the \n\nimportation and interstate movement of fruits and vegetables. The \n\nAgricultural Marketing Service (AMS) will support the organic sector by \n\nupdating the National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances as \n\nadvised by the National Organic Standards Board, streamlining organic \n\nregulatory enforcement actions, developing organic pet food standards, \n\nand proposing that all existing and replacement dairy animals from \n\nwhich milk or milk products are intended to be sold as organic must be \n\nmanaged organically from the last third of gestation.\n\n Promoting Biobased Products. USDA will continue to promote \n\nsustainable economic opportunities to create jobs in rural communities \n\nthrough the purchase and use of biobased products through the \n\nBioPreferred[supreg] program. USDA will finalize regulations to revise \n\nthe BioPreferred[supreg] program guidelines to continue adding \n\ndesignated product categories to the preferred procurement program, \n\nincluding intermediates and feedstocks and finished products made of \n\nintermediates and feedstocks. The Federal preferred procurement and the \n\ncertified label parts of the program are voluntary; both are designed \n\nto assist biobased businesses in securing additional sales.\n\nRetrospective Review of Existing Regulations\n\n Pursuant to section 6 of Executive Order 13563 ``Improving \n\nRegulation and Regulatory Review (Jan. 18, 2011), the following \n\ninitiatives are identified in the Department's Final Plan for \n\nRetrospective Analysis. The final agency plans, as well as periodic \n\nstatus updates for each initiative, are available online at http://www.whitehouse.gov/21stcenturygov/actions/21st-\ncentury-regulatory-system.\n\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/21stcenturygov/actions/21st-century-regulatory-system\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/21stcenturygov/actions/21st-century-regulatory-system\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Significantly\n\n RIN Title reduce burdens on\n\n small businesses\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0583-AC59................

Accordingly, reducing the \n\nregulatory burden on the American people and our trading partners is a \n\npriority for USDA, and we will continually work to improve the \n\neffectiveness of our existing regulations. As a result of our ongoing \n\nregulatory review and burden reduction efforts, USDA has identified the \n\nfollowing burden-reducing initiatives:\n\n Increase Use of Generic Approval and Regulations \n\nConsolidation. FSIS is finalizing a rule that will expand the \n\ncircumstances in which the labels of meat and poultry products will be \n\ndeemed to be generically approved by FSIS. The rule will reduce \n\nregulatory burdens and generate a discounted Agency cost savings of \n\n$3.3 million over 10 years (discounted at 7 percent).\n\n Implement Electronic Export Application for Meat and \n\n\n\nPoultry Products. FSIS is finalizing a rule to provide exporters a fee-\n\nbased option for transmitting U.S. certifications to foreign importers \n\nand governments electronically. Automating the export application and \n\ncertification process will facilitate the export of U.S. meat, poultry, \n\nand egg products by streamlining the processes that are used while \n\nensuring that foreign regulatory requirements are met.\n\n Streamline Forest Service National Environmental Policy \n\nAct (NEPA) Compliance. The Forest Service, in cooperation with the \n\nCouncil on Environmental Quality, is promulgating rulemaking to \n\nestablish three new Categorical Exclusions for simple restoration \n\nactivities. These Categorical Exclusions will improve and streamline \n\nthe NEPA process and reduce the paperwork burden, as it applies to \n\nForest Service projects without reducing environmental protection.\n\n[[Page 76470]]\n\n Increase Accessibility to the Rural Energy for America \n\nProgram (REAP). Under REAP, Rural Development provides guaranteed loans \n\nand grants to support the purchase, construction, or retrofitting of a \n\nrenewable energy system. This rulemaking will streamline the \n\napplication process for grants, lessening the burden on the applicant. \n\nThe rulemaking is expected to reduce the information collection.\n\n Reduced Duplication in Farm Programs. The Farm and Foreign \n\nAgricultural Services (FFAS) mission area is reducing the paperwork \n\nburden on program participants by consolidating the information \n\ncollections required to participate in farm programs administered by \n\nthe Farm Service Agency (FSA) and the Federal crop insurance program \n\nadministered by the Risk Management Agency (RMA). As a result, \n\nproducers will be able to spend less time reporting information to \n\nUSDA. Additionally, FSA and RMA will be better able to share \n\ninformation, thus improving operational efficiency. FFAS is simplifying \n\nand standardizing, to the extent practical, acreage reporting \n\nprocesses, program dates, and data definitions across the various USDA \n\nprograms and agencies. FFAS is making improvements to allow producers \n\nto use information from their farm-management and precision agriculture \n\nsystems for reporting production, planted and harvested acreage, and \n\nother key information needed to participate in USDA programs. FFAS is \n\nalso streamlining the collection of producer information by FSA and RMA \n\nwith the agricultural production information collected by the National \n\nAgricultural Statistics Service. These process changes allow for \n\nprogram data that is common across agencies to be collected once and \n\nutilized or redistributed to agency programs in which the producer \n\nchooses to participate. FFAS will conduct a pilot project in spring \n\n2015 to test the ability of FSA county offices to receive electronic \n\n\n\nacreage reports through a third-party service provider; the pilot will \n\nadd additional States following the 2014 small ``proof-of-concept'' in \n\nIllinois.\n\n Periodic status updates for these burden-reducing initiatives can \n\nbe found online at: http://www.whitehouse.gov/21stcenturygov/actions/21st-century-regulatory-system.\n\n In addition to regulatory review initiatives identified under \n\nExecutive Order 13563 and the paper work burden reduction initiatives \n\nidentified under the Executive Order 13610, USDA has plans to initiate \n\nthe following additional streamlining initiatives in 2015.\n\n Simplify FSA NEPA Compliance. FSA proposed revisions to \n\nits regulations that implement NEPA to update, improve, and clarify \n\nrequirements. It also proposed new categorical exclusions and removing \n\nobsolete provisions. FSA will revise the regulations with any \n\nadditional improvements being made based on public comments to the \n\nproposed rule. Annual cost savings to FSA as a result of this rule \n\ncould be $345,000 from conducting 314 fewer environmental assessments \n\nper year, while retaining strong environmental protection.\n\n Simplify Equipment Contracts for Rural Utilities Service \n\n(RUS) Loans. RUS is proposing a rule that would result in a new \n\nstandard Equipment Contract Form for use by Telecommunications Program \n\nborrowers. This new standardized contract would ensure that certain \n\nstandards and specifications are met, and this new form would replace \n\nthe current process that requires all construction providers to use \n\ntheir own resources to develop a contract for each project.\n\n Consolidate Community Facilities Programs Loan and Grant \n\nRequirements. The Rural Housing Service (RHS) is proposing to \n\nconsolidate seven of the regulations used to service Community \n\nFacilities direct loans and grants into one streamlined regulation. \n\nThis rule will reduce the time burden on RHS staff and provide the \n\npublic with a single document that clearly outlines the requirements \n\nfor servicing Community Facilities direct loans and grants.\n\n Update Tuberculosis and Brucellosis Programs. Given the \n\nsuccess USDA has had in nearly eradicating tuberculosis and brucellosis \n\nin ruminants, APHIS will propose rulemaking to update and consolidate \n\nits regulations regarding these diseases to better reflect the current \n\ndistribution of these diseases and the changes in which cattle, bison, \n\nand captive cervid are produced in the United States.\n\nPromoting International Regulatory Cooperation Under Executive Order \n\n13609:\n\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/21stcenturygov/actions/21st-century-regulatory-system\n\n\n President Obama issued Executive Order 13609 on promoting \n\ninternational regulatory cooperation in May 2012. The Executive order \n\ncharges the Regulatory Working Group, an interagency working group \n\nchaired by the Administrator of Office of Information and Regulatory \n\nAffairs (OIRA), with examining appropriate strategies and best \n\npractices for international regulatory cooperation. The Executive order \n\nalso directs agencies to identify factors that should be taken into \n\naccount in evaluating the effectiveness of regulatory approaches used \n\nby trading partners with whom the U.S. is engaged in regulatory \n\ncooperation. At this time, USDA is identifying international regulatory \n\ncooperation activities that are reasonably anticipated to lead to \n\nsignificant regulations, while working closely with the Administration \n\nto refine the guidelines implementing the Executive order. Apart from \n\ninternational regulatory cooperation, the Department has continued to \n\nidentify regulations with international impacts, as it has done in the \n\npast. Such regulations are those that are expected to have \n\ninternational trade and investment effects or otherwise may be of \n\ninterest to our international trading partners.\n\n USDA is diligently working to carry out the President's Executive \n\norder mandate with regard to regulatory cooperation as new regulations \n\nare developed. Several agencies within the Department are also actively \n\nengaged in interagency and Departmental regulatory cooperation \n\ninitiatives being pursued as part of the U.S.-Mexico High Level \n\nRegulatory Cooperation Council (HLRCC) and the U.S.-Canada Regulatory \n\nCooperation Council (RCC), as well as other fora. Specific projects are \n\nbeing pursued by USDA agencies such as AMS, APHIS, and FSIS and address \n\na variety of regulatory oversight processes and requirements related to \n\nmeat, poultry, and animal and plant health. Projects related to \n\nelectronic certification, equivalence, meat nomenclature, and the \n\nefficient and safe flow of plants, animals and food across our shared \n\nborders are all regulatory cooperation pursuits these agencies are \n\nundertaking in order to secure better alignment among our countries \n\nwithout compromising the high standards of safety we have in place in \n\nthe U.S. relative to food safety and public health, as well as plant \n\nand animal health, that are so critical to American agriculture.\n\nMajor Regulatory Priorities\n\n This following represents summary information on prospective \n\npriority regulations as called for in Executive Orders 12866 and 13563:\n\nFood and Nutrition Service\n\n Mission: FNS works to end hunger and obesity through the \n\nadministration of federal nutrition assistance programs including WIC, \n\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and school meals.\n\n\n\n[[Page 76471]]\n\n Priorities: In addition to responding to provisions of legislation \n\nauthorizing and modifying Federal nutrition assistance programs, FNS's \n\n2015 regulatory plan supports USDA's Strategic Goal to ``ensure that \n\nall of America's children have access to safe, nutritious and balanced \n\nmeals'' and its related objectives:\n\n Increase Access to Nutritious Food. This objective \n\nrepresents FNS's efforts to improve nutrition by providing access to \n\nprogram benefits (food consumed at home, school meals, commodities) and \n\ndistributing State administrative funds to support program operations. \n\nTo advance this objective, FNS plans to publish a final rule \n\nimplementing the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010's Community \n\nEligibility Provision, which eliminates the burden of household \n\napplications and increases access to free school lunches and breakfasts \n\nfor children in eligible high-poverty schools. FNS will also publish a \n\nproposed rule to codify procedures for providing temporary SNAP \n\nbenefits during emergencies for victims of disasters.\n\n Improve Program Integrity. FNS also plans to publish a \n\nnumber of rules to increase efficiency, reduce the burden of program \n\noperations, and further reduce improper payments. Program integrity \n\nprovisions will continue to be strengthened in the SNAP and Child \n\nNutrition programs to ensure Federal taxpayer dollars are spent \n\neffectively. To support this objective, FNS plans to publish a final \n\nrule from the 2008 Farm Bill that increases the penalty for SNAP \n\nauthorized stores that are involved in the trafficking of Program \n\nbenefits. Additionally, FNS plans to publish a proposed rule to \n\nestablish consistent, outcome-focused performance measures for the SNAP \n\nEmployment and Training Program. For Child Nutrition, FNS plans to \n\npublish a proposed rule to strengthen oversight requirements and \n\ninstitution disqualification procedures, allow the imposition of fines \n\nby USDA or State agencies for egregious and/or repeated program \n\nviolations, and address several deficiencies identified through program \n\naudits and reviews.\n\n Promote Healthy Diet and Physical Activity Behaviors. This \n\nobjective represents FNS's efforts to ensure that program benefits meet \n\nappropriate standards to effectively improve nutrition for program \n\nparticipants, to improve the diets of its clients through nutrition \n\neducation, and to support the national effort to reduce obesity by \n\n\n\npromoting healthy eating and physical activity. To implement provisions \n\nincluded in the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010. FNS plans to \n\npublish a proposed rule that updates the meal patterns for the Child \n\nand Adult Care Food Program to align them with the latest Dietary \n\nGuidelines for Americans and final rules that establish professional \n\nstandards for school food service and State child nutrition program \n\ndirectors, require schools to develop local wellness policies that \n\npromote the health of students and address the growing problem of \n\nchildhood obesity. Additionally, FNS plans to publish a proposed rule \n\nto implement the 2014 Farm Bill governing the eligibility of retail \n\nfood stores participating in SNAP that will improve SNAP participants' \n\naccess to healthy food options.\n\nFood Safety and Inspection Service\n\n Mission: FSIS is responsible for ensuring that meat, poultry, and \n\nprocessed egg products in interstate and foreign commerce are \n\nwholesome, not adulterated, and are properly marked, labeled, and \n\npackaged.\n\n Priorities: FSIS is committed to developing and issuing science-\n\nbased regulations intended to ensure that meat, poultry, and processed \n\negg products are wholesome and not adulterated or misbranded. FSIS \n\nregulatory actions support the objective to protect public health by \n\nensuring that food is safe under USDA's goal to ensure access to safe \n\nfood. To reduce the number of foodborne illnesses and increase program \n\nefficiencies, FSIS will continue to review its existing authorities and \n\nregulations to ensure that it can address emerging food safety \n\nchallenges, to streamline excessively prescriptive regulations, and to \n\nrevise or remove regulations that are inconsistent with the FSIS's \n\nHazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulations. FSIS is \n\nalso working with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to improve \n\ncoordination and increase the effectiveness of inspection activities. \n\nFSIS's priority initiatives are as follows:\n\n Implement Inspection of Certain Fish, Including Catfish \n\nand Catfish Products. FSIS plans to issue a final rule to implement a \n\nnew inspection system for all fish of the order Siluriformes, as \n\nrequired by the 2014 Farm Bill. The rule will define inspection \n\nrequirements for this type of fish and will take into account the \n\nconditions under which the fish is raised and transported to a \n\nprocessing establishment.\n\n Streamline Export Application Processes through the Public \n\nHealth Information System (PHIS). To support its food safety inspection \n\nactivities, FSIS is continuing to implement PHIS, a user-friendly and \n\n\n\nWeb-based system that automates many of the Agency's business \n\nprocesses. PHIS also enables greater exchange of information between \n\nFSIS and other Federal agencies, such as U.S. Customs and Border \n\nProtection, which is involved alongside FSIS in tracking cross-border \n\nmovement of import and export shipments of meat, poultry, and processed \n\negg products. To facilitate the implementation of some PHIS components, \n\nFSIS is finalizing regulations to provide for electronic export \n\napplication and certification processes.\n\n Update Nutrition Facts Panels for Meat and Poultry \n\nProducts. FSIS will propose to amend its regulations so that the \n\nnutrition labeling requirements for meat and poultry products reflect \n\nrecent scientific research and dietary recommendations and to improve \n\nthe presentation of nutrition information to assist consumers in \n\nmaintaining healthy dietary practices. These revisions will be \n\nconsistent with the recent changes that the Food and Drug \n\nAdministration proposed for conventional foods and will ensure that \n\nthere is consistency in how nutrition information is presented across \n\nthe food supply.\n\n Ensure Accurate Labeling of Mechanically Tenderized Beef. \n\nFSIS has concluded that without proper labeling, raw or partially \n\ncooked mechanically tenderized beef products could be mistakenly \n\nperceived by consumers to be whole, intact muscle cuts. The fact that a \n\ncut of beef has been needle or blade-tenderized is a characterizing \n\nfeature of the product and, as such, is a material fact likely to \n\naffect consumers' purchase decisions and should affect their \n\npreparation of the product. FSIS has also concluded that the addition \n\nof validated cooking instruction is required to ensure that potential \n\npathogens throughout the product are destroyed. Without thorough \n\ncooking, pathogens that may have been introduced to the interior of the \n\nproduct during the tenderization process may remain in the product. The \n\nAgency will finalize regulations requiring that raw, mechanically \n\ntenderized (needle or blade) beef products be labeled to indicate that \n\nthey are ``mechanically tenderized.''\n\n Improve the Efficiency of Product Recalls. FSIS is \n\ndeveloping a final rule that will amend recordkeeping regulations to \n\nspecify that all official establishments and retail stores that grind \n\nor chop raw beef products for sale in commerce must keep records that \n\ndisclose the identity of the supplier of all source materials that they \n\nuse in the preparation of each lot of raw ground or chopped product and \n\nidentify the names of those source materials. FSIS\n\n[[Page 76472]]\n\n\n\ninvestigators and public health officials frequently use records kept \n\nby all levels of the food distribution chain, including the retail \n\nlevel, to identify and trace back product that is the source of the \n\nillness to the suppliers that produced the source material for the \n\nproduct. Access to this information will improve FSIS's ability to \n\nconduct timely and effective consumer foodborne illness investigations \n\nand other public health activities throughout the stream of commerce.\n\n Improve Compliance with the Humane Methods of Slaughter \n\nAct. FSIS has concluded that prohibiting the slaughter of all non-\n\nambulatory disabled veal calves will improve compliance with the Humane \n\nMethods of Slaughter Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) and will also \n\nimprove the Agency's inspection efficiency by eliminating the time that \n\nFSIS inspection program personnel spend re-inspecting non-ambulatory \n\ndisabled veal calves. FSIS plans to propose to amend its regulations on \n\nante-mortem inspection to remove a provision that permits \n\nestablishments to set apart and hold for treatment veal calves that are \n\nunable to rise from a recumbent position and walk because they are \n\ntired or cold (9 CFR 309.13(b)). Under the proposed rule, non-\n\nambulatory disabled veal calves that are offered for slaughter will be \n\ncondemned and promptly euthanized.\n\n FSIS Small Business Implications. The great majority of \n\nbusinesses regulated by FSIS are small businesses. FSIS conducts a \n\nsmall business outreach program that provides critical training, access \n\nto food safety experts, and information resources, such as compliance \n\nguidance and questions and answers on various topics, in forms that are \n\nuniform, easily comprehended, and consistent. FSIS collaborates in this \n\neffort with other USDA agencies and cooperating State partners. For \n\nexample, FSIS makes plant owners and operators aware of loan programs \n\navailable through USDA's Rural Business and Cooperative programs to \n\nhelp them in upgrading their facilities. FSIS employees will meet with \n\nsmall and very small plant operators to learn more about their specific \n\nneeds and explore how FSIS can tailor regulations to better meet the \n\nneeds of small and very small establishments, while maintaining the \n\nhighest level of food safety.\n\nAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service\n\n Mission: A major part of the mission of APHIS is to protect the \n\nhealth and value of American agricultural and natural resources. APHIS \n\nconducts programs to prevent the introduction of exotic pests and \n\ndiseases into the United States and conducts surveillance, monitoring, \n\ncontrol, and eradication programs for pests and diseases in this \n\ncountry. These activities enhance agricultural productivity and \n\ncompetitiveness and contribute to the national economy and the public \n\n\n\nhealth. APHIS also conducts programs to ensure the humane handling, \n\ncare, treatment, and transportation of animals under the Animal Welfare \n\nAct.\n\n Priorities: APHIS continues to pursue initiatives to update its \n\nregulations to make them more flexible and performance-based. For \n\nexample, in the area of animal health, APHIS is preparing a final rule \n\nto amend its veterinary biologics regulations to provide for the use of \n\na simpler, uniform label format that would allow biologics licensees \n\nand permittees to more clearly communicate product performance \n\ninformation to the end user. In addition, the rule would simplify the \n\nevaluation of efficacy studies and reduce the amount of time required \n\nby APHIS to evaluate study data, thus allowing manufacturers to market \n\ntheir products sooner. APHIS has also prepared a proposed rule that \n\nwould revise and consolidate its regulations regarding bovine \n\ntuberculosis and brucellosis to better reflect the distribution of \n\nthese diseases and the current nature of cattle, bison, and captive \n\ncervid production in the United States. In the area of plant health, \n\nAPHIS has prepared a proposed rule that would establish performance \n\nstandards and a notice-based process for approving the interstate \n\nmovement of fruits and vegetables from Hawaii and the U.S. Territories \n\nand the importation of those articles from other countries. In \n\naddition, APHIS will revise agricultural quarantine and inspection user \n\nfees so that fees collected are commensurate with the cost of providing \n\nthe activity.\n\nAgricultural Marketing Service\n\n Mission: AMS's mission is to facilitate the competitive and \n\nefficient marketing of agricultural products. AMS provides marketing \n\nservices to producers, manufacturers, distributors, importers, \n\nexporters, and consumers of food products. AMS also manages the \n\ngovernment's food purchases, supervises food quality grading, maintains \n\nfood quality standards, supervises the Federal research and promotion \n\nprograms, and oversees the country of origin labeling program as well \n\nas the National Organic Program (NOP).\n\n Priorities: AMS intends to support the government's initiative to \n\nstreamline regulatory actions by establishing a process to communicate \n\nfees for our voluntary user fee programs annually through publication \n\nof a Federal Register notice. AMS is also committed to ensuring the \n\nintegrity of USDA organic products in the U.S. and throughout the \n\nworld. In addition to its ongoing work to develop organic pet food, \n\napiculture, and aquaculture standards, the Agency is moving forward \n\n\n\nwith the following priority rulemakings that affect the organic \n\nindustry:\n\n Research and Promotion Programs Organic Exemption. USDA \n\nintends to implement the 2014 Farm Bill provision to expand the organic \n\nexemption for research and promotion program assessments. This action \n\nwould exempt organic operations with ``100 percent organic'' and \n\n``organic'' products, including certain split operations, from paying \n\nresearch and promotion program assessments.\n\n Transitioning Dairy Animals into Organic Production. \n\nMembers of the organic community, including dairy producers, organic \n\ninterest groups, and the National Organic Standards Board have \n\nadvocated for rulemaking on the allowance for transitioning dairy \n\nanimals into organic production. Stakeholders have interpreted the \n\ncurrent standard differently, creating inconsistencies across dairy \n\nproducers. AMS has submitted a proposed rule for clearance on this \n\nissue. This proposed change to the organic standards is intended to \n\nlevel the playing field for organic dairy producers.\n\nFarm Service Agency\n\n Mission: FSA's mission is to deliver timely, effective programs and \n\nservices to America's farmers and ranchers to support them in \n\nsustaining our Nation's vibrant agricultural economy, as well as to \n\nprovide first-rate support for domestic and international food aid \n\nefforts. FSA has successfully expedited the implementation of several \n\nmajor regulatory priorities resulting from the 2014 Farm Bill, \n\nincluding new programs such as the Agriculture Risk Coverage Program, \n\nPrice Loss Coverage Program, Margin Protection Program for Dairy, Dairy \n\nProduct Donation Program, Cotton Transition Assistance Program, and \n\nimprovements to existing programs such as disaster assistance programs, \n\nentity eligibility for Farm Loan Programs, and Microloans. FSA supports \n\nUSDA's strategic goals by stabilizing farm income, providing credit to \n\nnew or existing farmers and ranchers who are temporarily unable to \n\nobtain credit from commercial sources, and helping farm operations \n\nrecover from the effects of disaster. FSA administers several \n\nconservation programs directed toward\n\n[[Page 76473]]\n\nagricultural producers. The largest program is the Conservation Reserve \n\nProgram, which protects up to 32 million acres of environmentally \n\nsensitive land.\n\n Priorities: FSA is focused on continuing to implement the 2014 Farm \n\nBill while providing the best possible service to producers while \n\n\n\nprotecting the environment by updating and streamlining environmental \n\ncompliance. FSA's priority initiatives are as follows:\n\n Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP). FSA \n\nwill revise its NAP regulations to implement the 2014 Farm Bill \n\nchanges. The 2014 Farm Bill changes include enhanced protection under \n\nNAP, which is also known as NAP buy-up to allow producers to buy \n\nadditional NAP coverage for an additional premium; revised NAP \n\neligibility requirements for coverage on tilled native sod; added \n\ncoverage for sweet sorghum and biomass sorghum; service fee waivers for \n\nbeginning and socially disadvantaged farmers.\n\n Conservation Compliance. FSA, working in coordination with \n\nNRCS and RMA, will revise the USDA conservation compliance regulations \n\nto implement the 2014 Farm Bill changes. The 2014 Farm Bill changes \n\nlinking eligibility for any premium subsidy paid by FCIC on a policy or \n\nplan of federally reinsured crop insurance to be in compliance with \n\nHighly Erodible Land Conservation and Wetlands Conservation provisions. \n\nSince enactment of the 1985 Farm Bill, eligibility for most commodity, \n\ndisaster, and conservation programs has been linked to compliance with \n\nthe Highly Erodible Land Conservation and Wetland Conservation \n\nprovisions. The 2014 Farm Bill continues the requirement that producers \n\nadhere to conservation compliance guidelines to be eligible for most \n\nprograms administered by FSA and NRCS.\n\n Marketing Assistance Loans (MAL) and Loan Deficiency \n\nPayments (LDP). FSA will revise its MAL and LDP regulations to \n\nimplement the 2014 Farm Bill changes. The 2014 Farm Bill changes \n\nreauthorize MAL and LDP for all eligible commodities including cotton, \n\nhoney, and sugar loans, for the 2014 through 2018 crop years. The MAL \n\nand LDP Programs allow producers to receive short-term loans against \n\ntheir crops so that producers can market their crops at a time that is \n\nconvenient for them, rather than being forced to sell immediately after \n\nharvest to pay the bills. The MAL and LDP programs are continued with \n\nno changes to the loan rates except for cotton, and there are no other \n\nchanges to the basic structure of the programs. The changes extend the \n\nprogram years and add clarity to the regulations. MALs, LDPs and sugar \n\nloans are Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) programs administered by \n\nthe Farm Service Agency (FSA).\n\n Farm Loan Programs (FLP) changes. FSA will revise its FLP \n\nregulations to implement the 2014 Farm Bill changes. The 2014 Farm Bill \n\nchanges include expanding lending opportunities for thousands of \n\nfarmers and ranchers to begin and continue operations, including \n\ngreater flexibility in determining eligibility, raising loan limits, \n\nand emphasizing beginning and socially disadvantaged producers. \n\n\n\nSpecific changes include: Eliminating loan term limits for guaranteed \n\noperating loans, modifying the definition of beginning farmers, \n\nallowing debt forgiveness on youth loans, increasing the guaranteed \n\namount on conservation loans from 75 to 80 percent and 90 percent for \n\nbeginning farmers and socially disadvantaged producers, changing the \n\ninterest rate on Direct Farm Ownership loans that are made in \n\nconjunction with other lenders, and increasing the maximum loan amount \n\nfor the down payment loan program from $225,000 to $300,000.\n\n Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP). FSA will revise \n\nits BCAP regulations to implement the 2014 Farm Bill changes. The 2014 \n\nFarm Bill changes include extending BCAP through 2018 and revising BCAP \n\nto add some new payment amounts and eligibility restrictions. Specific \n\nchanges include: revising eligible materials to remove bagasse, add \n\nmaterials used for research material, and require that all woody \n\nbiomass be harvested directly from the land and reducing the payment \n\nfor collection, harvest, storage, and transportation matching payments \n\nto $20 per dry ton. BCAP provides financial assistance to producers who \n\nestablish and harvest biomass crops and requires at least 10 percent of \n\npayments to be matching payments.\n\n Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). FSA will revise its \n\nCRP regulations to implement the 2014 Farm Bill changes. The 2014 Farm \n\nBill changes include extending the authority to enroll acreage in CRP \n\nthrough September 30, 2018, and requiring enrollment to be no more than \n\n24 million acres beginning October 1, 2016. There are 25.6 million \n\nacres enrolled in CRP, of which 2 million expired on September 30, \n\n2014.\n\n Streamline Environmental Compliance (NEPA). FSA will \n\nrevise its regulations that implement NEPA. The changes improve the \n\nefficiency, transparency, and consistency of NEPA implementation. \n\nChanges include aligning the regulations to NEPA regulations and \n\nguidance from the President's Council on Environmental Quality, \n\nproviding a single set of regulations that reflect the Agency's current \n\nstructure, clarifying the types of actions that require an \n\nEnvironmental Assessment (EA), and adding to the list of actions that \n\nare categorically excluded from further environmental review because \n\nthey have no significant effect on the human environment. FSA will \n\ndevelop any additional changes resulting from public comments to the \n\nproposed rule.\n\nForest Service\n\n Mission: FS's mission is to sustain the health, productivity, and \n\ndiversity of the Nation's forests and rangelands to meet the needs of \n\npresent and future generations. This includes protecting and managing \n\n\n\nNational Forest System lands; providing technical and financial \n\nassistance to States, communities, and private forest landowners, plus \n\ndeveloping and providing scientific and technical assistance; and the \n\nexchange of scientific information to support international forest and \n\nrange conservation. FS regulatory priorities support the Department's \n\ngoal to ensure our National forests are conserved, restored, and made \n\nmore resilient to climate change, while enhancing our water resources.\n\n Priorities: FS is committed to developing and issuing science-based \n\nregulations intended to ensure public participation in the management \n\nof our Nation's national forests and grasslands, while also moving \n\nforward the Agency's ability to plan and conduct restoration projects \n\non National Forest System lands. FS will continue to review its \n\nexisting authorities and regulations to ensure that it can address \n\nemerging challenges, to streamline excessively burdensome business \n\npractices, and to revise or remove regulations that are inconsistent \n\nwith the USDA's vision for restoring the health and function of the \n\nlands it is charged with managing. FS's priority initiatives are as \n\nfollows:\n\n Implement Land Management Planning Framework. The Forest \n\nService promulgated a new Land Management Planning Rule at 36 CFR part \n\n219 in April 2012 that sets out the requirements for developing, \n\namending, and revising land management plans for units of the National \n\nForest System. The planning directives, once finalized, will be used to \n\nimplement the planning framework which fosters collaboration with the \n\npublic during land management planning, is science-based and responsive \n\nto change and promotes\n\n[[Page 76474]]\n\nsocial, economic, and ecological sustainability.\n\n Strengthen Ecological Restoration Policies. This policy \n\nwould recognize the adaptive capacity of ecosystems and includes the \n\nrole of natural disturbances and uncertainty related to climate and \n\nother environmental change. The need for ecological restoration of \n\nNational Forest System lands is widely recognized, and the Forest \n\nService has conducted restoration-related activities across many \n\nprograms for decades. ``Restoration'' is a common way of describing \n\nmuch of the Agency's work, and the concept is threaded throughout \n\nexisting authorities, program directives, and collaborative efforts \n\nsuch as the National Fire Plan, a 10-Year comprehensive strategy and \n\nimplementation plan, and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act. However, \n\nthe Agency did not have a definition of ``restoration'' established in \n\npolicy. The lack of a definition was identified as a barrier to \n\n\n\ncollaborating with the public and partners to plan and accomplish \n\nrestoration work.\n\nRural Development\n\n Mission: Rural Development (RD) promotes a dynamic business \n\nenvironment in rural America that creates jobs, community \n\ninfrastructure, and housing opportunities in partnership with the \n\nprivate sector and community-based organizations by providing financial \n\nassistance and business planning services and supporting projects that \n\ncreate or preserve quality jobs, advance energy efficiency and the \n\nbioeconomy, and strengthen local and regional food systems while \n\nfocusing on the development of single- and multi-family housing and \n\ncommunity infrastructure. RD financial resources are often leveraged \n\nwith those of other public and private credit source lenders to meet \n\nbusiness and credit needs in under-served areas. Recipients of these \n\nprograms may include individuals, corporations, partnerships, \n\ncooperatives, public bodies, nonprofit corporations, Indian tribes, and \n\nprivate companies.\n\n Priorities: RD regulatory priorities will facilitate sustainable \n\nrenewable energy development and enhance the opportunities necessary \n\nfor rural families to thrive economically. RD's rules will minimize \n\nprogram complexity and the related burden on the public while enhancing \n\nprogram delivery and Rural Business-Cooperative Service oversight.\n\n Increase Accessibility to the Rural Energy for America \n\nProgram (REAP). Under REAP, Rural Development provides guaranteed loans \n\nand grants to support the purchase, construction, or retrofitting of a \n\nrenewable energy system. This rulemaking will streamline the \n\napplication process for grants, lessening the burden to the customer. \n\nThe rulemaking is expected to reduce the information collection. REAP \n\nwill also be revised to ensure a larger number of applicants will be \n\nmade available through the issuing of smaller grants. As a result, \n\nfunding will be distributed evenly across the applicant pool and \n\nencourage greater development of renewable energy.\n\n Broadband Access Loans. Increasing access to broadband \n\nservice is a critical factor in improving the quality of life in rural \n\nAmerica and in providing the foundation needed for creating jobs. The A \n\n2014 Farm Bill revises program provisions particularly with regard to \n\nbroadband speed and application priority. Revised regulations for the \n\nBroadband Access Loan Program are anticipated to be published in the \n\nFederal Register in the spring of 2015.\n\n Modify review of Single Family Housing Direct Loans. RD \n\nwill publish the certified loan packager regulation to streamline \n\n\n\noversight of the agency's vast network of committed Agency-certified \n\npackagers. This action will help low- and very low-income people become \n\nhomeowners. It will also reduce the burden on program staff, enabling \n\nthem to focus on implementation and delivery, and will ensure \n\nspecialized support is available to them to complete the application \n\nfor assistance, improving the quality of loan application packages.\n\nDepartmental Management\n\n Mission: Departmental Management's mission is to provide management \n\nleadership to ensure that USDA administrative programs, policies, \n\nadvice and counsel meet the needs of USDA programs, consistent with \n\nlaws and mandates, and provide safe and efficient facilities and \n\nservices to customers.\n\nPriorities:\n\n Promote Biobased Products: In support of the Department's \n\ngoal to increase prosperity in rural areas, USDA's Departmental \n\nManagement plans to publish regulations to implement the requirement in \n\nthe Agricultural Act of 2014 (Farm Bill) to establish eligibility \n\ncriteria for forest and other traditional biobased products in the \n\nBioPreferred[supreg] program.\n\nAggregate Costs and Benefits\n\n USDA will ensure that its regulations provide benefits that exceed \n\ncosts, but are unable to provide an estimate of the aggregated impacts \n\nof its regulations. Problems with aggregation arise due to differing \n\nbaselines, data gaps, and inconsistencies in methodology and the type \n\nof regulatory costs and benefits considered. Some benefits and costs \n\nassociated with rules listed in the regulatory plan cannot currently be \n\nquantified as the rules are still being formulated. For 2015, USDA's \n\nfocus will be to implement the changes to programs in such a way as to \n\nprovide benefits while minimizing program complexity and regulatory \n\nburden for program participants.\n\nUSDA--Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS)\n\nProposed Rule Stage\n\n1. National Organic Program, Origin of Livestock, NOP-11-0009\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 7 U.S.C. 6501\n\n CFR Citation: 7 CFR 205.\n\n Legal Deadline: NPRM, Statutory, December 31, 2014.\n\n The proposed action would eliminate the two-track system and \n\n\n\nrequire that upon transition, all existing and replacement dairy \n\nanimals from which milk or milk products are intended to be sold, \n\nlabeled, or represented as organic, must be managed organically from \n\nthe last third of gestation.\n\n Abstract: The current regulations provide two tracks for replacing \n\ndairy animals which are tied to how dairy farmers transition to organic \n\nproduction. Farmers who transition an entire distinct herd must \n\nthereafter replace dairy animals with livestock that has been under \n\norganic management from the last third of gestation. Farmers who do not \n\ntransition an entire distinct herd may perpetually obtain replacement \n\nanimals that have been managed organically for 12 months prior to \n\nmarketing milk or milk products as organic. The proposed action would \n\neliminate the two-track system and require that upon transition, all \n\nexisting and replacement dairy animals from which milk or milk products \n\nare intended to be sold, labeled, or represented as organic must be \n\nmanaged organically from the last third of gestation.\n\n Statement of Need: This action is being taken because of concerns \n\nraised by various parties, including the National Organic Standards \n\nBoard (NOSB), about the dual tracks for dairy replacement animals. The \n\nproposed action would institute the same requirements across all \n\nproducers.\n\n[[Page 76475]]\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The National Organic Program regulations \n\nstipulate the requirements for dairy replacement animals in section \n\n205.236(a)(2) Origin of Livestock. In addition, in response to the \n\nfinal ruling in the 2005 case, Harvey v. Johanns, the USDA committed to \n\nrulemaking to address the concerns about dairy replacement animals.\n\n Alternatives: The program considered initiating the rulemaking with \n\nan ANPRM. It was determined that there is sufficient awareness of the \n\nexpectations of the organic community to proceed with a proposed rule. \n\nAs alternatives, we considered the status quo, however, this would \n\ncontinue the disparity between producers who can continually transition \n\nconventional dairy animals into organic production and producers who \n\nsource dairy animals that are organic from the last third of gestation. \n\nWe also considered an action that would restrict the source of breeder \n\nstock and movement of breeder stock after they are brought onto an \n\norganic operation; however, this would minimize the flexibility of \n\nproducers to purchase breeder stock from any source as specified under \n\nthe Organic Foods Production Act.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits:\n\n Risks: Continuation of the two-track system jeopardizes the \n\n\n\nviability of the market for organic heifers. A potential risk \n\nassociated with the rulemaking would be a temporary supply shortage of \n\ndairy replacement animals due to the increased demand.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 12/00/14 .......................\n\nFinal Action........................ 05/00/16 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Organizations.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Agency Contact: Melissa R.

National Organic Program, Organic Pet Food Standards\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 7 U.S.C. 6501.\n\n CFR Citation: 7 CFR 205.\n\n Legal Deadline: NPRM, Statutory, April 30, 2015.\n\n The National Organic Program (NOP) is establishing national \n\nstandards governing the marketing of organically produced agricultural \n\nproducts.\n\n Abstract: The National Organic Program (NOP) is establishing \n\nnational standards governing the marketing of organically produced \n\nagricultural products. In 2004, the National Organic Standards Board \n\n(NOSB) initiated the development of organic pet food standards, which \n\nhad not been incorporated into the NOP regulations, by forming a task \n\nforce which included pet food manufacturers, organic consultants, etc. \n\nCollectively, these experts drafted organic pet food standards \n\nconsistent with the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990, Food and Drug \n\nAdministration requirements, and the Association of American Feed \n\nControl Officials (AAFCO) Model Regulations for Pet and Specialty Pet \n\nFood. The AAFCO regulations are scientifically based regulations for \n\nvoluntary adoption by State jurisdictions to ensure the safety, \n\nmailto:melissa.bailey@usda.gov\n\n\nquality, and effectiveness of feed. In November 2008, the NOSB approved \n\na final recommendation for organic pet food standards incorporating the \n\nprovisions drafted by the pet food task force.\n\n Statement of Need: This action is necessary to ensure consistency \n\nin the composition and labeling of pet food products bearing organic \n\nclaims. While the NOP has maintained that pet food may be certified in \n\naccordance with the existing USDA organic regulations, the requirements \n\nfor processed products are intended for human foods and are not \n\nentirely applicable to pet food. The uncertainty about pet food \n\ncomposition and labeling requirements causes confusion in the \n\nmarketplace with potentially negative impacts for the credibility of \n\nthe organic label in general. This action responds to a 2008 \n\nrecommendation of the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) and \n\nindustry requests for organic pet food standards.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 \n\n(OFPA) authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to establish an organic \n\ncertification program for producers and handlers of agricultural \n\nproducts that have been produced using organic methods (7 U.S.C. \n\n6503(a)). The OFPA also authorizes the NOSB to provide recommendations \n\nto the Secretary regarding the implementation of the National Organic \n\nProgram (7 U.S.C. 6518(k)(1)).\n\n Alternatives: AMS has considered the implications of developing \n\nspecific composition and labeling standards for organic pet food versus \n\nmaintaining the status quo and not pursuing regulatory action. In \n\naddition, AMS is examining options regarding potential implementation \n\nperiods. Finally, AMS considered the viability of composition \n\nrequirements that vary from those recommended by the NOSB.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: This proposed rule would facilitate \n\nthe marketing of organic pet food by establishing clear, enforceable \n\nrequirements for the composition and labeling of these products. This \n\naction will clarify how pet food may be produced, certified, and \n\nmarketed as organic and the significance of organic claims on pet food. \n\nThat standardization would provide certainty to pet food handlers and \n\ncertifying agents for manufacturing and certifying pet foods, \n\nrespectively, and bolster consumer confidence. AMS does not expect this \n\naction to result in significant costs for the $109 million organic pet \n\nfood sector (2012 sales). This action may be an incentive for some \n\nhandlers that are using organic claims on noncertified pet food \n\nproducts to pursue certification. AMS intends to solicit specific \n\npublic comments to validate this expectation.\n\n Risks: AMS does not anticipate risks to be associated with this \n\n\n\naction. The NOSB and industry participated in the development of \n\norganic pet food standards and have strongly encouraged their adoption \n\nsince 2008. This action may provoke questions about the Agency's intent \n\nwith regard to a separate 2013 NOSB recommendation that would, in \n\neffect, prohibit the use of certain amino acids in organic pet food. \n\nAMS is evaluating the impact of that action; however, that recent \n\nrecommendation is not expected to affect this rulemaking.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 04/00/15 .......................\n\nFinal Action........................ 08/00/16 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Organizations.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, Local, Tribal.\n\n Agency Contact: Melissa R.

National Organic Program, Organic Apiculture Practices Standard, \n\nNOP-12-0063\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 7 U.S.C. 6501.\n\n CFR Citation: 7 CFR 205.\n\n Legal Deadline: NPRM, Statutory, July 31, 2015.\n\n This action proposes to amend the USDA organic regulations to \n\nreflect an October 2010 recommendation submitted to the Secretary by \n\nthe National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) concerning the production \n\nof organic apicultural (i.e. beekeeping) products.\n\n Abstract: This action proposes to amend the USDA organic \n\nregulations to reflect an October 2010 recommendation submitted to the \n\nSecretary by the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) concerning the \n\nproduction of organic apicultural (i.e. beekeeping) products. Instead \n\nof continuing to allow certifying agents to certify apiculture to the \n\nmailto:melissa.bailey@usda.gov\n\n\norganic livestock standards, this action would establish certification \n\nstandards specifically for organic bees and bee products.\n\n Statement of Need: This action is necessary to establish uniform \n\nstandards for certification of organic apiculture operations. \n\nCurrently, certifying agents adapt the organic livestock standards to \n\ncertify organic apiaries. This action is necessary to distinguish \n\napiculture as a unique production system that merits separate organic \n\nstandards and would address practices that are not covered in the \n\ngeneral organic livestock requirements. This action is needed to ensure \n\nconsistency across certifying agents in the inspection and \n\ncertification of apiculture operations.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Bees are regarded as ``nonplant life'' \n\nunder definitions in the current Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA) \n\nand implementing regulations. Based on these definitions, apicultural \n\nproducts (bees and bee products) may currently be certified under the \n\nlivestock provisions of the USDA organic regulations (7 CFR part 205).\n\n Alternatives: AMS is considering variations in the implementation \n\nperiod needed for any existing organic honey producers to comply with a \n\nnew proposed forage zone requirement. The agency is also considering an \n\nalternative to align with Canadian and EU apiculture which require land \n\nwithin the forage zone to be ``organically managed,'' rather than \n\ncertified as crop or wild crop.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Issuing standards for management of \n\nbees and bee products will benefit the industry by bringing greater \n\nconsistency across certifiers. The introduction of formal standards \n\nwill encourage new producers to enter the market and increase consumer \n\nconfidence in apiculture products marketed under the USDA organic seal. \n\nIn terms of costs, accredited certifying agents that currently certify \n\napiculture operations as livestock would be required to request to \n\nextend the scope (current possible scopes of accreditation are crops, \n\nlivestock, handling, and wild crop) of their accreditation to include \n\napiculture. AMS is currently evaluating how the new rule would impact \n\nthe costs to existing organic producers.\n\n Risks: AMS does not expect controversy as a result of this action. \n\nOne provision that AMS anticipates public comment on during rulemaking \n\npertains to a 1.8 mile forage zone radius around bee hives. Under the \n\nproposed standard, this forage zone would need to be comprised of \n\ncertified organic cropland and/or certified wild crop harvest area. \n\nThis provision may limit new producers in some parts of the world from \n\nentering the market. However, there is widespread recognition of the \n\nproposed requirements among certified operations, as many certifiers \n\n\n\nhave started using the 2010 NOSB recommendation as guidance for \n\ncertification of apiculture operations.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 07/00/15 .......................\n\nFinal Action........................ 12/00/16 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Governmental Jurisdictions, \n\nOrganizations.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, Local, State, Tribal.\n\n Agency Contact: Melissa R.

National Organic Program--Organic Aquaculture Standards\n\n Priority: Economically Significant. Major under 5 U.S.C. 801.\n\n Unfunded Mandates: Undetermined.\n\n Legal Authority: 7 U.S.C. 6501 to 6522\n\n CFR Citation: 7 CFR 205.\n\n Legal Deadline: NPRM, Statutory, February 28, 2015.\n\n This action will establish standards for organic farmed aquatic \n\nanimals and their products to allow U.S. producers to compete in the \n\norganic seafood market. The Organic Foods Production Act authorizes the \n\nNOP to regulate organic claims on fish used for food. The USDA organic \n\nregulations do not include organic aquaculture standards. This action \n\nwill open the market for U.S. organic aquaculture production and ensure \n\nthat organic aquatic animal products sold in the U.S. meet a consistent \n\nstandard.\n\n Abstract: This action proposes to establish standards for organic \n\nproduction and certification of farmed aquatic animals and their \n\nproducts in the USDA organic regulations. This action would also add \n\naquatic animals as a scope of certification and accreditation under the \n\nNational Organic Program. This action is necessary to establish \n\nstandards for organic farmed aquatic animals and their products which \n\nmailto:melissa.bailey@usda.gov\n\n\nwould allow U.S. producers to compete in the organic seafood market. \n\nThis action is also necessary to address multiple recommendations \n\nprovided by USDA by the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB). In \n\n2007 through 2009, the NOSB made five recommendations to establish \n\nstandards for the certification of organic farmed aquatic animals and \n\ntheir products. Finally, the U.S. currently has organic standards \n\nequivalence arrangements with Canada and the European Union (EU). Both \n\nCanada and the EU have recently established standards for organic \n\naquaculture products. Because the U.S. does not have organic \n\naquaculture standards, the U.S. is unable to include aquaculture in the \n\nscope of these arrangements. Establishing U.S. organic aquaculture may \n\nprovide a basis for expanding those trade partnerships.\n\n Statement of Need: In 2005, The Secretary of Agriculture appointed \n\nan Aquaculture Working Group to advise the National Organic Standards \n\nBoard (NOSB) on drafting a recommendation on the production of organic \n\nfarmed aquatic animals. The NOSB considered the Aquaculture Working \n\nGroup's draft recommendations and provided USDA with a series of five \n\nrecommendations\n\n[[Page 76477]]\n\nfrom 2007-2009 for technical standards for the production and \n\ncertification of organic farmed aquatic animals. Based on the NOSB \n\nrecommendations, this action proposed to establish standards for \n\norganic production and certification of farmed aquatic animals and \n\ntheir products in the USDA organic regulations. This action would also \n\nadd aquatic animals as an area of certification and accreditation under \n\nNOP.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) \n\nNational Organic Program (NOP) is authorized by the Organic Foods \n\nProduction Act of 1990 (OFPA) to establish national standards governing \n\nthe marketing of organically produced agricultural products (7 U.S.C. \n\n6501-6522). The USDA organic regulations set the requirements for the \n\norganic certification of agricultural products (7 CFR Part 205). \n\nParticipation under the NOP is voluntary. However, if organic producers \n\nor handlers choose to sell, represent, or label more than $5,000 in \n\norganic products, certification under the USDA organic regulations is \n\nrequired.\n\n Alternatives: An alternative to providing organic aquatic animal \n\nstandards would be to not publish such standards and allow aquatic \n\nanimal products to continue to be sold as organic based on private \n\nstandards or other countries standards. Organic seafood producers have \n\n\n\nexpressed a strong interest in having USDA organic standards for fish \n\nand other aquatic animal products. U.S. aquaculture operations are \n\ngenerally hesitant to invest in organic aquaculture without published \n\nstandards for organic aquatic animals and their products. Selecting \n\nsuch an alternative could result in failure for this sector of organic \n\nagriculture to develop in the United States.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The cost for existing conventional \n\naquaculture operations to convert and participate in this voluntary \n\nmarketing program will generally be incurred in the cost of changing \n\nmanagement practices, increased feed costs, and obtaining organic \n\ncertification. There will also be some costs to certifying agents who \n\nwould need to add aquaculture to their areas of accreditation under the \n\nUSDA organic regulations. These costs include application fees and \n\nexpanded audits to ensure certifying agents meet the accreditation \n\nrequirements needed for providing certification services to aquaculture \n\noperations. Certification of organic operations under the NOP is \n\nprovided as a user-fee service by AMS-accredited private sector \n\ncertifying agents and State agencies. AMS provides accreditation \n\nservices to private and State agency certifiers on a cost-recovery, \n\nuser-fee basis. AMS will not require additional appropriated funds to \n\nimplement this program. By providing organic standards for organic \n\naquatic animal products, producers will be able to sell certified \n\norganic aquatic animal products for up to 75-100 percent above the \n\nprice of conventionally produced seafood. In addition, organic aquatic \n\nanimal products imported into the U.S. from other countries will be \n\nrequired to meet a consistent, enforced standard. Organic consumers \n\nwill be assured that organic aquatic animal products comply with the \n\nUSDA organic regulations. The new standards will also provide the basis \n\nfor expanding our organic standards equivalency agreements to include \n\nthis additional area of organic products.\n\n Risks: There are no known risks to providing these additional \n\nstandards for certification of organic products.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 02/00/15 .......................\n\nFinal Action........................ 07/00/16 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Organizations.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal.\n\n Federalism: This action may have federalism implications as defined \n\nin EO 13132.\n\n Agency Contact: Melissa R.

L. 113-79.\n\n CFR Citation: 7 CFR 900.\n\n Legal Deadline: NPRM, Statutory, November 30, 2014.\n\n This action would amend the general regulations that apply to the \n\n29 marketing orders for fruits, vegetables, and specialty crops and the \n\norders and/or rules and regulations of the 22 research and promotion \n\nprograms under AMS oversight.\n\n Abstract: As a result of this action, certified ``organic'' \n\ncommodities (those comprising at least 95 percent organic components) \n\nwould no longer be subject to assessment for promotion activities \n\nconducted under marketing order or research and promotion programs. In \n\naddition, certified organic commodities that are produced, handled, \n\nmarketed, or imported by operations that also deal in conventional \n\nproducts would be eligible for exemptions. Currently, only products \n\nthat are certified ``100 percent organic'' and that are produced and \n\nhandled by entities that deal exclusively with organic products are \n\nexempt from assessments. This action is expected to reduce the \n\nassessment obligation for organic industry operators by as much as \n\n$13.7 million. Conversely, the impact on the marketing programs will be \n\na loss of approximately $13.7 million in funds for generic commodity \n\npromotions.\n\n Statement of Need: Section 501 of the Federal Agriculture \n\nImprovement and Reform Act of 1996 (7 U.S.C. 7401) (FAIR Act), as \n\namended, currently exempts entities that produce and market solely 100 \n\npercent organic products from payment of assessments under commodity \n\nmailto:melissa.bailey@usda.gov\n\n\npromotion laws. Section 10004 of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (Pub. L. \n\n113-79) (Farm Bill) further amended the FAIR Act to provide exemptions \n\nfor all certified organic products, including those produced and \n\nhandled by operators that also deal in conventional products. This \n\naction is needed to bring existing Federal regulations governing \n\ncommodity promotion activities into compliance with the FAIR Act, as \n\namended by the Farm Bill.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Section 10004 of the Agricultural Act of \n\n2014 (Pub. L. 113-79) (Farm Bill) further amended the FAIR Act to \n\nprovide exemptions for all certified organic products, including those \n\nproduced and handled by operators that also deal in conventional \n\nproducts.

Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 7 U.S.C. 7333.\n\n CFR Citation: 7 CFR 1437.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is amending \n\nregulations for the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP). \n\nNAP is administered for CCC by the Farm Service Agency (FSA). NAP \n\nprovides producers of crops that are not eligible for crop insurance \n\nwith a basic level of risk management coverage. NAP provides financial \n\nassistance to producers of non-insurable crops when low yield, loss of \n\ninventory, or prevented plantings occur due to a natural disaster. The \n\nrule includes changes to NAP required by the 2014 Farm Bill. The \n\nchanges include revised NAP eligibility requirements for coverage on \n\ntilled native sod, and added coverage for sweet sorghum and biomass \n\nsorghum. Beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers will be eligible \n\nfor service fee waivers. New ``buy up'' provisions will allow producers \n\nto buy additional NAP coverage for an additional premium. While the \n\nrule does not have a statutory deadline, the 2014 Farm Bill requires \n\nchanges to the NAP program beginning with the 2015 coverage year, which \n\nbegins as early as May 2014. In addition to the 2014 Farm Bill changes, \n\nthe rule also makes the following changes:\n\n Adds NAP coverage for organic crops.\n\n Expands NAP coverage for mollusks, a common aquaculture \n\ncrop. Specifically, it removes the current requirement that eligible \n\nmollusk inventory be seeded and raised in containers or similar devices \n\ndesigned to protect the aquaculture species.\n\n Statement of Need: This rule is needed to update the FSA \n\nregulations to implement the 2014 Farm Bill changes.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The Agricultural Act of 2014 (Pub. L. 113-\n\n79).\n\n Alternatives: There are no alternatives to this rule, the changes \n\nare legislatively mandated.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: A cost benefit analysis was prepared \n\nfor this rule and will be made available when the rule is published.\n\n Risks: None.\n\n\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInterim Final Rule.................. 12/00/14 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n URL For Public Comments: regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Deirdre Holder, Director, Regulatory Review Group, \n\nDepartment of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency, 1400 Independence \n\nAvenue SW., Washington, DC 20250-0572, Phone: 202 205-5851, Fax: 202 \n\n720-5233, Email: deirdre.holder@wdc.usda.gov\n\n RIN: 0560-AI20\n\nUSDA--FSA\n\n7.

Brucellosis and Bovine Tuberculosis; Update of General Provisions\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 7 U.S.C. 1622; 7 U.S.C. 8301 to 8317; 15 U.S.C. \n\n1828; 21 U.S.C. 136 and 136a; 31 U.S.C. 9701.\n\n CFR Citation: 9 CFR 50 and 51; 9 CFR 71; 9 CFR 76 to 78; 9 CFR 86; \n\n9 CFR 93; 9 CFR 161.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: This rulemaking would consolidate the regulations \n\ngoverning bovine tuberculosis (TB), currently found in 9 CFR part 77, \n\nand those governing brucellosis, currently found in 9 CFR part 78. As \n\npart of this consolidation, we are proposing to transition the TB and \n\nbrucellosis programs away from a State status system based on disease \n\nmailto:deirdre.holder@wdc.usda.gov\n\n\nprevalence. Instead, States and tribes would implement an animal health \n\nplan that identifies sources of the diseases within the State or tribe \n\nand specifies mitigations to address the risk posed by these sources. \n\nThe consolidated regulations would also set forth standards for \n\nsurveillance, epidemiological investigations, and affected herd \n\nmanagement that must be incorporated into each animal health plan, with \n\ncertain limited exceptions; conditions for the interstate movement of \n\ncattle, bison, and captive cervids; and conditions for APHIS approval \n\nof tests for bovine TB or brucellosis. Finally, the rulemaking would \n\nrevise the import requirements for cattle and bison to make these \n\nrequirements clearer and ensure that they more effectively mitigate the \n\nrisk of introduction of the diseases into the United States.\n\n Statement of Need: The current regulations were issued during a \n\ntime when the prevalence rates for the disease in domestic, cattle, \n\nbison, and captive cervids were much higher than they are today. As a \n\nresult, the regulations specify measures that are necessary to prevent \n\nthese diseases from spreading through the interstate movement of \n\ninfected animals. The regulations are effective in this regard, but do \n\nnot address reservoirs of tuberculosis and brucellosis that exist in \n\ncertain States. Moreover, the regulations presuppose one method of \n\ndealing with infected herds--whole-herd depopulation--and do not take \n\ninto consideration the development of other methods, such as test-and-\n\nremove protocols, that are equally effective but less costly for APHIS \n\nand producers. Finally, our current regulations governing the \n\nimportation of cattle and bison do not always address the risk that \n\nsuch animals may pose of spreading brucellosis or bovine tuberculosis, \n\nand need to be updated to allow APHIS to take appropriate measures when \n\nprevalence rates for bovine tuberculosis or brucellosis increase or \n\ndecrease in foreign regions.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Under the Animal Health Protection Act (7 \n\nU.S.C. 8301 et seq.), the Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to \n\nissue orders and promulgate regulations to prevent the introduction \n\ninto the United States and the dissemination within the United States \n\nof any pest or disease of livestock.\n\n Alternatives: One alternative would be to leave the current \n\nregulations unchanged. As noted above, the current regulations are \n\neffective in preventing the interstate movement of infected animals, \n\nbut do not address reservoirs of brucellosis and tuberculosis that \n\nexist in certain States and thus do not address the root cause of such \n\ninfection. They also are written in a prescriptive manner which does \n\nnot allow States to take into consideration scientific developments and \n\nother emerging information in determining how best to deal with \n\ninfected animals and herds. Finally, APHIS' current regulations \n\n\n\ngoverning the importation of cattle and bison do not always address the \n\nrisk that such animals may pose of spreading bovine tuberculosis or \n\nbrucellosis.\n\n A second alternative considered was to limit the scope of the \n\nregulatory changes to the Agency's domestic tuberculosis and \n\nbrucellosis program. However, in recent years, when tuberculosis-\n\naffected animals have been discovered at slaughtering facilities within \n\nthe United States, these animals have usually been of foreign origin. \n\nThis has led us to reexamine the current import regulations. As a \n\nresult of this reevaluation, we have determined that the import \n\nregulations need to be revised to assure that they more effectively \n\nmitigate the risk of introduction of these diseases into the United \n\nStates.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Certain additional costs may be \n\nincurred by producers as a result of this rule. For example, the \n\nproposed rule would impose new interstate movement restrictions on \n\nrodeo, event, and exhibited cattle and bison and impose additional \n\ncosts for producers of such cattle and bison. These new testing \n\nrequirements could cost, in aggregate, between $651,000 and $1 million. \n\nAlso, the proposed additional restrictions for the movement of captive \n\ncervids could result in additional costs for producers. Adhering to \n\nthese new requirements may have a total cost to the captive cervid \n\nindustry of between about $157,000 and $485,000 annually. States and \n\ntribes would incur costs associated with this proposed rule, in \n\nparticular in developing animal health plans for bovine tuberculosis \n\nand brucellosis. The proposed animal health plans for brucellosis and \n\nbovine tuberculosis would build significantly on existing operations \n\nwith respect to these diseases. We anticipate that all 50 States and as \n\nmany as 3 tribes would develop animal health plans. Based on our \n\nestimates of plan development costs, the total cost of the development \n\nof these 53 animal health plans could be between about $750,000 and \n\n$2.9 million. We expect that under current circumstances, four or five \n\nStates are likely to develop recognized management area plans as \n\nproposed in this rule as part of their animal health plans. Based on \n\nour estimates of recognized management area plan development costs, the \n\ncost of developing recognized management area plans by these States \n\ncould total\n\n[[Page 76480]]\n\nbetween $56,000 and $274,000. While direct effects of this proposed \n\nrule for producers should be small, whether the entity affected is \n\n\n\nsmall or large, consolidation of the brucellosis and bovine \n\ntuberculosis regulations is expected to benefit the affected livestock \n\nindustries. Disease management would be more focused, flexible and \n\nresponsive, reducing the number of producers incurring costs when \n\ndisease concerns arise in an area. Also, the competitiveness of the \n\nUnited States in international markets depends on its reputation for \n\nproducing healthy animals. The proposed rule would enhance this \n\nreputation through its comprehensive approach to the control of \n\nidentified reservoirs of bovine tuberculosis or brucellosis in wildlife \n\npopulations in certain parts of the United States and more stringent \n\nimport regulations consistent with domestic restrictions. We expect \n\nthat the benefits would justify the costs.\n\n Risks: If we do not issue this proposed rule, reservoirs of \n\nbrucellosis and tuberculosis that exist in certain States will not be \n\nadequately evaluated and addressed. Additionally, our current \n\nregulations regarding the importation of cattle and bison do not always \n\naddress the risk that such animals may pose of spreading brucellosis or \n\nbovine tuberculosis.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 01/00/15 .......................\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 03/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Governmental Jurisdictions.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Local, State, Tribal.\n\n Additional Information: Additional information about APHIS and its \n\nprograms is available on the Internet at http://www.aphis.usda.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Langston Hull, National Center for Import and \n\nExport, VS, Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health \n\nInspection Service, 4700 River Road, Unit 39, Riverdale, MD 20737, \n\nPhone: 301 851-3300.\n\n C.

Establishing a Performance Standard for Authorizing the Importation \n\nand Interstate Movement of Fruits and Vegetables\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 7 U.S.C. 450; 7 U.S.C. 7701 to 7772; 7 U.S.C. 7781 \n\nto 7786; 21 U.S.C. 136 and 136a.\n\n CFR Citation: 7 CFR 318 and 319.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: This rulemaking would amend our regulations governing the \n\nimportations of fruits and vegetables by broadening our existing \n\nperformance standard to provide for consideration of all new fruits and \n\nvegetables for importation into the United States using a notice-based \n\nprocess. Rather than authorizing new imports through proposed and final \n\nrules and specifying import conditions in the regulations, the notice-\n\nbased process uses Federal Register notices to make risk analyses \n\navailable to the public for review and comment, with authorized \n\ncommodities and their conditions of entry subsequently being listed on \n\nthe Internet. It would also remove the region- or commodity-specific \n\nphytosanitary requirements currently found in these regulations. \n\nLikewise, we are proposing an equivalent revision of the performance \n\nstandard in our regulations governing the interstate movements of \n\nfruits and vegetables from Hawaii and the U.S. territories (Guam, \n\nNorthern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and \n\nthe removal of commodity-specific phytosanitary requirements from those \n\nregulations. This proposal would allow for the consideration of \n\nrequests to authorize the importation or interstate movement of new \n\nfruits and vegetables in a manner that enables a more flexible and \n\nresponsive regulatory approach to evolving pest situations in both the \n\nUnited States and exporting countries. It would not, however, alter the \n\nscience-based process in which the risk associated with importation or \n\ninterstate movement of a given fruit or vegetable is evaluated or the \n\nmanner in which risks associated with the importation or interstate \n\nmovement of a fruit or vegetable are mitigated.\n\n Statement of Need: The revised regulations are needed to streamline \n\nthe administrative process involved in consideration of fruits and \n\nvegetables currently not authorized for interstate movement or \n\nimportation, while continuing to provide opportunity for public comment \n\nand engagement on the science and risk-based analysis associated with \n\nsuch imports and interstate movements. The proposal would also enable \n\nus to adapt our import requirements more quickly in the event of any \n\nchanges to a country's pest or disease status or as a result of new \n\nscientific information or treatment options.\n\n\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Under section 7701 of the Plant Protection \n\nAct (PPA), given that the smooth movement of enterable plants and plant \n\nproducts into, out of, or within the United States is vital to the U.S. \n\neconomy, it is the responsibility of the Secretary of Agriculture to \n\nfacilitate exports, imports, and interstate commerce in agricultural \n\nproducts and other commodities that pose a risk of harboring plant \n\npests or noxious weeds in ways that will reduce, to the extent \n\npracticable, as determined by the Secretary, the risk of dissemination \n\nof plant pests or noxious weeds. Decisions regarding exports, imports, \n\nand interstate commerce are required to be based on sound science.\n\n Alternatives: We considered taking no action at this time and \n\nleaving the regulations as they are currently written. We decided \n\nagainst this alternative because leaving the regulations unchanged \n\nwould not address the needs identified immediately above.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Consumers and businesses would \n\nbenefit from the more timely access to fruits and vegetables for which \n\nentry or movement would currently require rulemaking. This benefit \n\nwould be reduced to the extent that certain businesses would face \n\nincreased competition for the subject fruits and vegetables sooner due \n\nto their more timely approval. APHIS has not identified other costs \n\nthat may be incurred because of the proposed rule.\n\n Risks: The performance-based process more closely links APHIS' \n\ndecision to authorize importation of a fruit or vegetable with the pest \n\nrisk assessment and brings us in line with other countries that \n\nauthorize importation of a fruit or vegetable with the pest risk \n\nassessment. Some countries have viewed the rulemakings for fruits and \n\nvegetables that follow completion of the pest risk assessment as a non-\n\ntechnical trade barrier and may have slowed the approval of U.S. \n\nexports (including, but not limited to, fruits and vegetables) into \n\ntheir markets, or placed additional restrictions on existing exports \n\nfrom the United States.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 09/09/14 79 FR 53346\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 11/10/14 .......................\n\n[[Page 76481]]\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 04/00/15 .......................\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal.\n\n International Impacts: This regulatory action will be likely to \n\nhave international trade and investment effects, or otherwise be of \n\ninternational interest.\n\n Additional Information: Additional information about APHIS and its \n\nprograms is available on the Internet at http://www.aphis.usda.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Matthew Rhoads, Associate Executive Director, Plant \n\nHealth Programs, PPQ, Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant \n\nHealth Inspection Service, 4700 River Road, Unit 131, Riverdale, MD \n\n20737-1231, Phone: 301 851-2133.\n\n RIN: 0579-AD71\n\nUSDA--APHIS\n\nFinal Rule Stage\n\n11.

It will also require biologics licensees to provide a \n\nstandardized summary, with confidential business information removed, \n\nof the efficacy and safety data submitted to the Animal and Plant \n\nHealth Inspection Service in support of the issuance of a full product \n\nlicense or conditional license. A single label format along with \n\npublicly available safety and efficacy data will help biologics \n\nproducers to more clearly communicate product performance to their \n\ncustomers.\n\n Statement of Need: The intent of this proposal is to address a \n\nrequest made by our stakeholders and to more clearly communicate \n\nproduct performance information to the user by requiring a uniform \n\nlabel format and a summary of efficacy and safety data (with \n\nconfidential business information removed).\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: APHIS administers and enforces the Virus-\n\nSerum-Toxin Act, as amended (21 U.S.C. 151 to 159). The regulations \n\nissued pursuant to the Act are intended to ensure that veterinary \n\nbiological products are pure, safe, potent, and efficacious when used \n\nhttp://www.aphis.usda.gov/\n\n\naccording to label instructions.\n\n Alternatives: We could retain the current APHIS labeling guidance, \n\nbut maintaining the status quo would not address the concern reported \n\nby stakeholders concerning the interpretation of product performance.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: APHIS anticipates that the only \n\ncosts associated with the proposed labeling format would be one-time \n\ncosts incurred by licensees and permittees in having labels for \n\nexisting licensed products updated in accordance with the proposed new \n\nformat. A simpler, uniform label format would allow biologics licensees \n\nand permittees to more clearly communicate product performance \n\ninformation to the end user. In addition, the rule would simplify the \n\nevaluation of efficacy studies and reduce the amount of time required \n\nby APHIS to evaluate study data, thus allowing manufacturers to market \n\ntheir products sooner.\n\n Risks: APHIS has not identified any risks associated with this \n\nproposed action.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotice.............................. 05/24/11 76 FR 30093\n\nComment Period End.................. 07/25/11 .......................\n\nNPRM................................ 04/21/14 79 FR 22048\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 06/20/14 .......................\n\nFinal Action........................ 05/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Undetermined.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Additional Information: Additional information about APHIS and its \n\nprograms is available on the Internet at http://www.aphis.usda.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Donna L Malloy, Operational Support Section, Center \n\nfor Veterinary Biologics, Policy, Evaluation, and Licensing, VS, \n\nDepartment of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, \n\n4700 River Road, Unit 148, Riverdale, MD 20737-1231, Phone: 301 851-\n\n3426.\n\n RIN: 0579-AD64\n\nUSDA--APHIS\n\n12.

It will also adjust the fee caps associated with \n\ncommercial vessels, commercial trucks, and commercial railcars. Based \n\non the conclusions of a third party assessment of the user fee program \n\nand on other considerations, we have determined that revised user fee \n\ncategories and revised user fees are necessary to recover the costs of \n\nthe current level of activity, to account for actual and projected \n\nincreases in the cost of doing business, and to more accurately align \n\nfees with the costs associated with each fee service.\n\n Statement of Need: Regarding certain agricultural quarantine and \n\ninspection services that are provided in connection with certain \n\ncommercial vessels, commercial trucks, commercial railroad cars, \n\ncommercial aircraft, and international passengers arriving at ports in \n\nthe customs territory of the United States, we have determined that \n\nrevised user fee categories and revised user fees are necessary to \n\nrecover the costs of the current level of activity, to account for \n\nactual and projected increases in the cost of doing business, and to \n\nmore accurately align fees with the costs associated with each fee \n\nservice.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Section 2509(a) of the Food, Agriculture, \n\nConservation, and Trade (FACT) Act of 1990 (21 U.S.C. 136a) authorizes \n\nAPHIS to collect user fees for certain agricultural quarantine and \n\ninspection (AQI) services. The FACT Act was amended on April 4, 1996, \n\nand May 13, 2002. The FACT Act, as amended, authorizes APHIS to collect \n\nuser fees for AQI services provided in connection with the arrival, at \n\na port in the customs territory of the United States, of commercial \n\nvessels, commercial trucks, commercial railroad cars, commercial \n\naircraft, and international passengers. According to the FACT Act, as \n\namended, these user fees should recover the costs of:\n\n[[Page 76482]]\n\n Providing the AQI services for the conveyances and the \n\npassengers listed above;\n\n\n\n Providing preclearance or preinspection at a site outside \n\nthe customs territory of the United States to international passengers, \n\ncommercial vessels, commercial trucks, commercial railroad cars, and \n\ncommercial aircraft;\n\n Administering the user fee program; and\n\n Maintaining a reasonable reserve.\n\n In addition, the FACT Act, as amended, contains the following \n\nrequirement:\n\n The fees should be commensurate with the costs with \n\nrespect to the class of persons or entities paying the fees. This is \n\nintended to avoid cross-subsidization of AQI services.\n\n Alternatives: APHIS focused on three alternatives composed of \n\ndifferent combinations of paying classes. The first or preferred \n\nalternative is the proposed rule; the second alternative differed from \n\nthe first by not including user fees for recipients of AQI treatment \n\nservices; and under the third alternative, recipients of commodity \n\nimport permits and pest import permits would pay user fees, in addition \n\nto the classes that would pay fees under the proposed rule. The latter \n\ntwo alternatives were rejected.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The proposed changes in user fees \n\nwould ensure that the program can continue to protect America's \n\nagricultural industries and natural resource base against invasive \n\nspecies and diseases while more closely aligning, by class, the cost of \n\nAQI services provided and user fee revenue received.\n\n Risks: AQI services benefit U.S. agricultural and natural resources \n\nby protecting them from the inadvertent introduction of foreign pests \n\nand diseases that may enter the country and the threat of intentional \n\nintroduction of pests or pathogens as a means of agroterrorism. In the \n\nextreme, failure to maintain the nation's biosecurity could disrupt \n\nAmerican agricultural production, erode confidence in the U.S. food \n\nsupply, and destabilize the U.S. economy.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 04/25/14 79 FR 22895\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 06/24/14 .......................\n\nNPRM Comment Period Reopened........ 07/01/14 79 FR 37231\n\nNPRM Comment Period Reopened End.... 07/24/14 .......................\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 12/00/14 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Undetermined.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal.\n\n International Impacts: This regulatory action will be likely to \n\nhave international trade and investment effects, or otherwise be of \n\ninternational interest.\n\n Additional Information: Additional information about APHIS and its \n\nprograms is available on the Internet at http://www.aphis.usda.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: William E Thomas, Senior Agriculturist, Office of \n\nthe Deputy Administrator, PPQ, Department of Agriculture, Animal and \n\nPlant Health Inspection Service, 4700 River Road, Unit 130, Riverdale, \n\nMD 20737, Phone: 301 851-2306.\n\n Kris Caraher, Branch Chief, Review and Analysis, Financial \n\nManagement Division, MRPBS, Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant \n\nHealth Inspection Service, 4700 River Road, Unit 55, Riverdale, MD \n\n20737, Phone: 301 851-2834.\n\n RIN: 0579-AD77\n\nUSDA--FOOD AND NUTRITION SERVICE (FNS)\n\nProposed Rule Stage\n\n13.

Section 303 of the Act \n\nrequires the Secretary to establish criteria for imposing fines against \n\nschools, school food authorities, or State agencies that fail to \n\ncorrect severe mismanagement of the program,\n\n[[Page 76483]]\n\nfail to correct repeat violations of program requirements, or disregard \n\na program requirement of which they had been informed. Section 322 of \n\nthe Act requires the Secretary to establish procedures for the \n\ntermination and disqualification of organizations participating in the \n\nSummer Food Service Program (SFSP). Section 362 of the Act requires \n\nthat any school, institution, service institution, facility, or \n\nindividual that has been terminated from any program authorized under \n\nthe Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act or the Child Nutrition \n\nAct of 1966, and appears on either the SFSP or the Child and Adult Care \n\nFood Program's (CACFP's) disqualified list, may not be approved to \n\nparticipate in or administer any other programs authorized under those \n\ntwo Acts.\n\n Statement of Need: There are currently no regulations imposing \n\nfines on schools, school food authorities, or State agencies for \n\nprogram violations and mismanagement. This rule will: (1) Establish \n\ncriteria for imposing fines against schools, school food authorities, \n\nor State agencies that fail to correct severe mismanagement of the \n\nprogram or repeated violations of program requirements; (2) establish \n\nprocedures for the termination and disqualification of organizations \n\nparticipating in the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP); and (3) \n\nrequire that any school, institutions, or individual that has been \n\nterminated from any Federal Child Nutrition Program and appears on \n\neither the SFSP or the Child and Adult Care Food Program's (CACFP's) \n\ndisqualified list may not be approved to participate in or administer \n\nany other Child Nutrition Program.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: This rule codifies Sections 303, 322, and \n\n362 of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-296).\n\n Alternatives: None identified; this rule implements statutory \n\nrequirements.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: This rule is expected to help \n\npromote program integrity in all of the child nutrition programs. FNS \n\nanticipates that these provisions will have no significant costs and no \n\n\n\nmajor increase in regulatory burden to States.\n\n Risks: None identified.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 01/00/15 .......................\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 03/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Local, State.\n\n Federalism: This action may have federalism implications as defined \n\nin EO 13132.\n\n Agency Contact: James F Herbert, Regulatory Review Specialist, \n\nDepartment of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service, 3101 Park Center \n\nDrive, Alexandria, VA 22302, Phone: 703 305-2572, Email: \n\njames.herbert@fns.usda.gov\n\n Lynnette M Thomas, Chief, Planning and Regulatory Affairs Branch, \n\nDepartment of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service, 3101 Park Center \n\nDrive, Alexandria, VA 22302, Phone: 703 605-4782, Email: \n\nlynnette.thomas@fns.usda.gov\n\n RIN: 0584-AE08\n\nUSDA--FNS\n\n15.

L. 111-296\n\n CFR Citation: 7 CFR 210; 7 CFR 215; 7 CFR 220; 7 CFR 226.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: This proposal would implement section 221 of the Healthy, \n\nHunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-296; the Act) which requires \n\nUSDA to review and update, no less frequently than once every 10 years, \n\nrequirements for meals served under the Child and Adult Care Food \n\nProgram (CACFP) to ensure that meals are consistent with the most \n\nrecent Dietary Guidelines for Americans and relevant nutrition science.\n\n Statement of Need: Section 221 of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act \n\nof 2010 (Pub. L. 111-296, the Act) requires USDA to review and update, \n\nno less frequently than once every 10 years, requirements for meals \n\nserved under the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) to ensure \n\nthat meals are consistent with the most recent Dietary Guidelines for \n\nmailto:james.herbert@fns.usda.gov\nmailto:lynnette.thomas@fns.usda.gov\n\n\nAmericans and relevant nutrition science. The Act also clarifies the \n\npurpose of the program, restricts the use of food as a punishment or \n\nreward, outlines requirements for milk and milk substitution, and \n\nintroduces requirements for the availability of water. This rule will \n\nestablish the criteria and procedures for implementing these provisions \n\nof the Act.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Section 221 of the Healthy, Hunger-Free \n\nKids Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-296).\n\n Alternatives: There are several instances throughout this rule and \n\nits associated Regulatory Impact Analysis that offer alternatives for \n\nreview and comment to the various criteria and procedures discussed in \n\nthis proposed rule.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: This rule is expected to improve the \n\nnutritional quality of meals served and the overall health of children \n\nparticipating in the CACFP. Most CACFP meals are served to children \n\nfrom low-income households. At this time, we cannot estimate the \n\nfinancial impact the proposed rule will have on State agencies, \n\nsponsoring organizations, and child care institutions, but we expect \n\nthat there will be a small cost increase associated with the \n\nimplementation of improved meal pattern requirements. A regulatory \n\nimpact analysis will be conducted to determine these cost implications.\n\n Risks: None identified.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 11/00/14 .......................\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 01/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Governmental Jurisdictions.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Local, State.\n\n Agency Contact: James F.

Enhancing Retailer Eligibility Standards In SNAP\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: Sec 3, U.S.C. 2012; sec 9, U.S.C. 2018\n\n CFR Citation: 7 CFR 271.2; 7 CFR 278.1.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: This rulemaking will address the criteria used to \n\nauthorize redemption of SNAP benefits (especially by restaurant-type \n\noperations).\n\n Statement of Need: The 2014 Farm Bill amended the Food and \n\nNutrition\n\n[[Page 76484]]\n\nAct of 2008 to increase the requirement that certain SNAP authorized \n\nretail food stores have available on a continual basis at least three \n\nvarieties of items in each of four staple food categories to a \n\nmandatory minimum of seven. The 2014 Farm Bill also amended the Act to \n\nincrease for certain SNAP authorized retail food stores the minimum \n\nnumber of categories in which perishable foods are required from two to \n\nthree. This rule would codify these mandatory requirements. Further, \n\nusing existing authority in the Act and feedback from an expansive \n\nRequest for Information, the rulemaking also proposes changes to \n\naddress depth of stock, redefine staple and accessory foods, and amend \n\nthe definition of retail food store to clarify when a retailer is a \n\nrestaurant rather than a retail food store.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Section 3(k) of the Food and Nutrition Act \n\nof 2008 (the Act) generally (with limited exception) (1) requires that \n\nfood purchased with SNAP benefits be meant for home consumption and (2) \n\nforbids the purchase of hot foods with SNAP benefits. The intent of \n\nthose statutory requirements can be circumvented by selling cold foods, \n\nwhich may be purchased with SNAP benefits, and offering onsite heating \n\nor cooking of those same foods, either for free or at an additional \n\ncost. In addition, Section 9 of the Act provides for approval of retail \n\nfood stores and wholesale food concerns based on their ability to \n\neffectuate the purposes of the Program.\n\n Alternatives: Because this proposed rule is under development, \n\nalternatives are not yet articulated.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The proposed changes will allow FNS \n\nmailto:lynnette.thomas@fns.usda.gov\n\n\nto improve access to healthy food choices for SNAP participants and to \n\nensure that participating retailers effectuate the purposes of the \n\nProgram. FNS anticipates that these provisions will have no significant \n\ncosts to States.\n\n Risks: None identified.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 08/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: State.\n\n Agency Contact: Charles H.

L. 110-246\n\n CFR Citation: 7 CFR 276.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: This final rule would implement provisions under section \n\n4132 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, giving the \n\nDepartment of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) the \n\nauthority to assess a civil penalty and to disqualify a retail or \n\nwholesale food store authorized to participate in SNAP.\n\n Statement of Need: This final rule implements the provisions of the \n\n2008 Farm Bill that provide the U.S. Department of Agriculture greater \n\nmailto:charles.watford@fns.usda.gov\nmailto:lynnette.thomas@fns.usda.gov\n\n\nflexibility in assessing sanctions against retail food stores and \n\nwholesale food concerns found in violation of the Supplemental \n\nNutrition Assistance Program rules. This rule updates SNAP retailer \n\nsanction regulations to include authority granted in the 2008 Farm Bill \n\nto allow the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) to impose a civil penalty \n\nin addition to disqualification, raise the allowable penalties per \n\nviolation and provide greater flexibility to the Department for minor \n\nviolations.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Section 4132, Food, Conservation, and \n\nEnergy Act of 2008 (Pub. L. 110-246).\n\n Alternatives: For the new trafficking civil penalty, FNS considered \n\nalternatives for assessing a civil penalty in addition to permanent \n\ndisqualification for stores sanctioned for trafficking.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The changes to the retailer sanction \n\nregulations will improve program integrity by increasing the deterrent \n\neffect of sanctions on the small number of authorized firms that commit \n\nprogram violations.\n\n Risks: The risk that retail or wholesale food stores will violate \n\nSNAP rules, or continue to violate SNAP rules, is expected to be \n\nreduced by refining program sanctions for participating retailers and \n\nwholesalers.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 08/14/12 77 FR 48461\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 10/15/12 .......................\n\nFinal Action........................ 01/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: State.\n\n Additional Information: Note: This RIN replaces the previously \n\nissued RIN 0584-AD78.\n\n Agency Contact: Charles H.

L. 111-296\n\n CFR Citation: 7 CFR 210; 7 CFR 220.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: This final rule codifies a provision of the Healthy, \n\nHunger-Free Kids Act (Pub. L. 111-296; the Act) under 7 CFR parts 210 \n\nand 220. Section 204 of the Act requires each local educational agency \n\n(LEA) to establish, for all schools under its jurisdiction, a local \n\nschool wellness policy. The Act requires that the wellness policy \n\ninclude goals for nutrition, nutrition education, physical activity, \n\nand other school-based activities that promote student wellness. In \n\naddition, the Act requires that local educational agencies ensure \n\nstakeholder participation in development of their local school wellness \n\npolicies, and periodically assess compliance with the policies, and \n\ndisclose information about the policies to the public.\n\n Statement of Need: Schools play a critical role in promoting \n\nstudent health, preventing childhood obesity, and combating problems \n\nassociated with poor nutrition and physical inactivity. To formalize \n\nand encourage this role, section 204 of the Child Nutrition and WIC \n\nReauthorization Act of 2004 (Pub. L. 108-265), required each\n\n[[Page 76485]]\n\nlocal educational agency (LEA) participating in the National School \n\nLunch Program (NSLP) and/or the School Breakfast Program (SBP) to \n\nestablish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006. \n\nSubsequently, section 204 of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 \n\n(HHFKA, Pub. L. 111-296, December 13, 2010) added a new section 9A to \n\nthe Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (NSLA) (42 U.S.C. \n\n1758b) which expands the scope of wellness policies; brings additional \n\nstakeholders into the development, implementation, and review of local \n\nschool wellness policies; and requires public updates on the content \n\nand implementation of the wellness policies.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Section 204 of the Child Nutrition and WIC \n\nReauthorization Act of 2004 (Pub. L. 108-265); Section 204 of the \n\nHealthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA, Pub.

Requirements for the Disposition of Non-Ambulatory Disabled Veal \n\nCalves\n\n Priority: Other Significant. Major status under 5 U.S.C. 801 is \n\nundetermined.\n\n Legal Authority: Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 et \n\nseq.)\n\n CFR Citation: 9 CFR 309.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: FSIS is proposing to amend the ante-mortem inspection \n\nregulations to remove a provision that permits establishments to set \n\napart and hold for treatment veal calves that are unable to rise from a \n\nrecumbent position and walk because they are tired or cold (9 CFR \n\n309.13(b)). The regulations permit such calves to proceed to slaughter \n\nif they are able to rise and walk after being warmed or rested. FSIS is \n\nproposing to require that non-ambulatory disabled (NAD) veal calves \n\nthat are offered for slaughter be condemned and promptly euthanized. \n\nThe existing regulations require that NAD mature cattle be condemned on \n\nante-mortem inspection and that they be promptly euthanized (9 CFR \n\n309.3(e)). FSIS believes that prohibiting the slaughter of all NAD veal \n\ncalves would improve compliance with the Humane Methods of Slaughter \n\nAct of 1978 (HMSA), and the humane slaughter implementing regulations. \n\nIt would also improve the Agency's inspection efficiency by eliminating \n\nthe time that FSIS inspection program personnel (IPP) spend assessing \n\nand supervising the treatment of NAD veal calves.\n\n Statement of Need: Removing the provision from 9 CFR 309.13(b) \n\nwould eliminate uncertainty as to what is to be done with veal calves \n\nthat are non-ambulatory disabled because they are tired or cold, or \n\nbecause they are injured or sick, thereby ensuring the appropriate \n\ndisposition of these animals. In addition, removing the provision in 9 \n\nCFR 309.13(b) would improve inspection efficiency by eliminating the \n\ntime that FSIS IPP spend assessing the treatment of non-ambulatory \n\ndisabled veal calves.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: 21 U.S.C. 603 (a) and (b).\n\n Alternatives: The Agency considered two alternatives to the \n\nproposed amendment: The status quo and prohibiting the slaughter of \n\nnon-ambulatory disabled ``bob veal,'' which are calves generally less \n\nthan one week old.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: If the proposed rule is adopted, \n\nnon-\n\n[[Page 76486]]\n\n\n\nambulatory disabled veal calves will not be re-inspected during ante-\n\nmortem inspection. The veal calves that are condemned during ante-\n\nmortem inspection will be euthanized. The estimated annual cost to the \n\nveal industry would range between $2,368 and $161,405.\n\n The expected benefits of this proposed rule are not quantifiable. \n\nHowever, the proposed rule will ensure the humane disposition of the \n\nnon-ambulatory disabled veal calves. It will also increase the \n\nefficiency and effective implementation of inspection and humane \n\nhandling requirements at official establishments.\n\n Risks: None.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 04/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Agency Contact: Dr. Daniel L.

Major under 5 U.S.C. 801.\n\n Legal Authority: Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601 \n\nto 695); Pub. L. 110-246, sec 11016; Pub. L. 113-79, sec 12106\n\n CFR Citation: 9 CFR ch III, subchapter F (new).\n\n Legal Deadline: Final, Statutory, Final Regulations not later than \n\n60 days after enactment of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (Pub. L. 113-\n\n79). The Agriculture Act of 2014 directs the Department to publish \n\nfinal regulations not later than 60 days after the date of enactment.\n\n Abstract: The 2008 Farm Bill (Pub. L. 110-246, sec. 11016), amended \n\nthe Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) to make ``catfish'' a species \n\namenable to the FMIA and, therefore, subject to FSIS inspection. In \n\nmailto:daniel.engeljohn@fsis.usda.gov\n\n\naddition, the 2008 Farm Bill gave FSIS the authority to define the term \n\n``catfish.'' On February 24, 2011, FSIS published a proposed rule that \n\noutlined a mandatory catfish inspection program and presented two \n\noptions for defining ``catfish.'' The 2014 Farm Bill (Pub. L. 113-79, \n\nsec. 12106), amended the FMIA to remove the term ``catfish'' and to \n\nmake ``all fish of the order Siluriformes'' subject to FSIS \n\njurisdiction and inspection. As a result, FSIS inspection of \n\nSiluriformes is mandated by law and non-discretionary.\n\n Statement of Need: The 2008 and 2014 Farm Bills amended the Federal \n\nMeat Inspection Act, making all fish of the order Siluriformes amenable \n\nspecies to the FMIA, requiring FSIS inspection.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: 21 U.S.C. 601 to 695, Public Law 110-246, \n\nsection 11016, Public Law 113-79, section 12106.\n\n Alternatives: The option of no rulemaking is unavailable.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: FSIS anticipates benefits from \n\nuniform standards and the more extensive and intensive inspection \n\nservice it will provide. The requirements for imported Siluriformes \n\nwill be equivalent to those applied to domestically raised and \n\nprocessed fish of this type.\n\n Risks: In the final rule, the Agency will consider any risks to \n\npublic health or other pertinent risks associated with the production, \n\nprocessing, and distribution of catfish and catfish products.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 02/24/11 76 FR 10434\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 06/24/11 .......................\n\nFinal Action........................ 12/00/14 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n International Impacts: This regulatory action will be likely to \n\nhave international trade and investment effects, or otherwise be of \n\ninternational interest.\n\n Agency Contact: Dr. Daniel L.

Electronic Export Application and Certification as a Reimbursable \n\nService and Flexibility in the Requirements for Official Export \n\nInspection Marks, Devices, and Certificates\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601 \n\nto 695); Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) (21 U.S.C. 451 to 470); \n\nEgg Products Inspection Act (EPIA) (21 U.S.C. 1031 to 1056); \n\nAgricultural Marketing Act (AMA) (7 U.S.C. 1622(h)\n\n CFR Citation: 9 CFR 312.8; 9 CFR 322.1 and 322.2; 9 CFR 350.7; 9 \n\nCFR 362.5; 9 CFR 381.104 to 381.106; 9 CFR 590.407; 9 CFR 592.20 and \n\n592.500.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: FSIS is developing final regulations to amend the meat, \n\npoultry, and egg product inspection regulations to provide for an \n\nelectronic export application and certification system. The electronic \n\nexport application and certification system will be a component of the \n\nAgency's Public Health Information System (PHIS). The export component \n\nof PHIS will be available as an alternative to the paper-based \n\napplication and certification process. FSIS intends to charge users for \n\nthe use of the system. FSIS is establishing a formula for calculating \n\nthe fee. FSIS is also providing establishments that export meat, \n\npoultry, and egg products with flexibility in the official export \n\ninspection marks, devices, and certificates. In addition, FSIS is \n\namending the egg product export regulations to parallel the meat and \n\npoultry export regulations.\n\n Statement of Need: These regulations will facilitate the electronic \n\nprocessing of export applications and certificates through the Public \n\nHealth Information System (PHIS), a computerized, Web-based inspection \n\ninformation system. This rule will provide the electronic export system \n\nas a reimbursable certification service charged to the exporter.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: 21 U.S.C. 601 to 695; 21 U.S.C. 451 to 470; \n\n21 U.S.C. 1031 to 1056; 7 U.S.C. 1622(h).\n\n Alternatives: The electronic export applications and certification \n\nsystem is being proposed as a voluntary service; therefore, exporters \n\nhave the option of continuing to use the current paper-based system. \n\nTherefore, no alternatives were considered.\n\nmailto:daniel.engeljohn@fsis.usda.gov\n\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: FSIS is charging exporters an \n\napplication fee for the electronic export system. Automating the export \n\napplication and certification process will facilitate the exportation \n\nof U.S. meat, poultry, and\n\n[[Page 76487]]\n\negg products by streamlining and automating the processes that are in \n\nuse, while ensuring that foreign regulatory requirements are met. The \n\ncost to an exporter would depend on the number of electronic \n\napplications submitted. An exporter that submits only a few \n\napplications per year would not be likely to experience a significant \n\neconomic impact. Under this rate, inspection personnel workload will be \n\nreduced through the elimination of the physical handling and processing \n\nof applications and certificates. When an electronic government-to-\n\ngovernment system interface or data exchange is used, fraudulent \n\ntransactions, such as false alterations and reproductions, will be \n\nsignificantly reduced, if not eliminated. The electronic export system \n\nis designed to ensure authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality. \n\nExporters will be provided with a more efficient and effective \n\napplication and certification process. The egg product export \n\nregulations provide the same export requirements across all products \n\nregulated by FSIS and consistency in the export application and \n\ncertification process. The total annual paperwork burden to the egg \n\nprocessing industry to fill out the paper-based export application is \n\napproximately $32,340 per year for a total of 924 hours a year. The \n\naverage establishment burden would be 11 hours, and $385.00 per \n\nestablishment.\n\n Risks: None.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 01/23/12 77 FR 3159\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 03/23/12 .......................\n\nFinal Action........................ 02/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n International Impacts: This regulatory action will be likely to \n\nhave international trade and investment effects, or otherwise be of \n\n\n\ninternational interest.\n\n Agency Contact: Rita Kishore, Acting Director, Import/Export \n\nCoordinator and Policy Development Staff, Department of Agriculture, \n\nFood Safety and Inspection Service, 1400 Independence Avenue SW, Office \n\nof Policy and Program Development, Room 2147, South Building, \n\nWashington, DC 20250, Phone: 202 720-6508, Fax: 202 720-7990, Email: \n\nrita.kishore@fsis.usda.gov\n\n RIN: 0583-AD41\n\nUSDA--FSIS\n\n23. Descriptive Designation for Needle- or Blade-Tenderized \n\n(Mechanically Tenderized) Beef Products\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 21 U.S.C. 601 to 695\n\n CFR Citation: 9 CFR 317.2(e)(3).\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: FSIS has proposed regulations to require the use of the \n\ndescriptive designation ``mechanically tenderized'' on the labels of \n\nraw or partially cooked needle- or blade-tenderized beef products, \n\nincluding beef products injected with marinade or solution, unless such \n\nproducts are destined to be fully cooked at an official establishment. \n\nBeef products that have been needle- or blade-tenderized are referred \n\nto as ``mechanically tenderized'' products. This rule would require \n\nthat the product name for such beef products include the descriptive \n\ndesignation ``mechanically tenderized,'' and an accurate description of \n\nthe beef component. The rule would also require that the print for all \n\nwords in the descriptive designation as the product name appear in the \n\nsame style, color, and size, and on a single-color contrasting \n\nbackground. In addition, this rule would require that labels of raw and \n\npartially-cooked needle- or blade-tenderized beef products destined for \n\nhousehold consumers, hotels, restaurants, or similar institutions \n\ninclude validated cooking instructions stating that these products need \n\nto be cooked to a specified minimum internal temperature, and whether \n\nthey need to be held at that minimum internal temperature for a \n\nspecified time before consumption, i.e., dwell time or rest time, to \n\nensure that they are thoroughly cooked.\n\n Statement of Need: FSIS has concluded that without proper labeling, \n\nraw or partially cooked mechanically tenderized beef products could be \n\nmistakenly perceived by consumers to be whole, intact muscle cuts. The \n\nfact that a cut of beef has been needle- or blade-tenderized is a \n\ncharacterizing feature of the product and, as such, a material fact \n\nmailto:rita.kishore@fsis.usda.gov\n\n\nthat is likely to affect consumers' purchase decisions and that should \n\naffect their preparation of the product. FSIS has also concluded that \n\nthe addition of validated cooking instruction is necessary to ensure \n\nthat potential pathogens throughout the product are destroyed. Without \n\nthorough cooking, pathogens that may have been introduced to the \n\ninterior of the product during the tenderization process may remain in \n\nthe product.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: 21 U.S.C. 601 to 695.\n\n Alternatives: The Agency considered two options: Option 1, extend \n\nlabeling requirements to include vacuum-tumbled beef products and \n\nenzyme-formed beef products; and Option 2, extend the proposed labeling \n\nrequirements to all needle- or blade-tenderized meat and poultry \n\nproducts.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The proposed rule estimated the one-\n\ntime cost to produce labels for mechanically tenderized beef at $1.05 \n\nmillion. The annualized cost is $140,000 at 7 percent for 10 years \n\n($120,000 and when annualized at 3 percent for 10 years). The proposed \n\nrule estimated an additional one-time total cost to produce labels for \n\nmechanically tenderized beef at $1.57 million or $209,000 when \n\nannualized at 7 percent for 10 years ($179,000 when annualized at 3 \n\npercent for 10 years), if this proposed rule becomes final before the \n\nadded-solution rule is finalized. The proposed rule estimated the \n\nexpected number of E. coli O157:H7 illnesses prevented would be 453 per \n\nyear, with a range of 133 to 1,497, if the predicted percentages of \n\nbeef steaks and roasts are cooked to an internal temperature of 160 \n\n[deg]F (or 145 [deg]F and 3 minutes of dwell time). These prevented \n\nillnesses amount to $1,486,000 per year in benefits with a range of \n\n$436,000 to $4,912,000. Therefore, the expected annualized net benefits \n\nare $296,000 to $4,772,000, with a primary estimate of $1,346,000. If, \n\nhowever, this rule is in effect before the added solutions rule, the \n\nexpected annualized net benefits are then $1,137,000, with a range of \n\n$87,000 to $4,563,000, plus the unquantifiable benefits of increased \n\nconsumer information and market efficiency, minus an unquantified \n\nconsumer surplus loss and an unquantified cost associated with food \n\nservice establishments changing their standard operating procedures.\n\n Risks: FSIS estimates that approximately 1,965 illnesses annually \n\nare attributed to mechanically tenderized beef, either with or without \n\nadded solutions. If all the servings are cooked to a minimum of 160 \n\ndegrees F then the number of illnesses drops to 78. This number of \n\nillnesses is due to a data set for all STEC and not just O157 data. \n\nFSIS estimates that 1,887 out of 1,965 would be prevented annually if \n\n\n\nmechanically tenderized meat were cooked to 160 degrees F.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 06/10/13 78 FR 34589\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 08/09/13 .......................\n\n[[Page 76488]]\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 08/09/13 78 FR 48631\nNPRM Comment Period Reopened........ 12/03/13 78 FR 72597\nFinal Action........................ 12/00/14 .......................\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Agency Contact: Rosalyn Murphy-Jenkins, Director, Labeling and \n\nProgram Delivery Staff (LPDS), Department of Agriculture, Food Safety \n\nand Inspection Service, Office of Policy and Program Development, \n\nPatriots Plaza 3, 1400 Independence Avenue SW., Room 8-148, Mailstop \n\n5273, Washington, DC 20250-5273, Phone: 301 504-0879, Fax: 202 245-\n\n4792, Email: rosalyn.murphy-jenkins@fsis.usda.gov\n\n RIN: 0583-AD45\n\nUSDA--FSIS\n\n24. Record To Be Kept by Official Establishments and Retail Stores That \n\nGrind Raw Beef Products\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.\n\n CFR Citation: 9 CFR 320.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: FSIS proposed to amend its recordkeeping regulations to \n\nspecify that all official establishments and retail stores that grind \n\nraw beef products for sale in commerce must keep records that disclose \n\nthe identity of the supplier of all source materials that they use in \n\nthe preparation of each lot of raw ground product, and identify the \n\nnames of those source materials.\n\n Statement of Need: Under the authority of the Federal Meat \n\nInspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) and its implementing \n\nregulations, FSIS investigates complaints and reports of consumer \n\nfoodborne illness possibly associated with FSIS-regulated meat \n\nproducts. Many such investigations into consumer foodborne illnesses \n\ninvolve those caused by the consumption of raw beef ground, by official \n\nmailto:rosalyn.murphy-jenkins@fsis.usda.gov\n\n\nestablishments or retail stores. FSIS investigators and public health \n\nofficials frequently use records kept by all levels of the food \n\ndistribution chain, including the retail level, to identify and \n\ntraceback product that is the source of the illness to the suppliers \n\nthat produced the source material for the product. The Agency, however, \n\nhas often been thwarted in its effort to traceback ground beef \n\nproducts, some associated with consumer illness, to the suppliers that \n\nprovided source materials for the products. In some situations, \n\nofficial establishments and retail stores have not kept records \n\nnecessary to allow traceback and traceforward activities to occur. \n\nWithout such necessary records, FSIS's ability to conduct timely and \n\neffective consumer foodborne illness investigations and other public \n\nhealth activities throughout the stream of commerce is also affected, \n\nthereby placing the consuming public at risk. Therefore, for FSIS to be \n\nable to conduct traceback and traceforward investigations, foodborne \n\nillnesses investigations, or to monitor product recalls, the records \n\nkept by official establishments and retail stores that grind raw beef \n\nproducts must disclose the identity of the supplier and the names of \n\nthe sources of all materials that they use in the preparation of each \n\nlot of raw ground beef product.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Under 21 U.S.C. 642, official \n\nestablishments and retail stores that grind raw beef products for sale \n\nin commerce are persons, firms, or corporations that must keep such \n\nrecords and correctly disclose all transactions involved in their \n\nbusinesses subject to the Act. This is because they engage in the \n\nbusiness of preparing products of an amenable species for use as human \n\nfood, and they engage in the business of buying or selling (as meat \n\nbrokers, wholesalers or otherwise) in commerce products of carcasses of \n\nan amenable species. These businesses must also provide access to, and \n\ninspection of, these records by FSIS personnel. Further, under 9 CFR \n\n320.1(a), every person, firm, or corporation required by section 642 of \n\nthe FMIA to keep records must keep those records that will fully and \n\ncorrectly disclose all transactions involved in his or its business \n\nsubject to the Act. Records specifically required to be kept under \n\nsection 320.1(b) include, but are not limited to, bills of sale; \n\ninvoices; bills of lading; and receiving and shipping papers. With \n\nrespect to each transaction, the records must provide the name or \n\ndescription of the livestock or article; the net weight of the \n\nlivestock or article; the number of outside containers; the name and \n\naddress of the buyer or seller of the livestock or animal; and the date \n\nand method of shipment.\n\n\n\n Alternatives: FSIS considered two alternatives to the proposed \n\nrequirements: The status quo and a voluntary recordkeeping program.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Costs occur because about 76,093 \n\nretail stores and official establishments will need to develop and \n\nmaintain records, and make those records available for the Agency's \n\nreview. Using the best available data, FSIS believes that industry \n\nrecordkeeping costs would be approximately $1.46 million. Agency costs \n\nof approximately $0.01 million would result from record reviews at \n\nofficial establishments and retail stores, as well as travel time to \n\nand from retail stores. Annual benefits from this rule come from \n\nestimated averted Shiga toxin-producing E.coli illnesses and averted \n\ncases of Salmonellosis. Non-monetized benefits will accrue to industry \n\ndue to an expected smaller volume of recalls, given everything else \n\nbeing equal, and due to the reduced industry vulnerability to \n\nreputation-damaging food safety events. Avoiding loss of business \n\nreputation is an indirect benefit. The Government will benefit in that \n\nthe rule will enable it to operate in a more efficient manner in \n\nidentifying and tracking recalls of adulterated raw ground beef \n\nproducts. Consumers will benefit from a reduction in foodborne \n\nillnesses due to quicker recalls, correction of process failures at \n\nestablishments producing ground beef, and improved guidance and \n\nindustry practices.\n\n Risks: None.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 07/22/14 79 FR 42464\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 10/22/14 .......................\n\nFinal Action........................ 07/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Agency Contact: Victoria Levine, Program Analyst, Issuances Staff \n\n(IS), Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service, \n\nOffice of Policy and Program Development, 1400 Independence Avenue SW., \n\nRoom 6079, South Building, Washington, DC 20250-3700, Phone: 202 720-\n\n5627, Fax: 202 690-0486, Email: victoria.levine@fsis.usda.gov\n\n RIN: 0583-AD46\n\nUSDA--FOREST SERVICE (FS)\n\nmailto:victoria.levine@fsis.usda.gov\n\n\nFinal Rule Stage\n\n25. Forest Service Manual 2020--Ecological Restoration and Resilience \n\nPolicy\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: FSM 2020\n\n CFR Citation: None.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: This policy establishes a common definition for \n\necological restoration and resilience that is\n\n[[Page 76489]]\n\nconsistent with the 2012 Land Planning rule. The directive provides \n\nadditional guidance in implementing the definition throughout Forest \n\nService program areas by incorporating it into the Forest Service \n\nManual. Restoration objectives span a number of initiatives in various \n\nprogram areas, including the invasive species strategy; recovery of \n\nareas affected by high-severity fires, hurricanes, and other \n\ncatastrophic disturbances; fish habitat restoration and remediation; \n\nriparian area restoration; conservation of threatened and endangered \n\nspecies; and restoration of impaired watersheds and large-scale \n\nwatershed restoration projects. The restoration policy allows agency \n\nemployees to more effectively communicate Forest Service work in \n\nmeeting restoration needs at the local, regional, and national levels. \n\nCurrently an internal Forest Service interim policy for this final \n\ndirective has been implemented in the field units, without any issues. \n\nThis final directive brings the Forest Service policy into alignment \n\nwith current ecological restoration science and with congressional and \n\nForest Service authorizations and initiatives.\n\n Statement of Need: There is a critical need for ecological \n\nrestoration on National Forest System lands and the concept of \n\nrestoration is threaded throughout existing agency authorities and \n\ncollaborative efforts such as the National Fire Plan. However, without \n\na definition in Forest Services' Directive System there has not been \n\nconsistent interpretation and application. This established policy was \n\nnecessary for consistency and for the landscape to better weather \n\ndisturbances, especially under future environmental conditions.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The Forest Service amended the Forest \n\nService Manual (FSM) to add a new title: FSM 2020 Ecological \n\nRestoration and Resilience. This final directive reinforced adaptive \n\nmanagement, use of science, and collaboration in planning and decision \n\nmaking. These foundational land management policies, including use of \n\nrestoration to achieve desired conditions, underwent formal public \n\n\n\nreview during revision of the Planning Rule (36 CFR 219) and amendment \n\nof associated directives (FSM 1900, 1920).\n\n Alternatives: No alternatives were considered as an established \n\npolicy is necessary for agency consistency.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: This final directive had no monetary \n\neffect to the agency or the public. The final directive helped agency \n\nemployees and partners to more effectively communicate restoration \n\nneeds and accomplishments at the local, regional, and national levels.\n\n Risks: There is no risk identified with this rulemaking.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProposed Directive.................. 09/12/13 78 FR 56202\n\nProposed Directive Comment Period 11/12/13 .......................\n\n End.\n\nFinal Directive..................... 02/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Agency Contact: LaRenda C.

A 60-day period, extended for \n\nan additional 15 days, for the public to comment on the proposed \n\ndirectives concluded on May 24, 2013. The proposed directives have been \n\nmailto:larendacking@fs.fed.us\n\n\nrevised, based on public comment, and the agency seeks to publish a \n\nNotice of Availability of the final Directives.\n\n The National Forest Management Act (NFMA) requires that the Forest \n\nService develop land management plans for each unit of the National \n\nForest System, and the agency maintain regulations (Planning Rule) that \n\nguide the development and content of such plans. In addition to formal \n\nregulations, the agency uses its system of directives to provide more \n\ndetailed guidance on how to meet the requirements of the Planning Rule.\n\n Statement of Need: The existing direction in the Forest Service \n\nManual 1920 and the Forest Service Handbook 1909.12 regarding Land \n\nManagement Planning needs to be updated to support implementation of \n\nthe 2012 Planning Rule (36 CFR 219). This brings the planning \n\ndirectives in line with the new planning rule and clarifies substantive \n\nand procedural requirements to implement the rule. The updated \n\ndirectives implements a planning framework that fosters collaboration \n\nwith the public during land management planning, and is science-based, \n\nresponsive to change, and promotes social, economic, and ecological \n\nsustainability.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The Forest Service promulgated a new land \n\nmanagement planning regulation at 36 CFR 219 (the ``2012 Planning \n\nRule''). The final Planning rule and record of decision was published \n\non April 9, 2012 (77 FR 21162).\n\n Alternatives: The Forest Service finalized the directives to bring \n\nthe Forest Services' internal directives in-line with the CFR.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: No new costs to the agency or the \n\npublic are associated with these directives. The amended directives \n\nresults in more effective and efficient planning within the Agency's \n\ncapability.\n\n Risks: There are no risks to the public or to the Forest Service \n\nassociated with this rulemaking.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProposed Directive.................. 02/27/13 78 FR 13316\n\nComment Period End.................. 04/29/13 .......................\n\nFinal Directive..................... 02/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Agency Contact: LaRenda C.

The agency \n\nis authorized under section 9007 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy \n\nAct of 2008 (as amended by the Agricultural Act of 2014) to provide \n\ngrants for energy audits and renewable energy development assistance; \n\ngrants for renewable energy system feasibility studies; and financial \n\nassistance for energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy \n\nsystems. The 2014 Farm Bill directs that at least 20 percent of funds \n\nbe used for grants of $20,000 or less, and up to 4 percent of mandatory \n\nfunds for energy audits and Renewable Energy Development Assistance \n\nGrants. Eligible entities for energy audits and renewable energy \n\ndevelopment assistance include units of State, tribal, or local \n\ngovernment; an instrumentality of a State, tribal, or local government; \n\nland grant or other institutions of higher education; rural electric \n\ncooperatives; RCID Councils or public power entities. Eligible entities \n\nfor financial assistance for energy efficiency improvements and \n\nrenewable energy systems include agricultural producers and rural small \n\nbusinesses. The agency identified REAP as one of the Department's \n\nperiodic retrospective review of regulations under Executive Order \n\n13563, and has proposed a tiered application approach that reduces \n\napplicant burden for technical reports and streamlines the narrative \n\nportion of the application.\n\n Statement of Need: The agency needs to incorporate amendments from \n\nmailto:larendacking@fs.fed.us\n\n\nthe Agricultural Act of 2014. Prior to the Agricultural Act of 2014, \n\nthe agency modified the program to reduce the applicant burden and \n\nimprove program delivery. In order to make these changes to 7 CFR 4280, \n\nsubpart B, a final rule needs to be published.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: REAP was authorized by the 2002 Farm Bill, \n\nand continued by the 2014 Farm Bill which made available $50,000,000 in \n\nmandatory funding for 2014, and each year thereafter through 2018, and \n\nauthorized for appropriations $20,000,000 in discretionary funding for \n\neach fiscal year 2014 through 2018. The program provides for grants and \n\nguaranteed loans for renewable energy systems and energy efficiency \n\nimprovements, and grants for energy audit and renewable energy \n\ndevelopment assistance. The purpose of the program is to reduce the \n\nenergy consumption and increase renewable energy production.\n\n Alternatives: The alternatives are to: (1) Continue operating the \n\nprogram under the 7 CFR 4280, subpart B as it currently is written; (2) \n\nrevise 7 CFR 4280, subpart B based on public comments received on the \n\ninterim rule and issue a final rule.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Benefits of the rule may include a \n\nreduction in energy consumption, an increase in renewable energy \n\nproduction and reduced burden for certain loan and grant applications.\n\n Risks: There are no associated risks to the public health, safety \n\nor the environment.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInterim Final Rule.................. 04/14/11 76 FR 21109\n\nInterim Final Rule Effective........ 04/14/11 .......................\n\nInterim Final Rule Comment Period 06/13/11 .......................\n\n End.\n\nNPRM................................ 04/12/13 78 FR 22044\n\nFinal Action........................ 11/00/14 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Agency Contact: Kelley Oehler, Branch Chief, Department of \n\nAgriculture, Rural Business-Cooperative Service, STOP 3225, 1400 \n\nIndependence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20250-3225, Phone: 202 720-\n\n\n\n6819, Fax: 202 720-2213, Email: kelley.oehler@wdc.usda.gov\n\n RIN: 0570-AA76\n\nUSDA--RBS\n\n28. Business and Industry (B&I) Guaranteed Loan Program\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act\n\n CFR Citation: 7 CFR 4287; 7 CFR 4279.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: The Agency published a proposed rule for the Business and \n\nIndustry Guaranteed Loan Program on September 15, 2014 (78 FR 22044), \n\nwhich, when finalized, would revise the 1996 B&I regulations. While \n\nthere have been some minor modifications to the B&I Guaranteed Loan \n\nProgram regulations since 1996, this action is in response to the \n\nimplement 2014 Farm Bill provisions and makes needed refinements to the \n\nregulation. These changes are design to enhance the program, improve \n\nefficiency, correct minor inconsistencies, clarify the regulations, and \n\nultimately reduce delinquencies. The Agency held several lender \n\nmeetings throughout the country to see how changes to the program could \n\nbenefit lenders who utilize the program. The proposed changes being \n\nconsidered may result in a lower the subsidy rate. The rule, when \n\nfinalized, is intended to increase lending activity, expand business \n\nopportunities, and create more jobs in rural areas, particularly in \n\nareas that have historically experienced economic distress.\n\n Statement of Need: With the passage of the 2014 Farm Bill, there is \n\nthe need to conform certain portions of the B&I Guaranteed Loan Program \n\nregulations with requirements found in the 2014 Farm Bill, such as the \n\naddition of cooperative equity security guarantees, the locally and \n\nregionally grown agricultural food products initiative, and exceptions \n\nto the rural area definition. In addition, with the passage of time, \n\nthe Agency proposed revisions intended to improve program delivery and \n\nadministration, leverage program resources, better align the regulation \n\nwith the program's goals and purposes, clarify the regulations, and \n\nreduce delinquencies and defaults. These proposed revisions may also \n\nimprove program subsidy costs. A reduction in program subsidy costs may \n\nincrease funding availability for additional projects, further \n\nimproving the economic conditions of rural America. This may result in \n\nincreased lending activity, the expansion of business opportunities, \n\nand the creation of more jobs in rural areas.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Consolidated Farm and Rural Development \n\nAct, as amended by the 2008 and 2014 Farm Bill.\n\nmailto:kelley.oehler@wdc.usda.gov\n\n\n Alternatives: The only alternative would be the status quo, which \n\nis not an acceptable alternative.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The benefits of the proposed rule \n\ninclude a possible reduction in loan losses, a lower subsidy rate, and \n\nstreamline program delivery. The program changes have a cumulative \n\neffect of lowering the program cost; however, the amount of the change \n\nin cost cannot be estimated with any reasonable precision.\n\n Risks: There are no associated risks to the public health, safety \n\nor the environment.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProposed Rule....................... 09/15/14 79 FR 55316\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 09/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page 76491]]\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Agency Contact: Brenda Griffin, Loan Specialist, B&I Processing \n\nDivision, Department of Agriculture, Rural Business-Cooperative \n\nService, 1400 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20250, Phone: 202 \n\n720-6802, Fax: 202 720-6003, Email: brenda.griffin@wdc.usda.gov\n\n RIN: 0570-AA85\n\nUSDA--RBS\n\n29.

The 2014 Farm Bill continues the authority \n\nestablished by the 2008 Farm Bill but made changes to the program that \n\nrequire revisions to existing regulations. The 2014 Farm Bill changed \n\nthe program's name to the Biorefinery, Renewable Chemical, and Biobased \n\nProduct Manufacturing Assistance Program and mandated that the program \n\nmailto:brenda.griffin@wdc.usda.gov\n\n\nprovide loan guarantees for the development, construction, and \n\nretrofitting of commercial-scale biorefineries as well as biobased \n\nproduct manufacturing facilities. Increasing production of homegrown \n\nrenewable fuels, chemicals, and biobased products has grown; so has the \n\nneed to develop and produce them. Rural Business--Cooperative Service \n\n(RBS) offers opportunities to producers to develop and manufacture such \n\nproducts through the Biorefinery, Renewable Chemical, and Biobased \n\nProduct Manfacturing Assistance Program. RBS published the Biorefinery \n\nAssistance Program proposed rule in the Federal Register on April 18, \n\n2010, (75 FR 20044) and an interim rule on February 14, 2011, both with \n\n60-day comment periods. Comments were received from biofuel and bio-\n\nproducts producers, banking and investment institutions, attorneys, and \n\nresearch and development companies. In addition to the program changes \n\nrequired by the 2014 Farm Bill, RBS needs to address the comments \n\nreceived to the February 14, 2011, interim rule. The Biorefinery, \n\nRenewable Chemical, and Biobased Product Manufacturing Assistance \n\nProgram focuses on accelerating the commercialization of production of \n\nadvanced biofuels and renewable chemicals, as well as biobased product \n\nmanufacturing.\n\n Statement of Need: The 2014 Farm Bill made changes to the program \n\nthat require revisions to the program rule, and RBS needs to address \n\nthe comments received on the interim rule published on February 14, \n\n2011.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The Biorefinery Assistance Program was \n\nauthorized under the 2008 Farm Bill. The 2014 Farm Bill continues the \n\nauthority and provides $100 million for the program in fiscal year 2014 \n\nand $50 million in both fiscal years 2015 and 2016, of which not more \n\nthan 15 percent can be used for Biobased Product Manufacturing.\n\n Alternatives: The alternatives are: (1) Implement the Section 9003 \n\nprovisions of the Farm Bill immediately through publishing a subsequent \n\ninterim rule. This alternative will require the Department to exercise \n\nthe Hardin memo exemption to implement the Farm Bill amendments; \n\nhowever, it will also enable Rural Development to respond to the \n\ncomments received to the interim rule published in 2011 and incorporate \n\nupdates into the subsequent interim rule. Option 1 is the agency's \n\npreferred alternative. (2) Implement the Section 9003 Farm Bill \n\nprovisions immediately by publishing a final rule. This alternative \n\nwill also require the Department to exercise the Hardin memo exemption \n\n\n\nthe Farm Bill amendments; however, this alternative precludes \n\nstakeholder and public comment to the new rule. (3) Implement the \n\nSection 9003 Farm Bill provisions by publishing a proposed rule. This \n\nalternative is the Department's traditional rulemaking process and \n\nenables public comment, but would delay implementation of the program \n\nand utilization of funding into fiscal year 2015 (or beyond) and may \n\nincrease the risk of a rescission of fiscal year 2014 funds.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Benefits include increase in \n\nrenewable energy/advance biofuel, renewable chemical, and biobased \n\nmanufacturing.\n\n Risks: There are no associated risks to the public health, safety \n\nor the environment.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInterim Final Rule.................. 03/00/15 .......................\n\nInterim Final Rule Effective........ 04/00/15 .......................\n\nInterim Final Rule Comment Period 05/00/15 .......................\n\n End.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Governmental Jurisdictions, \n\nOrganizations.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Agency Contact: Todd Hubbell, Loan Specialist, Specialty Lenders \n\nDivision, Department of Agriculture, Rural Business--Cooperative \n\nService, STOP 3225, 1400 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20250-\n\n3225, Phone: 202 690-2516, Email: todd.hubbell@wdc.usda.gov\n\n RIN: 0570-AA93\n\nUSDA--NATURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION SERVICE (NRCS)\n\nFinal Rule Stage\n\n30.

The consolidated \n\neasement program has two components--an agricultural land easement \n\ncomponent and a wetland reserve easement component. The agricultural \n\nland easement component is patterned after the former FRPP with GRP's \n\nland eligibility components merged into it. The wetland reserve \n\neasement component is patterned after WRP. Land previously enrolled in \n\nthe three contributing programs is considered enrolled in the new ACEP.\n\n Statement of Need: The Agricultural Act of 2014 (2014 Act) \n\nconsolidated several of the Title XII (of the Food Security Act of \n\n1985) conservation easement programs and provided for the continued \n\noperations of former programs. NRCS is promulgating a consolidated \n\nconservation easement regulation to reflect the 2014 Act's \n\nconsolidation of the WRP, FRPP, and GRP programs.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: NRCS seeks to publish an interim rule to \n\nimplement\n\n[[Page 76492]]\n\nthe consolidated conservation easement program. This regulation action \n\nis pursuant to section 1246 of the Food Security Act of 1985, as \n\namended by the 2014 Act, which requires regulations necessary to \n\nimplement Title II of the 2014 Act through an interim rule with request \n\nfor comments.\n\n Alternatives: NRCS determined that rulemaking was the appropriate \n\nmechanism through which to implement the 2014 Act consolidation of the \n\nthree source conservation easement programs. Additionally, NRCS \n\ndetermined that the Agency needs standard criteria for implementing the \n\nprogram and program participants need predictability when initiating an \n\napplication and conveying an easement. The regulation aims to establish \n\na comprehensive framework for working with program participants to \n\nimplement ACEP. Upon consideration of public comment, NRCS will \n\npromulgate final program regulations.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The 2014 Act has consolidated three \n\nconservation easement programs into a single conservation easement \n\nprogram with two components. The program will be implemented under the \n\ngeneral supervision and direction of the Chief of NRCS, who is a Vice \n\nPresident of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). Through ACEP, NRCS \n\nwill continue to purchase wetland reserve easements directly and will \n\ncontribute funds to eligible entities for their purchase of \n\nagricultural land easements that protect working farm and grazing \n\n\n\nlands. Participation in the program is voluntary.\n\n The primary benefits associated with this rulemaking are:\n\n Provides an opportunity for public comment in program \n\nregulations.\n\n Provides a regulatory framework for NRCS to implement a \n\nconsolidated conservation easement program.\n\n Provides transparency to the public potential applicants \n\non NRCS program requirements.\n\n The primary costs imposed by this regulation are:\n\n The costs incurred by private landowners are negative or \n\nzero since this is a voluntary program and they are compensated for the \n\nrights that they transfer.\n\n Other costs incurred by society through market changes are \n\nlocalized or negligible.\n\n Risks: N/A.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInterim Final Rule.................. 12/00/14 .......................\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 07/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Agency Contact: Leslie Deavers, Acting Farm Bill Coordinator, \n\nDepartment of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, 1400 \n\nIndependence Avenue, Washington, DC 20250, Phone: 202 720-5484, Email: \n\nleslie.deavers@wdc.usda.gov\n\n RIN: 0578-AA61\n\nUSDA--NRCS\n\n31. Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) Interim \n\nRule\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 15 U.S.C. 714b and 714c; 16 U.S.C. 3839AA-3839-8\n\n CFR Citation: 7 CFR 1466.\n\n Legal Deadline: Other, Statutory, November 4, 2014, 270 days from \n\nenactment of Public Law 113-79.\n\nmailto:leslie.deavers@wdc.usda.gov\n\n\n Abstract: NRCS promulgated the current EQIP regulation on January \n\n15, 2009 through an interim rule. The interim rule incorporated \n\nprogrammatic changes authorized by the Food, Conservation, and Energy \n\nAct of 2008 (the 2008 Act). NRCS published a correction to the interim \n\nrule on March 12, 2009, and an amendment to the interim rule on May 29, \n\n2009. NRCS has implemented EQIP in FY 2009 through FY 2013 under the \n\ncurrent regulation. The Agricultural Act of 2014 (2014 Act) amended \n\nChapter 4 of Subtitle D of Title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 \n\nby making the following changes to EQIP program requirements: (1) \n\nEliminates requirement that contract must remain in place for a minimum \n\nof 1 year after last practice implemented, but keeps requirement that \n\nthe contract term is not to exceed 10 years, (2) Consolidates elements \n\nof Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP), and repeals WHIP \n\nauthority, (3) Replaces rolling 6-year payment limitation with payment \n\nlimitation for FY 2014-FY 2018, 4) Requires Conservation Innovation \n\nGrants (CIG) reporting no later than December 31, 2014 and every 2 \n\nyears thereafter, (4) Establishes payment limitation established at \n\n$450,000 and eliminates waiver authority, (5) Modifies the special rule \n\nfor foregone income payments for certain associated management \n\npractices and resource concern priorities, (6) Makes advance payments \n\nare available up to 50 percent for eligible historically underserved \n\nparticipants to purchase material or contract services instead of the \n\nprevious 30 percent, (7) Provides flexibility for repayment of advance \n\npayment if not expended within 90 days, and (8) Requires that for each \n\nfiscal year from of the FY 2014 to FY 2018, at least five percent of \n\navailable EQIP funds shall be targeted for wildlife related \n\nconservation practices. The 2014 Act further identifies EQIP as a \n\ncontributing program authorized to accomplish the purposes of the \n\nRegional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) (Subtitle I of Title \n\nXII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended). RCPP replaces the \n\nAgricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP), Chesapeake Bay Watershed \n\nProgram (CBWP), Cooperative Conservation Partnership Initiative (CCPI), \n\nand the Great Lakes Basin Program for soil erosion and sediment \n\ncontrol. Like the programs it replaces, RCPP will operate through \n\nregulations in place for contributing programs. The other contributing \n\nprograms include the Conservation Stewardship Program, the Healthy \n\nForests Reserve Program, and the new Agricultural Conservation Easement \n\nProgram (ACEP). NRCS seeks to publish an interim rule to incorporate \n\nthe 2014 Act changes to EQIP program administration. This regulation \n\naction is pursuant to Section 1246 of the Food Security Act of 1985, as \n\namended by section 2608 of the 2014 Act, which requires regulations \n\n\n\nnecessary to implement Title II of the 2014 Act be promulgated through \n\nthe interim rule process.\n\n Statement of Need: The Agricultural Act of 2014 (the 2014 Act) \n\nconsolidated several of the Title XII conservation programs and \n\nprovided for the continued operations of former programs. NRCS is \n\nupdating the EQIP regulation to incorporate the 2014 Act changes, \n\nincluding consolidation of the purposes formerly addressed through the \n\nWildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP).\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The 2014 Act has reauthorized and amended \n\nthe Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). EQIP was first \n\nadded to the Food Security Act of 1985 (1985 Act) (16 U.S.C. 3801 et \n\nseq.) by the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 \n\n(1996 Act) (16 U.S.C. 3839aa). The program is implemented under the \n\ngeneral supervision and direction of the Chief of NRCS, who is a Vice \n\nPresident of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC).\n\n Alternatives: NRCS considered only making the changes mandated by \n\nthe 2014 Farm Bill.

Conservation Stewardship Program Interim Rule\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 16 U.S.C. 3838d to 3838g.\n\n CFR Citation: 7 CFR 1470.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: NRCS seeks to publish an interim rule to incorporate the \n\n2014 Act changes to Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) program \n\nadministration. This regulation action is pursuant to Section 1246 of \n\nthe Food Security Act of 1985, as amended by the 2014 Act, which \n\nrequires regulations necessary to implement Title II of the 2014 Act \n\nthrough an interim rule with request for comments. Background: The \n\nFood, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 Act (2008 Act) amended the \n\nFood Security Act of 1985 (1985 Act) to establish CSP and authorize the \n\nprogram in fiscal years 2009 through 2013. The Agriculture Act of 2014 \n\n(the 2014 Act) re-authorizes and revises CSP. The purpose of CSP is to \n\nencourage producers to address priority resource concerns and improve \n\nand conserve the quality and condition of the natural resources in a \n\ncomprehensive manner by: (1) Undertaking additional conservation \n\nactivities; and (2) improving, maintaining, and managing existing \n\nconservation activities. The Secretary of Agriculture delegated \n\nauthority to the Chief, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), \n\nmailto:leslie.deavers@wdc.usda.gov\n\n\nto administer CSP. Through CSP, NRCS provides financial and technical \n\nassistance to eligible producers to conserve and enhance soil, water, \n\nair, and related natural resources on their land. Eligible lands \n\ninclude private or tribal cropland, grassland, pastureland, rangeland, \n\nnon-industrial private forest lands and other land in agricultural \n\nareas (including cropped woodland, marshes, and agricultural land or \n\ncapable of being used for the production of livestock) on which \n\nresource concerns related to agricultural production could be \n\naddressed. Participation in the program is voluntary. CSP encourages \n\nland stewards to improve their conservation performance by installing \n\nand adopting additional activities, and improving, maintaining, and \n\nmanaging existing activities on eligible land. NRCS makes funding for \n\nCSP available nationwide on a continuous application basis.\n\n Statement of Need: The Agricultural Act of 2014 (the 2014 Act) \n\namended several of the Title XII conservation programs and provided for \n\nthe continued operations of former programs. NRCS is updating the CSP \n\nregulation to incorporate the 2014 Act changes.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The 2014 Act has reauthorized and amended \n\nthe Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP). CSP was first added to the \n\nFood Security Act of 1985 (1985 Act) (16 U.S.C. 3801 et seq.) by the \n\nFood, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008. The program is implemented \n\nunder the general supervision and direction of the Chief of NRCS, who \n\nis a Vice President of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC).\n\n Alternatives: NRCS considered only making the changes mandated by \n\nthe 2014 Farm Bill. This alternative would have missed opportunities to \n\nimprove the implementation of the program. NRCS would consider \n\nalternatives suggested during the public comment period.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: CSP is a voluntary program that \n\nencourages agricultural and forestry producers to address priority \n\nresource concerns by: (1) Undertaking additional conservation \n\nactivities, and (2) improving and maintaining existing conservation \n\nsystems. CSP provides financial and technical assistance to help land \n\nstewards conserve and enhance soil, water, air, and related natural \n\nresources on their land.\n\n CSP is available to all producers, regardless of operation size or \n\ncrops produced, in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the \n\nCaribbean and Pacific Island areas. Eligible lands include cropland, \n\ngrassland, prairie land, improved pastureland, rangeland, nonindustrial \n\nprivate forest land, and agricultural land under the jurisdiction of an \n\nIndian tribe. Applicants may include individuals, legal entities, joint \n\noperations, or Indian tribes.\n\n CSP pays participants for conservation performance the higher the \n\n\n\nperformance, the higher the payment. It provides two possible types of \n\npayments. An annual payment is available for installing new \n\nconservation activities and maintaining existing practices. A \n\nsupplemental payment is available to participants who also adopt a \n\nresource conserving crop rotation.\n\n Through five-year contracts, NRCS makes payments as soon as \n\npractical after October 1 of each fiscal year for contract activities \n\ninstalled and maintained in the previous year. A person or legal entity \n\nmay have more than one CSP contract but, for all CSP contracts \n\ncombined, may not receive more than $40,000 in any year or more than \n\n$200,000 during any five-year period.\n\n The primary benefits associated with this rulemaking are:\n\n Provides continued consistency for the NRCS to implement \n\nCSP.\n\n Provides transparency to potential applicants on NRCS \n\nprogram requirements.\n\n The primary costs imposed by this regulation are that all program \n\nparticipants must follow the same basic programmatic requirements, even \n\nthough they are very different types of agricultural operations in \n\ndifferent resource contexts.\n\n The 2014 Act further identifies CSP as a contributing program \n\nauthorized to accomplish the purposes of the Regional Conservation \n\nPartnership Program\n\n[[Page 76494]]\n\n(RCPP) (subtitle I of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as \n\namended). RCPP replaces the Agricultural Water Enhancement Program \n\n(AWEP), Chesapeake Bay Watershed Program (CBWP), Cooperative \n\nConservation Partnership Initiative (CCPI), and the Great Lakes Basin \n\nProgram for soil erosion and sediment control. Like the programs it \n\nreplaces, RCPP will operate through regulations in place for \n\ncontributing programs. The other contributing programs include the \n\nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program, the Healthy Forests Reserve \n\nProgram, and the new Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP).\n\n Risks: N/A.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInterim Final Rule.................. 11/05/14 79 FR 65835\n\nInterim Final Rule Effective........ 11/05/14 .......................\n\n\n\nInterim Final Rule Comment Period 01/05/15 .......................\n\n End.\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 07/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Agency Contact: Leslie Deavers, Acting Farm Bill Coordinator, \n\nDepartment of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, 1400 \n\nIndependence Avenue, Washington, DC 20250, Phone: 202 720-5484, Email: \n\nleslie.deavers@wdc.usda.gov\n\n RIN: 0578-AA63\n\nBILLING CODE 3410-90-S\n\nDEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE (DOC)\n\nStatement of Regulatory and Deregulatory Priorities\n\n Established in 1903, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) is one \n\nof the oldest Cabinet-level agencies in the Federal Government. \n\nCommerce's mission is to create the conditions for economic growth and \n\nopportunity by promoting innovation, entrepreneurship, competitiveness, \n\nand environmental stewardship. Commerce has 12 operating units, which \n\nare responsible for managing a diverse portfolio of programs and \n\nservices, ranging from trade promotion and economic development \n\nassistance to broadband and the National Weather Service.\n\n Commerce touches Americans daily, in many ways--making possible the \n\ndaily weather reports and survey research; facilitating technology that \n\nall of us use in the workplace and in the home each day; supporting the \n\ndevelopment, gathering, and transmission of information essential to \n\ncompetitive business; enabling the diversity of companies and goods \n\nfound in America's and the world's marketplace; and supporting \n\nenvironmental and economic health for the communities in which \n\nAmericans live.\n\n Commerce has a clear and compelling vision for itself, for its role \n\nin the Federal Government, and for its roles supporting the American \n\npeople, now and in the future. To achieve this vision, Commerce works \n\nin partnership with businesses, universities, communities, and workers \n\nto:\n\n Innovate by creating new ideas through cutting-edge \n\nscience and technology from advances in nanotechnology, to ocean \n\nexploration, to broadband deployment, and by protecting American \n\ninnovations through the patent and trademark system;\n\nmailto:leslie.deavers@wdc.usda.gov\n\n\n Support entrepreneurship and commercialization by enabling \n\ncommunity development and strengthening minority businesses and small \n\nmanufacturers;\n\n Maintain U.S. economic competitiveness in the global \n\nmarketplace by promoting exports, ensuring a level playing field for \n\nU.S. businesses, and ensuring that technology transfer is consistent \n\nwith our nation's economic and security interests;\n\n Provide effective management and stewardship of our \n\nnation's resources and assets to ensure sustainable economic \n\nopportunities; and\n\n Make informed policy decisions and enable better \n\nunderstanding of the economy by providing accurate economic and \n\ndemographic data.\n\n Commerce is a vital resource base, a tireless advocate, and \n\nCabinet-level voice for job creation.\n\n The Regulatory Plan tracks the most important regulations that \n\nimplement these policy and program priorities, several of which involve \n\nregulation of the private sector by Commerce.\n\nResponding to the Administration's Regulatory Philosophy and Principles\n\n The vast majority of the Commerce's programs and activities do not \n\ninvolve regulation. Of Commerce's 12 primary operating units, only the \n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will be planning \n\nactions that are considered the ``most important'' significant \n\npreregulatory or regulatory actions for FY 2015. During the next year, \n\nNOAA plans to publish five rulemaking actions that are designated as \n\nRegulatory Plan actions. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) may \n\nalso publish rulemaking actions designated as Regulatory Plan actions. \n\nFurther information on these actions is provided below.\n\n Commerce has a long-standing policy to prohibit the issuance of any \n\nregulation that discriminates on the basis of race, religion, gender, \n\nor any other suspect category and requires that all regulations be \n\nwritten so as to be understandable to those affected by them. The \n\nSecretary also requires that Commerce afford the public the maximum \n\npossible opportunity to participate in Departmental rulemakings, even \n\nwhere public participation is not required by law.\n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n\n NOAA establishes and administers Federal policy for the \n\nconservation and management of the Nation's oceanic, coastal, and \n\natmospheric resources. It provides a variety of essential environmental \n\n\n\nand climate services vital to public safety and to the Nation's \n\neconomy, such as weather forecasts, drought forecasts, and storm \n\nwarnings. It is a source of objective information on the state of the \n\nenvironment. NOAA plays the lead role in achieving Commerce's goal of \n\npromoting stewardship by providing assessments of the global \n\nenvironment.\n\n Recognizing that economic growth must go hand-in-hand with \n\nenvironmental stewardship, Commerce, through NOAA, conducts programs \n\ndesigned to provide a better understanding of the connections between \n\nenvironmental health, economics, and national security. Commerce's \n\nemphasis on ``sustainable fisheries'' is designed to boost long-term \n\neconomic growth in a vital sector of the U.S. economy while conserving \n\nthe resources in the public trust and minimizing any economic \n\ndislocation necessary to ensure long-term economic growth. Commerce is \n\nwhere business and environmental interests intersect, and the classic \n\ndebate on the use of natural resources is transformed into a ``win-\n\nwin'' situation for the environment and the economy.\n\n Three of NOAA's major components, the National Marine Fisheries \n\nServices (NMFS), the National Ocean Service (NOS), and the National \n\nEnvironmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), \n\nexercise regulatory authority.\n\n NMFS oversees the management and conservation of the Nation's \n\nmarine\n\n[[Page 76495]]\n\nfisheries, protects threatened and endangered marine and anadromous \n\nspecies and marine mammals, and promotes economic development of the \n\nU.S. fishing industry. NOS assists the coastal States in their \n\nmanagement of land and ocean resources in their coastal zones, \n\nincluding estuarine research reserves; manages the national marine \n\nsanctuaries; monitors marine pollution; and directs the national \n\nprogram for deep-seabed minerals and ocean thermal energy. NESDIS \n\nadministers the civilian weather satellite program and licenses private \n\norganizations to operate commercial land-remote sensing satellite \n\nsystems.\n\n Commerce, through NOAA, has a unique role in promoting stewardship \n\nof the global environment through effective management of the Nation's \n\nmarine and coastal resources and in monitoring and predicting changes \n\nin the Earth's environment, thus linking trade, development, and \n\ntechnology with environmental issues. NOAA has the primary Federal \n\nresponsibility for providing sound scientific observations, \n\nassessments, and forecasts of environmental phenomena on which resource \n\n\n\nmanagement, adaptation, and other societal decisions can be made.\n\n In the environmental stewardship area, NOAA's goals include: \n\nRebuilding and maintaining strong U.S. fisheries by using market-based \n\ntools and ecosystem approaches to management; increasing the \n\npopulations of depleted, threatened, or endangered species and marine \n\nmammals by implementing recovery plans that provide for their recovery \n\nwhile still allowing for economic and recreational opportunities; \n\npromoting healthy coastal ecosystems by ensuring that economic \n\ndevelopment is managed in ways that maintain biodiversity and long-term \n\nproductivity for sustained use; and modernizing navigation and \n\npositioning services. In the environmental assessment and prediction \n\narea, goals include: Understanding climate change science and impacts, \n\nand communicating that understanding to government and private sector \n\nstakeholders enabling them to adapt; continually improving the National \n\nWeather Service; implementing reliable seasonal and interannual climate \n\nforecasts to guide economic planning; providing science-based policy \n\nadvice on options to deal with very long-term (decadal to centennial) \n\nchanges in the environment; and advancing and improving short-term \n\nwarning and forecast services for the entire environment.\n\nMagnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act\n\n Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-\n\nStevens Act) rulemakings concern the conservation and management of \n\nfishery resources in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (generally 3-200 \n\nnautical miles). Among the several hundred rulemakings that NOAA plans \n\nto issue in FY 2015, a number of the preregulatory and regulatory \n\nactions will be significant. The exact number of such rulemakings is \n\nunknown, since they are usually initiated by the actions of eight \n\nregional Fishery Management Councils (FMCs) that are responsible for \n\npreparing fishery management plans (FMPs) and FMP amendments, and for \n\ndrafting implementing regulations for each managed fishery. NOAA issues \n\nregulations to implement FMPs and FMP amendments. Once a rulemaking is \n\ntriggered by an FMC, the Magnuson-Stevens Act places stringent \n\ndeadlines upon NOAA by which it must exercise its rulemaking \n\nresponsibilities. FMPs and FMP amendments for Atlantic highly migratory \n\nspecies, such as bluefin tuna, swordfish, and sharks, are developed \n\ndirectly by NOAA, not by FMCs.\n\n FMPs address a variety of issues including maximizing fishing \n\nopportunities on healthy stocks, rebuilding overfished stocks, and \n\naddressing gear conflicts. One of the problems that FMPs may address is \n\npreventing overcapitalization (preventing excess fishing capacity) of \n\nfisheries. This may be resolved by market-based systems such as catch \n\nshares, which permit shareholders to harvest a quantity of fish and \n\n\n\nwhich can be traded on the open market. Harvest limits based on the \n\nbest available scientific information, whether as a total fishing limit \n\nfor a species in a fishery or as a share assigned to each vessel \n\nparticipant, enable stressed stocks to rebuild. Other measures include \n\nstaggering fishing seasons or limiting gear types to avoid gear \n\nconflicts on the fishing grounds and establishing seasonal and area \n\nclosures to protect fishery stocks.\n\n The FMCs provide a forum for public debate and, using the best \n\nscientific information available, make the judgments needed to \n\ndetermine optimum yield on a fishery-by-fishery basis. Optional \n\nmanagement measures are examined and selected in accordance with the \n\nnational standards set forth in the Magnuson-Stevens Act. This process, \n\nincluding the selection of the preferred management measures, \n\nconstitutes the development, in simplified form, of an FMP. The FMP, \n\ntogether with draft implementing regulations and supporting \n\ndocumentation, is submitted to NMFS for review against the national \n\nstandards set forth in the Magnuson-Stevens Act, in other provisions of \n\nthe Act, and other applicable laws. The same process applies to \n\namending an existing approved FMP.\n\nMarine Mammal Protection Act\n\n The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA) provides the \n\nauthority for the conservation and management of marine mammals under \n\nU.S. jurisdiction. It expressly prohibits, with certain exceptions, the \n\ntake of marine mammals. The MMPA allows NMFS to permit the collection \n\nof wild animals for scientific research or public display or to enhance \n\nthe survival of a species or stock. NMFS initiates rulemakings under \n\nthe MMPA to establish a management regime to reduce marine mammal \n\nmortalities and injuries as a result of interactions with fisheries. \n\nThe MMPA also established the Marine Mammal Commission, which makes \n\nrecommendations to the Secretaries of the Departments of Commerce and \n\nthe Interior and other Federal officials on protecting and conserving \n\nmarine mammals. The Act underwent significant changes in 1994 to allow \n\nfor takings incidental to commercial fishing operations, to provide \n\ncertain exemptions for subsistence and scientific uses, and to require \n\nthe preparation of stock assessments for all marine mammal stocks in \n\nwaters under U.S. jurisdiction.\n\nEndangered Species Act\n\n The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) provides for the \n\nconservation of species that are determined to be ``endangered'' or \n\n``threatened,'' and the conservation of the ecosystems on which these \n\nspecies depend. The ESA authorizes both NMFS and the Fish and Wildlife \n\n\n\nService (FWS) to jointly administer the provisions of the MMPA. NMFS \n\nmanages marine and ``anadromous'' species, and FWS manages land and \n\nfreshwater species. Together, NMFS and FWS work to protect critically \n\nimperiled species from extinction. Of the approximately 1,300 listed \n\nspecies found in part or entirely in the United States and its waters, \n\nNMFS has jurisdiction over approximately 60 species. NMFS' rulemaking \n\nactions are focused on determining whether any species under its \n\nresponsibility is an endangered or threatened species and whether those \n\nspecies must be added to the list of\n\n[[Page 76496]]\n\nprotected species. NMFS is also responsible for designating, reviewing, \n\nand revising critical habitat for any listed species. In addition, \n\nunder the ESA's procedural framework, Federal agencies consult with \n\nNMFS on any proposed action authorized, funded, or carried out by that \n\nagency that may affect one of the listed species or designated critical \n\nhabitat, or is likely to jeopardize proposed species or adversely \n\nmodify proposed critical habitat that is under NMFS' jurisdiction.\n\nNOAA's Regulatory Plan Actions\n\n While most of the rulemakings undertaken by NOAA do not rise to the \n\nlevel necessary to be included in Commerce's regulatory plan, NMFS is \n\nundertaking five actions that rise to the level of ``most important'' \n\nof Commerce's significant regulatory actions and thus are included in \n\nthis year's regulatory plan. A description of the five regulatory plan \n\nactions is provided below.\n\n 1. Revisions to the General section and Standards 1, 3, and 7 of \n\nthe National Standard Guidelines (0648-BB92): This action would propose \n\nrevisions to the National Standard 1 (NS1) guidelines. National \n\nStandard 1 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management \n\nAct states that ``conservation and management measures shall prevent \n\noverfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield \n\nfrom each fishery for the United States fishing industry.'' The \n\nNational Marine Fisheries Service last revised the NS1 Guidelines in \n\n2009 to reflect the requirements enacted by the Magnuson-Stevens \n\nFishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 for \n\nannual catch limits and accountability measures to end and prevent \n\noverfishing. Since 2007, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) \n\nand the Regional Fishery Management Councils have been implementing the \n\nnew annual catch limit and accountability measures requirements. Based \n\non experience gained from implementing annual catch limits and \n\naccountability measures, NMFS has developed new perspectives and \n\nidentified issues regarding the application of the NS1 guidelines that \n\nmay warrant them to be revised to more fully meet the intended goal of \n\n\n\npreventing overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the \n\noptimum yield from each fishery. The focus of this action is to improve \n\nthe NS1 guidelines.\n\n 2. Proposed Rule To Designate Critical Habitat for North Atlantic \n\nRight Whale (0648-AY54): The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) \n\nproposes to revise critical habitat for the North Atlantic right whale. \n\nThis proposal would modify the critical habitat previously designated \n\nin 1994.\n\n 3. Fishery Management Plan for Regulating Offshore Marine \n\nAquaculture in the Gulf of Mexico (0648-AS65): The purpose of this \n\nfishery management plan is to develop a regional permitting process for \n\nregulating and promoting environmentally sound and economically \n\nsustainable aquaculture in the Gulf of Mexico exclusive economic zone. \n\nThis fishery management plan consists of ten actions, each with an \n\nassociated range of management alternatives, which would facilitate the \n\npermitting of an estimated 5 to 20 offshore aquaculture operations in \n\nthe Gulf of Mexico over the next 10 years, with an estimated annual \n\nproduction of up to 64 million pounds. By establishing a regional \n\npermitting process for aquaculture, the Gulf of Mexico Fishery \n\nManagement Council will be positioned to achieve their primary goal of \n\nincreasing maximum sustainable yield and optimum yield of federal \n\nfisheries in the Gulf of Mexico by supplementing harvest of wild caught \n\nspecies with cultured product. This rulemaking would outline a \n\nregulatory permitting process for aquaculture in the Gulf of Mexico, \n\nincluding: (1) Required permits; (2) duration of permits; (3) species \n\nallowed; (4) designation of sites for aquaculture; (5) reporting \n\nrequirements; and (6) regulations to aid in enforcement.\n\n 4. Requirements for Importation of Fish and Fish Products Under the \n\nU.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (0648-AY15): With this action, the \n\nNational Marine Fisheries Service is developing procedures to implement \n\nthe provisions of section 101(a)(2) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act \n\nfor imports of fish and fish products. Those provisions require the \n\nSecretary of Treasury to ban imports of fish and fish products from \n\nfisheries with bycatch of marine mammals in excess of U.S. standards. \n\nThe provisions further require the Secretary of Commerce to insist on \n\nreasonable proof from exporting nations of the effects on marine \n\nmammals of bycatch incidental to fisheries that harvest the fish and \n\nfish products to be imported.\n\n 5. Revised Proposed Rule To Designate Critical Habitat for the \n\nHawaiian Monk Seal (0648-BA81): The National Marine Fisheries Service \n\n\n\n(NMFS) is developing a rule to designate critical habitat for the \n\nHawaiian monk seal in the main and Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. In \n\nresponse to a 2008 petition from the Center for Biological Diversity, \n\nKahea, and the Ocean Conservancy to revise Hawaiian monk seal critical \n\nhabitat, NMFS published a proposed rule in June 2011 to revise Hawaiian \n\nmonk seal critical habitat by adding critical habitat in the main \n\nHawaiian Islands and extending critical habitat in the Northwestern \n\nHawaiian Islands. Proposed critical habitat includes both marine and \n\nterrestrial habitats (e.g., foraging areas to 500 meter depth, pupping \n\nbeaches, etc.). To address public comments on the proposed rule, NOAA \n\nFisheries is augmenting its prior economic analysis to better describe \n\nthe anticipated costs of the designation. NOAA Fisheries is analyzing \n\nnew tracking data to assess monk seal habitat use in the main Hawaiian \n\nIslands.\n\n At this time, NOAA is unable to determine the aggregate cost of the \n\nidentified Regulatory Plan actions as several of these actions are \n\ncurrently under development.\n\nBureau of Industry and Security\n\n The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) advances U.S. national \n\nsecurity, foreign policy, and economic objectives by maintaining and \n\nstrengthening adaptable, efficient, and effective export control and \n\ntreaty compliance systems as well as by administering programs to \n\nprioritize certain contracts to promote the national defense and to \n\nprotect and enhance the defense industrial base.\n\n In August 2009, the President directed a broad-based interagency \n\nreview of the U.S. export control system with the goal of strengthening \n\nnational security and the competitiveness of key U.S. manufacturing and \n\ntechnology sectors by focusing on the current threats and adapting to \n\nthe changing economic and technological landscape. In August 2010, the \n\nPresident outlined an approach under which agencies that administer \n\nexport controls will apply new criteria for determining what items need \n\nto be controlled and a common set of policies for determining when an \n\nexport license is required. The control list criteria are to be based \n\non transparent rules, which will reduce the uncertainty faced by our \n\nAllies, U.S. industry and its foreign customers, and will allow the \n\nGovernment to erect higher walls around the most sensitive export items \n\nin order to enhance national security.\n\n Under the President's approach, agencies will apply the criteria \n\nand revise the lists of munitions and dual-use items that are \n\ncontrolled for export so that they:\n\n Distinguish the types of items that should be subject to stricter \n\n\n\nor more\n\n[[Page 76497]]\n\npermissive levels of control for different destinations, end-uses, and \n\nend-users;\n\n Create a ``bright line'' between the two current control lists to \n\nclarify jurisdictional determinations and reduce Government and \n\nindustry uncertainty about whether particular items are subject to the \n\ncontrol of the State Department or the Commerce Department; and\n\n Are structurally aligned so that they potentially can be combined \n\ninto a single list of controlled items.\n\n BIS' current regulatory plan action is designed to implement the \n\ninitial phase of the President's directive, which will add to BIS' \n\nexport control purview, military related items that the President \n\ndetermines no longer warrant control under rules administered by the \n\nState Department.\n\nMajor Programs and Activities\n\n BIS administers four sets of regulations. The Export Administration \n\nRegulations (EAR) regulate exports and reexports to protect national \n\nsecurity, foreign policy, and short supply interests. The EAR also \n\nregulates participation of U.S. persons in certain boycotts \n\nadministered by foreign Governments. The National Defense Industrial \n\nBase Regulations provide for prioritization of certain contracts and \n\nallocations of resources to promote the national defense, require \n\nreporting of foreign Government-imposed offsets in defense sales, and \n\naddress the effect of imports on the defense industrial base. The \n\nChemical Weapons Convention Regulations implement declaration, \n\nreporting, and on-site inspection requirements in the private sector \n\nnecessary to meet United States treaty obligations under the Chemical \n\nWeapons Convention treaty. The Additional Protocol Regulations \n\nimplement similar requirements with respect to an agreement between the \n\nUnited States and the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\n BIS also has an enforcement component with nine offices with \n\nenforcement responsibilities covering the United States. BIS export \n\ncontrol officers are also stationed at several U.S. embassies and \n\nconsulates abroad. BIS works with other U.S. Government agencies to \n\npromote coordinated U.S. Government efforts in export controls and \n\nother programs. BIS participates in U.S. Government efforts to \n\nstrengthen multilateral export control regimes and to promote effective \n\nexport controls through cooperation with other Governments.\n\nBIS' Regulatory Plan Actions\n\n As the agency responsible for leading the administration and \n\n\n\nenforcement of U.S. export controls on dual-use and other items \n\nwarranting controls but not under the provisions of export control \n\nregulations administered by other departments, BIS plays a central role \n\nin the Administration's efforts to fundamentally reform the export \n\ncontrol system. Changing what we control, how we control it and how we \n\nenforce and manage our controls will help strengthen our national \n\nsecurity by focusing our efforts on controlling the most critical \n\nproducts and technologies, and by enhancing the competitiveness of key \n\nU.S. manufacturing and technology sectors.\n\n In FY 2011, BIS took several steps to implement the President's \n\nExport Control Reform Initiative (ECRI). BIS published a final rule (76 \n\nFR 35275, June 16, 2011) implementing a license exception that \n\nauthorizes exports, reexports and transfers to destinations that do not \n\npose a national security concern, provided certain safeguards against \n\ndiversion to other destinations are taken. BIS also proposed several \n\nrules to control under the EAR items that the President has determined \n\ndo not warrant control under the International Traffic in Arms \n\nRegulations (ITAR), administered by the Department of State rule (76 FR \n\n41957), and its United States Munitions List (USML).\n\n In FY 2012, BIS followed up on its FY 2011 successes with the ECRI \n\nand proposed rules that would move items currently controlled in nine \n\ncategories of the USML to control under the Commerce Control List \n\n(CCL), administered by BIS. In addition, BIS proposed a rule to ease \n\nthe implementation process for transitioning items and re-proposed a \n\nrevised key definition from the July 15 Rule, ``specially designed,'' \n\nthat had received extensive public comment. In FY 2013, after State \n\nDepartment notification to Congress of the transfer of items from the \n\nUSML, BIS expects to be able to publish a final rule incorporating many \n\nof the proposed changes and revisions based on public responses to the \n\nproposals.\n\n In FY 2013, BIS activities crossed an important milestone with \n\npublication of two final rules that began to put ECRI policies into \n\nplace. An Initial Implementation rule (73 FR 22660, April 16, 2013) \n\nsets in place the structure under which items the President determines \n\nno longer warrant control on the United States Munitions List will be \n\ncontrolled on the Commerce Control List. It also revises license \n\nexceptions and regulatory definitions, including the definition of \n\n``specially designed'' to more make those exceptions and definitions \n\n\n\nclearer and to more close align them with the International Traffic in \n\nArms Regulations, and adds to the CCL certain military aircraft, gas \n\nturbine engines and related items. A second final rule (78 FR 40892, \n\nJuly 8 2012) followed on by adding to the CCL military vehicles, \n\nvessels of war submersible vessels, and auxiliary military equipment \n\nthat President determined no longer warrant control on the USML.\n\n In FY 2014, BIS continued its emphasis on the ECRI by publishing \n\nthree final rules adding to the Commerce Control List, items the \n\nPresident determined no long warrant control on the United States \n\nMunitions List (including a rule returning jurisdiction over Commercial \n\nSatellites to the Department of Commerce), as follows:\n\n January 2--Control of Military Training Equipment, Energetic \n\nMaterials, Personal Protective Equipment, Shelters, Articles Related to \n\nLaunch Vehicles, Missiles, Rockets, Military Explosives and Related \n\nItems;\n\n May 13--Revisions to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR): \n\nControl of Spacecraft Systems and Related Items the President \n\nDetermines No Longer Warrant Control Under the United States Munitions \n\nList (USML); and\n\n July 1--Revisions to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR): \n\nControl of Military Electronic Equipment and Other Items the President \n\nDetermines No Longer Warrant Control Under the United States Munitions \n\nList\n\n BIS expects to publish additional ECRI final rules in FY 2015.\n\nPromoting International Regulatory Cooperation\n\n As the President noted in Executive Order 13609, ``international \n\nregulatory cooperation, consistent with domestic law and prerogatives \n\nand U.S. trade policy, can be an important means of promoting'' public \n\nhealth, welfare, safety, and our environment as well as economic \n\ngrowth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation. Accordingly, in \n\nEO 13609, the President requires each executive agency to include in \n\nits Regulatory Plan a summary of its international regulatory \n\ncooperation activities that are reasonably anticipated to lead to \n\nsignificant regulations.\n\n The Department of Commerce engages with numerous international \n\nbodies in\n\n[[Page 76498]]\n\nvarious forums to promote the Department's priorities and foster \n\nregulations that do not ``impair the ability of American business to \n\n\n\nexport and compete internationally.'' EO 13609(a). For example, the \n\nUnited States Patent and Trademark Office is working with the European \n\nPatent Office to develop a new classification system for both offices' \n\nuse. The Bureau of Industry and Security, along with the Department of \n\nState and Department of Defense, engages with other countries in the \n\nWassenaar Arrangement, through which the international community \n\ndevelops a common list of items that should be subject to export \n\ncontrols because they are conventional arms or items that have both \n\nmilitary and civil uses. Other multilateral export control regimes \n\ninclude the Missile Technology Control Regime, the Nuclear Suppliers \n\nGroup, and the Australia Group, which lists items controlled for \n\nchemical and biological weapon nonproliferation purposes. In addition, \n\nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration works with other \n\ncountries' regulatory bodies through regional fishery management \n\norganizations to develop fair and internationally-agreed-to fishery \n\nstandards for the High Seas.\n\n BIS is also engaged, in partnership with the Departments of State \n\nand Defense, in revising the regulatory framework for export control, \n\nthrough the President's Export Control Reform Initiative (ECRI). \n\nThrough this effort, the United States Government is moving certain \n\nitems currently controlled by the United States Military List (USML) to \n\nthe Commerce Control List (CCL) in BIS' Export Administration \n\nRegulations. The objective of ECRI is to improve interoperability of \n\nU.S. military forces with those of allied countries, strengthen the \n\nU.S. industrial base by, among other things, reducing incentives for \n\nforeign manufacturers to design out and avoid U.S.-origin content and \n\nservices, and allow export control officials to focus Government \n\nresources on transactions that pose greater concern. Once fully \n\nimplemented, the new export control framework also will benefit \n\ncompanies in the United States seeking to export items through more \n\nflexible and less burdensome export controls.\n\nRetrospective Review of Existing Regulations\n\n Pursuant to section 6 of Executive Order 13563 ``Improving \n\nRegulation and Regulatory Review'' (Jan. 18, 2011), the Department has \n\nidentified several rulemakings as being associated with retrospective \n\nreview and analysis in the Department's final retrospective review of \n\nregulations plan. Accordingly, the Agency is reviewing these rules to \n\ndetermine whether action under E.O. 13563 is appropriate. Some of these \n\nentries on this list may be completed actions, which do not appear in \n\nThe Regulatory Plan. However, more information can be found about these \n\ncompleted rulemakings in past publications of the Unified Agenda on \n\nReginfo.gov in the Completed Actions section for the Agency. These \n\n\n\nrulemakings can also be found on Regulations.gov. The final Agency \n\nretrospective analysis plan can be found at: \nhttp://open.commerce.gov/sites/default/files/Commerce%20Plan%20for%20Retrospective%20Analysis%20of%20E\nxisting%20Rules%20-%202011-08-22%20Final.pdf\n\nDOC--National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\n\nProposed Rule Stage\n\n33. Requirements for Importation of Fish and Fish Product Under the \n\nU.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1371 et seq.\n\n CFR Citation: 50 CFR 216.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: With this action, NMFS is developing procedures to \n\nimplement the provisions of section 101(a)(2) of the Marine Mammal \n\nProtection Act for imports of fish and fish products. Those provisions \n\nrequire the Secretary of Treasury to ban imports of fish and fish \n\nproducts from fisheries with bycatch of marine mammals in excess of \n\nU.S. standards. The provisions further require the Secretary of \n\nCommerce to insist on reasonable proof from exporting nations of the \n\neffects on marine mammals of bycatch incidental to fisheries that \n\nharvest the fish and fish products to be imported. Implementation of \n\nthis rule may have trade implications. However, the impacts will be \n\nlimited primarily to foreign entities, with no anticipated impacts to \n\nU.S. fishermen.\n\n Statement of Need: The Marine Mammal Protection Act requires that \n\nthe United States prohibit imports of fish caught in a manner that \n\nresults in bycatch of marine mammals in excess of U.S. standards.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Marine Mammal Protection Act.\n\n Alternatives: An alternative to this rulemaking that would \n\nfacilitate marine mammal conservation overseas would be through \n\ncooperation and assistance programs. While the U.S. has developed \n\neffective bycatch mitigation techniques and applied these in many \n\nfisheries, there is no guarantee that these methods will be freely \n\nadopted in foreign fisheries. Technical and financial assistance for \n\nthe development and implementation of marine mammal bycatch mitigation \n\nmeasures would not be precluded by this rulemaking, but market access \n\nincentives will increase the likelihood of action by harvesting nations \n\nexporting to the U.S.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Potential benefits of this \n\nhttp://open.commerce.gov/sites/default/files/Commerce%20Plan%20for%20Retrospective%20Analysis%20of%20Existing%20Rules%20-%202011-08-22%20Final.pdf\nhttp://open.commerce.gov/sites/default/files/Commerce%20Plan%20for%20Retrospective%20Analysis%20of%20Existing%20Rules%20-%202011-08-22%20Final.pdf\n\n\nrulemaking include: an incentive for exporting nations to adopt and \n\nimplement marine mammal conservation standards comparable to the U.S. \n\nas a condition for access to the U.S. seafood market, establishing a \n\nreview process for determining the effectiveness of mitigation measures \n\nadopted by foreign nations; decreasing the likelihood that marine \n\nmammal stocks will be further depleted; and increasing the availability \n\nof information on marine mammal distribution and abundance and the \n\nthreats posed by fisheries interactions. Anticipated costs include: \n\nincreased administrative costs of monitoring trade and making \n\ndeterminations about foreign fisheries bycatch of marine mammals; \n\nincreased costs on seafood importers related to certifying import \n\neligibility, and increased requests for international cooperation and \n\nassistance and attendant costs to implement mitigation measures.\n\n Risks: Prohibiting imports from seafood exporting nations that \n\ncause bycatch of marine mammals in excess of U.S. standards will \n\ndiminish the risk of further declines in marine mammal stocks that are \n\naffected by foreign fisheries.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nANPRM............................... 04/30/10 75 FR 22731\n\nReopening ANPR comment period....... 07/01/10 75 FR 38070\n\nNPRM................................ 02/00/15 .......................\n\nFinal Action........................ 08/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n International Impacts: This regulatory action will be likely to \n\nhave international trade and investment effects, or otherwise be of \n\ninternational interest.\n\n Agency Contact: Rodney Mcinnis, Director, Office of International \n\nAffairs, Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric\n\n[[Page 76499]]\n\nAdministration, 1315 East-West Hwy, Silver Spring, MD 20910, Phone: 562 \n\n980-4005, Email: rod.mcinnis@noaa.gov\n\n Related RIN: Related to 0648-AX36\n\n RIN: 0648-AY15\n\nDOC--NOAA\n\nmailto:rod.mcinnis@noaa.gov\n\n\n34.

This proposal \n\nwould result in modifying the critical habitat that was designated in \n\n1994.\n\n Statement of Need: Under section 4 of the Endangered Species Act, \n\nNOAA Fisheries is required to designate critical habitat for newly \n\nlisted species and revise as new information becomes available.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Endangered Species Act\n\n Alternatives: Critical habitat is defined as (i) the specific areas \n\nwithin the geographical area occupied by the species, at the time it is \n\nlisted, on which are found those physical or biological features (I) \n\nessential to the conservation of the species and (II) which may require \n\nspecial management considerations or protection; and (ii) specific \n\nareas outside the geographical area occupied by the species at the time \n\nit is listed, upon a determination by the Secretary that such areas are \n\nessential for the conservation of the species. In developing this rule, \n\nNOAA Fisheries is analyzing best available information regarding where \n\nthese areas occur and performing economic impact analysis to inform \n\ndesignation.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Because this rule is presently in \n\nthe beginning stages of development, no analysis has been completed at \n\nthis time to assess costs and benefits.\n\n Risks: Loss of critical habitat for a species listed as protected \n\nunder the ESA and Marine Mammals Protection Act, as well as potential \n\nloss of right whales due to habitat loss.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 01/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 2Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Agency Contact: Donna Wieting, Fishery Biologist, Office of \n\nProtected Resources, Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and \n\n\n\nAtmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1315 \n\nEast-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910, Phone: 301 713-2322.\n\n RIN: 0648-AY54\n\nDOC--NOAA\n\n35. Revision of Hawaiian Monk Seal Critical Habitat\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1533\n\n CFR Citation: 50 CFR 226.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) \n\nFisheries is developing a revised proposed rule to designate critical \n\nhabitat for the Hawaiian monk seal in the main and Northwestern \n\nHawaiian Islands. In response to a 2008 petition from the Center for \n\nBiological Diversity, Kahea, and the Ocean Conservancy to revise \n\nHawaiian monk seal critical habitat, NOAA Fisheries published a \n\nproposed rule in June 2011 to revise Hawaiian monk seal critical \n\nhabitat by adding critical habitat in the main Hawaiian Islands and \n\nextending critical habitat in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. \n\nProposed critical habitat includes both marine and terrestrial habitats \n\n(e.g., foraging areas to 500 meter depth, pupping beaches, etc.). To \n\naddress public comments on the proposed rule, NOAA Fisheries is \n\naugmenting its prior economic analysis to better describe the \n\nanticipated costs of the designation. NOAA Fisheries is analyzing new \n\ntracking data to assess monk seal habitat use in the main Hawaiian \n\nIslands.\n\n Statement of Need: Hawaiian monk seal critical habitat was last \n\ndesignated in 1988. Since the 1988 designation, new information \n\nregarding Hawaiian monk seal habitat use has become available. A \n\nrevision to this designation would allow NMFS to more accurately define \n\nthose features and areas that are important to support Hawaiian monk \n\nseal conservation by modifying existing critical habitat in the \n\nNorthwestern Hawaiian Islands and proposing critical habitat in the \n\nmain Hawaiian Islands. NMFS published a proposed rule to designate \n\ncritical habitat in 2011. The agency has made changes to the 2011 \n\nproposed rule in response to public comment, and now plans to release a \n\nsecond, revised proposed rule to provide an opportunity for the public \n\nto comment on these changes.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Endangered Species Act.\n\n Alternatives: In the 2011 proposed rule, NMFS considered the \n\n\n\nalternative of not revising critical habitat for the Hawaiian monk \n\nseal, the alternative of designating all potential critical habitat \n\nareas, and the alternative of designating a subset of all potential \n\ncritical habitat areas, excluding those areas where the benefits of \n\nexclusion outweigh the benefits of designation in accordance with \n\n4(b)(2) of the Endangered Species Act. Under the preferred alternative \n\nNMFS proposed for designation 10 specific areas in the Northwestern \n\nHawaiian Islands and 6 specific areas in the main Hawaiian Islands \n\nwhich support terrestrial pupping and haul-out areas as well as marine \n\nforaging areas. Within four of the main Hawaiian Islands specific \n\nareas, NMFS proposed exclusions to reduce the impacts to national \n\nsecurity.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The economic analysis is currently \n\nbeing revised to reflect changes in response to public comments \n\nreceived. The primary benefit of designation is the protection afforded \n\nunder section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, requiring all Federal \n\nagencies to insure their actions are not likely to destroy or adversely \n\nmodify designated critical habitat. In addition to these protections, \n\nthe designation may also result in other forms of benefits including, \n\nbut not limited to: Educational awareness and outreach benefits, \n\nbenefits to tourism and recreation, and improved or sustained habitat \n\nquality. The designation of critical habitat typically does not impose \n\nadditional costs in occupied habitat, where Federal agencies are \n\nalready required to consult with NMFS as a consequence of the listed \n\nspecies being present. However, in unoccupied habitat the rule may \n\nimpose administrative costs on Federal agencies as well as costs on \n\nFederal agencies and third parties stemming from project modifications \n\nto mitigate impacts to critical habitat.\n\n Risks: The Endangered Species Act requires designation of critical \n\nhabitat following the listing of a species. If critical habitat is not \n\ndesignated, the species will not be protected to the extent provided \n\nfor in the Endangered Species Act, posing a risk to the species \n\ncontinued existence and recovery.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 06/02/11 76 FR 32026\n\n[[Page 76500]]\n\nNotice of Public Meetings........... 07/14/11 76 FR 41446\nOther............................... 06/25/12 77 FR 37867\n\n\n\nSecond NPRM......................... 02/00/15 .......................\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Governmental Jurisdictions, \n\nOrganizations.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, Local, State.\n\n Agency Contact: Donna Wieting, Fishery Biologist, Office of \n\nProtected Resources, Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and \n\nAtmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1315 \n\nEast-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910, Phone: 301 713-2322.\n\n Related RIN: Related to 0648-AX23\n\n RIN: 0648-BA81\n\nDOC--NOAA\n\n36. Revision of the National Standard 1 Guidelines\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.; Pub. L. 94-265.\n\n CFR Citation: 50 CFR 600.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: This action would propose revisions to the National \n\nStandard 1 (NS1) guidelines. National Standard 1 of the Magnuson-\n\nStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act states that \n\nconservation and management measures shall prevent overfishing while \n\nachieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from each fishery \n\nfor the United States fishing industry. National Oceanic and \n\nAtmospheric Administration Fisheries last revised the NS1 Guidelines in \n\n2009 to reflect the requirements enacted by the Magnuson-Stevens \n\nFishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 for \n\nannual catch limits and accountability measures to end and prevent \n\noverfishing. Since 2007, the National Marine Fisheries Service and the \n\nRegional Fishery Management Councils have been implementing the new \n\nannual catch limit and accountability measures requirements. Based on \n\nexperience gained from implementing annual catch limits and \n\naccountability measures, NMFS has developed new perspectives and \n\nidentified issues regarding the application of the NS1 guidelines that \n\nmay warrant them to be revised to more fully meet the intended goal of \n\npreventing overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the \n\noptimum yield from each fishery. The focus of this action is to improve \n\nthe NS1 guidelines.\n\n Statement of Need: Since 2007, fisheries management within the U.S. \n\nhas experienced many changes, in particular the implementation of \n\nannual catch limits and accountability measures under all fishery \n\n\n\nmanagement plans. Based on this experience, the NMFS believes the \n\nNational Standard guidelines can be improved to enhance the utility of \n\nthe guidelines for managers and the public. The objective of the \n\nproposed revisions is to improve and streamline the guidelines, address \n\nconcerns raised during the implementation of annual catch limits and \n\naccountability measures, and provide flexibility within current \n\nstatutory limits to address fishery management issues.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \n\nManagement Act.\n\n Alternatives: The rule attempts to improve fisheries management by \n\nproposing alternatives that clarify guidance in the following topic \n\nareas: (1) Identifying fishery management objectives; (2) identifying \n\nwhether stocks require conservation and management; (3) managing data \n\nlimited stocks; (4) stock complexes; (5) aggregate maximum sustainable \n\nyield estimates; (6) depleted stocks; (7) multi-year overfishing \n\ndeterminations; (8) optimum yield; (9) acceptable biological catch \n\ncontrol rules; (10) accountability measures; (11) establishing annual \n\ncatch limits and accountability measures mechanisms in Fishery \n\nManagement Plans; and (12) flexibility in rebuilding stocks.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The changes to the guidelines would \n\nnot establish any new requirements and thus are technical in nature. As \n\nsuch, the changes would allow, but do not require the Fishery \n\nManagement Councils or the Secretary of Commerce, to make changes to \n\ntheir Fishery Management Plans. Because changes to the guidelines would \n\nnot directly alter the behavior of any entities that operate in \n\nfederally managed fisheries, no direct economic effects are expected to \n\nresult from this action. The potential benefits of revising the \n\nNational Standard guidelines include: improving and streamlining the \n\nguidance, providing additional clarity, and providing flexibility to \n\naddress fishery management issues.\n\n Risks: NMFS anticipates that a revision to the National Standard \n\nguidelines would enhance the utility of the guidelines. NMFS does not \n\nforesee any risks associated with revising the National Standard \n\nguidelines.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nANPRM............................... 05/03/12 77 FR 26238\n\nANPRM Comment Period Extended....... 07/03/12 77 FR 39459\n\nNPRM................................ 12/00/14 .......................\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal.\n\n Agency Contact: Alan Risenhoover, Director, Office of Sustainable \n\nFisheries, Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n\nAdministration, Room 13362, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD \n\n20910, Phone: 301 713-2334, Fax: 301 713-0596, Email: \n\nalan.risenhoover@noaa.gov\n\n Related RIN: Related to 0648-AV60\n\n RIN: 0648-BB92\n\nDOC--NOAA\n\nFinal Rule Stage\n\n37. Fishery Management Plan for Regulating Offshore Marine Aquaculture \n\nin the Gulf of Mexico\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.\n\n CFR Citation: 50 CFR 622.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: The purpose of this fishery management plan is to develop \n\na regional permitting process for regulating and promoting \n\nenvironmentally sound and economically sustainable aquaculture in the \n\nGulf of Mexico exclusive economic zone. This fishery management plan \n\nconsists of ten actions, each with an associated range of management \n\nalternatives, which would facilitate the permitting of an estimated 5 \n\nto 20 offshore aquaculture operations in the Gulf of Mexico over the \n\nnext 10 years, with an estimated annual production of up to 64 million \n\npounds. By establishing a regional permitting process for aquaculture, \n\nthe Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council will be positioned to \n\nachieve their primary goal of increasing maximum sustainable yield and \n\noptimum yield of federal fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico by \n\nsupplementing harvest of wild caught species with cultured product. \n\nThis rulemaking would outline a regulatory permitting process for \n\naquaculture in the Gulf of Mexico, including: (1) Required permits; (2) \n\nduration of permits; (3) species allowed;\n\n[[Page 76501]]\n\n(4) designation of sites for aquaculture; (5) reporting requirements; \n\nand (6) regulations to aid in enforcement.\n\n Statement of Need: Demand for protein is increasing in the United \n\nmailto:alan.risenhoover@noaa.gov\n\n\nStates and commercial wild-capture fisheries will not likely be \n\nadequate to meet this growing demand. Aquaculture is one method to meet \n\ncurrent and future demands for seafood. Supplementing the harvest of \n\ndomestic fisheries with cultured product will help the U.S. meet \n\nconsumers' growing demand for seafood and may reduce the Nation's \n\ndependence on seafood imports. Currently, the U.S. imports over 80 \n\npercent of the seafood consumed in the country, and the annual U.S \n\nseafood trade deficit is at an all time high of over $9 billion.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \n\nManagement Act, 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.\n\n Alternatives: The Council's Aquaculture FMP includes 10 actions, \n\neach with an associated range of alternatives. These actions and \n\nalternatives are collectively intended to establish a regional \n\npermitting process for offshore aquaculture. Management actions in the \n\nFMP include: (1) Aquaculture permit requirements, eligibility, and \n\ntransferability; (2) duration aquaculture permits are effective; (3) \n\naquaculture application requirements, operational requirements, and \n\nrestrictions; (4) species allowed for aquaculture; (5) allowable \n\naquaculture systems; (6) marine aquaculture siting requirements and \n\nconditions; (7) restricted access zones for aquaculture facilities; (8) \n\nrecordkeeping and reporting requirements; (9) biological reference \n\npoints and status determination criteria; and (10) framework procedures \n\nfor modifying biological reference points and regulatory measures.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Environmental and social/economic \n\ncosts and benefits are described in detail in the Council's Aquaculture \n\nFMP. Potential benefits include: establishing a rigorous review process \n\nfor reviewing and approving/denying aquaculture permits; increasing \n\noptimum yield by supplementing the harvest of wild domestic fisheries \n\nwith cultured products; and reducing the Nation's dependence on \n\nimported seafood. Anticipated costs include increased administration \n\nand oversight of an aquaculture permitting process, and potential \n\nnegative environmental impacts to wild marine resources.

It has 1,357,218 military personnel and 853,102 civilians \n\nassigned as of June 30, 2014, and over 200 large and medium \n\ninstallations in the continental United States, U. S. territories, and \n\nforeign countries. The overall size, composition, and dispersion of \n\nDoD, coupled with an innovative regulatory program, presents a \n\nchallenge to the management of the Defense regulatory efforts under \n\nExecutive Order 12866 ``Regulatory Planning and Review'' of September \n\n30, 1993.\n\n Because of its diversified nature, DoD is affected by the \n\nregulations issued by regulatory agencies such as the Departments of \n\nCommerce, Energy, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban \n\nDevelopment, Labor, State, Transportation, and the Environmental \n\nProtection Agency. In order to develop the best possible regulations \n\nthat embody the principles and objectives embedded in E.O. 12866, there \n\nmust be coordination of proposed regulations among the regulatory \n\nagencies and the affected DoD components. Coordinating the proposed \n\nregulations in advance throughout an organization as large as DoD is a \n\nstraightforward, yet formidable, undertaking.\n\n DoD issues regulations that have an effect on the public and can be \n\nsignificant as defined in E.O. 12866. In addition, some of DoD's \n\nregulations may affect other agencies. DoD, as an integral part of its \n\nprogram, not only receives coordinating actions from other agencies, \n\nbut coordinates with the agencies that are affected by its regulations \n\nmailto:roy.crabtree@noaa.gov\n\n\nas well.\n\nOverall Priorities\n\n The Department needs to function at a reasonable cost, while \n\nensuring that it does not impose ineffective and unnecessarily \n\nburdensome regulations on the public. The rulemaking process should be \n\nresponsive, efficient, cost-effective, and both fair and perceived as \n\nfair. This is being done in DoD while reacting to the contradictory \n\npressures of providing more services with fewer resources. The \n\nDepartment of Defense, as a matter of overall priority for its \n\nregulatory program, fully incorporates the provisions of the \n\nPresident's priorities and objectives under Executive Order (E.O.) \n\n12866.\n\nInternational Regulatory Cooperation\n\n As the President noted in Executive Order 13609, ``international \n\nregulatory cooperation, consistent with domestic law and prerogatives \n\nand U.S. trade policy, can be an important means of promoting'' public \n\nhealth, welfare, safety, and our environment as well as economic \n\ngrowth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation. Accordingly, in \n\nExecutive Order 13609, the President requires each executive agency to \n\ninclude in its Regulatory Plan a summary of its international \n\nregulatory cooperation activities that are reasonably anticipated to \n\nlead to significant regulations.\n\n The Department of Defense, along with the Department of State and \n\nthe Department of Commerce, engages with other countries in the \n\nWassenaar Arrangement, through which the international community \n\ndevelops a common list of items that should be subject to export \n\ncontrols.\n\nRetrospective Review of Existing Regulations\n\n Pursuant to section 6 of Executive Order 13563 ``Improving \n\nRegulation and Regulatory Review (January 18, 2011), the following \n\nRegulatory Identifier Numbers (RINs) have been identified as associated \n\nwith retrospective review and analysis in the Department's final \n\nretrospective review of regulations plan.\n\n[[Page 76502]]\n\nAll are of particular interest to small businesses.

Rulemakings That Are Expected To Have High Net Benefits Well in \n\nExcess of Costs\n\n The Department plans to--\n\n Finalize the DFARS rule to implement section 806 of the \n\nNational Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2011, as \n\namended by section 806 of the NDAA for FY 2013. Section 806 requires \n\nthe evaluation of offerors' supply chain risks for information \n\ntechnology purchases relating to national security systems. This rule \n\nenables agencies to exclude sources that are identified as having a \n\nsupply chain risk in order to minimize\n\n[[Page 76503]]\n\nthe potential risk for purchased supplies and services to maliciously \n\n\n\nintroduce unwanted functions and degrade the integrity and operation of \n\nsensitive information technology systems.\n\n Finalize the DFARS rule to provide guidance to contractors \n\nfor the submittal of forward pricing rate proposals to ensure the \n\nadequacy of forward pricing rate proposals submitted to the Government. \n\nThe rule provides guidance to contractors to ensure that forward \n\npricing rate proposals are thorough, accurate, and complete.\n\n Finalize the DFARS rule to implement section 1602 of the \n\nNDAA for FY 2014. Section 1602 prohibits award of a contract for \n\ncommercial satellite services from certain foreign entities if the \n\nSecretary of Defense reasonably believes that the foreign entity is one \n\nin which the government of a foreign country has an ownership interest \n\nthat enables the government to affect satellite operations. There is a \n\npotential risk to national security if DoD uses commercial satellite \n\nservices for DoD communications and the government of a covered foreign \n\ncountry has an ownership interest that enables the government to affect \n\nsatellite operations. Likewise, if launch or other satellite services \n\nunder the contract are occurring in a covered country, the government \n\nof that country could impact the ability of the foreign entity to \n\nadequately provide those services.\n\n2. Rulemakings of Particular Interest to Small Businesses\n\n The Department plans to--\n\n Finalize the DFARS rule to delete text in DFARS part 219 \n\nthat implemented 10 U.S.C. 2323 because 10 U.S.C. 2323 has expired. \n\nRemoval of the obsolete implementing coverage for 10 U.S.C. 2323 will \n\nbring DFARS up to date and provide accurate and indisputable \n\nregulations affecting the small business and vendor communities. 10 \n\nU.S.C. 2323 had provided the underlying statutory authority for DoD's \n\nSmall Disadvantaged Business (SDB) Program and served as the basis for \n\nDoD's use of certain solicitation techniques to further its SDB \n\nparticipation rate. Notwithstanding removal of this statutory authority \n\nfrom the DFARS, DoD's fundamental procurement policies continue to \n\nprovide strong support for SDB participation as evidenced by DoD \n\nmeeting or exceeding the annual Governmentwide statutory SDB prime \n\ncontracting goals since 2001.\n\n Through ``Policy for Domestic, Municipal, and Industrial \n\nWater Supply Uses of Reservoir Projects Operated by the Department of \n\nthe Army, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,'' (RIN 0710-AA72), update and \n\nclarify the policies governing the use of storage in U.S. Army Corps of \n\n\n\nEngineers reservoir projects for domestic, municipal, and industrial \n\nwater supply.\n\n 3. Rulemakings That Streamline Regulations, Reduce Unjustified \n\nBurdens, and Minimize Burdens on Small Businesses\n\n The Department plans to--\n\n Finalize the DFARS rule to implement section 802 of the \n\nNDAA for FY 2012 to allow a covered litigation support contractor \n\naccess to technical, proprietary, or confidential data for the sole \n\npurpose of providing litigation support. DFARS Case 2012-D029, \n\nDisclosure to Litigation Support to Contractors, pertains.\n\n Finalize the DFARS rule to require scientific and \n\ntechnical reports be submitted in electronic format. This rule, DFARS \n\nCase 2014-D0001, will streamline the submission process by no longer \n\nrequiring the electronically initiated report to be printed for \n\nsubmission.\n\n4. Rules To Be Modified, Streamlined, Expanded, or Repealed To Make the \n\nAgency's Regulatory Program More Effective or Less Burdensome in \n\nAchieving the Regulatory Objectives\n\n DFARS Cases 2013-D005, Clauses with Alternates--Foreign \n\nAcquisition, 2013-D025, Clauses with Alternates--Taxes, and 2014-D004, \n\nClauses with Alternates--Special Contracting Methods, Major System \n\nAcquisition, and Service Contract--Propose a new convention for \n\nprescribing clauses with alternates to provide alternate clauses in \n\nfull text. This will facilitate selection of alternate clauses using \n\nautomated contract writing systems. The inclusion of the full text of \n\nthe alternate clauses in the regulation for use in solicitations and \n\ncontracts should make the terms of the alternate clauses clearer to \n\nofferors and contractors by clarifying paragraph substitutions. As a \n\nresult, inapplicable paragraphs from the basic clause that are \n\nsuperseded by the alternate will not be included in solicitations or \n\ncontracts, reducing the potential for confusion.\n\n Finalize the rule for DFARS, DFARS Case 2014-D014, State \n\nSponsors of Terrorism, to clarify and relocate coverage relating to \n\nstate sponsors of terrorism, add an explicit representation, and \n\nconform the terminology to replace the term ``terrorist country'' with \n\nthe more accurate term ``country that is a state sponsor of \n\nterrorism.'' DFARS subpart 209.1 text is being relocated to subpart \n\n225.7. Subpart 225.7 is a better location because the prohibition is \n\nbased on ownership or control of an offeror by the government of \n\nspecified countries, rather than the responsibility of the individual \n\n\n\nofferor. Correspondingly, the provision at 252.209-7001 is being \n\nremoved and replaced by a newly proposed provision 252.225-70XX.\n\n5. Rulemakings That Have a Significant International Impact\n\n Finalize the rule to revise the DFARS to improve \n\nawareness, compliance, and enforcement of DoD policies on combating \n\ntrafficking in persons. The rule will further improve stability, \n\nproductivity, and certainty in the contingency operations that DoD \n\nsupports and ensure that DoD contractors do not benefit from the use of \n\ncoerced labor.\n\nSpecific DoD Priorities\n\n For this regulatory plan, there are six specific DoD priorities, \n\nall of which reflect the established regulatory principles. DoD has \n\nfocused its regulatory resources on the most serious environmental, \n\nhealth, and safety risks. Perhaps most significant is that each of the \n\npriorities described below promulgates regulations to offset the \n\nresource impacts of Federal decisions on the public or to improve the \n\nquality of public life, such as those regulations concerning \n\nacquisition, health affairs, education, and cyber security.\n\n1. Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy\n\n The Department of Defense continuously reviews the DFARS and \n\ncontinues to lead Government efforts to--\n\n Revise the DFARS to improve presentation and clarity of \n\nthe regulations by (1) initiating a new convention to construct clauses \n\nwith alternates in a manner whereby the alternate clauses are included \n\nin full text making the terms of the alternates clearer by clarifying \n\nparagraph substitutions and (2) streamline the DFARS by screening the \n\ntext to identify any DoD procedural guidance that does not have a \n\nsignificant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of DoD or \n\nhave a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or \n\nofferors, which should be more correctly relocated from the DFARS to \n\nthe DFARS Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI).\n\n Employ methods to facilitate and improve efficiency of the \n\ncontracting process such as (1) employing a checklist to assist \n\ncontractors in providing initial submission of FPRA proposals that are \n\nthorough, accurate, and complete and (2) requiring\n\n[[Page 76504]]\n\nscientific and technical reports to be submitted electronically.\n\n2. Health Affairs, Department of Defense\n\n The Department of Defense is able to meet its dual mission of \n\nwartime readiness and peacetime health care by operating an extensive \n\n\n\nnetwork of medical treatment facilities. This network includes DoD's \n\nown military treatment facilities supplemented by civilian health care \n\nproviders, facilities, and services under contract to DoD through the \n\nTRICARE program. TRICARE is a major health care program designed to \n\nimprove the management and integration of DoD's health care delivery \n\nsystem. The program's goal is to increase access to health care \n\nservices, improve health care quality, and control health care costs.\n\n The Defense Health Agency plans to publish the following rule:\n\n Final Rule: CHAMPUS/TRICARE: Pilot Program for Refills of \n\nMaintenance Medications for TRICARE Life Beneficiaries through the \n\nTRICARE Mail Order Program. This final rule implements section 716 of \n\nthe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Pub. L. \n\n112-239), which establishes a 5-year pilot program that would generally \n\nrequire TRICARE for Life beneficiaries to obtain all refill \n\nprescriptions for covered maintenance medications from the TRICARE mail \n\norder program or military treatment facility pharmacies. Covered \n\nmaintenance medications are those that involve recurring prescriptions \n\nfor chronic conditions, but do not include medications to treat acute \n\nconditions. Beneficiaries may opt out of the pilot program after one \n\nyear of participation. This rule includes procedures to assist \n\nbeneficiaries in transferring covered prescriptions to the mail order \n\npharmacy program. The interim final rule was published December 11, \n\n2013 (78 FR 75245) with an effective date of February 14, 2014. DoD \n\nanticipates publishing a final rule in the first quarter of FY 2015.\n\n3. Personnel and Readiness, Department of Defense\n\n The Department of Defense plans to publish a rule regarding Service \n\nAcademies:\n\n Final Rule: Service Academies. This rule establishes \n\npolicy, assigns responsibilities, and prescribes procedures for \n\nDepartment of Defense oversight of the Service Academies. \n\nAdministrative costs are negligible, and benefits are clear, concise \n\nrules that enable the Secretary of Defense to ensure that the Service \n\nAcademies are efficiently operated and meet the needs of the armed \n\nforces. The proposed rule was published October 18, 2007 (72 FR 59053), \n\nand included policy that has since changed. The final rule, \n\nparticularly the explanation of separation policy, will reflect recent \n\nchanges in the ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy. It will also \n\nincorporate changes resulting from interagency coordination. DoD \n\n\n\nanticipates publishing the final rule in the first or second quarter of \n\nFY 2015.\n\n4. Military Community and Family Policy, Department of Defense\n\n The Department of Defense has proposed a revision to the regulation \n\nimplementing the Military Lending Act, which prescribes limitations on \n\nthe terms of consumer credit extended to Service members and \n\ndependents:\n\n Proposed Rule: Limitations on Terms of Consumer Credit \n\nExtended to Service Members and Dependents. In this proposed rule, the \n\nDepartment of Defense (Department) proposes to amend its regulation \n\nthat implements the Military Lending Act, herein referred to as the \n\n``MLA''. Among other protections for Service members, the MLA limits \n\nthe amount of interest that a creditor may charge on ``consumer \n\ncredit'' to a maximum annual percentage rate of 36 percent. The \n\nDepartment proposed to amend its existing regulation primarily for the \n\npurpose of extending the protections of the MLA to a broader range of \n\nclosed-end and open-end credit products, rather than the limited credit \n\nproducts currently defined as consumer credit. In addition, the \n\nDepartment proposed to amend its existing regulation to amend the \n\nprovisions governing a tool a creditor may use in assessing whether a \n\nconsumer is a ``covered borrower,'' modify the disclosures that a \n\ncreditor must provide to a covered borrower implement the enforcement \n\nprovisions of the MLA, as amended, among other purposes. The revisions \n\nto this rule are part of DoD's retrospective plan under Executive Order \n\n13563 completed in August 2011.\n\n5. Chief Information Officer, Department of Defense\n\n The Department of Defense plans to amend the voluntary cyber \n\nsecurity information sharing program between DoD and eligible cleared \n\ndefense contractors:\n\n Proposed Rule: Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Voluntary \n\nCyber Security/Information Assurance (CS/IA) Activities. The Department \n\nproposes to amend the DoD-DIB CS/IA Voluntary Activities regulation (32 \n\nCFR part 236) in response to section 941 National Defense Authorization \n\nAct (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2013, which requires the Secretary of \n\nDefense to establish procedures that require each cleared defense \n\ncontractor (CDC) to report to DoD when a network or information system \n\nhas a cyber-intrusion. The revised rule also expands eligibility to \n\nparticipate in the DIB CS/IA voluntary cyber threat information sharing \n\nprogram to all CDCs. DoD anticipates publishing a proposed rule in the \n\n\n\nfirst or second quarter of FY 2015.\n\nDOD--OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY (OS)\n\nProposed Rule Stage\n\n38. Limitations on Terms of Consumer Credit Extended to Service Members \n\nand Dependents\n\n Priority: Economically Significant. Major under 5 U.S.C. 801.\n\n Legal Authority: 10 U.S.C. 987\n\n CFR Citation: 32 CFR 232.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: The Department of Defense (``Department'') proposes to \n\namend its regulation that implements the Military Lending Act, herein \n\nreferred to as the ``MLA.'' Among other protections for servicemembers, \n\nthe MLA limits the amount of interest that a creditor may charge on \n\n``consumer credit'' to a maximum annual percentage rate of 36 percent. \n\nThe Department is proposing to amend its existing regulation primarily \n\nfor the purpose of extending the protections of the MLA to a broader \n\nrange of closed-end and open-end credit products, rather than the \n\nlimited credit products currently defined as consumer credit. In \n\naddition, the Department is proposing to amend its existing regulation \n\nto amend the provisions governing a tool a creditor may use in \n\nassessing whether a consumer is a ``covered borrower,'' modify the \n\ndisclosures that a creditor must provide to a covered borrower, \n\nimplement the enforcement provisions of the MLA, as amended, and for \n\nother purposes. The revisions to this rule are part of DoD's \n\nretrospective plan under Executive Order 13563 completed in August \n\n2011. DoD's full plan can be accessed at: http://exchange.regulations.gov/exchange/topic/eo-13563.\n\n Statement of Need: This regulation identifies the negative impact \n\nof high-cost consumer credit lending on servicemembers and their \n\ndependents quality of life and on general troop readiness. \n\nServicemembers are younger than the population as a whole with 43 \n\npercent 25 years old or less. Thirty-five percent of enlisted \n\nservicemembers in\n\n[[Page 76505]]\n\nthe grades E1-E4 are married and 20 percent of them have children. This \n\nis compared with approximately 12 percent of their contemporaries in \n\nthe U.S. population 18 through 24 who are married (2012 U.S. Census \n\nBureau). The majority of recruits come to the military from high school \n\nwith little financial literacy education.\n\nhttp://exchange.regulations.gov/exchange/topic/eo-13563\n\n\n The initial indoctrination provided to servicemembers is critical \n\nproviding basic requirements for their professional and personal \n\nresponsibilities and their successful adjustment to military life. Part \n\nof this training is in personal finance which is an integral part of \n\ntheir personal and often professional success. The Department of \n\nDefense (the Department) continues to provide them messages to save, \n\ninvest, and manage their money wisely throughout their career.\n\n A major concern of the Department has been the debt accumulation of \n\nsome servicemembers and the continued financial turmoil caused by their \n\nuse of credit particularly high-cost credit. The regulation has \n\nprovided limitation on the use of credit posing the most significant \n\nconcerns (short-term high-cost credit secured by pay, vehicle title, or \n\ntax return). Other forms of high-cost credit outside of the definitions \n\nin the regulation have been developed since the regulation was \n\ninitially released in 2007 and the proposed changes to the regulation \n\nhave been developed in part to extend protections to servicemembers and \n\ntheir families to cover these new developments.\n\n The Department views the support provided to military families as \n\nessential to sustaining force readiness and military capability. From \n\nthis perspective it is not sufficient for the Department to train \n\nservicemembers on how best to use their financial resources. Financial \n\nprotections are an important part of fulfilling the Departments compact \n\nwith servicemembers and their families and most importantly of \n\nsustaining force readiness and military capability.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Public Law 109-364 the John Warner National \n\nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 670 Limitations on Terms \n\nof Consumer Credit Extended to Servicemembers and Dependents (October \n\n17 2006). Section 670 of Public Law 109-364 which was codified as 10 \n\nU.S.C. 987 requires the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations \n\nto carry out the new section.\n\n Alternatives: No other regulatory alternatives are available. \n\nEducation represents a non-regulatory alternative that is an important \n\naspect of the overall protection provided servicemembers and their \n\nfamilies. However education has not been proven to change behavior and \n\nhas not been sufficient to prepare many of servicemembers to avoid \n\nfinancial products and services that can cause them financial harm. \n\nThis regulation works in tandem with on-going efforts to educate \n\nService members and prepare them to manage their finances.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Increased costs to the creditors as \n\na result of the Regulation have been articulated in the Paperwork \n\nReduction Act Submission as part of the EO 12866 review. The Department \n\n\n\nanticipates that its regulation, if adopted as proposed, might impose \n\ncosts of approximately $96 million during the first year, as creditors \n\nadapt their systems to comply with the requirements of the MLA and the \n\nDepartment's regulation. However, after the first year and on an \n\nongoing basis, the annual effect on the economy is expected to be \n\nbetween approximately $7 million net (quantitative) costs and $117 \n\nmillion net (quantitative) benefits. The potentially anticipated net \n\nbenefits of the proposed regulation are attributable to the cost \n\nsavings to the Department that would result from the reduction in \n\ninvoluntary separations of Service members due to financial distress; \n\nat some points in the range of estimates the Department has used to \n\nassess the proposal, these savings are estimated to exceed the \n\ncompliance costs that would be borne by creditors.\n\n Risks: The Regulation currently covers payday loans, vehicle-title \n\nloans, and tax refund anticipation loans (RALs). Some other credit \n\nproducts with favorable terms as well as terms that can increase the \n\ninterest rate well beyond the limits prescribed by 10 U.S.C. 987 were \n\nnot initially covered by the regulation. However access to payday and \n\nvehicle title loans has changed to include variations that are no \n\nlonger covered by the regulation and there are other high-cost credit \n\nproducts that have become more of an issue for servicemembers and their \n\nfamilies who have over extended their credit.\n\n The regulation continues to complement other actions taken by the \n\nDepartment to include initial and follow-on financial education \n\nfinancial awareness campaigns savings campaigns free financial \n\ncounseling at military installations and available 24 hours 7 days per \n\nweek through Military OneSource. To complement these efforts Military \n\nAid Societies provide grants and no-interest loans and a growing number \n\nof financial institutions located on military installations are \n\nproviding low-cost small-dollar loans.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nANPRM............................... 06/17/13 78 FR 36134\n\nANPRM Comment Period End............ 08/01/13 .......................\n\nNPRM................................ 09/29/14 79 FR 58601\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 11/28/14 .......................\n\nFinal Action........................ 05/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Agency Contact: Marcus Beauregard, Department of Defense, Office of \n\nthe Secretary, 4000 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-4000, Phone: \n\n571 372-5357.\n\n RIN: 0790-AJ10\n\nDOD--OS\n\n39. Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Cyber Security/Information Assurance \n\n(CS/IA) Activities: Amendment\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: EO 12829\n\n CFR Citation: 32 CFR 236.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: This rule amends the DoD-DIB CS/IA Voluntary Activities \n\nregulation in response to section 941 National Defense Authorization \n\nAct (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 which requires the Secretary of \n\nDefense to establish procedures that require each cleared defense \n\ncontractor (CDC) to report when a network or information system that \n\nmeets the criteria reports cyber intrusions.\n\n Statement of Need: The Department of Defense (DoD) will amend the \n\nDoD-DIB CS/IA Voluntary Activities (32 CFR part 236) regulation to \n\nincorporate changes as required by section 941 NDAA for FY 2013 to \n\ninclude mandated cyber intrusion incident reporting by all cleared \n\ndefense contractors (CDCs).\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: This regulation is proposed under the \n\nauthorities of section 941 NDAA for FY 2013.\n\n Alternatives: DoD analyzed the requirements in section 941 NDAA for \n\nFY 2013 and determined that implementation must be accomplished through \n\nthe rulemaking process. This will allow the public to comment on the \n\nimplementation strategy.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Implementing the amended rule to \n\nmeet the requirements of section 941 NDAA for FY 2013 affects \n\napproximately 8,700 CDCs. Each company will require DoD approved, \n\nmedium assured certificates\n\n[[Page 76506]]\n\nto submit the mandatory cyber incident reporting to the DoD-access \n\ncontrolled Web site. The cost per certificate is $175. In addition, it \n\nis estimated that the average burden per reported incident is 7 hours, \n\nwhich includes identifying the cyber incident details, gathering and \n\nmaintaining the data needed, reviewing the collection of information to \n\n\n\nbe reported, and completing the report. Note, these costs are the same \n\nas those associated with 32 CFR part 236 (DoD-DIB CS/IA Voluntary \n\nActivities), but are now applicable across a larger population of \n\ndefense contractors. The benefit of this amended rule is satisfying the \n\nlegal mandate from section 941 NDAA for FY 2013 as well as informing \n\nthe Department of incidents that impact DoD programs and information. \n\nDoD needs to have the ability to assess the strategic and operational \n\nimpacts of cyber incidents and determine appropriate mitigation \n\nactivities.\n\n Risks: There will likely be significant public interest in DoD's \n\nimplementation of section 941 NDAA for FY 2013. DoD will need to assure \n\nthe public that DoD will provide for the reasonable protection of trade \n\nsecrets, commercial or financial information, and information that can \n\nbe used to identify a specific person that may be evident through the \n\ncyber incident reporting and media analysis.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 03/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Agency Contact: Vicki Michetti, Department of Defense, Office of \n\nthe Secretary, 6000 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-6000, Phone: \n\n703 604-3177, Email: vicki.d.michetti.civ@mail.mil\n\n RIN: 0790-AJ14\n\nDOD--OS\n\nFinal Rule Stage\n\n40.

Foreign Commercial Satellite Services (DFARS Case 2014-D010)\n\n\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 41 U.S.C. 1303; Pub. L. 113-66, sec 1602\n\n CFR Citation: 48 CFR 204; 48 CFR 212; 48 CFR 225; 48 CFR 252.\n\n Legal Deadline: Other, Statutory, December 26, 2013, 10 U.S.C. \n\n2279, as added by sec 1602 of the NDAA for FY 2014 (Pub. L. 113-66), \n\nwhich was effective on enactment 12/26/13.\n\n Abstract: DoD issued an interim rule amending the Defense Federal \n\nAcquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to implement section 1602 of \n\nthe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, which \n\nprohibits award of a contract for commercial satellite services to a \n\nforeign entity if the Secretary of Defense believes that the foreign \n\nentity (1) is an entity in which the government of a covered foreign \n\ncountry has an ownership interest that enables the government to affect \n\nsatellite operations; or (2) plans to, or is expected to, provide or \n\nuse launch or other satellite services under the contract from a \n\ncovered foreign country. This rule is not expected to have a \n\nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\n\n Statement of Need: This action is necessary because 10 U.S.C. 2279 \n\nas added by section 1602 of the National Defense Authorization Act for \n\nFY 2014 (Pub. L. 113-66) became effective upon enactment on December 26 \n\n2013. 10 U.S.C. 2279 restricts the acquisition of commercial satellite \n\nservices from certain foreign entities. The statute prohibits the award \n\nof contracts for commercial satellite services to a foreign entity that \n\n(1) is an entity in which the government of a covered foreign country \n\n(i.e., the Peoples Republic of China, North Korea, Cuba, Iran, Sudan, \n\nor Syria) has an ownership interest that enables the government to \n\naffect satellite operations; or (2) plans to or is expected to provide \n\nor use launch or other satellite services under the contract from a \n\ncovered foreign country.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: This rule is proposed under the authority \n\nof title 10 U.S.C. 2279 as added by section 1602 of the National \n\nDefense Authorization Act for FY 2014 (Pub. L. 113-66).\n\n Alternatives: DoD was not able to identify any alternatives that \n\nmeet the statutory requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2279 and the objectives of \n\nthis rule.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Benefits associated with this rule \n\noutweigh the cost of compliance. The rule reduces the potential risk to \n\nnational security by prohibiting the acquisition of commercial \n\nsatellite services from certain foreign entities as in those case where \n\n\n\nthe foreign entity is either (1) an entity in which the government of a \n\ncovered foreign country has an ownership interest that enables the \n\ngovernment to affect satellite\n\n[[Page 76507]]\n\noperations; or (2) plans to or is expected to provide or use launch or \n\nother satellite services under the contract from a covered foreign \n\ncountry. The rule requires an annual representation as to whether the \n\nofferor is or is not a foreign entity subject to the prohibitions of \n\nthe statute or is or is not offering commercial satellite services \n\nprovided by such a foreign entity. DoD estimates that the total \n\nestimated annual public burden for the collection of this information \n\nis negligible (approximately $4275.00) based on Federal Procurement \n\nData System data for FY 2013. There were 380 unique contractors that \n\nreceived contract or orders for PSC D304 (ADP Telecommunications and \n\nTransmission Services) of which commercial satellite services are a \n\nsubset so 380 is an estimate at the highest end of the possible range \n\nof respondents. We estimate that these respondent will spend an average \n\nof 0.25 hours to complete and submit one response per year. \n\nAdditionally DoD estimates that the rule will not have a significant \n\nimpact on small entities unless they are offering commercial satellite \n\nservices provided by a foreign entity that is subject to the \n\nrestrictions of this rule. According to the FPDS data for fiscal year \n\n2013, 111 small entities were awarded contracts or orders for services \n\nin PSC D304 (ADP Telecommunications and Transmission Services) of which \n\ncommercial satellite services are a subset.\n\n Risks: Until this statute is implemented in the DFARS there is risk \n\nthat contracting officers may acquire commercial satellite services in \n\nviolation of the law increasing the risk to the U.S. military \n\noperations and lost opportunities for the U.S. industrial base.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInterim Final Rule.................. 08/05/14 79 FR 45662\n\nInterim Final Rule Effective........ 08/05/14 .......................\n\nInterim Final Rule Comment Period 10/06/14 .......................\n\n End.\n\nFinal Action........................ 03/00/15 .......................\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal.\n\n International Impacts: This regulatory action will be likely to \n\nhave international trade and investment effects, or otherwise be of \n\ninternational interest.\n\n Agency Contact: Manuel Quinones, Department of Defense, Defense \n\nAcquisition Regulations Council, 4800 Mark Center Drive, Suite 15D07-2, \n\nAlexandria, VA 22350, Phone: 571 372-6088, Email: \n\nmanuel.quinones.civ@mail.mil\n\n RIN: 0750-AI32\n\nDOD--Office of Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs (DODOASHA)\n\nFinal Rule Stage\n\n42.

Covered \n\nmaintenance medications are those that involve recurring prescriptions \n\nfor chronic conditions, but do not include medications to treat acute \n\nconditions. Beneficiaries may opt out of the pilot program after 1 year \n\nof participation. This rule includes procedures to assist beneficiaries \n\nin transferring covered prescriptions to the mail-order pharmacy \n\nprogram. This regulation is being issued as an interim final rule in \n\norder to comply with the express statutory intent that the program \n\nbegin in calendar year 2013.\n\n Statement of Need: The Department of Defense (DoD) proposed rule \n\nestablishes processes for the new program of refills of maintenance \n\nmedications for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries through military \n\nmailto:manuel.quinones.civ@mail.mil\n\n\ntreatment facility pharmacies and the mail order pharmacy program.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: This regulation is proposed under 5 U.S.C. \n\n301; 10 U.S.C. chapter 55; 32 CFR 199.21.\n\n Alternatives: The rule fulfills a statutory requirement, therefore \n\nthere are no alternatives.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The effect of the statutory \n\nrequirement, implemented by this rule, is to shift a volume of \n\nprescriptions from retail pharmacies to the most cost-effective point-\n\nof-service venues of military treatment facility pharmacies and the \n\nmail order pharmacy program. This will produce savings to the \n\nDepartment of approximately $104 million per year, and savings to \n\nbeneficiaries of approximately $34 million per year in reduced \n\ncopayments.\n\n Risks: Loss of savings to both the Department and beneficiaries.

Introduction\n\n The U.S. Department of Education (Department) supports States, \n\nlocal communities, institutions of higher education, and others in \n\n\n\nimproving education nationwide and in helping to ensure that all \n\nAmericans receive a high-quality education. We provide leadership and \n\nfinancial assistance pertaining to education at all levels to a wide \n\nrange of stakeholders and individuals, including State educational and \n\nother agencies, local school districts, providers of early learning \n\nprograms, elementary and secondary schools, institutions of higher \n\neducation, career and technical schools, nonprofit organizations, \n\npostsecondary students, members of the public, families, and many \n\nothers. These efforts are helping to ensure that all children and \n\nstudents from pre-kindergarten through grade 12 will be ready for, and \n\nsucceed in, postsecondary education and that students attending \n\npostsecondary institutions are prepared for a profession or career.\n\n We also vigorously monitor and enforce the implementation of \n\nFederal civil rights laws in educational\n\n[[Page 76508]]\n\nprograms and activities that receive Federal financial assistance, and \n\nsupport innovative programs, research and evaluation activities, \n\ntechnical assistance, and the dissemination of research and evaluation \n\nfindings to improve the quality of education.\n\n Overall, the laws, regulations, and programs that the Department \n\nadministers will affect nearly every American during his or her life. \n\nIndeed, in the 2014-2015 school year, about 55 million students will \n\nattend an estimated 130,000 elementary and secondary schools in \n\napproximately 13,600 districts, and about 21 million students will \n\nenroll in degree-granting postsecondary schools. All of these students \n\nmay benefit from some degree of financial assistance or support from \n\nthe Department.\n\n In developing and implementing regulations, guidance, technical \n\nassistance, and monitoring related to our programs, we are committed to \n\nworking closely with affected persons and groups. Specifically, we work \n\nwith a broad range of interested parties and the general public, \n\nincluding families, students, and educators; State, local, and tribal \n\ngovernments; and neighborhood groups, community-based early learning \n\nprograms, elementary and secondary schools, colleges, rehabilitation \n\nservice providers, adult education providers, professional \n\nassociations, advocacy organizations, businesses, and labor \n\norganizations.\n\n If we determine that it is necessary to develop regulations, we \n\nseek public participation at the key stages in the rulemaking process. \n\nWe invite the public to submit comments on all proposed regulations \n\nthrough the Internet or by regular mail. We also continue to seek \n\ngreater public participation in our rulemaking activities through the \n\n\n\nuse of transparent and interactive rulemaking procedures and new \n\ntechnologies.\n\n To facilitate the public's involvement, we participate in the \n\nFederal Docketing Management System (FDMS), an electronic single \n\nGovernment-wide access point (www.regulations.gov) that enables the \n\npublic to submit comments on different types of Federal regulatory \n\ndocuments and read and respond to comments submitted by other members \n\nof the public during the public comment period. This system provides \n\nthe public with the opportunity to submit comments electronically on \n\nany notice of proposed rulemaking or interim final regulations open for \n\ncomment, as well as read and print any supporting regulatory documents.\n\n We are continuing to streamline information collections, reduce the \n\nburden on information providers involved in our programs, and make \n\ninformation easily accessible to the public.\n\nII. Regulatory Priorities\n\nA. The Higher Education Act of 1965, as Amended\n\n Gainful Employment. On March 25, 2014, the Secretary issued a \n\nnotice of proposed rulemaking for the Federal Student Aid programs \n\nauthorized under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as \n\namended (HEA). Specifically, the proposed regulations would amend the \n\nregulations on institutional eligibility under the HEA and the Student \n\nAssistance General Provisions to establish measures for determining \n\nwhether certain postsecondary educational programs prepare students for \n\ngainful employment in a recognized occupation, the conditions under \n\nwhich these educational programs remain eligible for the title IV \n\nFederal Student Aid programs, and requirements for reporting and \n\ndisclosure of relevant information. The public comment period for the \n\nproposed regulations closed on May 27, 2014, and the Department \n\npublished final regulations on October 31, 2014.\n\n Pay As You Earn. On June 9, 2014, the President issued a memorandum \n\ndirecting the Secretary to propose regulations by June 9, 2015, that \n\nwill allow additional students who borrowed Federal Direct Loans to cap \n\ntheir Federal student loan payments at 10 percent of their income. The \n\nmemorandum further directed the Secretary to issue final regulations \n\nafter considering all public comments with the goal of making the \n\nrepayment option available to borrowers by December 31, 2015. On \n\nSeptember 3, 2014, we published a notice announcing our intention to \n\nestablish a negotiated rulemaking committee to prepare proposed \n\nregulations governing the Federal William D. Ford Direct Loan Program. \n\nWe also invited public comments regarding additional issues that should \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\n\n\nbe considered for action by the negotiating committee.\n\n Teacher Preparation. On April 25, 2014, the President directed the \n\nDepartment to propose a plan to strengthen America's teacher \n\npreparation programs for public comment and to publish a final rule \n\nwithin the next year. The Administration seeks to encourage and support \n\nStates in developing systems that recognize excellence and provide all \n\nprograms with information to help them improve, while holding them \n\naccountable for how well they prepare teachers to succeed in today's \n\nclassrooms and throughout their careers. Specifically, the Department \n\nis preparing to issue proposed regulations under title II of the HEA \n\nthat require States to provide more meaningful data in their State \n\nreport cards on the performance of each teacher preparation program \n\nlocated in the State and to amend the regulations governing the Teacher \n\nEducation Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant \n\nProgram to update, clarify, and improve the current regulations and \n\nalign them with data reported by States under title II.\n\nB. Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as Amended\n\n In 2010, the Administration released the ``Blueprint for Reform: \n\nThe Reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act'', \n\nthe President's plan for revising the Elementary and Secondary \n\nEducation Act of 1965 (ESEA) and replacing the No Child Left Behind Act \n\nof 2001 (NCLB). The blueprint can be found at the following Web site: \n\nhttp://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/blueprint/index.html.\n\n Additionally, as we continue to work with Congress on reauthorizing \n\nthe ESEA, we continue to provide flexibility on certain provisions of \n\ncurrent law for States that are willing to embrace reform. The \n\nmechanisms we are using will ensure continued accountability and \n\ncommitment to high-quality education for all students while providing \n\nStates with increased flexibility to implement State and local reforms \n\nto improve student achievement.\n\nC. Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006\n\n In 2012, we released ``Investing in America's Future: A Blueprint \n\nfor Transforming Career and Technical Education'', our plan for \n\nreauthorizing the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of \n\n2006 (2006 Perkins Act). The Blueprint can be found at the following \n\nWeb site: http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ovae/pi/cte/transforming-career-technical-education.pdf.\n\n The 2006 Perkins Act made important changes in Federal support for \n\ncareer and technical education (CTE), such as the introduction of a \n\nhttp://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/blueprint/index.html\nhttp://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ovae/pi/cte/transforming-career-technical-education.pdf\n\n\nrequirement that all States offer ``programs of study.'' These changes \n\nhelped to improve the learning experiences of CTE students but did not \n\ngo far enough to systemically create better outcomes for students and \n\nemployers who are competing in a 21st-century global\n\n[[Page 76509]]\n\neconomy. The Administration's Blueprint would usher in a new era of \n\nrigorous, relevant, and results-driven CTE shaped by four core \n\nprinciples: (1) Alignment; (2) Collaboration; (3) Accountability; and \n\n(4) Innovation. The Administration's Blueprint proposal reflects a \n\ncommitment to promoting equity and quality across these alignment, \n\ncollaboration, accountability, and innovation efforts in order to \n\nensure that more students have access to high-quality CTE programs.\n\nD. Individuals With Disabilities Education Act\n\n On September 18, 2013, the Secretary issued a notice of proposed \n\nrulemaking to amend regulations under Part B of the Individuals with \n\nDisabilities Education Act (IDEA) regarding local maintenance of effort \n\n(MOE) to ensure that all parties involved in implementing, monitoring, \n\nand auditing local educational agency (LEA) compliance with MOE \n\nrequirements understand the rules. The Secretary intends to issue final \n\nregulations to amend the existing regulations that will clarify \n\nexisting policy and make other related changes regarding: (1) The \n\ncompliance standard; (2) the eligibility standard; (3) the level of \n\nfiscal effort required of an LEA in the year after it fails to maintain \n\nthat effort; and (4) the consequence for a failure to maintain local \n\neffort.\n\nE. Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act\n\n President Obama signed the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \n\n(WIOA) into law on July 22, 2014. WIOA replaced the Workforce \n\nInvestment Act of 1998 (WIA), including the Adult Education and Family \n\nLiteracy Act (AEFLA), and amended the Wagner-Peyser Act and the \n\nRehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rehabilitation Act). WIOA promotes the \n\nintegration of the workforce development system's four ``core \n\nprograms'', including AEFLA and the vocational rehabilitation program \n\nunder Title I of the Rehabilitation Act), into the revamped workforce \n\ndevelopment system under Title I of WIOA. In collaboration with the \n\nDepartment of Labor (DOL), the Department must issue an NPRM by January \n\n18, 2015, and final regulations by January 22, 2016. The Department is \n\nworking with DOL to meet this statutory deadline.

Principles for Regulating\n\n Over the next year, we may need to issue other regulations because \n\nof new legislation or programmatic changes. In doing so, we will follow \n\nthe Principles for Regulating, which determine when and how we will \n\nregulate. Through consistent application of those principles, we have \n\neliminated unnecessary regulations and identified situations in which \n\nmajor programs could be implemented without regulations or with limited \n\nregulatory action.\n\n In deciding when to regulate, we consider the following:\n\n Whether regulations are essential to promote quality and \n\nequality of opportunity in education.\n\n Whether a demonstrated problem cannot be resolved without \n\nregulation.\n\n Whether regulations are necessary to provide a legally \n\nbinding interpretation to resolve ambiguity.\n\n Whether entities or situations subject to regulation are \n\nsimilar enough that a uniform approach through regulation would be \n\nmeaningful and do more good than harm.\n\n Whether regulations are needed to protect the Federal \n\ninterest, that is, to ensure that Federal funds are used for their \n\nintended purpose and to eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse.\n\n In deciding how to regulate, we are mindful of the following \n\nprinciples:\n\n Regulate no more than necessary.\n\n Minimize burden to the extent possible, and promote \n\nmultiple approaches to meeting statutory requirements if possible.\n\n Encourage coordination of federally funded activities with \n\n\n\nState and local reform activities.\n\n Ensure that the benefits justify the costs of regulating.\n\n To the extent possible, establish performance objectives \n\nrather than specify compliance behavior.\n\n Encourage flexibility, to the extent possible and as \n\nneeded to enable institutional forces to achieve desired results.\n\nED--OFFICE OF POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION (OPE)\n\nProposed Rule Stage\n\n43.

The Department's \n\nmission is to:\n\n Promote dependable, affordable and environmentally sound \n\nproduction and distribution of energy;\n\n Advance energy efficiency and conservation;\n\n Provide responsible stewardship of the Nation's nuclear \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\n\n\nweapons;\n\n Provide a responsible resolution to the environmental \n\nlegacy of nuclear weapons production; and\n\n Strengthen U.S. scientific discovery, economic \n\ncompetitiveness, and improve quality of life through innovations in \n\nscience and technology.\n\n The Department's regulatory activities are essential to achieving \n\nits critical mission and to implementing major initiatives of the \n\nPresident's National Energy Policy. Among other things, the Regulatory \n\nPlan and the Unified Agenda contain the rulemakings the Department will \n\nbe engaged in during the coming year to fulfill the Department's \n\ncommitment to meeting deadlines for issuance of energy conservation \n\nstandards and related test procedures. The Regulatory Plan and Unified \n\nAgenda also reflect the Department's continuing commitment to cut \n\ncosts, reduce regulatory burden, and increase responsiveness to the \n\npublic.\n\n[[Page 76511]]\n\nRetrospective Review of Existing Regulations\n\n Pursuant to section 6 of Executive Order 13563 ``Improving \n\nRegulation and Regulatory Review'' (Jan. 18, 2011), several regulations \n\nhave been identified as associated with retrospective review and \n\nanalysis in the Department's final retrospective review of regulations \n\nplan. Some of these entries on this list may be completed actions, \n\nwhich do not appear in the Regulatory Plan. However, more information \n\ncan be found about these completed rulemakings in past publications of \n\nthe Unified Agenda on Reginfo.gov in the Completed Actions section for \n\nthat agency. These rulemakings can also be found on Regulations.gov. \n\nThe final agency plan can be found at http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/other/2011-regulatory-action-\nplans/departmentofenergyregulatoryreformplanaugust2011.pdf.\n\nEnergy Efficiency Program for Consumer Products and Commercial \n\nEquipment\n\n The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) requires DOE to set \n\nappliance efficiency standards at levels that achieve the maximum \n\nimprovement in energy efficiency that is technologically feasible and \n\neconomically justified. The Department continues to follow its schedule \n\nfor setting new appliance efficiency standards. These rulemakings are \n\nexpected to save American consumers billions of dollars in energy \n\ncosts.\n\n The overall plan for implementing the schedule is contained in the \n\nReport to Congress under section 141 of EPACT 2005, which was released \n\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/other/2011-regulatory-action-plans/departmentofenergyregulatoryreformplanaugust2011.pdf\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/other/2011-regulatory-action-plans/departmentofenergyregulatoryreformplanaugust2011.pdf\n\n\non January 31, 2006. This plan was last updated in the August 2014 \n\nreport to Congress and now includes the requirements of the Energy \n\nIndependence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA 2007) and the American \n\nEnergy Manufacturing Technical Corrections Act (AEMTCA). The reports to \n\nCongress are posted at: http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/schedule_setting.html.\n\nEstimate of Combined Aggregate Costs and Benefits\n\n In FY 2014, the Department published final rules that adopted new \n\nor amended energy conservation standards for seven different products, \n\nincluding metal halide lamp fixtures, external power supplies, \n\ncommercial refrigeration equipment, walk-in coolers and freezers, \n\nthrough the wall air conditioners and heat pumps, electric motors, and \n\nfurnace fans. These standards when combined with the other final rules \n\nadopting standards since January 2009, are expected to save consumers \n\nhundreds of billions of dollars on their utility bills through 2030.\n\n DOE believes that the three rulemakings that make up the Regulatory \n\nPlan will also substantially benefit the Nation. However, because of \n\ntheir current stage in the rulemaking process, DOE has not yet proposed \n\ncandidate standard levels for these products and cannot provide an \n\nestimate of combined aggregate costs and benefits for these actions. \n\nDOE will, however, in compliance with all applicable law, issue \n\nstandards that provide the maximum energy savings that are \n\ntechnologically feasible and economically justified. Estimates of \n\nenergy savings will be provided when DOE issues the notice of proposed \n\nrulemakings for manufactured housing, general service lamps, and non-\n\nweatherized gas furnaces.\n\nDOE--ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY (EE)\n\nPrerule Stage\n\n45.

EISA specifically states that the scope of the \n\nrulemaking is not limited to incandescent lamp technologies. EISA also \n\nstates that DOE must consider in the first rulemaking cycle the minimum \n\nbackstop requirement of 45 lumens per watt for GSLs effective January \n\n1, 2020, established by EISA. This rulemaking constitutes DOE's first \n\nrulemaking cycle.\n\n Statement of Need: EPCA requires minimum energy efficiency \n\nstandards for certain appliances and commercial equipment.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Title III of the Energy Policy and \n\nConservation Act of 1975 (EPCA or the Act) Public Law 94163 (42 U.S.C. \n\n62916309 as codified) established the Energy Conservation Program for \n\nConsumer Products Other Than Automobiles. Pursuant to EPCA any new or \n\namended energy conservation standard that the U.S. Department of Energy \n\n(DOE) prescribes for certain products such as general service lamps \n\nshall be designed to achieve the maximum improvement in energy \n\nefficiency that is technologically feasible and economically justified \n\n(42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(A)) and result in a significant conservation of \n\nenergy (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(3)(B)).\n\n Alternatives: The statute requires DOE to conduct rulemakings to \n\nreview standards and to revise standards to achieve the maximum \n\nimprovement in energy efficiency that the Secretary determines is \n\ntechnologically feasible and economically justified.

The following overview highlights \n\nforthcoming rulemakings exemplifying these priorities.\n\nEncouraging Delivery System Reforms To Ensure Consumer Access to High \n\nQuality, Affordable Care\n\n The Affordable Care Act expands access to health insurance through \n\nimprovements in Medicaid, the establishment of Affordable Insurance \n\nExchanges, and coordination between Medicaid, the Children's Health \n\nInsurance Program, and the Exchanges. A forthcoming final rule will \n\nbring to completion regulatory provisions that support our efforts to \n\nassist States in implementing Medicaid eligibility determinations, \n\nappeals, enrollment changes, and other State health subsidy programs \n\nstemming from the Affordable Care Act. The intent of the rule is to \n\nafford each State substantial discretion in the design and operation of \n\nthat State's exchange, with standardization provided only where \n\ndirected by the Act or where there are compelling practical, efficiency \n\nor consumer-protection reasons.\n\n A forthcoming proposed rule would establish policies related to \n\n``Stage 3'' of the Medicare/Medicaid Electronic Health Record (EHR) \n\nIncentive Programs. The rule is necessary to further implement \n\nprovisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that provide \n\nincentive payments to eligible providers, hospitals, and critical \n\naccess hospitals participating in Medicare and Medicaid programs that \n\nadopt certified EHR technology. The proposal will offer for comment \n\nspecific criteria that these providers and facilities would need to \n\nmeet in order to successfully demonstrate ``meaningful use,'' focusing \n\n\n\non advanced use of EHR technology to promote improved outcomes for \n\npatients.\n\n The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) requires \n\nparity between mental health or substance use disorder benefits and \n\nmedical/surgical benefits, with respect to financial requirements and \n\ntreatment limitations under group health plans. A new proposed rule \n\nwould build on the 2013 final rule implementing MHPAEA by proposing \n\nstandards for Medicaid alternative benefit plans, Medicaid managed care \n\norganizations, and the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n\n Another proposed rule would revise the requirements that long-term \n\ncare facilities must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid \n\nprograms. The proposed changes are necessary to reflect advances in the \n\ntheory and practice of service delivery and safety for patients in \n\nlong-term care settings. The proposals are also an integral part of our \n\nefforts to achieve broad-based improvements both in the quality of \n\nhealth care furnished through Federal programs, and in patient safety, \n\nwhile at the same time reducing procedural burdens on providers.\n\n In addition, nine Medicare payment rules will be updated to better \n\nreflect the current state of medical practice and to respond to \n\nfeedback from providers seeking financial predictability and \n\nflexibility to better serve patients.\n\nStreamlining Regulations Through Retrospective Review\n\n Consistent with the President's Executive Order 13563, ``Improving \n\nRegulation and Regulatory Review,'' the Department remains committed to \n\nreducing regulatory burden on States, health care providers and \n\nsuppliers, and other regulated entities by updating current rules to \n\nalign them with emerging health and safety standards, and by \n\neliminating outdated procedural provisions.\n\n For example, CMS will continue its retrospective review efforts by \n\nfinalizing an April 2014, proposal to amend the fire safety standards \n\nfor hospitals, long-term care facilities, ambulatory surgery centers, \n\nand a variety of other inpatient care settings. Further, this rule will \n\nadopt the most recent edition of the Life Safety Code (LSC) and \n\neliminate references in our regulations to all earlier editions, which \n\nwill give clear guidance to providers and institutions for these \n\nimportant safety standards.\n\n Similarly, a forthcoming final rule from the Administration for \n\nChildren and Families (ACF) will provide the first comprehensive update \n\n\n\nof Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) regulations since 1998. The \n\nCCDF is a Federal program that provides formula grants to States, \n\nterritories, and tribes. The program provides financial assistance to \n\nlow-income families to access child care so that they can work or \n\nattend a job-training or educational program. It also provides funding \n\nto improve the quality of child care and increase the supply and \n\navailability of child care for all families, including those who \n\nreceive no direct assistance through CCDF.\n\n Another ACF effort would modify existing Head Start performance \n\nstandards to take into account increased knowledge in the early \n\nchildhood field since the standards were last updated more than 15 \n\nyears ago. Changes would strengthen requirements on curriculum and \n\nassessment, supervision, health and safety, and governance. The notice \n\nof proposed rulemaking would also streamline existing regulations to\n\n[[Page 76514]]\n\neliminate unnecessary or duplicative requirements.\n\n Additionally, the Department, in collaboration with the President's \n\nOffice of Science and Technology Policy will propose revisions to \n\nexisting rules governing research on human subjects, often referred to \n\nas the Common Rule. This rule would apply to institutions and \n\nresearchers supported by HHS as well as researchers throughout much of \n\nthe Federal Government who are conducting research involving human \n\nsubjects. The proposed revisions will aim to better protect human \n\nsubjects while facilitating research, and also reducing burden, delay, \n\nand ambiguity for investigators.\n\nHelping Consumers Identify Healthy Choices in the Marketplace\n\n Since 1980, the prevalence of obesity among children and \n\nadolescents has almost tripled. Obesity has both immediate and long-\n\nterm effects on the health and quality of life of those affected, \n\nincreasing their risk for chronic diseases, including heart disease, \n\ntype 2 diabetes, certain cancers, stroke, and arthritis--as well as \n\nincreasing medical costs for the individual and the health system. \n\nBuilding on the momentum of the First Lady's ``Let's Move'' initiative, \n\nHHS has mobilized skills and expertise from across the Department to \n\naddress this epidemic with research, public education, and public \n\nhealth strategies.\n\n Adding to this effort, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plans \n\nto issue four final rules designed to provide more useful, easy to \n\nunderstand dietary information tools that will help millions of \n\n\n\nAmerican families identify healthy choices in the marketplace. These \n\nrules, each benefiting from input received in extended public comment \n\nperiods, will:\n\n Require restaurants and similar retail food establishments \n\nwith 20 or more locations to list calorie content information for \n\nstandard menu items on restaurant menus and drive-through menu boards. \n\nOther nutrient information--total calories, fat, saturated fat, \n\ncholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrates, sugars, fiber, and total \n\nprotein--would have to be made available in writing upon request;\n\n Require vending machine operators who own or operate 20 or \n\nmore vending machines to disclose calorie content for some items. The \n\nDepartment anticipates that such information will ensure that patrons \n\nof chain restaurants and vending machines have access to essential \n\nnutrition information;\n\n Revise the nutrition and supplement facts labels on \n\npackaged food, which has not been updated since 1993 when mandatory \n\nnutrition labeling of food was first required. The aim of the proposed \n\nrevision is to provide updated and easier to read nutrition information \n\non the label to help consumers maintain healthy dietary practices; and\n\n Update the serving-size information provided within the \n\nfood label, providing current nutrition information based on the amount \n\nof food that is typically eaten as a serving, to assist consumers in \n\nmaintaining healthy dietary practices.\n\nImplementing the Food Safety Modernization Act\n\n FDA will maintain the agency's ongoing effort to promulgate rules \n\nrequired under the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), working with \n\npublic and private partners to build a new system of food safety \n\noversight. Responding to extensive feedback from stakeholders, the \n\nagency recently issued for further public comment supplemental \n\nproposals structured to:\n\n Establish preventive controls in the manufacture and \n\ndistribution of human foods and of animal feeds. These regulations \n\nconstitute the heart of the FSMA food safety program by instituting \n\nuniform practices for the manufacture and distribution of food \n\nproducts, to ensure that those products are safe for consumption and \n\nwill not cause or spread disease.\n\n Ensure that produce sold in the United States meets \n\nrigorous safety standards. The regulation would set enforceable, \n\nscience-based standards for the safe production and harvesting of fresh \n\nproduce at the farm and the packing house, to minimize the risk of \n\n\n\nadverse health consequences.\n\n Require food importers to establish a verification program \n\nto improve the safety of food imported into the United States. \n\nSpecifically, FDA will outline proposed standards that foreign food \n\nsuppliers must meet to ensure that imported food is produced in a \n\nmanner that is as safe as food produced in the United States.\n\nReducing Tobacco Use\n\n In 2009, Congress enacted the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco \n\nControl Act, authorizing FDA to regulate the manufacture, marketing, \n\nand distribution of tobacco products, to protect the public health and \n\nto reduce tobacco use by minors. In the coming fiscal year, benefiting \n\nfrom public scrutiny of an April 2014, regulatory proposal, FDA plans \n\nto issue a final rule that will clarify which products containing \n\ntobacco, in addition to cigarettes, are subject to the Agency's \n\noversight. This rule would also allow FDA to establish regulatory \n\nstandards on the sale and distribution of tobacco products, such as \n\nage-related access restrictions on advertising and promotion, as \n\nappropriate, to protect public health.\n\nModernizing Medical-Product Safety and Availability\n\n In 2012, Congress provided new authorities under the Food and Drug \n\nAdministration Safety and Innovation Act to support its mission of \n\nsafeguarding the quality of medical products available to the public \n\nwhile ensuring the availability of innovative products. FDA is \n\nimplementing this new authority with a focus on protecting the quality \n\nof medical products in the global drug supply chain; improving the \n\navailability of needed drugs and devices; and promoting better-informed \n\ndecisions by health professionals and patients.\n\n For example, the Agency plans to issue a final rule this year to \n\nrequire manufacturers of certain drugs, such as drugs used for cancer \n\ntreatments, anesthesia drugs, and other drugs that are critical to the \n\ntreatment of serious diseases and life-threatening conditions, to \n\nreport discontinuances or interruptions in the manufacturing of these \n\nproducts. This rule will help FDA address and potentially prevent drug \n\nshortages, and it will help inform providers and public health \n\nofficials earlier about potential drug shortages.\n\n Another forthcoming final rule will update FDA's regulations to \n\nreflect the increased use of generic drugs in the current marketplace, \n\nand will describe approaches for brand name and generic drug \n\n\n\nmanufacturers to update product labeling. This rule will revise and \n\nclarify procedures for updates to product labeling to reflect certain \n\ntypes of newly acquired safety information through submission of a \n\n``changes being effected'' supplement.\n\nReducing Gun Violence\n\n As part of the President's continuing efforts to reduce gun \n\nviolence, HHS will issue a final rule to remove unnecessary legal \n\nbarriers under the HIPAA Privacy Rule that may prevent States from \n\nreporting certain information to the National Instant Criminal \n\nBackground Check System (NICS). The NICS helps to ensure that guns are \n\nnot sold to those prohibited by law from having them, including felons, \n\nthose convicted of domestic violence, and individuals involuntarily \n\ncommitted to a mental institution. However, the background check system \n\nis only as effective as the\n\n[[Page 76515]]\n\ninformation that is available to it. The rule will give States and \n\ncertain covered entities added flexibility to ensure accurate but \n\nlimited information is reported to the NICS, which would not include \n\nclinical, diagnostic, or other mental health information. Instead, \n\ncertain covered entities would be permitted to disclose the minimum \n\nnecessary identifying information about individuals who have been \n\ninvoluntarily committed to a mental institution or otherwise have been \n\ndetermined by a lawful authority to be a danger to themselves or \n\nothers.\n\nHHS--FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA)\n\nProposed Rule Stage\n\n48. Current Good Manufacturing Practice and Hazard Analysis and Risk-\n\nBased Preventive Controls for Food for Animals\n\n Priority: Economically Significant. Major under 5 U.S.C. 801.\n\n Unfunded Mandates: This action may affect the private sector under \n\nPub.

Final, Judicial, \n\nAugust 30, 2015.\n\n The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) mandates that FDA \n\n\n\npromulgate final regulations to establish preventive controls not later \n\nthan 18 months after the date of enactment of FSMA. Certain \n\nrequirements regarding standards for pet food and other animal feeds \n\nmandated by the FDA Amendment Act of 2007 will be subsumed in the FSMA \n\nrulemaking. Per consent decree, FDA will submit the final rule to the \n\nFederal Register for publication by 08/30/2015.\n\n Abstract: This rule establishes requirements for good manufacturing \n\npractice, and requires that certain facilities establish and implement \n\nhazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls for animal food, \n\nincluding ingredients and mixed animal feed. This action is intended to \n\nprovide greater assurance that food for all animals, including pets, is \n\nsafe.\n\n Statement of Need: Regulatory oversight of the animal food industry \n\nhas traditionally been limited and focused on a few known safety issues \n\nso there could be problems that remain unaddressed potentially \n\naffecting animal health. The massive pet food recall due to \n\nadulteration with melamine and cyanuric acid in 2007 is an example. \n\nActions taken by two protein suppliers in China affected a large number \n\nof pet food manufacturers in the United States and created a nationwide \n\nproblem. By the time the cause of the problem was identified melamine- \n\nand cyanuric-acid contaminated ingredients had resulted in the \n\nadulteration of millions of individual servings of pet food sickening \n\nand killing pets. Salmonella contaminated pet food has been the cause \n\nof illness in humans: In 2007 people became ill handling pet food \n\ncontaminated with a rare Salmonella serotype; over 200 people in the \n\nUnited Kingdom and United States became ill from handling Salmonella \n\ncontaminated frozen mice (used for pet food) that came from a U.S. \n\nfacility; and people were infected with Salmonella in 2012 that \n\noriginated from contaminated dog and cat food. Other animal food \n\nrecalls have resulted from contamination with aflatoxins, dioxins \n\nexcessive vitamin D, and insufficient thiamine. Congress passed FSMA \n\nwhich the President signed into law on January 4, 2011 (Pub. L. 111-\n\n353). Section 103 of FSMA amended the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic \n\nAct (FD&C Act) by adding section 418 (21 U.S.C. 350g) Hazard Analysis \n\nand Risk-Based Preventive Controls. In enacting FSMA Congress sought to \n\nimprove the safety of food in the United States by taking a risk-based \n\napproach to food safety emphasizing prevention. Section 418 of the FD&C \n\nAct requires owners, operators, or agents in charge of food facilities \n\nto develop and implement a written hazard analysis and preventive \n\ncontrols to significantly minimize or prevent the occurrence of hazards \n\nand help prevent adulteration of food.\n\n\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: FDA's authority for issuing this rule is \n\nprovided in FSMA (Pub. L. 111-353), which amended the FD&C Act by \n\nestablishing section 418, which directed FDA to publish implementing \n\nregulations. FSMA also amended section 301 of the FD&C Act to add \n\n301(uu) that states the operation of a facility that manufactures, \n\nprocesses, packs, or holds food for sale in the United States, if the \n\nowner, operator, or agent in charge of such facility is not in \n\ncompliance with section 418 of the FD&C Act, is a prohibited act. FDA \n\nis also issuing this rule under the certain provisions of section 402 \n\nof the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 342) regarding adulterated food. In \n\naddition, section 701(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 371(a)) authorizes \n\nthe Agency to issue regulations for the efficient enforcement of the \n\nAct. To the extent the regulations are related to communicable disease, \n\nFDA's legal authority also derives from sections 311, 361, and 368 of \n\nthe Public Health Services Act (42 U.S.C. 243, 264, and 271). Finally, \n\nFDA is acting under the direction of section 1002(a) of title X of \n\nFDAAA of 2007 (21 U.S.C. 2102) which requires the Secretary to \n\nestablish processing standards for pet food.\n\n Alternatives: The Food Safety Modernization Act requires FDA to \n\npromulgate regulations to establish hazard analyses and risk-based \n\npreventive controls.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The benefits of the proposed rule \n\nwould be fewer cases of contaminated animal food. Discovering \n\ncontaminated food ingredients before they are used in a finished \n\nproduct would reduce the number of recalls of contaminated animal food \n\nproducts. Benefits would include reduced medical treatment costs for \n\nanimals, reduced loss of market value of livestock, reduced loss of \n\nanimal companionship, and reduced loss in value of animal food. More \n\nstringent requirements for animal food manufacturing would maintain \n\npublic confidence in the safety of animal food, and protect animal and \n\nhuman health. FDA lacks sufficient data to quantify the benefits of the \n\nproposed rule. The compliance costs of the proposed rule would result \n\nfrom the additional labor and capital required to perform the hazard \n\nanalyses, write and implement the preventive controls, monitor and \n\nverify the preventive controls, take corrective actions if preventive \n\ncontrols fail to prevent food from becoming contaminated, and implement \n\nthe current good manufacturing practice regulations.\n\n Risks: FDA is proposing this rule to provide greater assurance that \n\nfood intended for animals is safe, and will not cause illness or injury \n\nto animals. This rule would implement a risk-based, preventive controls \n\n\n\nfood safety system intended to prevent animal food containing hazards, \n\nwhich may cause illness or injury to animals or humans, from entering \n\nthe food supply. The rule would apply to domestic and imported animal \n\nfood (including raw materials and ingredients). Fewer cases of animal \n\nfood contamination would reduce the risk of serious illness and death \n\nto animals.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 10/29/13 78 FR 64736\n\n[[Page 76516]]\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extension....... 02/03/14 79 FR 6111\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 02/26/14 .......................\nNPRM Comment Period Extension End... 03/31/14 .......................\nSupplemental NPRM................... 09/29/14 79 FR 58475\nSupplemental NPRM Comment Period End 12/15/14 .......................\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 08/00/15 .......................\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: State.\n\n Federalism: This action may have federalism implications as defined \n\nin EO 13132.\n\n Agency Contact: Kim Young, Deputy Director, Division of Compliance, \n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, \n\nCenter for Veterinary Medicine, Room 106 (MPN-4, HFV-230), 7519 \n\nStandish Place, Rockville, MD 20855, Phone: 240 276-9207, Email: \n\nkim.young@fda.hhs.gov\n\n RIN: 0910-AG10\n\nHHS--FDA\n\n49.

The purpose of the rule \n\nis to reduce the risk of illness associated with fresh produce.\n\n Statement of Need: FDA is taking this action to meet the \n\nrequirements of the FSMA and to address the food safety challenges \n\nassociated with fresh produce and, thereby, protect the public health. \n\nData indicate that between 1973 and 1997, outbreaks of foodborne \n\nillness in the U.S. associated with fresh produce increased in absolute \n\nnumbers and as a proportion of all reported foodborne illness \n\noutbreaks. The Agency issued general good agricultural practice \n\nguidelines for fresh fruits and vegetables over a decade ago. \n\nIncorporating prevention-oriented public health principles, and \n\nincorporating what we have learned in the past decade into a regulation \n\nis a critical step in establishing standards for the production and \n\nharvesting of produce, and reducing the foodborne illness attributed to \n\nfresh produce.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: FDA is relying on the amendments to the \n\nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), provided by \n\nsection 105 of the Food Safety Modernization Act (codified primarily in \n\nsection 419 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 350h)). FDA's legal basis also \n\nderives in part from sections 402(a)(3), 402(a)(4), and 701(a) of the \n\nFD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(3), 342(a)(4), and 371(a)). FDA also intends \n\nto rely on section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 \n\nU.S.C. 264), which gives FDA authority to promulgate regulations to \n\ncontrol the spread of communicable disease.\n\n Alternatives: Section 105 of the Food Safety Modernization Act \n\nrequires FDA to conduct this rulemaking.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: FDA estimates that the costs to more \n\nthan 300,000 domestic and foreign producers and packers of fresh \n\nproduce from the proposal would include one-time costs (e.g., new tools \n\nand equipment) and recurring costs (e.g., monitoring, training, \n\nrecordkeeping). FDA anticipates that the benefits would be a reduction \n\nin foodborne illness and deaths associated with fresh produce. The \n\nmonetized annual benefits of this rule are estimated to be $1 billion, \n\nand the monetized annual costs are estimated to be $460 million, \n\ndomestically.\n\n Risks: This regulation would directly and materially advance the \n\n\n\nFederal Government's substantial interest in reducing the risks for \n\nillness and death associated with foodborne infections associated with \n\nthe consumption of fresh produce. Less restrictive and less \n\ncomprehensive approaches have not been sufficiently effective in \n\nreducing the problems addressed by this regulation. FDA anticipates \n\nthat the regulation would lead to a significant decrease in foodborne \n\nillness associated with fresh produce consumed in the United States.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 01/16/13 78 FR 3503\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 05/16/13 .......................\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 04/26/13 78 FR 24692\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended End.... 09/16/13 .......................\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 08/09/13 78 FR 48637\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended End.... 11/15/13 .......................\n\nNotice of Intent To Prepare an 08/19/13 78 FR 50358\n\n Environmental Impact Statement for\n\n the Proposed Rule.\n\nNotice of Intent To Prepare 11/15/13 .......................\n\n Environmental Impact Statement for\n\n the Proposed Rule Comment Period\n\n End.\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 11/20/13 78 FR 69605\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended End.... 11/22/13 .......................\n\nEnvironmental Impact Statement for 03/11/14 79 FR 13593\n\n the Proposed Rule; Comment Period\n\n Extended.\n\nEnvironmental Impact Statement for 04/18/14 .......................\n\n the Proposed Rule; Comment Period\n\n Extended End.\n\nSupplemental NPRM................... 09/29/14 79 FR 58433\n\nSupplemental NPRM Comment Period End 12/15/14 .......................\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 10/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None\n\n Agency Contact: Samir Assar, Supervisory Consumer Safety Officer, \n\n\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, \n\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Office of Food Safety, \n\n5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, MD 20740, Phone: 240 402-1636, \n\nEmail: samir.assar@fda.hhs.gov\n\n RIN: 0910-AG35\n\n[[Page 76517]]\n\nHHS--FDA\n\n50.

This action is intended to prevent or, \n\nat a minimum, quickly identify foodborne pathogens before they get into \n\nthe food supply.\n\n Statement of Need: FDA is taking this action to meet the \n\nrequirements of FSMA and to better address changes that have occurred \n\nin the food industry and thereby protect public health. High-profile \n\noutbreaks of foodborne illness over the last decade and data showing \n\nthat such illnesses strike one in six Americans each year have caused a \n\nwidespread recognition that we need a new modern food safety system \n\nthat prevents food safety problems in the first place not a system that \n\njust reacts once they happen. Section 103 of FSMA amended the Federal \n\nFood Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) by adding section 418 (21 U.S.C. \n\n350g) Hazard Analysis and Risk Based Preventive Controls. In enacting \n\nFSMA Congress sought to improve the safety of food in the United States \n\nby taking a risk-based approach to food safety emphasizing prevention. \n\nSection 418 of the FD&C Act requires owners operators or agents in \n\ncharge of food facilities to develop and implement a written plan that \n\ndescribes and documents how their facility will implement the hazard \n\nanalysis and preventive controls required by this section. In addition \n\nmailto:samir.assar@fda.hhs.gov\n\n\nto containing new provisions requiring hazard analysis and risk-based \n\npreventive controls this rule would also revise the existing Current \n\nGood Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements found in 21 CFR part \n\n110 that were last updated in 1986.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: FDA is relying on section 103 of the FSMA. \n\nFDA is also relying on sections 402(a)(3), (a)(4) and 701(a) of the \n\nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. \n\n342(a)(3), (a)(4), and 371(a)). Under section 402(a)(3) of the FD&C \n\nAct, a food is adulterated if it consists in whole, or in part, of any \n\nfilthy, putrid, or decomposed substance, or if it is otherwise unfit \n\nfor food. Under section 402(a)(4), a food is adulterated if it has been \n\nprepared, packed, or held under unsanitary conditions whereby it may \n\nhave become contaminated with filth, or may have been rendered \n\ninjurious to health. Under section 701(a) of the FD&C Act, FDA is \n\nauthorized to issue regulations for the efficient enforcement of the \n\nFD&C Act. FDA's legal basis also derives from section 361 of the Public \n\nHealth Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 264), which gives FDA authority \n\nto promulgate regulations to control the spread of communicable \n\ndisease.\n\n Alternatives: An alternative to this rulemaking is not to update \n\nthe CGMP regulations, and instead issue separate regulations to \n\nimplement the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: FDA estimates that the costs from \n\nthe proposal to domestic and foreign producers and packers of processed \n\nfoods would include new one-time costs (e.g., adoption of written food \n\nsafety plans, setting up training programs, implementing allergen \n\ncontrols, and purchasing new tools and equipment) and recurring costs \n\n(e.g., auditing and monitoring suppliers of sensitive raw materials and \n\ningredients, training employees, and completing and maintaining records \n\nused throughout the facility). FDA anticipates that the benefits would \n\nbe a reduced risk of foodborne illness and death from processed foods, \n\nand a reduction in the number of safety-related recalls.\n\n Risks: This regulation will directly and materially advance the \n\nFederal Government's substantial interest in reducing the risks for \n\nillness and death associated with foodborne infections. Less \n\nrestrictive and less comprehensive approaches have not been effective \n\nin reducing the problems addressed by this regulation. The regulation \n\nwill lead to a significant decrease in foodborne illness in the U.S.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nNPRM................................ 01/16/13 78 FR 3646\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 05/16/13 .......................\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 04/26/13 78 FR 24691\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended End.... 09/16/13 .......................\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 08/09/13 78 FR 48636\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended End.... 11/15/13 .......................\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 11/20/13 78 FR 69604\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended End.... 11/22/13 .......................\n\nSupplemental NPRM................... 09/29/14 79 FR 58523\n\nSupplemental NPRM Comment Period End 12/15/14 .......................\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 08/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Additional Information: Includes Retrospective Review under E.O. \n\n13563.\n\n Agency Contact: Jenny Scott, Senior Advisor, Department of Health \n\nand Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Office of Food \n\nSafety, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, MD 20740, Phone: 240 \n\n402-1488, Email: jenny.scott@fda.hhs.gov\n\n RIN: 0910-AG36\n\nHHS--FDA\n\n51. Reports of Distribution and Sales Information for Antimicrobial \n\nActive Ingredients Used in Food-Producing Animals\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 21 U.S.C. 360b(l)(3)\n\n CFR Citation: 21 CFR 514.80.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: This proposed rule would require that the sponsor of each \n\napproved or conditionally approved antimicrobial new animal drug \n\nproduct submit an annual report to the Food and Drug Administration \n\n(FDA or Agency) on the amount of each antimicrobial active ingredient \n\nin the drug product that is sold or distributed for use in food-\n\nproducing animals, including any distributor-labeled product. In \n\naddition to codifying these requirements, FDA is exploring other \n\nrequirements for the collection of additional drug distribution data.\n\n Statement of Need: Section 105 of the Animal Drug User Fee \n\nAmendments of 2008 (ADUFA) amended section 512 of the Federal Food, \n\nDrug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to require that the sponsor of each \n\nmailto:jenny.scott@fda.hhs.gov\n\n\napproved or conditionally appoved new animal drug\n\n[[Page 76518]]\n\nproduct that contains an antimicrobial active ingredient submit an \n\nannual report to FDA on the amount of each antimicrobial active \n\ningredient in the drug product that is sold or distributed for use in \n\nfood-producing animals, including information on any distributor-\n\nlabeled product. This legislation was enacted to assist FDA in its \n\ncontinuing analysis of the interactions (including drug resistance), \n\nefficacy, and safety of antibiotics approved for use in both humans and \n\nfood-producing animals (H. Rpt. 110-804). This proposed rulemaking is \n\nto codify these requirements. In addition, FDA is exploring the \n\nestablishment of other reporting requirements to provide for the \n\ncollection of additional drug distribution data, including reporting \n\nsales and distribution data by species.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Section 105 of ADUFA (Pub. L. 110-316; 122 \n\nStat. 3509) amended section 512 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360b) to \n\nrequire that sponsors of approved or conditionally approved \n\napplications for new animal drugs containing an antimicrobial active \n\ningredient submit an annual report to the Food and Drug Administration \n\non the amount of each such ingredient in the drug that is sold or \n\ndistributed for use in food-producing animals, including information on \n\nany distributor-labeled product. FDA is also issuing this rule under \n\nits authority under section 512(l) of the FD&C Act to collect \n\ninformation relating to approved new animal drugs.\n\n Alternatives: This rulemaking codifies the congressional mandate of \n\nADUFA section 105. The annual reporting required under ADUFA section \n\n105 is necessary to address potential problems concerning the safety \n\nand effectiveness of antimicrobial new animal drugs. Less frequent data \n\ncollection would hinder this purpose.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Sponsors of antimicrobial drugs sold \n\nfor use in food-producing animals currently report sales and \n\ndistribution data to the Agency under section 105 of ADUFA; this \n\nrulemaking will codify in FDA's regulations a current statutory \n\nrequirement. There may be a minimal additional labor cost if any other \n\nreporting requirement is proposed. Additional data beyond the reporting \n\nrequirements specified in ADUFA section 105 will help the Agency better \n\nunderstand how the use of medically important antimicrobial drugs in \n\nfood-producing animals may relate to antimicrobial resistance.\n\n Risks: Section 105 of ADUFA was enacted to address the problem of \n\nantimicrobial resistance, and to help ensure that FDA has the necessary \n\ninformation to examine safety concerns related to the use of \n\n\n\nantibiotics in food-producing animals. 154 Congressional Record H7534.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nANPRM............................... 07/27/12 77 FR 44177\n\nANPRM Comment Period End............ 09/25/12 .......................\n\nANPRM Comment Period Extended....... 09/26/12 77 FR 59156\n\nANPRM Comment Period End............ 11/26/12 .......................\n\nNPRM................................ 05/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Undetermined.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Agency Contact: Sujaya Dessai, Supervisory Veterinary Medical \n\nOfficer, Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug \n\nAdministration, Center for Veterinary Medicine, MPN-4, Room 2620, HFV-\n\n212, 7529 Standish Place, Rockville, MD 20855, Phone: 240 276-9075, \n\nEmail: sujaya.dessai@fda.hhs.gov\n\n RIN: 0910-AG45\n\nHHS--FDA\n\n52. Foreign Supplier Verification Program\n\n Priority: Economically Significant. Major under 5 U.S.C. 801.\n\n Unfunded Mandates: This action may affect the private sector under \n\nPub. L. 104-4.\n\n Legal Authority: 21 U.S.C. 384a; title III, sec 301 of FDA Food \n\nSafety Modernization Act, Pub. L. 111-353, establishing sec 805 of the \n\nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)\n\n CFR Citation: Not Yet Determined.\n\n Legal Deadline: Final, Statutory, January 4, 2012.\n\n Abstract: This rule describes what a food importer must do to \n\nverify that its foreign suppliers produce food that is as safe as food \n\nproduced in the United States. FDA is taking this action to improve the \n\nsafety of food that is imported into the United States.\n\n Statement of Need: The proposed rule is needed to help improve the \n\nsafety of food that is imported into the United States. Imported food \n\nproducts have increased dramatically over the last several decades. \n\nData indicate that about 15 percent of the U.S. food supply is \n\nimported. FSMA provides the Agency with additional tools and \n\nmailto:sujaya.dessai@fda.hhs.gov\n\n\nauthorities to help ensure that imported foods are safe for U.S. \n\nconsumers. Included among these tools and authorities is a requirement \n\nthat importers perform risk-based foreign supplier verification \n\nactivities to verify that the food they import is produced in \n\ncompliance with U.S. requirements, as applicable, and is not \n\nadulterated or misbranded. This proposed rule on the content of foreign \n\nsupplier verification programs (FSVPs) sets forth the proposed steps \n\nthat food importers would be required to take to fulfill their \n\nresponsibility to help ensure the safety of the food they bring into \n\nthis country.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Section 805(c) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \n\n384a(c)) directs FDA, not later than 1 year after the date of enactment \n\nof FSMA, to issue regulations on the content of FSVPs. Section \n\n805(c)(4) states that verification activities under such programs may \n\ninclude monitoring records for shipments, lot-by-lot certification of \n\ncompliance, annual onsite inspections, checking the hazard analysis and \n\nrisk-based preventive control plans of foreign suppliers, and \n\nperiodically testing and sampling shipments of imported products. \n\nSection 301(b) of FSMA amends section 301 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \n\n331) by adding section 301(zz), which designates as a prohibited act \n\nthe importation or offering for importation of a food if the importer \n\n(as defined in section 805) does not have in place an FSVP in \n\ncompliance with section 805. In addition, section 301(c) of FSMA amends \n\nsection 801(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 381(a)) by stating that an \n\narticle of food being imported or offered for import into the United \n\nStates shall be refused admission if it appears, from an examination of \n\na sample of such an article or otherwise, that the importer is in \n\nviolation of section 805.\n\n Alternatives: We are considering a range of alternative approaches \n\nto the requirements for foreign supplier verification activities. These \n\nmight include: (1) establishing a general requirement that importers \n\ndetermine and conduct whatever verification activity would adequately \n\naddress the risks associated with the foods they import; (2) allowing \n\nimporters to choose from a list of possible verification mechanisms, \n\nsuch as the activities listed in section 805(c)(4) of the FD&C Act; (3) \n\nrequiring importers to conduct particular verification activities for \n\ncertain types of foods or risks (e.g., for high-risk foods), but \n\nallowing flexibility in verification activities for other types of \n\nfoods or risks; and (4) specifying use of a particular verification \n\nactivity for each particular kind of food or risk. To the extent \n\npossible while still ensuring that verification activities are adequate \n\nto ensure that foreign suppliers are\n\n\n\n[[Page 76519]]\n\nproducing food in accordance with U.S. requirements, we will seek to \n\ngive importers the flexibility to choose verification procedures that \n\nare appropriate to adequately address the risks associated with the \n\nimportation of a particular food, and accounted for in the proposed \n\nrules that contain these requirements.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: We are still estimating the cost and \n\nbenefits for this proposed rule. However, the available information \n\nsuggests that, if finalized, the costs will be significant. Our \n\npreliminary analysis of FY10 OASIS data suggests that this rule will \n\ncover about 60,000 importers, 240,000 unique combinations of importers \n\nand foreign suppliers, and 540,000 unique combinations of importers, \n\nproducts, and foreign suppliers. These numbers imply that provisions \n\nthat require activity for each importer, each unique combination of \n\nimporter and foreign supplier, or each unique combination of importer, \n\nproduct, and foreign supplier will generate significant costs. An \n\nexample of a provision linked to combinations of importers and foreign \n\nsuppliers would be a requirement to conduct a verification activity, \n\nsuch as an onsite audit, under certain conditions. The cost of onsite \n\naudits will depend, in part, on whether foreign suppliers can provide \n\nthe same onsite audit results to different importers, or whether every \n\nimporter will need to take some action with respect to each of their \n\nforeign suppliers. The benefits of this proposed rule will consist of \n\nthe reduction of adverse health events linked to imported food that \n\ncould result from increased compliance with applicable requirements, \n\nand are accounted for in the proposed rules that contain those \n\nrequirements and are accounted for in the proposed rules that contain \n\nthose requirements.\n\n Risks: As stated above, about 15 percent of the U.S. food supply is \n\nimported, and many of these imported foods are high-risk commodities. \n\nAccording to recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and \n\nPrevention, each year, about 48 million Americans get sick, 128,000 are \n\nhospitalized, and 3,000 die from foodborne diseases. We expect that the \n\nadoption of FSVPs by food importers will benefit the public health by \n\nhelping to ensure that imported food is produced in compliance with \n\nother applicable food safety regulations.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 07/29/13 78 FR 45729\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 11/26/13 .......................\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 11/20/13 78 FR 69602\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended End.... 01/27/14 .......................\n\nSupplemental NPRM................... 09/29/14 79 FR 58573\n\nSupplemental NPRM Comment Period End 12/15/14 .......................\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 10/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n International Impacts: This regulatory action will be likely to \n\nhave international trade and investment effects, or otherwise be of \n\ninternational interest.\n\n Agency Contact: Brian L.

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \n\nmailto:brian.pendleton@fda.hhs.gov\n\n\nAct (FD&C Act), as amended by the Tobacco Control Act, permits FDA to \n\nissue regulations deeming other tobacco products to be subject to the \n\nFD&C Act. This rule would deem additional products meeting the \n\nstatutory definition of ``tobacco product'' to be subject to the FD&C \n\nAct, and would specify additional restrictions.\n\n Statement of Need: Currently, the Tobacco Control Act provides FDA \n\nwith immediate authority to regulate cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, \n\nroll-your-own tobacco, and smokeless tobacco. The Tobacco Control Act \n\nalso permits FDA to issue regulations deeming other tobacco products \n\nthat meet the statutory definition of ``tobacco product'' to also be \n\nsubject to the FD&C Act. This regulation is necessary to afford FDA the \n\nauthority to regulate additional products which include hookah, \n\nelectronic cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, other novel tobacco \n\nproducts, and future tobacco products.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Section 901 of the FD&C Act, as amended by \n\nthe Tobacco Control Act, permits FDA to issue regulations deeming other \n\ntobacco products to be subject to the FD&C Act. Section 906(d) provides \n\nFDA with the authority to propose restrictions on the sale and \n\ndistribution of tobacco products, including restrictions on the access \n\nto, and the advertising and promotion of, tobacco products if FDA \n\ndetermines that such regulation would be appropriate for the protection \n\nof the public health.\n\n Alternatives: In addition to the benefits and costs of both options \n\nfor the proposed rule, FDA assessed the benefits and costs of several \n\nalternatives to the proposed rule: e.g., deeming only, but exempt \n\nnewly-deemed products from certain requirements; exempt certain classes \n\nof products from certain requirements; deeming only, with no additional \n\nprovisions; and changes to the compliance periods.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The proposed rule consists of two \n\ncoproposals, option 1 and option 2. The proposed option 1 deems all \n\nproducts meeting the statutory definition of ``tobacco product'' except \n\naccessories of a proposed deemed tobacco product to be subject to \n\nchapter IX of the FD&C Act. Option 1 also proposes additional \n\nprovisions that would apply to proposed deemed products as well as to \n\ncertain other tobacco products. Option 2 is the same as option 1 except \n\nthat it exempts premium cigars. We expect that asserting our authority \n\nover these tobacco products will enable us to take further regulatory \n\naction in the future as appropriate; those actions will have their own \n\ncosts and benefits. The proposed rule would generate some direct \n\n\n\nbenefits by providing information to consumers about the risks and\n\n[[Page 76520]]\n\ncharacteristics of tobacco products which may result in consumers \n\nreducing their use of cigars and other tobacco products. Other \n\npotential benefits follow from premarket requirements which could \n\nprevent more harmful products from appearing on the market and \n\nworsening the health effects of tobacco product use. The proposed rule \n\nwould impose costs in the form of registration submission labeling and \n\nother requirements; other likely costs are not quantifiable based on \n\ncurrent data.\n\n Risks: Adolescence is the peak time for tobacco use initiation and \n\nexperimentation. In recent years, new and emerging tobacco products, \n\nsometimes referred to as ``novel tobacco products,'' have been \n\ndeveloped and are becoming an increasing concern to public health due, \n\nin part, to their appeal to youth and young adults. Non-regulated \n\ntobacco products come in many forms, including electronic cigarettes, \n\nnicotine gels, and certain dissolvable tobacco products (i.e., those \n\ndissolvable products that do not currently meet the definition of \n\nsmokeless tobacco under 21 U.S.C. 387(18) because they do not contain \n\ncut, ground, powdered, or leaf tobacco, and instead contain nicotine \n\nextracted from tobacco), and these products are widely available. This \n\ndeeming rule is necessary to provide FDA with authority to regulate \n\nthese products (e.g., registration, product and ingredient listing, \n\nuser fees for certain products, premarket requirements, and \n\nadulteration and misbranding provisions). In addition, the additonal \n\nrestrictions that FDA seeks to promulgate for the proposed deemed \n\nproducts will protect youth by restricting minors' access to these \n\nproducts and will increase consumer understanding of the impact of \n\nthese products on public health. This rule is consistent with other \n\napproaches that the Agency has taken to address the tobacco epidemic \n\nand is particularly necessary, given that consumer use may be \n\ngravitating to the proposed deemed products.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 04/25/14 79 FR 23142\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 07/09/14 .......................\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 06/24/14 79 FR 35711\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 08/08/14 .......................\n\n\n\nFinal Action........................ 06/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Undetermined.\n\n Federalism: Undetermined.\n\n International Impacts: This regulatory action will be likely to \n\nhave international trade and investment effects, or otherwise be of \n\ninternational interest.\n\n Agency Contact: Gerie Voss, Senior Regulatory Counsel, Department \n\nof Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Center for \n\nTobacco Products, Document Control Center, Building 71, Room G335, \n\n10903 New Hampshire Avenue, Silver Spring, MD 20993, Phone: 877 287-\n\n1373, Fax: 301 595-1426, Email: ctpregulations@fda.hhs.gov\n\n RIN: 0910-AG38\n\nHHS--FDA\n\n54. Food Labeling: Calorie Labeling of Articles of Food Sold in Vending \n\nMachines\n\n Priority: Economically Significant. Major under 5 U.S.C. 801.\n\n Legal Authority: 21 U.S.C. 321; 21 U.S.C. 343; 21 U.S.C. 371\n\n CFR Citation: Not Yet Determined.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: FDA published a proposed rule to establish requirements \n\nfor nutrition labeling of certain food items sold in certain vending \n\nmachines. FDA also proposed the terms and conditions for vending \n\nmachine operators registering to voluntarily be subject to the \n\nrequirements. FDA is issuing a final rule, and taking this action to \n\ncarry out section 4205 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n\nAct.\n\n Statement of Need: This rulemaking was mandated by section 4205 of \n\nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act).\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: On March 23, 2010, the Affordable Care Act \n\n(Pub. L. 111-148) was signed into law. Section 4205 amended 403(q)(5) \n\nof the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) by, among other \n\nthings, creating new clause (H) to require that vending machine \n\noperators, who own or operate 20 or more machines, disclose calories \n\nfor certain food items. FDA has the authority to issue this rule under \n\nsections 403(q)(5)(H) and 701(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \n\n343(q)(5)(H), and 371(a)). Section 701(a) of the FD&C Act vests the \n\nmailto:ctpregulations@fda.hhs.gov\n\n\nSecretary of Health and Human Services, and, by delegation, the Food \n\nand Drug Administration (FDA) with the authority to issue regulations \n\nfor the efficient enforcement of the FD&C Act.\n\n Alternatives: Section 4205 of the Affordable Care Act requires the \n\nSecretary (and by delegation, the FDA) to establish by regulation \n\nrequirements for calorie labeling of articles of food sold from covered \n\nvending machines. Therefore, there are no alternatives to rulemaking. \n\nFDA has analyzed alternatives that may reduce the burden of the \n\nrulemaking, including analyzing the benefits and costs of: restricting \n\nthe flexibility of the format for calorie disclosure, lengthening the \n\ncompliance time, and extending the coverage of the rule to bulk vending \n\nmachines without selection buttons.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Any vending machine operator \n\noperating fewer than 20 machines may voluntarily choose to be covered \n\nby the national standard. It is anticipated that vending machine \n\noperators that own or operate 20 or more vending machines will bear \n\ncosts associated with adding calorie information to vending machines. \n\nFDA initially estimated that the total cost of complying with section \n\n4205 of the Affordable Care Act and this rulemaking would be \n\napproximately $25.8 million initially, with a recurring cost of \n\napproximately $24 million.\n\n Because comprehensive national data for the effects of vending \n\nmachine labeling do not exist, FDA did not quantify the benefits \n\nassociated with section 4205 of the Affordable Care Act and this \n\nrulemaking in the proposed rule. Some studies have shown that some \n\nconsumers consume fewer calories when calorie content information is \n\ndisplayed at the point of purchase. Consumers will benefit from having \n\nthis important nutrition information to assist them in making healthier \n\nchoices when consuming food away from home. Given the very high costs \n\nassociated with obesity and its associated health risks, FDA estimated \n\nthat if 0.02 percent of the adult obese population reduces energy \n\nintake by at least 100 calories per week, then the benefits of section \n\n4205 of the Affordable Care Act and this rulemaking would be at least \n\nas large as the costs.\n\n Risks: Americans now consume an estimated one-third of their total \n\ncalories from foods prepared outside the home, and spend almost half of \n\ntheir food dollars on such foods. This rule will provide consumers with \n\ninformation about the nutritional content of food to enable them to \n\nmake healthier food choices, and may help mitigate the trend of \n\nincreasing obesity in America.\n\n Timetable:\n\n\n\n[[Page 76521]]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 04/06/11 76 FR 19238\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 07/05/11 .......................\n\nFinal Action........................ 11/00/14 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Governmental Jurisdictions.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, Local, State.\n\n Federalism: This action may have federalism implications as defined \n\nin EO 13132.\n\n Agency Contact: Daniel Reese, Food Technologist, Department of \n\nHealth and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Center for \n\nFood Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS-820), 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, \n\nCollege Park, MD 20740, Phone: 240 402-2126, Email: \n\ndaniel.reese@fda.hhs.gov\n\n RIN: 0910-AG56\n\nHHS--FDA\n\n55.

Section 4205 of the Affordable \n\nCare Act amended 403(q)(5) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n\n(FD&C Act) by, among other things, creating new clause (H) to require \n\nthat certain chain restaurants and similar retail food establishments \n\nwith 20 or more locations disclose certain nutrient information for \n\nstandard menu items. FDA has the authority to issue this rule under \n\nsections 403(a)(1), 403(q)(5)(H), and 701(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \n\n343(a)(1), 343(q)(5)(H), and 371(a)). Section 701(a) of the FD&C Act \n\nvests the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and, by delegation, \n\nthe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with the authority to issue \n\nregulations for the efficient enforcement of the FD&C Act.\n\n Alternatives: Section 4205 of the Affordable Care Act requires the \n\nSecretary, and by delegation the FDA, to establish by regulation \n\nrequirements for nutrition labeling of standard menu items for covered \n\nrestaurants and similar retail food establishments. Therefore, there \n\nare no alternatives to rulemaking. FDA has analyzed alternatives that \n\nmay reduce the burden of this rulemaking, including analyzing the \n\nbenefits and costs of expanding and contracting the set of \n\nestablishments covered by this rule, and shortening or lengthening the \n\ncompliance time relative to the rulemaking.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Chain restaurants and similar retail \n\nfood establishments covered by the Federal law operating in local \n\njurisdictions that impose different nutrition labeling requirements \n\nwill benefit from having a uniform national standard. Any restaurant or \n\nsimilar retail food establishment with fewer than 20 locations may \n\nvoluntarily choose to be covered by the national standard. It is \n\nanticipated that chain restaurants with 20 or more locations will bear \n\ncosts for adding nutrition information to menus and menu boards. FDA \n\ninitially estimated that the total cost of section 4205 and this \n\nrulemaking would be approximately $80 million, annualized over 10 \n\nyears, with a low annualized estimate of approximately $33 million and \n\na high annualized estimate of approximately $125 million over 10 years. \n\nThese costs (which are subject to change in the final rule) included an \n\ninitial cost of approximately $320 million with an annually recurring \n\ncost of $45 million.\n\n Because comprehensive national data for the effects of menu \n\nlabeling do not exist, FDA did not quantify the benefits associated \n\nwith section 4205 of the Affordable Care Act and this rulemaking. Some \n\nstudies have shown that some consumers consume fewer calories when \n\nmenus have information about calorie content displayed. Consumers will \n\nbenefit from having important nutrition information for the \n\napproximately 30 percent of calories consumed away from home. Given the \n\n\n\nvery high costs associated with obesity and its associated health \n\nrisks, FDA estimated that if 0.6 percent of the adult obese population \n\nreduces energy intake by at least 100 calories per week, then the \n\nbenefits of section 4205 of the Affordable Care Act and this rule would \n\nbe at least as large as the costs.\n\n Risks: Americans now consume an estimated one-third of their total \n\ncalories on foods prepared outside the home, and spend almost half of \n\ntheir food dollars on such foods. Unlike packaged foods that are \n\nlabeled with nutrition information, foods in restaurants, for the most \n\npart, do not have nutrition information that is readily available when \n\nordered. Dietary intake data have shown that obese Americans consume \n\nover 100 calories per meal more when eating food away from home, rather \n\nthan food at home. This rule will provide consumers information about \n\nthe nutritional content of food to enable them to make healthier food \n\nchoices, and may help mitigate the trend of increasing obesity in \n\nAmerica.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 04/06/11 76 FR 19192\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 07/05/11 .......................\n\nFinal Action........................ 11/00/14 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Governmental Jurisdictions.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, Local, State.\n\n Federalism: This action may have federalism implications as defined \n\nin EO 13132.\n\n Agency Contact: Daniel Reese, Food Technologist, Department of \n\nHealth and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Center for \n\nFood Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS-820), 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, \n\nCollege Park, MD 20740, Phone: 240 402-2126, Email: \n\ndaniel.reese@fda.hhs.gov\n\n RIN: 0910-AG57\n\nHHS--FDA\n\n56. Accreditation of Third-Party Auditors/Certification Bodies To \n\nConduct Food Safety Audits and To Issue Certifications\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\nmailto:daniel.reese@fda.hhs.gov\n\n\n Legal Authority: 21 U.S.C. 384d; Pub. L. 111-353; sec 307 FDA Food \n\nSafety Modernization Act; other sections of FDA Food Safety \n\nModernization Act, as appropriate; 21 U.S.C. 371; 21 U.S.C. 381; 21 \n\nU.S.C. 384b; . . .\n\n[[Page 76522]]\n\n CFR Citation: 21 CFR 1.\n\n Legal Deadline: Final, Statutory, July 2012, Promulgate \n\nimplementing regulations.\n\n Final, Judicial, October 31, 2015.\n\n Per Public Law 111-353, section 307, promulgate, within 18 months \n\nof enactment, certain implementing regulations for accreditation of \n\nthird-party auditors to conduct food safety audits. Per consent decree, \n\nFDA will submit the final rule to the Federal Register for publication \n\nby 10/31/15.\n\n Abstract: This rule establishes regulations for accreditation of \n\nthird-party auditors to conduct food safety audits. FDA is taking this \n\naction to improve the safety of food that is imported into the United \n\nStates.\n\n Statement of Need: The use of accredited third-party auditors to \n\ncertify food imports will assist in ensuring the safety of food from \n\nforeign origin entering U.S. commerce. Accredited third-party auditors \n\nauditing foreign facilities can increase FDA's information about \n\nforeign facilities that FDA may not have adequate resources to inspect \n\nin a particular year. FDA will establish identified standards creating \n\noverall uniformity to complete the task. Audits that result in issuance \n\nof facility certificates will provide FDA information about the \n\ncompliance status of the facility. Additionally, auditors will be \n\nrequired to submit audit reports that may be reviewed by FDA for \n\npurposes of compliance assessment and work planning.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Section 808 of the FD&C Act directs FDA to \n\nestablish, not later than 2 years after the date of enactment, a system \n\nfor the recognition of accreditation bodies that accredit third-party \n\nauditors, who, in turn, certify that their eligible entities meet the \n\nrequirements. If within 2 years after the date of the establishment of \n\nthe system, FDA has not identified and recognized an accreditation \n\nbody, FDA may directly accredit third party auditors.\n\n Alternatives: FSMA described in detail the framework for, and \n\nrequirements of, the accredited third-party auditor program. \n\nAlternatives include certain oversight activities required of \n\nrecognized accreditation bodies that accredit third-party auditors, as \n\ndistinguished from third-party auditors directly accredited by FDA. \n\n\n\nAnother alternative relates to the nature of the required standards and \n\nthe degree to which those standards are prescriptive or flexible.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The benefits of the proposed rule \n\nwould be less unsafe or misbranded food entering U.S. commerce. \n\nAdditional benefits include the increased flow of credible information \n\nto FDA regarding the compliance status of foreign firms and their foods \n\nthat are ultimately offered for import into the United States, which \n\ninformation, in turn, would inform FDA's work planning for inspection \n\nof foreign food facilities and might result in a signal of possible \n\nproblems with a particular firm or its products, and with sufficient \n\nsignals, might raise questions about the rigor of the food safety \n\nregulatory system of the country of origin. The compliance costs of the \n\nproposed rule would result from the additional labor and capital \n\nrequired of accreditation bodies seeking FDA recognition and of third-\n\nparty auditors seeking accreditation to the extent that will involve \n\nthe assembling of information for an application unique to the FDA \n\nthird-party program. The compliance costs associated with certification \n\nwill be accounted for separately under the costs associated with \n\nparticipation in the voluntary qualified importer program, and the \n\ncosts associated with mandatory certification for high-risk food \n\nimports. The third-party program is funded through revenue neutral-user \n\nfees, which will be developed by FDA through rulemaking. User fee costs \n\nwill be accounted for in that rulemaking.\n\n Risks: FDA is proposing this rule to provide greater assurance the \n\nfood offered for import into the United States is safe and will not \n\ncause injury or illness to animals or humans. The rule would implement \n\na program for accrediting third-party auditors to conduct food safety \n\naudits of foreign food entities, including registered foreign food \n\nfacilities, and based on the findings of the regulatory audit, to issue \n\ncertifications to foreign food entities found to be in compliance with \n\nFDA requirements. The certifications could be used by importers seeking \n\nto participate in the Voluntary Qualified Importer Program for \n\nexpedited review and entry of product, and would be a means to provide \n\nassurance of compliance as required by FDA based on risk-related \n\nconsiderations. The rule would apply to any foreign or domestic \n\naccreditation body seeking FDA recognition, any foreign or domestic \n\nthird-party auditor seeking accreditation, any registered foreign food \n\nfacility or other foreign food entity subject to a food safety audit \n\n(including a regulatory audit conducted for purposes of certification), \n\nand any importer seeking to participate in the Voluntary Qualified \n\n\n\nImporter Program. Fewer instances of unsafe or misbranded food entering \n\nU.S. commerce would reduce the risk of serious illness and death to \n\nhumans and animals.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 07/29/13 78 FR 45781\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 11/26/13 .......................\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 11/20/13 78 FR 69603\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended End.... 01/27/14 .......................\n\nFinal Action........................ 10/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Undetermined.\n\n International Impacts: This regulatory action will be likely to \n\nhave international trade and investment effects, or otherwise be of \n\ninternational interest.\n\n Agency Contact: Charlotte A.

Revision of Postmarketing Reporting Requirements Discontinuance or \n\nInterruption in Supply of Certain Products (Drug Shortages)\n\n Priority: Economically Significant. Major under 5 U.S.C. 801.\n\n Legal Authority: secs 506c, 506c-1, 506d, and 506f of the FDA&C \n\nAct, as amended by title X (Drug Shortages) of FDASIA, Pub. L. 112-144, \n\nJuly 9, 2012\n\n CFR Citation: 21 CFR 314.81; 21 CFR 314.91.\n\n Legal Deadline: NPRM, Statutory, January 9, 2014, Not later than 18 \n\nmonths after the date of enactment of FDASIA, FDA must adopt the final \n\nregulation implementing section 506C as amended.\n\n Section 1001 of FDASIA states that not later than 18 months after \n\nthe date of enactment of FDASIA, the Secretary shall adopt a final \n\nregulation implementing section 506(c) as amended.\n\n Abstract: This rule would require manufacturers of certain drug \n\nproducts to report discontinuances or\n\nmailto:charlotte.christin@fda.hhs.gov\n\n\n[[Page 76523]]\n\ninterruptions in the manufacturing of these products 6 months prior to \n\nthe discontinuance or interruption, or if that is not possible, as soon \n\nas practicable. Manufacturers must notify FDA of a discontinuance or \n\ninterruption in the manufacture of drugs that are life-supporting, \n\nlife-sustaining, or intended for use in the prevention or treatment of \n\na debilitating disease or condition.\n\n Statement of Need: The Food and Drug Administration Safety and \n\nInnovation Act (FDASIA), Public Law 112-144 (July 9, 2012), amends the \n\nFD&C Act to require manufacturers of certain drug products to report to \n\nFDA discontinuances or interruptions in the production of these \n\nproducts that are likely to meaningfully disrupt supply 6 months prior \n\nto the discontinuance or interruption, or if that is not possible, as \n\nsoon as practicable. FDASIA also amends the FD&C Act to include other \n\nprovisions related to drug shortages. Drug shortages have a significant \n\nimpact on patient access to critical medications, and the number of \n\ndrug shortages has risen steadily since 2005 to a high of 251 shortages \n\nin 2011. Notification to FDA of a shortage or an issue that may lead to \n\na shortage is critical--FDA was able to prevent more than 100 shortages \n\nin the first 3 quarters of 2012 due to early notification. This rule \n\nwill implement the FDASIA drug shortages provisions, allowing FDA to \n\nmore quickly and efficiently respond to shortages, thereby improving \n\npatient access to critical medications, and promoting public health.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Sections 506(c), 506(c)-1, 506(d), 506(e), \n\nand 506(f) of the FD&C Act, as amended by title X (Drug Shortages) of \n\nFDASIA.\n\n Alternatives: The principal alternatives assessed were to provide \n\nguidance on voluntary notification to FDA, or to continue to rely on \n\nthe requirements under the current interim final rule on notification. \n\nThese alternatives would not meet the statutory requirement to issue \n\nthe final regulation required by title X, section 1001 of FDASIA.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The rule would increase the modest \n\nreporting costs associated with notifying FDA of discontinuances or \n\ninterruptions in the production of certain drug products. The rule \n\nwould generate benefits in the form of the value of public health gains \n\nthrough more rapid and effective FDA responses to potential, or actual \n\ndrug shortages that otherwise would limit patient access to critical \n\nmedications.\n\n Risks: Drug shortages can significantly impede patient access to \n\n\n\ncritical, sometimes life-saving, medications. Drug shortages, \n\ntherefore, can pose a serious risk to public health and patient safety. \n\nThis rule will require early notification of potential shortages, \n\nenabling FDA to more quickly and effectively respond to potential or \n\nactual drug shortages that otherwise would limit patient access to \n\ncritical medications.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 11/04/13 78 FR 65904\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 01/03/14 .......................\n\nFinal Action........................ 01/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Undetermined.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Agency Contact: Valerie Jensen, Associate Director, CDER Drug \n\nShortage Staff, Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug \n\nAdministration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, WO Building \n\n22, Room 6202, 10903 New Hampshire Avenue, Silver Spring, MD 20903, \n\nPhone: 301 796-0737.\n\n RIN: 0910-AG88\n\nHHS--FDA\n\n58.

ANDA \n\nholders, like NDA holders and BLA holders, are required to promptly \n\n\n\nreview all adverse drug experience information obtained or otherwise \n\nreceived, and comply with applicable reporting and recordkeeping \n\nrequirements. However, under current FDA regulations, ANDA holders are \n\nnot permitted to use the CBE supplement process in the same manner as \n\nNDA holders and BLA holders to independently update product labeling \n\nwith certain newly acquired safety information. This regulatory \n\ndifference recently has been determined to mean that an individual can \n\nbring a product liability action for ``failure to warn'' against an NDA \n\nholder, but generally not an ANDA holder. This may alter the incentives \n\nfor generic drug manufacturers to comply with current requirements to \n\nconduct robust postmarketing surveillance, evaluation, and reporting, \n\nand to ensure that their product labeling is accurate and up-to-date. \n\nAccordingly, there is a need for ANDA holders to be able to \n\nindependently update product labeling to reflect certain newly acquired \n\nsafety information as part of the ANDA holder's independent \n\nresponsibility to ensure that its product labeling is accurate and up-\n\nto-date.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) and \n\nthe PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) provide FDA with authority over the \n\nlabeling for drugs and biological products, and authorize the Agency to \n\nenact regulations to facilitate FDA's review and approval of \n\napplications regarding the labeling for those products. FDA's authority \n\nto extend the CBE supplement process for certain safety-related \n\nlabeling changes to ANDA holders arises from the same authority under \n\nwhich FDA's regulations relating to NDA holders and BLA holders were \n\nissued.\n\n Alternatives: FDA is considering several alternatives described in \n\ncomments submitted to the public docket established for the proposed \n\nrule.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: FDA is reviewing comments submitted \n\nto the public docket and evaluating the anticipated costs and benefits \n\nthat would be associated with a final rule.\n\n Risks: This rule is intended to remove obstacles to the prompt \n\ncommunication of safety-related labeling changes that meet the \n\nregulatory criteria for a CBE supplement. The rule may encourage \n\ngeneric drug companies to participate more actively with FDA in \n\nensuring the timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of drug safety \n\nlabeling in accordance with current regulatory requirements. FDA's \n\nposting of information on its Web site regarding the safety-related \n\nlabeling changes proposed in pending CBE supplements would enhance \n\ntransparency, and facilitate access by health care providers and the \n\n\n\npublic so that such information may be used to inform treatment \n\ndecisions.\n\n Timetable:\n\n[[Page 76524]]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 11/13/13 78 FR 67985\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 01/13/14 .......................\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 12/27/13 78 FR 78796\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 03/13/14 .......................\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 09/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Undetermined.\n\n Agency Contact: Janice L.

Veterinary Feed Directive\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 21 U.S.C. 354; 21 U.S.C. 360b; 21 U.S.C. 360ccc; \n\n21 U.S.C. 360ccc-1; 21 U.S.C. 371\n\n CFR Citation: 21 CFR 514; 21 CFR 558.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: The Animal Drug Availability Act created a new category \n\nof products called veterinary feed directive (VFD) drugs. This \n\nrulemaking is intended to provide for the increased efficiency of the \n\nVFD program.\n\n Statement of Need: Before 1996, two options existed for regulating \n\nthe distribution of animal drugs, including drugs in animal feed: (1) \n\nOver-the-counter (OTC); and (2) prescription (Rx). In 1996, the Animal \n\nDrug Availability Act (ADAA) created a new category of products called \n\nveterinary feed directive (VFD) drugs. VFD drugs are new animal drugs \n\nintended for use in or on animal feed, which are limited to use under \n\nmailto:janice.weiner@fda.hhs.gov\n\n\nthe professional supervision of a licensed veterinarian in the course \n\nof the veterinarian's professional practice. In order for animal feed \n\ncontaining a VFD drug to be used in animals, a licensed veterinarian \n\nmust first issue an order, called a veterinary feed directive (or VFD), \n\nproviding for such use. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the \n\nAgency) finalized its regulation to implement the VFD-related \n\nprovisions of the ADAA in December 2000. Since that time, FDA has \n\nreceived informal comments that the VFD process is overly burdensome. \n\nAs a result, FDA began exploring ways to improve the VFD program's \n\nefficiency. To that end, FDA published an advanced notice of proposed \n\nrulemaking on March 29, 2010 (75 FR 15387), and draft text of a \n\nproposed regulation, which it published April 13, 2012 (77 FR 22247). \n\nThe proposed revisions to the VFD process are also intended to support \n\nthe Agency's initiative to transition certain new animal drug products \n\ncontaining medically important antimicrobial drugs from an OTC status \n\nto a status that requires veterinary oversight. The proposed rule, if \n\nfinalized, will make the following changes to the VFD regulations at \n\nsection 558.6 (21 CFR 558.6): (1) Reorganize the VFD regulations to \n\nmake them more user-friendly. This proposal will replace the six \n\nsubsections of the existing regulations with three subsections that \n\nbetter identify what is expected from each party involved in the VFD \n\nprocess; (2) provide increased flexibility for licensed veterinarians \n\nand animal producers to align with the most recent practice standards, \n\ntechnological and medical advances, and practical considerations, to \n\nassure the safe and effective use of VFD drugs; (3) provide for the \n\ncontinued availability through the current feed mill distribution \n\nsystem of those Category I drugs that move to VFD dispensing status. \n\nThis will prevent potential shortages of antimicrobial drugs needed by \n\nfood animal producers for judicious therapeutic uses on their farms and \n\nranches; and (4) lower the recordkeeping burden for all involved \n\nparties to align with other feed manufacturing recordkeeping \n\nrequirements, thus eliminating the need for two separate filing \n\nsystems.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: FDA's authority for issuing this rule is \n\nprovided in the ADAA (Pub. L. 104-250), which amended the Federal Food, \n\nDrug, & Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) by establishing section 504.\n\n Alternatives: An alternative to the proposed rule that would ease \n\nthe burden on VFD drug manufacturers would be to allow additional time \n\nto comply with the proposed labeling requirements for currently \n\n\n\napproved VFD drugs, for example, 1 or more years after the final rule \n\nbecomes effective. This would not affect any new VFD drug approvals \n\nafter the effective date of the final rule, and it could provide a \n\ntransition period for current VFD manufacturers to coordinate the \n\nlabeling changes to the specimen labeling, representative labeling, the \n\nVFD form itself, and advertising within the usual frequency of label \n\nchanges.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The estimated one-time costs to \n\nindustry from this proposed rule, if finalized, are the costs to review \n\nthe rule and prepare a compliance plan. In addition, FDA estimates that \n\nthe government will incur costs associated with reviewing the VFD drug \n\nlabeling supplements that are expected to be submitted by the existing \n\nVFD drug manufacturers. The expected benefit of this proposal is a \n\ngeneral improvement in the efficiency of the VFD process. Additionally, \n\nthe reduction in veterinarian labor costs due to this rule is expected \n\nto result in an annual cost savings.\n\n Risks: As FDA continues to implement the judicious use principles \n\nfor medically important antimicrobial drugs based on the framework set \n\nforth in Guidance for Industry #209, which published April 13, 2012, it \n\nis critical that the Agency makes the VFD program as efficient as \n\npossible for stakeholders while maintaining adequate protection for \n\nhuman and animal health. The provisions included in this proposed rule \n\nare based on stakeholder input received in response to multiple \n\nopportunities for public comment, and represent FDA's best effort to \n\nstrike the appropriate balance between protection of human and animal \n\nhealth and programmatic efficiency.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nANPRM............................... 03/29/10 75 FR 15387\n\nANPRM Comment Period End............ 06/28/10 .......................\n\nNPRM................................ 12/12/13 78 FR 75515\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 03/12/14 .......................\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 04/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n\n\n Agency Contact: Sujaya Dessai, Supervisory Veterinary Medical \n\nOfficer, Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug \n\nAdministration, Center for Veterinary Medicine, MPN-4, Room 2620, HFV-\n\n212, 7529 Standish Place, Rockville, MD 20855, Phone: 240 276-9075, \n\nEmail: sujaya.dessai@fda.hhs.gov\n\n RIN: 0910-AG95\n\n[[Page 76525]]\n\nHHS--CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS)\n\nProposed Rule Stage\n\n60.

These proposed changes are necessary to reflect the \n\nsubstantial advances that have been made over the past several years in \n\nthe theory and practice of service delivery and safety. These proposals \n\nare also an integral part of our efforts to achieve broad-based \n\nimprovements both in the quality of health care furnished through \n\nFederal programs, and in patient safety, while at the same time \n\nreducing procedural burdens on providers.\n\n Statement of Need: CMS has not comprehensively reviewed the entire \n\nset of requirements for participation it imposes on facilities in many \n\nyears. Over the years, the Agency and its stakeholders have identified \n\nproblematic requirements. Accordingly, we conducted a review of the \n\nrequirements in an effort to improve the quality of life, care, and \n\nservices in facilities; optimize resident safety; reflect current \n\nprofessional standards; and improve the logical flow of the \n\nregulations. Based on our analysis, we decided to pursue those \n\nregulatory revisions that would reflect the advances that have been \n\nmade in health care delivery and that would improve resident safety.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The Medicare requirements for participation \n\nfor long-term care facilities were published in the Federal Register on \n\nmailto:sujaya.dessai@fda.hhs.gov\n\n\nFebruary 2, 1989. These regulations have been revised and added to \n\nsince that time, principally as a result of legislation or a need to \n\naddress a specific issue; however, they have not been comprehensively \n\nreviewed and updated since September 26, 1991, despite substantial \n\nchanges in service delivery in this setting. Additionally, we are \n\nproposing to add the statutory authority citations for sections \n\n1128I(b) and (c) of the Act to include the compliance and ethics \n\nprogram and Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement (QAPI) \n\nrequirements under section 6102 of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n Alternatives: The requirements for long-term care facilities have \n\nnot been comprehensively updated in many years, but the effective and \n\nefficient delivery of health care services has changed substantially in \n\nthat time. We could choose not to make any regulatory changes; however, \n\nwe believe the changes we are proposing are necessary to ensure the \n\nrequirements are consistent with current standards of practice and \n\ncontinue to meet statutory obligations. They will ensure that residents \n\nreceive care that maintains or enhances quality of life and attains or \n\nmaintains the resident's highest practicable physical, mental, and \n\npsychosocial well-being.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: This proposed rule would implement \n\ncomprehensive changes intended to update the current requirements for \n\nlong-term care facilities and create new efficiencies and flexibilities \n\nfor facilities. In addition, these changes will support improved \n\nresident quality of life and quality of care. Many of the quality of \n\nlife improvements we are proposing are grounded in the concepts of \n\nperson-centered care and culture change. These changes not only result \n\nin improved quality of life for the resident, but can result in \n\nimprovements in the caregiver's quality of work life and in savings to \n\nthe facility. Savings can be accrued through reduced turnover, \n\ndecreased use of agency labor and decreased worker compensation costs. \n\nFacilities may also benefit from improved bed occupancy rates. As we \n\nmove toward publication, estimates of the cost and benefits of these \n\nimportant initiatives will be included in the rule.\n\n Risks: None. The proposed requirements in this rule would update \n\nthe existing requirements for long-term care facilities to reflect \n\ncurrent standards of practice. In addition, proposed changes would \n\nprovide added flexibility to providers, improve efficiency and \n\neffectiveness, enhance resident quality of care and quality of life, \n\nand potentially improve clinical outcomes.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 03/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Governmental Jurisdictions.\n\n Government Levels Affected: State.\n\n Additional Information: Includes Retrospective Review under E.O. \n\n13563.\n\n Agency Contact: Ronisha Davis, Health Insurance Specialist, \n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare & \n\nMedicaid Services, Center for Clinical Standards and Quality, Mail Stop \n\nS3-02-01, 7500 Security Blvd., Baltimore, MD 21244, Phone: 410 786-\n\n6882, Email: ronisha.davis@cms.hhs.gov\n\n RIN: 0938-AR61.\n\nHHS--CMS\n\n61. Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008; The \n\nApplication to Medicaid Managed Care, Chip, And Alternative Benefit \n\nPlans (CMS-2333-P)\n\n Priority: Economically Significant. Major under 5 U.S.C. 801.\n\n Unfunded Mandates: Undetermined.\n\n Legal Authority: 42 U.S.C. 1302; Pub. L. 110-343; Pub.

These final MHPAEA \n\nprovisions do not apply to Medicaid MCOs, ABPs, or CHIP State plans. \n\nThis rule proposes to address how MHPAEA requirements, including those \n\nimplemented in the November 13, 2013, final rule, apply to MCOs, ABPs, \n\nand CHIP.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: There are several statutes that are \n\ndirectly related to MHPAEA application to Medicaid. These include the \n\nmailto:ronisha.davis@cms.hhs.gov\n\n\nMHPAEA, sections 511 and 512 of the Tax Extenders and Alternative \n\nMinimum Tax Relief Act of 2008, the Employee Retirement Income Security \n\nAct of 1974 (ERISA), the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), and the \n\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 (Code). Section 2103(c) of the Social \n\nSecurity Act (the Act) added paragraph (6), which incorporates, by \n\nreference, provisions added to section 2705 of the Public Health \n\nService Act (PHSA) to apply MHPAEA to CHIP. Finally, the\n\n[[Page 76526]]\n\nAffordable Care Act expanded the application of MHPAEA to benefits in \n\nMedicaid ABPs.\n\n Alternatives: None. A rule is needed to address the provisions of \n\nMHPAEA as they apply to Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent, \n\nCHIP, and MCOs.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: As we move toward publication, \n\nestimates of the cost and benefits of these provisions will be included \n\nin the rule.\n\n Risks: None. This rule approaches the application of MHPAEA to \n\nMedicaid MCOs, ABPs, and CHIP by building upon the policies set forth \n\nin the final MHPAEA regulation. Our goal is to align as much as \n\npossible with the approach taken in the final MHPAEA regulation in \n\norder to avoid confusion or conflict, while remaining true to the \n\nintent of the MHPAEA statute and the Medicaid program and CHIP.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 03/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Undetermined.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Governmental Jurisdictions, \n\nOrganizations.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, Local, State, Tribal.\n\n Federalism: Undetermined.\n\n Agency Contact: John O'Brien, Health Insurance Specialist, \n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare & \n\nMedicaid Services, Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services, MS: S2-14-26, \n\n7500 Security Blvd., Baltimore, MD 21244, Phone: 410 786-5529, Email: \n\njohn.o'brien3@cms.hhs.gov\n\nmailto:brien3@cms.hhs.gov\n\n\n RIN: 0938-AS24\n\nHHS--CMS\n\n62. Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Programs--Stage 3 (CMS-\n\n3310-P)\n\n Priority: Economically Significant. Major under 5 U.S.C. 801.\n\n Unfunded Mandates: Undetermined.\n\n Legal Authority: Pub. L. 111-5, title IV of Division B\n\n CFR Citation: 45 CFR 170; 42 CFR 412; 42 CFR 413; 42 CFR 495.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: This proposed rule would establish policies related to \n\nStage 3 of meaningful use for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive \n\nPrograms. Stage 3 will focus on improving health care outcomes and \n\nfurther advance interoperability.\n\n Statement of Need: This rule is necessary to implement the \n\nprovisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) that \n\nprovide incentive payments to eligible professionals (EPs), eligible \n\nhospitals, and critical access hospitals (CAHs) participating in \n\nMedicare and Medicaid programs that adopt and meaningfully use \n\ncertified EHR technology. The rule specifies applicable criteria for \n\ndemonstrating Stage 3 of meaningful use.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: ARRA amended titles XVIII and XIX of the \n\nSocial Security Act (the Act) to authorize incentive payments to EPs, \n\neligible hospitals, CAHs, and Medicare Advantage (MA) Organizations to \n\npromote the adoption and meaningful use of certified EHR technology.\n\n Alternatives: None. In this proposed rule, CMS will implement Stage \n\n3, another stage of the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Program as \n\nrequired by ARRA. We are proposing the Stage 3 criteria that EP's, \n\neligible hospitals, and CAHs must meet in order to successfully \n\ndemonstrate meaningful use under the Medicare and Medicaid EHR \n\nIncentive Programs, focusing on advanced use of EHR technology to \n\npromote improved outcomes for patients. Stage 3 will also propose \n\nchanges to the reporting period, timelines, and structure of the \n\nprogram, including providing a single definition of meaningful use. \n\nThese changes will provide a flexible, yet, clearer framework to ensure \n\nfuture sustainability of the EHR program and reduce confusion stemming \n\nfrom multiple stage requirements.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits:\n\n We expect that benefits to the program will accrue in the form of \n\n\n\nsavings to Medicare through the Medicare payment adjustments. Expected \n\nqualitative benefits, such as improved quality of care and better \n\nhealth outcomes are unable to be quantified at this time, but we \n\nbelieve that savings will likely result from reductions in the cost of \n\nproviding care.\n\n Risks: CMS anticipates many positive effects of adopting EHR on \n\nhealth care providers, apart from the incentive payments to be provided \n\nunder this proposed rule. We believe there are benefits that can be \n\nobtained by eligible hospitals and EPs, including: Reductions in \n\nmedical recordkeeping costs, reductions in repeat tests, decreases in \n\nlength of stay, and reduced errors. When used effectively, EHRs can \n\nenable providers to deliver health care more efficiently. For example, \n\nEHRs can reduce the duplication of diagnostic tests, prompt providers \n\nto prescribe cost effective generic medications, remind patients about \n\npreventive care, reduce unnecessary office visits, and assist in \n\nmanaging complex care.\n\n We are working with the Office of the National Coordinator for \n\nHealth Information Technology to ensure that the Stage 3 meaningful use \n\ndefinition coordinates with the standards and certification \n\nrequirements being proposed and that there is sufficient time to \n\nupgrade and implement these changes. Stage 2 has been extended so that \n\nStage 3 will not begin until 2017.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 02/00/15\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Undetermined.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Governmental Jurisdictions.\n\n Government Levels Affected: State.\n\n Federalism: Undetermined.\n\n Agency Contact: Elizabeth S.

In addition, we describe the proposed \n\nchanges to the amounts and factors used to determine the rates for \n\nMedicare hospital inpatient services for operating costs and capital-\n\nrelated costs. Also, CMS annually updates the payment rates for the \n\nMedicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital \n\nservices provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs).

In addition, the \n\nrule proposes changes to the ambulatory surgical center payment system \n\nmailto:donald.thompson@cms.hhs.gov\n\n\nlist of services and rates.\n\n Statement of Need: Medicare pays over 4,000 hospitals for \n\noutpatient department services under the hospital outpatient \n\nprospective payment system (OPPS). The OPPS is based on groups of \n\nclinically similar services called ambulatory payment classification \n\ngroups (APCs). CMS annually revises the APC payment amounts based on \n\nthe most recent claims data, proposes new payment policies, and updates \n\nthe payments for inflation using the hospital operating market basket. \n\nMedicare pays roughly 5,000 Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs) under \n\nthe ASC payment system. CMS annually revises the payment under the ASC \n\npayment system, proposes new policies, and updates payments for \n\ninflation. CMS will issue a final rule containing the payment rates for \n\nthe 2016 OPPS and ASC payment system at least 60 days before January 1, \n\n2016.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Section 1833 of the Social Security Act \n\nestablishes Medicare payment for hospital outpatient services and ASC \n\nservices. The rule revises the Medicare hospital OPPS and ASC payment \n\nsystem to implement applicable statutory requirements. In addition, the \n\nrule describes changes to the outpatient APC system, relative payment \n\nweights, outlier adjustments, and other amounts and factors used to \n\ndetermine the payment rates for Medicare hospital outpatient services \n\npaid under the prospective payment system as well as changes to the \n\nrates and services paid under the ASC payment system.

This rule reflects new statutory \n\neligibility provisions; changes to provide States more flexibility to \n\ncoordinate Medicaid and CHIP eligibility notices, appeals, and other \n\nrelated administrative procedures with similar procedures used by other \n\nhealth coverage programs authorized under the Affordable Care Act; \n\nmodernizes and streamlines existing rules, eliminates obsolete rules, \n\nand updates provisions to reflect Medicaid eligibility pathways; \n\nmailto:marjorie.baldo@cms.hhs.gov\n\n\nimplements other CHIPRA eligibility-related provisions, including \n\neligibility for newborns whose mothers were eligible for and receiving \n\nMedicaid or CHIP coverage at the time of birth. With publication of \n\nthis final rule, we desire to make our implementing regulations \n\navailable to States and the public as soon as possible to facilitate \n\ncontinued efficient operation of the State flexibility authorized under \n\nsection 1937 of the Act.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The Affordable Care Act extends and \n\nsimplifies Medicaid eligibility. In the July 15, 2013, Federal \n\nRegister, we issued the ``Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance \n\nPrograms: Essential Health Benefits in Alternative Benefit Plans, \n\nEligibility Notices, Fair Hearing and Appeal Processes, and Premiums \n\nand Cost Sharing; Exchanges: Eligibility and Enrollment'' final rule \n\nthat finalized certain key Medicaid and CHIP eligibility provisions \n\nincluded in the January 22, 2013, proposed rule. In this final rule, we \n\nare addressing the remaining provisions of the January 22, 2013, \n\nproposed rule.\n\n Alternatives: The majority of Medicaid and CHIP eligibility \n\nprovisions proposed in this rule serve to implement the Affordable Care \n\nAct. All of the provisions in this final rule are a result of the \n\npassage of the Affordable Care Act and are largely self-implementing. \n\nTherefore, alternatives considered for this final rule were constrained \n\ndue to the statutory provisions.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The March 23, 2012 Medicaid \n\neligibility final rule detailed the impact of the Medicaid eligibility \n\nchanges related to implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The \n\nmajority of provisions included in this final rule were described in \n\ndetail in that rule, but in summary, we estimate a total savings of \n\n$465 million over 5 years, including $280 million in cost savings to \n\nthe Federal Government and $185 million in savings to States.\n\n Risks: None. Delaying publication of this final rule delays states \n\nfrom moving forward with implementing changes to Medicaid and CHIP, and \n\naligning operations between Medicaid, CHIP and the Exchanges.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinal Action........................ 11/00/14 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, Local, State, Tribal.\n\n Agency Contact: Sarah DeLone, Health Insurance Specialist, \n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare & \n\nMedicaid Services, Mail Stop S2-01-16, 7500 Security Boulevard, \n\nBaltimore, MD 21244, Phone: 410 786-0615, Email: \n\nsarah.delone@cms.hhs.gov\n\n Related RIN: Related to 0938-AR04.\n\n RIN: 0938-AS27\n\nHHS--ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES (ACF)\n\nFinal Rule Stage\n\n67.

It would \n\nmake changes in four key areas: (1) Improving health and safety; (2) \n\nimproving the quality of child care; (3) establishing family-friendly \n\npolicies; and (4) strengthening program integrity. The rule seeks to \n\nretain much of the flexibility afforded to States, territories, and \n\ntribes consistent with the nature of a block grant.\n\n Statement of Need: The CCDF program has far-reaching implications \n\nfor America's poorest children. It provides child care assistance to \n\n1.6 million children from nearly 1 million low-income working families \n\nand families who are attending school or job training. Half of the \n\nchildren served are living at or below poverty level. In addition, \n\nchildren who receive CCDF are cared for alongside children who do not \n\nreceive CCDF, by approximately\n\n[[Page 76529]]\n\n570,000 participating child care providers, some of whom lack basic \n\nmailto:sarah.delone@cms.hhs.gov\n\n\nassurances needed to ensure children are safe, healthy, and learning. \n\nSince 1996, a body of research has demonstrated the importance of the \n\nearly years on brain development and has shown that high-quality, \n\nconsistent child care can positively impact later success in school and \n\nlife. This is especially true for low-income children who face a school \n\nreadiness and achievement gap and can benefit the most from high-\n\nquality early learning environments. In light of this research, many \n\nStates, territories, and tribes, working collaboratively with the \n\nFederal Government, have taken important steps over the last 15 years \n\nto make the CCDF program more child-focused and family-friendly; \n\nhowever, implementation of these evidence-informed practices is uneven \n\nacross the country and critical gaps remain. This regulatory action is \n\nneeded in order to increase accountability in the CCDF program by \n\nensuring that all children receiving federally funded child care \n\nassistance are in safe, quality programs that both support their \n\nparent's labor market participation, and help children develop the \n\ntools and skills they need to reach their full potential. A major focus \n\nof this final rule is to raise the bar on quality by establishing a \n\nfloor of health and safety standards for child care paid for with \n\nFederal funds. National surveys have demonstrated that most parents \n\nlogically assume that their child care providers have had a background \n\ncheck, have had training in child health and safety, and are regularly \n\nmonitored. However, State policies surrounding the training and \n\noversight of child care providers vary widely. In some States, many \n\nchildren receiving CCDF subsidies are cared for by providers that have \n\nlittle to no oversight with respect to compliance with basic standards \n\ndesigned to safeguard children's well-being, such as first-aid and safe \n\nsleep practices. This can leave children in unsafe conditions, even as \n\ntheir care is being funded with public dollars. In addition, the final \n\nrule empowers all parents who choose child care, regardless of whether \n\nthey receive a Federal subsidy, with better information to make the \n\nbest choices for their children. This includes providing parents with \n\ninformation about the quality of child care providers and making \n\ninformation about providers' compliance with health and safety \n\nregulations more transparent so that parents can be aware of the safety \n\ntrack record of providers when it's time to choose child care.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: This final regulation is being issued under \n\nthe authority granted to the Secretary of Health and Human Services by \n\nthe CCDBG Act (42 U.S.C. 9858 et seq.) and section 418 of the Social \n\nSecurity Act (42 U.S.C. 618).\n\n Alternatives: The Administration for Children and Families \n\n\n\nconsidered a range of approaches to improve early childhood care and \n\neducation, including administrative and regulatory action. ACF has \n\ntaken administrative actions to recommend that States adopt stronger \n\nhealth and safety requirements and provided technical assistance to \n\nStates. Despite these efforts to assist States in making voluntary \n\nreforms, unacceptable health and safety lapses remain. An alternative \n\nto this rule would be to take no regulatory action or to limit the \n\nnature of the required standards and the degree to which those \n\nstandards are prescriptive. ACF believes this rulemaking is the \n\npreferable alternative to ensure children's health and safety and \n\npromote their learning and development.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Changes in this final rule directly \n\nbenefit children and parents who use CCDF assistance to pay for child \n\ncare. The 1.6 million children who are in child care funded by CCDF \n\nwould have stronger protections for their health and safety, which \n\naddresses every parent's paramount concern. All children in the care of \n\na participating CCDF provider will be safer because that provider is \n\nmore knowledgeable about health and safety issues. In addition, the \n\nfamilies of the 12 million children who are served in child care will \n\nbenefit from having clear, accessible information about the safety \n\ncompliance records and quality indicators of providers available to \n\nthem as they make critical choices about where their children will be \n\ncared for while they work. Provisions also will benefit child care \n\nproviders by encouraging States to invest in high quality child care \n\nproviders and professional development and to take into account quality \n\nwhen they determine child care payment rates. A primary reason for \n\nrevising the CCDF regulations is to better reflect current State and \n\nlocal practices to improve the quality of child care. Therefore, there \n\nare a significant number of States, territories, and tribes that have \n\nalready implemented many of these policies. The cost of implementing \n\nthe changes in this final rule will vary depending on a State's \n\nspecific situation. ACF does not believe the costs of this final \n\nregulatory action would be economically significant and that the \n\ntremendous benefits to low-income children justify costs associated \n\nwith this final rule.\n\n Risks: Not applicable.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nNPRM................................ 05/20/13 78 FR 29422\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 08/05/13 .......................\n\nFinal Action........................ 12/00/14 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: State, Tribal.\n\n Agency Contact: Andrew Williams, Policy Division Director, \n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children \n\nand Families, Office of Child Care, 370 L'Enfant Promenade SW., \n\nWashington, DC 20447, Phone: 202 401-4795, Fax: 202 690-5600, Email: \n\nandrew.williams@acf.hhs.gov\n\n RIN: 0970-AC53\n\nBILLING CODE 4150-24-P\n\nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY (DHS)\n\nFall 2014 Statement of Regulatory Priorities\n\n The Department of Homeland Security (DHS or Department) was created \n\nin 2003 pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Public Law 107-\n\n296. DHS has a vital mission: To secure the Nation from the many \n\nthreats we face. This requires the dedication of more than 225,000 \n\nemployees in jobs that range from aviation and border security to \n\nemergency response, from cybersecurity analyst to chemical facility \n\ninspector. Our duties are wide-ranging, but our goal is clear--keeping \n\nAmerica safe.\n\n Our mission gives us six main areas of responsibility:\n\n 1. Prevent Terrorism and Enhance Security,\n\n 2. Secure and Manage Our Borders,\n\n 3. Enforce and Administer our Immigration Laws,\n\n 4. Safeguard and Secure Cyberspace,\n\n 5. Ensure Resilience to Disasters, and\n\n 6. Mature and Strengthen DHS\n\n In achieving these goals, we are continually strengthening our \n\npartnerships with communities, first responders, law enforcement, and \n\ngovernment agencies--at the State, local, tribal, Federal, and \n\ninternational levels. We are accelerating the deployment of science, \n\ntechnology, and innovation in order to make America more secure, and we \n\nare becoming\n\n[[Page 76530]]\n\nleaner, smarter, and more efficient, ensuring that every security \n\nmailto:andrew.williams@acf.hhs.gov\n\n\nresource is used as effectively as possible. For a further discussion \n\nof our main areas of responsibility, see the DHS Web site at http://www.dhs.gov/our-mission.\n\n The regulations we have summarized below in the Department's fall \n\n2014 regulatory plan and in the agenda support the Department's \n\nresponsibility areas listed above. These regulations will improve the \n\nDepartment's ability to accomplish its mission.\n\n The regulations we have identified in this year's fall regulatory \n\nplan continue to address legislative initiatives including, but not \n\nlimited to, the following acts: The Implementing Recommendations of the \n\n9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (9/11 Act), Public Law 110-53 (Aug. 3, \n\n2007); the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 (CNRA), Public \n\nLaw 110-229 (May 8, 2008); the Security and Accountability for Every \n\nPort Act of 2006 (SAFE Port Act), Public Law 109-347 (Oct. 13, 2006); \n\nand the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing \n\nAppropriations Act, 2009, Public Law 110-329 (Sep. 30, 2008).\n\n DHS strives for organizational excellence and uses a centralized \n\nand unified approach in managing its regulatory resources. The Office \n\nof the General Counsel manages the Department's regulatory program, \n\nincluding the agenda and regulatory plan. In addition, DHS senior \n\nleadership reviews each significant regulatory project to ensure that \n\nthe project fosters and supports the Department's mission.\n\n The Department is committed to ensuring that all of its regulatory \n\ninitiatives are aligned with its guiding principles to protect civil \n\nrights and civil liberties, integrate our actions, build coalitions and \n\npartnerships, develop human resources, innovate, and be accountable to \n\nthe American public.\n\n DHS is also committed to the principles described in Executive \n\nOrders 13563 and 12866 (as amended). Both Executive Orders direct \n\nagencies to assess the costs and benefits of available regulatory \n\nalternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory \n\napproaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, \n\nenvironmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, \n\nand equity). Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of \n\nquantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing \n\nrules, and of promoting flexibility.\n\n Finally, the Department values public involvement in the \n\ndevelopment of its regulatory plan, agenda, and regulations, and takes \n\nparticular concern with the impact its rules have on small businesses. \n\nDHS and each of its components continue to emphasize the use of plain \n\nlanguage in our notices and rulemaking documents to promote a better \n\nunderstanding of regulations and increased public participation in the \n\nDepartment's rulemakings.\n\nhttp://www.dhs.gov/our-mission\n\n\nRetrospective Review of Existing Regulations\n\n Pursuant to Executive Order 13563 ``Improving Regulation and \n\nRegulatory Review'' (Jan. 18, 2011), DHS identified the following \n\nregulatory actions as associated with retrospective review and \n\nanalysis. Some of the regulatory actions on the below list may be \n\ncompleted actions, which do not appear in The Regulatory Plan.

For example, the U.S. Coast Guard is the primary U.S. \n\nrepresentative to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and \n\nplays a major leadership role in establishing international standards \n\nin the global maritime community. IMO's work to establish international \n\nstandards for maritime safety, security, and environmental protection \n\nclosely aligns with the U.S. Coast Guard regulations. As an IMO member \n\nnation, the U.S. is obliged to incorporate IMO treaty provisions not \n\nalready part of U.S. domestic policy into regulations for those vessels \n\naffected by the international standards. Consequently, the U.S. Coast \n\nGuard initiates rulemakings to harmonize with IMO international \n\nstandards such as treaty provisions and the codes, conventions, \n\nresolutions, and circulars that supplement them.\n\n Also, President Obama and Prime Minister Harper created the Canada-\n\nU.S. Regulatory Cooperation Council (RCC) in February 2011. The RCC is \n\nan initiative between both federal governments aimed at pursuing \n\ngreater alignment in regulation, increasing mutual recognition of \n\nregulatory practices and establishing smarter, more effective and less \n\nburdensome regulations in specific sectors. The Canada-U.S. RCC \n\ninitiative arose out of the recognition that high level, focused, and \n\nsustained effort would be required to reach a more substantive level of \n\nregulatory cooperation. Since its creation in early 2011, the U.S. \n\nCoast Guard has participated in stakeholder consultations with their \n\nTransport Canada counterparts and the public, drafted items for \n\ninclusion in the RCC Action Plan, and detailed work plans for each \n\n\n\nincluded Action Plan item.\n\n The fall 2014 regulatory plan for DHS includes regulations from DHS \n\ncomponents--including U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \n\n(USCIS), the U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard), U.S. Customs and Border \n\nProtection (CBP), the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), \n\nand the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which have active \n\nregulatory programs. In addition, it includes regulations from the \n\nDepartment's major offices and directorates such as the National \n\nProtection and Programs Directorate (NPPD). Below is a discussion of \n\nthe fall 2014 regulatory plan for DHS regulatory components, offices, \n\nand directorates.\n\nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Services\n\n U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) administers \n\nimmigration benefits and services while protecting and securing our \n\nhomeland. USCIS has a strong commitment to welcoming individuals who \n\nseek entry through the U.S. immigration system, providing clear and \n\nuseful information regarding the immigration process, promoting the \n\nvalues of citizenship, and assisting those in need of humanitarian \n\nprotection. Based on a comprehensive review of the planned USCIS \n\nregulatory agenda, USCIS will promulgate several rulemakings to \n\ndirectly support these commitments and goals.\n\nRegulations to Facilitate Retention of High-Skilled Workers\n\n Employment Authorization for Certain H-4 Dependent Spouses. On May \n\n12, 2014, USCIS published a proposed rule intended to encourage \n\nprofessionals with high-demand skills to remain in the country and help \n\nspur innovation and growth of U.S. businesses. In the proposed rule, \n\nUSCIS proposed to extend eligibility for employment authorization to H-\n\n4 dependent spouses of principal H-1B nonimmigrants who have begun the \n\nprocess of seeking lawful permanent resident status through employment \n\nand have extended their authorized period of admission or ``stay'' in \n\nthe United States under section 104(c) or 106(a) of Public Law 106-313, \n\nalso known as the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century \n\nAct of 2000. USCIS plans to issue a final rule in the coming year.\n\n Enhancing Opportunities for High-Skilled Workers. Also on May 12, \n\n2014, USCIS published a proposed rule intended to encourage and \n\nfacilitate the employment and retention of certain high-skilled and \n\ntransitional workers. In the proposed rule, USCIS proposed to amend its \n\nregulations relating to the nonimmigrant classifications for specialty \n\n\n\noccupation professionals from Chile and Singapore (H-1B1) and from \n\nAustralia (E-3), to include these classifications in the list of \n\nclasses of aliens authorized for employment incident to status with a \n\nspecific employer, to extend automatic employment authorization \n\nextensions with pending extension of stay requests, and to update \n\nfiling procedures. USCIS also proposed to amend regulations regarding \n\ncontinued employment authorization for nonimmigrant workers in the \n\nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)-only Transitional \n\nWorker (CW-1) classification. Finally, USCIS also proposed to amend \n\nregulations related to the immigration classification for employment-\n\nbased first preference (EB-1) outstanding professors or researchers to \n\nallow the submission of comparable evidence. USCIS plans to issue a \n\nfinal rule in the coming year.\n\nImprovements to the Immigration System\n\n Requirements for Filing Motions and Administrative Appeals. USCIS \n\nwill propose to revise the procedural regulations governing appeals and \n\nmotions to reopen or reconsider before its Administrative Appeals \n\nOffice, and to require that applicants and petitioners exhaust \n\nadministrative remedies before seeking judicial review of an \n\nunfavorable decision. The changes proposed by the rule will streamline \n\nthe procedures before the Administrative Appeals Office and improve the \n\nefficiency of the adjudication process.\n\n Regulations Related to the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana \n\nIslands. This final rule amends DHS and Department of Justice (DOJ) \n\nregulations to comply with the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of \n\n2008 (CNRA). The CNRA extends the immigration laws of the United States \n\nto the Consolidated Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). In 2009, USCIS \n\nissued an interim final rule to implement conforming amendments to the \n\nDHS and DOJ regulations. This joint DHS-DOJ final rule titled \n\n``Application of Immigration Regulations to the CNMI'' would finalize \n\nthe 2009 interim final rule.\n\nRegulatory Changes Involving Humanitarian Benefits\n\n Asylum and Withholding Definitions. USCIS plans a regulatory \n\nproposal to amend the regulations that govern asylum eligibility and \n\nrefugee status determinations. The amendments are expected to revise \n\nthe portions of the existing regulations that deal with determinations \n\nof whether suffered or feared persecution is on account of a protected \n\nground, the requirements for establishing that the government is unable \n\nor unwilling to protect the applicant, and the definition of membership \n\n\n\nin a particular social group. This proposal would provide greater \n\nclarity and consistency in this important area of the law.\n\n Exception to the Persecution Bar for Asylum, Refugee, or Temporary \n\nProtected Status, and Withholding of Removal. In a joint rulemaking, \n\nDHS and DOJ will propose amendments to existing DHS and DOJ regulations \n\nto resolve ambiguity in the statutory\n\n[[Page 76532]]\n\nlanguage precluding eligibility for asylum, refugee resettlement, \n\ntemporary protected status, and withholding or removal of an applicant \n\nwho ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the \n\npersecution of others. The proposed rule would provide a limited \n\nexception for persecutory actions taken by the applicant under duress \n\nand would clarify the required level of the applicant's knowledge of \n\nthe persecution.\n\n ``T'' and ``U'' Nonimmigrants. USCIS plans additional regulatory \n\ninitiatives related to T nonimmigrants (victims of trafficking) and U \n\nnonimmigrants (victims of criminal activity). Through these regulatory \n\ninitiatives, USCIS hopes to provide greater consistency in eligibility \n\nand application requirements for these vulnerable groups, their \n\nadvocates, and the community. These rulemakings will contain provisions \n\nto adjust documentary requirements for this vulnerable population and \n\nprovide greater clarity to the law enforcement community.\n\n Special Immigrant Juvenile Petitions. This final rule makes \n\nprocedural changes and resolves interpretive issues following statutory \n\namendments. The Secretary may grant Special Immigrant Juvenile \n\nclassification to aliens whose reunification with one or both parents \n\nis not viable due to abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis \n\nfound under State law. Such classification can regularize immigration \n\nstatus for these aliens and allow for adjustment of status to lawful \n\npermanent resident.\n\nUnited States Coast Guard\n\n The U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard) is a military, multi-mission, \n\nmaritime service of the United States and the only military \n\norganization within DHS. It is the principal federal agency responsible \n\nfor maritime safety, security, and stewardship and delivers daily value \n\nto the Nation through multi-mission resources, authorities, and \n\ncapabilities.\n\n Effective governance in the maritime domain hinges upon an \n\nintegrated approach to safety, security, and stewardship. The Coast \n\n\n\nGuard's policies and capabilities are integrated and interdependent, \n\ndelivering results through a network of enduring partnerships. The \n\nCoast Guard's ability to field versatile capabilities and highly-\n\ntrained personnel is one of the U.S. Government's most significant and \n\nimportant strengths in the maritime environment.\n\n America is a maritime nation, and our security, resilience, and \n\neconomic prosperity are intrinsically linked to the oceans. Safety, \n\nefficient waterways, and freedom of transit on the high seas are \n\nessential to our well-being. The Coast Guard is leaning forward, poised \n\nto meet the demands of the modern maritime environment. The Coast Guard \n\ncreates value for the public through solid prevention and response \n\nefforts. Activities involving oversight and regulation, enforcement, \n\nmaritime presence, and public and private partnership foster increased \n\nmaritime safety, security, and stewardship.\n\n The statutory responsibilities of the Coast Guard include ensuring \n\nmarine safety and security, preserving maritime mobility, protecting \n\nthe marine environment, enforcing U.S. laws and international treaties, \n\nand performing search and rescue. The Coast Guard supports the \n\nDepartment's overarching goals of mobilizing and organizing our Nation \n\nto secure the homeland from terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and \n\nother emergencies. The rulemaking projects identified for the Coast \n\nGuard in the Unified Agenda, and the rules appearing in the fall 2014 \n\nRegulatory Plan below, contribute to the fulfillment of those \n\nresponsibilities and reflect our regulatory policies.\n\n Vessel Requirements for Notices of Arrival and Departure, and \n\nAutomatic Identification System. The Coast Guard intends to expand the \n\napplicability of notice of arrival and departure (NOAD) and automatic \n\nidentification system (AIS) requirements to include more commercial \n\nvessels. This rule, once final, would expand the applicability of \n\nnotice of arrival (NOA) requirements to include additional vessels, \n\nestablish a separate requirement for certain vessels to submit notices \n\nof departure (NOD), set forth a mandatory method for electronic \n\nsubmission of NOA and NOD, and modify related reporting content, \n\ntimeframes, and procedures. This rule would also extend the \n\napplicability of AIS requirements beyond Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) \n\nareas and require additional commercial vessels install and use AIS. \n\nThese changes are intended to improve navigation safety, enhance our \n\nability to identify and track vessels, and heighten the Coast Guard's \n\noverall maritime domain awareness, thus helping the Coast Guard address \n\nthreats to maritime transportation safety and security and mitigate the \n\npossible harm from such threats.\n\n Inspection of Towing Vessels. The Coast Guard has proposed \n\n\n\nregulations governing the inspection of towing vessels, including an \n\noptional towing safety management system (TSMS). The regulations for \n\nthis large class of vessels would establish operations, lifesaving, \n\nfire protection, machinery and electrical systems and equipment, and \n\nconstruction and arrangement standards for towing vessels. This \n\nrulemaking would also set standards for the optional TSMS and related \n\nthird-party organizations, as well as procedures for obtaining a \n\ncertificate of inspection under either the TSMS or Coast Guard annual-\n\ninspection option. This rulemaking would implement section 415 of the \n\nCoast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2004. The intent of this \n\nrulemaking, which would establish a new subchapter dedicated to towing \n\nvessels, is to promote safer work practices and reduce towing vessel \n\ncasualties.\n\n Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC)--Reader \n\nRequirements. In accordance with the Maritime Transportation Safety Act \n\nof 2002 (MTSA) and the Security and Accountability For Every Port Act \n\nof 2006 (SAFE Port Act), the Coast Guard is establishing rules \n\nrequiring electronic TWIC readers at high-risk vessels and facilities. \n\nThese rules would ensure that prior to being granted unescorted access \n\nto a designated secure area at a high-risk vessel or facility: (1) The \n\nindividual will have his or her TWIC electronically authenticated; (2) \n\nthe status of the individual's credential will be electronically \n\nvalidated against an up-to-date list maintained by the TSA; and (3) the \n\nindividual's identity will be electronically confirmed by comparing his \n\nor her fingerprint with a biometric template stored on the credential. \n\nBy promulgating these rules, the Coast Guard seeks to improve security \n\nat the highest risk vessels and facilities with broader use of \n\nelectronic inspection of biometric credentials.\n\nUnited States Customs and Border Protection\n\n U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the federal agency \n\nprincipally responsible for the security of our Nation's borders, both \n\nat and between the ports of entry and at official crossings into the \n\nUnited States. CBP must accomplish its border security and enforcement \n\nmission without stifling the flow of legitimate trade and travel. The \n\nprimary mission of CBP is its homeland security mission, that is, to \n\nprevent terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the United \n\nStates. An important aspect of this priority mission involves improving \n\nsecurity at our borders and ports of entry, but it also means extending \n\nour zone of security beyond our physical borders.\n\n CBP is also responsible for administering laws concerning the \n\nimportation into the United States of goods, and enforcing the laws \n\n\n\nconcerning the entry of persons into the\n\n[[Page 76533]]\n\nUnited States. This includes regulating and facilitating international \n\ntrade; collecting import duties; enforcing U.S. trade, immigration and \n\nother laws of the United States at our borders; inspecting imports, \n\noverseeing the activities of persons and businesses engaged in \n\nimporting; enforcing the laws concerning smuggling and trafficking in \n\ncontraband; apprehending individuals attempting to enter the United \n\nStates illegally; protecting our agriculture and economic interests \n\nfrom harmful pests and diseases; servicing all people, vehicles and \n\ncargo entering the United States; maintaining export controls; and \n\nprotecting U.S. businesses from theft of their intellectual property.\n\n In carrying out its priority mission, CBP's goal is to facilitate \n\nthe processing of legitimate trade and people efficiently without \n\ncompromising security. Consistent with its primary mission of homeland \n\nsecurity, CBP intends to issue several rules during the next fiscal \n\nyear that are intended to improve security at our borders and ports of \n\nentry. CBP is also automating some procedures that increase \n\nefficiencies and reduce the costs and burdens to travelers. We have \n\nhighlighted some of these rules below.\n\n Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). During the next \n\nfiscal year, CBP intends to issue a final rule that will finalize two \n\nElectronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) rulemakings, the 2008 \n\nESTA interim final rule and the 2010 ESTA fee interim final rule. On \n\nJune 9, 2008, CBP published an interim final rule implementing the ESTA \n\nfor aliens who wish to enter the United States under the Visa Waiver \n\nProgram (VWP) at air or sea ports of entry. This rule was intended to \n\nfulfill the requirements of section 711 of the Implementing \n\nRecommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (9/11 Act). The rule \n\nestablished ESTA and required that each alien traveling to the United \n\nStates under the VWP must obtain electronic travel authorization via \n\nthe ESTA System in advance of such travel. VWP travelers may obtain the \n\nrequired ESTA authorization by electronically submitting to CBP \n\nbiographic and other information that was previously submitted to CBP \n\nvia the I-94W Nonimmigrant Alien Arrival/Departure Form (I-94W). ESTA \n\nbecame mandatory on January 12, 2009. Therefore, VWP travelers must \n\neither obtain travel authorization in advance of travel under ESTA or \n\nobtain a visa prior to traveling to the United States. On August 9, \n\n\n\n2010, CBP published an interim final rule amending the ESTA regulations \n\nto require ESTA applicants to pay a congressionally mandated fee which \n\nis the sum of two amounts, a $10.00 travel promotion fee for an \n\napproved ESTA and a $4.00 operational fee for the use of ESTA set by \n\nthe Secretary of Homeland Security to at least ensure the recovery of \n\nthe full costs of providing and administering the ESTA system.\n\n Importer Security Filing and Additional Carrier Requirements. On \n\nNovember 25, 2008, CBP published an interim final rule amending CBP \n\nregulations to require carriers and importers to provide to CBP, via a \n\nCBP approved electronic data interchange system, information necessary \n\nto enable CBP to identity high-risk shipments to prevent smuggling and \n\nensure cargo safety and security. This rule, which became effective on \n\nJanuary 26, 2009, improves CBP risk assessment and targeting \n\ncapabilities, facilitates the prompt release of legitimate cargo \n\nfollowing its arrival in the United States, and assists CBP in \n\nincreasing the security of the global trading system. To increase the \n\naccuracy and reliability of the advance information, CBP intends to \n\npublish a notice of proposed rulemaking during the next fiscal year \n\nthat proposes some changes to the current importer security filing \n\nregulations.\n\n Air Cargo Advance Screening (ACAS). The Trade Act of 2002, as \n\namended, authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to promulgate \n\nregulations providing for the transmission to CBP through an electronic \n\ndata interchange system, of information pertaining to cargo to be \n\nbrought into the United States or to be sent from the United States, \n\nprior to the arrival or departure of the cargo. The cargo information \n\nrequired is that which the Secretary determines to be reasonably \n\nnecessary to ensure cargo safety and security. CBP's current Trade Act \n\nregulations pertaining to air cargo require the electronic submission \n\nof various advance data to CBP no later than either the time of \n\ndeparture of the aircraft for the United States (from specified \n\nlocations) or four hours prior to arrival in the United States for all \n\nother locations. CBP intends to propose amendments to these regulations \n\nto implement the Air Cargo Advance Screening (ACAS) program. To improve \n\nCBP's risk assessment and targeting capabilities and to enable CBP to \n\ntarget, and identify risky cargo prior to departure of the aircraft to \n\nthe United States, ACAS would require the submission of certain of the \n\nadvance electronic information for air cargo as early as practicable \n\nbut no later than prior to loading the cargo onto an aircraft destined \n\nto or transiting through the United States at the last foreign port of \n\ndeparture. CBP, in conjunction with TSA, has been operating ACAS as a \n\n\n\nvoluntary pilot program since 2010 and would like to implement ACAS as \n\na regulatory program.\n\n Implementation of the Guam-Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n\nIslands (CNMI) Visa Waiver Program. CBP published an interim final rule \n\nin November 2008 amending the DHS regulations to replace the current \n\nGuam Visa Waiver Program with a new Guam-Commonwealth of the Northern \n\nMariana Islands (CNMI) Visa Waiver Program. This rule implements \n\nportions of the Consolidated National Resources Act of 2008 (CNRA), \n\nwhich extends the immigration laws of the United States to the CNMI and \n\namong others things, provides for a visa waiver program for travel to \n\nGuam and the CNMI. The amended regulations set forth the requirements \n\nfor nonimmigrant visitors who seek admission for business or pleasure \n\nand solely for entry into and stay on Guam or the CNMI without a visa. \n\nThe rule also establishes six ports of entry in the CNMI for purposes \n\nof administering and enforcing the Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program. CBP \n\nintends to issue a final rule during the next fiscal year.\n\n Definition of Form I-94 to Include Electronic Format. DHS issues \n\nthe Form I-94 to certain aliens and uses the Form I-94 for various \n\npurposes such as documenting status in the United States, the approved \n\nlength of stay, and departure. DHS generally issues the Form I-94 to \n\naliens at the time they lawfully enter the United States. On March 27, \n\n2013, CBP published an interim final rule amending existing regulations \n\nto add a new definition of the term ``Form I-94.'' The new definition \n\nincludes the collection of arrival/departure and admission or parole \n\ninformation by DHS, whether in paper or electronic format. The \n\ndefinition also clarified various terms that are associated with the \n\nuse of the Form I-94 to accommodate an electronic version of the Form \n\nI-94. The rule also added a valid, unexpired nonimmigrant DHS admission \n\nor parole stamp in a foreign passport to the list of documents \n\ndesignated as evidence of alien registration. These revisions enabled \n\nDHS to transition to an automated process whereby DHS creates a Form I-\n\n94 in an electronic format based on passenger, passport and visa \n\ninformation that DHS obtains electronically from air and sea carriers \n\nand the Department of State as well as through the inspection process. \n\nCBP intends to publish a final rule during the next fiscal year.\n\n In addition to the regulations that CBP issues to promote DHS's \n\nmission, CBP\n\n[[Page 76534]]\n\n\n\nalso issues regulations related to the mission of the Department of the \n\nTreasury. Under section 403(1) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, \n\nthe former-U.S. Customs Service, including functions of the Secretary \n\nof the Treasury relating thereto, transferred to the Secretary of \n\nHomeland Security. As part of the initial organization of DHS, the \n\nCustoms Service inspection and trade functions were combined with the \n\nimmigration and agricultural inspection functions and the Border Patrol \n\nand transferred into CBP. It is noted that certain regulatory authority \n\nof the U.S. Customs Service relating to customs revenue function was \n\nretained by the Department of the Treasury (see the Department of the \n\nTreasury Regulatory Plan). In addition to its plans to continue issuing \n\nregulations to enhance border security, CBP, during fiscal year 2015, \n\nexpects to continue to issue regulatory documents that will facilitate \n\nlegitimate trade and implement trade benefit program. CBP regulations \n\nregarding the customs revenue function are discussed in the Regulatory \n\nPlan of the Department of the Treasury.\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency\n\n The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) does not have any \n\nsignificant regulatory actions planned for fiscal year 2015.\n\nFederal Law Enforcement Training Center\n\n The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) does not have \n\nany significant regulatory actions planned for fiscal year 2015.\n\nUnited States Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n\n ICE is the principal criminal investigative arm of the Department \n\nof Homeland Security and one of the three Department components charged \n\nwith the civil enforcement of the Nation's immigration laws. Its \n\nprimary mission is to protect national security, public safety, and the \n\nintegrity of our borders through the criminal and civil enforcement of \n\nFederal law governing border control, customs, trade, and immigration. \n\nDuring fiscal year 2015, ICE will focus rulemaking efforts on \n\nimplementing and planning improvements in the area of student and \n\nexchange visitor programs and to advance initiatives related to F-1 and \n\nM-1 nonimmigrant students.\n\n Adjustments to Limitations on Designated School Official Assignment \n\nand Study by F-2 and M-2 Nonimmigrants. On November 21, 2013, DHS \n\npublished a notice of proposed rulemaking to revise the regulatory cap \n\non the number of designated school officials (DSOs) that may be \n\nnominated for the oversight of each school's campus(es) where F-1 and/\n\nor M-1 students are enrolled. Currently, schools are limited to ten \n\n\n\nDSOs per school or per campus in a multi-campus school. In addition, \n\nthe proposed rule sought to modify the regulatory restrictions placed \n\non the dependents of an F-1 or M-1 student, to permit F-2 and M-2 \n\nnonimmigrants to enroll in less than a full course of study at a school \n\ncertified by the ICE Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). ICE \n\nintends to issue a final rule in FY 2015. ICE believes that, in many \n\ncircumstances, elimination of a DSO limit may improve the capability of \n\nDSOs to meet their liaison, reporting, and oversight responsibilities. \n\nIn addition, ICE recognizes that there is increasing global competition \n\nto attract the best and brightest international students to study in \n\nour schools. Allowing a more flexible approach to permit F-2 and M-2 \n\nspouses and children to engage in less than a full course of study at \n\nSEVP-certified schools will provide a greater incentive for \n\ninternational students to travel to the United States for their \n\neducation.\n\nNational Protection and Programs Directorate\n\n The National Protection and Programs Directorate's (NPPD) vision is \n\na safe, secure, and resilient infrastructure where the American way of \n\nlife can thrive. NPPD leads the national effort to protect and enhance \n\nthe resilience of the nation's physical and cyber infrastructure.\n\n Ammonium Nitrate Security Program. Recognizing both the economic \n\nimportance of ammonium nitrate and the fact that ammonium nitrate is \n\nsusceptible to use by terrorists in explosive devices, Congress, in \n\nsection 563 of the Fiscal Year 2008 DHS Appropriations Act, granted DHS \n\nthe authority to ``regulate the sale and transfer of ammonium nitrate \n\nby an ammonium nitrate facility . . . to prevent the misappropriation \n\nor use of ammonium nitrate in an act of terrorism.'' The statute \n\ndirects DHS to promulgate regulations requiring potential buyers and \n\nsellers of ammonium nitrate to register with DHS, in order to obtain \n\nammonium nitrate registration numbers from DHS. The statute also \n\nrequires DHS to screen each applicant against the Terrorist Screening \n\nDatabase. The statute also requires sellers of ammonium nitrate to \n\nverify the identities of those individuals seeking to purchase ammonium \n\nnitrate; to record certain information about each sale or transfer of \n\nammonium nitrate; and to report thefts and losses of ammonium nitrate \n\nto federal authorities.\n\n On October 29, 2008, DHS published an Advance Notice of Proposed \n\nRulemaking (ANPRM) for a Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate Program. \n\nDHS reviewed the public comments and, on August 3, 2011, published a \n\nnotice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). DHS received comment on the NPRM \n\nuntil December 1, 2011, and is now reviewing and adjudicating the \n\n\n\npublic comments in order to develop a final rule. The final rule is \n\nintended to aid the Federal Government in its efforts to protect \n\nagainst the misappropriation of ammonium nitrate for use in acts of \n\nterrorism and to limit terrorists' abilities to threaten the Nation's \n\ncritical infrastructure and key resources. By protecting the Nation's \n\nsupply of ammonium nitrate through the implementation of this rule, it \n\nwill be more difficult for terrorists to obtain ammonium nitrate \n\nmaterials for use in terrorist acts.\n\nTransportation Security Administration\n\n The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) protects the \n\nNation's transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for \n\npeople and commerce. TSA is committed to continuously setting the \n\nstandard for excellence in transportation security through its people, \n\nprocesses, and technology as we work to meet the immediate and long-\n\nterm needs of the transportation sector.\n\n In fiscal year 2014, responding to new legislative mandates in the \n\nBipartisan Budget Act of 2013, Pub. L. 113-67 (Dec. 26, 2013) TSA \n\npublished two statutorily-required regulations: One that restructured \n\nthe fee imposed on passengers (known as the September 11th Security \n\nFee) and another that repealed TSA's authority to impose a fee on air \n\ncarriers (known as the Aviation Security Infrastructure Fee).\n\n In fiscal year 2015, TSA will promote the DHS mission by \n\nemphasizing regulatory efforts that allow TSA to better identify, \n\ndetect, and protect against threats against various modes of the \n\ntransportation system, while facilitating the efficient movement of the \n\ntraveling public, transportation workers, and cargo.\n\n Passenger Screening Using Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT). TSA \n\nintends to issue a final rule to amend its civil aviation regulations \n\nto address whether screening and inspection of an individual, conducted \n\nto control access to the sterile area of an airport or to an aircraft, \n\nmay include the use of advanced imaging technology (AIT).\n\n[[Page 76535]]\n\nTSA published an NPRM on March 26, 2012, to comply with the decision \n\nrendered by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District Columbia Circuit \n\nin Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) v. U.S. Department of \n\nHomeland Security on July 15, 2011. 653 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2011). The \n\nCourt directed TSA to conduct notice and comment rulemaking on the use \n\nof AIT in the primary screening of passengers.\n\n Security Training for Surface Mode Employees. TSA will propose \n\nregulations to enhance the security of several non-aviation modes of \n\n\n\ntransportation. In particular, TSA will propose regulations requiring \n\nfreight railroad carriers, public transportation agencies (including \n\nrail mass transit and bus systems), passenger railroad carriers, and \n\nover-the-road bus operators to conduct security training for front line \n\nemployees. This regulation would implement sections 1408 (Public \n\nTransportation), 1517 (Freight Railroads), and 1534(a) (Over-the-Road-\n\nBuses) of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act \n\nof 2007 (9/11 Act). In compliance with the definitions of frontline \n\nemployees in the pertinent provisions of the 9/11 Act, the notice of \n\nproposed rulemaking (NPRM) would propose to define which employees are \n\nrequired to undergo training. This NPRM would also propose definitions \n\nfor transportation of security-sensitive materials as required by \n\nsection 1501 of the 9/11 Act.\n\n Standardized Vetting, Adjudication, and Redress Process and Fees. \n\nTSA is developing a proposed rule to revise and standardize the \n\nprocedures, adjudication criteria, and fees for most of the security \n\nthreat assessments (STAs) of individuals that TSA conducts. TSA is \n\nconsidering a proposal that would include procedures for conducting \n\nSTAs for transportation workers from almost all modes of \n\ntransportation, including those covered under the 9/11 Act. In \n\naddition, TSA will propose equitable fees to cover the cost of the STAs \n\nand credentials for some personnel. TSA plans to identify new \n\nefficiencies in processing STAs and ways to streamline existing \n\nregulations by simplifying language and removing redundancies. As part \n\nof this proposed rule, TSA will propose revisions to the Alien Flight \n\nStudent Program (AFSP) regulations. TSA published an interim final rule \n\nfor the AFSP on September 20, 2004. TSA regulations require aliens \n\nseeking to train at Federal Aviation Administration-regulated flight \n\nschools to complete an application and undergo an STA prior to \n\nbeginning flight training. There are four categories under which \n\nstudents currently fall; the nature of the STA depends on the student's \n\ncategory. TSA is considering changes to the AFSP that would improve \n\nequity among fee payers and enable the implementation of new \n\ntechnologies to support vetting.\n\nUnited States Secret Service\n\n The United States Secret Service does not have any significant \n\nregulatory actions planned for fiscal year 2015.\n\nDHS Regulatory Plan for Fiscal Year 2015\n\n A more detailed description of the priority regulations that \n\n\n\ncomprise DHS's fall 2014 regulatory plan follows.\n\nDHS--OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY (OS)\n\nFinal Rule Stage\n\n68. Ammonium Nitrate Security Program\n\n Priority: Economically Significant. Major under 5 U.S.C. 801.\n\n Unfunded Mandates: This action may affect the private sector under \n\nPub. L. 104-4.\n\n Legal Authority: Pub. L. 110-161, 2008 Consolidated Appropriations \n\nAct, sec. 563, subtitle J--Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate\n\n CFR Citation: 6 CFR 31\n\n Legal Deadline: NPRM, Statutory, May 26, 2008, Publication of \n\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking. Final, Statutory, December 26, 2008, \n\nPublication of Final Rule.\n\n Abstract: This rulemaking will implement the December 2007 \n\namendment to the Homeland Security Act entitled ``Secure Handling of \n\nAmmonium Nitrate.'' The amendment requires the Department of Homeland \n\nSecurity to ``regulate the sale and transfer of ammonium nitrate by an \n\nammonium nitrate facility . . . to prevent the misappropriation or use \n\nof ammonium nitrate in an act of terrorism.''\n\n Statement of Need: Pursuant to section 563 of the 2008 Consolidated \n\nAppropriations Act, subtitle J--Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate, \n\nPublic Law 110-161, the Department of Homeland Security is required to \n\npromulgate a rulemaking to create a registration regime for certain \n\nbuyers and sellers of ammonium nitrate. This rule would create that \n\nregime, and would aid the Federal Government in its efforts to protect \n\nagainst the misappropriation of ammonium nitrate for use in acts of \n\nterrorism. By protecting against such misappropriation, this rule could \n\nlimit terrorists' abilities to threaten the public and to threaten the \n\nNation's critical infrastructure and key resources. By securing the \n\nNation's supply of ammonium nitrate, it should be much more difficult \n\nfor terrorists to obtain ammonium nitrate materials for use in \n\nimprovised explosive devices. As a result, there is a direct value in \n\nthe deterrence of a catastrophic terrorist attack using ammonium \n\nnitrate, such as the Oklahoma City attack that killed over 160 and \n\ninjured 853 people.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Section 563 of the 2008 Consolidated \n\nAppropriations Act, subtitle J--Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate, \n\nPublic Law 110-161, authorizes and requires this rulemaking.\n\n Alternatives: The Department considered several alternatives when \n\n\n\ndeveloping the Ammonium Nitrate Security Program proposed rule. The \n\nalternatives considered were: (a) Register individuals applying for an \n\nAN registered user number using a paper application (via facsimile or \n\nthe U.S. mail) rather than through in person application at a local \n\ncooperative extension office or only through a Web-based portal; (b) \n\nverify AN purchasers through both an Internet-based verification portal \n\nand call center rather than only a verification portal or call center; \n\n(c) communicate with applicants for an AN registered user number \n\nthrough U.S. Mail rather than only through email or a secure Web-based \n\nportal; (d) establish a specific capability within the Department to \n\nreceive, process, and respond to reports of theft or loss rather than \n\nleverage a similar capability which already exists with the Bureau of \n\nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF); (e) require AN \n\nfacilities to maintain records electronically in a central database \n\nprovided by the Department rather than providing flexibility to the AN \n\nfacility to maintain their own records either in paper or \n\nelectronically; (f) require agents to register with the Department \n\nprior to the sale or transfer of ammonium nitrate involving an agent \n\nrather than allow oral confirmation of the agent with the AN purchaser \n\non whose behalf the agent is working; and (g) exempt explosives from \n\nthis regulation rather than not exempting them. As part of its notice \n\nof proposed rulemaking, the Department sought public comment on the \n\nnumerous alternative ways in which the Department could carry out the \n\nrequirements of the Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate provisions of \n\nthe Homeland Security Act.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: In its proposed rule, the Department\n\n[[Page 76536]]\n\nestimated the number of entities that purchase ammonium nitrate to \n\nrange from 64,950 to 106,200. These purchasers include farms, \n\nfertilizer mixers, farm supply wholesalers and cooperatives (co-ops), \n\ngolf courses, landscaping services, explosives distributors, mines, \n\nretail garden centers, and lab supply wholesalers. The Department \n\nestimated the number of entities that sell ammonium nitrate to be \n\nbetween 2,486 and 6,236, many of which are also purchasers. These \n\nsellers include ammonium nitrate fertilizer and explosive \n\nmanufacturers, fertilizer mixers, farm supply wholesalers and co-ops, \n\nretail garden centers, explosives distributors, fertilizer applicator \n\nservices, and lab supply wholesalers. Individuals or firms that provide \n\ntransportation services within the distribution chain may be \n\n\n\ncategorized as sellers, agents, or facilities depending upon their \n\nbusiness relationship with the other parties to the transaction. The \n\ntotal number of potentially regulated farms and other businesses ranges \n\nfrom 64,986 to 106,236 (including overlap between the categories). The \n\ncost of the proposed rule ranges from $300 million to $1,041 million \n\nover 10 years at a 7 percent discount rate. The primary estimate is the \n\nmean which is $670.6 million. For comparison, at a 3 percent discount \n\nrate, the cost of the program ranges from $364 million to $1.3 billion \n\nwith a primary (mean) estimate of $814 million. The average annualized \n\ncost for the program ranges from $43 million to $148 million (with a \n\nmean of $96 million), also employing a 7 percent discount rate. Because \n\nthe value of the benefits of reducing risk of a terrorist attack is a \n\nfunction of both the probability of an attack and the value of the \n\nconsequence, it is difficult to identify the particular risk reduction \n\nassociated with the implementation of this rule. These elements and \n\nrelated qualitative benefits include point of sale identification \n\nrequirements and requiring individuals to be screened against the \n\nTerrorist Screening Database (TSDB), resulting in known bad actors \n\nbeing denied the ability to purchase ammonium nitrate. The Department \n\nof Homeland Security aims to prevent terrorist attacks within the \n\nUnited States and to reduce the vulnerability of the United States to \n\nterrorism. By preventing the misappropriation or use of ammonium \n\nnitrate in acts of terrorism, this rulemaking will support the \n\nDepartment's efforts to prevent terrorist attacks and reduce the \n\nNation's vulnerability to terrorist attacks. This rulemaking is \n\ncomplementary to other Department programs seeking to reduce the risks \n\nposed by terrorism, including the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism \n\nStandards program (which seeks in part to prevent terrorists from \n\ngaining access to dangerous chemicals) and the Transportation Worker \n\nIdentification Credential program (which seeks in part to prevent \n\nterrorists from gaining access to certain critical infrastructure), \n\namong other programs.\n\n Risks: Explosives containing ammonium nitrate are commonly used in \n\nterrorist attacks. Such attacks have been carried out both domestically \n\nand internationally. The 1995 Murrah Federal Building attack in \n\nOklahoma City claimed the lives of 167 individuals and demonstrated \n\nfirsthand to America how ammonium nitrate could be misused by \n\nterrorists. In addition to the Murrah Building attack, the Provisional \n\nIrish Republican Army used ammonium nitrate as part of its London, \n\nEngland, bombing campaign in the early 1980s. More recently, ammonium \n\nnitrate was used in the 1998 East African Embassy bombings and in the \n\nNovember 2003 bombings in Istanbul, Turkey. Additionally, since the \n\n\n\nevents of 9/11, stores of ammonium nitrate have been confiscated during \n\nraids on terrorist sites around the world, including sites in Canada, \n\nEngland, India, and the Philippines.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nANPRM............................... 10/29/08 73 FR 64280\n\nCorrection.......................... 11/05/08 73 FR 65783\n\nANPRM Comment Period End............ 12/29/08\n\nNPRM................................ 08/03/11 76 FR 46908\n\nNotice of Public Meetings........... 10/07/11 76 FR 62311\n\nNotice of Public Meetings........... 11/14/11 76 FR 70366\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 12/01/11\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 04/00/15\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, Local, State.\n\n Federalism: This action may have federalism implications as defined \n\nin EO 13132.\n\n URL for More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL for Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Jon MacLaren, Chief, Rulemaking Section, Department \n\nof Homeland Security, National Protection and Programs Directorate, \n\nInfrastructure Security Compliance Division (NPPD/ISCD), 245 Murray \n\nLane, Mail Stop 0610, Arlington, VA 20598-0610, Phone: 703 235-5263, \n\nFax: 703 603-4712, Email: jon.m.maclaren@hq.dhs.gov\n\n RIN: 1601-AA52\n\nDHS--U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES (USCIS)\n\nProposed Rule Stage\n\n69.

The amendments focus on portions of the regulations that \n\ndeal with the definitions of membership in a particular social group, \n\nthe requirements for failure of State protection, and determinations \n\nabout whether persecution is inflicted on account of a protected \n\nground. This rule codifies long-standing concepts of the definitions. \n\nIt clarifies that gender can be a basis for membership in a particular \n\nsocial group. It also clarifies that a person who has suffered or fears \n\ndomestic violence may under certain circumstances be eligible for \n\nasylum on that basis. After the Board of Immigration Appeals published \n\na decision on this issue in 1999, Matter of R-A-, Int. Dec. 3403 (BIA \n\n1999), it became clear that the governing regulatory standards required \n\nclarification. The Department of Justice began this regulatory \n\ninitiative by publishing a proposed rule addressing these issues in \n\n2000.\n\n Statement of Need: This rule provides guidance on a number of key \n\ninterpretive issues of the refugee definition used by adjudicators \n\ndeciding asylum and withholding of removal (withholding) claims. The \n\ninterpretive issues include whether persecution is inflicted on account \n\nof a protected ground, the requirements for establishing the failure of \n\nState protection, and the parameters for defining membership in a \n\nparticular social group. This rule will aid in the adjudication of \n\nclaims made by applicants whose claims fall outside of the rubric of \n\nthe protected grounds of race, religion, nationality, or political \n\nopinion. One example of such claims which often fall within the \n\nparticular social group ground concerns people who have suffered or \n\nfear domestic\n\n[[Page 76537]]\n\nviolence. This rule is expected to consolidate issues raised in a \n\nproposed rule in 2000 and to address issues that have developed since \n\nthe publication of the proposed rule. This rule should provide greater \n\nstability and clarity in this important area of the law. This rule will \n\nalso provide guidance to the following adjudicators: USCIS asylum \n\nofficers, Department of Justice Executive Office for Immigration Review \n\n(EOIR) immigration judges, and members of the EOIR Board of Immigration \n\nAppeals (BIA).\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The purpose of this rule is to provide \n\n\n\nguidance on certain issues that have arisen in the context of asylum \n\nand withholding adjudications. The 1951 Geneva Convention relating to \n\nthe Status of Refugees contains the internationally accepted definition \n\nof a refugee. United States immigration law incorporates an almost \n\nidentical definition of a refugee as a person outside his or her \n\ncountry of origin ``who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is \n\nunable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, \n\nthat country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of \n\npersecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a \n\nparticular social group, or political opinion.'' Section 101(a)(42) of \n\nthe Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\n Alternatives: A sizable body of interpretive case law has developed \n\naround the meaning of the refugee definition. Historically, much of \n\nthis case law has addressed more traditional asylum and withholding \n\nclaims based on the protected grounds of race, religion, nationality, \n\nor political opinion. In recent years, however, the United States \n\nincreasingly has encountered asylum and withholding applications with \n\nmore varied bases, related, for example, to an applicant's gender or \n\nsexual orientation. Many of these new types of claims are based on the \n\nground of ``membership in a particular social group,'' which is the \n\nleast well-defined of the five protected grounds within the refugee \n\ndefinition.\n\n On December 7, 2000, DOJ published a proposed rule in the Federal \n\nRegister providing guidance on the definitions of ``persecution'' and \n\n``membership in a particular social group.'' Before DHS publishes a new \n\nproposed rule, DHS will consider how the nexus between persecution and \n\na protected ground might be further conceptualized; how membership in a \n\nparticular social group might be defined and evaluated; and what \n\nconstitutes a State's inability or unwillingness to protect the \n\napplicant where the persecution arises from a non-State actor. The \n\nalternative to publishing this rule would be to allow the standards \n\ngoverning this area of law to continue to develop piecemeal through \n\nadministrative and judicial precedent. This approach has resulted in \n\ninconsistent and confusing standards, and the Department has therefore \n\ndetermined that promulgation of the new proposed rule is necessary.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: By providing a clear framework for \n\nkey asylum and withholding issues, we anticipate that adjudicators will \n\nhave clear guidance, increasing administrative efficiency and \n\nconsistency in adjudicating these cases. The rule will also promote a \n\n\n\nmore consistent and predictable body of administrative and judicial \n\nprecedent governing these types of cases. We anticipate that this will \n\nenable applicants to better assess their potential eligibility for \n\nasylum, and to present their claims more efficiently when they believe \n\nthat they may qualify, thus reducing the resources spent on \n\nadjudicating claims that do not qualify. In addition, a more consistent \n\nand predictable body of law on these issues will likely result in fewer \n\nappeals, both administrative and judicial, and reduce associated \n\nlitigation costs. The Department has no way of accurately predicting \n\nhow this rule will impact the number of asylum applications filed in \n\nthe United States. Based on anecdotal evidence and on the reported \n\nexperience of other nations that have adopted standards under which the \n\nresults are similar to those we anticipate for this rule, we do not \n\nbelieve this rule will cause a change in the number of asylum \n\napplications filed.\n\n Risks: The failure to promulgate a final rule in this area presents \n\nsignificant risk of further inconsistency and confusion in the law. The \n\nGovernment's interests in fair, efficient, and consistent adjudications \n\nwould be compromised.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 12/07/00 65 FR 76588\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 01/22/01\n\nNPRM................................ 05/00/15\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Additional Information: CIS No. 2092-00.\n\n Transferred from RIN 1115-AF92\n\n URL for More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL for Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Ted Kim, Deputy Chief, Asylum Division, Office of \n\nRefugee, Asylum, and International Operations, Department of Homeland \n\nSecurity, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, 20 Massachusetts \n\nAvenue NW., Suite 6030, Washington, DC 20259, Phone: 202 272-1614, Fax: \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\n\n\n202 272-1994, Email: ted.h.kim@uscis.dhs.gov\n\n RIN: 1615-AA41\n\nDHS--USCIS\n\n70. New Classification for Victims of Criminal Activity; Eligibility \n\nfor the U Nonimmigrant Status\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552; 5 U.S.C. 552a; 8 U.S.C. 1101; 8 \n\nU.S.C. 1101 (note); 8 U.S.C. 1102; Pub. L. 113-4\n\n CFR Citation: 8 CFR 103; 8 CFR 204; 8 CFR 212; 8 CFR 214; 8 CFR \n\n299.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: This rule proposes new application and eligibility \n\nrequirements for U nonimmigrant status. The U classification is for \n\nnon-U.S. citizen/lawful permanent resident victims of certain crimes \n\nwho cooperate with an investigation or prosecution of those crimes. \n\nThere is a limit of 10,000 principals per fiscal year. This rule would \n\npropose to establish new procedures to be followed to petition for the \n\nU nonimmigrant classifications. Specifically, the rule would address \n\nthe essential elements that must be demonstrated to receive the \n\nnonimmigrant classification, procedures that must be followed to file a \n\npetition and evidentiary guidance to assist in the petitioning process. \n\nEligible victims would be allowed to remain in the United States if \n\ngranted U nonimmigrant status. The Trafficking Victims Protection \n\nReauthorization Act of 2008, Public Law 110-457, and the Violence \n\nAgainst Women Reauthorization Act (VAWA) of 2013, Public Law 113-4, \n\nmade amendments to the U nonimmigrant status provisions of the \n\nImmigration and Nationality Act. The Department of Homeland Security \n\nhad issued an interim final rule in 2007.\n\n Statement of Need: This regulation is necessary to allow alien \n\nvictims of certain crimes to petition for U nonimmigrant status. U \n\nnonimmigrant status is available to eligible victims of certain \n\nqualifying criminal activity who: (1) Has suffered substantial physical \n\nor mental abuse as a result of the qualifying criminal activity; (2) \n\nthe alien possesses information about the crime; (3) the alien has \n\nbeen, is being, or is likely to be helpful in the investigation\n\n[[Page 76538]]\n\nor prosecution of the crime; and (4) the criminal activity took place \n\nin the United States, including military installations and Indian \n\nmailto:ted.h.kim@uscis.dhs.gov\n\n\ncountry, or the territories or possessions of the United States. This \n\nrule addresses the eligibility requirements that must be met for \n\nclassification as a U nonimmigrant alien and implements statutory \n\namendments to these requirements, streamlines the procedures to \n\npetition for U nonimmigrant status, and provides evidentiary guidance \n\nto assist in the petition process.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Congress created the U nonimmigrant \n\nclassification in the Battered Immigrant Women Protection Act of 2000 \n\n(BIWPA) to provide immigration relief for alien victims of certain \n\nqualifying criminal activity and who are helpful to law enforcement in \n\nthe investigation or prosecution of these crimes.\n\n Alternatives: To provide victims with immigration benefits and \n\nservices and keeping in mind the purpose of the U visa as a law \n\nenforcement tool, DHS is considering and using suggestions from \n\nstakeholders in developing this regulation. These suggestions came in \n\nthe form of public comment from the 2007 interim final rule as well as \n\nUSCIS' 6 years of experience with the U nonimmigrant status program, \n\nincluding regular meetings and outreach events with stakeholders and \n\nlaw enforcement.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: DHS estimated the total annual cost \n\nof the interim rule to petitioners to be $6.2 million in the interim \n\nfinal rule published in 2007. This cost included the biometric services \n\nfee, the opportunity cost of time needed to submit the required forms, \n\nthe opportunity cost of time required and cost of traveling to visit a \n\nUSCIS Application Support Center. DHS is currently in the process of \n\nupdating our cost estimates since U nonimmigrant visa petitioners are \n\nno longer required to pay the biometric services fee. The anticipated \n\nbenefits of these expenditures include assistance to victims of \n\nqualifying criminal activity and their families and increases in \n\narrests and prosecutions of criminals nationwide. Additional benefits \n\ninclude heightened awareness by law enforcement of victimization of \n\naliens in their community, and streamlining the petitioning process so \n\nthat victims may benefit from this immigration relief.\n\n Risks: There is a statutory cap of 10,000 principal U nonimmigrant \n\nvisas that may be granted per fiscal year at 8 U.S.C. 1184(p)(2). \n\nEligible petitioners who are not granted principal U-1 nonimmigrant \n\nstatus due solely to the numerical limit will be placed on a waiting \n\nlist maintained by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). \n\nTo protect U-1 petitioners and their families, USCIS will use various \n\n\n\nmeans to prevent the removal of U-1 petitioners and their eligible \n\nfamily members on the waiting list, including exercising its authority \n\nto allow deferred action, parole, and stays of removal, in cooperation \n\nwith other DHS components.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInterim Final Rule.................. 09/17/07 72 FR 53013\n\nInterim Final Rule Effective........ 10/17/07\n\nInterim Final Rule Comment Period 11/17/07\n\n End.\n\nNPRM................................ 10/00/15\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, Local, State.\n\n Additional Information: Transferred from RIN 1115-AG39.\n\n URL For More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL For Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Maureen A.

Exception to the Persecution Bar for Asylum, Refugee, and Temporary \n\nProtected Status, and Withholding of Removal\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 8 U.S.C. 1101; 8 U.S.C. 1103; 8 U.S.C. 1158; 8 \n\nU.S.C. 1226; Pub.

The proposed \n\namendment would provide a limited exception for actions taken by the \n\napplicant under duress and clarify the required levels of the \n\napplicant's knowledge of the persecution.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: In Negusie v. Holder, 129 S. Ct. 1159 \n\n(2009), the Supreme Court addressed whether the persecutor bar should \n\napply where an alien's actions were taken under duress. DHS believes \n\nthat this is an appropriate subject for rulemaking and proposes to \n\namend the applicable regulations to set out its interpretation of the \n\nstatute. In developing this regulatory initiative, DHS has carefully \n\nconsidered the purpose and history behind enactment of the persecutor \n\nbar, including its international law origins and the criminal law \n\nconcepts upon which they are based.\n\n Alternatives: DHS did consider the alternative of not publishing a \n\nrulemaking on these issues. To leave this important area of the law \n\nwithout an administrative interpretation would confuse adjudicators and \n\nthe public.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The programs affected by this rule \n\nexist so that the United States may respond effectively to global \n\nhumanitarian situations and assist people who are in need. USCIS \n\nprovides a number of humanitarian programs and protection to assist \n\nindividuals in need of shelter or aid from disasters, oppression, \n\nemergency medical issues, and other urgent circumstances. This rule \n\nwill advance the humanitarian goals of the asylum/refugee program, and \n\nother specialized programs. The main benefits of such goals tend to be \n\nintangible and difficult to quantify in economic and monetary terms. \n\nThese forms of relief have not been available to individuals who \n\nengaged in persecution of others under duress. This rule will allow an \n\nexception to this bar from protection for applicants who can meet the \n\n\n\nappropriate evidentiary standard. Consequently, this rule may result in \n\na small increase in the number of applicants for humanitarian programs.\n\n[[Page 76539]]\n\nTo the extent a small increase in applicants occurs, there could be \n\nadditional fee costs incurred by these applicants.\n\n Risks: If DHS were not to publish a regulation, the public would \n\nface a lengthy period of confusion on these issues. There could also be \n\ninconsistent interpretations of the statutory language, leading to \n\nsignificant litigation and delay for the affected public.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 10/00/15\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Agency Contact: Ronald W.

The classification was designed for eligible victims of severe \n\nforms of trafficking in persons who aid law enforcement with their \n\ninvestigation or prosecution of the traffickers, and who can establish \n\nthat they would suffer extreme hardship involving unusual and severe \n\nharm if they were removed from the United States. The rule streamlines \n\napplication procedures and responsibilities for the Department of \n\nHomeland Security (DHS) and provides guidance to the public on how to \n\nmeet certain requirements to obtain T nonimmigrant status. Several \n\nreauthorizations, including the Violence Against Women Reauthorization \n\nAct of 2013, Public Law 113-4, have made amendments to the T \n\nnonimmigrant status provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. \n\nThis rule implements those amendments.\n\n Statement of Need: This rule addresses the essential elements that \n\nmust be demonstrated for classification as a T nonimmigrant alien and \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nmailto:william.k.renwick@uscis.dhs.gov\n\n\nimplements statutory amendments to these elements, streamlines the \n\nprocedures to be followed by applicants to apply for T nonimmigrant \n\nstatus, and evidentiary guidance to assist in the application process.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Section 107(e) of the Victims of \n\nTrafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 Public Law 106-386, as \n\namended, established the T classification to provide immigration relief \n\nfor certain eligible victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons \n\nwho assist law enforcement authorities in investigating and prosecuting \n\nthe perpetrators of these crimes.\n\n Alternatives: To provide victims with immigration benefits and \n\nservices, keeping in mind the purpose of the T visa also being a law \n\nenforcement tool, DHS is considering and using suggestions from \n\nstakeholders in\n\n[[Page 76540]]\n\ndeveloping this regulation. These suggestions came in the form of \n\npublic comment to the 2002 interim final rule, as well as from over 10 \n\nyears of experience with the T nonimmigrant status program, including \n\nregular meetings with stakeholders and regular outreach events.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Applicants for T nonimmigrant status \n\ndo not pay application or biometric fees. The anticipated benefits of \n\nthese expenditures include: Assistance to trafficked victims and their \n\nfamilies, prosecution of traffickers in persons, and the elimination of \n\nabuses caused by trafficking activities. Benefits which may be \n\nattributed to the implementation of this rule are expected to be: (1) \n\nAn increase in the number of cases brought forward for investigation \n\nand/or prosecution; (2) heightened awareness by the law enforcement \n\ncommunity of trafficking in persons; and (3) streamlining the \n\napplication process for victims.\n\n Risks: There is a 5,000-person limit to the number of individuals \n\nwho can be granted T-1 status per fiscal year. Eligible applicants who \n\nare not granted T-1 status due solely to the numerical limit will be \n\nplaced on a waiting list maintained by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \n\nServices (USCIS).

Accordingly, it is necessary to make \n\namendments both to the DHS regulations and to the DOJ regulations. The \n\nSecretary and the Attorney General are making conforming amendments to \n\ntheir respective regulations in this single rulemaking document.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Congress extended the immigration laws of \n\nthe United States to the CNMI. The stated purpose of the CNRA is to \n\nensure effective border control procedures, to properly address \n\nnational security and homeland security concerns by extending U.S. \n\nimmigration law to the CNMI (phasing-out the CNMI's nonresident \n\ncontract worker program while minimizing to the greatest extent \n\npracticable the potential adverse economic and fiscal effects of that \n\nphase-out), to maximize the CNMI's potential for future economic and \n\nbusiness growth, and to assure worker protections from the potential \n\nfor abuse and exploitation.\n\n Alternatives:\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Costs: The interim rule established \n\nbasic provisions necessary for the application of the INA to the CNMI \n\nand updated definitions and existing DHS and DOJ regulations in areas \n\nthat were confusing or in conflict with how they are to be applied to \n\nimplement the INA in the CNMI. As such, that rule made no changes that \n\nhad identifiable direct or indirect economic impacts that could be \n\nquantified. Benefits: This final rule makes regulatory changes in order \n\nto lessen the adverse impacts of the CNRA on employers and employees in \n\nthe CNMI and assist the CNMI in its transition to the INA.\n\n Risks:\n\n\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInterim Final Rule.................. 10/28/09 74 FR 55725\n\nInterim Final Rule Comment Period 11/27/09\n\n End.\n\nCorrection.......................... 12/22/09 74 FR 67969\n\nFinal Action........................ 03/00/15\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Additional Information: CIS 2460-08.\n\n URL For More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL For Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Kevin J.

Special Immigrant Juvenile Petitions\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 8 U.S.C. 1101; 8 U.S.C. 1103; 8 U.S.C. 1151; 8 \n\nU.S.C. 1153; 8 U.S.C. 1154.\n\n CFR Citation: 8 CFR 204; 8 CFR 205; 8 CFR 245.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to \n\namend its regulations governing the Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) \n\nclassification and related applications for adjustment of status to \n\npermanent resident. The Secretary may grant SIJ classification to \n\naliens whose reunification with one or both parents is not viable due \n\nto abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis found under State \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nmailto:kevin.j.cummings@uscis.dhs.gov\n\n\nlaw. This proposed rule would require a petitioner to be under the age \n\nof 21 only at the time of filing for SIJ classification. This proposed \n\nrule would require that juvenile court dependency be in effect at the \n\ntime of filing for SIJ classification and continue through the time of \n\nadjudication unless the age of the juvenile prevents such continued \n\ndependency. Aliens granted SIJ classification are eligible immediately \n\nto apply for adjustment of status to that of permanent resident. The \n\nDepartment received comments on the proposed rule in 2011 and intends \n\nto issue a final rule in the coming year.\n\n Statement of Need: SIJ classification is available to eligible \n\nalien children who: (1) Are present in the United States; (2) have been \n\ndeclared dependent on a juvenile court or an individual or entity \n\nappointed by a State or juvenile court; (3) cannot reunify with one or \n\nboth of the alien's parents due to abuse, abandonment, neglect, or a \n\nsimilar basis under State law; (4) it is not in the best interest to be \n\nreturned to the home country. DHS must also consent to the grant of SIJ \n\nclassification. This rule would address the eligibility requirements \n\nthat must be met for SIJ classification and related adjustment of \n\nstatus, implement statutory amendments to these requirements, and \n\nprovide procedural and evidentiary guidance to assist in the petition \n\nprocess.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Congress established the SIJ classification \n\nin the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT). The 1998 Appropriations Act \n\namended the SIJ classification by linking eligibility to aliens \n\ndeclared dependent on a juvenile court due to abuse, abandonment, or \n\nneglect and creating consent functions. The Trafficking Victims \n\nProtection Reauthorization Act of 2008 made many changes to the SIJ \n\nclassification including: (1) Creating a requirement that the alien's \n\nreunification with one or both parents not be viable due to abuse, \n\nabandonment, neglect, or a similar basis under State law; (2) expanding \n\nthe aliens who may be eligible to include those placed by a juvenile \n\ncourt with an individual or entity; (3) modifying the consent \n\nfunctions; (4) providing age-out protection; and (5) creating a \n\ntimeframe for adjudications.\n\n Alternatives: To provide victims with immigration benefits and \n\nservices, keeping in mind the humanitarian purpose of the SIJ \n\nclassification and the vulnerable nature of alien children who have \n\nbeen abused, abandoned or neglected, DHS is considering and using \n\nsuggestions from stakeholders in developing this regulation. These \n\n\n\nsuggestions came in the form of public comment from the 2011 proposed \n\nrule.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: In the 2011 proposed rule, DHS \n\nestimated there would be no additional regulatory compliance costs for \n\npetitioning individuals or any program costs for the government as a \n\nresult of the proposed amendments. Qualitatively, DHS estimated that \n\nthe proposed rule would codify the practices and procedures currently \n\nimplemented via internal policy directives issued by USCIS, thereby \n\nestablishing clear guidance for petitioners. DHS is currently in the \n\nprocess of updating our final cost and benefit estimates.\n\n Risks: The failure to promulgate a final rule in this area presents \n\nsignificant risk of further inconsistency and confusion in the law. The \n\nGovernment's interests in fair, efficient, and consistent adjudications \n\nwould be compromised.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 09/06/11 76 FR 54978\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 11/07/11 .......................\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 07/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, State.\n\n URL for More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL for Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Maureen A.

Allowing the eligible class of H-4 \n\ndependent spouses to work encourages professionals with high demand \n\nskills to remain in the country and help spur the innovation and growth \n\nof U.S. companies.\n\n Statement of Need: Under current regulations, DHS does not list H-4 \n\ndependents (spouses and unmarried children under 21) of H-1B \n\nnonimmigrant workers among the classes of aliens eligible to work in \n\nthe United States. See 8 CFR 274a.12. The lack of employment \n\nauthorization for H-4 dependent spouses often gives rise to personal \n\nand economic hardship for the families of H-1B nonimmigrants the longer \n\nthey remain in the United States. In many cases, for those H-1B \n\nnonimmigrants and their families who wish to remain permanently in the \n\nUnited States, the timeframe required for an H-1B nonimmigrant to \n\nacquire lawful permanent residence through his or her employment may be \n\nmany years. As a result, retention of highly educated and highly \n\nskilled nonimmigrant workers in the United States can become \n\nproblematic for employers. Retaining highly skilled persons who\n\n[[Page 76542]]\n\nintend to acquire lawful permanent residence is important to the United \n\nStates given the contributions of these individuals to the U.S. \n\neconomy, including advances in entrepreneurial and research and \n\ndevelopment endeavors, which correlate highly with overall economic \n\ngrowth and job creation. In this rule, DHS proposes to extend \n\nemployment authorization to certain H-4 dependent spouses of H-1B \n\nnonimmigrants. DHS believes that this rule would further encourage H-1B \n\nskilled workers to remain in the United States, continue contributing \n\n\n\nto the U.S. economy, and not abandon their efforts to become lawful \n\npermanent residents, to the detriment of their U.S. employer, because \n\ntheir H-4 nonimmigrant spouses are unable to obtain work authorization. \n\nThis rule would also remove the disincentive for many H-1B families to \n\nstart the immigrant process due to the lengthy waiting periods \n\nassociated with acquiring status as a lawful permanent resident of the \n\nUnited States.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Sections 103(a), and 274A(h)(3) of the \n\nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA) generally authorize the Secretary \n\nto provide for employment authorization for aliens in the United \n\nStates. In addition, section 214(a)(1) of the INA authorizes the \n\nSecretary to prescribe regulations setting terms and conditions of \n\nadmission of nonimmigrants.\n\n Alternatives: In enacting the American Competitiveness in the \n\nTwenty-First Century Act of 2000 (AC21), Congress was especially \n\nconcerned with avoiding the disruption to U.S. businesses caused by the \n\nrequired departure of H-1B nonimmigrant workers (for whom the \n\nbusinesses intended to file employment-based immigrant visa petitions) \n\nupon the expiration of workers' maximum 6-year period of authorized \n\nstay. See S. Rep. No. 106-260, at 15 (2000). DHS rejected this \n\nalternative as overbroad, since such an alternative would offer \n\neligibility for employment authorization to those spouses of \n\nnonimmigrant workers who have not taken steps to demonstrate a desire \n\nto continue to remain in and contribute to the U.S. economy by seeking \n\nlawful permanent residence.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The changes would impact spouses of \n\nH-1B workers who have been admitted or have extended their stay under \n\nthe provisions of AC21 or who have an approved Immigrant Petition for \n\nAlien Worker, Form I-140. This population would include H-4 dependent \n\nspouses of H-1B nonimmigrants if the H-1B nonimmigrants are either the \n\nbeneficiaries of an approved Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker, Form \n\nI-140, or have been granted an extension of their authorized period of \n\nadmission in the United States under the AC21, amended by the 21st \n\nCentury Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act. The \n\ncosts of the rule stem from filing fees and the opportunity costs of \n\ntime associated with filing an Application for Employment Authorization \n\nfor those eligible H-4 spouses who decide to seek employment while \n\nresiding in the United States. Allowing certain H-4 spouses the \n\nopportunity to work results in a negligible increase to the overall \n\ndomestic labor force. The benefits of this rule would accrue to U.S. \n\n\n\nemployers and the U.S. economy by increasing the likelihood of \n\nretaining highly-skilled persons who intend to adjust to lawful \n\npermanent resident status. This is important when considering the \n\ncontributions of these individuals to the U.S. economy, including \n\nadvances in entrepreneurial and research and development endeavors, \n\nwhich are highly correlated with overall economic growth and job \n\ncreation. In addition, the amendments bring U.S. immigration laws more \n\nin line with other countries that seek to attract skilled foreign \n\nworkers.\n\n Risks:\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 05/12/14 79 FR 26886\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 07/11/14\n\nFinal Action........................ 12/00/14\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n International Impacts: This regulatory action will be likely to \n\nhave international trade and investment effects, or otherwise be of \n\ninternational interest.\n\n Additional Information: Includes Retrospective Review under E.O. \n\n13563.\n\n Agency Contact: Kevin J.

DHS is also amending the \n\nregulations to provide authorization for continued employment with the \n\nsame employer if the employer has timely filed for an extension of the \n\nnonimmigrant's stay. DHS is also providing for this same continued work \n\nauthorization for Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)-\n\nOnly Transitional Worker (CW-1) nonimmigrants if a Petition for a CNMI-\n\nOnly Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker, Form I-129CW, is timely filed to \n\napply for an extension of stay. In addition, DHS is updating the \n\nregulations describing the filing procedures for extensions of stay and \n\nchange of status requests to include the principal E-3 and H-1B1 \n\nnonimmigrant classifications. These changes harmonize the regulations \n\nfor E-3, H-1B1, and CW-1 nonimmigrant classifications with existing \n\nregulations for other, similarly situated nonimmigrant classifications. \n\nFinally, DHS is expanding the current list of evidentiary criteria for \n\nemployment-based first preference (EB-1) outstanding professors and \n\nresearchers to allow the submission of evidence comparable to the other \n\nforms of\n\n[[Page 76543]]\n\nevidence already listed in the regulations. This harmonizes the \n\nregulations for EB-1 outstanding professors and researchers with other \n\nemployment-based immigrant categories that already allow for submission \n\nof comparable evidence. DHS is amending the regulations to benefit \n\nthese high-skilled workers and CW-1 transitional workers by removing \n\nunnecessary hurdles that place such workers at a disadvantage when \n\ncompared to similarly situated workers in other visa classifications.\n\n Statement of Need: The proposal would improve the programs serving \n\n\n\nthe E-3, H-1B1, and CW-1 nonimmigrant classifications and the EB-1 \n\nimmigrant classification for outstanding professors and researchers. \n\nThe proposed changes harmonize the regulations governing these \n\nclassifications with regulations governing similar visa classifications \n\nby removing unnecessary hurdles that place E-3, H-1B1, CW-1 and certain \n\nEB-1 workers at a disadvantage.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The Homeland Security Act of 2002, Public \n\nLaw 107-296, section 102, 116 Stat. 2135 (Nov. 25, 2002), 6 U.S.C. 112, \n\nand the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (INA), charge the \n\nSecretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) with administration and \n\nenforcement of the immigration and nationality laws. See INA section \n\n103, 8 U.S.C. 1103.\n\n Alternatives: A number of the changes are part of DHS's \n\nRetrospective Review Plan for Existing Regulations. During development \n\nof DHS's Retrospective Review Plan, DHS received a comment from the \n\npublic requesting specific changes to the DHS regulations that govern \n\ncontinued work authorization for E-3 and H-1B1 nonimmigrants when an \n\nextension of status petition is timely filed, and to expand the types \n\nof evidence allowable in support of immigrant petitions for outstanding \n\nresearchers or professors. This rule is responsive to that comment, and \n\nwith the retrospective review principles of Executive Order 13563.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The E-3 and H-1B1 provisions do not \n\nimpose any additional costs on petitioning employers, individuals or \n\ngovernment entities, including the Federal government. The regulatory \n\namendments provide equity for E-3 and H-1B1 nonimmigrants relative to \n\nother employment-based nonimmigrants listed in 8 CFR 274a.12.(b)(20). \n\nAdditionally, this provision may allow employers of E-3 or H-1B1 \n\nnonimmigrant workers to avoid the cost of lost productivity resulting \n\nfrom interruptions of work while an extension of stay petition is \n\npending. Additionally, the regulatory changes that clarify principal E-\n\n3 and H-1B1 nonimmigrant classifications are employment authorized \n\nincident to status with a specific employer, and that these \n\nnonimmigrant classifications that must file a petition with USCIS to \n\nmake an extension of stay or change of status request simply codify \n\ncurrent practice and impose no additional costs. Likewise, the \n\nregulatory amendments governing CW-1 nonimmigrants would not impose any \n\nadditional costs for petitioning employers or for CW-1 nonimmigrant \n\nworkers. The benefits of the rule are to provide equity for CW-1 \n\nnonimmigrant workers whose extension of stay request is filed by the \n\nsame employer relative to other CW-1 nonimmigrant workers. \n\n\n\nAdditionally, this provision mitigates any potential distortion in the \n\nlabor market for employers of CW-1 nonimmigrant workers created by \n\ncurrent inconsistent regulatory provisions which currently offer an \n\nincentive to file for extensions of stay with new employers rather than \n\ncurrent employers. The portion of the rule addressing the evidentiary \n\nrequirements for the EB-1 outstanding professor and researcher \n\nemployment-based immigrant classification allows for the submission of \n\ncomparable evidence (achievements not listed in the criteria such as \n\nimportant patents or prestigious, peer-reviewed funding grants) for \n\nthat listed in 8 CFR 204.5(i)(3)(i)(A) through (F) to establish that \n\nthe EB-1 professor or researcher is recognized internationally as \n\noutstanding in his or her academic field. Harmonizing the evidentiary \n\nrequirements for EB-1 outstanding professors and researchers with other \n\ncomparable employment-based immigrant classifications provides equity \n\nfor EB-1 outstanding professors and researchers relative to those other \n\nemployment-based visa categories.\n\n Risks:\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 05/12/14 79 FR 26870\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 07/11/14\n\nFinal Action........................ 04/00/15\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Organizations.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n International Impacts: This regulatory action will be likely to \n\nhave international trade and investment effects, or otherwise be of \n\ninternational interest.\n\n Additional Information: Includes Retrospective Review under \n\nExecutive Order 13563.\n\n Agency Contact: Kevin J.

Vessel Requirements for Notices of Arrival and Departure, and \n\nAutomatic Identification System\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 33 U.S.C. 1223; 33 U.S.C. 1225; 33 U.S.C. 1231; 46 \n\nU.S.C. 3716; 46 U.S.C. 8502; 46 U.S.C. 701; sec 102 of Pub.

These expanded requirements would better enable the \n\nCoast Guard to correlate vessel AIS data with NOAD data, enhance our \n\nability to identify and track vessels, detect anomalies, improve \n\nnavigation safety, and heighten our overall maritime domain awareness. \n\nThe NOAD portion of this rulemaking could expand the applicability of \n\nthe NOAD regulations by changing the minimum size of vessels covered \n\nbelow the current 300 gross tons, require a notice of departure when a \n\nvessel is departing for a foreign port or place, and mandate electronic \n\nsubmission of NOAD notices to the National Vessel Movement Center. The \n\nAIS portion of this rulemaking would expand current AIS carriage \n\nrequirements for the population identified in the Safety of Life at Sea \n\n(SOLAS) Convention and the Marine Transportation Marine Transportation \n\nSecurity Act (MTSA) of 2002.\n\n Statement of Need: There is no central mechanism in place to \n\ncapture vessel, crew, passenger, or specific cargo information on \n\nvessels less than or equal to 300 gross tons (GT) intending to arrive \n\nat or depart from U.S. ports unless they are arriving with certain\n\n[[Page 76544]]\n\ndangerous cargo (CDC) or at a port in the 7th Coast Guard District; nor \n\nis there a requirement for vessels to submit notification of departure \n\ninformation. The lack of NOAD information of this large and diverse \n\npopulation of vessels represents a substantial gap in our maritime \n\ndomain awareness (MDA). We can minimize this gap and enhance MDA by \n\nexpanding NOAD applicability to vessels greater than 300 GT, all \n\nforeign commercial vessels and all U.S. commercial vessels coming from \n\na foreign port, and further enhance (and corroborate) MDA by tracking \n\nthose vessels (and others) with AIS. This information is necessary in \n\n\n\norder to expand our MDA and provide the Nation maritime safety and \n\nsecurity.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: This rulemaking is based on congressional \n\nauthority provided in the Ports and Waterways Safety Act (see 33 U.S.C. \n\n1223(a)(5), 1225, 1226, and 1231) and section 102 of the Maritime \n\nTransportation Security Act of 2002 (codified at 46 U.S.C. 70114).\n\n Alternatives: Our goal is to extend our MDA and to identify \n\nanomalies by correlating vessel NOAD data with AIS data. NOAD and AIS \n\ninformation from a greater number of vessels, as proposed in this \n\nrulemaking, would expand our MDA. We considered expanding NOAD and AIS \n\nto even more vessels, but we determined that we needed additional \n\nlegislative authority to expand AIS beyond what we propose in this \n\nrulemaking, and that it was best to combine additional NOAD expansion \n\nwith future AIS expansion. Although not in conjunction with a proposed \n\nrule, the Coast Guard sought comment regarding expansion of AIS \n\ncarriage to other waters and other vessels not subject to the current \n\nrequirements (68 FR 39369, July 1, 2003; USCG 2003-14878; see also 68 \n\nFR 39355). Those comments were reviewed and considered in drafting this \n\nrule and are available in this docket. To fulfill our statutory \n\nobligations, the Coast Guard needs to receive AIS reports and NOADs \n\nfrom vessels identified in this rulemaking that currently are not \n\nrequired to provide this information. Policy or other nonbinding \n\nstatements by the Coast Guard addressed to the owners of these vessels \n\nwould not produce the information required to sufficiently enhance our \n\nMDA to produce the information required to fulfill our Agency \n\nobligations.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: This rulemaking will enhance the \n\nCoast Guard's regulatory program by making it more effective in \n\nachieving the regulatory objectives, which, in this case, is improved \n\nMDA. We provide flexibility in the type of AIS system that can be used, \n\nallowing for reduced cost burden. This rule is also streamlined to \n\ncorrespond with Customs and Border Protection's APIS requirements, \n\nthereby reducing unjustified burdens. We are further developing \n\nestimates of cost and benefit that were published in 2008. In the 2008 \n\nNPRM, we estimated that both segments of the proposed rule would affect \n\napproximately 42,607 vessels. The total number of domestic vessels \n\naffected is approximately 17,323 and the total number of foreign \n\nvessels affected is approximately 25,284. We estimated that the 10-year \n\ntotal present discounted value or cost of the proposed rule to U.S. \n\n\n\nvessel owners is between $132.2 and $163.7 million (7 and 3 percent \n\ndiscount rates, respectively, 2006 dollars) over the period of \n\nanalysis. The Coast Guard believes that this rule, through a \n\ncombination of NOAD and AIS, would strengthen and enhance maritime \n\nsecurity. The combination of NOAD and AIS would create a synergistic \n\neffect between the two requirements. Ancillary or secondary benefits \n\nexist in the form of avoided injuries, fatalities, and barrels of oil \n\nnot spilled into the marine environment. In the 2008 NPRM, we estimated \n\nthat the total discounted benefit (injuries and fatalities) derived \n\nfrom 68 marine casualty cases analyzed over an 8-year data period from \n\n1996 to 2003 for the AIS portion of the proposed rule is between $24.7 \n\nand $30.6 million using $6.3 million for the value of statistical life \n\n(VSL) at 7 percent and 3 percent discount rates, respectively. Just \n\nbased on barrels of oil not spilled, we expect the AIS portion of the \n\nproposed rule to prevent 22 barrels of oil from being spilled annually. \n\nThe Coast Guard may revise costs and benefits for the final rule to \n\nreflect changes resulting from public comments.\n\n Risks: Considering the economic utility of U.S. ports, waterways, \n\nand coastal approaches, it is clear that a terrorist incident against \n\nour U.S. Maritime Transportation System (MTS) would have a direct \n\nimpact on U.S. users and consumers and could potentially have a \n\ndisastrous impact on global shipping, international trade, and the \n\nworld economy. By improving the ability of the Coast Guard both to \n\nidentify potential terrorists coming to the United States while the \n\nterrorists are far from our shores and to coordinate appropriate \n\nresponses and intercepts before the vessel reaches a U.S. port, this \n\nrulemaking would contribute significantly to the expansion of MDA, and \n\nconsequently is instrumental in addressing the threat posed by \n\nterrorist actions against the MTS.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 12/16/08 73 FR 76295\n\nNotice of Public Meeting............ 01/21/09 74 FR 3534\n\nNotice of Second Public Meeting..... 03/02/09 74 FR 9071\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 04/15/09\n\nNotice of Second Public Meeting 04/15/09\n\n Comment Period End.\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 12/00/14\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Additional Information: We have indicated in past notices and \n\nrulemaking documents, and it remains the case, that we have worked to \n\ncoordinate implementation of AIS MTSA requirements with the development \n\nof our ability to take advantage of AIS data (68 FR 39355 and 39370, \n\nJul. 1, 2003).\n\n Docket ID USCG-2005-21869.\n\n URL for More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL for Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact:, LCDR Michael D.

Final, \n\nStatutory, October 15, 2011. On October 15, 2010, the Coast Guard \n\nAuthorization Act of 2010 was enacted as Public Law 111-281. It \n\nrequires that a proposed rule be issued within 90 days after enactment \n\nand that a final rule be issued within 1 year of enactment.\n\n Abstract: This rulemaking would implement a program of inspection \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nmailto:michael.d.lendvay@uscg.mil\nmailto:jorge.arroyo@uscg.mil\n\n\nfor certification of towing vessels, which were previously uninspected. \n\nIt would prescribe standards for safety management systems and third-\n\nparty auditors and surveyors, along with standards for construction, \n\noperation, vessel systems, safety equipment, and recordkeeping.\n\n Statement of Need: This rulemaking would implement section 415 of \n\nthe Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2004. The intent of \n\nthe proposed rule is to promote safer work practices and reduce \n\ncasualties on towing vessels by ensuring that towing vessels adhere to \n\nprescribed safety standards. This proposed rule was developed in \n\ncooperation with the Towing Vessel Safety Advisory Committee. It would \n\nestablish a new subchapter dedicated to towing vessels, covering vessel \n\nequipment, systems, operational standards, and inspection requirements.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Proposed new subchapter authority: 46 \n\nU.S.C. 3103, 3301, 3306, 3308, 3316, 8104, 8904; 33 CFR 1.05; DHS \n\nDelegation 0170.1. The Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of \n\n2004 (CGMTA 2004), Public Law 108-293, 118 Stat. 1028, (Aug. 9, 2004), \n\nestablished new authorities for towing vessels as follows: section 415 \n\nadded towing vessels, as defined in section 2101 of title 46, United \n\nStates Code (U.S.C.), as a class of vessels that are subject to safety \n\ninspections under chapter 33 of that title (Id. at 1047). Section 415 \n\nalso added new section 3306(j) of title 46, authorizing the Secretary \n\nof Homeland Security to establish, by regulation, a safety management \n\nsystem appropriate for the characteristics, methods of operation, and \n\nnature of service of towing vessels (Id.). Section 409 added new \n\nsection 8904(c) of title 46, U.S.C., authorizing the Secretary to \n\nestablish, by regulation, ``maximum hours of service (including \n\nrecording and recordkeeping of that service) of individuals engaged on \n\na towing vessel that is at least 26 feet in length measured from end to \n\nend over the deck (excluding the sheer).'' (Id. at 1044-45.)\n\n Alternatives: We considered the following alternatives for the \n\nnotice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM): One regulatory alternative would \n\nbe the addition of towing vessels to one or more existing subchapters \n\nthat deal with other inspected vessels, such as cargo and miscellaneous \n\nvessels (subchapter I), offshore supply vessels (subchapter L), or \n\nsmall passenger vessels (subchapter T). We do not believe, however, \n\nthat this approach would recognize the often ``unique'' nature and \n\ncharacteristics of the towing industry in general and towing vessels in \n\nparticular. The same approach could be adopted for use of a safety \n\nmanagement system by requiring compliance with title 33, Code of \n\nFederal Regulations, part 96 (Rules for the Safe Operation of Vessels \n\nand Safety Management Systems). Adoption of these requirements, without \n\nan alternative safety management system, would also not be \n\n\n\n``appropriate for the characteristics, methods of operation, and nature \n\nof service of towing vessels.'' The Coast Guard has had extensive \n\npublic involvement (four public meetings, over 100 separate comments \n\nsubmitted to the docket, as well as extensive ongoing dialogue with \n\nmembers of the Towing Safety Advisory Committee (TSAC)) regarding \n\ndevelopment of these regulations. Adoption of one of the alternatives \n\ndiscussed above would likely receive little public or industry support, \n\nespecially considering the TSAC efforts toward development of standards \n\nto be incorporated into a separate subchapter dealing specifically with \n\nthe inspection of towing vessels. An approach that would seem to be \n\nmore in keeping with the intent of Congress would be the adoption of \n\ncertain existing standards from those applied to other inspected \n\nvessels. In some cases, these existing standards would be appropriately \n\nmodified and tailored to the nature and operation of certain categories \n\nof towing vessels. The adopted standards would come from inspected \n\nvessels that have demonstrated ``good marine practice'' within the \n\nmaritime community. These regulations would be incorporated into a \n\nsubchapter specifically addressing the inspection for certification of \n\ntowing vessels. The law requiring the inspection for certification of \n\ntowing vessels is a statutory mandate, compelling the Coast Guard to \n\ndevelop regulations appropriate for the nature of towing vessels and \n\ntheir specific industry.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: We estimate that owners and \n\noperators of towing vessels would incur additional annualized costs in \n\nthe range of $14.3 million to $17.1 million at 7 percent discounted \n\nfrom this rulemaking. The cost of this rulemaking would involve \n\nprovisions for safety management systems, standards for construction, \n\noperation, vessel systems, safety equipment, and recordkeeping. Our \n\ncost assessment includes existing and new vessels. The Coast Guard \n\ndeveloped the requirements in the proposed rule by researching both the \n\nhuman factors and equipment failures that caused towing vessel \n\naccidents. We believe that the proposed rule would address a wide range \n\nof causes of towing vessel accidents and supports the main goal of \n\nimproving safety in the towing industry. The primary benefit of the \n\nproposed rule is an increase in vessel safety and a resulting decrease \n\nin the risk of towing vessel accidents and their consequences. We \n\nestimate an annualized benefit of $28.5 million from this rule.\n\n Risks: This regulatory action would reduce the risk of towing \n\nvessel accidents and their consequences. Towing vessel accidents result \n\nin fatalities, injuries, property damage, pollution, and delays.\n\n Timetable:\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 08/11/11 76 FR 49976\n\nNotice of Public Meetings........... 09/09/11 76 FR 55847\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 12/09/11\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 08/00/15\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Governmental Jurisdictions, \n\nOrganizations.\n\n Government Levels Affected: State.\n\n Additional Information: Docket ID USCG-2006-24412.\n\n URL for More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL for Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: LCDR William Nabach, Project Manager, Office of \n\nDesign & Engineering Standards, CG-OES-2, Department of Homeland \n\nSecurity, U.S. Coast Guard, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE., \n\nSTOP 7509, Washington, DC 20593-7509, Phone: 202 372-1386, Email: \n\nwilliam.a.nabach@uscg.mil\n\n RIN: 1625-AB06\n\nDHS--USCG\n\n80.

The final rule is required 2 years \n\nafter the commencement of the pilot program. The final rule is required \n\n2 years after the commencement of the pilot program.\n\n Abstract: The Coast Guard is establishing electronic card reader \n\nrequirements for maritime facilities and vessels to be used in \n\ncombination with TSA's Transportation Worker Identification Credential \n\n(TWIC). Congress enacted several statutory requirements within the \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nmailto:william.a.nabach@uscg.mil\n\n\nSecurity and Accountability for Every (SAFE) Port Act of 2006 to guide \n\nregulations pertaining to TWIC readers, including the need to evaluate \n\nTSA's final pilot program report as part of the TWIC reader rulemaking. \n\nDuring the rulemaking process, we will take into account the final \n\npilot data and the various conditions in which TWIC readers may be \n\nemployed. For example, we will consider the types of vessels and \n\nfacilities that will use TWIC readers, locations of secure and \n\nrestricted areas, operational constraints, and need for accessibility. \n\nRecordkeeping requirements, amendments to security plans, and the \n\nrequirement for data exchanges (i.e., Canceled Card List) between TSA \n\nand vessel or facility owners/operators will also be addressed in this \n\nrulemaking.\n\n Statement of Need: The Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) \n\nof 2002 explicitly required the issuance of a biometric transportation \n\nsecurity card to all U.S. merchant mariners and to workers requiring \n\nunescorted access to secure areas of MTSA-regulated facilities and \n\nvessels. On May 22, 2006, the Transportation Security Administration \n\n(TSA) and the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking \n\n(NPRM) to carry out this statute, proposing a Transportation Worker \n\nIdentification Credential (TWIC) Program where TSA conducts security \n\nthreat assessments and issues identification credentials, while the \n\nCoast Guard requires integration of the TWIC into the access control \n\nsystems of vessels, facilities, and Outer Continental Shelf facilities. \n\nBased on comments received during the public comment period, TSA and \n\nthe Coast Guard split the TWIC rule. The final TWIC rule, published in \n\nJanuary of 2007, addressed the issuance of the TWIC and use of the TWIC \n\nas a visual identification credential at access control points. In an \n\nANPRM, published in March of 2009, and a NPRM, published in April of \n\n2013, the Coast Guard proposed a risk-based approach to TWIC reader \n\nrequirements and included proposals to classify MTSA-regulated vessels \n\nand facilities into one of three risk groups, based on specific factors \n\nrelated to TSI consequence, and apply TWIC reader requirements for \n\nvessels and facilities in conjunction with their relative risk-group \n\nplacement. This rulemaking is necessary to comply with the SAFE Port \n\nAct and to complete the implementation of the TWIC Program in our \n\nports. By requiring electronic card readers at vessels and facilities, \n\nthe Coast Guard will further enhance port security and improve access \n\ncontrol measures.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The statutory authorities for the Coast \n\nGuard to prescribe, change, revise, or amend these regulations are \n\nprovided under 33 U.S.C. 1226, 1231; 46 U.S.C. chapter 701; 50 U.S.C. \n\n191, 192; Executive Order 12656, 3 CFR 1988 Comp., p. 585; 33 CFR 1.05-\n\n\n\n1, 6.04-11, 6.14, 6.16, and 6.19; Department of Homeland Security \n\nDelegation No. 0170.1.\n\n Alternatives: The implementation of TWIC reader requirements is \n\nmandated by the SAFE Port Act. We considered several alternatives in \n\nthe formulation of this proposal. These alternatives were based on risk \n\nanalysis of different combinations of facility and vessel populations \n\nfacing TWIC reader requirements. The preferred alternative selected \n\nallowed the Coast Guard to target the highest risk entities while \n\nminimizing the overall burden.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The main cost drivers of this rule \n\nare the acquisition and installation of TWIC readers and the \n\nmaintenance of the affected entity's TWIC reader system. Initial costs, \n\nwhich we would distribute over a phased-in implementation period, \n\nconsist predominantly of the costs to purchase, install, and integrate \n\napproved TWIC readers into their current physical access control \n\nsystem. Recurring annual costs will be driven by costs associated with \n\ncanceled card list updates, opportunity costs associated with delays \n\nand replacement of TWICs that cannot be read, and maintenance of the \n\naffected entity's TWIC reader system. As reported in the NPRM \n\nRegulatory Analysis, the total 10-year total industry and government \n\ncost for the TWIC is $234.3 million undiscounted and $186.1 discounted \n\nat 7 percent. We estimate the annualized cost of this rule to industry \n\nto be $26.5 million at a 7 percent discount rate. The benefits of the \n\nrulemaking include the enhancement of the security of vessel ports and \n\nother facilities by ensuring that only individuals who hold valid TWICs \n\nare granted unescorted access to secure areas at those locations.\n\n Risks: USCG used risk-based decision-making to develop this \n\nrulemaking. Based on this analysis, the Coast Guard has proposed \n\nrequiring higher-risk vessels and facilities to meet the requirements \n\nfor electronic TWIC inspection, while continuing to allow lower-risk \n\nvessels and facilities to use TWIC as a visual identification \n\ncredential.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nANPRM............................... 03/27/09 74 FR 13360\n\nNotice of Public Meeting............ 04/15/09 74 FR 17444\n\nANPRM Comment Period End............ 05/26/09\n\nNotice of Public Meeting Comment 05/26/09\n\n Period End.\n\nNPRM................................ 03/22/13 78 FR 20558\n\n\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 05/10/13 78 FR 27335\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended End.... 06/20/13\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 04/00/15\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Governmental Jurisdictions.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Additional Information: Docket ID USCG-2007-28915.\n\n URL for More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL for Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: LT Mason Wilcox, Project Manager, Department of \n\nHomeland Security, U.S. Coast Guard, Commandant (CG-FAC-2), 2703 Martin \n\nLuther King Jr Ave. SE., STOP 7501, Washington, DC 20593-7501, Phone: \n\n202 372-1123, Email: mason.c.wilcox@uscg.mil\n\n Related RIN: Related to 1625-AB02\n\n RIN: 1625-AB21\n\nDHS--U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION (USCBP)\n\nProposed Rule Stage\n\n81.

ACAS would require the submission of certain advance \n\nelectronic information for air cargo. This will allow CBP to better \n\ntarget and identify dangerous cargo and ensure that any risk associated \n\nwith such cargo is mitigated before the aircraft departs for the United \n\nStates.

This advance information allows CBP to \n\ndetermine before their departure whether these travelers are eligible \n\nto travel to the United States under the VWP and whether such travel \n\nposes a security risk. The interim final rule also fulfilled the \n\nrequirements of section 711 of the Implementing recommendations of the \n\n9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (9/11 Act). In addition to fulfilling a \n\nstatutory mandate, the rule served the two goals of promoting border \n\nsecurity and legitimate travel to the United States. By modernizing the \n\nVWP, the ESTA increases national security and provides for greater \n\nefficiencies in the screening of international travelers by allowing \n\nfor vetting of subjects of potential interest well before boarding, \n\nthereby reducing traveler delays at the ports of entry. CBP requested \n\ncomments on all aspects of the interim final rule and plans to issue a \n\nfinal rule after completion of the comment analysis.\n\n Statement of Need: The rule fulfills the requirements of section \n\n711 of the 9/11 Act to develop and implement a fully automated \n\nelectronic travel\n\n[[Page 76548]]\n\nauthorization system in advance of travel for VWP travelers. The \n\nadvance information allows CBP to determine before their departure \n\nmailto:regina.kang@cbp.dhs.gov\n\n\nwhether VWP travelers are eligible to travel to the United States and \n\nto determine whether such travel poses a law enforcement or security \n\nrisk. In addition to fulfilling a statutory mandate, the rule serves \n\nthe twin goals of promoting border security and legitimate travel to \n\nthe United States. ESTA increases national security by allowing for \n\nvetting of subjects of potential interest before they depart for the \n\nUnited States. It promotes legitimate travel to the United States by \n\nproviding for greater efficiencies in the screening of travelers \n\nthereby reducing traveler delays upon arrival at U.S. ports of entry.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The ESTA program is based on congressional \n\nauthority provided under section 711 of the Implementing \n\nRecommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-53) and \n\nsection 217 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \n\n1187.\n\n Alternatives: When developing the interim final rule, CBP \n\nconsidered three alternatives to this rule: (1) The ESTA requirements \n\nin the rule, but with a $1.50 fee per each travel authorization (more \n\ncostly) (2) The ESTA requirements in the rule, but with only the name \n\nof the passenger and the admissibility questions on the I-94W form \n\n(less burdensome) (3) The ESTA requirements in the rule, but only for \n\nthe countries entering the VWP after 2009 (no new requirements for VWP, \n\nreduced burden for newly entering countries). CBP determined that the \n\nrule provides the greatest level of enhanced security and efficiency at \n\nan acceptable cost to traveling public and potentially affected air \n\ncarriers.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The purpose of ESTA is to allow DHS \n\nand CBP to establish the eligibility of certain foreign travelers to \n\ntravel to the United States under the VWP, and whether the alien's \n\nproposed travel to the United States poses a law enforcement or \n\nsecurity risk. Upon review of such information, DHS will determine \n\nwhether the alien is eligible to travel to the United States under the \n\nVWP. Costs to Air & Sea Carriers: CBP estimated that 8 U.S.-based air \n\ncarriers and 11 sea carriers will be affected by the rule. An \n\nadditional 35 foreign-based air carriers and 5 sea carriers will be \n\naffected. CBP concluded that costs to air and sea carriers to support \n\nthe requirements of the ESTA program could cost $137 million to $1.1 \n\nbillion over the next 10 years depending on the level of effort \n\nrequired to integrate their systems with ESTA, how many passengers they \n\n\n\nneed to assist in applying for travel authorizations, and the discount \n\nrate applied to annual costs. Costs to Travelers: ESTA will present new \n\ncosts and burdens to travelers in VWP countries who were not previously \n\nrequired to submit any information to the U.S. Government in advance of \n\ntravel to the United States. Travelers from Roadmap countries who \n\nbecome VWP countries will also incur costs and burdens, though these \n\nare much less than obtaining a nonimmigrant visa (category B1/B2), \n\nwhich is currently required for short-term pleasure or business to \n\ntravel to the United States. CBP estimated that the total quantified \n\ncosts to travelers will range from $1.1 billion to $3.5 billion \n\ndepending on the number of travelers, the value of time, and the \n\ndiscount rate. Annualized costs are estimated to range from $133 \n\nmillion to $366 million. Benefits: As set forth in section 711 of the \n\n9/11 Act, it was the intent of Congress to modernize and strengthen the \n\nsecurity of the Visa Waiver Program under section 217 of the \n\nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187) by simultaneously \n\nenhancing program security requirements and extending visa-free travel \n\nprivileges to citizens and eligible nationals of eligible foreign \n\ncountries that are partners in the war on terrorism. By requiring \n\npassenger data in advance of travel, CBP may be able to determine, \n\nbefore the alien departs for the United States, the eligibility of \n\ncitizens and eligible nationals from VWP countries to travel to the \n\nUnited States under the VWP, and whether such travel poses a law \n\nenforcement or security risk. In addition to fulfilling a statutory \n\nmandate, the rule serves the twin goals of promoting border security \n\nand legitimate travel to the United States. By modernizing the VWP, \n\nESTA is intended to both increase national security and provide for \n\ngreater efficiencies in the screening of international travelers by \n\nallowing for the screening of subjects of potential interest well \n\nbefore boarding, thereby reducing traveler delays based on potentially \n\nlengthy processes at U.S. ports of entry. CBP concluded that the total \n\nbenefits to travelers could total $1.1 billion to $3.3 billion over the \n\nperiod of analysis. Annualized benefits could range from $134 million \n\nto $345 million. In addition to these benefits to travelers, CBP and \n\nthe carriers should also experience the benefit of not having to \n\nadminister the I-94W except in limited situations. While CBP has not \n\nconducted an analysis of the potential savings, it should accrue \n\nbenefits from not having to produce, ship, and store blank forms. CBP \n\nshould also be able to accrue savings related to data entry and \n\narchiving. Carriers should realize some savings as well, though \n\ncarriers will still have to administer the Customs Declaration forms \n\nfor all passengers aboard the aircraft and vessel.\n\n\n\n Risks:\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInterim Final Action................ 06/09/08 73 FR 32440\n\nInterim Final Rule Effective........ 08/08/08 .......................\n\nInterim Final Rule Comment Period 08/08/08 .......................\n\n End.\n\nNotice_Announcing Date Rule Becomes 11/13/08 73 FR 67354\n\n Mandatory.\n\nFinal Action........................ 03/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n International Impacts: This regulatory action will be likely to \n\nhave international trade and investment effects, or otherwise be of \n\ninternational interest.\n\n Additional Information: http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/id_visa/esta/.\n\n URL For More Information:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL For Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Suzanne Shepherd, Director, Electronic System for \n\nTravel Authorization, Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and \n\nBorder Protection, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20229, \n\nPhone: 202 344-2073, Email: suzanne.m.shepherd@cbp.dhs.gov\n\n Related RIN: Related to 1651-AA83\n\n RIN: 1651-AA72\n\nDHS--USCBP\n\n84.

This law extends the immigration \n\nlaws of the United States to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n\nIslands (CNMI) and provides for a joint visa waiver program for travel \n\nto Guam and the CNMI. This rule implements section 702 of the CNRA by \n\namending the regulations to replace the current Guam Visa Waiver \n\nProgram with a new Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program. The amended \n\nregulations set forth the requirements for nonimmigrant visitors who \n\nseek admission for business or pleasure and solely for entry into and \n\nstay on Guam or the CNMI without a visa. This rule also establishes six \n\nports of entry in the CNMI for purposes of administering and enforcing \n\nthe Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program. Section 702 of the Consolidated \n\nNatural Resources Act of 2008 (CNRA), subject to a transition period, \n\nextends the immigration laws of the United States to the Commonwealth \n\nof the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) and provides for a visa waiver \n\nprogram for travel to Guam and/or the CNMI. On January 16, 2009, the \n\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS), Customs and Border Protection \n\n(CBP), issued an interim final rule in the Federal Register replacing \n\nthe then-existing Guam Visa Waiver Program with the Guam-CNMI Visa \n\nWaiver Program and setting forth the requirements for nonimmigrant \n\nvisitors seeking admission into Guam and/or the CNMI under the Guam-\n\nCNMI Visa Waiver Program. As of November 28, 2009, the Guam-CNMI Visa \n\nWaiver Program is operational. This program allows nonimmigrant \n\nvisitors from eligible countries to seek admission for business or \n\npleasure for entry into Guam and/or the CNMI without a visa for a \n\nperiod of authorized stay not to exceed 45 days. This rulemaking would \n\nfinalize the January 2009 interim final rule.\n\n Statement of Need: Previously, aliens who were citizens of eligible \n\ncountries could apply for admission to Guam at a Guam port of entry as \n\nnonimmigrant visitors for a period of 15 days or less, for business or \n\npleasure, without first obtaining a nonimmigrant visa, provided that \n\nthey are otherwise eligible for admission. Section 702(b) of the CNRA \n\nsupersedes the Guam visa waiver program by providing for a visa waiver \n\nprogram for Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands \n\n(Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program). Section 702(b) required DHS to \n\npromulgate regulations within 180 days of enactment of the CNRA to \n\n\n\nallow nonimmigrant visitors from eligible countries to apply for \n\nadmission into Guam and the CNMI, for business or pleasure, without a \n\nvisa, for a period of authorized stay of no longer than 45 days. Under \n\nthe interim final rule, a visitor seeking admission under the Guam-CNMI \n\nVisa Waiver Program must be a national of an eligible country and must \n\nmeet the requirements enumerated in the current Guam visa waiver \n\nprogram as well as additional requirements that bring the Guam-CNMI \n\nVisa Waiver Program into soft alignment with the U.S. Visa Waiver \n\nProgram provided for in 8 CFR 217. The country eligibility requirements \n\ntake into account the intent of the CNRA and ensure that the \n\nregulations meet current border security needs. The country eligibility \n\nrequirements are designed to: (1) ensure effective border control \n\nprocedures, (2) properly address national security and homeland \n\nsecurity concerns in extending U.S. immigration law to the CNMI, and \n\n(3) maximize the CNMI's potential for future economic and business \n\ngrowth. This interim rule also provided that visitors from the People's \n\nRepublic of China and Russia have provided a significant economic \n\nbenefit to the CNMI. However, nationals from those countries cannot, at \n\nthis time, seek admission under the Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program due \n\nto security concerns. Pursuant to section 702(a) of the CNRA, which \n\nextends the immigration laws of the United States to the CNMI, this \n\nrule also establishes six ports of entry in the CNMI to enable the \n\nSecretary of Homeland Security (the Secretary) to administer and \n\nenforce the Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program is based \n\non congressional authority provided under 702(b) of the Consolidated \n\nNatural Resources Act of 2008 (CNRA).\n\n Alternatives: None.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: CBP is currently evaluating the \n\ncosts and benefits associated with finalizing the interim final rule. \n\nThe most significant change for admission to the CNMI as a result of \n\nthe rule was for visitors from those countries who are not included in \n\neither the existing U.S. Visa Waiver Program or the Guam-CNMI Visa \n\nWaiver Program established by the rule. These visitors must apply for \n\nU.S. visas, which require in-person interviews at U.S. embassies or \n\nconsulates and higher fees than the CNMI assessed for its visitor entry \n\npermits. These are losses associated with the reduced visits from \n\nforeign travelers who no longer visited the CNMI upon implementation of \n\n\n\nthis rule. The anticipated benefits of the rule were enhanced security \n\nthat would result from the federalization of the immigration functions \n\nin the CNMI.\n\n Risks: No risks.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInterim Final Rule.................. 01/16/09 74 FR 2824\n\nInterim Final Rule Effective........ 01/16/09 .......................\n\nInterim Final Rule Comment Period 03/17/09 .......................\n\n End.\n\nTechnical Amendment; Change of 05/28/09 74 FR 25387\n\n Implementation Date.\n\nFinal Action........................ 08/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n International Impacts: This regulatory action will be likely to \n\nhave international trade and investment effects, or otherwise be of \n\ninternational interest.\n\n URL for More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL for Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Paul Minton, CBP Officer (Program Manager), \n\nDepartment of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, \n\n1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20229, Phone: 202 344-\n\n2723, Email: paul.a.minton@cbp.dhs.gov\n\n Related RIN: Related to 1651-AA81\n\n RIN: 1651-AA77\n\nDHS--USCBP\n\n85. Definition of Form I-94 To Include Electronic Format.\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 8 U.S.C. 1101; 8 U.S.C. 1103; 8 U.S.C. 1201; 8 \n\nU.S.C. 1301; 8 U.S.C. 1303 to 1305; 5 U.S.C. 301; Pub.

The \n\nForm I-94 is used to document arrival and departure and provides \n\nevidence of the terms of admission or parole. CBP is transitioning to \n\nan automated process whereby it will create a Form I-94 in an \n\nelectronic format based on passenger, passport, and visa information \n\ncurrently obtained electronically from air and sea carriers and the \n\nDepartment of State as well as through the inspection process. Prior to \n\nthis rule, the Form I-94 was\n\n[[Page 76550]]\n\nsolely a paper form that was completed by the alien upon arrival. After \n\nthe implementation of the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS) \n\nfollowing 9/11, CBP began collecting information on aliens traveling by \n\nair or sea to the United States electronically from carriers in advance \n\nof arrival. For aliens arriving in the United States by air or sea, CBP \n\nobtains almost all of the information contained on the paper Form I-94 \n\nelectronically and in advance via APIS. The few fields on the Form I-94 \n\nthat are not collected via APIS are either already collected by the \n\nDepartment of State and transmitted to CBP or can be collected by the \n\nCBP officer from the individual at the time of inspection. This means \n\nthat CBP no longer needs to collect Form I-94 information as a matter \n\nof course directly from aliens traveling to the United States by air or \n\nsea. At this time, the automated process will apply only to aliens \n\narriving at air and sea ports of entry.\n\n Statement of Need: This rule makes the necessary changes to the \n\nregulations to enable CBP to transition to an automated process whereby \n\nCBP will create an electronic Form I-94 based on the information in its \n\ndatabases.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Section 103(a) of the Immigration and \n\nNationality Act (INA) generally authorizes the Secretary of Homeland \n\nSecurity to establish such regulations and prescribe such forms of \n\nreports, entries, and other papers necessary to carry out his or her \n\nauthority to administer and enforce the immigration and nationality \n\nlaws and to guard the borders of the United States against illegal \n\nentry of aliens.\n\n Alternatives: CBP considered two alternatives to this rule: \n\neliminating the paper Form I-94 in the air and sea environments \n\nentirely and providing the paper Form I-94 to all travelers who are not \n\n\n\nB-1/B-2 travelers. Eliminating the paper Form I-94 option for refugees, \n\napplicants for asylum, parolees, and those travelers who request one \n\nwould not result in a significant cost savings to CBP and would harm \n\ntravelers who have an immediate need for an electronic Form I-94 or who \n\nface obstacles to accessing their electronic Form I-94. A second \n\nalternative to the rule is to provide a paper Form I-94 to any \n\ntravelers who are not B-1/B-2 travelers. Under this alternative, \n\ntravelers would receive and complete the paper Form I- 94 during their \n\ninspection when they arrive in the United States. The electronic Form \n\nI-94 would still be automatically created during the inspection, but \n\nthe CBP officer would need to verify that the information appearing on \n\nthe form matches the information in CBP's systems. In addition, CBP \n\nwould need to write the Form I-94 number on each paper Form I-94 so \n\nthat their paper form matches the electronic record. As noted in the \n\nanalysis, 25.1 percent of aliens are non-B-1/B-2 travelers. Filling out \n\nand processing this many paper Forms I-94 at airports and seaports \n\nwould increase processing times considerably. At the same time, it \n\nwould only provide a small savings to the individual traveler.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: With the implementation of this \n\nrule, CBP will no longer collect Form I-94 information as a matter of \n\ncourse directly from aliens traveling to the United States by air or \n\nsea. Instead, CBP will create an electronic Form I-94 for foreign \n\ntravelers based on the information in its databases. This rule makes \n\nthe necessary changes to the regulations to enable CBP to transition to \n\nan automated process. Both CBP and aliens would bear costs as a result \n\nof this rule. CBP would bear costs to link its data systems and to \n\nbuild a Web site so aliens can access their electronic Forms I-94. CBP \n\nestimates that the total cost for CBP to link data systems, develop a \n\nsecure Web site, and fully automate the Form I-94 fully will equal \n\nabout $1.3 million in calendar year 2012. CBP will incur costs of $0.09 \n\nmillion in subsequent years to operate and maintain these systems. \n\nAliens arriving as diplomats and students would bear costs when logging \n\ninto the Web site and printing electronic I-94s. The temporary workers \n\nand aliens in the ''Other/Unknown'' category bear costs when logging \n\ninto the Web site, traveling to a location with public internet access, \n\nand printing a paper copy of their electronic Form I-94. Using the \n\nprimary estimate for a traveler's value of time, aliens would bear \n\ncosts between $36.6 million and $46.4 million from 2013 to 2016. Total \n\n\n\ncosts for this rule for 2013 would range from $34.2 million to $40.1 \n\nmillion, with a primary estimate of costs equal to $36.7 million. CBP, \n\ncarriers, and foreign travelers would accrue benefits as a result of \n\nthis rule. CBP would save contract and printing costs of $15.6 million \n\nper year of our analysis. Carriers would save a total of $1.3 million \n\nin printing costs per year. All aliens would save the eight-minute time \n\nburden for filling out the paper Form I-94 and certain aliens who lose \n\nthe Form I-94 would save the $330 fee and 25-minute time burden for \n\nfilling out the Form I-102. Using the primary estimate for a traveler's \n\nvalue of time, aliens would obtain benefits between $112.6 million and \n\n$141.6 million from 2013 to 2016. Total benefits for this rule for 2013 \n\nwould range from $110.7 million to $155.6 million, with a primary \n\nestimate of benefits equal to $129.5 million. Overall, this rule \n\nresults in substantial cost savings (benefits) for foreign travelers, \n\ncarriers, and CBP. CBP anticipates a net benefit in 2013 of between \n\n$59.7 million and $98.7 million for foreign travelers, $1.3 million for \n\ncarriers, and $15.5 million for CBP. Net benefits to U.S. entities \n\n(carriers and CBP) in 2013 total $16.8 million. CBP anticipates the \n\ntotal net benefits to both domestic and foreign entities in 2013 range \n\nfrom $76.5 million to $115.5 million. In our primary analysis, the \n\ntotal net benefits are $92.8 million in 2013. For the primary estimate, \n\nannualized net benefits range from $78.1 million to $80.0 million, \n\ndepending on the discount rate used. More information on costs and \n\nbenefits can be found in the interim final rule.\n\n Risks: N/A.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInterim Final Rule.................. 03/27/13 78 FR 18457\n\nInterim Final Rule Comment Period 04/26/13\n\n End.\n\nInterim Final Rule Effective........ 04/26/13\n\nFinal Action........................ 03/00/15\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n International Impacts: This regulatory action will be likely to \n\nhave international trade and investment effects, or otherwise be of \n\n\n\ninternational interest.\n\n Additional Information: Includes Retrospective Review under E.O. \n\n13563.\n\n URL for More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL for Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Suzanne Shepherd, Director, Electronic System for \n\nTravel Authorization, Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and \n\nBorder Protection, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20229, \n\nPhone: 202 344-2073, Email: suzanne.m.shepherd@cbp.dhs.gov\n\n RIN: 1651-AA96\n\n[[Page 76551]]\n\nDHS--TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION (TSA)\n\nProposed Rule Stage\n\n86.

As part \n\nof its notice of proposed rulemaking, TSA will seek public comment on \n\nthe alternative ways in which the final rule could carry out the \n\nrequirements of the statute.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits:, TSA is in the process of \n\ndetermining the costs and benefits of this rulemaking.\n\n Risks:, The Department of Homeland Security aims to prevent \n\nterrorist attacks within the United States and to reduce the \n\nvulnerability of the United States to terrorism. By providing for \n\nsecurity training for personnel, TSA intends in this rulemaking to \n\nreduce the risk of a terrorist attack on this transportation sector.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 10/00/15\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n\n\n Government Levels Affected: Local.\n\n URL For Public Comments: www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Chandru (Jack) Kalro, Deputy Director, Surface \n\nDivision, Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security \n\nAdministration, Office of Security Policy and Industry Engagement, 601 \n\nSouth 12th Street, Arlington, VA 20598-6028, Phone: 571 227-1145, Fax: \n\n571 227-2935, Email: jack.kalro@tsa.dhs.gov\n\n Monica Grasso Ph.D., Manager, Economic Analysis Branch-Cross Modal \n\nDivision, Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security \n\nAdministration, Office of Security Policy and Industry Engagement, 601 \n\nSouth 12th Street, Arlington, VA 20598-6028, Phone: 571 227-3329, \n\nEmail: monica.grasso@tsa.dhs.gov\n\n David Kasminoff, Senior Counsel, Regulations and Security Standards \n\nDivision, Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security \n\nAdministration, Office of the Chief Counsel, 601 South 12th Street, \n\nArlington, VA 20598-6002, Phone: 571 227-3583, Fax: 571 227-1378, \n\nEmail: david.kasminoff@tsa.dhs.gov\n\n Related RIN:, Related to 1652-AA56, Merged with 1652-AA57, Merged \n\nwith 1652-AA59\n\n RIN: 1652-AA55\n\nDHS--TSA\n\n87.

The \n\nscope of the rulemaking will include transportation workers who are \n\nrequired to undergo an STA, including surface, maritime, and aviation \n\nworkers. TSA will propose fees to cover the cost of all STAs. TSA plans \n\nto improve efficiencies in processing STAs and streamline existing \n\nregulations by simplifying language and removing redundancies. As part \n\nof this proposed interim final rule (IFR), TSA will propose revisions \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nmailto:jack.kalro@tsa.dhs.gov\nmailto:monica.grasso@tsa.dhs.gov\nmailto:david.kasminoff@tsa.dhs.gov\n\n\nto the Alien Flight Student Program (AFSP) regulations. TSA published \n\nan interim final rule for AFSP on September 20, 2004. TSA regulations \n\nrequire aliens seeking to train at Federal Aviation Administration-\n\nregulated flight schools to complete an application and undergo an STA \n\nprior to beginning flight training. There are four categories under \n\nwhich students currently fall; the nature of the STA depends on the \n\nstudent's category. TSA is considering changes to the AFSP that would \n\nimprove the equity among fee payers and enable the implementation of \n\nnew technologies to support vetting.\n\n Statement of Need: TSA proposes to meet the requirements of 6 \n\nU.S.C. 469, which requires TSA to fund security threat assessment and \n\ncredentialing activities through user fees. The proposed rulemaking \n\nshould reduce reliance on appropriations for certain vetting services; \n\nminimize redundant background checks; and increase transportation \n\nsecurity by enhancing identification and immigration verification \n\nstandards.\n\n[[Page 76552]]\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: 49 U.S.C. 114(f): Under the Aviation and \n\nTransportation Security Act (ATSA) (Pub. L. 170-71, Nov. 19, 2001, 115 \n\nStat. 597), TSA assumed responsibility to assess security in all modes \n\nof transportation and minimize threats to national and transportation \n\nsecurity. TSA is required to vet certain aviation workers pursuant to \n\n49 U.S.C. 44903 and 44936. TSA is required to vet individuals with \n\nunescorted access to maritime facilities pursuant to the Maritime \n\nTransportation Security Act (MTSA) (Pub. L. 107-295, sec. 102, Nov. 25, \n\n2002, 116 Stat. 2064), codified at 46 U.S.C. 70105. Pursuant to the \n\nUniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools \n\nRequired to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA PATRIOT Act) \n\n(Pub. L. 107-56, Oct. 25, 2001, 115 Stat. 272), TSA vets individuals \n\nseeking hazardous materials endorsements (HME) for commercial drivers \n\nlicensed by the States. In 6 U.S.C. 469, Congress directed TSA to fund \n\nvetting and credentialing programs in the field of transportation \n\nthrough user fees.\n\n Alternatives: TSA considered a number of viable alternatives to the \n\nproposed regulation. These alternatives are discussed in detail in the \n\nproposed rule and regulatory impact analysis.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: TSA is in the process determining \n\nthe costs and benefits of this proposed rulemaking.\n\n Risks:\n\n Timetable:\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 08/00/15\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Undetermined.\n\n Federalism: Undetermined.\n\n Additional Information: Includes Retrospective Review under \n\nExecutive Order 13563.\n\n URL for More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL for Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Chang Ellison, Branch Manager, Program Initiatives \n\nBranch, Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security \n\nAdministration, Office of Intelligence and Analysis, TSA-10, HQ E6, 601 \n\nSouth 12th Street, Arlington, VA 20598-6010, Phone: 571 227-3604, \n\nEmail: chang.ellison@tsa.dhs.gov\n\n Monica Grasso Ph.D., Manager, Economic Analysis Branch-Cross Modal \n\nDivision, Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security \n\nAdministration, Office of Security Policy and Industry Engagement, 601 \n\nSouth 12th Street, Arlington, VA 20598-6028, Phone: 571 227-3329, \n\nEmail: monica.grasso@tsa.dhs.gov\n\n John Vergelli, Senior Counsel, Regulations and Security Standards \n\nDivision, Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security \n\nAdministration, Office of the Chief Counsel, 601 South 12th Street, \n\nArlington, VA 20598-6002, Phone: 571 227-4416, Fax: 571 227-1378, \n\nEmail: john.vergelli@tsa.dhs.gov\n\n Related RIN: Related to 1652-AA35\n\n RIN: 1652-AA61\n\nDHS--TSA\n\nFinal Rule Stage\n\n88.

The notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was \n\npublished on March 26, 2012, to comply with the decision rendered by \n\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in \n\nElectronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) v. U.S. Department of \n\nHomeland Security on July 15, 2011. 653 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2011). The \n\nCourt directed TSA to conduct notice and comment rulemaking on the use \n\nof AIT in the primary screening of passengers.\n\n Statement of Need: TSA is issuing this rulemaking to respond to the \n\ndecision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \n\nCircuit in EPIC v. DHS 653 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: In its decision in EPIC v. DHS 653 F.3d 1 \n\n(D.C. Cir. 2011), the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \n\nCircuit found that TSA failed to justify its failure to conduct notice \n\nand comment rulemaking and remanded to TSA for further proceedings.\n\n Alternatives: As alternatives to the preferred regulatory proposal \n\npresented in the NPRM, TSA examined three other options. These \n\nalternatives include a continuation of the screening environment prior \n\nto 2008 (no action), increased use of physical pat-down searches that \n\nsupplements primary screening with walk through metal detectors \n\n(WTMDs), and increased use of explosive trace detection (ETD) screening \n\nthat supplements primary screening with WTMDs. These alternatives, and \n\nthe reasons why TSA rejected them in favor of the proposed rule, are \n\ndiscussed in detail in chapter 3 of the AIT NPRM regulatory evaluation.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: TSA reports that the net cost of AIT \n\ndeployment from 2008-2011 has been $841.2 million (undiscounted) and \n\nthat TSA has borne over 99 percent of all costs related to AIT \n\ndeployment. TSA projects that from 2012-2015 net AIT related costs will \n\nbe approximately $1.5 billion (undiscounted), $1.4 billion at a three \n\npercent discount rate, and $1.3 billion at a seven percent discount \n\nrate. During 2012-2015, TSA estimates it will also incur over 98 \n\npercent of AIT-related costs with equipment and personnel costs being \n\nthe largest categories of expenditures. The operations described in \n\nthis rule produce benefits by reducing security risks through the \n\ndeployment of AIT that is capable of detecting both metallic and non-\n\nmetallic weapons and explosives. Terrorists continue to test security \n\nmeasures in an attempt to find and exploit vulnerabilities. The threat \n\nto aviation security has evolved to include the use of non-metallic \n\nexplosives. AIT is a proven technology based on laboratory testing and \n\nfield experience and is an essential component of TSA's security \n\n\n\nscreening because it provides the best opportunity to detect metallic \n\nand nonmetallic anomalies concealed under clothing. More information \n\nabout costs and benefits can be found in the Notice of Proposed \n\nRulemaking.\n\n Risks: DHS aims to prevent terrorist attacks and to reduce the \n\nvulnerability of the United States to terrorism. By screening \n\npassengers with AIT, TSA will reduce the risk that a terrorist will \n\nsmuggle a non-metallic threat on board an aircraft.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 03/26/13 78 FR 18287\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 06/24/13 .......................\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 07/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n URL for Public Comments: www.regulations.gov.\n\n[[Page 76553]]\n\n Agency Contact: Chawanna Carrington, Project Manager, Passenger \n\nScreening Program, Department of Homeland Security, Transportation \n\nSecurity Administration, Office of Security Capabilities, 601 South \n\n12th Street, Arlington, VA 20598-6016, Phone: 571 227-2958, Fax: 571 \n\n227-1931, Email: chawanna.carrington@tsa.dhs.gov\n\n Monica Grasso Ph.D., Manager, Economic Analysis Branch-Cross Modal \n\nDivision, Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security \n\nAdministration, Office of Security Policy and Industry Engagement, 601 \n\nSouth 12th Street, Arlington, VA 20598-6028, Phone: 571 227-3329, \n\nEmail: monica.grasso@tsa.dhs.gov\n\n Linda L.

Current regulation limits the \n\nnumber of DSOs to 10 per school, or 10 per campus in a multi-campus \n\nschool. Second, as proposed, the rule would permit F-2 and M-2 spouses \n\nand children accompanying academic and vocational nonimmigrant students \n\nwith F-1 or M-1 nonimmigrant status to enroll in study at an SEVP-\n\ncertified school so long as any study remains less than a full course \n\nof study.\n\n Statement of Need: The rule would improve management of \n\ninternational student programs and increase opportunities for study by \n\nspouses and children of nonimmigrant students. The rule would grant \n\nschool officials more flexibility in determining the number of \n\ndesignated school officials (DSOs) to nominate for the oversight of \n\ncampuses. The rule would also provide greater incentive for \n\ninternational students to study in the United States by permitting \n\naccompanying spouses and children of academic and vocational \n\nnonimmigrant students with F-1 or M-1 nonimmigrant status to enroll in \n\nless than a full course of study at an SEVP-certified school.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis:\n\n Alternatives:\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The anticipated costs of the rule \n\nderive from the existing requirement for reporting to DHS additional \n\nDSOs and any training that new DSOs would undertake. The primary \n\nbenefits of the NPRM are providing flexibility to schools in the number \n\nof DSOs allowed and providing greater incentive for international \n\nstudents to study in the United States by permitting accompanying \n\nspouses and children of academic and vocational nonimmigrant students \n\n\n\nin F-1 or M-1 status to enroll in study at an SEVP-certified school so \n\nlong as they are not engaged in a full course of study.\n\n Risks:\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 11/21/13 78 FR 69778\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 01/21/14 .......................\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 02/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n International Impacts: This regulatory action will be likely to \n\nhave international trade and investment effects, or otherwise be of \n\ninternational interest.\n\n URL for More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL for Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Katherine H.

As described by Secretary Castro during his confirmation \n\nhearings, HUD is a critical federal agency because it directly impacts \n\nAmerican families, from enforcing fair housing rights to revitalizing \n\ndistressed areas, from assisting veterans and finding permanent \n\nhousing, to helping communities rebuild after a natural disaster hits, \n\nHUD impacts small towns, big cities, rural communities and tribal \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nmailto:katherine.h.westerlund@ice.dhs.gov\n\n\ncommunities across the country.\\1\\ Through its programs, HUD works to \n\nstrengthen the housing market and protect consumers; meet the need for \n\nquality affordable rental homes; utilize housing as a platform for \n\nimproving quality of life; and build inclusive and sustainable \n\ncommunities free from discrimination.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\1\\ Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee \n\nConfirmation Hearing on the Nomination of Julian Castro to be \n\nHousing and Urban Development Secretary and Laura S. Wertheimer to \n\nbe the Federal Housing Finance Agency Inspector General, 113th Cong. \n\n(June 17, 2014) (Statement of Juli[aacute]n Castro).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n As discussed in HUD's 2010-2015, Strategic Plan, a central feature \n\nof HUD's mission is nurturing opportunities for job growth and business \n\nexpansion in American communities, particularly those that are \n\neconomically distressed. HUD's experience is that job growth and \n\nbusiness expansion are essential to creating viable communities that \n\nprovide residents opportunities that enhance their quality of life. \n\nEconomic development, however, must be tailored to the assets and needs \n\nof the community in a way that maintains and enhances affordability and \n\nlocal character. HUD utilizes several tools to achieve this goal, \n\nincluding the providing tax incentives and Federal financial assistance \n\nthat assist communities to carry out a wide range of community \n\ndevelopment activities directed toward neighborhood revitalization, \n\neconomic development, and improved community facilities and services. \n\nAnother tool that HUD has to support job growth and economic activity \n\nis Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, as \n\namended, which ensures that\n\n[[Page 76554]]\n\nemployment and other economic opportunities generated by Federal \n\nfinancial assistance for housing and community development programs \n\nare, to the greatest extent feasible, directed toward low- and very \n\nlow-income persons, particularly those who are recipients of government \n\nassistance for housing.\n\n Consistent with its 2010-2015 Strategic Plan, HUD's Regulatory Plan \n\nfor FY2015 focuses on strengthening, through regulation, Section 3 to \n\nupdate and better align it with the statutory changes to HUD's housing \n\nand community development programs since HUD issued the regulation in \n\n1994. This effort will also provide recipients of HUD financial \n\nassistance more discretion when carrying out their Section 3 \n\n\n\nresponsibilities while simultaneously increasing their accountability \n\nto HUD and the communities that they serve.\n\nPriority: Enhancing Economic Development and Job Creation Through \n\nSection 3\n\n The purpose of Section 3 is to ensure that the employment and other \n\neconomic opportunities generated by Federal financial assistance, to \n\nthe greatest extent feasible, be directed to low-and very low-income \n\npersons, particularly those who are recipients of government assistance \n\nfor housing. In this regard, the statute recognizes that the employment \n\nand other economic opportunities generated by projects and activities \n\nthat receive Federal housing and community development assistance offer \n\nan effective means of empowering low- and very low-income persons and \n\nto business concerns that provide economic opportunities to these \n\npersons. Notwithstanding, HUD's Section 3 regulations have not been \n\nupdated since 1994. In the 20 years that have passed since HUD \n\npromulgated its Section 3 regulations, significant legislation has been \n\nenacted that affects HUD programs that are subject Section 3. These \n\nlegislative changes are not adequately addressed by HUD's current \n\nSection 3 regulations.\n\n In addition, recipients of Section 3 covered HUD financial \n\nassistance, community advocates, representatives from national housing \n\norganizations, Section 3 residents and businesses, and other interested \n\nparties have expressed, in HUD's organized listening sessions, that the \n\nexisting regulations are not sufficiently explicit about specific \n\nactions that could be undertaken to achieve compliance; that the \n\nexisting regulations do not clearly describe the extent to which \n\nrecipients may require subrecipients, contractors, and subcontractors \n\nto comply with Section 3; and actions that recipients may take to \n\nimpose meaningful sanctions for noncompliance by their subrecipients, \n\ncontractors, and subcontractors. Finally, HUD's Office of Inspector \n\nGeneral (OIG) conducted an audit in 2013 to assess HUD's oversight of \n\nSection 3 in response to concerns about economic opportunities that \n\nwere provided (or should have been provided) as a result of the \n\nexpenditure of financial assistance under the American Reinvestment and \n\nRecovery Act (Recovery Act) (Public Law 111-5, approved February 17, \n\n2009).\n\n As a result, HUD proposes to update and clarify its Section 3 \n\nregulations to better fulfill the purpose of Section 3 and maximize the \n\nemployment and contracting opportunities available to the low and very \n\nlow-income residents of communities enjoying the benefit of Federal \n\nfinancial assistance in support of economic development and to business \n\n\n\nconcerns that provide economic opportunities to these persons.\n\nRegulatory Action: Creating Economic Opportunities for Low- and Very \n\nLow-Income Persons and Eligible Businesses Through Strengthened \n\n``Section 3'' Requirements\n\n Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, as \n\namended by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, \n\ncontributes to the establishment of stronger, more sustainable \n\ncommunities by ensuring that employment and other economic \n\nopportunities generated by Federal financial assistance for housing and \n\ncommunity development programs are, to the greatest extent feasible, \n\ndirected toward low- and very low-income persons, particularly those \n\nwho are recipients of government assistance for housing and to business \n\nconcerns that provide economic opportunities to these persons. HUD is \n\nstatutorily charged with the authority and responsibility to implement \n\nand enforce Section 3. HUD's regulations implementing the requirements \n\nof Section 3 have not been updated since 1994. This proposed rule would \n\nupdate HUD's Section 3 regulations to address new programs established \n\nsince 1994 that are subject to the Section 3 requirements, and revise \n\nthe regulations to both better promote compliance with the requirements \n\nof Section 3 by recipients of Section 3 covered financial assistance, \n\nwhile also recognizing barriers to compliance that may exist, and \n\noverall strengthening HUD's oversight of Section 3.\n\nAggregate Costs and Benefits\n\n Executive Order 12866, as amended, requires the agency to provide \n\nits best estimate of the combined aggregate costs and benefits of all \n\nregulations included in the agency's Regulatory Plan that will be made \n\neffective in calendar year 2015. HUD expects that the neither the total \n\neconomic costs nor the total efficiency gains will exceed $100 million.\n\nPriority Regulations in HUD's FY 2015 Regulatory Plan\n\nHUD--OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY\n\nProposed Rule Stage\n\nCreating Economic Opportunities for Low- and Very Low-Income Persons \n\nand Eligible Businesses Through Strengthened ``Section 3'' Requirements\n\n Priority: Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 12 U.S.C. 1701u; 42 U.S.C. 1450; 42 U.S.C. 3301; \n\n42 U.S.C. 3535(d).\n\n CFR Citation: 24 CFR 135.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: This proposed rule would revise HUD's regulations found \n\n\n\nat 24 CFR part 135, which ensure that employment, training, and \n\ncontracting opportunities generated by certain HUD financial assistance \n\nshall, to the greatest extent feasible, and consistent with existing \n\nFederal, State, and local laws and regulations, be directed to low- and \n\nvery low-income persons, particularly those who are recipients of \n\nGovernment assistance for housing and to business concerns that provide \n\neconomic opportunities to these persons. Part 135 was last revised to \n\nincorporate the statutory amendments of the Housing and Community \n\nDevelopment Act of 1992.

Section 3 recognizes that \n\nHUD funds are often one of the largest sources of funds expended in \n\nlow-income communities and, where such funds are spent on activities \n\nsuch as construction and rehabilitation of housing and other public \n\nfacilities, the expenditure results in new jobs and other \n\nopportunities. By directing new economic opportunities to residents and \n\nbusinesses in the community in which the funds are expended, the \n\nexpenditure can have the double benefit of creating new or \n\nrehabilitated housing or other facilities in such communities while \n\nalso creating jobs for the residents of these communities. Section 3 \n\nwas amended by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 \n\n(Public Law 102-550, approved October 28, 1992), which required the \n\nSecretary of HUD to promulgate regulations to implement Section 3, \n\ncodified at 12 U.S.C. 1701u. HUD's Section 3 regulations were \n\npromulgated through an interim rule published on June 30, 1994, at 59 \n\nFR 33880, and are codified in 24 CFR part 135. This proposed rule would \n\nupdate HUD's Section 3 regulations to address new programs established \n\nsince 1994 that are subject to the Section 3 requirements, and revise \n\nthe regulations to both better promote compliance with the requirements \n\nof Section 3 by recipients of Section 3 covered financial assistance, \n\nwhile also recognizing barriers to compliance that may exist, and \n\noverall strengthening HUD's oversight of Section 3.\n\n Alternatives: Efforts have been made to improve HUD's Section 3 \n\nefforts independent of regulatory change, by increased reporting \n\ncompliance, use of Notices of Financial Assistance (NOFA) competitions \n\nfor Section 3 coordinators, and a business registry.

DOI serves as trustee to Native Americans and \n\nAlaska native trust assets and is responsible for relations with the \n\nisland territories under United States jurisdiction. The Department \n\nmanages more than 500 million acres of Federal lands, including 401 \n\npark units, 560 wildlife refuges, and approximately 1.7 billion \n\nsubmerged offshore acres. These areas include natural resources that \n\nare essential for America's industry--oil and gas, coal, and minerals \n\nsuch as gold and uranium. On public lands and the Outer Continental \n\nShelf, Interior provides access for renewable and conventional energy \n\ndevelopment and manages the protection and restoration of surface-mined \n\nlands.\n\n The Department protects and recovers endangered species; protects \n\nnatural, historic, and cultural resources; manages water projects that \n\nare a lifeline and economic engine for many communities in the West; \n\nmanages forests and fights wildfires; manages Federal energy resources; \n\nregulates surface coal mining operations; reclaims abandoned coal \n\nmines; educates children in Indian schools; and provides recreational \n\nopportunities for over 400 million visitors annually in the Nation's \n\nnational parks, public lands, national wildlife refuges, and recreation \n\nareas.\n\n DOI will continue to review and update its regulations and policies \n\nto ensure that they are effective and efficient, and that they promote \n\naccountability and sustainability. DOI will emphasize regulations and \n\npolicies that:\n\n Promote environmentally responsible, safe, and balanced \n\ndevelopment of renewable and conventional energy on our public lands \n\nand the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS);\n\n Use the best available science to ensure that public \n\nresources are protected, conserved, and used wisely;\n\n Preserve America's natural treasures for future \n\ngenerations;\n\n\n\n Improve the nation-to-nation relationship with American \n\nIndian tribes and promote tribal self-determination and self-\n\ngovernance;\n\n Promote partnerships with States, tribes, local \n\ngovernments, other groups, and individuals to achieve common goals; and\n\n Promote transparency, fairness, accountability, and the \n\nhighest ethical standards while maintaining performance goals.\n\nMajor Regulatory Areas\n\n The Department's bureaus implement congressionally mandated \n\nprograms through their regulations. Some of these regulatory programs \n\ninclude:\n\n Developing onshore and offshore energy, including \n\nrenewable, mineral, oil and gas, and other energy resources;\n\n Regulating surface coal mining and reclamation operations \n\non public and private lands;\n\n Managing migratory birds and preserving marine mammals and \n\nendangered species;\n\n Managing dedicated lands, such as national parks, wildlife \n\nrefuges, National Landscape Conservation System lands, and American \n\nIndian trust lands;\n\n Managing public lands open to multiple use;\n\n Managing revenues from American Indian and Federal \n\nminerals;\n\n Fulfilling trust and other responsibilities pertaining to \n\nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives;\n\n Managing natural resource damage assessments; and\n\n Managing assistance programs.\n\nRegulatory Policy\n\n DOI's regulatory programs seek to operate programs transparently, \n\nefficiently, and cooperatively while maximizing protection of our land, \n\nresources, and environment in a fiscally responsible way by:\n\n (1) Protecting Natural, Cultural, and Heritage Resources.\n\n The Department's mission includes protecting and providing access \n\nto our Nation's natural and cultural heritage and honoring our trust \n\nresponsibilities to tribes. We are committed to this mission and to \n\napplying laws and regulations fairly and effectively. Our priorities \n\ninclude protecting public health and safety, restoring and maintaining \n\npublic lands, protecting threatened and endangered species, \n\nameliorating land- and resource-management problems on public lands, \n\nand ensuring accountability and compliance with Federal laws and \n\nregulations.\n\n\n\n (2) Sustainably Using Energy, Water, and Natural Resources.\n\n Since the beginning of the Obama Administration, the Department has \n\nfocused on renewable energy issues and has established priorities for \n\nenvironmentally responsible development of renewable energy on public \n\nlands and the OCS. Industry has responded by investing in the \n\ndevelopment of wind farms off the Atlantic seacoast and solar, wind, \n\nand geothermal energy facilities throughout the West. Power generation \n\nfrom these new energy sources produces virtually no greenhouse gases \n\nand, when done in an environmentally responsible manner, harnesses with \n\nminimum impact abundant renewable energy. The Department will continue \n\nits intra- and inter-departmental efforts to move forward with the \n\nenvironmentally responsible review and permitting of renewable energy \n\nprojects on public lands, and will identify how its regulatory \n\nprocesses can be improved to facilitate the responsible development of \n\nthese resources.\n\n In implementing these priorities through its regulations, the \n\nDepartment will create jobs and contribute to a healthy economy while \n\nprotecting our signature landscapes, natural resources, wildlife, and \n\ncultural resources.\n\n (3) Empowering People and Communities.\n\n The Department strongly encourages public participation in the \n\nregulatory process and will continue to actively engage the public in \n\nthe implementation of priority initiatives. Throughout the Department, \n\nindividual bureaus and offices are ensuring that the American people \n\nhave an active role in managing our Nation's public lands and \n\nresources.\n\n For example, every year FWS establishes migratory bird hunting \n\nseasons in partnership with flyway councils composed of State fish and \n\nwildlife agencies. FWS also holds a series of public meetings to give \n\nother interested parties, including hunters and other groups, \n\nopportunities to participate in establishing the upcoming season's \n\nregulations. Similarly, BLM uses Resource Advisory Councils to advise \n\non management of public lands and resources. These citizen-based groups \n\nallow individuals from all\n\n[[Page 76558]]\n\nbackgrounds and interests to have a voice in management of public \n\nlands.\n\nRetrospective Review of Regulations\n\n President Obama's Executive Order 13563 directs agencies to make \n\nthe regulatory system work better for the American public. Regulations \n\nshould ``. . . protect public health, welfare, safety, and our \n\n\n\nenvironment while promoting economic growth, innovation, \n\ncompetitiveness, and job creation.'' DOI's plan for retrospective \n\nregulatory review identifies specific efforts to relieve regulatory \n\nburdens, add jobs to the economy, and make regulations work better for \n\nthe American public while protecting our environment and resources. The \n\nDOI plan seeks to strengthen and maintain a culture of retrospective \n\nreview by consolidating all regulatory review requirements into DOI's \n\nannual regulatory plan.\n\n The Department routinely meets with stakeholders to solicit \n\nfeedback and gather input on how to incorporate performance based \n\nstandards. DOI has received helpful public input through this process \n\nand will continue to participate in this effort with relevant \n\ninteragency partners as part of its retrospective regulatory review.\n\n Under section 6 of Executive Order 13563 ``Improving Regulation and \n\nRegulatory Review'' (Jan. 18, 2011), the following Regulation \n\nIdentifier Numbers (RINs) were identified as associated with \n\nretrospective review and analysis in the Department's final \n\nretrospective review of regulations plan, which can be viewed at http://www.doi.gov/open/regsreview.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Reduces burdens on small\n\n Bureau Title & RIN Description business?\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOffice of Natural Resources Oil and Gas Royalty DOI is exploring a Yes.\n\n Revenue.

Results include:\n\n Effective stewardship of our Nation's resources in a way \n\nthat is responsive to the needs of small businesses;\n\n Increased benefits per dollar spent by careful evaluation \n\nof the economic effects of planned rules; and\n\n Improved compliance and transparency by use of plain \n\nlanguage in our regulations and guidance documents.\n\nBureaus and Offices Within DOI\n\n The following sections give an overview of some of the major \n\nregulatory priorities of DOI bureaus and offices.\n\nBureau of Indian Affairs\n\n The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) provides services to \n\napproximately 1.9 million Indians and Alaska Natives, and maintains a \n\ngovernment-to-government relationship with the 566 federally recognized \n\nIndian tribes. The Bureau also administers and manages 55 million acres \n\nof surface land and 57 million acres of subsurface minerals held in \n\ntrust by the United States for Indians and Indian tribes. BIA's mission \n\nis to enhance the quality of life, promote economic opportunity, and \n\nprotect and improve the trust assets of American Indians, Indian \n\ntribes, and Alaska Natives, as well as to provide quality education \n\nopportunities to students in Indian schools.\n\n In the coming year, BIA will continue its focus on improved \n\nmanagement of trust responsibilities with each regulatory review and \n\nrevision. The Bureau will also continue to promote economic development \n\nin Indian communities by ensuring the regulations support, rather than \n\nhinder, productive land management.\n\n In addition, BIA will focus on updating Indian education \n\nregulations and on other regulatory changes to increase transparency in \n\nsupport of the President's Open Government Initiative.\n\n In the coming year, BIA's regulatory priorities are to:\n\n Develop regulations to meet the Indian trust reform goals \n\nfor rights-of-ways across Indian land.\n\n Develop regulatory changes necessary for improved Indian \n\neducation.\n\n BIA is reviewing regulations that require the Bureau of Indian \n\nEducation to follow 23 different State adequate yearly progress \n\nstandards; the review will determine whether a uniform standard would \n\n\n\nbetter meet the needs of students at Bureau-funded schools. With regard \n\nto undergraduate education, the Bureau of Indian Education is reviewing \n\nregulations that address grants to tribally controlled community \n\ncolleges and other Indian education regulations. These reviews will \n\nidentify provisions that need to be updated to comply with applicable \n\nstatutes and ensure that the proper regulatory framework is in place to \n\nsupport students in Bureau-funded schools.\n\n Develop regulatory changes to reform the process for \n\nFederal acknowledgment of Indian tribes.\n\n Over the years, BIA has received significant comments from American \n\nIndian groups and members of Congress on the Federal acknowledgment \n\nprocess. Most of these comments criticize the current process as \n\ncumbersome, overly restrictive, and lacking transparency. BIA is \n\nreviewing the Federal acknowledgment regulations to determine how \n\nregulatory changes may streamline the acknowledgment process and \n\nclarify criteria by which an Indian group is examined.\n\n Revise regulations to reflect updated statutory provisions \n\nand increase transparency.\n\n BIA is making a concentrated effort to improve the readability and \n\nprecision of its regulations. Because trust beneficiaries often turn to \n\nthe regulations for guidance on how a given BIA process works, BIA is \n\nensuring that each revised regulation is written as clearly as possible \n\nand accurately reflects the current organization of the Bureau. The \n\nBureau is also simplifying language and eliminating obsolete \n\nprovisions. In the coming year, the Bureau also plans to revise \n\nregulations regarding rights-of-way (25 CFR 169); Indian Reservation \n\nRoads (25 CFR 170); and certain regulations specific to the Osage \n\nNation.\n\nBureau of Land Management\n\n BLM manages the 245-million-acre National System of Public Lands, \n\nlocated primarily in the western States, including Alaska, and the 700-\n\nmillion-acre subsurface mineral estate located throughout the Nation. \n\nIn doing so, BLM manages such varied uses as energy and mineral \n\ndevelopment, outdoor recreation, livestock grazing, and forestry and \n\nwoodlands products. BLM's complex multiple-use mission affects the \n\nlives of millions of Americans, including those who live near and visit \n\nthe public lands, as well as those who benefit from the commodities, \n\nsuch as minerals, energy, or timber, produced from the lands' rich \n\nresources. In undertaking its management responsibilities, BLM seeks to \n\nconserve our public lands' natural and cultural resources and sustain \n\nthe health and productivity of the public lands for the use and \n\nenjoyment of present and future generations. In the coming year, BLM's \n\n\n\nhighest regulatory priorities include:\n\n Revising outdated hydraulic fracturing regulations.\n\n BLM's existing regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing were \n\npromulgated over 20 years ago and do not reflect modern technology. In \n\nseeking to modernize its requirements and ensure the protection of our \n\nNation's public lands, BLM will finalize a rule that will disclose to \n\nthe public chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing on public land and \n\nIndian land, strengthen regulations related to well-bore integrity, and \n\naddress issues related to recovered fluids.\n\n Creating a competitive process for offering lands for \n\nsolar and wind energy development.\n\n BLM recently published a proposed rule that would establish an \n\nefficient competitive process for leasing public lands for solar and \n\nwind energy development. The amended regulations would establish \n\ncompetitive bidding procedures for lands within designated\n\n[[Page 76560]]\n\nsolar and wind energy development leasing areas, define qualifications \n\nfor potential bidders, and structure the financial arrangements \n\nnecessary for the process. The rule would enhance BLM's ability to \n\ncapture fair market value for the use of public lands, ensure fair \n\naccess to leasing opportunities for renewable energy development, and \n\nfoster the growth and development of the renewable energy sector of the \n\neconomy.\n\n Preventing waste of produced gas and ensuring fair return \n\nto the taxpayer.\n\n BLM's current requirements regarding venting and flaring from oil \n\nand gas operations are over three decades old. The agency is currently \n\npreparing a proposed rule to address emissions reductions and minimize \n\nwaste through improved standards for venting, flaring, and fugitive \n\nlosses of methane from oil and gas production facilities on Federal and \n\nIndian lands.\n\n Seeking public input on managing waste mine methane.\n\n BLM issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) \n\nrequesting information from the public that might assist the bureau in \n\nthe establishment of a program to capture, use, or destroy waste mine \n\nmethane from Federal coal leases and Federal leases for other solid \n\nminerals. The BLM is currently reviewing the information received \n\nthrough that process to identify potential appropriate regulatory \n\napproaches to reduce the waste of methane from mining operations on \n\npublic lands.\n\n\n\n Ensuring a fair return to the American taxpayer for oil \n\nshale development.\n\n BLM is preparing a final rule that would ensure responsible \n\ndevelopment of federal oil shale resources and evaluate necessary \n\nsafeguards to protect scarce water resources and important wildlife \n\nhabitat while ensuring a fair royalty to the American people.\n\nBureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM)\n\n The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) promotes energy \n\nindependence, environmental protection, and economic development \n\nthrough responsible, science-based management of offshore conventional \n\nand renewable energy resources. It is dedicated to fostering the \n\ndevelopment of both conventional and renewable energy and mineral \n\nresources on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) in an efficient and \n\neffective manner, balancing the need for economic growth with the \n\nprotection of the environment. BOEM thoughtfully considers and balances \n\nthe potential environmental impacts involved in exploring and \n\nextracting these resources. BOEM's near-term regulatory agenda will \n\nfocus on a number of issues, including:\n\n Expanding renewable energy resources.\n\n As part of President Obama's comprehensive plan to expand domestic \n\nclean energy sources, BOEM has held multiple offshore renewable energy \n\nlease sales along the Atlantic coast. These lease sales are the result \n\nof years of collaboration, data gathering and analysis, and outreach \n\nand have resulted in the identification of areas that are rich with \n\npotential wind resources but also minimize conflicts with other \n\nimportant OCS uses. . Based on the experiences to date in the offshore \n\nrenewable energy program, BOEM is evaluating lessons learned and \n\nidentifying opportunities for improvement in the program. As a part of \n\nthis effort, BOEM is conducting a comprehensive review of our renewable \n\nenergy regulations and highlighting areas for potential revision. For \n\nexample, the Bureau recently completed a rulemaking to provide \n\nadditional time for renewable energy developers to submit certain \n\nplans, after BOEM determined that the previous timelines for submission \n\nwere proving to be unreasonable. This change provides an appropriate \n\nbalance between ensuring diligent progress on our renewable energy \n\nleases and accounting for the needs of the renewable energy development \n\ncommunity.\n\n Two proposed rulemakings address recommendations submitted to BOEM \n\nby the Transportation Research Board of the National Academies and its \n\nstakeholders. Specifically, these include recommendations to: develop \n\nand incorporate state of the art wind turbine design standards and to \n\n\n\nclarify the role of Certified Verification Agents as part of the \n\nprocess of designing, fabricating, and installing offshore wind energy \n\nfacilities for the OCS.\n\n Promoting safe drilling activities on the Arctic Outer \n\nContinental Shelf\n\n BOEM, jointly with the Bureau of Safety and Environmental \n\nEnforcement (BSEE), is developing proposed rules to promote safe, \n\nresponsible, and effective drilling activities on the Alaska Outer \n\nContinental Shelf, while also ensuring the protection of Alaska's \n\ncoastal communities and the marine environment.\n\n Protecting the Environment.\n\n In a continuing effort to ensure that the effects of any future \n\npotential oil spills can be minimized and fully mitigated, BOEM is \n\namending its regulations to raise the limits of liability associated \n\nwith future spills. BOEM has teamed with the U.S. Coast Guard and the \n\nDepartment of Justice in developing new regulations to ensure that \n\nnecessary resources will be made available to address potential \n\ncontingencies of any future oil spill and associated damages.\n\n Updating BOEM's Air Quality Program.\n\n BOEM's original air quality rules date largely from 1980 and have \n\nnot been updated substantially since that time. From 1990 to 2012, DOI \n\nhas exercised jurisdiction for air quality only for OCS sources \n\noperating in the Gulf of Mexico. In fiscal year 2012, Congress expanded \n\nDOI's authority by transferring to it responsibility for monitoring OCS \n\nair quality off the North Slope Borough of the State of Alaska, \n\nincluding the Beaufort Sea, the Chukchi Sea, and part of the Hope \n\nBasin. BOEM is in the process of updating its regulations to reflect \n\nchanges that have occurred over the past thirty-four years and the new \n\nregulatory jurisdiction. In its development of proposed regulations, \n\nBOEM will continue to consult and coordinate its efforts with the U.S. \n\nFish and Wildlife Service, the National Park Service and the \n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n\n Modernizing Oil and Gas Leasing Regulations.\n\n BOEM is developing a final rule to update and streamline the \n\nexisting OCS leasing regulations to better reflect modern policy \n\npriorities, including incentivizing diligent development, as well as to \n\nreflect changes in applicable laws that have occurred over the past \n\nseveral years. The final rule reorganizes leasing requirements to \n\ncommunicate more effectively and clearly the leasing process as it has \n\nevolved, and to better delineate the roles, responsibilities and \n\nassociated liabilities of all parties having an economic interest in \n\n\n\nleases or facilities on the OCS.\n\n Protecting OCS Sand, Gravel, and Shell Resources.\n\n In light of the continuing need to provide resources to protect the \n\ncoast from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy, BOEM is developing \n\npolicies and goals to formally address the use of OCS sand, gravel, or \n\nshell resources funded by the Federal government. These policies are \n\nintended to ensure that necessary sand and gravel resources remain \n\navailable to help communities that have been harmed by hurricanes and \n\nother disasters, so that beaches and other natural resources can \n\neffectively be restored, without adversely impacting the development of \n\ntransmission lines and pipelines needed for energy development \n\nprojects. Taken together, these policies will ensure that the \n\ndevelopment of renewable and\n\n[[Page 76561]]\n\nconventional energy resources continues to take place in areas adjacent \n\nto key sand and gravel resource zones and that sand and gravel \n\nresources continue to be available for construction projects, shore \n\nprotection, beach replenishment, or wetlands restoration purposes.\n\n Promoting Effective Financial Assurance and Risk \n\nManagement.\n\n BOEM has the responsibility to ensure that lessees and operators on \n\nthe OCS do not engage in activities that could generate an undue risk \n\nof financial loss to the government. BOEM formally established a \n\nprogram office to review these issues, and issued an advance notice of \n\nproposed rulemaking seeking feedback on potential regulatory approaches \n\nto promote effective financial assurance and risk management. Agency \n\nstaff will continue to work with industry and others to determine how \n\nto improve the regulatory regime to better align with the realities of \n\naging offshore infrastructure, hazard risks, and increasing costs of \n\ndecommissioning.\n\nBureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement\n\n BSEE's mission is to regulate safety, emergency preparedness, \n\nenvironmental responsibility and appropriate development and \n\nconservation of offshore oil and natural gas resources. BSEE's \n\nregulatory priorities are guided by the BSEE FY 2012-2015 Strategic \n\nPlan, which includes two strategic goals to focus the Bureau's \n\npriorities in fulfillment of its mission:\n\n Regulate, enforce, and respond to OCS development using \n\nthe full range of authorities, policies, and tools to compel safety and \n\nenvironmental responsibility and appropriate development of offshore \n\noil and natural gas resources.\n\n Build and sustain the organizational, technical, and \n\n\n\nintellectual capacity within and across BSEE's key functions--capacity \n\nthat keeps pace with OCS industry technology improvements, innovates in \n\nregulation and enforcement, and reduces risk through systemic \n\nassessment and regulatory and enforcement actions.\n\n BSEE has identified the following four areas of regulatory \n\npriorities: (1) Safety; (2) Oil Spill Response; (3) Arctic; and (4) \n\nManaging and Mitigating Risk via Improved Technology. Other regulatory \n\ntopics under development include decommissioning costs, pipelines, and \n\nrenewable energy.\n\n Safety\n\n BSEE will be requesting comments on regulatory options for \n\nimproving aviation safety, crane safety, and safety management systems.\n\n Oil Spill Response\n\n BSEE will update regulations for offshore oil spill response \n\nplanning and preparedness. This rule will incorporate lessons learned \n\nfrom the Deepwater Horizon incident, improved preparedness capability \n\nstandards, and applicable research findings.\n\n Arctic\n\n BSEE is working with BOEM on a joint proposed rule to promote safe, \n\nresponsible, and effective drilling activities on the Arctic OCS while \n\nensuring protection of the Arctic's communities and marine environment.\n\n Managing and Mitigating Risk via Improved Technology\n\n BSEE will develop a proposed rule containing requirements on \n\nblowout preventers and critical reforms in the areas of well design, \n\nwell control, casing, cementing, real-time monitoring, and subsea \n\ncontainment. This proposed rule will address and implement multiple \n\nrecommendations resulting from various investigations from the \n\nDeepwater Horizon incident.\n\n Additionally, BSEE will finalize revisions of its rule on \n\nproduction safety systems and life cycle analysis. This rule will \n\nexpand the use of life cycle management of critical equipment. The rule \n\naddresses issues such as subsurface safety devices, safety device \n\ntesting, and expands the requirements for operating production systems \n\non the OCS.\n\nOffice of Natural Resources Revenue\n\n ONRR will continue to collect, account for, and disburse revenues \n\nfrom Federal offshore energy and mineral leases and from onshore \n\nmineral leases on Federal and Indian lands. The program operates \n\nnationwide and is primarily responsible for timely and accurate \n\ncollection, distribution, and accounting for revenues associated with \n\n\n\nmineral and energy production. ONRR's regulatory plan is as follows:\n\n Simplify valuation regulations\n\n ONRR plans to simplify the regulations at title 30 of the Code of \n\nFederal Regulations (CFR) part 1206 for establishing the value for \n\nroyalty purposes of (1) oil and natural gas produced from Federal \n\nleases; and (2) coal produced from Federal and Indian leases. \n\nAdditionally, the proposed rules would consolidate sections of the \n\nregulations common to all minerals, such as definitions and \n\ninstructions regarding how a payor should request a valuation \n\ndetermination. ONRR published Advance Notices of Proposed Rulemaking \n\n(ANPRMs) to initiate the rulemaking process and to obtain input from \n\ninterested parties.\n\n Clarify and simplify issuing notices of noncompliance and \n\ncivil penalties\n\n This rule would amend ONRR civil penalty regulations to: (1) Codify \n\napplication of those regulations to solid minerals and geothermal \n\nleases as the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009 authorizes; (2) adjust \n\nFederal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act civil penalty amounts for \n\ninflation as the Federal Civil Penalty Inflation Adjustment Act \n\nrequires; (3) clarify and simplify the existing regulations for issuing \n\nnotices of noncompliance and civil penalties under 30 CFR part 1241; \n\nand (4) provide notice that ONRR will post its matrices for civil \n\npenalty assessments on the ONRR Web site.\n\n Clarify and simplify distribution and disbursement of \n\nqualified revenues from certain leases under the GOMESA\n\n ONRR would amend the regulations on the distribution and \n\ndisbursement of qualified revenues from certain leases on the Gulf of \n\nMexico's Outer Continental Shelf, under the provisions of the Gulf of \n\nMexico Energy Security Act of 2006. These proposed regulations set \n\nforth the formulas and methodologies for calculating and allocating \n\nrevenues during the second phase of revenue sharing to: The States of \n\nAlabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas; their eligible Coastal \n\nPolitical Subdivisions; the Land and Water Conservation Fund; and the \n\nUnited States Treasury. Additionally, in this proposed rule, the \n\nDepartment of the Interior moves the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act \n\nof 2006's Phase I regulations from the Bureau of Ocean Energy \n\nManagement's 30 CFR chapter V to ONRR's 30 CFR chapter XII, and \n\nproposes additional clarification and minor definition changes to the \n\ncurrent revenue-sharing regulations.\n\n Clarify and simplify valuation regulations for Indian oil \n\nleases\n\n\n\n ONRR would ensure that Indian lessors receive maximum revenues from \n\ntheir mineral resources, as required by statute and the Secretary's \n\ntrust responsibility. The existing rule was published in 1988 with some \n\namendments published in December 2007. Changes in the oil markets have \n\nraised concerns regarding the valuation methods for Indian oil. \n\nGenerally, Indian leases have a provision that place the value of their \n\noil at the highest price paid for a major portion of production of \n\nlike-quality oil from the same field or area. Proposed changes that \n\nfollowed the 1988 rule were met with disagreement from Tribes and \n\nindustry.\n\n In 2011, the Secretary convened the Indian Oil Negotiated \n\nRulemaking Committee (Committee), established under the Federal \n\nAdvisory Committee\n\n[[Page 76562]]\n\nAct, to address the major portion provision of the current Indian oil \n\nand gas rule. The Committee submitted its recommendations to ONRR in \n\nSeptember 2013. Those recommendations form the basis of this proposed \n\nrule. By revising the method for valuing oil produced on Indian leases, \n\nthe proposed rule provides clarity and certainty to all concerned \n\nparties while additionally assuring that Tribes and allottees receive, \n\nin a timely fashion, royalties that satisfy the major portion provision \n\ncontained in most Indian leases.\n\nOffice of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement\n\n The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) was \n\ncreated by the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 \n\n(SMCRA). Under SMCRA, OSM has two principal functions--the regulation \n\nof surface coal mining and reclamation operations and the reclamation \n\nand restoration of abandoned coal mine lands. In enacting SMCRA, \n\nCongress directed OSM to ``strike a balance between protection of the \n\nenvironment and agricultural productivity and the Nation's need for \n\ncoal as an essential source of energy.'' In response to its statutory \n\nmandate, OSM has sought to develop and maintain a stable regulatory \n\nprogram that is safe, cost-effective, and environmentally sound. A \n\nstable regulatory program ensures that the coal mining industry has \n\nclear guidelines for operation and reclamation, and that citizens know \n\nhow the program is being implemented.\n\n OSM's Federal regulatory program sets minimum requirements for \n\nobtaining a permit for surface and underground coal mining operations, \n\nsets performance standards for those operations, requires reclamation \n\n\n\nof lands and waters disturbed by mining, and requires enforcement to \n\nensure that the standards are met. OSM is the primary regulatory \n\nauthority for SMCRA enforcement until a State or Indian tribe develops \n\nits own regulatory program, which is no less effective than the Federal \n\nprogram. When a State or Indian tribe achieves ``primacy,'' it assumes \n\ndirect responsibility for permitting, inspection, and enforcement \n\nactivities under its federally approved regulatory program. The \n\nregulatory standards in Federal program states and in primacy states \n\nare essentially the same with only minor, non-substantive differences. \n\nToday, 24 States have primacy, including 23 of the 24 coal producing \n\nStates. OSM's regulatory priorities for the coming year will focus on:\n\n Stream Protection.\n\n Protect streams and related environmental resources from the \n\nadverse effects of surface coal mining operations. OSM plans to revise \n\nits regulations to improve the balance between environmental protection \n\nand the Nation's need for coal by better protecting streams from the \n\nadverse impacts of surface coal mining operations.\n\n Coal Combustion Residues.\n\n Establish Federal standards for the beneficial use of coal \n\ncombustion residues on active and abandoned coal mines.\n\nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\n\n The mission of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is to work \n\nwith others to conserve, protect, and enhance fish, wildlife, and \n\nplants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American \n\npeople. FWS also provides opportunities for Americans to enjoy the \n\noutdoors and our shared natural heritage.\n\n FWS fulfills its responsibilities through a diverse array of \n\nprograms that:\n\n Protect and recover endangered and threatened species;\n\n Monitor and manage migratory birds;\n\n Restore native aquatic populations and nationally \n\nsignificant fisheries;\n\n Enforce Federal wildlife laws and regulate international \n\ntrade;\n\n Conserve and restore wildlife habitat such as wetlands;\n\n Help foreign governments conserve wildlife through \n\ninternational conservation efforts;\n\n Distribute Federal funds to States, territories, and \n\ntribes for fish and wildlife conservation projects; and\n\n Manage the more than 150-million-acre National Wildlife \n\nRefuge System, which protects and conserves fish and wildlife and their \n\nhabitats and allows the public to engage in outdoor recreational \n\nactivities.\n\n\n\n During the next year, FWS regulatory priorities will include:\n\nRegulations under the Endangered Species Act (ESA):\n\n We will issue multiple rules to add species to, remove species \n\nfrom, and reclassify species on the Lists of Endangered and Threatened \n\nWildlife and Plants and to designate critical habitat for certain \n\nlisted species, and rules to transform the processes for listing \n\nspecies and designating critical habitat. We will improve the listing \n\nprocess by issuing rules to more clearly describe areas where listed \n\nspecies are protected and revise the process for submitting petitions \n\nto list, delist, or reclassify species. We will further the protection \n\nof native species and their ecosystems through a policy that will \n\nprovide incentives for voluntary conservation actions taken for species \n\nprior to their listing under the ESA. We will issue rules to improve \n\nthe process of critical habitat designation, including clarifying \n\ndefinitions of ``critical habitat'' and ``destruction or adverse \n\nmodification'' of critical habitat, and a policy to explain how we \n\nconsider various factors in determining exclusions to critical habitat \n\nunder section 4(b)(2) of the ESA.\n\nRegulations under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA):\n\n In carrying out our responsibility to manage migratory bird \n\npopulations, we issue annual migratory bird hunting regulations, which \n\nestablish the frameworks (outside limits) for States to establish \n\nseason lengths, bag limits, and areas for migratory game bird hunting. \n\nTo ensure proper administration of the MBTA, we will revise our \n\nregulations to prevent the wanton waste of migratory game birds to \n\nclarify that the hunting public must make reasonable efforts to \n\nretrieve birds that have been killed or injured. We will also revise \n\nour regulations regarding permits for certain take of eagles and eagle \n\nnests and propose regulations for the use of raptors other than eagles \n\nfor abatement (the use of trained raptors to mitigate depredation \n\nproblems caused by birds or other wildlife).\n\nRegulations to administer the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS):\n\n In carrying out our statutory responsibility to provide wildlife-\n\ndependent recreational opportunities on NWRS lands, we issue an annual \n\nrule to update the hunting and fishing regulations on specific refuges. \n\nTo ensure protection of NWRS resources, we will issue a proposed rule \n\nto ensure that businesses conducting oil or gas operations on NWRS \n\nlands do so in a manner that prevents or minimizes damage to the lands, \n\nvisitor values, and management objectives. We will also issue a policy \n\n\n\nfor managing cultural resources (archaeological resources, historic and \n\narchitectural properties, and areas or sites of traditional or \n\nreligious significance to Native Americans) on NWRS lands.\n\nRegulations to carry out the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration (WSFR) \n\nAct:\n\n To strengthen our partnership with State conservation \n\norganizations, we are working on several rules to update and clarify \n\nour WSFR regulations. States rely on FWS to distribute finances, and \n\nthe FWS relies on the States to implement\n\n[[Page 76563]]\n\neligible conservation projects. We will expand on existing regulations \n\nthat prescribe processes that applicants and grantees must follow when \n\napplying for and managing grants from FWS. Among other rules, we will \n\nalso revise our regulations under the Clean Vessel Act and Boating \n\nInfrastructure Grant programs to improve management and execution of \n\nthose programs.\n\n In accordance with section 3(a) of Executive Order 13609 \n\n(``Promoting International Regulatory Cooperation''), we will issue the \n\nfollowing rulemaking actions:\n\nRegulations to carry out the Convention on International Trade in \n\nEndangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES):\n\n We will update our CITES regulations to incorporate provisions \n\nresulting from the 16th Conference of the Parties to CITES. The \n\nrevisions will help us more effectively promote species conservation \n\nand help U.S. importers and exporters of wildlife products understand \n\nhow to conduct lawful international trade. We will also rewrite a \n\nsubstantial portion of our regulations for the importation, \n\nexportation, and transportation of wildlife by proposing changes to the \n\nport structure and inspection fees and making the regulations easier to \n\nunderstand.\n\n To help protect African elephants, we will revise our regulations \n\nregarding ivory from African elephants to prohibit interstate commerce \n\nand export, except for antique specimens and certain other items. \n\nImport of sport-hunted trophies would still be allowed, but the number \n\nof trophies that could be imported by a hunter in a given year would be \n\nlimited.\n\n Finally, to protect native species and prevent the spread of \n\ninjurious species, we will propose regulations to improve our process \n\nfor making injurious wildlife determinations for foreign species under \n\nthe Lacey Act to prevent the interstate transportation and commerce of \n\ninjurious wildlife.\n\n\n\nNational Park Service\n\n The NPS preserves unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and \n\nvalues within more than 400 units of the National Park System \n\nencompassing nearly 84 million acres of lands and waters for the \n\nenjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. \n\nNPS also cooperates with partners to extend the benefits of natural and \n\nresource conservation and outdoor recreation throughout the United \n\nStates and the world.\n\n To achieve this mission NPS adheres to the following guiding \n\nprinciples:\n\n Excellent Service: Providing the best possible service to \n\npark visitors and partners.\n\n Productive Partnerships: Collaborating with Federal, \n\nState, tribal, and local governments, private organizations, and \n\nbusinesses to work toward common goals.\n\n Citizen Involvement: Providing opportunities for citizens \n\nto participate in the decisions and actions of the National Park \n\nService.\n\n Heritage Education: Educating park visitors and the \n\ngeneral public about their history and common heritage.\n\n Outstanding Employees: Empowering a diverse workforce \n\ncommitted to excellence, integrity, and quality work.\n\n Employee Development: Providing developmental \n\nopportunities and training so employees have the ``tools to do the \n\njob'' safely and efficiently.\n\n Wise Decisions: Integrating social, economic, \n\nenvironmental, and ethical considerations into the decision-making \n\nprocess.\n\n Effective Management: Instilling a performance management \n\nphilosophy that fosters creativity, focuses on results, and requires \n\naccountability at all levels.\n\n Research and Technology: Incorporating research findings \n\nand new technologies to improve work practices, products, and services.\n\n NPS regulatory priorities for the coming year include:\n\n Managing Off-Road Vehicle Use\n\n Rules for Fire Island National Seashore, Lake Meredith National \n\nRecreation Area, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, and Cape Lookout \n\nNational Seashore would allow for management of off-road vehicle (ORV) \n\nuse, to protect and preserve natural and cultural resources, and \n\nprovide a variety of visitor use experiences while minimizing conflicts \n\n\n\namong user groups. Further, the rules would designate ORV routes and \n\nestablish operational requirements and restrictions.\n\n Managing Bicycling\n\n New rules would authorize and manage bicycling at Cuyahoga Valley \n\nNational Park, and Bryce Canyon National Park.\n\n Implementing the Native American Graves Protection and \n\nRepatriation Act\n\n (1) A new rule would establish a process for disposition of \n\nUnclaimed Human Remains and Funerary Objects discovered after November \n\n16, 1990, on Federal or Indian Lands.\n\n (2) A rule revising the existing regulations would describe the \n\nNAGPRA process in plain language, eliminate ambiguity, clarify terms, \n\nand include Native Hawaiians in the process. The rule would eliminate \n\nunnecessary requirements for museums and would not add processes or \n\ncollect additional information.\n\n Regulating non-Federal oil and gas activity on NPS land\n\n The rule would account for new technology and industry practices, \n\neliminate regulatory exemptions, update new legal requirements, remove \n\ncaps on bond amounts, and allow the NPS to recover compliance costs \n\nassociated with administering the regulations.\n\n Authorizing and managing service animals\n\n The rule will define and differentiate service animals from pets, \n\nand will describe the circumstances under which service animals would \n\nbe allowed in a park area. The rule will ensure NPS compliance with \n\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (28 U.S.C. 794) and \n\nbetter align NPS regulations with the Americans with Disabilities Act \n\nof 1990 (42 U.S.C. 1211 et seq.) and the Department of Justice Service \n\nAnimal regulations of 2011 (28 CFR 36.104).\n\n Preserving and managing paleontological resources\n\n This rule would implement provisions of the Paleontological \n\nResources Protection Act. The rule would preserve, manage, and protect \n\npaleontological resources on Federal lands and ensure that these \n\nresources are available for current and future generations to enjoy as \n\npart of America's national heritage. The rule would address management, \n\ncollection, and curation of paleontological resources from Federal \n\nlands using scientific principles and expertise. Provisions of the rule \n\nwill ensure that resources are collected in accordance with permits and \n\ncurated in an approved repository. The rule would also protect \n\n\n\nconfidential locality data, and authorize penalties for illegally \n\ncollecting, damaging, altering, defacing, or selling paleontological \n\nresources.\n\n Collecting plants for traditional cultural practices\n\n The rule would propose authorizing Park Superintendents to enter \n\ninto agreements with federally recognized tribes to permit tribal \n\nmembers to collect limited quantities of plant resources in parks to be \n\nused for traditional cultural practices and activities.\n\nBureau of Reclamation\n\n The Bureau of Reclamation's mission is to manage, develop, and \n\nprotect water and related resources in an environmentally and \n\neconomically sound manner in the interest of the American public. To \n\naccomplish this\n\n[[Page 76564]]\n\nmission, we employ management, engineering, and science to achieve \n\neffective and environmentally sensitive solutions.\n\n Reclamation projects provide: Irrigation water service, municipal \n\nand industrial water supply, hydroelectric power generation, water \n\nquality improvement, groundwater management, fish and wildlife \n\nenhancement, outdoor recreation, flood control, navigation, river \n\nregulation and control, system optimization, and related uses. We have \n\ncontinued to focus on increased security at our facilities.\n\n Our regulatory program focus in fiscal year 2015 is to publish a \n\nproposed minor amendment to 43 CFR part 429 to bring it into compliance \n\nwith the requirements of the recently published final rule, 43 CFR part \n\n5, Commercial Filming and Similar Projects and Still Photography on \n\nCertain Areas under Department Jurisdiction. Publishing this rule will \n\nimplement the provisions of Public Law 106-206, which directs the \n\nestablishment of permits and reasonable fees for commercial filming and \n\ncertain still photography activities on public lands.\n\nBILLING CODE 4310-10-P\n\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ)--FALL 2014\n\nStatement of Regulatory Priorities\n\n The mission of the Department of Justice is to enforce the law and \n\ndefend the interests of the United States according to the law, to \n\nensure public safety against foreign and domestic threats, to provide \n\nFederal leadership in preventing and controlling crime, to seek just \n\npunishment for those guilty of unlawful behavior, and to ensure the \n\n\n\nfair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans. In \n\ncarrying out its mission, the Department is guided by four core values: \n\n(1) Equal justice under the law; (2) honesty and integrity; (3) \n\ncommitment to excellence; and (4) respect for the worth and dignity of \n\neach human being. The Department of Justice is primarily a law \n\nenforcement agency, not a regulatory agency; it carries out its \n\nprincipal investigative, prosecutorial, and other enforcement \n\nactivities through means other than the regulatory process.\n\n The regulatory priorities of the Department include initiatives in \n\nthe areas of civil rights, criminal law enforcement and immigration. \n\nThese initiatives are summarized below. In addition, several other \n\ncomponents of the Department carry out important responsibilities \n\nthrough the regulatory process. Although their regulatory efforts are \n\nnot separately discussed in this overview of the regulatory priorities, \n\nthose components have key roles in implementing the Department's anti-\n\nterrorism and law enforcement priorities.\n\nCivil Rights Division\n\n The Department is including five disability nondiscrimination \n\nrulemaking initiatives in its Regulatory Plan: (1) Implementation of \n\nthe ADA Amendments Act of 2008 in the ADA regulations (titles II and \n\nIII); (2) Implementation of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 in the \n\nDepartment's section 504 regulations; (3) Nondiscrimination on the \n\nBasis of Disability by Public Accommodations: Movie Captioning and \n\nAudio Description; (4) Accessibility of Web Information and Services of \n\nState and Local Governments; and (5) Accessibility of Web Information \n\nand Services of Public Accommodations.\n\n The Department's other disability nondiscrimination rulemaking \n\ninitiatives, while important priorities for the Department's rulemaking \n\nagenda, will be included in the Department's long-term actions for \n\nfiscal year 2016. As will be discussed more fully below, these \n\ninitiatives include: (1) Accessibility of Medical Equipment and \n\nFurniture; (2) Accessibility of Beds in Guestrooms with Mobility \n\nFeatures in Places of Lodging; (3) Next Generation 9-1-1 Services; and \n\n(4) Accessibility of Equipment and Furniture. The Department will also \n\nbe revising its regulations for Coordination of Enforcement of Non-\n\nDiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs, as well as revising \n\nregulations implementing section 274B of the Immigration and \n\nNationality Act.\n\n ADA Amendments Act. In September 2008, Congress passed the ADA \n\nAmendments Act, which revises the definition of ``disability'' to more \n\nbroadly encompass impairments that substantially limit a major life \n\n\n\nactivity. On January 30, 2014, the Department published a Notice of \n\nProposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposing amendments to both its title II \n\nand title III ADA regulations in order to incorporate the statutory \n\nchanges set forth in the ADA Amendments Act. The comment period closed \n\non March 31, 2014. The Department expects to publish a final rule \n\nincorporating these changes into the ADA implementing regulations in \n\nthe second quarter of fiscal year 2015. The Department also plans to \n\npropose amendments to its section 504 regulations to implement the ADA \n\nAmendments Act of 2008 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015.\n\n Captioning and Audio Description in Movie Theaters. Title III of \n\nthe ADA requires public accommodations to take ``such steps as may be \n\nnecessary to ensure that no individual with a disability is treated \n\ndifferently because of the absence of auxiliary aids and services, \n\nunless the covered entity can demonstrate that taking such steps would \n\ncause a fundamental alteration or would result in an undue burden.'' 42 \n\nU.S.C. 12182(b)(2)(A)(iii). Both open and closed captioning and audio \n\nrecordings are examples of auxiliary aids and services that should be \n\nprovided by places of public accommodations, 28 CFR 36.303(b)(1)-(2). \n\nThe Department stated in the preamble to its 1991 rule that ``[m]ovie \n\ntheaters are not required . . . to present open-captioned films,'' 28 \n\nCFR part 36, app. C (2011), but it did not address closed captioning \n\nand audio description in movie theaters. In the movie theater context, \n\n``closed captioning'' refers to captions that only the patron \n\nrequesting the closed captions can see because the captions are \n\ndelivered to the patron at or near the patron's seat. Audio description \n\nis a technology that enables individuals who are blind or have low \n\nvision to enjoy movies by providing a spoken narration of key visual \n\nelements of a visually delivered medium, such as actions, settings, \n\nfacial expressions, costumes, and scene changes.\n\n Since 1991, there have been many technological advances in the area \n\nof closed captioning and audio description for first-run movies. In \n\nJune 2008, the Department issued an NPRM to revise the ADA title III \n\nregulation, 73 FR 34466, in which the Department stated that it was \n\nconsidering options for requiring that movie theater owners or \n\noperators exhibit movies that are captioned or that provide video \n\n(narrative) description. The Department issued an ANPRM on July 26, \n\n2010, to obtain more information regarding issues raised by commenters; \n\nto seek comment on technical questions that arose from the Department's \n\nresearch; and to learn more about the status of digital conversion. In \n\naddition, the Department sought information regarding whether other \n\ntechnologies or areas of interest (e.g., 3D) have developed or are in \n\n\n\nthe process of development that would either replace or augment digital \n\ncinema or make any regulatory requirements for captioning and audio \n\ndescription more difficult or expensive to implement. The Department \n\nreceived approximately 1171 public comments in response to its movie \n\ncaptioning and video description\n\n[[Page 76565]]\n\nANPRM. On August 1, 2014, the Department published its NPRM proposing \n\nto revise the ADA title III regulation to require movie theaters to \n\nhave the capability to exhibit movies with closed movie captioning and \n\naudio description (which was described in the ANPRM as video \n\ndescription) for all showings of movies that are available with closed \n\nmovie captioning or audio description, to require theaters to provide \n\nnotice to the public about the availability of these services, and to \n\nensure that theaters have staff available who can provide information \n\nto patrons about the use of these services. In response to a request \n\nfor an extension of the public comment period, the Department has \n\nissued a notice extending the comment period for 60 days until December \n\n1, 2014.\n\n Web site Accessibility. The Internet as it is known today did not \n\nexist when Congress enacted the ADA, yet today the World Wide Web plays \n\na critical role in the daily personal, professional, civic, and \n\nbusiness life of Americans. The ADA's expansive nondiscrimination \n\nmandate reaches goods and services provided by public accommodations \n\nand public entities using Internet Web sites. Being unable to access \n\nWeb sites puts individuals at a great disadvantage in today's society, \n\nwhich is driven by a dynamic electronic marketplace and unprecedented \n\naccess to information. On the economic front, electronic commerce, or \n\n``e-commerce,'' often offers consumers a wider selection and lower \n\nprices than traditional, ``brick-and-mortar'' storefronts, with the \n\nadded convenience of not having to leave one's home to obtain goods and \n\nservices. For individuals with disabilities who experience barriers to \n\ntheir ability to travel or to leave their homes, the Internet may be \n\ntheir only way to access certain goods and services. Beyond goods and \n\nservices, information available on the Internet has become a gateway to \n\neducation, socializing, and entertainment.\n\n The Internet is also dramatically changing the way that \n\ngovernmental entities serve the public. Public entities are \n\nincreasingly providing their constituents access to government services \n\nand programs through their Web sites. Through Government Web sites, the \n\npublic can obtain information or correspond with local officials \n\n\n\nwithout having to wait in line or be placed on hold. They can also pay \n\nfines, apply for benefits, renew State-issued identification, register \n\nto vote, file taxes, request copies of vital records, and complete \n\nnumerous other everyday tasks. The availability of these services and \n\ninformation online not only makes life easier for the public but also \n\noften enables governmental entities to operate more efficiently and at \n\na lower cost.\n\n The ADA's promise to provide an equal opportunity for individuals \n\nwith disabilities to participate in and benefit from all aspects of \n\nAmerican civic and economic life will be achieved in today's \n\ntechnologically advanced society only if it is clear to State and local \n\ngovernments, businesses, educators, and other public accommodations \n\nthat their Web sites must be accessible. Consequently, the Department \n\nis considering amending its regulations implementing title II and title \n\nIII of the ADA to require public entities and public accommodations \n\nthat provide products or services to the public through Internet Web \n\nsites to make their sites accessible to and usable by individuals with \n\ndisabilities.\n\n In particular, the Department's ANPRM on Web site accessibility \n\nsought public comment regarding what standards, if any, it should adopt \n\nfor Web site accessibility, whether the Department should adopt \n\ncoverage limitations for certain entities, like small businesses, and \n\nwhat resources and services are available to make existing Web sites \n\naccessible to individuals with disabilities. The Department also \n\nsolicited comments on the costs of making Web sites accessible and on \n\nthe existence of any other effective and reasonably feasible \n\nalternatives to making Web sites accessible. The Department received \n\napproximately 440 public comments and is in the process of reviewing \n\nthese comments. The Department will be publishing separate NPRMs \n\naddressing Web site accessibility pursuant to titles II and III of the \n\nADA. On July 9, 2014, the Department submitted its title II Web site \n\nAccessibility NPRM to OMB for E.O. 12866 review with a goal of \n\npublishing the NPRM before the end of the 2014 calendar year. The \n\nDepartment plans to follow with the publication of the title III NPRM \n\nin the third quarter of fiscal year 2015.\n\n The final rulemaking initiatives from the 2010 ANPRMs are included \n\nin the Department's long-term priorities projected for fiscal year \n\n2016:\n\n Next Generation 9-1-1. This ANPRM sought information on possible \n\nrevisions to the Department's regulation to ensure direct access to \n\nNext Generation 9-1-1 (NG 9-1-1) services for individuals with \n\ndisabilities. In 1991, the Department of Justice published a regulation \n\n\n\nto implement title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \n\n(ADA). That regulation requires public safety answering points (PSAPs) \n\nto provide direct access to persons with disabilities who use analog \n\ntelecommunication devices for the deaf (TTYs), 28 CFR 35.162. Since \n\nthat rule was published, there have been major changes in the types of \n\ncommunications technology used by the general public and by people who \n\nhave disabilities that affect their hearing or speech. Many individuals \n\nwith disabilities now use the Internet and wireless text devices as \n\ntheir primary modes of telecommunications. At the same time, PSAPs are \n\nplanning to shift from analog telecommunications technology to new \n\nInternet-Protocol (IP)-enabled NG 9-1-1 services that will provide \n\nvoice and data (such as text, pictures, and video) capabilities. As \n\nPSAPs transition from the analog systems to the new technologies, it is \n\nessential that people with communication disabilities be able to use \n\nthe new systems. Therefore, the Department published this ANPRM to \n\nbegin to develop appropriate regulatory guidance for PSAPs that are \n\nmaking this transition. The Department is in the process of completing \n\nits review of the approximately 146 public comments it received in \n\nresponse to its NG 9-1-1 ANPRM and expects to publish an NPRM \n\naddressing accessibility of NG 9-1-1 in the first quarter of fiscal \n\nyear 2016.\n\n Equipment and Furniture. Both title II and title III of the ADA \n\nrequire covered entities to make reasonable modifications in their \n\nprograms or services to facilitate participation by persons with \n\ndisabilities. In addition, covered entities are required to ensure that \n\npeople are not excluded from participation because facilities are \n\ninaccessible or because the entity has failed to provide auxiliary \n\naids. The use of accessible equipment and furniture is often critical \n\nto an entity's ability to provide a person with a disability equal \n\naccess to its services. Changes in technology have resulted in the \n\ndevelopment and improved availability of accessible equipment and \n\nfurniture that benefit individuals with disabilities. The 2010 ADA \n\nStandards include accessibility requirements for some types of fixed \n\nequipment (e.g., ATMs, washing machines, dryers, tables, benches and \n\nvending machines) and the Department plans to look to these standards \n\nfor guidance, where applicable, when it proposes accessibility \n\nstandards for equipment and furniture that is not fixed. The ANPRM \n\nsought information about other categories of equipment, including beds \n\nin accessible guest rooms, and medical equipment and furniture. The \n\nDepartment received approximately 420\n\n\n\n[[Page 76566]]\n\ncomments in response to its ANPRM and is in the process of reviewing \n\nthese comments. The Department plans to publish in early fiscal year \n\n2016 a separate NPRM pursuant to title III of the ADA on beds in \n\naccessible guest rooms and a more detailed ANPRM pursuant to titles II \n\nand III of the ADA that focuses solely on accessible medical equipment \n\nand furniture. The remaining items of equipment and furniture addressed \n\nin the 2010 ANPRM will be the subject of an NPRM that the Department \n\nanticipates publishing in mid-fiscal year 2016.\n\n Coordination of Enforcement of Non-Discrimination in Federally \n\nAssisted Programs. In addition, the Department is planning to revise \n\nthe co-ordination regulations implementing title VI of the Civil Rights \n\nAct, which have not been updated in over 30 years. Among other things, \n\nthe updates will revise outdated provisions, streamline procedural \n\nsteps, streamline and clarify provisions regarding information and data \n\ncollection, promote opportunities to encourage public engagement, and \n\nincorporate current law regarding meaningful access for individuals who \n\nare limited English proficient.\n\n Implementation of Section 247B of the Immigration and Nationality \n\nAct. The Department also proposes to revise regulations implementing \n\nsection 274B of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The proposed \n\nrevisions are appropriate to conform the regulations to the statutory \n\ntext as amended, simplify and add definitions of statutory terms, \n\nupdate and clarify the procedures for filing and processing charges of \n\ndiscrimination, ensure effective investigations of unfair immigration-\n\nrelated employment practices, and update outdated references. The \n\nregulations will also be revised to reflect the new name of the office \n\nwithin the Department charged with enforcing this statute.\n\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF)\n\n ATF issues regulations to enforce the Federal laws relating to the \n\nmanufacture and commerce of firearms and explosives. ATF's mission and \n\nregulations are designed to, among other objectives, curb illegal \n\ntraffic in, and criminal use of, firearms and explosives, and to assist \n\nState, local, and other Federal law enforcement agencies in reducing \n\ncrime and violence. The Department is including one rulemaking \n\ninitiative from ATF in its Regulatory Plan. The Department is planning \n\nto finalize a proposed rule to amend ATF's regulations regarding the \n\nmaking or transferring of a firearm under the National Firearms Act. As \n\nproposed, this rule would (1) add a definition for the term \n\n\n\n``responsible person''; (2) require each responsible person of a \n\ncorporation, trust or legal entity to complete a specified form, and to \n\nsubmit photographs and fingerprints; and (3) modify the requirements \n\nregarding the certificate of the chief law enforcement officer.\n\n ATF will continue, as a priority during fiscal year 2014, to seek \n\nmodifications to its regulations governing commerce in firearms and \n\nexplosives. ATF plans to issue regulations to finalize the current \n\ninterim rules implementing the provisions of the Safe Explosives Act, \n\ntitle XI, subtitle C, of Public Law 107-296, the Homeland Security Act \n\nof 2002 (enacted Nov. 25, 2002). ATF also has begun a rulemaking \n\nprocess that will lead to promulgation of a revised set of regulations \n\n(27 CFR part 771) governing the procedure and practice for proposed \n\ndenial of applications for explosives licenses or permits and proposed \n\nrevocation of such licenses and permits. In addition, ATF also has \n\nseveral other rulemaking initiatives as part of the Department's \n\nrulemaking agenda.\n\n Pursuant to Executive Order 13563 ``Improving Regulation and \n\nRegulatory Review,'' ATF has published a final rule to amend existing \n\nregulations and extend the term of import permits for firearms, \n\nammunition, and defense articles from 1 year to 2 years. The additional \n\ntime will allow importers sufficient time to complete the importation \n\nof an authorized commodity before the permit expires and eliminate the \n\nneed for importers to submit new and duplicative import applications. \n\nATF believes that extending the term of import permits will result in \n\nsubstantial cost and time savings for both ATF and industry.\n\nDrug Enforcement Administration (DEA)\n\n DEA is the primary agency responsible for coordinating the drug law \n\nenforcement activities of the United States and also assists in the \n\nimplementation of the President's National Drug Control Strategy. DEA \n\nimplements and enforces titles II and III of the Comprehensive Drug \n\nAbuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 and the Controlled Substances \n\nImport and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 801-971), as amended, and collectively \n\nreferred to as the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). DEA's mission is to \n\nenforce the CSA and its regulations and bring to the criminal and civil \n\njustice system those organizations and individuals involved in the \n\ngrowing, manufacture, or distribution of controlled substances and \n\nlisted chemicals appearing in or destined for illicit traffic in the \n\nUnited States. DEA promulgates the CSA implementing regulations in \n\ntitle 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), parts 1300 to 1321. \n\nThe CSA and its implementing regulations are designed to prevent, \n\ndetect, and eliminate the diversion of controlled substances and listed \n\n\n\nchemicals into the illicit market while providing for the legitimate \n\nmedical, scientific, research, and industrial needs of the United \n\nStates.\n\n Pursuant to its statutory authority, DEA continuously evaluates new \n\nand emerging substances to determine whether such substances should be \n\ncontrolled under the CSA. During fiscal year 2015, in addition to \n\ninitiating temporary scheduling actions to prevent imminent hazard to \n\nthe public safety, DEA will also consider petitions to control or \n\nreschedule various substances. Among other regulatory reviews and \n\ninitiatives, the DEA will initiate the notice of proposed rulemaking \n\ntitled, ``Transporting Controlled Substances Away from Principal Places \n\nof Business or Principal Places of Professional Practice on an As \n\nNeeded and Random Basis.'' In this rule, the DEA proposes to amend its \n\nregulations governing the registration, security, reporting, \n\nrecordkeeping, and ordering requirements in circumstances where \n\npractitioners transport controlled substances for dispensing to \n\npatients on an as needed and random basis. Lastly, the DEA will \n\nfinalize its Interim Final Rule for Electronic Prescriptions for \n\nControlled Substances. By this final rule, the DEA would finalize its \n\nregulations to clarify: (1) the criteria by which DEA-registered \n\npractitioners may electronically issue controlled substance \n\nprescriptions; and (2) the criteria by which DEA-registered pharmacies \n\nmay receive and archive these electronic prescriptions.\n\nBureau of Prisons\n\n The Federal Bureau of Prisons issues regulations to enforce the \n\nFederal laws relating to its mission: to protect society by confining \n\noffenders in the controlled environments of prisons and community-based \n\nfacilities that are safe, humane, cost-efficient, and appropriately \n\nsecure, and that provide work and other self-improvement opportunities \n\nto assist offenders in becoming law-abiding citizens. During the next \n\n12 months, in addition to other regulatory objectives aimed at \n\naccomplishing its mission, the Bureau will continue its ongoing efforts \n\nto: streamline regulations, eliminating unnecessary language and \n\nimproving readability; improve disciplinary\n\n[[Page 76567]]\n\nprocedures through a revision of the subpart relating to the \n\ndisciplinary process; reduce the introduction of contraband through \n\nvarious means, such as clarifying drug and alcohol surveillance testing \n\nprograms; protect the public from continuing criminal activity \n\ncommitted within prison; and enhance the Bureau's ability to more \n\n\n\nclosely monitor the communications of high-risk inmates.\n\nExecutive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR)\n\n On March 1, 2003, pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002 \n\n(HSA), the responsibility for immigration enforcement and border \n\nsecurity and for providing immigration-related services and benefits, \n\nsuch as naturalization, immigrant petitions, and work authorization, \n\nwas transferred from the Justice Department's former Immigration and \n\nNaturalization Service (INS) to the Department of Homeland Security \n\n(DHS). However, the immigration judges and the Board of Immigration \n\nAppeals (Board) in EOIR remain part of the Department of Justice. The \n\nimmigration judges adjudicate approximately 400,000 cases each year to \n\ndetermine whether aliens should be ordered removed from the United \n\nStates or should be granted some form of relief from removal. The Board \n\nhas jurisdiction over appeals from the decisions of immigration judges, \n\nas well as other matters. Accordingly, the Attorney General has a \n\ncontinuing role in the conducting of removal hearings, the granting of \n\nrelief from removal, and custody determinations regarding the detention \n\nof aliens pending completion of removal proceedings. The Attorney \n\nGeneral also is responsible for civil litigation and criminal \n\nprosecutions relating to the immigration laws.\n\n In several pending rulemaking actions, the Department is working to \n\nrevise and update the regulations relating to removal proceedings in \n\norder to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the hearings, \n\nincluding, but not limited to: a joint regulation with DHS to provide \n\nguidance on a number of issues central to the adjudication of \n\napplications for asylum and withholding of removal; a joint regulation \n\nwith DHS to provide, with respect to applicants who are found to have \n\nengaged in persecution of others, a limited exception for actions taken \n\nby the applicant under duress; a joint regulation with DHS to implement \n\nprocedures that address the specialized needs of unaccompanied alien \n\nchildren in removal proceedings pursuant to the William Wilberforce \n\nTrafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008; a proposed \n\nregulation to establish procedures for the filing and adjudication of \n\nmotions to reopen removal, deportation, and exclusion proceedings based \n\nupon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; and a proposed \n\nregulation to improve the recognition and accreditation process for \n\norganizations and representatives that appear in immigration \n\nproceedings before EOIR. Finally, in response to Executive Order 13653, \n\n\n\nthe Department is retrospectively reviewing EOIR's regulations to \n\neliminate regulations that unnecessarily duplicate DHS's regulations \n\nand update outdated references to the pre-2002 immigration system.\n\nRetrospective Review of Existing Regulations\n\n Pursuant to section 6 of Executive Order 13563 ``Improving \n\nRegulation and Regulatory Review'' (Jan. 18, 2011), the following \n\nRegulatory Identifier Numbers (RINs) have been identified as associated \n\nwith retrospective review and analysis in the Department's final \n\nretrospective review of regulations plan. Some of these entries on this \n\nlist may be completed actions, which do not appear in The Regulatory \n\nPlan. However, more information can be found about these completed \n\nrulemakings in past publications of the Unified Agenda on Reginfo.gov \n\nin the Completed Actions section for that agency. These rulemakings can \n\nalso be found on Regulations.gov.

This includes additional steps to \n\nimplement the International Trade Data System as an electronic \n\ninformation exchange capability, or ``single window,'' through which \n\nbusinesses will transmit data required by participating agencies for \n\nthe importation or exportation of cargo.\n\n At the Department of Justice, stakeholders must obtain pre-import \n\nand pre-export authorizations from the Drug Enforcement Administration \n\n(DEA) (relating to controlled substances and listed chemicals), or from \n\nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) (relating \n\nto firearms, ammunition, and explosives). The ITDS ``single window'' \n\nwill work in conjunction with these pre-import and pre-export \n\nauthorizations.\n\n Pursuant to section 6 of E.O. 13659, DEA and ATF have consulted \n\nwith CBP and are continuing to study whether some modifications or \n\ntechnical changes to their existing regulations are needed to achieve \n\nthe goals of E.O. 13659.\n\nDOJ--CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION (CRT)\n\nProposed Rule Stage\n\n91. Implementation of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (Section 504 of \n\n\n\nthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973)\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: Pub. L. 110-325; 29 U.S.C. 794 (sec 504 of the \n\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended); E.O. 12250 (45 FR 72955; 11/\n\n04/1980)\n\n CFR Citation: 28 CFR 39; 28 CFR 41; 28 CFR 42, subpart G.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract:\n\n This rule would propose to amend the Department's regulations \n\nimplementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, \n\n28 CFR part 39 and part 42, subpart G, and its regulation implementing \n\nExecutive Order 12250, 28 CFR part 41, to reflect statutory amendments \n\nto the definition of disability applicable to section 504 of the \n\nRehabilitation Act, which were enacted in the ADA Amendments Act of \n\n2008, Public Law 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553 (Sep. 25, 2008). The ADA \n\nAmendments Act took effect on January 1, 2009.\n\n The ADA Amendments Act revised 29 U.S.C. 705, to make the \n\ndefinition of disability used in the nondiscrimination provisions in \n\ntitle V of the Rehabilitation Act consistent with the amended ADA \n\nrequirements. These amendments (1) add illustrative lists of ``major \n\nlife activities,'' including ``major bodily functions,'' that provide \n\nmore examples of covered activities and covered conditions than are now \n\ncontained in agency regulations (sec. 3[2]); (2) clarify that a person \n\nwho is ``regarded as'' having a disability does not have to be regarded \n\nas being substantially limited in a major life activity (sec. 3[3]); \n\nand (3) add rules of construction regarding the definition of \n\ndisability that provide guidance in applying the term ``substantially \n\nlimits'' and prohibit consideration of mitigating measures in \n\ndetermining whether a person has a disability (sec. 3[4]).\n\n The Department anticipates that these changes will be published for \n\ncomment in a proposed rule within the next 12 months. During the \n\ndrafting of these revisions, the Department will also review the \n\ncurrently published rules to ensure that any other legal requirements \n\nunder the Rehabilitation Act have been properly addressed in these \n\nregulations.\n\n Statement of Need: This rule is necessary to bring the Department's \n\nprior section 504 regulations into compliance with the ADA Amendments \n\nAct of 2008, which became effective on January 1, 2009.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The summary of the legal basis of authority \n\n\n\nfor this regulation is set forth above in the abstract.\n\n Alternatives: Because this NPRM implements statutory changes to the \n\nsection 504 definition of disability, there are no appropriate \n\nalternatives to issuing this NPRM.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The Department's preliminary \n\nassessment in this early stage of the rulemaking process is that this \n\nrule will not be ``economically significant,'' that is, that the rule \n\nwill not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million, or \n\nadversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the \n\neconomy, the environment, public health or safety or State, local or \n\ntribal Governments or communities. The Department's section 504 rule \n\nwill incorporate the same changes made by the ADA Amendments Act to the \n\ndefinition of disability as are included in the proposed changes to the \n\nADA title II and title III rules (1190-AA59), which will be published \n\nin the Federal Register in the near future. Therefore, we do not \n\nbelieve that the revisions to the Department's existing section 504 \n\nfederally assisted regulations will have any additional economic \n\nimpact, because public and private entities that receive federal \n\nfinancial assistance from the Department are also likely to be subject \n\nto titles II or III of the ADA. The Department expects to consider \n\nfurther the economic impact of the proposed rule on the Department's \n\nexisting section 504 federally conducted regulations, but anticipates \n\nthat the rule will not be economically significant within the meaning \n\nof Executive Order 12866. This is because the revisions to these \n\nregulations will only apply to the Department's programs and activities \n\nand how those programs and activities are operated so as to ensure \n\ncompliance with the nondiscrimination requirements of section 504. In \n\nthe NPRM, the Department will be soliciting public comment in response \n\nto its initial assessment of the impact of the proposed rule.\n\n Risks: Failure to update the Department's section 504 regulations \n\nto conform to statutory changes will interfere with the Department's \n\nenforcement efforts and lead to confusion about the law's requirements \n\namong entities that receive Federal financial assistance from the \n\nDepartment or who participate in its federally conducted programs.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 05/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Governmental Jurisdictions.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Local, State.\n\n Federalism: Undetermined.\n\n Agency Contact: Rebecca B.

Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability; Accessibility of Web \n\nInformation and Services of Public Accommodations\n\n Priority: Economically Significant. Major under 5 U.S.C. 801.\n\n Legal Authority: 42 U.S.C. 12101, et seq.\n\n CFR Citation: 28 CFR 36.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: The Department of Justice is considering proposed \n\nrevisions to the regulation implementing title III of the Americans \n\nwith Disabilities Act (ADA) in order to address the obligations of \n\npublic accommodations to make goods, services, facilities, privileges, \n\naccommodations, or advantages they offer via the Internet, specifically \n\nat sites on the World Wide Web (Web), accessible to individuals with \n\ndisabilities. The ADA requires that public accommodations provide \n\nindividuals with disabilities with full and equal enjoyment of their \n\ngoods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and \n\naccommodations. 42. U.S.C. 12182. The Internet as it is known today did \n\nnot exist when Congress enacted the ADA. Today the Internet, most \n\nnotably the sites on the Web, plays a critical role in the daily \n\npersonal, professional, and business life of most Americans. \n\nIncreasingly, private entities of all types are providing goods and \n\nservices to the public through Web sites that operate as places of \n\npublic accommodation under title III of the ADA. Many Web sites of \n\npublic accommodations, however, render use by individuals with \n\ndisabilities difficult or impossible due to barriers posed by Web sites \n\ndesigned without accessible features. Being unable to access Web sites \n\nputs individuals with disabilities at a great disadvantage in today's \n\nsociety, which is driven by a global marketplace and unprecedented \n\naccess to information. On the economic front, electronic commerce, or \n\n``e-commerce,'' often offers consumers a wider selection and lower \n\nprices than traditional ``brick-and-mortar'' storefronts, with the \n\n\n\nadded convenience of not having to leave one's home to obtain goods and \n\nservices. Beyond goods and services, information available on the \n\nInternet has become a gateway to education. Schools at all levels are \n\nincreasingly offering programs and classroom instruction through Web \n\nsites. Many colleges and universities offer degree programs online; \n\nsome universities exist exclusively on the Internet. The Internet also \n\nis changing the way individuals socialize and seek entertainment. \n\nSocial networks and other online meeting places provide a unique way \n\nfor individuals to meet and fraternize. These networks allow \n\nindividuals to meet others with similar interests and connect with \n\nfriends, business colleagues, elected officials, and businesses. They \n\nalso provide an effective networking opportunity for entrepreneurs, \n\nartists, and others seeking to put their skills and talents to use. Web \n\nsites also bring a myriad of entertainment and information options for \n\nInternet users-from games and music to news and videos. The ADA's \n\npromise to provide an equal opportunity for individuals with \n\ndisabilities to participate in and benefit from all aspects of American \n\ncivic and economic life will be achieved in today's technologically \n\nadvanced society only if it is clear to businesses, educators, and \n\nother public accommodations, that their Web sites must be accessible. \n\nConsequently, the Department is proposing to amend its title III \n\nregulation to expressly address the obligations of public \n\naccommodations to make the Web sites they use to provide their goods \n\nand services to the public accessible to and usable by individuals with \n\ndisabilities under the legal framework established by the ADA. The \n\nproposed regulation will propose the scope of the obligation to provide \n\naccessibility when persons with disabilities attempt to access Web \n\nsites of public accommodations, as well as propose the technical \n\nstandards necessary to comply with the ADA.\n\n Statement of Need: Many people with disabilities use ``assistive \n\ntechnology'' to enable them to use computers and access the Internet. \n\nIndividuals who are blind or have low vision who cannot see computer \n\nmonitors may use screen readers--devices that speak the text that would \n\nnormally appear on a monitor. People who have difficulty using a \n\ncomputer mouse can use voice recognition software to control their \n\ncomputers with verbal commands. People with other types of disabilities \n\nmay use still other kinds of assistive technology. New and innovative \n\nassistive technologies are being introduced every day. Web sites that \n\ndo not accommodate assistive technology, for example, can create \n\nunnecessary barriers for people with disabilities, just as buildings \n\nnot designed to accommodate individuals with disabilities can prevent \n\n\n\nsome individuals from entering and accessing services. Web designers \n\nmay not realize how simple features built into a Web site will assist \n\nsomeone who, for instance, cannot see a computer monitor or use a \n\nmouse. In addition, in many cases, these Web sites do not provide \n\ncaptioning for videos or live events streamed over the Web, leaving \n\npersons who are deaf or hard of hearing unable to access the \n\ninformation that is being provided. Although the Department has been \n\nclear that the ADA applies to Web sites of private entities that meet \n\nthe definition of ``public accommodations,'' inconsistent court \n\ndecisions, differing standards for determining Web accessibility, and \n\nrepeated calls for Department action indicate remaining uncertainty \n\nregarding the applicability of the ADA to Web sites of entities covered \n\nby title III. For these reasons, the Department plans to propose \n\namendments to its regulation so as to make clear to entities covered by \n\nthe ADA their obligations to make their Web sites accessible. Despite \n\nthe need for action, the Department appreciates the need to move \n\nforward deliberatively. Any regulations the Department adopts must \n\nprovide specific guidance to help ensure Web access to individuals with \n\ndisabilities without hampering innovation and technological advancement \n\non the Web.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The ADA requires that public accommodations \n\nprovide individuals with disabilities with full and equal enjoyment of \n\ntheir goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and \n\naccommodations. 42. U.S.C. 12182. Increasingly, private entities of all \n\ntypes are providing goods and services to the public through Web sites \n\nthat operate as places of public accommodation under title III of the \n\nADA.\n\n Alternatives: The Department intends to consider various \n\nalternatives for ensuring full access to Web sites of public \n\naccommodations, including alternative implementation schedules and \n\ntechnical requirements applicable to certain Web features or based on a \n\ncovered entity's size. The Department will solicit public comment \n\naddressing its proposed alternatives.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The Department anticipates that this \n\nrule will be ``economically significant.'' The Department believes that \n\nrevising its title III rule to clarify the obligations of public \n\naccommodations to provide accessible Web sites will significantly \n\nincrease the opportunities of individuals with disabilities to access \n\nthe variety of goods and services public accommodations offer on the \n\n\n\nWeb, while increasing the number of customers that access the Web sites \n\nto procure the goods and services offered by these public \n\naccommodations. In drafting this NPRM, the Department will attempt to \n\nminimize the compliance costs to public accommodations, while ensuring \n\nthe benefits of compliance to\n\n[[Page 76570]]\n\npersons with disabilities. At this stage in the process, the Department \n\nis not yet able to provide a preliminary estimate of costs and \n\nbenefits.\n\n Risks: If the Department does not revise its ADA title III \n\nregulations to address Web site accessibility, persons with \n\ndisabilities will continue to be unable to access the many goods and \n\nservices of public accommodations available on the Web to individuals \n\nwithout disabilities.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nANPRM............................... 07/26/10 75 FR 43460\n\nANPRM Comment Period End............ 01/24/11 .......................\n\nNPRM................................ 06/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Undetermined.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Additional Information: See also RIN 1190-AA65 which was split from \n\nthis RIN of 1190-AA61.\n\n Agency Contact: Rebecca B.

Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability; Movie Captioning and \n\nAudio Description\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 42 U.S.C. 12101, et seq.\n\n CFR Citation: 28 CFR 36.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: Following its advance notice of proposed rulemaking \n\n\n\npublished on July 26, 2010, the Department plans to publish a proposed \n\nrule addressing the requirements for captioning and video description \n\nof movies exhibited in movie theatres under title III of the Americans \n\nwith Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). Title III prohibits discrimination \n\non the basis of disability in the activities of places of public \n\naccommodation (private entities whose operations affect commerce and \n\nthat fall into one of twelve categories listed in the ADA). 42 U.S.C. \n\n12181-12189. Title III makes it unlawful for places of public \n\naccommodation, such as movie theaters, to discriminate against \n\nindividuals with disabilities in the full and equal enjoyment of the \n\ngoods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations \n\nof a place of public accommodation (42 U.S.C. 12182[a]). Moreover, \n\ntitle III prohibits places of public accommodation from affording an \n\nunequal or lesser service to individuals or classes of individuals with \n\ndisabilities than is offered to other individuals (42 U.S.C. \n\n12182(b)(1)(A)(ii)). Title III requires places of public accommodation \n\nto take ``such steps as may be necessary to ensure that no individual \n\nwith a disability is excluded, denied services, segregated or otherwise \n\ntreated differently because of the absence of auxiliary aids and \n\nservices, such as captioning and video description, unless the entity \n\ncan demonstrate that taking such steps would fundamentally alter the \n\nnature of the good, service, facility, privilege, advantage, or \n\naccommodation being offered or would result in an undue burden,'' (42 \n\nU.S.C. 12182(b)(2)(A)(iii)).\n\n Statement of Need: A significant-and increasing-proportion of \n\nAmericans have hearing or vision disabilities that prevent them from \n\nfully and effectively understanding movies without captioning or audio \n\ndescription. For persons with hearing and vision disabilities, the \n\nunavailability of captioned or audio-described movies inhibits their \n\nability to socialize and fully take part in family outings and deprives \n\nthem of the opportunity to meaningfully participate in an important \n\naspect of American culture. Many individuals with hearing or vision \n\ndisabilities who commented on the Department's 2010 ANPRM remarked that \n\nthey have not been able to enjoy a commercial movie unless they watched \n\nit on TV, or that when they took their children to the movies they \n\ncould not understand what they were seeing or discuss what was \n\nhappening with their children. Today, more and more movies are produced \n\nwith captions and audio description. However, despite the underlying \n\nADA obligation, the advancement of digital technology and the \n\navailability of captioned and audio-described films, many movie \n\ntheaters are still not exhibiting captioned or audio-described movies, \n\nand when they do exhibit them, they are only for a few showings of a \n\nmovie, and usually at off-times. Recently, a number of theater \n\n\n\ncompanies have committed to provide greater availability of captioning \n\nand audio description. In some cases, these have been nationwide \n\ncommitments; in other cases it has only been in a particular State or \n\nlocality. A uniform Federal ADA requirement for captioning and audio \n\ndescription is necessary to ensure that access to movies for persons \n\nwith hearing and vision disabilities is not dictated by the \n\nindividual's residence or the presence of litigation in their locality. \n\nIn addition, the movie theater industry is in the process of converting \n\nits movie screens to use digital technology, and the Department \n\nbelieves that it will be extremely helpful to provide timely guidance \n\non the ADA requirements for captioning and audio description so that \n\nthe industry may factor this into its conversion efforts and minimize \n\ncosts.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The summary of the legal basis of authority \n\nfor this regulation is set forth above in the abstract.\n\n Alternatives: The Department will consider any public comments that \n\npropose achievable alternatives that will still accomplish the goal of \n\nproviding access to movies for persons with hearing and vision \n\ndisabilities. However, the Department believes that the baseline \n\nalternative of not providing such access would be inconsistent with the \n\nprovisions of title III of the ADA.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The Department's preliminary \n\nanalysis indicates that the proposed rule would not be ``economically \n\nsignificant,'' that is, that the rule will not have an annual effect on \n\nthe economy of $100 million, or adversely affect in a material way the \n\neconomy, a sector of the economy, the environment, public health or \n\nsafety or State, local or tribal governments or communities. In the \n\nNPRM, the Department will be soliciting public comment in response to \n\nits preliminary analysis regarding the costs imposed by the rule.\n\n Risks: Without the proposed changes to the Department's title III \n\nregulation, persons with hearing and vision disabilities will continue \n\nto be denied access to movies shown in movie theaters and movie theater \n\nowners and operators will not understand what they are required to do \n\nin order to provide auxiliary aids and services to patrons with hearing \n\nand vision disabilities.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nANPRM............................... 07/26/10 75 FR 43467\n\nANPRM Comment Period End............ 01/24/11 .......................\n\nNPRM................................ 08/01/14 79 FR 44975\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 09/08/14 79 FR 53146\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 09/30/14 .......................\n\nNPRM Extended Comment Period End.... 12/01/14 .......................\n\nFinal Action........................ 09/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page 76571]]\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Undetermined.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Agency Contact: Rebecca B.

Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability: Accessibility of Web\n\nInformation and Services of State and Local Governments\n\n Priority: Economically Significant. Major status under 5 U.S.C. 801 \n\nis undetermined.\n\n Legal Authority: 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.\n\n CFR Citation: 28 CFR 35.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: The Department published an ANPRM on July 26, 2010, RIN \n\n1190-AA61, that addressed issues relating to proposed revisions of both \n\nthe title II and title III ADA regulations in order to provide guidance \n\non the obligations of covered entities to make programs, services and \n\nactivities offered over the Web accessible to individuals with \n\ndisabilities. The Department has now divided the rulemakings in the \n\nnext step of the rulemaking process so as to proceed with separate \n\nnotices of proposed rulemakings for title II and title III. The title \n\nIII rulemaking on Web accessibility will continue under RIN 1190-AA61 \n\nand the title II rulemaking will continue under the new RIN 1190-AA65. \n\nThis rulemaking will provide specific guidance to State and local \n\ngovernments in order to make services, programs, or activities offered \n\nto the public via the Web accessible to individuals with disabilities. \n\nThe ADA requires that State and local governments provide qualified \n\nindividuals with disabilities equal access to their programs, services, \n\n\n\nor activities unless doing so would fundamentally alter the nature of \n\ntheir programs, services, or activities or would impose an undue \n\nburden. 42. U.S.C. 12132. The Internet as it is known today did not \n\nexist when Congress enacted the ADA; yet today the Internet is \n\ndramatically changing the way that governmental entities serve the \n\npublic. Taking advantage of new technology, citizens can now use State \n\nand local government Web sites to correspond online with local \n\nofficials; obtain information about government services; renew library \n\nbooks or driver's licenses; pay fines; register to vote; obtain tax \n\ninformation and file tax returns; apply for jobs or benefits; and \n\ncomplete numerous other civic tasks. These Government Web sites are \n\nimportant because they allow programs and services to be offered in a \n\nmore dynamic, interactive way in order to increase citizen \n\nparticipation; increase convenience and speed in obtaining information \n\nor services; reduce costs in providing information about Government \n\nservices and administering programs; reduce the amount of paperwork; \n\nand expand the possibilities of reaching new sectors of the community \n\nor offering new programs or services. Many States and localities have \n\nbegun to improve the accessibility of portions of their Web sites. \n\nHowever, full compliance with the ADA's promise to provide an equal \n\nopportunity for individuals with disabilities to participate in and \n\nbenefit from all aspects of the programs, services, and activities \n\nprovided by State and local governments in today's technologically \n\nadvanced society will only occur if it is clear to public entities that \n\ntheir Web sites must be accessible. Consequently, the Department \n\nintends to publish a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to amend its \n\ntitle II regulations to expressly address the obligations of public \n\nentities to make the Web sites they use to provide programs, \n\nactivities, or services or information to the public accessible to and \n\nusable by individuals with disabilities under the legal framework \n\nestablished by the ADA. The proposed regulation will propose the scope \n\nof the obligation to provide accessibility when persons with \n\ndisabilities access public Web sites, as well as propose the technical \n\nstandards necessary to comply with the ADA.\n\n Statement of Need: Many people with disabilities use ``assistive \n\ntechnology'' to enable them to use computers and access the Internet. \n\nIndividuals who are blind or have low vision who cannot see computer \n\nmonitors may use screen readers--devices that speak the text that would \n\nnormally appear on a monitor. People who have difficulty using a \n\ncomputer mouse can use voice recognition software to control their \n\ncomputers with verbal commands. People with other types of disabilities \n\n\n\nmay use still other kinds of assistive technology. New and innovative \n\nassistive technologies are being introduced every day.\n\n Web sites that do not accommodate assistive technology, for \n\nexample, can create unnecessary barriers for people with disabilities, \n\njust as buildings not designed to accommodate people with disabilities \n\nprevent some individuals from entering and accessing services. Web \n\ndesigners may not realize how simple features built into a Web site \n\nwill assist someone who, for instance, cannot see a computer monitor or \n\nuse a mouse. In addition, in many cases, these Web sites do not provide \n\ncaptioning for videos or live events streamed over the web, leaving \n\npersons who are deaf or hard of hearing unable to access the \n\ninformation that is being provided. Although an increasing number of \n\nState and local Governments are making efforts to provide accessible \n\nWeb sites, because there are no specific ADA standards for Web site \n\naccessibility, these Web sites vary in actual usability.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The ADA requires that State and local \n\nGovernments provide qualified individuals with disabilities equal \n\naccess to their programs, services, or activities unless doing so would \n\nfundamentally alter the nature of their programs, services, or \n\nactivities or would impose an undue burden. 42. U.S.C. 12132.\n\n Alternatives: The Department intends to consider various \n\nalternatives for ensuring full access to Web sites of State and local \n\nGovernments and will solicit public comment addressing these \n\nalternatives.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The Department anticipates that this \n\nrule will be ``economically significant,'' that is, that the rule will \n\nhave an annual effect on the economy of $100 million, or adversely \n\naffect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, the \n\nenvironment, public health or safety or State, local or tribal \n\nGovernments or communities. However, the Department believes that \n\nrevising its title II rule to clarify the obligations of State and \n\nlocal Governments to provide accessible Web sites will significantly \n\nincrease the opportunities for citizens with disabilities to \n\nparticipate in, and benefit from, State and local Government programs, \n\nactivities, and services. It will also ensure that individuals have \n\naccess to important information that is provided over the Internet, \n\nincluding emergency information. The Department also believes that \n\nproviding accessible Web sites will benefit State and local Governments \n\nas it will increase the numbers of citizens who can use these Web \n\n\n\nsites, and thus improve the efficiency of delivery of services to the \n\npublic. In drafting this NPRM, the Department will attempt to minimize \n\nthe compliance costs to State and local Governments while ensuring the \n\nbenefits of compliance to persons with disabilities.\n\n[[Page 76572]]\n\n Risks: If the Department does not revise its ADA title II \n\nregulations to address Web site accessibility, persons with \n\ndisabilities in many communities will continue to be unable to access \n\ntheir State and local governmental services in the same manner \n\navailable to citizens without disabilities, and in some cases will not \n\nbe able to access those services at all.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nANPRM............................... 07/26/10 75 FR 43460\n\nANPRM Comment Period End............ 01/21/11 .......................\n\nNPRM................................ 12/00/14 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Undetermined.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Governmental Jurisdictions.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Local, State.\n\n Federalism: Undetermined.\n\n Additional Information: Split from RIN 1190-AA61.\n\n Agency Contact: Rebecca B.

Implementation of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (Title II and \n\nTitle III of The ADA)\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: Pub. L. 110-325; 42 U.S.C. 12134(a); 42 U.S.C. \n\n12186(b)\n\n CFR Citation: 28 CFR 35; 28 CFR 36.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: This rule would propose to amend the Department's \n\nregulations implementing title II and title III of the Americans with \n\n\n\nDisabilities Act (ADA), 28 CFR part 35 and 28 CFR part 36, to implement \n\nchanges to the ADA enacted in the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Public \n\nLaw 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553 (Sept. 25, 2008). The ADA Amendments Act \n\ntook effect on January 1, 2009.\n\n The ADA Amendments Act amended the Americans with Disabilities Act, \n\n42 U.S.C. 12101, et seq., to clarify terms within the definition of \n\ndisability and to establish standards that must be applied to determine \n\nif a person has a covered disability. These changes are intended to \n\nmitigate the effects of the Supreme Court's decisions in Sutton v. \n\nUnited Airlines, 527 U.S. 471 (1999), and Toyota Motor Manufacturing v. \n\nWilliams, 534, U.S. 184 (2002). Specifically, the ADA Amendments Act \n\n(1) adds illustrative lists of ``major life activities,'' including \n\n``major bodily functions,'' that provide more examples of covered \n\nactivities and covered conditions than are now contained in agency \n\nregulations (sec. 3[2]); (2) clarifies that a person who is ``regarded \n\nas'' having a disability does not have to be regarded as being \n\nsubstantially limited in a major life activity (sec. 3[3]); and (3) \n\nadds rules of construction regarding the definition of disability that \n\nprovide guidance in applying the term ``substantially limits'' and \n\nprohibit consideration of mitigating measures in determining whether a \n\nperson has a disability (sec. 3[4]).\n\n Statement of Need: This rule is necessary to bring the Department's \n\nADA regulations into compliance with the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, \n\nwhich became effective on January 1, 2009. In addition, this rule is \n\nnecessary to make the Department's ADA title II and title III \n\nregulations consistent with the ADA title I regulations issued on March \n\n25, 2011 by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) \n\nincorporating the ADA Amendments Act definition of disability.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The summary of the legal basis of authority \n\nfor this regulation is set forth above in the abstract.\n\n Alternatives: In order to ensure consistency in application of the \n\nADA Amendments Act across titles I, II and III of the ADA, this rule is \n\nintended to be consistent with the language of the EEOC's rule \n\nimplementing the ADA Amendments Act with respect to title I of the ADA \n\n(employment). The Department will, however, consider alternative \n\nregulatory language suggested by commenters so long as it maintains \n\nthat consistency.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits:\n\n The Department's preliminary analysis indicates that the proposed \n\n\n\nrule would not be ``economically significant,'' that is, the rule will \n\nnot have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million, or adversely \n\naffect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, the \n\nenvironment, public health or safety or State, local or tribal \n\ngovernments or communities. According to the Department's preliminary \n\nanalysis, it is anticipated that the rule will cost between $36.32 \n\nmillion and $61.8 million in the first year (the year with the highest \n\ncosts). The Department estimates that in the first year of the \n\nimplementation of the proposed rule, approximately 142,000 students \n\nwill take advantage of additional testing accommodations than otherwise \n\nwould have been able to without the changes made to the definition of \n\ndisability to conform to the ADA Amendments Act. The Department \n\nbelieves that this will result in benefits for many of these \n\nindividuals in the form of significantly higher earnings potential. The \n\nDepartment expects that the rule will also have significant non-\n\nquantifiable benefits to persons with newly covered disabilities in \n\nother contexts, such as benefits of non-exclusion from the programs, \n\nservices and activities of State and local governments and public \n\naccommodations, and the benefits of access to reasonable modifications \n\nof policies, practices and procedures to meet their needs in a variety \n\nof contexts. In this NPRM, the Department will be soliciting public \n\ncomment in response to its preliminary analysis.\n\n Risks: The ADA authorizes the Attorney General to enforce the ADA \n\nand to promulgate regulations implementing the law's requirements. \n\nFailure to update the Department's regulations to conform to statutory \n\nchanges and to be consistent with the EEOC regulations under title I of \n\nthe ADA will interfere with the Department's enforcement efforts and \n\nlead to confusion about the law's requirements among entities covered \n\nby titles I, II and III of the ADA, as well as members of the public.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 01/30/14 79 FR 4839\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 03/31/14\n\nFinal Action........................ 03/00/15\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Governmental Jurisdictions.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Local, State.\n\n Agency Contact: Rebecca B.

The Department's Fall 2014 Regulatory Agenda is driven by a \n\ncommitment to the basic bargain of America--if you work hard and play \n\nby the rules and take responsibility for yourself and your family, you \n\ncan succeed in and climb the rungs of the middle class. There are many \n\ncomponents to Secretary Thomas E. Perez's opportunity agenda that are \n\nreflected in the Department's regulatory agenda:\n\n training more people, including veterans and people with \n\ndisabilities, to have the skills they need for the in-demand jobs of \n\nthe 21st century;\n\n ensuring that people have the peace of mind that comes \n\nwith access to health care, retirement, and Federal workers' \n\ncompensation benefits when they need them;\n\n safeguarding a fair day's pay for a fair day's work for \n\nall hardworking Americans, regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual \n\norientation, or gender identity;\n\n giving workers a voice in their workplaces; and\n\n protecting the safety and health of workers so they do not \n\nhave to risk their lives for a paycheck.\n\n The values embodied in the Department's regulatory agenda are \n\nAmerica's values. In developing the Department's regulatory agenda, \n\nwith a focus on strengthening our economy, the Department has sought \n\ninput and expertise from a broad cross section of American society, \n\nincluding business leaders, workers, labor organizations, academics and \n\nstate and local officials. Expanding opportunity benefits all of us. \n\nWhen the middle class is strong, our nation is strong.\n\n The Fall 2014 Regulatory Agenda reflects the Department's \n\ncommitment to rebuilding this strength through expanding opportunity.\n\nThe Department's Regulatory Priorities\n\n The Department of Labor 2014 Regulatory Plan highlights the most \n\n\n\nnoteworthy and significant regulatory projects that will be undertaken \n\nby its regulatory agencies: the Employee Benefits Security \n\nAdministration (EBSA), Employment and Training Administration (ETA), \n\nMine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), Office of Federal \n\nContract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), Occupational Safety and Health \n\nAdministration (OSHA), Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS), \n\nOffice of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP), Veterans' Employment \n\nService (VETS), and Wage and Hour Division (WHD). The initiatives and \n\npriorities listed in the regulatory plan exemplify the five components \n\nof the Secretary's opportunity agenda.\n\nTraining More People for Twenty-First Century Jobs\n\n The Department's regulatory priorities reflect the Secretary's \n\nvision for a demand-driven workforce investment system that serves the \n\nneeds of businesses and workers alike. For example:\n\n ETA seeks to develop and issue a Notice of Proposed \n\nRulemaking (NPRM) that implements the important changes made to the \n\npublic workforce system by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act \n\n(WIOA) (Pub. L. 113-128), which was signed by the President on July 22, \n\n2014, replacing the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA). This NPRM \n\nwill help the Department implement WIOA, empowering the public \n\nworkforce system and its partners to increase employment, retention, \n\nand earnings of participants, meet the skill requirements of employers, \n\nand enhance the productivity and competitiveness of the nation.\\1\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\1\\ Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (RIN: 1205-AB73).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n ETA also proposes to update the National Apprenticeship \n\nAct of 1937's equal opportunity regulations, which prohibit \n\ndiscrimination in registered apprenticeship on the basis of race, \n\ncolor, religion, national origin, and sex, and which require that \n\nprogram sponsors take affirmative action to provide equal opportunity. \n\nMost notably, the proposed rule would update equal opportunity \n\nstandards to include age (40 and older) and disability among the list \n\nof protected bases. It would also strengthen the affirmative action \n\nprovisions by detailing mandatory actions that sponsors must take, and \n\nby requiring affirmative action for individuals with disabilities.\\2\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\2\\ Equal Employment Opportunity in Apprenticeship Amendment of \n\nRegulations (RIN: 1205-AB59).\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEnsuring Access to Health Care, Retirement, and Workers' Compensation \n\nBenefits\n\n The Department is pursuing a regulatory program that is designed to \n\nsafeguard the retirement security of participants and beneficiaries by \n\nprotecting their rights and benefits under pension plans and by \n\nencouraging, fostering, and promoting openness, transparency, and \n\ncommunication with respect to the management and operations of such \n\nplans. Examples include:\n\n EBSA's rulemaking to help assure workers' retirement \n\nsecurity by reducing harmful conflicts of interest in the retirement \n\nsavings marketplace so that the millions of plan sponsors, workers, and \n\nretirees get the impartial advice they have a right to expect when they \n\nrely on an adviser to help them invest their retirement savings. The \n\nregulation would clarify the circumstances under which a person will be \n\nconsidered a ``fiduciary'' when providing investment advice related to \n\nretirement plans, individual retirement accounts, and other employee \n\nbenefit plans, and to participants, beneficiaries, and owners of such \n\nplans and accounts.\\3\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\3\\ Conflict of Interest Rule: Investment Advice (RIN: 1210-\n\nAB32).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n EBSA continues to pursue initiatives to encourage the \n\noffering of lifetime annuities or similar lifetime benefit distribution \n\noptions for participants and beneficiaries of defined contribution \n\nplans. EBSA is developing a proposal relating to the presentation of a \n\nparticipant's accrued benefits (account balance) as a lifetime income \n\nstream of payments.\\4\\ EBSA is also developing proposed amendments to a \n\nsafe harbor regulation that will provide plan fiduciaries with more \n\ncertainty that they have discharged their obligations under section \n\n404(a)(1)(B) of ERISA in selecting an annuity plan provider and \n\ncontract for benefit distributions from an individual account \n\nretirement plan.\\5\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\4\\ Pension Benefit Statement (RIN 1210-AB20).\n\n \\5\\ Selection of Annuity Providers--Safe Harbor for Individual \n\nAccount Plans (RIN: 1201-AB58).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n EBSA's regulatory program also includes initiatives involving \n\nAnnual Funding Notices \\6\\ and Standards for Brokerage Windows.\\7\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\6\\ (RIN: 1210-AB18).\n\n \\7\\ (RIN: 1210-AB59).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n In addition, EBSA will continue to issue guidance implementing the \n\nhealth reform provisions of the Affordable Care Act to help provide \n\nbetter quality health care for America's workers and their families. \n\nEBSA's regulations reduce discrimination in health coverage, promote \n\nbetter access to quality coverage, and protect the ability of \n\nindividuals and businesses to keep their current health coverage. Many \n\nregulations are joint rulemakings with the Departments of Health and \n\nHuman Services and the Treasury.\n\n[[Page 76574]]\n\n The Department also pursues regulations to ensure that Federal \n\nworkers' compensation benefits programs are fairly administered:\n\n OWCP plans to propose several modifications and \n\nclarifications to the regulations implementing the Black Lung Benefits \n\nAct, including a rule that addresses claimants' and coal mine \n\noperators' responsibility to disclose medical evidence developed in \n\nconnection with a claim for benefits. In addition, the proposed \n\nregulation would make several clarifications regarding reimbursement \n\nrates for medical treatment, the modification procedure, evidence-\n\nsubmission limits, and compensation payments.\\8\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\8\\ Black Lung Benefits Act: Medical Evidence and Benefit \n\nPayments (RIN: 1240-AA10).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSafeguarding Fair Pay for All Americans\n\n The Department's regulatory agenda prioritizes ensuring that all \n\nAmericans receive a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, and are not \n\ndiscriminated against with respect to hiring, employment, or benefits \n\non the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity. \n\nFor example, WHD recently published a Final Rule to implement Executive \n\nOrder 13658, which the President signed in February 2014 to ensure that \n\ncertain Federal contractors pay a minimum wage of at least $10.10 per \n\nhour beginning on January 1, 2015. Other notable proposals include:\n\n WHD plans to publish an NPRM proposing revisions to the \n\n\n\nFair Labor Standards Act's (FLSA's) overtime exemptions as directed by \n\na March 2014 Presidential Memorandum. The FLSA generally requires \n\ncovered employers to pay their employees at least the Federal minimum \n\nwage for all hours worked, and one-and-one-half times their regular \n\nrate of pay for hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek \n\n(``overtime''). However, there are a number of exemptions from the \n\nFLSA's minimum wage and overtime requirements, including an exemption \n\nfor bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employees. The \n\nPresident's Memorandum directed the Secretary to modernize and \n\nstreamline the existing overtime regulations for these ``white collar'' \n\nemployees to ensure that hardworking middle-class workers are not \n\ndenied overtime protections that Congress intended.\\9\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\9\\ Defining and Delimiting the Exemptions for Executive, \n\nAdministrative, Professional, Outside Sales, and Computer Employees \n\n(RIN: 1235-AA11).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n WHD also plans to publish a Final Rule revising the \n\ndefinition of ``spouse'' in the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) in \n\nlight of the United States Supreme Court's decision in United States v. \n\nWindsor. This Department previously issued an NPRM proposing that \n\neligible employees in legal same-sex marriages may take unpaid, job-\n\nprotected leave to care for their spouse or family member, regardless \n\nof whether their state of residence recognizes their same-sex \n\nmarriage.\\10\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\10\\ Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, as amended (RIN: \n\n1235-AA09).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n OFCCP's rulemaking implementing Executive Order 13672, \n\nsigned by the President in July 2014 to amend Executive Order 11246, \n\nensures that Federal contractors do not engage in hiring or employment \n\ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The \n\nExecutive Order required the Department to prepare regulations within \n\n90 days of the date of the Order to insert ``sexual orientation, gender \n\nidentity'' into identified paragraphs of section 2 of Executive Order \n\n11246.\\11\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\11\\ Implementation of Executive Order 13672 Prohibiting \n\nDiscrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity by \n\nContractors and Subcontractors (RIN: 1250-AA07).\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n OFCCP plans to issue a Final Rule pursuant to a \n\nPresidential Memorandum directing the Department to require Federal \n\ncontractors and subcontractors to submit summary data on the \n\ncompensation paid to their employees. The use of this sort of ``Equal \n\nPay Report'' is one component of a larger strategy to address the \n\nreality that, despite five decades of extraordinary legal and social \n\nprogress, working women still earn only 78 cents for every dollar that \n\nworking men earn, and the amount is even less for African American \n\nwomen and Latinas. The new rule will enable OFCCP to direct its \n\nenforcement resources toward Federal contractors whose summary data \n\nindicate potential pay disparities, while reducing the likelihood of \n\nreviewing companies that are in compliance with anti-discrimination \n\nlaws.\\12\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\12\\ Requirement to Report Summary Data on Employee Compensation \n\n(RIN: 1250-AA03).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n OFCCP also continues to pursue an initiative on Construction \n\nContractor Affirmative Action Requirements.\\13\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\13\\ (RIN: 1250-AA01).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGiving Workers a Voice in Their Workplaces\n\n The Department's regulatory program also promotes policies that \n\ngive workers a voice in their workplaces, including by ensuring that \n\nworkers have information that is critical to their effective \n\nparticipation in the workplace. Two key examples include:\n\n OFCCP plans to issue a Final Rule implementing Executive \n\nOrder 13665, which the President signed on April 8, 2014, prohibiting \n\ndiscrimination by Federal contractors and subcontractors against \n\ncertain of their employees for disclosing compensation information. \n\nThis Executive Order was intended to address policies inhibiting \n\nworkers' ability to advocate for themselves about their pay and \n\nprohibiting employee conversations about compensation. Such policies \n\ncan serve as a significant barrier to Federal enforcement of the laws \n\nagainst compensation discrimination.\\14\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\14\\ Prohibitions Against Pay Secrecy Policies and Actions (RIN: \n\n\n\n1250-AA06).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n OLMS plans to publish a Final Rule following an NPRM that \n\nproposed regulations to better implement the public disclosure \n\nobjectives of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) \n\nin situations where an employer engages a consultant in order to \n\npersuade employees concerning their rights to organize and bargain \n\ncollectively. Workers are better able to make an informed choice about \n\nrepresentation when they have the necessary information about \n\narrangements that have been made by their employer to persuade them \n\nwhether or not to form, join, or assist a union. While the LMRDA \n\nrequires employers to file reports of any agreement or arrangement with \n\na consultant to persuade employees concerning their rights to organize \n\nand collectively bargain, the statute provides an exception for \n\nconsultants giving or agreeing to give ``advice'' to the employer. The \n\nDepartment's NPRM reconsidered the current policy concerning the scope \n\nof the ``advice'' exception.\\15\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\15\\ Persuader Agreements: Employer and Labor Relations \n\nConsultant Reporting Under the LMRDA (RIN: 1245-AA03).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProtecting the Safety and Health of Workers\n\n The Department's regulatory agenda prioritizes efforts to protect \n\nthe safety and health of workers so they do not have to risk their \n\nlives for a paycheck. These efforts encompass protecting workers in all \n\nworkplaces, including above- and below-ground coal and metal/nonmetal \n\nmines, in addition to efforts to ensure that benefits programs are \n\navailable to workers and their families when they are injured on the \n\njob. Notable examples of these efforts include:\n\n OSHA continues to pursue regulations aimed at curbing lung \n\ncancer, silicosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and kidney \n\ndisease in America's workers by lowering worker exposure to crystalline \n\nsilica, which kills hundreds and sickens thousands more each year. OSHA\n\n[[Page 76575]]\n\nestimates that the proposed rule would ultimately save nearly 700 lives \n\nand prevent 1,600 new cases of silicosis annually. After publishing a \n\nproposed rule in September 2013, OSHA received over 1,700 comments from \n\nthe public on the proposed rule, and over 200 stakeholders provided \n\ntestimony during public hearings on the proposal. In the coming months, \n\n\n\nthe agency will review and consider the evidence in the rulemaking \n\nrecord. Based upon this review, OSHA will determine an appropriate \n\ncourse of action with regard to workplace exposure to respirable \n\ncrystalline silica.\\16\\ As a part of the Secretary's strategy for \n\nsecuring safe and healthy work environments, MSHA will utilize \n\ninformation provided by OSHA to undertake regulatory action related to \n\nsilica exposure in mines.\\17\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\16\\ Occupational Exposure to Crystalline Silica (RIN: 1218-\n\nAB70).\n\n \\17\\ Respirable Crystalline Silica Standard (RIN: 1219-AB36).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n OSHA is considering the need for regulatory action to \n\naddress the risk to workers exposed to infectious diseases in \n\nhealthcare and other related high-risk environments. Especially given \n\nrecent events necessitating the careful treatment of individuals with \n\nlife-threatening infectious diseases, OSHA is concerned about the risk \n\nposed to healthcare workers with the movement of healthcare delivery \n\nfrom the traditional hospital setting into more diverse and smaller \n\nworkplace settings. The Agency initiated the Small Business Regulatory \n\nEnforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) Panel process in the spring of \n\n2014.\\18\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\18\\ Infectious Diseases (RIN: 1218-AC46).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n OSHA is developing a Final Rule exploring a requirement \n\nfor employers to electronically submit data required by agency \n\nregulations governing the Recording and Reporting of Occupational \n\nInjuries. An updated and modernized reporting system would enable a \n\nmore efficient and timely collection of data and would improve the \n\naccuracy and availability of relevant records and statistics, in \n\naddition to leveraging data already maintained electronically by many \n\nlarge employers.\\19\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\19\\ Improve Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses (RIN: \n\n1218-AC49).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n MSHA plans to issue a Final Rule that would build upon a \n\nproposed rule to address the danger that miners face when working near \n\n\n\ncontinuous mining machines in underground coal mines. From 1984 through \n\n2014, there have been 35 fatalities resulting from pinning, crushing or \n\nstriking accidents involving continuous mining machines--the types of \n\naccidents that proximity detection technology can prevent. The proposed \n\nrule would reduce the potential for such hazards.\\20\\ MSHA also plans \n\nto publish a proposed rule that would require underground mine \n\noperators to equip certain mobile machines with proximity detection \n\nsystems.\\21\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\20\\ Proximity Detection Systems for Continuous Mining Machines \n\nin Underground Coal Mines (RIN: 1219-AB65).\n\n \\21\\ Proximity Detection Systems for Mobile Machines in \n\nUnderground Mines (RIN: 1219-AB78).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n OSHA's regulatory program also includes initiatives involving \n\nInjury and Illness Prevention Programs,\\22\\ Occupational Exposure to \n\nBeryllium,\\23\\ Preventing Backover Injuries and Fatalities,\\24\\ and \n\nvarious Whistleblower regulations.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\22\\ (RIN: 1218-AC48).\n\n \\23\\ (RIN: 1218-AB76).\n\n \\24\\ (RIN: 1218-AC51).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRegulatory Review and Burden Reduction\n\n On January 18, 2011, the President issued Executive Order (E.O.) \n\n13563 entitled ``Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review.'' The E.O. \n\naims to strike the right balance between protecting the health, \n\nwelfare, safety, and the environment for all Americans--a goal at the \n\ncore of the Labor Department's mission--while fostering economic \n\ngrowth, job creation, and competitiveness. The Department's Fall 2014 \n\nRegulatory Agenda also aims to achieve more efficient and less \n\nburdensome regulations through a retrospective review of the Labor \n\nDepartment regulations.\n\n In August 2011, as part of a governmentwide response to E.O. 13563, \n\nthe Department published its ``Plan for Retrospective Analysis of \n\nExisting Rules.'' This plan, and each subsequent update, can be found \n\nat www.dol.gov/regulations/.

Major status under 5 U.S.C. 801 is \n\nundetermined.\n\n Unfunded Mandates: Undetermined.\n\n Legal Authority: sec 503(f) of the Workforce Innovation and \n\nOpportunity Act (Pub. L. 113-128)\n\n CFR Citation: Not Yet Determined.\n\n Legal Deadline: NPRM, Statutory, January 18, 2015, Public Law 113-\n\n128.\n\n Final, Statutory, January 18, 2016.\n\n Abstract: On July 22, 2014, the President signed the Workforce \n\nInnovation Opportunity Act (WIOA) (Pub. L. 113-128). WIOA repeals the \n\nWorkforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA). (29 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.) The \n\nDepartment of Labor must develop and issue a Notice of Proposed \n\nRulemaking (NPRM) that proposes to implement the changes WIOA makes to \n\nthe public workforce system in regulations. Through the NPRM, the \n\nDepartment will propose ways to carry out the purposes of WIOA to \n\nprovide workforce investment activities, through State and local \n\nworkforce development systems, that increase employment, retention, and \n\nearnings of participants, meet the skill requirements of employers, and \n\nenhance the productivity and competitiveness of the Nation.\n\n Statement of Need: On July 22, 2014, the President signed the \n\nWorkforce Innovation Opportunity Act (WIOA) (Pub. L. 113-128) into law. \n\nWIOA repeals the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) (29 U.S.C. 2801 \n\net seq.) As a result, the WIA regulations no longer reflect current law \n\nand we must change. Therefore, the Department of Labor seeks to develop \n\nand issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that proposes to \n\nimplement the WIOA.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act \n\n(WIOA) (Pub. L. 113-128), signed by the President on July 22, 2014. \n\nSection 503(f) of WIOA requires that the Department issue a Notice of \n\nProposed Rulemaking (NPRM) and then Final Rule that implements the \n\nchanges WIOA makes to the public workforce system in regulations.\n\n Alternatives: Since Congress statutorily directed the Department of \n\nLabor to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) and Final Rule \n\nthat implements the changes WIOA makes to the public workforce system \n\nthere is no alternative.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Undetermined.\n\n Risks: Undetermined.\n\n Timetable:\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 01/00/15\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Governmental Jurisdictions, \n\nOrganizations.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, Local, State, Tribal.\n\n Federalism: This action may have federalism implications as defined \n\nin EO 13132.\n\n Agency Contact: Portia Wu, Assistant Secretary for Employment and \n\nTraining, Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration, \n\n200 Constitution Avenue NW., FP Building, Washington, DC 20210, Phone: \n\n202 639-2700.\n\n RIN: 1205-AB73\n\nDOL--MINE SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (MSHA)\n\nProposed Rule Stage\n\n97. Respirable Crystalline Silica\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 30 U.S.C. 811\n\n CFR Citation: 30 CFR 58.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: Current standards limit exposures to quartz (crystalline \n\nsilica) in respirable dust. The metal and nonmetal mining industry \n\nstandard is based on the 1973 American Conference of Governmental \n\nIndustrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Values formula: 10 mg/m3 \n\ndivided by the percentage of quartz plus 2. Overexposure to crystalline \n\nsilica can result in some miners developing silicosis, an irreversible \n\nbut preventable lung disease, which ultimately may be fatal. The \n\nformula is designed to limit exposures to 0.1 mg/m3 (100 ug/m3) of \n\nsilica. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health \n\n(NIOSH) recommends a 50 ug/m3 exposure limit for respirable crystalline \n\nsilica. MSHA will publish a proposed rule to address miners' exposure \n\nto respirable crystalline silica.\n\n Statement of Need: MSHA standards are outdated; current regulations \n\nmay not protect workers from developing silicosis. Evidence indicates \n\nthat miners continue to develop silicosis. MSHA's proposed regulatory \n\naction exemplifies the Agency's commitment to protecting the most \n\nvulnerable populations while assuring broad-based compliance. MSHA will \n\n\n\nregulate based on sound science to eliminate or reduce the hazards with \n\nthe broadest and most serious consequences. MSHA intends to use OSHA's \n\nwork on the health effects and risk assessment, adapting it as \n\nnecessary for the mining industry.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Promulgation of this standard is authorized \n\nby section 101 of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.\n\n Alternatives: This rulemaking would improve health protection from \n\nthat afforded by the existing standards. MSHA will consider alternative \n\nmethods of addressing miners' exposures based on the capabilities of \n\nthe sampling and analytical methods.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: MSHA will prepare estimates of the \n\nanticipated costs and benefits associated with the proposed rule.\n\n Risks: For over 70 years, toxicology information and \n\nepidemiological studies have shown that exposure to respirable \n\ncrystalline silica presents potential health risks to miners. These \n\npotential adverse health effects include simple silicosis and \n\nprogressive massive fibrosis (lung scarring). Evidence indicates that \n\nexposure to silica may cause cancer. MSHA believes that the health \n\nevidence forms a reasonable basis for reducing miners' exposures to \n\nrespirable crystalline silica.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 10/00/15\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Undetermined.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Governmental Jurisdictions.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Local, State.\n\n URL for More Information: www.msha.gov/regsinfo.htm.\n\n URL for Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Sheila McConnell, Acting Director, Office of \n\nStandards, Regulations, and Variances, Department of Labor, Mine Safety \n\nand Health Administration, 1100 Wilson Boulevard, Room 2350, Arlington, \n\nVA 22209, Phone: 202 693-9440, Fax: 202 693-9441, Email: \n\nmcconnell.sheila.a@dol.gov\n\n RIN: 1219-AB36\n\nDOL--MSHA\n\n98.

The assessment of civil \n\npenalties is a key component in MSHA's strategy to enforce safety and \n\nhealth standards. The Congress intended that the imposition of civil \n\npenalties would induce mine operators to be proactive in their approach \n\nto mine safety and health, and take necessary action to prevent safety \n\nand health hazards before they occur. MSHA believes that the procedures \n\nfor assessing civil penalties can be revised to improve the efficiency \n\nof the Agency's efforts and to facilitate the resolution of enforcement \n\nissues.\n\n Statement of Need: Section 110(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and \n\nHealth Act of 1977 (Mine Act) requires MSHA to assess a civil penalty \n\nfor a violation of a mandatory health or safety standard or violation \n\nof any provision of the Mine Act. The mine operator has 30 days from \n\nreceipt of the proposed assessment to contest it before the Federal \n\nMine Safety and Health Review Commission (Commission), an independent \n\nadjudicatory agency established under the Mine Act. A proposed \n\nassessment that is not contested within 30 days becomes a final order \n\nof the Commission. A proposed assessment that is contested within 30 \n\ndays proceeds to the Commission for adjudication. The proposed rule \n\nwould promote consistency, objectivity, and efficiency in the proposed \n\nassessment of civil penalties. When issuing citations or orders, \n\ninspectors are required to evaluate safety and health conditions, and \n\nmake decisions about the statutory criteria related to assessing \n\npenalties. The proposed changes in the measures of the evaluation \n\ncriteria would result in fewer areas of disagreement and earlier \n\nresolution of enforcement issues. The proposal would require conforming \n\nchanges to the Mine Citation/Order form (MSHA Form 7000-3).\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Section 104 of the Mine Act requires MSHA \n\nto issue citations or orders to mine operators for any violations of a \n\nmandatory health or safety standard, rule, order, or regulation \n\npromulgated under the Mine Act. Sections 105 and 110 of the Mine Act \n\nprovide for assessment of these penalties.\n\n Alternatives: The proposal would include several alternatives in \n\nthe preamble and requests comments on them.\n\n\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: MSHA's proposed rule includes an \n\nestimate of the anticipated costs and benefits.\n\n Risks: MSHA's existing procedures for assessing civil penalties can \n\nbe revised to improve the efficiency of the Agency's efforts and to \n\nfacilitate the resolution of enforcement issues. In the overwhelming \n\nmajority of contested cases before the Commission, the issue is not \n\nwhether a violation occurred. Rather, the parties disagree on the \n\ngravity of the violation, the degree of mine operator negligence, and \n\nother criterion. The proposed changes should result in fewer areas of \n\ndisagreement and earlier resolution of enforcement issues, which should \n\nresult in fewer contests of violations or proposed assessments.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 07/31/14 79 FR 44494\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 09/29/14 .......................\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 09/16/14 79 FR 55408\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended End.... 12/03/14 .......................\n\nNPRM Notice of Public Hearings, 11/07/14 79 FR 66345\n\n Close of Comment Period.\n\nNPRM Notice of Public Hearings, 01/09/15 .......................\n\n Close of Comment Period End.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Undetermined.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n URL for More Information: www.msha.gov/regsinfo.htm.\n\n URL for Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Sheila McConnell, Acting Director, Office of \n\nStandards, Regulations, and Variances, Department of Labor, Mine Safety \n\nand Health Administration, 1100 Wilson Boulevard, Room 2350, Arlington, \n\nVA 22209, Phone: 202-693-9440, Fax: 202-693-9441, Email: \n\nmcconnell.sheila.a@dol.gov\n\n RIN: 1219-AB72\n\nDOL--MSHA\n\n99.

Health care \n\nworkers and workers in related occupations, or who are exposed in other \n\nhigh-risk environments, are at increased risk of contracting TB, SARS, \n\nMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and other \n\ninfectious diseases that can be transmitted through a variety of \n\nexposure routes. OSHA is concerned about the ability of employees to \n\ncontinue to provide health care and other critical services without \n\nunreasonably jeopardizing their health. OSHA is considering the need \n\nfor a standard to ensure that employers establish a comprehensive \n\ninfection control program and control measures to protect employees \n\nfrom infectious disease exposures to pathogens that can cause \n\nsignificant disease. Workplaces where such control measures might be \n\nnecessary include: Health care, emergency response, correctional \n\nfacilities, homeless shelters, drug treatment programs, and other \n\noccupational settings where employees can be at increased risk of \n\nexposure to potentially infectious people. A standard could also apply \n\nto laboratories, which handle materials that may be a source of \n\npathogens, and to pathologists, coroners' offices, medical examiners, \n\nand mortuaries.\n\n Statement of Need: In 2007, the healthcare and social assistance \n\nsector as a whole had 16.5 million employees. Healthcare workplaces can \n\nrange from small private practices of physicians to hospitals that \n\nemploy thousands of workers. In addition, healthcare is increasingly \n\nbeing provided in other settings such as nursing homes, free-standing \n\nsurgical and outpatient centers, emergency care clinics, patients' \n\nhomes, and prehospitalization emergency care settings. The Agency is \n\nparticularly concerned by studies that indicate that transmission of \n\ninfectious diseases to both patients and healthcare workers may be \n\noccurring as a result of incomplete adherence to recognized, but \n\nvoluntary, infection control measures. Another concern is the movement \n\nof healthcare delivery from the traditional hospital setting, with its \n\ngreater infrastructure and resources to effectively implement infection \n\ncontrol measures, into more diverse and smaller workplace settings with \n\nless infrastructure and fewer resources, but with an expanding worker \n\npopulation.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n\n\n\n1970 authorizes the Secretary of Labor to set mandatory occupational \n\nsafety and health standards to assure safe and healthful working \n\nconditions for working men and women (29 U.S.C. 651).\n\n Alternatives: The alternative to the proposed rulemaking would be \n\nto take no regulatory action.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The estimates of the costs and \n\nbenefits are still under development.\n\n Risks: Analysis of risks is still under development.\n\n[[Page 76579]]\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRequest for Information (RFI)....... 05/06/10 75 FR 24835\n\nRFI Comment Period End.............. 08/04/10 .......................\n\nAnalyze Comments.................... 12/30/10 .......................\n\nStakeholder Meetings................ 07/29/11 .......................\n\nInitiate SBREFA..................... 06/04/14 .......................\n\nComplete SBREFA..................... 12/00/14 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Governmental Jurisdictions.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Local, State.\n\n Federalism: Undetermined.\n\n Agency Contact: William Perry, Director, Directorate of Standards \n\nand Guidance, Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health \n\nAdministration, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Room N-3718, Washington, \n\nDC 20210, Phone: 202 693-1950, Fax: 202 693-1678, Email: \n\nperry.bill@dol.gov\n\n RIN: 1218-AC46\n\nDOL--OSHA\n\nProposed Rule Stage\n\n102.

Chronic silicosis is a uniquely occupational \n\ndisease resulting from exposure of employees over long periods of time \n\n(10 years or more). Exposure to high levels of respirable crystalline \n\nsilica causes acute or accelerated forms of silicosis that are \n\nultimately fatal. The current OSHA permissible exposure limit (PEL) for \n\ngeneral industry is based on a formula proposed by the American \n\nConference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) in 1968 (PEL = \n\n10mg/cubic meter/(% silica + 2), as respirable dust). The current PEL \n\nfor construction and shipyards (derived from ACGIH's 1970 Threshold \n\nLimit Value) is based on particle counting technology, which is \n\nconsidered obsolete. NIOSH and ACGIH recommend 50[mu]g/m3 and 25[mu]g/\n\nm3 exposure limits, respectively, for respirable crystalline silica.\n\n Both industry and worker groups have recognized that a \n\ncomprehensive standard for crystalline silica is needed to provide for \n\nexposure monitoring, medical surveillance, and worker training. ASTM \n\nInternational has published recommended standards for addressing the \n\nhazards of crystalline silica. The Building Construction Trades \n\nDepartment of the AFL-CIO has also developed a recommended \n\ncomprehensive program standard. These standards include provisions for \n\nmethods of compliance, exposure monitoring, training, and medical \n\nsurveillance.\n\n The NPRM was published on September 12, 2013. OSHA received over \n\n1,700 comments from the public on the proposed rule, and over 200 \n\nstakeholders provided testimony during public hearings on the proposal. \n\nIn the coming months, the agency will review and consider the evidence \n\nin the rulemaking record. Based upon this review, OSHA will determine \n\nan appropriate course of action with regard to workplace exposure to \n\nrespirable crystalline silica.\n\n Statement of Need: Workers are exposed to crystalline silica dust \n\nin general industry, construction, and maritime industries. Industries \n\nthat could be particularly affected by a standard for crystalline \n\nsilica include: Foundries, industries that have abrasive blasting \n\noperations, paint manufacture, glass and concrete product manufacture, \n\nbrick making, china and pottery manufacture, manufacture of plumbing \n\nfixtures, and many construction activities including highway repair, \n\nmasonry, concrete work, rock drilling, and tuckpointing. The \n\nseriousness of the health hazards associated with silica exposure is \n\n\n\ndemonstrated by the fatalities and disabling illnesses that continue to \n\noccur. From 2006 to 2010 silicosis was identified on 617 death \n\ncertificates as an underlying or contributing cause of death. It is \n\nlikely that many more cases have occurred where silicosis went \n\nundetected. In addition, the International Agency for Research on \n\nCancer has designated crystalline silica as carcinogenic to humans, and \n\nthe National Toxicology Program has concluded that respirable \n\ncrystalline silica is a known human carcinogen. Exposure to crystalline \n\nsilica has also been associated with an increased risk of developing \n\ntuberculosis and other nonmalignant respiratory diseases, as well as \n\nrenal and autoimmune diseases. Exposure studies and OSHA enforcement \n\ndata indicate that some workers continue to be exposed to levels of \n\ncrystalline silica far in excess of current exposure limits. Congress \n\nhas included compensation of silicosis victims on Federal nuclear \n\ntesting sites in the Energy Employees' Occupational Illness \n\nCompensation Program Act of 2000. There is a particular need for the \n\nAgency to modernize its exposure limits for construction and shipyard \n\nworkers.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The legal basis for the proposed rule is a \n\npreliminary determination that workers are exposed to a significant \n\nrisk of silicosis and other serious disease, and that rulemaking is \n\nneeded to substantially reduce the risk. In addition, the proposed rule \n\nwill recognize that the PELs for construction and maritime are \n\noutdated, and need to be revised to reflect current sampling and \n\nanalytical technologies.\n\n Alternatives: Over the past several years, the Agency has attempted \n\nto address this problem through a variety of non-regulatory approaches, \n\nincluding initiation of a Special Emphasis Program on silica in October \n\n1997, sponsorship with NIOSH and MSHA of the National Conference to \n\nEliminate Silicosis, and dissemination of guidance information on its \n\nWeb site.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The scope of the proposed rulemaking \n\nand estimates of the costs and benefits are still under development.\n\n Risks: A detailed risk analysis is under way.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCompleted SBREFA Report............. 12/19/03 .......................\n\nInitiated Peer Review of Health 05/22/09 .......................\n\n Effects and Risk Assessment.\n\nCompleted Peer Review............... 01/24/10 .......................\n\n\n\nNPRM................................ 09/12/13 78 FR 56274\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended; Notice 10/31/13 78 FR 65242\n\n of Intention to Appear at Pub\n\n Hearing; Scheduling Pub Hearing.\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 01/29/14 79 FR 4641\n\n[[Page 76580]]\n\nInformal Public Hearing............. 03/18/14 .......................\nPost Hearing Briefs Ends............ 08/18/14 .......................\nAnalyze Comments.................... 06/00/15 .......................\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, Local, State, Tribal.\n\n Federalism: This action may have federalism implications as defined \n\nin E.O. 13132.\n\n Agency Contact: William Perry, Director, Directorate of Standards \n\nand Guidance, Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health \n\nAdministration, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Room N-3718, Washington, \n\nDC 20210, Phone: 202 693-1950, Fax: 202 693-1678, Email: \n\nperry.bill@dol.gov\n\n RIN: 1218-AB70\n\nDOL--OSHA\n\nFinal Rule Stage\n\n103.

DOT regulates \n\nsafety in the aviation, motor carrier, railroad, motor vehicle, \n\nmailto:yebesi.francis@dol.gov\n\n\ncommercial space, public transportation, and pipeline transportation \n\nareas. DOT also regulates aviation consumer and economic issues and \n\nprovides financial assistance for programs involving highways, \n\nairports, public transportation, the maritime industry, railroads, and \n\nmotor vehicle safety. In addition, the Department writes regulations to \n\ncarry out a variety of statutes ranging from the Americans With \n\nDisabilities Act to the Uniform Time Act. Finally, DOT develops and \n\nimplements a wide range of regulations that govern internal DOT \n\nprograms such as acquisitions and grants, access for the disabled, \n\nenvironmental protection, energy conservation, information technology, \n\noccupational safety and health, property asset management, seismic \n\nsafety, and the use of aircraft and vehicles.\n\nThe Department's Regulatory Priorities\n\n The Department's regulatory priorities respond to the challenges \n\nand opportunities we face. Our mission generally is as follows:\n\n The national objectives of general welfare, economic growth and \n\nstability, and the security of the United States require the \n\ndevelopment of transportation policies and programs that contribute to \n\nproviding fast, safe, efficient, and convenient transportation at the \n\nlowest cost consistent with those and other national objectives, \n\nincluding the efficient use and conservation of the resources of the \n\nUnited States.\n\n To help us achieve our mission, we have five goals in the \n\nDepartment's Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2012-2016:\n\n Safety: Improve safety by ``reducing transportation-\n\nrelated fatalities and injuries.''\n\n State of Good Repair: Improve the condition of our \n\nNation's transportation infrastructure.\n\n Economic Competitiveness: Foster ``smart strategic \n\ninvestments that will serve the traveling public and facilitate freight \n\nmovements.''\n\n Quality of Life: Foster through ``coordinated, place-based \n\npolicies and investments that increase transportation choices and \n\naccess to transportation services.''\n\n Environmental Sustainability: Advance environmental \n\nsustainability ``through strategies such as fuel economy standards for \n\ncars and trucks, more environmentally sound construction and \n\noperational practices, and by expanding opportunities for shifting \n\nfreight from less fuel-efficient modes to more fuel-efficient modes.''\n\n In identifying our regulatory priorities for the next year, the \n\nDepartment considered its mission and goals and focused on a number of \n\n\n\nfactors, including the following:\n\n The relative risk being addressed.\n\n Requirements imposed by statute or other law.\n\n Actions on the National Transportation Safety Board ``Most \n\nWanted List''.\n\n The costs and benefits of the regulations.\n\n[[Page 76581]]\n\n The advantages of nonregulatory alternatives.\n\n Opportunities for deregulatory action.\n\n The enforceability of any rule, including the effect on \n\nagency resources.\n\n This regulatory plan identifies the Department's regulatory \n\npriorities--the 17 pending rulemakings chosen, from among the dozens of \n\nsignificant rulemakings listed in the Department's broader regulatory \n\nagenda, that the Department believes will merit special attention in \n\nthe upcoming year. The rules included in the regulatory plan embody the \n\nDepartment's focus on our strategic goals.\n\n The regulatory plan reflects the Department's primary focus on \n\nsafety--a focus that extends across several modes of transportation. \n\nFor example:\n\n The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will continue \n\nits efforts to implement safety management systems.\n\n The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) \n\ncontinues its work to strengthen the requirements for Electronic \n\nLogging Devices and revise motor carrier safety fitness procedures.\n\n The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) \n\nwill continue its rulemaking efforts to reduce death and injury \n\nresulting from incidents involving motorcoaches.\n\n Each of the rulemakings in the regulatory plan is described below \n\nin detail. In order to place them in context, we first review the \n\nDepartment's regulatory philosophy and our initiatives to educate and \n\ninform the public about transportation safety issues. We then describe \n\nthe role of the Department's retrospective reviews and its regulatory \n\nprocess and other important regulatory initiatives of OST and of each \n\nof the Department's components. Since each transportation ``mode'' \n\nwithin the Department has its own area of focus, we summarize the \n\nregulatory priorities of each mode and of OST, which supervises and \n\ncoordinates modal initiatives and has its own regulatory \n\nresponsibilities, such as consumer protection in the aviation industry.\n\nThe Department's Regulatory Philosophy and Initiatives\n\n The Department has adopted a regulatory philosophy that applies to \n\n\n\nall its rulemaking activities. This philosophy is articulated as \n\nfollows: DOT regulations must be clear, simple, timely, fair, \n\nreasonable, and necessary. They will be issued only after an \n\nappropriate opportunity for public comment, which must provide an equal \n\nchance for all affected interests to participate, and after appropriate \n\nconsultation with other governmental entities. The Department will \n\nfully consider the comments received. It will assess the risks \n\naddressed by the rules and their costs and benefits, including the \n\ncumulative effects. The Department will consider appropriate \n\nalternatives, including nonregulatory approaches. It will also make \n\nevery effort to ensure that regulation does not impose unreasonable \n\nmandates.\n\n The Department stresses the importance of conducting high-quality \n\nrulemakings in a timely manner and reducing the number of old \n\nrulemakings. To implement this, the Department has required the \n\nfollowing actions: (1) Regular meetings of senior DOT officials to \n\nensure effective policy leadership and timely decisions, (2) effective \n\ntracking and coordination of rulemakings, (3) regular reporting, (4) \n\nearly briefings of interested officials, (5) regular training of staff, \n\nand (6) adequate allocations of resources. The Department has achieved \n\nsignificant success because of this effort. It allows the Department to \n\nuse its resources more effectively and efficiently.\n\n The Department's regulatory policies and procedures provide a \n\ncomprehensive internal management and review process for new and \n\nexisting regulations and ensure that the Secretary and other \n\nappropriate appointed officials review and concur in all significant \n\nDOT rules. DOT continually seeks to improve its regulatory process. A \n\nfew examples include: The Department's development of regulatory \n\nprocess and related training courses for its employees; creation of an \n\nelectronic rulemaking tracking and coordination system; the use of \n\ndirect final rulemaking; the use of regulatory negotiation; a \n\ncontinually expanding and improved Internet page that provides \n\nimportant regulatory information, including ``effects'' reports and \n\nstatus reports (http://www.dot.gov/regulations); and the continued \n\nexploration and use of Internet blogs and other Web 2.0 technology to \n\nincrease and enhance public participation in its rulemaking process.\n\n In addition, the Department continues to engage in a wide variety \n\nof activities to help cement the partnerships between its agencies and \n\nits customers that will produce good results for transportation \n\nprograms and safety. The Department's agencies also have established a \n\nhttp://www.dot.gov/regulations\n\n\nnumber of continuing partnership mechanisms in the form of rulemaking \n\nadvisory committees.\n\nThe Department's Retrospective Review of Existing Regulations\n\n In accordance with Executive Order (E.O.) 13563 (Improving \n\nRegulation and Regulatory Review), the Department actively engaged in a \n\nspecial retrospective review of our existing rules to determine whether \n\nthey need to be revised or revoked. This review was in addition to \n\nthose reviews in accordance with section 610 of the Regulatory \n\nFlexibility Act, E.O. 12866, and the Department's Regulatory Policies \n\nand Procedures. As part of this effort, we also reviewed our processes \n\nfor determining what rules to review and ensuring that the rules are \n\neffectively reviewed. As a result of the review, we identified many \n\nrules for expedited review and changes to our retrospective review \n\nprocess. Pursuant to section 6 of E.O. 13563, the following Regulatory \n\nIdentifier Numbers (RINs) have been identified as associated with \n\nretrospective review and analysis in the Department's final \n\nretrospective review of regulations plan. Some of these entries on this \n\nlist may be completed actions, which do not appear in The Regulatory \n\nPlan. If a retrospective review action has been completed it will no \n\nlonger appear on the list below. However, more information can be found \n\nabout these completed rulemakings on the Unified Agenda publications at \n\nReginfo.gov in the Completed Actions section for that agency. These \n\nrulemakings can also be found on Regulations.gov. The final agency \n\nretrospective review plan can be found at http://www.dot.gov/regulations.\n\n Retrospective Review of Existing Regulations\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Significantly reduces\n\n RIN Rulemaking title costs on small\n\n businesses\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. 2105-AE29................

DOT has long recognized the value \n\nof international regulatory cooperation and has engaged in a variety of \n\nactivities with both foreign governments and international bodies. \n\nThese activities have ranged from cooperation in the development of \n\nparticular standards to discussions of necessary steps for rulemakings \n\nin general, such as risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses of \n\npossible standards. Since the issuance of E.O. 13609, we have increased \n\nour efforts in this area. For example, many of DOT's Operating \n\n\n\nAdministrations are active in groundbreaking government-wide Regulatory \n\nCooperation Councils (RCC) with Canada, Mexico, and the European Union. \n\nThese RCC working groups are setting a precedent in developing and \n\ntesting approaches to international coordination of rulemaking to \n\nreduce barriers to international trade. We also have been exploring \n\ninnovative approaches to ease the development process.\n\n Examples of the many cooperative efforts we are engaged in include \n\nthe following: The FAA maintains ongoing efforts with foreign civil \n\naviation authorities, including in particular the European Aviation \n\nSafety Agency and Transport Canada, to harmonize standards and \n\npractices where doing so will improve the safety of aviation and \n\naviation-related activities. The FAA also plays an active role in the \n\nstandard-setting work of the International Civil Aviation Organization \n\n(ICAO), particularly on the Air Navigation Commission and the Legal \n\nCommittee. In doing so, the FAA works with other\n\n[[Page 76583]]\n\nNations to shape the standards and recommended practices adopted by \n\nICAO. The FAA's rulemaking actions related to safety management systems \n\nare examples of the FAA's harmonization efforts.\n\n NHTSA is actively engaged in international regulatory cooperative \n\nefforts on both a multilateral and a bilateral basis, exchanging \n\ninformation on best practices and otherwise seeking to leverage its \n\nresources for addressing vehicle issues in the U.S. As noted in \n\nExecutive Order 13609: ``(i)n meeting shared challenges involving \n\nhealth, safety, labor, security, environmental, and other issues, \n\ninternational regulatory cooperation can identify approaches that are \n\nat least as protective as those that are or would be adopted in the \n\nabsence of such cooperation'' and ``can also reduce, eliminate, or \n\nprevent unnecessary differences in regulatory requirements.''\n\n As the representative, for vehicle safety matters, of the United \n\nStates, one of 33 contracting parties to the 1998 Agreement on the \n\nHarmonization of Vehicle Regulations, NHTSA is an active participant in \n\nthe World Forum for Vehicle Regulations (WP.29) at the UN. Under that \n\numbrella, NHTSA is currently working on the development of harmonized \n\nregulations for the safety of electric vehicles; hydrogen and fuel cell \n\nvehicles; advanced head restraints; pole side impact test procedures; \n\npedestrian protection; the safety risks associated with quieter \n\nvehicles, such as electric and hybrid electric vehicles; and \n\nadvancements in tires.\n\n In recognition of the large cross-border market in motor vehicles \n\nand motor vehicle equipment, NHTSA is working bilaterally with \n\nTransport Canada under the Motor Vehicles Working Group of the U.S.-\n\n\n\nCanada Regulatory Cooperation Council (RCC) to facilitate \n\nimplementation of the initial RCC Joint Action Plan. Under this Plan, \n\nNHTSA and Transport Canada are working on the development of \n\ninternational standards on quieter vehicles, electric vehicle safety, \n\nand hydrogen and fuel cell vehicles.\n\n Building on the initial Joint Action Plan, the U.S. and Canada \n\nissued a Joint Forward Plan on August 29, 2014. The Forward Plan \n\nprovides that, over the next six months, regulators will develop \n\nRegulatory Partnership Statements (RPSs) outlining the framework for \n\nhow cooperative activities will be managed between agencies. In that \n\nsame period, regulators will also develop and complete detailed work \n\nplans to begin to address the commitments in the Forward Plan. To \n\nfacilitate future cooperation, the RCC will work over the next year on \n\ncross-cutting issues in areas such as: ``sharing information with \n\nforeign governments, joint funding of new initiatives and our \n\nrespective rulemaking processes.''\n\n To broaden and deepen its cooperative efforts with the European \n\nUnion, NHTSA is participating in ongoing negotiations regarding the \n\nTransatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership which is ``aimed at \n\nproviding greater compatibility and transparency in trade and \n\ninvestment regulation, while maintaining high levels of health, safety, \n\nand environmental protection.'' NHTSA is seeking to build on existing \n\nlevels of safety and lay the groundwork for future cooperation in \n\naddressing emerging safety issues and technologies.\n\n PHMSA's hazardous material group works with ICAO, the UN \n\nSubcommittee of Experts on Dangerous Goods, and the International \n\nMaritime Organization. Through participation in these international \n\nbodies, PHMSA is able to advocate on behalf of U.S. safety and \n\ncommercial interests to guide the development of international \n\nstandards with which U.S. businesses have to comply when shipping in \n\ninternational commerce. PHMSA additionally participates in the RCC with \n\nCanada and has a Memorandum of Cooperation in place to ensure that \n\ncross-border shipments are not hampered by conflicting regulations. The \n\npipeline group at PHMSA incorporates many standards by reference into \n\nthe Pipeline Safety Regulations, and the development of these standards \n\nbenefit from the participation of experts from around the world.\n\n In the areas of airline consumer protection and civil rights \n\nregulation, OST is particularly conscientious in seeking international \n\nregulatory cooperation. For example, the Department participates in the \n\nstandard-setting activities of ICAO and meets and works with other \n\ngovernments and international airline associations on the \n\nimplementation of U.S. and foreign aviation rules.\n\n\n\n For a number of years the Department has also provided information \n\non which of its rulemaking actions have international effects. This \n\ninformation, updated monthly, is available at the Department's \n\nregulatory information Web site, http://www.dot.gov/regulations, under \n\nthe heading ``Reports on Rulemakings and Enforcement.'' (The reports \n\ncan be found under headings for ``EU,'' ``NAFTA'' (Canada and Mexico) \n\nand ``Foreign.'') A list of our significant rulemakings that are \n\nexpected to have international effects follows; the identifying RIN \n\nprovided below can be used to find summary and other information about \n\nthe rulemakings in the Department's Regulatory Agenda published along \n\nwith this Plan:\n\n DOT Significant Rulemakings With International Impacts\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n RIN Rulemaking title\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2105-AD90.........................................

For example, \n\nthe Department created an effective tracking system for significant \n\nrulemakings to ensure that either rules are completed in a timely \n\nmanner or delays are identified and fixed. Through this tracking \n\nsystem, a monthly status report is generated. To make its efforts more \n\ntransparent, the Department has made this report Internet accessible at \n\nhttp://www.dot.gov/regulations, as well as through a list-serve. By \n\ndoing this, the Department is providing valuable information concerning \n\nour rulemaking activity and is providing information necessary for the \n\npublic to evaluate the Department's progress in meeting its commitment \n\nto completing quality rulemakings in a timely manner.\n\nhttp://www.dot.gov/regulations\n\n\n The Department continues to place great emphasis on the need to \n\ncomplete high-quality rulemakings by involving senior departmental \n\nofficials in regular meetings to resolve issues expeditiously.\n\nOffice of the Secretary of Transportation (OST)\n\n The Office of the Secretary (OST) oversees the regulatory process \n\nfor the Department. OST implements the Department's regulatory policies \n\nand procedures and is responsible for ensuring the involvement of top \n\nmanagement in regulatory decisionmaking. Through the General Counsel's \n\noffice, OST is also responsible for ensuring that the Department \n\ncomplies with the Administrative Procedure Act, Executive Order 12866 \n\n(Regulatory Planning and Review), Executive Order 13563, DOT's \n\nRegulatory Policies and Procedures, and other legal and policy \n\nrequirements affecting rulemaking. Although OST's principal role \n\nconcerns the review of the Department's significant rulemakings, this \n\noffice has the lead role in the substance of such projects as those \n\nconcerning aviation economic rules, the Americans with Disabilities \n\nAct, and rules that affect multiple elements of the Department.\n\n OST provides guidance and training regarding compliance with \n\nregulatory requirements and process for personnel throughout the \n\nDepartment. OST also plays an instrumental role in the Department's \n\nefforts to improve our economic analyses; risk assessments; regulatory \n\nflexibility analyses; other related analyses; retrospective reviews of \n\nrules; and data quality, including peer reviews.\n\n OST also leads and coordinates the Department's response to the \n\nOffice of Management and Budget's (OMB) intergovernmental review of \n\nother agencies' significant rulemaking documents and to Administration \n\nand congressional proposals that concern the regulatory process. The \n\nGeneral Counsel's office works closely with representatives of other \n\nagencies, OMB, the White House, and congressional staff to provide \n\ninformation on how various proposals would affect the ability of the \n\nDepartment to perform its safety, infrastructure, and other missions.\n\n During Fiscal Year 2015, OST will continue to focus its efforts on \n\nenhancing airline passenger protections by requiring carriers to adopt \n\nvarious consumer service practices under the following rulemaking \n\ninitiatives:\n\n Accessible In-Flight Entertainment\n\n Airline Pricing Transparency and Other Consumer Protection \n\nIssues\n\n Carrier-Supplied Medical Oxygen, Accessible In-Flight \n\nEntertainment Systems, Service Animals, and Accessible Lavatories on \n\n\n\nSingle-Aisle Aircraft.\n\n OST will also continue its efforts to help coordinate the \n\nactivities of several operating administrations that advance various \n\ndepartmental efforts that support the Administration's initiatives on \n\npromoting safety, stimulating the economy and creating jobs, sustaining \n\nand building America's transportation infrastructure, and improving \n\nquality of life for the people and communities who use transportation \n\nsystems subject to the Department's policies. It will also continue to \n\noversee the Department's rulemaking actions to implement the ``Moving \n\nAhead for Progress in the 21st Century Act'' (MAP-21).\n\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA)\n\n The Federal Aviation Administration is charged with safely and \n\nefficiently operating and maintaining the most complex aviation system \n\nin the world. Destination 2025, an FAA initiative that captures the \n\nagency's vision of transforming the Nation's aviation system by 2025, \n\nhas proven to be an effective tool for pushing the agency to think \n\nabout longer-term aspirations; FAA has established a vision that \n\ndefines the agency's priorities for the next five years. The changing \n\ntechnological and industry environment compels us to transform the \n\nagency. And the challenging fiscal environment we face only increases \n\nthe need to prioritize our goals.\n\n We have identified four major strategic initiatives where we will \n\nfocus our efforts: (1) Risk-based Decision Making--Build on safety \n\nmanagement principles to proactively address emerging safety risk by \n\nusing consistent, data-informed approaches to make smarter, system-\n\nlevel, risk-based decisions; (2) NAS Initiative--Lay the foundation for \n\nthe National Airspace System of the future by achieving prioritized \n\nNextGen benefits, enabling the safe and efficient integration of new \n\nuser entrants including Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Commercial \n\nSpace flights, and deliver more efficient, streamlined air traffic \n\nmanagement services; (3) Global Leadership--Improve safety, air traffic \n\nefficiency, and environmental sustainability across the globe through \n\nan integrated, data-driven approach that shapes global standards, \n\nenhances collaboration and harmonization, and better targets FAA \n\nresources and efforts; and (4) Workforce of the Future--Prepare FAA's \n\nhuman capital for the future, by identifying, recruiting, and training \n\na workforce with the leadership, technical, and functional skills to \n\nensure the U.S. has the world's safest and most productive aviation \n\nsector.\n\n FAA activities that may lead to rulemaking in Fiscal Year 2015 \n\ninclude continuing to:\n\n Promote and expand safety information-sharing efforts, \n\n\n\nsuch as FAA-industry partnerships and data-driven safety programs that \n\nprioritize and address risks before they lead to accidents. \n\nSpecifically, FAA will continue implementing Commercial\n\n[[Page 76585]]\n\nAviation Safety Team projects related to controlled flight into \n\nterrain, loss of control of an aircraft, uncontained engine failures, \n\nrunway incursions, weather, pilot decision making, and cabin safety. \n\nSome of these projects may result in rulemaking and guidance materials.\n\n Respond to the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 \n\n(the Act) which directed the FAA to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to \n\nissue guidelines and regulations relating to ADS-B In technology and \n\nrecommendations from an Aviation Rulemaking Committee on ADS-B-In \n\ncapabilities in consideration of the FAA's evolving thinking on how to \n\nprovide an integrated suite of communication, navigation, and \n\nsurveillance (CNS) capabilities to achieve full NextGen performance.\n\n Respond to the Act which also recommended we complete the \n\nrulemaking for small Unmanned Aircraft Systems, and consider how to \n\nfully integrate UAS operations in the NAS, which will require future \n\nrulemaking.\n\n Respond to the Airline Safety and Federal Aviation \n\nAdministration Extension Act of 2010 (H.R. 5900) which requires the FAA \n\nto develop and implement Safety Management Systems (SMS) where these \n\nsystems will improve safety of aviation and aviation-related \n\nactivities. An SMS proactively identifies potential hazards in the \n\noperating environment, analyzes the risks of those hazards, and \n\nencourages mitigation prior to an accident or incident. In its most \n\ngeneral form, an SMS is a set of decision-making tools that can be used \n\nto plan, organize, direct, and control activities in a manner that \n\nenhances safety.\n\n Respond to the Small Airplane Revitalization Act of 2013 \n\n(H.R. 1848) which requires the FAA adopt the recommendations from Part \n\n23 Reorganization Aviation Rulemaking Aviation Rulemaking Committee \n\n(ARC) for improving safety and reducing certification costs for general \n\naviation. The ARC recommendations include a broad range of policy and \n\nregulatory changes that it believes could significantly improve the \n\nsafety of general aviation aircraft while simultaneously reducing \n\ncertification and modification costs for these aircraft. Among the \n\nARC's recommendations is a suggestion that compliance with part 23 \n\nrequirements be performance-based, focusing on the complexity and \n\nperformance of an aircraft instead of the current regulations based on \n\nweight and type of propulsion. In announcing the ARC's recommendations, \n\nthe Transportation Secretary said ``Streamlining the design and \n\n\n\ncertification process could provide a cost-efficient way to build \n\nsimple airplanes that still incorporate the latest in safety \n\ninitiatives. These changes have the potential to save money and \n\nmaintain our safety standing--a win-win situation for manufacturers, \n\npilots and the general aviation community as a whole.''\n\n Work cooperatively to harmonize the U.S. aviation \n\nregulations with those of other countries, without compromising \n\nrigorous safety standards, or our requirements to develop cost benefit \n\nanalysis. The differences worldwide in certification standards, \n\npractice and procedures, and operating rules must be identified and \n\nminimized to reduce the regulatory burden on the international aviation \n\nsystem. The differences between the FAA regulations and the \n\nrequirements of other nations impose a heavy burden on U.S. aircraft \n\nmanufacturers and operators, some of which are small businesses. \n\nStandardization should help the U.S. aerospace industry remain \n\ninternationally competitive. The FAA continues to publish regulations \n\nbased on internal analysis, public comment, and recommendations of \n\nAviation Rulemaking Committees that are the result of cooperative \n\nrulemaking between the U.S. and other countries.\n\n In response to Executive Order 13610 ``Identifying and \n\nReducing Regulatory Burdens,'' we continue to find ways to make our \n\nregulatory program more effective or less burdensome; provide \n\nquantifiable monetary savings or quantifiable reductions in paperwork \n\nburdens, and modify and streamline regulations in light of changed \n\ncircumstances. One example is our response to a petition for exemption \n\nfrom the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association and Experimental \n\nAircraft Association (AOPA-EAA) in which we will address through \n\nrulemaking to consider medical self-certification for certain \n\nnoncommercial operations in lieu of airman medical certification.\n\n FAA top regulatory priorities for Fiscal Year 2015 include:\n\n Operation and Certification of Small Unmanned Aircraft \n\nSystems (2120-AJ60) (Pub. L. 112-95 (Feb. 14, 2012))\n\n Pilot Records Database (2120-AK31) (Pub. L. 111-216 (Aug. \n\n1, 2010))\n\n Drug and Alcohol Testing of Certain Maintenance Provider \n\nEmployees Located Outside of the United States (2120-AK09) (Pub. L. \n\n112-95 (Feb. 14, 2012))\n\n Congestion Management for LaGuardia Airport, John F. \n\nKennedy International Airport, and Newark Liberty International Airport \n\n(2120-AJ89)\n\n Safety Management System for Certificate Holders Operating \n\nUnder 14 CFR part 121 (2120-AJ86) (Pub. L. 111-216, sec 215 (Aug. 1, \n\n\n\n2010))\n\n The Operation and Certification of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems \n\nrulemaking would:\n\n Adopt specific rules for the operation of small unmanned \n\naircraft systems in the national airspace system; and\n\n Address the classification of small unmanned aircraft, \n\ncertification of their pilots and visual observers, registration, \n\napproval of operations, and operational limits.\n\n The Pilot Records Database rulemaking would:\n\n Implement a pilot records database into which the FAA, air \n\ncarriers, and other persons that employ pilots would enter records; and\n\n Require air carriers operating under 14 CFR parts 121 and \n\n135 access the pilot records database electronically and evaluate the \n\navailable data for each individual pilot candidate before allowing that \n\nindividual to serve as a required pilot flightcrew member.\n\n The Drug and Alcohol Testing of Certain Maintenance Provider \n\nEmployees Located Outside of the United States rulemaking would:\n\n Require certain air carriers to ensure that all employees \n\nof certificated repair stations, and certain other maintenance \n\norganizations that are located outside the United States, who perform \n\nsafety-sensitive maintenance functions on aircraft operated by those \n\nair carriers, are subject to a drug and alcohol testing program; and\n\n Require the drug and alcohol testing program be determined \n\nacceptable by the FAA Administrator, and be consistent with the \n\napplicable laws of the country in which the repair station is located.\n\n The Congestion Management rulemaking for LaGuardia Airport, John F. \n\nKennedy International Airport, and Newark Liberty International Airport \n\nwould:\n\n Replace the orders limiting scheduled operations at John \n\nF. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), limiting scheduled operations \n\nat Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), and limiting scheduled \n\nand unscheduled operations at LaGuardia Airport (LGA); and\n\n Provide a longer-term and comprehensive approach to slot \n\nmanagement at JFK, EWR, and LGA.\n\n[[Page 76586]]\n\n The Safety Management System for Certificate Holders Operating \n\nunder 14 CFR part 121 rulemaking would:\n\n Require certain certificate holders to develop and \n\nimplement an SMS;\n\n Establish a general framework from which a certificate \n\nholder can build its SMS; and Conform to International Civil Aviation \n\n\n\nOrganization Annexes and adopt several National Transportation Safety \n\nBoard recommendations.\n\nFederal Highway Administration (FHWA)\n\n The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) carries out the Federal \n\nhighway program in partnership with State and local agencies to meet \n\nthe Nation's transportation needs. The FHWA's mission is to improve \n\ncontinually the quality and performance of our Nation's highway system \n\nand its intermodal connectors.\n\n Consistent with this mission, the FHWA will continue:\n\n With ongoing regulatory initiatives in support of its \n\nsurface transportation programs;\n\n To implement legislation in the most cost-effective way \n\npossible; and\n\n To pursue regulatory reform in areas where project \n\ndevelopment can be streamlined or accelerated, duplicative requirements \n\ncan be consolidated, recordkeeping requirements can be reduced or \n\nsimplified, and the decisionmaking authority of our State and local \n\npartners can be increased.\n\n MAP-21 authorizes the Federal surface transportation \n\nprograms for highways, highway safety, and transit for the two-year \n\nperiod from 2012-2014. The FHWA has analyzed MAP-21 to identify \n\ncongressionally directed rulemakings. These rulemakings will be the \n\nFHWA's top regulatory priorities for the coming year. Additionally, the \n\nFHWA is in the process of reviewing all FHWA regulations to ensure that \n\nthey are consistent with MAP-21 and will update those regulations that \n\nare not consistent with the recently enacted legislation.\n\n During Fiscal Year 2015, FHWA will continue its focus on \n\nimproving the quality and performance of our Nation's highway systems \n\nby creating national performance management measures and standards to \n\nbe used by the States to meet the national transportation goals \n\nidentified in section 1203 of MAP-21 under the following rulemaking \n\ninitiatives:\n\n National Goals and Performance Management Measures \n\n(Safety) (RIN: 2125-AF49)\n\n National Goals and Performance Management Measures \n\n(Bridges and Pavement) (RIN: 2125-AF53)\n\n National Goals and Performance Management Measures \n\n(Congestion Reduction, CMAQ, Freight, and Performance of Interstate/\n\nNon-Interstate NHS) (RIN: 2125-AF54).\n\nFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)\n\n The mission of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration \n\n\n\n(FMCSA) is to reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities involving \n\ncommercial trucks and buses. A strong regulatory program is a \n\ncornerstone of FMCSA's compliance and enforcement efforts to advance \n\nthis safety mission. FMCSA develops new and more effective safety \n\nregulations based on three core priorities: Raising the safety bar for \n\nentry, maintaining high standards, and removing high-risk behavior. In \n\naddition to Agency-directed regulations, FMCSA develops regulations \n\nmandated by Congress, through legislation such as MAP-21 and the Safe, \n\nAccountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A \n\nLegacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU). FMCSA regulations establish standards \n\nfor motor carriers, commercial drivers, commercial motor vehicles, and \n\nState agencies receiving certain motor carrier safety grants and \n\nissuing commercial drivers' licenses.\n\n FMCSA's regulatory plan for FY 2015 includes completion of a number \n\nof rulemakings that are high priorities for the Agency because they \n\nwould have a positive impact on safety. Among the rulemakings included \n\nin the plan are: (1) Electronic Logging Devices (RIN 2126-AB20), (2) \n\nCarrier Safety Fitness Determination (RIN 2126-AB11), and (3) \n\nCommercial Driver's License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse (RIN 2126-\n\nAB18).\n\n Together, these priority rules could help to substantially improve \n\ncommercial motor vehicle (CMV) safety on our Nation's highways by \n\nimproving FMCSA's ability to provide safety oversight of motor carriers \n\nand commercial drivers.\n\n In FY 2015, FMCSA plans to issue a final rule on Electronic Logging \n\nDevices (RIN 2126-AB20) to establish: (1) Minimum performance and \n\ndesign standards for hours-of-service (HOS) electronic logging devices \n\n(ELDs); (2) requirements for the mandatory use of these devices by \n\ndrivers currently required to prepare HOS records of duty status \n\n(RODS); (3) requirements concerning HOS supporting documents; and (4) \n\nmeasures to address concerns about harassment resulting from the \n\nmandatory use of ELDs.\n\n In FY 2015, FMCSA will continue its work on the Compliance, Safety, \n\nAccountability (CSA) program. The CSA program improves the way FMCSA \n\nidentifies and conducts carrier compliance and enforcement operations. \n\nCSA's goal is to improve large truck and bus safety by assessing a \n\nwider range of safety performance data from a larger segment of the \n\nmotor carrier industry through an array of progressive compliance \n\ninterventions. FMCSA anticipates that the impacts of CSA interventions \n\nand an associated rulemaking to put into place a new safety fitness \n\ndetermination standard will enable the Agency to prohibit ``unfit'' \n\ncarriers from operating on the Nation's highways (the Carrier Safety \n\n\n\nFitness Determination(RIN 2126-AB11)) and will contribute further to \n\nthe Agency's overall goal of decreasing CMV-related fatalities and \n\ninjuries.\n\n Also in FY 2015, FMCSA plans to issue a final rule on the \n\nCommercial Driver's License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse (RIN 2126-\n\nAB18). The rule would establish a clearinghouse requiring employers and \n\nservice agents to report information about current and prospective \n\nemployees' drug and alcohol test results. It would also require \n\nemployers and certain service agents to search the Clearinghouse for \n\ncurrent and prospective employees' positive drug and alcohol test \n\nresults as a condition of permitting those employees to perform safety-\n\nsensitive functions. This would provide FMCSA and employers the \n\nnecessary tools to identify drivers who are prohibited from operating a \n\nCMV based on DOT drug and alcohol program violations and ensure that \n\nsuch drivers receive the required evaluation and treatment before \n\nresuming safety-sensitive functions.\n\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration\n\n The statutory responsibilities of the National Highway Traffic \n\nSafety Administration (NHTSA) relating to motor vehicles include \n\nreducing the number of, and mitigating the effects of, motor vehicle \n\ncrashes and related fatalities and injuries; providing safety \n\nperformance information to aid prospective purchasers of vehicles, \n\nchild restraints, and tires; and improving automotive fuel efficiency. \n\nNHTSA pursues policies that encourage the development of nonregulatory \n\napproaches when feasible in meeting its statutory mandates. It issues \n\nnew standards and regulations or amendments to existing standards and \n\nregulations when appropriate. It ensures that regulatory alternatives \n\nreflect a careful assessment of the problem and a comprehensive \n\nanalysis of the benefits, costs, and other impacts associated with\n\n[[Page 76587]]\n\nthe proposed regulatory action. Finally, it considers alternatives \n\nconsistent with the Administration's regulatory principles.\n\n NHTSA continues to focus on the high-priority safety issue of heavy \n\nvehicles and their occupants in Fiscal Year 2015, including combination \n\ntruck tractors, large buses, and motorcoaches. The agency will continue \n\nwork towards considering promulgation of a new Federal motor vehicle \n\nsafety standard (FMVSS) for rollover structural integrity requirements \n\nfor newly manufactured motorcoaches in accordance with NHTSA's 2007 \n\nMotorcoach Safety Plan, DOT's 2009 departmental Motorcoach Safety \n\n\n\nAction Plan as revised in 2012, and requirements of MAP-21. NHTSA will \n\nalso issue a final rule to promulgate a new FMVSS for electronic \n\nstability control systems for motor coaches and truck tractors. This \n\nfinal rule is mandated by the MAP-21 Act. Together, these rulemaking \n\nactions will address multiple open recommendations issued by the \n\nNational Transportation Safety Board related to motorcoach safety. \n\nNHTSA, in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency, will \n\npublish a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in Fiscal Year 2015 to \n\naddress phase two of fuel efficiency standards for medium- and heavy-\n\nduty on-highway vehicles and work trucks for model years beyond 2018. \n\nThis NPRM will be responsive to requirements of the Energy Independence \n\nand Security Act of 2007 as well as the President's Climate Action \n\nPlan.\n\n In Fiscal Year 2015, NHTSA plans to issue a final rule that would \n\nestablish a new FMVSS to provide a means of alerting blind and other \n\npedestrians of motor vehicle operation. This rulemaking is mandated by \n\nthe Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010 to further enhance the \n\nsafety of passenger vehicles and pedestrians. NHTSA will also continue \n\nwork toward a NPRM on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. V2V \n\ncommunications is currently perceived to become a foundational aspect \n\nof vehicle automation.\n\n In addition to numerous programs that focus on the safe performance \n\nof motor vehicles, the Agency is engaged in a variety of programs to \n\nimprove driver and occupant behavior. These programs emphasize the \n\nhuman aspects of motor vehicle safety and recognize the important role \n\nof the States in this common pursuit. NHTSA has identified two high-\n\npriority areas: Safety belt use and impaired driving. To address these \n\nissue areas, the Agency is focusing especially on three strategies--\n\nconducting highly visible, well-publicized enforcement; supporting \n\nprosecutors who handle impaired driving cases and expanding the use of \n\nDWI/Drug Courts, which hold offenders accountable for receiving and \n\ncompleting treatment for alcohol abuse and dependency; and adopting \n\nalcohol screening and brief intervention by medical and health care \n\nprofessionals. Other behavioral efforts encourage child safety-seat \n\nuse; combat excessive speed and aggressive driving; improve motorcycle, \n\nbicycle, and pedestrian safety; and provide consumer information to the \n\npublic.\n\nFederal Railroad Administration (FRA)\n\n FRA's current regulatory program reflects a number of pending \n\nproceedings to satisfy mandates resulting from the Rail Safety \n\n\n\nImprovement Act of 2008 (RSIA08), and the Passenger Rail Investment and \n\nImprovement Act of 2008 (PRIIA), as well as actions under its general \n\nsafety rulemaking authority and actions supporting a high-performing \n\npassenger rail network. RSIA08 alone has required 21 rulemaking \n\nactions, 16 of which have been completed. FRA continues to prioritize \n\nits rulemakings according to the greatest effect on safety while \n\npromoting economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job \n\ncreation, as well as expressed congressional interest, while working to \n\ncomplete as many mandated rulemakings as quickly as possible.\n\n Through the Railroad Safety Advisory Committee (RSAC), FRA is \n\nworking to complete RSIA08 actions, including developing requirements \n\nrelated to the creation and implementation of railroad risk reduction \n\nand system safety programs, and an RSAC working group has developed \n\nrecommendations for the fatigue management provisions related to both \n\nproceedings. FRA is also in the process of producing two regulatory \n\nactions related to the transportation of crude oil and ethanol by rail, \n\nfocusing on the securement of equipment and appropriate crew size \n\nrequirements when transporting such commodities. FRA's crew size \n\nactivity will also address other freight and passenger operations to \n\nensure FRA will have appropriate oversight if a railroad chooses to \n\nalter its standard method of operation. In addition, FRA continues to \n\nprepare a final rule amending its regulations related to roadway \n\nworkers and is developing other RSAC-supported actions that advance \n\nhigh-performing passenger rail such as proposed rules on standards for \n\nalternative compliance with FRA's Passenger Equipment Safety Standards.\n\nFederal Transit Administration (FTA)\n\n FTA helps communities support public transportation by making \n\ngrants of Federal funding for transit vehicles, construction of transit \n\nfacilities, and planning and operation of transit and other transit-\n\nrelated purposes. FTA regulatory activity implements the laws that \n\napply to recipients' uses of Federal funding and the terms and \n\nconditions of FTA grant awards. FTA policy regarding regulations is to:\n\n Ensure the safety of public transportation systems.\n\n Provide maximum benefit to the mobility of the Nation's \n\ncitizens and the connectivity of transportation infrastructure;\n\n Provide maximum local discretion;\n\n Ensure the most productive use of limited Federal \n\nresources;\n\n Protect taxpayer investments in public transportation;\n\n Incorporate principles of sound management into the grant \n\n\n\nmanagement process.\n\n As the needs for public transportation have changed over the years, \n\nthe Federal transit programs have grown in number and complexity often \n\nrequiring implementation through the rulemaking process. In fact, FTA \n\nis currently implementing many of its public transportation programs \n\nauthorized under MAP-21 through the regulatory process. To that end, \n\nFTA's regulatory priorities include implementing certain requirements \n\nof the newly authorized Public Transportation Safety Program (49 U.S.C. \n\n5329), such as the National Public Transportation Safety Plan, \n\nimplementing requirements for Transit Asset Management Systems (49 \n\nU.S.C. 5326), amending the State Safety Oversight rule (49 CFR part \n\n659). In addition FTA is finalizing its Emergency Relief rule, which \n\nimplements FTA's new authority to assist transit agencies responding to \n\nmajor disasters.\n\nMaritime Administration (MARAD)\n\n The Maritime Administration (MARAD) administers Federal laws and \n\nprograms to improve and strengthen the maritime transportation system \n\nto meet the economic, environmental, and security needs of the Nation. \n\nTo that end, MARAD's efforts are focused upon ensuring a strong \n\nAmerican presence in the domestic and international trades and to \n\nexpanding maritime opportunities for American businesses and workers.\n\n MARAD's regulatory objectives and priorities reflect the agency's \n\nresponsibility for ensuring the availability of water transportation \n\nservices for American shippers and\n\n[[Page 76588]]\n\nconsumers and, in times of war or national emergency, for the U.S. \n\narmed forces. Major program areas include the following: Maritime \n\nSecurity, Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement, National Defense \n\nReserve Fleet and the Ready Reserve Force, Cargo Preference, Maritime \n\nGuaranteed Loan Financing, United States Merchant Marine Academy, \n\nMariner Education and Training Support, Deepwater Port Licensing, and \n\nPort and Intermodal Development. Additionally, MARAD administers the \n\nSmall Shipyard Grants Program through which equipment and technical \n\nskills training are provided to America's maritime workforce, with the \n\naim of helping businesses to compete in the global marketplace while \n\ncreating well-paying jobs at home.\n\n MARAD's primary regulatory activities in Fiscal Year 2015 will be \n\nto continue the update of existing regulations as part of the \n\nDepartment's Retrospective Regulatory Review effort, and to propose new \n\nregulations where appropriate.\n\n\n\nPipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA)\n\n The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) \n\nhas responsibility for rulemaking under two programs. Through the \n\nAssociate Administrator for Hazardous Materials Safety, PHMSA \n\nadministers regulatory programs under Federal hazardous materials \n\ntransportation law and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as \n\namended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Through the Associate \n\nAdministrator for Pipeline Safety, PHMSA administers regulatory \n\nprograms under the Federal pipeline safety laws and the Federal Water \n\nPollution Control Act, as amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.\n\n The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of \n\n2011 included a number of rulemaking studies and mandates and \n\nadditional enforcement authorities that continue to impact PHMSA's \n\nregulatory activities in Fiscal Year 2015.\\1\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\1\\ \nhttp://www.phmsa.dot.gov/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_7FD46010F0497123865B976479CFF3952E990200/filename/P\nipeline%20Reauthorization%20Bill%202011.pdf.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n MAP-21 reauthorized the hazardous materials safety program and \n\nrequired several regulatory actions by PHMSA. MAP-21 placed a great \n\ndeal of emphasis on the procedures for issuing special permits and the \n\nincorporation of special permits into regulations. Persons who offer \n\nfor transportation or transport hazardous materials in commerce must \n\nfollow the hazardous materials regulations. A special permit sets forth \n\nalternative requirements, or variances, to the requirements in the HMR. \n\nFederal hazardous materials transportation law authorizes PHMSA to \n\nissue such variances in a way that achieves a safety level that is at \n\nleast equal to the safety level required under Federal hazmat law or is \n\nconsistent with the public interest if a required safety level does not \n\nexist. A rulemaking was required within two years by MAP-21 to set out \n\nprocedures and criteria for evaluating applications for special permits \n\nand approvals. In addition, MAP-21 required PHMSA to conduct a review \n\nof nearly 1,200 existing special permits and issue another rulemaking \n\nwithin three years to incorporate special permits that have been in \n\ncontinuous effect for a ten-year period into the HMR.\n\n PHMSA will continue to work toward improving safety related to \n\ntransportation of hazardous materials by all transportation modes, \n\nincluding pipeline, while promoting economic growth, innovation, \n\ncompetitiveness, and job creation. We will concentrate on the \n\nprevention of high-risk incidents identified through the findings of \n\nthe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and PHMSA's evaluation \n\nhttp://www.phmsa.dot.gov/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_7FD46010F0497123865B976479CFF3952E990200/filename/Pipeline%20Reauthorization%20Bill%202011.pdf\nhttp://www.phmsa.dot.gov/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_7FD46010F0497123865B976479CFF3952E990200/filename/Pipeline%20Reauthorization%20Bill%202011.pdf\n\n\nof transportation incident data. PHMSA will use all available Agency \n\ntools to assess data; evaluate alternative safety strategies, including \n\nregulatory strategies as necessary and appropriate; target enforcement \n\nefforts; and enhance outreach, public education, and training to \n\npromote safety outcomes.\n\n PHMSA will continue to focus on the streamlining of its regulatory \n\nsystem and reducing regulatory burdens. PHMSA will evaluate existing \n\nrules to examine whether they remain justified; should be modified to \n\naccount for changing circumstances and technologies; or should be \n\nstreamlined or even repealed. PHMSA will continue to evaluate, analyze, \n\nand be responsive to petitions for rulemaking. PHMSA will review \n\nregulations, letters of interpretation, petitions for rulemaking, \n\nspecial permits, enforcement actions, approvals, and international \n\nstandards to identify inconsistencies, outdated provisions, and \n\nbarriers to regulatory compliance.\n\n PHMSA aims to reduce the risks related to the transportation of \n\nhazardous materials by rail. Preventing tank car incidents and \n\nminimizing the consequences when an incident does occur are not only \n\nDOT priorities, but are also shared by the National Transportation \n\nSafety Board (NTSB), industry, and the general public. Expansion in \n\nUnited States energy production has led to significant challenges in \n\nthe transportation system. Expansion in oil production has led to \n\nincreasing volumes of product transported to refineries. With a growing \n\ndomestic supply, rail transportation, in particular, has emerged as an \n\nalternative to transportation by pipeline or vessel. The growing \n\nreliance on trains to transport large volumes of flammable liquids \n\nraises risks that have been highlighted by the recent instances of \n\ntrains carrying crude oil that have derailed. PHMSA and FRA issued a \n\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking (79 FR 45016) designed to lessen the \n\nfrequency and consequences of train accidents/incidents (train \n\naccidents) involving certain trains transporting a large volume of \n\nflammable liquids. In addition, PHMSA and FRA issued an Advanced Notice \n\nof Proposed Rulemaking (79 FR 45079) seeking comment on potential \n\nrevisions to its regulations that would expand the applicability of \n\ncomprehensive oil spill response plans (OSRPs) for crude oil trains. \n\nPHMSA will continue to usher these rules to completion and PHMSA may \n\nconsider further regulatory changes to enhance rail safety through \n\nenhanced operational requirements; improvements in tank car standards; \n\nand revisions of the general requirements for rail transport.\n\n PHMSA will be considering whether changes are needed to the \n\nregulations covering hazardous liquid onshore pipelines. In particular, \n\nPHMSA will be considering if other areas should be included as High \n\n\n\nConsequence Areas (HCAs) for integrity management (IM) protections, \n\nwhat the repair timeframes should be for areas outside the HCAs that \n\nare assessed as part of the IM program, whether leak detection \n\nstandards are necessary, valve spacing requirements are needed on new \n\nconstruction or existing pipelines, and if PHMSA should extend \n\nregulation to certain pipelines currently exempt from regulation. The \n\nagency would also address the public safety and environmental aspects \n\nany new requirements, as well as the cost implications and regulatory \n\nburden.\n\n[[Page 76589]]\n\n Quantifiable Costs and Benefits of Rulemakings on the 2014 to 2015 DOT Regulatory Plan\n\n [This chart does not account for non-quantifiable benefits, which are often substantial]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Quantifiable costs discounted Quantifiable benefits\n\n Agency/RIN Number Title Stage 2013 $ (millions) discounted 2013 $ (millions)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFAA\n\n 2120-AJ60.......................

L. 112-95\n\n CFR Citation: 14 CFR 91.\n\n Legal Deadline: Final, Statutory, August 14, 2014, Public Law 112-\n\n95, section 332(b) requires issuance of final rule 18 months after \n\nintegration plan is submitted to Congress. Integration plan due Feb. \n\n14, 2013.\n\n Abstract: This rulemaking would adopt specific rules for the \n\noperation of small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) in the National \n\nAirspace System. These changes would address the classification of \n\nsmall unmanned aircraft, certification of their pilots and visual \n\nobservers, registration, approval of operations, and operational limits \n\nin order to increase the safety and efficiency of the national airspace \n\nsystem.\n\n Statement of Need: The FAA is proposing to amend its regulations to\n\n[[Page 76590]]\n\nadopt specific rules for the operation of small unmanned aircraft \n\nsystems (sUAS) in the National Airspace System (NAS). These changes \n\nwould address the classification of sUAS, certification of sUAS pilots \n\nand visual observers, registration of sUAS, approval of sUAS \n\noperations, and sUAS operational limits. The NPRM also proposes \n\nregulations for all sUAS, including operating standards for model \n\naircraft and low performance (e.g., toy) operations, to increase the \n\nsafety and efficiency of the NAS. The FAA and sUAS community lack \n\nsufficient formal safety data regarding unmanned operations to support \n\ngranting traditional, routine access to the NAS. This proposed rule \n\nwould result in the regular collection of safety data from the user \n\ncommunity and help the FAA develop new regulations and expand sUAS \n\naccess to the NAS.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: This rulemaking is required by the FAA \n\nModernization and Reform Act of 2012, Public Law 112-95, sec. 332(b). \n\nThe FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety is found in Title \n\n49 of the U.S. Code. Subtitle I, Section 106 describes the authority of \n\nthe FAA Administrator, including the authority to issue, rescind, and \n\nrevise regulations. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, describes in more \n\ndetail the scope of the agency's authority. This rulemaking is \n\npromulgated under the authority described in Title 49 U.S. Code \n\nTransportation. Pursuant to Subtitle I, Chapter 1, Sections \n\n106(f)(2)(iii) and (3)(A), the Administrator is authorized to \n\npromulgate regulations, rules, orders, circulars, bulletins, and other \n\npublications of the Administrator, and to issue, rescind and revise \n\n\n\nsuch regulations as are necessary to carry out those functions. \n\nSubtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Chapter 447 Safety Regulation. \n\nPursuant to section 44701 (a)(5), the FAA is charged with promoting \n\nsafe flight of civil aircraft by, among other things, prescribing \n\nregulations the FAA finds necessary for safety in air commerce and \n\nnational security.\n\n Alternatives: This rulemaking is required by the FAA Modernization \n\nand Reform Act of 2012, Public Law 112-95, sec. 332(b). The FAA's \n\nauthority to issue rules on aviation safety is found in Title 49 of the \n\nU.S. Code. Subtitle I, Section 106 describes the authority of the FAA \n\nAdministrator, including the authority to issue, rescind, and revise \n\nregulations. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, describes in more detail \n\nthe scope of the agency's authority. This rulemaking is promulgated \n\nunder the authority described in Title 49 U.S. Code Transportation. \n\nPursuant to Subtitle I, Chapter 1, Sections 106(f)(2)(iii) and (3)(A), \n\nthe Administrator is authorized to promulgate regulations, rules, \n\norders, circulars, bulletins, and other publications of the \n\nAdministrator, and to issue, rescind and revise such regulations as are \n\nnecessary to carry out those functions. Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart \n\nIII, Chapter 447 Safety Regulation. Pursuant to section 44701 (a)(5), \n\nthe FAA is charged with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft by, \n\namong other things, prescribing regulations the FAA finds necessary for \n\nsafety in air commerce and national security.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Costs and benefits for this \n\nrulemaking are to be determined.\n\n Risks: Commercial operations currently have no legal means to \n\nconduct operations. Due to the time and cost of traditional processes \n\nand without new regulations, commercial operations will not be able to \n\noperate until the necessary standards are developed by the UAS \n\ncommunity.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 01/00/15\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Governmental Jurisdictions.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n URL for More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\n\n\n URL for Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Lance Nuckolls, Certification and General Aviation \n\nOperations, Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation \n\nAdministration, 800 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, DC 20591, Phone: \n\n202-267-8212, Email: lance.nuckolls@faa.gov\n\n RIN: 2120-AJ60\n\nDOT--FAA\n\n105. + Slot Management and Transparency for Laguardia Airport, John F. \n\nKennedy International Airport, and Newark Liberty International Airport\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 49 U.S.C. 40101, 40103, and 40105; 49 U.S.C. \n\n41712; 15 U.S.C. 21\n\n CFR Citation: 14 CFR 93.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: This rulemaking would replace the current temporary \n\norders limiting scheduled operations at LaGuardia Airport (LGA), John \n\nF.

The Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) is \n\nthe head of the DOT and has broad oversight of significant FAA \n\ndecisions. See 49 U.S.C. 102 and 106. In addition, under 49 U.S.C. \n\n41712, the Secretary has the authority to investigate and prohibit \n\nunfair and deceptive practices, and unfair methods of competition in \n\nair transportation, or the sale of air transportation. The FAA has \n\nbroad authority under 49 U.S.C. 40103 to regulate the use of the \n\nnavigable airspace of the United States. This section authorizes the \n\nFAA to develop plans and policy for the use of navigable airspace, and \n\nto assign the use the FAA deems necessary for safe and efficient \n\nutilization. It further directs the FAA to prescribe air traffic rules \n\nand regulations governing the efficient utilization of\n\n[[Page 76591]]\n\nnavigable airspace. Not only is the FAA required to ensure the \n\nefficient use of navigable airspace, but it must do so in a manner that \n\ndoes not effectively shut out potential operators at the airport, and \n\nin a manner that acknowledges competitive market forces. These \n\nauthorities empower the DOT to ensure the efficient utilization of \n\nairspace by limiting the number of scheduled and unscheduled aircraft \n\noperations at JFK, EWR, and LGA, while balancing between promoting \n\ncompetition and recognizing historical investments in the airport, and \n\nthe need to provide continuity. They also authorize the DOT to \n\ninvestigate the transfer of slots and to limit or prohibit \n\nanticompetitive transfers.\n\n Alternatives: The FAA considered two alternatives. The first \n\nalternative was to simply extend the existing orders. This alternative \n\nwas rejected because the FAA wanted to increase competition by making \n\nslots available to more operators. The FAA believes these operators are \n\nlikely to be small entities. The second alternative was to remove the \n\nexisting orders. This alternative results in unacceptable delay costs \n\nfrom the increase in operations.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The FAA estimates the quantitative \n\ncosts to be $48.2 million and the quantitative benefits are estimated \n\nat $67.8 million, with the benefits exceeding the costs. This is a \n\npreliminary estimate that is subject to change based on further review \n\nand analysis.\n\n Risks: There are no risks for this rulemaking.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 11/00/14\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Additional Information: This rulemaking is associated with an RRR \n\naction.\n\n URL For More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL For Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Molly W Smith, Federal Aviation Administration, \n\nDepartment of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 \n\nIndependence Ave., SW, Washington, DC 20591, Phone: 202-267-3344 Email: \n\nmolly.w.smith@faa.gov\n\n RIN: 2120-AJ89\n\nDOT--FAA\n\n106. + Drug and Alcohol Testing of Certain Maintenance Provider \n\nEmployees Located Outside of the United States\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 14 CFR; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); 49 U.S.C. 40113; 49 \n\nU.S.C. 44701; 49 U.S.C. 44702; 49 U.S.C. 44707; 49 U.S.C. 44709; 49 \n\nU.S.C. 44717\n\n CFR Citation: 14 CFR 145.\n\n Legal Deadline: NPRM, Statutory, February 14, 2013, NPRM.\n\n Abstract: This rulemaking is required by the FAA Modernization and \n\nReauthorization Act of 2012.

The intended effect is to increase participation by \n\ncompanies outside of the United States in testing of employees who \n\nperform safety critical functions and testing standards similar to \n\nthose used in the repair stations located in the United States.

In February 2012 the \n\nU.S. Congress passed the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012. \n\nSection 308(d)(2) of the Act requires that the FAA promulgate a \n\nproposed rule that requires all part 145 repair station employees \n\nresponsible for safety-sensitive maintenance functions on part 121 \n\ncommercial air carriers aircraft to be subject to an alcohol and \n\ncontrolled substances testing program determined acceptable by the \n\nAdministrator and consistent with the applicable laws of the country in \n\nwhich the repair station is located.\n\n Alternatives: Our alternatives would be to work with other aviation \n\nleaders (e.g. International Civil Aviation Organization--ICAO) and \n\ndevelop a collective initiative to foster a drug and alcohol-free \n\nworldwide environment. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, \n\ndoes articulate the idea that the Secretaries of State and \n\nTransportation work with ICAO and establish international standards to \n\ntest for drug and alcohol use of employees performing safety-sensitive \n\nmaintenance functions on commercial air carrier aircraft.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Our alternatives would be to work \n\nwith other aviation leaders (e.g. International Civil Aviation \n\nOrganization--ICAO) and develop a collective initiative to foster a \n\ndrug and alcohol-free worldwide environment. The FAA Modernization and \n\nReform Act of 2012, does articulate the idea that the Secretaries of \n\nState and Transportation work with ICAO and establish international \n\nstandards to test for drug and alcohol use of employees performing \n\nsafety-sensitive maintenance functions on commercial air carrier \n\naircraft.\n\n Risks: International implications are the risks.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nANPRM............................... 03/17/14 79 FR 14621\n\nComment Period Extended............. 05/01/14 79 FR 24631\n\nANPRM Comment Period End............ 05/16/14\n\nComment Period End.................. 07/17/14\n\nAnalyzing Comments.................. 02/00/15\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Governmental Jurisdictions.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n International Impacts: This regulatory action will be likely to \n\nhave international trade and investment effects, or otherwise be of \n\n\n\ninternational interest.\n\n URL For More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL For Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Vicky Dunne, Department of Transportation, Federal \n\nAviation Administration, 800 Independence Ave, SW, Washington, DC \n\n20591, Phone: 202 267-8522, Email: vicky.dunne@faa.gov\n\n RIN: 2120-AK09\n\nDOT--FAA\n\n107. + Pilot Records Database (HR 5900)\n\n Priority: Other Significant.

Section 203 amends \n\nthe Pilot Records Improvement Act (PRIA) by requiring the FAA to create \n\na pilot records database that contains various types of pilot records. \n\nThese records would be provided by the FAA, air carriers, and other \n\npersons who employ pilots. The FAA must maintain these records until it \n\nreceives notice that a pilot is deceased. Air carriers would use this \n\ndatabase to perform a record check on a pilot prior to making a hiring \n\ndecision.\n\n Statement of Need: This rule implements a Pilot Records Database as \n\nrequired by Public Law 111-216. Section 203 of Public Law 111-216 \n\namends the Pilot Records Improvement Act (PRIA) by requiring the FAA to \n\ncreate a pilot records database that contains various types of pilot \n\nrecords. These records would be provided by the FAA, air carriers, and \n\nother persons who employ pilots. The FAA must maintain these records \n\nuntil it receives notice that a pilot is deceased. Air carriers would \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nmailto:vicky.dunne@faa.gov\n\n\nuse this database to perform a record check on a pilot prior to making \n\na hiring decision.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The legal basis for this rule is section \n\n203 of the Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension \n\nAct of 2010, Public Law 111-216, 124 Statute 2348 (2010).\n\n Alternatives: The ARC proposed a phased implementation as an \n\nalternative to PRDs statutory requirement to enter all historical \n\nrecords dating from August 1, 2005. Instead, within 60 days after the \n\nPRD launch date, air carriers and other persons would provide only the \n\nnames, certificate numbers, and dates of birth of employees dating from \n\nthe PRD launch date back to August 1, 2005. This information would be \n\nused to identify a pilot applicant's previous employer(s). The hiring \n\nair carrier would then make a paper PRIA request to those previous \n\nemployers to obtain any records from before the launch date of PRD.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The Rulemaking Team believes that \n\nthree methods of data entry would allow larger air carriers to take \n\nadvantage of technology, thereby reducing costs, while allowing smaller \n\nair carriers the flexibility to enter data manually without the need \n\nfor an information technology department and sophisticated computer \n\nknowledge.\n\n Risks: Any risk mitigation technique used to counter this \n\nadditional security threat would significantly add to the time and cost \n\nrequired for the FAA to properly manage the air carrier user accounts \n\nand likely delay air carrier access to the PRD data. Several options \n\nwere explored that would simultaneously provide appropriate security \n\ncontrols to protect unauthorized access to sensitive data while not \n\nimpeding the air carriers from ready access to the PRD data.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 10/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Undetermined.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Additional Information: Costs and benefits are not yet determined.\n\n URL For More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL For Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Bryan Brown, Department of Transportation, Federal \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\n\n\nAviation Administration, 6424 S Denning Ave., Oklahoma City, OK 73169, \n\nPhone: 405 954-4513, Email: bryan.w.brown@faa.gov\n\n RIN: 2120-AK31\n\nDOT--FAA\n\nFinal Rule Stage\n\n108. + Safety Management Systems for Certificate Holders\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g); 49 U.S.C. 40113; 49 U.S.C. \n\n40119; 49 U.S.C. 41706; 49 U.S.C. 44101; 49 U.S.C. 44701; 49 U.S.C. \n\n44702; 49 U.S.C. 44705; 49 U.S.C. 44709 to 44711; 49 U.S.C. 44713; 49 \n\nU.S.C. 44716; 49 U.S.C. 44717; 49 U.S.C. 44722; 49 U.S.C. 46105; Pub. \n\nL. 111-216, sec 215\n\n CFR Citation: 14 CFR 121; 14 CFR 5.\n\n Legal Deadline: Final, Statutory, July 30, 2012, Final Rule. NPRM, \n\nStatutory, October 29, 2010, NPRM. Congress passed Public Law 111-216 \n\nthat instructs FAA to conduct a rulemaking to require all part 121 air \n\ncarriers to implement a Safety Management System (SMS). This Act \n\nfurther states that the FAA shall consider at a minimum each of the \n\nfollowing as part of the SMS rulemaking: (1) an Aviation Safety Action \n\nProgram (ASAP); (2) a Flight Operations Quality Assurance Program \n\n(FOQA); (3) a Line Operations Safety Audit (LOSA); and (4) an Advance \n\nQualifications Program.\n\n Abstract: This rulemaking would require each certificate holder \n\noperating under 14 CFR part 121 to develop and implement a safety \n\nmanagement system (SMS) to improve the safety of its aviation related \n\nactivities. A safety management system is a comprehensive, process-\n\noriented approach to managing safety throughout an organization. An SMS \n\nincludes an organization-wide safety policy; formal methods for \n\nidentifying hazards, controlling, and continually assessing risk and \n\nsafety performance; and promotion of a safety culture. SMS stresses not \n\nonly compliance with technical standards but increased emphasis on the \n\noverall safety performance of the organization. This rulemaking is \n\nrequired under Public Law 111-216, section 215.\n\n Statement of Need: This final rule requires each air carrier \n\noperating under 14 CFR part 121 to develop and implement a safety \n\nmanagement system (SMS) to improve the safety of its aviation-related \n\nactivities. SMS is a comprehensive, process-oriented approach to \n\nmanaging safety throughout an organization. SMS includes an \n\norganization-wide safety policy; formal methods for identifying \n\nhazards; controlling, and continually assessing risk and safety \n\nmailto:bryan.w.brown@faa.gov\n\n\nperformance; and promotion of a safety culture. SMS stresses not only \n\ncompliance with technical standards but also increased emphasis on the \n\noverall safety performance of the organization.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) \n\nauthority to issue rules on aviation safety is found in title 49 of the \n\nUnited States Code. This rulemaking is promulgated under the authority \n\ndescribed in 49 U.S.C. 44701(a)(5), which requires the Administrator to \n\npromulgate regulations and minimum standards for other practices, \n\nmethods, and procedures necessary for safety in air commerce and \n\nnational security. In addition, the Airline Safety and Federal Aviation \n\nAdministration Extension Act of 2010 (the Act), Public Law 111-216, \n\nsection 215 (August 1, 2010), required the FAA to conduct rulemaking to \n\nrequire all 14 CFR part 121 air carriers to implement a safety \n\nmanagement system. The Act required the FAA to issue this final rule \n\nwithin 24 months of the passing of the Act (July 30, 2012).\n\n Alternatives: To relieve the burden of this rule on small entities, \n\nthe FAA considered extending the timeframe for development of SMS \n\nimplementation\n\n[[Page 76593]]\n\nplans. However, the FAA ultimately concluded that 1 year for the \n\ndevelopment and approval of implementation plans is appropriate. In \n\nmaking this determination, the FAA considered longer and shorter terms. \n\nHowever, it settled on 1 year based on information from the SMS Pilot \n\nProject, which showed that an average of 1 year was sufficient to \n\ndevelop and approve an implementation plan. As part of its analysis, \n\nthe FAA noted that pilot project participants ultimately had differing \n\nlevels of SMS implementation. However, because all pilot project \n\nparticipants had initially developed (and received FAA validation on) \n\nan implementation plan that provided for full SMS implementation, the \n\nFAA was able to use this data to estimate how long it would take a \n\ncertificate holder to develop such a plan, and get the plan approved by \n\nthe FAA.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The FAA estimates the quantitative \n\ncosts to be $135.1 million, and the quantitative benefits to be $142.8 \n\nmillion, with benefits exceeding costs.\n\n Risks: While the commercial air carrier accident rate in the United \n\nStates has decreased substantially over the past 10 years, the FAA has \n\nidentified a recent trend involving hazards that were revealed during \n\naccident investigations. The FAA's Office of Accident Investigation and \n\nPrevention identified 128 accidents involving part 121 air carriers \n\n\n\nfrom fiscal year (FY) 2001 through FY 2010 for which identified causal \n\nfactors could have been mitigated if air carriers had implemented an \n\nSMS to identify hazards in their operations and developed methods to \n\ncontrol the risk. This type of approach allows air carriers to \n\nanticipate and mitigate the likely causes of potential accidents. This \n\nis a significant improvement over current reactive safety action \n\nemphasis, which focuses on discovering and mitigating the cause of an \n\naccident only after that accident has occurred. In order to bring about \n\nthis change in accident mitigation, as well as the other reasons \n\ndiscussed throughout this document, the FAA is requiring part 121 air \n\ncarriers to develop and implement an SMS. SMS is a comprehensive, \n\nprocess-oriented approach to managing safety throughout an \n\norganization, and stresses not only compliance with technical \n\nstandards, but increased emphasis on the overall safety performance of \n\nthe organization. The potential reduction of risks would be averted \n\ncausalities, aircraft damage, and accident investigation costs by \n\nidentifying safety issues and spotting trends before they result in a \n\nnear-miss, incident, or accident.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 11/05/10 75 FR 68224\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 01/31/11 76 FR 5296\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 02/03/11 .......................\n\nComment Period Extended............. 03/07/11\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 11/00/14\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal.\n\n URL for More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL for Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Scott VanBuren, Office of Accident Investigation \n\nand Prevention, Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation \n\nAdministration, 800 Independence Ave. SW., Washington, DC 20591, Phone: \n\n202 494-8417, Email: scott.vanburen@faa.gov\n\n Related RIN: Split from 2120-AJ15\n\n RIN: 2120-AJ86\n\nDOT--FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION (FHWA)\n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nmailto:scott.vanburen@faa.gov\n\n\nProposed Rule Stage\n\n109. + National Goals and Performance Management Measures (MAP-21)\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: sec 1203 Pub.

Major under 5 U.S.C. 801.\n\n Legal Authority: sec 4009 of TEA-21\n\n CFR Citation: 49 CFR 385.\n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nmailto:Francine.Shaw-whitson@dot.gov\n\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: FMCSA proposes to amend the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \n\nRegulations (FMCSRs) to adopt revised methodologies that would result \n\nin a safety fitness determination (SFD). The proposed methodologies \n\nwould determine when a motor carrier is not fit to operate commercial \n\nmotor vehicles (CMVs) in or affecting interstate commerce based on (1) \n\nthe carrier's performance in relation to five of the Agency's \n\nBehavioral Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories (BASICs); (2) an \n\ninvestigation; or (3) a combination of on-road safety data and \n\ninvestigation information. The intended effect of this action is to \n\nreduce crashes caused by CMV drivers and motor carriers, resulting in \n\ndeath, injuries, and property damage on U.S. highways, by more \n\neffectively using FMCSA data and resources to identify unfit motor \n\ncarriers, and to remove them from the Nation's roadways.\n\n Statement of Need: Because of the time and expense associated with \n\nthe on-site compliance review, only a small fraction of carriers \n\n(approximately 12,000) receive a safety fitness determination each \n\nyear. Since the current safety fitness determination process is based \n\nexclusively on the results of an on-site compliance review, the great \n\nmajority of carriers subject to FMCSA jurisdiction do not receive a \n\ntimely determination of their safety fitness. The proposed methodology \n\nfor determining motor carrier safety fitness should correct the \n\ndeficiencies of the current process. In correcting these deficiencies, \n\nFMCSA has made a concerted effort to develop a ``transparent'' method \n\nfor the Safety Fitness Determination (SFD) that would allow each motor \n\ncarrier to understand fully how FMCSA established that carrier's \n\nspecific SFD.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: This rule is based primarily on the \n\nauthority of 49 U.S.C. 31144, which directs the Secretary of \n\nTransportation to ``determine whether an owner or operator is fit to \n\noperate a commercial motor vehicle'' and to ``maintain by regulation a \n\nprocedure for determining the safety fitness of an owner or operator.'' \n\nThis statute was first enacted as part of the Motor Carrier Safety Act \n\nof 1984, section 215, Public Law 98-554, 98 Stat. 2844 (Oct. 30, 1984). \n\nThe proposed rule also relies on the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 31133, \n\nwhich gives the Secretary ``broad administrative powers to assist in \n\nthe implementation'' of the provisions of the Motor Carrier Safety Act \n\nnow found in chapter 311 of title 49, U.S.C. These powers include, \n\namong others, authority to conduct inspections and investigations, \n\ncompile statistics, require production of records and property, \n\nprescribe recordkeeping and reporting requirements, and to perform \n\nother acts considered appropriate. These powers are used to obtain the \n\n\n\ndata used by the Safety Management System and by the proposed new \n\nmethodology for safety fitness determinations. Under 49 CFR 1.73(g), \n\nthe Secretary has delegated the authority to carry out the functions in \n\nsubchapters I, III, and IV of chapter 311, title 49, U.S.C., to the \n\nFMCSA Administrator. Sections 31133 and 31144 are part of subchapter \n\nIII of chapter 311.\n\n Alternatives: The Agency has been considering several alternatives.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The Agency is continuing to review \n\nthe estimated costs and benefits of the proposed rule.\n\n Risks: A risk of incorrectly identifying a compliant carrier as \n\nnon-compliant--and consequently subjecting the carrier to unnecessary \n\nexpenses--has been analyzed and has been found to be\n\n[[Page 76595]]\n\nnegligible under the process being proposed.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 04/00/15\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Organizations.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Undetermined.\n\n URL for More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL for Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: David Miller, Regulatory Development Division, \n\nDepartment of Transportation, Federal Motor Carrier Safety \n\nAdministration, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20590, \n\nPhone: 202 366-5370, Email: fmcsaregs@dot.gov\n\n RIN: 2126-AB11\n\nDOT--FMCSA\n\n112. + Electronic Logging Devices and Hours of Service Supporting \n\nDocuments (MAP-21)\n\n Priority: Economically Significant.

Specifically, this rule \n\nwould (1) Require new technical specifications for ELDs that address \n\nstatutory requirements; (2) mandate ELDs for drivers currently using \n\nrecord of duty status; (3) clarify supporting document requirements so \n\nthat motor carriers and drivers can comply efficiently with HOS \n\nregulations, and so that motor carriers can make the best use of ELDs \n\nand related support systems as their primary means of recording HOS \n\ninformation and ensure HOS compliance; and (4) adopt procedural and \n\ntechnical provisions aimed at ensuring that ELDs are not used to harass \n\nvehicle operators. The Agency published a Supplemental Notice of \n\nProposed Rulemaking (SNPRM) on March 28, 2014, and the comment period \n\nended on June 26, 2014.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Section 113 of the Hazardous Materials \n\nTransportation Authorization Act of 1994, Public Law 103-311, 108 Stat. \n\n1673, 16776-1677, August 26, 1994, (HMTAA) requires the Secretary to \n\nprescribe regulations to improve compliance by CMV drivers and motor \n\ncarriers with HOS requirements and the effectiveness and efficiency of \n\nFederal and State enforcement officers reviewing such compliance. \n\nSpecifically, the Act addresses requirements for supporting documents. \n\nSection 32301(b) of the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Enhancement \n\nAct, enacted as part of MAP-21 (Public Law 112-141, 126 Stat. 405, 786-\n\n788 (July 6, 2012), mandated that the Secretary adopt regulations \n\nrequiring that CMVs involved in interstate commerce, operated by \n\ndrivers who are required to keep RODS, be equipped with ELDs.\n\n Alternatives: FMCSA is considering several alternatives to the \n\n\n\nproposal, including alternate populations.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: FMCSA estimates costs of $1.6B and \n\nbenefits of $2.0B for the rule, discounted at 7% in 2013 dollars.\n\n Risks: FMCSA has not yet fully assessed the risks that might be \n\nassociated with this activity.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 02/01/11 76 FR 5537\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 02/28/11 .......................\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 03/10/11 76 FR 13121\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended End.... 05/23/11 .......................\n\nSNPRM............................... 03/28/14 79 FR 17656\n\nSNPRM Comment Period End............ 05/27/14 .......................\n\nSNPRM Analyzing Comments............ 03/00/15 .......................\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 09/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n International Impacts: This regulatory action will be likely to \n\nhave international trade and investment effects, or otherwise be of \n\ninternational interest.\n\n Additional Information: The Agency previously published an NPRM on \n\nthis subject under RIN 2126-AA76, ``Hours of Service of Drivers; \n\nSupporting Documents'' (63 FR 19457, Apr. 20, 1998) and an SNPRM, \n\n``Hours of Service of Drivers: Supporting Documents'' (69 FR 63997, \n\nNov. 3, 2004).

Additionally, provisions in this \n\nrulemaking would also be responsive to requirements of the Moving Ahead \n\nfor Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21) Act. MAP-21 requires creation \n\nof the Clearinghouse by 10/1/14.\n\n Statement of Need: This rulemaking would improve the safety of the \n\nNation's highways by ensuring that employers know when drivers test \n\npositive for drugs and/or alcohol, and are not qualified to drive. It \n\nwould also ensure that drivers who have tested positive and have not \n\ncompleted the return-to-duty process are not driving, and ensure that \n\nall employers are meeting their drug and alcohol testing \n\nresponsibilities.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Section 32402 of the Moving Ahead for \n\nProgress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21)) (Pub. L. 112-141, 126 Stat. \n\n\n\n405) directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a national \n\nclearinghouse for controlled substance and alcohol test results of \n\ncommercial motor vehicle operators. In addition, FMCSA has general \n\nauthority to promulgate safety standards, including those governing \n\ndrivers' use of drugs or alcohol while operating a CMV. The Motor \n\nCarrier Safety Act of 1984 Public Law 98-554 (the 1984 Act) provides \n\nauthority to regulate drivers, motor carriers, and vehicle equipment, \n\nand requires the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe minimum \n\nsafety standards for CMVs. These standards include: (1) That CMVs are \n\nmaintained, equipped loaded, and operated safely; (2) the \n\nresponsibilities imposed on CMV operators do not impair their ability \n\nto operate the vehicles safely; (3) the physical condition of CMV \n\noperators is adequate to enable them to operate the vehicles safely; \n\nand (4) CMV operation does not have a deleterious effect on the \n\nphysical condition of the operators 49 U.S.C. 31136(a).\n\n Alternatives: To be determined.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The Agency estimates $187 million in \n\nannual benefits from increased crash reduction from the rule. This is \n\nagainst an estimated $155 million in total annual costs for employers \n\nto complete the annual and pre-employment queries and to designate C/\n\nTPAs, for SAPs to input information from drivers undergoing the return-\n\nto-duty process, for various entities to report and notify positive \n\ntests and to register and become familiar with the rule, for drivers to \n\nconsent to release of records, and for FMCSA to maintain and operate \n\nthe Clearinghouse, and for drivers to go through the return-to-duty \n\nprocess. Total net benefits of the rule thus are $32 million annually.\n\n Risks: There is a risk of not knowing when a driver has not \n\ncompleted the return-to-duty process and enabling job-hopping within \n\nthe industry.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 02/20/14 79 FR 9703\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 04/21/14 .......................\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 04/22/14 79 FR 22467\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended End.... 05/21/14 .......................\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 09/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, Local, State, Tribal.\n\n Federalism: This action may have federalism implications as defined \n\nin E.O. 13132.\n\n Additional Information: MAP-21 included provisions for a Drug and \n\nAlcohol Test Clearinghouse that affect this rulemaking.\n\n URL for More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL For Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Juan Moya, Department of Transportation, Federal \n\nMotor Carrier Safety Administration, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE., \n\nWashington, DC 20590, Phone: 202 366-4844, Email: juan.moya@dot.gov\n\n RIN: 2126-AB18\n\nDOT--NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION (NHTSA)\n\nProposed Rule Stage\n\n114. +Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium-and Heavy-Duty Vehicles and \n\nWork Trucks: Phase 2\n\n Priority: Economically Significant.

This rulemaking would respond to requirements \n\nof the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA), title 1, \n\nsubtitle A, sections 102 and 108, as they amend 49 U.S.C. 32902, which \n\nwas signed into law December 19, 2007. The statute requires that NHTSA \n\nestablish a medium- and heavy-duty on-highway vehicle and work truck \n\nfuel efficiency improvement program that achieves the maximum feasible \n\nimprovement, including standards that are appropriate, cost-effective, \n\nand technologically feasible. The law requires that the new standards \n\nprovide at least 4 full model years of regulatory lead-time and 3 full \n\nmodel years of regulatory stability (i.e., the standards must remain in \n\neffect for 3 years before they may be amended). This action would \n\nfollow the first ever Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards and Fuel \n\nEfficiency Standards for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles \n\n(Phase 1) (76 FR 57106, September 15, 2011). In June 2013, the \n\nPresident's Climate Action Plan called for the Department of \n\nTransportation to develop fuel efficiency standards and the \n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency to develop greenhouse gas emission \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nmailto:juan.moya@dot.gov\n\n\nstandards in joint rulemaking within the President's second term. In \n\nFebruary 2014, the President directed DOT and EPA to complete the \n\nsecond phase of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards and Fuel Efficiency \n\nStandards for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles during his \n\nsecond term.\n\n Statement of Need: Setting fuel consumption standards for \n\ncommercial medium-duty and heavy-duty on-highway vehicles and work \n\ntrucks will reduce fuel consumption, and will thereby improve U.S. \n\nenergy security by reducing dependence on foreign oil, which has been a \n\nnational objective since the first oil price shocks in the 1970s. Net \n\npetroleum imports now\n\n[[Page 76597]]\n\naccount for approximately 60 percent of U.S. petroleum consumption. \n\nWorld crude oil production is highly concentrated, exacerbating the \n\nrisks of supply disruptions and price shocks. Tight global oil markets \n\nled to prices over $100 per barrel in 2008, with gasoline reaching as \n\nhigh as $4 per gallon in many parts of the U.S., causing financial \n\nhardship for many families and businesses. The export of U.S. assets \n\nfor oil imports continues to be an important component of the \n\nhistorically unprecedented U.S. trade deficits. Transportation accounts \n\nfor about 72 percent of U.S. petroleum consumption. Medium-duty and \n\nheavy-duty vehicles account for about 17 percent of transportation oil \n\nuse, which means that they alone account for about 12 percent of all \n\nU.S. oil consumption.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: This rulemaking would respond to \n\nrequirements of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 \n\n(EISA), title 1, subtitle A, sections 102 and 108, as they amend 49 \n\nU.S.C. 32902, which was signed into law December 19, 2007.

The PRIA contains an \n\nestimate of 2,800 fewer injured pedestrians and pedalcyclists (35 \n\nequivalent lives saved) at a total estimated cost of $23.5 million at \n\nthe 3 percent discount rate, and $22.9 million at the 7 percent \n\ndiscount rate, should the requirements of the NPRM be made final.\n\n Statement of Need: The Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010, \n\nsigned into law on January 4, 2011, directs the Secretary to study and \n\nestablish a motor vehicle safety standard that provides for a means of \n\nalerting blind and other pedestrians of motor vehicle operation. The \n\nagency's proposed safety standard, issued January 14, 2013, will \n\nrequire hybrid and electric passenger cars, light trucks and vans \n\n(LTVs), medium and heavy duty trucks, buses, low speed vehicles (LSVs), \n\nand motorcycles to meet specified sound requirements as required by the \n\nAct. This standard will ensure that blind, visually-impaired, and other \n\npedestrians are able to detect and recognize nearby hybrid and electric \n\nvehicles. The proposal estimated that 2,800 total pedestrians injured \n\nwill be avoided, due to this proposal's representation of 35 equivalent \n\nlives saved.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Section 30111, title 49 of the U.S.C., \n\nstates that the Secretary shall prescribe motor vehicle safety \n\nstandards.\n\n Alternatives: The Agency considered and sought public comment on \n\nalternatives including: (1) Taking no action; (2) requiring alert \n\nsounds based on recordings of internal combustion engine (ICE) \n\nvehicles; (3) specifying acoustic requirements for synthetic sounds \n\nthat would closely resemble sounds produced by ICE vehicles; (4) \n\nsetting requirements for alert sounds that possess aspects of both \n\nsounds produced by ICE vehicles and acoustic elements that contribute \n\nto detectability; and (5) using psychoacoustic principals to develop \n\nrequirements for alert sounds that would have enhanced detectability, \n\nbut would not necessarily have a reference to sounds produced by ICE \n\nvehicles.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: In 2010 dollars at a 7 percent \n\ndiscount rate, the total costs are estimated to be $24.4 million and \n\nmonetized benefits at $134.1 million, with net benefits estimated at \n\n$109.7 million.\n\n\n\n Risks: The Agency believes that there are no significant risks \n\nassociated with this rulemaking, and that only beneficial outcomes will \n\noccur.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 01/14/13 78 FR 2797\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 03/15/13 .......................\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 04/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n International Impacts: This regulatory action will be likely to \n\nhave\n\n[[Page 76598]]\n\ninternational trade and investment effects, or otherwise be of \n\ninternational interest.\n\n URL for More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL for Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Marisol Medri, Safety Engineer, Department of \n\nTransportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 1200 \n\nNew Jersey Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20590, Phone: 202-366-6987, \n\nEmail: marisol.medri@dot.gov\n\n RIN: 2127-AK93\n\nDOT--NHTSA\n\n116. +Electronic Stability Control Systems for Heavy Vehicles (MAP-21)\n\n Priority: Economically Significant. Major under 5 U.S.C. 801.\n\n Legal Authority: 49 U.S.C. 30111; 49 U.S.C. 30115; 49 U.S.C. 30117; \n\n49 U.S.C. 30166; 49 U.S.C. 322; delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.95\n\n CFR Citation: 49 CFR 571.\n\n Legal Deadline: Final, Statutory, October 1, 2014, Final Rule.\n\n Abstract: This rulemaking would promulgate a new Federal standard \n\nthat would require stability control systems on truck tractors and \n\nmotorcoaches that address both rollover and loss-of-control crashes, \n\nafter an extensive research program to evaluate the available \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nmailto:marisol.medri@dot.gov\n\n\ntechnologies, an evaluation of the costs and benefits, and a review of \n\nmanufacturer[acute]s product plans. Rollover and loss-of-control \n\ncrashes involving heavy vehicles is a serious safety issue that is \n\nresponsible for 304 fatalities and 2,738 injuries annually. They are \n\nalso a major cause of traffic tie-ups, resulting in millions of dollars \n\nof lost productivity, and excess energy consumption each year. \n\nSuppliers and truck and motorcoach manufacturers have developed \n\nstability control technology for heavy vehicles to mitigate these types \n\nof crashes. Our preliminary estimate produces an effectiveness range of \n\n37 to 56 percent against single-vehicle tractor-trailer rollover \n\ncrashes and 3 to 14 percent against loss-of-control crashes that result \n\nfrom skidding on the road surface. With these effectiveness estimates, \n\nannually, we estimate 29 to 66 lives would be saved, 517 to 979 MAIS 1 \n\nto 5 injuries would be reduced, and 810 to 1,693 crashes that involved \n\nproperty damage only would be eliminated. Additionally, it would save \n\n$10 to $26 million in property damage and travel delays. Based on the \n\ntechnology unit costs and affected vehicles, we estimate technology \n\ncosts would be $55 to 107 million, annually. However, the costs savings \n\nfrom reducing travel delay and property damage would produce net \n\nbenefits of $128 to $372 million. This rulemaking is responsive to \n\nrequirements of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-\n\n21) Act.\n\n Statement of Need: Rollover and loss-of-control crashes involving \n\ncombination truck tractors and large buses is a serious safety issue \n\nthat is responsible for 268 fatalities and 3,000 injuries annually. \n\nThey are also a major cause of traffic tie-ups, resulting in millions \n\nof dollars of lost productivity, and excess energy consumption each \n\nyear. This action is consistent with our detailed plans for improving \n\nmotorcoach passenger protection, laid out in NHTSA's Approach to \n\nMotorcoach Safety 2007, and the Department of Transportation 2009 \n\nMotorcoach Action Plan (Docket No. NHTSA-2007-28793), as well as the \n\nagency's Vehicle Safety and Fuel Economy Rulemaking and Research \n\nPriority Plan 2011-2013 (Docket No. NHTSA-2009-0108), and is responsive \n\nto 3 recommendations issued by the National Transportation Safety \n\nBoard.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Section 30111, title 49 of the U.S.C., \n\nstates that the Secretary shall prescribe motor vehicle safety \n\nstandards.\n\n Alternatives: The Agency considered two regulatory alternatives. \n\nFirst, we considered requiring truck tractors and large buses to be \n\nequipped with roll stability control (RSC) systems. The second \n\nalternative considered was requiring trailers to be equipped with RSC \n\nsystems. When compared to the proposal, these alternatives provide \n\n\n\nfewer benefits because they are less effective at preventing rollover \n\ncrashes and much less effective at preventing loss-of-control crashes.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: According to the NPRM, the \n\nanticipated total costs are expected to be $113.6 million for the \n\n150,000 truck tractors and 2,200 large buses produced in 2012. The \n\nagency estimates the proposal has the potential to save 49 to 60 \n\nfatalities, 649 to 858 injuries, and 1,807 to 2,329 crashes annually. \n\nThe net cost per equivalent life saved at a 7 percent discount rate is \n\nestimated to range from $2.0 to $2.6 million, and for a 3 percent \n\ndiscount rate is $1.5 to $2.0 million. The net benefits are $155 to \n\n$222 million at a 7 percent discount rate, and $228 to $310 million at \n\na 3 percent discount rate.\n\n Risks: The Agency believes that there are no significant risks \n\nassociated with this rulemaking, and that only beneficial outcomes will \n\noccur.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 05/23/12 77 FR 30766\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 08/21/12 .......................\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 01/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n URL for More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL for Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: George Soodoo, Chief, Vehicle Safety Dynamics \n\nDivision (NVS-122), Department of Transportation, National Highway \n\nTraffic Safety Administration, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE., Washington, \n\nDC 20590, Phone: 202-366-2720, Fax: 202-366-4329, Email: \n\ngeorge.soodoo@dot.gov\n\n RIN: 2127-AK97\n\nDOT--FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION (FTA)\n\nProposed Rule Stage\n\n117. +State Safety Oversight (MAP-21)\n\n Priority: Other Significant.

This rulemaking will flesh out the \n\nstatutory changes to the program, and set the process for making grants \n\nof Federal funding to the States.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: 49 U.S.C. 5329(e)(9) requires the Secretary \n\nto issue regulations to carry out the State safety oversight program \n\nfor rail fixed guideway public transportation systems.\n\n Alternatives: This rulemaking will amend the regulations at 49 CFR \n\npart\n\n[[Page 76599]]\n\n659 that have been in place since 1995. The single most important \n\nchange this rulemaking entails is the flexible, scalable Safety \n\nManagement Systems (SMS) approach that the U.S. Dept. of Transportation \n\nis applying to help ensure safety in all modes of transportation-SMS \n\ncan be tailored both to the size, complexity, and mode of operation for \n\na transit system, and the State agency that is overseeing the safety of \n\na rail transit system.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: This rulemaking will not entail any \n\nsignificant change to the annualized monetary costs and benefits of the \n\nState safety oversight rules that have been in place since 1995. The \n\ncosts and benefits will be assessed during the development of the NPRM, \n\nbut it's critical to note that State safety oversight of rail transit \n\nsystems will no longer be an unfunded mandate; for the first time, \n\nunder MAP-21, Federal funding will be available to the States to assist \n\nthem in conducting their oversight, and this rulemaking will set the \n\nprocess for making the FTA grants to the States.\n\n Risks: This rulemaking will not regulate any entities other than \n\nStates that have rail fixed guideway public transportation systems and \n\nthe State safety oversight Agencies that conduct oversight of those \n\nrail transit systems. The Federal funding for State safety oversight \n\nwill be apportioned by formula, based on the statutory criteria set \n\n\n\nforth in 49 U.S.C. 5329(e)(6)(B)(i), thus, this rulemaking poses no \n\nrisks for the regulated communities other than the risks inherent in \n\nconducting the oversight of the safety of the rail transit systems for \n\nwhich they are responsible.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 01/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Undetermined.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Undetermined.\n\n Federalism: Undetermined.\n\n URL for More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL for Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Candace Key, Attorney Advisor, Department of \n\nTransportation, Federal Transit Administration, 1200 New Jersey Avenue \n\nSE., Washington, DC 20590, Phone: 202 366-9178, Email: \n\ncandace.key@dot.gov\n\n RIN: 2132-AB19\n\nDOT--PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION (PHMSA)\n\nProposed Rule Stage\n\n118. +Pipeline Safety: Safety of On-Shore Liquid Hazardous Pipelines\n\n Priority: Other Significant.

PHMSA is considering whether \n\nchanges are needed to the regulations covering hazardous liquid onshore \n\npipelines, whether other areas should be included as HCAs for integrity \n\nmanagement (IM) protections, what the repair timeframes should be for \n\nareas outside the HCAs that are assessed as part of the IM program, \n\nwhether leak detection standards are necessary, valve spacing \n\nrequirements are needed on new construction or existing pipelines, and \n\nPHMSA should extend regulation to certain pipelines currently exempt \n\nfrom regulation. The Agency would also address the public safety and \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nmailto:candace.key@dot.gov\n\n\nenvironmental aspects of any new requirements, as well as the cost \n\nimplications and regulatory burden.\n\n Statement of Need: This NPRM responds to NTSB recommendations, a \n\nGAO recommendation, public safety community input, consideration of \n\nresearch and technology advancements and the review of recent incident \n\nand accident reports. Additionally, the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory \n\nCertainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-90), includes several \n\nprovisions and mandates that are relevant to the 49 CFR particularly \n\nsection 195.452. If adopted, the proposals in this NPRM will better \n\nprotect the public, property, and the environment by ensuring that \n\nadditional pipelines are subject to improved regulation, thus \n\nincreasing the detection and remediation of pipeline anomalies.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Congress established the current framework \n\nfor regulating the safety of hazardous liquid pipelines in the \n\nHazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act (HLPSA) of 1979 (Pub. L. 96 to \n\n129). Like its predecessor, the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 \n\n(Pub. L. 90 to 481), the HLPSA provided the Secretary of Transportation \n\n(Secretary) with the authority to prescribe minimum Federal safety \n\nstandards for hazardous liquid pipeline facilities.

In particular, \n\nPHMSA will be reviewing the definition of an HCA (including the concept \n\nof a potential impact radius), the repair criteria for both HCA and \n\nnon-HCA areas, requiring the use of automatic and remote-controlled \n\nshut off valves, valve\n\n[[Page 76600]]\n\nspacing, and whether applying the integrity management program \n\nrequirements to additional areas would mitigate the need for class \n\nlocation requirements.\n\n Statement of Need: PHMSA will be reviewing the definition of an HCA \n\n(including the concept of a potential impact radius), the repair \n\ncriteria for both HCA and non-HCA areas, requiring the use of automatic \n\nand remote-controlled shut off valves, valve spacing, and whether \n\napplying the integrity management program requirements to additional \n\nareas would mitigate the need for class location requirements. This \n\nrulemaking is in direct response to Congressional mandates in the 2011 \n\nPipeline Reauthorization Act, specifically; section 4 (e) Gas IM plus 6 \n\nmonths, section 5(IM), 8 (leak detection), 23 (b)(2) (exceedance of \n\nMAOP); section 29 (seismicity).\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Congress has authorized Federal regulation \n\nof the transportation of gas by pipeline under the Commerce Clause of \n\nthe U.S. Constitution. Authorization is codified in the Pipeline Safety \n\nLaws (49 U.S.C.s 60101 et seq.), a series of statutes that are \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nmailto:john.gale@dot.gov\n\n\nadministered by the DOT and PHMSA. PHMSA has used that authority to \n\npromulgate comprehensive minimum safety standards for the \n\ntransportation of gas by pipeline.\n\n Alternatives: Alternatives analyzed included no change, and \n\nextension of the compliance deadlines associated with the major cost of \n\nthe requirement area; namely, development and implementation of \n\nmanagement-of-change processes that apply to all gas transmission \n\npipelines beyond that which already applies to beyond IMP- and control \n\ncenter-related processes.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: PHMSA does not expect the proposed \n\nrule to adversely affect the economy or any sector of the economy in \n\nterms of productivity and employment, the environment, public health, \n\nsafety, or State, local, or tribal government. PHMSA has also \n\ndetermined, as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, that the \n\nrule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial \n\nnumber of small entities in the United States. Additionally, PHMSA \n\ndetermined that the rule would not impose annual expenditures on State, \n\nlocal, or tribal governments in excess of $152 million, and thus does \n\nnot require an Unfunded Mandates Reform Act analysis. However, the rule \n\nwould impose annual expenditure in the private sector in excess of $152 \n\nmillion.\n\n Risks: This proposed rule will strengthen current pipeline \n\nregulations and lower the safety risk of all regulated entities.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nANPRM............................... 08/25/11 76 FR 5308\n\nANPRM Comment Period Extended....... 11/16/11 76 FR 70953\n\nANPRM Comment Period End............ 12/02/11 .......................\n\nEnd of ANPRM Comment Period Extended 01/20/12 .......................\n\nNPRM................................ 01/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Additional Information: SB-Y IC-N SLT-N.\n\n URL for More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL for Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\n\n\n Agency Contact: Cameron H Satterthwaite, Transportation Regulations \n\nSpecialist, Department of Transportation, Pipeline and Hazardous \n\nMaterials Safety Administration, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE., \n\nWashington, DC 20590, Phone: 202 366-8553, Email: \n\ncameron.satterthwaite@dot.gov\n\n RIN: 2137-AE72\n\nDOT--PHMSA\n\nFinal Rule Stage\n\n120. +Hazardous Materials: Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operational \n\nControls for High-Hazard Flammable Trains\n\n Priority: Economically Significant.

These \n\nnew requirements are designed to lessen the consequences of derailments \n\ninvolving ethanol crude oil and certain trains transporting a large \n\nvolume of flammable materials. The growing reliance on trains to \n\ntransport large volumes of flammable materials poses a significant risk \n\nto life property and the environment. These significant risks have been \n\nhighlighted by the recent derailments of trains carrying crude oil in \n\nCasselton, North Dakota; Aliceville, Alabama; and Lac-M[eacute]gantic, \n\nQuebec Canada. The proposed changes also address National \n\nTransportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommendations on accurate \n\nclassification, enhanced tank cars, rail routing, oversight, and \n\nadequate response capabilities.\n\n Statement of Need: This rulemaking is a crucial step by DOT to \n\nreduce the risks related to the transportation of hazardous materials \n\nby rail. Preventing tank car incidents and minimizing the consequences \n\nwhen an incident does occur are not only DOT priorities, but are also \n\nshared by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), industry, \n\nand the general public. These same groups also question the \n\nmailto:cameron.satterthwaite@dot.gov\n\n\nsurvivability of general service tank cars built to the current \n\nregulatory requirements. To this end, PHMSA will consider regulatory \n\namendments to enhance the standards for tank cars, most notably, DOT \n\nSpecification 111 tank cars used to transport certain hazardous \n\nmaterials and explore additional operational requirements to enhance \n\nthe safe transportation of hazardous materials by rail.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The authority of 49 U.S.C. 5103(b), which \n\nauthorizes the Secretary of Transportation to ``prescribe regulations \n\nfor the safe transportation, including security, of hazardous materials \n\nin intrastate, interstate, and foreign commerce.''\n\n Alternatives: PHMSA and FRA are committed to a comprehensive \n\napproach to addressing the risk and consequences of derailments \n\ninvolving hazardous materials by addressing not only survivability of \n\nrail car designs, but the operational practices of rail carriers. \n\nObtaining information and comments in an NPRM provided the greatest \n\nopportunity for public participation in the development of regulatory \n\namendments, and promote greater exchange of information and \n\nperspectives among the various stakeholders to promote future \n\nregulatory action on these issues.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The NPRM requested comments on both \n\nthe path forward and the economic impacts. We are evaluating comments \n\nprior to developing the final rule, and once the final rule is drafted \n\nthe costs and benefits will be detailed.\n\n[[Page 76601]]\n\n Risks: DOT conducted research on long-standing safety concerns \n\nregarding the survivability of the DOT Specification 111 tank cars \n\ndesigned to current HMR requirements, and used for the transportation \n\nof flammable liquids. The research found that special consideration is \n\nnecessary for the transportation of flammable liquids in DOT \n\nSpecification 111 tank cars, especially when a train is configured as a \n\nunit train. Through the research, DOT identified and ranked several \n\nenhancements to the current specifications that would increase tank car \n\nsurvivability. The highest-ranked options are low cost and the most \n\neffective at preventing loss of containment and catastrophic failure of \n\na DOT Specification 111 tank car during a derailment.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nANPRM............................... 09/06/13 78 FR 54849\n\nANPRM Comment Period End............ 11/05/13 .......................\n\n\n\nANPRM Comment Period Extended....... 11/05/13 78 FR 66326\n\nANPRM Comment Period Extended End... 12/05/13 .......................\n\nNPRM................................ 08/01/14 79 FR 45015\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 09/30/14 .......................\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 03/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Additional Information: HM-251; SB-Y, IC-Y, SLT-N; This rulemaking \n\nwill provide the greatest opportunity for public participation in the \n\ndevelopment of regulatory amendments, and promote greater exchange of \n\ninformation and perspectives among the various stakeholders.

It is \n\nthe policy of the Department to comply with applicable requirements to \n\nissue a notice of proposed rulemaking and carefully consider public \n\ncomments before adopting a final rule. Also, the Department invites \n\ninterested parties to submit views on rulemaking projects while a \n\nproposed rule is being developed.\n\n To the extent permitted by law, it is the policy of the Department \n\nto adhere to the regulatory philosophy and principles set forth in \n\nExecutive Orders 12866, 13563, and 13609 and to develop regulations \n\nthat maximize aggregate net benefits to society while minimizing the \n\neconomic and paperwork burdens imposed on persons and businesses \n\nsubject to those regulations.\n\nAlcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau\n\n The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) issues \n\nregulations to implement and enforce the Federal laws relating to \n\nalcohol, tobacco, firearms, and ammunition excise taxes and certain \n\nnon-tax laws relating to alcohol. TTB's mission and regulations are \n\ndesigned to:\n\n (1) Collect the taxes on alcohol, tobacco, firearms and ammunition;\n\n (2) Protect the consumer by ensuring the integrity of alcohol \n\nproducts; and\n\n (3) Prevent unfair and unlawful market activity for alcohol and \n\ntobacco products.\n\n In the last several years, TTB has recognized the changes in the \n\nindustries it regulates, as well as the modernized enforcement tools \n\navailable to it. As a consequence, TTB has focused on revising its \n\nregulations to ensure that it accomplishes its mission in a way that \n\nfacilitates industry growth, while at the same time protecting the \n\nrevenue and consumers of alcohol beverages. This modernization effort \n\nhas resulted in the updating of Parts 9 (American Viticultural Areas) \n\nand 19 (Distilled Spirits Plants) of Title 27 of the Code of Federal \n\nRegulations. In addition to its beverage alcohol regulations, TTB \n\npublished in fiscal year (FY) 2013, a temporary rule and concurrent \n\nNPRM pertaining to permits for importers of tobacco products and \n\nprocessed tobacco that would extend the duration of new permits from \n\nthree years to five years. Furthermore, TTB published an NPRM \n\n\n\nconcerning denatured alcohol and products made with industrial alcohol. \n\nThe proposed amendments would remove unnecessary regulatory burdens on \n\nthe industrial alcohol industry as well as TTB, and would align the \n\nregulations with current industry practice. These latter three rules \n\nall published in June 2013.\n\n In fiscal year 2014, TTB published a direct final rule amending its \n\nregulations in 27 CFR part 73 regarding the electronic submission of \n\nforms and other documents. To streamline the application process \n\nthrough TTB's secure, web-based applications (Permits Online, COLAs \n\nOnline, and Formulas Online) and to enable current and prospective \n\nindustry members to submit all required application forms \n\nelectronically, TTB amended part 73 to provide for the electronic \n\nsubmission to TTB of forms requiring third-party signatures, such as \n\nbond forms and powers of attorney. Copies of such forms, bearing all \n\nrequired signatures and seals, may now be submitted electronically, \n\nalong with a certification that the copy is an exact copy of the \n\noriginal, provided the submitter maintains the original along with \n\nother records and makes it available or submits it to TTB upon request. \n\nTTB further amended part 73 to provide that any requirement in the TTB \n\nregulations to submit a document to another agency may be met by the \n\nelectronic submission of the document to the other agency, as long as \n\nthe other agency provides for, and authorizes, the\n\n[[Page 76602]]\n\nelectronic submission of such document.\n\n In that same final rule, TTB amended its regulations in 27 CFR part \n\n19 governing the records that distilled spirits plant (DSP) proprietors \n\nmust keep of finished products, by removing the requirement that DSP \n\nproprietors keep a daily summary record of the kind of distilled \n\nspirits bottled or packaged. Finally, TTB amended its regulations in 27 \n\nCFR parts 26 and 27 regarding closures that must be affixed to \n\ncontainers of imported distilled spirits products or of such products \n\nbrought into the United States from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands. \n\nThe amendments remove a requirement that a part of the closure remain \n\nattached to the container when opened, thereby aligning the regulations \n\nfor such products with those applicable to domestic distilled spirits \n\nproducts. In summary, the amendments made by this final rule have \n\nlessened the regulatory burden on industry members by, among other \n\nchanges: (1) providing for the electronic submission of documents \n\n\n\nrequiring third-party signatures or corporate seals and of documents \n\nthat the TTB regulations require be submitted to other agencies; (2) \n\nremoving a recordkeeping requirement in 27 CFR 19.601 for DSP \n\nproprietors; and (3) removing a regulatory requirement related to the \n\ntypes of closures that must be used on certain distilled spirits \n\ncontainers.\n\n In FY 2015, TTB will continue its multi-year Regulations \n\nModernization effort by finalizing its Specially Denatured and \n\nCompletely Denatured Alcohol regulations and prioritizing projects that \n\nwill update its Labeling Requirements regulations, Import and Export \n\nregulations, Nonbeverage Products regulations, and Distilled Spirits \n\nPlant Reporting Requirements.\n\n This fiscal year TTB plans to give priority to the following \n\nregulatory matters:\n\n Revisions to Specially Denatured and Completely Denatured Alcohol \n\nRegulations. TTB proposed changes to regulations for specially \n\ndenatured alcohol (SDA) and completely denatured alcohol (CDA) that \n\nwould result in cost savings for both TTB and regulated industry \n\nmembers. These amendments are necessary because they provide a \n\nreduction in regulatory burden while posing no risk to the revenue.\n\n Under the authority of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as \n\namended (IRC), TTB regulates denatured alcohol that is unfit for \n\nbeverage use, which may be removed from a regulated distilled spirits \n\nplant free of tax. SDA and CDA are widely used in the American fuel, \n\nmedical, and manufacturing sectors. The industrial alcohol industry far \n\nexceeds the beverage alcohol industry in size and scope, and it is a \n\nrapidly growing industry in the United States. Some concerns have been \n\nraised that the current regulations may create significant roadblocks \n\nfor industry members in getting products to the marketplace quickly and \n\nefficiently. To help alleviate these concerns, TTB plans to issue a \n\nfinal rule that will reclassify certain SDA formulas as CDA and issue \n\nnew general-use formulas for articles made with SDA. As a result of \n\nthese changes, industry members would need to seek formula approval \n\nfrom TTB less frequently, and, in turn, TTB could decrease the \n\nresources it dedicates to formula review.\n\n TTB estimates that these changes will result in an 80 percent \n\nreduction in the formula approval submissions currently required from \n\nindustry members and will reduce total annual paperwork burden hours on \n\naffected industry members from 2,415 to 517 hours. The reduction in \n\nformula submissions will enable TTB to redirect its resources to \n\naddress backlogs that exist in other areas of TTB's mission activities, \n\nsuch as analyses of compliance samples for industrial/fuel alcohol to \n\n\n\nprotect the revenue and working with industry to test and approve new \n\nand more environmentally friendly denaturants. Additionally, the \n\nreclassification of certain SDA formulas to CDA formulas will not \n\njeopardize the revenue because it is more difficult to separate potable \n\nalcohol from CDA than it is from SDA, and because CDA has an offensive \n\ntaste and is less likely to be used for beverage purposes. Similarly, \n\nauthorizing new general-use formulas will not jeopardize the revenue \n\nbecause it will be difficult to remove potable alcohol from articles \n\nmade with the specific SDA formulations. Other changes made by this \n\nfinal rule will remove unnecessary regulatory burdens and update the \n\nregulations to align them with current industry practice.\n\n Revisions to the Labeling Requirements (Parts 4 (Wine), 5 \n\n(Distilled Spirits), and 7 (Malt Beverages)). The Federal Alcohol \n\nAdministration Act requires that alcohol beverages introduced in \n\ninterstate commerce have a label issued and approved under regulations \n\nprescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. In accordance with the \n\nmandate of Executive Order 13563 of January 18, 2011, regarding \n\nimproving regulation and regulatory review, TTB has conducted an \n\nanalysis of its regulations to identify any that might be outmoded, \n\nineffective, insufficient, or excessively burdensome, and to modify, \n\nstreamline, expand, or repeal them in accordance with what has been \n\nlearned. As a result of its review, TTB has near-term plans to revise \n\nthe regulations concerning the approval of labels for wine, distilled \n\nspirits, and malt beverages, to reduce the cost to TTB of reviewing and \n\napproving an ever-increasing number of applications for label approval \n\n(well over 130,000 per year). The regulations are being reviewed to \n\nassess their relevance in the 21st century. Revisions will provide \n\nclarity to industry to improve voluntary compliance. Currently, the \n\nreview and approval process requires a staff of at least 13 people for \n\nthe pre-approval of labels, in addition to management review. The goal \n\nof these regulatory changes, to be developed with industry input, is to \n\naccelerate the approval process, which will result in the regulated \n\nindustries being able to bring products to market without undue delay.\n\n Selected Revisions to Export and Import Regulations Related to the \n\nInternational Trade Data System. TTB is currently preparing for the \n\nimplementation of the International Trade Data System (ITDS) and, \n\nspecifically, the transition to an all-electronic import and export \n\nenvironment. The ITDS, as described in section 405 of the Security and \n\nAccountability for Every Port Act of 2006 (the ``SAFE Port Act'') \n\n(Public Law 109-347), is an electronic information exchange capability, \n\nor ``single window,'' through which businesses will transmit data \n\nrequired by participating agencies for the importation or exportation \n\n\n\nof cargo. To enhance Federal coordination associated with the \n\ndevelopment of the ITDS and put in place specific deadlines for \n\nimplementation, President Obama, on February 19, 2014, signed an \n\nExecutive Order (EO) on Streamlining the Export/Import Process for \n\nAmerica's Businesses. In line with section 3(e) of the EO, TTB was \n\nrequired to develop an implementation timeline for ITDS implementation. \n\nRegulatory review for transition to the all-electronic environment is \n\npart of that process.\n\n TTB has completed its review of the regulatory requirements and \n\nidentified those that it intends to update to account for the new all-\n\nelectronic environment. TTB has not only focused on identifying \n\nrequirements in order to align them with the new environment (such as \n\namending requirements that reference submission of paper documents at \n\nentry), but also is reviewing existing requirements and processes to \n\ndetermine where modifications could better take\n\n[[Page 76603]]\n\nadvantage of the all-electronic capability while reducing burden. TTB \n\nis planning to publish rulemaking on its import and export regulations \n\nin FY15, for example, this rulemaking will address the collection of \n\nTTB F 5100.31 (Application for and Certification/Exemption of Label/\n\nBottle Approval) and foreign certificate data in the ITDS environment.\n\n In recent years, TTB has identified selected sections of its export \n\nregulations (27 CFR part 28) that should be amended to assist industry \n\nmembers in complying with the regulations. Current regulations require \n\nindustry members to obtain documents and follow procedures that are \n\noutdated and not entirely consistent with current industry practices \n\nregarding exportation. As part of its effort to accommodate \n\nimplementation of ITDS, TTB's proposed regulatory revisions will also \n\nprovide industry members with clear and updated procedures for removal \n\nof alcohol for exportation without having to pay excise taxes (under \n\nthe IRC, beverage alcohol may be removed for exportation without \n\npayment of tax), thus increasing their willingness and ability to \n\nexport their products. Increasing American exports benefits the \n\nAmerican economy and is consistent with Treasury and Administration \n\npriorities.\n\n Revision of the Part 17 Regulations, ``Drawback on Taxpaid \n\nDistilled Spirits Used in Manufacturing Nonbeverage Products,'' to \n\nAllow Self-Certification of Nonbeverage Product Formulas. TTB is \n\nconsidering revisions to the regulations in 27 CFR part 17 governing \n\nnonbeverage products made with taxpaid distilled spirits. These \n\nnonbeverage products include foods, medicines, and flavors. This \n\n\n\nproposal offers a new method of formula certification by incorporating \n\nquantitative standards into the regulations and establishing new \n\nvoluntary procedures that would further streamline the formula review \n\nprocess for products that meet the standards. These proposals pose no \n\nrisk to the revenue because TTB will continue to review the formulas; \n\nhowever, TTB will not take action on certified formula submissions \n\nunless the formulas require correction. This proposal would nearly \n\neliminate the need for TTB to formally approve all nonbeverage product \n\nformulas by proposing to allow for self-certification of such formulas. \n\nThe changes would result in significant cost savings for an important \n\nindustry, which currently must obtain formula approval from TTB, and \n\nsome savings for TTB, which must review and take action to approve or \n\ndisapprove each formula.\n\n Revisions to Distilled Spirits Plant Reporting Requirements. In FY \n\n2012, TTB published an NPRM proposing to revise regulations in 27 CFR \n\npart 19 to replace the current four report forms used by distilled \n\nspirits plants to report their operations on a monthly basis with two \n\nnew report forms that would be submitted on a monthly basis. (Plants \n\nthat file taxes on a quarterly basis would submit the new reports on a \n\nquarterly basis.) This project, which was included in the President's \n\nFY 2012 budget for TTB as a cost-saving item, will address numerous \n\nconcerns and desires for improved reporting by the affected distilled \n\nspirits industry and result in cost savings to the industry and TTB by \n\nsignificantly reducing the number of monthly plant operations reports \n\nthat must be completed and filed by industry members and processed by \n\nTTB. TTB preliminarily estimates that this project will result in an \n\nannual savings of approximately 23,218 paperwork burden hours (or 11.6 \n\nstaff years) for industry members and 629 processing hours (or 0.3 \n\nstaff years) and $12,442 per year for TTB in contractor time. In \n\naddition, TTB estimates that this project will result in additional \n\nsavings in staff time (approximately 3 staff years) equaling $300,000 \n\nannually based on the more efficient and effective processing of \n\nreports and the use of report data to reconcile industry member tax \n\naccounts. Based on comments received in response to the NPRM, TTB plans \n\nto revise the proposal and re-notice the issue.\n\nBureau of the Fiscal Service\n\n The Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) administers \n\nregulations pertaining to the Government's financial activities, \n\nincluding: (1) Implementing Treasury's borrowing authority, including \n\nregulating the sale and issue of Treasury securities, (2) Administering \n\nGovernment revenue and debt collection, (3) Administering \n\nGovernmentwide accounting programs, (4) Managing certain Federal \n\ninvestments, (5) Disbursing the majority of Government electronic and \n\n\n\ncheck payments, (6) Assisting Federal agencies in reducing the number \n\nof improper payments, and (7) Providing administrative and operational \n\nsupport to Federal agencies through franchise shared services.\n\n During fiscal year 2015, the Fiscal Service will accord priority to \n\nthe following regulatory projects:\n\n Amendment to Large Position Reporting Requirements. On behalf of \n\nTreasury (Financial Markets), the Fiscal Service plans to amend the \n\nGovernment Securities Act regulations (17 CFR chapter IV) to modify the \n\nlarge position reporting rules to improve the information reported so \n\nthat Treasury can better understand supply and demand dynamics in \n\ncertain Treasury securities.\n\n Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for Publishing Delinquent Debtor \n\nInformation.

L. 104-\n\n134, 110 Stat. 1321 (DCIA) authorizes Federal agencies to publish or \n\notherwise publicly disseminate information regarding the identity of \n\npersons owing delinquent nontax debts to the United States for the \n\npurpose of collecting the debts, provided certain criteria are met. \n\nTreasury proposes to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking \n\ncomments on a proposed rule that would establish the procedures Federal \n\nagencies must follow before promulgating their own rules to publish \n\ninformation about delinquent debtors and the standards for determining \n\nwhen use of this debt collection remedy is appropriate.\n\nCommunity Development Financial Institutions Fund\n\n The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund) \n\nwas established by the Community Development Banking and Financial \n\nInstitutions Act of 1994 (12 U.S.C. 4701 et seq.). The mission of the \n\nCDFI Fund is to increase economic opportunity and promote community \n\ndevelopment investments for underserved populations and in distressed \n\ncommunities in the United States. The CDFI Fund currently administers \n\nthe following programs: The Community Development Financial \n\nInstitutions (CDFI) Program, the Bank Enterprise Award (BEA) Program, \n\nthe Native American CDFI Assistance (NACA) Program, and the New Markets \n\nTax Credit (NMTC) Program, the Financial Education and Counseling Pilot \n\nProgram (FEC), the Capital Magnet Fund (CMF), and the CDFI Bond \n\nGuarantee Program (BGP).\n\n In FY 2015, the CDFI Fund will publish updated regulations for its \n\nBEA Program and CDFI Program to incorporate the requirements of the \n\nUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit \n\nRequirements for Federal Awards (2 CFR part 200). In December 2013, the \n\nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB) published a final rule that \n\n\n\nprovides a government-wide framework for grants management, with the \n\ngoal of combining several OMB guidance circulars, reducing \n\nadministrative burden for award Recipients, and\n\n[[Page 76604]]\n\nreducing the risk of waste, fraud and abuse of Federal financial \n\nassistance. The Uniform Federal Award Requirements codifies financial, \n\nadministrative, procurement, and program management standards that \n\nFederal award agencies must follow. Each Federal agency is anticipated \n\nto codify these requirements by the end of calendar year 2014.\n\nCustoms Revenue Functions\n\n The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (the Act) provides that the \n\nSecretary of the Treasury retains sole legal authority over the customs \n\nrevenue functions. The Act also authorizes the Secretary of the \n\nTreasury to delegate any of the retained authority over customs revenue \n\nfunctions to the Secretary of Homeland Security. By Treasury Department \n\nOrder No. 100-16, the Secretary of the Treasury delegated to the \n\nSecretary of Homeland Security authority to prescribe regulations \n\npertaining to the customs revenue functions subject to certain \n\nexceptions. This Order further provided that the Secretary of the \n\nTreasury retained the sole authority to approve such regulations.\n\n During the past fiscal year, among the customs-revenue function \n\nregulations issued were the United States--Colombia Trade Promotion \n\nAgreement final rule, the United States--Panama Trade Promotion \n\nAgreement final rule, and the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) \n\nand Generalized System of Preferences and Trade Benefits under AGOA \n\nfinal rule. On October 1, 2013, U.S. Customs and Border Protection \n\n(CBP) published the United States--Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement \n\nfinal rule (78 FR 60191) that adopted interim amendments (77 FR 59064) \n\nof September 26, 2012, to the CBP regulations which implemented the \n\npreferential tariff treatment and other customs-related provisions of \n\nthe United States--Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation \n\nAct. On May 21, 2014, CBP issued the United States--Panama Trade \n\nPromotion Agreement final rule (79 FR 29077) that adopted interim \n\namendments (78 FR 63052) of October 23, 2013, to the CBP regulations, \n\nwhich implemented the preferential tariff treatment and other customs-\n\nrelated provisions of the United States-Panama Trade Promotion \n\nAgreement Implementation Act that took effect on October 31, 2012. In \n\naddition, CBP issued the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and \n\n\n\nGeneralized System of Preferences and Trade Benefits under AGOA final \n\nrule (79 FR 30356) on May 27, 2014, that adopted the interim amendments \n\n(65 FR 59668 and 68 FR 13820) of October 5, 2000, and March 21, 2003, \n\nrespectively, to the CBP regulations.\n\n On December 18, 2013, Treasury and CBP published a final rule \n\ntitled Members of a Family for Purposes of Filing a CBP Family \n\nDeclaration (78 FR 76529) that amended the regulations by expanding the \n\ndefinition of the term, ``members of a family residing in one \n\nhousehold,'' to allow more U.S. returning residents traveling as a \n\nfamily upon their arrival in the United States to be eligible to group \n\ntheir duty exemptions and file a single customs declaration for \n\narticles acquired abroad.\n\n This past fiscal year, consistent with the goals of Executive \n\nOrders 12866 and 13563, Treasury and CBP proposed changes to \n\nDocumentation Related to Goods Imported From U.S. Insular Possessions \n\non January 14, 2014 (79 FR 2395), to eliminate the requirement that a \n\ncustoms officer at the port of export verify and sign CBP Form 3229, \n\nCertificate of Origin for U.S. Insular Possessions, and to require \n\ninstead that the importer present this form, upon CBP's request, rather \n\nthan submit it with each entry as the current regulations require. The \n\nchanges proposed would streamline the entry process by making it more \n\nefficient as it would reduce the overall administrative burden on both \n\nthe trade and CBP. If the importer does not maintain CBP Form 3229 in \n\nits possession, the importer may be subject to a recordkeeping penalty. \n\nCBP plans to finalize this rule during fiscal year 2015.\n\n During fiscal year 2015, CBP and Treasury also plan to give \n\npriority to the following regulatory matters involving the customs \n\nrevenue functions:\n\n In-Bond Process. Consistent with the practice of continuing to move \n\nforward with Customs Modernization provisions of the North American \n\nFree Trade Implementation Act to improve its regulatory procedures, \n\nTreasury and CBP plan to finalize this fiscal year the proposal to \n\nchange the in-bond process by issuing final regulations to amend the \n\nin-bond regulations that were proposed on February 22, 2012 (77 FR \n\n10622). The proposed changes, including the automation of the in-bond \n\nprocess, would modernize, simplify, and facilitate the in-bond process \n\nwhile enhancing CBP's ability to regulate and track in-bond merchandise \n\nto ensure that in-bond merchandise is properly entered or exported.\n\n Free Trade Agreements. Treasury and CBP also plan to issue final \n\nregulations this fiscal year to implement the preferential trade \n\nbenefit provisions of the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement \n\n\n\nImplementation Act. Treasury and CBP also expect to issue interim \n\nregulations implementing the preferential trade benefit provisions of \n\nthe United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act.\n\n Customs and Border Protection's Bond Program. Treasury and CBP plan \n\nto publish a final rule amending the regulations to reflect the \n\ncentralization of the continuous bond program at CBP's Revenue \n\nDivision. The changes proposed would support CBP's bond program by \n\nensuring an efficient and uniform approach to the approval, \n\nmaintenance, and periodic review of continuous bonds, as well as \n\naccommodating the use of information technology and modern business \n\npractices.\n\n Disclosure of Information for Certain Intellectual Property Rights \n\nEnforced at the Border. Treasury and CBP plan to finalize interim \n\namendments to the CBP regulations which provides a pre-seizure notice \n\nprocedure for disclosing information appearing on the imported \n\nmerchandise and/or its retail packing suspected of bearing a \n\ncounterfeit mark to an intellectual property right holder for the \n\nlimited purpose of obtaining the right holder's assistance in \n\ndetermining whether the mark is counterfeit or not.\n\nInternal Revenue Service\n\n The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), working with the Office of Tax \n\nPolicy, promulgates regulations that interpret and implement the \n\nInternal Revenue Code and related tax statutes. The purpose of these \n\nregulations is to carry out the tax policy determined by Congress in a \n\nfair, impartial, and reasonable manner, taking into account the intent \n\nof Congress, the realities of relevant transactions, the need for the \n\nGovernment to administer the rules and monitor compliance, and the \n\noverall integrity of the Federal tax system. The goal is to make the \n\nregulations practical and as clear and simple as possible.\n\n During fiscal year 2015, the IRS will accord priority to the \n\nfollowing regulatory projects:\n\n Tax-Related Affordable Care Act Provisions. On March 23, 2010, the \n\nPresident signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 \n\n(Pub. L. 111-148) and on March 30, 2010, the President signed the \n\nHealth Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-152) \n\n(referred to collectively as the Affordable Care Act (ACA)). The ACA's \n\nreform of the health insurance system affects individuals, families, \n\nemployers, health care providers, and health insurance providers. The \n\nACA provides authority for Treasury and the IRS to issue regulations \n\nand other guidance to\n\n\n\n[[Page 76605]]\n\nimplement tax provisions in the ACA, some of which are already \n\neffective and some of which will become effective over the next several \n\nyears. Since enactment of the ACA, Treasury and the IRS have issued a \n\nseries of temporary, proposed, and final regulations implementing over \n\na dozen provisions of the ACA, including the premium tax credit under \n\nsection 36B, the small-business health coverage tax credit under \n\nsection 45R, new requirements for charitable hospitals under section \n\n501(r), limits on tax preferences for remuneration provided by certain \n\nhealth insurance providers under section 162(m)(6), the employer shared \n\nresponsibility provisions under section 4980H, the individual shared \n\nresponsibility provisions under section 5000A, insurer and employer \n\nreporting under sections 6055 and 6056, and several revenue-raising \n\nprovisions, including fees on branded prescription drugs under section \n\n9008 of the ACA, fees on health insurance providers under section 9010 \n\nof the ACA, the tax on indoor tanning services under 5000B, the net \n\ninvestment income tax under section 1411, and the additional Medicare \n\ntax under sections 3101 and 3102.\n\n In fiscal year 2015, Treasury and the IRS will continue to provide \n\nguidance to implement tax provisions of the ACA, including:\n\n Final regulations related to numerous aspects of the \n\npremium tax credit under section 36B, including the determination of \n\nminimum value of eligible-employer-sponsored plans;\n\n Final regulations on application for recognition of tax \n\nexemption as a qualified nonprofit health insurer under section \n\n501(c)(29);\n\n Final regulations on new requirements for charitable \n\nhospitals under section 501(r);\n\n Final regulations regarding issues related to the net \n\ninvestment income tax under section 1411; and\n\n Final regulations concerning minimum essential coverage \n\nand other rules regarding the individual shared responsibility \n\nprovision under section 5000A.\n\n Interest on Deferred Tax Liability for Contingent Payment \n\nInstallment Sales. Section 453 of the Internal Revenue Code generally \n\nallows taxpayers to report the gain from a sale of property in the \n\ntaxable year or years in which payments are received, rather than in \n\nthe year of sale. Section 453A of the Code imposes an interest charge \n\non the tax liability that is deferred as a result of reporting the gain \n\n\n\nwhen payments are received. The interest charge generally applies to \n\ninstallment obligations that arise from a sale of property using the \n\ninstallment method if the sales price of the property exceeds $150,000, \n\nand the face amount of all such installment obligations held by a \n\ntaxpayer that arose during, and are outstanding as of the close of, a \n\ntaxable year exceeds $5,000,000. The interest charge provided in \n\nsection 453A cannot be determined under the terms of the statute if an \n\ninstallment obligation provides for contingent payments. Accordingly, \n\nin section 453A(c)(6), Congress authorized the Secretary of the \n\nTreasury to issue regulations providing for the application of section \n\n453A in the case of installment sales with contingent payments. \n\nTreasury and the IRS intend to issue proposed regulations that, when \n\nfinalized, will provide guidance and reduce uncertainty regarding the \n\napplication of section 453A to contingent payments.\n\n Rules for Home Construction Contracts. In general, section 460(a) \n\nrequires taxpayers to use the percentage-of-completion method (PCM) to \n\naccount for taxable income from any long-term contract. Under the PCM, \n\nincome is generally reported in installments as work is performed, and \n\nexpenses are generally deducted in the taxable year incurred. However, \n\ntaxpayers with contracts that meet the definition of a ``home \n\nconstruction contract,'' under section 460(e)(4), are not required to \n\nuse the PCM for those contracts and may, instead, use an exempt method. \n\nExempt methods include the completed contract method (CCM) and the \n\naccrual method. Under the CCM, for example, a taxpayer generally takes \n\ninto account the entire gross contract price and all incurred allocable \n\ncontract costs in the taxable year the taxpayer completes the contract. \n\nTreasury and the IRS believe that amended rules are needed to reduce \n\nuncertainty and controversy, including litigation, regarding when a \n\ncontract qualifies as a ``home construction contract'' and when the \n\nincome and allocable deductions are taken into account under the CCM. \n\nOn August 4, 2008, Treasury and the IRS published proposed regulations \n\non the types of contracts that are eligible for the home construction \n\ncontract exemption. The preamble to those regulations stated that \n\nTreasury and the IRS expected to propose additional rules specific to \n\nhome construction contracts accounted for using the CCM. After \n\nconsidering comments received and the need for additional and clearer \n\nrules to reduce ongoing uncertainty and controversy, Treasury and the \n\nIRS have determined that it would be beneficial to taxpayers to present \n\nall of the proposed changes to the current regulations in a single \n\n\n\ndocument. Treasury and the IRS plan to withdraw the 2008 proposed \n\nregulations and replace them with new, more comprehensive proposed \n\nregulations.\n\n Research Expenditures. Section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code \n\nprovides a credit against taxable income for certain expenses paid or \n\nincurred in conducting research activities. To assist in resolving \n\nareas of controversy and uncertainty with respect to research expenses, \n\nTreasury and the IRS plan to issue regulations with respect to the \n\ndefinition and credit eligibility of expenditures for internal use \n\nsoftware, the election of the alternative simplified credit, and the \n\nallocation of the credit among members of a controlled group.\n\n Estate Tax Portability of Decedent's Unused Exclusion Amount. The \n\nTax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation \n\nAct of 2010 (TRA of 2010) amended sections 2010 and 2505 of the \n\nInternal Revenue Code to provide an estate of a decedent survived by a \n\nspouse the opportunity to transfer, or port, unused applicable \n\nexclusion amount to and for the benefit of the surviving spouse. \n\nAlthough the portability provisions of TRA of 2010 were originally \n\nscheduled to expire on December 31, 2012, the American Taxpayer Relief \n\nAct of 2012 made the portability provisions permanent. Treasury and the \n\nIRS plan to issue final regulations on or before June 15, 2015, to \n\nreplace sunsetting temporary regulations. The final regulations will \n\nprovide rules for electing portability, determining the unused \n\nexclusion amount available from the estate of the first-to-die spouse \n\nto the surviving spouse, and applying the ported unused exclusion \n\namount to the surviving spouse's subsequent transfers.\n\n Arbitrage Investment Restrictions on Tax-Exempt Bonds. The \n\narbitrage investment restrictions on tax-exempt bonds under section 148 \n\ngenerally limit issuers from investing bond proceeds in higher-yielding \n\ninvestments. On September 16, 2013, Treasury and the IRS published \n\nproposed regulations (78 FR 56842) to address selected current issues \n\ninvolving the arbitrage investment restrictions, including guidance on \n\nthe issue price definition used in the computation of bond yield, \n\nworking capital financings, grants, investment valuation, \n\nmodifications, terminations of qualified hedging transactions, and \n\nselected other issues. Treasury and the IRS plan to provide additional \n\nguidance on the arbitrage investment restrictions, including guidance \n\non the issue price definition used in the computation of bond yield.\n\n[[Page 76606]]\n\n\n\n Guidance on the Definition of Political Subdivision for Tax-Exempt, \n\nTax-Credit, and Direct-Pay Bonds. A political subdivision may be a \n\nvalid issuer of tax-exempt, tax-credit, and direct-pay bonds. Concerns \n\nhave been raised about what is required for an entity to be a political \n\nsubdivision. Treasury and the IRS plan to provide additional guidance \n\nunder section 103 for determining when an entity is a political \n\nsubdivision.\n\n Contingent Notional Principal Contract Regulations. Notice 2001-44 \n\n(2001-2 CB 77) outlined four possible approaches for recognizing \n\nnonperiodic payments made or received on a notional principal contract \n\n(NPC) when the contract includes a nonperiodic payment that is \n\ncontingent in fact or in amount. The Notice solicited further comments \n\nand information on the treatment of such payments. After considering \n\nthe comments received in response to Notice 2001-44, Treasury and the \n\nIRS published proposed regulations (69 FR 8886) (the 2004 proposed \n\nregulations) that would amend section 1.446-3 and provide additional \n\nrules regarding the timing and character of income, deduction, gain, or \n\nloss with respect to such nonperiodic payments, including termination \n\npayments. On December 7, 2007, Treasury and IRS released Notice 2008-2 \n\nrequesting comments and information with respect to transactions \n\nfrequently referred to as prepaid forward contracts. Treasury and the \n\nIRS plan to re-propose regulations to address issues relating to the \n\ntiming and character of nonperiodic contingent payments on NPCs, \n\nincluding termination payments and payments on prepaid forward \n\ncontracts.\n\n Tax Treatment of Distressed Debt. A number of tax issues relating \n\nto the amount, character, and timing of income, expense, gain, or loss \n\non distressed debt remain unresolved. In addition, the tax treatment of \n\ndistressed debt, including distressed debt that has been modified, may \n\naffect the qualification of certain entities for tax purposes or result \n\nin additional taxes on the investors in such entities, such as \n\nregulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts (REITs), \n\nand real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs). During fiscal \n\nyear 2014, Treasury and the IRS addressed some of these issues through \n\npublished guidance, including guidance on an entity's qualification as \n\na REIT in the context of transactions involving distressed mortgage \n\nloans. Treasury and the IRS plan to address more of these issues in \n\npublished guidance.\n\n Definition of Real Property and Qualifying Income for REIT \n\nPurposes. A taxpayer must satisfy certain asset and income requirements \n\nto qualify as a REIT under section 856. REITs have sought to invest in \n\nvarious types of assets that are not directly addressed by the current \n\n\n\nregulations or other published guidance. On May 14, 2014, Treasury and \n\nthe IRS published proposed regulations (79 FR 27508) to update and \n\nclarify the definition of real property for REIT qualification \n\npurposes, including guidance addressing whether a component of a larger \n\nitem is tested on its own or only as part of the larger item, the scope \n\nof the asset to be tested, and whether certain intangible assets \n\nqualify as real property. Treasury and the IRS plan to finalize the \n\nproposed regulations in the fiscal year. Treasury and the IRS also plan \n\nto provide guidance clarifying the definition of income for purposes of \n\nsection 856.\n\n Corporate Spin-offs and Split-offs. Section 355 and related \n\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code allow for the tax-free \n\ndistribution of stock or securities of a controlled corporation if \n\ncertain requirements are met. For example, the distributing corporation \n\nmust distribute a controlling interest in the controlled corporation, \n\nand both the distributing and controlled corporations must be engaged \n\nin the active conduct of a trade or business immediately after the \n\ndistribution. The Treasury Department and the IRS intend to provide \n\nguidance on the qualification of a distribution for tax-free treatment \n\nunder section 355, including (1) final regulations that address when a \n\ncorporation is treated as engaged in an active trade or business, and \n\n(2) final regulations that define predecessor or successor corporation \n\nfor purposes of the exception to tax-free treatment under section \n\n355(e). The Treasury Department and the IRS also intend to provide \n\nguidance relating to the tax treatment of other transactions undertaken \n\nas part of a plan that includes a distribution of stock or securities \n\nof a controlled corporation, such as changes to the voting power of the \n\ncontrolled corporation's stock in anticipation of the distribution, the \n\nissuance of debt of the distributing corporation and retirement of such \n\ndebt using stock or securities of the controlled corporation, and the \n\ntransfer of cash or property between a distributing or controlled \n\ncorporation and its shareholder(s) in connection with the distribution.\n\n Disguised Sale and Allocation of Liabilities. A contribution of \n\nproperty by a partner to a partnership may be recharacterized as a sale \n\nunder section 707(a)(2)(B) if the partnership distributes to the \n\ncontributing partner cash or other property that is, in substance, \n\nconsideration for the contribution. The allocation of partnership \n\nliabilities to the partners under section 752 may impact the \n\ndetermination of whether a disguised sale has occurred and whether gain \n\nis otherwise recognized upon a distribution. Treasury and the IRS \n\nissued proposed regulations to address certain issues that arise in the \n\n\n\ndisguised sale context and other issues regarding the partners' shares \n\nof partnership liabilities. Treasury and the IRS are considering \n\ncomments on the proposed regulations and expect to issue regulations in \n\nfiscal year 2015.\n\n Certain Partnership Distributions Treated as Sales or Exchanges. In \n\n1954, Congress enacted section 751 to prevent the use of a partnership \n\nto convert potential ordinary income into capital gain. In 1956, \n\nTreasury and the IRS issued regulations implementing section 751. The \n\ncurrent regulations, however, do not always achieve the purpose of the \n\nstatute. In 2006, Treasury and the IRS published Notice 2006-14 (2006-1 \n\nCB 498) to propose and solicit alternative approaches to section 751 \n\nthat better achieve the purpose of the statute while providing greater \n\nsimplicity. Treasury and the IRS are currently working on proposed \n\nregulations following up on Notice 2006-14. These regulations will \n\nprovide guidance on determining a partner's interest in a partnership's \n\nsection 751 property and how a partnership recognizes income required \n\nby section 751.\n\n Penalties and Limitation Periods. Congress amended several penalty \n\nprovisions in the Internal Revenue Code in the past several years. \n\nTreasury and the IRS intend to publish a number of guidance projects in \n\nfiscal year 2015 addressing these penalty provisions. Specifically, \n\nTreasury and the IRS intend to publish final regulations under section \n\n6708 regarding the penalty for failure to make available upon request a \n\nlist of advisees that is required to be maintained under section 6112. \n\nThe proposed regulations were published on March 8, 2013. Treasury and \n\nthe IRS also intend to publish proposed regulations under sections \n\n6662, 6662A, and 6664 to provide further guidance on the circumstances \n\nunder which a taxpayer could be subject to the accuracy related penalty \n\non underpayments or reportable transaction understatements and the \n\nreasonable cause exception. Further, Treasury and the IRS intend to \n\npublish (1) final regulations under section 6501(c)(10) regarding the \n\nextension of\n\n[[Page 76607]]\n\nthe period of limitations to assess any tax with respect to a listed \n\ntransaction that was not disclosed as required under section 6011, and \n\n(2) proposed regulations under section 6707A addressing statutory \n\nchanges to the method of computing the penalty for failure to disclose \n\nreportable transactions.\n\n Inversion Transactions. On September 22, 2014, Treasury and the IRS \n\nissued Notice 2014-52, addressing the application of sections 7874 and \n\n\n\n367 to inversions, as well as certain tax avoidance transactions that \n\nare undertaken after an inversion transaction. In this fiscal year, \n\nTreasury and the IRS expect to issue regulations implementing the rules \n\ndescribed in Notice 2014-52. Also in this fiscal year, Treasury and the \n\nIRS expect to issue additional guidance to further limit inversion \n\ntransactions that are contrary to the purposes of section 7874 and the \n\nbenefits of post-inversion tax avoidance transactions. In addition, \n\nunder the terms of the statute, section 7874 will not apply to an \n\ninversion if the post-transaction group has substantial business \n\nactivities in the country in which the foreign acquiring corporation is \n\norganized when compared to the total business activities of the group. \n\nOn June 7, 2012, Treasury and the IRS issued temporary regulations \n\nregarding the determination of whether a group satisfies the \n\nsubstantial business activities test. During fiscal year 2015, Treasury \n\nand the IRS intend to finalize these regulations.\n\n Information Reporting for Foreign Accounts of U.S. Persons. In \n\nMarch 2010, chapter 4 (sections 1471 to 1474) was added to subtitle A \n\nof the Internal Revenue Code as part of the Hiring Incentives to \n\nRestore Employment Act (HIRE Act) (Pub. L. 111-147). Chapter 4 was \n\nenacted to address concerns with offshore tax evasion by U.S. citizens \n\nand residents and generally requires foreign financial institutions \n\n(FFIs) to enter into an agreement (FFI Agreement) with the IRS to \n\nreport information regarding financial accounts of U.S. persons and \n\ncertain foreign entities with significant U.S. ownership. An FFI that \n\ndoes not enter into an FFI Agreement, or that is not otherwise deemed \n\ncompliant with FATCA, generally will be subject to a withholding tax on \n\nthe gross amount of certain payments from U.S. sources. The Treasury \n\nDepartment and the IRS have issued proposed, temporary, and final \n\nregulations under chapter 4; and proposed and temporary regulations \n\nunder chapters 3 and 61, and section 3406, to coordinate with those \n\nchapter 4 regulations; as well as implementing revenue procedures and \n\nother guidance. The Treasury Department and the IRS expect to issue \n\nfurther guidance with respect to FATCA and related provisions in this \n\nfiscal year.\n\n Withholding on Certain Dividend Equivalent Payments on Certain \n\nEquity Derivatives. The HIRE Act also added section 871(l) to the Code \n\n(now section 871(m)), which designates certain substitute dividend \n\npayments in security lending and sale-repurchase transactions and \n\ndividend-referenced payments made under certain notional principal \n\ncontracts as U.S.-source dividends for Federal tax purposes. In \n\nresponse to this legislation, on May 20, 2010, the IRS issued Notice \n\n2010-46, addressing the requirements for determining the proper \n\n\n\nwithholding in connection with substitute dividends paid in foreign-to-\n\nforeign security lending and sale-repurchase transactions. On January \n\n23, 2012, Treasury and the IRS issued temporary and proposed \n\nregulations addressing cases in which dividend equivalents will be \n\nfound to arise in connection with notional principal contracts and \n\nother financial derivatives. On December 5, 2013, Treasury and the IRS \n\nreleased final regulations relating to the 2012 temporary and proposed \n\nregulations. At the same time, Treasury and the IRS issued new proposed \n\nregulations based on comments received with respect to the 2012 \n\nproposed regulations. Treasury and the IRS expect to finalize these \n\nregulations in this fiscal year.\n\n International Tax Provisions of the Education Jobs and Medicaid \n\nAssistance Act. On August 10, 2010, the Education Jobs and Medicaid \n\nAssistance Act of 2010 (EJMAA) (Pub. L. 111-226) was signed into law. \n\nThe law includes a significant package of international tax provisions, \n\nincluding limitations on the availability of foreign tax credits in \n\ncertain cases in which U.S. tax law and foreign tax law provide \n\ndifferent rules for recognizing income and gain, and in cases in which \n\nincome items treated as foreign source under certain tax treaties would \n\notherwise be sourced in the United States. The legislation also limits \n\nthe ability of multinationals to reduce their U.S. tax burdens by using \n\na provision intended to prevent corporations from avoiding U.S. income \n\ntax on repatriated corporate earnings. Other new provisions under this \n\nlegislation limit the ability of multinational corporations to use \n\nacquisitions of related party stock to avoid U.S. tax on what would \n\notherwise be taxable distributions of dividends. The statute also \n\nincludes a new provision intended to tighten the rules under which \n\ninterest expense is allocated between U.S.- and foreign-source income \n\nwithin multinational groups of related corporations when a foreign \n\ncorporation has significant amounts of U.S.-source income that is \n\neffectively connected with a U.S. business. Treasury and the IRS \n\npublished temporary and proposed regulations addressing foreign tax \n\ncredits under section 909 in 2012, published temporary and proposed \n\nregulations in 2012 and final regulations in 2014 updating the interest \n\nallocation regulations to conform to the 2010 amendments to section \n\n864(e)(5)(A), and issued two notices providing guidance under section \n\n901(m) in 2014. Treasury and the IRS expect to issue additional \n\nguidance on EJMAA in this fiscal year, including additional guidance \n\nunder section 901(m), final regulations under section 909, and \n\n\n\ntemporary and proposed regulations under section 304(b)(5)(B).\n\n Transfers of Intangibles to Foreign Corporations. Section 367(d) of \n\nthe Internal Revenue Code requires, except as provided in regulations, \n\na U.S. person who transfers intangible property to a foreign \n\ncorporation in an exchange described in section 351 or section 361 of \n\nthe Code to treat the transfer as a sale for payments which are \n\ncontingent upon the productivity, use, or disposition of such property, \n\nand to take into account amounts which reasonably reflect the amounts \n\nwhich would have been received annually in the form of such payments \n\nover the useful life of such property, or at the time of the \n\ndisposition of the property. The amounts so taken into account must be \n\ncommensurate with the income attributable to the intangible. Under \n\nexisting temporary regulations issued in 1986, section 367(d) is made \n\ninapplicable to the transfer of ``foreign goodwill or going concern \n\nvalue,'' as defined in the regulations. The existing regulations \n\nprovide general guidance regarding the application of section 367(d), \n\nalthough controversy regarding the application of section 367(d) to \n\ncertain transfers led the Treasury and the IRS to publish Notice 2012-\n\n39 on July 13, 2012. Treasury and the IRS intend to issue additional \n\nguidance in this fiscal year to reduce uncertainty and controversy in \n\nthis area.\n\n Section 501(c) guidance. After reviewing over 150,000 comments \n\nsubmitted on the proposed regulations under section 501(c)(4) published \n\nin fiscal year 2014, Treasury and the IRS plan to issue revised \n\nproposed regulations that provide guidance under section 501(c) \n\nrelating to limitations on political campaign activities of certain \n\ntax-exempt organizations.\n\n[[Page 76608]]\n\n Guidance responding to the SEC's money market reform rule. On July \n\n23, 2014, the SEC adopted a final rule to reduce the systemic risk that \n\nmoney market funds present to the national economy. Later that day, IRS \n\nand the Treasury Department issued simplifying guidance designed to \n\nameliorate the tax compliance difficulties that the SEC rule would \n\notherwise pose to certain money market funds and their shareholders. In \n\nfiscal year 2015, the Treasury Department and the IRS intend to \n\nfinalize the portion of this simplifying guidance that is only \n\nproposed.\n\n Guidance Relating to Publicly Traded Partnerships. Section 7704 of \n\nthe Internal Revenue Code provides that a partnership whose interests \n\n\n\nare traded on either an established securities market or on a secondary \n\nmarket (a ``publicly traded partnership'') is generally treated as a \n\ncorporation for Federal tax purposes. However, section 7704(c) permits \n\npublicly traded partnerships to be treated as partnerships for Federal \n\ntax purposes if 90 percent or more of partnership income consists of \n\n``qualifying income.'' Section 7704(d) provides that income is \n\ngenerally qualifying income if it is passive income or is derived from \n\nexploration, development, mining or production, processing, refining, \n\ntransportation, or marketing of a mineral or natural resource. \n\nLegislative history accompanying section 7704(d) provides little \n\ninsight into the intended scope of this natural resource exception, and \n\nno administrative guidance has been issued. As technologies and \n\ncommercial practices in the natural resource industries have evolved, \n\nuncertainty has arisen about the proper interpretation of the natural \n\nresource exception. Treasury and the IRS intend to issue guidance in \n\nthis fiscal year to reduce uncertainty in this area.\n\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network\n\n As chief administrator of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), the Financial \n\nCrimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is responsible for developing and \n\nimplementing regulations that are the core of the Department's anti-\n\nmoney laundering and counter-terrorism financing efforts. FinCEN's \n\nresponsibilities and objectives are linked to, and flow from, that \n\nrole. In fulfilling this role, FinCEN seeks to enhance U.S. national \n\nsecurity by making the financial system increasingly resistant to abuse \n\nby money launderers, terrorists and their financial supporters, and \n\nother perpetrators of crime.\n\n The Secretary of the Treasury, through FinCEN, is authorized by the \n\nBSA to issue regulations requiring financial institutions to file \n\nreports and keep records that are determined to have a high degree of \n\nusefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory matters or in the conduct of \n\nintelligence or counter-intelligence activities to protect against \n\ninternational terrorism. The BSA also authorizes requiring designated \n\nfinancial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs and \n\ncompliance procedures. To implement and realize its mission, FinCEN has \n\nestablished regulatory objectives and priorities to safeguard the \n\nfinancial system from the abuses of financial crime, including \n\nterrorist financing, money laundering, and other illicit activity. \n\nThese objectives and priorities include: (1) issuing, interpreting, and \n\nenforcing compliance with regulations implementing the BSA; (2) \n\nsupporting, working with, and as appropriate, overseeing compliance \n\nexamination functions delegated to other Federal regulators; (3) \n\nmanaging the collection, processing, storage, and dissemination of data \n\n\n\nrelated to the BSA; (4) maintaining a government-wide access service to \n\nthat same data and for network users with overlapping interests; (5) \n\nconducting analysis in support of policymakers, law enforcement, \n\nregulatory and intelligence agencies, and the financial sector; and (6) \n\ncoordinating with and collaborating on anti-terrorism and anti-money \n\nlaundering initiatives with domestic law enforcement and intelligence \n\nagencies, as well as foreign financial intelligence units.\n\n During fiscal year 2014, FinCEN issued the following regulatory \n\nactions:\n\n Amendments to the Definitions of Funds Transfer and Transmittal of \n\nFunds in the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) Regulations. On December 5, 2013, \n\nFinCEN issued a Final Rule jointly with the Board of Governors of the \n\nFederal Reserve System amending the regulatory definitions of ``funds \n\ntransfer'' and ``transmittal of funds'' under the regulations \n\nimplementing the BSA. The changes maintain the existing scope to the \n\ndefinitions and were necessary in light of changes to the Electronic \n\nFund Transfer Act that would have resulted in certain currently covered \n\ntransactions being excluded from BSA requirements.\n\n Anti-Money Laundering Program and Suspicious Activity Reporting \n\n(SAR) Requirements for Housing Government-Sponsored Enterprises. On \n\nFebruary 25, 2014, FinCEN issued a Final Rule defining certain housing \n\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises as financial institutions for the \n\npurpose of requiring them to establish anti-money laundering programs \n\nand report suspicious activity to FinCEN pursuant to the BSA.\n\n Imposition of Special Measure against FBME Bank Ltd., formerly \n\nknown as Federal Bank of the Middle East, Ltd., as a Financial \n\nInstitution of Primary Money Laundering Concern. On July 22, 2014, \n\nFinCEN issued a finding that FBME Bank Ltd. (FBME) is a financial \n\ninstitution operating outside of the United States that is of primary \n\nmoney laundering concern under section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act. On \n\nJuly 22, 2014, FinCEN issued an NPRM to impose the fifth special \n\nmeasure against the institution. The fifth special measure prohibits or \n\nconditions the opening or maintaining of correspondent or payable-\n\nthrough accounts for the designated institution by U.S. financial \n\ninstitutions. In conjunction with the NPRM, FinCEN issued an order \n\nimposing certain recordkeeping and reporting obligations on covered \n\nfinancial institutions and principal money transmitters with respect to \n\ntransactions involving FBME.\n\n Customer Due Diligence Requirements. On August 4, 2014, FinCEN \n\nissued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to solicit public comment \n\non proposed rules under the BSA to clarify and strengthen customer due \n\ndiligence requirements for banks, brokers or dealers in securities, \n\n\n\nmutual funds, and futures commission merchants and introducing brokers \n\nin commodities. The proposed rules contain explicit customer due \n\ndiligence requirements and include a new regulatory requirement to \n\nidentify beneficial owners of legal entity customers, subject to \n\ncertain exemptions.\n\n Administrative Rulings and Written Guidance. FinCEN published 13 \n\nadministrative rulings and written guidance pieces, and provided 45 \n\nresponses to written inquiries/correspondence interpreting the BSA and \n\nproviding clarity to regulated industries.\n\n FinCEN's regulatory priorities for fiscal year 2015 include \n\nfinalizing any initiatives mentioned above that are not finalized by \n\nfiscal year end, as well as the following in-process and potential \n\nprojects:\n\n Amendment to the BSA Regulations--Definition of Monetary \n\nInstrument. On October 17, 2011, FinCEN published an NPRM regarding \n\ninternational transport of prepaid access devices because of the \n\npotential to substitute prepaid access for cash and other monetary \n\ninstruments as a means to smuggle the proceeds of illegal activity into \n\nand out of the United States. FinCEN continues to consider the issue \n\nbased on comments\n\n[[Page 76609]]\n\nreceived and developments in the prepaid industry. FinCEN intends to \n\nissue a supplemental NPRM to provide additional information for \n\nconsideration and comment by the public.\n\n Anti-Money Laundering Program and SAR Requirements for Investment \n\nAdvisers. FinCEN has drafted an NPRM that would prescribe minimum \n\nstandards for anti-money laundering programs to be established by \n\ncertain investment advisers and to require such investment advisers to \n\nreport suspicious activity to FinCEN. FinCEN has been working closely \n\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission on issues related to the \n\ndraft NPRM.\n\n Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts. FinCEN has drafted \n\nan NPRM to address requests from filers for clarification of certain \n\nrequirements regarding the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial \n\nAccounts (FBAR) including requirements with respect to employees, who \n\nhave signature authority over, but no financial interest in, the \n\nforeign financial accounts of their employers.\n\n Cross Border Electronic Transmittal of Funds. On September 27, \n\n2010, FinCEN issued an NPRM in conjunction with the feasibility study \n\nprepared pursuant to the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention \n\n\n\nAct of 2004 concerning the issue of obtaining information about certain \n\ncross-border funds transfers and transmittals of funds. As FinCEN has \n\ncontinued to work on developing the system to receive, store, and use \n\nthis data, FinCEN has drafted a Supplemental NPRM to update the \n\npreviously published proposed rule and provide additional information \n\nto those banks and money transmitters that will become subject to the \n\nrule.\n\n Anti-Money Laundering Program Requirements for Banks Lacking a \n\nFederal Functional Regulator. FinCEN has drafted an NPRM to remove the \n\nanti-money laundering (AML) program exemption for banks that lack a \n\nFederal functional regulator, including, but not limited to, private \n\nbanks, non-federally insured credit unions, and certain trust \n\ncompanies. The proposed rule prescribes minimum standards for AML \n\nprograms and would ensure that all banks, regardless of whether they \n\nare subject to Federal regulation and oversight, are required to \n\nestablish and implement AML programs.\n\n Amendments to the Definitions of Broker or Dealer in Securities. \n\nFinCEN has drafted an NPRM that proposes amendments to the regulatory \n\ndefinitions of broker or dealer in securities under the BSA \n\nregulations. The proposed changes would expand the current scope of the \n\ndefinitions to include funding portals and would require them to \n\nimplement policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve \n\ncompliance with all of the BSA requirements that are currently \n\napplicable to brokers or dealers in securities.\n\n Amendment to the Bank Secrecy Act Regulations--Registration, \n\nRecordkeeping, and Reporting of Money Services Businesses. FinCEN is \n\nconsidering issuing an NPRM to amend the requirements for money \n\nservices businesses with respect to registering with FinCEN and with \n\nrespect to the information reported during the registration process.\n\n Changes to the Travel and Recordkeeping Requirements for Funds \n\nTransfers and Transmittals of Funds. FinCEN is considering changes to \n\nrequire that more information be collected and maintained by financial \n\ninstitutions on funds transfers and transmittals of funds and to lower \n\nthe threshold to $1,000 from $3,000, which would bring the United \n\nStates into greater compliance with several criteria in the Financial \n\nAction Task Force (FATF) standards for cross-border wire transfers.\n\n Other Requirements. FinCEN also will continue to issue proposed and \n\nfinal rules pursuant to section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act, as \n\nappropriate. Finally, FinCEN expects that it may propose various \n\ntechnical and other regulatory amendments in conjunction with its \n\nongoing, comprehensive review of existing regulations to enhance \n\n\n\nregulatory efficiency, and as a result of the efforts of an interagency \n\ntask force currently focusing on improvements to the U.S. regulatory \n\nframework for anti-money laundering.\n\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency\n\n The primary mission of the Office of the Comptroller of the \n\nCurrency (OCC) is to charter, regulate, and supervise all national \n\nbanks and Federal Savings Associations (FSAs). The agency also \n\nsupervises the Federal branches and agencies of foreign banks. The \n\nOCC's goal in supervising the financial institutions subject to its \n\njurisdiction is to ensure that they operate in a safe and sound manner \n\nand in compliance with laws requiring fair treatment of their customers \n\nand fair access to credit and financial products.\n\n Significant rules issued during fiscal year 2014 include:\n\n Regulatory Capital Rules--Basel III (12 CFR parts 3, 5, 6, 165, \n\n167). The OCC and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System \n\n(FRB) issued a final rule that revises the risk-based and leverage \n\ncapital requirements for banking organizations. (The Federal Deposit \n\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC) separately issued an interim final rule \n\nthat is substantively the same as the final rule issued by the OCC and \n\nthe FRB.) The final rule consolidates three separate proposed rules \n\nthat were published jointly by the OCC, FRB and FDIC (the banking \n\nagencies) on August 30, 2012, 77 FR 52792, 52888, 52978, into one final \n\nrule. The final rule implements a revised definition of regulatory \n\ncapital, a new common equity tier 1 minimum capital requirement, a \n\nhigher minimum tier 1 capital requirement, and, for banking \n\norganizations subject to the advanced approaches risk-based capital \n\nrules, a supplementary leverage ratio that incorporates a broader set \n\nof exposures in the denominator. The final rule incorporates new \n\nrequirements into the banking agencies' prompt corrective action \n\nframework and establishes limits on a banking organization's capital \n\ndistributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking \n\norganization does not hold a specified amount of common equity tier 1 \n\ncapital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-\n\nbased capital requirements. The final rule amends the methodologies for \n\ndetermining risk-weighted assets for all banking organizations and \n\nintroduces disclosure requirements that would apply to top-tier banking \n\norganizations domiciled in the United States with $50 billion or more \n\nin total assets. The final rule also adopts changes required by the \n\n\n\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Pub. \n\nL. 111-203) (the Dodd-Frank Act) to implement more stringent capital \n\nand leverage requirements and to replace regulatory references to \n\ncredit ratings with new creditworthiness measures. The final rule was \n\npublished on October 11, 2013, 78 FR 62018.\n\n Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio (12 CFR part 3). The banking \n\nagencies issued a final rule to strengthen the leverage ratio standards \n\nfor large, interconnected U.S. banking organizations. The rule applies \n\nto any U.S. top-tier bank holding company (BHC) with at least $700 \n\nbillion in total consolidated assets or at least $10 trillion in assets \n\nunder custody (covered BHC) and any insured depository institution \n\n(IDI) subsidiary of these BHCs. In the Basel III final rule, the \n\nbanking agencies established a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of \n\n3 percent (supplementary leverage ratio), consistent with the minimum\n\n[[Page 76610]]\n\nleverage ratio adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, \n\nfor banking organizations subject to the advanced approaches risk-based \n\ncapital rules. In this final rule, the banking agencies establish a \n\n``well capitalized'' threshold of 6 percent for the supplementary \n\nleverage ratio for any IDI that is a subsidiary of a covered BHC, under \n\nthe agencies' prompt corrective action framework. The final rule was \n\nissued on May 1, 2014, 79 FR 24528.\n\n Supplementary Leverage Ratio (12 CFR part 3). The banking agencies \n\nissued a final rule to revise the denominator of the supplementary \n\nleverage ratio (total leverage exposure) that the agencies adopted in \n\nJuly 2013 as part of comprehensive revisions to the agencies' \n\nregulatory capital rules (2013 capital rule). The rule revises the \n\ntreatment of on- and off-balance sheet exposures for purposes of \n\ndetermining total leverage exposure, and more closely aligning the \n\nagencies' rules on the calculation of total leverage exposure with \n\ninternational leverage ratio standards. The proposed rule was issued on \n\nMay 1, 2014, 79 FR 24596. The final rule was issued on September 26, \n\n2014, 79 FR 57725.\n\n Integration of National Bank and Federal Savings Association \n\nRegulations: Licensing Rules (12 CFR parts 4, 5, 7, 14, 32, 34, 100, \n\n116, 143, 144, 145, 146, 150, 152, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 174, 192, \n\n\n\n193). The OCC issued a proposed rule to integrate its rules relating to \n\npolicies and procedures for corporate activities and transactions \n\ninvolving national banks and FSAs. The proposed rule also revises some \n\nof these rules in order to eliminate unnecessary requirements, \n\nconsistent with safety and soundness, and to make other technical and \n\nconforming changes. The proposal also included amendments to update OCC \n\nrules for agency organization and function. The proposed rule was \n\nissued on June 10, 2014, 79 FR 33260.\n\n Assessment of Fees (12 CFR part 8). The OCC issued a final rule to \n\nincrease assessments for national banks and FSAs with assets of more \n\nthan $40 billion. The increase ranges between 0.32 percent and \n\napproximately 14 percent, depending on the total assets of the \n\ninstitution as reflected in its June 30, 2014, Consolidated Report of \n\nCondition and Income. The average increase in assessments for affected \n\nbanks and FSAs will be 12 percent. The final rule will not increase \n\nassessments for banks or FSAs with $40 billion or less in total assets. \n\nThe OCC will implement the increase in assessments by issuing an \n\namended Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and \n\nAssessments, which will become effective as of the semiannual \n\nassessment due on September 30, 2014. In conjunction with the increase \n\nin assessments, the final rule updates the OCC's assessment rule to \n\nconform with section 318 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which reaffirmed the \n\nauthority of the Comptroller of the Currency to set the amount of, and \n\nmethodology for, assessments. The proposed rule was issued on April 28, \n\n2014, 79 FR 23297. The final rule was issued on July 9, 2014 (79 FR \n\n38769).\n\n Flood Insurance (12 CFR parts 22 and 172). The banking agencies, \n\nFarm Credit Administration (FCA), and the National Credit Union \n\nAdministration (NCUA) proposed revisions to their regulations regarding \n\nloans in areas having special flood hazards to implement provisions of \n\nthe Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (Biggert-Waters) \n\nand the OCC issued a proposed rule to integrate its flood insurance \n\nregulations for national banks, 12 CFR part 22, and FSAs, 12 CFR part \n\n172. The proposed rule was issued on October 30, 2013, 78 FR 65108.\n\n OCC Guidelines Establishing Heightened Standards for Certain Large \n\nInsured National Banks, Insured Federal Savings Associations, and \n\nInsured Federal Branches; Integration of Regulations (12 CFR part 30). \n\nThe OCC issued a final rule adopting new Guidelines as an appendix to \n\n\n\nits safety and soundness standards regulations that establish minimum \n\nstandards for the design and implementation of a risk governance \n\nframework for large insured national banks, insured FSAs, and insured \n\nFederal branches of foreign banks with average total consolidated \n\nassets of $50 billion or more and minimum standards for a board of \n\ndirectors in overseeing the framework's design and implementation. The \n\nstandards contained in the Guidelines are enforceable by the terms of a \n\nFederal statute that authorizes the OCC to prescribe operational and \n\nmanagerial standards for national banks and FSAs. The proposed rule was \n\nissued on January 27, 2014, 79 FR 4282. The final rule was issued on \n\nSeptember 11, 2014, 79 FR 54518.\n\n Appraisals for Higher-Risk Mortgages (12 CFR parts 34, 164). The \n\nbanking agencies, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), \n\nFederal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), and the NCUA, issued a final \n\nrule on February 13, 2013, 78 FR 10368, to amend Regulation Z and its \n\nofficial interpretation. The rule revised Regulation Z to implement a \n\nnew Truth in Lending Act (TILA) provision requiring appraisals for any \n\n``higher-risk mortgage'' that was added to TILA as part of the Dodd-\n\nFrank Act. For mortgages with an annual percentage rate that exceeds \n\nmarket-based prime mortgage rate benchmarks by a specified percentage, \n\nthe rule generally requires creditors to obtain an appraisal or \n\nappraisals meeting certain specified standards, provide applicants with \n\na notification regarding the use of the appraisals, and give applicants \n\na copy of the written appraisals used. The agencies issued a \n\nsupplemental rule that would exempt from the requirements of the final \n\nrule: (i) transactions secured by existing manufactured homes and not \n\nland; (ii) certain streamlined refinancings; and (iii) transactions of \n\n$25,000 or less. The supplemental final rule was issued on December 26, \n\n2013, 78 FR 78520.\n\n Appraisal Management Companies (12 CFR part 34). The banking \n\nagencies, FHFA, NCUA and CFPB, issued a proposed rule that would set \n\nminimum standards for state registration and regulation of appraisal \n\nmanagement companies. The rule would implement the minimum requirements \n\nin section 1473 of the Dodd-Frank Act to be applied by states in the \n\nregistration of appraisal management companies. It also would implement \n\nthe requirement in section 1473 of the Dodd-Frank Act for States to \n\nreport to the Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC) of the Federal Financial \n\nInstitutions Examination Council the information needed by the ASC to \n\n\n\nadminister the national registry of appraisal management companies. The \n\nproposed rule was issued on April 9, 2014, 79 FR 19521.\n\n Prohibition and Restrictions on Proprietary Trading and Certain \n\nInterests In, and Relationships with, Hedge Funds and Private Equity \n\nFunds (12 CFR part 44). The banking agencies, the Securities & Exchange \n\nCommission (SEC), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) \n\nissued final rules to implement section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, \n\nwhich contains certain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of \n\nbanking entities and nonbank financial companies supervised by the FRB \n\nto engage in proprietary trading and have certain investments in, or \n\nrelationships with, hedge funds or private equity funds. The final rule \n\nwas issued on January 31, 2014, 79 FR 5536.\n\n Treatment of Certain Collateralized Debt Obligations Backed \n\nPrimarily by Trust Preferred Securities With Regard to Prohibitions and \n\nRestrictions on Certain Interests in, and Relationships With, Hedge \n\nFunds and Private Equity Funds (12 CFR part 44). The banking agencies, \n\nthe CFTC, and the SEC issued an interim final rule that would permit\n\n[[Page 76611]]\n\nbanking entities to retain investments in certain pooled investment \n\nvehicles that invested their offering proceeds primarily in certain \n\nsecurities issued by community banking organizations of the type \n\ngrandfathered under section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The interim \n\nfinal rule was issued on January 31, 2014, 79 FR 5223.\n\n Margin and Capital Requirements for Covered Swap Entities (12 CFR \n\npart 45). The banking agencies, FCA, and the FHFA issued a proposed \n\nrule to establish minimum margin and capital requirements for \n\nregistered swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap \n\ndealers, and major security-based swap participants for which one of \n\nthe agencies is the prudential regulator. The proposed rule will \n\nimplement sections 731 and 764 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which require the \n\nagencies to adopt rules jointly to establish capital requirements and \n\ninitial and variation margin requirements for such entities on all non-\n\ncleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps in order to offset \n\nthe greater risk to such entities and the financial system arising from \n\nthe use of swaps and security-based swaps that are not cleared. The \n\nproposed rule was issued on September 24, 2014, 79 FR 57347).\n\n Liquidity Coverage Ratio (12 CFR 50). The banking agencies issued a \n\nfinal rule to implement a quantitative liquidity requirement consistent \n\n\n\nwith the liquidity coverage ratio standard established by the Basel \n\nCommittee on Banking Supervision. The requirement is designed to \n\npromote improvements in the measurement and management of liquidity \n\nrisk. The final rule applies to all internationally active banking \n\norganizations, that is, banking organizations with more than $250 \n\nbillion in total assets or more than $10 billion in on-balance sheet \n\nforeign exposure, and to consolidated subsidiary depository \n\ninstitutions of internationally active banking organizations with $10 \n\nbillion or more in total consolidated assets. The proposed rule was \n\nissued on November 29, 2013, 78 FR 71818. The final rule was issued on \n\nOctober 10, 2014, 79 FR 61439.\n\n Regulatory Publication and Review Under the Economic Growth and \n\nRegulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (12 CFR chapter I). The \n\nbanking agencies are conducting a review of the regulations they have \n\nissued to identify outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome \n\nregulations for insured depository institutions. This review is \n\nrequired by section 2222 of the Economic Growth and Regulatory \n\nPaperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (EGRPRA). The first of four Federal \n\nRegister requests for comment was issued on June 4, 2014, 79 FR 32172.\n\n Regulatory priorities for fiscal year 2015 include finalizing the \n\nproposals and interim final rules listed above as well as the following \n\nrulemakings:\n\n Flood Insurance (12 CFR parts 22 and 172). The banking agencies, \n\nFCA, and NCUA plan to issue a proposed rule to amend their regulations \n\nregarding loans in areas having special flood hazards to implement \n\ncertain provisions of the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act \n\nof 2014 (HFIAA), which amends some of the changes to the Flood Disaster \n\nProtection Act of 1973 mandated by Biggert-Waters. The proposal would \n\nestablish requirements with respect to the escrow of flood insurance \n\npayments, consistent with the changes set forth in HFIAA. The proposal \n\nalso would implement an exclusion in HFIAA for certain detached \n\nstructures from the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirement.\n\n Automated Valuation Models (Parts 34, 164). The banking agencies, \n\nNCUA, FHFA and CFPB, in consultation with the Appraisal Subcommittee \n\nand the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation, are \n\nrequired to promulgate regulations to implement quality-control \n\nstandards required for automated valuation models. Section 1473(q) of \n\nthe Dodd-Frank Act requires that automated valuation models used to \n\nestimate collateral value for mortgage lending comply with quality-\n\ncontrol standards designed to: ensure a high level of confidence in the \n\n\n\nestimates produced by automated valuation models; protect against \n\nmanipulation of data; seek to avoid conflicts of interest; require \n\nrandom sample testing and reviews and account for other factors the \n\nagencies deem appropriate. The agencies plan to issue a proposed rule \n\nto implement the requirement for quality-control standards.\n\n Incentive-Based Compensation Arrangements (12 CFR part 42). Section \n\n956 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the banking agencies, NCUA, SEC, and \n\nFHFA, to jointly prescribe regulations or guidance prohibiting any type \n\nof incentive-based payment arrangement, or any feature of any such \n\narrangement, that the regulators determine encourages inappropriate \n\nrisks by covered financial institutions by providing an executive \n\nofficer, employee, director, or principal shareholder with excessive \n\ncompensation, fees or benefits, or that could lead to material \n\nfinancial loss to the covered financial institution. The Dodd-Frank Act \n\nalso requires such agencies to jointly prescribe regulations or \n\nguidance requiring each covered financial institution to disclose to \n\nits regulator the structure of all incentive-based compensation \n\narrangements offered by such institution sufficient to determine \n\nwhether the compensation structure provides any officer, employee, \n\ndirector, or principal shareholder with excessive compensation or could \n\nlead to material financial loss to the institution. The proposed rule \n\nwas issued on April 14, 2011, 76 FR 21170. Work on a final rule is \n\nunderway.\n\n Credit Risk Retention (12 CFR part 43). The banking agencies, SEC, \n\nFHFA, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development proposed \n\nrules to implement the credit risk retention requirements of section \n\n15G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-11), as added \n\nby section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 15G generally requires \n\nthe securitizer of asset-backed securities to retain not less than 5 \n\npercent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the asset-\n\nbacked securities. Section 15G includes a variety of exemptions from \n\nthese requirements, including an exemption for asset-backed securities \n\nthat are collateralized exclusively by residential mortgages that \n\nqualify as ``qualified residential mortgages,'' as such term is defined \n\nby the agencies by rule. The proposal was issued on September 20, 2013, \n\n78 FR 57928. Work on a final rule is underway.\n\n Source of Strength (12 CFR part 47). The banking agencies plan to \n\nissue a proposed rule to implement section 616(d) of the Dodd-Frank \n\nAct. Section 616(d) requires that bank holding companies, savings and \n\n\n\nloan holding companies and companies that directly or indirectly \n\ncontrol an insured depository institution serve as a source of strength \n\nfor the insured depository institution. The appropriate Federal banking \n\nagency for the insured depository institution may require that the \n\ncompany submit a report that would assess the company's ability to \n\ncomply with the provisions of the statute and its compliance.\n\nTerrorism Risk Insurance Program Office\n\n The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) was signed into law \n\non November 26, 2002. The law, which was enacted as a consequence of \n\nthe events of September 11, 2001, established a temporary Federal \n\nreinsurance program under which the Federal Government shares the risk \n\nof losses associated with certain types of terrorist acts with \n\ncommercial property and casualty insurers. The Act, originally \n\nscheduled\n\n[[Page 76612]]\n\nto expire on December 31, 2005, was extended to December 31, 2007, by \n\nthe Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 (TRIEA). The Act has \n\nsince been extended to December 31, 2014, by the Terrorism Risk \n\nInsurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (TRIPRA). Congress is \n\ncurrently considering extending the Act for an additional period of \n\ntime.\n\n The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions is \n\nresponsible for developing and promulgating regulations implementing \n\nTRIA, as extended and amended by TRIEA and TRIPRA. The Terrorism Risk \n\nInsurance Program Office, which is part of the Office of the Assistant \n\nSecretary for Financial Institutions, is responsible for operational \n\nimplementation of TRIA. The purposes of this legislation are to address \n\nmarket disruptions, ensure the continued widespread availability and \n\naffordability of commercial property and casualty insurance for \n\nterrorism risk, and to allow for a transition period for the private \n\nmarkets to stabilize and build capacity while preserving State \n\ninsurance regulation and consumer protections.\n\n In the event Congress extends the Program Treasury will continue \n\nthe ongoing work of implementing TRIA and any changes contained in the \n\nextension of the Act.\n\nBILLING CODE 4810-25-P\n\nDEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS (VA)\n\nStatement of Regulatory Priorities\n\n The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administers benefit \n\n\n\nprograms that recognize the important public obligations to those who \n\nserved this Nation. VA's regulatory responsibility is almost solely \n\nconfined to carrying out mandates of the laws enacted by Congress \n\nrelating to programs for veterans and their families. VA's major \n\nregulatory objective is to implement these laws with fairness, justice, \n\nand efficiency.\n\n Most of the regulations issued by VA involve at least one of three \n\nVA components: The Veterans Benefits Administration, the Veterans \n\nHealth Administration, and the National Cemetery Administration. The \n\nprimary mission of the Veterans Benefits Administration is to provide \n\nhigh-quality and timely nonmedical benefits to eligible veterans and \n\ntheir dependents. The primary mission of the Veterans Health \n\nAdministration is to provide high-quality health care on a timely basis \n\nto eligible veterans through its system of medical centers, nursing \n\nhomes, domiciliaries, and outpatient medical and dental facilities. The \n\nprimary mission of the National Cemetery Administration is to bury \n\neligible veterans, members of the Reserve components, and their \n\ndependents in VA National Cemeteries and to maintain those cemeteries \n\nas national shrines in perpetuity as a final tribute of a grateful \n\nNation to commemorate their service and sacrifice to our Nation.\n\nVA Regulatory Priorities\n\n VA's regulatory priorities include a special project to undertake a \n\ncomprehensive review and improvement of its existing regulations. The \n\nfirst portion of this project is devoted to reviewing, reorganizing, \n\nand rewriting the VA's compensation and pension regulations found in 38 \n\nCFR part 3. The goal of the Regulation Rewrite Project is to improve \n\nthe clarity and consistency of these regulations to make them easier to \n\nfind, read, understand, and apply.\n\n A second VA regulatory priority is to implement title I of the \n\nVeterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014, which was \n\nsigned into law on August 7, 2014. The purpose of the new law is to \n\nestablish a program to furnish hospital care and medical services \n\nthrough non-VA health care providers to veterans who either cannot be \n\nseen within VA's wait time goals or who live far from any VA medical \n\nfacility. The statute requires that VA publish an interim final rule by \n\nNovember 5, 2014, and VA met this deadline when we published AP24, \n\nExpanded Access to Non-VA Care through the Veterans Choice Program.\n\n A third VA regulatory priority is to codify Section 707 of the Act, \n\nwhich gives the Secretary more authority to dismiss members of the \n\nSenior Executive Service based on performance or misconduct. As VA \n\nannounced on October 6, 2014, the Secretary is already implementing \n\n\n\nthat provision. To codify the new statute into the Code of Federal \n\nRegulations, VA plans to publish a rulemaking, AP30, Changes to \n\nExpedited Senior Executive Removal Authority, as an interim final rule.\n\n VA is also drafting regulation AP29 to implement Section 702 of the \n\nAct which requires that public colleges charge in-state tuition for \n\nveterans under certain circumstances.\n\nRetrospective Review of Existing Regulations\n\n Pursuant to section 6 of Executive Order 13563 ``Improving \n\nRegulation and Regulatory Review'' (Jan. 18, 2011), the following \n\nRegulatory Identifier Numbers (RINs) have been identified as associated \n\nwith retrospective review and analysis in the Department's final \n\nretrospective review of regulations plan. Some of these entries on this \n\nlist may be completed actions, which do not appear in The Regulatory \n\nPlan. However, more information can be found about these completed \n\nrulemakings in past publications of the Unified Agenda on Reginfo.gov \n\nin the Completed Actions section for that agency. These rulemakings can \n\nalso be found on Regulations.gov.

The senior executive would be allowed an opportunity for an \n\nexpedited review by\n\n[[Page 76613]]\n\nthe MSPB be conducted by an Administrative Judge at the MSPB, and if \n\nthe MSPB Administrative Judge does not conclude their review within 21 \n\ndays then the removal or demotion is final. (MSPB is conducting a \n\nrulemaking to establish and implement a process to conduct expedited \n\nreviews.)\n\n VA regulations would also state that if the senior executive is \n\nremoved, and then appeals VA's decision, the senior executive is not \n\nentitled to any type of pay, bonus, or benefit while appealing the \n\ndecision of removal. Also, VA regulations would state that if a senior \n\nexecutive is demoted, and then appeals VA's decision, the employee may \n\nonly receive any type of pay, bonus, or benefit at the rate appropriate \n\nfor the position they were demoted to, and only if the individual shows \n\nup for duty, while appealing the decision of demotion.\n\n VA regulations would also include ``misconduct'' along with ``poor \n\nperformance'' as a reason to remove or demote a senior executive.\n\n Statement of Need:\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Section 707 of the Veterans Access, Choice, \n\nand Accountability Act of 2014, which was signed into law on August 7, \n\n2014, gives the Secretary more authority to dismiss members of the \n\nSenior Executive Service based on performance or misconduct. As VA \n\nannounced on October 6, 2014, the Secretary is already implementing \n\nthat provision. To codify the new statute into the Code of Federal \n\nRegulations, VA plans to publish a rulemaking as an interim final rule.\n\n Alternatives:\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits:\n\n Risks:\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInterim Final Rule.................. 07/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n URL For More Information: www.regulations.gov.\n\n URL For Public Comments:            www.regulations.gov.\n\n Agency Contact: Kimberly McLeod, Deputy Assistant General Counsel, \n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue NW., DC 20420, \n\nPhone: 202 461-7630.\n\n RIN: 2900-AP30\n\nBILLING CODE 8320-01-P\n\nARCHITECTURAL AND TRANSPORTATION BARRIERS COMPLIANCE BOARD\n\nStatement of Regulatory and Deregulatory Priorities\n\n The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board \n\n(Access Board) is an independent federal agency established by section \n\n502 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 792). The Access Board is \n\nresponsible for developing accessibility guidelines and standards under \n\nvarious laws to ensure that individuals with disabilities have access \n\nto and use of buildings and facilities, transportation vehicles, \n\ninformation and communication technology, and medical diagnostic \n\nequipment. Other Federal agencies adopt the accessibility guidelines \n\nand standards issued by the Access Board as mandatory requirements for \n\nentities under their jurisdiction.\n\n This plan highlights five rulemaking priorities for the Access \n\nBoard in FY 2015: (A) Information and Communication Technology \n\nAccessibility Standards and Guidelines; (B) Americans with Disabilities \n\nAct (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines for Transportation Vehicles; (C) \n\nMedical Diagnostic Equipment Accessibility Standards; (D) Accessibility \n\nGuidelines for Pedestrian Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way; and \n\n(E) Americans with Disabilities (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines for \n\nPassenger Vessels. The guidelines and standards would enable \n\nindividuals with disabilities to achieve greater participation in our \n\nsociety, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency, and would \n\npromote our national values of equity, human dignity, and fairness, the \n\nbenefits of which are difficult to quantify.\n\n The rulemakings are summarized below.\n\nA. Information and Communication Technology Accessibility Standards and \n\nGuidelines (RIN: 3014-AA37)\n\n This rulemaking would update in a single document the accessibility \n\nstandards for electronic and information technology covered by section \n\n508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d) \n\n(Section 508), and the accessibility guidelines for telecommunications \n\nequipment and customer premises equipment covered by section 255 of the \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\n\n\nCommunications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 255) (Section 255). Section 508 \n\nrequires the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) and \n\neach appropriate Federal department or agency to revise their \n\nprocurement policies and directives no later than 6 months after the \n\nAccess Board's publication of standards. The FAR Council has \n\nincorporated the accessibility standards for electronic and information \n\ntechnology in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR Chapter 1). \n\nUnder Section 255, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is \n\nresponsible for issuing implementing regulations and enforcing Section \n\n255. The FCC has promulgated enforceable standards (47 CFR parts 6 and \n\n7) implementing Section 255 that are consistent with the Access Board's \n\naccessibility guidelines for telecommunications equipment and customer \n\npremises equipment.\n\n The Access Board's 2010 ANPRM included a proposal to amend Section \n\n220 of the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines \n\n(ADAAG), but, based on public comments, the ADAAG proposal is no longer \n\nincluded in this rulemaking and will be pursued separately at a later \n\ndate.\n\n A.1. Statement of Need: The Access Board issued the Electronic and \n\nInformation Technology Accessibility Standards in 2000 (65 FR 80500, \n\nDecember 21, 2000), and the Telecommunications Act Accessibility \n\nGuidelines for telecommunications equipment and customer premises \n\nequipment in 1998 (63 FR 5608, February 3, 1998). Since the standards \n\nand the guidelines were issued, technology has evolved and changed. \n\nTelecommunications products and electronic and information technology \n\nproducts have converged. For example, smartphones can perform many of \n\nthe same functions as computers. Real time text technologies and video \n\nrelay services are replacing TTY's (text telephones). The Access Board \n\nis updating the standards and guidelines together to address changes in \n\ntechnology and to make them consistent.\n\n A.2. Summary of the Legal Basis: Section 508 and Section 255 \n\nrequire the Access Board to develop accessibility standards for \n\nelectronic and information technology and accessibility guidelines for \n\ntelecommunications equipment and customer premises equipment, and to \n\nperiodically review and update the standards and guidelines to reflect \n\ntechnological advances and changes.\n\n Section 508 requires that when developing, procuring, maintaining, \n\nor using electronic and information technology, each Federal department \n\nor agency must ensure, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the \n\ndepartment or agency, that electronic and information technology \n\n(regardless of the type of medium) allows individuals with disabilities \n\nto have access to and use of information and\n\n[[Page 76614]]\n\n\n\ndata that is comparable to the access and use of the information and \n\ndata by others without disabilities. Section 255 requires \n\ntelecommunications manufacturers to ensure that telecommunications \n\nequipment and customer premises equipment are designed, developed, and \n\nfabricated to be accessible to and usable by individuals with \n\ndisabilities when it is readily achievable to do so.\n\n A.3. Alternatives: The Access Board established a \n\nTelecommunications and Electronic and Information Technology Advisory \n\nCommittee to recommend changes to the existing standards and \n\nguidelines. The advisory committee was comprised of a broad cross-\n\nsection of stakeholders, including representatives from industry, \n\ndisability groups, and government agencies from the U.S., the European \n\nCommission, Canada, Australia, and Japan. Recognizing the importance of \n\nstandardization across markets worldwide, the advisory committee \n\ncoordinated its work with standard-setting bodies in the U.S. and \n\nabroad, such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The Access Board \n\npublished Advance Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRMs) in the \n\nFederal Register in 2010 and 2011 requesting public comments on draft \n\nupdates to the standards and guidelines (75 FR 13457, March 22, 2010; \n\nand 76 FR 76640, December 8, 2011). The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n\n(NPRM) will be based on the advisory committee's report and public \n\ncomments on the ANPRMs.\n\n The Access Board expects that the Information and Communication \n\nTechnology Standards and Guidelines will have international influence, \n\nand has engaged extensive outreach efforts to standard-setting bodies \n\nin the U.S. and abroad such as the World Wide Web Consortium and to \n\nother countries, including the European Commission, Canada, Australia, \n\nand Japan.\n\n A.4. Anticipated Costs and Benefits: The Access Board is working \n\nwith a contractor to assess costs and benefits and prepare a \n\npreliminary regulatory impact assessment to accompany the NPRM. \n\nBaseline cost estimates of complying with Section 508 and Section 255 \n\nare made, and incremental costs due to the revised or new requirements \n\nare estimated for federal agencies and telecommunications equipment \n\nmanufacturers. Anticipated benefits are also numerous, including hard-\n\nto quantify benefits such as increased ability for people with \n\ndisabilities to obtain information and conduct transactions \n\nelectronically. The preliminary regulatory impact assessment will be \n\navailable at www.access-board.gov once the NPRM is published.\n\nB. Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines for \n\nTransportation Vehicles (RIN: 3014-AA38)\n\n This rulemaking would update the accessibility guidelines for \n\nhttp://www.access-board.gov/\n\n\nbuses, over-the-road buses, and vans covered by the Americans with \n\nDisabilities Act (ADA). The accessibility guidelines for other \n\ntransportation vehicles covered by the ADA, including vehicles operated \n\nin fixed guideway systems (e.g., rapid rail, light rail, commuter rail, \n\nhigh speed rail and intercity rail) would be updated in a future \n\nrulemaking. The guidelines ensure that transportation vehicles covered \n\nby the ADA are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with \n\ndisabilities. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has issued \n\nenforceable standards (49 CFR part 37) that apply to the acquisition of \n\nnew, used, and remanufactured transportation vehicles, and the \n\nremanufacture of existing transportation vehicles covered by the ADA. \n\nDOT is expected to update its standards in a separate rulemaking to be \n\nconsistent with the updated guidelines.\n\n B.1. Statement of Need: The Access Board issued the ADA \n\nAccessibility Guidelines for Transportation Vehicles in 1991, and \n\namended the guidelines in 1998 to include additional requirements for \n\nover-the-road buses. Level boarding bus systems were introduced in the \n\nU.S. after the 1991 guidelines were issued. We are revising the 1991 \n\nguidelines to include new requirements for level boarding bus systems, \n\nautomated stop and route announcements, and other changes.\n\n B.2. Summary of the Legal Basis: Title II of the ADA applies to \n\nState and local governments and Title III of the ADA applies to places \n\nof public accommodation operated by private entities. The ADA covers \n\ndesignated public transportation services provided by State and local \n\ngovernments and specified public transportation services provided by \n\nprivate entities that are primarily engaged in the business of \n\ntransporting people and whose operations affect commerce. (See 42 \n\nU.S.C. 12141 to 12147 and 12184.) Bus rapid transit systems, including \n\nlevel boarding bus systems, that provide public transportation \n\nservices, are covered by the ADA.\n\n The Access Board is required by the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \n\nto establish and maintain guidelines for the accessibility standards \n\nadopted by DOT for transportation vehicles acquired or manufactured by \n\nentities covered by the ADA. Compliance with the new guidelines is not \n\nrequired until DOT revises its accessibility standards for \n\ntransportation vehicles acquired or remanufactured by entities covered \n\nby the ADA to be consistent with the new guidelines.\n\n B.3. Alternatives: The Access Board issued a proposed rule to \n\nrevise the 1991 guidelines for buses, over-the-road buses, and vans in \n\n2010. The proposed rule, comments on the proposed rule, correspondence \n\nreceived after the close of the initial comment period, and records and \n\n\n\ntranscripts of meetings on the new ramp designs are available in the \n\nrulemaking docket at: http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=ATBCB-2010-0004. The final rule is based on \nthe NPRM \n\nand public comments on the NPRM.\n\n B.4. Anticipated Costs and Benefits: Incremental compliance costs \n\nare estimated for new requirements for over-the-road buses, such as \n\ndisplaying the International Symbol of Accessibility on the window \n\nadjacent to wheelchair spaces and displaying the destination or route \n\nsigns on the front as well as the boarding side of the vehicles. This \n\nrulemaking would enable persons who have mobility disabilities, persons \n\nwho have difficulty hearing or are deaf, and persons who have \n\ndifficulty seeing or are blind to use transportation services. A full \n\nregulatory impact analysis will be available at            www.access-board.gov, \n\nonce the final rule is published.\n\nC. Medical Diagnostic Equipment Accessibility Standards (RIN: 3014-\n\nAA40)\n\n The Access Board plans to issue a final rule establishing \n\naccessibility standards for medical diagnostic equipment used in or in \n\nconjunction with medical settings such as physicians' offices, clinics, \n\nemergency rooms, and hospitals. The standards will contain minimum \n\ntechnical criteria to ensure that medical diagnostic equipment, \n\nincluding examination tables, examination chairs, weight scales, \n\nmammography equipment, and other imaging equipment used by health care \n\nproviders for diagnostic purposes are accessible to and usable by \n\nindividuals with disabilities. The Access Board published a NPRM in the \n\nFederal Register in 2012, 77 FR 6916, February 9, 2012.\n\n C.1. Statement of Need: A national survey of a diverse sample of \n\nindividuals with a wide range of disabilities, including mobility and \n\nsensory disabilities, showed that the respondents had difficulty \n\ngetting on and off examination tables and chairs,\n\n[[Page 76615]]\n\nradiology equipment and weight scales, and experienced problems with \n\nphysical comfort, safety and communication. Focus group studies of \n\nindividuals with disabilities also provided information on barriers \n\nthat affect the accessibility and usability of various types of medical \n\ndiagnostic equipment. The national survey and focus group studies are \n\ndiscussed in the NPRM.\n\n C.2. Summary of the Legal Basis: Section 4203 of the Patient \n\nProtection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111-148, 124 Stat. 570) \n\namended Title V of the Rehabilitation Act, which establishes rights and \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=ATBCB-2010-0004\nhttp://www.access-board.gov/\n\n\nprotections for individuals with disabilities, by adding section 510 to \n\nthe Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794f) (Section 510). Section 510 \n\nrequires the Access Board, in consultation with the Commissioner of the \n\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA), to develop standards that contain \n\nminimum technical criteria to ensure that medical diagnostic equipment \n\nused in or in conjunction with medical settings such as physicians' \n\noffices, clinics, emergency rooms, and hospitals are accessible to and \n\nusable by individuals with disabilities.\n\n Section 510 does not address who is required to comply with the \n\nstandards. However, the Americans with Disabilities Act require health \n\ncare providers to provide individuals with disabilities full and equal \n\naccess to their health care services and facilities. The U.S. \n\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) is responsible for issuing regulations to \n\nimplement the Americans with Disabilities Act and enforcing the law. \n\nThe NPRM discusses DOJ activities related to health care providers and \n\nmedical diagnostic equipment.\n\n C.3. Alternatives: The Access Board worked with the FDA and DOJ in \n\ndeveloping the standards. The Access Board considered the Association \n\nfor the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation's ANSI/AAMI HE 75:2009, \n\n``Human factors engineering--Design of medical devices,'' which \n\nincludes recommended practices to provide accessibility for individuals \n\nwith disabilities. The Access Board also established a Medical \n\nDiagnostic Equipment Accessibility Standards Advisory Committee that \n\nincluded representatives from the disability community and \n\nmanufacturers of medical diagnostic equipment to make recommendations \n\non issues raised in public comments and responses to questions in the \n\nNPRM. The final rule will be based on the public comments and \n\nrecommendations of the advisory committee.\n\n C.4. Anticipated Costs and Benefits: The Access Board is working to \n\nassess costs and benefits and prepare a preliminary regulatory impact \n\nassessment to accompany the final rule. The standards would address \n\nmany of the barriers that have been identified as affecting the \n\naccessibility and usability of diagnostic equipment by individuals with \n\ndisabilities. The standards would facilitate independent transfers by \n\nindividuals with disabilities onto and off of diagnostic equipment, and \n\nenable them to maintain their independence, confidence, and dignity, \n\nlessening the need for health care personnel to assist individuals with \n\ndisabilities when transferring on and off of diagnostic equipment. The \n\nstandards would improve the quality of health care for individuals with \n\ndisabilities and ensure that they receive examinations, diagnostic \n\nprocedures, and other health care services equivalent to those received \n\n\n\nby individuals without disabilities.\n\nD. Accessibility Guidelines for Pedestrian Facilities in the Public \n\nRight-of-Way (RIN: 3014-AA26)\n\n The rulemaking would establish accessibility guidelines to ensure \n\nthat sidewalks and pedestrian facilities in the public right-of-way are \n\naccessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. A \n\nSupplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking consolidated this rulemaking \n\nwith RIN 3014-AA41; accessibility guidelines for shared use paths \n\n(which are multi-use paths designed primarily for use by bicyclists and \n\npedestrians, including persons with disabilities, for transportation \n\nand recreation purposes). The U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. \n\nDepartment of Transportation, and other Federal agencies are expected \n\nto adopt the accessibility guidelines for pedestrian facilities in the \n\npublic right-of-way and for shared use paths, as enforceable standards \n\nin separate rulemakings for the construction and alteration of \n\nfacilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act, section 504 \n\nof the Rehabilitation Act, and the Architectural Barriers Act.\n\n D.1. Statement of Need: While the Access Board has issued \n\naccessibility guidelines for the design, construction, and alteration \n\nof buildings and facilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities \n\nAct (ADA) and the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) (36 CFR part 1191), \n\nthese guidelines were developed primarily for buildings and facilities \n\non sites. Some of the provisions in these guidelines can be readily \n\napplied to pedestrian facilities in the public right-of-way such as \n\ncurb ramps. However, other provisions need to be adapted or new \n\nprovisions developed for pedestrian facilities that are built in the \n\npublic right-of-way as well as shared use paths.\n\n D.2. Summary of the Legal Basis: Section 502(b)(3) of the \n\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 792(b)(3), requires \n\nthe Access Board to establish and maintain minimum guidelines for the \n\nstandards issued by other agencies pursuant to the ADA and ABA. In \n\naddition, section 504 of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12204, required the Access \n\nBoard to issue accessibility guidelines for buildings and facilities \n\ncovered by that law.\n\n D.3. Alternatives: The Access Board established a Public Rights-of-\n\nWay Access Advisory Committee to make recommendations for the \n\nguidelines. The advisory committee was comprised of a broad cross-\n\nsection of stakeholders, including representatives for State and local \n\ngovernment agencies responsible for constructing facilities in the \n\npublic right-of-way, transportation engineers, disability groups, and \n\nbicycling and pedestrian organizations. The Access Board released two \n\n\n\ndrafts of the guidelines for public comment and an NPRM based on the \n\nadvisory committee report and public comments on the draft guidelines. \n\nThe final rule will be based on the NPRM and public comments on the \n\nNPRM.\n\n D.4. Anticipated Costs and Benefits: The Access Board identified \n\nfour provisions in the NPRM that were expected to have more than \n\nminimal monetary impacts on State and local governments. Three of these \n\nfour requirements are related to: (1) detectable warning surfaces on \n\nnewly constructed and altered curb ramps and blended transitions at \n\npedestrian street crossings; (2) accessible pedestrian signals and \n\npushbuttons when pedestrian signals are newly installed or replaced at \n\nsignalized intersections; and (3) pedestrian activated signals at \n\nroundabouts with multi-lane pedestrian crossings. In addition, the \n\nfourth requirement for provision of a two percent maximum cross slope \n\non pedestrian access routes within pedestrian street crossings with \n\nyield or stop control was estimated to have more than minimal monetary \n\nimpacts on State and local governments when constructing roadways with \n\npedestrian crossings in hilly areas. The NPRM included questions \n\nrequesting information to assess the costs and benefits of these \n\nprovisions, as well as other provisions that may have cost impacts. The \n\nAccess Board will prepare a final regulatory impact assessment to \n\naccompany the final rule based on\n\n[[Page 76616]]\n\ninformation provided in response to questions in the NPRM and other \n\nsources.\n\nE. Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines for \n\nPassenger Vessels (RIN: 3014-AA11)\n\n The rulemaking would establish accessibility guidelines to ensure \n\nthat newly constructed and altered passenger vessels covered by the \n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA) are accessible to and usable by \n\nindividuals with disabilities. The U.S. Department of Transportation \n\nand U.S. Department of Justice are expected to adopt the guidelines as \n\nenforceable standards in separate rulemakings for the construction and \n\nalteration of passenger vessels covered by the ADA.\n\n E.1. Statement of Need: Section 504 of the ADA requires the Access \n\nBoard to issue accessibility guidelines for the construction and \n\nalteration of passenger vessels covered by the law to ensure that the \n\nvessels are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with \n\ndisabilities (42 U.S.C. 12204).\n\n\n\n E.2. Summary of the Legal Basis: Title II of the ADA applies to \n\nState and local governments and title III of the ADA applies to places \n\nof public accommodation operated by private entities. The ADA covers \n\ndesignated public transportation services provided by State and local \n\ngovernments and specified public transportation services provided by \n\nprivate entities that are primarily engaged in the business of \n\ntransporting people and whose operations affect commerce. (See 42 \n\nU.S.C. 12141 to 12147 and 12184.)\n\n Titles II and III of the ADA require the DOT and DOJ to issue \n\naccessibility standards for the construction and alteration of \n\npassenger vessels covered by the law that are consistent with the \n\nguidelines issued by the Access Board. (See 42 U.S.C. 12134(c), \n\n12149(b), 12186(c).) The DOT has reserved a subpart in its ADA \n\nregulations for accessibility standards for passenger vessels in \n\nanticipation of the Access Board issuing these guidelines. (See 49 CFR \n\npart 39, subpart E.) Once DOT and DOJ issue accessibility standards for \n\nthe construction and alteration of passenger vessels covered by the \n\nADA, vessel owners and operators are then required to comply with the \n\nstandards.\n\n E.3. Alternatives: In developing the proposed accessibility \n\nguidelines, the Access Board has received and considered extensive \n\ninput from passenger vessel owners and operators, individuals with \n\ndisabilities, and other interested parties for more than a decade. The \n\nAccess Board convened an advisory committee comprised of passenger \n\nvessel industry trade groups, passenger vessel owners and operators, \n\ndisability advocacy groups, and State and local government agencies to \n\nadvise how to develop the accessibility guidelines. The committee \n\nsubmitted its report to the Access Board in 2000. In addition, over the \n\nyears, the Access Board issued an ANPRM and three versions of draft \n\naccessibility guidelines and conducted in-depth case studies on various \n\npassenger vessels. The Access Board solicited and analyzed public \n\ncomments on these documents in developing the proposed guidelines and \n\nregulatory impact analysis. All the published documents together with \n\npublic comments are available at: http://www.access-board.gov.\n\n E.4. Anticipated Costs and Benefits: The proposed guidelines would \n\naddress the discriminatory effects of architectural, transportation, \n\nand communication barriers encountered by individuals with disabilities \n\non passenger vessels. The estimated compliance costs for certain types \n\nof vessels include: (1) the incremental impact of constructing a vessel \n\nin compliance with the guidelines; and (2) any additional costs \n\nattributable to the operation and maintenance of accessible features. \n\nFor certain large cruise ships, the compliance costs would include loss \n\nhttp://www.access-board.gov/\n\n\nof guest rooms and gross revenues attributed to a proposed requirement \n\nfor a minimum number of guest rooms that provide mobility features. The \n\nproposed guidelines would significantly benefit individuals with \n\ndisabilities by affording them equal opportunity to travel on passenger \n\nvessels for employment, transportation, public accommodation, and \n\nleisure. Other benefits, which are difficult to quantify, include \n\nequity, human dignity, and fairness values.\n\nBILLING CODE 8150-01-P\n\nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA)\n\nStatement of Priorities\n\nOverview\n\n For more than 40 years, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n\n(EPA) has worked to protect people's health and the environment. By \n\ntaking advantage of the best thinking, the newest technologies and the \n\nmost cost-effective, sustainable solutions, EPA has fostered innovation \n\nand cleaned up pollution in the places where people live, work, play \n\nand learn.\n\n With a renewed focus on the challenges ahead, science, law and \n\ntransparency continue to guide EPA decisions. EPA will leverage \n\nresources with grant- and incentive-based programs, sound scientific \n\nadvice, technical and compliance assistance and tools that support \n\nstates, tribes, cities, towns, rural communities and the private sector \n\nin their efforts to address our shared challenges, including:\n\n making a visible difference in communities across the \n\ncountry;\n\n addressing climate change and improving air quality;\n\n taking action on toxics and chemical safety;\n\n protecting water: a precious, limited resource;\n\n launching a new era of state, tribal and local \n\npartnership; and\n\n working toward a sustainable future.\n\n EPA and its federal, state, local, and community partners have made \n\nenormous progress in protecting the nation's health and environment. \n\nFrom reducing mercury and other toxic air pollution to reducing \n\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, doubling the fuel efficiency of our \n\ncars and trucks, the Agency is working to save lives and protect the \n\nenvironment. In addition, while removing a billion tons of pollution \n\nfrom the air, the Agency has produced hundreds of billions of dollars \n\nin benefits for the American people.\n\nHighlights of EPA'S Regulatory Plan\n\n\n\n EPA's more than forty years of protecting human health and the \n\nenvironment demonstrates our nation's commitment to reducing pollution \n\nthat can threaten the air we breathe, the water we use and the \n\ncommunities we live in. This Regulatory Plan contains information on \n\nsome of our most important upcoming regulatory actions. As always, our \n\nSemiannual Regulatory Agenda contains information on a broader spectrum \n\nof EPA's upcoming regulatory actions.\n\nSix Guiding Priorities\n\n The EPA's success depends on supporting innovation and creativity \n\nin both what we do and how we do it. To guide the agency's efforts, the \n\nAgency has established several guiding priorities. These priorities are \n\nenumerated in the list that follows, along with recent progress and \n\nfuture objectives for each.\n\n1. Making a Visible Difference in Communities Across the Country\n\n Safe Disposal and Management of Coal Combustion Residuals. Coal \n\ncombustion residuals (CCRs), often referred to as coal ash, are \n\ncurrently considered Bevill exempt wastes under the Resource \n\nConservation and\n\n[[Page 76617]]\n\nRecovery Act (RCRA). They are residues from the combustion of coal in \n\npower plants and are captured by pollution control technologies, like \n\nscrubbers. Potential environmental concerns from coal ash management \n\ninclude groundwater contamination from leaking surface impoundments and \n\nlandfills and structural failures of surface impoundments. The need for \n\nnational criteria was emphasized by the December 2008 spill of coal ash \n\nfrom a surface impoundment at the Tennessee Valley Authority's plant in \n\nKingston, TN. The tragic spill flooded more than 300 acres of land with \n\ncoal ash, which flowed into the Emory and Clinch rivers. On June 21, \n\n2010, the EPA proposed to regulate for the first time coal ash to \n\naddress the risks from the management of these wastes that are \n\ngenerated by electric utilities and independent power producers. The \n\nAgency received over 450,000 comments on the proposal. Under a consent \n\ndecree, a final rule must be signed by the Administrator no later than \n\nDecember 19, 2014.\n\n Environmental Justice in Rulemaking. The year 2014 represents the \n\n20th anniversary of President Clinton's issuance of the Executive order \n\ndirecting all Federal agencies to engage in a Governmentwide effort and \n\nissue strategies to address environmental justice issues.\n\n EPA has made significant progress in areas critical to advancing \n\nenvironmental justice and making a visible difference in communities, \n\nincluding rulemaking, permitting, compliance and enforcement, \n\ncommunity-based programs and our work with other federal agencies. We \n\n\n\nhave developed the critical legal, science, and screening tools to help \n\nsupport our efforts in working with and in communities.\n\n2. Addressing Climate Change and Improving Air Quality\n\n The Agency will continue to deploy existing regulatory tools where \n\nappropriate and warranted. Addressing climate change calls for \n\ncoordinated national and global efforts to reduce emissions and develop \n\nnew technologies that can be deployed. Using the Clean Air Act, EPA \n\nwill continue to develop greenhouse gas standards for both mobile and \n\nstationary sources.\n\n Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards for Power Plants. As part of the \n\nPresident's Climate Action Plan, in September 2013, the EPA proposed \n\nstandards to limit carbon pollution from new power plants yet to be \n\nbuilt. This past June, we proposed carbon pollution standards for \n\nexisting power plants, the Clean Power Plan. We plan to finalize \n\nstandards for both new and existing plants in 2015. When finalized, \n\nthese standards and guidelines will establish achievable limits of \n\ncarbon pollution from future plants. By 2030 carbon emissions from \n\nexisting plants are estimated to be reduced by 30% from 2005 levels.\n\n Heavy-Duty Vehicles GHG Emission Standards. In 2011, in cooperation \n\nwith the Department of Transportation (DOT), EPA issued the first-ever \n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions Standards and Fuel Efficiency Standards for \n\nMedium- and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles for model years 2014-2018. \n\nIn 2015, EPA and DOT will propose a second set of standards to further \n\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption from a wide range \n\nof on-road vehicles from semi-trucks to the largest pickup trucks and \n\nvans and all types and sizes of work trucks and buses. This action is \n\nanother important component of the President's Climate Action Plan.\n\n Reviewing and Implementing Air Quality Standards. Despite progress, \n\nmillions of Americans still live in areas that exceed one or more of \n\nthe national air pollution standards. This year's regulatory plan \n\ndescribes efforts to review the primary National Ambient Air Quality \n\nStandards (NAAQS) for ozone and lead, as well as a rule to guide States \n\nin implementing the ozone, particulate matter, and other air quality \n\nstandards.\n\n Cleaner Air from Improved Technology. EPA continues to address \n\nhazardous air pollution under authority of the Clean Air Act Amendments \n\nof 1990. The centerpiece of this effort is the ``Maximum Achievable \n\nControl Technology'' (MACT) program, which requires that all major \n\nsources of a given type use emission controls that better reflect the \n\ncurrent state of the art. In May of 2015, EPA expects to complete a \n\nreview of existing MACT standards for Petroleum Refineries to reduce \n\nresidual risk and assure that the standards reflect current technology.\n\n3. Taking Action on Toxics and Chemical Safety\n\n\n\n One of EPA's highest priorities is to make significant progress in \n\nassuring the safety of chemicals. Using sound science as a compass, EPA \n\nprotects individuals, families, and the environment from potential \n\nrisks of pesticides and other chemicals. In its implementation of these \n\nprograms, EPA uses several different statutory authorities, including \n\nthe Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), the \n\nFederal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), the Toxic Substances \n\nControl Act (TSCA) and the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA), as well as \n\ncollaborative and voluntary activities. In FY 2014, the Agency will \n\ncontinue to satisfy its overall directives under these authorities and \n\nhighlights the following actions in this Regulatory Plan:\n\n EPA's Existing Chemicals Management Program Under TSCA. As part of \n\nEPA's ongoing efforts to ensure the safety of chemicals, EPA plans to \n\ntake a range of identified regulatory actions for certain chemicals and \n\nassess other chemicals to determine if risk reduction action is needed \n\nto address potential concerns.\n\n Addressing Formaldehyde Used in Composite Wood Products. As \n\ndirected by the Formaldehyde Standards for Composite Wood Products Act \n\nof 2010, EPA is developing final regulations to address formaldehyde \n\nemissions from hardwood plywood, particleboard and medium-density \n\nfiberboard that is sold, supplied, offered for sale, or manufactured in \n\nthe United States.\n\n Lead in Public and Commercial Buildings. As directed by TSCA \n\nsection 402(c)(3), EPA is developing a proposed rule to address \n\nrenovation or remodeling activities that create lead-based paint \n\nhazards in pre-1978 public buildings and commercial buildings. EPA \n\npreviously issued a final rule to address lead-based paint hazards \n\ncreated by these activities in target housing and child-occupied \n\nfacilities.\n\n Reassessment of PCB Use Authorizations. When enacted in 1978, TSCA \n\nbanned the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, and use \n\nof polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), except when uses would pose no \n\nunreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. EPA is \n\nreassessing certain ongoing, authorized uses of PCBs that were \n\nestablished by regulation in 1979, including the use, distribution in \n\ncommerce, marking and storage for reuse of liquid PCBs in electric \n\nequipment, to determine whether those authorized uses still meet TSCA's \n\n``no unreasonable risk'' standard. EPA plans to propose the revocation \n\nor revision of any PCBs use authorizations included in this \n\nreassessment that no longer meet the TSCA standard.\n\n Enhancing Agricultural Worker Protection. Based on years of \n\nextensive stakeholder engagement and public meetings, EPA is acting to \n\n\n\nenhance the pesticide worker safety program. EPA plans to issue final \n\namendments to the agricultural worker protection regulation that \n\nstrengthens protections for agricultural farm workers and\n\n[[Page 76618]]\n\npesticide handlers. The rule is expected improve pesticide safety \n\ntraining and agricultural workers' ability to protect themselves and \n\ntheir families from potential secondary exposure to pesticides and \n\npesticide residues. The proposed revisions will address key \n\nenvironmental justice concerns for a population that may be \n\ndisproportionately affected by pesticide exposure. Other changes under \n\ndevelopment are intended to bring hazard communication requirements \n\nmore in line with Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n\nrequirements and seek to clarify current requirements to facilitate \n\nprogram implementation and enforcement.\n\n Strengthening Pesticide Applicator Safety. As part of EPA's effort \n\nto enhance the pesticide worker safety program, the Agency is also \n\ndeveloping a proposal to revise the existing regulation concerning the \n\ncertification of applicators of restricted-use pesticides to ensure \n\nthat the federal certification program standards adequately protect \n\napplicators, the public and the environment from potential risks \n\nassociated with use of restricted use pesticides. The proposed changes \n\nare intended to improve the competency of certified applicators of \n\nrestricted use pesticides, increase protection for noncertified \n\napplicators of restricted use pesticides operating under the direct \n\nsupervision of a certified applicator through enhanced pesticide safety \n\ntraining and standards for supervision of noncertified applicators, and \n\nestablish a minimum age requirement for such noncertified applicators. \n\nAlso, in keeping with EPA's commitment to work more closely with tribal \n\ngovernments to strengthen environmental protection in Indian Country, \n\ncertain changes are intended to provide more practical options for \n\nestablishing certification programs in Indian Country.\n\n Improving Chemical Facility Safety and Security. Executive Order \n\n13650 on Improving Chemical Facility Safety and Security directs \n\nfederal agencies to work with stakeholders to improve chemical safety \n\nand security through agency programs, private sector initiatives, \n\nfederal guidance, standards, and regulations. During the course of \n\nimplementing this Executive order, EPA, along with the Department of \n\nHomeland Security (including the National Protection and Programs \n\nDirectorate, the Transportation Security Agency and the United States \n\nCoast Guard); the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; the \n\nUnited States Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and \n\nFirearms; the United States Department of Agriculture; and the United \n\n\n\nStates Department of Transportation, will assess whether its \n\nregulations should be modified or new regulations developed to improve \n\nupon chemical safety and security. EPA issued in July 2014 a request \n\nfor information on how to strengthen its Risk Management Plan program. \n\nEPA plans to develop a proposed rule to modernize the Risk Management \n\nPlan.\n\n4. Protecting Water: A Precious, Limited Resource\n\n Despite considerable progress, America's waters remain imperiled. \n\nWater quality protection programs face complex challenges, from \n\nnutrient loadings and stormwater runoff to invasive species and \n\ndrinking water contaminants. These challenges demand both traditional \n\nand innovative strategies.\n\n Improving Water Quality. EPA plans to address challenging water \n\nquality issues in several rulemakings during FY 2015.\n\n Definition of ``Waters of the United States'' Under the Clean Water \n\nAct. After U.S. Supreme Court decisions in SWANCC and Rapanos, the \n\nscope of ``waters of the US'' protected under Clean Water Act (CWA) \n\nprograms has been an issue of considerable debate and uncertainty. The \n\nAct does not distinguish among programs as to what constitutes ``waters \n\nof the United States.'' As a result, these decisions affect the \n\ngeographic scope of all CWA programs. SWANCC and Rapanos did not \n\ninvalidate the current regulatory definition of ``waters of the United \n\nStates.'' However, the decisions established important considerations \n\nfor how those regulations should be interpreted. Experience \n\nimplementing the regulations following the two court cases has \n\nidentified several areas that could benefit from additional \n\nclarification through rulemaking.\n\n Steam Electric Power Plants. Steam electric power plants contribute \n\nover half of all toxic pollutants discharged to surface waters by all \n\nindustrial categories currently regulated in the United States under \n\nthe Clean Water Act. Discharges of these toxic pollutants are linked to \n\ncancer and neurological damage in humans and ecological damage. EPA \n\nwill establish national technology-based regulations called effluent \n\nguidelines to reduce discharges of these pollutants from industries to \n\nwaters of the U.S. and publicly owned treatment works. These guidelines \n\nwould set the first Federal limits on the levels of toxic metals in \n\nwastewater that can be discharged from power plants, based on \n\ntechnology improvements in the industry over the last three decades. \n\nThe steam electric effluent guidelines apply to steam electric power \n\nplants using nuclear or fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural \n\ngas.\n\n Water Quality Standards Regulatory Revisions. EPA will finalize \n\n\n\nupdates to the Water Quality Standards regulation, which provides a \n\nstrong foundation for water quality-based controls, including water \n\nquality assessments, impaired waters lists, total maximum daily loads, \n\nand water quality-based effluent limits (WQBELs) in NPDES discharge \n\npermits. These updates aim to clarify and resolve a number of policy \n\nand technical issues that have recurred over the past 30 years. They \n\nwill assure greater public transparency, better stakeholder \n\ninformation, and more effective implementation of the Water Quality \n\nStandards program.\n\n Responding to Oil Spills in U.S. Waters. The Clean Water Act (CWA), \n\nas amended by the Oil Pollution Act (OPA), requires that the National \n\nContingency Plan (NCP) include a schedule identifying ``dispersants, \n\nother chemicals, and other spill mitigating devices and substances, if \n\nany, that may be used in carrying out'' the NCP. EPA is considering \n\namending subpart J of the NCP (the Product Schedule) for a manufacturer \n\nto have chemical, biological, or other spill-mitigating substances \n\nlisted on the Product Schedule, updating the listing requirements to \n\nreflect new advancements in scientific understanding, and, to the \n\nextent practicable, considering and addressing concerns regarding the \n\nuse of dispersants raised during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.\n\n5. Launching a New Era of State, Tribal and Local Partnership\n\n EPA's success depends more than ever on working with increasingly \n\ncapable and environmentally conscious partners. States have \n\ndemonstrated leadership on managing environmental challenges, and EPA \n\nwants to build on and complement their work. EPA supports state and \n\ntribal capacity to ensure that programs are consistently delivered \n\nnationwide. This provides EPA and its intergovernmental partners with \n\nan opportunity to further strengthen their working relationship and, \n\nthereby, more effectively pursue their shared goal of national \n\nenvironmental and public health protection. The history and future of \n\nenvironmental protection will be built on this type of collaboration.\n\n In July 2014, EPA's Administrator Gina McCarthy signed the\n\n[[Page 76619]]\n\nEnvironmental Justice Policy for Working with Tribes and Indigenous \n\nPeoples, reinforcing the agency's commitment to work with tribes on a \n\ngovernment-to-government basis when issues of environmental justice \n\narise. This policy allows EPA to reinforce its commitment to tribal \n\ncommunities, especially in addressing issues of environmental justice. \n\nThe policy integrates 17 environmental justice and civil rights \n\nprinciples and identifies existing informational and resource tools to \n\nsupport EPA in addressing environmental justice concerns raised by \n\nFederally Recognized Tribes and Indigenous Peoples throughout the \n\n\n\nUnited States.\n\n In addition, 2014 marks 30 years of EPA's 1984 Indian Policy. EPA \n\nwas the first to formally adopt such a Policy, reiterating the \n\nimportance of EPA's tribal programs and our unique government-to-\n\ngovernment relationship with tribes.\n\n6. Working Toward a Sustainable Future\n\n Just as today's economy is vastly different from that of 40 years \n\nbefore, EPA's regulatory program is evolving to recognize the progress \n\nthat has already been made in environmental protection and to \n\nincorporate new technologies and approaches that allow us to provide \n\nfor an environmentally sustainable future more efficiently and \n\neffectively.\n\n Establishing User Fees for the Use of RCRA Manifests. The e-\n\nManifest Final rule of February 7, 2014 codified certain provisions of \n\nthe ``Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest Establishment Act'' (or the \n\nAct), which directed EPA to adopt a regulation that authorized the use \n\nof electronic manifests to track hazardous waste shipments nationwide. \n\nThe Act also instructed EPA to develop a user-fee-funded e-Manifest \n\nsystem. Since the Act grants broad discretion to EPA to determine the \n\nfees and gives the Agency authority to collect such fees for both \n\nelectronic manifests and any paper manifests that continue in use, EPA \n\nplans to issue rulemaking to establish the appropriate electronic and \n\npaper manifest fees. The initial fees established in the final rule are \n\nexpected to cover the operation and maintenance costs for the system, \n\nas well as the costs associated with the development of the system. EPA \n\nplans to also announce in the final rule the date on which the system \n\nwill be implemented and available to users. Once the national e-\n\nManifest system becomes available, hazardous waste handlers will be \n\nable to complete, sign, transmit, and store electronic manifests \n\nthrough the national IT system, or they can elect to continue tracking \n\nthe hazardous waste under the paper manifest system. Further, waste \n\nhandlers that currently submit manifests to the States will no longer \n\nbe required to do so, unless required by the State, as EPA will collect \n\nboth the remaining paper manifest copies and electronic manifests in \n\nthe national system and will disseminate the manifest data to those \n\nStates that want it.\n\n Strengthening the Underground Storage Tanks Program. EPA plans to \n\nrevise the 1988 federal underground storage tank (UST) regulations by \n\nincreasing emphasis on properly operating and maintaining UST \n\nequipment. These revisions will help improve prevention and detection \n\n\n\nof UST releases, which are one of the leading sources of groundwater \n\ncontamination. The revisions will also help ensure all USTs in the \n\nUnited States, including those in Indian country, meet the same minimum \n\nstandards.\n\nRetrospective Review of Existing Regulations\n\n Pursuant to section 6 of Executive Order 13563 ``Improving \n\nRegulation and Regulatory Review'' (Jan. 18, 2011), the following \n\nRegulatory Identifier Numbers (RINs) have been identified as associated \n\nwith retrospective review and analysis in the Agency's final \n\nretrospective review of regulations plan. Some of these entries on this \n\nlist may be completed actions, which do not appear in The Regulatory \n\nPlan. However, more information can be found about these completed \n\nrulemakings in past publications of the Unified Agenda on Reginfo.gov \n\nin the Completed Actions section for that agency. These rulemakings can \n\nalso be found on Regulations.gov.

To this end, the Agency is committed to identifying \n\nareas in its regulatory program where significant savings or \n\nquantifiable reductions in paperwork burdens might be achieved, as \n\noutlined in Executive Order 13610, while protecting public health and \n\nour environment.\n\nRules Expected to Affect Small Entities\n\n By better coordinating small business activities, EPA aims to \n\nimprove its technical assistance and outreach efforts, minimize burdens \n\nto small businesses in its regulations, and simplify small businesses' \n\nparticipation in its voluntary programs. Actions that may affect small \n\nentities can be tracked on EPA's Regulatory Development and \n\nRetrospective Review Tracker (http://www.epa.gov/regdarrt/) at any \n\ntime.

Final, Judicial, October 1, 2015, Court-ordered Deadline. \n\nMust be proposed by December 1\n\n Abstract: Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA is required to review \n\nand, if appropriate, revise the air quality criteria for the primary \n\n(health-based) and secondary (welfare-based) national ambient air \n\nquality standards (NAAQS) every 5 years. On March 23, 2008, the EPA \n\npublished a final rule to revise the primary and secondary NAAQS for \n\nozone to provide increased protection of public health and welfare. \n\nWith regard to the primary standard for ozone, the EPA revised the \n\nlevel of the 8-hour ozone standard to 0.075 ppm. With regard to the \n\nsecondary ozone standard, the EPA made it identical in all respects to \n\nthe primary ozone standard, as revised. The DC Circuit upheld the \n\n\n\nprimary standard, but remanded the secondary standard back to the EPA. \n\nThe EPA initiated the current review in October 2008 with a workshop to \n\ndiscuss key policy-relevant issues around which EPA would structure the \n\nreview. This review included the preparation of an Integrated Science \n\nAssessment, Risk/Exposure Assessment, and a Policy Assessment Document \n\nby the EPA, with opportunities for review by EPA's Clean Air Scientific \n\nAdvisory Committee and the public.\n\n Statement of Need: Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, EPA \n\nis required to review and if appropriate revise the air quality \n\ncriteria for the primary (health-based) and secondary (welfare-based) \n\nnational ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) every 5 years.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Review of the NAAQS is authorized by Clean \n\nAir Act Sections 108 and 109.\n\n Alternatives: The main alternative for the Administrator's decision \n\non the review of the primary and secondary national ambient air quality \n\nstandards for ozone is whether to retain or revise the existing \n\nstandards.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The Clean Air Act makes clear that \n\nthe economic and technical feasibility of attaining standards are not \n\nto be considered in setting or revising the NAAQS, although such \n\nfactors may be considered in the development of State plans to \n\nimplement the standards. Accordingly, when the Agency proposes \n\nrevisions to the standards, the Agency prepares cost and benefit \n\ninformation in order to provide States information that may be useful \n\nin considering different implementation strategies for meeting proposed \n\nor final standards. In those instances, cost and benefit information is \n\ngenerally included in the regulatory analysis accompanying the final \n\nrule.\n\n Risks: Health and welfare risks associated with exposure to O3 in \n\nthe ambient air have been assessed. The final health and welfare Risk \n\nand Exposure Assessments for Ozone were released in August 2014, and \n\nare available at: http://www.epa.gov/ttn/naaqs/standards/ozone/data/20140829healthrea.pdf.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotice.............................. 04/28/11 76 FR 23755\n\nNPRM................................ 12/00/14 .......................\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 11/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttp://www.epa.gov/ttn/naaqs/standards/ozone/data/20140829healthrea.pdf\n\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, Local, State, Tribal.\n\n Additional Information: Docket #: EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0699.\n\n URL For More Information: http://www.epa.gov/ozone/.\n\n Agency Contact: Susan Stone, Environmental Protection Agency, Air\n\n[[Page 76621]]\n\nand Radiation, C504-06, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, Phone: 919 \n\n541-1146, Fax: 919 541-0237, Email: stone.susan@epa.gov\n\n Karen Wesson, Environmental Protection Agency, Air and Radiation, \n\nC504-06, RTP, NC 27711, Phone: 919 541-3515, Email: \n\nwesson.karen@epa.gov\n\n RIN: 2060-AP38\n\nEPA--AR\n\n123.

The agency is using its authority under section 111(d) of the \n\nClean Air Act (CAA) to issue emission guidelines to address GHG \n\nemissions from existing power plants. The Presidential Memorandum \n\ndirects the EPA to issue proposed GHG guidelines for existing power \n\nplants by no later than June 1, 2014, and issue final guidelines by no \n\nlater than June 1, 2015. In addition, the Presidential Memorandum \n\ndirects the EPA to, in the guidelines, require states to submit to EPA \n\nthe implementation plans required under section 111(d) of the CAA by no \n\nlater than June 30, 2016. On June 18, 2014, the EPA proposed emission \n\nguidelines for states to follow in developing plans to address GHG \n\nemissions from existing fossil fired EGU, using its authority under CAA \n\n111(d). This action is a supplemental proposal and will propose \n\nemission guidelines to address GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-\n\nfired EGUs on tribal lands and in U.S. territories.\n\n Statement of Need: President Obama's Climate Action Plan called for \n\nEPA to complete carbon pollution standards for existing fossil fuel-\n\nhttp://www.epa.gov/ttn/naaqs/standards/pb/s_pb_index.html\nmailto:murphy.deirdre@epa.gov\nmailto:tennant.ginger@epa.gov\n\n\nfired power plants by June 1, 2015.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium-\n\nand Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles--Phase 2\n\n Priority: Economically Significant. Major under 5 U.S.C. 801.\n\n Legal Authority: Clean Air Act sec 202(a)\n\n CFR Citation: 40 CFR 1036; 40 CFR 1037; 40 CFR 86.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: During the President's second term, EPA and the \n\nDepartment of Transportation, in close coordination with the California \n\nAir Resources Board, will develop a comprehensive National Program for \n\nMedium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emission and Fuel \n\nEfficiency Standards for model years beyond 2018. These second sets of \n\nstandards would further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fuel \n\nconsumption from a wide range of on-road vehicles from semi-trucks to \n\nthe largest pickup trucks and vans, and all types and sizes of work \n\ntrucks and buses. This action will be in continued response to the \n\nPresident's directive to take coordinated steps to produce a new \n\ngeneration of clean vehicles. This action follows the first ever \n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions Standards and Fuel Efficiency Standards for \n\nMedium- and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles (75 FR September 15, 2011).\n\n Statement of Need: Under Clean Air Act authority, EPA has \n\ndetermined that emissions of greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles \n\nand engines cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be \n\nanticipated to endanger public health and welfare. Therefore, there is \n\na need to reduce GHG emissions from medium- and heavy-duty vehicles to \n\nprotect public health and welfare. The medium- and heavy-duty truck \n\nsector accounts for approximately 18 percent of the U.S. mobile source \n\nGHG emissions and is the second largest mobile source sector. GHG \n\nemissions from this sector are forecast to continue increasing rapidly; \n\nreflecting the anticipated impact of factors such as economic growth \n\nand increased movement of freight by trucks. This rulemaking would \n\nsignificantly reduce GHG emissions from future medium- and heavy-duty \n\nvehicles by setting GHG standards that will lead to the introduction of \n\nGHG reducing vehicle and engine technologies.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The Clean Air Act section 202(a)(1) states \n\nmailto:king.melanie@epamail.epa.gov\nmailto:Wayland.RobertJ@epamail.epa.gov\n\n\nthat The Administrator shall by regulation prescribe (and from time to \n\ntime revise) in accordance with the provisions of this section, \n\nstandards applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any \n\nclass or classes of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines, \n\nwhich in his judgment cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may \n\nreasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. Section \n\n202(a) covers all on-highway vehicles including medium- and heavy-duty \n\ntrucks. In April 2007, the Supreme Court found in Massachusetts v. EPA \n\nthat greenhouse gases fit well within the Acts definition of air \n\npollutant and that EPA has statutory authority to regulate emission of \n\nsuch gases from new motor vehicles. Lastly, in April 2009, EPA issued \n\nthe Proposed Endangerment and Cause-or-Contribute Findings for \n\nGreenhouse Gases under the Clean Air Act. The endangerment proposal \n\nstated that greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and engines cause \n\nor contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to \n\nendanger public health and welfare.\n\n Alternatives: The rulemaking proposal will include an evaluation of \n\nregulatory alternatives. In addition, the proposal is expected to \n\ninclude tools such as averaging, banking, and trading of emissions \n\ncredits as an alternative approach for compliance with the proposed \n\nprogram.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Detailed analysis of economy-wide \n\ncost impacts, greenhouse gas emission reductions, and societal benefits \n\nwill be performed during development of the proposed rule.\n\n Risks: The failure to set new GHG standards for medium- and heavy-\n\nduty trucks is likely to result in cumulative increases in GHG \n\nemissions from the trucking industry over time and therefore increased \n\nthe risk of unacceptable climate change impacts.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 03/00/15 .......................\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 02/00/16 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, State.\n\n Agency Contact: Matt Spears, Environmental Protection Agency, Air \n\nand Radiation, Mail Code: ASD1, Ann Arbor, MI 48105, Phone: 734 214-\n\n\n\n4921, Fax: 734 214-4816, Email: spears.mattew@epa.gov\n\n Charles Moulis, Environmental Protection Agency, Air and Radiation, \n\nNFEVL, Ann Arbor, MI 48105, Phone: 734 214-4826.\n\n RIN: 2060-AS16\n\n[[Page 76623]]\n\nEPA--AR\n\n126. Renewable Fuel 2015 Volume Standards\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: Clean Air Act sec 211(o)\n\n CFR Citation: 40 CFR 80.1401.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: In response to the Energy Independence and Security Act \n\n(EISA) which amended the Clean Air Act Section 211(o), EPA finalized \n\nthe RFS2 Program regulations. The new provisions also require EPA to \n\npromulgate regulations that specify the annual statutory volume \n\nrequirements for renewable fuels, including cellulosic, biofuel, bio-\n\nmass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel that must \n\nbe used in transportation fuel annually. In the case of the cellulosic \n\nbiofuel standard, the act specifically requires that the standard be \n\nset based on the volume projected to be available during the following \n\nyear. If the volumes are lower than those specified under the act, then \n\nEPA may also lower the advanced biofuel and total renewable fuel \n\nstandards each year accordingly. Further, the act requires the \n\nAdministrator to promulgate rules establishing the applicable volumes \n\nof biomass-based diesel for 2013 and beyond and to do so no later than \n\n14 months before the year for which such applicable volume would apply. \n\nThe actions summarized here will propose and finalize the 2016 biomass \n\nbased diesel (BBD) volume along with the 2015 standards. This \n\nregulatory action will establish, as required, the annual statutory \n\nvolume requirements for the RFS2 fuel categories (cellulosic, biomass-\n\nbased diesel, advanced biofuel, and renewable fuel) that apply to all \n\ngasoline and diesel produced or imported in 2015 and set, at minimum, \n\nthe 2016 requirement. Entities potentially affected by this rule are \n\nthose involved with the production, distribution, and sale of \n\ntransportation fuels, including gasoline and diesel fuel or renewable \n\nfuels such as ethanol and biodiesel.\n\n Statement of Need: EPA is developing this rule under the \n\nCongressional mandate in the Energy Independence and Security Act \n\n(EISA) of 2007.\n\nmailto:spears.mattew@epa.gov\n\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: EPA is developing this rule under Clean Air \n\nAct Section 211(o).\n\n Alternatives: Alternatives are being developed as part of the \n\nforthcoming proposal.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Cost and benefit information is \n\nbeing developed as part of the forthcoming proposal.\n\n Risks: The risks are those addressed by EISA--i.e., energy \n\ninsecurity and dependence on foreign sources.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 05/00/15\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 08/00/15\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n Energy Effects: Statement of Energy Effects planned as required by \n\nExecutive Order 13211.\n\n International Impacts: This regulatory action will be likely to \n\nhave international trade and investment effects, or otherwise be of \n\ninternational interest.\n\n Sectors Affected: 325199 All Other Basic Organic Chemical \n\nManufacturing; 325193 Ethyl Alcohol Manufacturing; 424690 Other \n\nChemical and Allied Products Merchant Wholesalers; 454319 Other Fuel \n\nDealers; 424710 Petroleum Bulk Stations and Terminals; 324110 Petroleum \n\nRefineries; 424720 Petroleum and Petroleum Products Merchant \n\nWholesalers (except Bulk Stations and Terminals)\n\n URL for More Information: http://www.epa.gov/otaq/fuels/renewablefuels/.\n\n Agency Contact: David Korotney, Environmental Protection Agency, \n\nAir and Radiation, N27, Ann Arbor, MI 48105, Phone: 734 214-4507, \n\nEmail: korotney.david@epa.gov\n\n Paul Argyropoulos, Environmental Protection Agency, Air and \n\nRadiation, 6401A, Washington, DC 20460, Phone: 202 564-1123, Email: \n\nargyropoulos.paul@epa.gov\n\n RIN: 2060-AS22\n\nEPA--OFFICE OF CHEMICAL SAFETY AND POLLUTION PREVENTION (OCSPP)\n\nProposed Rule Stage\n\nhttp://www.epa.gov/otaq/fuels/renewablefuels/\nmailto:korotney.david@epa.gov\nmailto:argyropoulos.paul@epa.gov\n\n\n127. Pesticides; Certification of Pesticide Applicators\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 7 U.S.C. 136 7 U.S.C. 136i 7 U.S.C. 136w.\n\n CFR Citation: 40 CFR 156; 40 CFR 171.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: EPA is developing a proposed rule to revise the federal \n\nregulations governing the certified pesticide applicator program, based \n\non years of extensive stakeholder engagement and public meetings, to \n\nensure that they adequately protect applicators, the public, and the \n\nenvironment from potential harm due to exposure to restricted use \n\npesticides (RUPs). This action is intended to improve the training and \n\nawareness of certified applicators of RUPs and to increase protection \n\nfor noncertified applicators of RUPs operating under the direct \n\nsupervision of a certified applicator through enhanced pesticide safety \n\ntraining and standards for supervision of noncertified applicators.\n\n Statement of Need: Change is needed to strengthen the protections \n\nfor pesticide applicators, the public, and the environment from harm \n\ndue to pesticide exposure.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: This action is issued under the authority \n\nof the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as \n\namended, 7 U.S.C.s 136-136y, particularly sections 136a(d), 136i, and \n\n136w.\n\n Alternatives: In the years prior to the development of this \n\nrulemaking, EPA pursued non-regulatory approaches to protect \n\napplicators, the public, and the environment from potential harm due to \n\nexposure to RUPs. For example, the Agency developed mechanisms to \n\nimprove applicator trainers and make training materials more \n\naccessible. EPA has also developed nationally relevant training and \n\ncertification materials to preserve state resources while improving \n\ncompetency. However, the non-regulatory approaches did not address \n\nother requisite needs for improving protections, such as the \n\nrequirements for determining competency and recertification that are \n\nbeing considered in this rulemaking.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Although subject to change as the \n\nproposal is developed, EPA currently estimates incremental costs of \n\nabout $44 million annually and unquantified, long term health benefits \n\nto certified applicators, the noncertified applicators they supervise, \n\nand their families. These benefits arise from reducing their daily risk \n\nof pesticide exposures and reduced risk of chronic illness.

The EPA has initiated rulemaking to reassess the \n\nongoing authorized uses of PCBs to determine whether certain use \n\nauthorizations should be ended or phased out because they can no longer \n\nbe justified under section 6(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act, \n\nwhich requires that the authorized use will not present an unreasonable \n\nrisk of injury to health and the environment. As the first step in this \n\nreassessment, the EPA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed \n\nRulemaking (ANPRM) on April 7, 2010 and took comment through August 20, \n\n2010. The EPA reviewed and considered all comments received on the \n\nANPRM in planning the current rulemaking. This action will address the \n\nfollowing specific areas: (1) The use, distribution in commerce, \n\nmarking and storage for reuse of liquid PCBs in electric equipment; (2) \n\nimprovements to the existing use authorization for natural gas \n\npipelines; and (3) definitional and other regulatory ``fixes''. The \n\nreassessment of use authorizations related to liquid PCBs in equipment \n\nwill focus on small capacitors in fluorescent light ballasts, large \n\ncapacitors, transformers and other electrical equipment. In addition, \n\nrevised testing, characterization, and reporting requirements for PCBs \n\nin natural gas pipeline systems to provide more transparency for the \n\nAgency and the public when PCB releases occur will be considered. \n\nConsistent with Executive Order 13563, ``Improving Regulation and \n\nRegulatory Review'', wherever possible and consistent with the overall \n\nobjectives of this rulemaking, the Agency will also eliminate or fix \n\nregulatory inefficiencies noted by the Agency or in public comments on \n\nthe ANPRM.\n\n Statement of Need: EPA is reassessing authorized uses of PCBs to \n\ndetermine whether certain uses should be ended or phased out because \n\nthey can no longer be justified under section 6(e) of the Toxic \n\nSubstances Control Act, which requires that the authorized use will not \n\npresent an unreasonable risk of injury to health and the environment. A \n\nrulemaking is needed to revise or revoke any PCB use authorizations \n\nthat no longer meet the TSCA unreasonable risk standard.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The authority for this action comes from \n\nTSCA section 6(e)(2)(B) and (C) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 605(e)(2)(B) and \n\n(C)), as well as TSCA section 6(e)(1)(B) (15 U.S.C. 2605(e)(1)(B)).\n\n Alternatives: EPA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed \n\nRulemaking (ANPRM) on April 7, 2010 and took comment through August 20, \n\n2010. EPA reviewed and considered all comments received on the ANPRM in \n\nplanning the current rulemaking. If EPA determines that certain \n\nauthorized uses of PCBs can no longer be justified under TSCA section \n\n6(e), EPA will evaluate options for ending or phasing out those uses.\n\n\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: In developing a proposed rule, EPA \n\nwill also evaluate the costs and benefits of the options under \n\nconsideration, which will be used to inform the decision-makers of the \n\npotential impacts. Once decisions regarding the proposed rule are made, \n\ninformation on the potential costs and benefits of the action will be \n\navailable.\n\n Risks: PCBs are toxic, persist in the environment and bioaccumulate \n\nin food chains and, thus, pose risks to human health and ecosystems. \n\nOnce in the environment, PCBs do not readily break down and therefore \n\nmay remain for long periods of time cycling between air, water, and \n\nsoil. PCBs can be carried long distances and have been found in snow \n\nand sea water in areas far away from where they were released into the \n\nenvironment. As a consequence, PCBs are found all over the world. In \n\ngeneral, the lighter the form of PCB, the further it can be transported \n\nfrom the source of contamination. PCBs can accumulate in the leaves and \n\nabove-ground parts of plants and food crops. They are also taken up \n\ninto the bodies of small organisms and fish. Humans may be exposed to \n\nPCBs through diet by eating contaminated fish and shellfish, and \n\nconsuming contaminated milk, meat, and their by-products. Infants may \n\nbe exposed through breast milk, and unborn children may exposed while \n\nin the womb. In addition, humans may exposed by breathing contaminated \n\nindoor air in buildings where electrical equipment contains PCBs or by \n\ncoming into contact with PCB-contaminated liquids that have leaked from \n\nelectrical equipment. Health effects associated with exposure to PCBs \n\nin humans and/or animals include liver, thyroid, dermal and ocular \n\nchanges, immunological alterations, neurodevelopmental changes, reduced \n\nbirth weight, reproductive toxicity, and cancer. EPA is currently \n\nevaluating the possible risks presented by ongoing uses of PCBs that \n\nmay be addressed by this action.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nANPRM............................... 04/07/10 75 FR 17645\n\nANPRM Comment Period Extended....... 06/16/10 75 FR 34076\n\nNPRM................................ 07/00/15\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Undetermined.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Local, State, Tribal.\n\n Federalism: This action may have federalism implications as defined \n\nin EO 13132.\n\n Additional Information: Docket #: EPA-HQ-OPPT-2009-0757.\n\n\n\n[[Page 76625]]\n\n Sectors Affected: 22 Utilities; 31-33 Manufacturing; 48-49 \n\nTransportation and Warehousing; 53 Real Estate and Rental and Leasing; \n\n54 Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services; 562 Waste \n\nManagement and Remediation Services; 811 Repair and Maintenance; 92 \n\nPublic Administration.\n\n URL For More Information: http://www.epa.gov/pcb.\n\n Agency Contact: Sara Kemme, Environmental Protection Agency, Office \n\nof Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, 7404T, Washington, DC \n\n20460, Phone: 202 566-0511, Fax: 202 566-0473, Email: \n\nkemme.sara@epa.gov\n\n Peter Gimlin, Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Chemical \n\nSafety and Pollution Prevention, 7404T, Washington, DC 20460, Phone: \n\n202 566-0515, Fax: 202 566-0473, Email: gimlin.peter@epa.gov\n\n RIN: 2070-AJ38\n\nEPA--OCSPP\n\n129.

EPA.\n\n Abstract: Section 402(c)(3) of the Toxic Substances Control Act \n\n(TSCA) requires the EPA to regulate renovation or remodeling activities \n\nin target housing (most pre-1978 housing), pre-1978 public buildings, \n\nand commercial buildings that create lead-based paint hazards. On April \n\n22, 2008, the EPA issued a final rule to address lead-based paint \n\nhazards created by these activities in target housing and child-\n\noccupied facilities (child-occupied facilities are a subset of pre-1978 \n\npublic and commercial buildings where children under age 6 spend a \n\nsignificant amount of time). The 2008 rule established requirements for \n\nhttp://www.epa.gov/pcb\nmailto:kemme.sara@epa.gov\nmailto:gimlin.peter@epa.gov\n\n\ntraining renovators, other renovation workers, and dust sampling \n\ntechnicians; for certifying renovators, dust sampling technicians, and \n\nrenovation firms; for accrediting providers of renovation and dust \n\nsampling technician training; for renovation work practices; and for \n\nrecordkeeping. After the 2008 rule was published, the EPA was sued, in \n\npart, for failing to address potential hazards created by the \n\nrenovation of public and commercial buildings. In the settlement \n\nagreement and subsequent amendments, the EPA agreed to commence \n\nproceedings to determine whether or not renovations of public and \n\ncommercial buildings create hazards. Further, if these activities do \n\ncreate hazards, the EPA agreed to propose work practice and other \n\nrequirements by July 1, 2015, and to take final action, if appropriate, \n\nno later than 18 months after the proposal.\n\n Statement of Need: This rulemaking is being undertaken in response \n\nto a settlement agreement and is designed to help insure that \n\nindividuals and firms conducting renovation, repair, and painting \n\nactivities in and on public and commercial buildings will do so in a \n\nway that safeguards the environment and protects the health of building \n\noccupants and nearby residents, especially children under 6 years old. \n\nEPA has conducted several studies and reviewed additional information \n\nthat indicates that the renovation of buildings containing lead-based \n\npaint can create health hazards in the form of lead-based paint dust \n\nunder typical industry work practices.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Section 402(c)(3) of the Toxic Substances \n\nControl Act (TSCA) requires EPA to regulate renovation or remodeling \n\nactivities that create lead-based paint hazards in target housing, \n\npublic buildings built before 1978, and commercial buildings.\n\n Alternatives: For those activities that EPA determines create lead-\n\nbased paint hazards, EPA will evaluate options to address the hazards. \n\nThese options are likely to include different combinations of work \n\npractices and worker training and certification.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Not yet determined. A detailed \n\nanalysis of costs and benefits will be performed during development of \n\nthe proposed rule.\n\n Risks: Lead is known to cause deleterious health effects on \n\nmultiple organ systems through diverse mechanisms of action in both \n\nadults and children. This array of health effects includes effects on \n\nheme biosynthesis and related functions, neurological development and \n\nfunction, reproduction and physical development, kidney function, \n\ncardiovascular function, and immune function. EPA is evaluating \n\ninformation on renovation activity patterns in public and commercial \n\nbuildings to estimate exposures to lead dust from RRP activities in \n\n\n\nthose buildings.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nANPRM............................... 05/06/10 75 FR 24848\n\nNotice.............................. 12/31/12 77 FR 76996\n\nNotice.............................. 05/13/13 78 FR 27906\n\nNotice.............................. 05/30/14 79 FR 31072\n\nNotice.............................. 08/06/14 79 FR 45796\n\nNPRM................................ 07/00/15\n\n -----------------------------------\n\nFinal Rule..........................

Revisions to the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution \n\nContingency Plan; Subpart J Product Schedule Listing Requirements\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 33 U.S.C. 1321(d)(2); 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(3); 33 \n\nU.S.C. 1321(j)\n\n[[Page 76626]]\n\n CFR Citation: 40 CFR 300; 40 CFR 110.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: The Clean Water Act requires EPA to prepare a schedule \n\nidentifying dispersants, other chemicals, and other spill mitigating \n\ndevices and substances, if any, that may be used in carrying out the \n\nNational Contingency Plan (NCP); and the waters and quantities in which \n\nthey may be used. The EPA is considering revising subpart J of the NCP \n\nto address the efficacy, toxicity, and environmental monitoring of \n\ndispersants, other chemical and biological agents, and other spill \n\nmitigating substances, as well as public, state, local, and federal \n\nofficials concerns on their authorization and use. Specifically, the \n\nAgency is considering revisions to the technical product requirements \n\nunder subpart J, including amendments to the effectiveness and toxicity \n\ntesting protocols, and establishing new effectiveness and toxicity \n\nthresholds for listing certain products on the Schedule. Additionally, \n\nthe Agency is considering amendments to area planning requirements for \n\nagent use authorization and advanced monitoring techniques. The Agency \n\nis also considering revisions to harmonize 40 CFR part 110.4 with the \n\ndefinitions for chemical and biological agents proposed for subpart J. \n\nThese changes, if finalized, will help ensure that chemical and \n\nbiological agents have met rigorous efficacy and toxicity requirements, \n\nthat product manufacturers provide important use and safety \n\ninformation, and that the planning and response community is equipped \n\nwith the proper information to authorize and use the products in a \n\njudicious and effective manner.\n\n Statement of Need: The use of dispersants in response to the \n\nDeepwater Horizon incident, both on surface slicks and injected \n\ndirectly into the oil from the well riser, raised many questions about \n\nefficacy, toxicity, environmental trade-offs, and monitoring \n\nchallenges. The Agency is considering amendments to subpart J that \n\nwould increase the overall scientific soundness of the data collected \n\non mitigation agents, take into consideration not only the efficacy but \n\nalso the toxicity, long-term environmental impacts, endangered species \n\nprotection, and human health concerns raised during responses to oil \n\ndischarges, including the Deepwater Horizon incident. The additional \n\n\n\ndata requirements being considered would aid On-Scene Coordinators \n\n(OSCs) and Regional Response Teams (RRTs) when evaluating specific \n\nproduct information and when deciding whether and which products to use \n\nto mitigate hazards caused by discharges or threatened discharges of \n\noil. Additionally, the Agency is considering amendments to area \n\nplanning requirements for dispersant use authorization, toxicity \n\nthresholds and advanced monitoring techniques. This action is a major \n\ncomponent of the EPA's effort to inform the use of dispersants and \n\nother chemical or biological agents when responding to oil discharges, \n\nbased on lessons learned from the federal government's experiences in \n\nresponding to off-shore oil discharges, including the Deepwater Horizon \n\nincident, in the Gulf of Mexico and anticipation of the expansion of \n\noil exploration and production activities in the Arctic.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The Federal Water Pollution Control Act \n\n(FWPCA) requires the President to prepare and publish a National \n\nContingency Plan (NCP) for the removal of oil and hazardous substances. \n\nIn turn, the President delegated the authority to implement this \n\nsection of the FWPCA to the EPA through Executive Order 12777 (56 FR \n\n54757; October 22, 1991). Section 311(d)(2)(G)(i) of the FWPCA (a.k.a., \n\nClean Water Act), as amended by the OPA, requires that the NCP include \n\na schedule identifying ``dispersants, other chemicals, and other spill \n\nmitigating devices and substances, if any, that may be used in carrying \n\nout'' the NCP. Currently, the use of dispersants, other chemicals, and \n\nother oil spill mitigating devices and substances (e.g., bioremediation \n\nagents) to respond to oil discharges in U.S. waters is governed by \n\nsubpart J of the NCP (40 CFR part 300 series 900).\n\n Alternatives: The Agency will consider alternatives via the \n\nproposal that address the efficacy, toxicity, and environmental \n\nmonitoring of dispersants, and other chemical and biological agents, as \n\nwell as public, state, local, and federal officials' concerns regarding \n\ntheir use. Specifically, the alternative requirements for the NCP \n\nProduct Schedule (Schedule) consider new listing criteria, revisions to \n\nthe efficacy and toxicity testing protocols, and clarifications to the \n\nevaluation criteria for removing products from the Schedule. EPA is \n\nalso considering alternatives to the requirements for the authorities, \n\nnotifications, monitoring, and data reporting when using chemical or \n\nbiological agents in response to oil discharges in waters of the U.S. \n\nThe alternatives being considered are intended to encourage the \n\ndevelopment of safer and more effective spill mitigating products, to \n\nbetter target the use of these products in order to reduce the risks to \n\nhuman health and the environment, and to ensure that On-Scene \n\nCoordinators (OSCs), Regional Response Teams (RRTs), and Area \n\nCommittees have sufficient information to support agent \n\n\n\npreauthorization or authorization of use decisions.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The Agency expects the proposed \n\nrule, if finalized, would provide overall net benefits as a result of \n\nhaving more effective products on the Schedule, as well as from avoided \n\ncosts of oil spill response and cleanup. Costs to product manufacturers \n\nwould be incremental annual costs for product testing and labor. For \n\ncertain discharges, costs to the party responsible for the spill would \n\nbe added for monitoring requirements. A detailed costs and benefits \n\nanalysis will be available with the proposal.\n\n Risks: Although major catastrophic oil discharges where chemical or \n\nbiological agents may be used are relatively infrequent, this proposed \n\nrulemaking under subpart J should lead to the manufacture and use of \n\nless toxic, more effective oil spill mitigating products. The use of \n\nthese products may reduce the potential for human and environmental \n\nimpact, emergency response duration, and costs associated with any oil \n\ndischarge. However, the impacts will vary greatly depending on factors \n\nthat include the size, location and duration of an oil discharge, as \n\nwell as, the type of oil being discharged. While the reduction in \n\nenvironmental impacts associated with the use of oil spill mitigating \n\nagents driven by this action are likely small for typical oil \n\ndischarges, they could be significant in the event of a large oil \n\ndischarge.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 12/00/14 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, Local, State, Tribal.\n\n Additional Information: Docket #: EPA-HQ-OPA-2006-0090.\n\n Sectors Affected: 325 Chemical Manufacturing; 424 Merchant \n\nWholesalers, Nondurable Goods; 211 Oil and Gas Extraction; 541 \n\nProfessional, Scientific, and Technical Services; 562 Waste Management \n\nand Remediation Services.\n\n URL For More Information: http://www.epa.gov/oem/.\n\n Agency Contact: Vanessa Principe, Environmental Protection Agency, \n\nSolid Waste and Emergency Response, 5104A, Washington, DC 20460, Phone: \n\n202 564-\n\n[[Page 76627]]\n\nhttp://www.epa.gov/oem/\n\n\n7913, Fax: 202 564-2625, Email: principe.vanessa@epa.gov\n\n Craig Matthiessen, Environmental Protection Agency, Solid Waste and \n\nEmergency Response, 5104A, Washington, DC 20460, Phone: 202 564-8016, \n\nFax: 202 564-2625, Email: mattheissen.craig@epa.gov\n\n RIN: 2050-AE87\n\nEPA--SWER\n\n131. User Fee Schedule for Electronic Hazardous Waste Manifest\n\n Priority: Other Significant. Major status under 5 U.S.C. 801 is \n\nundetermined.\n\n Legal Authority: Pub. L. 112-195\n\n CFR Citation: Undetermined.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: After promulgation of the first e-Manifest regulation in \n\nFebruary 2014 to authorize the use of electronic manifests and to \n\ncodify key provisions of the Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest \n\nEstablishment Act (or Act), the EPA is moving forward on the \n\ndevelopment of the separate e-Manifest User Fee Schedule Regulation. \n\nThe Act authorizes the EPA to impose on manifest users reasonable \n\nservice fees that are necessary to pay costs incurred in developing, \n\noperating, maintaining and upgrading the system, including costs \n\nincurred in collecting and processing data from any paper manifest \n\nsubmitted to the system after the date on which the system enters \n\noperation. EPA plans to issue both a proposed and final rule in setting \n\nthe appropriate electronic manifest and manifest fees. The EPA intends \n\nto propose for comment the fee methodology for establishing the \n\nelectronic manifest and paper service fees. The EPA plans in a final \n\nrule to establish a program of fees that will be imposed on users of \n\nthe e-Manifest system and announce the user fee schedule for manifest-\n\nrelated activities, including activities associated with the collection \n\nand processing of paper manifests submitted to the EPA. EPA also plans \n\nin that final rule to announce (1) the date upon which the EPA will be \n\nready to transmit and receive manifests through the national e-Manifest \n\nsystem and (2) the date upon which the user community must comply with \n\nthe new e-Manifest regulation.\n\n Statement of Need: On February 7, 2014, the EPA promulgated the e-\n\nManifest Final rule, in order to comply with the Hazardous Waste \n\nElectronic Manifest Establishment Act, which required the EPA to issue \n\na regulation authorizing electronic manifests by October 5, 2013. In \n\nmailto:principe.vanessa@epa.gov\nmailto:mattheissen.craig@epa.gov\n\n\nissuing that rule, the EPA completed an important step that must \n\nprecede the development of a national e-Manifest system, as required by \n\nthe Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest Establishment Act. This rule is \n\nthe second regulation that must precede the development of the e-\n\nManifest system. This action will implement the broad discretion \n\ngranted on the Agency to establish reasonable user fees for the various \n\nactivities associated with using and submitting electronic and paper \n\nmanifests to the national system. Additionally, OMB Circular A-25 on \n\nUser Charges provides that agencies of the executive branch must \n\ngenerally set user fee charges or fees through regulation.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Section 2(c) of the e-Manifest Act \n\nauthorizes the EPA to impose on manifest users reasonable user fees to \n\npay any costs incurred in developing, operating, maintaining, and \n\nupgrading the system, including any costs incurred in collecting and \n\nprocessing data from any paper manifest submitted to the system. Thus, \n\nthis Action will implement the broad discretion granted on the Agency \n\nto establish reasonable user fees for the various activities associated \n\nwith using and submitting electronic and paper manifests to the \n\nnational system.\n\n Alternatives: The EPA plans to issue rulemaking to establish the \n\nappropriate electronic manifest and paper manifest fees. Specifically, \n\nEPA will explore options for who will pay user fees, the most efficient \n\npoint in the process for collecting the fees, and the fee methodologies \n\nand fee formulas that relate to setting the fees.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: When the e-Manifest Final Rule was \n\npublished in February 2014, the Agency deferred the development of the \n\ndetailed risk impact analysis (RIA) for the e-Manifest system until the \n\nUser Fee Schedule Rule. Thus, the RIA for the proposed User Fee \n\nSchedule Rule will not be limited to the impacts of the user fees \n\nannounced in the rule, but will also estimate the costs and benefits of \n\nthe overall e-Manifest system. The primary costs in the e-Manifest RIA \n\nwill be the cost to build the system, the costs for industry and state \n\ngovernments to connect to the system, and the cost to run the system. \n\nThe most significant benefit of the e-Manifest system estimated in the \n\nRIA will be reduced burden for industry to comply with RCRA manifesting \n\nrequirements, and the reduced burden on states that collect and utilize \n\nmanifest data for program management purposes.\n\n Risks: This action does not address any particular risks in the \n\nEPA's jurisdiction as it does not change existing requirements for \n\n\n\nmanifesting hazardous waste shipments. It will merely propose for \n\ncomment our fee methodology for setting the appropriate fees of \n\nelectronic manifests, and paper manifests that continue in use, at such \n\ntime as the system to receive them is built and operational.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 10/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Undetermined.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, Local, State.\n\n Additional Information: Docket #: EPA-HQ-RCRA-2001-0032.\n\n Sectors Affected: 11 Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting; 23 \n\nConstruction; 51 Information; 31-33 Manufacturing; 21 Mining, \n\nQuarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction; 92 Public Administration; 44-45 \n\nRetail Trade; 48-49 Transportation and Warehousing; 22 Utilities; 562 \n\nWaste Management and Remediation Services; 42 Wholesale Trade.\n\n URL for More Information: http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/hazard/transportation/manifest/e-man.htm.\n\n Agency Contact: Rich LaShier, Environmental Protection Agency, \n\nSolid Waste and Emergency Response, 5304P, Washington, DC 20460, Phone: \n\n703 308-8796, Fax: 703 308-0514, Email: LaShier.Rich@epa.gov\n\n Bryan Groce, Environmental Protection Agency, Solid Waste and \n\nEmergency Response, 5304P, Washington, DC 20460, Phone: 703 308-8750, \n\nFax: 703 308-0514, Email: Groce.Bryan@epa.gov\n\n RIN: 2050-AG80\n\nEPA--SWER\n\n132.

The Executive order establishes the Chemical Facility Safety \n\nand Security Working Group (``Working Group''), co-chaired by the \n\nSecretary of Homeland Security, the Administrator of the EPA, and the \n\nSecretary of Labor or their designated representatives at the Assistant \n\nSecretary level or higher, and composed of senior representatives of \n\nother Federal departments, agencies, and offices. The Executive order \n\nrequires the Working Group to carry out a number of tasks whose overall \n\naim is to prevent chemical accidents, such as the explosion that \n\noccurred at the West Fertilizer facility in West, Texas, on April 17, \n\n2013. Section 6 of the Executive order is entitled ``Policy, \n\nRegulation, and Standards Modernization'', and among other things, \n\nrequires certain federal agencies to consider possible changes to \n\nexisting chemical safety and security regulations. On July 31, 2014, \n\nthe EPA issued a Request for Information (RFI) to solicit stakeholder \n\nfeedback on a number of potential modifications to the RMP regulations. \n\nThis NPRM is expected to contain a number of proposed modifications to \n\nthe RMP regulations based on stakeholder feedback received from the \n\nRFI.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The statutory authority for this action is \n\nprovided by section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as amended (42 \n\nU.S.C. 7412(r)).\n\n Alternatives: Alternatives will be considered during the \n\ndevelopment of the proposal.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Benefits and costs will be examined \n\nin detail during the development of the proposal. For any proposed \n\nregulatory changes, EPA expects that benefits will be due to prevented \n\ncosts of accidental releases (e.g., through covering additional \n\nhazardous chemical processes, or addition or improvement of accident \n\nprevention program requirements), or reduced costs of accidental \n\nreleases that do occur (e.g., due to improvements in release detection \n\nor emergency response procedures). Costs will relate to coverage of any \n\nadditional sources or implementation of any additional accident \n\nprevention or emergency response program requirements that are imposed.\n\n Risks: Risks will be examined during the development of the \n\nproposal.\n\n\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 09/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Undetermined.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, Local, State.\n\n Federalism: Undetermined.\n\n Sectors Affected: 11 Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting; \n\n444 Building Material and Garden Equipment and Supplies Dealers; 325 \n\nChemical Manufacturing; 445 Food and Beverage Stores; 45431 Fuel \n\nDealers; 424 Merchant Wholesalers, Nondurable Goods; 21 Mining, \n\nQuarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction; 32411 Petroleum Refineries; 486 \n\nPipeline Transportation; 3221 Pulp, Paper, and Paperboard Mills; 482 \n\nRail Transportation; 488 Support Activities for Transportation; 221 \n\nUtilities; 493 Warehousing and Storage; 562 Waste Management and \n\nRemediation Services.\n\n URL For More Information: http://www2.epa.gov/rmp.\n\n Agency Contact: James Belke, Environmental Protection Agency, Solid \n\nWaste and Emergency Response, 5104A, Washington, DC 20460, Phone: 202 \n\n564-8023, Fax: 202 564-8444, Email: belke.jim@epa.gov\n\n Kathy Franklin, Environmental Protection Agency, Solid Waste and \n\nEmergency Response, 5104A, Washington, DC 20460, Phone: 202 564-7987, \n\nFax: 202 564-2625, Email: Franklin.Kathy@epa.gov\n\n RIN: 2050-AG82\n\nEPA--AIR AND RADIATION (AR)\n\nFinal Rule Stage\n\n133.

McCarthy; 12-1607 (RMC); USDC for \n\nthe District of Columbia filed 1/13/14.\n\n Abstract: This action pertains to the Petroleum Refining industry \n\nand specifically to petroleum refinery sources that are subject to \n\nmaximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards in 40 CFR part \n\n63, subparts CC (Refinery MACT 1) and UUU (Refinery MACT 2) and new \n\nsource performance standards (NSPS) in 40 CFR part 60, subpart Ja. This \n\naction is the Petroleum Refining Sector Rulemaking which will address \n\nour obligation to perform Risk and Technology Reviews (RTR) for \n\nPetroleum Refinery MACT 1 and 2 source categories and will address \n\nissues related to the reconsideration of Petroleum Refinery New Source \n\nPerformance Standard (NSPS) subpart Ja. Petroleum refineries are \n\nfacilities engaged in refining and producing products made from crude \n\noil or unfinished petroleum derivatives. Emission sources include \n\npetroleum refinery-specific process units unique to the industry, such \n\nas fluid catalytic cracking units (FCCU) and catalytic reforming units \n\n(CRU), as well as units and processes commonly found at other types of \n\nmanufacturing facilities (including petroleum refineries), such as \n\nstorage vessels and wastewater treatment plants. Refinery MACT 1 \n\nregulates hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions from common processes \n\nsuch as miscellaneous process vents (e.g., delayed coking vents), \n\nstorage vessels, wastewater, equipment leaks, loading racks, marine \n\ntank vessel loading and heat exchange systems at petroleum refineries. \n\nRefinery MACT 2 regulates HAP from those processes that are unique to \n\nthe industry including sulfur recovery units (SRU) and from catalyst \n\nregeneration in FCCU and CRU. A proposed rule was signed on 5/15/14 and \n\npublished in the Federal Register on 6/30/14 (79 FR 36880). The EPA is \n\nreviewing comments and preparing a final rule for signature in 2015.\n\n Statement of Need: This proposal is required by Clean Air Act \n\nSection 112 to review technology-based standards and revise them as \n\nnecessary but no less frequently than every eight years under 112 \n\n(d)(6) and to review and reduce remaining risk (ie., residual) \n\naccording to Section 112 (f).\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Environmental and other public health \n\ngroups filed a lawsuit alleging that EPA missed statutory deadlines to \n\nreview and revise Refinery MACT 1 and 2. The EPA reached an agreement \n\nto settle this litigation, and in a consent decree filed January 13, \n\n2014 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, EPA \n\ncommitted to perform the risk and technology review for Refinery MACT 1 \n\nand 2 by May 15, 2014 to either propose any regulations or propose that \n\naddiitonal regulations are not necessary. Under the consent decree, EPA \n\ncomitted\n\n\n\n[[Page 76629]]\n\nto take final action by April 17, 2015, establishing regulations \n\npursuant to the risk and technology review or to issue a final \n\ndetermination that revision to the existing rules is not necessary.\n\n Alternatives: Alternatives were discussed in the proposal preamble \n\npublished on June 30, 2014, at 79 FR 36879.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: For the proposal, estimated total \n\ncapital investment--240 million, total annualized cost--42 million; \n\nProjected reductions of 52,000 tons VOC, 5,560 tons of HAP.\n\n Risks: The risk addressed is human health risk. The proposal \n\nestimated that cancer incidence would be reduced by 15% over the \n\ncurrent baseline as a result of proposed amendments.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 06/30/14 79 FR 36879\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 08/15/14 79 FR 48111\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 05/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, Local, State.\n\n Additional Information: Docket #: EPA-HQ-OAR-2010-0682.\n\n Sectors Affected: 324110 Petroleum Refineries.\n\n URL For More Information: http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/petrefine/petrefpg.html.\n\n Agency Contact: Brenda Shine, Environmental Protection Agency, Air \n\nand Radiation, E143-01, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, Phone: 919 \n\n541-3608, Fax: 919 541-0246, Email: shine.brenda@epamail.epa.gov\n\n Penny Lassiter, Environmental Protection Agency, Air and Radiation, \n\nE143-01, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, Phone: 919 541-5396, Fax: \n\n919 541-0246, Email: lassiter.penny@epa.gov\n\n RIN: 2060-AQ75\n\nEPA--AR\n\n134.

This rule will \n\nestablish carbon dioxide (CO2) emission standards for certain new \n\nfossil fuel-fired electric generating units.\n\n Statement of Need: EGU GHG NSPS is the first action item in \n\nPresident Obama's Climate Action Plan (CAP). The CAP called for the EPA \n\nto issue a proposal by September 20, 2013 to regulate carbon emissions \n\nfrom fossil fuel-fired power plants.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: CO2 is a regulated pollutant and this is \n\nsubject to regulation under section 111 of the Clean Air Act as amended \n\nin 1990.\n\n Alternatives: The three alternatives the EPA considered in the BSER \n\nanalysis for new fossil fuel-fired utility boilers and IGCC units are: \n\n(1) Highly efficient new generation that does not include CCS \n\ntechnology, (2) highly efficient new generation with ``full capture'' \n\nCCS and (3) highly efficient new generation with ``partial capture'' \n\nCCS.\n\n We considered two alternatives in evaluating the BSER for new \n\nfossil fuel-fired stationary combustion turbines: (1) Modern, efficient \n\nNGCC units and (2) modern, efficient NGCC units with CCS.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Under a wide range of electricity \n\nmarket conditions--including the EPA's baseline scenario as well as \n\nmultiple sensitivity analyses--EPA projects that the industry will \n\nchoose to construct new units that already meet these standards, \n\nregardless of this proposal. As a result, the EPAanticipates that the \n\nproposed EGU New Source GHG Standards will result in negligible CO2 \n\nemission changes, energy impacts, benefits or costs for new units \n\nconstructed by 2020.\n\n Risks: The risk addressed is the current and future threat of \n\nclimate change to public health and welfare, as demonstrated in the \n\n2009 Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Finding for Greenhouse Gases \n\nUnder Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act. The EPA made this \n\ndetermination based primarily upon the recent, major assessments by the \n\nU.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), the National Research \n\nCouncil (NRC) of the National Academies and the Intergovernmental Panel \n\non Climate Change (IPCC).\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nNPRM................................ 04/13/12 77 FR 22392\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 05/04/12 77 FR 26476\n\nNotice.............................. 01/08/14 79 FR 1352\n\nSecond NPRM......................... 01/08/14 79 FR 1429\n\nNotice.............................. 02/26/14 79 FR 10750\n\nComment Period Extended............. 03/06/14 79 FR 12681\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 01/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, State, Tribal.\n\n Additional Information: Docket #: EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0660.\n\n Sectors Affected: 221 Utilities.\n\n URL For Public Comments: http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0660-0001.\n\n Agency Contact: Nick Hutson, Environmental Protection Agency, Air \n\nand Radiation, D243-01, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, Phone: 919 \n\n451-2968, Fax: 919 541-5450, Email: hutson.nick@epa.gov\n\n Christian Fellner, Environmental Protection Agency, Air and \n\nRadiation, D243-01, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, Phone: 919 541-\n\n4003, Fax: 919 541-5450, Email: fellner.christian@epa.gov\n\n RIN: 2060-AQ91\n\nEPA--AR\n\n135.

Other issues also addressed in \n\nthis final rule are the revocation of the 1997 ozone NAAQS for purposes \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0660-0001\nmailto:hutson.nick@epa.gov\nmailto:fellner.christian@epa.gov\n\n\nother than transportation conformity; anti-backsliding requirements \n\nthat would apply when the 1997 NAAQS are revoked; and the section 185 \n\nfee program.\n\n[[Page 76630]]\n\n Statement of Need: This rule is needed to establish requirements \n\nfor what states must include in their state implementation plans (SIPs) \n\nto bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the 2008 ozone NAAQS. \n\nThere is no court-ordered deadline for this final rule. However, the \n\nCAA requires the nonattainment area plans addressed by this rule to be \n\ndeveloped and submitted by states within 2 to 3 years after the July \n\n20, 2012 date of nonattainment designations.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: CAA section 110 authorizes EPA to require \n\nstate planning to attain the NAAQS and to help states implement their \n\nplans.\n\n Alternatives: The rule included several alternatives for meeting \n\nimplementation requirements, including but not limited to options for \n\nSIP submittal dates, NOX substitution for VOC in RFP SIPs, \n\nalternative baseline years for RFP and alternatives for addressing \n\nanti-backsliding requirements once the 1997 ozone NAAQS has been \n\nrevoked. The EPA solicited comments on a number of topics, including \n\nalternative approaches to achieving RFP, RACT flexibility and alternate \n\nrevocation dates for the 1997 ozone NAAQS.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The annual burden for this \n\ninformation collection averaged over the first 3 years is estimated to \n\nbe a total of 120,000 labor hours per year at an annual labor cost of \n\n$2.4 million (present value) over the 3-year period or approximately \n\n$91,000 per state for the 26 state respondents, including the District \n\nof Columbia. The average annual reporting burden is 690 hours per \n\nresponse, with approximately 2 responses per state for 58 state \n\nrespondents. There are no capital or operating and maintenance costs \n\nassociated with the proposed rule requirements. Burden is defined at 5 \n\nCFR 1320.3(b).\n\n Risks: Ozone concentrations that exceed the National Ambient Air \n\nQuality Standards (NAAQS) to can cause adverse public health and \n\nwelfare effects, as discussed in the March 27, 2008 Final Rule for \n\nNAAQS for Ozone (73 FR 16436).\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 06/06/13 78 FR 34177\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 07/24/13 78 FR 44485\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 03/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, Local, State, Tribal.\n\n Additional Information: Docket #: EPA-HQ-OAR-2010-0885.\n\n URL For More Information: http://www.epa.gov/air/ozonepollution/actions.html#impl.\n\n Agency Contact: Karl Pepple, Environmental Protection Agency, Air \n\nand Radiation, C539-01, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, Phone: 206 \n\n553-1778, Fax: 919 541-0824, Email: pepple.karl@epa.gov\n\n Megan Brachtl, Environmental Protection Agency, Air and Radiation, \n\nC539-01, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, Phone: 919 541-2648, Fax: \n\n919 541-5315, Email: brachtl.megan@epa.gov\n\n RIN: 2060-AR34\n\nEPA--AR\n\n136.

Pesticides; Agricultural Worker Protection Standard Revisions\n\n Priority: Other Significant.\n\n Legal Authority: 7 U.S.C. 136w\n\n CFR Citation: 40 CFR 170.\n\n Legal Deadline: None.\n\n Abstract: On March 19, 2014, the EPA proposed to revise the federal \n\nregulations issued under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \n\nRodenticide Act (FIFRA) that direct agricultural worker protection (40 \n\nCFR 170). The proposed changes are in response to extensive stakeholder \n\nreview of the regulation and its implementation since 1992, and reflect \n\nmailto:fellner.christian@epa.gov\nmailto:hutson.nick@epa.gov\n\n\ncurrent research on how to mitigate occupational pesticide exposure to \n\nagricultural workers and pesticide handlers. The EPA is proposing to \n\nstrengthen the protections provided to agricultural workers and \n\nhandlers under the worker protection standard by improving elements of \n\nthe existing regulation, such as training, notification, communication \n\nmaterials, use of personal protective equipment, and decontamination \n\nsupplies. The EPA expects the revisions, once final, to prevent \n\nunreasonable adverse effects from exposure to pesticides among \n\nagricultural workers and pesticide\n\n[[Page 76631]]\n\nhandlers; vulnerable groups, such as minority and low-income \n\npopulations, child farmworkers, and farmworker families; and the \n\ngeneral public. The EPA recognizes the importance and independence of \n\nfamily farms and is proposing to expand the immediate family exemption \n\nto the WPS.\n\n Statement of Need: Stakeholders have identified gaps in the \n\nprotections in the current worker protection regulations. Revisions to \n\nthe regulations are necessary to better protect agricultural workers \n\nand pesticide handlers from unreasonable adverse effects of pesticide \n\nexposure.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: This rulemaking is being developed under \n\nthe authority of sections 2 through 35 of the Federal Insecticide, \n\nFungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), 7 U.S.C. 136-136y, and \n\nparticularly section 25(a), 7 U.S.C. 136w(a).\n\n Alternatives: EPA proposed several amendments to the existing WPS \n\nrequirements, including: amending the existing pesticide safety \n\ntraining content, retraining interval (frequency), and qualifications \n\nof trainers; ensuring workers receive safety information before \n\nentering any pesticide treated area by amending the existing grace \n\nperiod and expanding the training required during the grace period; \n\nestablishing a minimum age of 16 for handlers and for workers who enter \n\nan area under an re-entry interval (REI); establishing requirements for \n\nspecific training and notification for workers who enter an area under \n\nan REI; restricting persons' entry into areas adjacent to a treated \n\narea during an application; enhancing the requirement for employers to \n\npost warning signs around treated areas; modifying the content of the \n\nwarning sign; adding information employers must keep under the \n\nrequirement to maintain application-specific information; requiring \n\nrecordkeeping for pesticide safety training and worker entry into areas \n\nunder an REI; ensuring the immediate family exemption includes an \n\nexemption from the proposed minimum age requirements for handlers and \n\nearly-entry workers; and expanding the definition of immediate family \n\n\n\nto allow more family-owned operations to qualify for the exemptions to \n\nthe WPS requirements. EPA considered a variety of alternatives for each \n\nof the proposed changes. The published NPRM describes each of the \n\nalternatives considered in detail.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The Economic Analysis issued with \n\nthe proposed rule provides the EPA's analysis of the potential costs \n\nand impacts associated with the proposed rule. As proposed, the \n\nestimated cost is between $62 and $73 million annually, with most of \n\nthe cost on the agricultural employer; and the quantified benefits are \n\nestimated between $5-$14 million annually, from avoided acute \n\nillnesses. A break even analysis of the potential reduction in chronic \n\nillnesses indicates that only 53 cases of several chronic illnesses \n\n(Parkinson's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate cancer, lung \n\ncancer, chronic bronchitis, and asthma) would satisfy the gap between \n\nthe quantified benefits and the cost.\n\n Risks: Agricultural workers and pesticide handlers are at risk from \n\npesticide exposure through their work activities, and may put their \n\nfamilies at risk of secondary exposures. In order to address exposure \n\nrisks to workers, pesticide handlers, and their families, the Agency \n\nhas proposed revisions identified by stakeholders.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 03/19/14 79 FR 15443\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 05/14/14 79 FR 27546\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 06/17/14 .......................\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended End.... 08/18/14 .......................\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 05/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, Local, State, Tribal.\n\n Additional Information: Docket #: EPA-HQ-OPP-2011-0184-0119.\n\n Sectors Affected: 111 Crop Production; 115 Support Activities for \n\nAgriculture and Forestry; 32532 Pesticide and Other Agricultural \n\nChemical Manufacturing; 541690 Other Scientific and Technical \n\nConsulting Services; 541712 Research and Development in the Physical, \n\nEngineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology); 8133 Social \n\nAdvocacy Organizations\n\n\n\n URL For More Information: http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/health/worker.htm.\n\n URL For Public Comments:            http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=EPA-HQ-OPP-2011-0184.\n\n Agency Contact: Kathy Davis, Environmental Protection Agency, \n\nOffice of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, 7506P, Washington, \n\nDC 20460, Phone: 703 308-7002, Fax: 703 308-2962, Email: \n\ndavis.kathy@epa.gov\n\n Richard Pont, Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Chemical \n\nSafety and Pollution Prevention, 7506P, Washington, DC 20460, Phone: \n\n703 305-6448, Fax: 703 308-2962, Email: pont.richard@epa.gov\n\n RIN: 2070-AJ22\n\nEPA--OCSPP\n\n138.

In 2013, the EPA \n\nissued a proposed rule under TSCA title VI to establish a framework for \n\na TSCA title VI Third-Party Certification Program whereby third-party \n\ncertifiers (TPCs) are accredited by accreditation bodies (ABs) so that \n\nthey may certify composite wood product panel producers under TSCA \n\ntitle VI. The proposed rule identifies the roles and responsibilities \n\nof the groups involved in the TPC process (EPA, ABs, and TPCs), as well \n\nas the criteria for participation in the program. This proposal \n\ncontains general requirements for TPCs, such as conducting and \n\nverifying formaldehyde emission tests, inspecting and auditing panel \n\nproducers, and ensuring that panel producers' quality assurance and \n\nquality control procedures comply with the regulations set forth in the \n\nproposed rule. A separate Regulatory Agenda entry (RIN 2070-AJ92) \n\ncovers the other proposed regulation to implement the statutory \n\nformaldehyde emission standards for hardwood plywood, medium-density \n\nhttp://www.epa.gov/pesticides/health/worker.htm\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=EPA-HQ-OPP-2011-0184\nmailto:davis.kathy@epa.gov\nmailto:pont.richard@epa.gov\n\n\nfiberboard, and particleboard sold, supplied, offered for sale, or \n\nmanufactured (including imported) in the United States. EPA may decide \n\nto issue a single final rule to promulgate the final requirements \n\nrelated to both proposed rules.\n\n Statement of Need: TSCA title VI directs the EPA to promulgate\n\n[[Page 76632]]\n\nregulations to implement the statutory formaldehyde emission standards \n\nand emissions testing requirements for composite wood products \n\n(hardwood plywood, particleboard, and medium-density fiberboard). It \n\nalso directs the EPA to include regulatory provisions relating to \n\nthird-party testing and certification in addition to the auditing and \n\nreporting of third-party certifiers.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The EPA is issuing this rule under title VI \n\nof the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), 15 U.S.C. 2697, enacted in \n\nthe Formaldehyde Standards for Composite Wood Products Act of 2010, \n\nwhich provides authority for the EPA to ``[Acirc]`[Acirc]`promulgate \n\nregulations to implement the standards required under subsection (b) of \n\nthe Act. This provision includes authority to promulgate regulations \n\nrelating to [Acirc]`[Acirc]`third-party testing and certification' and \n\n[Acirc]`[Acirc]`auditing and reporting of third-party certifiers.''\n\n Alternatives: As explained in the proposed rule, EPA considered a \n\nvariety of alternatives. EPA considered directly operating a program \n\nfor the accreditation of TPCs instead of entering into recognition \n\nagreements with ABs for that purpose. EPA considered increasing the \n\namount of time for receiving accreditations under TSCA Title VI that \n\nwas proposed to be afforded to TPCs that are already recognized by the \n\nCalifornia Air Resources Board (CARB). In addition, EPA considered \n\nrequiring TPCs to be reaccredited every 2 years (which would align with \n\nCARB's requirements) instead of every 3 year years, and requiring Abs \n\nto audit TPCs once every 3 years instead of every 2 years (which would \n\nalign with the proposed 3 year accreditation period). EPA also \n\nconsidered alternative retailer recordkeeping provisions for records \n\nrelated to the manufacture of component parts and finished goods prior \n\nto the effective date of the final rule. Finally, while the Agency did \n\nnot propose mandatory electronic reporting for information that ABs and \n\nTPCs would be required to submit under the proposed rule, EPA sought \n\npublic comment on such a requirement. EPA is evaluating public comments \n\n\n\nconcerning the proposed rule and alternatives as it formulates the \n\nfinal rule.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Issued with the proposed rule, the \n\nEconomic Analysis provides the EPA analysis of the potential costs and \n\nimpacts associated with this rulemaking. As proposed, the annualized \n\ncosts are estimated at approximately $34,000 per year using either a 3% \n\ndiscount rate or a 7% discount rate. This rule would impact an \n\nestimated 9 small entities, of which 8 are expected to have impacts of \n\nless than 1% of revenues or expenses, and 1 is expected to have impacts \n\nbetween 1% and 3%. State, Local, and Tribal Governments are not \n\nexpected to be subject to the rule's requirements, which apply to \n\nthird-party certifiers and accreditation bodies. The rule does not have \n\na significant intergovernmental mandate, significant or unique effect \n\non small governments, or have Federalism implications.\n\n Risks: At room temperature, formaldehyde is a colorless, flammable \n\ngas that has a distinct, pungent smell. Small amounts of formaldehyde \n\nare naturally produced by plants, animals and humans. Formaldehyde is \n\nused widely by industry to manufacture a range of building materials \n\nand numerous household products. It is in resins used to manufacture \n\nsome composite wood products (e.g., hardwood plywood, particleboard and \n\nmedium-density fiberboard). Everyone is exposed to small amounts of \n\nformaldehyde in the air, some foods, and products, including composite \n\nwood products. The primary way you can be exposed to formaldehyde is by \n\nbreathing air containing it. Formaldehyde can cause irritation of the \n\nskin, eyes, nose, and throat. High levels of exposure may cause some \n\ntypes of cancers.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nANPRM............................... 12/03/08 73 FR 73620\n\nSecond ANPRM........................ 01/30/09 74 FR 5632\n\nNPRM................................ 06/10/13 78 FR 34795\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 07/23/13 78 FR 44090\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 08/21/13 78 FR 51696\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 02/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n International Impacts: This regulatory action will be likely to \n\nhave international trade and investment effects, or otherwise be of \n\ninternational interest.\n\n Additional Information: Docket #: ANPRM stage: EPA-HQ-OPPT-2008-\n\n0627; NPRM Stage: EPA-HQ-OPPT-2011-0380.

In \n\n2013, the EPA proposed regulations to implement emissions standards \n\nestablished by TSCA title VI for composite wood products sold, \n\nsupplied, offered for sale, or manufactured in the United States. \n\nPursuant to TSCA section 3(7), the\n\n[[Page 76633]]\n\ndefinition of ``manufacture'' includes import. As required by title VI, \n\nthese regulations apply to hardwood plywood, medium-density fiberboard, \n\nand particleboard. TSCA title VI also directs EPA to promulgate \n\nsupplementary provisions to ensure compliance with the emissions \n\nstandards, including provisions related to labeling; chain of custody \n\nrequirements; sell-through provisions; ULEF resins; no-added \n\nformaldehyde-based resins; finished goods; third-party testing and \n\ncertification; auditing and reporting of third-party certifiers; \n\nrecordkeeping; enforcement; laminated products; and exceptions from the \n\nrequirements of regulations promulgated pursuant to this subsection for \n\nproducts and components containing de minimis amounts of composite wood \n\nproducts. A separate Regulatory Agenda entry (RIN 2070-AJ44) addresses \n\nrequirements for accrediting bodies and third-party certifiers. EPA may \n\ndecide to issue a single final rule to promulgate the final \n\nrequirements related to both proposed rules.\n\n Statement of Need: TSCA title VI directs the EPA to promulgate \n\nregulations to implement the statutory formaldehyde emission standards \n\nand emissions testing requirements for composite wood products \n\n(hardwood plywood, particleboard, and medium-density fiberboard).\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The EPA is issuing this rule under title VI \n\nof the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), 15 U.S.C. 2697, enacted in \n\nthe Formaldehyde Standards for Composite Wood Products Act of 2010, \n\nwhich directs EPA to promulgate regulations to implement the \n\nformaldehyde emission standards and emissions testing requirements \n\nestablished by the Act. Congress directed the EPA to consider a number \n\nof elements for inclusion in the implementing regulations, many of \n\nwhich are aspects of the California Air Resources Board (CARB) program. \n\nThese elements include: (a) labeling, (b) chain of custody \n\nrequirements, (c) sell-through provisions, (d) ultra low-emitting \n\nformaldehyde resins, (e) no-added formaldehyde-based resins, (f) \n\nfinished goods, (g) third-party testing and certification, (h) auditing \n\nand reporting of TPCs, (i) recordkeeping, (j) enforcement, (k) \n\n\n\nlaminated products, and (l) exceptions from the requirements of \n\nregulations promulgated for products and components containing de \n\nminimis amounts of composite wood products.\n\n Alternatives: TSCA Title VI establishes national formaldehyde \n\nemission standards for composite wood products and the EPA has not been \n\ngiven the authority to change those standards. EPA considered various \n\nalternatives to other proposed requirements. With respect to a \n\ndefinition of hardwood plywood, EPA considered exempting all laminated \n\nproducts from the definition, exempting all laminated products except \n\narchitectural panels and custom plywood, exempting laminated products \n\nmade using no-added formaldehyde (NAF) resins to attach veneer to \n\nplatforms certified as NAF, and exempting laminated products made using \n\nNAF resins to attach veneer to compliant and certified platforms. EPA \n\nalso considered allowing certifications for ultra-low emitting \n\nformaldehyde. Furthermore, EPA considered reduced recordkeeping \n\nrequirements for firms that do not qualify as manufacturers under TSCA, \n\nnot requiring notification to suppliers that the products supplied must \n\ncomply with TSCA Title VI, and allowing to tested lots to be shipped \n\nbefore test results are available. EPA is evaluating implementation \n\nalternatives in this rulemaking and public comments.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Issued with the proposed rule, the \n\nEconomic Analysis provides the EPA's analysis of the potential costs \n\nand benefits associated with this rulemaking. As proposed, this \n\nrulemaking will reduce exposures to formaldehyde, resulting in benefits \n\nfrom avoided adverse health effects. For the subset of health effects \n\nwhere the results were quantified, the estimated annualized benefits \n\n(due to avoided incidence of eye irritation and nasopharyngeal cancer) \n\nare $20 million to $48 million per year using a 3% discount rate, and \n\n$9 million to $23 million per year using a 7% discount rate. There are \n\nadditional unquantified benefits due to other avoided health effects. \n\nThe annualized costs are estimated at $72 million to $81 million per \n\nyear using a 3% discount rate, and $80 million to $89 million per year \n\nusing a 7% discount rate. Government entities are not expected to be \n\nsubject to the rule's requirements, which apply to entities that \n\nmanufacture (including import), fabricate, distribute, or sell \n\ncomposite wood products. EPA also estimated that the rulemaking would \n\nimpact nearly 879,000 small businesses: Over 851,000 have costs impacts \n\nless than 1% of revenues, over 23,000 firms have impacts between 1% and \n\n3%, and over 4,000 firms have impacts greater than 3% of revenues. Most \n\nfirms with impacts over 1% have annualized costs of less than $250 per \n\nyear. This rule increases the level of environmental protection for all \n\n\n\naffected populations without having any disproportionately high and \n\nadverse human health or environmental effects on any population, \n\nincluding any minority or low-income population or children. The \n\nestimated costs of the proposed rule exceed the quantified benefits. \n\nThere are additional unquantified benefits due to other avoided health \n\neffects. After assessing both the costs and the benefits of the \n\nproposal, including the unquantified benefits, EPA has made a reasoned \n\ndetermination that the benefits of the proposal justify its costs.\n\n Risks: At room temperature, formaldehyde is a colorless, flammable \n\ngas that has a distinct, pungent smell.

The EPA sought \n\npublic comments on two regulatory approaches. One proposed option would \n\nbe to list these residuals as ``special wastes,'' and draws from \n\nremedies available under subtitle C of RCRA, which creates a \n\ncomprehensive program of federally enforceable requirements for waste \n\nmanagement and disposal. The other proposed option included remedies \n\nunder subtitle D of RCRA, which gives the EPA authority to set disposal \n\nstandards for waste management facilities. Under both options, the EPA \n\nproposed not to regulate the beneficial use of CCRs, such as its use in \n\nconcrete. In addition, this rule did not address CCRs generated from \n\nnon-utility boilers burning coal, nor would it address the placement of \n\ncoal combustion residuals in mines or non-minefill uses of CCRs at coal \n\nmine sites. Since the publication of the proposed rule, EPA has issued \n\nthree Notices of Data Availability (NODAs) seeking public comment on \n\nadditional data and information obtained by the EPA. In the most recent \n\nNODA, issued on August 2, 2013, the EPA invited comment on additional \n\ninformation to supplement the Regulatory Impact Analysis and risk \n\nassessment; information on large scale fill; and data on the surface \n\nimpoundment structural integrity assessments. With this NODA, the EPA \n\nalso sought comment on two issues associated with the requirements for \n\nCCR management units, closure and the construction of new units over \n\npre-existing CCR landfills and surface impoundments. Under a consent \n\ndecree, a final rule must be signed no later than December 19, 2014.\n\n Statement of Need: The EPA is proposing to regulate for the first \n\ntime, coal combustion residuals under the Resource Conservation and \n\nRecovery Act (RCRA) to address the risks from the disposal of coal \n\ncombustion residuals in surface impoundments and landfills, generated \n\nfrom the combustion of coal at electric utilities and by independent \n\npower producers.\n\n\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The CCR rule was proposed under the \n\nauthority of sections 1008(a), 2002(a), 3001, 3004, 3005, and 4004 of \n\nthe Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1970, as amended by RCRA and as amended \n\nby the hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA). These \n\nstatutes, combined, are commonly referred to as ``RCRA.'' RCRA section \n\n1008(a) authorizes the EPA to publish ``suggested guidelines for solid \n\nwaste management.'' Such guidelines must provide a technical and \n\neconomic descriptions of the level of performance that can be achieved \n\nby available solid waste management practices that provide for the \n\nprotection of human health and the environment. RCRA section 2002 \n\ngrants the EPA broad authority to prescribe, in consultation with \n\nfederal, state and regional authorities, such regulations as are \n\nnecessary to carry out the function under federal solid waste disposal \n\nlaws. RCRA section 3001(b) requires EPA to list particular wastes that \n\nwill be subject to the requirements established under subtitle C. \n\nSection 3001(b)(3)(A) generally establishes a temporary exemption for \n\nCCRs primarily from the combustion of coal or other fossil fuels and \n\nrequires the EPA to conduct a study to determine whether these waste \n\nshould be regulated under Subtitle C or RCRA. Section 3004 generally \n\nrequires EPA to establish standards for the treatment, storage, and \n\ndisposal of hazardous waste to ensure protection of human health and \n\nthe environment. RCRA section 3004(x) allows the Administrator to \n\ntailor certain specified requirements for particular categories of \n\nwastes. RCRA section 3005 generally requires that any facility that \n\ntreats, stores, or disposes of wastes identified or listed under \n\nsubtitle C, to have a permit. RCRA section 4004 requires the EPA to \n\npromulgate regulations\n\n[[Page 76635]]\n\ncontaining criteria for determining which facilities shall be \n\nclassified as sanitary landfills (and not open dumps).\n\n Alternatives: In the proposed rule EPA considered two options for \n\nthe regulation of CCRs. Under the first option, the EPA would reverse \n\nits August 1993 and May 2000 Bevill Regulatory Determinations regarding \n\nCCRs and list these residuals as special wastes subject to regulation \n\nunder subtitle C of RCRA, when they are destined for disposal in \n\nlandfills or surface impoundments. Under the second option, the EPA \n\nwould leave the Bevill determination in place and regulate the disposal \n\nof such materials under subtitle D of RCRA by issuing national minimum \n\ncriteria. Under both options, the EPA considered establishing dam \n\nsafety requirements to address the structural integrity of surface \n\nimpoundment to prevent catastrophic releases. The EPA also solicited \n\n\n\ncomment on a number of alternatives including several combination \n\napproaches, such as regulating surface impoundments under subtitle C of \n\nRCRA while regulating landfills under subtitle D or RCRA.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The EPA estimated the potential \n\ncosts and benefits of the proposed CCR rule in a regulatory impact \n\nanalysis (RIA) dated April 2010. Although in June 2010 the EPA co-\n\nproposed two regulatory options (i.e., subtitle C and subtitle D \n\noptions) for the CCR rule, the RIA evaluated three regulatory \n\napproaches to the proposed rule: subtitle C, subtitle D, and subtitle \n\n``D Prime'' options. The RIA is available from the regulatory docket as \n\ndocument ID number EPA-HQ-RCRA-2009-0640-0003. Based on a 50-year \n\nfuture period of analysis using a 7% discount rate at year 2009 price \n\nlevel, the RIA estimated the potential average annual future costs of \n\nthese three options to range between $1,474 million, $587 million, and \n\n$236 million per year, respectively. These costs are associated with 12 \n\nto 19 different combinations of pollution controls (i.e., engineering \n\ncontrols & ancillary requirements) proposed for each option such as \n\ngroundwater monitoring, landfill and impoundment bottom liners, \n\nfugitive dust controls, and location restrictions, to name a few.\n\n Based on three monetized benefit categories consisting of (a) \n\navoided future groundwater contamination from CCR landfills and \n\nimpoundments, (b) avoided future CCR impoundment structural failures, \n\nand (c) induced future increase in the beneficial uses of CCR as a \n\nsubstitute ingredient in concrete, cement, wallboard, and about a dozen \n\nother markets, the RIA estimated the potential future average annual \n\nbenefits of the three options to range between $6,320 to $7,405, $2,533 \n\nto $3,026 and $1,023 to $1,268 per year, respectively. Because some \n\nstakeholders during the development of the CCR proposed rule asserted \n\nto the EPA a potential future stigma effect in beneficial use markets \n\nunder the Subtitle C option, the RIA also evaluated a potential dis-\n\nbenefit decrease in CCR beneficial uses under an alternative scenario, \n\nas well as under a no change in beneficial use scenario.\n\n Risks: The EPA's damage cases and risk assessments all indicated \n\nthe potential for CCR landfills and surface impoundments to leach \n\nhazardous constituents into groundwater, impairing drinking water \n\nsupplies and causing adverse impacts on human health and the \n\nenvironment. Indeed, groundwater contamination is one of the key \n\nenvironmental risks the EPA has identified with CCR landfills and \n\nsurface impoundments. Furthermore, as mentioned previously, the \n\nlegislative history of RCRA specifically evidences concerns over \n\ngroundwater contamination from disposal units. Composite liners, as \n\n\n\nmodeled in the 2010 draft risk assessment, effectively reduce risks \n\nfrom all constituents to below the risk criteria for both landfills and \n\nsurface impoundments at the 90th and 50th percentiles. Thus, the \n\nrequirements for new units to be composite lined will reduce future \n\nrisks significantly. However, the EPA proposed several regulatory \n\nalternatives that may or may not require existing units without \n\ncomposite liners to close.\n\n To this end, groundwater monitoring is a key mechanism for \n\nfacilities to verify that the existing containment structures, such as \n\nliners and leachate collection and removal systems, are functioning as \n\nintended. Thus, the EPA believes that, in order for a CCR landfill or \n\nsurface impoundment to meet RCRA's protection standard, a system of \n\nroutine groundwater monitoring to detect any such contamination from a \n\ndisposal unit, and corrective action requirements to address identified \n\ncontamination, is necessary. EPA's proposed groundwater monitoring \n\ncriteria require a system of monitoring wells be installed at new and \n\nexisting CCR landfills and surface impoundments. The proposed criteria \n\nalso provide procedures for sampling these wells and methods for \n\nstatistical analysis of the analytical data derived from the well \n\nsamples to detect the presence of hazardous constituents released from \n\nthese facilities. The Agency proposed a groundwater monitoring program \n\nconsisting of detection monitoring, assessment monitoring, and a \n\ncorrective action program. This phased approach to groundwater \n\nmonitoring and corrective action programs provide for a graduated \n\nresponse over time to the problem of groundwater contamination as the \n\nevidence of such contamination increases. This allows for proper \n\nconsideration of the transport characteristics of CCR constituents in \n\nground water, while protecting human health and the environment, and \n\nminimizing unnecessary costs.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotice.............................. 08/29/07 72 FR 49714\n\nNPRM................................ 06/21/10 75 FR 35128\n\nNotice.............................. 07/15/10 75 FR 41121\n\nNotice.............................. 10/12/11 76 FR 63252\n\nNotice.............................. 08/02/13 78 FR 46940\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 12/00/14 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, Local, State, Tribal.\n\n Federalism: This action may have federalism implications as defined \n\nin EO 13132.\n\n Additional Information: Docket #:EPA-HQ-RCRA-2009-0640, EPA-HQ-\n\nRCRA-2011-0392. http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=EPA-HQ-\n\nRCRA-2009-0640.\n\n Sectors Affected: 221112 Fossil Fuel Electric Power Generation.\n\n URL for More Information:            http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/nonhaz/industrial/special/fossil/ccr-rule/index.htm.\n\n URL for Public Comments:            http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=EPA-HQ-RCRA-2011-0392.\n\n Agency Contact: Alexander Livnat, Environmental Protection Agency, \n\nSolid Waste and Emergency Response, 5304P, Washington, DC 20460, Phone: \n\n703 308-7251, Fax: 703 605-0595, Email: Livnat.Alexander@epa.gov\n\n Steve Souders, Environmental Protection Agency, Solid Waste and \n\nEmergency Response, 5304P, Washington, DC 20460, Phone: 703 308-8431, \n\nFax: 703 605-0595, Email: souders.steve@epa.gov\n\n RIN: 2050-AE81\n\nEPA--SWER\n\n141. Revising Underground Storage Tank Regulations--Revisions to \n\nExisting Requirements and New Requirements for Secondary Containment \n\nand Operator Training\n\n Priority: Economically Significant.

However, \n\nthere is a need to revise the regulations to incorporate changes to the \n\nUST program from the Energy Policy Act of 2005, as well as to update \n\noutdated portions of the regulations due to changes in technology since \n\nthe 1980s. On August 8, 2005, President Bush signed the Energy Policy \n\nAct of 2005 (EPAct). Title XV, Subtitle B of this act (entitled the \n\nUnderground Storage Tank Compliance Act of 2005), amends Subtitle I of \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=EPA-HQ-\nhttp://www.epa.gov/epawaste/nonhaz/industrial/special/fossil/ccr-rule/index.htm\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=EPA-HQ-RCRA-2011-0392\nmailto:Livnat.Alexander@epa.gov\nmailto:souders.steve@epa.gov\n\n\nthe Solid Waste Disposal Act, the original legislation that created the \n\nUST program. There are key provisions of the EPAct that apply to states \n\nreceiving federal UST funding but do not apply in Indian Country, \n\nincluding requirements for secondary containment and operator training. \n\nThe EPA will also use our knowledge of the program gained over the last \n\n20 years to update and revise the regulations to make targeted changes \n\nto improve implementation and prevent UST releases. In the NPRM, the \n\nEPA proposed: adding secondary containment requirements for new and \n\nreplaced tanks and piping; adding operator training requirements; \n\nadding periodic operation and maintenance requirements for UST systems; \n\nremoving certain deferrals; adding new release prevention and detection \n\ntechnologies; updating codes of practice; making editorial and \n\ntechnical corrections; and updating state program approval requirements \n\nto incorporate these new changes.\n\n Statement of Need: The Underground Storage Tank (UST) regulations \n\nwere first promulgated in 1988 primarily to prevent releases from \n\nretail petroleum marketers (gas stations) and other facilities into the \n\nenvironment. These regulations have reduced the incidents of \n\ncontamination. However, there is a need to revise the regulations to \n\nincorporate changes to the UST program from the Energy Policy Act of \n\n2005, as well as to update outdated portions of the regulations due to \n\nchanges in technology since the 1980s. On August 8, 2005, President \n\nBush signed the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct). Title XV, Subtitle B \n\nof this act (entitled the Underground Storage Tank Compliance Act of \n\n2005), amends Subtitle I of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the original \n\nlegislation that created the UST program. There are key provisions of \n\nthe EPAct that apply to states receiving federal UST funding but do not \n\napply in Indian Country, including requirements for secondary \n\ncontainment and operator training. EPA also used its knowledge of the \n\nprogram gained over the last 20 years to propose revisions to the \n\nregulations to make targeted changes to improve implementation and \n\nprevent UST releases.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The legal basis for this rulemaking comes \n\nfrom 42 U.S.C. 6912, 6991, 6991(a), 6991(b), 6991(c), 6991(d), 6991(e), \n\n6991(f), 6991(g), and 6991(h).\n\n Alternatives: Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The EPA prepared an \n\nanalysis of the potential incremental costs and benefits associated \n\nwith the revisions to the UST regulation. The RIA estimated regulatory \n\nimplementation and compliance costs, as well as benefits for the \n\nregulatory options considered. A substantial portion of the beneficial \n\nimpacts associated with the final UST regulation are avoided cleanup \n\ncosts as a result of preventing releases and reducing the severity of \n\n\n\nreleases. Due to data and resource constraints, the EPA was unable to \n\nquantify some of the final UST regulation's benefits, including \n\navoidance of human health risks, ecological benefits, and mitigation of \n\nacute exposure events and large-scale releases, such as those from \n\nairport hydrant systems and field-constructed tanks. This regulation \n\nwill increase the protection of groundwater throughout the country, but \n\nthe EPA was unable to place a value on the groundwater protected by \n\nthis UST regulation.\n\n Under the proposed rule, on an annualized basis, the estimated \n\nregulatory compliance costs are $210 million (Selected Option), $520 \n\nmillion (Option 1) and $130 million (Option 2). Separately, the \n\nproposed rule allows for annual cost savings related to avoided costs \n\nof $300-470 million (Selected Option), $310-770 million (Option 1) and \n\n$110-590 million (Option 2).\n\n Risks: There are approximately 575,000 underground storage tanks \n\n(USTs) nationwide that store petroleum or hazardous substances. The \n\ngreatest potential threat from a leaking UST is contamination of \n\ngroundwater, the source of drinking water for nearly half of all \n\nAmericans.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 11/18/11 76 FR 71708\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 02/15/12 77 FR 8757\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 02/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No\n\n Small Entities Affected: No\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, Local, State, Tribal\n\n Additional Information: Docket #:EPA-HQ-UST-2011-0301\n\n Sectors Affected: 72 Accommodation and Food Services; 481 Air \n\nTransportation; 48811 Airport Operations; 112 Animal Production; 111 \n\nCrop Production; 2211 Electric Power Generation, Transmission and \n\nDistribution; 447 Gasoline Stations; 622 Hospitals; 31-33 \n\nManufacturing; 486 Pipeline Transportation; 44-45 Retail Trade; 485 \n\nTransit and Ground Passenger Transportation; 484 Truck Transportation; \n\n483 Water Transportation; 42 Wholesale Trade\n\n URL for More Information: http://www.epa.gov/oust/fedlaws/proposedregs.html\n\n URL for Public Comments:            http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=EPA-HQ-UST-2011-0301-0001\n\nhttp://www.epa.gov/oust/fedlaws/proposedregs.html\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=EPA-HQ-UST-2011-0301-0001\n\n\n Agency Contact: Elizabeth McDermott, Environmental Protection \n\nAgency, Solid Waste and Emergency Response, 5401P, Washington, DC \n\n20460,\n\n Phone: 703 603-7175 Fax: 703 603-0175 Email: \n\nMcDermott.Elizabeth@epamail.epa.gov\n\n Paul Miller, Environmental Protection Agency, Solid Waste and \n\nEmergency Response, 5401P, Washington, DC 20460, Phone: 703 603-7165, \n\nFax: 703 603-0175, Email: Miller.Paul@epamail.epa.gov\n\n RIN: 2050-AG46\n\nEPA--WATER (WATER)\n\nFinal Rule Stage\n\n142.

Jackson, 10-1915, \n\nD. DC\n\n Abstract: The EPA establishes national technology-based \n\nregulations, called effluent limitations guidelines and standards, to \n\nreduce discharges of pollutants from industries to waters of the U.S. \n\nThese requirements are incorporated into National Pollutant Discharge \n\nElimination System (NPDES) discharge permits issued by the EPA and \n\nstates and through the national pretreatment program. The steam \n\nelectric effluent limitations guidelines and standards apply to steam \n\nelectric power plants using nuclear or fossil fuels, such as coal, oil \n\nand natural gas. There are about 1,200 nuclear- and fossil-fueled steam \n\nelectric power plants nationwide; approximately 500 of these power \n\nplants are coal-fired. In a study completed in 2009, EPA found that the \n\ncurrent regulations, which were last updated in 1982, do not adequately \n\naddress the pollutants being discharged and have not kept pace with \n\nchanges that have occurred in the electric power industry over the last \n\nthree decades. The rulemaking may address discharges associated with \n\nmailto:McDermott.Elizabeth@epamail.epa.gov\nmailto:Miller.Paul@epamail.epa.gov\n\n\ncoal ash waste and flue gas desulfurization (FGD) air pollution \n\ncontrols, as well as other power plant waste streams. Power plant \n\ndischarges can have major impacts on water quality, including reduced \n\norganism abundance and species diversity, contamination of drinking \n\nwater sources, and contamination of fish. Pollutants of concern include \n\nmetals (e.g., mercury, arsenic and selenium), nutrients, and total \n\ndissolved solids. The proposed rule was published in the Federal \n\nRegister on June 7, 2013 (``Effluent Limitations Guidelines and \n\nStandards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source \n\nCategory, '' 78 FR 34431).\n\n Statement of Need: Steam electric power plants contribute over half \n\nof all toxic pollutants discharged to surface waters by all industrial \n\ncategories currently regulated in the United States under the Clean \n\nWater Act. For example, steam electric plants annually discharge: \n\n64,400 lb. of lead [Auml]2,820 lb. of mercury \n\n[Auml]79,200 lb. of arsenic [Auml]225,000 lb. of \n\nselenium [Auml] 1,970,000 lb. of aluminum \n\n[Auml]4,990,000 lb. of zinc [Auml]30,000,000 lb. of \n\nnitrogen [Auml]682,000 lb. of phosphorus 14,500,000 lb. of \n\nmanganese [Auml]158,000 lb. of vanadium; and [Auml]27 \n\nother pollutants. Discharges of these toxic pollutants are linked to \n\ncancer, neurological damage, and ecological damage. Many of these toxic \n\npollutants, once in the environment, remain there for years. These \n\npollutant discharges contribute to: over 160 water bodies not meeting \n\nState quality standards [Auml]185 waters for which there are \n\nfish consumption advisories; and [Auml]degradation of 399 water \n\nbodies across the country that are drinking water supplies. The revised \n\nsteam electric rule would strengthen the existing controls on \n\ndischarges from these plants. It would set the first Federal limits on \n\nthe levels of toxic metals in wastewater that can be discharged from \n\npower plants, based on technology improvements in the industry over the \n\nlast three decades.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: Section 301(b)(2) of the Clean Water Act \n\n(``CWA'') requires the EPA to promulgate effluent limitations for \n\ncategories of point sources, using technology-based standards that \n\ngovern the sources' discharge of certain pollutants. 33 U.S.C. \n\n1311(b)(2). Section 304(b) directs the EPA to develop effluent \n\nguidelines that identify certain technologies and control measures \n\navailable to achieve effluent reductions for each point source \n\ncategory, specifying factors to be taken into account in identifying \n\nthose technologies and control measures. 33 U.S.C. 1314(b). Since the \n\n1970s, the EPA has formulated effluent limitations and effluent \n\n\n\nguidelines in tandem through a single administrative process. Am. \n\nFrozen Food Inst. v. Train, 539 F.2d 107 (D.C. Cir. 1976). For new \n\nsources, the CWA authorizes the EPA to set Standards of Performance for \n\ncategories of sources. 33 U.S.C. 1316. For new and existing facilities \n\nthat introduce pollutants into Publicly Owned Treatment Works, the EPA \n\npromulgates pretreatment standards. 33 U.S.C. 1317(b), (c). Together, \n\neffluent limitations guidelines, standards of performance, and \n\npretreatment standards are called ``Effluent Limitations Guidelines and \n\nStandards,'' or ``ELGs.'' The CWA also requires the EPA to perform an \n\nannual review of existing effluent guidelines and to revise them, if \n\nappropriate. 33 U.S.C. 1314(b); see also 33 U.S.C. 1314(m)(1)(A). The \n\nEPA originally established effluent limitations guidelines and \n\nstandards for the steam electric generating point source category in \n\n1974 and last updated them in 1982. 47 FR 52,290 (Nov. 19, 1982). As \n\ndescribed above, the EPA determined the existing regulations do not \n\nadequately address the pollutants being discharged and that revisions \n\nare appropriate.\n\n Alternatives: This analysis will cover various sizes and types of \n\npotentially regulated pollutant discharges and associated control \n\ntechnologies. For example, the proposal identified four preferred \n\nregulatory options that differ in the number of waste streams covered, \n\nsize of the units controlled, and stringency of controls.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The EPA's proposed revisions to the \n\nsteam electric rule identified a range of preferred regulatory options. \n\nThe EPA's estimates of the annual social costs of the steam electric \n\nrule range from $185 million to $954 million with associated annual \n\npollutant discharge reductions of 470 million to 2.62 billion pounds \n\nand water use reductions of 50 billion to 103 billion gallons. The \n\nEPA's estimate of the monetized benefits, which only includes a portion \n\nof the benefits, range from $139 million to $483 million. The range \n\nreflects that different regulatory options would control different \n\nwastestreams and provide different stringency of controls.\n\n Risks: Effluent limitations guidelines and standards are technology \n\nbased discharge requirements. As such, EPA has not assessed risk \n\nassociated with this action. However, as detailed in the Statement of \n\nNeed, toxic pollutant discharges from steam electric plants are linked \n\nto cancer, neurological damage, and ecological damage.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nNPRM................................ 06/07/13 78 FR 34431\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 07/12/13 78 FR 41907\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 09/00/15\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Local, State.\n\n Federalism: This action may have federalism implications as defined \n\nin EO 13132.\n\n Additional Information: Docket #:EPA-HQ-OW-2009-0819.\n\n Sectors Affected: 22111 Electric Power Generation; 221112 Fossil \n\nFuel Electric Power Generation; 221113 Nuclear Electric Power \n\nGeneration.\n\n URL for More Information: http://water.epa.gov/scitech/wastetech/guide/steam_index.cfm.\n\n Agency Contact: Ronald Jordan, Environmental Protection Agency, \n\nWater, Mail Code 4303T,1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Washington, DC \n\n20460, Phone: 202 566-1003, Fax: 202 566-1053, Email: \n\njordan.ronald@epamail.epa.gov\n\n Jezebele Alicea, Environmental Protection Agency, Water, Mail Code\n\n[[Page 76638]]\n\n4303T, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20460, Phone: 202 \n\n566-1755, Fax: 202 566-1053, Email: alicea.jezebele@epamail.epa.gov\n\n RIN: 2040-AF14\n\nEPA--WATER\n\n143.

These revisions will allow the EPA, states and \n\nauthorized tribes to better achieve program goals by providing clearer \n\nmore streamlined requirements to facilitate enhanced water resource \n\nprotection.\n\n Statement of Need: The core requirements of the current WQS \n\nregulation have been in place for over 30 years. These requirements \n\nhave provided a strong foundation for water quality-based controls, \n\nincluding water quality assessments, impaired waters lists, and total \n\nmaximum daily loads (TMDLs) under CWA section 303(d), as well as for \n\nwater quality-based effluent limits (WQBELs) in NPDES discharge permits \n\nunder CWA section 402. As with the development and operation of any \n\nprogram, however, a number of policy and technical issues have recurred \n\nover the past 30 years in individual standards reviews, stakeholder \n\ncomments, and litigation that the EPA believes would be addressed and \n\nresolved more efficiently by clarifying, updating and revising the \n\nfederal WQS regulation to assure greater public transparency, better \n\nstakeholder information, and more effective implementation.\n\n The basic structure of the water quality standards regulation (40 \n\nCFR part 131) was last revised in November 1983. The EPA added tribal \n\nprovisions in 1991, ``Alaska rule'' provisions in 2000, and BEACH Act \n\nrule provisions in 2004. At the 15-year point (July 1998), the EPA \n\nissued a comprehensive advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) \n\nand conducted an extensive dialogue with states and the public on over \n\n130 discrete issues. The ANPRM led to some program redirections, but \n\nEPA did not revise the regulation itself at that time. The EPA has \n\nproposed targeted changes to the WQS regulation that aim to improve the \n\nregulation's effectiveness in restoring and maintaining the chemical, \n\nphysical and biological integrity of the Nation's waters, and to \n\nclarify and simplify regulatory requirements.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The CWA establishes the basis for the \n\ncurrent WQS regulation and program. Section 303(c) of the Act addresses \n\nthe development of state and authorized tribal WQS and provides for the \n\nfollowing: (1) WQS shall consist of designated uses and water quality \n\ncriteria based upon such uses; (2) States and authorized tribes shall \n\nestablish WQS considering the following possible uses for their waters-\n\npropagation of fish, shellfish and wildlife, recreational purposes, \n\npublic water supply, agricultural and industrial water supplies, \n\nnavigation, and other uses; (3) State and tribal standards must protect \n\npublic health or welfare, enhance the quality of water, and serve the \n\n\n\npurposes of the Act; (4) States and tribes must review their standards \n\nat least once every 3 years; and (5) the EPA is required to review any \n\nnew or revised state and tribal standards, and is also required to \n\npromulgate federal standards where the EPA finds that new or revised \n\nstate or tribal standards are not consistent with applicable \n\nrequirements of the Act or in situations where the Administrator \n\ndetermines that federal standards are necessary to meet the \n\nrequirements of the Act.\n\n The EPA established the core of the current WQS regulation in a \n\nfinal rule issued in 1983. This rule strengthened previous provisions \n\nthat had been in place since 1977 and moved them to a new 40 CFR part \n\n131 (54 FR 51400, November 8, 1983). The resulting regulation describes \n\nhow the WQS envisioned in the CWA are to be administered. It clarifies \n\nthe content of standards and establishes more detailed provisions for \n\nimplementing the provisions of the Act.\n\n Alternatives: In support of the 1983 regulation, the EPA has issued \n\na number of guidance documents that have provided guidance on the \n\ninterpretation and implementation of the WQS regulation, and on \n\nscientific and technical analyses that are used in making decisions \n\nthat would impact WQS. In 1998, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of \n\nProposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) to discuss and invite comment on over 130 \n\naspects of the federal WQS regulation and program, with a goal of \n\nidentifying specific changes that might strengthen water quality \n\nprotection and restoration, facilitate watershed management \n\ninitiatives, and incorporate evolving water quality criteria and \n\nassessment science into state and tribal WQS programs. (63 FR 36742, \n\nJuly 7, 1998). In response, the EPA received over 3,200 specific \n\nwritten comments from over 150 comment letters. The EPA also held three \n\npublic meetings during the 180-day comment period where additional \n\ncomments were received and discussed. Although the EPA chose not to \n\nmove forward with a rulemaking after the ANRPM, as a result of the \n\ninput received, the EPA identified a number of high priority issue \n\nareas for which the Agency has developed guidance, provided technical \n\nassistance and continued further discussion and dialogue to assure more \n\neffective program implementation. As with the development and operation \n\nof any program, however, a number of policy and technical issues have \n\nrecurred over the past 30 years that the EPA believes would be \n\naddressed and resolved more efficiently by clarifying, updating and \n\nrevising the Federal WQS regulation to assure greater public \n\ntransparency, better stakeholder information, and more effective \n\nimplementation.\n\n\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Because this proposal will not \n\nestablish any requirements directly applicable to regulated entities, \n\nthe focus of the EPA's economic analysis is to estimate the potential \n\nadministrative burden and costs to state, tribal, and territorial \n\ngovernments, and the EPA. In the proposal the EPA is considering \n\nwhether to include a requirement that antidegradation implementation \n\nmethods be formally adopted as WQS and thus subject to the EPA's review \n\nand approval or disapproval. This additional requirement would require \n\naffected entities to develop or revise antidegradation implementation \n\nmethods, and adopt the implementation methods in WQS, resulting in one-\n\ntime (nonrecurring) burden and costs. The total annual costs for this \n\nproposal with the requirement to adopt antidegradation implementation \n\nmethods as WQS is estimated to range from $5.98 million to $9.27 \n\nmillion per year. The total annual costs for this\n\n[[Page 76639]]\n\nproposal without the requirement to adopt antidegradation \n\nimplementation methods as WQS is estimated to range from $5.84 million \n\nto $9.01 million per year.\n\n States, tribes, stakeholders, and the public will benefit from the \n\nproposed clarifications of the WQS regulations by ensuring better \n\nutilization of available WQS tools that allow states and tribes the \n\nflexibility to implement their WQS in an efficient manner while \n\nproviding transparency and open public participation. Although \n\nassociated with potential administrative burden and costs in some \n\nareas, this proposal has the potential to partially offset these costs \n\nby reducing regulatory uncertainty and consequently increasing overall \n\nprogram efficiency. Furthermore, more efficient and effective \n\nimplementation of state and tribal WQS has the potential to provide a \n\nvariety of economic benefits associated with cleaner water including \n\nthe availability of clean, safe, and affordable drinking water, water \n\nof adequate quality for agricultural and industrial use, and water \n\nquality that supports the commercial fishing industry and higher \n\nproperty values. Nonmarket benefits of this proposal include the \n\nprotection and improvement of public health and greater recreational \n\nopportunities. The EPA acknowledges that achievement of any benefits \n\nassociated with cleaner water would involve additional control \n\nmeasures, and thus costs to regulated entities and non-point sources, \n\nthat have not been included in the economic analyses for this proposed \n\nrule. The EPA has not attempted to quantify either the costs of such \n\ncontrol measures that might ultimately be required as a result of this \n\n\n\nrule, or the benefits they would provide.\n\n Risks: Reducing regulatory uncertainty has the impact of increasing \n\noverall program efficiency.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotice.............................. 07/30/10 75 FR 44930\n\nNPRM................................ 09/04/13 78 FR 54517\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 11/27/13 78 FR 70905\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended End.... 01/02/14 .......................\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 05/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal, State, Tribal.\n\n Additional Information: Docket #: EPA-HQ-OW-2010-0606.\n\n URL for More Information: http://water.epa.gov/scitech/swguidance/standards/index.cfm.\n\n Agency Contact: Shari Barash, Environmental Protection Agency, \n\nWater, Mail Code 4305T, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Washington, DC \n\n20460, Phone: 202 566-0996, Fax: 202 566-1053, Email: \n\nbarash.shari@epa.gov\n\n Janita Aguirre, Environmental Protection Agency, Water, Mail Code \n\n4305T, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20460, Phone: 202 \n\n566-1149 Fax: 202 566-0409 Email: aguirre.janita@epa.gov\n\n RIN: 2040-AF16\n\nEPA--WATER\n\n144.

The Act has a \n\nsingle definition for ``waters of the United States.'' As a result, \n\nhttp://water.epa.gov/scitech/swguidance/standards/index.cfm\nmailto:barash.shari@epa.gov\nmailto:aguirre.janita@epa.gov\n\n\nthese decisions affect the geographic scope of all CWA programs. SWANCC \n\nand Rapanos did not invalidate the current regulatory definition of \n\n``waters of the United States.'' However, the decisions established \n\nimportant considerations for how those regulations should be \n\ninterpreted, and experience implementing the regulations has identified \n\nseveral areas that could benefit from additional clarification through \n\nrulemaking. U.S. EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed a \n\nrule for determining whether a water is protected by the Clean Water \n\nAct. This rule will make clear which waterbodies are protected under \n\nthe Clean Water Act.\n\n Statement of Need: After U.S. Supreme Court decisions in SWANCC \n\n(Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of \n\nEngineers, 531 U.S. 159 (2001)) and Rapanos (Rapanos v. United States , \n\n547 U.S. 715 (2006)), the scope of waters of the US protected under all \n\nCWA programs has been an issue of considerable debate and uncertainty. \n\nThe Act has a single definition for waters of the United States. As a \n\nresult, these decisions affect the geographic scope of all CWA \n\nprograms. SWANCC and Rapanos did not invalidate the current regulatory \n\ndefinition of waters of the United States. However, the decisions \n\nestablished important considerations for how those regulations should \n\nbe interpreted, and experience implementing the regulations has \n\nidentified several areas that could benefit from additional \n\nclarification through rulemaking. EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of \n\nEngineers are developing a proposed rule for determining whether a \n\nwater is protected by the Clean Water Act. This rule would clarify \n\nwhich water bodies are protected under the Clean Water Act.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of \n\nEngineers (Corps) publish for public comment a proposed rule defining \n\nthe scope of waters protected under the CWA, in light of the U.S. \n\nSupreme Court cases in U.S. v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Solid Waste \n\nAgency of Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \n\n(SWANCC), and Rapanos v. United States (Rapanos). The goal of the \n\nagencies is to ensure the regulatory definition is consistent with the \n\nCWA, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, and as supported by science, \n\nand to provide maximum clarity to the public, as the agencies work to \n\nfulfill the CWA's objectives and policy to protect water quality, \n\npublic health, and the environment.\n\n Alternatives: The agencies solicited comment on a number of issues \n\nthroughout the proposed rule preamble. In particular, the agencies \n\nrequested comment on alternate approaches to determining whether \n\n\n\n``other waters'' are similarly situated and have a ``significant \n\nnexus'' to a traditional navigable water, interstate water, or the \n\nterritorial seas. Just as the agencies are seeking comment on a variety \n\nof approaches, or combination of approaches, as to which waters are \n\njurisdictional, the agencies also request comment on determining which \n\nwaters should be determined non-jurisdictional. In addition, the \n\nagencies are seeking comment on alternate approaches to define \n\n``neighboring.''\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The EPA and the Corps of Engineers \n\nprepared an analysis of the potential costs and benefits associated \n\nwith this action. The definition of ``waters of the U.S.,'' by itself, \n\nimposes no direct costs. The potential costs and benefits incurred as a \n\nresult of this proposed action are considered indirect because the \n\naction involves a definitional change to a term that is used in the\n\n[[Page 76640]]\n\nimplementation of a variety of CWA programs. Each of these programs may \n\nsubsequently impose direct or indirect costs as a result of \n\nimplementation of their specific regulations. The proposed rule would \n\nprovide an estimated $388 million to $514 million annually of benefits \n\nto the public, including reducing flooding, filtering pollution, \n\nproviding wildlife habitat, supporting hunting and fishing, and \n\nrecharging groundwater. The public benefits outweigh the costs of about \n\n$162 million to $278 million per year for mitigating impacts to streams \n\nand wetlands, and taking steps to reduce pollution to waterways.\n\n Risks: This proposal would enhance protection for the nation's \n\npublic health and aquatic resources, and increase CWA program \n\npredictability and consistency by increasing clarity as to the scope of \n\n``waters of the United States'' protected under the Act.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 04/21/14 79 FR 22187\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended........ 06/24/14 79 FR 35712\n\nNPRM Comment Period End............. 07/21/14 .......................\n\nNPRM Comment Period Extended End.... 10/21/14 .......................\n\nFinal Rule.......................... 04/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: None.\n\n URL For More Information: http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/guidance/wetlands/CWAwaters.cfm.\n\n Agency Contact: Donna Downing, Environmental Protection Agency, \n\nWater, 4502T, Washington, DC 20460, Phone: 202 566-2428, Email: \n\ncwawaters@epa.gov\n\n Rose Kwok, Environmental Protection Agency, Water, 1200 \n\nPennsylvania Ave NW., Mail Code 4502T, Washington, DC 20460, Phone: 202 \n\n566-0657, Email: cwawaters@epa.gov\n\n RIN: 2040-AF30\n\nBILLING CODE 6560-50-P\n\nEQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION (EEOC)\n\nStatement of Regulatory and Deregulatory Priorities\n\n The mission of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC, \n\nCommission, or Agency) is to ensure equality of opportunity in \n\nemployment by vigorously enforcing and educating the public about the \n\nfollowing Federal statutes: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \n\nas amended (prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of race, \n\ncolor, sex (including pregnancy), religion, or national origin); the \n\nEqual Pay Act of 1963, as amended (makes it illegal to pay unequal \n\nwages to men and women performing substantially equal work under \n\nsimilar working conditions at the same establishment); the Age \n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended (prohibits \n\nemployment discrimination based on age of 40 or older); Titles I and V \n\nof the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended, and sections 501 \n\nand 505 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended (prohibit employment \n\ndiscrimination based on disability); Title II of the Genetic \n\nInformation Nondiscrimination Act (prohibits employment discrimination \n\nbased on genetic information and limits acquisition and disclosure of \n\ngenetic information); and section 304 of the Government Employee Rights \n\nAct of 1991 (protects certain previously exempt state & local \n\ngovernment employees from employment discrimination on the basis of \n\nrace, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability).\n\n The first item in this Regulatory Plan is entitled ``The Federal \n\nSector's Obligation To Be a Model Employer of Individuals with \n\nDisabilities.'' The EEOC's regulations implementing section 501, as set \n\nforth in 29 CFR part 1614, require Federal agencies and departments to \n\nbe ``model employers'' of individuals with disabilities. The Commission \n\nissued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) on May 15, \n\n2014, (79 FR 27824), and intends to issue a proposed rule to revise the \n\nhttp://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/guidance/wetlands/CWAwaters.cfm\nmailto:cwawaters@epa.gov\nmailto:cwawaters@epa.gov\n\n\nregulations regarding the Federal government's affirmative employment \n\nobligations in 29 CFR part 1614 to include a more detailed explanation \n\nof how Federal agencies and departments should ``give full \n\nconsideration to the hiring, placement, and advancement of qualified \n\nindividuals with disabilities.'' Any revisions would be informed by \n\nManagement Directive 715, and may include goals consistent with \n\nExecutive Order 13548. Furthermore, any revisions would result in costs \n\nonly to the Federal Government; would contribute to increasing the \n\nemployment of individuals with disabilities; and would not affect risks \n\nto public health, safety, or the environment.\n\n The second item is entitled ``Federal Sector Equal Employment \n\nOpportunity Process.'' In July 2012, the Commission published a final \n\nrule containing fifteen discrete changes to various parts of the \n\nFederal sector EEO process, and indicated that the rule was the \n\nCommission's initial step in a broader review of the Federal sector EEO \n\nprocess. The Commission intends to develop an ANPRM which would seek \n\npublic input on additional issues associated with the Federal sector \n\nEEO process.\n\n The third item is entitled ``Amendments to Regulations Under the \n\nAmericans With Disabilities Act.'' This proposed rule would amend the \n\nregulations to implement the equal employment provisions of the \n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to address the interaction \n\nbetween title I of the ADA and financial inducements and/or penalties \n\nas part of wellness programs offered through health plans. EEOC also \n\nplans to address other aspects of wellness programs that may be subject \n\nto the ADA's nondiscrimination provisions in this NPRM.\n\n The fourth item is entitled ``Amendments to Regulations Under the \n\nGenetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008.'' This proposed rule \n\nwould amend the regulations on the Genetic Information \n\nNondiscrimination Act of 2008 to address inducements to employees' \n\nspouses or other family members who respond to questions about their \n\ncurrent or past medical conditions on health risk assessments. This \n\nNPRM will also correct a typographical error in the rule's discussion \n\nof wellness programs and add references to the Affordable Care Act, \n\nwhere appropriate.\n\n Consistent with section 4(c) of Executive Order 12866, this \n\nstatement was reviewed and approved by the Chair of the Agency. The \n\nstatement has not been reviewed or approved by the other members of the \n\nCommission.\n\n\n\nRetrospective Review of Existing Regulations\n\n Pursuant to section 6 of Executive Order 13563, ``Improving \n\nRegulation and Regulatory Review'' (Jan. 18, 2011), the following \n\nRegulatory Identifier Numbers (RINs) have been identified as associated \n\nwith retrospective review and analysis in the EEOC's final \n\nretrospective review of regulations plan.

Executive \n\nOrder 13548 called for increased efforts by Federal agencies and \n\ndepartments to recruit, hire, retain, and return individuals with \n\ndisabilities to the Federal workforce.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis:\n\n[[Page 76642]]\n\n Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (section \n\n501), 29 U.S.C. 791, in addition to requiring nondiscrimination with \n\nrespect to Federal employees and applicants for Federal employment who \n\nare individuals with disabilities, also requires Federal agencies to \n\nmaintain, update annually, and submit to the Commission an affirmative \n\naction program plan for the hiring, placement, and advancement of \n\n\n\nindividuals with disabilities. As part of its responsibility for the \n\nadministration and enforcement of equal opportunity in Federal \n\nemployment, the Commission is authorized under 29 U.S.C. 794a(a)(1) to \n\nissue rules, regulations, orders, and instructions pursuant to section \n\n501.\n\n Alternatives: The EEOC considered all alternatives offered by ANPRM \n\npublic commenters. The EEOC will consider all alternatives offered by \n\nfuture public commenters.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Any costs that might result would \n\nonly be borne by the Federal Government. The revisions would contribute \n\nto increased employment of individuals with disabilities.\n\n Risks: The proposed changes do not affect risks to public health, \n\nsafety, or the environment.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nANPRM............................... 05/15/14 79 FR 27824\n\nANPRM Comment Period End............ 07/14/14\n\nNPRM................................ 01/00/15\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: No.\n\n Small Entities Affected: No.\n\n Government Levels Affected: Federal.\n\n Agency Contact: Christopher Kuczynski, Assistant Legal Counsel, \n\nOffice of Legal Counsel, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 131 M \n\nStreet NE., Washington, DC 20507, Phone: 202 663-4665, TDD Phone: 202 \n\n663-7026, Fax: 202 653-6034, Email: christopher.kuczynski@eeoc.gov\n\n Aaron Konopasky, Senior Attorney Advisor, Office of Legal Counsel, \n\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission, 131 M Street NE., Washington, \n\nDC 20507, Phone: 202 663-4127, Fax: 202 653-6034, Email: \n\naaron.konopasky@eeoc.gov\n\n Related RIN: Related to 3046-AA73\n\n RIN: 3046-AA94\n\nEEOC\n\n147.

EEOC also plans to address other \n\naspects of wellness programs that may be subject to the ADA's \n\nnondiscrimination provisions in this NPRM.\n\n Statement of Need: The revision to 29 CFR 1630.14(d) is needed to \n\naddress numerous inquiries EEOC has received about whether an employer \n\nthat complies with regulations implementing the final Health Insurance \n\nPortability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) rules concerning wellness \n\nprogram incentives, as amended by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), will \n\nbe in compliance with the ADA.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The ADA requires the EEOC to issue \n\nregulations implementing title I of the Act. The EEOC initially issued \n\nregulations in 1991 on the law's requirements and prohibited practices \n\nwith respect to employment and issued amended regulations in 2011 to \n\nconform to changes to the ADA made by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008. \n\nThese proposed revisions are based on that statutory requirement.\n\n Alternatives: The EEOC will consider all alternatives offered by \n\npublic commenters.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: Based on the information currently \n\navailable, the Commission does not anticipate that the rule will impose \n\nadditional costs on employers, beyond minimal costs to train human \n\nresource professionals. The regulation does not impose any new employer \n\nreporting or recordkeeping obligations. We anticipate that the changes \n\nwill benefit entities covered by title I of the ADA by generally \n\npromoting consistency between the ADA and HIPAA, as amended by the ACA, \n\nand result in greater predictability and ease of administration.\n\n Risks: The proposed rule imposes no new or additional risks to \n\nemployers.

This NPRM will also correct a typographical error in \n\nthe rule's discussion of wellness programs and add references to the \n\nAffordable Care Act, where appropriate.\n\n Statement of Need: The revision to 29 CFR 1635.8 is needed to \n\naddress numerous inquiries received by EEOC about whether an employer \n\nwill violate the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 by \n\noffering an employee a financial inducement if the employee's family \n\nmember completes an HRA that asks about the family member's current \n\nhealth status.

Mission and Overview\n\n GSA oversees the business of the Federal Government. The \n\nmailto:christopher.kuczynski@eeoc.gov\nmailto:kerry.leibig@eeoc.gov\n\n\nacquisition solutions GSA implements provides Federal purchasers with \n\ncost-effective, high-quality products and services from commercial \n\nvendors, while helping to keep the Nation safe by providing tools, \n\nequipment, and non-tactical vehicles to the U.S. military, and \n\nproviding State and local governments with law enforcement equipment, \n\nfirefighting and rescue equipment, and disaster recovery products and \n\nservices. We provide workplaces for Federal employees and oversee the \n\npreservation of historic Federal properties.\n\n Our Agency serves the public by delivering services directly to its \n\nFederal customers through the Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), the \n\nPublic Buildings Service (PBS), and the Office of Government-wide \n\nPolicy (OGP). With a continuing commitment to its Federal customers and \n\nthe U.S. taxpayers, GSA provides its services in the most cost-\n\neffective manner possible.\n\nFederal Acquisition Service (FAS)\n\n FAS is the lead organization for procurement of products and \n\nservices (other than real property) for the Federal Government. The FAS \n\norganization leverages the buying power of the Government by \n\nconsolidating Federal agencies' requirements for common goods and \n\nservices. FAS provides a range of high-quality and flexible acquisition \n\nservices that increase overall Government effectiveness and efficiency. \n\nFAS business operations are organized into four business portfolios \n\nbased on the product or service provided to customer agencies: \n\nIntegrated Technology Services (ITS); Assisted Acquisition Services \n\n(AAS); General Supplies and Services (GSS); and Travel, Motor Vehicles, \n\nand Card Services (TMVCS). The FAS portfolio structure enables GSA and \n\nFAS to provide best value services, products, and solutions to its \n\ncustomers by aligning resources around key functions.\n\nPublic Buildings Service (PBS)\n\n PBS is the largest public real estate organization in the United \n\nStates, providing facilities and workspace solutions to more than 60 \n\nFederal agencies. PBS aims to provide a superior workplace for the \n\nFederal worker and superior value for the U.S. taxpayer. Balancing \n\nthese two objectives is PBS' greatest management challenge. PBS' \n\nactivities fall into two broad areas. The first is space acquisition \n\nthrough both leases and construction. PBS translates general needs into \n\nspecific requirements, marshals the necessary resources, and delivers \n\n\n\nthe space necessary to meet the respective missions of its Federal \n\nclients. The second area is management of space. This involves making \n\ndecisions on maintenance, servicing tenants, and ultimately, deciding \n\nwhen and how to dispose of a property at the end of its useful life.\n\nOffice of Government-Wide Policy (OGP)\n\n OGP sets Government-wide policy in the areas of personal and real \n\nproperty, travel and transportation, information technology, regulatory \n\ninformation, and use of Federal advisory committees. OGP also helps \n\ndirect how all Federal supplies and services are acquired as well as \n\nGSA's own acquisition programs. OGP's regulatory function fully \n\nincorporates the provisions of the President's priorities and \n\nobjectives under Executive Order 12866 and 13563 with policies covering \n\nacquisition, travel, and property and management practices to promote \n\nefficient Government operations. OGP's strategic direction is to ensure \n\nthat Government-wide policies encourage agencies to develop and utilize \n\nthe best, most cost effective management practices for the conduct of \n\ntheir specific programs. To reach the goal of improving Government-wide \n\nmanagement of property, technology, and administrative services, OGP \n\nbuilds and maintains a policy framework by (1) incorporating the \n\nrequirements of Federal laws, Executive orders, and other regulatory \n\nmaterial into policies and guidelines; (2) facilitating Government-wide \n\nreform to provide Federal managers with business-like incentives and \n\ntools and flexibility to prudently manage their assets; (3) \n\nidentifying, evaluating, and promoting best practices to improve \n\nefficiency of management processes; and (4) performing ongoing analysis \n\nof existing rules that may be obsolete, unnecessary, unjustified, \n\nexcessively burdensome, or counterproductive.\n\n OGP's policy regulations are described in the following \n\nsubsections:\n\nOffice of Asset and Transportation Management (Federal Travel \n\nRegulation)\n\n Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) enumerates the travel and \n\nrelocation policy for all title 5 Executive agency employees. The Code \n\nof Federal Regulations (CFR) is available at www.gpoaccess.gov/cfr. \n\nEach version is updated as official changes are published in the \n\nFederal Register (FR). FR publications and complete versions of the FTR \n\nare available at            www.gsa.gov/ftr.\n\n The FTR is the regulation contained in 41 Code of Federal \n\nRegulations (CFR), chapters 300 through 304, that implements statutory \n\nhttp://www.gpoaccess.gov/cfr\nhttp://www.gsa.gov/ftr\n\n\nrequirements and\n\n[[Page 76644]]\n\nexecutive branch policies for travel by Federal civilian employees and \n\nothers authorized to travel at Government expense.\n\n The Administrator of General Services promulgates the FTR to: (a) \n\nInterpret statutory and other policy requirements in a manner that \n\nbalances the need to ensure that official travel is conducted in a \n\nresponsible manner with the need to minimize administrative costs and \n\n(b) communicate the resulting policies in a clear manner to Federal \n\nagencies and employees.\n\nOffice of Asset and Transportation Management (Federal Management \n\nRegulation)\n\n Federal Management Regulation (FMR) establishes policy for \n\naircraft, transportation, personal property, real property, and mail \n\nmanagement. The FMR is the successor regulation to the Federal Property \n\nManagement Regulation (FPMR), and it contains updated regulatory \n\npolicies originally found in the FPMR. However, it does not contain \n\nFPMR material that describes how to do business with the GSA.\n\nOffice of Acquisition Policy (General Services Administration \n\nAcquisition Manual (GSAM) and the General Services Administration \n\nAcquisition Regulation (GSAR))\n\n GSA's internal rules and practices on how it buys goods and \n\nservices from its business partners are covered by the General Services \n\nAdministration Acquisition Manual (GSAM), which implements and \n\nsupplement the Federal Acquisition Regulation at GSA. The GSAM \n\ncomprises both a non-regulatory portion (GSAM), which reflects policies \n\nwith no external impact, and a regulatory portion, the General Services \n\nAdministration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR). The GSAR establishes \n\nagency acquisition regulations that affect GSA's business partners \n\n(e.g. prospective offerors and contractors) and acquisition of \n\nleasehold interests in real property. The latter are established under \n\nthe authority of 40 U.S.C. 490. The GSAR implements contract clauses, \n\nsolicitation provisions, and forms that control the relationship \n\nbetween GSA and contractors and prospective contractors.\n\nII. Statement of Regulatory and Deregulatory Priorities\n\nFTR Regulatory Priorities\n\n In fiscal year 2014, GSA plans to amend the FTR by:\n\n Revising Chapter 301, Temporary Duty Travel, ensuring \n\naccountability and transparency. This revision will ensure agencies' \n\n\n\ntravel for missions is efficient and effective, reduces costs, promotes \n\nsustainability, and incorporates industry best practices at the lowest \n\nlogical travel cost.\n\n Revising Chapter 302, Relocation Allowances for \n\nmiscellaneous items to address current Government relocation needs \n\nwhich the last major rewrite (FTR Amendment 2011-01) did not update. \n\nThis will include revising the Relocation Income Tax (RIT) Allowance; \n\namending coverage on family relocation; and amending the calculations \n\nregarding the commuted rate for employee-managed household goods \n\nshipments.\n\nFMR Regulatory Priorities\n\n In fiscal year 2014, GSA plans to amend the FMR by:\n\n Revising rules regarding management of Government \n\naircraft;\n\n Revising rules regarding management of Federal real \n\nproperty;\n\n Revising rules regarding management of Federal personal \n\nproperty.\n\nGSAR Regulatory Priorities\n\n GSA plans, to update the GSAR to maintain consistency with the \n\nFederal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and to implement streamlined and \n\ninnovative acquisition procedures that contractors, offerors, and GSA \n\ncontracting personnel can utilize when entering into and administering \n\ncontractual relationships. Currently, GSA is focusing on clarifying the \n\nGSAR by--\n\n Providing consistency with the FAR;\n\n Eliminating coverage that duplicates the FAR or creates \n\ninconsistencies within the GSAR;\n\n Correcting inappropriate references listed to indicate the \n\nbasis for the regulation;\n\n Rewriting sections that have become irrelevant because of \n\nchanges in technology or business processes or that place unnecessary \n\nadministrative burdens on contractors and the Government;\n\n Streamlining or simplifying the regulation;\n\n Rolling up coverage from the services and regions/zones \n\nthat should be in the GSAR;\n\n Providing new and/or augmented coverage; and\n\n Deleting unnecessary burdens on small businesses.\n\nRegulations of Concern to Small Businesses\n\n FAR and GSAR rules are relevant to small businesses who do or wish \n\n\n\nto do business with the Federal Government. Approximately 18,000 \n\nbusinesses, most of whom are small, have GSA schedule contracts. GSA \n\nassists its small businesses by providing assistance through its Office \n\nof Small Business Utilization. In addition, GSA extensively utilizes \n\nits regional resources, within FAS and PBS, to provide grassroots \n\noutreach to small business concerns, through hosting such outreach \n\nevents, or participating in a vast array of other similar presentations \n\nhosted by others.\n\nRegulations Which Promote Open Government and Disclosure\n\n RIN 3090-AJ30; Federal Management Regulation (FMR); FMR Case 2012-\n\n102-4, Disposal and Reporting of Federal Electronic Assets (FEA):\n\n The GSA is considering comments received during the publication of \n\nthe Proposed Rule FMR 102-36 in developing its Final Rule. As \n\nenvisioned, this policy directs agencies to dispose of non-functional \n\nelectronics through more sustainable means, and will require \n\npublication of agency disposal data on www.data.gov for public viewing \n\ninto Federal activities.\n\nIII. Retrospective Review of Existing Regulations\n\n Pursuant to section 6 of Executive Order 13563 ``Improving \n\nRegulation and Regulatory Review'' (July, 2013), the GSA retrospective \n\nreview and analysis final and updated regulations plan can be found at \n\nwww.gsa.gov/improvingregulations.

There are no \n\nrulemakings that are expected to have high net benefits. All of the \n\nAgency's rulemaking promotes open government as the public is given an \n\nopportunity to review and comment on these rulemakings prior to \n\npromulgation. The Agency has no rulemakings that reduce unjustified \n\nburdens with no particular concern to small businesses, and there are \n\nno significant international impacts.\n\n NASA continues to implement programs according to its 2014 \n\nStrategic Plan. NASA's mission is to ``Drive advances in science, \n\ntechnology, aeronautics, and space exploration to enhance knowledge, \n\neducation, innovation, economic vitality, and stewardship of the \n\nEarth.'' The FY 2014 Strategic Plan, (available at \nhttp://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/2014_NASA_Strategic_Plan.pdf), guides NASA's \n\nprogram activities through a framework of the following three strategic \n\ngoals:\n\n Strategic Goal 1: Expand the frontiers of knowledge, \n\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/2014_NASA_Strategic_Plan.pdf\n\n\ncapability, and opportunity in space.\n\n Strategic Goal 2: Advance understanding of Earth and \n\ndevelop technologies to improve the quality of life on our home planet.\n\n Strategic Goal 3: Serve the American public and accomplish \n\nour mission by effectively managing our people, technical capabilities, \n\nand infrastructure.\n\n In the decades since Congress enacted the National Aeronautics and \n\nSpace Act of 1958, NASA has challenged its scientific and engineering \n\ncapabilities in pursuing its mission, generating tremendous results and \n\nbenefits for humankind. NASA will continue to push scientific and \n\ntechnical boundaries in pursuit of these goals.\n\n The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 CFR chapter 1, \n\ncontains procurement regulations that apply to NASA and other Federal \n\nagencies. NASA implements and supplements FAR requirements through the \n\nNASA FAR Supplement (NFS), 48 CFR chapter 18. NASA is in the process of \n\nreviewing and updating the entire NFS with a projected completion date \n\nof December 2015. Concurrently, NASA will continue to make routine \n\nchanges to the NFS to implement NASA initiatives and Federal \n\nprocurement policy.\n\nRetrospective Review of Existing Regulations\n\n Pursuant to section 6 of Executive Order 13579 ``Regulation and \n\nIndependent Regulatory Agencies'' (Jul. 11, 2011), NASA regulations \n\nassociated with its retrospective review and analysis are described in \n\nthe Agency's final retrospective plan of existing regulations. Nineteen \n\nof these regulations were completed and are described below. NASA's \n\nfinal plan and\n\n[[Page 76646]]\n\nupdates can be found at http://www.nasa.gov/open, under the Compliance \n\nDocuments Section.\n\nRulemaking That Was Streamlined and Reduced Unjustified Burdens\n\n 1. Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the \n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration [5 CFR 6901]--NASA, with \n\nthe concurrence of the Office of Government Ethics, amended its \n\nSupplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the National \n\nAeronautics and Space Administration that permits student interns to \n\nseek prior approval to engage in outside employees with a NASA \n\nContractor, subcontractor, grantee, or party to a NASA agreement in \n\nconnect with work performed by that entity or under that agreement. The \n\namendments clarified the types of outside employment activities that \n\nrequire approval, streamlined the process for approval, eliminated \n\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/open\n\n\nobsolete position titles, and extended the permissible time period of \n\napproval. The revision to NASA's supplemental outside activity \n\nregulation liberalizes a general restriction prohibiting NASA employees \n\nfrom outside jobs performing work under NASA's contracts, grants and \n\nother agreements to allow student interns to do so if the work complies \n\nwith Federal ethics laws and U.S. Office of Government Ethics \n\nregulations. This modification helps insure that students in STEM \n\n(science, technology, engineering, and math) disciplines have full \n\naccess to NASA development opportunities to maintain U.S. leadership in \n\nthese fields. The revision also narrows the scope of employee-owned \n\nbusinesses that NASA personnel must obtain prior agency approval to \n\nundertake to those that will perform or seek to perform Federal \n\ngovernment-related work. This change enhances workforce development by \n\nreducing burdens associated with pursuing outside activities that may \n\nhelp NASA employees develop new skills. Finally, the revision \n\ndecentralizes and streamlines the approval process [79 FR 49225].\n\nRulemakings That Were Modified, Streamlined, Expanded, or Repealed\n\n 2. Removal of Obsolete Regulations: Space Flight Mission Critical \n\nSystems Personnel Reliability Program [14 CFR 1204]--NASA amended is \n\nregulations to make nonsubstantive changes by removing a regulation \n\nthat was obsolete and no longer used [79 FR 7391].\n\n 3. Removal of Redundant Regulatory Text [14 CFR parts 1204, 1230, \n\nand 1232]--NASA amended its regulations to make nonsubstantive changes \n\nby removing redundant regulatory language that is already captured in \n\nstatutes that govern NASA activities related to delegation of authority \n\nof certain civil rights functions, protection of human subjects, and \n\ncare and use of animals in the conduct of NASA activities [78 FR \n\n76057].\n\n 4. Removal of Obsolete Regulation: Use of Centennial of Flight \n\nCommission Name [14 CFR 1204.506]--NASA amended its regulations to make \n\nnonsubstantive changes to remove a regulation that is obsolete and no \n\nlonger used [77 FR 60619].\n\nRulemaking That Promotes Open Government and Uses Disclosure as a \n\nRegulatory Tool\n\n 5. Procedures for Disclosure of Records Freedom of Information Act \n\nRegulations [14 CFR 1206]--NASA revised its Freedom of Information Act \n\n(FOIA) regulations to clarify and update procedures for requesting \n\ninformation from the Agency, as well as procedures that the Agency \n\nfollows in responding to requests from the public. These revisions also \n\nincorporate clarifications and update results from changes to the FOIA \n\nand case law, as well as include current cost figures to be used in \n\n\n\ncalculating and charging fees and increase the amount of information \n\nthat members of the public may receive from the Agency without being \n\ncharged processing fees. This rule is a `how to' guide for submitting \n\nrequests for Agency records, if these records are not currently on a \n\npublic-facing Web site. The rule, which comports with the law, is an \n\ninformation access tool for disclosure of Agency records. Providing \n\naccess details to the public through the FOIA rule is an effective \n\nmeans to promote open government and ensure the public has the \n\nknowledge of how to submit a request for Agency documents and what to \n\nexpect once that request is received by the Agency [79 FR 46676].\n\nRulemakings That Are of Particular Concerns to Small Business\n\n 6. Small Business Policy [14 CFR 1204]--NASA amended its \n\nregulations to make nonsubstantive changes to update offices names and \n\ntitles, described the role of the Small Business Technical Advisor, add \n\nmore small business categories to include small disadvantaged business \n\nHUBZone small business, women-owned small business concerns, veteran-\n\nowned small business, and service-and disabled veteran-owned small \n\nbusiness in accordance with and required by the Small Business Act (15 \n\nU.S.C. 631). NASA certifies that this rule is not subject to the \n\nRegulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601), because it would not have a \n\nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses \n\n[78 FR 77352].\n\n 7. Nonprocurement Rule, Suspension, and Debarment [2 CFR 1880]--\n\nNASA has adopted as final, with no change, a proposed rule to extend \n\ncoverage of non-procurement suspension and debarment to all tiers of \n\nprocurement and non-procurement actions under all grants and \n\ncooperative agreements. NASA certifies that this rule does not have a \n\nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities \n\nwithin the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et \n\nseq. Small entities are already required to check the Excluded Parties \n\nList System (EPLS) prior to making first-tier, procurement subawards \n\nunder a grant or cooperative agreement. They will now be required to \n\nensure that none of their potential subrecipients are on the EPLS. The \n\nEPLS is an easy-to-access and easy to-use on-line resources [78 FR \n\n13211].\n\nRulemaking That Has Significant International Impacts\n\n 8. Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System [14 CFR 1215]--NASA \n\namended its regulations to make nonsubstantive changes to the policy \n\n\n\ngoverning the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) services \n\nprovided to non-U.S. Government users and the reimbursement for \n\nrendering such services. TDRSS, also known as the Space Network, \n\nprovides command, tracking, data, voice, and video services to the \n\nInternational Space Station, NASA's space and Earth science missions, \n\nand other Federal agencies, including the Department of Defense and the \n\nNational Science Foundation. For a fee, commercial users can also have \n\naccess to TDRSS for tracking and data acquisition purposes. Over the \n\nlast 25 years, TDRSS has delivered pictures, television, scientific, \n\nand voice data to the scientific community and the general public, \n\nincluding data from more than 100 Space Shuttle and International Space \n\nStation missions and the Hubble Space Telescope. A principal advantage \n\nof TDRSS is providing communications services, which previously have \n\nbeen provided by multiple worldwide ground stations, with much higher \n\ndata rates and lower latency to the user missions. The rule is designed \n\nfor NASA to sell unused TDRSS time to non-U.S. Government customers. \n\nThe main class of current users of this rule is expendable launch \n\nvehicle providers. The United Launch Alliance (Atlas and Delta \n\nrockets), SpaceX (Falcon rocket), and Sea Launch\n\n[[Page 76647]]\n\n(rocket) all use TDRSS to support their launch operations. The TDRSS \n\nallows them to receive data from their launch vehicles through most of \n\nthe critical aspects of flight (mark events such as pre-launch testing, \n\nignition, stage separations, engine start and stop, etc.). This service \n\ncould be useful to international customers such as Arianespace (for \n\ntheir Vega or Ariane 5 launches out of French Guiana) or JAXA (for \n\ntheir H-IIA rocket), which has used TDRSS in the past. They would have \n\nto have TDRSS compatible transmitters on their vehicles in order to use \n\nthe service. Low earth orbit (LEO) international customers not \n\nassociated with NASA by international agreement would find it difficult \n\nto book unused TDRSS time, due to limited capacity on the system. ELVs \n\nare one-time, short duration events and much more likely to fit into \n\nthe TDRSS schedule than a multiyear mission requiring many contacts per \n\nday [77 FR 6949].\n\nOther Rulemakings\n\n 9. NASA Protective Services Enforcement [14 CFR 1204]--NASA amended \n\nis regulations by adding a subpart to establish traffic enforcement \n\nauthority and procedures at all NASA Centers and component facilities \n\n[79 FR 54902].\n\n\n\n 10. Aeronautics and Space--Statement of Organization and General \n\nInformation [14 CFR 1201]--NASA amended its regulations to make \n\nnonsubstantive changes to provide current information of NASA's \n\norganization and to redesignate the Dryden Flight Research Center as \n\nthe Armstrong Flight Research Center per H.R. 667 signed by the \n\nPresident on January 3, 2014 [79 FR 18443].\n\n 11. Delegation and Designations [14 CFR 1204]--NASA amended its \n\nregulations to make nonsubstantive changes to correct citations and \n\ntitle throughout [79 FR 11318].\n\n 12. Inventions and Contributions [14 CFR 1240] NASA amended its \n\nregulations to clarify and update the procedures for board recommended \n\nawards and the procedures and requirements for recommended special \n\ninitial awards, including patent application awards, software release \n\nawards, and Tech Brief awards, and to update citations and the \n\ninformation on the systems used for reporting inventions and issuing \n\naward payments [77 FR 27365].\n\n 13. Information Security Protection [14 CFR 1203]--NASA amended its \n\nregulations to make nonsubstantive changes to align with and implement \n\nthe provisions of Executive Order (E.O.) 13526, Classified National \n\nSecurity Information, and appropriately to correspond with NASA's \n\ninternal requirements, NPR 1600.2, Classified National Security \n\nInformation, that establishes the Agency's requirements for the proper \n\nimplementation and management of a uniform system for classifying, \n\naccounting, safeguarding, and declassifying national security \n\ninformation generated by or in the possession of NASA [78 FR 5116].\n\n 14. Claims for Patent and Copyright Infringement [14 CFR 1245]--\n\nNASA finalized its regulations relating to requirements for the filing \n\nof claims against NASA where a potential claimant believes NASA is \n\ninfringing privately owned rights in patented inventions or copyrighted \n\nworks. The requirements for filing an administrative claim are \n\nimportant since the filing of a claim carries with it certain rights \n\nrelating to the applicable statute of limitations for filing suit \n\nagainst the Government. The regulations set forth guidelines as to what \n\nNASA considers necessary to file a claim for patent or copyright \n\ninfringement, and they also provide for written notification to the \n\nclaimant upon completion of an investigation by NASA [77 FR 14686].\n\n 15. Procedures for Implementing the National Environmental Policy \n\nAct [14 CFR 1216]--NASA amended its regulations governing compliance \n\nwith the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and the \n\nCouncil on Environmental Quality's (CEQ) Code of Federal Regulations \n\n(CFR) (40 CFR parts 1500-1508). This rule replaces procedures contained \n\n\n\nin NASA's current regulations. The revised regulations are intended to \n\nimprove NASA's efficiency in implementing NEPA requirements by reducing \n\ncosts and preparation time while maintaining quality. In addition, \n\nNASA's experience in applying the NASA NEPA regulations since they were \n\nissued in 1988 suggested the need for NASA to make changes in its NEPA \n\nregulations. [77 FR 3102]\n\n 16. Boards and Committees [14 CFR 1209]--NASA amended its \n\nregulations to make nonsubstantive changes to correct and remove \n\ncitations referenced in NASA's Contract Adjustment Board rule [78 FR \n\n20422].\n\n 17. Research Misconduct [14 CFR 1275]--NASA amended its regulations \n\nto make nonsubstantive changes to the policy governing the handling of \n\nallegations of research misconduct and updates to reflect \n\norganizational changes that have occurred in the Agency [77 FR 44439].\n\n 18. Updating of Existing Privacy Act--NASA Regulations [14 CFR \n\n1212]--NASA amended its regulations to make nonsubstantive changes to \n\nits rules governing implementation of the Privacy Act by updating \n\nstatute citations, position titles, terminology, and adjusting \n\nappellate responsibility for records for records held by the NASA \n\nOffice of the Inspective General [77 FR 60620].\n\n 19. NASA Security and Protective Service Enforcement [14 CFR 1203a, \n\n1203b, 1204]--NASA amended its regulations to make nonsubstantive \n\nchanges to its regulations to clarify the procedures for establishing \n\ncontrolled/secure areas and to revise the definitions for these areas \n\nand the process for granting access to these areas, as well as denying \n\nor revoking access to such areas. Arrest powers and authority of NASA \n\nsecurity force personnel are also updated and clarified to include the \n\ncarrying of weapons and the use of such weapons should a circumstance \n\nrequire it [78 FR 5122].\n\n Abstracts for other regulations that will be amended or repealed \n\nbetween October 2014 and October 2015 are reported in the fall 2014 \n\nedition of Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulation \n\nactions.\n\nBILLING CODE 7510-13-P\n\nNATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION (NARA)\n\nStatement of Regulatory Priorities\n\nOverview\n\n The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) primarily \n\nissues regulations directed to other Federal agencies and to the \n\npublic. These regulations include records management, information \n\n\n\nservices, access to and use of NARA holdings, and grant programs. For \n\nexample, records management regulations directed to Federal agencies \n\nconcern the proper management and disposition of Federal records. \n\nThrough the Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO), NARA also \n\nissues Government-wide regulations concerning information security \n\nclassification and declassification programs. NARA regulations directed \n\nto the public address access to and use of our historically valuable \n\nholdings, including archives, donated historical materials, Nixon \n\nPresidential materials, and Presidential records. NARA also issues \n\nregulations relating to the National Historical Publications and \n\nRecords Commission (NHPRC) grant programs.\n\n NARA has two regulatory priorities for Fiscal Year 2015, which are \n\nincluded in The Regulatory Plan. The first are NARA's continuing \n\nrevisions to the\n\n[[Page 76648]]\n\nFederal records management regulations found at 36 CFR chapter XII, \n\nsubchapter B. The proposed changes include changes resulting from the \n\n2011 Presidential Memorandum on Managing Government Records and the \n\n2012 Managing Government Records Directive (M-12-18). The proposed \n\nrules will affect Federal agencies' records management programs \n\nrelating to proper records creation and maintenance, adequate \n\ndocumentation, electronic recordkeeping requirements, use of the \n\nElectronic Records Archive (ERA) for records transfer, and records \n\ndisposition. The proposed revisions have begun with changes to \n\nprovisions at 36 CFR parts 1222, 1223, 1224, 1227, 1229, 1232, 1233, \n\n1235, 1237, and 1239. These provisions were substantially revamped and \n\nbegan undergoing public comment beginning in September 2014. Additional \n\nproposed revisions to the subchapter will be published for public \n\ncomment later this fiscal year as well.\n\n The second priority is a new regulation on Controlled Unclassified \n\nInformation (CUI). The Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO), a \n\ncomponent of NARA, is proposing this rule pursuant to Executive Order \n\n13556. The Order establishes an open and uniform program for managing \n\ninformation requiring safeguarding or dissemination controls. This rule \n\nsets forth guidance to agencies on safeguarding, disseminating, \n\nmarking, and decontrolling CUI, self-inspection and oversight \n\nrequirements, and other facets of the program.\n\nBILLING CODE 7515-01-P\n\n2014 OPM\n\n\n\nStatement of Regulatory Priorities\n\nPersonnel Management in Agencies\n\n The Chief Human Capital Act of 2002 requires OPM to develop \n\nsystems, standards, and metrics for strategic human capital management \n\nin agencies. This rule promulgates these systems, standards, and \n\nmetrics.\n\nHuman Resources Management Reporting Requirements\n\n This rule was a Presidential initiative as part of paperwork \n\nreduction and eliminating burdensome and unnecessary reporting. It \n\nenables agencies to focus on strategic human capital management rather \n\nthan administrative reporting. We have been building new leadership and \n\naccountability mechanisms around its requirements. This rule also \n\nsupports Strategic Goal 3 as OPM is building internal data and \n\nreporting capabilities to replace these burdensome reporting \n\nrequirements on agencies.\n\nPerformance Appraisal System Certification for Pay Purposes\n\n This rule establishes certification criteria and procedures for \n\nagencies to follow to have their Senior Executive and Senior \n\nProfessional's appraisal system certified by OPM. An agency appraisal \n\nsystem is certified only when a review of that system's design (i.e., \n\nsystem documentation), implementation (i.e., performance plans), and \n\napplication (i.e., results) reveals that the agency meets the \n\ncertification criteria. The appraisal process must make meaningful \n\ndistinctions based on relative performance. The law requires OPM and \n\nOMB to jointly regulate the criteria and process used for appraisal \n\nsystem certification.\n\nManaging Senior Executive Performance\n\n This rule fosters an effective enterprise approach to the \n\nperformance management of Senior Executive Service (SES) members. In \n\nJanuary 2012, OPM and OMB released a basic SES appraisal system to \n\nprovide a more consistent and uniform framework to communicate \n\nexpectations and evaluate the performance of SES members. The system \n\nfocuses on the role and responsibility of SES members to achieve \n\nresults through effective executive leadership. This rule includes the \n\nrequirements of this system.\n\nFederal Employees Health Benefits Program\n\n OPM will make several amendments to the Federal Employees Health \n\n\n\nBenefits (FEHB) regulations to adhere to the provisions of the \n\nAffordable Care Act of 2010. These amendments include enrollments for \n\neligible employees of Tribes and Tribal organizations, changes to \n\nresolutions of disputed health claims and external reviews, rate \n\nsettings for community-rated plans, enrollment options following the \n\ntermination of a plan or plan option, and the expansion of eligibility \n\nto certain employees on temporary appointments and certain employees on \n\nseasonal and intermittent schedules.\n\nBILLING CODE 6325-44-P\n\nPENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION (PBGC)\n\nStatement of Regulatory and Deregulatory Priorities\n\n The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) protects the \n\npensions of more than 40 million people in more than 25,000 private-\n\nsector defined benefit plans. PBGC receives no tax revenues. Operations \n\nare financed by insurance premiums, investment income, assets from \n\npension plans trusteed by PBGC, and recoveries from the companies \n\nformerly responsible for the trusteed plans.\n\n To carry out these functions, PBGC issues regulations on such \n\nmatters as termination, payment of premiums, reporting and disclosure, \n\nand assessment and collection of employer liability. The Corporation is \n\ncommitted to issuing simple, understandable, flexible, and timely \n\nregulations to help affected parties.\n\n PBGC continues to follow a regulatory approach that does not \n\ninadvertently discourage the maintenance of existing defined benefit \n\nplans or the establishment of new plans. Thus, in developing new \n\nregulations and reviewing existing regulations, the focus, to the \n\nextent possible, is to avoid placing burdens on plans, employers, and \n\nparticipants, and to ease and simplify employer compliance. PBGC \n\nparticularly strives to meet the needs of small businesses that sponsor \n\ndefined benefit plans.\n\n PBGC develops its regulations in accordance with the principles set \n\nforth in Executive Order 13563 ``Improving Regulation and Regulatory \n\nReview'' (Jan. 18, 2011), and PBGC's Plan for Regulatory Review \n\n(Regulatory Review Plan).\\1\\ This Statement of Regulatory and \n\nDeregulatory Priorities reflects PBGC's ongoing implementation of its \n\nRegulatory Review Plan.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\1\\ http://www.pbgc.gov/documents/plan-for-regulatory-review.pdf \n\n. Progress reports on the plan can be found at            http://www.pbgc.gov/res/laws-and-regulations/reducing-\nregulatory-burden.html.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttp://www.pbgc.gov/documents/plan-for-regulatory-review.pdf\nhttp://www.pbgc.gov/res/laws-and-regulations/reducing-regulatory-burden.html\nhttp://www.pbgc.gov/res/laws-and-regulations/reducing-regulatory-burden.html\n\n\nPBGC Insurance Programs\n\n PBGC administers two insurance programs for privately defined \n\nbenefit plans under title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security \n\nAct of 1974 (ERISA):\n\n Single-Employer Program. Under the single-employer \n\nprogram, when a plan terminates with insufficient assets to cover all \n\nplan benefits (distress and involuntary terminations), PBGC pays plan \n\nbenefits that are guaranteed under title IV. PBGC also pays \n\nnonguaranteed plan benefits to the extent funded by plan assets or \n\nrecoveries from employers.\n\n Multiemployer Program. The smaller multiemployer program \n\ncovers more than 1,450 collectively bargained plans involving more than \n\none unrelated employer. PBGC provides financial assistance (in the form \n\nof a loan) to the plan if the plan is unable\n\n[[Page 76649]]\n\nto pay benefits at the guaranteed level. Guaranteed benefits are less \n\nthan single-employer guaranteed benefits.\n\n At the end of fiscal year 2013, PBGC had a deficit of about $36 \n\nbillion in its insurance programs. Current PBGC premiums are \n\ninsufficient.\n\nRegulatory Objectives and Priorities\n\n PBGC's regulatory objectives and priorities are developed in the \n\ncontext of the Corporation's statutory purposes:\n\n To encourage voluntary private pension plans.\n\n To provide for the timely and uninterrupted payment of \n\npension benefits.\n\n To keep premiums at the lowest possible levels.\n\n Pensions and the statutory framework in which they are maintained \n\nand terminate are complex. Despite this complexity, PBGC is committed \n\nto issuing simple, understandable, flexible, and timely regulations and \n\nother guidance that do not impose undue burdens that could impede \n\nmaintenance or establishment of defined benefit plans.\n\n Through its regulations and other guidance, PBGC strives to \n\nminimize burdens on plans, plan sponsors, and plan participants; \n\nsimplify filing; provide relief for small businesses and plans; and \n\nassist plans in complying with applicable requirements. To enhance \n\npolicy-making through collaboration, PBGC also plans to expand \n\nopportunities for public participation in rulemaking (see Open \n\nGovernment and Public Participation below).\n\n\n\n PBGC's current regulatory objectives and priorities are to simplify \n\nits regulations and reduce burden, particularly in the areas of \n\npremiums and reporting, enhance retirement security, and complete \n\nimplementation of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA 2006).\n\nRethinking Existing Regulations\n\n Pursuant to section 6 of Executive Order 13563 ``Improving \n\nRegulation and Regulatory Review'' (Jan. 18, 2011), the following \n\nRegulatory Identifier Numbers (RINs) have been identified as associated \n\nwith retrospective review and analysis in the Department's final \n\nretrospective review of regulations plan. The regulatory actions \n\nassociated with these RINs, as well as other regulatory review \n\nprojects, are described below.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Effect on small\n\n Title RIN business\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReportable Events.................. 1212-AB06 Expected to reduce\n\n burden on small\n\n business.\n\nPremium Rates; Payment of Premiums; 1212-AB26 Reduces the burden on\n\n Reducing Regulatory Burden. small business.\n\nMultiemployer Plans; Valuation and 1212-AB25 Little effect on small\n\n Notice Requirements. business.\n\nAllocation of Assets in Single- 1212-AA55 Undetermined.\n\n Employer Plans; Valuation of\n\n Benefits and Assets.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Reportable events. PPA 2006 affected certain provisions in PBGC's \n\nreportable events regulation, which requires employers to notify PBGC \n\nof certain plan or corporate events. In November 2009, PBGC published a \n\nproposed rule to conform the regulation to the PPA 2006 changes and \n\nmake other changes.\\2\\ In response to Executive Order 13563 and \n\ncomments on the proposed rule, in April 2013, PBGC published a new \n\nproposal that would exempt more than 90 percent of plans and sponsors \n\nfrom many reporting requirements. The new proposal takes advantage of \n\nother existing reporting requirements and methods to avoid burdening \n\ncompanies and plans and expands waivers and redefines events to reduce \n\nreporting. The new proposal implements stakeholder suggestions that \n\ndifferent reporting requirements should apply in circumstances where \n\nthe risk to PBGC is low or compliance is especially burdensome. PBGC is \n\n\n\ndeveloping the final rule, taking into account the public comments.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\2\\ 74 FR 61248 (Nov. 23, 2009), http://www.pbgc.gov/Documents/E9-28056.pdf .\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Premiums. In January and March 2014 PBGC published final rules to \n\nmake its premium rules more effective and less burdensome. \\3\\ PBGC \n\ndeveloped the rules in response to regulatory review and public \n\ncomments. The changes simplify due dates, coordinate the due date for \n\nterminating plans with the termination process, make conforming and \n\nclarifying changes to the variable-rate premium rules, and provide for \n\nrelief from penalties. Large plans no longer have to pay flat-rate \n\npremiums early; small plans get more time to value benefits. The \n\nchanges were favorably received by the pension community.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\3\\ 79 FR 347 (Jan. 3, 2014), http://www.pbgc.gov/documents/2013-31109.pdf; 79 FR 13547 (Mar. 11, 2014),            \nhttp://www.pbgc.gov/documents/2014-05212.pdf .\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Multiemployer plans. In May 2014, PBGC published a final rule \n\namending PBGC's multiemployer regulations.\\4\\ The changes were \n\ndeveloped as a result of PBGC's regulatory review. The amendments \n\nreduce the number of actuarial valuations required for certain small \n\nterminated but not insolvent plans, shorten the advance notice filing \n\nrequirements for mergers in situations that do not involve a compliance \n\ndetermination, and remove certain insolvency notice and update \n\nrequirements.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\4\\ 79 FR 30459 (May 28, 2014), http://www.pbgc.gov/documents/2014-12154.pdf .\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Allocation of Assets in Single-Employer Plans; Valuation of \n\nBenefits and Assets. In FY 2014, PBGC began an internal process to \n\nestablish routine, periodic review of PBGC regulations and policies to \n\nensure that the actuarial and economic content remains current.\n\n ERISA section 4062(e). The statutory provision requires reporting \n\nof, and liability for, certain substantial cessations of operations by \n\nemployers that maintain single-employer plans. In August 2010, PBGC \n\nissued a proposed rule to provide guidance on the applicability and \n\nenforcement of section 4062(e).\\5\\ In light of comments on the proposal \n\nand PBGC's enforcement practices, in November 2012, PBGC announced a \n\nhttp://www.pbgc.gov/Documents/E9-28056.pdf\nhttp://www.pbgc.gov/documents/2013-31109.pdf;\nhttp://www.pbgc.gov/documents/2014-05212.pdf\nhttp://www.pbgc.gov/documents/2014-12154.pdf\n\n\n4062(e) enforcement pilot program under which it did not enforce in the \n\ncase of small plans or financially strong sponsors (90 percent of plans \n\nare small or have financially strong sponsors). In July 2014, PBGC \n\nannounced a moratorium, until the end of 2014, on the enforcement of \n\n4062(e) cases.\\6\\ The moratorium will enable PBGC to further target at-\n\nrisk plans and work with the business community, labor, and other \n\nstakeholders to minimize effects on necessary business activities. At \n\nthis time, PBGC is withdrawing RIN 1212-AB20 from its regulatory \n\nagenda.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\5\\ 75 FR 48283 (Aug. 10, 2010), http://www.pbgc.gov/Documents/2010-19627.pdf .\n\n \\6\\            http://www.pbgc.gov/news/press/releases/pr14-09.html .\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n ERISA section 4010. PBGC is reviewing its regulation on Annual \n\nFinancial and Actuarial Information Reporting (part 4010) and the \n\nrelated e-filing application to consider ways of reducing reporting \n\nburden and ensuring that PBGC receives the critical information it \n\nneeds.\n\n[[Page 76650]]\n\nRetirement Security\n\n DC to DB plan rollovers.\n\n In April 2014, PBGC published a proposed rule that would clarify \n\nthe treatment of benefits resulting from a rollover distribution from a \n\ndefined contribution plan to a defined benefit plan, if the defined \n\nbenefit plan was terminated and trusteed by PBGC.\\7\\ Under the \n\nproposal, a benefit resulting from rollover amounts generally would not \n\nbe subject to PBGC's maximum guaranteeable benefit or phase-in \n\nlimitations and would be in the second highest priority category of \n\nbenefits in the allocation of assets. The proposed rule was well-\n\nreceived by the public, and PBGC expects to publish a final rule early \n\nin FY 2015. This rulemaking is part of PBGC's efforts to enhance \n\nretirement security by promoting lifetime income options.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\7\\ 79 FR 18483 (Apr. 2, 2014), http://www.pbgc.gov/documents/2014-07323.pdf .\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPPA 2006 Implementation\n\n Cash balance plans. PPA 2006 changed the rules for determining \n\nbenefits in cash balance plans and other statutory hybrid plans. In \n\nhttp://www.pbgc.gov/Documents/2010-19627.pdf\nhttp://www.pbgc.gov/news/press/releases/pr14-09.html\nhttp://www.pbgc.gov/documents/2014-07323.pdf\n\n\nOctober 2011, PBGC published a proposed rule implementing the changes \n\nin both PBGC-trusteed plans and in plans that close out in the private \n\nsector.\\8\\ The final rule is on hold until Treasury issues final \n\nregulations.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\8\\ 76 FR 67105 (Oct. 31, 2011), http://www.pbgc.gov/Documents/2011-28124.pdf .\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Missing participants. A major focus of PBGC's current regulatory \n\nefforts is the development of a proposal to improve and expand our \n\nmissing participants program. The expanded program will cover \n\nterminating defined contribution plans, non-covered defined benefit \n\nplans, and multiemployer plans. The proposal will take into account \n\ncomments received from employers, plans, and other stakeholders in \n\nresponse to a 2013 Request for Information. PBGC is working with IRS \n\nand DOL to coordinate government requirements for dealing with missing \n\nparticipant issues. PBGC expects to publish a proposed regulation early \n\nin FY 2015.\n\n Shutdown benefits. Under PPA 2006, the phase-in period for the \n\nguarantee of a benefit payable solely by reason of an ``unpredictable \n\ncontingent event,'' such as a plant shutdown, starts no earlier than \n\nthe date of the shutdown or other unpredictable contingent event. PBGC \n\npublished a final rule implementing this statutory change in May \n\n2014.\\9\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\9\\ 79 FR 25667 (May 6, 2014), http://www.pbgc.gov/documents/2014-10357.pdf\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSmall Businesses\n\n PBGC takes into account the special needs and concerns of small \n\nbusinesses in making policy. A large percentage of the plans insured by \n\nPBGC are small or maintained by small employers. PBGC has issued or is \n\nconsidering several proposed rules that will focus on small businesses:\n\n Small plan premium due date. The March 2014 final rule discussed \n\nabove under Retrospective Review of Existing Regulations addresses \n\nconcerns that some small plans determine funding levels too late in the \n\nyear to be able to use current-year figures for the variable-rate \n\npremium by the new uniform due date. Under the final rule, small plans \n\ngenerally use prior-year figures for the variable-rate premium (with a \n\nprovision for opting to use current-year figures).\n\nhttp://www.pbgc.gov/Documents/2011-28124.pdf\nhttp://www.pbgc.gov/documents/2014-10357.pdf\n\n\n Reportable events. The reportable events proposed rule discussed \n\nabove under Retrospective Review of Existing Regulations would waive \n\nmany reporting requirements for plans with fewer than 100 participants.\n\n Missing participants. The missing participants proposed rule \n\ndiscussed above under PPA 2006 Implementation would benefit small \n\nbusinesses by simplifying and streamlining current requirements, better \n\ncoordinating with requirements of other agencies, and providing more \n\noptions for sponsors of terminating non-covered plans.\n\nOpen Government and Increased Public Participation\n\n PBGC is doing more to encourage public participation in the \n\nregulatory process. For example, PBGC's current efforts to reduce \n\nregulatory burden are in substantial part a response to public \n\ncomments. Regulatory projects discussed above, such as reportable \n\nevents, ERISA section 4062(e), and ERISA section 4010, highlight PBGC's \n\ncustomer-focused efforts to reduce regulatory burden.\n\n PBGC's Regulatory Review Plan sets forth ways to expand \n\nopportunities for public participation in the regulatory process. For \n\nexample, in June 2013, PBGC held its first ever regulatory hearing on \n\nthe reportable events proposed rule, so that the agency would have a \n\nbetter understanding of the needs and concerns of plan administrators \n\nand plan sponsors. PBGC's 2013 Request for Information on missing \n\nparticipants in individual account plans is another example of PBGC's \n\nefforts to solicit public participation in the regulatory process.\n\n PBGC plans to provide additional means for public involvement, \n\nincluding on-line town hall meetings, social media, and continuing \n\nopportunity for public comment on PBGC's Web site.\n\n PBGC also invites comments on the Regulatory Review Plan on an on-\n\ngoing basis as we engage in the review process. Comments should be sent \n\nto regs.comments@pbgc.gov\n\n PBGC will continue to look for ways to further improve its \n\nregulations.\n\nBILLING CODE 7709-01-P\n\nU.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION (SBA)\n\nStatement of Regulatory Priorities\n\nOverview\n\n The mission of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is to \n\nmaintain and strengthen the Nation's economy by enabling the \n\nestablishment and viability of small businesses and by assisting in \n\nmailto:regs.comments@pbgc.gov\n\n\neconomic recovery of communities after disasters. In carrying out this \n\nmission, SBA strives to improve the economic environment for small \n\nbusinesses, including those in areas that have significantly higher \n\nunemployment and lower income levels than the Nation's averages and \n\nthose in traditionally underserved markets. The Agency serves as a \n\nguarantor of small business loans, and also provides management and \n\ntechnical assistance to existing or potential small business owners \n\nthrough various grants, cooperative agreements or contracts. This \n\naccess to capital and other assistance provides a crucial foundation \n\nfor those starting a new business, or growing an existing business and \n\nultimately creating new jobs. SBA also provides direct financial \n\nassistance to homeowners, renters, and small business owners to help \n\ncommunities to rebuild in the aftermath of a disaster.\n\nReducing Burden on Small Businesses\n\n SBA's regulatory policy reflects a commitment to developing \n\nregulations that reduce or eliminate the burden on the public, \n\nespecially the Agency's core constituents--small businesses. SBA's \n\nregulatory process generally includes an assessment of the costs and \n\nbenefits of the regulations as required by Executive Order 12866, \n\n``Regulatory Planning and Review''; Executive Order 13563, ``Improving \n\nRegulation and Regulatory Review''; and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. \n\nSBA's program offices are particularly invested in finding ways to \n\nreduce the burden imposed by the Agency's core activities in its loan, \n\ninnovation, and procurement programs.\n\n[[Page 76651]]\n\nOpenness and Transparency\n\n SBA promotes transparency, collaboration, and public participation \n\nin its rulemaking process. To that end, SBA routinely solicits comments \n\non its regulations, even those that are not subject to the public \n\nnotice and comment requirement under the Administrative Procedure Act. \n\nWhere appropriate, SBA also conducts hearings, webinars, and other \n\npublic events as part of its regulatory process.\n\nRegulatory Framework\n\n The SBA's FY 2014 to FY 2018 strategic plan serves as the \n\nfoundation for the regulations that the Agency will develop during the \n\nnext 12 months. The strategic plan proposes three strategic goals: (1) \n\nGrowing businesses and creating jobs; (2) serving as the voice for \n\nsmall business; and (3) building an SBA that meets the needs of today's \n\nand tomorrow's small businesses. In order to achieve these goals SBA \n\n\n\nwill, among other objectives, focus on:\n\n Expanding access to capital through SBA's extensive \n\nlending network;\n\n Ensuring Federal contracting goals are met or exceeded by \n\ncollaborating across the Federal Government to expand opportunities for \n\nsmall businesses and strengthen the integrity of the Federal \n\ncontracting data and certification process;\n\n Strengthening SBA's relevance to high growth entrepreneurs \n\nand small businesses to more effectively drive innovation and job \n\ncreation; and\n\n Mitigating risk and improving program oversight.\n\n The regulations reported in SBA's semi-annual regulatory agenda and \n\nplan are intended to facilitate achievement of these goals and \n\nobjectives. Over the next 12 months, SBA's highest regulatory priority \n\nis to implement the Mentor-Prot[eacute]g[eacute] Programs, which were \n\nauthorized by the Small Business Jobs Act, for participants in the \n\nHUBZone, Women Owned Small Business (WOSB) Contracting, and Service-\n\nDisabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) Programs and expanded to \n\nall small business concerns by the National Defense Authorization Act \n\nfor FY 2013.\n\n (1) Small Business Mentor-Prot[eacute]g[eacute] Programs (RIN: 3245-\n\nAG24):\n\n SBA currently has a mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] program for the \n\n8(a) Business Development Program that is intended to enhance the \n\ncapabilities of the prot[eacute]g[eacute] and to improve its ability to \n\nsuccessfully compete for Federal contracts. The Small Business Jobs Act \n\nauthorized SBA to use this model to establish similar mentor-\n\nprot[eacute]g[eacute] programs for the Service Disabled Veteran Owned, \n\nHUBZone and Women-Owned Small Business Programs. The National Defense \n\nAuthorization Act for FY 2013 further authorized SBA to extend the \n\navailability of mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] programs to all small \n\nbusiness concerns. During the next 12 months, one of SBA's priorities \n\nwill be to issue regulations establishing these newly authorized \n\nmentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] programs. The various types of assistance \n\nthat a mentor will be expected to provide to a prot[eacute]g[eacute] \n\ninclude technical and/or management assistance; financial assistance in \n\nthe form of equity investment and/or loans; subcontracts and/or \n\nassistance in performing prime contracts with the Government in the \n\nform of joint venture arrangements.\n\nRetrospective Review of Existing Regulations\n\n Pursuant to section 6 of Executive Order 13563 ``Improving \n\nRegulation and Regulatory Review'' (Jan. 18, 2011), SBA developed a \n\n\n\nplan for the retrospective review of its regulations. Since that date \n\nSBA has issued several updates to this plan to reflect the Agency's \n\nongoing efforts in carrying out this executive order. The final agency \n\nplan and review updates can be found at http://www.sba.gov/about-\nsba/sba_performance/open_government/retrospective_review_of_regulations.\n\nBILLING CODE 8025-01-P\n\nSOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION (SSA)\n\nStatement of Regulatory Priorities\n\n We administer the Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Insurance \n\nprograms under title II of the Social Security Act (Act), the \n\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI) program under title XVI of the Act, \n\nand the Special Veterans Benefits program under title VIII of the Act. \n\nAs directed by Congress, we also assist in administering portions of \n\nthe Medicare program under title XVIII of the Act. Our regulations \n\ncodify the requirements for eligibility and entitlement to benefits and \n\nour procedures for administering these programs. Generally, our \n\nregulations do not impose burdens on the private sector or on State or \n\nlocal governments, except for the States' disability determination \n\nservices. We fully fund the disability determination services in \n\nadvance or by way of reimbursement for necessary costs in making \n\ndisability determinations.\n\n The ten entries in our regulatory plan (plan) represent issues of \n\nmajor importance to the Agency. We describe the individual initiatives \n\nmore fully in the attached plan.\n\nImproving the Disability Process\n\n Since the continued improvement of the disability program is of \n\nvital concern to us, we have initiatives in the plan addressing \n\ndisability-related issues. They include:\n\n One proposed rule and five final rules update the medical listings \n\nused to determine disability--evaluating digestive disorders, \n\nneurological impairments, hematological disorders, growth disorders and \n\nweight loss in children, human immunodeficiency virus infection for \n\nevaluating functional limitation in immune system disorders, and cancer \n\n(malignant neoplastic diseases). The revisions reflect our adjudicative \n\nexperience and advances in medical knowledge, diagnosis, and treatment.\n\nEnhance Public Service\n\n Another proposed rule will require our claimants to inform us or to \n\nsubmit all evidence known to them that relates to their disability \n\nclaim.\n\nhttp://www.sba.gov/about-sba/sba_performance/open_government/retrospective_review_of_regulations\nhttp://www.sba.gov/about-sba/sba_performance/open_government/retrospective_review_of_regulations\n\n\n We are revising our rules to allow applicants for a Social Security \n\nnumber card to apply by completing a prescribed application and \n\nsubmitting the required evidence, rather than completing a paper \n\napplication.\n\n There is one proposed rule that will enhance claims processing. The \n\nrule will strengthen the integrity of our programs by clarifying our \n\nexpectations about the obligations representatives have in representing \n\ntheir clients.\n\nRetrospective Review of Existing Regulations\n\n Pursuant to section 6 of Executive Order 13563 ``Improving \n\nRegulation and Regulatory Review'' (January 18, 2011), the following \n\nRegulatory Identifier Numbers (RINs) have been identified as associated \n\nwith retrospective review and analysis in our final retrospective \n\nreview of regulations plan. Some of the entries on this list may be \n\ncompleted actions, which do not appear in The Regulatory Plan. However, \n\nyou can find more information about these completed rulemakings in past \n\npublications of the Unified Agenda at: www.Reginfo.gov in the Completed \n\nActions section for the Social Security Administration.

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, \n\nthe CFPB has rulemaking, supervisory, enforcement, and other \n\nauthorities relating to consumer financial products and services. Among \n\nthese are the consumer financial protection authorities that \n\ntransferred to the CFPB from seven Federal agencies on the designated \n\ntransfer date, July 21, 2011. These authorities include the ability to \n\nissue regulations under more than a dozen Federal consumer financial \n\nlaws.\n\n As provided in section 1021 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the purpose of \n\nthe CFPB is to implement and enforce Federal consumer financial laws \n\nconsistently for the purpose of ensuring that all consumers have access \n\nto markets for consumer financial products and services and that such \n\nmarkets are fair, transparent, and competitive. The CFPB is authorized \n\nto exercise its authorities for the purpose of ensuring that:\n\n (1) Consumers are provided with timely and understandable \n\ninformation to make responsible decisions about transactions involving \n\nconsumer financial products and services;\n\n (2) Consumers are protected from unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts \n\nand practices and from discrimination;\n\n (3) Outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome regulations \n\nconcerning consumer financial products and services are regularly \n\nidentified and addressed in order to reduce unwarranted regulatory \n\nburdens;\n\n (4) Federal consumer financial law is enforced consistently, \n\nwithout regard to status as a depository institution, in order to \n\npromote fair competition; and\n\n (5) Markets for consumer financial products and services operate \n\ntransparently and efficiently to facilitate access and innovation.\n\n\n\nCFPB Regulatory Priorities\n\n The CFPB's regulatory priorities for the period from November 1, \n\n2014, to October 31, 2015, include continuing work to implement Dodd-\n\nFrank Act mortgage protections, a series of rulemakings to address \n\ncritical issues in other markets for consumer financial products and \n\nservices, and following up on earlier efforts to streamline and \n\nmodernize regulations that the Bureau has inherited from other federal \n\nagencies.\n\nImplementing Dodd-Frank Act Mortgage Protections\n\n As reflected in the CFPB's semiannual regulatory agenda, a \n\nprincipal focus of the CFPB is the Bureau's continuing efforts to \n\nimplement critical consumer protections under the Dodd-Frank Act to \n\nguard against mortgage market practices that contributed to the \n\nnation's most significant financial crisis in several decades.\n\n A major rulemaking priority for the Bureau continues to be the \n\nimplementation of the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to the Home Mortgage \n\nDisclosure Act (HMDA) and other\n\n[[Page 76657]]\n\nrevisions to the HMDA regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act amendments \n\naugment existing data reporting requirements regarding housing-related \n\nloans and applications for such loans. In addition to obtaining data \n\nthat is critical to the purposes of HMDA--which include providing the \n\npublic and public officials with information that can be used to help \n\ndetermine whether financial institutions are serving the housing needs \n\nof their communities, assisting public officials in the distribution of \n\npublic sector investments, and assisting in identifying possible \n\ndiscriminatory lending patterns and enforcing antidiscrimination \n\nstatutes--the Bureau views this rulemaking as an opportunity to \n\nstreamline and modernize HMDA data collection and reporting, in \n\nfurtherance of its mission under the Dodd-Frank Act to reduce \n\nunwarranted regulatory burden. The Bureau published a proposed HMDA \n\nrule in the Federal Register on August 29, 2014 to add several new \n\nreporting requirements and to clarify several existing requirements. \n\nPublication of the proposal followed initial outreach efforts and the \n\nconvening of a panel under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement \n\nFairness Act in conjunction with the Office of Management and Budget \n\nand the Small Business Administration's Chief Counsel for Advocacy, to \n\nconsult with small lenders who may be affected by the rulemaking. As \n\nthe Bureau develops a final rule, it expects to review and consider \n\n\n\npublic comments on the proposed rule, consult with other agencies and \n\ncoordinate with them on implementation efforts, conduct additional \n\noutreach to build and refine operational capacity, and prepare to \n\nassist financial institutions in their compliance efforts.\n\n A major effort of the Bureau is the implementation of its final \n\nrule combining several federal mortgage disclosures that consumers \n\nreceive in connection with applying for and closing on a mortgage loan \n\nunder the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and the Real Estate Settlement \n\nProcedures Act (RESPA). This project is mandated under the Dodd-Frank \n\nAct both to increase consumer understanding of mortgage transactions \n\nand to facilitate compliance by industry. The integrated forms are the \n\ncornerstone of the Bureau's broader ``Know Before You Owe'' initiative. \n\nThese new ``Know Before You Owe'' mortgage forms and their implementing \n\nregulations will replace several pages of existing federal disclosures \n\nwith two simpler, streamlined forms that will help consumers understand \n\ntheir options, choose the deal that is best for them, and avoid costly \n\nsurprises at the closing table. The Bureau conducted extensive \n\nqualitative testing of the new forms prior to issuing a proposal, and \n\nalso conducted a post-proposal quantitative study to validate the \n\nresults of the new forms. The results of the quantitative testing \n\nshowed that consumers of all different experience levels, with \n\ndifferent loan types--whether focused on buying a home or refinancing--\n\nwere able to understand the Bureau's new forms better than the current \n\nforms.\n\n The rule was issued in November 2013 and takes effect in August \n\n2015. The Bureau is working intensively to support implementation \n\nefforts and prepare consumer education materials and initiatives to \n\nhelp consumers understand and use the new forms. To facilitate \n\nimplementation, the Bureau has released two compliance guides, sample \n\nforms, and additional materials. The Bureau also has been conducting \n\nextensive industry outreach to identify interpretive questions or \n\nimplementation challenges with the rule, and hosting ongoing webinars \n\nto address common questions. In addition, in late 2014, the Bureau \n\nplans to issue a small proposed rule to make technical corrections, \n\nallow for certain language related to new construction loans to be \n\nadded to the Loan Estimate form, and modify the same-day redisclosure \n\nrequirement for floating interest rates that are locked after the Loan \n\nEstimate is first provided.\n\n In addition, the Bureau is working to support the full \n\nimplementation of, and facilitate compliance with, various mortgage-\n\n\n\nrelated final rules issued by the Bureau in January 2013 to strengthen \n\nconsumer protections involving the origination and servicing of \n\nmortgages. These rules, implementing requirements under the Dodd-Frank \n\nAct, were all effective by January 2014. The Bureau is working \n\ndiligently to monitor the market and plans to make clarifications and \n\nadjustments to the rules where warranted. The Bureau is planning to \n\nissue rules in fall 2014 to provide certain adjustments to its rules \n\nfor certain nonprofit entities and to provide a cure mechanism for \n\nlenders seeking to make ``qualified mortgages'' under rules requiring \n\nassessment of consumers' ability to repay their mortgage loans where \n\nthe mortgages exceed certain limitations on points and fees. The Bureau \n\nalso anticipates issuing a proposal in fall 2014 to amend various \n\nprovisions of its mortgage servicing rules, in both Regulation X and \n\nRegulation Z, including further clarification of the applicability of \n\ncertain provisions when the borrower is in bankruptcy, possible \n\nadditional enhancements to loss mitigation requirements, and other \n\ntopics. In addition, in order to promote access to credit, the Bureau \n\nis currently engaged in further research to assess the impact of \n\ncertain provisions implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act that modify \n\ngeneral requirements for small creditors that operate predominantly in \n\n``rural or underserved'' areas, and expects to release a notice of \n\nproposed rulemaking in early 2015.\n\n Further, the Bureau continues to participate in a series of \n\ninteragency rulemakings to implement various Dodd-Frank Act amendments \n\nto TILA and the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement \n\nAct (FIRREA) relating to mortgage appraisals. These include \n\nimplementing certain other Dodd-Frank Act amendments to FIRREA \n\nconcerning regulation of appraisal management companies and automated \n\nvaluation models.\n\nBureau Regulatory Efforts in Other Consumer Financial Markets\n\n In addition to the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act mortgage \n\nrelated amendments, the Bureau is also working on a number of \n\nrulemakings to address important consumer protection issues in other \n\nmarkets for consumer financial products and services. Much of this \n\neffort will be based on previous work of the Bureau such as Requests \n\nfor Information, Advance Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRMs), and \n\npreviously issued Bureau studies and reports.\n\n First, the Bureau anticipates in fall 2014 issuing a proposed rule \n\n\n\nto create a comprehensive set of protections for General Purpose \n\nReloadable (GPR) cards and other prepaid products, such as payroll \n\ncards and student loan disbursement cards, which are increasingly being \n\nused by consumers in place of a traditional deposit account or credit \n\ncard. The proposal will build on comments received by the Bureau in \n\nresponse to a 2012 ANPRM seeking comment, data, and information from \n\nthe public about GPR cards. The proposed rule will seek to expand \n\ncoverage in Regulation E (implementing the Electronic Fund Transfer \n\nAct) to prepaid accounts, including GPR cards, by extending and in some \n\ncases modifying disclosure, periodic statement, and error resolution \n\nrequirements that apply to consumer asset accounts that are currently \n\nsubject to Regulation E. The Bureau also expects the proposal to \n\naddress treatment of overdraft services and\n\n[[Page 76658]]\n\ncredit features in connection with prepaid accounts under both \n\nRegulation Z (Truth in Lending Act) and Regulation E.\n\n Building on Bureau research and other sources, the Bureau is also \n\nconsidering what rules may be appropriate for addressing the sustained \n\nuse of short-term, high-cost credit products such as payday loans and \n\ndeposit advance products. The Bureau issued a white paper on these \n\nproducts in April 2013 and a data point providing additional research \n\nin March 2014, and is continuing to analyze other consumer protection \n\nconcerns associated with the use of high-cost, small-dollar credit \n\nproducts. Rulemaking might include disclosures or address acts or \n\npractices in connection with these products.\n\n The Bureau is also continuing to develop research on other critical \n\nconsumer protection markets to help assess whether regulation may be \n\nwarranted. For example, the Bureau issued research on bank and credit \n\nunion overdraft programs in 2013 and 2014 and is planning to release \n\nthe results of further studies on overdraft programs and their effects \n\non consumers.\n\n In addition, the Bureau has launched research initiatives to build \n\non its November 2013 ANPRM on debt collection. These efforts include \n\nundertaking a survey to obtain information from consumers about their \n\nexperiences with debt collection and launching consumer testing \n\ninitiatives to determine what information would be useful for consumers \n\nto have about debt collection and their debts and how that information \n\nshould be provided to them.\n\n Bureau work is also continuing on a number of earlier initiatives \n\nconcerning consumer payment services. In addition to the prepaid \n\n\n\nrulemaking discussed above, in 2014, the Bureau engaged in a rulemaking \n\nto make further amendments to its existing rule that applies to \n\nconsumer remittance transfers to foreign countries. The primary purpose \n\nof the rulemaking was to address whether to extend a provision under \n\nthe Dodd-Frank Act that allows insured depository institutions to \n\nestimate certain information for purposes of consumer disclosures. The \n\nprovision would have expired in July 2015 unless the Bureau exercises \n\nauthority to extend it for up to five years. The Bureau's final rule \n\nextended the provision to July 2020.\n\n The Bureau is continuing rulemaking activities that will further \n\nestablish the Bureau's nonbank supervisory authority by defining larger \n\nparticipants of certain markets for consumer financial products and \n\nservices. Larger participants of such markets, as the Bureau defines by \n\nrule, are subject to the Bureau's supervisory authority. In fall 2014, \n\nthe Bureau issued a final rule that amended the regulation defining \n\nlarger participants of certain consumer financial products and services \n\nmarkets by adding a new section to define larger participants of a \n\nmarket for international money transfers, and began a rulemaking that \n\nwould define larger participants of a market for automobile financing \n\nand define certain automobile leasing activity as a financial product \n\nor service.\n\nBureau Regulatory Streamlining Efforts\n\n Another priority for the Bureau is continuing work on an earlier \n\ninitiative to consider opportunities to modernize and streamline \n\nregulations that it inherited from other agencies pursuant to a \n\ntransfer of rulemaking authority under the Dodd-Frank Act. In \n\nconnection with the HMDA rulemaking described above, the Bureau has \n\nidentified potential opportunities to reduce unwarranted regulatory \n\nburden concerning reporting of mortgage application, origination, and \n\npurchase activity, as described in the proposed rule. Similarly, the \n\nBureau took the opportunity when streamlining federal mortgage forms as \n\nmandated by the Dodd-Frank Act and discussed above, to clarify existing \n\nregulations to address longstanding compliance concerns. The Bureau \n\nalso issued a final rule in fall 2014 to allow financial institutions \n\nthat restrict their information sharing practices and meet other \n\nrequirements to post their annual privacy notices to customers under \n\nthe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act online rather than delivering them \n\nindividually. The rulemaking addresses longstanding concerns that the \n\n\n\nannual mailings are a source of unwarranted regulatory burden and \n\nunwanted paperwork for consumers.\n\nAdditional Analysis, Planning, and Prioritization\n\n The Bureau is continuing to assess timelines for the issuance of \n\nadditional Dodd-Frank Act related rulemakings and rulemakings inherited \n\nby the CFPB from other agencies as part of the transfer of authorities \n\nunder the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bureau is also continuing to conduct \n\noutreach and research to assess issues in various other markets for \n\nconsumer financial products and services. For example, as directed by \n\nCongress, the Bureau is conducting a study on the use of agreements \n\nproviding for arbitration of consumer disputes in connection with the \n\noffering or providing of consumer financial products or services. Upon \n\ncompletion of this study, the Bureau will evaluate possible policy \n\nresponses, including possible rulemaking actions, the findings of which \n\nshall be consistent with the study. The Bureau will similarly evaluate \n\npolicy responses to other ongoing research and outreach, taking into \n\naccount the critical need for and effectiveness of various policy \n\ntools. The Bureau will update its regulatory agenda in spring 2015 to \n\nreflect the results of further analysis, planning, and prioritization.\n\nBILLING CODE 4810-AM-P\n\nCONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION (CPSC)\n\nStatement of Regulatory Priorities\n\n The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with \n\nprotecting the public from unreasonable risks of death and injury \n\nassociated with consumer products. To achieve this goal, the CPSC:\n\n develops mandatory product safety standards or bans when \n\nother efforts are inadequate to address a safety hazard, or where \n\nrequired by statute;\n\n obtains repair, replacement, or refunds for defective \n\nproducts that present a substantial product hazard;\n\n develops information and education campaigns about the \n\nsafety of consumer products;\n\n participates in the development or revision of voluntary \n\nproduct safety standards; and\n\n follows statutory mandates.\n\n Unless directed otherwise by congressional mandate, when deciding \n\nwhich of these approaches to take in any specific case, the CPSC \n\ngathers and analyzes data about the nature and extent of the risk \n\npresented by the product. The Commission's rules at 16 CFR 1009.8 \n\n\n\nrequire the Commission to consider, among other factors, the following \n\ncriteria when deciding the level of priority for any particular \n\nproject:\n\n frequency and severity of injury;\n\n causality of injury;\n\n chronic illness and future injuries;\n\n costs and benefits of Commission action;\n\n unforeseen nature of the risk;\n\n vulnerability of the population at risk;\n\n probability of exposure to the hazard; and\n\n additional criteria that warrant Commission attention.\n\nSignificant Regulatory Actions:\n\n Currently, the Commission is considering one rule that would \n\nconstitute a ``significant regulatory\n\n[[Page 76659]]\n\naction'' under the definition of that term in Executive Order 12866:\n\n 1. Flammability Standard for Upholstered Furniture\n\n Under section 4 of the Flammable Fabrics Act (FFA), the Commission \n\nmay issue a flammability standard or other regulation for a product of \n\ninterior furnishing if the Commission determines that such a standard \n\nis needed to adequately protect the public against unreasonable risk of \n\nthe occurrence of fire leading to death or personal injury, or \n\nsignificant property damage. The Commission's regulatory proceeding \n\ncould result in several actions, one of which could be the development \n\nof a mandatory standard requiring that upholstered furniture meet \n\nmandatory requirements specified in the standard.\n\nBILLING CODE 6355-01-P\n\nFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC)\n\nStatement of Regulatory and Deregulatory Priorities\n\nI. Regulatory and Deregulatory Priorities\n\nBackground\n\n The Federal Trade Commission (``FTC'' or ``Commission'') is an \n\nindependent agency charged by its enabling statute, the Federal Trade \n\nCommission Act, with protecting American consumers from ``unfair \n\nmethods of competition'' and ``unfair or deceptive acts or practices'' \n\nin the marketplace. The Commission strives to ensure that consumers \n\nbenefit from a vigorously competitive marketplace. The Commission's \n\nwork is rooted in a belief that competition, based on truthful and non-\n\nmisleading information about products and services, provides consumers \n\n\n\nthe best choice of products and services at the lowest prices.\n\n The Commission pursues its goal of promoting competition in the \n\nmarketplace through two different but complementary approaches. Unfair \n\nor deceptive acts or practices injure both consumers and honest \n\ncompetitors alike and undermine competitive markets. Through its \n\nconsumer protection activities, the Commission seeks to ensure that \n\nconsumers receive accurate, truthful, and non-misleading information in \n\nthe marketplace. At the same time, for consumers to have a choice of \n\nproducts and services at competitive prices and quality, the \n\nmarketplace must be free from anticompetitive business practices. Thus, \n\nthe second part of the Commission's basic mission--antitrust \n\nenforcement--is to prohibit anticompetitive mergers or other \n\nanticompetitive business practices without unduly interfering with the \n\nlegitimate activities of businesses. These two complementary missions \n\nmake the Commission unique insofar as it is the Nation's only Federal \n\nagency to be given this combination of statutory authority to protect \n\nconsumers.\n\n The Commission is, first and foremost, a law enforcement agency. It \n\npursues its mandate primarily through case-by-case enforcement of the \n\nFederal Trade Commission Act and other statutes. In addition, the \n\nCommission is also charged with the responsibility of issuing and \n\nenforcing regulations under a number of statutes. Pursuant to the FTC \n\nAct, the Commission currently has in place 16 trade regulation rules. \n\nOther examples include the regulations enforced pursuant to credit, \n\nfinancial and marketing practice statutes \\1\\ and to energy laws.\\2\\ \n\nThe Commission also has adopted a number of voluntary industry guides. \n\nMost of the regulations and guides pertain to consumer protection \n\nmatters and are intended to ensure that consumers receive the \n\ninformation necessary to evaluate competing products and make informed \n\npurchasing decisions.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\1\\ For example, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited \n\nPornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (CAN-SPAM Act) (15 U.S.C. \n\nsections 7701-7713) and the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and \n\nAbuse Prevention Act (15 U.S.C. sections 6101-6108).\n\n \\2\\ For example, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (106 Stat. 2776, \n\ncodified in scattered sections of the U.S. Code, particularly 42 \n\nU.S.C. section 6201 et seq. and the Energy Independence and Security \n\nAct of 2007 (EISA)).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCommission Initiatives\n\n The Commission protects consumers through a variety of tools, \n\n\n\nincluding both regulatory and non-regulatory approaches. It has \n\nencouraged industry self-regulation, developed a corporate leniency \n\npolicy for certain rule violations, and established compliance \n\npartnerships where appropriate.\n\n As detailed below, protecting consumer privacy, containing the \n\nrising costs of health care and prescription drugs, fostering \n\ncompetition and innovation in cutting-edge, high-tech industries, \n\nchallenging deceptive advertising and marketing, and safeguarding the \n\ninterests of potentially vulnerable consumers, such as children and the \n\nfinancially distressed, continue to be at the forefront of the \n\nCommission's consumer protection and competition programs. By subject \n\narea, the FTC discusses some of the major workshops, reports,\\3\\ and \n\ninitiatives it has pursued since the 2013 Regulatory Plan was \n\npublished.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\3\\ The FTC also prepares a number of annual and periodic \n\nreports on the statutes it administers. These are not discussed in \n\nthis plan.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n (a) Protecting Consumer Privacy. As the nation's top enforcer on \n\nthe consumer privacy beat, the FTC works to ensure that consumers can \n\ntake advantage of the benefits of a dynamic and ever-changing digital \n\nmarketplace without compromising their privacy. The FTC achieves that \n\ngoal through civil law enforcement, policy initiatives, and consumer \n\nand business education. For example, the FTC's unparalleled experience \n\nin consumer privacy enforcement has addressed practices offline, \n\nonline, and in the mobile environment by large, well-known companies \n\nand lesser-known players alike. Data security is an important focus of \n\nthe Commission's privacy work. Since 2002, the FTC has brought over 50 \n\ncases against companies that have engaged in unfair or deceptive \n\npractices that the Commission alleged put consumers' personal data at \n\nunreasonable risk.\n\n The Commission's recent policy initiatives to promote privacy \n\nincluded a three-part ``Spring Privacy Series'' \\4\\ that examined the \n\nprivacy implications of three new areas of technology or business \n\npractices that have garnered considerable attention for the possible \n\nprivacy concerns they raise for consumers.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\4\\ See press release ``FTC to Host Spring Seminars on Emerging \n\n\n\nConsumer Privacy Issues'' dated December 2, 2013, at http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/12/ftc-\nhost-spring-seminars-emerging-consumer-privacy-issues.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n The first event on February 19, 2014, focused on the \n\nprivacy and security implications of mobile device tracking, which \n\ninvolves physically tracking consumers in retail and other businesses \n\nusing signals from their smartphones.\n\n The second seminar on March 19, 2014, examined alternative \n\nscoring products, which are scores increasingly used by businesses for \n\na wide variety of purposes, ranging from identity verification and \n\nfraud prevention to marketing and advertising. The event discussed the \n\nprivacy ramifications of such predictive scores, which may fall outside \n\nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act.\n\n The final seminar on May 7, 2014, examined consumers' use \n\nof connected health and fitness devices that regularly collect \n\ninformation about them and may transmit this information to other \n\nentities.\n\n In November 2013, the Commission held a workshop entitled Internet \n\nof\n\n[[Page 76660]]\n\nThings--Privacy and Security in a Connected World to explore consumer \n\nprivacy and security issues posed by the growing connectivity of \n\nconsumer devices, such as cars, home appliances, and health and fitness \n\ndevices.\\5\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\5\\ See workshop agenda and conference description at http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events-\ncalendar/2013/11/internet-things-privacy-security-connected-world.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n (b) Protecting Children. Children increasingly use the Internet for \n\nentertainment, information and schoolwork. The Children's Online \n\nPrivacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the FTC's COPPA Rule protect \n\nchildren's privacy when they are online by putting their parents in \n\ncharge of who gets to collect personal information about their preteen \n\nkids. The FTC enforces COPPA by ensuring that parents have the tools \n\nthey need to protect their children's privacy.\n\n The Commission is actively litigating to protect children and their \n\nparents when children use mobile apps that appeal to children and offer \n\nvirtual goods for sale. On August 1, 2014, the FTC filed a court \n\ncomplaint alleging that Amazon.com, Inc. billed parents and other \n\naccount holders for millions of dollars in unauthorized in-app charges \n\nincurred by children.\\6\\ Amazon offers many children's apps in its app \n\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/12/ftc-host-spring-seminars-emerging-consumer-privacy-issues\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/12/ftc-host-spring-seminars-emerging-consumer-privacy-issues\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events-calendar/2013/11/internet-things-privacy-security-connected-world\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events-calendar/2013/11/internet-things-privacy-security-connected-world\n\n\nstore for download to mobile devices such as the Kindle Fire. The \n\nlawsuit seeks a court order requiring refunds to consumers for the \n\nunauthorized charges and permanently banning the company from billing \n\nparents and other account holders for in-app charges without their \n\nconsent. This is the FTC's third case relating to children's in-app \n\npurchases; Apple and Google both settled FTC complaints concerning the \n\nissue in 2014.\\7\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\6\\ FTC v. Amazon.com, Inc., No. 2:14-cv-01038 (W.D. Wash.) \n\n(Complaint For Permanent Injunction And Other Equitable Relief filed \n\non July 10, 2014).\n\n \\7\\ In the Matter of Apple Inc., Docket No. C-4444, Decision and \n\nOrder, March 25, 2014; In the Matter of Google Inc., Docket No. 122 \n\n3237, Proposed Agreement Containing Consent Order, September 4, \n\n2014.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n The Commission has issued an updated version of the popular free \n\nconsumer guide, ``Net Cetera: Chatting with Kids About Being Online.'' \n\n\\8\\ The revised publication contains updated information for parents \n\nand other adults to use when talking with kids about how to be safe, \n\nsecure and responsible online. The revision adds new topics that \n\nreflect changes in the online world since the guide was first issued in \n\n2009. In the revised booklet, adults can find advice on how to talk \n\nwith kids about mobile apps, using public Wi-Fi securely and how to \n\nrecognize text message spam. The booklet also includes information \n\nabout the recent changes to the COPPA Rule.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\8\\ See ``Net Cetera: Chatting with Kids About Being Online'' at \n\nhttp://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0001-netcetera.pdf.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n (c) Protecting Seniors. The Commission works vigilantly to fight \n\ntelephone scams that harm millions of Americans. The agency has \n\naggressively used law enforcement tools \\9\\ as well as efforts to \n\neducate consumers about these scams and to find technological solutions \n\nthat will make it more difficult for scammers to operate and hide from \n\nlaw enforcement. FTC education and outreach programs reach tens of \n\nmillions of people every year. Among them is the recently created \n\n``Pass It On'' program that provides seniors with information, in \n\nEnglish and Spanish, on a variety of scams targeting the elderly. The \n\nagency also works with the Elder Justice Coordinating Council to help \n\nhttp://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0001-netcetera.pdf\n\n\nprotect seniors and with the AARP Foundation, whose peer counselors \n\nprovided fraud-avoidance advice last year to more than a thousand \n\nseniors who had filed complaints with the FTC about certain frauds, \n\nincluding lottery, prize promotion, and grandparent scams. The \n\nCommission is also promoting initiatives to make it harder for scammers \n\nto fake or ``spoof'' their caller Identification information and the \n\nmore widespread availability of technology that will block calls from \n\nfraudsters, essentially operating as a spam filter for the telephone.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\9\\ The FTC has brought more than 130 cases involving \n\ntelemarketing fraud against more than 800 defendants during the past \n\ndecade.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n (d) Protecting Financially Distressed Consumers. Even as the \n\neconomy recovers, some consumers continue to face financial challenges. \n\nThe FTC acts to ensure that consumers are protected from deceptive and \n\nunfair credit practices and get the information they need to make \n\ninformed financial choices. The Commission has continued its \n\nenforcement efforts by bringing law enforcement actions to curb \n\ndeceptive and unfair practices in mortgage rescue, debt relief, auto \n\nfinancing and debt collection.\n\n In October 2014, the FTC also co-hosted a roundtable on debt \n\ncollection issues with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). \n\nThe roundtable specifically examined how debt collection issues affect \n\nLatino consumers, especially those who have limited English proficiency \n\n(LEP). The event brought together consumer advocates, industry \n\nrepresentatives, State and Federal regulators, and academics to \n\nexchange information on a range of issues. Topics included an overview \n\nof the Latino community, its finances, and the collectors who contact \n\nmembers of this community; pre-litigation collection from Latino \n\nconsumers; the experience of LEP Latinos in debt collection litigation; \n\ncredit reporting issues among LEP Latinos; and developing improved \n\nstrategies for educating and reaching out to LEP Latinos about debt \n\ncollection.\n\n (e) Ensuring Consumers Benefit from New Technologies While Also \n\nProtecting Them.\n\n Mobile Cramming. The widespread adoption of mobile devices \n\nhas provided many important benefits to consumers, including the \n\nconvenience of paying for goods and services using a mobile phone. \n\nRecently, the FTC has brought a number of law enforcement actions in \n\naddition to policy and education activities designed to combat mobile \n\n\n\ncramming that are part of the Commission's overall work to protect \n\nconsumers in the mobile environment. In the Commission's six mobile \n\ncramming cases brought since the spring of 2013, the three that have \n\nbeen fully or partially resolved have resulted in strong relief for \n\nconsumers. The agency has obtained judgments totaling more than $160 \n\nmillion, as well as court orders preventing the defendants from further \n\nillegal cramming. The Commission also has two ongoing cases against two \n\nother merchants who crammed charges onto consumers' bills, along with \n\nits case against wireless carrier T-Mobile filed earlier in July \n\n2014.\\10\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\10\\ FTC v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., No. 2:14-cv-00967 (W.D. Wash.) \n\n(Complaint For Permanent Injunction And Other Equitable Relief filed \n\non July 1, 2014).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Mobile Billing. One mobile payment option is known as \n\n``carrier billing''--the ability to charge a good or service directly \n\nto a mobile phone account. In a report issued on July 28, 2014, FTC \n\nstaff recommended steps that mobile carriers and other companies should \n\ntake to prevent consumers from being stuck with unauthorized charges on \n\ntheir mobile phone bills, an unlawful practice known as mobile \n\ncramming.\\11\\ FTC staff set out five recommended best practices for \n\nindustry participants to protect consumers against unwanted charges \n\nwhile enabling innovation and consumer access to another payment \n\nmechanism. The FTC will continue to monitor and, where appropriate, \n\ninvestigate industry participants--carriers, billing intermediaries, \n\nand merchants--involved in third-party\n\n[[Page 76661]]\n\nmobile billing and bring further enforcement actions. Further, the FTC \n\nwill continue to monitor the issue of cramming on mobile phone accounts \n\nand evaluate whether other potential solutions--including legislative \n\nmeasures and additional regulatory changes--are necessary to ensure \n\nconsumers are protected from unwanted and unauthorized charges.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\11\\ See ``Mobile Cramming: A Federal Trade Commission Staff \n\nReport (July 2014)'' at http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/mobile-cramming-federal-trade-\ncommission-staff-report-july-2014/140728mobilecramming.pdf.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Mobile Shopping Apps. A new staff report issued on August \n\n1, 2014, by the Commission finds that many mobile apps for use in \n\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/mobile-cramming-federal-trade-commission-staff-report-july-2014/140728mobilecramming.pdf\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/mobile-cramming-federal-trade-commission-staff-report-july-2014/140728mobilecramming.pdf\n\n\nshopping do not provide consumers with important information--such as \n\nhow the apps manage payment-related disputes or handle consumer data--\n\nprior to download. The report, ``What's the Deal? An FTC Study on \n\nMobile Shopping Apps,'' \\12\\ looked at some of the most popular apps \n\nused by consumers to comparison shop, collect and redeem deals and \n\ndiscounts, and pay in-store with their mobile devices. The report \n\nbuilds on the findings of the Commission's 2012 workshop on mobile \n\npayments and the report from that workshop, which raised concerns about \n\nconsumers' potential financial liability--as well as the privacy and \n\nsecurity of their data--when using mobile payment services. The report \n\nis part of the Commission's work to ensure that consumers are fully \n\nprotected in the growing mobile space, which has included workshops and \n\nother initiatives to study cutting-edge issues in this area, along with \n\na number of law enforcement cases.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\12\\ See ``What's the Deal? An FTC Study on Mobile Shopping Apps \n\n(August 2014)'' at http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/whats-deal-federal-trade-commission-study-\nmobile-shopping-apps-august-2014/140801mobileshoppingapps.pdf.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Use of Big Data. The Commission hosted a public workshop \n\nentitled ``Big Data: A Tool for Inclusion or Exclusion?'' on September \n\n15, 2014, which explored the use of ``big data'' and its impact on \n\nAmerican consumers, including low-income and underserved consumers. A \n\ngrowing number of companies are increasingly using big data analytics \n\ntechniques to categorize consumers and make predictions about their \n\nbehavior. As part of the FTC's ongoing work to shed light on the full \n\nscope of big data practices, the workshop examined the potentially \n\npositive and negative effects of big data on low income and underserved \n\npopulations.\n\n (f) Promoting Competition in Health Care. The FTC continues to work \n\nto eliminate anticompetitive settlements featuring payments by branded \n\ndrug firms to a generic competitor to keep generic drugs off the market \n\n(so-called, ``pay-for-delay'' agreements). It's a practice where the \n\npharmaceutical industry wins, but consumers lose. The brand company \n\nprotects its drug franchise, and the generic competitor shares in the \n\nmonopoly profits preserved by avoiding competition. The Commission \n\nsupports legislation to ban these harmful agreements while actively \n\nlitigating Federal court challenges to invalidate individual \n\nagreements. In a significant victory on June 17, 2013, the U.S. Supreme \n\nCourt reversed a lower court ruling and held that pay-for-delay \n\nagreements between brand and generic drug companies are subject to \n\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/whats-deal-federal-trade-commission-study-mobile-shopping-apps-august-2014/140801mobileshoppingapps.pdf\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/whats-deal-federal-trade-commission-study-mobile-shopping-apps-august-2014/140801mobileshoppingapps.pdf\n\n\nantitrust scrutiny under an antitrust ``rule of reason'' analysis. FTC \n\nv. Actavis, Inc., 570 U.S. 756 (2013). The FTC now has three active \n\npay-for-delay litigations underway in federal courts. Two of them \n\ninvolve the blockbuster male testosterone replacement drug Androgel, \n\nincluding the Actavis case on remand to the U.S. District Court for the \n\nNorthern District of Georgia and FTC v. AbbVie, Inc., in the U.S. \n\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\\13\\ The third, \n\nunderway in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of \n\nPennsylvania, FTC v. Cephalon, Inc., involves the billion-dollar \n\nnarcolepsy drug Provigil.\\14\\ However, solving this problem through the \n\ncourts will take considerable time, during which American consumers and \n\ngovernments will continue to pay high prices for prescription drugs.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\13\\ FTC v. AbbVie, Inc., No. 2:14-cv-05151-RK (E.D. Pa.) \n\n(Complaint For Injunctive And Other Equitable Relief filed on \n\nSeptember 8, 2014).\n\n \\14\\ FTC v. Cephalon, Inc., No. 2:08-CV-02141 (E.D. Pa.).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n The FTC also continues to vigorously challenge anticompetitive \n\nacquisitions in health care provider markets. For example, in January \n\n2014, a federal court in Idaho issued a permanent injunction enjoining \n\nSt. Luke's Health System's acquisition of Saltzer Medical Group, \n\nIdaho's largest independent, multi-specialty physician practice group, \n\nand requiring full divestiture of Saltzer's physicians and assets in an \n\naction brought by the FTC, together with the Idaho Attorney General. \n\nThe complaint charged that the combination of St. Luke's employed \n\nprimary care physicians and Saltzer's physicians would give the merged \n\nfirm the market power to demand higher rates for primary care physician \n\nservices in Nampa, Idaho, and surrounding areas. This case is on \n\nappeal. Moreover, in April 2014, in the first appellate decision in a \n\nhealth care provider merger in 15 years, the U.S. Court of Appeals for \n\nthe Sixth Circuit upheld the Commission's 2012 decision finding that \n\nProMedica Health System, Inc. acquisition of a rival, St. Luke's \n\nHospital in the Toledo, Ohio area, violated the antitrust laws. The \n\nCommission's order requires ProMedica to divest St. Luke's Hospital to \n\nan FTC-approved buyer.\n\n (g) Fostering Innovation & Competition. For more than two decades, \n\nthe Commission has examined difficult issues at the intersection of \n\nantitrust and intellectual property law--issues related to innovation, \n\nstandard-setting, and patents. The Commission's work in this area is \n\ngrounded in the recognition that intellectual property and competition \n\nlaws share the fundamental goals of promoting innovation and consumer \n\n\n\nwelfare. The Commission has authored several seminal reports on \n\ncompetition and patent law and conducted workshops to learn more about \n\nemerging practices and trends.\n\n For instance, the FTC and DOJ held a joint workshop in December \n\n2012 to explore the impact of patent assertion entity (PAE) activities \n\n\\15\\ and encouraged efforts of the Patent Trade Office to provide the \n\npublic with more complete information regarding patent ownership.\\16\\ \n\nThe FTC and DOJ also received public comments in conjunction with the \n\nworkshop. While workshop panelists and commenters identified potential \n\nharms and efficiencies of PAE activity, they noted a lack of empirical \n\ndata in this area and recommended that FTC use its authority under \n\nSection 6(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. After public notice \n\nand comment, on August 8, 2014, the Commission received authority from \n\nthe Office of Management and Budget to issue compulsory process orders \n\nto PAEs and other industry participants for the purpose of gathering \n\ninformation to examine how PAEs do business and develop a better \n\nunderstanding of how they impact innovation and competition.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\15\\ See press release ``Federal Trade Commission, Department of \n\nJustice to Hold Workshop on Patent Assertion Entity Activities'' \n\ndated November 19, 2012, at http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2012/11/paeworkshop.shtm.\n\n \\16\\ See Comments of the Antitrust Division of the United States \n\nDepartment of Justice And the United States Federal Trade \n\nCommission, February 1, 2013, Before the United States Department of \n\nCommerce Patent and Trademark Office, In the Matter of Notice of \n\nRoundtable on Proposed Requirements for Recordation of Real-Party-\n\nin-Interest Information Throughout Application Pendency and Patent \n\nTerm, Docket No. PTO-P-2012-0047, at            http://www.ftc.gov/os/2013/02/130201pto-rpi-comment.pdf.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n (h) Alcohol Advertising. On February 1, 2012, the Office of \n\nManagement and Budget (OMB) gave the Commission\n\n[[Page 76662]]\n\napproval, under the Paperwork Reduction Act, to issue compulsory \n\nprocess orders to up to 14 alcohol companies. On April 16, 2012, the \n\nCommission issued the orders, seeking information on company brands, \n\nsales, and marketing expenses; compliance with advertising placement \n\ncodes; and use of social media and other digital marketing.\\17\\ On \n\nMarch 20, 2014, the Commission released a report, setting forth the \n\nresults of its study.\\18\\ The Commission also continues to promote the \n\n``We Don't Serve Teens'' consumer education program, supporting the \n\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/opa/2012/11/paeworkshop.shtm\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/os/2013/02/130201pto-rpi-comment.pdf\n\n\nlegal drinking age.\\19\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\17\\ A copy of the order, a list of the target companies, and \n\nthe press release are available online at http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2012/04/alcoholstudy.shtm.\n\n \\18\\ See Self-Regulation in the Alcohol Industry (March 2014), \n\navailable at            http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/self-regulation-alcohol-industry-report-federal-\ntrade-commission/140320alcoholreport.pdf.\n\n \\19\\ More information can be found at            http://www.dontserveteens.gov/.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n (i) Gasoline Prices. Given the impact of energy prices on consumer \n\nbudgets, the energy sector continues to be a major focus of FTC law \n\nenforcement and study. In November 2009, the FTC's Petroleum Market \n\nManipulation Rule became final.\\20\\ Our staff continues to examine all \n\ncommunications from the public about potential violations of this Rule, \n\nwhich prohibits manipulation in wholesale markets for crude oil, \n\ngasoline, and petroleum distillates. Other activities complement these \n\nefforts, including merger enforcement and an agreement with the \n\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission to share investigative \n\ninformation. In view of the fundamental importance of oil, natural gas, \n\nand other energy resources to the overall vitality of the United States \n\nand world economy, we expect that FTC review and oversight of the oil \n\nand natural gas industries will remain a centerpiece of our work for \n\nyears to come.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\20\\ 16 CFR part 317; See press release: ``New FTC Rule \n\nProhibits Petroleum Market Manipulation'' (Aug. 6, 2009), available \n\nat http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/08/mmr.shtm; ``FTC Issues Compliance \n\nGuide for Its Petroleum Market Manipulation Regulations,'' News \n\nRelease (Nov. 13, 2009), available at            http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/11/mmr.shtm.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n (j) Fraud Surveys. The FTC's Bureau of Economics (BE) continues to \n\nconduct fraud surveys and related research on consumer susceptibility \n\nto fraud. For example, BE conducted an exploratory experimental study \n\nin a university economics laboratory to see whether we could identify \n\ncharacteristics of consumers who might be more likely to fall victim to \n\nfraud. A second exploratory study of susceptibility to fraud was \n\nconducted using an Internet panel. The results of that study are \n\ncurrently being analyzed. The most recent survey of the incidence of \n\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/opa/2012/04/alcoholstudy.shtm\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/self-regulation-alcohol-industry-report-federal-trade-commission/140320alcoholreport.pdf\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/self-regulation-alcohol-industry-report-federal-trade-commission/140320alcoholreport.pdf\nhttp://www.dontserveteens.gov/\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/08/mmr.shtm;\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/11/mmr.shtm\n\n\nconsumer fraud was conducted between late November 2011 and early \n\nFebruary 2012, and a report describing the findings was released in \n\nApril 2013. The results of these efforts may aid the FTC to better \n\ntarget its enforcement actions and consumer education initiatives and \n\nimprove future fraud surveys.\n\n (k) Protecting Consumers from Cross-Border Harm. The FTC continues \n\nto focus on combatting cross-border violations of law that affect \n\nconsumers. For example, this year the Commission approved fourteen \n\nsettlements with U.S. businesses that had falsely claimed they were \n\nabiding by an international privacy framework known as the U.S.-\n\nEuropean Union Safe Harbor that enables U.S. companies to transfer \n\nconsumer data from the European Union (EU) to the United States in \n\ncompliance with EU law.\\21\\ Additionally, the FTC, with the help of \n\ncounterparts in Canada, Slovakia, and Austria, brought an action \n\nagainst a notorious multi-million dollar international business \n\ndirectory scam in FTC v. Construct Data.\\22\\ Building on the FTC's work \n\nwith African consumer agencies, the FTC signed a memorandum of \n\nunderstanding (MOU) with Nigeria's Consumer Protection Council and its \n\nEconomic and Financial Crimes Commission.\\23\\ It is the first FTC MOU \n\nof this kind to include a foreign criminal enforcement authority.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\21\\ See press release ``FTC Approves Final Orders Settling \n\nCharges of U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Violations Against 14 Companies'' \n\ndated June 25, 2014, at http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/06/ftc-approves-final-orders-settling-\ncharges-us-eu-safe-harbor.\n\n \\22\\ FTC v. Construct Data Publishers, a.s. d/b/a Fair Guide, \n\nCivil Action Number: 13 cv 1999 (N.D. Ill.) Default Judgment and \n\nOrder for Permanent Injunction and Other Equitable Relief Against \n\nConstruct Data Publishers A.S., Wolfgang Valvoda, and Susanne Anhorn \n\n(March 7, 2014).\n\n \\23\\ See press release ``FTC Signs Memorandum of Understanding \n\nwith Nigerian Consumer Protection and Criminal Enforcement \n\nAuthorities'' dated August 28, 2013, at            http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/08/ftc-signs-\nmemorandum-understanding-nigerian-consumer-protection.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n The FTC strives to promote sound approaches to common problems by \n\nbuilding relationships with sister agencies around the world. With over \n\n130 jurisdictions enforcing competition laws, the FTC continues to lead \n\nefforts to develop strong mutual enforcement cooperation and sound \n\npolicy with its international partners. We continue to strengthen \n\ncooperation and coordination with agencies to reach compatible results \n\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/06/ftc-approves-final-orders-settling-charges-us-eu-safe-harbor\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/06/ftc-approves-final-orders-settling-charges-us-eu-safe-harbor\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/08/ftc-signs-memorandum-understanding-nigerian-consumer-protection\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/08/ftc-signs-memorandum-understanding-nigerian-consumer-protection\n\n\non cases of mutual interest, such as Thermo Fisher/Life Technologies, \n\nin which the FTC recently cooperated with antitrust agencies in nine \n\njurisdictions to reach consistent results.\\24\\ We also work to develop \n\nimproved tools to facilitate cooperation. This year, FTC and Department \n\nof Justice Antitrust Division staff jointly released a model waiver of \n\nconfidentiality that is designed to streamline the waiver negotiation \n\nprocess, facilitating deeper communication between cooperating \n\nagencies.\\25\\ During the past year the FTC held bilateral meetings with \n\nkey partners, including competition agencies in the EU, Canada, Mexico, \n\nJapan, China and India, and continued to play a lead role in the \n\nInternational Competition Network, including co-leading the Agency \n\nEffectiveness Working Group and its Investigative Process Project.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\24\\ See press release ``FTC Puts Conditions on Thermo Fisher \n\nScientific Inc.'s Proposed Acquisition of Life Technologies \n\nCorporation'' dated January 31, 2014, at http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/01/ftc-puts-\nconditions-thermo-fisher-scientific-incs-proposed.\n\n \\25\\ See press release ``Federal Trade Commission and Justice \n\nDepartment Issue Updated Model Waiver of Confidentiality for \n\nInternational Civil Matters and Accompanying FAQ'' dated September \n\n25, 2013, at            http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/09/federal-trade-commission-and-justice-\ndepartment-issue-updated.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n (l) Self-Regulatory and Compliance Initiatives With Industry. The \n\nCommission continues to engage industry in compliance partnerships in \n\nthe funeral and franchise industries. Specifically, the Commission's \n\nFuneral Rule Offender Program, conducted in partnership with the \n\nNational Funeral Directors Association, is designed to educate funeral \n\nhome operators found in violation of the requirements of the Funeral \n\nRule, 16 CFR 453, so that they can meet the rule's disclosure \n\nrequirements. Almost 460 funeral homes have participated in the program \n\nsince its inception in 1996. In addition, the Commission established \n\nthe Franchise Rule Alternative Law Enforcement Program in partnership \n\nwith the International Franchise Association (IFA), a nonprofit \n\norganization that represents both franchisors and franchisees. This \n\nprogram is designed to assist franchisors found to have a minor or \n\ntechnical violation of the Franchise Rule, 16 CFR 436, in complying \n\nwith the rule. Violations involving fraud or other section 5 violations \n\nare not candidates for referral to the program. The IFA teaches the \n\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/01/ftc-puts-conditions-thermo-fisher-scientific-incs-proposed\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/01/ftc-puts-conditions-thermo-fisher-scientific-incs-proposed\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/09/federal-trade-commission-and-justice-department-issue-updated\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/09/federal-trade-commission-and-justice-department-issue-updated\n\n\nfranchisor how to comply with the rule and monitors its business for a \n\nperiod of years. Where appropriate, the program offers franchisees the \n\nopportunity to mediate claims arising from the law violations. Since \n\nDecember\n\n[[Page 76663]]\n\n1998, 21 companies have agreed to participate in the program.\n\nRulemakings and Studies Required by Statute\n\n Congress has enacted laws requiring the Commission to undertake \n\nrulemakings and studies. This section discusses required rules and \n\nstudies. The final actions section below describes actions taken on the \n\nrequired rulemakings and studies since the 2013 Regulatory Plan was \n\npublished.\n\n FACTA Rules. The Commission has issued all of the rules required by \n\nFACTA (Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act). These rules are \n\ncodified in several parts of 16 CFR 602 et seq., amending or \n\nsupplementing regulations relating to the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\n\n FACTA Studies. On March 27, 2009, the Commission issued compulsory \n\ninformation requests to the nine largest private providers of homeowner \n\ninsurance in the nation. The purpose was to help the FTC collect data \n\nfor its study on the effects of credit-based scores in the homeowner \n\ninsurance market, a study mandated by section 215 of the FACTA. During \n\nthe summer of 2009, these nine insurers submitted responses to the \n\nCommission's requests. FTC staff has reviewed the large policy-level \n\ndata files included in these submissions and has identified a sample \n\nset of data to be used for the study. The insurance companies then \n\nworked with their vendor to ensure the security of delivering the data \n\nset to the FTC's own and separate vendor. That data was sent to the \n\nFTC's vendor, which then sent the data, stripped of any personally \n\nidentifiable information, to the FTC. The FTC's vendor also sent other \n\ndata to the Social Security Administration (SSA), which will provide \n\nthe FTC with additional data for the Report. The FTC hopes to receive \n\nthe SSA data soon. Staff expects the Report will be submitted to \n\nCongress during the spring of 2015. This study is not affected by the \n\nConsumer Financial Protection Act.\n\n Section 319 of FACTA requires the FTC to study the accuracy and \n\ncompleteness of information in consumers' credit reports and to \n\nconsider methods for improving the accuracy and completeness of such \n\ninformation. Section 319 of the Act also requires the Commission to \n\nissue a series of biennial reports to Congress over a period of 11 \n\nyears. The Commission's December 2012 report to Congress on credit \n\n\n\nreporting accuracy focused on identifying potential errors that could \n\nhave a material effect on a person's credit standing. Any participants \n\nwho identified a potentially material error on their report were \n\nencouraged to dispute the erroneous information. The study found that \n\n26 percent of consumers reported a potential material error on one or \n\nmore of their three reports and filed a dispute with at least one \n\ncredit reporting agency (CRA), and half of these consumers experienced \n\na change in their credit scores. For five percent of consumers, the \n\nerrors on their credit reports could lead to them paying more for \n\nproducts such as auto loans and insurance. Congress instructed the FTC \n\nto complete this study by December 2014, when a final report is due.\n\nRetrospective Review of Existing Regulations\n\n In 1992, the Commission implemented a program to review its rules \n\nand guides regularly. The Commission's review program is patterned \n\nafter provisions in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612. \n\nUnder the Commission's program, rules are reviewed on a 10-year \n\nschedule. For many rules, this has resulted in more frequent reviews \n\nthan are generally required by section 610 of the Regulatory \n\nFlexibility Act. This program is also broader than the review \n\ncontemplated under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, in that it provides \n\nthe Commission with an ongoing systematic approach for seeking \n\ninformation about the costs and benefits of its rules and guides and \n\nwhether there are changes that could minimize any adverse economic \n\neffects, not just a ``significant economic impact upon a substantial \n\nnumber of small entities.'' 5 U.S.C. 610.\n\n As part of its continuing 10-year review plan, the Commission \n\nexamines the effect of rules and guides on small businesses and on the \n\nmarketplace in general. These reviews may lead to the revision or \n\nrescission of rules and guides to ensure that the Commission's consumer \n\nprotection and competition goals are achieved efficiently and at the \n\nleast cost to business. In a number of instances, the Commission has \n\ndetermined that existing rules and guides were no longer necessary or \n\nin the public interest. Most of the matters currently under review \n\npertain to consumer protection and are intended to ensure that \n\nconsumers receive the information necessary to evaluate competing \n\nproducts and make informed purchasing decisions. Pursuant to this \n\nprogram, the Commission has rescinded 37 rules and guides promulgated \n\nunder the FTC's general authority and updated dozens of others since \n\nthe early 1990s.\n\n\n\n In light of Executive Orders 13563 and 13579, the FTC continues to \n\ntake a fresh look at its long-standing regulatory review process. The \n\nCommission is taking a number of steps to ease burdens on business and \n\npromote transparency in its regulatory review program:\n\n The Commission recently issued a revised 10-year review \n\nschedule (see next paragraph below) and is accelerating the review of a \n\nnumber of rules and guides in response to recent changes in technology \n\nand the marketplace. The Commission is currently reviewing 20 of the 65 \n\nrules and guides within its jurisdiction.\n\n The Commission continues to request and review public \n\ncomments on the effectiveness of its regulatory review program and \n\nsuggestions for its improvement.\n\n The FTC maintains a Web page at http://www.ftc.gov/regreview that serves as a one-stop shop for the public to \nobtain \n\ninformation and provide comments on individual rules and guides under \n\nreview as well as the Commission's regulatory review program generally.\n\n In addition, the Commission's 10-year periodic review schedule \n\nincludes initiating reviews for the following rules and guides (79 FR \n\n14199, March 13, 2014) during 2014 and 2015:\n\n (1) Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information, 16 CFR 314,\n\n (2) Contact Lens Rule, 16 CFR 315,\n\n (3) CAN-SPAM Rule, 16 CFR 316, and\n\n (4) Ophthalmic Practice Rules (Eyeglass Rule), 16 CFR 456.\n\n As set out below under Ongoing Rule and Guide Reviews, the \n\nCommission recently initiated reviews of the Telemarketing Sales Rule \n\n(TSR), 16 CFR 308, and the Hobby Rules, 16 CFR 304.\n\nOngoing Rule and Guide Reviews\n\n The Commission is continuing review of a number of rules and \n\nguides, which are discussed below.\n\n(a) Rules\n\n Premerger Notification Rules and Report Form (or HSR Rules), 16 CFR \n\n801-803. The Premerger Office is considering recommending amendments to \n\nthe HSR Rules regarding standards for the valuation of potentially \n\nreportable transactions, regarding the instructions to the HSR Form to \n\nupdate information related to NAICS (North American Industry \n\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/regreview\n\n\nClassification System) codes, recent rule changes, and a change of \n\naddress for delivery of filings to the FTC Premerger Office. The \n\nproposed amendments may be issued during the first quarter of 2015. The \n\nPremerger Office is also considering amendments to the Instructions to \n\nthe HSR Form to update information related to NAICS codes and\n\n[[Page 76664]]\n\nrecent rule changes and allow the submission of filings on electronic \n\nmedia.\\26\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\26\\ See Final Actions for information about a separate final \n\nrule proceeding for HSR Rules.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Fuel Rating Rule, 16 CFR 306. First issued in 1979, the Fuel Rating \n\nRule (or Automotive Fuel Ratings, Certification and Posting Rule) \n\nenables consumers to buy gasoline with an appropriate octane rating for \n\ntheir vehicle and establishes standard procedures for determining, \n\ncertifying, and posting octane ratings. On March 27, 2014, the \n\nCommission proposed amendments to the Rule that would adopt and revise \n\nrating, certification, and labeling requirements for blends of gasoline \n\nwith more than 10 percent ethanol and would allow an alternative octane \n\nrating method that would lower compliance costs. 79 FR 18850. The \n\ncomment period closed on July 2, 2014. Staff is reviewing comments and \n\nanticipates sending a recommendation to the Commission by the end of \n\nthe first quarter of 2015.\n\n Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR), 16 CFR 308. Anti-Fraud Provisions--\n\nCommission staff are considering proposed ``Anti-Fraud'' amendments to \n\nthe TSR concerning, among other things, the misuse of novel payment \n\nmethods by telemarketers and sellers. On May 21, 2013, the Commission \n\nissued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``NPRM''), which was published \n\nin the Federal Register on July 9, 2013. 78 FR 41200. After a short \n\nextension, the comment period closed on August 8, 2013. Commission \n\nstaff is reviewing the comments submitted in response to the NPRM, and \n\nanticipates making a recommendation to the Commission by the end of \n\n2014.\n\n Periodic Rule Review--On August 11, 2014, Commission initiated \n\nperiodic review of the TSR as set out on the 10-year review schedule. \n\n79 FR 46732. The comment period as extended will close on November 13, \n\n2014. 79 FR 61267 (Oct. 10, 2014).\n\n Hobby Rules, 16 CFR 304. As part of the systematic rule review \n\n\n\nprocess, on July 14, 2014, the Commission requested public comments on, \n\namong other things, the economic impact and benefits of the Hobby Rules \n\n(Rules and Regulations under the Hobby Protection Act); possible \n\nconflict between the Rules and State, local, or other Federal laws or \n\nregulations; and the effect on the Rules of any technological, \n\neconomic, or other industry changes. 79 FR 40691. The comment period \n\nclosed on September 22, 2014. The Hobby Protection Act, 16 U.S.C. 2101-\n\n2106, prohibits manufacturing or importing imitation numismatic and \n\ncollectible political items unless they are marked in accordance with \n\nregulations prescribed by the Federal Trade Commission. The \n\nimplementing Rules prescribe that imitation political items--such as \n\nbuttons, posters or coffee mugs--must be marked with the calendar year \n\nin which they were manufactured, and imitation numismatic items--\n\nincluding coins, tokens and paper money--must be marked with the word \n\n``copy.'' Staff anticipates sending a recommendation to the Commission \n\nby May 2015.\n\n The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (``FPLA'') Rules, 16 CFR 500-\n\n502. The FPLA requires consumer commodities to be marked with \n\nstatements of: (1) Identity; (2) net quantity of contents; and (3) name \n\nand place of the business of manufacturer, packer, or distributor. \n\nThese requirements serve FPLA's stated purpose of ``enabling consumers \n\nto obtain accurate information as to the quantity of the contents and . \n\n. . to facilitate value comparisons.'' As part of its ongoing \n\nsystematic review process, the Commission requested comments on March \n\n19, 2014, regarding, among other things, the economic impact and \n\nbenefits of the FPLA Rules; possible conflict between the Rules and \n\nState, local, or other Federal laws or regulations; and the effect on \n\nthe Rules of any technological, economic, or other industry changes. \n\nThe comment period closed on May 21, 2014. Staff is reviewing the \n\ncomments and anticipates forwarding a recommendation to the Commission \n\nby the end of 2014.\n\n Care Labeling Rule, 16 CFR 423. Promulgated in 1971, the Rule on \n\nCare Labeling of Textile Apparel and Certain Piece Goods as Amended \n\n(the Care Labeling Rule) makes it an unfair or deceptive act or \n\npractice for manufacturers and importers of textile wearing apparel and \n\ncertain piece goods to sell these items without attaching care labels \n\nstating ``what regular care is needed for the ordinary use of the \n\nproduct.'' The Rule also requires that the manufacturer or importer \n\n\n\npossess, prior to sale, a reasonable basis for the care instructions \n\nand allows the use of approved care symbols in lieu of words to \n\ndisclose care instructions. After reviewing the comments from a \n\nperiodic rule review (76 FR 41148; July 13, 2011), the Commission \n\nconcluded on September 20, 2012, that the Rule continued to benefit \n\nconsumers and would be retained, and sought comments on potential \n\nupdates to the Rule, including changes that would: Allow garment \n\nmanufacturers and marketers to include instructions for professional \n\nwetcleaning on labels; permit the use of ASTM Standard D5489-07, \n\n``Standard Guide for Care Symbols for Care Instructions on Textile \n\nProducts,'' or ISO 3758:2005(E), ``Textiles--Care labeling code using \n\nsymbols,'' in lieu of terms; clarify what can constitute a reasonable \n\nbasis for care instructions; and update the definition of ``dryclean.'' \n\n77 FR 58338. On March 28, 2014, the Commission hosted a public \n\nroundtable in Washington, DC, that analyzed proposed changes to the \n\nRule. Staff anticipates forwarding a recommendation to the Commission \n\naction during early 2015.\n\n Used Car Rule, 16 CFR 455. The Used Motor Vehicle Trade Regulation \n\nRule (``Used Car Rule''), 16 CFR 455, sets out the general duties of a \n\nused vehicle dealer; requires that a completed Buyers Guide be posted \n\nat all times on the side window of each used car a dealer offers for \n\nsale; and mandates disclosure of whether the vehicle is covered by a \n\ndealer warranty and, if so, the type and duration of the warranty \n\ncoverage, or whether the vehicle is being sold ``as is-no warranty.'' \n\nThe Commission published a notice seeking public comments on the \n\neffectiveness and impact of the rule. See 73 FR 42285 (July 21, 2008). \n\nThe comment period, as extended and then reopened, ended on June 15, \n\n2009. In response to comments, the Commission published a Notice of \n\nProposed Rulemaking on December 17, 2012 (See 77 FR 74746) and a final \n\nrule revising the Spanish translation of the window form on December \n\n12, 2012. See 77 FR 73912. The extended comment period on the NPRM \n\nended on March 13, 2012. The Commission is currently considering \n\nstaff's recommendation relating to the next step in this rulemaking.\n\n Consumer Warranty Rules, 16 CFR 701-703. The Rule Governing the \n\nDisclosure of Written Consumer Product Warranty Terms and Conditions \n\n(Rule 701) establishes requirements for warrantors for disclosing the \n\nterms and conditions of written warranties on consumer products \n\nactually costing the consumer more than $15.00. The Rule Governing the \n\n\n\nPre-Sale Availability of Written Warranty Terms, 16 CFR part 702 (Rule \n\n702) requires sellers and warrantors to make the terms of a written \n\nwarranty available to the consumer prior to sale. The Rule Governing \n\nInformal Dispute Settlement Procedures (IDSM) (Rule 703) establishes \n\nminimum requirements for those informal dispute settlement mechanisms \n\nthat are incorporated by the warrantor into its consumer product \n\nwarranty. By incorporating the IDSM into the warranty, the warrantor \n\nrequires the consumer to use the IDSM before pursuing any legal \n\nremedies in\n\n[[Page 76665]]\n\ncourt. On August 23, 2011, as part of its ongoing systematic review of \n\nall FTC rules and guides, the Commission requested comments on, among \n\nother things, the economic impact and benefits of these Rules, Guides, \n\nand Interpretations; \\27\\ possible conflict between the Rules, Guides, \n\nand Interpretations and state, local, or other federal laws or \n\nregulations; and the effect on the Rules, Guides, and Interpretations \n\nof any technological, economic, or other industry changes. See 76 FR \n\n52596. The comment period closed on October 24, 2011. Staff anticipates \n\nsending a recommendation to the Commission by the fall of 2014.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\27\\ The Federal Register Notice also announced the review of \n\nthe related Guides for the Advertising of Warranties and Guarantees, \n\n16 CFR 239, and the Interpretations of Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, \n\n16 CFR 700.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Cooling-Off Rule, 16 CFR 429. The Cooling-Off Rule requires that a \n\nconsumer be given a 3-day right to cancel certain sales greater than \n\n$25.00 that occur at a place other than a seller's place of business. \n\nThe rule also requires a seller to notify buyers orally of the right to \n\ncancel, to provide buyers with a dated receipt or copy of the contract \n\ncontaining the name and address of the seller and notice of \n\ncancellation rights, and to provide buyers with forms which buyers may \n\nuse to cancel the contract. As part of its systematic regulatory review \n\nprocess and following public comment, the Commission announced that it \n\nwas retaining the Cooling-Off Rule and proposed increasing its $25 \n\nexclusionary limit to $130 to account for inflation. 78 FR 3855 (Jan. \n\n17, 2013). The comment period closed on March 4, 2013. Staff reviewed \n\n\n\nthe comments, and the Commission is currently reviewing its \n\nrecommendation.\n\n Unavailability Rule, 16 CFR 424. The Unavailability Rule states \n\nthat it is a violation of section 5 of the FTC Act for retail stores of \n\nfood, groceries, or other merchandise to advertise products for sale at \n\na stated price if those stores do not have the advertised products in \n\nstock and readily available to customers during the effective period of \n\nthe advertisement, unless the advertisement clearly discloses that \n\nsupplies of the advertised products are limited or are available only \n\nat some outlets. This Rule is intended to benefit consumers by ensuring \n\nthat advertised items are available, that advertising-induced \n\npurchasing trips are not fruitless, and that store prices accurately \n\nreflect the prices appearing in the ads. On August 12, 2011, the \n\nCommission announced an ANPRM and a request for comment on the Rule as \n\npart of its systematic periodic review of current rules. The comment \n\nperiod closed on October 19, 2011. Staff has reviewed the comments and \n\nexpects to submit a recommendation to the Commission by the winter of \n\n2015.\n\n(b) Guides\n\n Jewelry Guides, 16 CFR 23. The Commission sought public comments on \n\nits Guides for the Jewelry, Precious Metals, and Pewter Industries, \n\nwhich are commonly known as the Jewelry Guides. 77 FR 39202 (July 2, \n\n2012). Since completing its last review of the Jewelry Guides in 1996, \n\nthe Commission revised sections of the Guides and addressed other \n\nissues raised in petitions from jewelry trade associations. The Guides \n\nexplain to businesses how to avoid making deceptive claims about \n\nprecious metal, pewter, diamond, gemstone, and pearl products and when \n\nthey should make disclosures to avoid unfair or deceptive trade \n\npractices. The comment period initially set to close on August 27, \n\n2012, was subsequently extended until September 28, 2012. Staff also \n\nconducted a public roundtable to examine possible modifications to the \n\nGuides in June 2013. Staff is currently reviewing the record, including \n\ncomments and the roundtable transcript.\n\n Used Auto Parts Guides, 16 CFR 20. On July 14, 2014, the Commission \n\ncompleted its review of the Guides for the Rebuilt, Reconditioned and \n\nOther Used Automobile Parts Industry (Used Auto Parts Guides or \n\nGuides), which are designed to prevent the unfair or deceptive \n\nmarketing of used motor vehicle parts and assemblies, such as engines \n\nand transmissions, containing used parts. 79 FR 40623. The Guides \n\nprohibit misrepresentations that a part is new or about the condition, \n\nextent of previous use, reconstruction, or repair of a part. Previously \n\n\n\nused parts must be clearly and conspicuously identified as such in \n\nadvertising and packaging and, if the part appears new, on the part \n\nitself. In May 2012, the Commission sought public comments on the Used \n\nAuto Parts Guides. 77 FR 29922. After considering the comments, the \n\nCommission decided to retain and amend the Guides. Significant \n\namendments include providing that the term ``remanufactured,'' like the \n\nterm ``factory rebuilt,'' should be used only if the product was \n\nrebuilt ``at a factory generally engaged in the rebuilding of such \n\nproducts;'' applying the Guides to used tires; and shortening and \n\nupdating the sample list of parts that may be industry products.\n\nFinal Actions\n\n Since the publication of the 2013 Regulatory Plan, the Commission \n\nhas issued the following final rules or taken other actions to close \n\nother rulemaking proceedings.\n\n Mail or Telephone Order Merchandise Rule, 16 CFR 435. The Mail or \n\nTelephone Order Rule requires that, when sellers advertise merchandise, \n\nthey must have a reasonable basis for stating or implying that they can \n\nship within a certain time. On September 11, 2014, the Commission \n\nannounced it was adopting final amendments to its Trade Regulation Rule \n\npreviously entitled ``Mail or Telephone Order Merchandise,'' including \n\nrevising its name to ``Mail, Internet, or Telephone Order Merchandise'' \n\n(the ``Rule''). 79 FR 55615 (Sept. 17, 2014). The final rule is based \n\nupon the comments received in response to an Advance Notice of Proposed \n\nRulemaking, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, a Staff Report, and other \n\ninformation. Other final amendments clarify that the Rule covers all \n\norders placed over the Internet; revise the Rule to allow sellers to \n\nprovide refunds and refund notices by any means at least as fast and \n\nreliable as first class mail; clarify sellers' obligations when buyers \n\nuse payment systems not enumerated in the Rule; and require that \n\nrefunds be made within seven working days for purchases made using \n\nthird-party credit cards. The final rule is effective on December 8, \n\n2014.\n\n Wool Rules, 16 CFR 300. On June 4, 2014, the Commission amended the \n\nWool Rules (Rules and Regulations Under The Wool Products Labeling Act \n\nof 1939) to conform to the 2006 amendments to the Wool Suit Fabric \n\nLabeling Fairness and International Standards Conforming Act (the Wool \n\nAct) and the amended Textile Rules. The changes included incorporating \n\n\n\nthe Wool Act's new definitions for cashmere and very fine wools, \n\nclarifying descriptions of products containing virgin or new wool, and \n\nallowing certain hang-tags disclosing fiber trademarks and performance \n\neven if they do not disclose the product's full fiber content. The \n\namended Rules were effective on July 7, 2014.\n\n Fur Rules, 16 CFR 301. The Commission published amendments to the \n\nFur Rules (or Rules and Regulations under the Fur Products Labeling \n\nAct) on May 28, 2014, to update the Fur Products Name Guide, provide \n\nmore labeling flexibility, incorporate Truth in Fur Labeling Act \n\nprovisions, and conform the guaranty provisions to those governing the \n\nRules under the Textile Fiber Products Identification\n\n[[Page 76666]]\n\nAct. 79 FR 30445. The amendments are effective November 19, 2014. More \n\nspecifically, the changes eliminate unnecessary requirements on \n\ncompanies that sell fur products to give them more flexibility on \n\nlabeling, update the Fur Products Name Guide that lists common animal \n\nnames allowed on fur labels, incorporate provisions of a fur labeling \n\nlaw passed by Congress in 2010, the Truth in Fur Labeling Act of 2010 \n\n(``TFLA''), including the elimination of the Commission's discretion to \n\nexempt fur products of ``relatively small quantity or value'' from \n\ndisclosure requirements; and providing that the Fur Act would not apply \n\nto products covered by the hunter/trapper exemption.\n\n Textile Labeling Rules, 16 CFR 303. These Rules implement Textile \n\nFiber Identification Act requirements that apparel and other covered \n\nhousehold textile articles be marked with (1) the generic names and \n\npercentages by weight of the constituent fibers present in the textile \n\nfiber product; (2) the name under which the manufacturer or another \n\nresponsible USA company does business, or in lieu thereof, the \n\nregistered identification number (RIN) of such a company; and (3) the \n\nname of the country where the textile product was processed or \n\nmanufactured. After notice and comment, the Commission amended the \n\nRules on April 4, 2014, to clarify and update its provisions and \n\nprovide more flexibility, giving businesses more compliance options \n\nwithout imposing significant new obligations. 79 FR 18766.\n\n Premerger Notification Rules and Report Form (or HSR Rules), 16 CFR \n\n801-803. On April 25, 2014, the Commission, in conjunction with the \n\nDepartment of Justice's Antitrust Division, issued amendments to the \n\n\n\nHSR Rules, updating the Instructions to the HSR Form with the address \n\nfor the Premerger Office's new location in the Constitution Center. The \n\neffective date of the new address was May 6, 2014. 79 FR 25662.\n\n Prenotification Negative Option Rule, 16 CFR 425. On July 25, 2014, \n\nthe Commission announced it was closing the periodic Regulatory Review \n\nand retaining the Negative Option Rule (the Trade Regulation Rule on \n\nPrenotification Negative Option Plans) as currently written. 79 FR \n\n44271 (July 31, 2014). The Negative Option Rule governs the operation \n\nof prenotification subscription plans. Under these plans, sellers ship \n\nmerchandise automatically to their subscribers and bill them for the \n\nmerchandise within a prescribed time. The Negative Option Rule protects \n\nconsumers by requiring the disclosure of the terms of membership \n\nclearly and conspicuously and establishes procedures for administering \n\nthe subscription plans.\n\n Energy Labeling Rule, 16 CFR 305. On April 9, 2014, the Commission \n\nissued conforming amendments to the Rule requiring a new Department of \n\nEnergy (``DOE'') test procedure for televisions and establishing data \n\nreporting requirements for those products. 79 FR 19464.\\28\\\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\28\\ See Ongoing Rule and Guide Reviews for information about a \n\nseparate ongoing rulemaking proceeding for the Energy Labeling Rule.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 CFR 310. Caller ID--After reviewing \n\nthe public comments elicited by an Advance Notice of Proposed \n\nRulemaking, 75 FR 78179 (Dec. 15, 2010) seeking suggestions on ways to \n\nenhance the effectiveness and enforceability of the caller \n\nidentification (``Caller ID'') requirements of the TSR as well as \n\ntechnical presentations at the FTC's 2012 Robocall Summit, the \n\nCommission determined that amending the TSR would not reduce the \n\nincidence of the falsification, or ``spoofing,'' of Caller ID \n\ninformation in telemarketing calls. The Commission issued a Federal \n\nRegister Notice closing this proceeding, effective December 5, 2013. 78 \n\nFR 77024 (Dec. 20, 2014).\n\n Fred Meyer Guides, 16 CFR 240. On September 18, 2014, the \n\nCommission completed its review of the Fred Meyer Guides (officially \n\nthe Guides for Advertising Allowances and Other Merchandising Payments \n\nand Services) and is retaining the Guides with updates that, among \n\nother revisions, clarify that the Guides apply to Internet commerce and \n\nbring the Guides into conformity with current case law regarding the \n\n\n\napplicability of Sections 2(d) and (e) of the Robinson-Patman Act to \n\nknowing inducement of disproportional promotional allowances. 79 FR \n\n58245 (Sept. 29, 2014). The Guides assist businesses in complying with \n\nsections 2(d) and 2(e) of the Robinson-Patman Act, which proscribe \n\ncertain discriminations in the provision of promotional allowances and \n\nservices to customers. Broadly put, the Guides provide that unlawful \n\ndiscrimination may be avoided by providing promotional allowances and \n\nservices to customers on ``proportionally equal terms.''\n\n Vocational Schools Guides, 16 CFR 254. On November 18, 2013, the \n\nCommission amended the Vocational Schools Guides (or the Private \n\nVocational and Distance Education Schools Guides) to address more \n\nspecifically misrepresentations commonly used in recruitment, including \n\nthose regarding completion/dropout rates and post-graduation job \n\nprospects; about whether completion of a program will qualify students \n\nto take a licensing exam; concerning a student's score on an admissions \n\ntest, how long it takes to complete a course or program, or a student's \n\nlikelihood of success; and regarding the likelihood of financial aid or \n\nhelp with language barriers or learning disabilities, or how much \n\ncredit students will receive for courses completed elsewhere. 78 FR \n\n68987. The Vocational School Guides address marketing practices by \n\nbusinesses that offer vocational training.\n\nSummary\n\n In both content and process, the FTC's ongoing and proposed \n\nregulatory actions are consistent with the President's priorities. The \n\nactions under consideration inform and protect consumers, while \n\nminimizing the regulatory burdens on businesses. The Commission will \n\ncontinue working toward these goals. The Commission's 10-year review \n\nprogram is patterned after provisions in the Regulatory Flexibility Act \n\nand complies with the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness \n\nAct of 1996. The Commission's 10-year program also is consistent with \n\nsection 5(a) of Executive Order 12866, which directs executive branch \n\nagencies to develop a plan to reevaluate periodically all of their \n\nsignificant existing regulations. 58 FR 51735 (Sept. 30, 1993). In \n\naddition, the final rules issued by the Commission continue to be \n\nconsistent with the President's Statement of Regulatory Philosophy and \n\nPrinciples, Executive Order 12866, section 1(a), which directs agencies \n\nto promulgate only such regulations as are, inter alia, required by law \n\nor are made necessary by compelling public need, such as material \n\nfailures of private markets to protect or improve the health and safety \n\nof the public.\n\n The Commission continues to identify and weigh the costs and \n\n\n\nbenefits of proposed actions and possible alternative actions and to \n\nreceive the broadest practicable array of comment from affected \n\nconsumers, businesses, and the public at large. In sum, the \n\nCommission's regulatory actions are aimed at efficiently and fairly \n\npromoting the ability of ``private markets to protect or improve the \n\nhealth and safety of the public, the environment, or the well-being of \n\nthe American people.'' Executive Order 12866, section 1.\n\nII. Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions\n\n The Commission has no proposed rules that would be a ``significant\n\n[[Page 76667]]\n\nregulatory action'' under the definition in Executive Order 12866.\\29\\ \n\nThe Commission has no proposed rules that would have significant \n\ninternational impacts under the definition in Executive Order 13609. \n\nAlso, there are no international regulatory cooperation activities that \n\nare reasonably anticipated to lead to significant regulations under \n\nExecutive Order 13609.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \\29\\ Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 defines a regulatory \n\naction to be ``significant'' if it is likely to result in a rule \n\nthat may:\n\n (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more \n\nor adversely affect in a material way the economy; a sector of the \n\neconomy; productivity; competition; jobs; the environment; public \n\nhealth or safety; or State, local, or tribal governments or \n\ncommunities;\n\n (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with \n\nan action taken or planned by another agency;\n\n (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, \n\ngrants, user fees, or loan programs, or the rights and obligations \n\nof recipients thereof; or\n\n (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal \n\nmandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in \n\nthis Executive order.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBILLING CODE 6750-01-P\n\nNATIONAL INDIAN GAMING COMMISSION (NIGC)\n\nStatement of Regulatory Priorities\n\n In 1988, Congress adopted the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) \n\n\n\n(Pub L. 100-497, 102 Stat. 2475) with a primary purpose of providing \n\n``a statutory basis for the operation of gaming by Indian tribes as a \n\nmeans of promoting tribal economic development, self-sufficiency, and \n\nstrong tribal governments.'' IGRA established the National Indian \n\nGaming Commission (NIGC or the Commission) to protect such gaming, \n\namongst other things, as a means of generating tribal revenue.\n\n At its core, Indian gaming is a function of sovereignty exercised \n\nby tribal governments. In addition, the Federal government maintains a \n\ngovernment-to-government relationship with the tribes--a responsibility \n\nof the NIGC. Thus, while the Agency is committed to strong regulation \n\nof Indian gaming, the Commission is equally committed to strengthening \n\ngovernment-to-government relations by engaging in meaningful \n\nconsultation with tribes to fulfill IGRA's intent. The NIGC's vision is \n\nto adhere to principles of good government, including transparency to \n\npromote agency accountability and fiscal responsibility, to operate \n\nconsistently to ensure fairness and clarity in the administration of \n\nIGRA, and to respect the responsibilities of each sovereign in order to \n\nfully promote tribal economic development, self-sufficiency, and strong \n\ntribal governments. The NIGC is fully committed to working with tribes \n\nto ensure the integrity of the industry by exercising its regulatory \n\nresponsibilities through technical assistance, compliance, and \n\nenforcement activities.\n\nRetrospective Review of Existing Regulations\n\n As an independent regulatory agency, the NIGC has been performing a \n\nretrospective review of its existing regulations well before Executive \n\nOrder 13579 was issued on July 11, 2011. The NIGC, however, recognizes \n\nthe importance of Executive Order 13579 and its regulatory review is \n\nbeing conducted in the spirit of Executive Order 13579, to identify \n\nthose regulations that may be outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, or \n\nexcessively burdensome and to modify, streamline, expand, or repeal \n\nthem in accordance with input from the public. In addition, as required \n\nby Executive Order 13175, the Commission has been conducting \n\ngovernment-to-government consultations with tribes regarding each \n\nregulation's relevancy, consistency in application, and limitations or \n\nbarriers to implementation, based on the tribes' experiences. The \n\nconsultation process is also intended to result in the identification \n\nof areas for improvement and needed amendments, if any, new \n\nregulations, and the possible repeal of outdated regulations.\n\n The following Regulatory Identifier Numbers (RINs) have been \n\nidentified as associated with the review:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n RIN Title\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n3141-AA32................... Amendment of Definitions.\n\n3141-AA55................... Minimum Internal Control Standards.\n\n3141-AA58................... Amendment of Approval of Management\n\n Contracts.\n\n3141-AA60................... Class II Minimum Internal Control\n\n Standards.\n\n3143-AA61................... Self-Regulation of Class II Gaming.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n More specifically, the NIGC is currently considering promulgating \n\nnew regulations in the following areas: (i) Amendments to its \n\nregulatory definitions to conform to the newly promulgated rules; (ii) \n\nthe removal, revision, or suspension of the existing minimum internal \n\ncontrol standards (MICS) in part 542; (iii) updates or revisions to its \n\nmanagement contract regulations to address the current state of the \n\nindustry; (iv) updates and revisions to its Self-Regulation of Class II \n\nGaming regulations; and (v) the review and revision of the minimum \n\ninternal control standards for Class II gaming. The NIGC anticipates \n\nthat the ongoing consultations with regulated tribes will continue to \n\nplay an important role in the development of the NIGC's rulemaking \n\nefforts.\n\nBILLING CODE 7565-01-P\n\nU.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION'S FISCAL YEAR 2014 REGULATORY PLAN\n\nA. Statement of Regulatory Priorities\n\n Under the authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, \n\nand the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, the U.S. Nuclear \n\nRegulatory Commission (NRC) regulates the possession and use of source, \n\nbyproduct, and special nuclear material. The NRC's regulatory mission \n\nis to license and regulate the Nation's civilian use of byproduct, \n\nsource, and special nuclear materials, to ensure adequate protection of \n\npublic health and safety, promote the common defense and security, and \n\nprotect the environment. As part of its mission, the NRC regulates the \n\noperation of nuclear power plants and fuel-cycle plants; the \n\nsafeguarding of nuclear materials from theft and sabotage; the safe \n\ntransport, storage, and disposal of radioactive materials and wastes; \n\nthe decommissioning and safe release for other uses of licensed \n\nfacilities that are no longer in operation; and the medical, \n\nindustrial, and research applications of nuclear material. In addition, \n\nthe NRC licenses the import and export of radioactive materials.\n\n As part of its regulatory process, the NRC routinely conducts \n\ncomprehensive\n\n\n\n[[Page 76668]]\n\nregulatory analyses that examine the costs and benefits of contemplated \n\nregulations. The NRC has developed internal procedures and programs to \n\nensure that it imposes only necessary requirements on its licensees and \n\nto review existing regulations to determine whether the requirements \n\nimposed are still necessary.\n\n The NRC's Regulatory Plan contains a statement of: (1) The major \n\nrules that the NRC expects to publish in final form in fiscal year (FY) \n\n2014 and FY 2015; (2) the other significant rulemakings that the NRC \n\nexpects to publish in final form in FY 2014; and (3) the other \n\nsignificant rulemakings that the NRC expects to publish in final form \n\nin FY 2015 and beyond. For each rule and rulemaking, the NRC is \n\nincluding a citation to an applicable Federal Register notice, which \n\nprovides further information, a summary of the legal basis for the rule \n\nor rulemaking, an explanation of why the NRC is pursuing the rule or \n\nrulemaking, the rulemaking's schedule, and contact information.\n\nB.1. Major Rules (FY 2014)\n\n The NRC will have published one major rule in final form by the end \n\nof FY 2014.\n\nRevision of Fee Schedules; Fee Recovery for FY 2014 (Regulation \n\nIdentifier Number (RIN) 3150-AJ32)\n\n Through this rule, the NRC will amend the licensing, inspection, \n\nand annual fees charged to its applicants and licensees. The amendments \n\nare necessary to implement the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n\n1990, as amended, which requires the NRC to recover through fees \n\napproximately 90 percent of its budget authority in FY 2014, not \n\nincluding amounts appropriated for Waste Incidental to Reprocessing and \n\namounts appropriated for generic homeland security activities. These \n\nfees represent the cost of the NRC's services provided to applicants \n\nand licensees. The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register \n\n(FR) on April 14, 2014 (79 FR 21036), and the comment period ended on \n\nMay 14, 2014.\n\nB.2. Major Rules (FY 2015)\n\n The NRC anticipates publishing one major rule in final form in FY \n\n2015.\n\n Revision of Fee Schedules; Fee Recovery for FY 2015--The NRC will \n\nupdate its requirement to recover approximately 90 percent of its \n\nbudget authority in FY 2015.\n\n\n\nC.1. Other Significant Rulemakings (FY 2014)\n\n The NRC has published four other significant rulemakings in final \n\nform in FY 2014. All four rules update the NRC's list of approved spent \n\nfuel storage casks to include amendments to Certificates of Compliance \n\n(CoC). Final rules were published in the FR as follows:\n\n Transnuclear, Inc. Standardized NUHOMS[supreg] Cask System; \n\nAmendment No. 11 to CoC No. 1004 (RIN 3150-AJ10), was published on \n\nDecember 27, 2013 (78 FR 78693), and effective on January 7, 2014.\n\n HI-STORM 100 Cask System; Amendment No. 9 to CoC No. 1014 (RIN \n\n3150-AJ12), was published on December 26, 2013 (78 FR 78165), and \n\neffective on March 11, 2014.\n\n Transnuclear, Inc. Standardized NUHOMS[supreg] Cask System; \n\nAmendment No. 13 to CoC No. 1004 (RIN 3150-AJ28), was published on \n\nMarch 10, 2014 (79 FR 13192). The final rule will be effective on May \n\n24, 2014.\n\n Transnuclear, Inc. Standardized Advanced NUHOMS[supreg] Horizontal \n\nModular Storage System; Amendment No. 3 to CoC No. 1029 (RIN 3150-\n\nAJ31), was published on April 15, 2014 (79 FR 21121). The NRC is in the \n\nprocess of considering comments received on this direct final rule.\n\n The NRC will have published two CoC rules in final form in FY 2014.\n\n Two CoC Rulemakings (RIN 3150-AJ30; and RIN 3150-AJ39)--These \n\nrulemakings allow a power reactor licensee to store spent fuel in \n\napproved cask designs under a general license.\n\nC.2. Other Significant Rulemakings (FY 2015 and Beyond)\n\n The other significant rulemakings that the NRC anticipates \n\npublishing in final form in FY 2015 and beyond are listed below. Some \n\nof these regulatory priorities are a result of recommendations from the \n\nFukushima Dai-ichi Near-Term Task Force. In 2011, the NRC established \n\nthis task force to examine regulatory requirements, programs, \n\nprocesses, and implementation based on information from the Fukushima \n\nDai-ichi site in Japan, following the March 11, 2011, earthquake and \n\ntsunami (see ``Recommendations for Enhancing Reactor Safety in the 21st \n\nCentury: The Near-Term Task Force Review of Insights from the Fukushima \n\nDai-ichi Accident,'' dated July 12, 2011 (Agencywide Documents Access \n\nand Management System (ADAMS) Accession No. ML111861807)).\n\nStation Blackout Mitigation Strategies (RIN 3150-AJ08)\n\n This rulemaking addresses Fukushima Dai-ichi Near-Term Task Force \n\nRecommendations 4 and 7. The NRC published a draft regulatory basis for \n\npublic comment in the Federal Register on April 10, 2013 (78 FR 21275), \n\n\n\nsupporting the potential amendment of its regulations for nuclear power \n\nplant licensees and their station blackout mitigation strategies. The \n\nNRC issued a final regulatory basis for rulemaking in a document \n\npublished in the Federal Register on July 23, 2013 (78 FR 44035).\n\nPerformance-Based Emergency Core Cooling System Acceptance Criteria \n\n(RIN 3150-AH42)\n\n The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on March \n\n24, 2014 (79 FR 16106). The proposed rule would replace prescriptive \n\nrequirements with performance-based requirements, incorporate recent \n\nresearch findings, and expand applicability to all fuel designs and \n\ncladding materials. Further, the proposed rule would allow licensees to \n\nuse an alternative risk-informed approach to evaluate the effects of \n\ndebris on long-term cooling. The proposed rule addresses two petitions \n\nfor rulemaking (PRMs). On April 22, 2014 (79 FR 22456), a document was \n\npublished in the FR extending the comment period until August 21, 2014.\n\nStrengthening and Integrating Onsite Emergency Response Capabilities \n\n(RIN 3150-AJ11)\n\n This rulemaking addresses Fukushima Dai-ichi Near-Term Task Force \n\nRecommendation 8. The draft regulatory basis for this rulemaking was \n\npublished in the FR on January 8, 2013 (78 FR 1154). The NRC solicited \n\nstakeholder feedback on why the NRC finds rulemaking necessary to \n\nrevise its regulations governing the integration and enhancement of \n\nrequirements for onsite emergency response capabilities. The final \n\nregulatory basis for this rulemaking was published in the FR on October \n\n25, 2013 (78 FR 63901). Preliminary proposed rule language was made \n\navailable in a document published in the FR on November 15, 2013 (78 FR \n\n68774).\n\nMedical Use of Byproduct Material (Formerly Titled: Preceptor \n\nAttestation Requirements) (RIN 3150-AI63)\n\n The proposed rule would amend medical use regulations related to \n\nmedical event definitions for permanent implant brachytherapy; training \n\nand experience requirements for authorized users, medical physicists, \n\nRadiation\n\n[[Page 76669]]\n\nSafety Officers, and nuclear pharmacists; and requirements for the \n\ntesting and reporting of failed molybdenum/technetium and rubidium \n\ngenerators. This rule would also make changes that would allow \n\nAssociate Radiation Safety Officers to be named on a medical license, \n\nand make other clarifications. This rulemaking would also consider a \n\n\n\nrequest filed in a PRM, PRM-35-20, to ``grandfather'' certain board-\n\ncertified individuals, and per Commission direction in the Staff \n\nRequirements Memorandum dated August 13, 2012, to SECY-12-0053 (ADAMS \n\nAccession No. ML12072A299), subsume a proposed rule previously \n\npublished under RIN 3150-AI26, ``Medical Use of Byproduct Material-\n\nAmendments/Medical Event Definition'' [NRC-2008-0071].\n\n10 CFR Part 26 Drug and Alcohol Testing (RIN 3150-AJ15)\n\n This proposed rule would amend the drug testing requirements of 10 \n\nCFR part 26, ``Fitness-for-Duty Programs,'' to incorporate lessons \n\nlearned from implementing the 2008 10 CFR part 26 final rule; enhance \n\nthe identification of new testing subversion methods; and require the \n\nevaluation and testing of semi-synthetic opiates, synthetic drugs and \n\nurine, and use of chemicals or multiple prescriptions that could result \n\nin a person being unfit for duty.\n\nEnhanced Weapons, Firearms Background Checks, and Security Event \n\nNotifications (RIN 3150-AI49)\n\n The proposed rule was published in the FR on February 2, 2011 (76 \n\nFR 6200). A supplemental proposed rule was published in the FR on \n\nJanuary 10, 2013 (78 FR 2214). This proposed rule would implement the \n\nNRC's authority under the new Section 161A of the Atomic Energy Act of \n\n1954, as amended, and revise existing regulations governing security \n\nevent notifications.\n\nCyber Event Notification Rule (RIN 3150-AJ37)\n\n This rule would establish a new section in 10 CFR part 73, \n\n``Physical Protection of Plants and Materials,'' for cyber security \n\nevent notifications. This rule was originally proposed as part of the \n\nEnhanced Weapons rulemaking (RIN 3150-AI49).\n\nSite-Specific Analysis (Disposal of Unique Waste Streams) (RIN 3150-\n\nAI92)\n\n The proposed rule would amend the Commission's regulations to \n\nrequire both currently operating and future low-level radioactive waste \n\ndisposal facilities to enhance safe disposal of low-level radioactive \n\nwaste by conducting a performance assessment and an intruder assessment \n\nto demonstrate compliance with performance objectives in 10 CFR part \n\n61, ``Licensing Requirements for Land Disposal of Radioactive Waste.'' \n\nPreliminary proposed rule language was made available in a document \n\npublished in the FR on May 3, 2011 (76 FR 24831). The regulatory basis \n\nfor rulemaking was made available in a document published in the FR on \n\n\n\nDecember 7, 2012 (77 FR 72997). On January 8, 2013 (78 FR 1155), the \n\nNRC published a document correcting the title and the ADAMS accession \n\nnumber of the regulatory basis document referenced in the document that \n\nwas published on December 7, 2012.\n\n10 CFR Part 26 Drug Testing--U.S. Department of Health and Human \n\nServices (HHS) Guidelines (RIN 3150-AI67)\n\n The proposed rule would amend the Commission's regulations to \n\nselectively align drug testing requirements in 10 CFR part 26 with \n\nFederal drug testing guidelines issued by HHS. The regulatory basis was \n\npublished in the FR on July 1, 2013 (78 FR 39190).\n\nNRC\n\nProposed Rule Stage\n\n159. Revision of Fee Schedules: Fee Recovery for FY 2015 [NRC-\n\n2014-0200]\n\n Priority: Economically Significant. Major under 5 U.S.C. 801.\n\n Legal Authority: 42 U.S.C. 2201; 42 U.S.C. 5841\n\n CFR Citation: 10 CFR 170; 10 CFR 171.\n\n Legal Deadline: NPRM, Statutory, September 30, 2015.\n\n The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA-90), as \n\namended, requires that the NRC recover approximately 90 percent of its \n\nbudget authority in Fiscal Year (FY) 2015, less the amounts \n\nappropriated from the Waste Incidental to Reprocessing, and generic \n\nhomeland security activities. The OBRA-90 requires that the fees for FY \n\n2015, must be collected by September 30, 2015.\n\n Abstract: This proposed rulemaking would amend the licensing, \n\ninspection, and annual fees that the Commission charges its applicants \n\nand licensees. These amendments would implement the Omnibus Budget \n\nReconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA-90) as amended, which requires that \n\nthe NRC recover approximately 90 percent of its budget authority in \n\nFiscal Year (FY) 2015, less the amounts appropriated from the Waste \n\nIncidental to Reprocessing, and generic homeland security activities.\n\n Statement of Need: This rulemaking would amend the licensing \n\ninspection, and annual fees charged to the NRC's licensees and \n\napplicants for an NRC license. The amendments are necessary to recover \n\napproximately 90 percent of the NRC's budget authority for FY 2015 less \n\nthe amounts appropriated for non-fee items. The OBRA-90, as amended, \n\nrequires that the NRC accomplish the 90 percent recovery through the \n\nassessment of fees. The NRC assesses two types of fees to recover its \n\nbudget authority. License and inspection fees are assessed under the \n\nauthority of the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952 (IOAA) \n\n\n\nto recover the costs of providing individually identifiable services to \n\nspecific applicants and licensees (10 CFR part 170). IOAA requires that \n\nthe NRC recover the full cost to the NRC of all identifiable regulatory \n\nservices that each applicant or licensee receives. The NRC recovers \n\ngeneric and other regulatory costs not recovered from fees imposed \n\nunder 10 CFR part 170 through the assessment of annual fees under the \n\nauthority of OBRA-90 (10 CFR part 171). Annual fee charges are \n\nconsistent with the guidance in the Conference Committee Report on \n\nOBRA-90. The NRC assesses annual charges under the principle that \n\nlicensees who require the greatest expenditure of the Agency's \n\nresources should pay the greatest annual fee.\n\n Summary of Legal Basis: The OBRA-90, as amended, requires that the \n\nfees for FY 2015 must be collected by September 30, 2015.\n\n Alternatives: Because this action is mandated by statute and the \n\nfees must be assessed through rulemaking, the NRC did not consider \n\nalternatives to this action.\n\n Anticipated Cost and Benefits: The cost to the NRC's licensees is \n\napproximately 90 percent of the NRC FY 2015 budget authority less the \n\namounts appropriated for non-fee items. The estimated dollar amount to \n\nbe billed to licensees as fees to the NRC's applicants and licensees \n\nfor FY 2015 is approximately $925.2 million.\n\n Risks: Not applicable.\n\n Timetable:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Action Date FR Cite\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNPRM................................ 03/00/15 .......................\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required: Yes.\n\n Small Entities Affected: Businesses, Governmental Jurisdictions, \n\nOrganizations.\n\n[[Page 76670]]\n\n Government Levels Affected: Local, State.\n\n Federalism: Undetermined.\n\n Agency Contact: Arlette P.

Mission and Overview\n\n The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) was established to codify \n\nuniform policies for acquisition of supplies and services by executive \n\nagencies. It is issued and maintained jointly, pursuant to the Office \n\nof Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Reauthorization Act, under the \n\nstatutory authorities granted to the Secretary of Defense, \n\nAdministrator of General Services, and the Administrator, National \n\nAeronautics and Space Administration. Statutory authorities to issue \n\nand revise the FAR have been delegated to the procurement executives in \n\nDepartment of Defense (DoD), GSA, and National Aeronautics and Space \n\nAdministration (NASA). The FAR Council formulated a plan for a \n\nretrospective analysis of existing rules and a paperwork burden plan in \n\nresponse to the President's Executive Orders 13563 and 13610. The plan \n\nconducts a periodic review of existing significant regulations and also \n\nfocuses on reducing the paperwork burdens on small business. The plan \n\nis located at http://www.acquisition.gov.\n\nII. Statement of Regulatory and Deregulatory Priorities\n\nFederal Acquisition Regulation Priorities\n\n Specific FAR cases that the FAR Council plans to address in Fiscal \n\nYear 2015 include:\n\nRegulations of Concern to Small Businesses\n\n Small Business Subcontracting Improvements--This case implements \n\nstatutory requirements from the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 aimed \n\nat protecting small business subcontractors and increasing \n\nsubcontracting opportunities for small business. (FAR Case 2014-003)\n\n Set-Asides under Multiple Award Contracts--This case implements \n\nstatutory requirements from the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 and is \n\naimed at providing agencies with clarifying guidance on how to use \n\nmultiple award contracts as a tool to increase Federal contracting \n\nopportunities for small businesses. (FAR Case 2014-002)\n\n Payment of Subcontractors--This case implements section 1334 of the \n\nSmall Business Jobs Act of 2010 and the Small Business Administration's \n\n(SBA) Final Rule 78 FR 42391, Small Business Subcontracting. The rule \n\nrequires prime contractors of contracts requiring a subcontracting plan \n\nto notify the contracting officer in writing if the prime contractor \n\npays a reduced price to a subcontractor or if payment is more than 90 \n\ndays past due. A contracting officer will then use his or her best \n\njudgment in determining whether the late or reduced payment was \n\njustified and if not the contracting officer will record the identity \n\nhttp://www.acquisition.gov/\n\n\nof a prime contractor with a history of unjustified untimely payments \n\nto subcontractors in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity \n\nInformation System (FAPIIS) or any successor system. (FAR Case 2014-\n\n004)\n\n Consolidation of Contract Requirements--This case implements \n\nsection 1313 of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 and SBA's final \n\nrule to ensure that decisions made by Federal agencies regarding \n\nconsolidation of contract requirements are made with a view to \n\nproviding small businesses with appropriate opportunities to \n\nparticipate as prime and subcontractors. (FAR Case 2014-015)\n\n Clarification of Requirement for Justifications for 8(a) Sole-\n\nSource Contracts--This case amends the FAR in response to GAO Report to \n\nthe Chairman, Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight, Committee on \n\nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, entitled \n\nFederal Contracting: Slow Start to Implementation of Justifications for \n\n8(a) Sole-Source Contracts (GAO-13-118 dated December 2012). The GAO \n\nreport indicated that the FAR is not clear on whether a justification \n\nis required and suggested that clarifying guidance is needed to help \n\nensure that agencies are applying the justification requirement \n\nconsistently. Based on GAO's recommendation, this case further \n\nclarifies the processes and procedures in the FAR to ensure uniform, \n\nconsistent, and coherent guidance regarding the use of sole-source 8(a) \n\njustifications. (FAR Case 2013-018)\n\n Contracts under the Small Business Administration 8(a) Program--\n\nThis case clarifies FAR subpart 19.8, ``Contracting with the Small \n\nBusiness Administration (The 8(a) Program).'' Clarifications include \n\nthe evaluation, offering, and acceptance process for requirements under \n\nthe 8(a) program, procedures for acquiring SBA's consent to procure an \n\n8(a) requirement outside the 8(a) program, and the impact of exiting \n\nthe 8(a) program in terms of the firm's ability to receive future 8(a) \n\nrequirements and its current contractual commitments. (FAR Case 2012-\n\n022)\n\nRegulations Which Promote Fiscal Responsibility\n\n Notification of Pass-Through Contracts--This case implements \n\nsection 802 of the NDAA for FY 2013. Section 802 requires in those \n\ninstances where an offeror for a contract, task order, or delivery \n\norder informs the agency pursuant to FAR 52.215-22 of their intention \n\nto award subcontracts for more than 70 percent of the total cost of \n\nwork to be performed under the contract, task order, or delivery order, \n\nthe contracting officer is required to (1) consider the availability of \n\nalternative contract vehicles and the feasibility of contracting \n\n\n\ndirectly with a subcontractor or subcontractors that will perform the \n\nbulk of the work; (2) make a written determination that the contracting \n\napproach selected is in the best interest of the Government; and (3) \n\ndocument the basis for such determination. (FAR Case 2013-012)\n\n Limitation on Allowable Government Contractor Compensation Costs--\n\nThis interim rule implements section 702 of the Bipartisan Budget Act \n\nof 2013. In accordance with section 702, the interim rule revises the \n\nallowable cost limit relative to the compensation of contractor and \n\nsubcontractor employees. Also, in accordance with section 702, this \n\ninterim rule implements the possible exception to this allowable cost \n\nlimit for scientists, engineers, or other specialists upon an agency \n\ndetermination that such exceptions are needed to ensure that the \n\nexecutive agency has continued access to needed skills and \n\ncapabilities. (FAR Case 2014-012)\n\nRegulations Which Promote Ethics and Integrity in Contractor \n\nPerformance\n\n Information on Corporate Contractor Performance and Integrity--This \n\ncase implements section 852 of the NDAA for FY 2013 (Pub. L. 112-239). \n\nSection 852 requires that the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity \n\nInformation System (FAPPIIS) include, to the extent practicable, \n\nidentification of any immediate owner or subsidiary, and all \n\npredecessors of an offeror that held a Federal contract or grant within \n\nthe last three years. The objective is to provide a more comprehensive \n\nunderstanding of the performance and integrity of a\n\n[[Page 76671]]\n\ncontractor in awarding a Federal contract. (FAR Case 2013-020)\n\n Trafficking in Persons--This case implements Executive Order 13627, \n\nand title XVII of the NDAA for FY 2013, to strengthen protections \n\nagainst trafficking in persons in Federal contracts. The case creates a \n\nstronger framework and additional requirements related to awareness, \n\ncompliance, and enforcement. Contractors and subcontractors must \n\ndisclose to employees the key conditions of employment, starting with \n\nwages and work location. (FAR Case 2013-001)\n\n Prohibition on Contracting with Corporations with Delinquent Taxes \n\nor a Felony Conviction--This case implements multiple sections of the \n\nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (Pub. L. 113-76) to prohibit \n\nusing any of the funds appropriated by the Act to enter into a contract \n\nwith any corporation with a delinquent Federal tax liability or a \n\nfelony conviction. (FAR case 2014-019)\n\n\n\n Prohibition On Contracting with Inverted Domestic Corporations--\n\nThis case implements section 733 of Division E of the Consolidated \n\nAppropriations Act, 2014 (Pub. L. 113-76), which prohibits expenditure \n\nof appropriated funds for contracts with a foreign incorporated entity \n\nthat is treated as an inverted domestic corporation or any subsidiary \n\nof such entity. The FAR is being updated to (1) revise the methods used \n\nto implement the inverted domestic corporation contracting prohibition; \n\n(2) amend the definition to clarify entities considered to be an \n\ninverted domestic corporation; (3) revise the representation to require \n\ntwo affirmative yes/no representations with respect to inverted \n\ndomestic corporation status; and require a contractor to promptly \n\ninform the contracting officer, in writing, in the event the contractor \n\nbecomes either an inverted domestic corporation or a subsidiary of an \n\ninverted domestic corporation during the performance of the contract. \n\n(FAR Case 2014-017)\n\nRegulations Which Promote Accountability and Transparency\n\n Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code--This case requires \n\nthe use of CAGE codes, an alpha-numeric identifier used extensively \n\nthroughout the Government, for awards valued greater than the \n\nmicropurchase threshold. The case also requires identification of the \n\nimmediate corporate/organization parent and highest level corporate/\n\norganization parent during contractor registration for Federal \n\ncontracts. The goal is to provide for standardization across the \n\nFederal government, and to facilitate data collection as means of \n\npromoting increased traceability and transparency. (FAR Case 2012-014)\n\n Uniform Procurement Identification--This case requires the use of a \n\nunique identifier for contracting offices and a standard unique \n\nProcurement Instrument Identification Number for transactions. The goal \n\nis to provide for standardization across the Federal government and to \n\nfacilitate data tracking and collection. (FAR Case 2012-023)\n\n Uniform Use of Line Items--This case establishes a requirement for \n\nuse of a standardized uniform line item numbering structure in Federal \n\nprocurement. This case is one component of the effort to implement \n\nFederal spending data standards in Federal procurement. This effort \n\nwill help improve analysis and management decision that can reduce \n\nduplication in Federal spending, reduce costs for recipients of Federal \n\ndollars by reducing variations in standards for reporting and billing \n\npurposes, and provide greater transparency on outcomes of spending. \n\n(FAR Case 2013-014)\n\n Privacy Training--This case creates a FAR clause to require \n\ncontractors that (1) need access to a system of records, (2) handle \n\n\n\npersonally identifiable information, or (3) design, develop, maintain, \n\nor operate a system of records on behalf of the Government have their \n\npersonnel complete privacy training. This addition complies with \n\nsubsections (e) (agency requirements) and (m) (Government contractors) \n\nof the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a). (FAR Case 2010-013)\n\nRegulations That Promote Protection of Government Information and \n\nSystems\n\n Basic Safeguarding of Contractor Information Systems--This case \n\namends the FAR to implement procedures for safeguarding contractor \n\ninformation systems that contain information provided by or generated \n\nfor the Government. The purpose of these safeguards is to provide the \n\nGovernment with the necessary assurance that contractors are taking \n\nbasic security measures on their information systems containing \n\nGovernment information. (FAR Case 2011-020)\n\n Expanded Reporting of Nonconforming Items--This case expands \n\nGovernment and contractor requirements for reporting of nonconforming \n\nitems. A nonconforming item includes items that are likely to result in \n\nfailure of the supplies or services, or materially reduces the \n\nusability of the supplies or services for their intended purpose. It is \n\na partial implementation of section 818 of the NDAA for FY 2012. (FAR \n\nCase 2013-002)\n\n Higher-Level Contract Quality Requirements--This case clarifies \n\nwhen to use higher-level quality standards in solicitations and \n\ncontracts. The rule also updates the examples of higher-level quality \n\nstandards by removing obsolete standards and adding new industry \n\nstandards that pertain to quality assurance for avoidance of \n\ncounterfeit items. (FAR Case 2012-032)\n\nRegulations Which Promote Fair Labor Practices\n\n Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces--This rule implements Executive Order \n\n13673, Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces, seeks to increase efficiency in \n\nthe work performed by Federal contractors by ensuring that they \n\nunderstand and comply with labor laws designed to promote safe, \n\nhealthy, fair and effective workplaces.
