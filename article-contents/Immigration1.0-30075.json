{"title": "Assessing America's Place in the Global Network", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nIn ''The Crossroads Nation'' (column, Nov. 9), David Brooks concludes that to be the ''crossroads nation,'' America \nneeds to finance research, improve infrastructure, fix immigration, reform taxes, encourage study abroad by college \nstudents and take advantage of veterans.\n\nBy my count, at least three (and possibly more) of these goals require a significant government role. Given a \nRepublican Party with a strong Tea Party faction explicitly pledging to cut ''nonessential'' spending and remove \ngovernment from our lives, it would be helpful to know how he envisions these things coming about.\n\nBrian Williams Lewisburg, Pa., Nov. 9, 2010\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nIf we don't reform our immigration laws to make it easier for skilled immigrants to stay here after graduating from \none of our universities or move here after obtaining much needed skills in their home countries, we don't stand a \nchance of becoming the essential destination in the 21st century.\n\nWe may be ''well situated to be the crossroads nation,'' but unless foreign-born travelers can get on the road to the \nUnited States with a legal right to stay and work here, there will be no roads to cross.\n\nKenneth Gilman New York, Nov. 10, 2010\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nLast week one of my undergraduate finance students asked me how I can be optimistic about the future of our \ncountry, given the negativism and acrimony of the recent election and all that has happened to our economy these \npast three years. I hesitated; yes, I'm optimistic, but I couldn't put my finger on why.\n\nThank you, David Brooks, for cutting through the fog and making such a clear, rational argument for what was only \na vague instinct.\n\nRobert Elliott Chicago, Nov. 10, 2010\n\nThe writer is a professor of finance at DePaul University.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
