{"title": "U.S. Ship Subsidies Enhance Global Status", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nIn your Oct. 1 editorial against the subsidizing of the American merchant marine fleet, you suggest we rely on ships \nowned by the Government or hire foreign ships to do the job. And you point to the Persian Gulf war as an example \nof how we have no use for a merchant marine.\n\nThe $1 billion authorized over the next decade to subsidize the fleet is a lot. But it is critical for our national defense. \nAn adequate fleet is necessary, and the American merchant marine was the key source of sealift to support our \nforces in the gulf war.\n\nYou state that the fleet \"is outperformed commercially by more efficient foreign-flag vessels.\" This works fine so \nlong as there is no hostility where we want to send our goods. Can we always rely on other nations and their \ncitizens to support America?\n\n \n\nEZRA SCHNEIER\n\nPresident, Marine Index Bureau Inc.\n\nEwing, N.J., Oct. 9, 1996\n"}
