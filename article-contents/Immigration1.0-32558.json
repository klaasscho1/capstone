{"title": "Homeland Security Dept., on Immigrant Detention", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\n''A Broken, Dangerous System'' (editorial, Dec. 5) shortchanges the important steps the Department of Homeland \nSecurity has taken to reform our nation's immigration detention system, strengthening accountability while \nprioritizing the health and safety of people in detention facilities across the country.\n\nSince 2009, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has increased oversight, including announced and \nunannounced inspections, the closing of some facilities and additional detention services managers to ensure \nfacility compliance. Likewise, the department's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties has stepped up inspections, \ntraining and oversight.\n\nThe department strongly supports the Prison Rape Elimination Act, a federal law. In fact, current detention \nstandards adhere to the law's substantive requirements, and new revised draft standards include even stronger \nprovisions on sexual abuse. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has terminated contracts with facilities that fail \nto meet our standards.\n\nThe department remains committed to safe, secure, humane detention conditions -- and continues to make \nprogress on that commitment.\n\nMARGO SCHLANGER Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Department of Homeland Security Washington, \nDec. 7, 2011\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
