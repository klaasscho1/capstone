{"title": "Immigration to Israel Reaches 13-Year Low", "body": "\nImmigration to Israel in 2002 was the lowest in 13 years, the Central Bureau of Statistics said today.\n\n     Immigration officials explaining the drop said the potential pool of Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet \nUnion is dwindling, although security concerns also appear to be keeping some people from settling in Israel. \n\n Scores of immigrants have been among the hundreds of Israelis killed in the last 28 months of Israeli-Palestinian \nfighting.\n\nThe statistics bureau said 33,000 people immigrated to Israel in 2002, or about 10,000 fewer than in 2001.\n\nIn the past decade, the vast majority of newcomers to Israel were Jews from the former Soviet republics. That was \nalso true in 2002, but the influx decreased from the previous year. At the same time, migration from Argentina \ntripled, fueled by the severe economic troubles.\n\nThe number of French Jews arriving in Israel doubled from the year before, and migration from the United States \nincreased by 23 percent. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
