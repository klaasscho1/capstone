{"title": "FR-5720-F-03 Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013: Implementation in HUD Housing Programs", "body": "\n Washington, DC:  This Rule document was issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)\n\n  \n\n  \n <h2>\n  Action</h2>\n \n  Final rule.\n <h2>\n  Summary</h2>\n \n\n  This final rule implements in HUD's regulations the requirements of the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act (VAWA), which applies for all victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, \nand stalking, regardless of sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and which must be applied consistent with all \nnondiscrimination and fair housing requirements. The 2013 reauthorization (VAWA 2013) expands housing \nprotections to HUD programs beyond HUD's public housing program and HUD's tenant-based and project-based \nSection 8 programs (collectively, the Section 8 programs) that were covered by the 2005 reauthorization of the \nViolence Against Women Act (VAWA 2005). Additionally, the 2013 law provides enhanced protections and options \nfor victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Specifically, this rule amends HUD's \ngenerally applicable regulations, HUD's regulations for the public housing and Section 8 programs that already \npertain to VAWA, and the regulations of programs newly covered by VAWA 2013.\n\n \n\n  In addition to this final rule, HUD is publishing a notice titled the Notice of Occupancy Rights under the Violence \nAgainst Women Act (Notice of Occupancy Rights) that certain housing providers must give to tenants and \napplicants to ensure they are aware of their rights under VAWA and these implementing regulations, a model \nemergency transfer plan that may be used by housing providers to develop their own emergency transfer plans, a \nmodel emergency transfer request form that housing providers could provide to tenants requesting an emergency \n\n\ntransfer under these regulations, and a new certification form for documenting incidents of domestic violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault, and stalking that must be used by housing providers.\n \n\n  This rule reflects the statutory changes made by VAWA 2013, as well as HUD's recognition of the importance of \nproviding housing protections and rights to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and \nstalking. By increasing opportunities for all individuals to live in safe housing, this will reduce the risk of \nhomelessness and further HUD's mission of utilizing housing to improve quality of life.\n <h2>\n  Dates</h2>\n \n  Effective Date: These regulations are effective on December 16, 2016.\n \n  Compliance Date: Compliance with the rule with respect to completing an emergency transfer plan and providing \nemergency transfers, and associated recordkeeping and reporting requirements, is required no later than May 15, \n2017.\n <h2>\n  For Further Information Contact</h2>\n \n  For information about: HUD's Public Housing program, contact Monica Shepherd, Director Public Housing \nManagement and Occupancy Division, Office of Public and Indian Housing, Room 4204, telephone number 202-\n402-5687; HUD's Housing Choice Voucher program and Project-Based Voucher, contact Becky Primeaux, Director, \nHousing Voucher Management and Operations Division, Office of Public and Indian Housing, Room 4216, \ntelephone number 202-402-6050; HUD's Multifamily Housing programs, contact Yvette M.

(See \nPub. L. 113-4, 127 Stat. 54, approved March 7, 2013, at 127 Stat. 101). VAWA 2005 (Pub. L. 109-162, 119 Stat. \n2959, approved January 5, 2006) applied VAWA protections to certain HUD programs by amending the authorizing \nstatutes for HUD's public housing and section 8 programs to provide protections for victims of domestic violence, \ndating violence, and stalking. VAWA 2013 removes these amendments from the public housing and section 8 \nauthorizing statutes, and in its place provides stand-alone VAWA protections that apply to these programs, as well \nas additional HUD programs, and also to victims of sexual assault. In addition, VAWA 2013 expands protections for \nvictims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking by amending the definition of domestic \nviolence to include violence committed by intimate partners of victims, and by providing that tenants cannot be \ndenied assistance because an affiliated individual of theirs is or was a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, \n\n\n\nsexual assault, or stalking (collectively VAWA crimes). The new law also expands remedies for victims of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking by requiring covered housing providers to have emergency \ntransfer plans, and providing that if housing providers allow for bifurcation of a lease, then tenants should have a \nreasonable time to establish eligibility for assistance under a VAWA-covered program or to find new housing when \nan assisted household has to be divided as a result of the violence or abuse covered by VAWA.\n \n\n  VAWA 2013 provides protections for both applicants for and tenants of assistance under a VAWA-covered \nhousing program. VAWA 2013 covers applicants, as well as tenants, in the statute's nondiscrimination and \nnotification provisions. However, the emergency transfer and bifurcation provisions of the rule are applicable solely \nto tenants. The statutory provisions of VAWA that require a notice of occupancy rights, an emergency transfer plan, \nand allow for the possibility of bifurcation of a lease, support that it is a rental housing situation that is the focus of \nthe VAWA protections. However, as described in this final rule, the core statutory protections of VAWA that prohibit \ndenial or termination of assistance or eviction solely on the basis that an individual is a victim of domestic violence, \ndating violence, stalking or sexual assault apply to certain housing programs subsidized by HUD even where there \nis no lease. HUD funds many shelters, temporary housing, short-term supported housing, and safe havens, and no \nperson is to be denied access to such facility or required to leave such facility solely on the basis that the person is \nor has been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. It is equally important to \nnote, as was noted in HUD's proposed rule, that the core statutory protections of VAWA 2013 that apply to \napplicants and tenants, were applicable upon enactment of VAWA 2013. As was discussed in HUD's proposed rule \nand reiterated in this final rule, regulations were not necessary to mandate adherence to this nondiscrimination \nrequirement. That is, if an individual meets all eligibility requirements and complies with all occupancy requirements, \nthe individual cannot be denied assistance or have assistance terminated solely on the basis that the individual is a \nvictim of domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, or sexual assault.\n \n\n  This rule better enables housing providers to comply with the mandates of VAWA 2013, and it reflects Federal \npolicies that recognize that all individuals should be able to live in their homes without fear of violence. The \nimplementation of VAWA protections in HUD programs increases opportunities for all individuals to live in safe \nhousing and reduces the risk of homelessness for individuals who might otherwise be evicted, be denied housing \nassistance, or flee their homes.\n <h3>\n  Summary of the Major Provisions of This Regulatory Action</h3>\n \n  Major provisions of this rule include:\n \n  \n   Specifying \u201csexual assault\u201d as a crime covered by VAWA in HUD-covered programs.\n  \n   Establishing a definition for \u201caffiliated individual\u201d based on the statutory definition and that is usable and workable \nfor HUD-covered programs.\n  \n   Applying VAWA protections to all covered HUD programs as well as the Housing Trust Fund, which was not \nstatutorily listed as a covered program.\n  \n   Ensuring that existing tenants, as well as new tenants, of all HUD-covered programs receive notification of their \nrights under VAWA and HUD's VAWA regulations.\n  \n\n   Establishing reasonable time periods during which a tenant who is a victim of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, or stalking may establish eligibility to remain in housing, where the tenant's household is \n\n\n\ndivided due to a VAWA crime, and where the tenant was not the member of the household that previously \nestablished eligibility for assistance.\n  \n   Establishing that housing providers may, but are not required to, request certain documentation from tenants \nseeking emergency transfers under VAWA.\n  \n   Providing for a six-month transition period to complete an emergency transfer plan and provide emergency \ntransfers, when requested, under the plan.\n  \n   Revising and establishing new program-specific regulations for implementing VAWA protections in a manner that \nis workable for each HUD-covered program.\n \n \n  Please refer to section II of this preamble, entitled \u201cThis Final Rule\u201d for a more detailed discussion of all the \nchanges made to HUD's existing regulations by this rule. In developing this rule, HUD identified outdated \nterminology in its regulations (for example, the use of the term \u201calcohol abuser\u201d in part 982). HUD will be issuing a \nfuture rule to update and correct such terms.\n <h3>\n  Costs and Benefits</h3>\n \n\n  The benefits of HUD's rule include codifying in regulation the protections that VAWA 2013 provides applicants to \nand tenants of HUD programs covered by VAWA; strengthening the rights of victims of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, or stalking in HUD-covered programs, including notification and confidentiality rights; and \npossibly minimizing the loss of housing by such victims through the bifurcation of lease provision and emergency \ntransfer provisions. With respect to rental housing, VAWA was enacted to bring housing stability to victims of \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking. It was determined that legislation was needed to \nrequire protections for such victims because housing providers often responded to VAWA crimes occurring in one \nof their rental units or on their property by evicting the tenant regardless of whether the tenant was a victim of \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, and refusing to rent to such victims on the basis \nthat violence would erupt in the victim's unit or on a housing provider's property if the individual was accepted as a \ntenant. To ensure that housing providers administering HUD assistance did not respond to domestic violence, \ndating violence, or stalking by denying or terminating assistance, VAWA 2005 brought HUD's public housing and \nSection 8 programs under the statute's purview, and VAWA 2013 covered the overwhelming majority of HUD \nprograms providing rental assistance.\n \n\n  The costs of the regulations are primarily paperwork costs. These are the costs of providing notice to applicants \nand tenants of their occupancy rights under VAWA, the preparation of an emergency transfer plan, and \ndocumenting an incident or incidents of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. The \ncosts, however, are minimized by the fact that VAWA 2013 requires HUD to prepare the notice of occupancy rights \nto be distributed to applicants and tenants; to prepare the certification form that serves as a means of documenting \nthe incident or incidents of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking; and to prepare a \nmodel emergency transfer plan that guides the entities and individuals administering the rental assistance provided \nby HUD in developing their own plans. In addition, costs to covered housing providers will be minimized because \nHUD will translate the notice of occupancy rights and certification form into the most popularly spoken languages in \nthe United States, and HUD has prepared a model transfer request form that housing providers and tenants \nrequesting emergency transfer may use. There may also be costs with respect to a tenant claiming the protections \nof VAWA and a covered housing provider responding to such incident, although these costs will vary depending on \nthe incidence of claims in a given year and the nature and complexity of the situation.\n <h3>\n  I. Background</h3>\n\n\n\n \n  On March 7, 2013, President Obama signed into law VAWA 2013 (Pub. L. 113-4, 127 Stat. 54). VAWA 2013 \nreauthorizes and amends VAWA 1994 (Title IV, sec. 40001-40703 of Pub. L. 103-322), which was previously \nreauthorized by VAWA 2000 (Pub. L. 106-386) and VAWA 2005 (Pub. L. 109-162, approved January 5, 2006, with \ntechnical corrections made by Pub. L. 109-271, approved August 12, 2006).\n \n\n  The VAWA 2005 reauthorization brought HUD's public housing program and HUD's Section 8 programs under \ncoverage of VAWA by amending the authorizing statutes for those programs, sections 6 and 8 of the United States \nHousing Act of 1937 (the 1937 Act) (42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.). VAWA 2005 established that being a victim of \ndomestic violence, dating violence, or stalking cannot be the basis for denial of assistance or admission to public \nor Section 8 housing, and provided other protections for victims. VAWA 2005 also contained requirements for \nnotification to tenants of the rights and protections provided under VAWA, provisions on the rights and \nresponsibilities of public housing agencies (PHAs) and owners and managers of assisted housing, and provisions \npertaining to acceptable documentation of incidents of VAWA crimes and maintaining the confidentiality of the \nvictim. HUD regulations pertaining to VAWA 2005 protections, rights, and responsibilities are codified in 24 CFR \npart 5, subpart L.\n \n\n  Title VI of VAWA 2013, \u201cSafe Homes for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, and \nStalking,\u201d contains the provisions that are applicable to HUD programs. Specifically, section 601 of VAWA 2013 \nremoves VAWA protections from the 1937 Act and adds a new chapter to Subtitle N of VAWA 1994 (42 U.S.C. \n14043e et seq.) entitled \u201cHousing Rights.\u201d As applicable to HUD, this chapter provides additional protections for \ntenants beyond those provided in VAWA 2005, and expands VAWA protections to other HUD programs.\n \n\n  On August 6, 2013, at 78 FR 47717, HUD published a Federal Register notice that provided an overview of the \napplicability of VAWA 2013 to HUD programs. This notice listed the new HUD housing programs covered by VAWA \n2013, described the changes that VAWA 2013 made to existing VAWA protections, and identified certain issues for \nwhich HUD specifically sought public comment. HUD solicited public comment for a period of 60 days, and the \npublic comment period closed on October 7, 2013. HUD appreciates the public comments submitted in response to \nthe August 6, 2013, notice, and these public comments were taken into consideration in the development of this \nrule. The public comments on the August 6, 2013, notice can be found at the www.regulations.gov government-\nwide portal, under docket number FR-5720-N-01, at            http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=HUD-\n2013-0074.\n \n\n  Many of the comments submitted in response to the August 6, 2013, notice asked HUD to advise program \nparticipants that certain VAWA protections are in effect without the necessity of rulemaking. In response to these \ncomments, HUD offices administering HUD-covered programs reached out to participants in their programs to \nadvise them that the core statutory protections of VAWA\u2014not denying or terminating assistance to, or evicting an \nindividual solely on the basis that an individual is or has been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, \nstalking, or sexual assault\u2014were effective upon enactment and do not require notice and comment rulemaking for \nimplementing these protections and that they should proceed to provide the basic VAWA protections.  (1) \n \n\n  On April 1, 2015, HUD published its proposed rule that provided the amendments to HUD's existing regulations \nthat HUD determined necessary to fully implement VAWA 2013. The public comment period on the April 1, 2015, \nrule closed on June 1, 2015. HUD received 94 comments, including duplicate mass mailings, resulting in 68 distinct \ncomments. The comments were submitted by housing authorities, other housing providers, organizations that \nrepresent or provide services to specific groups of housing providers, organizations that advocate for victims and \nsurvivors of domestic and sexual violence, state coalitions against domestic violence, other advocacy and not-for-\n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=HUD-2013-0074\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=HUD-2013-0074\n\n\nprofit organizations and associations, state and local government agencies, a tribal organization, and numerous \nunaffiliated individuals. All public comments can be viewed at:            \nhttp://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=HUD-2015-0028.\n \n  Most commenters expressed support for the rule, with different questions and comments about specific provisions. \nThere were many comments regarding emergency transfers, lease bifurcation, and documentation requirements, as \nwell as comments on eligibility for and limitations on VAWA protections, the roles and responsibilities of different \nhousing providers under different HUD programs, the notice of occupancy rights, implementation and enforcement \nof the rule, confidentiality, and other issues. In addition, there were a number of program-specific comments. HUD \nresponds to issues raised by the public comments in Section II.B. of this preamble.\n \n\n  This final rule reflects the Federal government's recognition that all people have a right to live their lives safely. On \nSeptember 9, 2014, in Presidential Proclamation 9164\u2014Twentieth Anniversary of the Violence Against Women \nAct, and on September 30, 2014, in Presidential Proclamation 9181\u2014National Domestic Violence Awareness \nMonth, 2014, President Obama discussed the \u201cbasic human right to be free from violence and abuse.\u201d The \nimplementation of the policies laid out in this rule will help to enforce this basic human right.\n \n\n  HUD notes that, in addition to utilizing housing protections in VAWA, victims of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, and stalking, and those assisting them, may wish to consider other available protections \nand assistance. On the Federal level, for example, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) administers programs that \nprovide funding for victims of crime, including victims covered by VAWA. The Office for Victims of Crime (OVC), \npart of DOJ, administers the Crime Victims Fund, which provides direct reimbursement to crime victims for financial \nlosses from crimes including medical costs, mental health counseling, and lost wages or loss of support. This \nprovides reimbursement for victims during a time when they may be facing financial constraints. The Crime Victims \nFund may also be used to fund transitional housing and shelter for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, \nsexual assault, or stalking who need the transitional housing or shelter because they were a victim of one of these \ncrimes, and to fund relocation expenses for those who need to move because they were a victims of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. OVC also provides grants to public and non-profit \norganizations for essential services to victims of crime, including emergency shelter, and the Office of Violence \nAgainst Women (OVW), also part of DOJ, administers 24 grant programs where funds are provided to states, \nterritories, local government, non-profit organizations, and community organizations for various targeted persons. \nInformation about the Crime Victims Fund is available at:            \nhttp://www.ovc.gov/pubs/crimevictimsfundfs/intro.html#VictimAssist and information about OVW grants is available \nat            http://www.justice.gov/ovw/grant-programs. Victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, \nand stalking may consult with local victim services providers and state and local social service agencies to \ndetermine whether funding and other forms of help and support may be available.\n \n\n  Further, victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking should be aware that State \nand local laws may provide greater protections than Federal law, and local victim service providers and social \nservice agencies may have further information regarding this.\n <h3>\n  II. This Final Rule</h3>\n <h4>\n  A. Overview of Changes Made at the Final Rule Stage</h4>\n \n  After review and consideration of the public comments and upon HUD's further consideration of VAWA 2013 and \nthe issues raised in the proposed rule, HUD has made certain changes in this final rule. The following highlights the \nsubstantive changes made by HUD in this final rule from the proposed rule.\n \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=HUD-2015-0028\nhttp://www.ovc.gov/pubs/crimevictimsfundfs/intro.html#VictimAssist\nhttp://www.justice.gov/ovw/grant-programs\n\n\n  The final rule:\n \n  \n\n   Clarifies that, consistent with HUD's nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements, victims of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking cannot be discriminated against on the basis of any \nprotected characteristics (including race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, national origin, or age), and \nHUD programs must also be operated consistently with HUD's Equal Access Rule (HUD-assisted and HUD-insured \nhousing must be made available to all otherwise eligible individuals and families without regard to actual or \nperceived sexual orientation, gender identity or marital status). (See \u00a7&thinsp;5.2001(a).)\n  \n\n   Provides that in regulations governing short-term supported housing, emergency shelters, and safe havens, these \nforms of shelter are subject to the core protections of VAWA that prohibit denial of admission or eviction or \ntermination to an individual solely on the basis that the individual is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, \nor stalking, or sexual assault. (See \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;574.604(a)(2), 576.409(f), and 578.99(j)(9).)\n  \n   Revises the definition of \u201caffiliated individual\u201d to incorporate situations where an individual has guardianship over \nanother individual who is not a child. (See \u00a7&thinsp;5.2003.)\n  \n\n   Revises the definition of \u201cdomestic violence\u201d to incorporate a definition of \u201cspouse or intimate partner\u201d rather than \ncross-reference to another definition of the term, and to eliminate the cross-reference to \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d a more \nrestricting term. (See \u00a7&thinsp;5.2003.)\n  \n   Provides that existing tenants in HUD-covered programs receive HUD's Notice of Occupancy Rights and \naccompanying certification form no later than one year after this rule takes effect, during the annual recertification or \nlease renewal process, if applicable, or through other means if there will be no annual recertification or lease \nrenewal process for a tenant. (See \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(a)(2)(iv).)\n  \n   Retains the provision of HUD's regulations implementing VAWA 2005, for those HUD programs covered by \nVAWA 2005, which states that the HUD-required lease, lease addendum, or tenancy addendum must include a \ndescription of the specific protections afforded to the victims of VAWA crimes. (See \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(a)(4).)\n  \n   Clarifies that applicants may not be denied assistance and tenants may not have assistance terminated under a \ncovered housing program for factors resulting from the fact that the applicant or tenant is or has been a victim of a \nVAWA crime. (See \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(b)(1).)\n  \n\n   Emphasizes that victims of sexual assault may qualify for an emergency transfer if they either reasonably believe \nthere is a threat of imminent harm from further violence if they remain in their dwelling unit, or the sexual assault \noccurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the date of the request for transfer. (See \n\u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e)(2)(ii).)\n  \n   Provides that emergency transfer plans must detail the measure of any priority given to tenants who qualify for an \nemergency transfer under VAWA in relation to other categories of individuals seeking transfers or placement on \nwaiting lists. (See \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e)(3).)\n  \n   Provides that emergency transfer plans must allow for a tenant to transfer to a new unit when a safe unit is \nimmediately available and the tenant would not have to apply in order to occupy the new unit \n(\u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e)(5)).\n  \n\n\n\n   Provides that emergency transfer plans must describe policies for assisting tenants to make emergency transfers \nwhen a safe unit is not immediately available, both for situations where a tenant would not have to apply in order to \noccupy the new unit, and where the tenant would have to apply in order to occupy the new unit. (See \n\u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e)(6), \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e)(7), and \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e)(8)).\n  \n   Provides that the emergency transfer plans must describe policies for assisting tenants who have tenant-based \nrental assistance to make emergency moves with that assistance. (\u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e)(9)).\n  \n\n   Adds a provision that emergency transfer plans may require documentation, as long as tenants can establish \neligibility for an emergency transfer by submitting a written certification to their housing provider, and no other \ndocumentation is required for tenants who have established that they are victims of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, or stalking to verify eligibility for a transfer. (See \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e)(10).)\n  \n   Requires housing providers to make emergency transfer plans available upon request, and to make them publicly \navailable whenever feasible. (See \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e)(11).)\n  \n   Provides for a six-month transition period to complete an emergency transfer plan and provide emergency \ntransfers, when requested, under such plan. (See \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e) or applicable program regulations)\n  \n   Emphasizes that tenants and applicants may choose which of the forms of documentation listed in the rule to give \nto housing providers to document the occurrence of a VAWA crime. (See \u00a7&thinsp;5.2007(b)(1).)\n  \n   Provides that in cases of conflicting evidence, tenants and applicants who may need to submit third-party \ndocumentation to document occurrence of a VAWA crime have 30 calendar days to submit the third-party \ndocumentation. (See \u00a7&thinsp;5.2007(b)(2).)\n  \n   Provides that if a covered housing provider bifurcates a lease under VAWA, any remaining tenants who had not \nalready established eligibility for assistance must be given either the maximum time permitted by statute, or, if there \nare no statutory prohibitions, at least 90 calendar days from the date of bifurcation of the lease or until expiration of \nthe lease, depending on the covered housing program, to establish eligibility for a covered housing program, or find \nalternative housing (See \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009(b)(2).)\n  \n   Provides that if a family in a HOME-assisted rental unit separates under \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009(a), the remaining \ntenant(s) will retain the unit. (See \u00a7&thinsp;92.359(d)(1).)\n  \n   Provides that if a family receiving HOME tenant-based rental assistance separates under \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009(a), the \ntenant(s) who are not removed will retain the HOME tenant-based rental assistance, and the participating \njurisdiction must determine whether a tenant who was removed from the unit will receive HOME tenant-based rental \nassistance. (See \u00a7&thinsp;92.359(d)(2).)\n  \n   Establishes VAWA regulations for the Housing Trust Fund, based on the regulations for the HOME program. (See \n24 CFR part 93.)\n  \n   Emphasizes that VAWA protections apply to eviction actions for tenants in housing under a HUD-covered housing \nprogram. (See 24 CFR 247.1(b).)\n  \n   Clarifies in the HOPWA regulations that the grantee or project sponsor is responsible for ensuring that the owner \nor manager of a facility assisted under HOPWA develops and uses a VAWA lease addendum. (See part 574.)\n  \n\n\n\n   Clarifies who is the covered housing provider for HUD's multifamily Section 8 project-based programs and the \nSection 202 and Section 811 programs, by providing that the covered housing provider is the owner for the Section \n8 Housing Assistance Payments Programs for New Construction (part 880), for Section 515 Rural Rental Housing \nProjects (part 884), and for Special Allocations (part 886), as well as for the Section 202 and Section 811 programs \n(part 891) and that PHAs and owners each have certain responsibilities as covered housing providers for the \nSection 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program (part 882), and the Section 8 State Housing Agencies Program for State \nHousing Agencies (part 883).\n  \n   Updates various section 8 and public housing VAWA 2005 regulations to broadly state that VAWA protections \napply, so that all tenants and applicants, and not only those determined to be victims of VAWA crimes, receive \nstatutorily required notification of their VAWA rights.

(See \n\u00a7&thinsp;905.100(g).)\n  \n\n   Clarifies that public housing agencies (PHAs), like other covered providers, may establish preferences for victims \nof dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, in addition to domestic violence, consistent with their statutory \nauthority.

(See \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;982.53(e), \n983.3(b).)\n \n <h4>\n\n  B. Summary of Public Comments and HUD Responses</h4>\n \n\n  As noted earlier in this preamble, the majority of the commenters expressed support for the rule, but they also \npresented questions and comments about specific provisions of the rule. The primary provisions of the rule on \nwhich commenters posted comments pertained to emergency transfers, lease bifurcation, documentation \nrequirements, eligibility for and limitations on VAWA protections, the roles and responsibilities of different housing \nproviders under different HUD programs, the notice of occupancy rights, implementation and enforcement of the \nrule, and confidentiality requirements. The following presents the significant issues raised by the commenters and \nHUD's response to the comments.\n <h5>\n  1. Applicability</h5>\n <h5>\n  a. Eligibility for VAWA Protections</h5>\n \n\n  Comment: Ensure proper evaluation of individuals who are or have been victims of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, or stalking. Commenters stated that HUD's final rule should ensure applicants are not \ndenied assistance or housing for independent bases that result from their status as a victim of domestic violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Commenters said that HUD's currently codified regulations do not \naddress how to evaluate when an applicant who is or has been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, \nsexual assault, or stalking can show that denial of assistance or housing is on that basis. Commenters stated that \nsurvivors may have negative credit, housing, or criminal records based on the violence committed against them \nthat then disqualifies them in the housing application process. Commenters said that HUD acknowledged this \nbarrier in its 2003 Public Housing Occupancy Guidebook,  (2)  which encouraged staff to exercise discretion and \ninquire about the circumstances that may have contributed to the negative reporting to determine whether domestic \n\n\n\nviolence was a factor. Commenters recommended that the final rule contain similar guidance and asked HUD to \ninclude language in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005 that applicants be provided with an opportunity to show that domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking was a factor in any negative rental, tenancy, or criminal \nrecords that would result in denial of admission or assistance; and, if it is determined such is the case, and the \napplicant otherwise qualifies, the covered housing provider must grant the application.\n \n\n  A commenter stated that HUD's final rule's definitions of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or \nstalking must be sufficiently clear so as not to cause survivors to be punished for ancillary crimes as a result of the \nabuse they have suffered or cause survivors to be blamed for the abuse. Commenters said some survivors have \nbeen evicted because they \u201cinvited\u201d the perpetrator into the home and subsequently received an eviction notice \nunder Crime Free Drug Free policies&thinsp; (3)  or a Crime Free Lease Addendum.  (4)  Commenters said victims \nof VAWA crimes are disadvantaged because landlords typically do not mention domestic violence, sexual violence \nor stalking in the eviction notice.\n \n\n  Some commenters asked that HUD revise \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(b) to state that an applicant may not be denied \nassistance, or a tenant have assistance terminated or be evicted \u201con the basis or as a result of the fact that the \napplicant or tenant is or has been a victim of domestic violence . . .\u201d in order to clarify that victims are protected \nfrom the results of economic abuse, such as poor credit.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD interprets the term \u201con the basis\u201d in VAWA 2013's statutory prohibitions against denying \nadmission to, denying assistance under, terminating a tenant from participation in, or evicting a tenant from housing \n\u201con the basis\u201d that the applicant or tenant is or has been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault, or stalking, to include factors directly resulting from the domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, \nor stalking. For example, if an individual has a poor rental or credit history, or a criminal record, or other adverse \nfactors that directly result from being a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, the \nindividual cannot be denied assistance under a HUD program if the individual otherwise qualifies for the program. \nTo clarify this understanding, HUD accepts the commenters' suggestion to amend proposed \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(b), \nand the section now states that an applicant or tenant may not be denied admission to, denied assistance under, \nterminated from participation in, or evicted from housing or a housing program on the basis or as a direct result of \nthe fact that the applicant or tenant is or has been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or \nstalking, if the applicant or tenant otherwise qualifies for admission, assistance, participation, or occupancy.\n \n\n  In addition to revising \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(b), HUD will provide guidance for covered housing providers to aid how \nthey may determine whether factors that might otherwise serve as a basis for denial or termination of assistance or \neviction have directly resulted from the fact that an applicant or tenant is or has been a victim of domestic violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. As commenters noted, HUD has already provided in its Public Housing \nOccupancy Guidebook that PHAs should inquire about the circumstances that may have contributed to negative \nreporting to determine whether that negative reporting was a consequence of domestic violence.\n \n\n  Rule Change: HUD revises \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(b) to state that an applicant or tenant may not be denied admission \nto, denied assistance under, terminated from participation in, or evicted from housing or a housing program on the \nbasis or as a direct result of the fact that the applicant or tenant is or has been a victim of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, or stalking, of the applicant or tenant otherwise qualifies for admission, assistance, \nparticipation, or occupancy.\n \n  Comment: Include victims of \u201ceconomic abuse\u201d as covered by VAWA protections. Commenters stated that VAWA \n2013 was meant to protect victims of economic abuse, the legislative history of the statute contains many \nreferences to the effects of economic abuse, and the final rule should clarify that VAWA protections apply to victims \n\n\n\nof economic abuse. Commenters said economic abuse includes a broad range of conduct, including but not limited \nto, interfering with the victim's employment, controlling how money is spent, forcing the victim to write bad checks, \nincurring significant debt in the victim's name, or otherwise harming the victim's financial security. Commenters \nstated that persons who have poor credit, no credit or an inability to access money can be denied housing, which \noften results in homelessness. Commenters said the proposed definition of \u201cstalking\u201d eliminates the harassment \nand intimidation considerations that arguably make economic abuse a form of stalking under current regulations, \nand the consequence is removing protections available to current tenants, and this runs counter to VAWA 2013, \nwhich is intended to increase not reduce protections.\n \n  Commenters suggested that HUD add economic abuse to the scope of VAWA protections in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2001 and \nto the list of protected victims throughout \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005. A commenter said that, should HUD determine not to \nrevise the text of the regulations to address economic abuse, HUD should nevertheless clarify that VAWA covers \neconomic abuse.\n \n  Commenters also suggested that HUD establish a notification and certification process to ensure that victims of \neconomic abuse receive VAWA protections. Commenters said a victim of economic abuse could supply a \ncertification regarding such abuse when applying for a HUD program. Commenters said that whenever an \nindividual's ability to participate in a HUD program is compromised due to economic factors, the individual must be \nnotified that VAWA protections may apply.\n \n\n  HUD Response: As previously discussed, HUD interprets VAWA to prohibit covered housing providers from \ndenying admission to, denying assistance under, terminating a tenant from participation in, or evicting a tenant from \nhousing as a result of factors directly resulting from the domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or \nstalking. Where an individual faces adverse economic factors, such as a poor credit or rental history, that result \nfrom being a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, the individual cannot be \ndenied assistance under a HUD program if the individual otherwise qualifies for the program. HUD declines, \nhowever, to explicitly state in regulation that victims of economic abuse receive the protections of VAWA. Such \nexpansion would be beyond the scope of HUD's VAWA rulemaking, which is intended to implement the housing \nprotections in VAWA 2013, as enacted. VAWA 2013 does not independently provide protections for victims of \neconomic abuse who are not also victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. HUD \nalso declines to implement a process in this rule where applicants who are denied admission to or assistance under \na HUD program specifically due to their economic situations will then receive notice that they may be protected \nunder VAWA and be provided an opportunity to show that their economic situation is a result of economic abuse. \nBoth VAWA 2013 and this final rule provide that applicants will be provided with notice when they are denied \nassistance or admission under a covered housing program for any reason. Applicants would then have the \nopportunity to assert that they are or were victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or \nstalking, and that they are eligible for VAWA protections.\n \n\n  As described in the proposed rule, VAWA 2013 removed the statutory definition of stalking that HUD incorporated \ninto the rule implementing VAWA 2005, but maintained a universal definition of stalking that applies throughout \nVAWA, as codified in 42 U.S.C. 13925(a)(30). As a result, this rule replaces the statutorily removed definition of \nstalking with the universal definition of stalking in VAWA. HUD disagrees with the commenters' assertion that this \nchange reduces VAWA protections by eliminating harassment and intimidation considerations. The previous \ndefinition of \u201cstalking\u201d included specific actions (including harassment and intimidation) that either placed a person \nin reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury or caused substantial emotional harm. The universal definition of \n\u201cstalking,\u201d provided in this final rule, involves any course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a \nreasonable person to fear for their own safety or the safety of others, or suffer substantial emotional distress.\n \n  Comment: Clarify which individuals are entitled to VAWA protections: Commenters stated that the rule and related \ndocuments provided to tenants and applicants must be clear about which individuals are entitled to VAWA \n\n\n\nprotections. A commenter stated that the final rule should clarify that VAWA protections do not apply to guests, \nunauthorized residents, or service providers hired by the resident, such as live in aides. In contrast to these \ncommenters, other commenters stated that live-in aides should be covered by VAWA protections under certain \ncircumstances. Commenters stated that, although live-in aides are not parties to the lease they are listed as \nhousehold members on tenant certifications and subject to the covered property's \u201chouse rules,\u201d and HUD requires \nthat the covered property be their sole residence. The commenters concluded that under these circumstances live-\nin aides are similar to tenants. Commenters further said that in the case where a tenant is abusing the live-in aide, \nthe aide can leave the tenant's employ and VAWA protections would not apply, but in the case where the live-in \naide is a victim of abuse by someone living outside the unit and the tenant continues to require the aide's services, \nthe housing provider should be required to offer the household all VAWA protections and the entire household \n(including the aide) should qualify for an emergency transfer.\n \n\n  Another commenter stated that the proposed rule advised that if an unreported member of the household is the \nvictim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, the tenant may not be evicted because of \nsuch action as long as the tenant was not the perpetrator. The commenter stated that, in the proposed rule, HUD \nagreed with comments that VAWA protections should not extend to individuals violating program regulations, such \nas housing unauthorized occupants. The commenter stated that HUD's statement seems contradictory because \nHUD is in effect extending VAWA protections to a tenant who violates program regulations by allowing a person \nwho is not authorized to reside in the unit. The commenter asked HUD to advise how to respond if a housing \nprovider learns of the existence of an unreported member of the household in violation of program regulations, \nbased solely on a tenant's reporting of a VAWA incident against the unreported member. The commenter said \nHUD's rule does not establish a clear nexus for the prohibition against denial or termination of assistance \u201con the \nbasis\u201d that an applicant or tenant is or has been a domestic violence victim.\n \n  Other commenters stated that the preamble to the proposed rule created confusion when it stated that affiliated \nindividuals do not receive VAWA protections if they are not on the lease and that the protections of VAWA are \ndirected to tenants. Commenters stated that specific protections, however, may extend to affiliated individuals or be \nlimited to tenants or lawful occupants. In support of this statement, the commenters stated that no individual may be \ndenied housing in a covered program based on the individual's status as a survivor, but the right to bifurcate the \nlease and preserve the subsidy is limited to tenants or lawful occupants. Commenters asked HUD to correct \nlanguage in the preamble to the proposed rule that they stated incorrectly construed the protections of VAWA as \napplying only to those named on the lease, and added that whether an individual is a \u201ctenant\u201d or a \u201clawful occupant\u201d \nis a question of State law on which HUD should not take a position, as this could conflict with State law. \nCommenters further stated that, as part of the dynamics of an abusive relationship, a survivor will often not be listed \nas a tenant on the lease but may be a lawful occupant. Commenters concluded their comments stating that, to limit \nprotections to \u201ctenants\u201d or to individuals specifically named on the lease, without regard for how a lawful occupant \nmight be characterized under State or local laws, undermines the very purpose of VAWA.\n \n\n  HUD Response: Only tenants who are assisted by a covered housing program can invoke the VAWA protections \nthat apply solely to tenants. Several provisions in VAWA 2013, including the prohibited basis for denial or \ntermination of assistance or eviction and the emergency transfer protection, apply to \u201ctenants,\u201d a term that VAWA \n2013 does not define. The term \u201ctenant\u201d refers to an assisted family and the members of the household on their \nlease, but does not include guests or unreported members of a household. In addition, a live-in aide or caregiver is \nnot a tenant, unless otherwise provided by program regulations, and cannot invoke VAWA protections. However, as \nis the case for anyone, a live-in aide or other service provider is entitled to VAWA protections if the person becomes \nan applicant for HUD assistance; that is, one does not have to have been a tenant in HUD subsidized housing to \ninvoke VAWA protections in later applying to become a tenant in HUD subsidized housing.\n \n\n\n\n  A live-in aide or a guest could be an affiliated individual of a tenant, and if that aide or guest is a victim of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, the tenant with whom the affiliated individual is associated \ncannot be evicted or have assistance terminated on the basis that the affiliated individual was a victim of a VAWA \ncrime. Moreover, where a live-in aide is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, \nand the tenant seeks to maintain the services of the live-in aide, the housing provider cannot require that the live-in \naide be removed from the household on the grounds of being a victim of abuse covered by VAWA. The live-in aide \nresides in the unit as a reasonable accommodation for the tenant with a disability. Indeed, to require removal of the \nlive-in aide solely because the aide is a victim of abuse covered by VAWA likely would violate Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act, the Fair Housing Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, as applicable, which require \nhousing providers to permit such reasonable accommodations. In addition, if a tenant requests and qualifies for an \nemergency transfer on the grounds that the live-in aide is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault, or stalking, the tenant's entire household, which includes the live-in aide, can be transferred.\n \n\n  Section 5.2005(d)(2) of this final rule states that covered housing providers can evict or terminate assistance to a \ntenant for any violation not premised on an act of domestic violence. However, if an individual, who is a victim of \ndomestic violence, has an unreported member residing in the individual's household and the individual is afraid of \nasking the unreported member to leave because of the individual's domestic violence experience, then terminating \nthe individual's tenancy because of the unreported household member would be \u201cpremised on an act of domestic \nviolence.\u201d Therefore, depending on the situation, a tenant who violates program regulations by housing a person \nnot authorized to reside in the unit could be covered by VAWA's anti-discrimination provisions, and eligible for \nremedies provided under VAWA.\n \n\n  As discussed above, HUD interprets the term \u201con the basis\u201d in VAWA 2013's prohibitions against denying \nadmission to, denying assistance under, terminating a tenant from participation in, or evicting a tenant from housing \n\u201con the basis\u201d that the applicant or tenant is or has been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault, or stalking, to include factors directly resulting from the domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, \nor stalking.\n \n\n  With respect to the comments about applying the VAWA protections to survivors of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, and stalking whether they are named on the lease or not, HUD notes that the term \u201clawful \noccupant\u201d is not defined in VAWA 2013 and appears in the statute four times in the following contexts: (i) In the \ndefinition of \u201caffiliated individual\u201d as a type of \u201caffiliated individual\u201d; (ii) in the documentation section of the statute as \nthose who could be evicted if they commit violations of the lease if the applicant or tenant does not provide \nrequested documentation; (iii) in the bifurcation section, as those who could be evicted for engaging in criminal \nactivity directly relating to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking; and (iv) as those who \nmight not be negatively affected if a lease is bifurcated. Other than stating that a housing provider may, at the \nprovider's discretion, bifurcate a lease without penalizing a lawful occupant, VAWA 2013 does not provide \nprotections or benefits for lawful occupants.\n \n  Comment: Clarify whether housing providers who have a mixed portfolio of projects and units will be required to \noffer protection for some tenants but will not be required to offer them to others. Commenters asked whether \nhousing providers that have both covered and non-covered projects will be faced with offering protections for \ntenants in only some of their properties. Other commenters stated that certain HUD-assisted properties have some \nunits that must abide by HUD regulations, while others are not subject to HUD regulations. Commenter asked HUD \nto confirm whether, in such a complex, some tenants would be eligible for VAWA protections while others would not \nbe.\n \n\n\n\n  HUD Response: VAWA 2013 and HUD's rule apply only to HUD-covered housing programs. Therefore, covered \nhousing providers will be required to provide VAWA protections to tenants and applicants under the covered \nhousing programs, but will not be required to provide such protections to other tenants and applicants. Although this \nrule only applies to tenants in and applicants to HUD-covered housing programs, housing providers may choose to \noffer VAWA protections and remedies to all tenants and applicants, where applicable. HUD encourages housing \nproviders to provide VAWA's core protections\u2014not denying or terminating assistance to victims of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking\u2014to all tenants and applicants. HUD also encourages \nhousing providers to offer all VAWA protections, such as emergency transfer and bifurcation provisions, to all \ntenants where possible.\n \n\n  All housing providers should be aware of other Federal, State and local laws that may provide similar or more \nextensive rights to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. For example, \nproperties funded with Low-Income Housing Credits (LIHTCs) are also subject to VAWA requirements, and housing \nproviders should look to the regulatory agency responsible for LIHTCs\u2014the Department of Treasury\u2014for how to \nimplement VAWA protections in those properties.\n \n\n  Housing providers should also be aware more generally of other Federal fair housing and civil rights laws that may \nbe applicable, including, but not limited to, the Fair Housing Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. For example, housing providers might violate the \nFair Housing Act under a discriminatory effects theory if they have an unjustified policy of evicting victims of \ndomestic violence, as such a policy might disproportionately harm females or individuals that have another \nprotected characteristic.\n \n  Comment: Clarify whether VAWA protections can be invoked on multiple occasions and whether other limits to \nprotections could apply. Commenters asked whether there is a limit to the number of times covered housing \nproviders must provide VAWA protections when the victim continues to allow the perpetrator access to the property. \nAnother commenter said that one of the recurring issues for housing providers is that victims may evoke VAWA \nprotections repeatedly but then invite or allow the perpetrator into their unit, often leading to repeated instances of \nabuse and danger or disturbance for other households at the property. Commenter asked whether, in order to \ncontinue to invoke VAWA protections, VAWA allows covered housing providers to require that a victim obtain a \nrestraining order against the perpetrator, notify local law enforcement if a restraining order is being violated, or \nrefuse to invite or allow the perpetrator onto the property.\n \n  In contrast to this comment, another commenter stated that HUD's final rule should make clear that a tenant or \nfamily can be entitled to VAWA protection on more than one occasion and cannot be subjected to additional \nconditions that adversely affect their tenancy because they have invoked VAWA protections. The commenter said it \nhas dealt with covered housing providers that decided to impose additional requirements on tenants who sought \nVAWA protections, such as requiring tenants to obtain protective orders or call the police, conditions they do not \nimpose on other tenants, including those who are victims of other crimes (non-VAWA crimes), and this violates \nVAWA.  (5)  The commenter said these requirements conflict with recognized best practices that affirm that the \nmost effective way to ensure a survivor's safety is to respect the survivor's autonomy in deciding whether to obtain \na protective order or to call the police.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD agrees that a tenant or family may invoke VAWA protections on more than one occasion \nand cannot be subjected to additional conditions that adversely affect their tenancy because they have invoked \nVAWA protections. Individuals and families may be subject to abuse or violence on multiple occasions and it would \nbe contrary to the intent of VAWA to say that the protections no longer apply after a certain point, even if violence \nor abuse continues, or the victim and the victim's family members are still in danger. In cases where the presence \nof the perpetrator on the property will endanger others, not solely the unit in which the perpetrator resides, this final \n\n\n\nrule maintains the provision that a housing provider may evict or terminate assistance to a tenant if the housing \nprovider can demonstrate an actual and imminent threat to other tenants, or those employed at or providing \nservices to the property, if the tenant is not evicted or assistance is not terminated. However, as discussed \nelsewhere in this rule, housing providers should only take such actions when there are no other actions that could \nbe taken to reduce or eliminate the threat.\n \n\n  Allowing housing providers to apply a different occupancy standard to survivors of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, and stalking than that applied to victims of other crimes violates the intent of VAWA, \nwhich provides that housing providers cannot discriminate against survivors and victims of a VAWA crime. HUD \nalso agrees that survivors do not have to contact authorities, such as police, or initiate legal proceedings against an \nabuser or perpetrator in order to qualify for VAWA protections. The statute has no such requirements and instead \nallows survivors to provide self-certification about the VAWA incident(s).\n \n\n  Comment: Eliminate or better explain the provision that eviction or termination of assistance should only be used \nas a last resort. A commenter stated that HUD retains paragraph (d)(3) of currently codified \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005, which \nencourages a covered housing provider to evict or terminate assistance only when there are no other actions that \ncould be taken to reduce or eliminate the threat of domestic violence. The commenter said the ability of housing \nproviders to avoid eviction or termination will vary widely depending on factors that are generally out of the control \nof the provider, and that HUD inserted paragraph (d)(3) of \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005 during a prior rulemaking. The \ncommenter stated that this language is not in the VAWA statute, and should be stricken. With respect to this \nprovision, another commenter asked how far a landlord is expected to go to keep the property safe, how much the \nlandlord is expected to expend to ensure the safety of tenants, and what responsibility the tenants have in ensuring \ntheir own safety.\n \n\n  HUD Response: As the commenter noted, \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(d)(3)\u2014now designated as \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(d)(4)\u2014is \nalready in HUD's VAWA regulations and is in effect. HUD has no reason to eliminate this provision now, as VAWA \n2013 was meant to expand, and not to retract VAWA protections. HUD agrees with the commenter that the ability \nand resources of the housing provider to provide alternatives to evictions will vary, just as the circumstances of the \nabuse and the safety needs of the victim will vary. This variation, however, does not preclude a policy that sets \neviction as the last resort.\n <h5>\n  b. Covered Programs</h5>\n \n  Comment: List all program/subsidy types to which VAWA regulations apply. Commenters said HUD regulations \nshould specifically list all programs and subsidy types to which VAWA protections apply, and not solely those listed \nin the statute. A commenter said this is necessary because there are many HUD programs that fall under the \nmultifamily umbrella and, in the past, VAWA requirements for the Section 8 programs differed from other program \ntypes. Another commenter said it does not appear that VAWA applies to certain Section 202 Direct Loan Projects \nthat do not have project-based Section 8 assistance, or to certain Section 221(d)(3)/(d)(5) Below Market Interest \nRate (BMIR) projects, or to certain Section 236 projects. Commenter asked whether these programs would be \nincluded. Another commenter said there should be an easier way to explain which programs do not fall under \nVAWA.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD's final rule lists all HUD programs covered by VAWA 2013 in the definition of covered \nhousing program, and addresses questions about specific programs below.\n \n  Comment: The Housing Trust Fund was not listed in VAWA as a covered program. Commenters expressed \nconcern about HUD's coverage of the Housing Trust Fund (HTF) program, which was not specifically identified as a \n\n\n\n\u201ccovered housing program\u201d in the VAWA statute, and, said that without specific statutory authority to apply VAWA to \nHTF, either a tenant or housing provider could challenge the rule and its application, which could lead to litigation \nexpenses for all parties. Other commenters stated that HTF should be a covered program. Commenters stated that \nsuch coverage is consistent with Congressional intent, which, through VAWA 2013, sought to expand VAWA \nprotections to all HUD programs that provide rental assistance. The commenters further stated that maintaining \nsimilarity in the regulatory treatment of HOME and HTF is efficient for program participants and appropriate \nbecause many of the HTF's program requirements are similar to those that apply to the HOME program.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD maintains the HTF program as a covered program in this final rule. HUD has authority to \nestablish regulations for its programs where they do not conflict with other laws. Rather than conflicting with VAWA \n2013, including the HTF program as a covered program aligns with the intent of the law, which expanded the \nprotections of VAWA to HUD's programs that provide rental assistance. As noted in the preamble to the proposed \nrule and, as commenters have themselves said, the HTF program is very similar to the HOME program and to \nHUD, it is not logical to exclude the HTF program.\n \n  Rule Change: This final rule adds \u00a7&thinsp;93.356 (VAWA requirements) to the HTF interim regulations, which \ngenerally applies the same VAWA requirements to HTF as apply to the HOME program at 92.359. This final rule \nalso revises \u00a7&thinsp;93.303 (Tenant protections and selection) by revising \u00a7&thinsp;93.303(a) and adding \n\u00a7&thinsp;93.303(d)(7) to mirror \u00a7&thinsp;92.253 (a) and \u00a7&thinsp;92.253(d)(7) of this final rule's HOME regulations. \nIn addition, this rule revises \u00a7&thinsp;93.404(c) to state that written agreements with subgrantees and eligible \nrecipients must set forth all obligations the grantee imposes on them in order to meet the VAWA requirements \nunder \u00a7&thinsp;93.356, including notice obligations and obligations under the emergency transfer plan.\n \n  Comment: All Section 202 Direct Loan projects should be subject to VAWA protections. Commenters said the \nproposed rule was not clear as to why Section 202 Direct Loan projects without project-based rental assistance \nwere excluded from VAWA protections, and recommended that HUD include these properties. Another commenter \nsaid that HUD's decision to exclude the Section 202 Direct Loan program from VAWA's coverage is based on an \ninterpretation that is unnecessarily restrictive and violates the VAWA statute. A commenter stated VAWA 2013's \nplain statutory language is broad in scope, expressing no further limitation or ambiguity, and any property funded \nunder Section 202 qualifies. Other commenters said that covering Section 202 Direct Loan properties without \nSection 8 contracts extends these important protections to all similar HUD-supported housing programs, which \nfollows congressional and HUD intent.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD maintains that its interpretation provided in the proposed rule with respect to Section 202 \nDirect loans is correct, but includes additional information to elaborate on HUD's proposed rule statement. In the \nproposed rule, at 80 FR 17752, HUD stated that section 202 of the National Housing Act of 1959 authorized HUD to \nmake long-term loans directly to multifamily housing projects and the loan proceeds are to be used to finance the \nconstruction of multifamily rental housing for persons age 62 years or older and for persons with disabilities. The \nSection 202 Direct Loan program ran from 1959 to 1990.  (6)  The purpose of the program was primarily to provide \ndirect Federal loans for the development or substantial rehabilitation of housing for the elderly or for persons with \ndisabilities. Amendments to Section 202 Direct Loan program in 1990, made by the Cranston-Gonzalez National \nAffordable Housing Act, replaced this program with capital advance programs for owners of housing designed for \nthe elderly or residents with disabilities, and established two parallel programs for the elderly and for persons with \ndisabilities\u2014the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly program and the Section 811 Supportive Housing \nfor Persons with Disabilities Program.  (7)  These two programs, which are rental programs, and which reflect the \nmajority of the legacy of the Section 202 Direct Loan program, are covered by VAWA. Further, all projects that \nreceived Section 202 direct loans and receive project-based assistance under Section 8 are required to comply with \nVAWA protections.\n \n\n\n\n  However, as mentioned in the proposed rule, there have been no new Section 202 direct loans since 1990. All \nSection 202 direct loan projects, as with projects under other HUD programs, that received any type of direct \nassistance prior to VAWA 2013 are not subject to new statutory requirements on HUD programs unless there is \nsome ongoing contractual agreement with HUD or the statute specifically speaks to retroactive application for \nexisting projects. Therefore, unless the Section 202 direct loan project has an agreement or contract with HUD \notherwise, such as with project-based assistance under Section 8, those direct loans entered into prior to 2013 \nwould not be subject to VAWA requirements because VAWA did not specifically apply its requirements \nretroactively.\n \n  Comment: Encourage, if not require, housing providers under additional Federally-financed programs to offer \nVAWA protections. Commenters asked HUD to make clear that housing providers in programs not covered by \nHUD's VAWA regulations can offer VAWA protections, and to encourage these providers to offer VAWA \nprotections. Commenters also urged HUD to ensure that all affordable units with HUD funds are subject to VAWA, \nincluding existing units that undergo affordable housing preservation efforts by HUD, such as the Rental Assistance \nDemonstration (RAD) units, Choice Neighborhood units, and multifamily units in the Rent Supplement Program. \nCommenters asked that the final rule's description of public housing explicitly include public housing that has been \nassisted by, for example, HOPE VI, Mixed Finance, Choice Neighborhoods, or converted under the RAD program. \nAnother commenter asked that HUD generally state in its regulations that VAWA applies to affordable units that \nHUD preserves and, where applicable, that the VAWA obligation be set forth in any relevant Notice of Funding \nAvailability (NOFA). Other commenters further recommended that HUD's regulations reflect HUD's authority to \nexpand VAWA protections to other types of HUD affordable housing that may be established in the future and the \nagency will do so by HUD or Federal Register notice.\n \n  A commenter also said that the proposed regulations in 24 CFR 574.604(a)(2) and 578.99(j) are too broad, and \nwhere rental assistance is provided and there is a written agreement or a lease, VAWA should apply to short-term \nsupported housing and McKinney-Vento Safe Havens. Another commenter asked for guidance that clearly allows \nsenior housing providers the option to extend VAWA protections to victim residents, even if their program type was \nnot specifically included in the statute.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD's VAWA regulations apply only to HUD-covered housing programs, but, as HUD has earlier \nstated in this preamble, housing providers have discretion to apply the rule's provisions to all tenants and applicants \nand HUD indeed encourages housing providers to provide VAWA protections to all tenants not only to those \ncovered in HUD subsidized units. With respect to HUD's authority to expand coverage to other HUD programs not \nlisted in the statute, HUD has such authority and the inclusion of the HTF program in this rule evidences such \nauthority.\n \n  Tenants in units under a HUD-covered program maintain their VAWA protections where their units are converted \nto coverage under a new HUD program. The conversion does not eliminate their VAWA protections. With respect to \nRAD, tenants in converted units continue to be covered by VAWA's protections provided under HUD's Section 8 \nProject-Based Voucher program or Project-Based Rental Assistance Program.\n \n  Choice Neighborhoods is a development tool that uses grant funds to develop housing to address struggling \nneighborhoods with distressed public or HUD-assisted housing. The assistance may come from public housing, \nRAD or HOME funds. Therefore, tenants residing in units developed with Choice funds receive VAWA protections \nunder the relevant rental subsidy programs where assistance comes from a HUD-covered housing program.\n \n  The Rent Supplement program provides continued assistance on active or newly expired original term contracts. \nThough the program is no longer active, families continue to be supported until each Rent Supplement contract \nexpires. For the VAWA protections to apply, tenants need to be residing in a project that receives Rent Supplement \npayments and is also subject to VAWA, such a section 221(d)(3)/(d)(5) project or section 236 project. Once a Rent \n\n\n\nSupplement contract expires, families may receive tenant protection vouchers and are then under the Housing \nChoice Voucher (HCV) program (i.e., the Section 8 tenant-based program), a covered housing program.\n \n  Tenants in public housing that received funding under the HOPE VI program would continue to have the same \nVAWA rights as other public housing residents.\n \n  To ensure tenants in mixed-finance projects receive VAWA protections, this final rule adds a new provision at 24 \nCFR 905.100(g) that provides that PHAs must apply the VAWA protections under part 5 for mixed finance \ndevelopments.\n \n\n  This rule maintains the provisions in \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;574.604(a)(2) and 578.99(j) that state the requirements in 24 CFR \npart 5, subpart L, that are specific to tenants or those who are applying to become tenants (such as the notice of \noccupancy rights for tenants and applicants, and bifurcation of leases and emergency transfer plans for tenants) do \nnot apply to short-term supported housing and McKinney-Vento Safe Havens, as the regulations for tenants could \nnot be applied in those contexts. However, in response to commenters' concerns, the regulations in this final rule \nexplicitly provide that safe havens and short-term supported housing are subject to the core protections of VAWA \n(the prohibitions against denying admission or terminating assistance on the basis that the individual is or has been \na victim of domestic violence, dating violence, stalking or sexual assault).\n \n  Rule Change: This rule includes a new provision at 24 CFR 905.100(g) for mixed finance developments in 24 CFR \npart 905, subpart F, which provides that public housing agencies must apply the VAWA protections in 24 CFR part \n5, subpart L.\n \n\n  This rule clarifies, in the HOPWA regulations at 24 CFR 574.604(a)(2), and the regulations for the Continuum of \nCare (CoC) program at 578.99(j), that, although the requirements in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, do not apply to short-\nterm supported housing or safe havens, no individual may be denied admission to or removed from the short-term \nsupported housing or safe haven on the basis or as a direct result of the fact that the individual is or has been a \nvictim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, if the individual otherwise qualifies for \nadmission or occupancy.\n \n  Comment: The Rural Housing Stability Assistance Program final rule should incorporate VAWA protections and \nobligations. Commenters stated that the proposed rule does not provide any amendments to the Rural Housing \nStability Assistance Program (RHSP), and commenters urged HUD to ensure that the RHSP final rule \ncomprehensively incorporates VAWA's protections and obligations. Commenters said that the RHSP proposed rule \nprovided an exception for VAWA victims who needed to relocate for safety reasons by allowing victims with tenant-\nbased assistance to move out of the county, but the requirements are inconsistent with VAWA and there is no \nmention of VAWA in the RHSP rule governing termination of assistance. Commenters asked HUD to make sure \nthat the VAWA obligations and policies of the RHSP program are consistent within HUD's homeless assistance \nprograms, as well as across all programs administered by HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development. \nCommenters recommended amending 24 CFR 579.418 and 579.424 to include references to VAWA.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates these comments, and notes that the VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2013 \noccurred prior to the publication of the RHSP proposed rule. HUD will include the applicable VAWA provisions in \nthe RHSP final rule.\n \n  Comment: HUD's rule should cover McKinney-Vento homeless shelters. Commenters said the proposed rule did \nnot include emergency shelters, as it limits the types of assistance to short or medium-term rental assistance and \npermanent or transitional housing. Commenters urged HUD to include emergency shelters in the final rule \ninterpreting programs covered under Title IV of the McKinney Vento/Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid \n\n\n\nTransition to Housing (HEARTH) Act, and to include program-specific amendments to Emergency Solutions Grants \n(ESG) and CoC regulations that clarify that emergency shelter is part of a VAWA covered housing program. A \ncommenter asked HUD specifically to address, in the shelter context, the applicability of VAWA's notice of \noccupancy rights, and the prohibition against denial of admission or assistance and termination from participation in \nshelter.\n \n\n  Commenters stated that the plain language of VAWA does not exclude shelters, and said that \u201capplicable \nassistance,\u201d which cannot be denied or terminated pursuant to VAWA, does not necessarily have to be tied to rental \nassistance. Commenters said admission and termination policies and practices at homeless shelters can often \nexclude survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking, and victims report having to \nrecount the violence and report being subject to a higher standard of admission and conditions of stay than other \nparticipants, such as producing orders of protection. Commenters said these victims are also denied admission if \nthey are considered \u201cunsafe\u201d for the program, and in family shelters, domestic violence survivors are sometimes \nterminated from the program along with the perpetrator if they are abused on the property.\n \n  Commenters said Continuums of Care often choose homeless shelter programs as the main entry point into \ncoordinated assessment, and if shelters' exclusionary practices continue without VAWA's protections, survivors \nmay be excluded from access not only to emergency shelter, but also to other resources and housing. Commenters \nsaid such practices undermine HUD's efforts to end homelessness to exclude shelters from VAWA protection \nbecause, in many CoCs, they will be the entry point through which victims experiencing homelessness access \ntenant-based rental assistance, transitional housing and other HUD-funded homelessness programs.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD agrees with the commenters that the core VAWA nondiscrimination protections should \napply to emergency shelters subsidized by HUD, and individuals are not to be denied shelter because they are \nvictims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. In this final rule, HUD adds language to \nthe ESG program regulation to make the VAWA core protections apply to emergency shelter.\n \n  However, as HUD stated in its proposed rule, the regulatory requirements in 24 CFR part 5, including the notice of \noccupancy rights, apply to assistance for rental housing, which generally involves a tenant, a landlord (the individual \nor entity that owns and/or leases rental units) and a lease specifying the occupancy rights and obligations of the \ntenant. This is because, as explained elsewhere in this rule, those VAWA protections are directed to rental housing.\n \n\n  Rule Change: In this final rule, HUD provides in 24 CFR 576.409(f) that for emergency shelters funded under 24 \nCFR 576.102, no individual or family may be denied admission to or removed from the emergency shelter on the \nbasis or as a direct result of the fact that the individual or family is or has been a victim of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, or stalking, if the individual or family otherwise qualifies for admission or occupancy.\n \n  Comment: Explain how housing providers should coordinate multiple forms of assistance for a single housing unit. \nCommenters stated that HUD's proposed rule did not address the ways in which multiple forms of assistance \ncovered by VAWA requirements may be coordinated under the HTF program, in other mixed finance properties or \nwhen multiple forms of assistance apply to a given housing unit.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD provides in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2001(b)(2) of this final rule that, when assistance is provided under \nmore than one covered housing program and there is a conflict between VAWA protections or remedies under \nthose programs, the individual seeking the VAWA protections or remedies may choose to use the protections or \nremedies under any or all of those programs, as long as the protections or remedies would be feasible and \npermissible under each of the program statutes. As explained later in this preamble, where housing is covered \nunder multiple HUD programs, the responsible housing provider under each program will provide the required \n\n\n\nNotice of Occupancy Rights and certification form, and tenants may request emergency transfers or lease \nbifurcations under any applicable program, unless prohibited from doing so because of statutory constraints. For \nexample, if a lease is bifurcated for a permanent supportive housing unit that is assisted under both HOME and the \nCoC Program, and the CoC Program rule would prohibit the remaining family member from continuing to reside in \nthe unit beyond the existing lease term, because the family member does not have a disability, then the family \nmember cannot depend on the bifurcation regulations for the HOME program to remain in the unit for longer than \nthe existing lease term.\n \n  Rule Change: HUD revises \u00a7&thinsp;5.2001(b)(2) to clarify that, when assistance is provided under more than one \ncovered housing program and there is a conflict between VAWA protections or remedies under those programs, the \nindividual seeking the VAWA protections or remedies may choose to use the protections or remedies under any or \nall of those programs, as long as the protections or remedies would be feasible and permissible under each of the \nprogram statutes.\n <h5>\n  2. Definitions and Terminology</h5>\n <h5>\n  a. General Terminology</h5>\n \n\n  Comment: Clarify that VAWA does not apply solely to women. A commenter stated that while the name of VAWA \ncannot be changed, references to VAWA could instead be made to a housing violence policy to encourage more \nindividuals to seek protections.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates this comment and has repeatedly stated in its rule, documents, and in \nguidance that VAWA applies regardless of sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation. In the very first paragraph of \nthe first regulatory section (24 CFR 5.2001(a)) HUD states that notwithstanding the title of the statute victims \ncovered by VAWA protections are not limited to women. However, HUD declines to change references to VAWA \nout of concern that this will cause confusion as to whether HUD's regulations are associated with the statute. It is \nimportant that the public are aware that these protections are mandated by statute.\n \n  HUD emphasizes in this final rule that victims cannot be discriminated against on the basis of any protected \ncharacteristic, including race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, disability, or age, and HUD \nprograms must also be operated consistently with HUD's Equal Access Rule at 24 CFR 5.105(a)(2), which requires \nthat HUD-assisted and HUD-insured housing are made available to all otherwise eligible individuals and families \nregardless of actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status.\n \n  Rule Change: In this final rule, HUD adds a provision in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2001 that states that, consistent with the \nnondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements at 24 CFR 5.105(a), victims cannot be discriminated against \non the basis of any protected characteristic, including race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, \ndisability, or age, and HUD programs must also be operated consistently with HUD's Equal Access Rule at 24 CFR \n5.105(a)(2)\n \n\n  Comment: Use terminology that applies to all VAWA victims. In order to support housing providers in considering \nthe needs of sexual assault victims, commenters recommended that HUD always list the four protected crimes \nseparately (domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking) rather than using umbrella terms like \n\u201cdomestic and sexual violence.\u201d Commenters stated that the self-certification form collectively refers to domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking as \u201cdomestic violence,\u201d but they advised that this can \ncause confusion for a survivor of stalking or sexual assault whose perpetrator may have been a stranger, and to \nensure all survivors covered under VAWA protections are aware of their rights, \u201cdomestic violence\u201d should not be \nused as a catch-all term, and each term should be used separately. Commenters further suggested that HUD use \n\n\n\nterms like \u201cperpetrator\u201d rather than \u201cabuser\u201d to fit a multiple crimes context. Commenters also said that HUD should \nnot solely reference victims fleeing from abuse, but also those recovering from violence in order to better address \nthe nature of trauma from the impact of sexual violence.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates these comments and agrees with the concerns expressed by the commenters. \nHUD has revised the certification form, notice of occupancy rights, and model emergency transfer plan to list the \nfour protected crimes separately, and to use the term \u201cperpetrator\u201d in lieu of, or in addition to the term \u201cabuser\u201d \nwhen referencing a person who commits one of the VAWA crimes. HUD has also revised the notice of rights and \nmodel emergency transfer plan to provide resources for victims of sexual assault and stalking, in addition to \nresources for victims of domestic violence.\n <h5>\n  b. Affiliated Individual</h5>\n \n  Comment: The definition of \u201caffiliated individual\u201d and its use in the proposed rule is not clear. Commenters said \nHUD's proposed rule indicated that HUD's replacement of, \u201cimmediate family members,\u201d with \u201caffiliated individual\u201d \nwill include any legitimate household member, whether a family member or not. Commenters said the language in \nthe proposed rule appeared to reach beyond that as the proposed rule included \u201cany individual, tenants, or lawful \noccupants.\u201d Commenters stated that inclusion of \u201cany individual\u201d is separate from \u201clawful occupant,\u201d further stating \nthat these two classes are not identical. A commenter said that if \u201cany individual\u201d refers to an unauthorized \noccupant, then the regulations must explain what protections, if any, such individuals may receive if the individual is \na victim of a VAWA crime or is an innocent household member in a household where a VAWA crime was \ncommitted. The commenter asked, for example, if those who are not tenants or lawful occupants would be afforded \na reasonable time to establish eligibility for a covered housing program following a lease bifurcation. Commenters \nsaid that if the term \u201cany individual\u201d refers to an unauthorized occupant, the regulation should state that this \nindividual has no rights to the unit. Another commenter said the definition of \u201cany individual\u201d must explicitly exclude \nguests or illegitimate occupants. Another commenter said the final rule should clarify that an affiliated individual can \nonly be somebody lawfully living in the household. The commenter said that while VAWA protections apply only to \nlawful tenants, the rule asserts an affiliated individual may receive indirect benefits, but the final rule should clarify \nVAWA benefits do not apply to unreported or unauthorized members of the household.\n \n\n  HUD Response: Under VAWA 2013 and HUD's regulations, the term \u201caffiliated individual\u201d does not refer to the \ntenant who requests or is eligible for VAWA protections. Rather, an affiliated individual refers to a person who has a \ncertain relationship to a tenant who is eligible for VAWA protections and remedies.\n \n\n  Under both VAWA 2013 and HUD's regulations, a tenant may not be denied tenancy or occupancy rights solely on \nthe basis of criminal activity directly relating to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking if that \ntenant or an affiliated individual of the tenant is the victim or threatened victim of such domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault or stalking. In essence, the inclusion of affiliated individual is to add a further protection for \ntenants by providing that a VAWA crime committed against an affiliated individual, an individual without VAWA \nprotections, is not a basis for denying or terminating assistance to the tenant. HUD declines to change or limit the \ndefinition of \u201caffiliated individual\u201d to exclude \u201cany individual.\u201d The statute provides that the term includes any \nindividual \u201cliving in the household of the person who is eligible for VAWA protections.\u201d\n \n  Comment: HUD's language change from \u201cin loco parentis\u201d may not include guardianships of non-competent \nadults. Commenters stated that the definition of \u201caffiliated individual\u201d refers repeatedly to relationships with children, \nbut the definition should include all circumstances where a household member has some form of guardianship over \na non-competent household member of any age.\n \n\n\n\n  HUD Response: The statutory definition of \u201caffiliated individual\u201d includes any individual living in the household of a \nperson, and therefore a non-competent household member would be included as an affiliated individual. However, \nthe familial and close relationships in the first part of the definition of affiliated individual do not require that the \naffiliated individual live in the same household as the person seeking VAWA protections. HUD appreciates the \ncommenter's concern that HUD's change from the statutory phrase \u201cin loco parentis\u201d to language regarding a \nrelationship like that of a parent to a child may be under-inclusive. HUD has revised the definition of \u201caffiliated \nindividual\u201d to include a relationship where an individual has a guardianship of another individual, regardless of age.\n \n  Rule Change: HUD revises the definition of \u201caffiliated individual\u201d in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2003 to provide that affiliated \nindividual, with respect to an individual, means: (A) A spouse, parent, brother, sister, or child of that individual, or a \nperson to whom that individual stands in the place of a parent or guardian (for example, the affiliated individual is a \nperson in the care, custody, or control of that individual); or (B) any individual, tenant, or lawful occupant living in the \nhousehold of that individual.\n <h5>\n  c. Covered Housing Provider</h5>\n \n  Comment: Clarify which covered housing provider has which responsibilities under VAWA. Commenters stated \nthat in sections of the proposed regulation on HUD's multifamily Section 8 project-based programs in 24 CFR parts \n880, 882, 883, 884, 886, and 891, the covered housing provider is defined as either the PHA or the owner, \ndepending on the circumstances; for example, the commenter stated, the definition provides that the PHA would be \nresponsible for providing the notice of occupancy rights and certification form. The commenters questioned this \nresponsibility since PHAs under these programs do not have the contact with applicants or tenants that owners \nhave, and said this is more properly an owner's responsibility, particularly when serving a notice of eviction. A \ncommenter said that HUD should provide copies of the notice and certification form to the owner, and then the \nowner must provide the notice and form when required.\n \n  Commenters also said HUD's proposed rule identifies the PHA as the entity responsible for providing the \nreasonable time to establish eligibility for assistance following bifurcation of a lease for HUD's multifamily Section 8 \nproject-based programs, but \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009(b) of the rule defines the time that a tenant has to establish eligibility \nfor assistance and does not give a covered housing provider flexibility in that regard. A commenter said that, it is the \nowner, not the PHA that establishes eligibility, and therefore, it should be the owner, not the PHA, to provide the \nreasonable time to establish eligibility.\n \n  A commenter stated that the definition of \u201ccovered housing provider\u201d in 24 CFR parts 880, 882, 884, 886, 891, \n982, and 983 was proposed, in the April 1, 2015, proposed rule to be the same as in 24 CFR part 883. The \ncommenter encouraged HUD to review the definition of covered housing provider in the context of how each of the \nprograms is actually administered and reevaluated whether the definition is appropriate. A commenter \nrecommended that any activity that requires an interaction with a tenant should be assigned to the owner or its \nmanager; and a State housing agency should be responsible only for monitoring the delivery of appropriate notices \nand that correct policies are in place and being followed. The commenter stated that, if model forms for use by an \nowner are required, the State housing agency, if not HUD, could provide them.\n \n  Other commenters stated that, for the Moderate Rehabilitation Single Room Occupancy (SRO) program, the \nproposed rule stated that the owner is the covered housing provider, but it is unclear why the PHA is not also \nconsidered the covered housing provider since the PHA has duties in administering the program. The commenters \nstated that it is unclear which entity is responsible for adopting, administering, and facilitating the emergency \ntransfer plan, which entity is responsible for maintaining confidentiality and lease bifurcation, and which entity is \nresponsible for providing the VAWA housing rights notice and certification form. Commenters stated that \nconfidentiality must be maintained by the entity that obtains the information about the victim, and when a lease \nbifurcation occurs, the owner and the PHA must coordinate to provide a reasonable time for the tenant to establish \neligibility for the same covered program or another covered program.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Another commenter said that the State recipient should be the conduit and responsible party for implementation. \nThe commenter said that, because CoCs operate distinctly across a State and PHAs have considerable local \ncontrol, it is important that the implementation of VAWA be consistent and equally applied to survivors, regardless \nof where they may reside in a State, and the State recipient could serve in an ombudsman-type role in order to \nensure that all organizations and individuals understand their roles and obligations. The commenter said State \nrecipients should specifically be tasked with developing model notices, forms, and the emergency transfer plans in \ncollaboration with the statewide domestic violence and sexual assault coalition(s), which then can be adopted and \nimplemented by local CoCs. Commenters recommended that HUD's final rule clarify the duties of housing providers \nunder Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG) and CoC programs with regard to enacting VAWA protections.\n \n  Commenters further stated that the proposed rule did not address how the various VAWA obligations will be \ndelegated or shared among the various parties\u2014recipient, subrecipient, owner or landlord\u2014that may be \nresponsible for ensuring the delivery of VAWA obligations and protections, particularly regarding evictions and \nestablishing a reasonable time for an individual to establish eligibility or find alternative housing.\n \n  A commenter stated that proposed \u00a7&thinsp;960.102 provides the definition of \u201ccovered housing provider\u201d for \npublic housing and states that it is the PHA, but this is not appropriate or effective in those situations where another \nentity owns the public housing units and the PHA manages the units, for example, in mixed finance units, HOPE VI \nunits, or Choice Neighborhoods developments. For the public housing units that are not owned by the PHA, the \ncommenter said the responsibilities to comply with court orders, request documentation, maintain confidentiality of \ndocumentation, determine the appropriateness of lease bifurcation, and reasonable times to provide an individual to \nestablish program eligibility, must apply to both the PHA and the owner. The commenter said the owner, who has \nthe lease with the tenant, must be responsible for providing the notice and certification form, determining whether to \nevict or terminate for reasons other than those protected by VAWA, or if there is an \u201cactual or imminent threat,\u201d and \nto assist victims to remain in their unit and bear the cost of transfer, where permissible. In addition, the commenter \nsaid the PHA must adopt an emergency transfer plan with which the owner must comply, and owners should be \nrestricted from taking any steps toward evicting or terminating a tenant until the PHA notifies the owner that the \ndocumentation from a claimed victim has not been received or conflicting claims of victimization have been \nresolved.\n \n  Commenters recommended that HUD amend \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;960.102, 960.103(d), 960.203(c)(4), 966.4(e) to \nacknowledge situations where the public housing units are owned by a private owner and are managed by a PHA. \nThe commenters further recommended that HUD state generally that the entity taking the action (i.e. denying \nadmission, evicting, terminating assistance) is the entity responsible for providing the notice and form, and further \nclarify these roles in the regulation, guidance, and training.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD understands and appreciates the concerns expressed by the commenters. For several of \nthe HUD programs added by VAWA 2013, there is more than one entity administering the assistance, and it is not \nalways immediately obvious which entity is responsible for which actions mandated by VAWA. HUD sought to \nclarify which entities undertake which responsibilities but given the concerns raised by the commenters, HUD \nacknowledges further clarification is called for.\n \n  For HUD's multifamily Section 8 project-based programs in 24 CFR parts 880, 884, and 886, and for the Section \n202 and Section 811 programs in part 891, this final rule provides that the owner is the covered housing provider for \nall purposes related to this rule. Unless a PHA is the owner of a project, PHAs plays no role under these programs \nfor which they could have responsibilities pertaining to granting VAWA protections, providing notice of VAWA \nprotections, administering emergency transfer plans, or bifurcating leases. Where PHAs are owners of projects \nunder these programs, they will be the covered housing provider for all purposes related to this rule.\n \n\n\n\n  For the multifamily Section 8 programs under parts 882 and 883, however, the PHA (which would be a state \nagency for part 883) administers the programs. Therefore, it is the PHA that has primary oversight responsibilities \nunder VAWA, and it is the PHA that has the contract with the owner of the housing (not HUD) and consequently the \nPHA must set the housing policy to be followed and must ensure that the owner and all of the owners with whom \nthe PHA has a contract comply with the VAWA regulations and those VAWA policies that the PHA has been given \ndiscretion to determine. For these reasons, in these programs HUD maintains the provision in the proposed rule \nthat identifies the PHA as the covered housing provider responsible for providing the notice of occupancy rights \nunder VAWA and the certification form to tenants and applicants. In this final rule, HUD further clarifies that the PHA \nis responsible for providing the notice and form to owners to give to tenants and applicants. In addition, for parts \n882 and 883, including the Moderate Rehabilitation SRO program, HUD further clarifies in this final rule that both \nthe PHA and the owner are responsible for ensuring an emergency transfer plan is in place for the covered housing, \nbut it is the owner that has responsibility for implementing the emergency transfer plan when an emergency arises, \nsince the PHA does not have a direct relationship with the tenant. Since both PHAs and owners are covered \nhousing providers for these programs, both PHAs and owners must adhere to this rule's basic provisions regarding \ndenial or termination of assistance or occupancy rights and the construction of lease terms in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(b) \nand (c), and the limitations of VAWA protection in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(d) also apply to both PHAs and owners. \nSimilarly, the documentation and confidentiality provisions in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2007 of this rule also apply to both owners \nand PHAs.\n \n  HUD agrees with commenters that the provisions in the proposed rule that the PHA is responsible for providing the \nreasonable time to establish eligibility for assistance following bifurcation of a lease in the definition of covered \nhousing provider in parts 880, 882, 883, 884, 886, and 891, as well as in \u00a7&thinsp;982.53(e) and \u00a7&thinsp;983.3, \nwas unclear and unnecessary. HUD removes these provisions in this final rule. In each of these programs, this final \nrule clarifies that the owner is the covered housing provider that may choose to bifurcate a lease and, if the owner \nchooses to do so, must follow any applicable regulations relating to lease bifurcation.\n \n  For the regulations in part 982 (the housing choice voucher program) and in part 983 (the project-based voucher \nprogram), this final rule clarifies that it is the PHA that is the covered housing provider responsible for complying \nwith the emergency transfer plan requirements in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e). Unlike the case with HUD's multifamily \nSection 8 project-based programs, PHAs do have a direct relationship with tenants in the housing choice voucher \nand project-based voucher program, and it is appropriate for tenants to contact the PHA about emergency transfers \nunder VAWA, as they would contact the PHA about other matters related to administration of their housing \nassistance. In addition, given the relationship between the tenant and the PHA in these programs, this rule \nmaintains the provisions in the proposed rule that the PHA is responsible for providing the notice of occupancy \nrights and the certification form. As is the case for HUD's multifamily Section 8 programs under parts 882 and 883, \nfor the housing choice voucher and project-based voucher programs, both PHAs and owners are covered housing \nproviders who must adhere to this rule's basic provisions regarding denial or termination of assistance or \noccupancy rights and the construction of lease terms in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(b) and (c), and the limitations of VAWA \nprotection in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(d) also apply to both PHAs and owners. Similarly, the documentation and \nconfidentiality provisions in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2007 of this rule also apply to both owners and PHAs.\n \n  For the CoC and ESG programs, the proposed rule and this final rule lay out the responsibilities of recipients, \nsubrecipients, and housing owners in \u00a7&thinsp;576.407(g) (for ESG) and \u00a7&thinsp;578.99(j) (for CoC).\n \n  For mixed finance units and public housing developments that received public housing assistance under the \nChoice Neighborhoods and HOPE VI programs' NOFAs, the PHA is the covered housing provider because these \nunits are generally administered in the same manner as other public housing units.\n \n  For FHA multifamily programs, HUD revises the definition of covered housing provider under this rule in \n\u00a7&thinsp;200.38(b) to remove the provision that HUD will provide guidance as to who the covered housing provider \nis. HUD clarifies in this rule that the covered housing provider is generally the mortgagor for FHA multifamily \nprograms covered by VAWA. However, where an existing mortgagor/owner sells the project to a new entity \u201csubject \n\n\n\nto\u201d the mortgage, in which case the new entity would own the project but not be the mortgagor under the mortgage, \nthen the owner would be the covered housing provider.\n \n  Rule Change: In this final rule, HUD has revised \u00a7&thinsp;200.38(b) to remove the provision that HUD will provide \nguidance as to who the covered housing provider is for FHA multifamily programs administered under section 236 \nand under sections 221(d)(3) and (d)(5) of the National Housing Act.\n \n  Further, HUD has revised the regulations for HUD's multifamily Section 8 project-based programs in 24 CFR parts \n880, 884, and 886 to specify that the owner is the covered housing provider. HUD has also revised the regulations \nfor the Section 202 and Section 811 programs in part 891 to clarify that the owner is the covered housing provider.\n \n  HUD has revised the definition of covered housing provider in 24 CFR part 883, as well as the definition of \ncovered housing provider in \u00a7&thinsp;882.102 for Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Programs, other than the \nSingle Room Occupancy Program for Homeless Individuals, to clarify that the PHA is the covered housing provider \nresponsible for providing the notice of occupancy rights and certification form under VAWA, and that the PHA may \nprovide this notice and form to owners, and charge an owner with distribution to tenants. HUD also revises the \nregulations in these parts to eliminate the provision that the PHA is the covered housing provider responsible for \nproviding the reasonable time to establish eligibility for assistance following bifurcation of a lease, and to clarify that \nthe PHA and owner are both responsible for ensuring that an emergency transfer plan is in place, and it is the \nowner that is responsible for implementing the emergency transfer plan when an emergency occurs. HUD retains \nthe provision in \u00a7&thinsp;882.802 that the owner is the covered housing provider for the Section 8 Moderate \nRehabilitation Single Room Occupancy program for Homeless Individuals.\n \n  In addition, HUD has revised regulations for the Housing Choice Voucher program, at \u00a7&thinsp;982.53(e) and the \nproject-based voucher program, at \u00a7&thinsp;983.3, to remove the provision that the PHA is the covered housing \nprovider responsible for providing the reasonable time to establish eligibility for assistance following bifurcation of a \nlease. HUD also revises the regulations in these parts to clarify that the PHA is responsible for complying with this \nrule's provisions on emergency transfer plans.\n \n  Comment: Clarify responsibility for implementing VAWA requirements when there are multiple housing providers. \nSimilar to the above comments, commenter asked who the covered entity is if a family uses voucher assistance in \notherwise covered rental housing where another entity also may be a covered housing provider. The commenter \nasked which entity is responsible for providing VAWA protections and implementing VAWA requirements in \ncircumstances such as these. The commenter stated that in essence, it was asking whether each covered housing \nprovider would have to provide notices of occupancy rights and obtain certifications. The commenter stated that the \nproviders may implement different policies concerning, for example, the time a tenant will be given to establish \nprogram eligibility, and therefore further clarity in this area is necessary.\n \n  Another commenter stated that, if PHAs are collaborating with ESG and CoC program grantees, PHAs would still \nbe subject to the lease requirements currently imposed by HUD with respect to the public housing and Section 8 \nprograms, and if HUD seeks to impose different lease requirements on these programs when overlaid with ESG \nand CoC programs, HUD will need to provide additional guidance to the PHAs.\n \n\n  HUD Response: The program-specific regulations in this rule explain which housing provider has responsibility for \nwhich VAWA requirements when there are multiple housing providers within a single program. More importantly, \nhowever, the notice of occupancy rights to be given to each applicant and tenant identify the covered housing \nprovider that will interact with the tenant.\n \n  Where housing is covered under multiple HUD programs, such as under the HOME and Section 8 Project-Based \nprograms, the responsible housing provider under each program will provide the required notice of occupancy rights \nand certification form, and tenants may request emergency transfers or lease bifurcations under either program. \n\n\n\nWhere there is a conflict between different program regulations, \u00a7&thinsp;5.2001(b)(2) of HUD's VAWA regulation \napplies. As discussed earlier in this preamble, \u00a7&thinsp;5.2001(b)(2) states that, where assistance is provided \nunder more than one covered housing program and the VAWA protections or remedies under those programs \nconflict, the individual seeking the VAWA protections or remedies may choose to use the protections or remedies \nunder any or all of those programs, as long as the protections or remedies would be feasible and permissible under \neach of the program statutes.\n <h5>\n\n  d. Domestic Violence</h5>\n \n\n  Comment: Do not include a limiting definition of \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d in the definition of \u201cdomestic violence\u201d and \nprovide a more expansive definition. Commenters recommended that HUD eliminate the cross-reference to 18 \nU.S.C. 16 in the proposed rule, as the term \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d in 18 U.S.C. 16, is too limiting for VAWA \nprotections. Commenters stated that, recently, the U.S. Supreme Court found in U.S. v. Castleman, 134 S. Ct. 1405 \n(2014), that \u201cdomestic `violence' is not merely a type of violence; it is a term of art encompassing acts that one \nmight not characterize as `violent' in a nondomestic context.\u201d The commenters state that, in Castleman, the \nSupreme Court recognized that under an appropriate definition of \u201cdomestic violence,\u201d a seemingly \u201cminor\u201d act, in \ncombination with other acts, whether seriously violent or merely harassing, could result in the complete victimization \nof an intimate partner, and that appropriate remedies should be available as a result. Some commenters urged \nHUD to follow the Supreme Court's discussion in Castleman and build upon that definition to define \u201cdomestic \nviolence\u201d in these regulations as a pattern of behavior involving the use or attempted use of physical, sexual, \nverbal, emotional, economic, or other abusive behavior by a person to harm, threaten, intimidate, harass, coerce, \ncontrol, isolate, restrain, or monitor a current or former intimate partner.\n \n\n  A commenter stated that the definition of \u201cdomestic violence\u201d should not be tied to 18 U.S.C. 16 because that \ndefinition excludes a great deal of domestic violence crimes under State and tribal laws, as well as common law \ndefinitions of \u201cbattery.\u201d The commenter stated that with the proposed rule's definition, there will be a great deal of \nuncertainty as to whether a particular conviction actually constitutes a crime under 18 U.S.C. 16.\n \n\n  Another commenter said that the matter of domestic violence has specific legal implications in most jurisdictions. \nThe commenter stated that the proposed rule includes felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence in the definition, \nwhich implies formal charges filed by a prosecutor. The commenter said that in the locality in which the commenter \nresides, all cases initially thought to meet the test for domestic violence are further reviewed by prosecutors and \nare often re-classified to different charges.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD agrees that the definition of \u201cdomestic violence\u201d should not include a cross-reference to \nthe definition of \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d in 18 U.S.C. 16. On further consideration, HUD agrees that the cross-\nreference has the consequence of making HUD's definition of \u201cdomestic violence\u201d too limiting and could well \nexclude, as commenters pointed out, domestic violence crimes under tribal, State, or local laws. The term \u201ccrimes \nof violence\u201d is not new to VAWA 2013. The term has been in the definition of \u201cdomestic violence\u201d since VAWA \nwas first enacted in 1994, and was in HUD's regulations implementing VAWA 2005, and has not previously referred \nto 18 U.S.C. 16. Therefore, HUD withdraws its proposal to define crimes of violence in accordance with 18 U.S.C. \n16, and implements the definition of domestic violence as it appears in VAWA 2013.\n \n\n  Rule Change: HUD revises the definition of domestic violence to remove the reference to 18 U.S.C. 16.\n \n\n\n\n  Comment: The term intimate partner is too broad as defined in HUD regulations. Commenters stated that in the \nrevised definition of \u201cdomestic violence,\u201d HUD included \u201cintimate partner\u201d as defined in title 18 of U.S.C. \nCommenters said that definition appears to bestow this status on any person who has ever cohabited or been in a \nromantic or intimate relationship in perpetuity, and asked HUD to indicate how long a person may have this status.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD's proposed definition of \u201cdomestic violence\u201d tracks the statutory definition from VAWA, \nwhich, as amended by VAWA 2013, defines \u201cdomestic violence\u201d as including the following: Felony or misdemeanor \ncrimes of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim, by a person with \nwhom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim \nas a spouse or intimate partner, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family \nviolence laws of the jurisdiction receiving grant monies, or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who \nis protected from that person's acts under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction. VAWA does not \nlimit domestic violence to those acts committed by an individual who is a current spouse or intimate partner of the \nvictim, but rather expressly provides domestic violence is a crime of violence committed by a current or former \nspouse or intimate partner. As the statute does not place a time restriction on what it means to be a former spouse \nor intimate partner, HUD declines to do so. However, HUD is removing the proposed cross-reference to 18 U.S.C. \n2266 in defining \u201cintimate partner.\u201d The definition of \u201cspouse or intimate partner\u201d in 18 U.S.C. 2266(7) provides that \nthis person includes: (i) A spouse or former spouse of the abuser, a person who shares a child in common with the \nabuser, and a person who cohabits or has cohabited as a spouse with the abuser; or (ii) a person who is or has \nbeen in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the abuser, as determined by the length of the \nrelationship, the type of relationship, and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the \nrelationship.\n \n\n  On further consideration, HUD determined that a cross-reference to 18 U.S.C. 2266(7) may be confusing, as the \nterm \u201cdomestic violence\u201d includes felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence committed by a current or former \nspouse or intimate partner of the victim, or others, and 18 U.S.C. 2266(7) defines \u201cintimate partner\u201d as the victim \nand not the abuser. As a result, the cross reference reads as if domestic violence is a crime of violence committed \nby the victim, rather than the perpetrator.\n \n\n  Rule Change: HUD revises its definition of \u201cdomestic violence\u201d to remove the cross-reference to 18 U.S.C. 2266. \nIn its place, HUD clarifies that the term \u201cspouse or intimate partner of the victim\u201d includes a person who is or has \nbeen in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim, as determined by the length of the \nrelationship, the type of the relationship, and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the \nrelationship.\n <h5>\n  e. Lawful Occupant and Tenant</h5>\n \n  Comment: Define \u201clawful occupant\u201d and \u201ctenant\u201d and clarify how each is affected by the rule. Commenters asked \nfor HUD to include in its final rule definitions of \u201clawful occupant\u201d and \u201ctenant.\u201d The commenters said proposed 24 \nCFR 5.2005(b) discusses termination of the \u201ctenant\u201d or \u201caffiliated individual\u201d and, unlike proposed \u00a7&thinsp;5.2003 \nthat addresses definitions and \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009 that addresses bifurcation of leases, there is no mention of \u201clawful \noccupants.\u201d The commenters said the omission of defining \u201clawful occupant\u201d and \u201ctenant\u201d may cause confusion as \nto lawful occupants' rights if crimes covered by VAWA occur. The commenters said proposed \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(d)(2) \nsimilarly omits reference to lawful occupant, and \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005 (d)(3) may create confusion because this section \npermits a covered housing provider to \u201cterminate assistance to or evict a tenant\u201d if that tenant or lawful occupant \npresents an actual and imminent threat to others.\n \n\n\n\n  HUD Response: The usage of the terms \u201clawful occupant\u201d and \u201ctenant\u201d in the proposed rule reflect their usage in \nVAWA 2013. VAWA 2013 does not define these terms, and HUD declines to define them in this final rule. \nGenerally, while the term \u201clawful occupant\u201d as defined by state law would be applicable in determining whether or \nnot someone would be an affiliated individual, it would not be for lease bifurcations. The term \u201clawful occupant\u201d for \nlease bifurcations would be whether or not the person is a lawful occupant (beneficiary or tenant, or recognized \nmember of the household) per the program regulations of the specific HUD program. Therefore, while someone \nmay be a \u201clawful occupant\u201d under state law, if they are not on the lease or receiving assistance under the HUD \nprogram regulations they are not eligible for lease bifurcation.\n <h5>\n  f. Stalking</h5>\n \n  Comment: Provide a clearer definition of stalking. Commenters asked that there be a more detailed definition of \n\u201cstalking.\u201d The commenters questioned whether the definition applies to all stalking situations, or only when the \nindividual is being stalked by someone with whom the individual was in a `domestic relationship'?\n \n\n  HUD Response: The definition of \u201cstalking\u201d in this rule is the same definition that is in title I of VAWA. It applies to \nall situations where an individual, the perpetrator, engages in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that \nwould cause a reasonable person to fear for their own safety or the safety of others, or suffer substantial emotional \ndistress. Stalking is not limited to situations where the perpetrator is someone with whom the victim was in any \nspecific type of relationship.\n <h5>\n  g. Victim</h5>\n \n  Comment: The definition of \u201cvictim\u201d needs further clarity. Commenters said the definition of \u201cvictim\u201d needs further \nclarification. The commenters said there is some confusion within the industry as to the definition of a \u201cvictim\u201d\u2014\nwhether this term is defined as someone who is abused by another individual living at the property, or is abused on \nthe property grounds, and must be known and named by the victim, or, that a tenant can be a victim regardless of \nwhether the abuse was perpetrated by a tenant living on the property, or it was on the property grounds, and that \nthe tenant is not required to know or name the abuser.\n \n\n  HUD Response: A tenant or an applicant may be a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, \nor stalking regardless of whether the act was perpetrated by a tenant living on the property, or whether the act \noccurred on the property grounds, or, in cases of sexual assault or stalking, whether the tenant knows the \nperpetrator. The rule's definitions of \u201cdomestic violence,\u201d \u201cdating violence,\u201d \u201csexual assault,\u201d and \u201cstalking\u201d should \nnot be read to include any additional restrictions on these acts are, or who qualifies as a victim of such acts beyond \nwhat is explicitly stated in the definitions.\n <h5>\n  3. Emergency Transfers</h5>\n <h5>\n  a. Emergency Transfer Documentation Requirements</h5>\n \n  Comment: Clearly specify emergency transfer documentation requirements, specifically documentation \nrequirements. There were many comments on documentation requirements associated with emergency transfer \nplans, and the comments raised the following issues.\n \n  The VAWA statute does not apply documentation requirements to emergency transfers. Commenters stated that \nVAWA's documentation requirements do not apply to the emergency transfer provisions and therefore HUD should \nnot apply any documentation requirements to emergency transfers.\n \n\n\n\n  Need further rulemaking to impose additional documentation requirements for emergency transfer plans. \nCommenters said that if HUD seeks to impose documentation requirements for emergency transfer requests \nbeyond those described in the proposed rule, HUD must do so through additional notice and comment rulemaking. \nOther commenters said documentation requirements for emergency transfers should be the same as the rule's \nother documentation requirements and not exceed those requirements. Commenters said requiring additional \ndocumentation requirements will expose victims and housing providers to inconsistency and confusion.\n \n\n  Prohibit housing providers from requiring documentation for emergency transfers beyond requirements \nestablished by HUD. Other commenters said HUD must establish the documentation requirements for transfers \nacross all HUD-covered housing programs and not permit covered housing providers to establish documentation \nrequirements separate from those mandated in HUD's rule. Commenters said HUD must continue to prohibit \ncovered housing programs from requiring a victim to submit third-party proof, as this documentation cannot always \nbe easily secured, and eligibility should be determined by whether a person in the victim's shoes would reasonably \nbelieve he or she is threatened with imminent harm from further violence.\n \n\n  Do not assume victims requesting emergency transfers were previously determined to be VAWA victims. Another \ncommenter said the preamble to the proposed rule unfairly assumed that persons seeking emergency transfers \nhave already been determined to be victims covered by VAWA's protections. The commenter said that in many \ncases, the first indication that a tenant is a victim of violence may be the request for an emergency transfer.\n \n\n  Requiring documentation in order to determine if an emergency transfer is appropriate. Some commenters said \nthat HUD should require documentation before a landlord makes a decision about emergency transfers. \nCommenters said documentation should be required prior to transfer to ensure the appropriate use of resources \nand to ensure that tenants qualify, considering that transfers are costly and families must wait while transfers are \nprocessed for others. Other commenters said it is unclear what would happen after a transfer if the tenant did not \nprovide sufficient documentation of the need for an emergency transfer. Another commenter expressed its support \nfor requiring a tenant seeking a transfer to provide some form of documentation, provided the documentation is not \nso complex and burdensome as to deter a pro-se victim from seeking assistance. A commenter stated that, \nbecause victims have the option of signing a self-certification form, which can be done in minutes, requiring \ndocumentation prior to transfer should not cause any delay in obtaining an emergency transfer. A commenter said \nthat third-party documentation prior to an emergency transfer is necessary unless the situation of violence is \nobservable by a responsible entity. Commenter recommended that the specific type of third-party documentation \nrequired for an emergency transfer should be established through local and regional policy. Commenter also said \nthat, for homeless assistance programs, documentation is vital when transferring a tenant because victims may \nneed to be relocated to another safe place that may require documentation for when this person first became \nhomeless in order to qualify.\n \n\n  A delay in emergency transfer until certain documentation is received jeopardizes the safety of the victim. \nCommenters said victims needing the protections of VAWA should not be required to submit documentation before \na transfer. A commenter stated that the emergency transfer plan already requires the tenant to submit a written \nrequest for a transfer, and documentation beyond this requirement may be difficult to access and is vulnerable to \nbeing obtained or destroyed by the perpetrator. Commenters said that gathering the requested documentation, \nparticularly when violence is imminent, can unduly delay the transfer process and further endanger the victim.\n \n  Allow post-transfer documentation. Other commenters asked that a tenant requesting a transfer be permitted to \nsubmit documentation at least 14 days after the transfer has been completed, so that the provider's focus is on \nexpeditiously completing the transfer.\n \n\n\n\n  Require documentation beyond self-certification. Commenters stated that victims should provide documentation \nother than self-certification when seeking an emergency transfer. Commenters stated that documentation could \ninclude police reports, court orders, incident reports, notarized witness statements, verification from a domestic \nviolence shelter, 911 calls, or a statement from a service provider. Some commenters stated that official \ngovernment documentation should be required, while others said the documentation could be a written or oral \nstatement from a witness.\n \n\n  A commenter stated that third-party documentation may help to eliminate transfer of the same situation to a new \nlocation, and that this documentation is necessary for the housing provider to document the case in detail. The \ncommenters said that documentation other than self-certification is necessary to verify the need for an emergency \ntransfer, as the form's provisions regarding penalties for fraud would be difficult to enforce, and some victims may \nattempt to use an incident of domestic violence to obtain a superior housing unit or break their current lease, even \nif this is unrelated to a VAWA incident. A commenter pointed to a State law allowing a tenant who is the victim of \ndomestic violence to legally break a lease, but only with some type of third-party documentation. Commenters said \nrequiring additional documentation is logical because housing providers will take a monetary and temporal loss for \ntransfers. Other commenters stated that statements from legal, medical, psychological or social service providers \nstating their belief that a transfer will have a strong probability of reducing a recurrence of the violence should be \nrequired for emergency transfers. Another commenter stated that landlords should request a detailed statement \nfrom the victim, and then interview the victims after the transfer and obtain a written statement from regarding \nwhether the violence stopped or the transfer benefited the resident.\n \n  Allow the housing provider to determine when and what type of documentation may be needed for emergency \ntransfers. Commenters said that HUD should allow housing providers to determine whether documentation is \nnecessary for emergency transfers and what documentation may be necessary. A commenter stated that many \nPHAs have very high occupancy rates and relocation should be reserved for individuals with the highest level of \nneed. A commenter said that allowing somebody to submit a self-certifying form with no supporting documentation \ncould leave PHAs susceptible to fraud. The commenter said documentation serves to protect both the housing \nprovider and the program participants by ensuring that there are standards that guide these decisions, and HUD \nshould allow housing providers to determine what supporting information would be sufficient. The commenter said \nthat rather than HUD establishing documentation standards for emergency transfers that HUD allow the housing \nproviders to use their discretion to make determinations on a case-by-case basis because the circumstances that \ncan lead a tenant to request an emergency transfer under VAWA are highly personal and individual.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates all of the comments received on whether and how to document emergency \ntransfer requests. HUD has considered all of these comments and has included in this final rule specific provisions \non emergency transfer documentation. HUD understands that housing providers may incur costs when transferring \ntenants and that other families may need available units. Therefore, for the reasons further described below, this \nfinal rule allows housing providers, at their discretion, to require that tenants requesting transfers submit a written \nrequest before a transfer occurs certifying that they meet the criteria for an emergency transfer under this rule. To \nminimize burden, HUD has created a model emergency transfer request. Housing providers may accept third-party \ndocumentation if that documentation is offered by tenants, but housing providers will not be allowed to require any \nthird-party documentation in order to determine whether a tenant seeking an emergency transfer is eligible for an \nemergency transfer.\n \n\n  HUD understands that tenants seeking emergency transfers may not have already submitted to their housing \nprovider documentation of any occurrence of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, and \nHUD did not intend to indicate that there is an assumption that a tenant seeking an emergency transfer has already \nbeen previously determined to be a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. HUD \nclarifies in this final rule that housing providers may require tenants seeking emergency transfers to document an \n\n\n\noccurrence of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, in addition to documenting eligibility \nfor an emergency transfer, consistent with the HUD requirement that individuals certify eligibility in order to establish \nthat the tenant is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, if the individual has not \nalready provided documentation of that occurrence. HUD notes as part of certifying eligibility for VAWA protections \nan individual may provide self-certification in lieu of any other documentation to document an occurrence of a \nVAWA-protected incident. Because self-certification can be submitted fairly quickly, submission of a self-certification \nshould not delay any requests for an emergency transfer.\n \n\n  In addition to documentation\u2014which could be self-certification\u2014of the occurrence of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, or stalking, the final rule allows housing providers to require that tenants seeking \nemergency transfers provide documentation\u2014which could be a written request\u2014that they meet the requirements \nfor a transfer. HUD is allowing housing providers to request this additional documentation because an individual \nmay be a victim of violence covered by VAWA, and yet not meet the requirements for an emergency transfer that \nare specified in VAWA 2013. Those requirements are that the individual expressly request the transfer and either \nreasonably believe there is a threat of imminent harm from further violence if the tenant remains in the same \ndwelling unit that the tenant is currently occupying or, in the case of a tenant who is a victim of sexual assault, the \ntenant also qualifies for a transfer if the assault occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period \npreceding the date of request for the transfer.\n \n  HUD appreciates commenters' concerns that third-party proof cannot always be easily obtained, that it may not be \navailable to some tenants who qualify for emergency transfers, and the requirement to obtain third-party \ndocumentation could delay transfers, resulting in harm to tenants. It is for these reasons that the final rule stipulates \nthat housing providers may not require third-party documentation for an emergency transfer.\n \n  As noted above, housing providers may, however, require that tenants submit a written request for an emergency \ntransfer where they certify their need for a transfer. This is a change from the proposed rule. Although the proposed \nmodel emergency transfer plan stated that tenants should submit a written request for a transfer, the proposed rule \ndid provide that housing providers may require this request. HUD disagrees with commenter's interpretation of \nVAWA 2013 that because the statute does not discuss documentation requirements for emergency transfers, HUD \nmay not allow housing providers to require that tenants submit any documentation whatsoever.\n \n\n  HUD also does not agree with some of the arguments that commenters presented in favor of requiring third-party \ndocumentation for an emergency transfer. HUD does not believe that a failure to require third-party documentation \nwould result in negating the benefits of a transfer, and leave the tenant in an endangered situation. Rather, strict \nconfidentiality measures to prevent a perpetrator from learning the new location of the transferred tenant would help \nto reduce the possibility of future violence.\n \n  HUD understands that some housing providers expressed concern that there may be tenants who request an \nemergency transfer for the purpose of obtaining a superior housing unit or to break their current lease. This \nsituation may occur but, for the following reasons, HUD does not agree that this justifies a third-party documentation \nrequirement that could endanger the lives of those tenants who are victims of VAWA crimes and for whom safety \nand security is a real threat.\n \n\n  First, third-party documentation of a VAWA-protected incident would not necessarily help a housing provider \ndetermine whether a victim reasonably believes that the victim is in imminent harm from further violence without a \ntransfer. Second, the housing provider may request that the tenant sign a written request for the transfer that states \nthat the information in the request is accurate, and that submission of false information could jeopardize program \neligibility and be the basis for denial of admission, termination of assistance, or eviction. HUD further disagrees with \ncommenters who suggested that landlords should request a detailed statement from, and interview, victims. There \n\n\n\nare housing providers who may have experience working with victims of domestic violence, dating violence, \nsexual assault, or stalking, but there are also housing providers who do not. Regardless, under this rule, housing \nproviders will not judge the merits of the claims of victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or \nstalking. HUD understands that the documentation of homelessness may be important when transferring a tenant, \nbut this does not require third-party documentation of the need for a transfer due to domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, or stalking.\n \n\n  HUD agrees with those commenters who said that providers should be permitted to use their discretion to \ndetermine whether documentation is needed, and housing providers will not be required to request documentation \nfrom those seeking an emergency transfer due to an incident of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault, or stalking, just as housing providers are not required to request documentation of the VAWA-related \nincidence. However, as previously discussed, under this final rule, housing providers will not be allowed to require \nthat tenants requesting an emergency transfer under VAWA submit third-party documentation to qualify for an \nemergency transfer. HUD understands that many PHAs have high occupancy rates, but notes that transfers are \nonly required where there is a safe and available unit to transfer the tenant to, and, where there is a transfer, the \nunit from which the tenant is transferring will become available. Further, allowing housing providers to decide for \nthemselves what documentation is sufficient for an emergency transfer could leave them more legally vulnerable \nthan they would be under this rule, which clearly requires covered housing providers to accept self-certification, if \nthey require documentation.\n \n\n  Rule Change: This final rule revises \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e) to specify that housing providers may, at their discretion, \nrequire tenants seeking emergency transfers to submit written requests expressly requesting the emergency \ntransfer, in which the tenants must certify that they meet the requirements for an emergency transfer. This written \nrequest is different from any self-certification or documentation that an individual may have given, or the housing \nprovider may ask for, to document the occurrence of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or \nstalking in accordance with \u00a7&thinsp;5.2007. HUD has developed a model emergency transfer request that housing \nproviders may give to tenants who ask for an emergency transfer.\n \n\n  This final rule also revises \u00a7&thinsp;5.2007(a)(1) to remove the provision that the documentation requirements in \nthe section are not applicable to a request made by the tenant for an emergency transfer. This provision was \nremoved because housing providers may require tenants seeking emergency transfers to document an occurrence \nof domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, if they have not done so already, in addition to \ndocumenting eligibility for an emergency transfer.\n \n\n  Comment: Housing providers that create a preference for VAWA transfers should be permitted to establish their \nown criteria for verification for a transfer. Commenters said that if a PHA establishes a preference for housing \nVAWA victims, the PHA should be permitted to establish criteria for the verification of domestic violence for \npurposes of honoring the preference. A commenter said many PHAs may already give a priority to victims of \ndomestic violence who need to relocate from public housing through assistance from the HCV program and for \nthose PHAs the documentation requirements to implement the transfer are already set forth in their Section 8 \nAdministrative Plan. Commenters suggested that PHAs be allowed to continue to utilize the verification \nrequirements as set forth within their Section 8 Administrative Plans&thinsp; (8)  for preferences for victims of \ndomestic violence necessitating said transfer.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD understands the concerns raised by the commenters in not altering requirements that are \nalready in place for PHAs that give preference in housing to victims of domestic violence. However, providing \npreferences in housing to certain groups, and PHAs have authority to establish such preferences, is not the same \nas complying with the emergency transfer provisions of VAWA 2013. Providing preferences to certain groups may \n\n\n\nhelp meet emergency housing needs of these groups but do not constitute a need for an emergency transfer as is \ncontemplated by VAWA 2013.\n \n\n  As previously discussed, under this final rule, covered housing providers may require in their emergency transfer \nplans that victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking submit a written request to their \nhousing provider, where the tenants certify that they meet the requirements for an emergency transfer, in addition to \nany self-certification or other documentation of an occurrence of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault or stalking. This means that if the tenant provides these self-certifications, and the covered housing provider \nhas another safe and available unit for which the victim qualifies, the housing provider must allow the tenant to \ntransfer. If the covered housing provider has a VAWA emergency transfer waiting list, the only documentation that a \nhousing provider could require the tenant to submit in order to be placed on the waiting list is a written emergency \ntransfer request, where the tenant certifies to meeting the requirements for an emergency transfer under VAWA, in \naddition to any self-certification or other documentation of an occurrence of domestic violence, dating violence, \nsexual assault or stalking, as described in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e)(6).\n \n  Comment: Owners and agents should maintain documentation of an emergency transfer. Commenters said \nowners and agents should have to maintain documentation of emergency transfers to provide records for the \ncovered housing provider as to why a move was necessary.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD agrees that covered housing providers should maintain documentation of emergency \ntransfer requests and the outcomes of such requests, and HUD believes that, in order to ensure compliance with \nthe emergency transfer provisions of this rule, covered housing providers should have to report this information to \nHUD in the aggregate. Accordingly, in this final rule, HUD adds to the regulations governing emergency transfer \nplans that covered housing providers must keep a record of all emergency transfers requested, and the outcomes \nof such requests, and retain these records for a period of three years, or for the period of time specified in program \nregulations, and report them to HUD annually. HUD understands that this may entail additional costs for covered \nhousing providers, and HUD will solicit comment on this provision through separate notice before covered housing \nproviders must comply with this provision.\n \n\n  Rule Change: This final rule revises 24 CFR 5.2005 to state that the covered housing provider must keep a record \nof all emergency transfers requested under its emergency transfer plan, and the outcomes of such requests, and \nretain these records for a period of three years, or for a period of time as specified in program regulations. HUD's \nproposed changes aligns to the record retention periods of each covered programs to the extent possible. The rule \nalso provides that requests and outcomes of such requests must be reported to HUD annually. Further, this rule \nrevises the following program regulations to include documentation and reporting of VAWA emergency transfer \nrequests and outcomes: 24 CFR 91.520, which details performance report requirements for HOME participating \njurisdictions and jurisdictions receiving funding under the HOPWA, ESG, and HTF programs; HOME program \nregulations at 24 CFR 92.508 (Recordkeeping); HTF program regulations at 24 CFR 93.407 (Recordkeeping); \nHOPWA regulations at 24 CFR 574.520 (Performance reports) and 24 CFR 574.530 (Recordkeeping); ESG \nregulations at 24 CFR 576.500 (Recordkeeping and reporting requirements); CoC regulations at 24 CFR 578.103 \n(Recordkeeping requirements); and Multifamily program regulations at 24 CFR 882.407 (Other Federal \nrequirements) and \u00a7&thinsp;882.804 (Other Federal requirements). The rule also includes in newly added \nregulations for Multifamily programs in 24 CFR 880.613, 884.226, 886.139, 886.339, and 891.190 (Emergency \ntransfer for victims of domestic violence, dating violence sexual assault, and stalking) reporting requirements for \nemergency transfers requested under VAWA. All public housing agencies will be required to comply with the \ngeneral reporting and recordkeeping requirements in 24 CFR 5.2005(e).\n \n\n\n\n  Comment: Updated documentation of need for emergency transfer may be necessary. Commenters stated that \nupdated documentation for an emergency transfer may be necessary in cases where a period of time has passed \nbetween the date a family submitted domestic violence verification and the date they ask for an emergency \ntransfer. Commenters provided an example in which a family was admitted to a program based on a Federal \npreference for domestic violence in 1995, and in 2015 the family requests an emergency transfer under VAWA. \nThe commenters said that it would be reasonable for the housing provider to request updated documentation in \nsuch a case.\n \n\n  HUD Response: In order to qualify for an emergency transfer under VAWA 2013, a tenant who is a victim of \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking must reasonably believe there is a threat of \nimminent harm from further violence. It does not matter when an initial act occurred if the current belief of a threat \nof imminent harm is reasonable, or, in cases of sexual assault, the assault occurred on the premises during the 90-\ncalendar-day period preceding the transfer request. Housing providers may require that tenants who request \nemergency transfers under VAWA submit a written transfer request where the tenant certifies that he or she \nbelieves there is a threat of imminent harm from further violence, or that he or she was a victim of a sexual assault \nthat occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the transfer request.\n <h5>\n  b. Emergency Transfer Costs</h5>\n \n  Comment: Transfers have costs. Commenters stated that emergency transfers could be costly and time-\nconsuming for housing providers and could include costs related to utilities, packing and moving, damage repairs, \npainting, cleaning, inspections, lease execution and explanation and assuring housing eligibility. A commenter \nstated that ordinary turnover costs for the landlord, with no renovation, may include new carpet, new paint, cleaning \nfees, damage remediation, time involved by a project's service team, and time involved by a leasing team. The \ncommenter further stated that rehabilitating a unit is costly, but that in all cases paperwork is minimal\u2014a new lease \nand a new certification. The commenter stated that, overall, the work and cost to transfer a resident is minimal, \nthough it is not recoverable, and asked if HUD could provide some reimbursement when an emergency transfer \narises.\n \n  Other commenters said costs can be substantial. A commenter said costs also include criminal background and \ndrug tests. Another commenter said it currently employs an entire team dedicated to processing emergency \ntransfers for public housing tenants and HCV participants and, in addition to these personnel costs, the commenter \nsaid that it spends approximately $14,000 on preparing each public housing unit for a new occupant, and $200 in \nadministrative costs for each HCV emergency transfer. Commenter said that if the perpetrator is not removed from \nthe apartment before transferring the victim, subsidizing the perpetrator in one apartment and the victim in a second \napartment could occur, thereby greatly increasing the transfer costs.\n \n  A commenter said that an informal poll of its PHA members finds that unit transfers cost between $500 and $5500, \ndepending on the amount of work that needs to be undertaken upon turnover. The commenter explained that an \nestimate of $3000-$4000 would include painting, carpet or tile replacement, cleaning costs, lock changes, possible \nappliance replacement or repair, and shade replacement, and an additional $500 should be added for each \nadditional bedroom.\n \n  Another commenter estimated that relocation of a public housing tenant through HCV assistance costs between 5 \nand 17 staff hours and $50 to $100 in subcontractor fees for inspections. The commenter said that, at best, \nrelocation through the HCV program involves staff time spent issuing a voucher, reviewing the \u201cRequest for \nTenancy Approval,\u201d inspection and rent reasonableness determination of a new unit, preparation of a new lease \nand housing assistance payments contract (HAP), and recertification of the family. The commenter added that costs \nmay increase for a PHA due to additional inspections, since an initially chosen unit may not be affordable or \nappropriate, and the processing of multiple Requests for Tenancy Approval forms. The commenter further stated \n\n\n\nthat, if the perpetrator is a member of the assisted household, the PHA may also be undergoing the process of \nterminating the perpetrator's individual assistance, which could result in hearing costs and potential legal fees.\n \n  A commenter said public housing costs include moving costs and damage caused by the tenant beyond normal \nwear and tear, an average turnaround time of 8 days during which time the unit is not occupied while it is being \nmade ready for the next family, and an average cost in parts and labor of $215 plus an additional $200 for cleaning. \nFor the HCV program, the commenter said moving costs and damage caused by the tenant and any additional \ncosts to make the unit ready for the next occupant is born by the landlord. The commenter said that HCV staff \nspend about 8 hours processing moves, and the total cost of their time and the resources expended is about $200.\n \n  Another commenter said that if there are damages beyond normal wear and tear, and if the participant fails to pay \nthose costs, landlords must not only incur these costs but face the costs of pursuing collection. This commenter \nsaid lost rent on each unit while it is vacant could amount to 60 or 90 days, which could result in the loss of \nOperating Fund eligibility in the subsequent year for public housing, and in the voucher program, costs include the \nloss of renewal funding in subsequent years for lost unit months leased (UMLs) and lost fees.\n \n  A commenter said that in the past 5 years it has spent over $339,000 on 118 emergency transfers for temporary \nhotel accommodations as well as moving expenses. Commenter said it has been experiencing a steady annual \nincrease in the number of emergency transfer requests in general and in VAWA specifically.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates the information on costs provided by the commenters. HUD understands that \nhousing providers face administrative and unit turnover costs for transfers, and where there is an increase in \ntransfers, regardless of the reason, the costs to housing providers may rise. HUD recognizes that VAWA's provision \nfor emergency transfers may result in an increase in transfer costs. HUD notes, however, that transfers may not be \na unique occurrence for PHAs and owners and management agents, but a part of administering public and assisted \nhousing. Further, PHAs can utilize the limited vacancy provision of 24 CFR 990.150 that allows operating subsidy to \nbe paid for a limited number of vacant units under an annual contributions contract (ACC).\n \n  Comment: Housing providers should not be required to pay for transfers. Commenters stated that the rule should \nmake clear that housing providers are not required to pay for transfers and either HUD or tenants should be \nrequired to pay for, or provide reimbursement for, costs. A commenter said housing providers should not be \nresponsible for costs since this is not a reasonable accommodation covered under section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct of 1973 (Section 504). Another commenter said that a PHA would bear the cost of all paperwork and issuing \nvouchers and inspecting units, but other costs associated with moving into a new unit, such as application fees to \nowners, deposits, and moving costs, should not be allowed as they are above the statutory requirements of the \nHCV program. Another commenter said that covering expenses such as utility deposits and moving costs would be \ndevastating to small PHAs.\n \n\n  A commenter said that if the tenant and management agree that the tenant cannot afford transfer costs, services \nrepresentatives can seek assistance from local resources, or, management could put forth the costs and allow the \ntenant to repay them under a payment plan. A commenter said departing residents paying costs under a repayment \nplan is consistent with HUD's policy with respect to other resident-initiated transfers as set forth in the Public \nHousing Occupancy Guidebook.  (9)  Another commenter said it is not aware of a situation where the housing \nprovider would pay transfer costs, but suggested it would be beneficial to tenants to be given an extended period of \ntime to pay off fees. A commenter suggested that, in the case of emergency transfers, any damage to the unit or \nunpaid rent should still be the responsibility of the departing resident, but, any financial penalties for breaking a \nlease could be waived by the owner based upon a confirmed instance of domestic violence, stalking or sexual \nassault.\n \n\n\n\n  Commenters suggested that HUD establish a special fee to ensure that PHAs are able to withstand the financial \nimplications of transfers under VAWA. Others commenters said moving costs should be considered to be \npermissible program expenses. Commenters said HUD should reimburse covered housing providers for costs \nassociated with these transfers and such requirement should be provided for in the rule and could be established in \na PIH notice.\n \n\n  HUD Response: For HUD programs that have existing guidance related to paying costs of transfers, housing \nproviders should follow that guidance and may follow any existing transfer policies and procedures they have, \nincluding those for repayment plans. Under this final rule, housing providers will not be required to bear moving \ncosts that tenants and their household members generally pay, including application fees and deposits, in addition \nto costs to physically move households and their belongings.\n \n\n  In response to commenters who stated housing providers should not be responsible for costs since this is not a \nreasonable accommodation covered under Section 504, the issue of whether housing providers must pay for \nemergency transfers is a separate issue from reasonable accommodation requests under Section 504. Section 504 \npertains to providing and paying for structural modifications that may be necessary as a reasonable accommodation \nfor individuals with disabilities.\n \n  Comment: A specific process is needed for ESG or CoC funds to be used pay for damages caused by early lease \ntermination. Commenters expressed support that the rule allows the use of ESG and CoC funds to pay for damages \nresulting from early lease terminations if the tenant meets the emergency transfer requirements under VAWA, but \nthey expressed concern that this will deplete limited funds for homeless families. Commenters further expressed \nconcern that owners or landlords might turn to these funds before attempting to mitigate damages caused by the \nlease terminations. Commenters recommended that HUD develop a process for housing providers to apply for \nthese funds where they must document the hardship, explain why the funds are needed, and report efforts to \nmitigate damages.\n \n\n  HUD Response: In this rule HUD does not intend to restrict currently available resources that could fund \nemergency transfers. As a result, HUD maintains that paying for damages is an eligible cost of ESG and CoC \nfunds, and declines to develop the process that the commenter suggested.\n \n\n  Comment: Housing providers should pay transfer costs. A commenter applauded HUD for including a provision \nthat encourages covered housing providers to bear emergency transfer costs. The commenter said only about half \nthe States have protections for victims who terminate their leases to escape from violence and recommended that \nHUD require that covered housing providers not penalize victims who exercise their transfer rights. The commenter \nsuggested that covered housing providers be responsible for covering the costs of emergency transfers, such as \nmoving costs, which are often prohibitive for survivor tenants. The commenter stated that, under the Philadelphia \nHousing Authority lease agreement, the housing authority agrees to pay for reasonable costs related to mandatory \ntransfers and reasonable accommodation transfers.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD understands that moving costs may be prohibitive for some victims of domestic violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, and encourages housing providers to bear these costs where possible, \nor to work with victims to identify possibilities for funding transfers. Local victim service providers may be able to \nprovide help with funding transfers. As discussed earlier in this preamble, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) \nadministers programs that provide funding for victims covered by VAWA, and the Victims Crime Fund could be \nused to pay for relocation expenses of these victims, or to provide other sources of support, which could free up \nfunding to pay for moving costs.\n \n\n\n\n  As noted in the proposed rule, HUD's CoC regulations, in addition to containing regulations that provide for a \nvictim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking to retain their tenant-based rental \nassistance and move to a different CoC geographic area, include reasonable one-time moving costs as eligible \nsupportive services cost. (See 24 CFR 578.53(e)(2).) In addition, under this rule's HOME regulations at \n\u00a7&thinsp;92.359 (e), HOPWA regulations at \u00a7&thinsp;574.604(f), and CoC regulations at \u00a7&thinsp;578.99(j), leases \nand occupancy agreements must include a provision that tenants may terminate their leases without penalty if they \nmeet the conditions for an emergency transfer under this rule.\n <h5>\n  c. Model Transfer Requests</h5>\n \n  Comment: HUD should issue a model emergency transfer request. Commenters recommended that HUD create a \nmodel emergency transfer request, and that issuance of such a model would help facilitate the transfer. Another \ncommenter said that issuance of such a model would help ensure consistency across HUD-covered programs. A \ncommenter stated a model transfer request is important since a less experienced landlord may doubt a victim's \nclaims. Another commenter said a model transfer request would be beneficial to housing providers as it would \nprovide specific guidance for them on what a request should contain, and would enable them to quickly identify the \ntype of transfer being requested, with the hope that a transfer of this nature would be prioritized over other types of \nrequests.\n \n\n  Commenters said HUD should prepare a model emergency transfer request that includes the following \ninformation: The eligibility criteria for requesting the emergency transfer, the definition of a \u201csafe and available\u201d unit, \na checklist for the required documentation the victim must provide to support the need for such a transfer, including \na statement that the tenant reasonably believes he or she is imminently threatened by harm and documentation of \nthe violence and the basis for that belief, and any conditions the tenant must meet to continue to receive VAWA \nprotections, such as not inviting/allowing the perpetrator into the new unit or not revealing the location of the new \nunit to the perpetrator. Another commenter stated that the model should specify the location to be transferred, time \nof transfer, and other pertinent information for the emergency transfer.\n \n\n  Another commenter said the model request should allow the survivor to assert either an imminent threat of \nviolence or a sexual assault that occurred on the premises within the last 90 days and should reflect the date on \nwhich the survivor submitted the request to transfer. Commenter said additional recommendations for inclusion in \nthe model included: Establishment of a grievance plan when transfers are denied, or are granted but unsafe; a \nprovision that survivors incur no costs other than their own expenses to move; a provision that transfer requests be \nconsidered mandatory; and a requirement that covered housing programs not penalize survivors who meet the \nemergency transfer requirements for exercising their rights. A commenter said a model request should include \nname of the perpetrator, if known, name of the victim(s), names of the family members who would be transferring \nwith the victim, a brief description of why the victim would fear imminent harm or personal threat if made to remain \nin the unit, and/or self-identification as a sexual assault survivor.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates these comments and has created a model emergency transfer request that \nhousing providers may use if they choose to require that tenants requesting emergency transfers submit \ndocumentation. The model emergency transfer request includes the requirements that victims of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking must meet to qualify for an emergency transfer under \nVAWA; information about other types of documentation that those requesting a transfer may submit if the victim has \nsuch documentation and it is safe to provide; information on maintaining confidentiality of information the victim \nsubmits to the housing provider; and it requests information from victims about their households, the accused \nperpetrators if this is known and can be safely disclosed, and about why the victims qualify for an emergency \ntransfer under VAWA. The model emergency transfer request also notes that submission of false information could \njeopardize program eligibility and could be the basis for denial of admission, termination of assistance, or eviction, \n\n\n\nand has a line for the person filling out the form to sign and date it. The model emergency transfer request does not \ninclude details about a housing provider's emergency transfer policy because it is incumbent on the housing \nprovider to provide such information in its emergency transfer plan.\n \n  Comment: A model emergency transfer request should not be mandatory. Commenters said a model transfer \nrequest form would be helpful but should not be mandatory. Commenters said this could lessen the burden on \nhousing providers and ensure providers are using a standard product that satisfies the rule's requirements, but \nhousing providers should be free to develop and use their own forms if they so desire, which could be tailored to the \nindividual requirements of the covered housing provider, and any model request should be optional.\n \n\n  HUD Response: The model transfer request form is only a model form and housing providers are not required to \nuse it.\n \n  Comment: Any model request should include certain aspects and should be considered documentation. Some \ncommenters suggested that if HUD develops a model emergency transfer request form, any description of the need \nfor a transfer by a tenant must be brief and in the tenant's own words, and have a date the request was made and \nthe date it was granted or denied, and a description of where the tenant believes she or he will be safe or unsafe to \nmove. Additionally, commenters said if HUD develops a model emergency transfer request form, this form should \nbe used as documentation of the need for a transfer, and the existing documentation requirements under \n\u00a7&thinsp;5.2007 should be supplanted by this form and this should be adopted in regulations under \n\u00a7&thinsp;5.2005.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD agrees that the model emergency transfer request form may serve as documentation of the \nneed for a transfer. As described earlier in this preamble \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e) of this final rule specifies that housing \nproviders may, at their discretion, require tenants seeking emergency transfers to submit written requests and \nhousing providers may ask tenants who request an emergency transfer to fill out the model transfer request form. \nHowever, as also described earlier, this form will not supplant documentation requirements under \u00a7&thinsp;5.2007, \nbecause the first criteria a tenant requesting an emergency transfer under VAWA must meet is that the tenant is a \nvictim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Therefore, housing providers may, but do \nnot need to, request documentation in accordance with \u00a7&thinsp;5.2007 to document the occurrence of the VAWA \nincident or incidents. This model transfer request form also does not ask the tenant to identify areas where he or \nshe feels safe or unsafe, although housing providers are welcome to include that on their own forms.\n \n\n  Comment: There could be problems with including criteria for requesting an emergency transfer in a model \nrequest. A commenter expressed concerns about including criteria for requesting the emergency transfer within a \nmodel emergency transfer request. According to commenter, different situations could justify an emergency transfer \nso any language around criteria would need to be broad and give providers the flexibility to interpret the criteria \nbased on a tenant's situation. The commenter also recommended that HUD seek out domestic violence experts for \ntheir suggestions on appropriate criteria and language to avoid language like \u201creasonable belief that the tenant is \nbeing threatened\u201d which is overly restrictive and not that helpful for providers new to this issue in understanding \nwhat merits reasonable belief.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD reiterates that the model emergency transfer request is a model request and is not required \nto be used. The model emergency transfer request form developed by HUD asks those who request an emergency \ntransfer under VAWA to certify that they meet the criteria for an emergency transfer under VAWA. The model form \nexplains, consistent with the language of VAWA, that a reasonable belief that the tenant is threatened with \nimminent harm from further violence means that the tenant has a reason to fear that, without a transfer, the tenant \nwould suffer violence in the very near future.\n\n\n\n <h5>\n  d. Transfer Plans</h5>\n \n  Comment: HUD should provide separate model emergency transfer plans for different housing programs. \nCommenters recommended that HUD provide separate model emergency plans for public housing, the voucher \nprogram, project-based rental assistance, and other programs in recognition of the various laws and regulations \napplicable to different housing programs. A commenter said that, as an alternative to formulating specific plans, \nthere could be one plan that provides specific applications for each program.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD's emergency transfer plan contains specific elements, described in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e), that \nmust be adopted by all housing providers, regardless of the HUD housing program in which they participate, in \nformulating their own plans. However, housing providers have discretion as to other elements that should be \nincluded in their plans, subject to program-specific requirements that supplement the requirements in \n\u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e), as the plan is to be tailored to specific capabilities of the provider and any specific requirements \nof the HUD housing program in which they participate that may affect the ability of a housing provider to facilitate a \ntransfer on an emergency basis. HUD program offices will provide assistance to housing providers in developing \nemergency transfer plans.\n \n  Comment: HUD should allow flexibility for housing providers to determine what their emergency transfer plans look \nlike. Commenter stated that thoughtful screening and implementation are required and an emergency transfer may \ntake different forms and timelines depending on resources and process. Another commenter expressed support for \nHUD providing a model emergency transfer plan for housing providers, as an example only, and recommended \nallowing providers the flexibility to develop or continue implementing their own plans based on local needs and \nresources to manage emergency transfer requests. Another commenter said the regulation should make clear that \ncovered housing providers do not have to utilize the exact language in HUD's model plan, so long as the housing \nprovider's plan includes all mandatory components. To ease administrative burden and to assist housing providers \nin implementing or amending their emergency transfer plans, commenter said the regulation should also identify \nmandatory and discretionary components. A commenter said providers must adopt an emergency transfer policy \nsubstantively the same as HUD's model, so a provider's plan could eliminate the irrelevant paragraph on \nintroductory matter in HUD's model and remain substantively the same.\n \n  Another commenter said that VAWA 2013 does not require housing providers to adopt the agencies' plans and it \nmay be that providers will write, or will have written, their own plans. Other commenters cited a Senate Committee \nreport from 2012 that said it is the Committee's intent that emergency transfer policies should be tailored to the \nvarious types of housing programs covered by the bill, recognizing that housing providers have varying abilities to \ntransfer occupants based on the volume and availability of dwelling units under their control.\n \n\n  HUD Response: As described above, HUD's model emergency transfer plan is a model plan that presents the \nbasic elements set out in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e) of this rule to be included in any plan. Housing providers, however, will \nadopt their own plans that incorporates such other elements specific to the HUD housing program in which the \nhousing provider participates that may need to be addressed in the emergency transfer plan.\n \n\n  Comment: Emergency transfer plans should provide more guidance. Commenters stated that a 2012 Senate \nCommittee report said that the emergency transfer plans should include guidance for use in situations where it is \nnot feasible for a housing provider to provide a transfer. The commenters said that, for example, HUD should \nconsider including a HUD resource person in each HUD hub or HUD program center to assist tenants with alternate \nhousing options, including, assisted housing properties with local preferences for victims of domestic violence, \nreferral to the local PHA, and access to and use of tenant protection vouchers. Another commenter said the plan \nshould also provide more detailed explanations of the protections afforded to victims and provide specific examples \n\n\n\nof transfers in order to help ensure conformity among housing providers when responding to emergency requests to \ntransfer.\n \n  A commenter said HUD's model transfer plan must address the obligations for a covered housing provider that \nreceives a request to relocate a survivor to their jurisdiction from another covered housing provider. The commenter \nsaid that, at the very least, the model transfer plan should provide guidance for how a covered housing provider \nshould analyze the request and set forth a time frame for responding to the request.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates these suggestions, but declines to require that a housing provider address \neach of these suggestions in its emergency transfer plan. However, HUD encourages housing providers to consider \nthese suggestions. Housing providers should be familiar with and, if they have not already done so, establish \nrelationships with organizations that assist survivors of domestic violence, particularly those that offer help in \nlocating safe housing for victims of domestic violence. HUD is fully aware of the shortage of available units \nassisted by HUD under all of its covered HUD programs, and these organizations can be a valuable resource in \nhelping victims of domestic violence. HUD will provide assistance to help housing providers develop their own \nemergency transfer plans, and further assist in helping to identify HUD housing providers located in the same \njurisdiction that may be able to assist one another in helping, even on a temporary basis, a victim of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking who has been residing in or occupying housing covered by \nthis rule.\n \n\n  Comment: The model transfer plan should include reasonable timeframes for tenants and providers regarding \nsubmission of documents and responding to requests. Commenters said HUD should require housing providers to \ngive tenants a status update on their request within a reasonable amount of time. A commenter stated that, \nbecause of the urgent nature of the situation, there should be time periods set out for effecting emergency transfers. \nThe commenters said, for example, that all transfer applications submitted because of a household member's \nstatus as a victim of domestic or sexual violence should be processed and responded to within 48 to 72 hours. A \ncommenter said, if granted, the housing provider should be required to show the household an available unit at \nleast 1.5 miles from the current unit and current address of the perpetrator within one week; and if the resident \naccepts, the housing provider must sign a lease and allow the tenant to move within 24 hours of acceptance. The \ncommenters suggested that if a unit is not available, then the housing provider should be required to make a \nreferral to other housing providers or the agency administering Section 8 vouchers within 48 to 72 hours of the \nrequest.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates these suggestions and emphasizes that housing providers should process \nemergency transfer requests as quickly as possible to protect the health and safety of those requesting emergency \ntransfers under VAWA. The housing providers should also give tenants a status update of their request if the \nemergency transfer cannot be provided immediately. However, in this final rule, HUD does not mandate specific \ntime periods for responding to emergency transfer requests, but may consider establishing timelines in future \nrulemaking after time to determine the effectiveness of different emergency transfer policies implemented in \naccordance with this rule. HUD declines to mandate that housing providers show tenants requesting an emergency \ntransfer an available unit that is a specific distance away from the current unit as closer available units may be safe, \nand may be more desirable to the tenant requesting the transfer, depending on different circumstances.\n \n\n  Comment: The model transfer plan should include a provision explaining that tenants are not responsible for rent if \nthey have to relocate to a shelter. A commenter suggested that the model transfer plan include language saying \nthat, in cases where the family is in immediate danger and needs to relocate to a domestic violence shelter or other \ntemporary housing while waiting for a housing provider to process the transfer, the tenant will not be responsible for \nongoing rent so long as the tenant has removed all belongings and returned the keys to the unit. The commenter \n\n\n\nfurther suggested that the model plan state that, under these circumstances, the housing provider will waive any \nnormally required notice of lease termination.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD's model emergency transfer plan outlines generally applicable requirements under VAWA \nand this rule. The authority to exempt a tenant, who is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault, or stalking from payment of rent after the tenant departs the unit or the authority to waive any required \nnotification of lease termination is program-specific. Not all HUD programs have this authority. However, where a \nhousing provider has such authority, the housing provider should include this information in its own emergency \ntransfer plan. Where any requirement that may impede the emergency transfer of a victim of domestic violence is a \nHUD regulation, and not a statutory requirement, HUD stands ready to consider waiving the regulation for good \ncause shown, which would be the need to transfer a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, \nor stalking to a safe location as quickly as possible. Please see the table, set out later in this preamble, which lists \nthe covered HUD programs and which programs have the authority to allow remaining family members to remain in \nthe subsidized unit after the tenant who established eligibility for the unit has left.\n \n  Comment: HUD should add language for clarity to the model emergency transfer plan. Commenters \nrecommended that HUD add language about \u201csexual assault\u201d and \u201celigibility to all victims, regardless of sex or \ngender identity\u201d to the model emergency transfer plan. Another commenter said there is a paragraph in the model \nemergency transfer plan that indicates that requests must be \u201cexplicit,\u201d but participants must request emergency \ntransfers in writing and the paragraph should expressly state that the request has to be in writing. Another \ncommenter said the plan should clarify that the size of the housing provider may affect the ability of the housing \nprovider to execute emergency transfer requests; that is a housing provider with a small number of units may be \nlimited in its ability to find a safe available unit.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD has revised the title of the model emergency transfer plan to read \u201cModel Emergency \nTransfer Plan for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking.\u201d HUD has also \nmoved discussion of the fact that eligibility extends to all victims regardless of sex, gender identity, or sexual \norientation into the main body of the document rather than only providing this information in a footnote. HUD has \nalso inserted a footnote stating that housing providers cannot discriminate on the basis of any protected \ncharacteristic, including race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, disability, or age, and that HUD-\nassisted and HUD-insured housing programs must be made available to all otherwise eligible individuals regardless \nof actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status.\n \n  HUD declines, however, to revise the model plan in the other ways suggested by the commenters. This final rule \nclarifies, in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e), that housing providers may request that participants request emergency transfers in \nwriting, but they are not required to do so, and housing providers may process emergency transfers requests that \nare not in writing as long as the tenant expressly requests the transfer. As to reference to the size of the housing \nprovider, the model plan already indicates that the housing provider, regardless of size, cannot guarantee that a \ntransfer request will be approved. As HUD noted earlier, HUD is aware of the limited availability of units assisted by \nHUD under its programs. HUD reiterates that HUD's emergency transfer plan is a model plan and that each \nhousing provider will adopt its own plan. HUD encourages all housing providers to include as much specific \ninformation applicable to the transfer as possible, consistent with the requirements of the HUD program in which the \nhousing provider participates.\n \n\n  Comment: The emergency transfer plan must incorporate strict confidentiality measures. Commenters strongly \nexpressed support for HUD's language in the model emergency transfer plan to maintain \u201cstrict\u201d confidentiality \nmeasures for emergency transfer. The commenters said that, at a minimum, these measures must meet the \nstandards outlined in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2007(c), including prohibitions against employee access to confidential \ninformation, entering information into shared databases, or disclosing, revealing or releasing information except for \n\n\n\nas provided in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2007(c). Commenters said that inclusion of this language is necessary to ensure that the \ncovered housing provider does not disclose the location of the dwelling unit of the tenant to a person who \ncommitted or threatened to commit an act of domestic violence, dating violence sexual assault or stalking against \nthe tenant.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD agrees with commenters about the importance of strict confidentiality, and retains language \nin the model emergency transfer plan that the housing provider keep confidential any information that the tenant \nsubmits in requesting an emergency transfer, and information about the emergency transfer, unless the tenant \ngives the housing provider written permission to release the information, or disclosure is required by law or required \nfor use in an eviction proceeding or hearing regarding termination of assistance from the covered program. The \nconfidentiality required includes keeping confidential the new location of the dwelling unit of the tenant, if one is \nprovided, from the person(s) that committed an act(s) of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or \nstalking against the tenant. HUD has added to the model emergency transfer form that tenants should see the \nNotice of Occupancy Rights Under the Violence Against Women Act for more information about a housing \nprovider's responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of information related to incidents of domestic violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.\n \n\n  Comment: Transfer plans should be developed with the consultation of State and local experts on domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Commenters said that the emergency transfer plans and \nother VAWA policies are greatly improved when developed in consultation with victim advocacy experts. \nCommenters recommended inserting a statement in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e) that all plans must be developed in \nconsultation with state and local experts.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD agrees with the commenters' suggestion and, although HUD is not mandating consultation, \nHUD strongly encourages housing providers to consult with victim advocacy experts in developing their emergency \ntransfer plans. In this final rule, HUD lists outreach activities to organizations that assist or provide resources to \nvictims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as one of the efforts covered housing \nproviders may take to assist tenants in making emergency transfers. Please see HUD's response to an earlier \ncomment in which HUD stressed the importance of housing providers becoming familiar and establishing \nrelationships with victim advocacy organizations, and with becoming familiar with other housing providers, whether \nproviding private market units, or other government-assisted units, not solely HUD-assisted, to establish a network \nof support which a housing provider could use to help a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault, or stalking who needs to move quickly.\n \n\n  Comment: Correct error in ESG program regulation and clarify who is responsible for developing and \nimplementing the emergency transfer plan. Commenters identified a paragraph numbering error in the proposed \nVAWA regulations for the ESG program, at \u00a7&thinsp;576.407(g)(3)(i) (where the section is listed twice), but also \nstated that the second occurrence of the provision gives the recipient several options for designating which entity is \nresponsible for developing and implementing the emergency transfer plan. The commenter recommended changing \nthis proposed provision to say that the recipient must develop an emergency transfer plan to meet VAWA \nrequirements and each CoC, in which subrecipients are located, must submit their own plan for approval by the \nrecipient. The plan would be a CoC-specific plan in compliance with the recipient's plan, which provides CoC \nimplementation detail. The commenter further said that all plans must be developed in consultation with State and \nlocal experts on domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.\n \n  Another commenter asked which of HUD's housing programs must adopt an emergency transfer plan based on \nHUD's model plan.\n \n\n\n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates the commenter advising HUD of the error in \u00a7&thinsp;576.407(g) in the \nproposed rule and HUD corrects this in this final rule. The final rule also makes clarifying changes to the new \n\u00a7&thinsp;576.409(d) to clearly establish who is responsible for developing emergency transfer plans in ESG. This \nprovision is consistent with the existing ESG requirements for developing written standards for administering ESG \nassistance. HUD emphasizes that all emergency transfer plans must incorporate the components listed in \n\u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e) of this rule, and for ESG it must also include the requirements provided under \n\u00a7&thinsp;576.409. As discussed in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e) and later in this preamble, all emergency transfer plans must \ndescribe policies to assist tenants who qualify for emergency transfers under VAWA, such as any outreach \nactivities to organizations that assist or provide resources to victims. HUD encourages all housing providers to work \nwith victim service providers to develop emergency transfer plans, wherever feasible. Covered housing providers in \neach of HUD's housing programs must adopt an emergency transfer plan. Where there are multiple covered \nhousing providers within a program, the program-specific regulations identify which housing providers are \nresponsible for developing and carrying out emergency transfer plans.\n \n  Rule Change: HUD moves the ESG VAWA requirements from \u00a7&thinsp;576.407(g) to \u00a7&thinsp;576.409 and \nclarifies the responsibility for developing emergency transfer plans to be more consistent with existing ESG \nrequirements on developing written standards for ESG assistance.\n \n  Comment: Emergency transfer plans should provide \u201capproval\u201d criteria housing providers can reference to guide \nas the basis for approving a request for emergency transfer. Commenters stated that HUD should provide criteria in \nthe model emergency transfer plan for covered housing providers to reference when approving an emergency \ntransfer, which should include factors that take into consideration a wide range of possible scenarios and that can \nbe uniformly standardized for each specific covered housing provider. Commenters said standardized criteria will \nhelp covered housing providers to evaluate transfer requests and to demonstrate their reasonable attempt to qualify \na tenant for an emergency transfer, affording them some degree of safe harbor from litigation. Commenters said \nHUD's model emergency transfer plan should include required criteria for requesting an emergency transfer to an \n\u201cavailable and safe unit.\u201d\n \n\n  HUD Response: As previously discussed, and with this final rule, HUD presents a generally applicable model \nemergency transfer plan. HUD's program offices will be able to assist housing providers in covered programs that \nthey administer with creating their own emergency transfer plans. HUD understands the requests for more specific \ncriteria in a model transfer plan. The request made by these commenters for more specific criteria is one of several \nthat HUD has already addressed in this preamble. VAWA 2013 brought under coverage HUD programs that are \nvery different from each other. The housing providers under these programs are not always direct grantees, such as \nthe case with PHAs, but may be subrecipients receiving assistance from governmental entities that received HUD \nassistance through formula programs. Consequently, the program requirements vary because of the varied nature \nof HUD programs. As HUD has further stated, although HUD is providing a general model emergency transfer plan, \none designed to incorporate the key protections of VAWA 2013, housing providers not only should but are expected \nto design emergency transfer plans that not only incorporate the key protections of VAWA 2013, but reflect unique \nrequirements or features of their programs. Again, HUD program staff will be available to assist covered housing \nproviders or other grantees or recipients charged with the development of an emergency transfer plan. As to \nstandardized criteria for evaluating transfer requests, HUD discussed earlier in this preamble that, under this final \nrule, housing providers may request that individuals submit written requests certifying that they meet the criteria for \nan emergency transfer under VAWA, as well as documentation that they qualify for VAWA protections, but cannot \nrequire victims requesting emergency transfers to provide third-party or other additional forms of documentation in \norder to qualify for an emergency transfer.\n \n  Comment: Transfer plans should contain more information about protection for victims. Commenters said that in \norder to better notify victims of their rights under VAWA, a provision should be added under the title \u201cEmergency \nTransfer Request Documentation\u201d that if a victim verbally requests an emergency transfer, the housing provider \nmust notify the victim within 24 hours that a written request for a transfer must be submitted, and the notice to the \n\n\n\nvictim should include information on how to submit a written request for a transfer and what information must be \nprovided. Commenters said the plan should also state that third-party verification of the person's status as a victim \nis not required until after the transfer and only self-certification is required prior to it. Commenters also said HUD's \nmodel emergency transfer plan should include a provision that the victim may reject an offered unit that does not \nreduce the risk of harm and request that the housing provider offer another unit if available. Commenters further \nsaid a provision should be added to the plan stating that a housing provider may not require a tenant to pay certain \ncosts in order to transfer, which include but are not limited to paying off a previous balance or paying an additional \nsecurity deposit if the tenant relocates to another unit from the same housing provider, and a victim should not bear \nthe costs associated with the transfer.\n \n\n  HUD Response: As previously discussed in this preamble, HUD amends \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e) of this rule, and also \namends the Notice of Occupancy Rights Under VAWA that all tenants will receive, to clarify that housing providers \nmay require written requests for emergency transfers. Housing providers should explain in their emergency transfer \nplans whether they will require written requests for transfers, and, if so, whether a specific form will be required or \nany written request will suffice. If a written request is required, HUD has developed a model form to help facilitate \nthe submission and processing of a request. However, HUD encourages housing providers not to require written \nrequests in exigent circumstances where an individual's health or safety is at risk. As also explained previously, \nhousing providers may not require third-party documentation in order for a tenant to be eligible for an emergency \ntransfer.\n \n  As commenter suggested, HUD has revised its model plan to include a statement that if a tenant reasonably \nbelieves a proposed transfer would not be safe, the tenant may request a transfer to a different unit. HUD has also \nrevised its model plan to add a provision stating that tenants who are not in good standing may still request an \nemergency transfer if they meet the eligibility requirements in this section. As explained elsewhere in this preamble, \nhowever, tenants may have to pay certain costs associated with transfers.\n \n  Comment: Transfer plans should be readily available to tenants. Commenters said the covered housing program's \nemergency transfer plan must be publicly available and prominently displayed at the project site, so that tenants \nunderstand they have this option.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD agrees and requires housing providers to make emergency transfer plans publicly available \nwhenever feasible, and, in all circumstances, available upon request.\n \n  Rule Change: Section 5.2005(e) is revised in this final rule to state that housing providers must make emergency \ntransfer plans available upon request, and must make them publicly available whenever feasible.\n <h5>\n  e. Transfer Eligibility</h5>\n \n  Comment: Residents should be allowed to transfer even if their incomes are too high. Commenters stated that \nresidents should be allowed to transfer if they are currently receiving a subsidy even if the household is receiving \nincome in excess of published limits. The commenter said that, for example, the Tenant Rental Assistance \nCertification System (TRACS) allows for a transfer even if an individual no longer meets the income limit required \nfor a new move-in, but not exceeds those limits. A commenter stated that victims should not fail to exercise their \nprotections because they are afraid of losing their housing/subsidy.\n \n\n  HUD Response: This rule does not establish any new requirements for determining program eligibility, or include \nrequirements pertaining to transfers other than the requirements with respect to emergency transfers that are \nimplemented by this final rule. Existing program regulations govern transfers apart from emergency transfers \nrequests by victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking.\n\n\n\n \n  Comment: Explain whether minors are eligible for emergency transfers. Commenters asked if a VAWA claim is \nmade by an individual under the age of 18, whether management can transfer the victim to another unit, or whether \na third party should be involved.\n \n\n  HUD Response: Un-emancipated minors would not be eligible to sign leases under HUD programs. Housing \nproviders should consider contacting child welfare or child protective services, or law enforcement when a minor \nclaims to be the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.\n \n  Comment: Clarify whether housing providers may or must establish eligibility preferences for victims under VAWA, \nor waive program requirements. Commenters asked how VAWA emergency transfer plans impact covered housing \nproviders' waiting lists. A commenter stated that the rule should clarify that housing providers are allowed, but not \nrequired to establish preferences for victims under VAWA, and that any preferences do not waive eligibility \nrequirements. The commenter also stated that housing providers should be allowed to provide preferences for \nVAWA victims that are existing residents without providing preferences to individuals who have no relationship with \nthe housing provider. Other commenters asked if agencies that administer vouchers would be required to give \nabsolute priority for the next available voucher to satisfy an emergency transfer request. These commenters also \nasked whether, if there are no vouchers available at the time of an emergency transfer request, or the waiting list for \nthe voucher program is closed, there would be legal ramifications or other consequences for being unable to satisfy \nsuch a request.\n \n  Another commenter said HUD should clearly specify how covered housing providers are to balance the interests \nof applicants and current tenants who may need VAWA protections. Some commenters said HUD should expressly \nstate that housing providers' obligation to help tenants transfer to safe housing supersedes wait list, tenant \npreference, or prioritization obligations and non-emergency transfers. Commenter said the negative effects of delay \nin transfers include forced homelessness and seeking emergency shelter, which can affect one's employment and \ngetting children to school.\n \n  Other commenters said that HUD should require a preference for victims who have met emergency transfer \ndocumentation requirements so that they may move to the top of the waiting list for a transfer to another property \nunder the covered housing provider's control. Other commenters asked that HUD address the implementation of \nemergency transfers as they relate to other competing tenant preferences such as disability and homelessness.\n \n  Commenters said HUD should clarify that housing providers can establish a voluntary preference for the \nemergency transfer of VAWA-related victims, which could help facilitate a relocation that may require an effective \ntermination at one property, and enable priority move-in at another site that may be separately owned or operated. \nA commenter asked that HUD articulate how housing providers may adopt a preference for VAWA.\n \n  A commenter stated that HUD's model emergency transfer plan does not clarify what the housing provider is \nrequired or allowed to do to expedite the transfer process, and requested that HUD expressly state how a PHA and \nowner should comply with the transfer requirement given the covered providers' obligation to observe waitlist rules. \nA commenter recommended that HUD expressly state whether the waitlist rules under the HOME program are \nviolated by complying with a VAWA emergency transfer policy.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD commends these commenters who raise concerns that reflect the desire to help victims of \nthose crimes addressed in VAWA without interfering with the housing needs of individuals and families residing in \nunits administered by the housing provider or on the housing provider's applicant waitlist. HUD acknowledges the \ndifficulty of achieving the right balance. This is the reason that VAWA 2013 requires an emergency transfer plan so \nthat covered housing providers may plan in advance, what actions to take when a victim of domestic violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault, or stalking needs an emergency transfer. The goal is for the plan to facilitate an \n\n\n\nemergency transfer under VAWA as expeditiously as possible. The suggestion by one commenter that housing \nproviders establish a preference for victims that need an emergency transfer, not all victims but again those that \nneed an emergency transfer, may be one way to achieve that goal.\n \n\n  Consistent with program requirements and allowances, housing providers in covered programs are allowed to \nestablish preferences for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. These \npreferences, if established, must be established in accordance with statutory or regulatory requirements that govern \nthe establishment of preferences.  (10)  HUD notes that existing regulations for the public housing and housing \nchoice voucher programs (in 24 CFR 960.206(b)(4) and 24 CFR 982.207(b)(4)) provide that PHAs should consider \nadoption of a local preference for admission of families that include victims of domestic violence. Such adoption \nwould be an admission preference, admitting individuals as new tenants to a covered program, and not to be \nconfused with a transfer priority list, which a housing provider could use to assist existing tenants. While HUD's final \nrule does not require housing providers to establish admission preferences for victims of VAWA incidents or transfer \npriority lists to aid existing tenants in a covered housing program to make an emergency transfer, HUD encourages \nhousing providers to do so. Whether a housing provider chooses an admission preference or establishes a transfer \npriority list, or chooses not to or is unable to choose these approaches because of statutory provisions, the fact \nremains that a housing provider must prepare a workable emergency transfer plan; that is, if a housing provider \ncannot provide a tenant who needs an emergency transfer with an available safe unit immediately, the housing \nprovider must have resources and policies that it can turn to help this tenant.\n \n  HUD further clarifies in this final rule that covered housing providers must detail in their emergency transfer plans \nthe measure of any priority that those who qualify for an emergency transfer under VAWA will receive. Existing \ntenants of a housing provider who request a transfer to another unit for which they would not be required to submit \nan application (what this rule calls an internal emergency transfer, and an example would be where no application \nwould be required for a public housing tenant to transfer from one building within a PHA's portfolio to another \nbuilding within the PHA's portfolio) should not be placed on applicant waiting lists, as these tenants are not new \napplicants. Where a tenant requests a transfer to a housing unit where an application would be required (what this \nrule calls an external emergency transfer, and an example would be a transfer to a different program or to a unit \nthat the housing provider does not control), each covered housing provider's emergency transfer plan must provide \nmeasures to assist these tenants. For example, under the plan a provider may have established relationships with \nother covered housing providers in the same jurisdiction where they share updated information on available units, \nor relationships with victim service providers who can assist tenants in locating, and quickly moving to, a safe and \navailable unit.\n \n\n  The purpose of these clarifications is to ensure individuals who qualify for an emergency transfer under VAWA \nreceive a meaningful opportunity to transfer as expeditiously as possible and to avoid the possibility that such \nindividuals may, for example, be placed on the bottom of an applicant waiting list with no other measures taken to \nassist the individuals, counter to the intent of the emergency transfer provision. The provider, through their \nemergency transfer plan, must develop a plan for what actions to take when a victim of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, or stalking needs an emergency transfer while balancing the needs of other eligible \nindividuals.\n \n  HUD understands that housing providers receive requests for emergency transfers other than by those who may \nbe victims of VAWA crimes, and therefore housing providers may maintain a list of those requesting emergency \ntransfers. Where a housing provider maintains such a list, an individual seeking an emergency transfer under \nVAWA must be placed on this list or on a separate list for emergency transfers under VAWA. Such lists for \nproviding emergency transfers must be maintained consistent with program confidentiality requirements and HUD's \nconfidentiality requirements at \u00a7&thinsp;5.2007(c). Alternatively, if there is no list, an individual requesting an \nemergency transfer under VAWA must, at a minimum, be given any priority as an emergency transfer requestor \n\n\n\nthat is consistent with the mechanism the housing provider has in place to track emergency transfer or general \ntransfer requests.\n \n  In cases where there are multiple individuals who need and qualify for a vacant unit, HUD strongly encourages \nhousing providers to transfer applicants who qualify for an emergency transfer under VAWA as quickly as possible, \nand to prioritize between multiple individuals that need transfers when there are vacant units for which the tenant \nrequesting the emergency transfer qualifies. Housing providers may give priority to VAWA emergency transfer \nrequests regardless of whether the housing provider prioritizes other types of emergency transfer requests. HUD \nencourages consideration of the danger to the victim of a VAWA crime until a transfer can be made.\n \n  Emergency transfer obligations under VAWA do not supersede any eligibility or other occupancy requirements that \nmay apply under a covered housing program. For example, the tenancy priority for an available accessible unit \nrequired to be accessible under HUD's Section 504 regulation must still be applied to maximize the utilization of \naccessible units by individuals who need the accessibility features. The objective of the emergency transfer plan is \nto develop a plan for how to fill an available unit cognizant of the need to transfer an individual who qualifies for an \nemergency transfer as quickly as possible while meeting other obligations and balancing competing needs.\n \n\n  As for the HOME program, owners must continue to comply with existing statutory requirements when it comes to \nadmitting tenant but are encouraged to implement preferences in their HOME-funded projects for victims of \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking so to assist those needing emergency transfers. \nHUD will issue guidance on implementing the VAWA emergency transfer plan in state and local HOME programs.  \n(11) \n \n  Rule Change: Section 5.2005(e) of this final rule requires that emergency transfer plans must describe how \ncovered housing providers will assist tenants in making an emergency relocation to another unit where the tenant \nwould not be a new applicant (an internal emergency transfer) when a safe unit is not immediately available for the \ntenant, and how covered housing providers will assist tenants in making an emergency relocation to another unit \nwhere the tenant would have to undergo an application process to reside in the new unit (an external emergency \ntransfer) when a safe unit is not immediately available.\n \n\n  The rule specifies that tenants must be able to seek an internal emergency transfer and an external emergency \ntransfer concurrently if a safe unit is not immediately available so that the tenant has a greater opportunity to move \nto a safe unit as quickly as possible. For example, if a tenant is not able to immediately relocate to a safe unit \nbecause there is none available for which the tenant would not have to go through an application process, \nemergency transfer plans must have policies that assist the tenant in making an internal emergency transfer as \nexpeditiously as possible, for example, by placing that tenant on an emergency transfer list, and simultaneously \nprovide the tenant with resources or assistance to seek an external emergency transfer to a unit that may be under \na different provider or different program. The rule specifies that policies for assisting tenants to make external \nemergency transfer include arrangements with other covered housing providers to facilitate moves. These \narrangements could be those that allow housing providers to share tenant files, if the tenant provides written \nconsent to do so and any applicable confidentiality requirements are met, in order to expedite a tenant's new \napplication process, and arrangements where covered housing providers alert one another when a unit becomes \nnewly available for occupancy. The rule also specifies that policies may include outreach activities to organizations \nthat assist or provide resources to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. For \nexample, as discussed earlier, covered housing providers could develop relationships with groups that assist \nvictims covered by VAWA in making emergency transfers.\n \n  Section 5.2005(e)(3) of this final rule provides that, for purposes of notification to existing tenants, and overall \npublic awareness, the emergency transfer plan must describe any measure of priority given to individuals who \nqualify for an emergency transfer under VAWA in relation to other categories of transfers and waiting lists. Under \n\n\n\nthe final rule at 5.2005(e)(6) tenants who request and qualify for an internal emergency transfer must, at a \nminimum, be given any priority that housing providers may already provide to other types of emergency transfer \nrequests. The rule also requires, in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e)(9), that emergency transfer plans must describe policies for \ntenants who have tenant-based rental assistance to make emergency moves with that assistance if this is \nsomething that the covered housing provider may encounter.\n \n\n  Additionally, HUD's regulations at 24 CFR 982.207(b)(4) and 960.206(b)(4) are revised to include victims of dating \nviolence, sexual assault, and stalking, as well as victims of domestic violence, as those whose families should be \nconsidered for admission preferences.\n \n\n  Comment: Explain whether a victim always has to be eligible for a program in order to receive a transfer, or \nwhether requirements could be waived. Commenters stated that it is unclear whether an emergency transfer can be \nprovided to a victim who is not eligible for a unit or whether the VAWA transfer requirement supersedes the \neligibility requirements for special populations, such as elderly or disabled. Other commenters stated that, after the \nfirst year of assistance at a PBV site, families are eligible to receive a tenant-based voucher, and asked whether the \none-year requirement would be waived for VAWA. A commenter suggested that HUD allow families needing an \nemergency transfer under VAWA to request a voucher within the first year of assistance at the PBV development, \nand said PHAs could be required to create a priority on their tenant- based HCV waiting list for these transfers from \na PBV development due to domestic violence. A commenter asked which of its housing resources should be \nprioritized for victims of domestic violence requesting an emergency transfer and requested confirmation from HUD \nof any waivers it may need from HUD to grant an emergency transfer request that may require tenant assignment \nprocedures to operate outside of the agency's standard practices and policies.\n \n\n  HUD Response: The provisions in VAWA on emergency transfer requests do not supersede eligibility \nrequirements for HUD housing serving specific populations, or for any HUD housing covered by VAWA 2013. \nUnlike VAWA 2005, VAWA 2013 did not revise the underlying statutes governing the HUD programs covered by \nVAWA 2013, and therefore, the eligibility requirements for each of the covered HUD programs are unchanged by \nVAWA 2013. Housing providers must continue to comply with the HUD program regulations regarding eligibility, as \nmay be supplemented by guidance that aids covered housing providers in addressing specific fact situations. \nAlthough VAWA 2013 does not override the specific program requirements for the HUD programs covered by \nVAWA 2013, VAWA 2013 requires housing providers in each of the HUD-covered programs to develop and issue \nan emergency transfer plan. As discussed above, to fulfill this requirement, each housing provider must develop a \nplan that does its best to transfer a victim of domestic violence to a safe, available unit as quickly as possible. HUD \nrecognizes that because of statutory requirements, a victim receiving assistance under one HUD program may not \nbe eligible for assistance under another HUD program because of the different eligibility requirements. It is for these \nreasons that, under this final rule, housing providers must take measures to assist victims who may not be eligible \nto transfer to an available unit, such as engaging in outreach to other organizations, such as domestic advocacy \norganizations, faith-based organizations and State and local government entities, to measure the availability of \nassistance that can be provided on an emergency basis. HUD housing providers should also reach out to other \nhousing providers, private market providers and other government-assisted providers to determine where they may \nbe able to assist each other in domestic violence situations. While a housing provider may not have an available \nsafe unit at a point in time when a victim of domestic violence may need one, HUD expects that housing providers' \nemergency transfer plans will provide for other means to help keep victims of domestic violence safe.\n \n\n  With respect to the comments about project-based voucher housing, commenters are correct that, after the first \nyear of assistance at a PBV site, families are eligible to receive a tenant-based voucher. This is a statutory \nprovision that is not changed by HUD's VAWA regulations. HUD allows, but does not require, PHAs to establish \nreasonable transfer policies that do not conflict with statutory provisions, HUD occupancy regulations, or housing \ngoals. However, this final rule does alter the family right to move provisions for project-based vouchers in 24 CFR \n\n\n\n983.261, which provides that families will not be required to notify a PHA before they leave a unit if they are leaving \nbecause a member of the family is the victim of a VAWA crime and the move is needed to protect the health and \nsafety of a family member, or a family member was a victim of sexual assault that occurred on the premises during \nthe 90-calendar-day period before the family requests to move. In such a case, the family will have to notify the \nPHA as soon as possible after they leave the unit, and the PHA will have to offer the family assistance to a different \nunit, or the PHA may offer the family a housing choice voucher if the family had been in the unit for at least a year. \nUnder this final rule, 24 CFR 983.261 also now specifies that a PHA may offer a victim tenant-based rental \nassistance if a family breaks up as a result of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.\n \n\n  With respect to prioritizing victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking for placement \nin housing, HUD does not mandate that housing providers create preferences for victims of domestic violence, but \nencourages housing providers to provide preferences for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault, and stalking consistent with any regulations that govern the establishment of preferences. For example, a \nPHA's system of local preferences must be based on local housing needs and priorities by using general accepted \ndata sources and information obtained through the PHA Plan public comment process (24 CFR 960.206(a)(1) for \npublic housing and 24 CFR 982.207(a)(2) for the HCV program.\n \n\n  Rule Change: 24 CFR 983.261 is revised in this final rule to specify that requirements that families contact PHAs \nin advance of terminating a lease to request comparable tenant-based rental assistance if the family wishes to \nmove do not apply if a member of the family is the victim of a VAWA crime and the move is needed to protect the \nhealth and safety of a family member, or a family member was a victim of sexual assault that occurred on the \npremises during the 90-calendar-day period before the family requests to move. Under this final rule, a PHA may \nnot terminate assistance if the family, with or without prior notification to the PHA, moves out of a unit in violation of \nthe lease, if such move occurs to protect the health or safety of a family member who is or has been the victim of \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking and who reasonably believed he or she was \nthreatened with imminent harm from further violence if he or she remained in the dwelling unit, or any family \nmember has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period \npreceding the family's request to move. This section is also revised to specify that if a family breaks up as a result \nof an occurrence of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, the PHA may offer the victim \nthe opportunity for continued tenant-based rental assistance.\n <h5>\n  f. Effectiveness of Transfers</h5>\n \n\n  Comment: Emergency transfers may be ineffective if they are within the same property, or if victims or survivors \ncompromise their new locations to perpetrators. Commenters stated that emergency relocation to other units within \nthe same development may not be effective in protecting a victim, and housing providers should not transfer a \nvictim to a unit in the same development. A commenter asked whether management could refuse to allow a victim \nto transfer back to the perpetrator's unit if the victim sought such transfer. Another commenter said that rather than \nprovide transfers, it would be more effective to evaluate every victim's situation on a case-by-case basis and use \ndomestic violence shelters where necessary.\n \n  Commenters also expressed concern about the victims themselves disclosing their new location to perpetrators. \nThe commenters said that a victim, as well as other household members, should be required to self-certify a \ndeclaration that they will not disclose the location of a new unit to the perpetrator (if known) nor to anyone known to \nthe victim, and that if they do disclose the new unit's location, the family will not be entitled to any additional unit \ntransfers under the umbrella of VAWA protections. Commenters further suggested that any tenant who invites a \nperpetrator that the tenant knows is not permitted on property grounds into the tenant's unit should receive a lease \nviolation notice.\n \n\n\n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates commenters' concerns, but declines to place restrictions on emergency \ntransfers that would be contrary to the intent of VAWA 2013. VAWA provides that individuals are eligible for \nemergency transfers if they expressly request the transfer and reasonably believe there is a threat of imminent \nharm from further violence if they remain in the same dwelling unit, or, for sexual assault victims, the assault \noccurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the date of the transfer request. There are \nno other restrictions on eligibility that are in the statute.\n \n  HUD is not in a position to speculate on why a survivor might return to live in the perpetrator's unit, or how or why \na perpetrator might come to know of a survivor's new address. Each victim's situation will be unique to the victim. If \nan individual reasonably believes that there is a threat of imminent harm, or if an individual has been sexually \nassaulted on the premises, and that individual requests a transfer, then that individual is eligible for a transfer under \nVAWA to an available unit that they believe to be safe.\n \n  Regarding transfers within the same property, HUD understands that a transfer to a unit within the same \ndevelopment in which the perpetrator resides might not be safe for victims. However, if the unit in the same \ndevelopment is the only one available, the victim should be allowed to consider transferring to the unit. This option \nshould not be foreclosed to the victim. The victim is in the best position to make this decision. Accordingly, HUD \ndoes not prohibit emergency transfers within the same property, but encourage housing providers to endeavor to \nidentify an available unit in another property.\n <h5>\n  g. Emergency Transfers for Sexual Assault</h5>\n \n  Comment: Clarify the requirements for an emergency transfer for victims of sexual assault. Commenters asked \nHUD to clarify whether the condition that the sexual assault occurred on the premises and happened during a 90-\nday period preceding the tenant request for transfer is intended to waive the requirement of reasonable belief of \nimminent harm for other emergency transfers. A commenter said that language in HUD's regulation should explicitly \nstate the conditions under which a victim of sexual assault can request an emergency transfer. A commenter also \nasked if a victim of sexual assault expressly requests a transfer and reasonably believes that there is a threat of \nimminent harm, whether it matters when the sexual assault occurred.\n \n\n  Other commenters said HUD should rescind the specifications that the assault must have occurred within 90 days \nof the emergency transfer request, and that it must have occurred on the premises in order for the victim to be \nprovided an emergency transfer. A commenter said HUD's model emergency transfer plan appears to outline \nstricter guidelines for victims of sexual assault to access protections as compared to victims of domestic violence, \ndating violence and stalking. A commenter stated that victims of sexual violence may experience delayed or long-\nlasting reactions to the trauma and there are many reasons why victims may not report the sexual assault \nimmediately.\n \n\n  Another commenter stated that if an individual is dragged off the premises and sexually assaulted elsewhere, that \nindividual should be able to ask for an emergency transfer. A commenter said that, in the case of children at the \nvery least, who may not disclose the assault for some period of time out of fear, it should not matter if the sexual \nassault occurred more than 90 days prior. A commenter said that it should not matter if a rape occurred off \npremises if the perpetrator of the rape is on the lease and the victim is a tenant.\n \n  Other commenters said that covered housing providers should be encouraged to apply a longer time frame when \nnecessary, and, at a minimum, the language of HUD's proposed regulation at \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e)(1)(b)(ii) should be \nchanged so it is clear that nothing in the regulations prohibits housing providers from considering and approving \ntransfers for victims of sexual assault when the assault occurred more than 90 days before the transfer request was \nmade or the sexual assault did not occur on the premises. Commenters said the proposed regulatory provision, as \n\n\n\nwritten, may cause some confusion or be misinterpreted to suggest that moves to protect the health and safety of \nthe family also must be within the 90-day time frame or experienced on the premises.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD's regulations on emergency transfer for victims of sexual assault mirror the provisions in \nVAWA 2013. The 90-day time frame is from the statute. However, the statutory provisions are the minimum \nrequirements that covered housing providers must meet. Covered housing providers may allow more time. They are \nnot confined to the 90-day period, and should consider additional time, as commenters suggested, given that \ncertain victims of sexual assault may fear disclosure.\n \n\n  Under VAWA 2013, victims of sexual assault qualify for an emergency transfer if they either reasonably believe \nthere is threat of imminent harm from further violence if they remain in their dwelling unit, or, the sexual assault \noccurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the date of the request for transfer. Thus, \nemergency transfer plans must provide that victims of sexual assault will be eligible for an emergency transfer if \nthey expressly request the transfer and they either reasonably believe there is threat of imminent harm from further \nviolence if they remain in their unit, regardless of where or when the sexual assault occurred, or, the sexual assault \noccurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the date of the request for transfer, \nregardless of whether they reasonably believe there is a threat of imminent harm from further violence if they \nremain in their unit. HUD has revised the Notice of Occupancy Rights under VAWA and the Model Emergency \nTransfer Plan to clarify that there are two ways that victims of sexual assault may qualify for an emergency transfer \nunder VAWA. HUD also clarifies this in the rule.\n \n  With respect to a commenter's statement that a victim who was attacked by a perpetrator on the grounds of the \ncovered housing provider but dragged from the property and sexually assaulted elsewhere should be considered as \nmeeting the VAWA requirements for a sexual assault occurring on the premises, HUD finds that this situation would \nmeet the requirement because, in essence, the start of the assault occurred on the premises.\n \n\n  Rule Change: Section 5.2005(e)(2)(ii)(B) is revised to clarify that in the case of a tenant who is a victim of sexual \nassault, the tenant qualifies for a transfer if either the tenant reasonably believes there is a threat of imminent harm \nfrom further violence if the tenant remains within the same unit that the tenant is currently occupying, or the sexual \nassault occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the date of the request for transfer.\n <h5>\n  h. The Scope of the Transfer Provision</h5>\n \n  Comment: Clarify whether a transfer can happen between different properties and different programs, and whether \nsuch transfer would be required and how it would be achieved. Commenters asked for clarification on the meaning \nof \u201ctransfer\u201d\u2014whether a transfer means a transfer within a property, within properties that a housing provider \nadministers, or includes properties not in the housing provider's control. A commenter asked if survivors would be \nable to establish eligibility across different HUD programs, different covered housing providers, different \ngeographies, and housing programs in other agencies, or whether they would be limited to the program and \nhousing provider where they currently reside.\n \n  Commenters asked how a transfer between properties would be coordinated and sought more guidance from \nHUD on transfers. Commenters asked how a PHA that administers the HCV program should effect a transfer and \nwhether the PHA will be responsible for finding the victim a new unit. A commenter asked whether it would be \nacceptable for a PHA to process an expedited \u201cmove with continued assistance\u201d (MWCA) or allow a MWCA when it \nwould otherwise not be allowed.\n \n\n\n\n  Commenters asked whether it is mandatory or discretionary for PHAs to transfer a family from public housing to \nSection 8 housing. A commenter said that flexibility in this area would facilitate a transfer by giving PHAs the ability \nto transfer the household to the first unit or voucher that is available for the household's size regardless of program. \nA commenter also asked whether PHAs would be expected to issue a voucher to a project-based participant at risk \nof domestic violence.\n \n  A commenter asked what a housing provider should do if there are no units available on the current property to \ntransfer the victim to, or there is a unit available but it does not have enough bedrooms to accommodate the victim \nand the victim's family.\n \n\n  HUD Response: In this final rule, HUD clarifies that covered housing providers must allow tenants who meet the \nrule's criteria for an emergency transfer to make an internal emergency transfer, which, as discussed above, is one \nwhere a tenant could reside in a new unit without having to undergo an application process, when a safe unit is \nimmediately available. A significant obligation of every housing provider is to keep its own tenants safe, and where \nan existing tenant meets the eligibility requirements and would not have to undergo an application process in order \nto move to an available unit that is safe, the tenant must be offered the transfer to this unit.\n \n  As discussed in the proposed rule, HUD reads \u201cunder a covered housing program\u201d to mean the covered housing \nprovider must, at a minimum, transfer the tenant to a unit under the provider's control and assisted under the same \ncovered program as the unit in which the tenant was residing, if a unit is available and is safe. This means housing \nproviders may be required to transfer certain tenants to different properties that are under the housing providers' \ncontrol, provided that these properties are under the same program in which the tenant is assisted, and the \nproperties are subject to one wait list. If there is a separate wait list for each of these properties, then the housing \nprovider may not, depending upon program requirements, be able to easily transfer a tenant to another property.\n \n\n  The proposed rule stated that, in addition, covered housing providers must allow tenants who qualify for \nemergency transfers to transfer to a safe and available unit that is under their control and under another covered \nhousing program, if such transfer is permissible under applicable program regulations. This means the program \nregulations for both the program that the tenant is leaving and the program regulations for the program the tenant \nwould be joining allow for a transfer between programs. After further review, HUD has removed this language from \nthe final rule, as at the present time, there are no HUD programs to which an individual could transfer from another \nprogram without applying for housing under a new program. Tenants seeking to move to a unit covered by a \ndifferent program may apply for housing under the new program. However, a housing provider is not fulfilling its \nemergency transfer obligation if the only relief offered to a tenant is to be placed at the bottom of a waiting list for a \nnew program. The housing provider that administered the unit in which the tenant became a victim of domestic \nviolence must have in its emergency transfer plan a process through which the provider will assist the victim in \nfinding alternative housing. For example, the plan could include providing the victim with names, addresses, or \nphone numbers of domestic advocacy organizations that stand ready to assist victims of domestic violence on an \nemergency basis, and a list of other housing providers, whether private market providers or other government-\nassisted housing providers, that may have offered their availability to be contacted by the housing provider who has \na tenant who is a victim of domestic violence, and may possibly be able to offer assistance to a victim of domestic \nviolence.\n \n\n  Certain HUD programs have additional specific requirements under this rule as to actions that housing providers \nmust take to assist tenants in transferring when a safe unit is not immediately available for victims who qualify for \nemergency transfers under VAWA. HOME and HTF require that the participating jurisdiction (in the case of HOME) \nor the grantee (in the case of HTF) must provide a list of properties in the jurisdiction that include HOME or HTF-\nunits (depending on which program the tenant is currently under) to tenants in these programs that request and \nqualify for external emergency transfers under VAWA. Under this rule, the list must include for each property: The \n\n\n\nproperty's address, contact information, the unit sizes (number of bedrooms) for the HOME or HTF-assisted units, \nand, to the extent known, any tenant preferences or eligibility restrictions for the HOME or HTF-assisted units. In \naddition, the participating jurisdiction or the grantee may establish a preference under the program for tenants who \nqualify for emergency transfers, and coordinate with victim service providers and advocates to develop the \nemergency transfer plan, make referrals, and facilitate emergency transfers to safe and available units. For the \nHOME program, the participating jurisdiction may provide HOME tenant-based rental assistance to tenants who \nqualify for emergency transfers under 24 CFR 5.2005(e). Under the ESG and CoC programs, tenants who live in \nassisted units and qualify for emergency transfers under VAWA but cannot make an immediate internal emergency \ntransfer to a safe unit receive priority over all other applicants for new assistance or housing, subject to certain \neligibility restrictions. Additionally, given that 24 CFR 5.2005(e)(9) provides for tenants who are receiving tenant-\nbased rental assistance and qualify for an emergency transfer to move quickly with that assistance, the ESG and \nCoC program rules require the emergency transfer plan to specify what will happen with respect to the non-\ntransferring family member(s), if the family separates in order to effect an emergency transfer. Under HUD's Section \n8 programs and Section 202 and Section 811 programs, this final rule provides that covered housing providers may \nadopt or modify existing admission preferences or transfer waitlist priorities to facilitate emergency transfers for \nvictims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, and must review their existing inventory \nof units and determine when the next vacant unit may be available, and provide a list of nearby HUD subsidized \nrental properties to tenants who qualify for emergency transfers under VAWA.\n \n  As noted earlier in this preamble and provided in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e)(12), emergency transfer obligations under \nVAWA do not supersede any eligibility or other occupancy requirements that may apply under a covered housing \nprogram.\n \n  Housing providers are strongly encouraged to accept emergency transfers from different housing providers, \nincluding transfers from other HUD-covered programs as long as program eligibility requirements are met, even \nthough they are not required to do so. HUD strongly encourages housing providers who accept emergency transfer \nrequests from other housing providers to prioritize those requests from other providers in the same manner that \nthey prioritize VAWA emergency transfer requests that they receive from their own tenants. However, where there \nmay be a conflict between a tenant of a housing provider needing an emergency transfer and a tenant of another \nhousing provider needing an emergency transfer, the housing providers' first obligation is to its own tenants.\n \n  With regard to carrying out a transfer for an HCV participant, the transfer would follow current PHA policies \nregarding transfers. Pursuant to existing regulations, the PHA must allow the family in the tenant-based voucher \nprogram to move with continued tenant-based assistance (24 CFR 982.354(b)(4), 982.353(b)). The PHA must issue \nthe victim a voucher allowing the victim to search for another unit in its jurisdiction, or begin the portability process if \nthe victim wishes to move outside of the PHA's jurisdiction.\n \n  Under the PBV program, the assistance is tied to the unit as opposed, in the case of tenant-based assistance, to \nthe family. Therefore, PBV families cannot move with their PBV assistance. However, if the victim seeks to move \nfrom the victim's unit, has been living in the PBV unit for more than one year, and has given the owner advance \nwritten notice of intent to vacate (with a copy to the PHA) in accordance with the lease, the PHA must give the \nvictim priority to receive the next available opportunity for continued tenant-based rental assistance (24 CFR \n983.261).\n \n\n  In response to the comment about transferring tenants between public housing and Section 8 housing, these are \ndifferent programs, with separate statutory and regulatory requirements, and in order for a tenant to receive \nassistance through a program in which they are not currently participating, they would have to apply for housing \nunder the new program. However, owners may, and HUD strongly encourages owners to, assist tenants in \nfacilitating moves to other programs. Housing providers may be able to facilitate tenant transfers between different \nprograms and different providers by establishing a preference for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, \nsexual assault, or stalking.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Rule Change: Section 5.2005 is revised to state that the emergency transfer plan must allow tenants who are \nvictims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking to make an internal emergency transfer \nunder VAWA when a safe unit is immediately available. The statement regarding transfers to a unit in another \ncovered housing program if such transfer is permissible under applicable program regulations has been removed. \nAdditionally, as previously discussed, \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005 requires that emergency transfer plans describe policies for \nassisting tenants in making internal and external emergency transfers when a safe unit is not immediate available.\n \n  Additionally, this rule revises HUD's HOME and HTF regulations in \u00a7&thinsp;92.359 and \u00a7&thinsp;93.356, \nrespectively, to require that participating jurisdictions or grantees must provide a list of properties in the jurisdiction \nthat include HOME or HTF-assisted units, and information about each property, to tenants who qualify for, and wish \nto make, an external emergency transfer under VAWA. The regulations provide additional actions the participating \njurisdiction or grantee may take to comply with this rule. The rule also revises HUD's ESG and CoC regulations, in \n\u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;576.400(e) and 576.409 (for ESG) and \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;578.7 and 578.99 (for CoC), to provide that families \nliving in units assisted under these programs who qualify for emergency transfers under VAWA but cannot make an \nimmediate internal emergency transfer must be provided with priority over all other applicants for a new unit under \nthese programs or other assistance under these programs, subject to certain restrictions.\n \n\n  Under HUD's Section 8 programs and Section 202 and Section 811 programs, this final rule provides, in \n\u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;880.613, 882.407, 882.804, 884.226, 886.139, and 891.190, that covered housing providers may adopt \nor modify existing admission preferences or transfer waitlist priorities to facilitate emergency transfers for victims of \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, and must review their existing inventory of units \nand determine when the next vacant unit may be available, and provide a list of nearby HUD subsidized rental \nproperties to tenants who qualify for emergency transfers under VAWA.\n \n  Comment: Clarify that a housing provider cannot guarantee safety in a new unit, or that a perpetrator will not learn \nthe new unit's location. Commenters stated that there is no way a housing provider can guarantee safety, and a \ncommenter asked that references to an owner's obligation to transfer a victim to a \u201csafe\u201d dwelling unit be removed \nfrom the rule. Another commenter expressed concern that most HOME-funded developments are single-building, \n50- to 100-unit building, and for transfers made to another unit in the same building where the victim's perpetrator \ncontinues to live, the perpetrator could very quickly learn the location of the victim's emergency transfer unit. \nCommenter asked HUD to make explicit acknowledgement of this scenario in the final regulation.\n \n\n  HUD Response: Neither the VAWA statute nor HUD's regulations require a housing provider to guarantee safety. \nAs noted in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005 (e)(1), this rule defines a safe unit for emergency transfer purposes as one that the \nvictim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking believes is safe. The VAWA statute \nspecifies that the unit to which a housing provider transfers a victim, under an emergency transfer request, is to be \navailable and safe. Accordingly, HUD is not removing reference to the unit being \u201csafe\u201d from the regulations. \nHousing providers do not have to guarantee safety, but should do their best to identify an available unit that the \nvictim considers safe.\n \n\n  Rule Change: Section 5.2005(e)(1) of this final rule is revised to state that for purposes of VAWA emergency \ntransfers, a safe unit refers to a unit that the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or \nstalking believes is safe.\n \n  Comment: Units should be left vacant for a period of time. A commenter stated that units should remain vacant for \na reasonable period of time after the victim has moved because the perpetrator may not know that the victim \nmoved, thus endangering a new resident.\n\n\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD declines to require housing providers to keep units vacant for a period of time after a victim \nhas moved from a unit. Consistent with program requirements, housing providers may choose to leave units vacant \nif they believe that will be in the best interest of the property's residents, but HUD is not requiring housing providers \ntake this action.\n \n\n  Comment: Clarify that \u201cemergency transfer\u201d applies only to truly emergency situations. Commenters stated that \nHUD's rule should be clear that an emergency transfer should be in response to an imminent danger, where \nremoval of the victim from the victim's current residence is necessary for the victim's safety. Commenter also stated \nthat the proposed rule referred to an emergency transfer being authorized in the case of sexual assault that \noccurred within 90 days of the date of the request, but a 90-day delay seems inconsistent with the common \nunderstanding of the word \u201cemergency.\u201d\n \n\n  HUD Response: VAWA 2013 provides that tenants are allowed to transfer if they expressly request the transfer \nand reasonably believe they are threatened with imminent harm from further violence if they remain within the \nsame dwelling unit; or in the case of a tenant who is a victim of sexual assault, the sexual assault occurred on the \npremises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the request for transfer. This rule tracks these statutorily \nrequired conditions.\n \n  Comment: The proposed rule and notice of rights and model emergency transfer plan should guarantee the ability \nto transfer that is provided in VAWA 2013. Commenters stated that the rule and associated documents should be \nrevised to require covered housing providers to transfer tenants who are victims under VAWA to another unit in any \ncovered housing program, instead of only requiring covered housing providers to transfer such tenants to a unit \nunder the control of the covered housing provider and assisted under the same covered program.\n \n  Commenters further stated that the permissive language in the rule, notice, and model emergency transfer plan \nthat emergency transfers may occur if a tenant is eligible for housing in the unit to which the tenant would be \ntransferred should be changed to mandatory language that emergency transfers shall occur if a tenant is eligible for \nhousing. A commenter suggested that the rule should be revised to eliminate provisions that a transfer is contingent \non if such transfer is permissible under applicable program regulations and that waiting lists or tenant preferences \nor prioritization must be considered. The commenter stated that these changes are necessary because the text, \npurpose, and legislative history of VAWA 2013 require that, under the statutory emergency transfer provisions, a \ntransfer must be provided to an available and safe unit under any covered housing program. The commenter stated \nthat the text of VAWA requires agencies to adopt a model plan that allows tenants to transfer to another available \nand safe unit that is assisted under \u201ca\u201d and not \u201cthe\u201d covered housing program.\n \n\n  HUD Response: As was discussed previously in response to an earlier comment, this rule does not require that \ncovered housing providers transfer tenants who are victims of domestic violence to another unit in any HUD-\ncovered housing program. A tenant who moves to a unit covered under a different housing program or a different \nprovider would be a new applicant, and not a transferee, and certain application procedures would need to be \nfollowed. In addition, VAWA does not override the eligibility or occupancy requirements of the different covered \nprograms. Therefore, a transfer cannot disregard the eligibility or occupancy requirements of the different covered \nhousing programs, unless the authorities governing an individual covered program allow those eligibility and \noccupancy requirements to be set aside or waived under certain circumstances. The specific eligibility requirements \nin program-specific statutes still apply, and housing providers must comply with those requirements. HUD therefore \nmaintains the provision in the proposed rule that emergency transfer requirements do not supersede any eligibility \nor other occupancy requirements that may apply under a covered housing program.\n \n\n\n\n  HUD is committed to developing ways to facilitate emergency transfers among different providers and different \ncovered housing programs, and will continually examine ways to improve the efficacy of the current policies. For \nexample, HUD will examine the variations in eligibility requirements and strive to identify those programs that have \neligibility requirements that are comparable but not identical to see if HUD can develop a \u201cfast-track\u201d admission \nprocess, so to speak, for facilitating a tenant of one HUD-covered program and who is a victim of a VAWA crime to \nquickly meet the eligibility requirements of another HUD-covered program. Further, HUD is considering developing \na model \u201ccollaborative\u201d emergency plan in which covered housing providers in a given area work together and \ncommit to aid one another in finding available safe units for their tenants who are victims of domestic violence.\n \n\n  HUD encourages housing providers to assist those who qualify for emergency transfers under VAWA to expedite \napplications for new housing units, in situations where a new application would be required, and to explain such \nmeasures in their emergency transfer plans. To facilitate adoption of this proposal, this rule revises the standards \nfor PHA tenant selection criteria in public housing to state that PHAs may accept and use a prior covered housing \nprovider's determination of eligibility and tenant screening and verification information so that victims of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking who qualify for emergency transfers under VAWA can move \nmore quickly. HUD notes that portability procedures for the Housing Choice Voucher Program in 24 CFR \n982.355(c)(7) already state that when a family moves under portability to an area outside the initial PHA's \njurisdiction, the initial PHA must promptly notify the receiving PHA to expect the family, and the initial PHA must \ngive the receiving PHA the most recent form HUD 50058 (Family Report) for the family, and all related verification \ninformation.\n \n\n  Rule Change: This rule revises 24 CFR 960.203 to include a provision that, in cases of requests for emergency \ntransfers under VAWA, with the written consent of the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, \nor stalking, the receiving PHA may accept and use the prior covered housing provider's determination of eligibility \nand tenant screening and all related verification information, including form HUD 50058 (Family Report).\n \n\n  Comment: Housing providers should work with victims to ensure they are placed in a housing unit. Commenters \nsaid that emergency homeless shelters are not viable, long-term alternatives for re-housing domestic violence \nsurvivors, and a survivor and their affiliated individuals should be placed in a housing unit whenever possible. \nCommenters said if housing is not available at the time that the victim seeks to move, housing providers should \ndemonstrate they are immediately and continually working to find new housing for survivors.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD agrees with commenter that emergency homeless shelters may provide immediate \naccommodation but are not long-term alternatives for rehousing anyone who needs housing. Victims who are \neligible for emergency transfers should be moved to a safe housing unit if one is available as soon as possible. The \nrequirement to transfer victims, who seek to move from their unit, does not end at a specific time, but remains until \nthe victim, who requested the transfer, informs the housing provider that the victim no longer seeks the transfer, or \nthe victim, no longer receives housing or housing assistance through a covered housing program.\n \n  Comment: Clarify that transfers will not be guaranteed, especially to a particular site. A commenter said language \nin HUD's model emergency transfer plan that the housing provider cannot guarantee that a transfer request will be \napproved or how long it will take to process a transfer request should be reiterated and emphasized repeatedly so \nthat tenants fully understand this is not a guarantee. Other commenters said plans and guidelines should not \nsuggest that a tenant will be transferred to a specific site, and the family should accept an appropriate unit. A \ncommenter said it has experienced residents trying to use emergency transfer procedures to get into a specific site.\n \n\n  HUD Response: The language in the model emergency transfer plan stating that the housing provider cannot \nguarantee that a transfer request will be approved or how long it will take to process is sufficient. Having said that \n\n\n\nhowever, because it is an emergency transfer plan required by VAWA 2013, the expectation is that housing \nproviders address every emergency transfer request as an emergency and move as expeditiously as possible to \nplace the victim of domestic violence in a safe unit, either one that is in the housing provider's control, or one that is \nmade available by the network of support that HUD encourages every housing provider to establish. Protecting \nvictims of domestic violence should be a collaborative effort of the public sector and private sector in every \ncommunity.\n \n\n  As for the safety issue, housing providers may add in their own emergency transfer plans additional language \nnoting the inability to guarantee the safety of a specific unit or site. It is also important to note that although housing \nproviders may believe that they have identified a safe unit, the housing provider may not force victims of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking to transfer to a site where the victim does not feel safe. Such \na move would not be a transfer to a \u201csafe\u201d unit in accordance with VAWA 2013 and HUD's final rule.\n \n  Comment: Provide for appeals if a tenant is denied a transfer. A commenter said that when a tenant is denied a \ntransfer under VAWA, or offered an unsafe unit, the tenant seeking the transfer must have the ability to challenge \nthe action irrespective of the particular covered housing program. The commenter said all transfer denials should be \nin writing and explain the basis for the denial of the housing transfer and, if the transfer is not granted within 72 \nhours, the tenant can assume it has been denied and grieve or appeal the decision.\n \n\n  HUD Response: Tenants will be made aware of their rights regarding emergency transfers through the Notice of \nOccupancy Rights, and as described in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e), tenants will have the right to review their housing \nprovider's emergency transfer plan. A tenant should feel free to ask to talk to their housing provider about any \nprovision of the emergency transfer for which the tenant may have questions. If a victim feels that there has been \nan unfair denial of an emergency transfer and is unable to resolve this situation with their housing provider, the \nvictim should contact HUD.\n \n  Comment: Explain whether there are limitations to transfers. A commenter asked how often a covered housing \nprovider must transfer a victim and whether it matters if the need for a subsequent transfer results from the victim \ninforming the perpetrator of where the victim lives. The commenter also asked, if there are multiple victims in a \nhousehold, is there is any limit to the number of transfers that must occur if different household members request \ntransfers.\n \n\n  HUD Response: Housing providers may not deny transfers to a safe and available unit if the transfer is necessary \nbecause a perpetrator learned of the victim's new location, regardless of how the perpetrator learned of the \nlocation. In addition, housing providers may not limit transfers based on the number of household members who \nrequest transfers, provided the victims meet the statutory requirements for an emergency transfer.\n <h5>\n  i. Emergency Transfer Logistics</h5>\n \n  Comment: Explain how emergency transfers will work, particularly when a housing provider does not have other \navailable and safe units or cannot afford the transfer. Commenters asked how a small PHA could transfer a victim if \nit does not have another safe unit and there are no other forms of assistance available. Commenters asked whether \nHUD has considered alternative ways to fund transfers other than tenant protection vouchers, if these are not \navailable. Another commenter said that HUD should consider what resources it can provide to victims when \nhousing providers are not able to accommodate a transfer request based on the availability of units under their \ncontrol. Another commenter asked whether, if a PHA bifurcates a lease and offers an emergency transfer, the PHA \nwill be penalized if it cannot grant a transfer for lack of funding.\n \n\n\n\n  Commenters said that it is particularly important to recognize the differing characteristics, roles and capabilities of \nvarious housing providers and property types. Commenters said that, while a PHA may be able to relocate tenants \nupon request, private property owners and managers are generally not in a position to transfer tenants or assist \ntenants in making alternative housing choices. A commenter said emergency transfer provisions should \nacknowledge the limitations of transfer policies and reflect the practical realities of the rental housing sector. \nAnother commenter said that it can provide a voucher, if funding is available, to accommodate an emergency \ntransfer request from one of its public housing units, but, due to different eligibility criteria, it cannot readily transfer \npublic housing families to its project-based Section 8 properties.\n \n  Another commenter said that if the housing provider does not have a unit available under another covered \nprogram it administers, then the housing provider should make a referral to the appropriate agency administering \nHCV vouchers so that the victim may be provided with a voucher. A commenter said HUD should develop rules and \nprocedures for the agency administering vouchers to accept referrals from covered housing providers in the \nagency's area to streamline the process and reduce the time in which a victim receives a tenant protection voucher. \nThe commenter also said housing providers should make referrals to other local or regional housing providers when \nno appropriate units are immediately available.\n \n  A commenter asked what recourse an owner has in the event that a VAWA victim declines to move to the \nproposed transfer unit. Another commenter said a tenant's rejection of the proposed transfer cannot serve as a \nbasis for good cause termination of assistance or lease termination.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD has addressed similar comments already in this preamble. HUD recognizes the challenges \nof finding available units in its covered housing programs. Waiting lists are long and units are not available in \nabundance. If there is no safe and available unit to which a victim can transfer, then the housing provider will not be \nable to provide an emergency transfer, but as also stated earlier in this preamble, VAWA requires each housing \nprovider to develop and issue an emergency transfer plan. The emergency nature of such a plan must be taken \nseriously. HUD has acknowledged the limitation of available units in all of HUD's covered housing programs, which \nis why HUD has encouraged emergency transfer plans that are in consultation with and work in collaboration with \nother public and private organizations and entities that are dedicated to helping victims of domestic violence. HUD \nalso encourages housing providers to reach out to other housing providers in their jurisdiction, and strive to \nestablish a relationship in which the housing providers, whether private market providers or government-assisted \nproviders, help one another to the extent feasible address emergency domestic violence situations. Reference to \nsuch other resources in an emergency transfer plan reflects that the plan is designed to facilitate a transfer as \nquickly as possible. The purpose of a lease bifurcation is to remove the perpetrator from a unit without evicting, \nremoving, terminating assistance to, or otherwise penalizing a victim who seeks to remain in the unit. The purpose \nof an emergency transfer is to transfer a victim to a unit away from the perpetrator where the victim feels safe. An \nemergency transfer is not required as a result of a lease bifurcation.\n \n  With respect to the question of what recourse is available to an owner in the event that a VAWA victim declines to \nmove to a proposed transfer unit, there is no HUD program where a tenant's rejection of a proposed transfer in \naccordance with \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e) would serve as a basis for good cause termination of a lease.\n \n  Comment: Housing providers should consider units with different ownership for emergency transfers. Commenters \nsaid HUD must make clear to housing providers that management entities have the option of considering units with \ndifferent ownership and that individual HAP contracts, or ownership distinctions, are not unmovable barriers to \ntransfers.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD agrees with commenters and emphasizes that housing providers should consider, for \nemergency transfer requests, safe and available units with different ownership where such a transfer is feasible, \nand adheres to statutory requirements that may govern the transfer.\n\n\n\n \n  Comment: Housing providers should only be required to consider units that are under their control and that are \npart of the same housing program in which the victim participates. Commenters said allowing transfers to other \nhousing programs would open the door to abuse as many might use this as a way to circumvent long waiting lists \nfor their program of choice. Another commenter said various program limitations, including funding considerations, \nvoucher availability, and fairness concerns in waiting list administration, may limit a provider's flexibility in \ntransferring a victim from one of its programs to the other, and the rule should state that a housing provider is not \nrequired to transfer a victim to a different covered housing program it operates or administers.\n \n\n  HUD Response: As previously discussed, under this final rule, covered housing providers must allow tenants to \ntransfer to units that are available and safe when the tenant may reside in the new unit without having to undergo \nan application process. This means that transfers will not be required to units outside of a provider's control and in a \ndifferent program. However, as also previously discussed in greater depth, this final rule requires housing providers \nto establish procedures in their emergency transfer plan for transferring tenants who qualify for an emergency \ntransfer under VAWA when the provider does not have a safe and available unit for which the tenant requesting the \ntransfer can immediately transfer. HUD believes these requirements ensure that emergency transfer plans seriously \nconsider the needs of victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, and have \nmeasures in place to assist such victims, while giving housing providers flexibility as to how they will be best able \nhandle VAWA emergency transfer requests.\n \n  As provided in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e)(12) of this final rule, and already stated in this preamble, emergency transfer \nobligations do not supersede any eligibility or other occupancy requirements that may apply under a covered \nhousing program. Housing providers are strongly encouraged to accept emergency transfers from different housing \nproviders, as long as all program requirements that affect the transfer, those applicable to the housing provider \nseeking assistance and those applicable to the housing provider willing to accept the tenant, are followed.\n \n  Comment: HUD should issue tenant protection vouchers and establish policies and procedures related to tenant \nprotection vouchers. Commenters asked that HUD issue tenant protection vouchers to assist victims of VAWA \ncrimes. A commenter asked that these vouchers be issued with reference to PHA size and to the number of \nemergency transfers issued during the immediately preceding fiscal year. A commenter said such vouchers give \nvictims the ability to transfer to a unit in another jurisdiction, where they may feel there is greater safety. A \ncommenter said that it is unlikely other HUD-funded units will be available for emergency transfers, and HUD \nshould provide vouchers to jurisdictions that do not have extra vouchers, although this could lead to false \nallegations of victimization. Other commenters asked HUD to encourage its Congressional appropriators to \nincrease funding for tenant protection vouchers and/or to encourage a separate set-aside of vouchers for victims of \nVAWA crimes.\n \n  Commenters said that, under VAWA 2013, HUD is required to establish policies and procedures for how victims \nrequesting an emergency transfer may receive tenant protection vouchers, subject to their availability. Commenters \nstated that the proposed rule did not provide policies and procedures for these vouchers, and said it makes sense \nto spell out a policy for these vouchers in the context of HUD's model emergency transfer plan.\n \n\n  HUD Response: The fiscal year 2016 appropriations for HUD does not provide funding specifically for tenant \nprotection vouchers for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. If future \nappropriations provide funding for tenant protection vouchers for victims of VAWA crimes, HUD will issue policies \nand procedures for the provision and use of the vouchers.\n \n  Comment: The rule should define \u201csafe and available\u201d and explain who determines whether a unit is safe and \navailable. Commenters asked that HUD provide a definition of \u201csafe\u201d and \u201cavailable.\u201d Commenter said a definition of \n\u201csafe\u201d would allow housing providers to document that they reasonably met this standard and limit their vulnerability \n\n\n\nto litigation. A commenter said that the definition of a \u201csafe dwelling unit\u201d should take into account the realities of \ntribal and rural housing agencies that cannot predict vacancies.\n \n  Commenters emphasized that a \u201csafe\u201d dwelling unit could be defined as a unit in a different property, stating that a \nunit in the same property would not be safe, and a unit in an adjacent property may not be safe. A commenter \nsuggested a safe unit be defined as a unit in a different property that is managed by the same owner and/or \nmanaging agent or that is within the same assisted housing program. A commenter said that in some situations, \ntransferring to a different unit within the property may be helpful, but may not be sufficient for every situation. \nAnother commenter said the unit should be inspected to ensure that all locks are in good working order, and the \ntenant should be permitted, at the tenant's expense, to add additional locks. Commenters further said the definition \nshould include that the location of the safe unit will not be disclosed to the perpetrator by either the housing provider \nor anyone in the victim's household.\n \n  A commenter suggested that a \u201csafe\u201d unit should refer to the existing definition in 24 CFR 5.703, regarding \nphysical condition standards for HUD housing, and if the resident declines the offer to transfer because the only \navailable unit is next door to the tenant's current unit, then HUD must take the leading role in helping the resident \nfind new housing. Another commenter stated that any unit receiving subsidy is subject to HUD's prevailing physical \ninspection standards. A commenter said a \u201csafe\u201d unit should be defined based on objective criteria and should not \nimpose unrealistic requirements, and housing providers should be allowed to adopt additional transfer guidelines to \nenhance safety (such as neighborhood restrictions).\n \n\n  Other commenters said that the consideration of what is a \u201csafe\u201d dwelling unit should be determined by the tenant \nwho is requesting the transfer, based on the tenant's personal knowledge and reasonable belief about what areas \nof the city, or what developments, would be safe for the tenant. Commenters said that establishing both physical \nand psychological safety can be a critical factor for survivors to recover from violence they experienced.\n \n  A commenter suggested that an \u201cavailable\u201d dwelling unit can be defined as a vacant unit of appropriate unit size, \nlocated in a different apartment complex that is covered by VAWA protections and is managed by the same owner \nand/or managing agent. A commenter said the word \u201cavailable\u201d refers to a subsidized unit under the same program \nand under the control of the provider. Another commenter said the definition of \u201cavailable\u201d should encompass any \nunits owned or managed by the housing provider even if the unit is under a different program.\n \n  Another commenter asked if \u201cavailable\u201d has a specific time period as to when the unit will be available. Other \ncommenters said \u201cavailable\u201d means that all options must be explored for finding a safe and available unit, in and \noutside of the covered housing program's control or program before denying a transfer request.\n \n\n  Commenters said that, overall, criteria to be considered as to what is a safe and available dwelling unit are: \nExpressed safety concerns; availability of safe housing, as determined by these concerns, within the housing \nproviders' control; the availability of safe housing of the same covered housing program type; and availability of safe \nhousing of a different covered housing program type. Other commenters said that the rule's provision that available \nand safe dwelling units are those controlled by the provider with the same form of assistance as the prior unit \nsufficiently avoid undue burdens on providers while offering domestic violence victims reasonable opportunities to \ntransfer. A commenter said that while it is administratively easier to remain in the covered program, HUD should \nprovide guidance and tools on how providers could look to possible units across their portfolio and also across \nprograms to help providers understand when such moves could be feasible and allowed. A commenter asked that \nthe rule state that a PHA may use its discretion to determine what \u201cavailable and safe dwelling units\u201d means.\n \n  Another commenter asked that, in situations where a tenant is transferred to a different unit under a different \ncovered housing provider, which covered housing provider will be expected to fulfill the VAWA responsibility of \ndetermining a unit as \u201csafe.\u201d\n\n\n\n \n  A commenter asked that Section 504-modified apartments otherwise reserved for households with a mobility-\nimpaired individual, not be considered \u201cavailable\u201d to those seeking a transfer under VAWA.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD declines to set a specific standard for what is \u201csafe,\u201d as the meaning of this term may vary \ngreatly in different situations. HUD agrees with commenters who said that what is a \u201csafe\u201d dwelling unit should be \nprimarily determined by the tenant-victim who is requesting the transfer, based on the tenant's personal knowledge \nand reasonable belief about what is safe. HUD believes that limiting \u201csafe\u201d to physical condition standards, as \nsuggested by some commenters, is too limiting and is contrary to the intent of VAWA. Program regulations and \npolicies for physical condition standards will still apply for emergency transfers, in the same manner that they apply \nto other housing under those programs. What is a \u201csafe\u201d distance from a perpetrator is one factor that housing \nproviders and victims may consider, but HUD again declines to provide a specific definition of the term \u201csafe\u201d that \nwould exclude certain units, such as those within the same property, or include other units, such as those at \ndifferent properties.\n \n  Similarly, what is an \u201cavailable\u201d unit will vary in different situations. Generally, an available unit is one that is not \noccupied and is available to tenants given program requirements and possible considerations that may be \napplicable, such as eligibility requirements, unit restrictions, or term limitations. HUD will assist housing providers in \nidentifying available units under the different HUD programs covered by VAWA.\n \n  HUD's Section 504 implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8 describe the process by which accessible units \nrequired to be accessible under HUD's Section 504 regulation must be occupied. In order to maximize the utilization \nof such units by eligible individuals who require the accessibility features of the particular unit, the housing owner or \nmanager must first offer such a unit to a current occupant of another unit of the same project or comparable \nprojects under common control who needs the accessibility features of the vacant unit, and then to an eligible \nqualified individual on the waiting list needing such features. After this, the owner or manager may then offer the \nunit to individuals without disabilities, including individuals who need an emergency transfer under VAWA. In other \nwords, if there remains a vacant accessible unit after engaging in this priority placement, the unit would qualify as \nan available unit for an emergency transfer under VAWA.\n \n  Comment: Housing owners and managers, not participating jurisdictions or State agencies, will have control over \nproperty and be in the best position to determine whether an emergency transfer is warranted. Commenters said \nthat, in most cases, participating jurisdictions will not have control over housing for which HOME funds have been \nprovided, and the rule needs to be clear about how a covered housing provider's control of property establishes the \nprovider's responsibility to provide alternative housing when a transfer is needed. A commenter stated that \n\u00a7&thinsp;92.359(e) in the proposed rule requires the participating jurisdiction to develop a VAWA lease \nterm/addendum that must permit the tenant to terminate the lease without penalty if the participating jurisdiction \u201cor \nits designee\u201d determines that the tenant has met the conditions for an emergency transfer. The commenter said \nparticipating jurisdictions are not in a position to evaluate and make timely judgments about a tenant's eligibility for \nan emergency transfer and asked that participating jurisdictions be permitted to designate the owner of HOME-\nassisted rental housing as the entity that determines whether a tenant has met the conditions for an emergency \ntransfer.\n \n  Commenters said HUD's interpretation of \u201cunder a covered housing program\u201d is reasonable and fair if applied only \nto an owner of a property, and noted that a state housing agency administering project-based section 8 under 24 \nCFR part 883 does not \u201ccontrol\u201d assisted units, nor does a HOME participating jurisdiction. Commenter said this \nnotion of control should be explicitly stated in the regulatory text.\n \n\n  HUD Response: This final rule maintains the provisions in the proposed rule that the participating jurisdiction is \nthe covered housing provider for purposes of developing and issuing an emergency transfer plan. The final rule also \n\n\n\niterates that the participating jurisdiction must determine whether a tenant qualifies for an emergency transfer under \nthe plan, as provided under the proposed rule. Individual project owners, however, will be involved in implementing \nthe emergency transfer plan, including at a minimum transferring tenants to other units as provided in the \nemergency transfer plan and the written agreements required under section 92.504. The final rule includes changes \nto reflect this owner involvement. In this final rule, HUD removes language that was in the proposed rule's HOME \nregulations about the participating jurisdiction's designee. The HOME regulations do not discuss a participating \njurisdiction's designee. Section 92.504(a) of the HOME regulations explains how a participating jurisdiction can \ncarry out its program. HUD also removes language about a participating jurisdiction or its designee from the \nproposed HTF regulations, as the HTF regulations in 24 CFR part 93 place responsibilities on a \u201cgrantee.\u201d In this \nfinal rule, the HTF regulations for VAWA explain the responsibilities of grantees and owners, rather than \nparticipating jurisdictions, or their designees, and owners.\n \n  More generally, as explained earlier, this final rule no longer uses the term control to describe which units \nindividuals may transfer to, and instead uses defined terms, internal emergency transfer and external emergency \ntransfer, to describe transfer possibilities.\n \n  Rule Change: Section 92.359 of this final rule discusses VAWA responsibilities in the HOME program only for \nowners and participating jurisdictions. Section 93.356 of this final rule discusses VAWA responsibilities in the HTF \nprogram only for owners and grantees.\n \n  Comment: Any required recertification should only occur after a tenant has been transferred. Commenters said \nHUD should clarify that any required recertification, for example due to the change in household composition if the \nperpetrator no longer lives in the unit, should occur only after the tenant has been transferred. A commenter said \nthat the covered housing provider would, however, be free to change the size of the unit, if unit size eligibility is \naltered.\n \n\n  HUD Response: This rule does not impose any new requirements regarding recertification. Existing program \nregulations and policies govern.\n \n  Comment: Residents should be allowed to transfer without losing their subsidy. Commenters suggested that \nwhere there is no \u201csafe and available\u201d unit subsidized under the same covered program and under the \nadministration of the tenant's current housing provider, but a unit is available in a separate property or in another \nproperty where the provider has made an agreement with the other property's housing owner, then the transfer \nshould be accomplished through a negotiated \u201ctermination, or move out\u201d and priority \u201cmove-in\u201d at another site. A \ncommenter said this could be accomplished using Tenant Rental Assistance Certification System (TRACS) \ndatabase codes that will not require establishing new eligibility, but will enable a transfer of subsidy to another \nproperty so that the tenant will not have to risk loss of subsidy by having to meet income limits as required for a \nfirst-time eligibility determination.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates the suggestions of these commenters. Because HUD is unable to provide \nregulatory text that will address every feasible scenario, HUD program offices will supplement the regulatory text on \nhow specific fact scenarios should be addressed under the requirements of the HUD-covered program at issue.\n \n  Comment: Residents requesting emergency transfer should be offered a reasonable time to establish eligibility for \nother programs. A commenter recommended that HUD provide a victim seeking an emergency transfer a \nreasonable time period, consistent with lease bifurcation provisions, to establish eligibility for other covered housing \nprograms.\n \n\n\n\n  HUD Response: In this rule, HUD declines to set a time period for victims seeking emergency transfers to \nestablish eligibility for other programs. In the case of bifurcation, the reasonable time period applies so that tenants \nmay be protected from immediate eviction when a perpetrator leaves a unit. In the case of tenants requesting \nemergency transfers under VAWA, the tenant is not facing eviction, and although it may be unsafe for tenants to \nremain in their units, emergency transfers are subject to whether there is a safe and available unit to which the \ntenant may transfer. As discussed earlier in this preamble, the requirement to transfer victims who qualify for and \nrequest an emergency transfer does not end at a specific time, but remains until the victim informs the housing \nprovider that the victim no longer seeks the transfer, or the victim no longer receives housing or assistance under a \ncovered housing program. As also stated earlier in this preamble, tenants seeking emergency transfers may apply \nfor housing under a new program, but emergency transfer obligations under VAWA do not supersede any eligibility \nor other occupancy requirements that may apply under a covered housing program.\n \n  Comment: Tenants should generally remain responsible for rent while temporarily relocated. A commenter said it \nhas been its practice that, for all emergency transfers, the tenant remains responsible for the rent of its unit during \nthe period of the tenant's temporary relocation. The commenter said any mitigating circumstance to having the \ntenant remain responsible for the rent during temporary relocation would be addressed on a case-by-case basis to \nensure that the victim does not lose eligibility for continued housing assistance.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates the commenter's suggestion on how the commenter handles emergency \ntransfers. This final rule does not set requirements for recovery of lost rent for tenants who may be temporarily \nrelocated. The program regulations that apply to the covered housing govern who bears the cost of lost rent.\n \n  Comment: Explain whether a housing provider can terminate assistance to a perpetrator when an emergency \ntransfer happens. Commenters asked whether management can terminate assistance to the perpetrator. A \ncommenter asked if termination is permitted whether the termination would take place when the emergency transfer \nhappens or when the victim asserts a VAWA crime has been committed.\n \n\n  HUD Response: Housing providers that seek to terminate assistance to a perpetrator or an alleged perpetrator \nmust ensure they are following existing program regulations and policies, including lease policies, which allow for \nsuch termination, as well as any applicable state and local laws. Housing providers should also ensure that tenants \nare aware that commission of crimes under VAWA may result in termination.\n \n  Comment: HUD should work with other organizations and agencies to transfer victims. Commenters stated that \nHUD needs to make use of available local and State resources for emergency transfer, and suggested that contacts \nbe made with local shelters that house VAWA victims, as well as sheriffs' offices that have relationships with \nshelters, for advice and direction. Commenters stated that tenants should be informed of these resources and \nassistance should be provided to tenants to use these resources, if a tenant becomes a victim of a VAWA crime. \nCommenters stressed the importance of sharing the personal information of tenants only when necessary and then \nonly to protect the victim.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates the suggestion of working with other organizations experienced in helping \nvictims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, to help facilitate transfers to a safe \nlocation or to provide a safe location for victims. In this final rule, HUD requires emergency transfer plans to \ndescribe policies to assist a tenant to make an emergency move when a safe unit is not immediately available for \ntransfer, and encourages policies that include outreach activities to organizations that assist or provide resources to \nvictims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. As to sharing personal information, this \nfinal rule maintains the provisions in the proposed rule that emergency transfer plans must incorporate strict \nconfidentiality measures, and HUD's model emergency plan contains a section on confidentiality that specifies that \nthe housing provider will keep confidential any information that the victim submits about an emergency transfer \n\n\n\nunless the victim gives the housing provider written permission to release the information or disclosure is required \nby law.\n \n\n  Comment: HUD and housing providers should take proactive steps to implement emergency transfer plans. \nCommenters said HUD should oversee and ensure accountability for each covered housing program's emergency \ntransfer plan. Commenters said tenants seeking transfers may be directed differently depending on the covered \nhousing program and covered housing provider, and suggested that HUD Regional offices could lead transfer \nefforts within their area, similar to efforts undertaken by HUD's Chicago Multifamily Regional Office. HUD's Chicago \nRegional Multifamily Office help to facilitate transfers needed by victims of domestic violence by helping to identify \nvacancies and striving to have the transfer occur between 48 hours and 2 weeks depending upon the victim's need \nand the availability of safe units.  (12)  Commenter said HUD multifamily field offices, PHAs, or the contract \nadministrator can assist in identifying assisted housing within different properties. Commenters also said HUD \nshould encourage PHAs to work regionally to identify available units.\n \n  Other commenters said HUD can provide guidance to covered housing programs so that emergency transfer \npolicies are institutionalized and implemented at all levels of the agency and survive employee turnover. \nCommenters said housing agencies should take measures to shorten transfer wait times, and to give survivors \nspecific timeframes on when they can expect to be transferred. Commenters cited an example of a transfer policy \nthat is working is from the Philadelphia Housing Authority. Commenters further suggested said that HUD encourage \nregional planning for emergency transfers and regional cooperative agreements or working groups between various \nhousing providers of different housing programs and victim advocates.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates the information on how certain HUD offices and PHAs have addressed \nemergency transfer situations, and such information will aid HUD in development of guidance and best practices.\n \n  Comment: HUD needs to better explain how emergency transfers will work for the HCV program. A commenter \nsaid that HUD's discussion of emergency transfers in conjunction with the HCV program's portability feature \noversimplifies the issues faced by the covered provider administering the HCV program and needs further \nexplanation. The commenter said HUD conflates a tenant's use of portability (moving with assistance between \njurisdictions) and moving from one housing unit to another in the same jurisdiction. The commenter said the rule \nindicates that a provider may not terminate assistance if a family leaves subsidized privately owned housing without \nnotifying the PHA. The commenter asked if this means that a PHA may not terminate assistance based on the \nfamily moving out of the unit without notice to the PHA that may consider such a move as a material violation of the \nlease and pursue remedies such as recovering costs for reoccupying the unit from the former tenant.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD's HCV program regulations at 24 CFR 982.353(b) provide an exception to the prohibition \nagainst a family moving under portability provisions in violation of the lease. This exception provides that if the \nfamily has complied with all other obligations of the voucher program and has moved out of the assisted dwelling \nunit in order to protect the health or safety of a household member who is or has been the a victim of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking and who reasonably believes the household member to be \nthreatened with imminent harm from further violence by remaining in the dwelling unit (or if any family member has \nbeen the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the \nfamily's move or request to move), and has otherwise complied with all other obligations under the Section 8 \nprogram, the family may receive a voucher from the initial PHA and move to another jurisdiction under the HCV \nProgram.\n \n\n  For example, a program participant is a victim of dating violence and moves out of the assisted dwelling unit and \ninto an emergency shelter because the victim reasonably believes to be threatened with imminent harm from further \n\n\n\nviolence by remaining in the unit. The victim fails to promptly notify the PHA of the absence in violation of the \nPHA's policy on absence from the unit. The PHA determines that the victim has violated PHA policy on absence \nfrom a unit. The PHA undertakes proceedings to terminate assistance and terminates the Housing Assistance \nPayment (HAP) contract with the owner. The program participant also notifies the PHA that the program participant \nis a victim of dating violence and moved out of the unit because the program participant reasonably believes to be \nthreatened with imminent harm from further violence by remaining in the dwelling unit. The PHA makes a written \nrequest to the program participant to submit documentation about the incident or incidents of dating violence. In \nresponse to the request, a Certification of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking is \nsubmitted to the PHA. Because the absence from the unit was a result of domestic violence, dating violence, \nsexual assault, or stalking and the victim reasonably believed to be threatened with imminent harm from further \nviolence by remaining in the dwelling unit, the PHA halts proceedings to terminate assistance. The PHA would then \nissue a new voucher allowing the program participant to search for housing. If the program participant indicates the \ndesire to move to an area outside of the PHA's jurisdiction, the PHA follows the provisions for portability under 24 \nCFR 982.355. The program participant moves to the jurisdiction of another PHA with continued assistance. This \nmove, however, does not relieve the family of any financial obligations on the original lease.\n <h5>\n  4. Documentation and Verifications</h5>\n \n  Comment: Clarify what forms are required for implementation of VAWA. Commenters requested information about \nforms required for non-project-based section 8 households to use VAWA. Another commenter asked whether \nhousing providers have discretion to determine documentation requirements.\n \n\n  HUD Response: Except for documentation for emergency transfers, as previously discussed, documentation \nprovisions and requirements are set out in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2007 of this rule, and reflect the statutory documentation \nprovisions in VAWA 2013. Housing providers must accept any one of the forms of documentation listed in \n\u00a7&thinsp;5.2007, at the discretion of the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. \nUnder the statute and this rule, housing providers may accept another form of documentation provided by the \napplicant or the tenant, but the provider must still accept all of the other forms of documentation described in the \nrule. In the case of conflicting evidence, housing providers must accept one of the three forms of third-party \ndocumentation described in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2007.\n \n  Comment: Certification forms should not differ for different programs. Commenters said there should be one \nVAWA certification form, and the exact same form should be used by both Public and Indian Housing and \nMultifamily Housing, because using different forms, which may expire or be changed at different times, is confusing \nand unnecessary.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD agrees and has created a certification form that will be used for all covered programs.\n \n  Comment: The 14-day time period should not strictly apply to all third-party documentation requirements in cases \nof conflicting evidence. Commenters stated that some VAWA victims may not be able to acquire the proper \ndocumentation within 14 business days. Commenters suggested there be a longer period of time for victims to be \nable to provide third-party documentation. A commenter said this is especially important in large cities where there \nis often a waiting period for supportive services. Another commenter said law enforcement, court, or administrative \nagency records can take a long time to obtain, as could medical documentation from a hospital. The commenter \nrecommended that 60 days is a more reasonable period to obtain such documentation. Commenters said HUD \nshould consider adding language to address what should occur when a tenant seeks requested documentation but \ncannot obtain the documentation due to a nonresponsive third party. A commenter said that if the tenant tries, but \ncannot procure the requested information, the housing provider should be instructed to make a decision based on \nthe available evidence.\n \n\n\n\n  Commenters said that when victims are fleeing or have fled abuse, they can lack access to records and it can take \ntime to understand their legal rights when information is shared. The commenters recommended that HUD allow 28 \nbusiness days from the date the written request for documentation was received to obtain third-party \ndocumentation, and allow housing providers to use their discretion to extend the deadline past 28 days.\n \n  Other commenters said that the 14-day time period should also apply to third-party documents, but the covered \nhousing provider should be able to extend this time period, particularly if the tenant demonstrates that the tenant \nhas begun the process of obtaining the third-party documentation. A commenter suggested that the victim be \nrequired to request any extension within the initial 14-day time period. Another commenter said the time period is \nappropriate with the understanding that local agencies have the discretion to set a longer locally appropriate time \nperiod and that policies governing these time periods for PHAs are subject to public review and board approval as \npart of agencies' planning processes.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD understands that some VAWA victims may not be able to acquire third-party documentation \nwithin 14 business days. Under this final rule, tenants will have 30 days\u2014generally the period of one rent cycle\u2014to \nsubmit third-party documentation in cases of conflicting evidence. Housing providers may grant extensions where \nappropriate.\n \n  Rule Change: Section 5.2007(b)(2) of the proposed rule is revised to state that, in cases of conflicting information, \ncovered housing providers may require an applicant or tenant to submit third-party documentation within 30 \ncalendar days of the date of the request for the third-party documentation.\n \n\n  Comment: The 14-day time period should apply to third-party documentation requirements. In contrast to the \nabove commenters, other commenters stated that 14 days is reasonable. A commenter stated that if an individual is \nin an unsafe situation, submission of documentation should be complete in 14 business days (or less) to ensure a \nprompt response to a request for relocation. Another commenter said that if this is a true emergency and the family \nneeds to be relocated, 10 business days, excluding holidays and weekends, should be sufficient, and if there are \nmitigating circumstances the housing provider can allow for additional days.\n \n\n  HUD Response: The third-party documentation requirements are not requirements for an emergency transfer, but \nare requirements for documenting an occurrence of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking \nwhen there is conflicting evidence.\n \n\n  Comment: Clarify that housing providers can require third-party certification when it is unclear whether domestic \nviolence occurred, or who is the victim. Commenters said that HUD's implementing guidance and forms should \nreflect that housing providers can require third-party certification when there is not clear evidence that domestic \nviolence incident occurred, or there is a question about which occupant is the victim.\n \n\n  HUD Response: This rule and HUD's Notice of Occupancy Rights that will be distributed to tenants and applicants \nboth advise that housing providers have the right to request third-party documentation in order to resolve conflicts in \nsituations where the housing providers have received conflicting evidence. With that exception, HUD does not read \nVAWA 2013 as allowing for housing providers to request third-party documentation. Housing providers should \nspeak to the victim to try and clarify any information the housing provider believes is not clear. In accordance with \nVAWA 2013, HUD declines to allow housing providers to require third-party documentation of an occurrence of \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking in any situation except for those involving conflicting \nevidence.\n \n\n\n\n  Comment: HUD should provide clarification regarding situations where housing providers receive conflicting \nevidence. Commenters said that HUD should explain that the party providing third-party documentation when two \nparties claim VAWA protections in the same incident is not automatically deemed the victim, as perpetrators \nsometimes obtain a restraining order, protective order, or file a police report as forms of continued abuse, control, or \nretaliation. A commenter said many survivors are unable to timely access courts or law enforcement due to \nlanguage barriers, disabilities, cultural norms, or safety concerns. Another commenter said that, rather than \nterminate the tenancy of the party who fails to provide third-party verification when conflicting evidence is received \nfrom both parties claiming VAWA protections, housing providers should use a grievance hearing or administrative \nreview process to determine which party is the victim to be protected by VAWA.\n \n  Another commenter said HUD should clarify protocol for addressing equally compelling and competing claims, \nincluding ones with court actions pending. The commenter said that, frequently, households with competing VAWA \nclaims also have court actions pending simultaneously and those cases may continue for years without a final \nresolution, and statuses that are apparently final can later change or have to be reconsidered.\n \n  Another commenter said situations in which cross-complainants submit conflicting third-party documentation, such \nas opposing orders of protection, create intractable situations for housing providers, which are not in a position to \nadjudicate family disputes or identify the primary aggressor. The commenter asked that HUD relieve PHAs of the \nobligation to afford VAWA protections to either complainant if documentation fails to identify a primary aggressor, or \nif third-party documents are themselves in conflict as to which complainant is the victim and which complainant is \nthe perpetrator.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates the points raised by the commenters and will consider them in drafting \nguidance to assist housing providers who receive conflicting evidence.\n \n\n  Comment: Any form of third-party documentation should be acceptable in cases where there is conflicting \nevidence. Commenters said that, based upon the proposed list of acceptable alternative documentation, victims \ncould encounter difficulty documenting evidence of a crime committed under VAWA in conflicting statement cases \nwhen, at the discretion of the covered housing provider, \u201cstatements or other evidence\u201d are not accepted, and the \nvictim is required to submit documentation from a professional or law enforcement. Commenters said that, in many \ncases, a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, or sexual assault does not report the incidents to \nlaw enforcement and may not utilize the assistance of a professional and, therefore, the only form of third-party \ndocumentation available may be witness statements or other evidence which, under the proposed regulations, may \nnot be acceptable forms of documentation if left to the discretion of the covered housing provider.\n \n\n  HUD Response: The list of acceptable third-party documentation provided in this rule is the list provided in VAWA \n2013. The statute provides that, if a covered housing provider receives documentation that contains conflicting \ninformation, the covered housing provider may require an applicant or tenant to submit third-party documentation in \none of the forms described in the statute, which are the same forms HUD describes in this rule.\n \n\n  Comment: Emphasize that survivors can choose which form of documentation to submit under the law, without \nfurther specifications. Commenters stated that the use of \u201cor\u201d in the section of VAWA 2013 that lists forms of \ndocumentation means that neither HUD nor a covered housing provider can eliminate the acceptability of one of the \nthree listed documentation forms. Another commenter said that because many victims are reluctant to report abuse \nfor fear of retaliations or other repercussions, self-certifications that the tenants are victims of domestic violence \nbased solely on their own-signed attestation on a HUD-approved certification form should be recognized as an \navailable option. Another commenter stated that, in the preamble to HUD's final rule implementing VAWA 2005, \n\n\n\nHUD asserted that victims could choose whether to submit self-certification or third-party documentation, and this \nstill applies.\n \n  Commenters stated that PHAs and project owners are demanding Orders of Protection, Harassment orders, \nTrespass Orders, or police reports, contrary to HUD's directive to PHAs and project owners that third-party \ndocumentation cannot be required. Commenter said some PHAs and project owners require documentation that is \n\u201ccurrent,\u201d such as a less than 30-day old police report. Additionally, commenters said some PHAs and project \nowners are requiring multiple forms of proof. Commenter said the regulations must be clear on this section in order \nto reduce these unlawful and onerous documentation practices, as they were in 2005.\n \n  Other commenters suggested adding to proposed \u00a7&thinsp;5.2007 language that provides that nothing should be \nconstrued to require a participant to provide documentation other than the self-certification form, except in the case \nof conflicting evidence.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates commenters pointing out that the rule could more clearly state that victims of \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking can choose, at their discretion, which form of \ndocumentation to submit, including self-certifications, except in the case of conflicting evidence. HUD has clarified \nthis is \u00a7&thinsp;5.2007, as well as in the housing rights notice, and the self-certification form.\n \n  Rule Change: Section 5.2007(b) of the proposed rule is revised in this final rule to state that applicants or tenants \nmay submit, at their discretion, any one of the listed forms of documentation.\n \n  Comment: Housing providers should not have to accept self-certification. Commenters said housing providers \nshould have discretion in determining the documentation requirements. A commenter said this is particularly the \ncase with respect to the ability for housing providers to accept self-certification and the ability to determine when \nthird-party documentation will be required, such as in instances when a housing authority receives conflicting \ninformation. The commenter said these documentation requirements can be maintained in the housing authority's \nwritten policies in order to ensure consistent application of documentation requirements. Other commenters stated \nthat housing providers should be able to create their own certification form that could be used instead of the HUD-\napproved form.\n \n\n  A commenter said relying on self-certifications to qualify applicants leaves the housing provider vulnerable to \npenalties that may be imposed as a result HUD program audits, and the imposition of penalties causes disruptions \nand delays in the program, which adversely affect the program's ability to provide services to those that need them. \nThe commenter recommended that the rule should state that responsible entities accept self-certification as a last \nresort. Another commenter said self-certification, even if supported by a police report, should not be mandated as \nsufficient proof, and that housing providers must be permitted to require third-party verification or other \ndocumentation signed by a professional from whom the victim has sought assistance directly relating to domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, or the effects of abuse. Another commenter said that the \nstatute does not establish a hierarchy of documentation, so the rule should not limit the circumstances under which \na housing provider can seek third-party documentation. A commenter said that if a program is allowed to accept \nself-certification then it is likely that parties will make an allegation, withdraw the allegation days later, and then \nmake another allegation when the relationship is challenged again. The commenter said this will generate a \nconsiderable investment of time to identify alternate housing, determine eligibility, and bifurcate the lease\u2014all to \nhave the allegation withdrawn or proven false.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates the commenters' concerns, but HUD interprets VAWA to require that housing \nproviders accept self-certification if that is the form that a tenant or applicant provides, except in cases involving \nconflicting evidence. In addition, as HUD noted in response to an earlier comment, this is not a new policy. In \n\n\n\nimplementing VAWA 2005, HUD explained that victims could choose whether to submit self-certification or third-\nparty documentation.\n \n\n  The statute also requires that HUD, or other appropriate housing agency covered under the law, approve the \ncertification form. In order to avoid inconsistent requirements, HUD declines to allow housing providers to use their \nown certification forms in lieu of HUD's form. Under VAWA 2013 and this final rule, however, housing providers may \nallow victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking to use a certification form that the \nhousing provider has created, as long as it is clear that victims do not need to use that form and can use the HUD \nform instead (again, except for cases where there is conflicting evidence).\n \n\n  Comment: Housing providers should not have discretion to evaluate truthfulness of allegations. A commenter \nstated that housing providers may not have the necessary expertise and experience to evaluate whether there is a \ncredible threat of domestic violence or other crime under VAWA that may be mitigated by a move, and training \nhousing providers to help them gain that experience could be costly. This commenter further stated that victims may \nbe reluctant to disclose their victimization to owners or management agents for a variety of reasons, including \nshame, embarrassment, or fear of retribution, and it would be more appropriate for housing providers to refer the \ntenants to their caseworkers to evaluate the truthfulness of the victim's allegations.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD understands and appreciates commenter's point that victims may be reluctant to disclose \nincidents of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking to housing providers, but the rule \nmaintains the documentation requirements that are provided in VAWA 2013. Housing providers must accept signed \nself-certification forms for documenting incidents of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, \nso they will not be evaluating the truthfulness of allegations. Similarly, as described in the section on emergency \ntransfers, housing providers must accept a signed written statement from VAWA victims that they qualify for \nemergency transfers, so housing providers will not be evaluating whether a threat of domestic violence may be \nmitigated by a move.\n \n  Comment: Housing providers should not have to request certification in writing. A commenter said it is overly \nburdensome to require the housing provider to have to put in writing a request to the victim to provide certification \nfollowing a request from the victim for assistance under VAWA. The commenter said to make this a requirement of \nhousing providers may result in unintended consequences if the provider fails to document but continues to assist \nthe victim.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD's rule follows VAWA 2013 in stating that housing providers may request documentation in \nwriting and lay out procedures for how a housing provider may respond if it does not receive a timely response to \nthe request.\n \n  Comment: Explain how housing providers can verify VAWA claims in light of confidentiality concerns. Commenters \nquestioned how, considering confidentiality concerns, a housing provider could verify a claim that an individual \nowes money to a former housing provider (for damages to a unit, for example) for VAWA-related reasons, and not \nfor another reason. A commenter asked what would happen if the applicant and previous management company \nhave different stories as to whether the money was owed for a VAWA-related reason or another reason.\n \n\n  HUD Response: As previously stated in this preamble, HUD will provide guidance to covered housing providers \nas to how to determine whether domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking was the reason \nbehind adverse factors that could jeopardize tenancy or participation in a HUD program.\n <h5>\n  5. Content of the Certification Form and the Notice of Occupancy Rights</h5>\n\n\n\n <h5>\n  a. Certification Form</h5>\n \n  Comment: The certification form should be readable and define necessary terms. Commenters said that HUD's \nincreased use of plain language and precise regulatory language throughout the proposed certification form \nsignificantly improves readability and comprehension of the rights conveyed, as compared to the previous forms. \nCommenters said these improvements should be incorporated into the final version of the certification form.\n \n  In contrast, another commenter said that the certification form is not designed to be comprehensible to applicants \nand participants, and Microsoft Office 365 Word reports a poor Flesch Readability Ease measure. The commenter \nalso said that the form uses the term \u201cresponsible entity\u201d without ever indicating who or what that entity is.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD has revised the certification form to make it easier to understand. In addition, the revised \ncertification form does not use the term \u201cresponsible entity.\u201d\n \n  Comment: The certification form should be changed in certain ways. Commenters commended HUD for \nabbreviating the space for descriptive text and discouraging disclosure of unnecessary details, but suggested the \nform should be changed in other ways. The commenters said the introductory paragraph regarding \u201cAlternate \nDocumentation\u201d should be modified to explain that the victim or someone acting on behalf of the victim has the \noption of submitting alternative documentation instead of the certification form and, only in cases where the \nresponsible entity receives conflicting statements, may the responsible entity require third-party documentation. \nCommenters said the form should also indicate that a responsible entity's request for third-party documentation \nmust be made in writing. Additionally, commenters said the list of available alternate documentation should mirror \nthe proposed regulatory language at \u00a7&thinsp;5.2007(b)(1). Other commenters said that the form should direct \nresponsible entities to accept self-certification as a last resort, or the form should include information on whether an \nindividual has third-party documentation and a space to provide information on any barriers that exist to obtaining \nthird-party documentation.\n \n  Another commenter said that the language used on the form to indicate the time period to submit documentation \nshould mirror the proposed regulatory language. According to the commenter, the form says the deadline to submit \ndocumentation to a responsible entity is 14 days from the date that the entity submits a written request, rather than \nthe proposed regulatory deadline of 14 days from the date that the tenant/applicant receives a written request. The \ncommenter stated that the proposed certification form currently requests both the date and time of the incident(s), \nand said the request for the time is overly burdensome, as the victim may not recall it, or may be seeking \ncertification based on a series of incidents. Similarly, other commenters said victims may not be able to recall dates, \nparticularly if multiple events are involved. The commenters recommended that the form be revised to request \ndate(s) and time and location of incident(s) \u201cif known.\u201d Similarly, a commenter recommended the certification line \nread that it is to certify that the information provided on this form is true and correct \u201cto the best of my knowledge \nand recollection.\u201d\n \n  In addition, commenters said the confidentiality clause at the end of the certification form should be amended to \nsay that employees may not disclose, reveal, or release information, except to the extent that disclosure is \nconsented to by the victim in a time-limited written release. The commenters said that the proposed form's inclusion \nof the \u201cPublic Reporting Burden\u201d paragraph should be removed, but if this paragraph has to be on the form, it \nshould be moved to the end of the form and the confidentiality paragraph should be moved higher on the form.\n \n  Another commenter said that the signature block should include the warning that the signatory is making such \nstatements under penalty of perjury.\n \n\n\n\n  A commenter said that the certification should specially call out that the resident or participant is to take steps to \nensure that the perpetrator does not learn of the new unit location, and if the victim allows the perpetrator back into \nthe new unit then the victim may be denied a future emergency transfer if requested again.\n \n  In the interest of lessening the administrative burden on housing providers, a commenter suggested HUD allow \nthe responsible entity to make an oral, rather than written, request for documentation. The commenter said this is \nespecially important in emergency situations where there may not be a contact address for the victim, and when the \nalleged perpetrator may be put on notice of the victim's request for assistance should a written request be sent to \nthe household.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD's revised certification form clarifies that victims may complete the certification form, or may \nsubmit third-party documentation, for reasons described elsewhere in this preamble. In addition, the Notice of \nOccupancy Rights, which all tenants and applicants will receive at the same time they receive the certification form, \nexplains that it is the tenant or applicant's choice, which form of documentation to submit, except for cases where \nthere is conflicting evidence. HUD declines to amend the certification form to discuss that a request for third-party \ndocumentation must be in writing, since the provider may only ask for third party documentation in cases of \nconflicting evidence, and then the certification form would not be applicable at that point.\n \n  HUD appreciates commenters pointing out that the list of available alternate documentation in the proposed \ncertification form differed from the types of alternate documentation described in VAWA 2013 and the proposed \nrule. As a result, HUD has amended this language on the certification form so that it properly reflects the statutory \nand regulatory text. HUD has also revised the form to clarify that the deadline to submit documentation to a \nresponsible entity is 14 business days from the date that the tenant or applicant receives a written request. Further, \nHUD has revised the certification form to incorporate commenters' suggestion that victims should specify the \ndate(s) and time(s) of incidents if known. In addition, the certification signature block is revised to say that the \ninformation provided is true and correct to the best of the knowledge and recollection of the person who fills out the \nform. HUD has also accepted commenters' suggestion of moving the confidentiality paragraph higher on the form \nand moving down the paragraph in the public reporting burden, in order to emphasize the confidentiality provisions.\n \n  HUD declines to amend the certification form to say that employees may not reveal or release information, as \nHUD uses the term \u201cdisclose\u201d to encompass revealing, or releasing. Because it is standard for waivers of \nconfidentiality provisions to be time-limited, HUD accepts the proposal to add that victims must consent to \ndisclosure in a time-limited written release. HUD also makes this change in 24 CFR 5.2007(c)(2)(i). However, HUD \ndeclines to alter the signature block to say that the signatory is making statements under penalty of perjury. The \nsignature block states that submission of false information could jeopardize program eligibility and could be the \nbasis for denial of admission, termination of assistance, or eviction, as terminating or denying assistance are \nactions within HUD's jurisdiction.\n \n\n  HUD also will not revise the certification form to say that the resident or participant is to take steps to ensure that \nthe perpetrator does not learn of the new unit location. This purpose of this certification form is to document \nincidents of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, and is not documentation for \nemergency transfers. The model emergency transfer plan explains that the resident is urged to take all reasonable \nprecautions to be safe.\n \n  HUD understands commenter's rationale for the request to allow housing providers to make oral, rather than \nwritten, requests for documentation. However, the provision requiring a written request is in VAWA 2013, and such \nrequirement provides a record for tenants and applicants and housing providers as to compliance with the \ndocumentation provisions of this rule. HUD notes that, where possible, housing providers should give written \ndocumentation requests to victims in person.\n <h5>\n\n\n\n  b. Notice of Occupancy Rights</h5>\n \n  Comment: The notice of occupancy rights should be more readable and accessible. Commenters said that the \nnotice of occupancy rights in the proposed rule is inaccessible to many and should be shortened or simplified. A \ncommenter said that Web sites that measure text readability determined that the notice required the reader to have \nadvanced education. Commenters said the notice must use simple, direct language. Another commenter said the \nuse of statutory language and terms is appropriate and necessary in some contexts, but inclusion of the statutory \nprovisions can decrease the reader's ability to understand and use the information. The commenter recommended \nincluding definitions for particularly complex terms used in the notice.\n \n\n  Other commenters suggested that the notice use plain-language. A commenter explained that someone may not \nrelate to the words \u201cvictim\u201d or \u201cperpetrator,\u201d but they may relate to this language: \u201cif someone has harmed another \nperson in the home, there are options available.\u201d Commenters stated that a number of sentences in the notice are \nlengthy, with complicated sentence structures, and they include more detail than necessary. Commenters provided \nexamples of sentences in the notice that could be simplified, including changing: \u201cAlso attached is a HUD-approved \ncertification form for documenting an incident of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking for \na tenant who seeks the protections of VAWA as provided in this notice of occupancy rights and in HUD's \nregulations\u201d to \u201cA form is attached to this notice. You can fill out this form to show that you are a victim of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, and that you wish to use your rights under VAWA.\u201d A \ncommenter said simpler wording would also facilitate translation into other languages.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates commenters' suggestions and has revised the notice of occupancy rights to \nmake it more easily readable. However, as discussed below, the notice does use the terms \u201cabuser\u201d and \n\u201cperpetrator.\u201d HUD believes language that \u201csomebody may have harmed another\u201d is too vague and that the terms \n\u201cabuser\u201d and \u201cperpetrator\u201d are easily understandable.\n \n  Comment: The notice should use different language for accuracy and effect. Commenters said that the term \n\u201cabuser\u201d is used throughout the Notice of Occupancy Rights, but that HUD's notice needs to also include the term \n\u201cperpetrator,\u201d in order to reference perpetrators of sexual assault or stalking. A commenter further said the notice \nshould not use language that excludes victims who are not fleeing or escaping abuse, such as victims of sexual \nassault, and should thus use words such as \u201clooking for help,\u201d \u201chealing\u201d or \u201crecovering\u201d in referencing their current \ncircumstances.\n \n  Commenters also said the text of the notice itself, and not a footnote, should make it clear that despite the name of \nthe law, VAWA protection is available regardless of sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or age. A \ncommenter further stated that sections of the notice use the phrase \u201cmay not,\u201d such as \u201cyou may not be denied \nadmission or denied assistance,\u201d and that changing the language to \u201cmust not\u201d sends a stronger message about \nthe degree to which VAWA prohibits such discrimination.\n \n  A commenter recommended that the section of the notice on removing the abuser from the household, the notice \nshould say \u201cHP can (rather than \u201cmay\u201d) choose to divide your lease. . .\u201d to more clearly convey that the housing \nprovider has the discretion to bifurcate a lease. The commenter said that the notice does not mention that the \nremaining tenant can try to establish eligibility for another housing program covered by VAWA, and tenants may not \nbe aware of this option. The commenter further said the notice should be clarified to say the housing provider may, \nbut is not required to, ask for documentation. Another commenter stated that it did not know whether \u201cdivide\u201d means \nto \u201cbifurcate\u201d and requested that HUD clarify. The commenter said that if \u201cdivide\u201d does mean \u201cbifurcate,\u201d the notice \nshould make clear to tenants that an owner, and not a PHA, can divide the lease. A commenter said that, in the \nsection on documenting that one has been a victim, the notice should clarify when a housing provider is exercising \ndiscretion, and ensure that tenants and applicants understand that the housing provider is not required to, but is \nmerely allowed to, extend the 14-day time period to submit documentation.\n\n\n\n \n  Commenters said the notice also needs to make clear that the tenant or applicant asserting VAWA protections can \nchoose which form of acceptable documentation to provide, except in circumstances where there is conflicting \nevidence. The commenter further said that in discussing the types of documentation that could be provided as a \nrecord of Federal, State, tribal, territorial, or local law enforcement agency, providing one or two examples (e.g., \nrestraining order, protective order, etc.) would be helpful.\n \n  A commenter stated that, in the section of the notice of reasons a tenant may be evicted, it should be clear that \nvictims can be evicted or terminated if the housing provider demonstrates that the victim's continued tenancy poses \nan \u201cactual and imminent threat\u201d to other tenants or employees, and should explain what this means. The \ncommenter suggested this section also note that eviction or termination should be pursued only when there are no \nother actions that could be taken to reduce or eliminate the threat.\n \n  Commenters said the notice is addressed to \u201call tenants and prospective tenants,\u201d and this appears to cover even \neligible households that have not applied for assistance. Commenters said HUD should only require providers to \nnotify existing participants and applicants. A commenter said the notice grossly oversimplifies the process required \nto remove a member from the household. The commenter said the provider and other household members must \ncooperate to remove a member who has some property rights to the housing or assistance, and it is not the \nprovider alone who can divide the lease or remove the abuser from the household.\n \n  Other commenters said the form contains extraneous information. A commenter stated that the first bullet \ndescribing documentation includes a description of the information contained in the certification, but if participants \nand applicants receive the certification form, the notice need not describe its contents. The commenter further \nstated that after listing professionals who may provide documentation, the notice contains a parenthetical that says, \n\u201c(collectively, \u201cprofessional\u201d),\u201d and this extra language adds nothing.\n \n\n  A commenter said the transfer right must be described in the proposed notice in more detail for a tenant to \nsufficiently be able to act on that right and to understand that this is an emergency transfer and not a traditional, \nslow transfer process, and the notice should explain any necessary documentation requirements. A commenter \nsaid the language should not use the term \u201canother unit\u201d because it gives the impression that the move is only to a \nunit within the existing covered housing project. The commenter said the language should state that \u201cif you \nreasonably believe there is a threat of imminent harm from violence if you stay in the same unit or development \nwhere you live now, or if you are a victim of sexual assault that recently happened at your development, you have \nthe right to ask for an emergency transfer to a different unit, including a unit in a different development, different \ntype of affordable housing, and in a different location.\u201d The commenter said the notice should also emphasize that \nrequests for transfers and the location of the move will be kept confidential.\n \n  Another commenter said the notice should include language that informs an applicant of the possibility of \novercoming a negative rental, tenant, or criminal history if that history relates to their victimization. The commenter \nsaid this will allow a survivor to obtain and provide appropriate information to the covered housing program at the \noutset of the application process.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates these comments and has revised the Notice of Occupancy Rights to more \naccurately reflect the scope of VAWA protections. The revised notice states in the text, and not only in a footnote \nthat the VAWA protections are not only available to women, but are available equally to all individuals. Further, the \nnotice uses the term \u201cperpetrator\u201d in addition to \u201cabuser\u201d in order to reference perpetrators of sexual assault and \nstalking. The proposed notice did not use the term \u201cfleeing\u201d and only referred to \u201cescaping\u201d an abusive relationship \nwhen providing victims of domestic violence with a resource, but the revised notice no longer discusses \u201cescaping\u201d \nan abusive relationship. The revised notice now notes that after a lease bifurcation, remaining tenants can try to \nestablish eligibility for another housing program covered by VAWA.\n\n\n\n \n\n  HUD has also revised the notice as suggested by commenters to improve clarity. The notice now explicitly states \nthat dividing a lease means the same thing as bifurcating a lease, but the notice does not specify which housing \nprovider would bifurcate a lease, as this differs across programs. Housing providers that issue the notice of rights \nshould clarify who is responsible for lease bifurcation. The revised notice also clarifies that a housing provider can, \nbut is not required to, ask for documentation, and may but is not required to, extend the deadline to submit \ndocumentation. The revised notice also states that except for cases where there is conflicting evidence, it is the \nchoice of the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking which form of documentation \nto submit. The notice also now states that examples of reports from law enforcement agencies and courts include \npolice reports, protective orders, and restraining orders, among others.\n \n\n  In response to the comment that the notice should explain when a tenant could be evicted or assistance could be \nterminated, the revised notice states that the VAWA protections may not apply if the housing provider can \ndemonstrate that not evicting a tenant or terminating the tenant's assistance would present a real physical danger \nthat would occur within an immediate time frame, and could result in death or serious bodily harm to other tenants \nor those who work on the property. The notice explains that housing providers should only evict tenants or \nterminate assistance when they cannot take other actions to reduce or eliminate the threat. Further, the revised \nnotice is addressed to tenants and applicants, rather than tenants and prospective tenants. The revised notice also \nexplains the criteria for requesting an emergency transfer, but it does not provide further information on emergency \ntransfers, which vary across housing programs and providers, and instead notifies tenants that their housing \nprovider has an emergency transfer plan that contains more information, and tenants have a right to see the plan.\n \n\n  There are some changes suggested by commenters that HUD did not make to the revised notice. HUD has not \nreplaced the phrase \u201cmay not\u201d throughout the notice to \u201cmust not.\u201d HUD maintains that \u201cmay not\u201d sufficiently \ndenotes that an action is prohibited. HUD also declines to replace the word \u201cmay\u201d in the sentence that says a \nhousing provider \u201cmay\u201d bifurcate a lease with the word \u201ccan,\u201d because HUD believes \u201cmay\u201d better signifies that the \nhousing provider has discretion whether to bifurcate a lease. The notice does not provide additional language \nregarding the mechanics of the bifurcation process, and the role of other household members. The notice says that \nthe housing provider must follow Federal, State, and local eviction procedures, and that the housing provider may \nask for documentation of the VAWA-covered incident(s). HUD declines to place additional responsibilities for \nremoval of a perpetrator on a victim who has asked for that removal, as, due to household violence, the victim may \nbe unable to provide it. Additionally, this notice includes the description of the certification form that will be attached, \nso that tenants and applicants know that they have a right to use that specific form. The form also retains the \nparenthetical that explains the use of the word \u201cprofessional\u201d later in the paragraph. Further, HUD declines to \nprovide detail in this notice of basic protections about different ways in which somebody could be denied \nassistance, terminated from participation in, or be evicted from rental housing because somebody has been a victim \nof domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.\n \n\n  Comment: The notice should provide more resources and information. Commenters said the notice should also \ninclude the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN) hotline for victims of sexual assault to supplement \nthe hotline number already provided for victims of domestic violence. A commenter also suggested the notice \ninclude a blank space where the housing provider can insert contact information for local legal services and victim \nservices providers. Another commenter recommended that HUD revise the notice to indicate to tenants that the \nnotice is not an exhaustive list of tenant protections, and they are entitled to many additional protections at the \nstate, local, and administrative level, and that they should consult their local PHA for information on rights afforded \nin their respective jurisdiction.\n \n\n\n\n  A commenter suggested that the notice encourage tenants or applicants who think they may qualify for VAWA \nprotections to seek the assistance of a legal services attorney or victim services provider.\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD's Notice of Occupancy Rights has been revised to include spaces for housing providers to \nfill in contact information for relevant organizations, including victim service providers or legal aid attorneys, that \nmay be able to assist victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. HUD encourages \nhousing providers to include contact information on the notice for local organizations, as these organizations may \nbe in the best position to understand the victim's situation and available options. In addition, or where housing \nproviders do not know of local organizations or none are available, housing providers should include national \nresources, such as: The National Domestic Violence Hotline, which was listed on the proposed notice and is still \nlisted on this final notice; the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network's National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800-656-\nHOPE, or at https://ohl.rainn.org/online/ for victims of sexual assault; and the National Center for Victims of Crime's \nStalking Resource Center at            https://www.victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/stalking-resource-center, for \nvictims of stalking.\n\n \n\n  The revised notice now explicitly states that tenants and applicants may be entitled to additional housing \nprotections for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking under other Federal laws, \nas well as under State and local laws.\n\n \n\n  Comment: The notice should be more specific on rights and responsibilities. Commenters said that rather than \nstate that tenants may stay \u201cin the unit for a period of time\u201d until they can find alternate housing or establish \neligibility under the HUD program, the notice of occupancy rights should be specific as to what this time is to ensure \nthe victimized tenant is not left without secure housing. A commenter also stated that the notice should be clear \nabout when a housing provider can request proof that an individual is requesting to move because of a VAWA-\nrelated incident. The commenter said that the notice states a housing provider \u201cmay\u201d ask for proof. Another \ncommenter said that HUD's discussion of confidentiality in the notice is overly simplified. The commenter said the \nnotice states that information may be released if, \u201cA law requires HP or your landlord to release the information.\u201d \nThe commenter said this phrase includes a broad array of possible disclosures not necessarily obvious to an \nordinary reader, for instance, in connection with reviews by HUD staff, audits by HUD's Inspector General, and to \nan independent public auditor, among other possibilities. Commenter said it may be unreasonable for HUD to \ndevelop a comprehensive list of how information may be disclosed in this notice, but the notice currently \nunderstates the potential for such disclosures.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD's Notice of Occupancy Rights describes basic VAWA protections that apply across all \nprograms, which is why the notice states that tenants may stay in units for a period of time if a housing provider \nchooses to bifurcate a lease. The revised notice explains that housing providers may ask for documentation that an \nindividual qualifies for an emergency transfer. The notice provides the criteria for qualifying for an emergency \ntransfer, and it directs tenants to the housing provider's emergency transfer plan for further information. HUD \nbelieves that providing notice that confidential information may be released if a law requires it is sufficiently broad to \nalert tenants and applicants of that possibility.\n\n \n\n  Comment: HUD should create different notices for different housing programs to account for necessary variations. \nCommenters said HUD, and not a housing provider, is in the best position to create a series of different notices that \noutline how VAWA rights will apply in different housing programs. Other commenters said that permitting housing \nproviders to customize the notice is very concerning because there is no mechanism for quality control and no way \nto ensure that the notices being distributed accurately reflect the VAWA protections, resulting in confusion and \ninconsistency. A commenter said that HUD should create different notices to prevent additional burdens on covered \nhousing providers that would otherwise be expected to determine how VAWA 2013 protections play out in their \n\n\nprograms. Commenters said that, to the extent that HUD wishes for there to be a local point of contact for tenants \nand applicants, HUD should include blanks that would allow the housing provider to add contact information, but \nhousing providers should not be \u201cfilling in the blanks\u201d regarding programmatic operations. Another commenter \nspecifically recommended that HUD create two separate notices, one targeting tenant-based recipients and another \nthat targets households with a subsidy that is tied to the unit. Commenter said the current notice refers to \u201crental \nassistance,\u201d which may be confusing to tenants subsidized by covered housing programs other than HCVs.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD's Notice of Occupancy Rights contains basic information that apply across all programs, \nand the only information housing providers provide is the name of the housing provider, the relevant HUD program, \nand contact information for local organizations that may be able to assist victims of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, and stalking. Therefore, HUD will not create notices for different housing programs. HUD \nhas revised the notice to clarify that it applies to assistance under HUD-covered housing programs.\n\n \n\n  Comment: The notice of occupancy rights is so important that it should be reissued for public comment with any \nchanges after the issuance of the final rule. Commenters stated that creation of the Notice of Occupancy Rights is a \ncrucial step in the VAWA 2013 implementation process, particularly since the U.S. Department of Treasury and the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture will also utilize this notice in their housing programs. Commenters said that since the \nregulation has not yet been finalized, and changes will likely arise out of the notice and comment period, HUD \nshould reissue the Notice for public comment after the issuance of the Final Rule.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: The changes that HUD has made to the Notice of Occupancy Rights respond to concerns by \ncommenters that the language in the rule should be simplified and better explain protections provided under VAWA \n2013 and HUD's implementing regulations. HUD appreciates the comments and suggestions on changes to \nimprove the Notice of Occupancy Rights, and has incorporated many of the changes. As a result, and because \nHUD maintains that there should be no further delay in providing tenants and applicants with the Notice of \nOccupancy Rights, HUD declines to seek further comment on the notice.\n\n <h5>\n\n  6. Provision of the Notice of Occupancy Rights and Certification Form</h5>\n\n \n\n  Comment: Include notice of VAWA protections in leases and other existing materials. A commenter stated that the \nlegal rights of tenants can be ensured by attaching a copy of the statute to the tenant lease. Another commenter \nasked that any additions to leases about VAWA rights be written in simple, direct language and avoid legal jargon. \nOther commenters recommended that HUD incorporate the notification language into existing materials, such as \nthe Tenants' Rights and Responsibilities brochure.\n\n \n\n  Other commenters said that while VAWA 2013 requires HUD to develop a notice of rights, the form of the notice is \nnot prescribed in the statute. Commenters suggested that a separate notice is not required, and the commenters \nreferenced a 2012 Senate Committee report saying that the Committee intended that notification be incorporated \ninto existing standard notification documents that are provided to tenants. Commenters said that such incorporation \nwould reduce administrative burden. A commenter said owners could be required to include language about VAWA \nprotections in any notice of rejection or termination. The commenter said that since such notices must provide \nresidents and applicants an opportunity to appeal eviction or termination, these notices would be an appropriate \nplace to explain that being a victim of an act covered under VAWA would be grounds for reconsideration. According \nto the commenter, incorporation of VAWA protections into existing notification documents would dispense with the \nneed for a separate document on VAWA protections.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Another commenter stated that the notification process conflicts with the Paperwork Reduction Act by requiring \nmore paper, and adding an individual document, rather than incorporating the notice into other documents, \nincreases the chances that a tenant will not see the notification because a housing provider may forget to provide it, \nor because the tenant will not read it. Commenter further stated that housing providers should not be required to \nprovide the entire VAWA policy in tenant selection plans or in House Rules.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: Regardless of the legislative history of VAWA 2013, the statute itself as enacted requires HUD to \ndevelop a notice of rights under VAWA and requires covered housing providers to submit that notice to a tenant or \napplicant at three specific times: (1) When an individual is denied residency under an assisted program; (2) when \nan individual is admitted to a dwelling unit assisted under the covered housing program; and (3) with any notification \nof eviction or termination of assistance. HUD believes that it is important to provide a separate notice of occupancy \nrights under VAWA to ensure applicants and residents are aware of these rights. Therefore, HUD requires that \nhousing providers give a separate notice of housing rights to tenants at the times specified in this rule.\n\n \n\n  HUD maintains the provisions in the proposed rule that require descriptions of VAWA protections in leases, lease \naddendum or contracts, as specified in the regulations for the HOME, HOPWA, ESG, and CoC programs. For \npublic housing and section 8 programs covered by VAWA 2005, this rule does not eliminate any existing notification \nrequirements. Prior to this rule becoming effective, 24 CFR 5.2005(a)(4) provided that a HUD-required lease, lease \naddendum, or tenancy addendum, as applicable, must include a description of specific protections afforded to the \nvictims of domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking, as provided in this subpart. This final rule clarifies that \nthis remains a requirement, and adds that a description of protections afforded to victims of sexual assault is also \nrequired.\n\n \n\n  Rule Change: This final rule maintains existing 24 CFR 5.2005(a)(4) for programs covered by VAWA prior to the \n2013 reauthorization, and adds sexual assault to the list of the types of victims covered by VAWA.\n\n \n\n  Comment: HUD should not mandate including attachments with the notice of housing rights or certification form. \nCommenters said HUD should not require that the VAWA regulations be included with the notice of housing rights. \nCommenters said it is unlikely that many tenants or prospective tenants have the time or background knowledge to \nunderstand the full scope of their rights by reading the VAWA regulations and doing so may confuse or overwhelm \nthem or cause them to ignore the entire document. Commenters suggested that, instead of providing a copy of the \nregulations, the notice should make the regulations available to tenants and applicants. Some commenters \nsuggested providing a link to the regulations, perhaps in a footnote that would include the Federal Register citation \nfor the final rule.\n\n \n\n  Some commenters said that requiring providers to send copies of regulations is an overly burdensome \nrequirement that would impose considerable cost on providers for printing and mailing without adding anything to \nmost recipients' understanding of their protections under VAWA. A commenter stated that tenants and applicants \ncould potentially receive copies of the rule multiple times (as an applicant, if denied assistance, or if notified of \ntermination or eviction), and there is no need to receive multiple copies of the regulations. Another commenter said \nincluding attachments of the regulations and a listing of local organizations offering assistance to victims of \ndomestic violence is unnecessary and can lead to greater confusion for victims during a stressful time.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD agrees that housing providers should not have to include a copy of the VAWA regulations \nevery time they give a tenant or applicant the notice of housing rights and certification form, but the regulations \nshould be made available to tenants and applicants who request to see the regulations. Therefore, HUD revised the \nNotice of Occupancy Rights to provide a link to HUD's VAWA regulations. Because not every tenant or applicant \n\n\n\nwill be able to access these regulations on-line, the revised Notice of Occupancy Rights states that housing \nproviders must make a copy of the regulations available to tenants and applicants who ask to see them. HUD also \nrevised its model emergency transfer plan to remove the reference to an attachment of the regulations. The final \nmodel emergency transfer plan, however, maintains the reference to the attachment that lists local organizations \noffering assistance to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, and HUD \nencourages housing providers to make this list available to tenant and applicants who ask for the list.\n\n \n\n  Comment: The timing for submission of notification of occupancy rights should be changed. Commenters asked if, \nrather that distributing the notice of occupancy rights on three occasions, the notice could be provided to all \napplicants at the time they submit their original application. Other commenters said the notification process in the \nproposed regulations is burdensome and unnecessary because the vast majority of terminations and evictions are \nfor reasons unrelated to VAWA. A commenter suggested that the notice be provided at the following times: When \nan application is rejected; at the time of entry into a covered program; and upon tenant request. Another commenter \nsaid that adding this notice and its attachments to each eviction notice adds an unwarranted due process procedure \nto an already overly burdened due process. The commenter sated that failure to serve such notice should not be \ngrounds to appeal termination or eviction. Another commenter said providing the notice when an individual is \nprovided assistance or admission is overkill because they will not be exercising VAWA rights at that time.\n\n \n\n  Other commenters said that submitting these notices to all denied applicants could be administratively prohibitive. \nA commenter stated that for its HOME projects, it currently administers an online housing lottery that frequently \nresults in tens of thousands of applications, many of which are pre-determined to be ineligible based on measures \nlike income. Commenter said that such applicants do not receive rejection letters and it would be unreasonable, \nimpracticable, administratively burdensome, and confusing to applicants, for commenter to send these families a \nVAWA notice. The commenter stated that it would more reasonable to provide the VAWA notice to those applicants \nwho have been selected by the lottery and were subsequently interviewed but found to be ineligible. The \ncommenter asked that the final rule provide such clarification for the benefit of agencies that are responsible for \nmarketing units of covered programs.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: The VAWA statute itself requires the notice of occupancy rights and specifies when this notice \nmust be submitted to tenants and applicants, and HUD has no authority to changes these statutory requirements. \nHowever, for purposes of the HOME program, the final rule clarifies that notice is not required upon any denial of \nHOME rental housing but rather any denial based on the owner's tenant selection policies and criteria.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Notification and certification forms should be given to existing tenants. Commenters stated that to \nreduce costs and time burdens to housing providers, VAWA forms should not have to be distributed to existing \ntenants outside of routine contacts in the year following the effective date of HUD's final rule, and some suggested \nthat the information could be given to tenants during the annual recertification process. Commenters said that \ngenerally every existing tenant undergoes recertification during any 12-month period, and while this means some \ntenants would not be notified for nearly one year after the effective date of the final rule, the VAWA protections are \nonly relevant for existing tenants in response to a notice of termination or eviction, which would trigger the legal \nrequirement to provide the VAWA notice and form anyway. Commenters said that HUD could post VAWA rights on \nits Web site for interested parties to access at any time.\n\n \n\n  A commenter said that covered housing providers may not know which tenants are due a notice, or the provider \nmay not know which program applies, so the notice should not be given to existing tenants until either recertification \nor lease renewal. Another commenter said that to lessen the rule's administrative and financial burden, housing \nproviders should be permitted to provide the notice at lease renewal.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Other commenters recommended that HUD give housing providers flexibility regarding how to distribute the \nnotices to existing tenants, in accordance with existing procedures. Other commenters emphasized that notice be \ngiven to all current tenants, regardless of whether their programs were previously covered by VAWA, because \nunder VAWA 2005 there was no uniform notice received by all tenants and VAWA 2013 includes new housing \nprotections. Another commenter suggested that a general mailing to all of the tenants may be the only way to reach \neveryone in a timely manner.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD agrees with some of the recommendations made by the commenters and under the final \nrule, housing providers must give all tenants the notice of occupancy rights and the certification form at annual \nrecertification or lease renewal, or if there is no annual recertification or lease renewal, then at some other time, \nduring the 12-month period following the effective date of this rule.\n\n \n\n  Rule Change: This final rule includes new \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(a)(2)(iv) that states that during the 12-month period \nfollowing the effective date of this rule, housing providers must give tenants the notice of occupancy rights and the \ncertification form either during the annual recertification or lease renewal process, or, if there will be no \nrecertification or lease renewal for a tenant during the first year after the rule takes effect, through other means.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Notification should be provided annually at recertification, and at additional times. Commenters said the \nfinal rule should instruct housing providers to distribute the notice at additional times, including upon family break-up \nand as part of a tenant's recertification or reexamination process. Commenters said that HUD should provide in the \nfinal rule that covered housing providers have discretion to provide the notice to tenants in other contexts, such as \nwhen a tenant raises safety concerns with the housing provider, but does not explicitly reference a VAWA crime. \nThe commenters stated that submission in this context would provide housing providers and tenants with additional \ntime to explore housing options\u2014such as locating a victim services provider or legal services attorney, lease \nbifurcation, or emergency transfers, before an eviction or termination notice for a violation has been issued.\n\n \n\n  Commenters also recommended that, at minimum, tenants should receive notice on an annual basis as a matter \nof course going forward to ensure distribution is not simply limited to times where the existing tenants are facing \neviction or termination. A commenter suggested that HUD require housing providers to host routine information \nsessions, about tenants' and covered program participants' rights pursuant to VAWA and should require housing \nproviders to review VAWA rights at all annual program recertifications.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter stated that short notices indicating that more information is available in housing providers' \noffices would aid disseminating information about VAWA protections, as would posting these notices in common \narea locations. Commenter also stated that it should be clear that staff of the housing provider is available to review \nthis material with tenants and to answer questions. The commenter further suggested using all available media to \nalert tenants of VAWA protections, and to do so in easy to understand language.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: As discussed above, under this final rule, housing providers must give tenants the notice of \noccupancy rights and the certification form during either the recertification or lease renewal processes for the 12-\nmonth period following the effective date of this rule, or if there will be no recertification or lease renewal process \nduring that 12-month period, through other means, in addition to providing the notice and form at the times specified \nin VAWA 2013, which times are included in HUD's VAWA regulations. HUD believes these required distribution \ntimes are sufficient to inform all tenants in a HUD-covered housing program of their rights under VAWA, and \ntherefore the final rule does not require housing providers to give tenants the notice of occupancy rights and the \ncertification form on other occasions. Housing providers are free and encouraged to provide the notice and form to \ntenants at any additional times determined to be helpful in informing tenants of their rights under VAWA. HUD also \nencourages housing providers to post the notice of occupancy rights under VAWA in public areas such as waiting \n\n\n\nrooms, community bulletin boards, and lobbies, where all tenants may view them. HUD further encourages, but \ndoes not require, housing providers with Web sites to post the certification form and notice of occupancy rights \nunder VAWA online. HUD also encourages housing providers to work with tenants, and applicants, who need help \nunderstanding their rights under VAWA, either directly, or by providing information about local organizations that \ncould help. In addition, housing providers should be able to answer any questions about emergency transfer plans \nthat they have developed.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Notification and certification forms do not need to be submitted at recertification or to existing tenants. A \ncommenter stated that Section 8 property managers are already required to include VAWA policies in tenant \nselection plans and house rules, and such a requirement could be added for other covered programs. The \ncommenter stated that existing tenants are already aware of VAWA protections, so there should be no requirement \nto provide new information other than modifying house rules to incorporate new VAWA protections. Another \ncommenter said HUD should refrain from imposing additional financial obligations onto HUD-covered housing \nprograms beyond what is stipulated in the VAWA statute.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: This final rule does not require housing providers to give tenants the notice of occupancy rights \nand certification form on an annual basis, but only to give tenants the notice and form during the 12-month period \nfollowing the effective date of this rule, either during recertifications or lease renewals, or if there will be no \nrecertification or lease renewal process during that 12-month period, through other means. This requirement will \nhelp to ensure all tenants receive notice of their rights under VAWA 2013.\n\n \n\n  Comment: HUD should translate the notice of occupancy rights and the certification form. Commenters asked who \nwould have responsibility for translating VAWA-related documents. Many commenters requested that HUD, rather \nthan the housing providers, translate the notice of occupancy rights and the certification form. A commenter said \nthat forms should be translated based on project occupancy. Other commenters said that with 208,000 covered \nproviders, it would be a huge administrative burden and cost, and potentially create confusion and inconsistency if \neach provider were to create its own translation of these forms. A commenter said providing translated versions of \nthe documents will help housing providers save limited resources, and perhaps apply these resources toward other \nlanguage access needs. Commenters requested translation into languages including Arabic, Bengali, Bhutanese, \nChinese, Egyptian Arabic, French, French Creole, Italian, Korean, Polish, Nepalese, Russian, Spanish and \nVietnamese.\n\n \n\n  Commenters said it would be very helpful if HUD translated the documents and posted them on HUD's Web site. \nCommenters said that HUD's translation of the notice and forms would be an important step towards ensuring that \nvictims with limited English proficiency (LEP victims) would be aware of their rights under VAWA 2013. \nCommenters said they believe that HUD is in a much better position than individual housing providers to provide \ntranslations expediently, particularly for languages with smaller constituencies. Commenters said that, in some \nareas, housing providers would not otherwise be directed by the LEP Guidance to provide translated copies of the \nnotice, but would instead be directed by the LEP Guidance to orally interpret the notice's contents. Commenters \nsaid that HUD has previously provided translations of forms, including the self-certification forms issued under \nVAWA 2005 (in 13 languages), and translated versions of the VAWA 2005 lease addendum, as well as non-VAWA-\nrelated documents.\n\n \n\n  The commenters said that centralizing translation responsibility at HUD imposes consistency and uniformity in \ntranslation, and allows for quality control, and would create a central place whereby advocates can express \nconcerns about any inaccuracies with the translations. Commenters also said that it is important for HUD consider \nnot only direct translation of notification/forms, but also transcreation&thinsp; (13)  to ensure that the intended \nmeaning resonates across cultures and languages. Another commenter said the version of the notice, as provided \nin the proposed rule, as written and in English, poses readability issues for those who do not read at more \n\n\n\nadvanced levels. The commenter said that in translating the notice and certification form, HUD should ensure that \nthey can be easily understood by those who read at different levels. Commenters encouraged HUD to not merely \ntranslate each word, but instead ensure the information is conveyed in a meaningful way for the average reader in \nother languages, which would include ensuring documents are written in plain language and are culturally \ncompetent.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter said that it believes VAWA 2013's mandate that HUD develop a notice of housing rights \nincludes developing translated versions of the notice. Commenter said covered housing providers should not be \ncharged with developing any version of the notice or the VAWA self-certification form, including these forms' non-\nEnglish-language counterparts.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: As HUD provided following enactment of VAWA 2005, HUD will translate the notice of housing \nrights and certification form and post them on HUD's Web site. HUD appreciates commenters' request on ensuring \nthe notice of occupancy rights certification forms are understandable across languages and cultures. Housing \nproviders who have LEP applicants and tenants who do not read a language that HUD has translated the form and \nnotice into may have to provide those applicants and tenants with a notice and form translated into languages they \ndo understand, in accordance with HUD's LEP guidance.\n\n \n\n  Comment: The rule should provide ways to ensure all individuals, regardless of language or reading ability, \nunderstand the protections of VAWA. A commenter stated that, because not all LEP applicants and tenants can \nread their native language, and certain LEP individuals communicate in languages that are unwritten, HUD should \nemphasize in the final rule the importance of providing culturally competent, sensitive interpretation of the notice \nwhen any LEP individual requires oral interpretation. Commenter asked that housing providers make available \ninterpreters who are qualified to do sight translation and that, for languages that do not meet the HUD threshold \nrequirement for translating vital documents, tenants be given a document stating: \u201cThis is an important document \nthat could affect your housing rights. If you read this language, please call for further assistance.\u201d A commenter said \nthis would allow those populations with smaller numbers to understand they need to call to receive oral \ninterpretation of important information. Similarly, the commenter said, appropriate notification should be placed on \ndocuments indicating that sign language interpretation is available. Other commenters asked HUD to provide \nadditional guidance for housing providers on how to provide VAWA information in a culturally competent way that \nwould not jeopardize victims' safety or confidentiality.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates commenters' concerns about ensuring that tenants understand VAWA \nprotections. Housing providers must comply with all applicable fair housing and civil rights laws and requirements in \nthe implementation of VAWA requirements. This includes, but is not limited to, the Fair Housing Act, Title VI of the \nCivil Rights Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. See 24 CFR \n5.105(a). For example, housing providers must provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities, \nsuch as a reasonable accommodation to any requirement that the emergency transfer request be in writing, and \nmust help certain survivors put their request in writing, if requested or where the need for such assistance is \nobvious. Individuals with disabilities may request a reasonable accommodation at any time to any program rules, \npolicies, or practices that may be necessary.\n\n \n\n  Housing providers must also ensure that communications and materials are provided in a manner that is effective \nfor persons with hearing, visual, and other communication-related disabilities consistent with Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and their implementing regulations. Housing providers must \nprovide appropriate auxiliary aids and services necessary to ensure effective communication, which includes \nensuring that information is provided in appropriate accessible formats as needed, e.g., Braille, audio, large type, \nassistive listening devices, and sign language interpreters.\n\n\n\n \n\n  With respect to LEP obligations, providers must take reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access to their \nprograms and activities to LEP individuals. Please see the Department's Final Guidance to Federal Financial \nAssistance Recipients: Title VI Prohibition Against National Origin Discrimination Affecting Limited English Proficient \nPersons (LEP Guidance),            http://www.lep.gov/guidance/HUD_guidance_Jan07.pdf. This final rule does not \nrequire housing providers to do more than is required by HUD's LEP guidance. However, HUD encourages housing \nproviders to strive to ensure that all applicants and tenants have notice of their rights under VAWA.\n\n \n\n  Rule Change: In this final rule, HUD has inserted a new subsection under Subpart L at 24 CFR 5.2011 that \nreferences fair housing and civil rights statutes and requirements.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Clarify housing providers' responsibilities related to providing notice of occupancy rights and the \ncertification form. Commenters asked whether housing authorities must provide the actual certification form in the \nNotice of Occupancy Rights or whether including language in the letter is sufficient. Commenters also asked \nwhether housing providers need to document in tenant files that that they provided the required VAWA notices to \ntenants at the required times, or whether adopting and implementing the policy of providing the notices at admission \nis sufficient. Another commenter suggested the notice of occupancy rights include an \u201cacknowledgement of receipt\u201d \nsection to be signed by household members age 16 and above when the notice is provided at admission, \nrecertification, or upon the threat of eviction or termination, but obtaining a signature after being denied housing \nseems impractical.\n\n \n\n  A commenter said that all adult family members should be given notice of any proposed action by the housing \nprovider due to a VAWA-related incident, and said a minimum of 30 days' notice should be provided. The \ncommenter said that if the victim has fled the unit and given the housing provider a new address, then the provider \nshould send notice to the new address.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter asked if there a timeframe by which HUD will be required to develop this notice, and whether \ncovered housing providers will be required to use, distribute, and abide by this notice, or whether it will be optional.\n\n \n\n  A commenter said that HUD's proposed rule would have required covered housing providers to give the notice of \noccupancy rights and certification form to applicants and tenants along with \u201cany notification of eviction or \nnotification of termination of assistance,\u201d but many different notifications are generated in the course of holdover, \nlicensee, and termination of tenancy proceedings. The commenter asked HUD to specify which documents \nconstitute a \u201cnotification of eviction\u201d or \u201cnotification of termination of assistance,\u201d and clarify that housing providers \nare only required to give a tenant the notice once during the course of any tenancy termination or eviction \nproceeding.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: VAWA 2013 and HUD's VAWA regulations require covered housing providers to give tenants \nand applicants both the certification form and the notice of rights. The certification form and the notice of rights that \nhousing providers will use are being published with this final rule. It is a statutory requirement to provide both the \nform and the notice of rights at the times specified in VAWA 2013 and in HUD's VAWA regulations. Housing \nproviders that do not comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements are in violation of program \nrequirements. Among the other times specified in this rule, housing providers are required to give the notice of \nrights and the certification form to tenants with any initial notification of eviction or termination of assistance. \nHowever, housing providers do not need to provide the notice and rights and certification form with subsequent \nnotices sent for the same infraction.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.lep.gov/guidance/HUD_guidance_Jan07.pdf\n\n\n  HUD's final rule does not require housing providers to document in tenant files that they provided the required \nnotice at the required times, nor does HUD's final rule require an \u201cacknowledgement of receipt.\u201d Further, this final \nrule does not provide additional notification requirements for housing providers that take actions due to a VAWA-\nrelated incident, as housing providers may not know that an incident is VAWA-related. As described elsewhere in \nthis preamble, under VAWA 2013 and HUD's final rule, housing providers are prohibited from denying or \nterminating assistance to or evicting a victim protected under VAWA, solely on the basis that the tenant is a victim \nunder VAWA. Housing providers, however, may ask tenants or applicants to provide a form of documentation \nspecified in the statute and in this rule to show they are subject to VAWA protections.\n\n \n\n  Comment: The notice of occupancy rights should be distributed to all persons, and not just heads of households. \nCommenters urged HUD to distribute the notice of occupancy rights to all persons and to find various means and \ntimes at which to distribute a copy of the notice to every existing individual adult tenant, not just the head of \nhousehold, to ensure the notice is not only seen by an abuser or perpetrator. Commenters suggested distributing \nthe notice during such meetings as an in-person recertification or reexamination increases the likelihood that all \nadult members of the household are present and will receive copies of the notice. The commenters said that HUD's \nfinal rule should require covered housing providers to prominently post the notice in visible, regularly-used common \nareas where other information is made available (e.g., community bulletin boards, housing authority waiting areas, \nlaundry rooms etc.), and HUD should encourage housing providers to take advantage of other community events as \nopportunities to distribute the notice of occupancy rights. Another commenter suggested HUD consider allowing \napplicants to designate an alternate \u201csafe address\u201d to receive the VAWA notice.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates these suggestions and agrees with commenters that housing providers should \ndo their best to ensure that all adult members of a household and not just the head of household receive the notice \nof rights and certification form. Section 5.2005 of this rule requires that the notice and certification form be provided \nto each applicant and to each tenant. In addition, as discussed earlier in this preamble, housing providers will be \nrequired to give the notice and form to existing tenants during the recertification and lease renewal processes for \nthe 12-month period following the effective date of this rule. In the limited circumstances where there may be no \nrecertification or lease renewal process for a tenant during the 12-month period following the effective date of this \nrule, housing providers will be required to give the notice and form to tenants through some other means within the \n12-month period after this rule becomes effective.\n\n <h5>\n\n  7. Lease Bifurcation</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  a. Reasonable Time Periods To Establish Eligibility and Find New Housing</h5>\n\n \n\n  Comment: 90 days to establish eligibility for a program or find new housing after a lease is generally reasonable. \nSome commenters expressed agreement with the time periods to establish eligibility for assistance provided in the \nproposed rule, saying they are sufficient to establish eligibility for a covered program or find alternative housing. \nOther commenters stated that the time periods are reasonable but extensions should be permitted. Commenters \nstated that this time period should be at least 90 days, with one commenter saying it should be up to one year. \nCommenters stated that in areas where there are housing shortages it may take longer to find other housing, that it \ncan be complicated to navigate the housing system, and victims may stay with their abusers for fear of losing their \nhousing. Other commenters suggested a minimum of 90 days should be allowed with an extension of 90 days in \n30-day increments, each at the discretion of the housing provider on a case-by-case basis, based on a victim's \ndocumented progress being made toward establishing eligibility to remain in the property, determining if an \nemergency transfer can be arranged, or finding alternative housing.\n\n \n\n\n\n  HUD Response: This final rule maintains the combined 90-day time period for establishing eligibility for a program \nand finding new housing, and the combined 60-day extension period. Unlike the proposed rule, this final rule does \nnot divide the time to (1) establish eligibility for a HUD program, and (2) find new housing into 60 and 30-day time \nperiods, nor does the final rule divide the allowable extension for establishing eligibility and finding new housing into \ntwo 30-day time periods. HUD removes the divisions so that victims have the flexibility to use the overall time period \nallowed to establish eligibility and find new housing in a way that most benefits the victim.\n\n \n\n  However, as explained further below, HUD clarifies in this final rule that the 90-day time period will not apply in \nsituations where there are statutory prohibitions to its application. The 90-day period also will not apply where the \nlease will expire prior to termination of the 90-day period, and, as a result of the lease expiration, assistance is \nterminated. However, the expiration of the lease will not necessarily terminate assistance in the HOPWA program.\n\n \n\n  HUD stresses that the reasonable time period to establish eligibility following a lease bifurcation is triggered only in \nsituations where the tenant removed from the unit is the one family member whose characteristics qualified the rest \nof the family to live in the unit or receive assistance. In many covered housing programs, including HOME, HTF, \nESG, RHSP, and Section 221(d)(3), the reasonable time period provisions of this rule related to lease bifurcation \nwill never be triggered because the family's eligibility is based on the characteristics of the family as a whole, not \nthe characteristics of any one family member. Therefore, the eligibility of remaining tenants in these covered \nhousing programs will have already been established at the time of bifurcation. For the Section 236, public housing, \nand Section 8 programs, which allow pro-ration of rent or assistance for certain families where eligibility has not \nbeen established for all members, the remaining tenants following a VAWA lease bifurcation might still need to \nestablish their eligibility for the covered housing program if they have not provided documentation of satisfactory \nimmigration status.  (14) \n\n \n\n  For each covered housing program, HUD has reviewed the governing statutes and explains in the below chart why \nremaining tenants might not have established eligibility for a program, and in those circumstances, specifically what \nmay impact the prescribed 90- day time period for those remaining family members to either establish eligibility for a \ncovered housing program or to find new housing following a VAWA lease bifurcation.\n\n \n\n  \n\n   \n\n    &emsp;\n\n   \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      &emsp;\n\n     \n\n      Possible eligibility limitations\n\n     \n\n      Regulatory provision\n\n     \n\n      Reasonable time periodto remain in unit\n\n    \n\n   \n\n   \n\n\n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Sections 202/811 PRAC and SPRAC\n\n     \n\n      Age (for Section 202) and Disability (for Section 811)\n\n     \n\n      24 CFR 5.2009\n\n     \n\n      90 days or when the lease expires, whichever is first.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Section 202/8\n\n     \n\n      Age; Immigration Status\n\n     \n\n      24 CFR 5.2009\n\n     \n\n      90 days or when the lease expires, whichever is first; 30 days if immigration status is an eligibility limitation.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      HOPWA\n\n     \n\n      HIV/AIDS\n\n     \n\n      24 CFR 574.460\n\n     \n\n      90 days to 1 year.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      HOME\n\n     \n\n       \n\n     \n\n      24 CFR 92.359\n\n     \n\n      All residents already meet eligibility.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n     \n\n      HTF\n\n     \n\n       \n\n     \n\n      24 CFR 93.356\n\n     \n\n      All residents already meet eligibility.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      ESG\n\n     \n\n       \n\n     \n\n      24 CFR 576.409\n\n     \n\n      All residents already meet eligibility.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      CoC\n\n     \n\n      Qualifying Disability (for Permanent Supportive Housing); Chronically Homeless Status\n\n     \n\n      24 CFR 578.75\n\n     \n\n      Until expiration of the lease.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      RHSP\n\n     \n\n       \n\n     \n\n      24 CFR 5.2009\n\n     \n\n      All residents already meet eligibility.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n\n\n      Section 221(d)(3)/(d)(5)\n\n     \n\n       \n\n     \n\n      24 CFR 5.2009\n\n     \n\n      All residents already meet eligibility.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Section 236 (including RAP)\n\n     \n\n      Immigration Status\n\n     \n\n      24 CFR 5.2009\n\n     \n\n      30 days to meet eligibility.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Public Housing\n\n     \n\n      Immigration Status\n\n     \n\n      24 CFR 5.2009\n\n     \n\n      30 days to meet eligibility.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Section 8 HCV Voucher\n\n     \n\n      Immigration Status\n\n     \n\n      24 CFR 5.2009\n\n     \n\n      30 days to meet eligibility.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Section 8 PBV Voucher\n\n\n\n     \n\n      Immigration Status\n\n     \n\n      24 CFR 5.2009\n\n     \n\n      30 days to meet eligibility.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n\n      Section 8 PBRA and Mod Rehab/SRO\n\n     \n\n      Immigration Status\n\n     \n\n      24 CFR 5.2009\n\n     \n\n      30 days to meet eligibility.\n\n    \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  As shown in the above chart, under the Section 202 and Section 811 programs, there are requirements that the \ntenant be 62 or older (section 202) or disabled (section 811). Section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 (12 U.S.C. \n1701q) (section 202) and section 811 of the National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 8013) (section 811) require \nunits to be leased to eligible low-income disabled persons or families. Under the Section 202 and Section 811 \nstatutes, HUD cannot continue to subsidize a unit for remaining family members after a lease has been bifurcated if \nat least one of the remaining family members has not established eligibility for the program. Therefore, although this \nregulation provides that if a landlord chooses to bifurcate a lease under VAWA for a unit with a Project Rental \nAssistance Contract (PRAC) under the Section 202 or Section 811 programs, and the remaining family members \nhave not established eligibility for the program, the landlord must provide a reasonable time period of 90 days for \nthe remaining family members to remain in the unit, HUD will no longer be able to provide a subsidy to that unit \nduring the time when it has not been established that an eligible individual is residing in the unit.\n\n \n\n  The above chart also provides a shorter reasonable time period in cases where the remaining tenant in a unit \ncovered under the 202/8 program, Section 236 program, public housing, or a Section 8 assisted unit is not eligible \nbecause of immigration status. This is because Section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act of \n1980 (42 U.S.C. 1436a(d)(4)) requires that assistance under these programs be terminated after 30 days if the \nremaining family member has not submitted documentation evidencing a satisfactory immigration status or a \npending appeal of a verification determination of the family member's immigration status.\n\n \n\n  Rule Change: This final rule revises \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009(b) to combine the paragraphs and respective time periods \nthat provide reasonable time periods for establishing eligibility for a covered housing program and finding new \nhousing after a lease bifurcation. HUD revises this section to clarify that covered housing providers who choose to \nbifurcate a lease must provide remaining tenants who have not already established eligibility for the program 90 \ncalendar days to establish eligibility for a covered housing program or find alternative housing. Further, HUD revises \n\n\n\nthis section to state that this 90-calendar-day period will not be available to a remaining household member if \nstatutory requirements of the covered program prohibit it, and that the 90-day calendar period also will not apply \nbeyond the expiration of a lease, unless program regulations provide for a longer time period.\n\n \n\n  Comment: The time periods set out in the rule need to be changed or clarified. Some commenters said the \nreasonable time periods for establishing eligibility after bifurcation or finding new housing should be lengthened. \nCommenters recommended that the reasonable time to establish eligibility to remain in housing after bifurcation be \nextended to 120 days, consistent with HUD policies that allow 120 days for tenants in HUD's multifamily programs \nto provide information to maintain continued housing assistance. Commenters also said the extension is necessary \nbecause survivors may have poor credit, prior arrests, or a prior eviction as a result of the abuse, and may be \nunable to access identification documents taken by abusers. A commenter said that HUD justified using 90 days for \nreasons related to obtaining a social security number, but if it can take up to 90 days just to provide a single piece \nof information, additional time is necessary to apply for and establish eligibility for a program.\n\n \n\n  Commenters said that there are certain parts of the eligibility process that are out of the control of the housing \nprovider as well as the household members, such as income verifications by third parties. In instances where the \nsurvivor cannot establish eligibility, commenters recommended that an additional 60 days or more be granted. \nCommenters cited a critical shortage of affordable and public housing as the reason for a need for a longer time \nperiod. Another commenter said that, under the HCV program, 30 calendar days to find alternative housing is not a \nreasonable timeframe, taking into account voucher holders' success rate and low local vacancy rates. Commenter \nsaid that, for the HCV Program, the initial term of the voucher issued to the family to find an eligible unit is 60 days, \nand for HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH), it is 120 days.\n\n \n\n  A commenter said it understands the desire to establish uniform time periods to ensure that expectations are clear \nfor both survivors and housing providers, but a system that focuses on activities and goals, rather than strict \ntimelines, would better recognize the external and domestic violence-related barriers to housing. The commenter \nsaid that, if an explicitly-defined time limit is necessary, HUD allow housing providers to waive the requirement \nwhenever needed.\n\n \n\n  In contrast to the above comments, other commenters said an eligibility determination can generally be completed \nin significantly less than 60 days, and suggested that 90 days should be established as the maximum amount of \ntime allowed to establish eligibility. A commenter suggested that once a family is determined to be ineligible for a \nprogram, the family should be given 30 days to vacate the unit. Some commenters said the rationale for the \ncombined 90-day time period is unclear. Another commenter asked when the victim would not be able to establish \neligibility, and when a reasonable time period to find other housing would be necessary.\n\n \n\n  Other commenters suggested that it should not take long to establish eligibility for the HUD program as properties \nhave the household's most recent certification and necessary information. A commenter said that 60 days is too \nlong for the initial period to establish eligibility, given the current waiting lists for individuals and families already \ndetermined to be eligible and, in the interest of lessening the burden on housing providers, HUD should permit \nPHAs the discretion to shorten the initial period to establish eligibility up to 30 days. Other commenters said it would \ntake more time to find new housing than it would to establish eligibility in tight housing markets, and suggested that \nHUD reverse the timeframes to provide remaining occupants 30 calendar days to establish eligibility and, if they \ncannot, 60 calendar days to find alternative housing. Commenters said that, whatever time period is granted, it \nshould not be separated into two distinct time periods since that is confusing and the potential is high that the family \nwill not start looking until after they are determined to not be eligible. Commenters said these time periods provided \nin the proposed rule appear to ignore the complexity of bifurcation of a lease under the HCV program where, in \naddition to establishing eligibility and locating alternative housing, a household may also need to negotiate a new \nlease.\n\n\n\n \n\n  A commenter requested clarification from HUD regarding the PHA's responsibilities during this initial period and \nwhether only the tenant's eligibility needs be established, and it is not the case that the PHA must have processed \nthe new paperwork and have either the unit ready for move-in or the assistance ready for the tenant's use within \nthis initial period. A commenter said the burden should be on the tenant to meet their obligation to provide the \nrequired information to establish eligibility within this initial period.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter said that, in an era of greatly diminished financial resources to administer existing housing \nprograms, housing providers should be able to choose at their discretion to provide the tenant time to establish \neligibility and find new housing as the housing provider determines reasonable given housing market conditions in \nthe area of the housing provider. In contrast to this comment, another commenter said that there should be \nconsistency across HUD programs to provide certainty as to how much time a tenant would be given to relocate in \nthe event of bifurcation.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: In the final rule, HUD maintains the time period in the proposed rule of 90 days to establish \neligibility for a covered housing program or find new housing, with the possibility of a 60-day extension, at the \ndiscretion of the housing provider. As discussed above, in this final rule the time periods are not separated into two \ndifferent periods, and the time periods do not apply under certain programs and circumstances.\n\n \n\n  HUD declines to expand or eliminate these time periods because, under VAWA 2013, lease bifurcation is not \nmandatory, and HUD does not want to dissuade housing providers from considering this as an option by requiring \nhousing providers to allow those who may be ineligible for a covered housing program\u2014because they do not meet \nincome or age or any other program requirement\u2014to remain in their units for lengthy time periods. Given the high \ndemand for housing subsidized by HUD by numerous populations, including the homeless, persons with disabilities, \nand the elderly, as well as other victims of crimes, HUD declines to provide for further extensions. HUD also \ndeclines to abbreviate these time periods in the interest of providing greater numbers of tenants with sufficient time \nto establish eligibility for a covered program, or find new housing after a lease is bifurcated. For similar reasons, \nHUD eliminates in this final rule the provision that housing providers may extend the reasonable time period subject \nto authorization under the regulations of the applicable housing program.\n\n \n\n  For the HCV program, the victim and PHA do not have to wait for an owner to bifurcate the lease for the PHA to \noffer continued assistance for a new unit. While the family would not have to wait for bifurcation to occur, it would \nhave to wait for eligibility to be determined.\n\n \n\n  The period to establish eligibility and find new housing is limited to those activities, and does not include any \npossible additional processing or inspection time.\n\n \n\n  Rule Change: HUD removes \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009(b)(1)(iii) and (b)(2)(ii) from the proposed rule, which stated that \nhousing providers may extend the reasonable time period \u201csubject to authorization under the regulations of the \napplicable housing program.\u201d HUD revises this language to state that housing providers have the option of \nextending the reasonable time period by up to 60 calendar days, unless prohibited by the governing statute of the \ncovered program or unless the time period would extend beyond termination of the lease. In addition, HUD revises \n\u00a7&thinsp;982.314 in the proposed rule to reflect this section's redesignation as \u00a7&thinsp;982.354 by HUD's August \n2015 Portability Rule.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Extensions to reasonable time periods should be allowed for public housing and HCV programs. \nCommenters stated that the preamble to the proposed rule provided little justification for withholding the discretion \n\n\n\nto extend the reasonable time period from administrators of public housing or a HCV program because all housing \nprograms, and not just those two programs, face severe shortages of units, and housing agencies should have local \ndiscretion to extend the time in public housing and HCV programs, the same as in other assistance programs. \nAnother commenter proposed there be an initial 30-day period to establish eligibility for public housing and section \n8 programs, but, at the sole discretion of the PHA, this period may be extended for two, additional 30-day periods.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: As discussed above, family members remaining in a unit after lease bifurcation under the HCV \nand Section 8 programs will often already be eligible to remain in the unit and, where an individual would be \nineligible is because of immigration status, HUD is statutorily prohibited from permitting that family member to stay \nin the unit beyond 30 days if satisfactory immigration status cannot be proven.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Those with tenant-based assistance should have the opportunity to remain in their housing while \nattempting to establish eligibility for the program and finding new housing. A commenter said that HUD stated in the \npreamble to the proposed rule that the reasonable time period does not apply to tenant-based assistance, but made \nthis statement with no comprehensible justification. The commenter stated that HUD did not explain its assertion \nthat the reasonable time period resulting from lease bifurcation may only be provided to tenants by covered housing \nproviders that remain subject to the requirements of the other covered housing program once the eligible tenant \ndeparts the unit.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter said it does not understand why HUD, in application of VAWA rights and protections, makes \nthe distinction between project-based assistance and tenant-based assistance. The commenter recommended that \ntenants be allowed to stay in their units while attempting to establish eligibility, and that there be no time period \nimposed on remaining tenants trying to transfer to tenant-based assistance. The commenter said its \nrecommendation is particularly important because the evicted perpetrator who has the tenant-based assistance is \nentitled to due process rights, and if the abuser or perpetrator chooses to exercise these rights, the timeline of when \na victim can establish eligibility for the tenant-based assistance becomes very unpredictable.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter asked HUD to identify the HUD's programs to which it refers when referencing HUD \u201ctenant-\nbased rental assistance\u201d and \u201cproject-based assistance,\u201d and to clarify which programs are subject to the \nreasonable time period accommodation. The commenter stated that the proposed rule advised that agencies \nadministering Section 8 voucher programs should provide the reasonable time period for a maximum period of 90 \ndays, but then said that the reasonable time period does not apply, generally, if the only assistance provided is \ntenant-based rental assistance.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD agrees with commenters that those with tenant-based assistance should have the \nopportunity to remain in their housing while attempting to establish eligibility for a covered program or find new \nhousing. HUD clarifies in this final rule that the reasonable time periods specified in this rule apply to tenant-based \nassistance.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Clarify the interaction between the reasonable time period provided in the proposed rule and \nreasonable time periods in different programs. A commenter stated that proposed \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009(b)(1)(ii) provided \nthat the reasonable time to establish eligibility for assistance can only be provided to remaining tenants if the \ngoverning statute of the covered program authorizes an ineligible tenant to remain in the unit without assistance. \nThe commenter strongly urged HUD to remove this sentence from the rule because such statement is contrary to \nCongressional intent to require covered housing providers to give tenants who remain after a lease bifurcation the \nright to have \u201creasonable time\u201d to establish eligibility. The commenter said that by mandating a \u201creasonable time\u201d in \nthis context, Congress chose to suspend, for a limited time, applicable program eligibility requirements so that \nvictims do not lose housing assistance. The commenter also said it is unclear which program statutes HUD was \n\n\n\nreferring to, and whether there are any statutes that authorize an ineligible person to remain in units without \nassistance. The commenter stated that proposed \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009(b)(1)(ii) said the 60 days does not supersede \nany time period to establish eligibility that may already be provided by the covered housing program. The \ncommenter expressed confusion about whether this statement referred to existing time period requirements for \nremaining family members to establish eligibility, in which case the longer time period applies, or whether the \nstatement was indicating that there are programs with regulations implementing VAWA that outline their own \n\u201creasonable time\u201d periods.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD agrees that the language in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009(b)(1)(ii) of the proposed rule was not as clear \nas HUD intended when HUD stated that the reasonable time to establish eligibility could only be provided to a \nremaining tenant if the governing statute of the covered program authorizes an ineligible tenant to remain in the unit \nwithout assistance. As discussed above, in this final rule, HUD revises \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009(b) to clarify that covered \nhousing providers who choose to bifurcate a lease must provide remaining tenants who have not already \nestablished eligibility for the program 90 calendar days to establish eligibility for a covered housing program or find \nalternative housing. Further, HUD revises this section to state that this 90-calendar-day period will not be available \nto a remaining household member if the governing statute of the covered program prohibits it, and that the 90-day \ncalendar period also will not apply beyond the expiration of a lease, unless program regulations provide for a longer \ntime period. See the chart and explanation earlier in this preamble that explains applicable reasonable time periods \nfor covered housing programs.\n\n \n\n  Comment: For the CoC Program, reasonable time requirements of VAWA should apply in the scenario where the \ntime remaining on the lease is shorter than the reasonable time to establish eligibility. Commenters said proposed \n\u00a7&thinsp;578.75(i)(2), which addresses treatment of remaining program participants following bifurcation of a lease \nor eviction as a result of domestic violence, should be clarified to include transitional housing, and HUD should \ndirect programs to use whatever period is longer\u2014the rest of the time on the lease or the amount of time permitted \nby the general VAWA lease bifurcation provision\u2014on occasions where the time left on the lease is shorter than the \nreasonable time allowed to establish eligibility or find new housing. Other commenters suggested striking \n\u00a7&thinsp;578.99(j)(8), which states that HUD's generally applicable bifurcation requirements pertaining to \nreasonable time periods under VAWA in 24 CFR 5.2009(b) do not apply, and the reasonable time period for the \nCoC program is set forth in \u00a7&thinsp;578.75(i)(2).\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: Section 578.75(i)(2) applies to permanent supportive housing projects, in which the qualifying \nmember of the household must have a qualifying disability. This final rule does not change this section to include \ntransitional housing because transitional housing does not have the same qualifying member requirement. Once \ndetermined eligible, the entire household is considered eligible under transitional housing.\n\n \n\n  This final rule does not maintain \u00a7&thinsp;578.99(j)(8) of the proposed rule, which, as noted above, says that the \nreasonable time periods in 24 CFR 5.2009 do not apply to the CoC program, but instead drafts a separate \nbifurcation section at \u00a7&thinsp;578.99(j)(7). However, HUD maintains that the reasonable time requirements do not \napply because they would conflict with other CoC program requirements.\n\n \n\n  With the exception of permanent supportive housing projects, the eligibility of the household is based on the entire \nhousehold, not just one member, so in the event of a lease bifurcation the household would retain the housing for \nthe length of time remaining in their original period of assistance. Once the period of assistance has ceased then \nthe household would re-certify or re-apply. In the event of lease bifurcation in transitional housing, covered housing \nproviders have the ability to extend the assistance beyond 24 months, on a case-by-case basis, where it is \nnecessary to facilitate the movement to permanent housing. HUD will continue to allow covered housing providers \nthe discretion that they currently have in assisting families when the families' circumstances change during their \n\n\n\noriginal period of assistance. Existing CoC regulations state that surviving members of a household living in a \npermanent supportive housing unit have a right to rental assistance until the lease expires.\n\n \n\n  Rule Change: HUD removes the requirement in \u00a7&thinsp;578.99(j)(8) and provides for a new section on lease \nbifurcations at \u00a7&thinsp;578.99(j)(7).\n\n <h5>\n\n  b. Bifurcation Logistics</h5>\n\n \n\n  Comment: Clarify how bifurcation applies to affiliated individuals and lawful occupants. Commenter stated that the \ndefinition of bifurcation in the regulations explains that if a VAWA act occurs, \u201ccertain tenants or lawful occupants\u201d \ncan be evicted while the remaining \u201ctenants or lawful occupants\u201d can continue to reside in the unit. Commenter said \nthis section should specify whether the phrase \u201ctenants or lawful occupants\u201d includes \u201caffiliated individuals.\u201d \nCommenter also requested clarification on the meaning of the terms \u201caffiliated individual\u201d and \u201cother individual\u201d in \nproposed \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009(a)(1). A commenter asked the following questions: (1) If a member of a household is a \nlawful occupant and not a signatory to the lease, but is also the abuser, is \u201cbifurcation\u201d an appropriate remedy to \nterminate the abuser's occupancy rights; (2) is bifurcation an appropriate remedy if an \u201caffiliated individual\u201d is the \nabuser; (3) if a member of a household is an unauthorized occupant and is also the abuser, what actions may the \ncovered housing provider take against the abuser; (4) if a member of a household is an unauthorized occupant and \nalso the abuser, may the covered housing provider take action against the tenant-lease signatory for permitting an \nunauthorized occupant to reside in the unit without violating VAWA; (5) can a lease be bifurcated if the abuser is a \ntenant or lawful occupant of the unit, but the victim lives elsewhere; and (6) what remedies does an \u201caffiliated \nindividual\u201d have, if any, if the affiliated individual is the victim of a VAWA act, or a non-victim household member?\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: The phrase \u201ctenants or lawful occupants\u201d does not include affiliated individuals who are neither \ntenants nor lawful occupants. Affiliated individuals are not themselves afforded protections or remedies under \nVAWA 2013 or HUD's VAWA regulations. Rather, a tenant may be entitled to VAWA protections and remedies \nbecause an affiliated individual of that tenant is or was a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault, or stalking. However, an affiliated individual cannot seek remedies from the housing provider.\n\n \n\n  HUD's proposed language in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009(a)(1), which provides that a covered housing provider may bifurcate \na lease in order to evict, remove, or terminate assistance to an individual who engages in criminal activity directly \nrelating to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking against an \u201caffiliated individual or other \nindividual,\u201d mirrors language in VAWA 2013. HUD interprets this statutory language to mean that a housing provider \nmay bifurcate a lease to remove a member of the household who engages in criminal activity directly relating to \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, against any individual.\n\n \n\n  Generally speaking, a lawful occupant will not have rights to a unit under a covered housing program unless the \nlawful occupant is a tenant on the lease. Bifurcation is not the appropriate remedy to remove a household member \nwho is not on the lease and who is not a tenant. There would be no need to divide the lease to remove a household \nmember who is not on the lease. As explained elsewhere in this preamble, under VAWA, a covered housing \nprovider may not evict or terminate assistance to a tenant solely on the basis that the tenant has an unauthorized \nabuser or perpetrator in the household, where the unreported household member is in the unit because he or she \nhas committed an act of domestic violence against the tenant, and the tenant is afraid to report him or her.\n\n \n\n  Comment: HUD should outline a process for victims to establish eligibility and find new housing. Commenter said \nit is important for HUD to outline a process and timeframe for victims to exercise their right to establish eligibility for \nthe current program, and the process should be modeled off of one that already exists for the multifamily programs \n\n\n\nin the recertification context. Commenter suggested the covered housing provider should immediately provide a \nnotice to the remaining tenants stating their right to establish eligibility under the current program within a specified \ntime period, and the time period should not start to run unless the required notice has been provided. Commenter \nsuggested the notice describe how the tenants can apply for the program and include a deadline by which the \ntenants must submit the information necessary to apply for the program, with the possibility of an extension. \nCommenter said the housing provider should have to determine the household's eligibility for the program and issue \na notice of determination well before the time period for the tenant to remain in the housing expires, and there \nshould be an opportunity for a tenant to appeal an adverse decision. Commenter said the time period for \nestablishing eligibility should not be tolled until an appeal decision is final. The commenter said that alternatively, for \nremaining tenants who do not respond to the initial notice in a timely manner, the housing provider must send a \nnotice stating that the tenants have waived their right to establish eligibility for the current program under VAWA, \nbut such waiver does not preclude the tenants from applying for the program in the future.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: Because lease bifurcation is an option and housing providers are not required to bifurcate a \nlease, HUD declines to impose requirements, at this time, beyond those specified in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009 of this rule, as \nto how a bifurcation of lease process should occur. State and local laws may address lease bifurcation and, where \nthey do address lease bifurcation, covered housing providers must follow these laws. Housing providers, however, \nare free to establish their own policies on steps to be taken when a lease is bifurcated, and HUD encourages \nhousing providers to establish such policies and make these policies known to tenants.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Explain how lease bifurcation will work. A commenter requested clarification of whether the reasonable \ntime period begins upon an owner's initiation of a lease bifurcation, the date of eviction, or another point in the \nbifurcation process. A commenter asked where a PHA administers an HCV program, and terminates assistance to \na family member after determining that the family member committed criminal acts of physical violence against \nothers in the household, and that family member has signed the lease, the PHA is required to bifurcate the lease. \nThe commenter further asked whether the PHA, by the action of terminating assistance to the family member who \ncommitted domestic violence, could require the owner of the housing in which the family resides to bifurcate the \nlease. Another commenter asked whether a housing provider would be able to terminate the assistance and \ntenancy of the abuser immediately, and whether law enforcement would need to be involved. Another commenter \nasked whether the housing provider would need to obtain a court order to remove a tenant from the unit and \nremove the tenant's name from the lease without the tenant's permission. A commenter requested that HUD clarify \na PHA's specific responsibilities when a lease bifurcation is initiated by an owner, and how an owner should decide \nthat a lease bifurcation is appropriate and that an individual can be legally evicted.\n\n \n\n  A commenter said that, given that the termination of occupancy rights must be carried out in accordance with \nState and/or local laws, the rule's bifurcation provision does not provide a helpful tool for housing providers to \nexpedite dividing the family if both the victim and perpetrator have property rights to the unit and, in such cases, the \nhousing provider could only relocate the victim to another unit and follow a separate track to evict or terminate the \nperpetrator in accordance with due process procedures. Commenters asked for advice on how to address a \nsituation where the tenant and owner disagree about bifurcation of a lease.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: As stated in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009, the reasonable time period begins on the date of bifurcation of the \nlease; that is, the date when bifurcation of the lease is legally effective, and not at the start of the process to \nbifurcate a lease.\n\n \n\n  If a PHA terminates assistance to an individual because that individual was a perpetrator of a crime under VAWA, \nthat does not mean that an owner must bifurcate the lease if the unit has other household members. Similarly, a \nPHA cannot require an owner to terminate or bifurcate a lease where the PHA has terminated assistance for \n\n\n\nreasons unrelated to VAWA. Further, \u00a7&thinsp;982.53 of this rule provides that the owner, and not the PHA, is the \ncovered housing provider that may choose to bifurcate a lease.\n\n \n\n  For housing choice and project-based vouchers, if an owner bifurcates a lease, the owner must immediately notify \nthe PHA of the change in the lease and provide a copy of all such changes to the PHA. This requirement is in 24 \nCFR 982.308(g) for the tenant-based voucher program and 24 CFR 983.256(e) for the project-based voucher \nprogram. With the exception of PHA-owned units, the PHA is not a party to the lease and therefore cannot bifurcate \na lease agreement between an owner and a tenant. It is up to the owner to bifurcate the family's lease and to evict \nor remove the perpetrator from the unit. Under VAWA 2013 and as reflected in this rule, bifurcation of a lease is an \noption and not a requirement, so an owner would not be required to bifurcate a lease.\n\n \n\n  HUD notes that any eviction, removal, termination of occupancy rights, or termination of assistance must be \nundertaken in accordance with the procedures prescribed by Federal, State, or local law for termination of leases.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Clarify whether subsidies continue and who is responsible for housing costs during the reasonable time \nperiod when tenants try to establish eligibility or find other housing. Commenters asked HUD to clarify whether \nhousing providers would continue to subsidize units for those who are found to be ineligible after a lease is \nbifurcated. Commenters said that if the remaining family members cannot pay the rent, the loss of rental revenue \nand possible eviction costs is an additional financial burden for housing providers and asked for clarity as to who \npays the housing costs in this event.\n\n \n\n  Commenters said housing providers should work with victims to determine if they are eligible for a HUD program, \nand HUD should continue to provide housing assistance to tenants who are trying to establish eligibility for a \nprogram or find new housing. Commenters said that at the end of the eligibility period, owners or agents should \nprepare a recertification showing any changes in household composition or HUD assistance and, if the victim is not \neligible for assistance, the termination of subsidy or tenancy should not be effective until the last day of the month \nfollowing a 30-day notice period. Commenter said that not ensuring assistance for victims and their families will lead \nto evictions and homelessness. A commenter said housing providers should continue to pay subsidies until the \nreasonable time period has elapsed.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter said that tenants who remain in the units after lease bifurcation should pay the same amount \nof rent owed before the bifurcation, or, the minimum rents as outlined in applicable program rules, until the time \nperiods in the regulations to establish eligibility and find other housing runs out or until the family is able to establish \neligibility for a covered housing program or has found other housing. The commenter said that, for those covered \nhousing programs that do not have minimum rents, HUD should require that the remaining tenants in these units to \npay 30 percent of the remaining tenants' income while attempting to establish eligibility or while looking for new \nhousing. The commenter also said these interim rents should include exemptions for remaining tenants who cannot \npay because of the violence or abuse.\n\n \n\n  Commenters said the final rule should be clear that housing providers are not responsible for rent payments, and \nshould not otherwise incur losses, after a lease is bifurcated. Commenters said HUD should clarify that remaining \ntenants are responsible for rent payments and other lease obligations during the period when individuals are trying \nto establish eligibility for a covered housing program or find alternative housing, or HUD should commit to \ncontinuing assistance to the unit during the reasonable time period. A commenter said HUD should continue to \nprovide assistance for the amount shown on the tenant certification.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter said HUD should give housing providers additional financial resources commensurate with the \nreasonable period, and housing providers should not be forced to forgo rent, housing assistance payments, \n\n\n\noperating funds, or other funds that they would otherwise receive. A commenter said the rule should include \nlanguage that housing providers are not required to provide housing and utilities free of charge during reasonable \ntime periods.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD is able to and will continue to subsidize units or families, as appropriate under different \nprograms, after a lease bifurcation during the time periods specified in this rule (see chart explaining applicable time \nperiods earlier in this preamble). As previously discussed, HUD cannot continue to subsidize a Section 202 or a \nSection 811 unit that does not contain an individual who is not eligible for that program during the 90-calendar-day \nperiod following a lease bifurcation. HUD stresses that it is the covered housing provider's decision whether or not \nto bifurcate a lease under VAWA. HUD also notes that section 5.2009(c) of this rule encourages housing providers \nto help victims of VAWA incidents remain in their units or move to other units in a covered housing program \nwhenever possible.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Clarify any interim rent obligations that may arise from bifurcation of a lease. Commenters offered \nvarious suggestions on how to address any interim rent obligations that may arise following bifurcation of a lease. A \ncommenter said that rent should not be changed for remaining tenants who are eligible for assistance because any \ntenant in the unit should already have been determined to be eligible. Another commenter recommended that \nhousing providers be allowed to follow their existing policy for when a head of household or other adult is removed \nfor any other reason when determining interim rent obligations after bifurcation. A commenter stated that after a \ntenancy ends, remaining tenants have to pay the lower of either (1) an amount equal to the rent of the former \ntenant, or (2) an amount based on the income of the current occupant(s).\n\n \n\n  Other commenters said an interim recertification should be completed during the reasonable time period and \ninterim rent should be established based on the income of remaining family members. A commenter said that, if the \nremaining tenant is ineligible to receive a subsidy, the rent could be set at current market rate for a section 8 or PBV \ntenant and flat rent limits for public housing tenants. A commenter said that use of these rents would provide \nincentive for participants to resolve eligibility issues quickly and help protect providers from revenue losses.\n\n \n\n  A commenter said that while eligibility approval is pending after a lease bifurcation, HUD's rule should require that \nany increase in the remaining family's share of rent be effective the first day of the month following a 30-day notice \nof changes to the rent obligation. The commenter said this time frame is consistent with current rules governing \ninterim rent increases for HUD Multifamily Housing and should be implemented in other Federal housing programs.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates these suggestions, but existing program regulations govern interim rent \nobligations, and HUD is not altering the existing requirements for purposes of implementing VAWA.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Housing providers should have some latitude in allowing victims who do not qualify for a program to \nremain in a unit when a lease is bifurcated. Commenters stated that if a tenant is at the threshold of being eligible \nfor certain housing, for example, a survivor who will qualify for age-restricted housing in a year, the housing provider \nshould be allowed to let the survivor remain in the housing. Another commenter said housing providers should be \nallowed to continue to provide subsidy to a victim who in ineligible for a program based on such factors as age or \ndisability.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: The statutes authorizing the covered housing programs determine basic program eligibility \nrequirements. Tenants who are victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, will not \nbe eligible for programs for which they would be ineligible if they had not been victims of domestic violence, dating \n\n\n\nviolence, sexual assault, or stalking. HUD and housing providers do not have the discretion to depart from statutory \nrequirements.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Housing providers should not be expected to allow an ineligible family to remain in an assisted unit or \nto retain assistance. A commenter said HUD should not expect a PHA to allow an ineligible family to remain in an \nassisted unit, or in a market rate landlord's unit receiving tenant-based assistance, especially if HUD may not cover \nthe assistance. The commenter said that assisting an ineligible family creates a hardship and denies a unit or \nvoucher to an eligible waiting list applicant. The commenter said that HUD does not allow PHAs to maintain any \nfunding overages that could be used to assist an ineligible family for any period of time.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: Under VAWA 2013 and this final rule, housing providers that exercise the option of bifurcating a \nlease must give remaining tenants a reasonable period of time, as specified in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009 of this rule and \napplicable program regulations, to remain in a unit to establish eligibility for a HUD program or find new housing. \nHousing providers may evict or terminate assistance to those who are unable to establish eligibility at the expiration \nof the applicable reasonable time period.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Procedures to certify a new head of household should impose minimal burden on the family. A \ncommenter said that where the abuser was the eligible head of household and leaves, the housing provider's \nprocedures for certification of a new head of household should impose minimal burden on the family. The \ncommenter suggested that where there is only one remaining adult member of the household, there should be a \npresumption that that adult should be the new head of household and, where there is more than one adult, the \nhousing provider should be required to send notice to all eligible members, have the family select the head of \nhousehold, and establish procedures for when the family cannot. The commenter said that where the removal of the \nabuser leaves the family with no member who can qualify, a qualified person with physical custody of the children \nshould be added to the household to become the head of household. The commenter said the rules should absolve \nthe new head of household from responsibility for any funds owed prior to the removal of the abuser and PHAs \nshould continue paying subsidies until the substitution of the new head of household is made. The commenters \nfurther said victims may not be aware of their rights to have rent recalculated when the abuser is removed from the \nhousehold and should not have to report a change of household income, but rent should be recalculated and \neffective the first month after the abuser leaves.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD will not require PHAs to deviate from their current procedures to certify a new head of \nhousehold. Procedures for certifying a new head of household may be similar to the procedures for any family \nbreak up or death of the head of household, or for adding a new person to the family, and must be described in the \nPHA's administrative plan and other policy documents.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Explain how bifurcation will work with families with mixed immigration status. Commenters requested \nthat HUD explain or issue guidance on how to provide assistance to mixed family households where the sole \nhousehold member with citizenship or eligible immigration status is the perpetrator and has been removed from the \nhousehold through bifurcation. A commenter stated that, in this scenario, the remaining household members who \nlack eligible citizenship status would not be eligible for assistance and would risk losing their housing based on \nreporting the abuse. The commenter said that certain families will be able to apply for nonimmigrant status and \nseek temporary immigration benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act, but might require much longer than \na 90-day period to establish eligibility, and they should be given additional time. The commenter said that any \nextensions granted to mixed families under this section should be harmonized with \u00a7&thinsp;5.518, which \nestablishes the requirements for temporary deferral of termination of assistance for families lacking eligible \nimmigration status, and affords eligible families an initial deferral period of up to six months. The commenters said \nthat for those families who do not qualify for nonimmigrant status, HUD should implement procedures to waive its \n\n\n\nmixed family requirements to authorize victims without eligible immigration status to continue receiving assistance, \nand HUD should either waive prorated rent payment requirements for such victims, or issue special subsidies to \nassist them.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates commenters' concerns, but altering existing program regulations regarding \nmixed families is outside of the scope of this rule.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Clarify whether section 8 assistance can be bifurcated. Commenters asked whether a housing provider \ncan bifurcate Section 8 assistance and, if so, requested procedural guidance on how this would be done. \nCommenters said that, absent the ability to bifurcate assistance, PHAs would be left in an untenable position in \ncases where a voucher is issued to two individuals and one commits a VAWA act against the other.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: Tenant-based Section 8 assistance cannot be bifurcated because bifurcation relates to the \ndivision of a lease, not the division of assistance. The PHA's family break-up policies will apply in situations where a \nhousehold divides due to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Clarify that housing providers should not pressure victims to remain in unit. A commenter commended \nHUD for including a provision that encourages covered housing providers to assist victims, but recommended that \nHUD clarify that covered housing providers should only provide assistance to victims and their household members \nwho want to remain in their units, and should not pressure those who do not feel safe in these units to remain there. \nThe commenter said that, in these situations, the covered housing providers should be encouraged to work with the \nvictims to find safe and affordable units elsewhere.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD agrees that covered housing providers should only provide assistance to victims and their \nhousehold members who want to remain in the units, and should not pressure those who do not feel safe in these \nunits to remain there. HUD emphasizes that bifurcation of a lease is one option of possible remedy to address a \nfamily divided by domestic violence, and HUD's final rule at \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009(c) encourages covered housing \nproviders to undertake whatever actions are permissible and feasible under their respective programs to assist \nindividuals to remain in their unit or other units under the covered housing program. Individuals who do not feel safe \nin their unit may wish to request an emergency transfer if they meet the rule's criteria for requesting emergency \ntransfer in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e).\n\n \n\n  Comment: Clarify that covered providers may bifurcate a lease under VAWA regardless of whether State law \nspecifically provides for lease bifurcation. A commenter asked that HUD clarify that housing providers may bifurcate \na lease under VAWA regardless of whether State law specifically provides for lease bifurcation, but that the \nproviders must do so using processes consistent with Federal, State, and local law.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: Section 5.2009(a)(2) of the final rule provides that bifurcation is an option as long as it is carried \nout in accordance with any requirements or procedures as may be prescribed by Federal, State, or local law for \ntermination of assistance or leases and in accordance with any requirements under the relevant covered housing \nprogram. Where State or local laws address lease bifurcation, and these laws require bifurcation, permit bifurcation \nor prohibit bifurcation, and, where permitted or required, specify processes to be followed, the housing providers \nmust follow these laws.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Clarify that housing providers are not expected to act in ways that are not accord with Federal, State \nand local laws. A commenter stated that housing providers cannot guarantee that a judge will grant, or a local \n\n\n\nagency will enforce, an eviction where a lease is bifurcated. Another commenter asked how a PHA that operates in \na State that requires that public housing residents be evicted in court in order to terminate tenancy can only require \nthe HUD self-certification form when initiating the bifurcation of a lease. Other commenters stated that, since \nbifurcation of a lease is subject to State and local laws, this may create inconsistencies in actual application.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: As addressed in the response to the preceding comment, \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009(a)(2) of the final rule \nprovides that bifurcation must be carried out in accordance with any requirements or procedures as may be \nprescribed by Federal, State, or local law. Where a PHA operates in a State where public housing residents must \nbe evicted in court, then the PHA must follow that procedure, but that does not change the fact that in order to \nestablish eligibility for VAWA protections, the PHA must accept self-certification, unless there are conflicting \ncertifications. HUD recognizes that this means that there will be differences in how bifurcation operates in different \nStates or localities.\n\n \n\n  Comment: There should be a database or other online management tool to assist individuals in locating new \nhousing. A commenter stated that an individual who is seeking to bifurcate a lease and look for alternative housing \nwould benefit from being able to search for housing options on a government Web site.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD's Web page, entitled Rental Assistance, at the following Web site            \nhttp://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/topics/rental_assistance provides nationwide information on how to find \naffordable rental housing.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Do not mandate requirements to help remaining tenants stay in housing after bifurcation, but offer \nguidance. A commenter said HUD should not mandate a specific set of requirements that covered housing \nproviders must take to help remaining tenants stay in housing, as these may be burdensome and costly depending \non the housing provider's internal and community resources. The commenter, however, supported HUD providing \nguidance to housing providers, including recommendations on a quick response plan for eligibility determinations \nof remaining tenants, and coordinating with community resources to prioritize these families for rapid re-housing \nand other programs.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: Unless discussed elsewhere in the preamble, the only provisions on bifurcation in HUD's final \nrule are those required by statute. As provided throughout this section of the preamble that addresses the issues \nraised by commenters, HUD intends to supplement its VAWA regulations with program guidance.\n\n \n\n  Comment: After bifurcation, housing providers should take steps to ensure perpetrators are kept away from the \nvictim's unit. Commenters said that when a lease is bifurcated the owner or agent should work with the local police \nand legal system to ensure, to the extent possible, that the perpetrator is not allowed on property grounds, with \nlimited exceptions. A commenter said that once the lease has been bifurcated, unit locks should be changed \nimmediately.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: As has also been stated through this section of the preamble that addresses issues raised by \ncommenters, HUD strongly supports covered housing providers taking whatever actions they can to keep victims \nsafe.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Advise how housing providers can rehouse both victims and offenders. A commenter stated that in \ndetermining bifurcation policies, there should be consideration of how housing providers can rapidly house the \n\nhttp://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/topics/rental_assistance\n\n\nhousehold in question including both victim and offender, where the offender is not incarcerated or otherwise \napprehended for their involvement in a crime. The commenter suggested offering referrals to the offender when \nalternate living arrangements are not feasible, such as a referral to a community shelter service. Another \ncommenter stated that after evicting an abuser, a housing provider has the right to reject any future application \nwhere the abuser is part of the household, including adding an abuser to an existing household on the property.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: As discussed in this preamble, victims of VAWA incidents in HUD-covered housing will generally \nbe provided a reasonable time to establish eligibility for housing in their current units after a lease bifurcation. HUD \nappreciates commenters' suggestion for rehousing everyone in a household after a lease bifurcation, but declines in \nthis rule to require housing providers to take specific steps for rehousing household members after a lease \nbifurcation. HUD does not wish to discourage housing providers from choosing to bifurcate leases where it is \nappropriate to do so.\n\n \n\n  This rule does not adopt a policy that, after evicting an abuser, a housing provider has the right to reject any future \napplication where that abuser is part of this household, as this may be prohibited by State, local, and Federal laws, \nas well as HUD program requirements, and is outside the scope of this rulemaking.\n\n <h5>\n\n  8. Implementation and Enforcement</h5>\n\n \n\n  Comment: Strong enforcement of the rule is important considering the strong connection between VAWA crimes \nand homelessness. Commenters said that 92 percent of homeless women report having experienced severe \nphysical or sexual violence at some point in their lives, and upwards of 50 percent of all homeless women report \nthat domestic violence was the immediate cause of their homelessness. Another commenter cited statistics that 28 \npercent of families reported to be homeless because of domestic violence. Other commenters further stated that \nnearly 1 in 5 women has been the victim of an attempted or completed rape, and over 80 percent of women who \nwere victimized experienced significant impacts such as post-traumatic stress disorder, injury, and missed time at \nwork or school. Commenters said economic insecurity and the trauma that often follows sexual assault make it \ndifficult, if not impossible, for many victims to access safe, affordable housing options. Commenters stated that \nwhen survivors have access to safe and affordable housing, such access reduces their risk of homelessness, which \nreduces their risk of future violence. A commenter said that that women and men who experience housing \ninsecurity reported a higher prevalence of sexual violence, physical violence, and stalking.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD agrees with the commenters regarding the connection between VAWA-related crimes and \nhomelessness. Such connection underscores the importance of HUD and its housing providers taking all actions, \nconsistent with VAWA 2013, to protect victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, \nand to house them in the safest locations possible. Further, HUD strongly encourages housing providers to take \nactions beyond the minimum required by VAWA 2013, where possible and consistent with Federal, State, and local \nlaws.\n\n \n\n  To ensure implementation, HUD is requiring that covered housing provider keep a record of all emergency \ntransfers requested under its emergency transfer plan, and the outcomes of such requests, and retain these \nrecords for a period of three years, or for a period of time as specified in program regulations. HUD is also providing \nin the \u201cNotice of Occupancy Rights\u201d contact information for individuals to report a covered housing provider that fails \nto comply with this regulation.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Provide clear and robust guidance and technical assistance to housing providers. Commenters stated \nthat HUD must give housing providers clear and robust guidance so that VAWA is fully and correctly implemented. \n\n\n\nAnother commenter said that housing providers should be aided by manuals that cover the emergency transfer \nprocess and applicable time frames, and with manuals to connect victims with counseling, legal aid, and other \nservices to bolster social work efforts. Other commenters said that HUD should work closely with DOJ to develop \nVAWA guidance for HUD staff, including staff of HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO), for \nhousing providers, and for housing judges and legal aid.\n\n \n\n  A commenter said HUD staff and housing providers should be required to participate in annual training to ensure \ncompliance with VAWA. Another commenter urged HUD to consider significant technical assistance to PHAs \naround domestic violence and the VAWA regulations\u2014including education on financial abuse, as this may \nmanifest itself as \u201cnonpayment of rent\u201d for housing providers, notification of housing rights under VAWA, and \ntranslating forms and notices into other languages.\n\n \n\n  A commenter said HUD will also need to provide program-specific guidance, as implementation of certain \nprovisions will vary between programs. The commenter said, for example, HOME grantees and LIHTC owners may \nneed to add language to their tenant selection plans to handle transfer requests and allow a domestic violence \nsurvivor to have access to an available unit. The commenter said HUD will also need to provide clear guidance to \neach field office on how VAWA 2013 should be implemented across the various HUD programs, especially in \nregards to unit transfers, and provide a path for escalation if there are unclear or confusing situations.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates the commenters emphasizing the importance of guidance and technical \nassistance to aid covered housing providers in implementing VAWA, and, as HUD has already stated in the \npreamble, HUD intends to provide such.\n\n \n\n  Comment: HUD and housing providers should collaborate with others in implementing VAWA. A commenter \nstated that HUD should work with law enforcement and justice officials to determine the best remedy for a victim \nand a remedy that is consistent with the needs and wishes of the victim through a shared informational database. \nThe commenter emphasized the importance of a collaborative approach to client case management issues and \nstated that information data bases could be an important tool, where individuals consent to the sharing of \ninformation. Another commenter said that owners and agents should be strongly encouraged to develop a resource \nfolder of sources within a 15-mile radius of the property providing help and counseling services to victims of \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking. Commenters said covered housing providers \nshould work with local law enforcement to take all legal means to ensure that the perpetrator does not come onto \nthe property grounds, including getting a restraining order.\n\n \n\n  A commenter says there should not be separate duplicative requirements for LIHTCs, administered by the \nDepartment of Treasury, as HUD's HCV and PBV programs often coexist with the LIHTCs.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter said that many of the multifamily developments funded with HOME funds and expected to be \nfunded with HTF funds are also constructed or operated with resources from other Federal agencies. Commenters \nurged HUD to coordinate with these agencies so that, within statutory limits, a development is not subjected to \ninconsistent VAWA 2013 compliance requirements.\n\n \n\n  Commenters asked that HUD clarify that communities need to include the full participation of domestic violence \nand sexual assault experts in their Continuums of Care, and HUD or the State recipient should monitor how PHAs \nand CoCs have partnered with these experts. Commenters said HUD should release further guidance directing \ncommunities to ensure that the safety needs of survivors are met and that survivors can have preference in \n\n\n\nallocating housing resources. Commenters expressed concern that housing assessment tools that under-assess \nthe housing needs of survivors can reduce the number of survivors prioritized for housing.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD agrees with commenters on the importance of working with housing providers and other \nagencies to implement VAWA effectively. With respect to establishing databases, HUD cautions that VAWA 2013 \nand HUD's regulations prohibit entering VAWA-related information documenting or certifying to the occurrence of a \nVAWA-related incident into shared databases for confidentiality reasons, although this will not apply if the \ndisclosure is requested or consented to in a time-limited written release by the individual who submitted the \ndocumentation.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Victims of domestic violence should be supported with portable housing funding. A commenter stated \nthat the importance of housing individuals in violence-free environments requires a new approach to community \nhousing that precludes housing families in low-income neighborhoods. Commenter stated that victims of violence \nshould be supported with portable housing funding that can be applied to market rents to prevent the development \nof crime-riddled low-income neighborhoods. Another commenter said housing programs should attach assistance to \nthe tenant rather than the unit in order for the tenant to obtain continued, unbroken assistance in HUD programs. \nThis commenter said this is important for lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) persons who are uniquely \nvulnerable to limitations on where they may live and find work.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD agrees that tenant-based assistance may provide certain victims of domestic violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault, or stalking with more options for transferring to a different unit than project-based \nassistance provides. However, as noted earlier in this preamble, the fiscal year 2016 appropriations for HUD does \nnot provide funding specifically for tenant protection vouchers for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, \nsexual assault, or stalking.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Issue guidance for housing providers working with LGBT victims of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, and stalking. Commenters said guidance is necessary to ensure that people working with \nLGBT victims are equipped with the knowledge and cultural competence to fully implement VAWA protections. \nCommenters said LGBT victims have often been denied access to domestic violence services, due to \nmisconceptions. A commenter stated that transgender survivors of domestic violence are four times as likely to \nsuffer harassment and intimidation by law enforcement officers, and these numbers were even higher for \ntransgender women and transgender people of color. The commenter said that it is for these reasons that many \nLGBT survivors are less likely to seek help from the authorities or claim the protections that VAWA has to offer.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter expressed appreciation for the inclusion of LGBT persons within the description of individuals \ncovered by the statute in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2001 and throughout the accompanying appendix. The commenter said that, in \norder to ensure that LGBT victims receive the full protection intended by the statute, housing providers \nimplementing these regulations must be able to recognize LGBT victims seeking assistance, or facing termination \non the basis of criminal activity linked to a domestic violence incident, as victims may be arrested alongside their \nabusers. The commenter said housing providers should receive adequate training to recognize such abuse and to \nensure victims are eligible for an emergency transfer and are not unnecessarily denied housing.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD emphasizes that housing providers must provide LGBT victims of domestic violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, with the protections and remedies that VAWA 2013 directs be \nprovided to all tenants and applicants. Failure to do so not only violates VAWA 2013 and HUD's regulations, but \n\n\n\nalso may violate HUD's 2012 Equal Access Rule, which requires that HUD-assisted and HUD-insured housing are \nmade available without regard to actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Provide clear guidance regarding confidentiality measures. Commenters said that HUD, in consultation \nwith confidentiality and victim advocacy experts, should provide very direct and clear guidance, regulations, training, \nprotocols and policies that help all entities maintain confidentiality within their practices, and HUD should also \nestablish a complaint process for alleged breaches of confidentiality. Commenters said that CoCs that utilize \nHomeless Management Information Systems (HMIS)/shared databases for their admissions and distribution of \nresources often exclude victims of violence from accessing the housing resources because the survivor is being \nserved by a victim service program barred from entering information into HMIS or because the survivor chooses to \nnot have their information entered in HMIS for safety reasons. Commenters said service providers entering \ninformation into HMIS are not asking the appropriate questions regarding domestic violence prior to entering \ninformation into the shared database, and victims are often confused about what information they are \u201crequired\u201d to \nprovide and fear they won't receive these vital housing supports if they refuse to give this information. A commenter \nsaid confidentiality regulations must be cross-referenced in the governing regulations of the housing provider.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: Confidentiality measures will be discussed in guidance on VAWA. HUD takes seriously any \ncomplaints regarding alleged breaches of confidentiality in violation of VAWA, and violations of the confidentiality \nprovisions of this rule are program violations that could jeopardize the receipt of HUD funding.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Provide mechanisms for review for victims who believe their VAWA rights have been violated. \nCommenters said victims who have been denied, terminated, or evicted from housing currently do not have a \nfederal administrative remedy for VAWA violations, leaving many with no recourse in cases where they have been \nimproperly denied their housing rights under VAWA. A commenter stated that many covered housing providers \nhave not complied with VAWA's requirements to address violence in their planning documents, permit survivors to \nmove with their vouchers to a new jurisdiction for safety reasons, and provide notice to subsidized tenants \nregarding their VAWA rights. Commenters asked that HUD formalize mechanisms for enforcing VAWA rights so \nthat such rights are available to all who need them, and urged HUD to provide additional guidance for specific \nprograms on the available review mechanisms.\n\n \n\n  Commenters said formalized administrative remedies are required for several reasons. Commenters said that \nHUD's Office of FHEO's regional offices will only investigate VAWA violations that sufficiently present an allegation \nof discrimination under the Fair Housing Act. Commenters said there is no publicly available information regarding \nwhich staff at HUD, either in headquarters or the regional offices, will handle VAWA requests. Commenters further \nsaid there are instances where local HUD offices and housing authorities do not recognize the application of VAWA.\n\n \n\n  Commenters recommended that a special assistant or advisor within the Office of the Secretary be named who \nwould oversee coordination of VAWA implementation, including with programs not covered by HUD, and resolution \nof complaints of VAWA violations, and staff persons within each program covered by VAWA should be designated \nin HUD headquarters to respond to questions and issues with VAWA implementation and to address complaints of \nVAWA violations, in conjunction with regional offices. Commenters asked that the names and contact information \nfor these staff be made public.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: The \u201cFor Further Information\u201d section of this rule identifies points of contact in the covered HUD \nprograms. Additionally, HUD intends to identify points of contact in HUD's regional and field offices.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Comment: HUD should coordinate investigation of VAWA violations with Fair Housing Act violations. Commenters \nrecommended that HUD create a mechanism to ensure that complaints regarding a VAWA violation or a Fair \nHousing Act violation based on domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking are screened for \nviolations of both laws in order to ensure that survivors receive all of the legal relief to which they are entitled. \nCommenters said a potential model would be the joint review process established by the HUD Offices of FHEO and \nPIH in cases relating to public housing demolition and disposition. The commenters stated that because members \nof the public who experience violation of federal housing law most often pursue their grievances through the fair \nhousing process, all FHEO investigators should receive training on the intersection of VAWA 2013 and the Fair \nHousing Act. Commenters also recommended that HUD's Office of FHEO receive and investigate complaints of \nVAWA violations, as it is the component of HUD that regularly receives and investigates complaints from the public.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates the commenters' suggestions. Because of the variation in program \nrequirements and the need for familiarity with these requirements, each HUD program office that administers a \ncovered housing program will oversee enforcement of VAWA and all HUD staff in these offices\u2014at Headquarters \nand in HUD's Regional and Field Offices will be trained on VAWA's requirements. HUD's Office of FHEO will be \ninvolved in complaints where complaints also involve violations of the Fair Housing Act.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Ensure immigrant victims are able to utilize VAWA protections and access emergency shelters and \ntransitional housing. A commenter stated that the likelihood that an immigrant or LEP woman will become a victim \nof domestic violence or sexual assault falls in the range of 30 percent to 52 percent, and immigrant victims face \nadditional difficulties than other victims, such as potential dependence on an abuser because of immigration status. \nThe commenters said immigrants, LEP individuals, and certain racial and ethnic minorities have received services \nfrom transitional housing programs at lower rates than white and African American victims, and a large number of \nimmigrant domestic and sexual violence victims have been turned away from these programs.\n\n \n\n  The commenter said that one reason why immigrant victims have had difficulties accessing transitional housing \nservices is because several programs have imposed means testing as a way to evaluate eligibility, even though this \nis not required by HUD or other Federal law. The commenter said this is problematic for immigrant victims because \nthey may be incapable of producing the required documentation, such as the ability to secure work or proof of legal \nemployment. The commenter recommended that HUD include a provision in the implementing regulations for \nVAWA 2013 that prohibits all means-testing from programs that provide short term emergency shelter and \ntransitional housing programs for up to 2 years. The commenter said access to emergency shelter and up to 2 \nyears of transitional housing is essential for immigrant victims because it can take up to 2 years for an immigrant \ncrime victim to prepare, file, and receive an adjudication that provides work authorization. The commenter said this \ninclusion would reflect VAWA 2013's new anti-discrimination protections.\n\n \n\n  The commenter asked that HUD require all HUD-funded emergency shelter and transitional housing programs to \nbe open to all victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, human trafficking, child \nabuse, elder abuse and other U visa criminal activity without regard to the victim's immigration status.  (15)  The \ncommenter said that, in 2001, HUD issued a policy letter implementing the Attorney General's Order regarding \nPrograms Necessary to Protect Life and Safety, which stated that HUD-funded programs that provide emergency \nshelter and transitional housing for up to 2 years, are to make these services equally available to all needy persons, \nincluding individuals who are not `qualified aliens' without verification of citizenship, nationality or immigration \nstatus.  (16)  The commenter asked that this letter be updated to: Extend applicability to all Federal agencies \nfunding emergency shelter and transitional housing, and not just HUD; to reflect the full range of VAWA, T&thinsp; \n(17)  and U visa crimes covered by VAWA and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act; to impose any credible \nevidence standards, where no specific documents to types of documentation should be required to support a crime \n\n\n\nvictim's application for emergency shelter or transitional housing; and to incorporate federal anti-discrimination law \nrequirements.\n\n \n\n  The commenter also recommended that HUD and other Federal agencies establish grant conditions for \ntransitional housing programs that require compliance with Federal anti-discrimination laws and nondiscrimination \nagainst victims defined as underserved by VAWA. The commenter said that HUD and other Federal agencies that \nfund transitional housing could require grant recipients to revise their admission and eligibility policies to incorporate \nbest practices for promoting greater access to transitional housing for victims of VAWA crimes, or provide additional \npoints in competitive grant processes for recipients that have adopted such best practices. The commenter further \nsaid that all programs receiving Federal funding for transitional housing should be required to report to their funder \nthe extent to which they are providing services to immigrant, LEP, individual racial and ethnic minority, and other \nunderserved victims.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates these comments and notes that HUD, HHS and DOJ recently updated its \nguidance regarding Programs Necessary to Protect Life and Safety on August 5, 2016.  (18)  HUD will also review \nthe other proposals and consider them for guidance or future rulemaking.\n\n \n\n  Comment: HUD should classify VAWA victims as \u201cchronically homeless.\u201d A commenter stated that HUD should \nclassify victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, human trafficking, child abuse, \nelder abuse, and other U visa listed crimes as \u201cchronically homeless.\u201d The commenter said that, because of the \nhigh likelihood that domestic violence and other life-threatening crimes can cause homelessness, these individuals \nand families should automatically qualify as chronically homelessness and be eligible for transitional housing \nprograms and not be required to provide income eligibility documentation in order to receive services. The \ncommenter said that HUD's final VAWA rule should consider extending the chronically homeless definition to this \ncategory of immigrant and LEP crime victims even if they have not at the time of application to the transitional \nhousing program left their abusive home for a safe haven or emergency shelter.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD published its final rule on Defining Chronically Homeless on December 4, 2015, at 80 FR \n75791. This final rule results from four years of careful consideration of public comments and discussions with \nexperts on how \u201cchronically homeless\u201d should be defined based on the statutory definition of \u201cchronically homeless\u201d \nin the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. Public comments were solicited in response to a December 5, \n2011 interim rule establishing regulations for Emergency Solutions Grants Program (see 76 FR 75954), in the \nContinuum of Care Continuum of Care Program interim rule, published July 31, 2012 (77 FR 45422), from a May \n30, 2012 convening with nationally recognized experts, which was described in the Rural Housing Stability \nAssistance Program proposed rule, and the March 27, 2013 proposed rule establishing regulations for the Rural \nHousing Stability Assistance Program (see 78 FR 18726). The final rule defining \u201cchronically homeless\u201d explains \nthe rationale for HUD's definition.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Instruct grantees to update documents to account for VAWA protections. A commenter said HUD \nshould instruct PHAs to amend planning documents, leases, and house rules to incorporate a model emergency \ntransfer policy. The commenter said HUD should also instruct owners of Sections 221d3, 236, 202 and 811 \nproperties and project-based Section 8 properties to revise their tenant selection plans and review all tenant leases \nto ensure they contain language regarding VAWA protections. Commenters said that HUD should require State and \nlocal governments to revise their consolidated plans to address the VAWA emergency transfer policy obligations as \nthey relate to HOME properties. Commenters further said that HUD should urge recipients of HUD financing to work \nwith the entity responsible for developing Qualified Allocation Plans&thinsp; (19)  to include a plan that allows for \nemergency transfers between housing types. Another commenter said the final rule should require HUD funding \n\n\n\nrecipients to include steps taken to implement VAWA 2013's protections in consolidated plans and PHA annual and \nfive-year plans.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: As described earlier in this preamble, under this final rule, descriptions of VAWA protections will \nbe required in lease terms or addenda or contracts, as specified in the regulations for the HOME, HOPWA, ESG, \nCoC, and public housing and section 8 programs. Owners would only be required to revise their tenant selection \nplans in relation to this rule if there are changes to the plans resulting from this rule.\n\n \n\n  HUD's final rule does not require PHAs to amend their documents, or require State and local governments to \nrevise their consolidated plans, to address emergency transfer obligations. HUD notes that the HOME regulations \nrequire participating jurisdiction to have written policies and procedures that address several program requirements \n(for example, underwriting and subsidy layering or rehabilitation standards) while not requiring submission of those \npolicies and procedures to HUD the participation jurisdiction will need to comply with the new requirements. HUD \nreviews all of its grantees to ensure compliance with its regulations, and such reviews will include compliance with \nthese new VAWA regulations. VAWA emergency transfer policies may be reviewed during onsite monitoring of the \nHOME program by staff of HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD) in the Field Offices. As \ndescribed earlier in this preamble, this final rule provides that emergency transfer plans must be made publicly \navailable, whenever feasible, and always available upon request.\n\n \n\n  Comment: HUD should update its guidance and documents to reflect VAWA protections, and should update \nregulations when necessary. Commenters said once HUD has developed an emergency transfer policy, the \nrelevant handbooks and guidebooks should be revised and a HUD notice applicable to all of the programs issued. \nThe commenter said HUD should develop lease language applicable to all of the programs and require that \nrecipients of HUD funds adopt such leases that reference the transfer policy. A commenter recommended that HUD \namend the applicable rules relating to lease provisions for each of the HUD-covered programs and urged that HUD \nset forth specifically the regulatory language that is required to incorporate VAWA's protections and requirements \ninto the leases and to publish the required VAWA lease addenda. In addition, the commenter asked that \ntranslations of these leases and lease addenda continue to be provided by HUD. A commenter said HUD should be \ncareful to add or include VAWA provisions whenever changes to programs are made.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD will update existing guidance to reflect new VAWA provisions. As noted in response to the \npreceding comment and earlier in this preamble, under this final rule, descriptions of VAWA protections will be \nrequired in lease terms or addenda or contracts, as specified in the regulations for the HOME, HOPWA, ESG, CoC, \nand public housing and section 8 programs.\n\n <h5>\n\n  9. Costs and Burden</h5>\n\n \n\n  Comment: Housing providers should have some means of recuperating costs for damages to property associated \nwith a VAWA-related incident. A commenter stated that if damages to a unit are caused by an instance of VAWA \nviolence, the housing provider should be authorized to use reserves for replacement or residual receipts to repair \nsuch damage if charging the resident is not appropriate or if a resident does not pay.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: Means of recuperating costs for damages will vary depending on the HUD-covered program. \nHUD notes that under CoC program regulations, at 24 CFR 578.51(j), recipients and subrecipients may use grant \nfunds in an amount not to exceed one month's rent to pay for any damage to housing due to the action of a \nprogram participant.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Comment: Changes to existing regulations will result in increased burden for housing providers. Commenters \nstated that, previously, VAWA protections had to be incorporated into the Housing Choice Voucher Administrative \nPlan, the Public Housing Admissions and Continued Occupancy Plan, and the public housing lease. Commenters \nsaid that altering these plans or the public housing lease to reflect updated definitions and requirements involves \nproviding adequate public notice and board approval, and changes in the public housing lease also require that \nevery household in public housing sign a new revised lease.\n\n \n\n  Commenters expressed concern that HUD is publishing new regulations in a time of historically low funding, and \nsaid that it would be difficult to comply with new requirements. Commenters said that language in the proposed rule \nsuggests that the added cost to the housing provider is primarily paperwork, but the costs of administering the \nnotification and documentation requirements will be significant, and there will be costs in evaluating how resident's \nneeds must then be addressed, and then taking steps to address those needs. The commenters said providers \nmust establish an organizational framework to ensure compliance with HUD's VAWA regulations, including the \ncreation of a document management system, adoption of policies, and the training of staff, and the costs of these \nactivities are in addition to emergency transfer costs. Commenters asked HUD to consider how requirements to \nimplement VAWA could be made more efficient and effective. A commenter said HUD's estimates of burden hours \nshould take into account the impact on the housing providers that must take various steps following receipt of these \nforms.\n\n \n\n  A commenter said that, according to HUD's estimates, these new regulations will impact over 208,000 covered \nhousing providers implementing assisted rental housing programs, and will impose an additional administrative \nburden on those institutions of 4,392,189 hours annually, which amount to almost 2,112 full time equivalents each \nyear. The commenters said that, since no new funding is available, as a result of VAWA's reauthorization and the \nnew requirements imposed, housing providers' human resources will require a substantial reallocation of personnel \nto assure procedural compliance with VAWA and such reallocation will be at the expense of core assisted housing \nmanagement tasks at a time when funding for assisted housing programs is under extreme pressure. The \ncommenter said housing agencies already must make difficult decisions allocating human resources among \ncompeting critical tasks, and this proposed rule will add to those difficulties.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD is cognizant of the constraints within which program participants must operate in the \ncurrent budgetary environment, and in this rule has sought to minimize burdens on housing providers while \nimplementing VAWA 2013. HUD notes that PHAs are required to include any changes in the ACOP in the Annual \nPlan, and even Qualified PHAs&thinsp; (20)  that only submit five-year plans must still hold annual public hearings.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Clarify whether housing providers bear the costs for transfers. A commenter said that language in \nproposed \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009(c) stating, \u201c. . . and for the covered housing provider to bear the costs of any transfer, \nwhere permissible,\u201d is problematic, creates uncertainty and risk of litigation, and should be deleted, even though the \nlanguage appears to be non-binding. The commenters said that the term \u201ccovered housing provider\u201d is not defined \nfor this section and could be construed to mean a State entity. Commenter said that a mandate to have the State \npay for costs associated with transfers is not supported by statute, would be contrary to Executive Order 13132, \nand could be unconstitutional. Commenters further said that \u201ccosts of transfer\u201d is not defined, and this phrase could \nmean many things.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: The commenter is correct that \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009(c) is non-binding. The section says that covered \nhousing providers are encouraged to take whatever actions are permissible and feasible, including bearing the \ncosts of transfers. As previously stated in this preamble, housing providers will not be required to bear the costs of \n\n\n\ntransfers, but HUD maintains \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009(c) in the final rule to encourage housing providers to take whatever \nactions they feasibly can to assist victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.\n\n \n\n  Comment: HUD should clarify the obligations of small entities. A commenter said HUD provided only a cursory \ndiscussion of the rule's impact on small entities, and a passing acknowledgement that small providers may be \nunable to carry out emergency transfer plans or bifurcation of leases. The commenter said this concept should be \nhighlighted in the preamble of the appropriate section and also covered in the regulations. The commenter also said \nthat if HUD refuses to translate the required certification forms, the cost of providing translations would fall \ndisproportionately on small entities, a potential violation of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n\n \n\n  A commenter said the rule's definition of \u201ccovered housing provider\u201d should clarify that small providers may be \nexempt from certain requirements due to infeasibility, or at the very least acknowledge that there are limitations \nbased on the size of the covered provider. In contrast, another commenter was concerned about language in the \nproposed rule that states small entities \u201care not required to carry out\u201d bifurcation and emergency transfers \u201cthat may \nbe more burdensome, and, indeed may not be feasible given the fewer number of units generally managed by small \nentities\u201d Commenters were concerned that this language conflicts with the statute, which does not exempt any \ncovered housing provider from bifurcating leases or carrying out transfers based on their size. The commenters \nsaid that, depending on the situation, a small housing provider could be required to carry out a lease bifurcation, \neven though doing so is technically discretionary (e.g., in cases where there is a permanent protective order that \nexcludes the abuser from the premises). Other commenters said they do not believe that \u201csmall entity\u201d housing \nproviders should automatically be excused of any emergency transfer obligation and should, at a minimum be \nrequired to examine whether there are safe and available transfer options in their portfolios that could be offered to \nsurvivors. The commenters said HUD must also include a definition of a small entity.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: As HUD noted in the proposed rule, VAWA 2013 does not allow for covered housing providers \nwho could be considered to be small entities to provide fewer protections than covered entities that are larger. \nHUD's assertion in the proposed rule that bifurcation is not a mandate under VAWA 2013 or under these \nregulations does not preclude the possibility that any provider, including a small entity, may be required to bifurcate \na lease in certain circumstances under State or local laws. In addition, the fact that tenant transfers under the \nemergency transfer plan are contingent upon whether there are safe and available units to which victims of \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking may transfer, and smaller housing providers that \nown or manage fewer properties may not have the same abilities to transfer victims, does not mean that smaller \nhousing providers are excused from emergency transfer obligations. Small housing providers must transfer tenants \nwho meet the criteria for an emergency transfer when there is a safe and available unit to which they could transfer \nthe tenant, and must describe in their emergency transfer plans policies to assist a tenant to make an emergency \nmove when a safe unit is not immediately available for a transfer. As small entities are not statutorily exempt from \nany VAWA protections, HUD declines to define them for purposes of this rule.\n\n \n\n  With respect to the issue of translation of documents, as noted earlier in this preamble, HUD has stated that it will \nprovide versions of the certification form and notice of housing rights in different languages.\n\n <h5>\n\n  10. Other Requirements and Protections for Victims and Survivors</h5>\n\n \n\n  Comment: The rule and notification provided to tenants and applicants should provide that individuals can \nterminate a lease for VAWA-related reasons. A commenter suggested that a housing provider should be allowed to \nwaive requirements for 30-day notices to vacate where victims have provided documentation to certify their status \nas a victim and want to move to escape abuse. This commenter also suggested permitting housing providers to \n\n\n\nwaive requirements for a review of landlord history where contacting a previous landlord could put a survivor at risk \nby exposing the survivor's current location.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD's final rule maintains the provisions in the proposed rule at \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;92.359(e), 574.604(f), \nand 578.99(j), and adds a provision for the Housing Trust Fund at 93.359(e), that a VAWA lease term/addendum \nmust provide that the tenant may terminate the lease without penalty if a determination is made that the tenant has \nmet the conditions for an emergency transfer under this rule.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Clarify that housing providers should work with LEP victims to ensure they understand their rights \nunder VAWA. A commenter stated that, in the preamble to the proposed rule, HUD said its LEP guidance \u201ccontains \na four-part individualized assessment for recipients to use to determine the extent of their obligations . . .\u201d The \ncommenter said that, though this is an accurate description of the guidance, such language could encourage \nhousing providers to do only what they determine is the minimum required. The commenter said HUD should insert \nadditional language that states that, in situations involving domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and \nstalking, housing providers should do their best, given current resources, to work with LEP victims to ensure that \nthey are apprised of their VAWA protections, even if those attempts go beyond steps generally included in the \nrecipient's language access plan. The commenters urged HUD to emphasize that housing providers are to use \nqualified, trained, and professional interpreters when interpreting information concerning VAWA protections to LEP \napplicants and tenants. Commenters further said that it should be clear that covered housing providers have to \norally communicate with LEP individuals in their language, either through bilingual staff or interpreters. A \ncommenter said this is extremely important because LEP victims will likely have follow-up questions, require \nassistance with filling out forms, and/or need help accessing other rights and remedies. The commenter also said \nthat housing providers should be strongly discouraged from using friends or family members to interpret, absent an \nemergency; and alleged perpetrators and minor children should be completely prohibited from interpreting. \nCommenters said that the final rule should require housing providers to update existing language access plans to \ninclude provisions for specifically serving LEP victims and their families.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: Executive Order 13166 directs all federal agencies to ensure that programs receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance provide meaningful access to LEP persons. To ensure compliance with this direction, DOJ's \nLEP Guidance four-factor analysis applies to the programs and activities of Federal agencies.  (21)  HUD's LEP \nguidance complies with Executive Order 13166, and is consistent with the DOJ LEP Guidance.  (22)  Therefore, \nHUD cannot require recipients to go beyond that which is required by law. The HUD-issued LEP guidance does \nrequire that recipients take reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access to LEP persons. This may include \nproviding oral interpretation services, hiring bilingual staff, and providing notices to staff and served populations of \nthe availability of LEP services.\n\n \n\n  HUD does require all recipients to provide the appropriate language assistance to the populations that they serve, \nand adequately serve LEP persons without delay. As the population needs and capacity of each recipient differs, \nthe four-factor analysis is intended to be flexible to balance the need to ensure meaningful access by LEP persons, \nwhile not imposing an undue burden on recipients, which includes small businesses, small local governments and \nsmall nonprofit organizations. HUD does encourage that LEP persons utilize the language assistance services \nexpressly offered to them by the HUD recipients, rather than family or acquaintances.\n\n \n\n  Comment: VAWA protections should serve mixed status immigrant families. A commenter asked that HUD extend \nVAWA protections to mixed-status immigrant families, and noted that mixed-status LGBT immigrant families are \nless likely to report unauthorized family members, and survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault, and stalking may not seek appropriate action if they fear a negative immigration result.\n\n\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: VAWA protections apply to tenants in mixed status immigrant families as they apply to other \ntenants.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Abusive parties should be responsible for VAWA-related costs. A commenter suggested that the \nabusive party in a household be held responsible for the full amount of back rent, if any, and for the current and \nupcoming rent so that the victim can move on to other housing or remain in the home with a clean record.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates this suggestion but would need to study its feasibility and effects before \ncreating such a policy.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Clarify that VAWA 2013 provides the same or greater protections than previously existed. A commenter \nsaid proposed \u00a7&thinsp;5.2011 should be amended to clarify that VAWA 2013 provides the same or greater \nprotections to survivors than those that existed at the time of enactment of the first VAWA statute.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD agrees that VAWA 2013 provides expanded protections to victims of domestic violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, but HUD declines to add this statement in the regulatory text.\n\n <h5>\n\n  11. Limitations of VAWA Protections</h5>\n\n \n\n  Comment: Explain the change that VAWA protections do not apply for lease violations \u201cunrelated to\u201d an act of \ndomestic violence to VAWA protections do not apply for lease violations \u201cnot premised on\u201d an act of domestic \nviolence. A commenter asked why HUD made this change in terminology in the proposed rule, stating that the \nchange substantially limits the reach of VAWA protections by removing from such protection those lease violations \nor incidents that may be in some way related to domestic violence, and instead requires that VAWA protections be \npremised on an actual act of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: VAWA 2013 uses the phrase \u201cnot premised on\u201d to clarify that VAWA protections do not limit the \nauthority of housing providers to evict or terminate assistance to a tenant for any violation of a lease \u201cnot premised \non\u201d the act of violence in question. The change in HUD's proposed rule tracks the statutory change by providing in \n\u00a7&thinsp;5.2005 that nothing in the section limits any authority of a covered housing provider to evict or terminate \nassistance to a tenant for any violation not premised on an act of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault, or stalking that is in question against the tenant or an affiliated individual of the tenant.\n\n \n\n  HUD disagrees that the new language limits VAWA protections. The term \u201cpremised\u201d better conveys that there \nmust be a connection between the alleged violation and the domestic violence to trigger the protections of VAWA. \nIn contrast, the term \u201cunrelated\u201d made it more difficult for a covered housing provider to determine whether a \ntenant's lease violation was related to an act of violence necessitating VAWA protections. \u201cPremised\u201d is more \nexact, less discretionary, and less open to misinterpretation. The term provides covered housing providers with \nuniform guidance to protect victims of domestic violence, while continuing to administer their program.\n\n \n\n  Comment: There is inconsistency when VAWA protections will or will not apply and clarification is needed. A \ncommenter stated that HUD's proposed rule seems to apply a different standard of applicability of the VAWA \n\n\n\nprotections in defining those instances where the housing provider is prohibited from denying or terminating \nassistance, and the exceptions where the PHA or housing provider may deny or terminate assistance. The \ncommenter stated that proposed \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(b) says that the VAWA protections apply to victims of domestic \nviolence (applicants) and criminal activity \u201cdirectly related to\u201d domestic violence (tenants); but proposed \n\u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(d)(2) now says the VAWA protections do not apply to any violation that is not \u201cpremised on\u201d an act \nof domestic violence. The commenter stated that, in deciding whether the VAWA protections apply, housing \nproviders must determine whether the underlying act was \u201cdirectly related\u201d to domestic violence, or \u201cpremised on \nan act\u201d of domestic violence, but the act could be directly related to domestic violence without being premised on \nan act of domestic violence.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: The usage of the terms \u201cnot premised on\u201d and \u201cdirectly related\u201d in the proposed rule reflect the \nusage of these terms in VAWA 2013. HUD disagrees that the usage of these terms create a conflict in terminology. \nAs noted in response to the preceding comment, HUD interprets \u201cpremised on\u201d to mean that a logical nexus must \nexist between the alleged violation and the domestic violence. Therefore, the term \u201cnot premised on\u201d means that \nthere is not a logical nexus between an alleged violation and domestic violence.\n\n <h5>\n\n  12. Confidentiality</h5>\n\n \n\n  Comment: Provide technical assistance on maintaining the privacy of VAWA documentation. Commenters \nemphasized the importance of maintaining confidentiality and privacy with respect to a victim of a VAWA crime, as \nthe most dangerous time for a victim of domestic violence is when the victim takes steps to leave a relationship \nwith the abuser. Commenters said many victims are stalked for years after having escaped from their partners, and \nthe severity of this \u201cseparation violence\u201d often compels the victim to stay in abusive relationships rather than risk \ngreater injury. Commenters said victims need assurances of confidentiality in order to believe they can safely \naccess their rights and supportive options, and asked HUD to stress the importance of confidentiality to housing \nproviders. Commenters said that, as the transfer processes begins to be used, it is extremely important that all \nowners, managers, landlords, and PHAs understand their confidentiality obligations.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter said it would be helpful for HUD to provide technical assistance on matters such as: How to \nmaintain an auditable trail while also protecting the privacy of details of a tenant's status; whether VAWA \ndocumentation should be retained separately from the tenant file, and if so how actions such as transfers should be \ndocumented in the tenant file (for example, listed as VAWA or \u201cemergency circumstances\u201d more broadly); and how \nto maintain privacy in electronic records, including the new address for the household, and establishing safeguards \nfor information accessible to agency staff.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD understands the importance of maintaining confidentiality under VAWA and thanks \ncommenters for these comments and will take steps to ensure that housing providers understand their obligations \nwith respect to maintaining confidentiality.\n\n \n\n  Comment: All entities should be required to maintain confidentiality. A commenter said that, at various points, the \nconforming regulations for the covered housing programs state that confidentiality must be maintained by the entity \nthat obtains the information from the victim. The commenters said this language must be expanded so that \nconfidentiality is guaranteed even if a victim gives the information to the wrong party or a housing provider \nmistakenly gains access to this information. Commenters recommended that HUD's VAWA regulations state that \nany entity that receives the information concerning the victim's status as a victim should be required to maintain \nconfidentiality under VAWA.\n\n \n\n\n\n  HUD Response: HUD believes that the confidentiality provisions in VAWA 2013 and in this rule sufficiently protect \ninformation that individuals might otherwise not share with their housing providers, out of fear of disclosure, and \nHUD thus declines to change the confidentiality provisions in the rule as commenter suggested.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Clarify how VAWA's confidentiality protections will apply to shared databases. Commenters \ncommended HUD for saying, in proposed \u00a7&thinsp;5.2007(c)(2) that covered housing providers shall not enter \ninformation into any shared databases. Other commenters stated that, as coordinated access becomes a core \ncomponent of the housing process in Continuums of Care, there has been a move to utilize shared \ndatabases/HMIS. Commenters said HUD should clarify, in the regulations, that covered housing providers shall not \nenter confidential information under VAWA into shared databases, including HMIS. A commenter expressed \nconcerns about the reduced access to homelessness services for survivors who receive services from the domestic \nviolence program and do not enter the survivor's information into an HMIS/shared database. The commenter \nrecommended including a provision in the regulation that states a covered housing provider cannot deny a survivor \naccess to services for refusing to permit the inclusion of confidential information in a shared database.\n\n \n\n  Other commenters recommended clarifying, in proposed \u00a7&thinsp;5.2007(c)(2), that all methods of information \nsharing are prohibited, and cross referencing this prohibition in the Notice of Occupancy Rights. Commenters said \n\u00a7&thinsp;5.2007(c)(2) should be revised to say that covered housing providers shall not disclose, or \u201creveal or \nrelease\u201d such (confidential) information. Commenter recommended revising \u00a7&thinsp;5.2007(c)(2)(i) to say that \nsuch information could be disclosed when requested or consented to \u201cby an individual in an informed, written, and \nreasonably time-limited release.\u201d\n\n \n\n  In contrast to these commenters, a commenter said that the prohibition against entering \u201cany\u201d information \nsubmitted by the tenant to the covered housing provider into a shared database raises practical operating concerns. \nCommenters said that while maintaining confidentiality is important, covered housing providers must be able to \ndemonstrate compliance with occupancy requirements, including documenting requests for unit transfers, for \nexample. A commenter said many housing providers make use of software programs to manage tenant information, \nand, presumably, a simple notation of \u201cVAWA\u201d entered into a database field to denote the reason for a unit transfer \nrequest would not violate the victim's confidentiality, and such documentation should be re-considered by HUD.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: Housing providers must comply with any existing confidentiality provisions that apply to them, in \naddition to confidentiality provisions provided under this rule and any relevant guidance issued in accordance with \nthis rule.\n\n \n\n  HUD declines to amend the Notice of Occupancy Rights and these regulations to broadly state that all methods of \ninformation sharing are prohibited and to say that covered housing providers shall not reveal of release (in addition \nto disclosing) confidential information. However, as discussed above, HUD has revised 24 CFR 5.2007(c)(2)(i) to \nstate that disclosure must be requested or consented to in writing by the individual in a time-limited release. As \ndiscussed above, HUD believes that the confidentiality provisions in VAWA 2013 and in this rule sufficiently protect \ninformation that individuals might otherwise not share with their housing providers, out of fear of disclosure. As \ndiscussed earlier in this preamble, HUD uses the term \u201cdisclose\u201d to encompass revealing or releasing.\n\n \n\n  Rule Change: HUD has revised 24 CFR 5.2007(c)(2)(i) to state that disclosure must be requested or consented to \nin writing by the individual in a time-limited release.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Comment: Disclosure of confidential information may be necessary under certain circumstances. A commenter \nstated that the confidentiality provisions in the rule should be revised to permit disclosure of the fact that the \nindividual is a victim of domestic violence to law enforcement and other government or social services agencies, as \nnecessary, in order to secure the protections set forth in the proposed rule. Another commenter said blanket \nstatements about total non-disclosure are not realistically tenable, and perhaps some redacted version of the \nVAWA-related need for an emergency transfer or negotiated \u201ctermination,\u201d and some certification about non-\ndisclosure of the new location can and should be placed in the tenant file. The commenter suggested that this \nshould be the topic of a facilitated stakeholder discussion to more clearly identify and explore options and \nrecommendations from housing providers, victim advocates and others.\n\n \n\n  A commenter said that, because HOME-grantees are responsible for ensuring HOME-funded developments are \ncomplying with all program requirements, HUD must clarify how the housing provider can responsibly share \ninformation about a VAWA claim with its regulatory oversight agency without violating any confidentiality concerns. \nAnother commenter said it is common practice for housing providers to document in their business system requests \nand actions taken for administrative purposes, and covered housing providers may also consult with sources of \nthird-party documentation regarding VAWA incidents, including but not limited to police, court officials and/or \nmedical/social service providers. The commenter said the documentation of such incidences in business systems or \ncommunications with third-party verification sources should not be considered a violation of the confidentiality \nprovision.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: This final rule maintains the confidentiality provisions from VAWA 2013. Of the exceptions to the \nconfidentiality provisions that were enumerated in VAWA 2013, there is no specific exception for disclosure to law \nenforcement or government agencies. However, where disclosure of that fact that somebody is a victim of a VAWA \ncrime is necessary to secure VAWA protections, the individual requesting VAWA protections may consent to the \ndisclosure.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Clarify the scope of VAWA's confidentiality provisions. A commenter asked whether the HCV's \nprohibition from disclosing information about the specific covered act, which prompted the move, applies to the \nowner of the property being vacated. Another commenter said it is unclear why HUD is proposing to elevate \nconfidentiality of VAWA information above that of Enterprise Income Verification (EIV), which is arguably of equal \nimportance, and this raises liability concerns for covered providers who may make an unintentional error.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: VAWA's confidentiality provisions apply to covered housing providers, which, for the HCV \nprogram, include both the PHA and the owner. This rule's confidentiality provisions are mandated by VAWA 2013 \nand do not conflict with EIV system.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Explain where a housing provider must keep VAWA-related documents. A commenter asked whether \nVAWA documents have to be kept in a separate location, outside of a manager's office, or have the information \nmaintained in a file separate from a resident's file.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: This rule does not require housing providers to maintain VAWA-related documents in a particular \nlocation. Housing providers, using the resources they have, should determine the best strategy for maintaining \nconfidentiality in accordance with VAWA 2013.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Programs should honor and keep confidential a tenant's different name or gender identity marker. A \ncommenter expressed concern that individuals or covered housing providers may not understand the importance of \nan LGBT individual's necessity for privacy when dealing with gender identity markers or the individual's name \n\n\n\nchange. The commenter stated that disclosure may lead to possible harm, more trauma, and a reluctance to seek \nhelp if the survivor believes that they will be \u201couted.\u201d The commenter said disclosure by family members, the \nperpetrator, or others should be limited by the survivor's right to confidentiality, and housing providers should not be \nable to share information provided by parties who are not the tenant seeking protections.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: The rule's confidentiality provisions are those provided in VAWA 2013, and are designed to \nprotect information that any tenant or applicant shares with housing providers in order to obtain VAWA protections \nand remedies. All such information is subject to very strict confidentiality requirements.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Confidentiality provisions should be included in program-specific regulations. A commenter said \nrecordkeeping is an essential element in ensuring confidentiality, and confidentiality and documentation regulations \nshould be built into existing regulations for covered housing programs. The commenter said that, without the cross-\nreferences, the housing providers could maintain recordkeeping and information entering, storage, and disclosure \npractices that are built into their practices.\n\n \n\n  A commenter said existing regulations require PHAs to provide available information to a landlord regarding the \nprior residence of a tenant and information regarding prior tenancy history, and this can threaten the health and \nsafety of an individual or family that is fleeing violence or abuse. The commenters recommended changing HCV \nand PBV regulations on tenant screening at \u00a7&thinsp;982.307(b)(4) and \u00a7&thinsp;983.255(d) to say that the PHA \nshall maintain the confidentiality of any information provided by the applicant relating to domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, or stalking, and if the applicant is a victim, the PHA shall not provide any information to an \nowner or landlord regarding current or prior landlords, addresses, or tenancy history subject to 24 CFR 5.2007(c).\n\n \n\n  The commenter recommended that \u00a7&thinsp;91.325(c)(3) of HUD's existing regulations be changed to say that \nthe State will develop and implement procedures to ensure the confidentiality of records pertaining to any individual \nwho is a victim of family violence, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking under any project \nassisted under the ESG program, including those who have received VAWA protections. The commenter also \nrecommended amending \u00a7&thinsp;578.103(b) to say that all records containing protected information of those who \napply for Continuum of Care assistance will be kept confidential and that VAWA-related information will not be \nentered into shared databases, and to reference VAWA regulations in part 5 and the VAWA statute, and to \nreference VAWA regulations and the statute in \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;580.31(g), 579.304, and 579.504 of HUD's regulations.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD declines to revise the regulations to broadly state that if an applicant is a victim of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking, a PHA shall not provide any information to an owner or \nlandlord regarding current or prior landlords, addresses, or tenancy history. This prohibition could limit a PHA from \nproviding other landlords and owners with relevant and necessary information about a tenancy that is unrelated to a \nVAWA crime. Sections 982.307(b)(4) and 983.255(d) of this rule state that the VAWA protections apply in cases \ninvolving a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking for tenant screening in the HCV \nand PBV programs.\n\n \n\n  Section 91.325(c)(3), pertaining to certifications for the ESG program, and the parallel provision in \n\u00a7&thinsp;91.225, implement a certification requirement in the McKinney-Vento Act that is separate from VAWA \nprotections. The ESG and CoC program rules at \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;576.409 and 578.99(j), respectively, contain provisions \nabout the applicability of VAWA's general confidentiality requirements in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2007, and provide that the \nrecipient or subrecipient can limit receipt of documentation by an owner to protect an individual's confidentiality. \nHUD declines to include additional confidentiality provisions for the ESG and CoC programs, as described by the \ncommenter.\n\n\n\n <h5>\n\n  13. Program-Specific Concerns</h5>\n\n <h5>\n\n  a. Community Planning and Development (CPD) Programs</h5>\n\n \n\n  Comment: Documentation and transfer requirements for the CoC and RHSP programs should be consistent with \ngeneral VAWA requirements. Commenters said the preamble states that CoC regulations currently provide for \ntransfer of tenant-based rental assistance for a family fleeing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, \nor stalking at \u00a7&thinsp;578.51(c)(3) and documentation requirements at \u00a7&thinsp;578.103, and a similar option is \nprovided in the Rural Housing Stability Assistance program at \u00a7&thinsp;579.216(c)(2). The commenters stated that, \nas these regulations pre-date the passage of VAWA, it is important that they be amended to reflect the transfer and \ndocumentation requirements in VAWA, and HUD should ensure that the requirements are consistent to improve \ncompliance and provide greater protection for survivors.\n\n \n\n  Commenters said the documentation requirements in the CoC and RHSP rules far exceed the VAWA standard \nand will likely further endanger victims. Commenters said this rule should not maintain different and more \ndemanding documentation requirements for \u201coriginal incidence\u201d and \u201creasonable belief of imminent threat of further \ndomestic violence,\u201d but rather should simply allow a victim to attest to the violence or assault. Specifically, \ncommenters requested that \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;578.51, 578.103, 579.216, and 579.504 be amended to reference VAWA \nrequirements.\n\n \n\n  The commenters said that once these documents are collected it is essential that records are kept confidential, not \nincluded in shared databases, and any records to establish status as a victim should be noted in files by employees \nand then destroyed or returned to the victim.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: Section 578.7 of this rule provides that CoCs must develop an emergency transfer plan to \ncoordinate emergency transfers within the geographic area. Existing regulations, as cited by the commenters, allow \nfor the transfer of tenant based assistance to a separate geographic area. HUD maintains these provisions for \nmoving with tenant based rental assistance as a separate, but complementary, option that is available to victims \nwho are at imminent risk of future harm. In some situations, it may be easier to move an existing voucher than to \ninvoke the emergency transfer track, and HUD wishes to maintain this flexibility.\n\n \n\n  As explained earlier in this preamble, the 2013 reauthorization of VAWA occurred prior to the publication of the \nRHSP proposed rule and HUD will include applicable VAWA provisions on the RHSP final rule.\n\n \n\n  Comment: The ESG and CoC regulations should provide that recipients and subrecipients must establish a written \npolicy that allows victims to seek their assistance, and HUD should draft such model policy. Commenters pointed to \nthe \u201coptional policy\u201d in the proposed CoC and ESG regulations regarding how a survivor might prevent a landlord \nfrom taking unlawful actions against the survivor, and asked HUD to draft a model policy to maintain consistency. \nCommenters recommended amending \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;576.407(g)(4) and 578.99(j)(5) to say that recipients or \nsubrecipients \u201cmust,\u201d and not \u201cmay\u201d, establish a written policy that allows program participants (the individual \nbeneficiary) to seek the recipient's assistance in invoking VAWA protections, and adding that nothing in this policy \nprohibits the participant from seeking legal counsel.\n\n \n\n\n\n  HUD Response: This final rule maintains the option for recipients and subrecipients in ESG and CoC to limit \nreceipt of documentation by an owner to protect an individual's confidentiality. See \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;576.409 and 578.99. \nHowever, HUD no longer includes regulatory language discussing the \u201coptional policy\u201d because whether the \nrecipient or subrecipient establishes such a policy, the program participant would not be prohibited from asking for \nthe recipient's or subrecipient's help to ensure owners comply with the VAWA requirements that are incorporated \ninto their contractual agreements. Establishing such a policy is not a requirement in other HUD-covered programs \ninvolving intermediary parties, and requiring such a policy could result in administrative confusion for providers \nadministering multiple types of HUD assistance.\n\n \n\n  To assist tenants, HUD adds to the \u201cNotice of Occupancy Rights\u201d a provision notifying tenants that if a covered \nhousing provider fails to comply with the requirements in the notice, or the tenant needs assistance, the tenant can \ncontact any applicable intermediary or HUD.\n\n \n\n  Comment: VAWA incidents must be considered when determining whether a program participant is in compliance \nwith RHSP and CoC regulations. A commenter said that, in both the RHSP and CoC program, participants must be \nin compliance with the program in order to have the option to transfer their assistance to another community. The \ncommenter said it is important for HUD to provide guidance and training on the reasons why someone might seem \nout of compliance with a program, as the actions of perpetrators can cause a victim to seem out of \u201cprogram \ncompliance.\u201d The commenters said that for example many perpetrators control finances, which could cause victims \nto miss rent payments, and abusers may also damage property and exert other controls over the victim that result in \nviolations of program rules.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD thanks commenters for these suggestions and will take them into account for guidance and \ntraining to program participants.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Clarify whether additional lease requirements apply when tenant-based rental assistance is used for \nhomelessness prevention under the ESG and CoC programs. Commenters recommended that in instances where \nthe lease would be amended to reflect the rental assistance, the same VAWA amendments that are in the leases \nand rental agreements at proposed \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;576.106(e) and (g) and \u00a7&thinsp;578.99(j)(6) should apply. \nCommenters said that in instances where no changes are made to the lease, recipients and subrecipients should \ninclude the notice of VAWA rights in communication with the participant and in any communication to the landlord or \nowner. Commenters further stated that in \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;576.106 and 578.99(j)(6), HUD should clarify that owners and \nlandlords may continue to include the VAWA protections after the assistance has ended, as this will benefit \nsurvivors and also keep consistency across owners' properties.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter recommended that there be a lease requirement that the perpetrator cannot be listed on the \nnew lease, and if there is a restraining order placed on the perpetrator by the victim, the victim should be required to \nhonor that restraining order. The commenter also said the lease should require that the unit must not be \nsubstandard housing.\n\n \n\n  Other commenters said they do not support including additional lease requirements, as this can discourage private \nlandlord participation in programs and have the unintended effect of making it more difficult for all families, and not \njust victims, to find housing. A commenter stated that, for ESG tenant-based rental assistance, the subrecipient is \ncurrently not responsible for reviewing the lease between the program participant and the owner, and, structurally, it \nmakes more sense to have conditions of ESG program participation in the rental assistance agreement, as HUD \nhas outlined in proposed \u00a7&thinsp;576.106(e), and not require provisions in a lease. The commenter said that, \nalternatively, HUD could elect to not require either the rental assistance agreement or the lease to contain VAWA \n\n\n\n2013 requirements where there is only short-term assistance, which would be in alignment with requirements in the \nHOPWA program where per proposed \u00a7&thinsp;574.330, VAWA does not apply to short-term housing.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: If a participant is receiving ongoing homelessness prevention in an existing unit, the rental \nagreement between the landlord and the recipient or subrecipient will contain the required VAWA provisions. In \ninstances where a participant is receiving homelessness prevention in a new unit or a new lease will be executed, \nthen the VAWA protections will be incorporated with the lease and the participant will be covered by both the rental \nagreement and a lease and the recipient will have the option of extending the VAWA protections after the provision \nof assistance ends. However, HUD will not require the recipient to have to extend the provisions after the \nassistance ends. Some landlords are reluctant to work with individuals and families that are homeless or formerly \nhomeless and imposing additional lease requirements as a condition of accepting our funds that then continue after \nHUD funds are made available makes it more difficult to recruit landlords.\n\n \n\n  HUD declines to impose additional lease requirements, including that the perpetrator cannot be listed on the new \nlease and victims must honor restraining orders.\n\n \n\n  Comment: It is unclear how certain VAWA requirements would apply to ESG assistance. Commenters said that, in \nthe case of homeless prevention, funds are used to maintain persons in their rental housing, such persons are \nalready under a lease agreement, and it is not clear how VAWA provisions apply in this instance or how violations \nwould be handled. Commenters said that providing notice to recipients of ESG rental assistance should be limited \nto the period for which the assistance is provided, and the requirement to create an emergency transfer plan should \nnot apply to short term ESG assistance.\n\n \n\n  Another commenter said that it administers ESG funding for shelter operations, rapid re-housing and homeless \nprevention. The commenter said that, in the case of the rapid re-housing, it processes payments to owners and will \nassume responsibility for providing the recipient with a copy of the agreements with private owners who will provide \npermanent housing for the participant. The commenter said that it has no problem requiring the owner to advise \nwhen a notice to vacate is issued during the term of the agreement, but there is no mention of a penalty if the \nprivate owner fails to provide this notice and, since payment will have been made by then, there would be no \nrecourse to the commenter.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: If a tenant requests homelessness prevention assistance for a new unit, then VAWA protections \nwould be included in the new lease they are signing. The tenant lease will also supplement the ESG recipient rental \nagreement in this case. In a scenario where a new lease must be executed, then the recipient or subrecipient is \nrequired to put the requirements into the lease. The recipient or subrecipient has the option of writing the lease in \nsuch a way so that those extra requirements expire when the ESG assistance ends. In a homelessness prevention \nassistance scenario, the protections are in the rental assistance agreement so they would cease to apply when the \nrental assistance agreement ends, which is when the assistance ends. However, the recipient or subrecipient has \nthe option of writing the lease so that the protections continue to apply even after the assistance ends.\n\n \n\n  This rule's requirements, including the emergency transfer requirements, apply to both short-term and medium-\nterm ESG rental assistance. Even short-term rental assistance is assistance that would trigger the requirements of \nthis rule.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Clarify whether tenants in HOME-assisted units are covered by VAWA. Commenters said the notice of \noccupancy rights refers only to tenants who are receiving rental assistance, but the commenters expressed belief \nthat tenants in HOME-assisted units (who are not receiving rental assistance) are also covered by VAWA \n\n\n\nprotections. The commenters encouraged HUD to review the proposed rule through the eyes of a HOME-grantee to \nensure that all provisions apply appropriately when the federal assistance is used solely for development \nassistance.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: Section 5.2001(b)(1) of this rule explains that, for project-based assistance, the assistance may \nconsist of such assistance as operating assistance, development assistance, and mortgage interest rate subsidy. \nFurther, the revisions to the HOME regulations state that the VAWA requirements apply to \u201call HOME tenant based \nrental assistance and rental housing assisted with HOME funds.\u201d Under the HOME program, rental housing \nassisted with HOME funds is rental housing that has been newly constructed or acquired or rehabbed with HOME \nfunds. Therefore, when HOME assistance is provided \u201csolely for development assistance,\u201d VAWA would apply. \nHUD has revised the Notice of Occupancy Rights and the model emergency transfer plan to clarify that the VAWA \nrights, rules and remedies apply to HUD assistance generally for covered programs.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Confirm that HOME-funded rental projects begun prior to the effective date of the rule are not subject to \nthe rule, and provide time to implement requirements. A commenter asked for confirmation that \u00a7&thinsp;92.359(b) \nexempts HOME-funded rental projects begun prior to the effective date of HUD's final rule from the rule's \nrequirements. Another commenter asked that HUD provide an implementation period of at least four months to draft \nloan, grant, and covenant documents, policies, lease addendums, and other necessary documents.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: Section 92.359(b) provides that compliance with the regulations set forth in this rule is required \nfor any tenant-based rental assistance or rental housing project for which the date of the HOME funding \ncommitment is on or after the effective date of this rule. However, as HUD has stated several times, in publicly \nissued documents since 2013, and in the preamble to the proposed rule and in the preamble to this final rule, basic \nstatutory core protections of VAWA were effective upon enactment of VAWA 2013. HUD has made clear that \nregulations are not needed to make these core statutory protections applicable, and the core requirements do apply \nto HOME funding commitments made prior to the effective date of this rule. Therefore, HUD has amended \n\u00a7&thinsp;92.359 to make clear the application of the core protections at the time the statute passed.\n\n \n\n  As discussed in the DATES section of this rule and overview of changes, the compliance date for completing an \nemergency transfer plan, under \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e) or applicable program regulations, and then providing \nemergency transfers under the emergency transfer plan is no later than May 15, 2017.\n\n \n\n  Rule Change: HUD has revised 24 CFR 92.359 to provide that the core statutory protections of VAWA applied \nupon enactment of VAWA 2013, and compliance with the VAWA requirements that require regulations apply to \ntenant-based rental assistance or rental housing project for which the date of the HOME funding commitment is \nmade on or after the effective date of this rule.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Remove proposed effective dates for CPD programs. Commenters urged HUD to remove the proposed \neffective dates for VAWA compliance that appear in the proposed rules for the programs administered by the Office \nof Community Planning and Development (CPD) that restrict VAWA implementation to applicants and tenants in \nfuture assisted units or with future tenant-based contracts and rental assistance. A commenter said that HUD does \nnot explain why any HUD program would require such effective dates, and there is no indication that Congress \nanticipated or directed HUD to implement VAWA 2013 only for future tenants and applicants, especially since HUD \nimplemented VAWA 2005 for all applicants and tenants in existing as well as future assisted units.\n\n \n\n  The commenter said the proposed CPD effective dates are contrary to current HUD policy, as HUD has already \nreached out to participants in the HUD programs to advise them that the basic protections of VAWA were currently \n\n\n\nin effect, and do not require notice and comment rulemaking for compliance. The commenter said that in December \n2013, HUD advised housing providers with HOME funds to comply with the basic VAWA protections, so it is \ncontradictory for HUD to indicate in the Proposed Rule that VAWA only applies to units funded by the HOME \nprogram prospectively.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: As HUD noted in response to the preceding comment, the core statutory protections of VAWA \napplied upon enactment of VAWA 2013, to all covered HUD programs without the necessity of rulemaking. The \nHOME Program is different than many other covered programs in that: (1) HOME funds the construction or \nrehabilitation of housing and does not provide ongoing operating or rental assistance; and (2) HUD does not have a \ncontractual relationship with the housing provider\u2014the HOME written agreement is executed by the housing \nprovider and the HOME participating jurisdiction. The HOME agreement reflects the regulations in effect at the time \nHOME funds are committed to the project. There is not now and never was a requirement that HOME written \nagreements require project owners to comply with \u201cHOME regulations as they may be amended.\u201d HUD cannot \nrequire participating jurisdictions to amend existing HOME agreements and participating jurisdictions would have no \npower to compel project owners to agree to amendments. In 2013, HUD made comprehensive changes to the \nHOME regulations. Those changes are only applicable to projects to which HOME funds were committed after the \neffective date of the rule. The applicability of the VAWA in HOME is consistent with HUD's regulatory authority. The \nremaining VAWA requirements apply prospectively to all HOME rental housing for which a commitment of HOME \nfunds is made (meaning, the required written agreement is executed) after the regulation becomes effective. While \nHUD recognizes that, except for the core statutory protections of VAWA HOME-assisted rental housing is not \nsubject to the regulatory requirements unless included in the written agreement with the participating jurisdiction, \nHUD strongly encourages owners of HOME-assisted rental housing to comply with the regulations to the maximum \nextent feasible.\n\n \n\n  For similar reasons, except for the core statutory protections of VAWA, compliance with the VAWA requirements \nare not required for HOPWA projects with funding commitments earlier than the effective date of this rule, CoC \ngrants awarded prior to the effective date of this rule, or ESG rental assistance agreements that are not executed or \nrenewed after the effective date of this rule.\n\n \n\n  Rule Change: HUD has revised 24 CFR 574.604, 576.106, 576.409, and 578,99 to state that the core statutory \nprotections of VAWA applied upon enactment of VAWA 2013, and compliance with the VAWA requirements that \nrequired regulations apply prospectively to HOPWA funding commitments, CoC awards, and ESG rental assistance \nagreements.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Clarify applicability of certain VAWA provisions to the HOME program. A commenter said that in order \nto make clear that VAWA applies in the context of evictions in the HOME program, HUD should add a reference to \nVAWA in current \u00a7&thinsp;92.253(c), which provides that there must be good cause for tenancy terminations. The \ncommenter recommended that HUD state that an owner's tenant selection policies may not deny a family \nadmission to the HOME program solely on the basis of criminal activity directly relating to domestic violence. In \naddition, the commenter stated that proposed \u00a7&thinsp;92.359(c)(2) provides that the entity administering the \nHOME tenant-based assistance program must provide the tenant with the VAWA rights notice when \u201cthe entity \nlearns that the tenant's housing owner intends to provide the tenant with notification of eviction.\u201d The commenter \nrecommended that HUD's final rule add the requirement that the owner provide to the family the VAWA rights notice \nalong with the eviction notice. The commenter said it would be simpler and more efficient to impose the notice \nobligation on both the owner and the entity administering the program.\n\n \n\n  The commenter also said HUD's proposed regulations for lease bifurcation in the HOME program must be \namended to ensure that victims' protections after lease bifurcations are consistent. The commenter said HUD does \n\n\n\nnot explain why the general \u201creasonable time\u201d provisions in 24 CFR part 5 do not apply to the HOME program and \nwhy the different system in proposed \u00a7&thinsp;92.359(d) is necessary. The commenter said that by allowing \nparticipating jurisdictions to craft their own bifurcation policies, victims in the HOME program can have different \nlease bifurcation rights, and this will cause great confusion among victims. The commenter said proposed \n\u00a7&thinsp;92.359(d) does not reflect VAWA's requirement that tenants who remain after bifurcations be provided \nwith a \u201creasonable time\u201d to establish eligibility for the existing program or for other covered housing programs, and \nthis latter requirement must be added to the HOME regulations. In addition, commenters said that while proposed \n\u00a7&thinsp;92.359(d)(2) mentions that remaining tenants who cannot establish eligibility for HOME project-based \nassistance are entitled to at least 60 days to find other housing, this additional time to find other housing is not \navailable for HOME tenant-based assistance. The commenter also suggested adding language to the HOME \nregulations similar to what exists for the HCV program\u2014the housing provider must ensure that the victim retains the \nassistance.\n\n \n\n  The commenter said it is unclear why HUD included proposed \u00a7&thinsp;92.359(d)(1)(iii), and recommended its \ndeletion. The commenters advised that it did not understand why the VAWA protections for the remaining tenants \nwould differ if the existing assistance were tenant-based versus project-based. In addition, the commenter cited \nproposed \u00a7&thinsp;92.359(e) and urged that HUD, and not the participating jurisdiction, develop the VAWA lease \naddendum, as this may be the only opportunity for tenants to become aware of their housing responsibilities and \nrights under the law and is important for quality control. The commenter said the basic elements of the lease \naddendum can be modeled after the VAWA 2005 lease addenda for the Section 8 housing programs, and this could \nserve as a template for other programs newly covered by VAWA. The commenter said that issues that must be \ndecided locally can be identified and the unique information left blank to be completed by the appropriate covered \nhousing provider. The commenter also commended HUD for allowing victims who receive emergency transfers to \nterminate their leases without penalty, and recommended that this provision be expanded for the HOME program to \npermit a victim in VAWA-covered housing to terminate the lease upon a 30-day written notice, except this 30-day \nnotice would not be required in emergency transfer situations.\n\n \n\n  In addition, the commenter said proposed \u00a7&thinsp;92.359(e) states that the owner must notify the entity \nadministering HOME tenant-based program prior to starting a lease bifurcation, but the commenter is concerned \nthis will cause unnecessary delay. The commenter recommended the provision say that when HOME tenant-based \nrental assistance is provided, the lease term/addendum must require the owner to notify the entity administering the \nHOME tenant-based rental assistance when the owner bifurcates a lease and in non-lease bifurcation \ncircumstances before the owner provides notification of eviction to the tenant.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: It is unnecessary to add a reference to \u00a7&thinsp;92.253(c) to make it clear that VAWA applies to \nterminations of tenancy, as \u00a7&thinsp;92.359 of this rule clearly specifies that VAWA requirements apply to HOME \ntenant-based rental assistance (TBRA) and rental housing assisted with HOME funds. Similarly, it is unnecessary to \nspecify that an owner's tenant selection policies may not deny a family admission to the HOME program solely on \nthe basis of criminal activity directly relating to domestic violence because \u00a7&thinsp;92.253(d)(7) includes this in \nstating that tenant selection policies must comply with VAWA requirements.\n\n \n\n  Further, because a housing owner must notify the participating jurisdiction prior to initiating an eviction, the \nparticipating jurisdiction will be able to provide the notice in a timely manner and HUD believes it is unnecessary to \nrequire that the housing owner also provide the notice along with the eviction notice.\n\n \n\n  This final rule revises \u00a7&thinsp;92.359 to reflect the fact that, for both HOME-assisted rental projects and HOME \nTBRA, it is unnecessary for the participating jurisdiction to establish or implement a policy that specifies the \nreasonable time period for a remaining tenant to establish eligibility. The entire household must be qualified to \nreside in a HOME-assisted unit or to receive HOME TBRA, so any members of the household are already \n\n\n\ndetermined to be eligible. Further, being over income is not a permitted basis for eviction under the HOME program. \nThe owner will review the household's income as usual at recertification. Thus, there is no need to establish a \nreasonable time period for remaining tenants to establish eligibility for the housing if a lease is bifurcated. HUD \nagrees with commenter that \u00a7&thinsp;92.359(d)(1)(iii) in the proposed rule should be deleted and has done so in \nthis final rule. Similar to the provision in \u00a7&thinsp;982.315, regarding family break-up in the housing choice voucher \nprogram, which states that the housing provider must ensure that the victim retains assistance, \n\u00a7&thinsp;92.359(d)(2) of this rule provides that if a tenant receiving HOME tenant-based rental assistance is \nremoved from the lease through the bifurcation, any remaining tenant(s) are eligible to retain the HOME tenant-\nbased rental assistance.\n\n \n\n  HUD declines to implement commenters' suggestions regarding the VAWA lease term/addendum. The \nrequirement in \u00a7&thinsp;92.359(e) that a participating jurisdiction must develop the lease term/addendum is \nconsistent with HOME regulations, but this rule specifies what the lease term/addendum must include. Further, \nHUD declines to include a section in this rule permitting a victim in VAWA-covered housing to terminate the lease \nupon a 30-day written notice, which would not be required in emergency transfer situations. Such a provision may \nconflict with State and local law and HUD will not implement it at this time without seeking further comment. In \naddition, this final rule does not revise the provision in the proposed rule that the owner must notify the participating \njurisdiction prior to starting a lease bifurcation. The participating jurisdiction is responsible for compliance with the \nHOME requirements and, given this oversight role, a housing provider cannot initiate such changes without prior \nnotification to the participating jurisdiction.\n\n \n\n  Rule Change: This final rule revises \u00a7&thinsp;92.359(d) to provide that if a family living in a HOME-assisted rental \nunit separates under 24 CFR 5.2009(a), the remaining tenant(s) may remain in the HOME-assisted unit, and if a \nfamily who is receiving HOME tenant-based rental assistance separates under 24 CFR 5.2009(a), the remaining \ntenant(s) will retain the HOME tenant-based rental assistance and the participating jurisdiction must determine \nwhether the tenant that was removed from the unit will receive HOME tenant-based rental assistance.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Clarify applicability of certain VAWA requirements to the HOPWA program. A commenter cited \nproposed \u00a7&thinsp;574.604(c), pertaining to protections for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault, and stalking, and said that when authorizing the HOPWA program, Congress emphasized the similarity to \nSection 8 and commanded that the HOPWA program \u201cshall be provided in the manner provided under [U.S.C.] \n1437f.\u201d The commenter said that, therefore, as with the Section 8 program, VAWA must be immediately applicable \nto all current and future HOPWA units and tenant-based assistance, and proposed \u00a7&thinsp;574.604(c) should be \nremoved.\n\n \n\n  The commenter said proposed \u00a7&thinsp;574.604(f) provides that the HOPWA facility or housing owner is obligated \nto develop the lease addendum, but urged HUD to develop the required basic elements of the lease addendum for \nthe HOPWA program. In addition, the commenter said proposed \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(c) must be cross-referenced in \nproposed \u00a7&thinsp;574.604(f). Commenters recommended that this section permit a victim in VAWA-covered \nhousing to terminate the lease upon a 30-day written notice, which would not be required in emergency transfer \nsituations.\n\n \n\n  The commenters said proposed \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;574.604(b)(1)(i)(B) and 574.604(b)(2)(i)(B) must be amended to ensure \nthat the responsible entity provides the VAWA rights notice and the self-certification form at all three mandated \njunctures, and the \u201cor\u201d in this paragraph should be substituted with \u201cand.\u201d\n\n \n\n  The commenter also said current HOPWA program regulations permit the owner to terminate a \u201cparticipant's \nassistance . . . only in the most severe cases,\u201d and this should be expanded with a reference to the obligation to \n\n\n\ncomply with VAWA, and the current limitations on eligibility should be expanded to prohibit a denial of assistance to \na VAWA victim. The commenter suggested amending \u00a7&thinsp;574.310 to include these references to VAWA.\n\n \n\n  The commenter said language regarding admissions/eligibility for VAWA victims should be added to either the \ndefinition of an \u201celigible person\u201d at \u00a7&thinsp;574.3 or a new section in \u00a7&thinsp;574.310.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD disagrees that the requirements of this rule should be applied retroactively. As stated in the \nproposed rule, VAWA 2005 provided VAWA protections for victims under HUD's public housing and Section 8 \nprograms. Those protections were only expanded to the HOPWA program when Congress enacted VAWA 2013. \nThis was the case notwithstanding the provision in the HOPWA statute, which provides that rental assistance under \nHOPWA \u201cshall be provided to the extent practicable in the manner provided under section 8 of the United States \nHousing Act of 1937.\u201d (42 U.S.C. 12908(a)(1)). Nothing in VAWA 2013 suggests that Congress intended these \nVAWA protections to be applied retroactively by HUD. Accordingly, HUD is retaining the proposed regulation at \n\u00a7&thinsp;574.604(c).\n\n \n\n  This final rule amends \u00a7&thinsp;574.604(c) to clarify that, for competitive grants, VAWA requirements apply to \nawards made on or after this rule becomes effective. The proposed rule stated that VAWA requirements are \nincorporated in the annual notice of funding availability and made applicable through the grant agreement or \nRenewal Memorandum, but the VAWA requirements are incorporated into the program's regulatory framework and \nwill apply to competitive grants awarded on or after the rule's effective date because the grant agreement will \nsubject the award to the entirety of 24 CFR part 574 in effect at the time of the award. The requirements do not \nneed to be in the NOFA or made applicable through the Renewal Memorandum to apply to competitive awards.\n\n \n\n  HUD appreciates the commenter's suggestion regarding basic elements of a lease addendum, and HUD is taking \nthese suggestions under consideration. In this final rule, HUD clarifies that, consistent with other HOPWA \nrequirements for grantees and project sponsors, the grantee or project sponsor is responsible for ensuring that the \nhousing or facility owner or manager adds the VAWA lease term/addendum to leases for HOPWA-assisted units \nand eligible persons receiving HOPWA tenant-based rental assistance. Further, HUD agrees that including a cross-\nreference to \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(c) in \u00a7&thinsp;574.604(f) adds clarity to the rule, and accepts the commenter's \nrecommended change. However, as discussed in relation to the HOME program, HUD declines to include a section \nin this rule permitting a victim in VAWA-covered housing to terminate the lease upon a 30-day written notice, which \nwould not be required in emergency transfer situations. Such a provision may conflict with state and local law and \nHUD will not implement it at this time without seeking further comment.\n\n \n\n  HUD appreciates commenter's suggestion of amending \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;574.604(b)(1)(i)(B) and 574.604(b)(2)(i)(B) to \nensure that the housing provider provides the VAWA rights notice and the self-certification form at all junctures \nmandated by VAWA 2013. This final rule revises these two sections to say that the housing providers must provide \nthe notice of occupancy rights and the certification form at the times listed in paragraph (d) of the section, and \nrevises paragraph (d) to state that the grantee is responsible for ensuring that the notice of occupancy rights and \ncertification form is provided to each person in a HOPWA-assisted unit or receiving HOPWA assistance at each of \nthe times listed in the statute, as well as during the 12-month period following the date that this rule becomes \neffective, either during annual recertification or lease renewal, or if there will be no recertification or lease renewal \nfor a tenant during the first year after the rule takes effect, through other means. This is consistent with the general \nnotification requirements in part 5 of this final rule.\n\n \n\n  HUD accepts commenter's suggestion to amend \u00a7&thinsp;574.310 to include references to VAWA protections.\n\n \n\n\n\n  Eligibility of HOPWA program participants is governed by HOPWA's program statute. HOPWA assistance is \nlimited to an \u201celigible person\u201d which the statute defines as \u201ca person with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or a \nrelated disease and the family of such person.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 12902(12). HUD is not authorized to expand program \neligibility to VAWA victims, as the commenter suggests. VAWA victims are eligible for assistance under the program \nif they can also meet the definition of an \u201celigible person.\u201d However, HUD has provided some relief to victims in \ncases where the abuser is the person with HIV/AIDS. Section 574.460 allows victims in those cases a grace period \nto continue to receive HOPWA assistance, and an opportunity to demonstrate program eligibility.\n\n \n\n  Rule Change: This final rule revises \u00a7&thinsp;574.604(f) from the proposed rule to include a cross-reference to \n\u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(c), in addition to the reference to \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(b). This rule also amends \u00a7&thinsp;574.310 to \ninclude references to VAWA protections. HUD also revises proposed \u00a7&thinsp;574.460 and \u00a7&thinsp;574.604, at \nthis final rule stage, to include dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. HUD also revises these sections to \nmore closely track the VAWA provisions in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, for consistency with other HOPWA program \nregulations in 24 CFR part 574 and other regulations of other program covered by this rule, and for clarity. For \nexample, this final rule clarifies the following with respect to the HOPWA program: That the grantee or project \nsponsor is responsible for ensuring that the housing or facility owner or manager develops and uses a VAWA lease \naddendum; that the reasonable grace period begins at the date of bifurcation of the lease rather than the date of \neviction of the person with AIDS, and that housing assistance and supportive services under the HOPWA program \nshall continue for the remaining persons residing in the unit during the grace period; that the grantee must develop \nthe emergency transfer plan; that persons in HOPWA-assisted units or receiving HOPWA assistance must be given \nthe notice of occupancy rights and accompanying certification form during the 12-month period following the date \nthat this rule becomes effective, as well as at each of the times required by statute; and that the grantee or project \nsponsor is responsible for ensuring that the housing or facility owner or manager is made aware of the option to \nbifurcate a lease. Additionally, this rule revises proposed \u00a7&thinsp;574.604(c) to state that, for competitive grants, \nVAWA requirements apply to awards made on or after the date that this rule becomes effective.\n\n <h5>\n\n  b. Public Housing and Voucher Programs</h5>\n\n \n\n  Comment: VAWA regulations for public housing and voucher programs should mirror and reference the generally \napplicable regulations and those that apply to other programs. A commenter said the public housing and housing \nchoice voucher regulations refer to criminal activity \u201crelated to\u201d domestic violence\u201d and said HUD should include \n\u201cdirectly,\u201d in its discussion, as the generally applicable regulations refer to criminal activity \u201cdirectly related\u201d to \nVAWA incidents. The commenter said HUD must describe how VAWA protections apply to tenuous allegations of \ndomestic violence.\n\n \n\n  A commenter said that the language concerning lease requirements in HUD's regulations in 24 CFR part 966 \napplies VAWA protections if a \u201ccurrent or future tenant\u201d is or becomes a victim of domestic violence, but HUD must \nexplain its inclusion of future tenants here, as this section concerns requirements for leases with existing tenants. \nCommenters asked if the term \u201cfuture tenants\u201d refers to a different set of households than \u201capplicants.\u201d A \ncommenter said the proposed VAWA provisions applicable to public housing tenant leases is limited to an individual \nwho becomes a victim, but stated that VAWA requires covered housing providers to provide the VAWA notice and \nself-certification form to all applicants and tenants at three junctures, regardless of whether that tenant is a victim or \nan affiliated member of a victim.\n\n \n\n  A commenter said that under the current regulations, a PHA may exclude certain tenants from a grievance hearing \nbecause of criminal activity, but such exclusion should not apply to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, \nsexual assault and stalking, and \u00a7&thinsp;966.51 should be amended to reflect this.\n\n\n\n \n\n  A commenter recommended that HUD add language to \u00a7&thinsp;983.253 (Leasing of contract units) to clarify that \nowners cannot discriminate against VAWA victims and their affiliated individuals.\n\n \n\n  For the HCV program, a commenter recommended changing \u00a7&thinsp;982.202(d) to include that the PHA \nadmission policy must state the system of admission preferences that the PHA uses, including preferences for \nvictims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. The commenter said the current HCV \nlease and tenancy rules and \u00a7&thinsp;982.308 must be amended to reference the VAWA protections and any \nnotice of eviction shall include a notice of occupancy rights and self-certification form, and that the notice and form \nare required as attachments to the lease.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD agrees with commenters that the program regulations should reflect the general VAWA \nregulations in part 5. HUD recognizes that the proposed regulations do not adequately reflect the notification \nrequirements in part 5, in that they limit the responsibility to comply with part 5 protections to cases where domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking is involved or claimed to be involved, and the notice of VAWA \nrights must be provided to all tenants and applicants at the times described in this statute and rule. Therefore, this \nfinal rule revises \u00a7&thinsp;880.504(f), 880.607(c)(5), 882.511(g), 883.605, 884.216(c), 884.223(f), 886.128, \n886.132, 886.328, 886.329(f), 891.575(f), 891.610(c), 891.630(c), 960.103(d), 966.4(a)(1)(vi), 982.53(e), \n982.201(a), and 982.553(e) to generally note that the VAWA regulations in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L apply. HUD \nwill provide assistance to housing providers to aid in determining whether criminal activity is directly related to a \nVAWA crime. In addition, HUD adds a paragraph to \u00a7&thinsp;983.253 to clarify that VAWA regulations apply to the \nleasing of contract units in the project-based voucher program.\n\n \n\n  This final rule does not revise \u00a7&thinsp;966.51 as a commenter suggested. If a tenant is excluded from a \ngrievance hearing, under \u00a7&thinsp;966.51, that tenant is still entitled to a due process determination and the \nopportunity for a hearing in court.\n\n \n\n  This rule also does not amend \u00a7&thinsp;982.202(d), as \u00a7&thinsp;982.207(b)(4) already states that PHAs should \nconsider whether to adopt a local preference for admission of families that include victims of domestic violence. \nThis final rule does, however, amend \u00a7&thinsp;982.207(b)(4) (on preferences for victims of domestic violence in \nthe housing choice voucher program), as well as \u00a7&thinsp;960.206(b)(4) (on preferences for victims of domestic \nviolence in public housing) to clarify that preferences may be established not only for victims of domestic violence, \nbut also for victims of dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.\n\n \n\n  It is unnecessary to amend \u00a7&thinsp;982.308 as a commenter suggested because, as explained earlier in this \npreamble, this final rule maintains existing 24 CFR 5.2005(a)(4), which says that the HUD-required lease, lease \naddendum, or tenancy addendum must include a description of specific protections for victims of VAWA crimes, for \nprograms covered by VAWA prior to the 2013 reauthorization. Further, \u00a7&thinsp;982.53(e) specifies that the PHA \nmust apply VAWA protections, which includes the provision of the notice of VAWA rights and certification form with \nnotification of eviction.\n\n \n\n  Rule Change: Sections 880.504(f), 880.607(c)(5), 882.511(g), 883.605, 884.216(c), 884.223(f), 886.128, 886.132, \n886.328, 886.329(f), 891.575(f), 891.610(c), 891.630(c), 960.103(d), 966.4(a)(1)(vi), 982.53(e), and 982.553(e) are \nrevised to generally state that 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating \nViolence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) applies.\n\n \n\n\n\n  This final rule adds \u00a7&thinsp;983.253(a)(4), which says that in selecting tenants, an owner must comply with \nHUD's regulations in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protections for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, \nSexual Assault, or Stalking).\n\n \n\n  This rule amends \u00a7&thinsp;982.207(b)(4) (preferences for victims of domestic violence in the housing choice \nvoucher program), as well as \u00a7&thinsp;960.206(b)(4) (on preferences for victims of domestic violence in public \nhousing) to clarify that preferences may be established not only for victims of domestic violence, but also for \nvictims of dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Portability requirements should not be overly restrictive for victims of sexual assault. A commenter said \nthe HUD rules on portability of vouchers allow a victim of sexual assault to be protected if the assault occurred \nwithin the prior 90 days and on the project premises. The commenter said this requirement is too restrictive \nbecause the presence or proximity of an offender can cause continued or new safety concerns for the victim after \n90 days and PHAs should be encouraged to apply a longer time frame when necessary. The commenter \nrecommended amending \u00a7&thinsp;982.353 to say it does not prohibit a PHA or owner from increasing the \nprotections for victims of sexual assault by increasing the time period within which the sexual assault occurred or \nexpanding the location within which the sexual assault occurred.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: Section 982.314(b)(4) of the proposed rule, which as described earlier, has been redesignated \nas \u00a7&thinsp;982.354(b)(4) following publication of HUD's August, 2015 Portability Rule at 80 FR 50564, follows the \ntransfer provisions in VAWA 2013 and this rule. The provision applies to victims of sexual assault if they either \nreasonably believe they are threatened with imminent harm from further violence if they remain in the unit, or if the \nsexual assault occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's move or request \nto move. Therefore, victims of sexual assault who have safety concerns might be able to move under this provision \neven if the sexual assault occurred more than 90 days before the move or the request to move.\n\n \n\n  Rule Change: HUD revises redesignated \u00a7&thinsp;982.354(b)(4) in this final rule to clarify that the provision \napplies if the family or a member of the family, is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, \nsexual assault, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, \nDating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), and the move is needed to protect the health or safety of the family \nor family member, or if any family member has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises \nduring the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's request to move.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Certain public housing and voucher program regulations are unclear. A commenter said proposed \n\u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;982.314, 982.315, and 982.353 are overly complicated in that housing providers may need to determine \nif a move is necessary to protect health and safety; if a family believed that the move was for that purpose; and if \nfamily members believed that they were in imminent threat of harm, and housing providers need guidance on this. \nAnother commenter questioned the use of the words \u201capplicable\u201d and \u201callegedly\u201d in proposed \u00a7&thinsp;960.103(d), \nand said that use of the word \u201callegedly\u201d raises issues about whether acts should first be proven. A commenter \nasked HUD to distinguish more clearly a PHA's responsibilities under tenant-based and project-based rental \nassistance programs.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: As noted earlier in this preamble, this final rule revises \u00a7&thinsp;960.103(d), which no longer \nincludes the words \u201capplicable\u201d or \u201callegedly.\u201d Covered housing providers must consider tenants and applicants to \nbe victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking if they submit documentation in \naccordance with \u00a7&thinsp;5.2007 of this rule. In addition, as stated earlier in this preamble, HUD will provide \nguidance on the responsibilities of housing providers in different HUD programs where necessary.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Comment: The rule may discourage owners from participating in the HCV program. A commenter said proposed \n\u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;982.53, 982.310, 982.314 contain clarifications as to which responsibilities for compliance rest with the \nPHA and which ones rest with the owner. The commenter said that while the burden is on the PHA, the impact on \nthe owner may still reduce the number of participating owners.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD has sought to minimize the burden on owners participating in the HCV program while still \nadhering to the requirements of VAWA.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Ensure regulatory policies are incorporated in PHA documents. A commenter stated that proposed \n\u00a7&thinsp;982.315(a)(2) states in part that the PHA must ensure that the victim retains assistance. The commenter \nsaid this language should be mandatory in administrative plans and other policies.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: PHAs may incorporate the language of \u00a7&thinsp;982.315(a)(2) or similar language into their \nadministrative plans. PHAs must comply with all HCV program requirements whether or not they are specified in \ntheir administrative plans, and HUD does not mandate that all applicable regulations are included in plans.\n\n \n\n  Comment: The regulations should incorporate proposed guidance on VAWA in the HUD-VASH program. \nCommenters said HUD should incorporate into the proposed regulations the guidance it has issued in its Q&As on \nthe HUD-VASH program; specifically, that in cases where the VASH voucher recipient has been terminated for \ncommitting a VAWA act, the remaining victim should be issued a Section 8 voucher if one is available, or, if one is \nnot available, should be authorized to continue utilizing the VASH voucher up until the voucher's turnover.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: Guidance is generally not appropriate for regulatory text. The regulatory text is to advise what \nactions are required. As HUD has stated throughout the preamble, HUD intends to supplement its VAWA \nregulations with guidance.\n\n <h5>\n\n  c. FHA Programs</h5>\n\n \n\n  Comment: Ensure that VAWA protections apply to all parts of the Section 236 and 221(d)(3) and (d)(5) BMIR \nprograms. A commenter said the program regulations for the Section 236 program do not explicitly cross reference \nto the regulations in 24 CFR part 200, and recommended that in 24 CFR 236.1, HUD insert a cross-reference to \nproposed \u00a7&thinsp;200.38. The commenter also said the eviction rules in 24 CFR part 247 that are explicitly made \napplicable to the Section 236, 221(d)(3) & (d)(5) BMIR, and 202 programs by \u00a7&thinsp;247.2 must be amended to \ninclude VAWA protections, particularly the primary rule governing good cause for eviction at 24 CFR 247.3.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: Section 200.38 explicitly provides that VAWA applies to the Section 236 program and the cross-\nreference in \u00a7&thinsp;236.1 is unnecessary. For greater clarity, however, this rule adds a provision in \n\u00a7&thinsp;247.1 that notes that covered housing providers are subject to VAWA requirements. HUD also notes that \nwhile VAWA applies to Section 221(d)(3)/221(d)(5) and Section 236, these programs are no longer active programs \n(i.e. no new grants are being distributed). However, there may be a few of such projects still in existence and a \nnumber of section 236 projects enter new contracts with HUD when they decouple their Interest Reduction Payment \n(IRP), enter into a five-year use agreement extension required in an IRP decoupling, or choice to participate in \nRAD. Many 221(d)(3)/(d)(5) and 236 projects also receive Section 8 funding. In the case that a project is \nparticipating in RAD or receives Section 8 funding, the requirements for those programs would govern the treatment \n\n\n\nof tenants for purposes of VAWA. In cases where there is no Section 8 funding, and a 236 project is entering into a \nnew contract with HUD, the owner must ensure that VAWA requirements are being followed.\n\n \n\n  Rule Change: Section 247.1 (Applicability) is revised to include a paragraph explaining that landlords of subsidized \nprojects that are listed as covered housing programs in 24 CFR 5.2003 must comply with 24 CFR part 5, subpart L \n(Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking).\n\n <h5>\n\n  d. Multifamily Programs</h5>\n\n \n\n  Comment: Section 811 regulations should allow for continued assistance in the event of a VAWA incident. A \ncommenter said that, for Section 811, HUD should provide a period of stability for those households that have \nexperienced domestic violence and should amend its regulations and guidance to state that if the qualifying tenant \nleaves the unit, the owner can continue to receive the assistance for the remaining members of the household \nduring the requalification period. The commenter said this approach would align with the change that HUD \nproposed to make for HOPWA program, where previously continuance of assistance was only allowed in the case \nof the death of the qualified tenant.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: The HOPWA program allows for tenants to retain assistance under certain circumstances when \nthe qualifying tenant no longer resides in the unit, but, as explained earlier in this preamble, the Section 811 \nprogram does not provide that flexibility.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Integrate VAWA into the program-specific regulations. A commenter recommended changing the \nprogram-specific regulations at 24 CFR parts 880, 882, 883, 884, 886, and 891 so that the VAWA requirements are \nfully implemented in all the programs.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: The references to 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, in these regulations ensure that VAWA \nrequirements are implemented in specific programs.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Clarify VAWA protections in project-based section 8 regulations and lease addenda. A commenter said \nthat for all project-based section 8 programs, HUD should identify correctly who the covered housing provider(s) \nare, and the VAWA lease addenda for these programs should include copies of the VAWA rights notice and \ncertification form, as well as language informing tenants that they must be given the notice and form at the three \njunctures required by the statute.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: This final rule revises the definition of covered housing provider for the project-based section 8 \nprograms. As also discussed earlier in the preamble, this final rule maintains existing 24 CFR 5.2005(a)(4) for \nprograms covered by VAWA prior to the 2013 reauthorization, which include the project-based section 8 \nregulations. This provision states that the HUD-required lease, lease addendum, or tenancy addendum, as \napplicable, must include a description of specific protections afforded to the victims of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L.\n\n <h5>\n\n  e. Cross-Cutting Program Comments</h5>\n\n \n\n\n\n  Comment: The \u201cfamily break up\u201d rule set forth in the HCV and HOME regulations should be included in the rules \nfor all of the HUD-covered housing programs. A commenter said the most critical aspect of the HCV \u201cfamily break \nup\u201d rule is that it clearly states that if the family breakup results from an occurrence of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, or stalking, the housing provider must ensure that the victim retains the assistance. The \ncommenter said the factors to be considered in the event of family breakup in making the decision to allocate \nassistance should be included in VAWA rules for all HUD-covered housing programs. The commenter said the \nHOME rule at proposed \u00a7&thinsp;92.359 permits the housing provider to determine that after a family breakup, both \nnewly formed families could receive assistance.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD agrees that clear standards would help to expedite allocation of a family's TBRA and \npreserve that assistance for the victim when a family receiving TBRA separates during an emergency transfer. \nTherefore, this final rule provides that, where applicable, the emergency transfer plan must describe policies for a \ntenant who has tenant-based rental assistance and qualifies for an emergency transfer to move quickly with that \nassistance. The program rules for the ESG and CoC programs are also amended to ensure that the emergency \ntransfer plan addresses what happens with respect to any family member(s) excluded from the emergency transfer. \nThe final rule further specifies that when a family receiving TBRA splits via bifurcation the family's TBRA will \ncontinue for the family member(s) who qualified for the VAWA remedy.\n\n \n\n  For HOME, this rule, similar to ESG and CoC program language, clarifies that if a family living in a HOME-assisted \nrental unit separates under the rule's bifurcation provisions, the remaining tenant(s) are eligible to remain in the \nHOME-assisted unit, and if a family who is receiving HOME tenant-based rental assistance separates under the \nrule's bifurcation provisions, the remaining tenant(s) will retain the HOME tenant-based rental assistance and the \nparticipating jurisdiction must determine whether the tenant that was removed from the unit will receive HOME \ntenant-based rental assistance.\n\n \n\n  Rule Change: HUD changes the emergency transfer provision in 24 CFR 5.2005(e)(9) to provide that, where \napplicable, the emergency transfer plan must describe policies for a tenant who has tenant-based rental assistance \nand qualifies for an emergency transfer to move quickly with that assistance. HUD also makes related changes to \nthe ESG and CoC regulations to both protect the victim's housing or assistance and address what happens to the \nnon-transferring family member(s) when a family separates in those programs at \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;576.409(d)-(e) and \n578.99(j)(7)-(8).\n\n \n\n  Comment: Ensure consistent VAWA occupancy requirements and rights. A Commenter said the proposed rules \nconforming VAWA to the individual programs fairly consistently address the applicability of VAWA at admission, \neviction, and termination, but there is less consistency to the applicability of VAWA to occupancy rights. The \ncommenter recommended that HUD ensure that language concerning occupancy requirements and rights under \nVAWA is consistent.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: HUD appreciates commenter's concern and has maintained consistency across program \nrequirements where possible, while trying to afford victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, \nand stalking, with the greatest level of protections possible under both VAWA and particular program requirements.\n\n \n\n  Comment: Provided that in the event of conflict with other regulations, VAWA regulations control. A commenter \nasked HUD to adopt an overarching policy statement indicating that any interpretation of a covered housing \nprogram's regulations should include a presumption that the VAWA regulations govern in the event of conflict. The \ncommenter said many HUD programs have regulations with multiple or overlapping provisions relating to \nadmission, selection, and occupancy rights, eviction and termination, and HUD's proposed VAWA rule did not apply \nVAWA requirements to all. The commenter said that to ensure that VAWA is fully implemented in all aspects of \n\n\n\nthese programs; each program regulation should have a clause stating that in the event of conflict, the VAWA \nregulations shall control.\n\n \n\n  HUD Response: Unlike VAWA 2005, which amended the laws for public housing and Section 8 programs, VAWA \n2013 did not amend the statutory authority for any housing program, and therefore HUD is unable to include the \nlanguage the commenters recommend.\n\n <h3>\n\n  III. Paperwork Reduction Act</h3>\n\n <h4>\n\n  Paperwork Reduction Act</h4>\n\n \n\n  The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been submitted to the Office of Management \nand Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520) for review and approval.\n\n <h3>\n\n  IV. Findings and Certifications</h3>\n\n <h4>\n\n  Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review</h4>\n\n \n\n  OMB reviewed this rule under Executive Order 12866 (entitled, \u201cRegulatory Planning and Review\u201d). This rule was \ndetermined to be a \u201csignificant regulatory action,\u201d as defined in section 3(f) of the order but not economically \nsignificant, as provided in section 3(f)(1) of the order. In accordance with the Executive order, HUD has assessed \nthe potential costs and benefits, both quantitative and qualitative, of this regulatory action. The potential costs \nassociated with this regulatory action are those resulting primarily from the statute's documentation requirements.\n\n <h4>\n\n  Need for Regulatory Action</h4>\n\n \n\n  This regulatory action is required to conform the provisions of HUD's VAWA regulations to those of title VI of \nVAWA 2013, codified at 42 U.S.C. 14043e et seq. The 2013 statutory changes both expand the HUD programs to \nwhich VAWA applies and expand the scope of the VAWA protections. Therefore, this regulatory action is necessary \nfor HUD's regulations to reflect and implement the full protection and coverage of VAWA.\n\n \n\n  The importance of having HUD's VAWA regulations updated cannot be overstated. The expansion of VAWA 2013 \nto other HUD rental assistance programs emphasizes the importance of protecting victims of domestic violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, in all HUD housing offering rental assistance. By having all covered \nhousing providers be aware of the protections of VAWA and the actions that they must take to provide such \nprotections if needed, HUD signals to all tenants in the covered housing programs that HUD is an active part of the \nnational response to prevent domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.\n\n \n\n  In addition to expanding the applicability of VAWA to HUD programs beyond HUD's Section 8 and public housing \nprograms, VAWA 2013 expands the protections provided to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault, and stalking, which must be incorporated in HUD's codified regulations. For example, under VAWA 2013, \nvictims of sexual assault are specifically protected under VAWA for the first time in HUD-covered programs. \nAnother example is the statutory replacement of the term \u201cimmediate family member\u201d with the term \u201caffiliated \nindividual.\u201d Where HUD's current VAWA regulations provided that a non-perpetrator tenant would be protected from \nbeing evicted or denied housing because of acts of domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking committed \n\n\n\nagainst a family member (see current 24 CFR 5.2005(c)(2)), under VAWA 2013, the same protections apply to a \nnon-perpetrator tenant because of acts of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking \ncommitted against an \u201caffiliated individual.\u201d The replacement of \u201cimmediate family member\u201d with \u201caffiliated \nindividual\u201d reflects differing domestic arrangements and must be incorporated in HUD's regulations.\n\n \n\n  VAWA 2013 also increases protection for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and \nstalking by requiring HUD to develop a model emergency transfer plan to guide covered housing providers in the \ndevelopment and adoption of their own emergency transfer plans. VAWA also changes the procedures for the \nnotification to tenants and applicants of their occupancy rights under VAWA. Prior to VAWA 2013, public housing \nagencies administering HUD's public housing and Section 8 assistance were responsible for the development and \nissuance of such notification to tenants. Under VAWA 2013, HUD must develop the notice. Thus, HUD's VAWA \nregulations must reflect that HUD will prescribe the notice of occupancy rights to be distributed by covered housing \nproviders.\n\n \n\n  In addition, certain provisions of VAWA 2013, particularly those pertaining to emergency transfer plans and lease \nbifurcations, require further clarification in order to be implemented in HUD programs. For example, this regulatory \naction is needed to explain whether and what documentation requirements may apply in the case of emergency \ntransfers, and what a reasonable time period for a tenant to establish eligibility for housing under a covered housing \nprogram, or to find new housing, after a lease bifurcation would be.\n\n <h4>\n\n  Costs and Benefits</h4>\n\n \n\n  As noted in the Executive Summary of this preamble, this rule provides several benefits, including expanding the \nprotections of VAWA to applicants and tenants beyond those in HUD's public housing and Section 8 programs; \nstrengthening the rights, including confidentiality rights, of victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault, and stalking in HUD-covered programs; and possibly minimizing the loss of housing by such victims \nthrough the bifurcation of lease and emergency transfer plan provisions. The notice of occupancy rights to be \ndistributed to all applicants and tenants signals the concern of HUD and the covered housing provider about the \nserious consequences of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking on the individual tenant \nvictim and, at times, the victim's family or individuals affiliated to the victim, and confirms the protections to be \nafforded to the tenant victim if such violence occurs. The notice of occupancy rights is presented with the goal of \nhelping applicants and tenants understand their occupancy rights under VAWA. Awareness of such rights is an \nimportant benefit.\n\n \n\n  The costs of the regulations, as also noted earlier in this preamble, are primarily paperwork costs. These are the \ncosts of providing notice to applicants and tenants of their occupancy rights under VAWA, the preparation of an \nemergency transfer plan, and documenting the incident or incidents of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault, and stalking. The costs, however, are minimized to some extent by the fact that VAWA 2013 requires HUD \nto prepare the notice of occupancy rights, the certification form, and the model emergency transfer plan. In addition, \nas discussed in the preamble, costs to covered housing providers will be minimized because HUD will translate the \nnotice of occupancy rights and certification form into the most popularly spoken languages in the United States, and \nHUD has prepared a model transfer request form that housing providers and tenants requesting emergency transfer \nmay use.\n\n \n\n  In addition to the costs related to these documents, which HUD submits is not significant given HUD's role in \ncreating the documents, there may be a cost with respect to a tenant claiming the protections of VAWA and a \ncovered housing provider responding to such incident. This cost will vary, however, depending on the incidence of \n\n\n\nclaims in a given year and the nature and complexity of the situation. The costs will also depend on the supply and \ndemand for the available and safe units in the situation of an emergency transfer request. HUD's covered housing \nproviders did not confront such \u201cmovement\u201d costs under VAWA 2005, so it remains to be seen, through \nimplementation of VAWA 2013, if the transfer to a safe and available unit can be realized in most situations in which \nsuch a request is made, and the costs a housing provider may face as a result.\n\n \n\n  The reporting and recordkeeping matrix that accompanies HUD's Paperwork Reduction Act statement, provided \nabove, provides HUD's estimate of the workload associated with the reporting and recordkeeping requirements.\n\n \n\n  The docket file is available for public inspection between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., weekdays, in the \nRegulations Division, Office of General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 7th Street \nSW., Room 10276, Washington, DC 20410-0500. Due to security measures at the HUD Headquarters building, \nplease schedule an appointment to review the docket file by calling the Regulations Division at 202-708-3055 (this \nis not a toll-free number). Persons with hearing or speech impairments may access the telephone number above \nvia TTY by calling the Federal Relay Service, toll-free, at 800-877-8339.\n\n <h4>\n\n  Impact on Small Entities</h4>\n\n \n\n  The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) generally requires an agency to conduct a regulatory flexibility \nanalysis of any rule subject to notice and comment rulemaking requirements, unless the agency certifies that the \nrule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\n\n \n\n  This rule implements the protections of VAWA 2013 in all HUD-covered housing programs. These protections are \nstatutory and statutorily directed to be implemented. The statute does not allow for covered housing providers who \nare, or may qualify as small entities to not provide such protections to its applicants or tenants or provide fewer \nprotections than covered entities that are larger entities. However, with respect to processes that may be found to \nbe burdensome to small covered housing providers\u2014such as bifurcation of the lease and the emergency transfer \nplan\u2014bifurcation of the lease is a statutory option not a mandate, and transferring a tenant under the emergency \ntransfer plan is contingent upon whether a housing provider has a safe and available unit to which a victim of \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking can transfer may seek transfer. Therefore, small \nentities are not required to carry out the bifurcation option, and emergency transfers may not be feasible given the \nfewer number of units generally managed by smaller entities.\n\n <h4>\n\n  Environmental Impact</h4>\n\n \n\n  This rule involves a policy document that sets out nondiscrimination standards. Accordingly, under 24 CFR \n50.19(c)(3) this rule is categorically excluded from environmental review under the National Environmental Policy \nAct of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321).\n\n <h4>\n\n  Executive Order 13132, Federalism</h4>\n\n \n\n  Executive Order 13132 (entitled \u201cFederalism\u201d) prohibits an agency from publishing any rule that has federalism \nimplications if the rule either (i) imposes substantial direct compliance costs on State and local governments and is \nnot required by statute, or (ii) preempts State law, unless the agency meets the consultation and funding \nrequirements of section 6 of the Executive order. This rule does not have federalism implications and does not \nimpose substantial direct compliance costs on State and local governments or preempt State law within the \n\n\n\nmeaning of the Executive order. The scope of this rule is limited to HUD-covered housing programs, as such term is \ndefined in the rule.\n\n <h4>\n\n  Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</h4>\n\n \n\n  Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) establishes requirements for \nFederal agencies to assess the effects of their regulatory actions on State, local, and tribal governments, and the \nprivate sector. This rule does not impose any Federal mandates on any State, local, or tribal government, or the \nprivate sector within the meaning of UMRA.\n\n <h4>\n\n  Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</h4>\n\n \n\n  The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance numbers applicable to the programs that would be affected by this \nrule are: 14.103, 14.135, 14.157, 14.181, 14.195, 14.231, 14.267, 14.268, 14.239, 14.241, 14.850, 14.856, and \n14.871.\n\n \n\n  <h2>\n\n   List of Subjects</h2>\n\n  \n\n   Administrative practice and procedure, Aged, Claims, Crime, Government contracts, Grant programs\u2014housing \nand community development, Individuals with disabilities, Intergovernmental relations, Loan programs\u2014housing \nand community development, Low and moderate income housing, Mortgage insurance, Penalties, Pets, Public \nhousing, Rent subsidies, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Social security, Unemployment \ncompensation, Wages.\n\n  \n\n   Aged, Grant programs\u2014housing and community development, Homeless, Individuals with disabilities, Low and \nmoderate income housing, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.\n\n  \n\n   Administrative practice and procedure, Grant programs\u2014housing and community development, Low and \nmoderate income housing, Manufactured homes, Rent subsidies, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.\n\n  \n\n   Administrative practice and procedure, Grant programs\u2014housing and community development, Low and \nmoderate income housing, Manufactured homes, Rent subsidies, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.\n\n  \n\n   Administrative practice and procedure, Claims, Equal employment opportunity, Fair housing, Home improvement, \nHousing standards, Lead poisoning, Loan programs\u2014housing and community development, Mortgage insurance, \nOrganization and functions (Government agencies), Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping, Social Security, \nUnemployment compensation, Wages.\n\n  \n\n   Grant programs\u2014housing and community development, Loan programs\u2014housing and community development, \nLow and moderate income housing, Rent subsidies.\n\n  \n\n   Community facilities, Grant programs\u2014housing and community development, Grant programs\u2014social programs, \nHIV/AIDS, Low and moderate income housing, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.\n\n  \n\n\n\n   Community facilities, Grant programs\u2014housing and community development, Grant programs\u2014social programs, \nHomeless, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.\n\n  \n\n   Community development, Community facilities, Grant programs\u2014housing and community development, Grant \nprogram\u2014social programs, Homeless, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.\n\n  \n\n   Grant programs\u2014housing and community development, Rent subsidies, Reporting and recordkeeping \nrequirements.\n\n  \n\n   Grant programs\u2014housing and community development, Homeless, Lead poisoning, Manufactured homes, Rent \nsubsidies, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.\n\n  \n\n   Grant programs\u2014housing and community development, Rent subsidies, Reporting and recordkeeping \nrequirements.\n\n  \n\n   Grant programs\u2014housing and community development, Rent subsidies, Reporting and recordkeeping \nrequirements, Rural areas.\n\n  \n\n   Grant programs\u2014housing and community development, Lead poisoning, Rent subsidies, Reporting and \nrecordkeeping requirements.\n\n  \n\n   Aged, Grant programs\u2014housing and community development, Individuals with disabilities, Loan programs\u2014\nhousing and community development, Rent subsidies, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.\n\n  \n\n   Grant programs\u2014housing and community development, Public housing, Reporting and recordkeeping \nrequirements.\n\n  \n\n   Aged, Grant programs\u2014housing and community development, Individuals with disabilities, Pets, Public housing.\n\n  \n\n   Grant programs\u2014housing and community development, Public housing, Reporting and recordkeeping \nrequirements.\n\n  \n\n   Grant programs\u2014housing and community development, Grant programs\u2014Indians, Indians, Public housing, Rent \nsubsidies, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.\n\n  \n\n   Grant programs\u2014housing and community development, Low and moderate income housing, Rent subsidies, \nReporting and recordkeeping requirements.\n\n \n\n \n\n  Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the preamble, and in accordance with HUD's authority in 42 U.S.C. 3535(d), \nHUD amends 24 CFR parts 5, 92, 93, 200, 247, 574, 576, 578, 880, 882, 883, 884, 886, 891, 905, 960, 966, 982, \nand 983, as follows:\n\n <h2>\n\n  Part 5 General Hud Program Requirements Waivers</h2>\n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n   Regulatory Text\n\n  \n\n   \n\n    1.

(\u201ccovered housing \nprogram,\u201d as defined in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2003). Notwithstanding the title of the statute, protections are not limited to \nwomen but cover victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, regardless of sex, \ngender identity, or sexual orientation. Consistent with the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements at \n24 CFR 5.105(a), victims cannot be discriminated against on the basis of any protected characteristic, including \nrace, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, disability, or age. HUD programs must also be operated \nconsistently with HUD's Equal Access Rule at \u00a7&thinsp;5.105(a)(2), which requires that HUD-assisted and HUD-\ninsured housing are made available to all otherwise eligible individuals and families regardless of actual or \nperceived sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status.\n\n  \n\n   (b)(1) The applicable assistance provided under a covered housing program generally consists of two types of \nassistance (one or both may be provided): Tenant-based rental assistance, which is rental assistance that is \nprovided to the tenant; and project-based assistance, which is assistance that attaches to the unit in which the \ntenant resides. For project-based assistance, the assistance may consist of such assistance as operating \nassistance, development assistance, and mortgage interest rate subsidy.\n\n  \n\n   (2) The regulations in this subpart are supplemented by the specific regulations for the HUD-covered housing \nprograms listed in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2003. The program-specific regulations address how certain VAWA requirements are \nto be implemented and whether they can be implemented (for example, reasonable time to establish eligibility for \nassistance as provided in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009(b)) for the applicable covered housing program, given the statutory and \nregulatory framework for the program. When there is conflict between the regulations of this subpart and the \nprogram-specific regulations, the program-specific regulations govern. Where assistance is provided under more \nthan one covered housing program and there is a conflict between VAWA protections or remedies under those \nprograms, the individual seeking the VAWA protections or remedies may choose to use the protections or remedies \nunder any or all of those programs, as long as the protections or remedies would be feasible and permissible under \neach of the program statutes.\n\n  \n\n   \u00a7&thinsp;5.2003\n\n  \n\n   Definitions.\n\n  \n\n\n\n   The definitions of PHA, HUD, household, and other person under the tenant's control are defined in subpart A of \nthis part. As used in this subpart L:\n\n  \n\n   Actual and imminent threat refers to a physical danger that is real, would occur within an immediate time frame, \nand could result in death or serious bodily harm. In determining whether an individual would pose an actual and \nimminent threat, the factors to be considered include: The duration of the risk, the nature and severity of the \npotential harm, the likelihood that the potential harm will occur, and the length of time before the potential harm \nwould occur.\n\n  \n\n   Affiliated individual, with respect to an individual, means:\n\n  \n\n   (1) A spouse, parent, brother, sister, or child of that individual, or a person to whom that individual stands in the \nplace of a parent or guardian (for example, the affiliated individual is a person in the care, custody, or control of that \nindividual); or\n\n  \n\n   (2) Any individual, tenant, or lawful occupant living in the household of that individual.\n\n  \n\n   Bifurcate means to divide a lease as a matter of law, subject to the permissibility of such process under the \nrequirements of the applicable HUD-covered program and State or local law, such that certain tenants or lawful \noccupants can be evicted or removed and the remaining tenants or lawful occupants can continue to reside in the \nunit under the same lease requirements or as may be revised depending upon the eligibility for continued \noccupancy of the remaining tenants and lawful occupants.\n\n  \n\n   Covered housing program consists of the following HUD programs:\n\n  \n\n   (1) Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly (12 U.S.C. 1701q), with implementing regulations at 24 CFR \npart 891.\n\n  \n\n   (2) Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities (42 U.S.C. 8013), with implementing regulations \nat 24 CFR part 891.\n\n  \n\n   (3) Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA) program (42 U.S.C. 12901 et seq.), with \nimplementing regulations at 24 CFR part 574.\n\n  \n\n   (4) HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) program (42 U.S.C. 12741 et seq.), with implementing regulations at \n24 CFR part 92.\n\n  \n\n   (5) Homeless programs under title IV of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11360 et seq.), \nincluding the Emergency Solutions Grants program (with implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 576), the \nContinuum of Care program (with implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 578), and the Rural Housing Stability \nAssistance program (with regulations forthcoming).\n\n  \n\n   (6) Multifamily rental housing under section 221(d)(3) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 17151(d)) with a \nbelow-market interest rate (BMIR) pursuant to section 221(d)(5), with implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 221.\n\n  \n\n\n\n   (7) Multifamily rental housing under section 236 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715z-1), with \nimplementing regulations at 24 CFR part 236.\n\n  \n\n   (8) HUD programs assisted under the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.); specifically, \npublic housing under section 6 of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d) (with regulations at 24 CFR Chapter IX), tenant-\nbased and project-based rental assistance under section 8 of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437f) (with regulations at 24 \nCFR chapters VIII and IX), and the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Single Room Occupancy (with implementing \nregulations at 24 CFR part 882, subpart H).\n\n  \n\n   (9) The Housing Trust Fund (12 U.S.C. 4568) (with implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 93).\n\n  \n\n   Covered housing provider refers to the individual or entity under a covered housing program that has \nresponsibility for the administration and/or oversight of VAWA protections and includes PHAs, sponsors, owners, \nmortgagors, managers, State and local governments or agencies thereof, nonprofit or for-profit organizations or \nentities. The program-specific regulations for the covered housing programs identify the individual or entity that \ncarries out the duties and responsibilities of the covered housing provider as set forth in part 5, subpart L. For any \nof the covered housing programs, it is possible that there may be more than one covered housing provider; that is, \ndepending upon the VAWA duty or responsibility to be performed by a covered housing provider, the covered \nhousing provider may not always be the same individual or entity.\n\n  \n\n   Dating violence means violence committed by a person:\n\n  \n\n   (1) Who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim; and\n\n  \n\n   (2) Where the existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on a consideration of the following \nfactors:\n\n  \n\n   (i) The length of the relationship;\n\n  \n\n   (ii) The type of relationship; and\n\n  \n\n   (iii) The frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.\n\n  \n\n   Domestic violence includes felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence committed by a current or former spouse \nor intimate partner of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is \ncohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner, by a person similarly situated to \na spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction receiving grant monies, or by \nany other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person's acts under the domestic or \nfamily violence laws of the jurisdiction. The term \u201cspouse or intimate partner of the victim\u201d includes a person who is \nor has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim, as determined by the length of \nthe relationship, the type of the relationship, and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the \nrelationship.\n\n  \n\n   Sexual assault means any nonconsensual sexual act proscribed by Federal, tribal, or State law, including when \nthe victim lacks capacity to consent.\n\n\n\n  \n\n   Stalking means engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable \nperson to:\n\n  \n\n   (1) Fear for the person's individual safety or the safety of others; or\n\n  \n\n   (2) Suffer substantial emotional distress.\n\n  \n\n   VAWA means the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, as amended (42 U.S.C. 13925 and 42 U.S.C. 14043e et \nseq.).\n\n  \n\n   \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005\n\n  \n\n   VAWA protections.\n\n  \n\n   (a) Notification of occupancy rights under VAWA, and certification form. (1) A covered housing provider must \nprovide to each of its applicants and to each of its tenants the notice of occupancy rights and the certification form \nas described in this section:\n\n  \n\n   (i) A \u201cNotice of Occupancy Rights under the Violence Against Women Act,\u201d as prescribed and in accordance with \ndirections provided by HUD, that explains the VAWA protections under this subpart, including the right to \nconfidentiality, and any limitations on those protections; and\n\n  \n\n   (ii) A certification form, in a form approved by HUD, to be completed by the victim to document an incident of \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking, and that:\n\n  \n\n   (A) States that the applicant or tenant is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or \nstalking;\n\n  \n\n   (B) States that the incident of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking that is the ground \nfor protection under this subpart meets the applicable definition for such incident under \u00a7&thinsp;5.2003; and\n\n  \n\n   (C) Includes the name of the individual who committed the domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or \nstalking, if the name is known and safe to provide.\n\n  \n\n   (2) The notice required by paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section and certification form required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) \nof this section must be provided to an applicant or tenant no later than at each of the following times:\n\n  \n\n   (i) At the time the applicant is denied assistance or admission under a covered housing program;\n\n  \n\n\n\n   (ii) At the time the individual is provided assistance or admission under the covered housing program;\n\n  \n\n   (iii) With any notification of eviction or notification of termination of assistance; and\n\n  \n\n   (iv) During the 12-month period following December 16, 2016, either during the annual recertification or lease \nrenewal process, whichever is applicable, or, if there will be no recertification or lease renewal for a tenant during \nthe first year after the rule takes effect, through other means.\n\n  \n\n   (3) The notice required by paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section and the certification form required by paragraph \n(a)(1)(ii) of this section must be made available in multiple languages, consistent with guidance issued by HUD in \naccordance with Executive Order 13166 (Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English \nProficiency, signed August 11, 2000, and published in the Federal Register on August 16, 2000 (at 65 FR 50121).\n\n  \n\n   (4) For the Housing Choice Voucher program under 24 CFR part 982, the project-based voucher program under \n24 CFR part 983, the public housing admission and occupancy requirements under 24 CFR part 960, and renewed \nfunding or leases of the Section 8 project-based program under 24 CFR parts 880, 882, 883, 884, 886, as well as \nproject-based section 8 provided in connection with housing under part 891, the HUD-required lease, lease \naddendum, or tenancy addendum, as applicable, must include a description of specific protections afforded to the \nvictims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in this subpart.\n\n  \n\n   (b) Prohibited basis for denial or termination of assistance or eviction\u2014(1) General. An applicant for assistance or \ntenant assisted under a covered housing program may not be denied admission to, denied assistance under, \nterminated from participation in, or evicted from the housing on the basis or as a direct result of the fact that the \napplicant or tenant is or has been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, if the \napplicant or tenant otherwise qualifies for admission, assistance, participation, or occupancy.\n\n  \n\n   (2) Termination on the basis of criminal activity. A tenant in a covered housing program may not be denied \ntenancy or occupancy rights solely on the basis of criminal activity directly relating to domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, or stalking if:\n\n  \n\n   (i) The criminal activity is engaged in by a member of the household of the tenant or any guest or other person \nunder the control of the tenant, and\n\n  \n\n   (ii) The tenant or an affiliated individual of the tenant is the victim or threatened victim of such domestic violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault or stalking.\n\n  \n\n   (c) Construction of lease terms and terms of assistance. An incident of actual or threatened domestic violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault, or stalking shall not be construed as:\n\n  \n\n   (1) A serious or repeated violation of a lease executed under a covered housing program by the victim or \nthreatened victim of such incident; or\n\n  \n\n\n\n   (2) Good cause for terminating the assistance, tenancy, or occupancy rights under a covered housing program of \nthe victim or threatened victim of such incident.\n\n  \n\n   (d) Limitations of VAWA protections. (1) Nothing in this section limits the authority of a covered housing provider, \nwhen notified of a court order, to comply with a court order with respect to:\n\n  \n\n   (i) The rights of access or control of property, including civil protection orders issued to protect a victim of \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking; or\n\n  \n\n   (ii) The distribution or possession of property among members of a household.\n\n  \n\n   (2) Nothing in this section limits any available authority of a covered housing provider to evict or terminate \nassistance to a tenant for any violation not premised on an act of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault, or stalking that is in question against the tenant or an affiliated individual of the tenant. However, the \ncovered housing provider must not subject the tenant, who is or has been a victim of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, or stalking, or is affiliated with an individual who is or has been a victim of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking, to a more demanding standard than other tenants in \ndetermining whether to evict or terminate assistance.\n\n  \n\n   (3) Nothing in this section limits the authority of a covered housing provider to terminate assistance to or evict a \ntenant under a covered housing program if the covered housing provider can demonstrate an actual and imminent \nthreat to other tenants or those employed at or providing service to property of the covered housing provider would \nbe present if that tenant or lawful occupant is not evicted or terminated from assistance. In this context, words, \ngestures, actions, or other indicators will be considered an \u201cactual and imminent threat\u201d if they meet the standards \nprovided in the definition of \u201cactual and imminent threat\u201d in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2003.\n\n  \n\n   (4) Any eviction or termination of assistance, as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section should be utilized by a \ncovered housing provider only when there are no other actions that could be taken to reduce or eliminate the threat, \nincluding, but not limited to, transferring the victim to a different unit, barring the perpetrator from the property, \ncontacting law enforcement to increase police presence or develop other plans to keep the property safe, or \nseeking other legal remedies to prevent the perpetrator from acting on a threat. Restrictions predicated on public \nsafety cannot be based on stereotypes, but must be tailored to particularized concerns about individual residents.\n\n  \n\n   (e) Emergency transfer plan. Each covered housing provider, as identified in the program-specific regulations for \nthe covered housing program, shall adopt an emergency transfer plan, no later than June 14, 2017 based on HUD's \nmodel emergency transfer plan, in accordance with the following:\n\n  \n\n   (1) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:\n\n  \n\n   (i) Internal emergency transfer refers to an emergency relocation of a tenant to another unit where the tenant \nwould not be categorized as a new applicant; that is, the tenant may reside in the new unit without having to \nundergo an application process.\n\n  \n\n   (ii) External emergency transfer refers to an emergency relocation of a tenant to another unit where the tenant \nwould be categorized as a new applicant; that is the tenant must undergo an application process in order to reside \nin the new unit.\n\n\n\n  \n\n   (iii) Safe unit refers to a unit that the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking \nbelieves is safe.\n\n  \n\n   (2) The emergency transfer plan must provide that a tenant receiving rental assistance through, or residing in a \nunit subsidized under, a covered housing program who is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault, or stalking qualifies for an emergency transfer if:\n\n  \n\n   (i) The tenant expressly requests the transfer; and\n\n  \n\n   (ii)(A) The tenant reasonably believes there is a threat of imminent harm from further violence if the tenant \nremains within the same dwelling unit that the tenant is currently occupying; or\n\n  \n\n   (B) In the case of a tenant who is a victim of sexual assault, either the tenant reasonably believes there is a threat \nof imminent harm from further violence if the tenant remains within the same dwelling unit that the tenant is \ncurrently occupying, or the sexual assault occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding \nthe date of the request for transfer.\n\n  \n\n   (3) The emergency transfer plan must detail the measure of any priority given to tenants who qualify for an \nemergency transfer under VAWA in relation to other categories of tenants seeking transfers and individuals seeking \nplacement on waiting lists.\n\n  \n\n   (4) The emergency transfer plan must incorporate strict confidentiality measures to ensure that the covered \nhousing provider does not disclose the location of the dwelling unit of the tenant to a person who committed or \nthreatened to commit an act of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking against the tenant.\n\n  \n\n   (5) The emergency transfer plan must allow a tenant to make an internal emergency transfer under VAWA when \na safe unit is immediately available.\n\n  \n\n   (6) The emergency transfer plan must describe policies for assisting a tenant in making an internal emergency \ntransfer under VAWA when a safe unit is not immediately available, and these policies must ensure that requests \nfor internal emergency transfers under VAWA receive, at a minimum, any applicable additional priority that housing \nproviders may already provide to other types of emergency transfer requests.\n\n  \n\n   (7) The emergency transfer plan must describe reasonable efforts the covered housing provider will take to assist \na tenant who wishes to make an external emergency transfer when a safe unit is not immediately available. The \nplan must include policies for assisting a tenant who is seeking an external emergency transfer under VAWA out of \nthe covered housing provider's program or project, and a tenant who is seeking an external emergency transfer \nunder VAWA into the covered housing provider's program or project. These policies may include:\n\n  \n\n   (i) Arrangements, including memoranda of understanding, with other covered housing providers to facilitate \nmoves; and\n\n  \n\n\n\n   (ii) Outreach activities to organizations that assist or provide resources to victims of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, or stalking.\n\n  \n\n   (8) Nothing may preclude a tenant from seeking an internal emergency transfer and an external emergency \ntransfer concurrently if a safe unit is not immediately available.\n\n  \n\n   (9) Where applicable, the emergency transfer plan must describe policies for a tenant who has tenant-based \nrental assistance and who meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section to move quickly with that \nassistance.\n\n  \n\n   (10) The emergency transfer plan may require documentation from a tenant seeking an emergency transfer, \nprovided that:\n\n  \n\n   (i) The tenant's submission of a written request to the covered housing provider, where the tenant certifies that \nthey meet the criteria in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, shall be sufficient documentation of the requirements in \nparagraph (e)(2) of this section;\n\n  \n\n   (ii) The covered housing provider may, at its discretion, ask an individual seeking an emergency transfer to \ndocument the occurrence of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, in accordance with \n\u00a7&thinsp;5.2007, for which the individual is seeking the emergency transfer, if the individual has not already \nprovided documentation of that occurrence; and\n\n  \n\n   (iii) No other documentation is required to qualify the tenant for an emergency transfer.\n\n  \n\n   (11) The covered housing provider must make its emergency transfer plan available upon request and, when \nfeasible, must make its plan publicly available.\n\n  \n\n   (12) The covered housing provider must keep a record of all emergency transfers requested under its emergency \ntransfer plan, and the outcomes of such requests, and retain these records for a period of three years, or for a \nperiod of time as specified in program regulations. Requests and outcomes of such requests must be reported to \nHUD annually.\n\n  \n\n   (13) Nothing in this paragraph (e) may be construed to supersede any eligibility or other occupancy requirements \nthat may apply under a covered housing program.\n\n  \n\n   \u00a7&thinsp;5.2007\n\n  \n\n   Documenting the occurrence of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.\n\n  \n\n   (a) Request for documentation. (1) Under a covered housing program, if an applicant or tenant represents to the \ncovered housing provider that the individual is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or \nstalking entitled to the protections under \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005, or remedies under \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009, the covered housing \nprovider may request, in writing, that the applicant or tenant submit to the covered housing provider the \ndocumentation specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.\n\n\n\n  \n\n   (2)(i) If an applicant or tenant does not provide the documentation requested under paragraph (a)(1) of this \nsection within 14 business days after the date that the tenant receives a request in writing for such documentation \nfrom the covered housing provider, nothing in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005 or \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009, which addresses the protections \nof VAWA, may be construed to limit the authority of the covered housing provider to:\n\n  \n\n   (A) Deny admission by the applicant or tenant to the covered housing program;\n\n  \n\n   (B) Deny assistance under the covered housing program to the applicant or tenant;\n\n  \n\n   (C) Terminate the participation of the tenant in the covered housing program; or\n\n  \n\n   (D) Evict the tenant, or a lawful occupant that commits a violation of a lease.\n\n  \n\n   (ii) A covered housing provider may, at its discretion, extend the 14-business-day deadline under paragraph \n(a)(2)(i) of this section.\n\n  \n\n   (b) Permissible documentation and submission requirements. (1) In response to a written request to the applicant \nor tenant from the covered housing provider, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the applicant or tenant \nmay submit, as documentation of the occurrence of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, \nany one of the following forms of documentation, where it is at the discretion of the tenant or applicant which one of \nthe following forms of documentation to submit:\n\n  \n\n   (i) The certification form described in \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(a)(1)(ii); or\n\n  \n\n   (ii) A document:\n\n  \n\n   (A) Signed by an employee, agent, or volunteer of a victim service provider, an attorney, or medical professional, \nor a mental health professional (collectively, \u201cprofessional\u201d) from whom the victim has sought assistance relating to \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, or the effects of abuse;\n\n  \n\n   (B) Signed by the applicant or tenant; and\n\n  \n\n   (C) That specifies, under penalty of perjury, that the professional believes in the occurrence of the incident of \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking that is the ground for protection and remedies under \nthis subpart, and that the incident meets the applicable definition of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault, or stalking under \u00a7&thinsp;5.2003; or\n\n  \n\n   (iii) A record of a Federal, State, tribal, territorial or local law enforcement agency, court, or administrative agency; \nor\n\n  \n\n   (iv) At the discretion of a covered housing provider, a statement or other evidence provided by the applicant or \ntenant.\n\n\n\n  \n\n   (2) If a covered housing provider receives documentation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section that contains \nconflicting information (including certification forms from two or more members of a household each claiming to be a \nvictim and naming one or more of the other petitioning household members as the perpetrator), the covered \nhousing provider may require an applicant or tenant to submit third-party documentation, as described in \nparagraphs (b)(1)(ii), (b)(1)(iii), or (b)(1)(iv) of this section, within 30 calendar days of the date of the request for the \nthird-party documentation.\n\n  \n\n   (3) Nothing in this paragraph (b) shall be construed to require a covered housing provider to request that an \nindividual submit documentation of the status of the individual as a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, \nsexual assault, or stalking.\n\n  \n\n   (c) Confidentiality. Any information submitted to a covered housing provider under this section, including the fact \nthat an individual is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking (confidential \ninformation), shall be maintained in strict confidence by the covered housing provider.\n\n  \n\n   (1) The covered housing provider shall not allow any individual administering assistance on behalf of the covered \nhousing provider or any persons within their employ (e.g., contractors) or in the employ of the covered housing \nprovider to have access to confidential information unless explicitly authorized by the covered housing provider for \nreasons that specifically call for these individuals to have access to this information under applicable Federal, State, \nor local law.\n\n  \n\n   (2) The covered housing provider shall not enter confidential information described in paragraph (c) of this section \ninto any shared database or disclose such information to any other entity or individual, except to the extent that the \ndisclosure is:\n\n  \n\n   (i) Requested or consented to in writing by the individual in a time-limited release\n\n  \n\n   (ii) Required for use in an eviction proceeding or hearing regarding termination of assistance from the covered \nprogram; or\n\n  \n\n   (iii) Otherwise required by applicable law.\n\n  \n\n   (d) A covered housing provider's compliance with the protections of \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;5.2005 and 5.2009, based on \ndocumentation received under this section shall not be sufficient to constitute evidence of an unreasonable act or \nomission by the covered housing provider. However, nothing in this paragraph (d) of this section shall be construed \nto limit the liability of a covered housing provider for failure to comply with \u00a7\u00a7&thinsp;5.2005 and 5.2009.\n\n  \n\n   \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009\n\n  \n\n   Remedies available to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.\n\n  \n\n   (a) Lease bifurcation. (1) A covered housing provider may in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, \nbifurcate a lease, or remove a household member from a lease in order to evict, remove, terminate occupancy \n\n\n\nrights, or terminate assistance to such member who engages in criminal activity directly relating to domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking against an affiliated individual or other individual:\n\n  \n\n   (i) Without regard to whether the household member is a signatory to the lease; and\n\n  \n\n   (ii) Without evicting, removing, terminating assistance to, or otherwise penalizing a victim of such criminal activity \nwho is also a tenant or lawful occupant.\n\n  \n\n   (2) A lease bifurcation, as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, shall be carried out in accordance with any \nrequirements or procedures as may be prescribed by Federal, State, or local law for termination of assistance or \nleases and in accordance with any requirements under the relevant covered housing program.\n\n  \n\n   (b) Reasonable time to establish eligibility for assistance or find alternative housing following bifurcation of a \nlease\u2014(1) Applicability. The reasonable time to establish eligibility under a covered housing program or find \nalternative housing is specified in paragraph (b) of this section, or alternatively in the program-specific regulations \ngoverning the applicable covered housing program. Some covered housing programs may provide different time \nframes than are specified in this paragraph (b), and in such cases, the program-specific regulations govern.\n\n  \n\n   (2) Reasonable time to establish eligibility assistance or find alternative housing. (i) If a covered housing provider \nexercises the option to bifurcate a lease as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, and the individual who was \nevicted or for whom assistance was terminated was the eligible tenant under the covered housing program, the \ncovered housing provider shall provide to any remaining tenant or tenants that were not already eligible a period of \n90 calendar days from the date of bifurcation of the lease to:\n\n  \n\n   (A) Establish eligibility for the same covered housing program under which the evicted or terminated tenant was \nthe recipient of assistance at the time of bifurcation of the lease; or\n\n  \n\n   (B) Establish eligibility under another covered housing program; or\n\n  \n\n   (C) Find alternative housing.\n\n  \n\n   (ii) The 90-calendar-day period provided by paragraph (b)(2) of this section will not be available to a remaining \nhousehold member if the statutory requirements for the covered housing program prohibit it. The 90-day calendar \nperiod also will not apply beyond the expiration of a lease, unless this is permitted by program regulations. The 90-\ncalendar-day period is the total period provided to a remaining tenant to establish eligibility under the three options \nprovided in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A), (B), and (C) of this section.\n\n  \n\n   (iii) The covered housing provider may extend the 90-calendar-day period in paragraph (b)(2) of this section up to \nan additional 60 calendar days, unless prohibited from doing so by statutory requirements of the covered program \nor unless the time period would extend beyond expiration of the lease.\n\n  \n\n   (c) Efforts to promote housing stability for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or \nstalking. Covered housing providers are encouraged to undertake whatever actions permissible and feasible under \ntheir respective programs to assist individuals residing in their units who are victims of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, or stalking to remain in their units or other units under the covered housing program or \n\n\n\nother covered housing providers, and for the covered housing provider to bear the costs of any transfer, where \npermissible.\n\n  \n\n   \u00a7&thinsp;5.2011\n\n  \n\n   Effect on other laws.\n\n  \n\n   (a) Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to supersede any provision of any Federal, State, or local law that \nprovides greater protection than this section for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or \nstalking.\n\n  \n\n   (b) All applicable fair housing and civil rights statutes and requirements apply in the implementation of VAWA \nrequirements.

(1) The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) requirements set forth in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, \napply to all HOME tenant-based rental assistance and rental housing assisted with HOME funds, as supplemented \nby this section.\n\n  \n\n   (2) For the HOME program, the \u201ccovered housing provider,\u201d as this term is used in HUD's regulations in 24 CFR \npart 5, subpart L, refers to:\n\n  \n\n   (i) The housing owner for the purposes of 24 CFR 5.2005(d)(1), (d)(3), and (d)(4) and \u00a7&thinsp;5.2009(a); and\n\n  \n\n   (ii) The participating jurisdiction and the owner for purposes of 24 CFR 5.2005(d)(2), 5.2005(e), and 5.2007, \nexcept as otherwise provided in paragraph (g) of this section.\n\n  \n\n   (b) Effective date. The core statutory protections of VAWA that prohibit denial or termination of assistance or \neviction solely because an applicant or tenant is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or \nstalking became applicable upon enactment of VAWA 2013 on March 7, 2013. Compliance with the VAWA \nregulatory requirements under this section and 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, are required for any tenant-based rental \nassistance or rental housing project for which the date of the HOME funding commitment is on or after December \n16, 2016.\n\n  \n\n\n\n   (c) Notification requirements. The participating jurisdiction must provide a notice and certification form that meet \nthe requirements of 24 CFR 5.2005(a) to the owner of HOME-assisted rental housing.\n\n  \n\n   (1) For HOME-assisted units. The owner of HOME-assisted rental housing must provide the notice and \ncertification form described in 24 CFR 5.2005(a) to the applicant for a HOME-assisted unit at the time the applicant \nis admitted to a HOME-assisted unit, or denied admission to a HOME-assisted unit based on the owner's tenant \nselection policies and criteria. The owner of HOME-assisted rental housing must also provide the notice and \ncertification form described in 24 CFR 5.2005 with any notification of eviction from a HOME-assisted unit.\n\n  \n\n   (2) For HOME tenant-based rental assistance. The participating jurisdiction must provide the notice and \ncertification form described in 24 CFR 5.2005(a) to the applicant for HOME tenant-based rental assistance when \nthe applicant's HOME tenant-based rental assistance is approved or denied. The participating jurisdiction must also \nprovide the notice and certification form described in 24 CFR 5.2005(a) to a tenant receiving HOME tenant-based \nrental assistance when the participating jurisdiction provides the tenant with notification of termination of the HOME \ntenant-based rental assistance, and when the participating jurisdiction learns that the tenant's housing owner \nintends to provide the tenant with notification of eviction.\n\n  \n\n   (d) Bifurcation of lease requirements. For the purposes of this part, the following requirements shall apply in place \nof the requirements at 24 CFR 5.2009(b):\n\n  \n\n   (1) If a family living in a HOME-assisted rental unit separates under 24 CFR 5.2009(a), the remaining tenant(s) \nmay remain in the HOME-assisted unit.\n\n  \n\n   (2) If a family who is receiving HOME tenant-based rental assistance separates under 24 CFR 5.2009(a), the \nremaining tenant(s) will retain the HOME tenant-based rental assistance. The participating jurisdiction must \ndetermine whether the tenant that was removed from the unit will receive HOME tenant-based rental assistance.\n\n  \n\n   (e) VAWA lease term/addendum. The participating jurisdiction must develop a VAWA lease term/addendum to \nincorporate all requirements that apply to the owner or lease under 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, and this section, \nincluding the prohibited bases for eviction and restrictions on construing lease terms under 24 CFR 5.2005(b) and \n(c). This VAWA lease term/addendum must also provide that the tenant may terminate the lease without penalty if \nthe participating jurisdiction determines that the tenant has met the conditions for an emergency transfer under 24 \nCFR 5.2005(e). When HOME tenant-based rental assistance is provided, the lease term/addendum must require \nthe owner to notify the participating jurisdiction before the owner bifurcates the lease or provides notification of \neviction to the tenant. If HOME tenant-based rental assistance is the only assistance provided (i.e., the unit is not \nreceiving project-based assistance under a covered housing program, as defined in 24 CFR 5.2003), the VAWA \nlease term/addendum may be written to expire at the end of the rental assistance period.\n\n  \n\n   (f) Period of applicability. For HOME-assisted rental housing, the requirements of this section shall apply to the \nowner of the housing for the duration of the affordability period. For HOME tenant-based rental assistance, the \nrequirements of this section shall apply to the owner of the tenant's housing for the period for which the rental \nassistance is provided.\n\n  \n\n   (g) Emergency Transfer Plan. (1) The participating jurisdiction must develop and implement an emergency \ntransfer plan and must make the determination of whether a tenant qualifies under the plan. The plan must meet the \nrequirements in 24 CFR 5.2005(e), as supplemented by this section.\n\n  \n\n\n\n   (2) For the purposes of \u00a7&thinsp;5.2005(e)(7), the required policies must specify that for tenants who qualify for \nan emergency transfer and who wish to make an external emergency transfer when a safe unit is not immediately \navailable, the participating jurisdiction must provide a list of properties in the jurisdiction that include HOME-assisted \nunits.

Your housing provider may choose to require that you submit a \nform, or may accept another written or oral request.\n\n \n\n  (3) You reasonably believe you are threatened with imminent harm from further violence if you remain in your \ncurrent unit. This means you have a reason to fear that if you do not receive a transfer you would suffer violence in \nthe very near future.\n\n \n\n  OR\n\n \n\n  You are a victim of sexual assault and the assault occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period \nbefore you request a transfer. If you are a victim of sexual assault, then in addition to qualifying for an emergency \ntransfer because you reasonably believe you are threatened with imminent harm from further violence if you \nremain in your unit, you may qualify for an emergency transfer if the sexual assault occurred on the premises of the \nproperty from which you are seeking your transfer, and that assault happened within the 90-calendar-day period \nbefore you expressly request the transfer.\n\n \n\n  HP will keep confidential requests for emergency transfers by victims of domestic violence, dating violence, \nsexual assault, or stalking, and the location of any move by such victims and their families.\n\n \n\n  HP's emergency transfer plan provides further information on emergency transfers, and HP must make a copy of \nits emergency transfer plan available to you if you ask to see it.\n\n <h3>\n\n  Documenting You Are or Have Been a Victim of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault or \nStalking</h3>\n\n \n\n\n\n  HP can, but is not required to, ask you to provide documentation to \u201ccertify\u201d that you are or have been a victim of \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.

The form will ask for your name, the date, time, and \nlocation of the incident of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, and a description of the \nincident. The certification form provides for including the name of the abuser or perpetrator if the name of the \nabuser or perpetrator is known and is safe to provide.\n\n  \n\n   A record of a Federal, State, tribal, territorial, or local law enforcement agency, court, or administrative agency \nthat documents the incident of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Examples of such \nrecords include police reports, protective orders, and restraining orders, among others.\n\n  \n\n   A statement, which you must sign, along with the signature of an employee, agent, or volunteer of a victim service \nprovider, an attorney, a medical professional or a mental health professional (collectively, \u201cprofessional\u201d) from \nwhom you sought assistance in addressing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, or the \neffects of abuse, and with the professional selected by you attesting under penalty of perjury that he or she believes \nthat the incident or incidents of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking are grounds for \nprotection.\n\n  \n\n   Any other statement or evidence that HP has agreed to accept.\n\n \n\n \n\n  If you fail or refuse to provide one of these documents within the 14 business days, HP does not have to provide \nyou with the protections contained in this notice.\n\n \n\n  If HP receives conflicting evidence that an incident of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or \nstalking has been committed (such as certification forms from two or more members of a household each claiming \nto be a victim and naming one or more of the other petitioning household members as the abuser or perpetrator), \nHP has the right to request that you provide third-party documentation within thirty 30 calendar days in order to \nresolve the conflict. If you fail or refuse to provide third-party documentation where there is conflicting evidence, HP \ndoes not have to provide you with the protections contained in this notice.\n\n <h3>\n\n  Confidentiality</h3>\n\n \n\n\n\n  HP must keep confidential any information you provide related to the exercise of your rights under VAWA, \nincluding the fact that you are exercising your rights under VAWA.\n\n \n\n  HP must not allow any individual administering assistance or other services on behalf of HP (for example, \nemployees and contractors) to have access to confidential information unless for reasons that specifically call for \nthese individuals to have access to this information under applicable Federal, State, or local law.\n\n \n\n  HP must not enter your information into any shared database or disclose your information to any other entity or \nindividual. HP, however, may disclose the information provided if:\n\n \n\n  \n\n   You give written permission to HP to release the information on a time limited basis.\n\n  \n\n   HP needs to use the information in an eviction or termination proceeding, such as to evict your abuser or \nperpetrator or terminate your abuser or perpetrator from assistance under this program.\n\n  \n\n   A law requires HP or your landlord to release the information.\n\n \n\n \n\n  VAWA does not limit HP's duty to honor court orders about access to or control of the property. This includes \norders issued to protect a victim and orders dividing property among household members in cases where a family \nbreaks up.\n\n <h3>\n\n  Reasons a Tenant Eligible for Occupancy Rights Under VAWA May Be Evicted or Assistance May Be \nTerminated</h3>\n\n \n\n  You can be evicted and your assistance can be terminated for serious or repeated lease violations that are not \nrelated to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking committed against you. However, HP \ncannot hold tenants who have been victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking to a \nmore demanding set of rules than it applies to tenants who have not been victims of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, or stalking.\n\n \n\n  The protections described in this notice might not apply, and you could be evicted and your assistance terminated, \nif HP can demonstrate that not evicting you or terminating your assistance would present a real physical danger \nthat:\n\n \n\n  1) Would occur within an immediate time frame, and\n\n \n\n  2) Could result in death or serious bodily harm to other tenants or those who work on the property.\n\n \n\n  If HP can demonstrate the above, HP should only terminate your assistance or evict you if there are no other \nactions that could be taken to reduce or eliminate the threat.\n\n <h3>\n\n  Other Laws</h3>\n\n\n\n \n\n  VAWA does not replace any Federal, State, or local law that provides greater protection for victims of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. You may be entitled to additional housing protections for \nvictims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking under other Federal laws, as well as \nunder State and local laws.\n\n <h3>\n\n  Non-Compliance With The Requirements of This Notice</h3>\n\n \n\n  You may report a covered housing provider's violations of these rights and seek additional assistance, if needed, \nby contacting or filing a complaint with [insert contact information for any intermediary, if applicable] or [insert HUD \nfield office].\n\n <h3>\n\n  For Additional Information</h3>\n\n \n\n  You may view a copy of HUD's final VAWA rule at [insert Federal Register link].\n\n \n\n  Additionally, HP must make a copy of HUD's VAWA regulations available to you if you ask to see them.\n\n \n\n  For questions regarding VAWA, please contact [insert name of program or rental assistance contact information \nable to answer questions on VAWA].\n\n \n\n  For help regarding an abusive relationship, you may call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-\n7233 or, for persons with hearing impairments, 1-800-787-3224 (TTY).

(27)  The ability of HP to honor such request for tenants currently receiving \nassistance, however, may depend upon a preliminary determination that the tenant is or has been a victim of \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, and on whether HP has another dwelling unit that \nis available and is safe to offer the tenant for temporary or more permanent occupancy.\n\n \n\n  This plan identifies tenants who are eligible for an emergency transfer, the documentation needed to request an \nemergency transfer, confidentiality protections, how an emergency transfer may occur, and guidance to tenants on \nsafety and security. This plan is based on a model emergency transfer plan published by the U.S. Department of \nHousing and Urban Development (HUD), the Federal agency that oversees that [insert name of program or rental \nassistance here] is in compliance with VAWA.\n\n <h3>\n\n  Eligibility for Emergency Transfers</h3>\n\n \n\n  A tenant who is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in HUD's \nregulations at 24 CFR part 5, subpart L is eligible for an emergency transfer, if: The tenant reasonably believes that \nthere is a threat of imminent harm from further violence if the tenant remains within the same unit. If the tenant is a \nvictim of sexual assault, the tenant may also be eligible to transfer if the sexual assault occurred on the premises \nwithin the 90-calendar-day period preceding a request for an emergency transfer.\n\n \n\n  A tenant requesting an emergency transfer must expressly request the transfer in accordance with the procedures \ndescribed in this plan.\n\n \n\n  Tenants who are not in good standing may still request an emergency transfer if they meet the eligibility \nrequirements in this section.\n\n <h3>\n\n  Emergency Transfer Request Documentation</h3>\n\n \n\n  To request an emergency transfer, the tenant shall notify HP's management office and submit a written request for \na transfer to [HP to insert location]. HP will provide reasonable accommodations to this policy for individuals with \ndisabilities. The tenant's written request for an emergency transfer should include either:\n\n \n\n  1. A statement expressing that the tenant reasonably believes that there is a threat of imminent harm from further \nviolence if the tenant were to remain in the same dwelling unit assisted under HP's program; OR\n\n \n\n  2. A statement that the tenant was a sexual assault victim and that the sexual assault occurred on the premises \nduring the 90-calendar-day period preceding the tenant's request for an emergency transfer.\n\n <h3>\n\n  Confidentiality</h3>\n\n \n\n\n\n  HP will keep confidential any information that the tenant submits in requesting an emergency transfer, and \ninformation about the emergency transfer, unless the tenant gives HP written permission to release the information \non a time limited basis, or disclosure of the information is required by law or required for use in an eviction \nproceeding or hearing regarding termination of assistance from the covered program. This includes keeping \nconfidential the new location of the dwelling unit of the tenant, if one is provided, from the person(s) that committed \nan act(s) of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking against the tenant. See the Notice of \nOccupancy Rights under the Violence Against Women Act For All Tenants for more information about HP's \nresponsibility to maintain the confidentiality of information related to incidents of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, or stalking.\n\n <h3>\n\n  Emergency Transfer Timing and Availability</h3>\n\n \n\n  HP cannot guarantee that a transfer request will be approved or how long it will take to process a transfer request. \nHP will, however, act as quickly as possible to move a tenant who is a victim of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, or stalking to another unit, subject to availability and safety of a unit. If a tenant \nreasonably believes a proposed transfer would not be safe, the tenant may request a transfer to a different unit. If a \nunit is available, the transferred tenant must agree to abide by the terms and conditions that govern occupancy in \nthe unit to which the tenant has been transferred. HP may be unable to transfer a tenant to a particular unit if the \ntenant has not or cannot establish eligibility for that unit.\n\n \n\n  If HP has no safe and available units for which a tenant who needs an emergency is eligible, HP will assist the \ntenant in identifying other housing providers who may have safe and available units to which the tenant could move. \nAt the tenant's request, HP will also assist tenants in contacting the local organizations offering assistance to \nvictims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking that are attached to this plan.\n\n <h3>\n\n  Safety and Security of Tenants</h3>\n\n \n\n  Pending processing of the transfer and the actual transfer, if it is approved and occurs, the tenant is urged to take \nall reasonable precautions to be safe.\n\n \n\n  Tenants who are or have been victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the National Domestic \nViolence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233, or a local domestic violence shelter, for assistance in creating a safety plan. \nFor persons with hearing impairments, that hotline can be accessed by calling 1-800-787-3224 (TTY).\n\n \n\n  Tenants who have been victims of sexual assault may call the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network's National \nSexual Assault Hotline at 800-656-HOPE, or visit the online hotline at            https://ohl.rainn.org/online/.\n\n \n\n  Tenants who are or have been victims of stalking seeking help may visit the National Center for Victims of Crime's \nStalking Resource Center at            https://www.victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/stalking-resource-center.\n\n \n\n  Attachment: Local organizations offering assistance to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \nassault, or stalking.\n\n \n\n\n  BILLING CODE P\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n [FR Doc. 2016-25888 Filed 11-15-16; 8:45 am]\n\n BILLING CODE C\n\n  \n\n In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: \neditorial@plusmediasolutions.com \n"}
