{"title": "U.S. Limits Adoptions of Romanian Children", "body": "\nImmigration officials have moved to restrict adoptions of Romanian babies by Americans, saying that only orphans \nor abandoned children will be allowed in the United States after Aug. 15.\n\nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service said on Friday that the authorities generally would make exceptions.\n\nUnder Federal law, abandoned children or orphans who are adopted by Americans can enter the country on \nimmigrant visas. But to cope with recent requests for Romanian babies, the immigration service has allowed 177 \nchildren into the country, even though they had parents in Romania.\n\nSince the December 1989 revolution in Romania that overthrew President Nicolae Ceausescu, 5,000 children have \nbeen adopted by Westerners, about 1,500 of them by American families.\n\nThis month, Romania enacted a law intended to end the black-market sale of babies.\n"}
