It's where my roots are,\" said Uribe, who moved from Chile when she was a toddler and lives in \nGlen Burnie, Md. \"It feels great to know that the country that I call home is finally accepting me.\"\n\nThousands of young illegal immigrants lined up last week hoping for the right to work legally in America without \nbeing deported. The Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals could expand the rights of \nmore than 1 million young illegal immigrants by giving them work permits, though they would not obtain legal \nresidency here or a path to citizenship.\n\nAt least 13,000 people stood in line in Chicago on Aug 15, clutching reams of paperwork, for a workshop led by \nimmigrant rights advocates at the city's Navy Pier. Hundreds of potential applicants waited outside nonprofit offices \nin Los Angeles for help filing paperwork to open the door to the staples of success in America \u2014 a work permit, \nand then later a Social Security number and driver's license.\n\n\"It's something I have been waiting for since I was two years old,\" said Bupendra Ram, a 25-year-old \ncommunications graduate student in Fullerton, Calif.\n"}
