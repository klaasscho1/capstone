{"title": "Texas Executes 2nd Prisoner This Week", "body": "\nAn illegal immigrant from Honduras who maintained  his treaty rights were violated when he was arrested for a \nrobbery-murder near Dallas was executed Thursday evening. It was the second  case of its kind this week in \nTexas.\n\n\"God forgive them, receive my spirit,\" Heliberto Chi said in English. In Spanish, he told a friend watching through a \nwindow that he loved him. Chi was pronounced dead nine minutes later.\n\nChi's lawyers argued that he should have been told he could get legal aid from the Honduran Consulate after being \narrested.\n\nThe Supreme Court, ruling about 2 1/2  hours before his scheduled execution time, rejected his appeal without \ndissent. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state's highest criminal court, rejected a similar appeal \nWednesday.\n\nThe arguments in Chi's case, focusing on rights of foreigners under international treaty, were similar to those used \nTuesday by lawyers for condemned Texas prisoner Jose Medellin. In that case, the Supreme Court, with four of \nthe nine justices dissenting, rejected his appeal and the Mexican-born Medellin was executed for participating in \nthe gang rape and murders of two Houston teenage girls 15 years ago.\n"}
