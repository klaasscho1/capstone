{"title": "Florida: Brothers' Deportation Delayed", "body": "\nFederal authorities postponed for one month the deportation of Juan Sebastian and Alejandro Gomez, brothers \nborn in Colombia who are college students in Florida and illegal immigrants. After they and their parents were \ndetained July 25, Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart, Republican of  Florida, presented a private bill to the House \nJudiciary immigration subcommittee, seeking legal status for the brothers. On Aug. 1, the authorities stayed the \nfamily's deportation for 45 days, and yesterday they extended the stay for another 30 days to give the panel time \nto consider the bill. Juan Gomez, above, who earned a 3.96 grade point average in high school, has become an \nadvocate for a measure that would give legal status to illegal immigrants who are high school graduates if they \ncomplete two years of college or military service.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPHOTO                                                    \n"}
