Now, the Democrats say \nthey never made a promise ... Romney and the Republicans will fight for bipartisan reform to bring families \ntogether.\" \n\n             What it means: Mitt Romney, who trails significantly in polling among Hispanic voters, is trying to turn the \ntables. The ad highlights an exchange from Tuesday night's debate in which he confronted Obama over the \npresident's unfulfilled promise of immigration reform.\n\n             Who will see it: There's no new ad buy, but Romney has in recent weeks bought ad time in Colorado, \nFlorida and Nevada on Spanish-speaking media.\n"}
