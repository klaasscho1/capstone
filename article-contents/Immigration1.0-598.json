Accountability and responsibility don't mean s**t \nto these people.\"\n\n\"I've seen a lifetime of it being a halfbreed, and I've struggled with the intricacies of it on a daily basis with all the \ncultural bias I've received on both ends. But whatever. Slap on the wrist. Sorry, but this s**t,\" he wrote.\n\nHuffman pleaded guilty to paying a consultant to boost her daughter's grades back in April, telling the judge she \nwanted to give her daughter a \"fair shot\" at a good education. Last month, she was sentenced to 14 days in jail as \nwell as 250 hours of community service and a year on supervised release.\n\nAhead of the sentencing, Eva Longoria - who played Chavira's on-screen wife - wrote a letter of support asking the \njudge to show Huffman leniency. \n\nIn the letter, she revealed that she was bullied at work by a \"co-worker\" and \"dreaded the days\" she had to work \nwith that person \"because it was pure torture\".\n\nShe wrote: \"Felicity told the bully 'enough' and it all stopped. Felicity could feel that I was riddled with anxiety even \nthough I never complained or mentioned the abuse to anyone.\"  \n\nHuffman will begin her sentence on 25 October.\n"}
