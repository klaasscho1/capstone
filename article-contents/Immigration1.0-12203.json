{"title": "Immigrants without visas re-arrested", "body": "\nFor years, foreigners arrested in the United States for overstaying their visas have often been let go with a promise \nthat they leave the country. Not surprising, many never did leave.\n\nFor the past six months, however, the government has been quietly re-arresting many of these \"absconders\" on a \nU.S. Justice Department list about 1,000 names long.\n\nAs of Friday, 708 of the approximately 1,000 people on the government list had been arrested under what is being \ncalled the Alien Absconder Apprehension Initiative, INS official Nancy Cohen said.\n\nINS official Russ Bergeron and others in the INS would not say whether any of those arrested had links to \nterrorism.\n\nAttorneys for immigrants said the government is arresting foreigners to give the appearance it is winning the war \non terror.\n\n\"It's just a public-relations stunt,\" said Sohail Mohammed, an immigration lawyer who has represented many New \nJersey detainees caught in the government's post-Sept. 11 sweep.\n"}
