{"title": "Fine the Employers Of the Exploited", "body": "\nThe injustices to the Hispanics on the East End cannot be condoned, but we have never had a decent immigration \npolicy and for the most part new arrivals have always been resented. [\"Hispanic Influx Being Felt on East End,\" July \n12]\n\nI cannot understand why the employers have not been fined or brought up on any charges. When I hire anyone I \nhave to fill out an IS9 form and have proper documentation or run the risk of being fined. How do they get away \nwithout this form? Perhaps if the employer not just the employee had to answer to the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service and were fined or audited when they call on one of the immigrants there would be a different \nattitude.\n\nObviously a lot of people are looking the other way.\n\nAs a child of immigrants I am forever thankful to be in this country and not in my parents' homeland, but, I do know \nhow they were exploited. It can only happen when all laws (civil and moral) are tossed aside for the sake of the \ndollar.\n\n \n\nLILA CHARNEY\n\nFlushing\n"}
