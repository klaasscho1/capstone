After you make your decisions Tuesday, the President-Elect will start making his.", "body": "\nFOREIGN POLICY ( Barack Obama)\n\nWithdraw U.S. troops from Iraq by 2011 and prod Iraqis to take up their own defense while being \"as careful getting \nout as we were careless getting in.\" Thinks the war was a mistake.\n\nMeet without preconditions with leaders of hostile nations, including Iran. Says President George W. Bush's refusal \nto meet with adversaries has not resolved differences while further isolating America.\n\nSend more troops to Afghanistan from Iraq.\n\nLaunch cross-border attacks from Afghanistan inside Pakistan if it would help take out top al-Qaida targets and \nPakistan refused to act.\n\n( John McCain)\n\nLeave troops in Iraq based on \"conditions on the ground.\" Says U.S. troops are now winning the war, which he \nsupported on the basis that Saddam Hussein posed a threat.\n\nRefuse to meet with leaders who are linked with terrorists, detest the United States or say they seek to destroy \nIsrael. Says such meetings would only lend legitimacy to those leaders.\n\nDirect more resources to Afghanistan but is wary of transferring troops from Iraq until conditions are more stable.\n\nBe reluctant to violate the sovereignty of Pakistan, an ally; would work to persuade Pakistan to go after terrorists.\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\n( Barack Obama)\n\nSecure borders through additional personnel, infrastructure and technology. Has not made border security a \nprecondition for legalization and other elements of his immigration plan.\n\nProvide a path to citizenship for those in the country illegally if they pay a fine and learn English. Those who qualify \nwould go to the \"back of the line\" behind other applicants for legal residency.\n\nEstablish an electronic verification system to ensure worker eligibility and crack down on employers who hire illegal \nimmigrants.\n\n\nExpand guest-worker program to a level that keeps families together and meets the demand for jobs that employers \ncannot fill.\n\n( John McCain)\n\nSecure the borders with physical and virtual barriers, unmanned aircraft, beefed-up enforcement and other \nmeasures.\n\nProvide a path to citizenship for those here illegally if they pay a fine, learn English, pass a citizenship test and pay \nback taxes. Those who qualify would go to the \"back of the line\" behind other applicants for legal residency.\n\nEstablish an electronic verification system to ensure worker eligibility and crack down on employers who hire illegal \nimmigrants.\n\nExpand guest-worker program for unskilled workers to fill jobs generally bypassed by U.S. workers. The number \nwould depend on market demand. Workers would have to return home after their temporary visas expired, but a \nlimited number could stay longer.\n\nENERGY\n\n( Barack Obama)\n\nGive $4 billion in loans and tax credits to the U.S. auto industry to retool plants to turn out plug-in hybrid vehicles.\n\nExpand offshore drilling if paired with support for renewable energy sources.\n\nTap the country's emergency oil stockpile to relieve pump prices.\n\nGive families $1,000 energy rebate checks.\n\nAllow the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to rein in unscrupulous speculators in oil futures.\n\nImpose a windfall profits tax on the oil industry.\n\nInvest $150 billion by 2018 in next-generation ethanol, cleaner-coal production.\n\nReduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels with a cap-and-trade system that puts a price \non pollution and gives plants flexibility to meet emission limits.\n\n( John McCain)\n\nBuild 45 new nuclear power plants by 2030.\n\nExpand oil and gas drilling in the ocean.\n\nTemporarily suspend the federal tax on gasoline and diesel.\n\nAward a $300 million prize for developing a battery package that would advance commercial availability for plug-in \nhybrids or electric cars.\n\nSpend $2 billion a year on research to reduce coal-burning pollution.\n\nAllow a $5,000 tax credit for purchase of zero-emission cars, with lesser credits for new autos emitting lower carbon \nemissions.\n\nReplace temporary tax credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy sources with permanent credits.\n\n\n\nReduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60 percent below 1990 levels under cap-and-trade.\n\nHEALTHCARE\n\n( Barack Obama)\n\nRequire health insurance for children, not for adults.\n\nAim for universal coverage by requiring larger employers to share costs of insuring workers and offering coverage \nsimilar to that in plan for federal employees.
