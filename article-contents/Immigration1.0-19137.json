{"title": "A Nation of Immigrants Faces the Current Wave", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\n  Whatever subtle word games The Times and the Senate choose to play, if the Senate's disastrous immigration bill \nbecomes law, impoverished villages across the world will buzz with one word: amnesty!\n\nHundreds of millions of people will relearn the lesson of the 1986 amnesty, which is that if you come to America \nillegally and keep out of sight, sooner or later they will make you legal. \n\n  In 1986, there were three million. This time, there are about 12 million. How many next time?\n\nJohn Brock\n\nStaten Island, March 29, 2006\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
