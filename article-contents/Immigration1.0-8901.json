{"title": "Tempering Too-Harsh Justice", "body": "\nCONGRESS REACHED too far in 1996 when it passed tough new laws to speed the deportation of immigrants who \ncommitted crimes. The measures expanded the definition of deportable crimes, removed judicial discretion to waive \ndeportation and made the new standards retroactive.\nWhile the impetus behind the law was a crackdown on illegal immigrants who committed crimes, changes applied to \nnon-citizens who were in the country legally as well.\n\nThe predictable result, along with a soaring deportation rate, was a wave of injustice. One horror story piled atop \nanother as legal immigrants found themselves subject to deportation for minor crimes long ago admitted and paid \nfor. Some adopted foreign children who had never known another home were sent away after getting in trouble with \nthe law; some legal immigrants with past convictions who made the mistake of traveling outside the county were \nhauled off to detention when they returned.\n\nNow Congress has a chance to restore some balance. The House has passed a bill that would provide some relief \nby ending the retroactive application of parts of the 1996 law. For aliens who committed crimes before 1996 that \nwere later re-defined as \"aggravated felonies\"--deportable offenses--it affords a chance to avoid deportation. For \nthose already deported under those circumstances, it offers a chance to apply for re-admission.\n\nThe legislation is a step forward, but it's only a start. A broader measure has been introduced in the Senate that \nwould eliminate retroactive effects, restore the discretion of immigration judges to grant relief from deportation in \nworthy cases and end mandatory detention. Proportion and fairness were stripped from this system in 1996; this \nCongress should restore them.\n"}
