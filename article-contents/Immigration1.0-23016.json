Curt Thompson has been a strong advocate of immigration rights, once speaking in Spanish from the \nsteps of the Georgia Capitol against the adoption of some of the nation's strictest immigration controls.\n\nNow Thompson's Colombian-born wife is in hiding as federal immigration officials try to deport her.\n\nSascha Herrera, 28, has been in hiding since Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrived at her home \nNov. 28 with an order to remove her from the U.S. She was not home at the time.\n\nHer attorney, Charles Kuck, claims she was duped by a man handling her immigration requests (a notario) and that \nher deportation order is a clerical error. He says neither he nor her husband know where Herrera is.\n\nKuck plans to file a petition to reopen her deportation case, arguing that a man she had sought help from filed an \nasylum petition on her behalf without her knowledge and before her husband sponsored her green card application \nbased on their marriage in April.\n\nThe deportation order stems from Herrera's repeated failure to appear before a judge on the asylum application, \nwhich Kuck said she did not know had been filed.\n\nThe case hinges on whether Herrera received a notice to appear in court, and whether the asylum application could \nhave been filed without her knowledge, said Victor Cerda, former general counsel for Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement.\n\nShe met Thompson last year and they got married in April, when he applied for her to become a permanent \nresident. She had held a student visa at the time, after coming to the United States on a visitor visa.\n\nCerda said the deportation order in the asylum case would trump any pending green card application and trigger \nmandatory detention.\n\nAccording to Kuck, Herrera came to the U.S. - where her parents have been living - on a visitor visa in early 2003. \nShe applied for an extension to the visa through a \"notario\" - a man who claimed he was qualified to handle legal \nimmigration matters - but did not get it until 20 days before the extension was due to expire.\n\nThe notario then suggested an asylum application, which Herrera signed, but she got a \"bad vibe\" from the man \nand decided not to proceed, Kuck said.\n\n"}
