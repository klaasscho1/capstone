{"title": "National Briefing Southwest: Texas: Health Care Inquiry", "body": "\n     A criminal investigation was begun after a complaint by the Young Conservatives of Texas that the Harris \nCounty Hospital District is forcing the public to pay for nonemergency health care for illegal immigrants. Chuck \nRosenthal, the district attorney, said he agreed with an opinion issued by John Cornyn, the Texas attorney general, \nearlier this month interpreting a 1996 federal law to say that states could not provide such care to illegal immigrants \nunless the state legislature had authorized it. Mr. \n\nCornyn said Texas had no law authorizing spending for such care.  Marc Levin, vice chairman of the Young \nConservatives, said his group might file complaints in Bexar, Dallas and El Paso Counties. The Harris County \ndistrict has spent $330 million to treat and immunize illegal immigrants in the last three years, Mr. Levin said. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
