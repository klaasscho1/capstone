{"title": "SENATE VOTES TO RESTORE FOOD-STAMP BENEFITS FOR 250,000 LEGAL IMMIGRANTS", "body": "\nA quarter-million legal immigrants would regain food stamp benefits under legislation passed Tuesday by the \nSenate.\n\nThe $ 1.9 billion bill, sent to the House on a 92-8 vote, also would provide financial guarantees for crop insurance \nand earmark money for agricultural research in what supporters said was a balance intended to appeal to both \nurban anti-hunger forces and farm advocates.\n\n\"This is a carefully crafted compromise,\" said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.\n\nOn a 77-23 vote, the Senate defeated an attempt by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, to send the bill back to \ncommittee, which would have effectively killed it. Gramm, who had blocked a floor vote for weeks, argued that \nrestoring more than $ 818 million in benefits to about 250,000 legal immigrants amounted to a full retreat from \nthe 1996 welfare overhaul that cut them off.\n\n\"The biggest problem with this bill is it puts a great big neon sign at the border of the United States of America, \n'Come and get welfare,' \" Gramm said. \"I want people to come to America to go to work.\"\n\nBut President Bill Clinton indicated that he would veto the measure without the food stamps provisions, and \nsupporters stressed that farmers need the crop insurance to renew policies, which would allow them to obtain bank \ncredit and peace of mind in case of disaster.\n\n\"There is no new entitlement here,\" said Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., chairman of the Agriculture Committee. \"This is a \nquestion of a commitment to farmers.\"\n\nThe food stamp restoration applies to only a third of the estimated 935,000 legal immigrants who lost benefits \nunder the welfare law, but supporters said they were willing to accept that as a down payment.\n\nTargeted are the elderly, those under 18, the disabled and people who came to the United States to flee political or \nreligious persecution. To qualify, those immigrants had to be living in the United States as of Aug. 22, 1996.\n"}
