{"title": "The Editorial Notebook;It's Not Tia-Wanna Anymore", "body": "\nPeer south from Otay Mesa in this southernmost part of California and you can see the future. Scrub grass and \nbare canyon stretch to the border. Then, suddenly, on the hilly Mexican side, the vista is transformed into city. Twin \n40-story hotel towers rise from an urban center. The receding hillsides bristle with thousands of tents, shacks and \nconcrete block houses. The flats below are packed with hovels, sticks and blue plastic.\n\nThis is Tijuana, stunning symbol of the third world that overhangs America's borders.\n\nThe new Immigration Reform and Control Act is about to take effect, and seeing Tijuana puts the law into \nperspective. Already there are encouraging signs that the law will help slow the flow of illegal aliens. But even the \nnew law can only begin to control the borders.\n\n''Tia-Wanna'': it's the gringo name for what used to be a seedy border town of a few thousand, a place where \ntourists were entreated to buy ''feelthy peectures,'' among other things. The tourists still arrive, in bermuda shorts \nand white sneakers, drawn by places like the Chicago Club, the Disco Salsa and Chuty's House of Beer. But the \ntourist strip now is only one facet of something vastly larger.\n\nWhat's the population of Tijuana? Some say two million. That's easy to believe, looking south from Otay Mesa. At \ntwilight, the two million seem to unravel at the edges. All across the grassy slopes, people gather in twos, threes \nand dozens. They are mostly men, mostly young, in bright shirts that read ''L.A. Rams'' and ''Smiley.'' Some sit and \nsmoke, or start cook fires, or play soccer, waiting for the larger game. Come nightfall they will dash and scramble \nacross the canyon, hundreds of them, trying to elude the helicopters, horses and sixth sense of the Border Patrol.\n\nBut it's not night yet and it's the overhanging city that still commands attention. It is varied. Yes, poor migrants \ncluster in the shabby Hotel de la Paz waiting for the ''coyotes'' who'll try to smuggle them in. But there are \nthousands who commute legally to San Diego, and who have to wait 90 minutes during rush hour at the border \nstation. Modern Japanese electronics factories stand out. At the sleek Comercial Mexicano supermarket, well-\ndressed shoppers crowd all 36 checkout lanes. ''Tijuana is at the beginning of an industrial age,'' Richard Rodriguez \nwrote in Harper's last month, ''a Dickensian city with palm trees.''\n\nTijuana may be as much an engine as a place, an engine of transition. Cheap labor spurs construction of plants to \nassemble the products trucked over to the other side. And cheap labor exports itself, at a pace that can be gauged \nby numbers like the ''1146'' chalked on the money changers' booths. There was incentive to sneak across two years \nago when a dollar bought 240 pesos. Consider the incentive now, when a dollar buys 1,140.\n\n\nAmerica's response to the illegal tide so far has been to rely on the patient professionals of the Border Patrol. They \nknow they can't stop the tide. The officers are human: ''Hell,'' said one, ''if it were me, I'd be doing it too.'' But their \njob is to slow it down; and they do.\n\nThe new law, about to take effect, should slow it down some more. Now it will be illegal to hire undocumented \naliens; so far, it has only been illegal for them to be hired. That should weaken the magnets. Big employers seem \neager to comply.\n\nThe knowledge that jobs will be harder to get may explain why border apprehensions are already down a little, \nespecially those involving ''O.T.M.'s,'' other than Mexicans, migrating from dozens of other countries. But the new \nlaw can't turn the magnets off.\n\nTheir pull can be measured in another way. The United States minimum wage is $3.35 an hour. The Mexican \nGovernment has just ordained a 20 percent increase in its minimum wage for big cities and border areas. The new \namount is $3.30 a day.\n"}
