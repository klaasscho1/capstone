{"title": "IN BRIEF;Huntington Designates Spot for Day Workers", "body": "\nDays after the Town of Brookhaven passed a law restricting housing opportunities for low-income residents, the \nTown of Huntington has designated a site for day workers looking for employment. Despite the fact that many of \nthe workers are illegal immigrants from Central America, the town board voted 4 to 1 this month in favor of \nallocating the first month's rent of $1,300 for a 1 1/2-acre plot on Depot Road and Third Street to the Huntington \nStation Enrichment Center.\n\nDelores Thompson, president and chief executive of the Enrichment Center, a job-placement training center, said \nthat hundreds of men were showing up every morning on one street corner looking for landscaping or construction \nwork. The crowd was causing traffic problems and endangering pedestrians, she said.\n\n\"What are we supposed to do with the workers?\" said Ms. Thompson. \"We can't send them back to their country, \nand they do have rights once they come here.\"\n\nNot everyone agreed. \"When you want the drug dealers off the street, do you then set them up in a crack house? \nNo, because it's illegal,\" said John Marcinka of Huntington Station. \"Now, because of the federal government's \ninaction, the local government is breaking the law.\"\n\nSimilar controversy in Brookhaven Town involved criticism from community groups and residents who say a \ndesignated shape-up site is aiding and abetting illegal activity.\n\nPatricia Reiss, a spokeswoman for the Town of Huntington, said they had to be realistic about the situation. \n\"There's a safety problem in the area, and some of these workers need help,\" said Ms. Reiss. \"The town supports \nthe Enrichment Center.\"\n\n   ELIZABETH KIGGEN MILLER\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
