{"title": "Gingrich should drop immigration baggage", "body": "\nNow that Newt Gingrich has become the latest in a series of Republican front-runners, he is getting the kinds of \nscrutiny and attacks that have done in other front-runners. One of the issues that has aroused concern among \nconservative Republicans is that of amnesty for illegal immigrants, especially after Gingrich said that it would not \nbe \"humane\" to deport someone who has been living and working here for years.\n\nLet's go back to square one. The purpose of American immigration laws and policies is not to be either humane or \ninhumane to illegal immigrants. The purpose of immigration laws and policies is to serve the national interest of \nthis country. There is no inherent right to come live in the United States, in disregard of whether the American \npeople want you here. Nor does the passage of time confer any such right retroactively.\n\nThe usually sober and thoughtful Wall Street Journal, on issues other than immigration, outdoes Gingrich's claim \nthat it would not be \"humane\" to deport illegal immigrants who have been living here a long time. A Wall Street \nJournal editorial says that it would be \"psychotic\" to do so. \"No one honestly believes the government should or will \nmount a nationwide manhunt to deport millions of people,\" according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nWhat we have today is virtually the opposite of that. Cities that proclaim themselves \"sanctuaries\" for illegal \nimmigrants put their own police officers under strict orders not to report illegal immigrants to the federal authorities, \nwith the result that illegal immigrants who have committed crime after crime are free to stay here and commit more \ncrimes, including murder. You don't have to launch a \"manhunt\" when a known criminal is also a known illegal alien. \nWhat many local policies have done has been to virtually put illegal aliens in a witness protection program.\n\nThe more doctrinaire libertarians see the benefits of free international trade in goods, and extend the same \nreasoning to free international movement of people. But goods do not bring a culture with them. Nor do they give \nbirth to other goods to perpetuate that culture.\n\nWhy do people want to come to America in the first place? Because America offers them something that their native \ncountries do not. This country has a culture which has produced a higher standard of living and a freer life than in \nmany other countries.\n\n\nWhen you import people, you import cultures, including cultures that have been far less successful in providing \ndecent lives and decent livelihoods. The American people have a right to decide for themselves whether they want \nunlimited imports of cultures from other countries.\n\nAt one time, immigrants came to America to become Americans. Today, the apostles of multiculturalism and \ngrievance-mongering have done their best to keep foreigners foreign and, if possible, feeling aggrieved. Our own \nschools and colleges teach grievances.\n\nEuropean countries have learned the hard way how massive imports of a foreign culture can undermine your own \nculture, polarize your population and create internal dangers that are irreversible. Victor Davis Hanson's chilling and \ninsightful book \"Mexifornia\" shows similar patterns in California.\n\nMoreover, in an age of terrorism, everyone who comes across the border from Mexico is not Mexican. It is the \nheight of irresponsibility to leave that border open and the people who cross it a protected group. Punishing \nemployers who hire illegals is punishing an accessory to an illegal act more harshly than the one who committed \nthe illegal act in the first place.\n\nAs for Newt Gingrich, his position on immigration is just one of the items in the \"baggage\" he has to overcome. \nBut what the voters have to overcome is an insistence on a perfect candidate. Ronald Reagan, after all, supported \nan immigrant amnesty bill, but that did not prevent him from being a great president otherwise.\n\nA Republican Congress would be unlikely to make that mistake again, even if a Republican president wanted to. \nThe big question for 2012 is whether Republicans will win Congress and/or the White House. If Democrats win \nCongress and the White House in 2012, amnesty is virtually certain, along with other disasters.\n\nThomas Sowell, an Opinion columnist, is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution.\n"}
