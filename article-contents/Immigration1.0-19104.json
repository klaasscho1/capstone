{"title": "Quit posturing, stop illegal immigrants", "body": "\nIn the ongoing immigration debate, there is one word people seem to be overlooking: illegal (\"Latest immigration \n'crisis' defies simplistic solutions,\" Our view; \"Myths vs. facts,\" Opposing view, Immigration reform debate, \nThursday).\n\nThe issue is not immigration, per se; it's about illegal immigration. To top it off, we have such illustrious leaders as \nSen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., offering so-called solutions such as allowing people who came here illegally to \nwork in the USA for six years, then permit them to become citizens.\n\nDid anyone hear of exploitation? What about upholding the laws of the United States?\n\nPoliticians need to stop posturing for re-election and deal with the hard issues they are in office to deal with, \nincluding  enforcing the law.\n\nDavid Tishim\n\nDover, N.H.\n\nImmigration still works\n\nWe must protect our borders and insist upon legal immigration first. Anyone in this country illegally needs to be sent \nhome immediately, and our borders must be sealed for protection against terrorists and from people who want a \npay check but aren't willing to pledge allegiance to our country.\n\nImmigration, the old-fashioned way, has worked since the birth of this nation. It must continue. Immigrants who \ncome here legally, learn the language and eventually take a pledge of allegiance are always welcomed. This way \nhelps maintain the unique and vibrant culture that makes us what we are.\n\nOtherwise, forget July Fourth and start celebrating Cinco de Mayo.\n\nHarry Hoover\n\nHuntersville, N.C.\n\nWhat about U.S. security?\n\nIt is disgraceful that the illegal immigration fanatics -- who have no regard whatsoever for our national security, the \nrule of law or the welfare of 300 million Americans -- want an unlimited, unregulated amount of immigrants to be \nallowed to enter the USA.\n\nIllegal immigration already costs U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars yearly -- not to mention the lost wages resulting \nfrom illegal immigrants taking jobs at the lower end of the economic ladder.\n\n\nIllegal immigration lowers the wage scale and hurts the middle class. It is a major cause of overpopulation in our \ncountry and cannot continue unabated without serious, detrimental and irreparable harm to life as we know it in the \nUSA.\n\nGreg Horak\n\nAurora, Colo.\n\n'Country's borders are weak'\n\nI see on the news there are marches and protests against immigration reform in this country. How is it possible that \nthere are people in this country who do not feel immigration is out of control?\n\nHow is it that anyone in this country can be against some sort of immigration reform? What is the problem with \nproposing some effort to curb the illegal invasion happening in the USA? What is the problem with trying to fix the \nalready strained social services departments, caused in part by the influx of illegal immigrants?\n\nThis country's borders are weak and failing more every day. Until we strengthen the borders, our safety, our culture \nand our way of life are all in danger. It is time to roll up the \"welcome\" mats at the borders and replace them with \n\"keep out\" signs.\n\nDebra Adkins\n\nRoanoke, Va.\n\nSolutions will take guts\n\nWhen it comes to getting a deal on immigration, Congress has no guts -- just as our lawmakers lack guts to deal \nwith other larger problems facing this country, such as Social Security and the war in Iraq.\n\nOur politicians don't want to upset their political base.\n\nA fair deal, in my view, would be to allow illegal immigrants who are in this country six months to register with \nimmigration authorities without facing criminal charges.\n\nLet them have their cases heard as to why they should or should not be allowed to stay in this country.\n\nAfter that -- and no matter what -- no one should be allowed to remain in this country illegally, and anyone who \ngives illegal immigrants cover should face charges and a stiff jail sentence.\n\nGarry Allyn DeManty\n\nStockton, Calif.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPHOTO, B/W, Bill Clark, GNS\n"}
