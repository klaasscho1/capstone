{"title": "INS TAKES MOLESTER INTO CUSTODY", "body": "\nA Hmong child molester who sparked outrage after he was placed on probation for 24 years and ordered to \ncontinue to learn English was taken into custody Thursday by U.S. immigration officials.\n\nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service began deportation proceedings against Sia Ye Vang after he was \nconvicted in July of four counts of first-degree sexual assault of his then 10- and 11-year-old stepdaughters, said \nGail Montenegro, an INS spokeswoman in Chicago.\n\nAnyone convicted of a felony is subject to deportation, officials said.\n\nHe has the right to a hearing before an immigration judge within seven days.\n\nThe girls testified they had been assaulted by Vang, 32, at their home between 1992 and 1994.\n\nVang, of Detroit, was placed on probation on the condition that he continue taking English classes, remain \nemployed, perform 1,000 hours of community service and stay away from the victims.\n\nThe sentence angered many people, including state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, who said she would \nintroduce legislation requiring a minimum one-year sentence for convicted sex offenders.\n\nThe judge defended the ruling as a \"true and just decision.\"\n"}
