{"title": "White House issues correction after Bush misspeaks on 'amnesty'", "body": "\nWASHINGTON -- President Bush misspoke Tuesday about the immigration bill he supports and triggered a rare \nWhite House correction.\n\nHours before the Senate voted to proceed with debate on the bill, Bush goofed by appearing to say the measure \nincluded amnesty for illegal immigrants. It's a point he has long denied.\n\nThe bill would create a path to citizenship for many illegal immigrants. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and other critics \nsay that is amnesty.\n\n\"Amnesty means that you've got to pay a price for having been here illegally, and this bill does that,\" Bush said at \na meeting of White House staff and bill supporters. A few spectators chuckled at Bush's gaffe, and the comment \nquickly appeared on websites and TV.\n\nThe White House press office swung into action, e-mailing a statement from spokesman Tony Snow that said \n\"President Bush misspoke.\" Snow said interpreting Bush's comment at the White House meeting as an \nendorsement of amnesty \"is the exact opposite of the president's long-held and often-stated position.\"\n\nSnow noted that Bush decried the \"rhetoric\" about the immigration proposal and pointed out that it contains fines \nand other penalties for immigrants who have entered the USA illegally.\n\n\"Amnesty means forgiving wrongdoing without imposing punishment,\" Snow said. \"The immigration reforms \npassed in 1986 granted amnesty. The legislation under consideration this year does not.\" \n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPHOTO, B/W, Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images\n"}
