{"title": "Mexico to aid undocumented immigrant youths at 50 consular offices across U.S.", "body": "\nThe Mexican Embassy on Monday opened the doors to its San Jose, San Francisco and 48 other consular offices \nacross the United States to undocumented immigrant youths seeking work permits and deportation relief \nthrough a new Obama administration directive.\n\nThe U.S. government won't begin accepting deportation relief applications until Aug. 15, but the Mexican \ngovernment will help eligible young people apply by giving them information and ensuring they have the proper \ndocuments, said Juan Carlos Lara-Armienta, the Mexican Embassy's head of Latino affairs.\n\nThe relief directive from the Department of Homeland Security could benefit more than 1 million people 30 years old \nor younger who were brought to the country illegally as children, most of them from Mexico.\n\nThe Mexican Embassy partnered with a U.S. immigrant advocacy group, the United We Dream Network, and has \nbeen co-hosting community workshops around the Bay Area and country. More than 200 people crowded an \nAntioch forum on Friday.\n\nConsular officials are making sure those born in Mexico have a Mexican passport that proves who they are to \nqualify for the relief directive, said Gabriela M\u00e1rdero, spokeswoman for the Mexican Consulate in San Francisco.\n\n\"Most of these people don't have an ID,\" she said. \"They have a birth certificate, but the birth certificate doesn't \nhave a photo.\"\n\nMexican passports can cost between $74 and $101 depending on how long they last before expiring, said Ana \nMar\u00eda Osorio, spokeswoman for the Mexican Consulate in San Jose.\n\nHer office is having its next workshop from 5 to 7 p.m. Tuesday at the Our Lady of Guadalupe Church, 2020 E. San \nAntonio St. in San Jose.\n\nUnited We Dream is also working with other foreign embassies from Latin America and the Philippines.\n"}
