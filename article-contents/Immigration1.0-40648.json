{"title": "SENATORS FACE NEW TAXES ON PARKING EXPERTS TESTIFY ON IMMIGRATION", "body": "\nIn yet another blow to the perks of office, senators and their senior staffers were notified that they no longer are \nentitled to free assigned parking in underground garages unless they are willing to pay taxes on it. Underground \nparking at the Russell, Dirksen and Hart Senate office buildings will remain tax-free for those willing to hunt for an \nopen parking space.\nBut senators and their aides who insist on reserved parking will be socked with additional income taxes on the \nimputed value of that space.\n\n0 growing sentiment against immigrants in America can be blamed on hard economic times, an activist told the U.S. \nCommission on Civil Rights on Friday. Stiffer competition for jobs leads many Americans to become more resentful \nof legal and illegal immigrants, said Maria de Los Angeles Jimenez, director of immigration monitoring for \nAmerican Friends Service. Jimenez was one of seven experts invited to testify before the commission about \ndiscrimination against immigrants. The commission is researching immigration issues to prepare for any future \ninitiatives.\n\nNotes\n\nWashington News In Brief\n\nWashington News in Brief\n"}
