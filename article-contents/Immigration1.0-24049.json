The aim of this study is to \nidentify the costs of the (temporary) re-introduction of border controls between the Schengen Member States in \neconomic, social and political terms and the potential benefits of more concerted action at European level, \ncompared to the lack of such action or action by Member States alone, focusing on civil liberties, justice and home \naffairs.\n\n This assessment builds on expert research commissioned specifically for the purpose from RAND Europe in the \nform of a Research Paper entitled \u2018The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Aspects\u2019. \nThis Research Paper is found in the Annex to this report.\n\n 1 Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS), \u2018An Analysis of the Schengen Area in the wake of recent \ndevelopments\u2019, Research paper for Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs, Civil Liberties, \nJustice and Home Affairs, DG IPOL, European Parliament, 2016, PE 571356\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 2\n\n Abstract The Schengen Area is one of the major achievements of European integration as it facilitates the free \nmovement of persons, goods and services which has brought significant benefits to the European economy and \ncitizens. Yet, the recent unprecedented influx of refugees and migrants to Europe has exposed serious deficiencies \nin the common asylum, migration and external border control policies. These deficiencies, together with concerns \nrelated to internal security, have led several Schengen States to reintroduce internal border controls. This study \nidentifies the costs, of the (temporary) reintroduction of border controls between the Schengen Member States, \nwith a special focus on civil liberties, justice, and home affairs aspects. Given the restricted data availability and \nmethodological limitations, the economic, social and political costs of reintroducing border controls within the \nSchengen Area are hard to measure. Within this context, it is difficult to estimate with a sufficient degree of certainty \nan overall cost in this policy field. Based on the expert research, however, this study estimates that - depending on \ntheir scope and length - the costs linked with the reintroduction of border controls could range between \u20ac0.05 billion \nand \u20ac20 billion in one-off costs and between \u20ac2 billion and \u20ac4 billion in annual operating costs. This amounts to \naround 0.02%-0.03 % of the Schengen area GDP. As regards the offences investigated, the abolition of border \ncontrols in the light of Schengen has not led to higher crime rates, nor has the 2007 Schengen enlargement \nincreased the perception of insecurity among EU citizens. On the contrary, citizens\u2019 trust in each other and towards \npublic institutions seems to have increased. It is important to note that the abolition of border controls has been \naccompanied by measures to facilitate cross- border police and judicial cooperation, for instance adding to the \nnumber of illicit drug seizures. The societal benefits of this cooperation could be undone by a return to permanent \nborder controls. Public trust in the EU seems to have been undermined, not by the existence of the Schengen \nArea, but rather by the failure of the European Union to effectively address the deficiencies exposed by the refugee \ncrises. This study recommends more concerted action at EU level with a view to returning to a fully functioning \nSchengen Area. Regaining inter-Member State and citizens\u2019 trust in the EU\u2019s ability to tackle the deficiencies \nexposed by the refugee crisis should be an immediate priority. More concerted action at EU level is necessary to \nfoster solidarity and cooperation between Member State authorities. Their work should also be supported through \nEU agencies, such as the European Border and Coast Guard, Europol, Eurojust and the European Asylum Support \nOffice. The need for changes to the current Schengen governance framework should be further considered based \n\n\n\non compliance with the conditions allowing five Member States to maintain their internal border controls until \nNovember 2016.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 3\n\n AUTHOR\n\n Wouter van Ballegooij, European Added Value Unit.

It was also a central element in a 1988 study carried out for the \nEuropean Commission by the Italian economist Paolo Cecchini on the cost of non-Europe in the single market.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe (CoNE) reports are designed to study the possibilities for gains and/or the realisation of a \n'public good' through common action at EU level in specific policy areas and sectors. They attempt to identify areas \nthat are expected to benefit most from deeper EU integration, where the EU\u2019s added value is potentially significant.\n\n The specific aim of this Cost of Non-Europe report is to identify the root cause of gaps and barriers that have led to \nthe reintroduction of internal border controls in the Schengen Area (without prejudice to the question as to whether \nthese deficiencies justify the reintroduction of internal border controls). The costs of the reintroduction of those \nborder controls were estimated in economic, social and political terms, focusing on civil liberties, justice and home \naffairs aspects. Where it was not possible to quantify all the costs and effects, a qualitative, complementary \napproach was used.\n\n The economic impact of the reintroduction of border controls was estimated based on research that followed a \nbottom-up cost modelling approach comprising (i) the one-off fixed costs of setting up or reconstructing border \ncrossing points and (ii) the operating, patrolling, administrative and maintenance costs of the day-to-day border \ncontrols. This approach was then applied to three potential scenarios affecting the scope and length of internal \nborder controls. Estimates were based on extrapolating data from Finland, Switzerland and Latvia; however, this \ndata covered the overall expenses related to border protection only, thus preventing a more detailed analysis.\n\n The social impact of the (temporary) reintroduction of border controls was measured based on research looking at \nthe impact of border controls on crime and security. There are, however, limitations to measuring this impact due to \nthe lack of clear criminal definitions with comparable data among the Schengen States. Therefore a number of \nsimilarly-defined crimes were selected (acquisitive crimes, homicides, (hard) drugs). It is also important to bear in \nmind that this data only concerns reported crimes. As reporting of crimes differs between Schengen States, this \nreport also draws on crime victimisation survey data.\n\n The political impact was estimated based on research looking at changes in the public\u2019s trust in others, in \npoliticians, in national parliaments and the European Parliament, in the police, or in the legal system, both in original \nSchengen countries, and those that acceded in 2008. A comparison was also made between border and non-\nborder regions.\n\n Finally, this report recommends different EU policy options that could help overcome the identified gaps and \nbarriers.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 5\n\n Table of Contents\n\n Note on methodology ................................................................................................................ 5\n\n\n\n Executive summary .................................................................................................................... 7\n\n 1.

As such, the borderless Schengen \nArea gives a tangible reality to the four freedoms of the Single Market (free movement of people, goods, services \nand capital).\n\n Schengen is clearly one of the major achievements of European integration. It is now a crucial part of the wider aim \nof the European Union to become an Area of Freedom, Security and Justice in which the free movement of persons \nis ensured in conjunction with appropriate measures with respect to external border controls, asylum, immigration \nand the prevention and combating of crime.\n\n The recent unprecedented influx of refugees and migrants to Europe has, however, exposed serious deficiencies in \nthe practical operation of the common asylum, migration and external border control policies, notably at the Greek \n(and hence EU) external border. As discussed in section 1 of this report, these deficiencies, together with related \nconcerns as regards serious threats to internal security and public policy, notably posed by \u2018secondary movement \nof irregular migrants\u2019, have led a number of Schengen States to reintroduce internal border controls. They sought \nto justify this action in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Schengen Borders Code (SBC).2\n\n Given the persistence of serious deficiencies in the management of the Greek external border, the Council \nadopted an implementing decision on 12 May 2016, based on a recommendation of the Commission, allowing five \n\n\n\nSchengen States (Austria, Denmark, Germany, Norway and Sweden) to maintain controls at certain parts of their \ninternal borders for a further six months (until November 2016).3\n\n As discussed in section 2 of this report, the Schengen State notifications point to a political climate in which there is \na loss of trust in the ability of (other) States to effectively guard the external borders, process asylum applications \nand cooperate together in the fight against terrorism and other serious crimes. Initiatives to regain that trust were \noutlined by the Commission in the \u2018Back to Schengen Roadmap\u20194, the aim of which was to ensure the return to the \nnormal functioning of the Schengen Area and to lift all internal border controls related to the migratory crisis by the \nend of 2016 at the\n\n 2 Regulation (EC) 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community Code on the \nrules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code), as of 6 June 2016; Member \nStates\u2019 notifications of the temporary reintroduction of border controls at internal borders.\n\n 3 Council Implementing Decision setting out a Recommendation for temporary internal border control in \nexceptional circumstances putting the overall functioning of the Schengen area at risk.\n\n 4 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the European Council and the Council, Back \nto Schengen- A Roadmap, COM (2016) 120 of 4 March 2016.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 8\n\n latest. The Roadmap is based on the reinforcement of external border control, notably through the European \nBorder and Coast Guard, a full application of EU asylum law by Greece, stepping up the implementation of the \nemergency relocation scheme5 and the EU Turkey Joint Action Plan.6 In calling for interoperability of data \ncollection, exchange and analysis, the Commission also refers to evidence of terrorists having used routes of \nirregular migration. 7\n\n Against this background, section 3.1. of this report identifies the costs of the (temporary) reintroduction of border \ncontrols between the Schengen States, in economic, social and political terms, with a special focus on:\n\n (i) the one-off fixed costs of setting up or reconstructing border crossing points, and the operating, patrolling, \nadministrative and maintenance costs of the day-to-day border controls,\n\n (ii) the impact of border controls on crime and security,\n\n (iii) changes in trust amongst the public : trust in others, in politicians, in national parliaments and in the European \nParliament, in the police, or in the legal system.\n\n As regards the economic impact, this report identifies three different scenarios:\n\n 1. A two-year \u2018suspension\u2019 of the Schengen area in the five countries that have currently reintroduced border \ncontrols related to irregular migration\n\n\n\n 2. A two-year \u2018suspension\u2019 of the Schengen Area and reintroduction of border controls in all Schengen countries at \nall internal borders\n\n 3. Indefinite suspension of the Schengen Agreement in all countries.\n\n In Scenario 1 it is unlikely that border outposts would be reinstalled in full. Member States would also probably \nmanage by reallocating human resources internally. They would have to purchase equipment to reflect the \nincreasing number of travellers to be checked. The costs are estimated to be an amount of anything up to \u20ac211.5 \nmillion.\n\n Scenario 2 is similar except for the fact that now all internal borders would be checked by all Schengen countries. \nThe costs are estimated between \u20ac4.39 and \u20ac7.4 billion. The highest costs would be borne by Germany, whereas \nGreece, Iceland, Malta and Liechtenstein would be the least affected.\n\n 5 European Commission Press release, Relocation and Resettlement: EU Member States urgently need to deliver, \nStrasbourg, 12 April 2016\n\n 6European Commission Fact Sheet, EU-Turkey joint action plan, Brussels, 15 October 2015\n\n 7 COM(2016) 205 final\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 9\n\n Scenario 3 assumes a permanent reintroduction of border controls. In this cased fixed costs related to the \nrebuilding and refurbishment of outposts are considered in full. Those costs would be less for those States which \njoined the Schengen area in 2007 or later as they often still have the basic infrastructure in place. The estimated \ncosts of reintroducing border controls could be around \u20ac20 billion in one-off fixed costs and around \u20ac2 to \u20ac4 billion \nin annual operating costs. This corresponds to around 0.02%-0.03 % of GDP of the Schengen area.\n\n Based on the research conducted, it may be concluded that the abolition of border controls within the Schengen \nArea, and the 2007 Schengen enlargement in particular, has not, for the offences investigated, led to higher crime \nrates. As discussed in section 3.2., acquisitive crime (burglary, robbery and car theft) rates have dropped both in \nthe original and newly acceding Schengen States. The downward trend seems to be even stronger in border \nregions. At the same time, drugs seizures have increased in countries which entered Schengen after 2000. It is \nimportant to note that the abolition of border controls has been accompanied by measures to facilitate cross-\nborder police and judicial cooperation, the success of which we might see reflected in these figures. Further \nresearch will be needed to confirm these trends for other offences as well as the link between (the absence of) \nborder controls and crime rates. Also, as discussed in section 3.3., Schengen enlargement as such has not been \nfound to have increased the perception of insecurity among EU citizens. On the contrary, citizens\u2019 trust in each \nother and in public institutions seems to have increased. Public trust in the EU, however, does appear to have been \nundermined, due to its failure to effectively address the refugee crises.\n\n The study recommends more concerted action at EU level so as to ensure that the Schengen area can return to \nbeing fully operational. Regaining inter-Member State and EU citizens\u2019 trust in the EU\u2019s ability to tackle the \n\n\n\ndeficiencies exposed by the refugee crisis should be an immediate priority. More concerted action at EU level is \nnecessary to foster solidarity and cooperation between Member State authorities. Their work should also be \nsupported through EU agencies, such as the European Border and Coast Guard, Europol, Eurojust and the \nEuropean Asylum Support Office. The need for changes to the current Schengen governance framework should be \nfurther considered, based on the compliance with the conditions allowing five Member States to maintain their \ninternal border controls until November 2016.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 10\n\n 1. Introduction: background and current state of play\n\n 1.1. Background\n\n The development of the Schengen Area dates back to 1985 when a group of five Member States (Belgium, France, \nGermany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) signed the Schengen Agreement on the gradual abolition of checks at \ntheir common borders. Five years later, these five Member States signed a Convention implementing the \nSchengen Agreement. This Convention included measures regarding:\n\n \u201a removal of checks on persons at the internal borders;\n\n \u201a a common set of rules applying to people crossing the external borders of the EU Member States;\n\n \u201a harmonisation of the conditions of entry and the rules on visas for shorts stays;\n\n \u201a enhanced police cooperation (including rights of cross-border surveillance and hot pursuit);\n\n \u201a stronger judicial cooperation through a faster extradition system and enforcement of criminal judgments; and\n\n \u201a the establishment and development of the Schengen Information System (SIS) enabling national authorities to \nshare and access information on people as well as on goods.8\n\n Yet, the actual removal of border controls in the Schengen Area started only in 1995, when the Convention \nentered into force. In 1999, following the signing of the Treaty of Amsterdam, this intergovernmental agreement was \nincorporated into the EU framework.9 Since then, the EU offers its citizens an area of freedom, security and justice \nwithout internal frontiers, in which the free movement of persons is ensured in conjunction with appropriate \nmeasures with respect to external border controls, asylum, immigration and the prevention and combating of \ncrime.\u201910 Today, the Schengen Area is composed of 26 countries, of which 22 are EU Member States.\n\n 8 The Schengen acquis - Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 between the \nGovernments of the States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French \nRepublic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders\n\n O.

In the aftermath of the \u2018Arab Spring\u2019 of 2011, the concerns \nabout its impact upon the Schengen system, and the ability of Member States to control their share of external \nborders, as well as controversies concerning some Member States\u2019 plans to reintroduce \u2018quasi-border\u2019 controls \nwithin their territory, led a number of Member States \u00e2\u20ac in particular France and Italy \u00e2\u20ac to demand greater freedom \nto reintroduce border controls at internal borders.14 This led to the reform of the Schengen governance framework \nin 2013, which included amendments to the Schengen Borders Code (SBC) to provide for common rules on the \ntemporary reintroduction of border controls at internal borders, and a new Schengen evaluation and monitoring \nmechanism to assess to what extent Member States apply the Schengen acquis.15\n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/schengen/index_en.htm#resp_map\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/schengen/index_en.htm#resp_map\n\n\n Specifically, Article 25 of the SBC sets out the general framework for the reintroduction by a Schengen Member \nState of border controls at internal borders where there is a \u2018serious threat to public policy or internal security\u2019. In \nsuch a case, the country may decide to reintroduce controls for up to six months, provided that the border controls \nrepresent a \u2018last resort\u2019 option and are temporary in nature.\n\n Article 26 of the SBC specifies the criteria for the reintroduction of internal border controls. Notably, when a \ncountry takes the decision to reintroduce border controls it should consider the likely impact of \u2018any threats to its \npublic policy or internal security\u2019 and the likely impact of the measure on the free movement of persons within the \narea without internal border controls. Article 27 of the SBC further describes the procedure for the reintroduction of \ntemporary border controls and sets out the relevant notification requirements that the Schengen Member States \nshould follow, including giving \u00e2\u20ac other than in exceptional circumstances \u00e2\u20ac at least four weeks\u2019 notice period so \nthat all relevant stakeholders16 are informed.

Importantly, unlike measures taken under Articles 25 or 28, reintroduction \nof border controls under Article 29 can take place based only on a recommendation from the Council of the EU, \nwhich itself should be based on a proposal from the Commission.\n\n Finally, Article 30 lays down the criteria to be taken into consideration with respect to any border controls that have \nbeen reintroduced under Article 29.\n\n\n\n The reform also changed the Schengen evaluation and monitoring mechanism from a completely \nintergovernmental system to one that is fully integrated in EU law and run primarily by the European Commission. \nBecause the SBC had been substantially amended several times, a new consolidated version came into force in \nMarch 2016.18\n\n 1.2.

An asylum \nseeker who travels on to another Member State should be returned to the first Member State of entry.21 The \nEuropean Court of Human Rights and the Court of Justice of the EU have ruled, however, that such transfers are \nnot allowed if the reception conditions in the Member State of first entry amount to inhuman or degrading \ntreatment.22\n\n As a result, secondary movements of refugees and migrants occurred through the Western Balkans, Austria, \nGermany and other northern European countries. These mixed flows have prompted a series of Schengen Member \n\n\n\nStates to invoke the relevant provisions of the Schengen Borders Code (Articles 25-30, discussed above) and \nreintroduce checks at their internal borders for a defined period of time.\n\n Since September 2015, a total of eight countries of the Schengen area \u2013 namely, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, \nGermany, Hungary, Norway, Slovenia and Sweden - have reintroduced border controls in parts of their internal \nborders in view of a serious threat to internal security and public policy related to \u2018secondary movements of \nirregular migrants\u2019.23 While Hungary and Slovenia \u00e2\u201d\u20ac in response to the decline of the identified\n\n 20 Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS), \u2018An Analysis of the Schengen Area in the wake of recent \ndevelopments\u2019, Research paper for Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs, Civil Liberties, \nJustice and Home Affairs, DG IPOL, European Parliament, 2016, section 1.1.\n\n 21 Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 establishing the \ncriteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for \ninternational protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person, OJ L \n180, 29 June 2013, p. 31\u201359.\n\n 22 ECtHR of 21 January 2011, Application no. 30696/09, MSS v Belgium and Greece; CJEU in Joined Cases NS v \nSecretary of State for the Home Department, Case C-411/10 and M.E. and Others v Refugee Applications \nCommissioner, Minister for Justice and Law Reform, C-493/10 [2011] ECR 13905; ECtHR of 4 November 2014, \nApplication no. 29217/12, Tarakhel v Switzerland.\n\n 23 In the same period, France and Malta also reintroduced internal border controls but for reasons not related to \nirregular migration. Specifically, France reintroduced internal border controls in November 2015 first in the context \nof the COP21 Conference and then as a consequence of the state of emergency following the Paris terrorist attacks \nof 13 November 2015. The internal border controls in France are currently still on-going. As regards Malta, internal \nborder controls were reintroduced on 9 November 2015 in the context of the Commonwealth Heads of Government \nMeeting and the Valletta Conference on Migration, and were subsequently prolonged for reasons of a global \nterrorist threat and with the aim of dismantling a smuggling ring. Malta lifted the internal border controls on 31 \nDecember 2015.

It therefore \nproposed a prolongation of proportionate controls at certain internal Schengen borders in Austria, Denmark, \nGermany, Norway and Sweden for a maximum period of six months.26 Following the Commission\u2019s \nrecommendation, the Council adopted an implementing decision on 12 May 2016 setting out a recommendation \nallowing for the continuation of temporary internal border control in exceptional circumstances for a further period \nof six months.27 Specifically, following the Council\u2019s recommendation, the five countries gave notice of the following \ninternal border controls:28\n\n \u201a Austria: at the Austrian-Hungarian land border and Austrian-Slovenian land border (16 May \u2013 12 November \n2016);\n\n \u201a Denmark: in the Danish ports with ferry connections to Germany and at the Danish-German land border (1 June \n\u2013 12 November 2016);\n\n \u201a Germany: at the German-Austrian land border (12 May \u2013 12 November 2016);\n\n 24 Currently, five of the aforementioned countries have temporary border controls at their internal borders in \nplace (Austria, Denmark, Germany, Norway and Sweden).

Gaps and barriers in the area of Justice and Home Affairs having led to the reintroduction of border controls\n\n To justify the reintroduction of border controls, Member States have referred to the \u2018serious threat to public policy \nor internal security\u2019 in accordance with Article 25 of the Schengen Borders Code. In accordance with Article 27 of \nthe Schengen Borders Code, Schengen States must provide exact details of the nature of the threat and its impact \nwhich is so substantial and immediate that it justifies the use of the exceptional border control measures. The \nconsequences for EU citizens and their rights to free movement must be taken into account. This is necessary for \nthe Commission and the Member States to assess the proportionality of the measure against the threat which the \nMember State has specified and justified under Article 26.30\n\n It should be pointed out that \u2018migration and the crossing of external borders by a large number of third-country \nnationals should not, per se, be considered a threat to public or internal security\u2019.31 The Asylum Procedures \nDirective32 requires Member States to process applications made at the borders. It has been argued that a reform \nof the Dublin system (rather than Schengen) and the reinforcement of the Common European Asylum System \nwould provide more appropriate responses to the refugee crisis.33\n\n Analysis of the notifications by Member States show that the reintroduction of border controls seems to be \nmotivated by a lack of trust in the ability of the Italian and Greek authorities to manage their (and the Union\u2019s) \nexternal borders. They also point to a lack of preparedness among national authorities to deal with the influx of \nrefugees and migrants. Some notifications are based on perceived future threats, including security threats.34\n\n 30 Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS), An Analysis of the Schengen Area in the wake of recent \ndevelopments, Research paper for Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs, Civil Liberties, \nJustice and Home Affairs, DG IPOL, European Parliament, 2016, section 4.1.\n\n 31 Schengen Borders Code, recital 26.\n\n 32 Directive 2013/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on common procedures \nfor granting and withdrawing international protection, OJ L 180, 29.6.2013, p. 60\u201395, article 6.\n\n 33 A.

In the Commission proposal for a Council recommendation allowing for the \ncontinuation of temporary internal border control, it is stated that:\n\n \u2018Border control should only take place during the time necessary to remedy all the serious deficiencies in the \nmanagement of the Union\u2019s external border. Several legislative initiatives and actions undertaken by the Union in \norder to reinforces its external border management (European Coast and Border Guard, return to a full application \nof EU asylum law provisions by the Hellenic Republic, stepping up of the implementation of the emergency \nrelocation scheme, the EU Turkey Statement) should also be in place and fully operational without delay and thus \nfurther contribute to a substantial reduction in secondary movements of irregular migrants.\u2019.36\n\n Security concerns were also addressed by the Commission in its Communication on \u2018Stronger and Smarter \nInformation Systems for Borders and Security\u2019 in which it refers to \u2018evidence that terrorists have used routes of \nirregular migration to enter the EU and then moved within the Schengen area undetected\u2019.37 There is clearly room \nfor improvement between Schengen Member States in this area. In a recent study on the Cost of Non-Europe in the \nareas of Organised Crime and Corruption, a number of shortcomings in the area of police and judicial cooperation \nwere identified.38 These include a lack in efficiency and quality of justice, as well as insufficient knowledge of \nEuropean laws and co-operation procedures among law enforcement practitioners. These shortcomings also \nhamper the effective investigation and prosecution of terrorism within the European Union and the belief in a \ncommon security area.39\n\n 35 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the European Council and the Council, Back \nto Schengen- A Roadmap, COM (2016) 120 of 4.3.2016.\n\n 36 Proposal for a Council implementing decision setting out a recommendation for temporary internal border \ncontrol in exceptional circumstances putting the overall functioning of the Schengen area at risk, COM(2016) 275 \nfinal.\n\n 37 COM(2016) 205 final\n\n 38 W. van Ballegooij, T.

Economic, social and political impact of the reintroduction of border controls between the Schengen States\n\n As mentioned in section 1, the Schengen Agreement plays a central role in underpinning the four freedoms of the \nEuropean Single Market \u2013 free movement of goods, persons, services and capital - consistently considered among \nEuropean citizens as one of the most positive effect of the European Union. Hence, a suspension of the agreement \nand a re-establishment of internal border controls are expected to have not only a negative economic impact on the \nEU and its Member States, but also a social impact on EU citizens, and most likely also a political impact on the EU \nproject as a whole. It is therefore worth analysing both the potential direct budgetary costs and also the social and \npolitical costs of these effects.\n\n 3.1. Economic impact\n\n Several recent studies40 have sought to identify the impact that the abolition of the Schengen Agreement would \nhave on the European economy. However, these studies either did not take into account the running costs of \nborder re-establishment, or included only a brief analysis based on an extrapolation of previous estimates which \nwere often difficult to compare.\n\n A recent European Commission report41 estimates the costs of Smart Borders implemented at the external \nborders of the EU; however, the report considers only the existing borders and estimates changes to their running \ncosts, rather than looking at the internal borders as well.\n\n Finally, in its latest Economic Forecast, the European Commission estimated the additional administrative and \nfiscal costs associated with a hypothetical scenario of generalised border controls within the Schengen area to \nrange between \u20ac0.6 billion and \u20ac5.8 billion annually. However, these estimates are based on 1993 data related to \ncustom administration costs in the range of 0.1%-0.2% of the total value of intra-community trade and the EU \nstandard cost model for the reduction of regulatory burden from 2004.42\n\n 4.3.\u2019How well do borders work as a response to terrorism\u2019 calling for more evidence to support the need for the \nreintroduction of border controls in the fight against terrorism.\n\n 40 See, for example, , \u2018Cost of Non-Schengen: Impact of border controls within Schengen on the Single Market\u2019, \nStudy, EPRS, April 2016; \u2018The Economic Costs of Non-Schengen: What the numbers tell us\u2019, Policy Paper 162, \nJacques Delors Institute, April 2016; and, \u2018The economic cost of rolling back Schengen\u2019, France Strat\u00e9gie, February \n2016.\n\n 41 \u2018Annexes to the Impact Assessment report on the introduction of an Entry Exit System\u2019, SWD(2016) 115 final, \nPart 3/3, European Commission, 2016.\n\n 42 \u2018European Economic Forecast \u2013 Spring 2016: Box 1.3: Estimating a hypothetical scenario of generalised \nborder controls in the Schengen Area\u2019, European Commission, 2016as of 12 June 2016.; Better Regulation Tool \n#53 \u2018The standard cost model for estimating administrative costs\u2019.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n\n\n PE 581.387 20\n\n Our study builds on research by RAND that follows a bottom-up cost modelling approach (see figure below), \nwhereby the total expected costs are first broken down by type of expense (i.e. (i) the one-off fixed costs of setting \nup or reconstructing border crossing points and (ii) the operating, patrolling, administrative and maintenance costs \nof the day-to-day border controls). A value is then attached to each of the aforementioned type of expenses and \neach country; finally, these are summed up to provide the total cost estimate. One-off fixed costs are mainly related \nto the number of border crossing points that each country has, their geographical location (i.e., land, air, or sea), \ntype (i.e. internal or external) and size (i.e. small, medium or large). Operating costs, on the other hand, depend \nmore on the number of border force employees and border crossings, or length and structure of land borders.\n\n Figure 1: Administrative cost estimation diagram\n\n Source: RAND Europe\n\n Each cost estimate is calculated using either country specific parameters or appropriately modified parameters \nfrom other countries with available data (i.e., by extrapolation). For example, as regards estimating the operating \ncosts of the border crossing points, only one (Finland) out of the 12 Schengen countries with external land borders \nprovides a\n\n Total costs\n\n Fixed costs of re-establishing outposts\n\n Border crossing points\n\n Cost of re-establish- ment\n\n Size\n\n Type\n\n Country\n\n Outposts\n\n Infrastructure\n\n Extent\n\n Operating and maintenance costs\n\n Border crossing statistics\n\n Amount of passengers\n\n Type of transport\n\n\n\n Extent of border checks\n\n Other costs\n\n Administration\n\n Patrolling\n\n Legal enforcement\n\n Unit cost\n\n Bottom-up approach\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 21\n\n publicly available detailed breakdown of border maintenance costs.43 Yet, Finland is an exceptional case, as the \nFinnish-Russian border goes through mostly uninhabited territory with a high degree of natural vegetation and low \nnumber of permanent border crossing points. Thus, it was deemed inappropriate to use the Finnish data as a basis \nfor cost extrapolation to other countries other than Sweden and Norway, which have borders very similar to the \nFinnish-Russian ones. To circumvent the issue, data from Switzerland and Latvia were used. However, both these \ncountries provide data for the overall expenses related to border protection only, thus preventing a detailed \nanalysis. The data were used as a basis for extrapolation to other countries by using the number of border crossing \npoints as the common denominator.44\n\n The direct budgetary costs are estimated under three different scenarios:\n\n 1. A two-year \u2018suspension\u2019 of the Schengen Area in the five countries that have currently reintroduced border \ncontrols in relation to irregular migration.\n\n This scenario corresponds to the legal time limit for reinstating temporary border controls in the context of the \ncurrent Schengen Agreement and in accordance with Article 29 of the SBC; it considers the countries of Austria, \nDenmark, Germany, Norway and Sweden, and only at places where they have reintroduced them.\n\n Since country officials may believe that the border controls are only temporary, it is unlikely that land border \noutposts are reinstalled in full. Moreover, based on the situation so far and the fact that border controls have been \nreintroduced at only a subset of the total borders, it is assumed that personnel and other equipment, as well as \nhuman resources, would be relocated within countries and thus no, or insignificant, funds would be spent on new \nequipment or hiring additional staff. Additional equipment would nevertheless have to be purchased to effectively \nreflect the increased number of passengers to be checked; a conservative estimate is made of an additional \u20ac20 \n000-\u20ac40 000 on average to be spent per land border crossing point for all equipment.\n\n\n\n Based on these estimates, and taking one-off, fixed costs into account, it is calculated that an amount of anything \nup to \u20ac211.5 million will be spent over the two-year period at the selected borders.\n\n 43 Available from the Finnish open data service website,            http://budjetti.vm.fi/ (only available in Finnish and \nSwedish).\n\n 44 The number of border crossing points was used as common denominator for all countries other than Greece, \nIceland and Malta, which do not have any land borders with other Schengen countries. For these three countries \nthe volume of passenger flows crossing the country borders \u2013 together with passenger cost estimates from the UK \n\u2013 was used as common denominator in the extrapolation process.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 22\n\n 2. A two-year \u2018suspension\u2019 of the Schengen Area and reintroduction of border controls in all Schengen countries at \nall internal borders.\n\n Although on a larger scale when compared to scenario 1, this temporary reintroduction of border controls is \nassumed not to trigger the hiring of additional staff or the full reinstallation of border outposts. Thus, under this \nscenario too, a conservative estimate is made of an additional \u20ac20 000-\u20ac40 000 to be spent on average per land \nborder crossing point for all equipment.\n\n Based on these assumptions, the estimated operating cost under this scenario ranges between \u20ac2.19 and \u20ac3.65 \nbillion annually in all Schengen countries, in addition to \u20ac58.6 to \u20ac108.6 million one-off fixed costs. Thus, the total \nbudgetary cost for all countries over the two years would range from \u20ac4.39 billion to \u20ac7.4 billion. The highest costs \nwould be borne by Germany, whereas Greece, Iceland, Malta and Lichtenstein would be the least affected.\n\n 3. Indefinite suspension of the Schengen Agreement in all countries.\n\n This scenario considers a return to permanent reintroduction of border controls at all internal Schengen borders. \nMost elements are unchanged from Scenario 2, but under this scenario, fixed costs related to the rebuilding and \nrefurbishment of outposts are considered in full. Indeed, without alternative regional arrangements in place \u2013 such \nas the free traffic zone between Sweden and Norway \u2013 which are not considered in this scenario, countries would \nneed to fully re-establish all land border crossing points rather than temporarily substitute the outposts with mobile \nborder force units. Consequently, the one-off fixed costs under this scenario is expected to be much higher \ncompared to Scenario 2. Since a distinction between small, medium and large outposts is made, the fixed costs \nvary accordingly. Moreover, it is assumed that countries which joined the Schengen Area in 2007 or later would \nface reduced fixed costs, since these countries would only need to refurbish the existing, albeit no longer used, \ncheckpoints.\n\n Based on these assumptions, the estimated operating cost under this scenario ranges between \u20ac2.19 and \u20ac3.65 \nbillion annually in all Schengen countries with an additional \u20ac7.41 to \u20ac19.76 billion one-off fixed costs. Thus, the \ntotal budgetary cost for all countries over, for example, a 10-year period is estimated to range between \u20ac29.31 \nbillion and \u20ac56.26 billion.\n\nhttp://budjetti.vm.fi/\n\n\n Finally, following the scenario outlined in a recent EPRS report,45 which considers the indefinite suspension of the \nfive countries from the Schengen Area that have recently reintroduced border controls, it is calculated that they \nwould\n\n 45 Cost of Non-Schengen: Impact of border controls within Schengen on the Single Market\u2019, Study, EPRS, April \n2016\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 23\n\n face one-off fixed costs of \u20ac3.17 to \u20ac7.70 billion and annual operating costs of \u20ac0.92 to \u20ac1.54 billion. Thus, the total \nbudgetary cost for these five countries over, for example, a 10-year period is estimated to range between \u20ac12.37 \nand \u20ac23.1 billion.\n\n The abovementioned costs do not take into consideration potentially higher costs of visa proceedings as a result of \nthird-country nationals having to apply for multiple visas when visiting more than one Schengen country \u2013 as \nopposed to the current framework of a single Schengen visa; the additional possibility for some cross-border roads \nto be closed or given local border traffic status rather than guarded, thus reducing the potential total costs, is not \nconsidered in the model either. Moreover, costs are calculated using a single cost estimate for a large variety of \ncountries \u2013 thus inherently introducing room for error in the analysis \u2013 and are based on the assumption that the \ntraffic flows across Europe would remain constant at their current levels (the number could be higher due to the \ncontinuing growing trend or could be lower as a result of border controls reintroduction).\n\n 3.2. Social impact: Crime and security\n\n The Schengen Area is not just about the abolition of internal border controls; such measures are accompanied by \nmeasures aimed at enhancing internal security. In particular, the sharing of data46 and increased cross-border \npolice cooperation are instrumental in improving the fight against cross-border crime.\n\n This raises questions as to whether:\n\n 1. the lifting of internal border controls has had an impact on crime levels/ the fight against crime, notably in \nborder regions,\n\n 2. the increased cross-border cooperation has created synergies in the individual Member States\u2019 fight against \ncrime.\n\n This section builds on research by RAND which investigated cross-country crime trends between different groups \nof Schengen and non-Schengen countries before and after the 2007 Schengen enlargement. In particular, the \nfocus was placed on the differences in the trends between the then existing Schengen States and the newly \nacceding Schengen States (Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania).\n\n The \u2018big\u2019 Schengen enlargement to new Member States that had joined the EU in 2004 took place in December \n2007. Emphasis was therefore placed on the trends before and after 2008, the year in which one would expect \nchanges in crime statistics if the opening\n\n\n\n 46 A. Orav and A.

To counter the deficiency of comprehensive quantitative data on actual cross-\nborder crimes, three different data sources were used, namely: (a) UNODC crime statistics (2003-2014), (b) \nEuropean Social Survey (2002-2014), (c) Eurostat regional crime data (2008-2010). Based on these, using \neconometrics, the researchers investigated how crime rates evolved:\n\n 1. in the existing Schengen States - namely, how crime rates evolved between countries which used to have a land \nborder with the Schengen countries which acceded in 2007 (i.e. Austria, Germany, Italy, Finland and Sweden) and \nthose which did not have such a border, and\n\n 2. in the newly acceding Schengen States (i.e., Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, \nLatvia and Lithuania) and their neighbouring non-Schengen States (i.e. Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, Moldova and \nUkraine).\n\n At this point, several issues which occur when analysing crime trends across countries should be considered. \nFirstly, police reported crimes may underestimate the true number of committed crimes. For instance, there is good \nreason to assume that people may not report minor crimes to the police because they feel ashamed of being a \nvictim, or because the lost monetary value is too little to justify the effort to report the crime, or the person has a lack \nof trust in the ability of the police to find a criminal.47 Nevertheless, criminological literature48 suggests that \nreported crime data is appropriate to study the evolution and trends in crime across countries under the \nassumption that recording procedures do not change substantially over time. Secondly, when using reported crimes \nfor cross-country analysis, one has to be cautious due to heterogeneity of reporting rates across time and \ncountries. For instance, reporting rates differ across countries, and hence, it is suggested to compare reported \ncrimes further with crime victimisation survey data.49 Thirdly, another problem when analysing crime statistics is \nthat the classification of crime may differ across countries.\n\n In order to circumvent, to some extent, the differences in crime classification between countries and to minimise \nthe effect of the aforementioned issues in the analysis that follows, two different categories of crime were examined: \nhomicides and \u2018acquisitive crime\u2019 \u2013 including burglary, theft, car theft, and robbery.\n\n Moreover, in addition to police reported crimes, crime victimisation data from the European Social Survey were \nalso used and standard econometric techniques were applied.\n\n 47 P.

Cross country trends in acquisitive crime rates (vehicle theft, robberies, and burglaries) and homicide (2003-\n2013)\n\n (i) in the existing Schengen States\n\n Interestingly, as depicted in Diagram 1 below, a downward trend has been observed after 2008 for acquisitive \ncrime in the existing Schengen Member States. Moreover, the decreasing trend is somewhat stronger for those \nstates that had direct borders with the newly acceding Schengen States after 2007. Looking at homicide rates, we \ncannot observe a clear upward or downward trend for either of the two groups, thus implying that a clear \nassociation could not be made \u2013 while from 2008 to 2010 there is some slight increase in homicide rates in the \nexisting Schengen states without direct borders with the new ones the trend is falling.\n\n Diagram 1: Trends in acquisitive crime and homicide rates in existing Schengen states before and after 2007 \nSchengen enlargement\n\n Source: RAND Europe (2016)\n\n In order to take into account the effect of other factors, for example a country\u2019s GDP per capita, an econometric \nmodel has been used; the summarised results are depicted in the table below. The findings should be read as \nfollows: in column (1) data from the UNODC\n\n -.1-.050.05.1ln 200320052007200920112013yearborder statesnon-border statesacquisitive crime rate-.3-.2-\n.10.1.2ln homicide rate (\n\n residual)200320052007200920112013yearborder statesnon-border stateshomicide rate\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 26\n\n are used regarding the police reported acquisitive crime rate in the existing Schengen countries that had direct \nborders with the new ones (i.e. Austria, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Finland). It emerges that the level in those \ncrimes reduced by 28.03% after the Schengen enlargement. At the same time, the respective acquisitive crime rate \nin the other existing Schengen States without direct borders with the newly added Schengen States only reduced \nby 7.87%. Thus it may be observed that there is a difference of 20.16% between the two different groups of \ncountries. This might imply that the Schengen enlargement and the subsequent abolition of border controls did not \nlead to an increase in the police reported acquisitive crime rate in the existing Schengen countries that had a direct \nborder with the newly added ones. In fact, the empirical findings may suggest quite the opposite, namely that \nSchengen enlargement may be associated with lower levels of police reported acquisitive crime rates.\n\n Table 1 : Summary table trends in crime rates in existing Schengen states before and after 2007\n\n (1)\n\n\n\n (2)\n\n (3)\n\n (4)\n\n Existing Schengen states\n\n police reported acquisitive crime\n\n police reported homicide\n\n self-reported acquisitive crime\n\n self-reported feeling secure\n\n Data source:\n\n UNODC\n\n ESS\n\n \u0394 before 2008 - after 2008\n\n (1) No direct border\n\n -7.87%\n\n -13.86%\n\n -1.10%\n\n 0.12%\n\n (2) Direct border\n\n -28.03%\n\n -10.17%\n\n -5.83%\n\n 4.40%\n\n (2) -(1)\n\n -20.16%\n\n\n\n 3.69%\n\n -4.73%\n\n 4.28%\n\n Notes: based on parameter estimates reported in table AC.1 in Appendix C.\n\n In sum, in the existing Schengen States, crime rates are generally falling; but as the data suggests, that fall is even \nmore pronounced in those Schengen States with direct (internal) borders with the countries that joined Schengen \nin 2007. This applies for police reported crime - column (1) - as well as self-reported crime victimisation rates - \ncolumn (3).

The rate of acquisitive crime is falling \nin the pre-2007 period for the newly acceding Schengen States and continues with even a slightly stronger \ndownward trend thereafter. As regards the homicide rate in the new Schengen States, there is a relatively strong \nfluctuation in the post-2007 period and hence a clear trend cannot be determined.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 27\n\n Diagram 2 : Trends in acquisitive crime and homicide rates in newly acceding Schengen and Non-Schengen states \nbefore and after 2007 Schengen enlargement\n\n Notes: based on UNODC crime statistics.

This table reveals \nthat, according to UNODC data, after their inclusion in the Schengen Area in 2007, the newly added Schengen \nStates report 14.05% lower acquisitive rates of crime than their non-Schengen neighbours - column (1).

At first, these findings may seem counterintuitive; yet, this reduction may be due to the fact \nthat the improved cross-border police cooperation and law enforcement mechanism in light of Schengen could \nhave made the fight against acquisitive crime more efficient. Hence, resources that were once used to guard \nborder controls could now be redirected and focus on other activities such as combating cross-border acquisitive \ncrime. Nonetheless, it is important to note that these findings should be interpreted as associations and cannot be \nread as causal effects of Schengen reducing crime levels. Moreover, due to lack of quantitative data, the effect of \nSchengen on other types of organised crime, such as human trafficking, was not empirically investigated. \nConsequently, the findings should be interpreted with caution.\n\n 3.2.2. Cross-regional trends in acquisitive crime and homicide rates \u00e2\u20ac border vs. non-border regions\n\n This section builds on research that investigated how trends in crime rates evolve within a group of countries by \ncomparing border to non-border regions. Regional police reported crime level data (acquisitive crime data, namely \nburglary, robbery and car theft, as well as homicide data) for Eurostat\u2019s Nomenclature of Territorial Units for \nStatistics level 3 (NUTS 3) regions were used as a proxy for acquisitive crime. However, due to data limitations \u00e2\u20ac \nthe abovementioned regional data were only available for 2008, 2009 and 2010 \u00e2\u20ac it was only possible to compare \nthe evolution of trends in crime rates for border versus non border NUTS 3 regions after the 2007 enlargement. \nMoreover, the analysis considered only NUTS 3 regions of countries with direct land borders with the newly \nacceding Schengen Member States as well as with maritime links to them.\n\n Diagram 3 below depicts the trends for NUTS 3 regions with borders that were abolished as a result of a \nSchengen area enlargement in 2007 compared to NUTS 3 regions without such borders within the same country \n(i.e. Austria, Germany, Italy Sweden and Finland),\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 29\n\n after adjustment of some parameters.50 The findings suggest that the examined crime rates tend to decrease \nfaster for border regions than for non-border regions. While it is important to note that criminal activity spans to \nmore categories than those taken into account in the analysis, and that the analysis cannot identify any causal \neffect that the Schengen enlargement may have had on crime rates in border countries and their border regions, \n\n\n\nthe results do not encourage the hypothesis that the abolition of internal borders led to an increase in crime or that \nborder regions would be particularly affected by this phenomenon.\n\n Diagram 3 : Regional trend in acquisitive crime (burglary, car theft and robbery) and homicide rates between \nborder and non-border NUTS 3 regions\n\n 3.2.3. The fight against drugs trafficking before and after entering Schengen\n\n Theoretical arguments about the impact of open borders on the fight against drug trafficking are conflicting. On the \none side, some may argue that there is a clear \u2018border effect\u2019 and that the lack of border controls makes \ncombating drug trafficking more difficult; indeed, it can be stated that once the drug has passed the external \nborders, no\n\n 50 Adjustment include regional GDP per capita, regional type (metropolitan or mountainous), net migration and \ntotal population of the region.\n\n 6.76.86.977.1ln rate200820092010yearborder NUTS3 regionnon-border NUTS3 regionacquisitive crime \nrate.2.4.6.81ln homicide rate200820092010yearborder NUTS3 regionnon-border NUTS3 regionhomicide rate\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 30\n\n further controls should be expected.51 On the other side, one could argue that the improved cross-border police \ncooperation and law enforcement mechanism in light of Schengen could have made the fight against drug \ntrafficking more efficient. Following this assumption, it can be considered that resources that were once used to \nguard the border controls could now be redirected and focus on other activities such as combating cross-border \ncrime. This section builds on research which examined whether the abolition of border controls in light of Schengen \nalters the ability of countries to tackle cross-border drug trafficking. To deal with problems related to (i) imperfect \ninformation between buyers and sellers; and (ii) the role of enforcement which affects drug production and \ndistribution routes, the study is focused only on drugs with virtually no production within Europe, namely cocaine\n\n and heroin.\n\n Since the data on prices and purity are only available for the period since 1995, and since some observations \nbefore the country in question entered the Schengen area are needed to do a pre- and post-Schengen comparison, \nthe sample included all European countries from the 2000 Schengen enlargement round to the 2007 \nenlargement52, as well as countries which have never been part of the Schengen area (Ireland and UK) and non-\nEU countries, such as Turkey, as comparison groups.\n\n The findings suggest that the abolition of border controls is positively associated with cocaine and heroin seizures. \nOn average, it is estimated that the countries which entered the Schengen area after 2000 have increased the \nquantity of seized cocaine and heroin by around 50% and 67% respectively. For example, a pre-Schengen annual \naverage of around 50kg of seized cocaine would increase to around 75kg after Schengen and similarly a pre-\nSchengen annual average of 60kg of seized heroin would increase to 100kg after Schengen.\n\n\n\n The fact that abolishing border controls may increase the amount of drug seizures might be explained by better \ncross-border police cooperation in light of Schengen which could, in turn, have led to better or more frequent \ninformation exchange. In addition, resources that were used pre-Schengen to guard border controls could be \nredirected post-Schengen and focus on other activities such as combating cross-border drug trafficking.\n\n Further research will be needed to confirm these trends for other offences as well as the link between (the absence \nof) border controls and crime rates.\n\n 51 McCabe, Ryan, 2015, \u2018Measuring the border effect: How Schengen Impedes Heroin confiscation\u2019, as of 13 \nJune 2016 available at            http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2015/mccabe_ryan.pdf.\n\n 52 Switzerland is excluded from the analysis, because, despite being a Schengen Member, it still has running \nborder crossing points to check the flow of goods.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 31\n\n 3.3. Political impact: Trust\n\n As mentioned in section 2, Member State justification for the reintroduction of internal border controls points to a \npolitical climate characterised by a loss of trust in the (other) Member States\u2019 ability to effectively guard the external \nborders, process asylum applications and cooperate together in the fight against terrorism and other serious \ncrimes. The trust between Member States has not been measured in academic research.53 Trust among the \npublic, however, has been measured in the European Social Survey, notably as regards trust in others, trust in \npoliticians, national parliaments and the European Parliament, the police, or the legal system. Using these data, \none can compare the change in trust levels after 2008 between two different groups of countries, namely, the \ndifference (1) between existing Schengen countries that had direct borders with the new ones, and (2) between the \nnewly acceding Schengen States and non-Schengen countries.54\n\n Overall, for the newly acceding Schengen Member States an increase in public trust is found across the board \nafter the inclusion in the Schengen Area, whereas over the same time period public trust decreased in their \nneighbouring, non-Schengen countries. In addition, overall trust in the existing Schengen Member States is \nincreasing across the board but tends to be more pronounced in the existing Schengen states with direct borders \nwith the new states entering the area in 2007.55\n\n When similar analysis is applied on a regional level, comparing border and non-border regions within countries in \nlight of the Schengen enlargement, it is found that the trends across different measures of trust are generally very \nsimilar for border and non-border regions for the sample of both the newly acceding Schengen states and , as well \nfor the existing Schengen states.56\n\n Therefore, one can conclude that the abolition of border controls in light of Schengen has not increased the \nperception of insecurity among EU citizens. Trust among the public in the EU seems to have been undermined \nthough, but rather due to the European Union\u2019s failure to effectively address the refugee crises,57 as illustrated by \nthe figure taken from the Autumn 2015 Eurobarometer survey below.\n\nhttp://www.etd.ceu.hu/2015/mccabe_ryan.pdf\n\n\n 53 RAND (2016), p. 45.\n\n 54 See section 3.2, for a more detailed list of countries compared.\n\n 55 RAND (2016), p. 47\n\n 56 RAND (2016), p. 48\n\n 57 See \u2018Debating Europe, Has the refugee crisis damaged trust in the European project?\u2019\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 32\n\n Figure 2: Trend of the trust in national governments and parliaments, and in the European Union\n\n Source: Standard Eurobarometer 84 (Autumn 2015)58\n\n Nevertheless, the European Citizen\u2019s Action Service, which runs \u2018Your Europe Advice\u2019\n\n providing legal advice for EU citizens, has experienced a 9.4% increase in enquiries in\n\n 2015 compared to 2014, which might be indicative of an increasing sentiment of\n\n uncertainty by citizens about the practical implementation of the freedom of\n\n movement.59\n\n 4. Possible options for action at EU level\n\n Based on the expert research, this study estimates that the costs linked with the\n\n reintroduction of border controls could range between \u20ac0.05 billion and \u20ac20 billion in\n\n one-off costs and \u20ac2 billion and \u20ac4 billion in annual operating costs - the exact figure\n\n depending on their scope and length. These amounts correspond to around 0.02%-0.03%\n\n of GDP of the Schengen area.\n\n As regards the offences investigated, the abolition of border controls in the light of\n\n Schengen has not led to higher crime rates, nor has the 2007 Schengen enlargement\n\n increased the perception of insecurity among EU citizens.60 On the contrary citizens\u2019\n\n trust in each other and in public institutions seems to have increased. It is important to\n\n\n\n 58           http://ec.europa.eu/COMMFrontOffice/PublicOpinion/index.cfm/Survey/getSurveyDetail\n\n /instruments/STANDARD/surveyKy/2098\n\n 59 CEPS (2016), Annex IV;            http://europa.eu/youreurope/advice/about_en.htm\n\n 60 These findings should nevertheless be interpreted as associations only and cannot be read as\n\n causal effects. They also need to be confirmed by research into other offences. See RAND Europe,\n\n A Research Paper on The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs\n\n Aspects, p. 66.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 33\n\n note that the abolition of border controls has been accompanied by measures to facilitate cross-border police and \njudicial cooperation, for instance adding to the number of illicit drug seizures. The societal benefits of this \ncooperation could be undone by a return to permanent border controls.\n\n Though the migration and refugee crisis was not caused by deficiencies in the Schengen governance framework, \nthe integrity of the Schengen Area has been affected by it. 61 The need for changes to the current Schengen \ngovernance framework should be further considered based on the compliance with the implementing decision of 12 \nMay 2016 allowing five Schengen Member States (Austria, Denmark, Germany, Norway and Sweden) to maintain \ncontrols at certain parts of their internal border for another six months (until November 2016).62\n\n The Schengen Member State notifications seeking to justify the reintroduction of internal border controls point to a \npolitical climate in which there is a loss of trust in the ability of (other) Member States to effectively guard the \nexternal borders, process asylum applications and cooperate together in the fight against terrorism and other \nserious crimes. Trust among the public in the EU also seems to have been undermined by the failure of the Union \nto effectively address the deficiencies exposed by the refugee crises. Regaining inter-Member State and EU \ncitizen\u2019s trust in the EU\u2019s ability to tackle the deficiencies exposed by the refugee crisis should therefore be the \nimmediate priority.\n\n The deficiencies exposed by the refugee crisis and the resulting loss of trust could be addressed by more \nconcerted action at EU level fostering solidarity and cooperation between the Member States. Such initiatives \nshould also take better advantage of EU agencies. In that context, a comprehensive assessment of the Cost of non-\nEurope in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice could help to shed more light on the untapped potential of \nEuropean integration in this field.63\n\n This notwithstanding, as regards the scope of the current study, measures in the following areas should be \nconsidered:\n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/COMMFrontOffice/PublicOpinion/index.cfm/Survey/getSurveyDetail\nhttp://europa.eu/youreurope/advice/about_en.htm\n\n\n 1.

External border control\n\n Action in this area needs to go beyond the current crisis-response measures. A more sustainable solution should \nbe based around the recent creation of a European Border and Coast Guard. The EBCG should be able to monitor \nthe situation at external borders and intervene in situations where insufficient external border controls put the \noverall functioning of the Schengen area at risk. 64 Other relevant measures would concern the introduction of \nenhanced border checks against relevant databases65 as well as of an entry-exit system66 aimed at improving the \nidentification of visa over-stayers and irregular migrants; moreover, criteria for the detection of terrorist travellers \nshould be developed.67\n\n 2. Police and judicial cooperation\n\n Action in this area should revolve around the coherence and interoperability of data collection, exchange and \nanalysis, including by expanding the use and functionality of the Schengen Information System.68 The lack of \nefficiency and quality of justice, as well as the insufficient knowledge of European laws and co-operation \nprocedures, notably co-operation in the framework of Europol and Eurojust, among law-enforcement practitioners, \nneeds to be addressed through budgetary and training measures. 69\n\n 3.

Regaining inter-\nMember State and EU citizens\u2019 trust should, however, be an immediate priority, notably through the organisation of \nsolidarity and cooperation between Member State authorities, supported in their work by EU agencies.\n\n 72 Recast Dublin Regulation COM(2016) 270; Recast EURODAC COM (2016) 272; proposal for a European \nAgency for Asylum COM(2016) 271; EU list of safe countries of origin COM(2015) 452; Permanent relocation \nscheme COM(2015) 450; European travel document for the return of illegally staying third-country nationals \nCOM(2015)668 final; European Resettlement Scheme C(2015) 3560 final; EU Turkey Joint Action Plan, Council \nEU-Turkey statement\n\n 73 RAND Europe, A Research Paper on The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs \nAspects, p. 67.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 36\n\n Annex\n\n A Research Paper on the Costs of Non-Schengen\n\n from a Civil Liberties and Home Affairs Perspective\n\n by RAND Europe\n\n Abstract This paper examines the costs of non-Schengen from a civil liberties and home affairs perspective, \nbuilding on recent evidence describing the potential economic and social costs that would accrue if the Schengen \nagreement were to be abolished and border controls re-introduced. The paper estimates the cost of re-introducing \ninternal border controls in the Schengen Area at around \u20ac0.1\u201319bn in one-off costs and around \u20ac2\u20134bn in annual \noperating costs, corresponding to around 0.02\u20130.03 per cent of Schengen Area GDP. Empirical findings of the \nanalysis conducted in this paper also suggest that the abolishment of border controls as a result of Schengen is not \nassociated with higher crime rates either in border or in non-border regions. In addition, the lack of border controls \nhas not hampered the ability of Schengen states to combat the illicit drug trade.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 37\n\n AUTHOR\n\n This study was written by Marco Hafner, Jirka Taylor, Martin Stepanek, Sarah Grand-Clement, Martin Sacher, \nElma Dujso, Matteo Barberi and Stijn Hoorens at the request of the European Added Value Unit of the Directorate \nfor Impact Assessment and European Added Value, within the Directorate General for Parliamentary Research \nService (DG EPRS) of the General Secretariat of the European Parliament.\n\n LINGUISTIC VERSIONS\n\n\n\n Original: EN\n\n DISCLAIMER\n\n The opinions expressed in this document are the sole responsibility of the author and do not necessarily represent \nthe official position of the European Parliament.\n\n Reproduction and translation for non-commercial purposes are authorised, provided the source is acknowledged \nand the publisher is given prior notice and sent a copy.\n\n Manuscript completed in June 2016.\n\n Brussels \u00a9 European Union, 2016.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 38\n\n Contents\n\n Chapter 1 \u2013 Introduction .......................................................................................... 46\n\n I \u2013 Motivation ..................................................................................................... 46\n\n II \u2013 Background and context ............................................................................ 46\n\n 1.

Recent evidence suggests that suspensions of Schengen are associated with economic \ncosts related to trade barriers and traffic delays at border crossing points, among others things.\n\n Against this background, the European Parliament has commissioned RAND Europe to investigate the economic, \nsocial and political costs of non-Schengen, with a particular emphasis on civil liberties and home affairs. This study \naims to contribute to discussions about Schengen\u2019s sustainability in the light of the migration crisis by identifying the \ncosts of re-introducing border controls between Schengen member states, and by identifying the potential benefits \nof more concerted action at EU level compared to the lack of such action, or to action by member states on their \nown.\n\n The remit of this study includes both economic costs (such as re-introducing internal border controls) along with \nwider social and political costs (such as crime, and measures of security and trust). The focus on the latter types of \ncost reflects the fact that, as well as its economic benefits, Schengen has also been a building block of the EU\u2019s \nArea of Freedom, Security and Justice, and as such has an importance beyond the purely economic.\n\n\n\n Using a bottom-up cost-estimation approach, we estimated the fixed and operating costs of re-establishing internal \nborder controls within the Schengen Area. Under three scenarios, which differ in the assumption made about the \nlength and scope of the re-establishment of border controls, we conclude that reversing Schengen could cost \ncurrent Schengen states anywhere between \u20ac0.1bn and \u20ac19bn in fixed one-off costs, depending on the extent of \nborder crossing point reconstruction, and around \u20ac2\u20134bn in annual operating costs. The former corresponds to \naround 0.01\u20130.16 per cent and the latter to around 0.02\u20130.03 per cent of the current Schengen Area GDP.\n\n We also investigated the associations between Schengen and the abolishment of border controls with crime, \nsecurity and trust of citizens in national and European institutions. Our findings suggest that, contrary to the \npredictions of basic economic and criminological theory, rates in acquisitive crime (burglary, car theft, theft and \nrobberies) have not increased following the abolition of internal border controls. On the contrary, we found a more \npronounced downward trend after the 2007 Schengen enlargement in levels of crime in existing Schengen states \nwith direct borders to the newly acceding Schengen states compared to existing Schengen states lacking a direct \nborder with new members. This finding also held when we looked into border and non-border regions within these \ncountries. We also found positive associations between the abolition of internal border controls as a result of \nSchengen and the volume of seized drugs (cocaine and heroin), perhaps as a result of improved cross-border \npolice cooperation and information exchange. In addition, our findings suggest an upward trend in European \ncitizens\u2019 general trust in national and European institutions following the Schengen enlargement of 2007. This is an \nimportant finding as trust is seen as a major enabling factor in the working of the Schengen Area.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 45\n\n In light of this identification and, where possible, quantification of the costs of non-Schengen, this study discusses a \nseries of possible steps which could be taken to help return to a fully functioning Schengen Area and thus mitigate \nthe potential costs outlined above.\n\n With respect to the Schengen governance framework, our analysis found that the current arrangements are largely \nfit for purpose. There are areas where further steps can be made (and are underway), such continuing to improve \nmember states\u2019 use of and participation in the Schengen evaluation mechanism and the Schengen Information \nSystem. However, given the current political context, with its breakdown in trust and lack of solidarity among \nmember states, action in this area alone is unlikely to address the fundamental needs and concerns which have led \nmember states to re-introduce internal border controls. To achieve this goal, other steps may need to be \nconsidered in the areas of external border control, police and judicial cooperation, and asylum and migration \nacquis.\n\n Regarding external border controls, institutional capacity may be increased following the establishment of the \nEuropean Border and Coast Guard (EBCG) Agency, although the creation of the EBCG would not address \nchallenges stemming from reliance on member states\u2019 resources. Greater effectiveness of border checks can be \nachieved through initiatives such as systematic checks on EU nationals, the Entry\u2013Exit System, and the use of \ncommon risk indicators.\n\n Existing police and judicial cooperation arrangements would also benefit from improvements in information \ncollection and sharing between agencies and member states. In this regard, closing existing data gaps and \nincreasing the interoperability of existing (and any new) information systems are two areas for improvement. \n\n\n\nHowever, action in these two areas may have only limited impact on the immediate needs of member states that \nhave led to the reintroduction of internal border controls.\n\n Lastly, action in the area of migration, asylum and external relations may also result in benefits for the Schengen \nsystem by addressing underlying member states\u2019 concerns, namely the arrival and subsequent unmanaged \nsecondary movements of migrants. This appears to be the case with the currently pursued policy of reducing the \nnumber of irregular arrivals, to which a series of recent policy proposals may provide a more developed legal basis. \nHowever, this approach leaves a series of major fundamental right concerns unaddressed. In addition, as with the \nEBCG proposal, it does not appear to have large potential to address questions around solidarity and the reliance \non a small number of member states to provide an EU-wide public good.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 46\n\n CHAPTER 1 \u2013 INTRODUCTION\n\n I - Motivation\n\n Border-free movement within the Schengen Area is among the most visible achievements of the European Union \n(EU) and is considered one of its most cherished benefits (Peter 2015). This free movement of people across \nborders represents a key pillar of the EU treaty and is seen as one of the most valued achievements of the \nEuropean integration process, with the Schengen mechanism at its centre. As data from recent Eurobarometer \npolls highlights, almost a quarter of European citizens mention freedom of movement when asked what the EU \nmeans to them personally, while freedom of movement is mentioned as the second most positive result of EU \nintegration, just after the creation of a secure peace (EC 2015h).\n\n The unprecedented influx of asylum-seekers into the EU in 2015 has placed Schengen under considerable strain, \nwith several member states re-introducing controls on parts of their internal borders, thereby suspending the \nfunctioning of the Schengen Agreement. Subsequent studies (auf dem Brinke 2016; Aussilloux & Le Hir 2016) have \ndemonstrated that suspensions of Schengen are associated with considerable economic costs stemming from \nfactors such as traffic delays and barriers to trade. In addition, these costs may represent only a subset of possible \nlosses linked to an imperfect functioning of the Schengen Area, given that re-introducing border controls may have \nfurther social and political costs.\n\n The European Parliament has commissioned RAND Europe to examine whether there are other types of cost \nassociated with non-Schengen, with a special emphasis on civil liberties and home affairs. This study aims to \ncontribute to discussions about Schengen\u2019s sustainability in the light of the migration crisis by identifying the costs \nof re-introducing border controls between Schengen member states in economic, social and political terms, and the \npotential benefits of more concerted action at EU level, compared to the lack of such action or action by member \nstates on their own. The remit of this study includes both economic costs (such as the burden of re-introducing \ninternal border controls) along with wider social and political costs (such as crime, and measures of security and \ntrust). The focus on the latter types of cost reflects the fact that, as well as its economic benefits, Schengen has \nalso been a building block of the EU\u2019s Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (Guild et al. 2010), and as such has \nan importance beyond the purely economic.\n\n II - Background and context\n\n\n\n The development of the Schengen Area dates back to 1985 when five EU member states (Belgium, Germany, \nFrance, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) signed an agreement allowing for the gradual abolition of checks at their \ncommon borders. Five years later, the five countries signed a treaty implementing the Schengen Agreement which \nlaid out the basis for the agreement\u2019s implementation (the Schengen acquis). The actual removal of border controls \nin the Schengen Area took place in 1995, almost ten years after the signature of the original agreement.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 47\n\n In the 1990s, the Schengen Area expanded to include every EU member state except the United Kingdom and \nIreland, who maintain opt-ins.74 Similarly, all the member states which joined as part of the 2004 accession wave \n(with the exception of Cyprus) have become members of the Schengen Area, although the newest member states \n(Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia) have not yet joined the system. Non-EU countries can also become members, with \nfour (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland) having joined so far. Thus, the total current Schengen Area \nincludes 26 countries, of which 22 are EU member states (EC, n.d.).\n\n Initially, cooperation between the Schengen countries took the form of intergovernmental agreements outside the \nEU legal framework. Following the adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty, Schengen cooperation was incorporated into \nthe EU acquis. Schengen governance arrangements were incorporated into the activities of the Council of the EU \n(Council of the EU 1991). The council subsequently determined which legal provisions constituting the Schengen \nacquis were to be incorporated into the EU legal framework,75 and published these in 2000 (Council of the EU \n2000b). Since then, the Schengen acquis has been further developed by subsequent legislative acts such as the \nSchengen Borders Code (SBC), adopted in 2006. The EU undertook a reform of the Schengen governance system \nin 2013. During this process, the Schengen Borders Code\u2019s provisions for temporary re-introduction of border \ncontrols at internal borders were amended (EU 2013)76 and an evaluation and monitoring mechanism set up, \ncharged with assessing the application of the Schengen acquis by member states (Council of the EU 2013a).\n\n Importantly, the removal of internal border controls in the Schengen Area has been accompanied by a \nharmonisation of rules concerning the area\u2019s common external border.77 This harmonisation includes common \nrules for conditions of entry (EU 2006) and short-stay visas (EU 2009b). In addition, in an attempt to balance \nconsiderations of freedom and security, a series of \u2018compensatory\u2019 (EU 2009a) measures were adopted by \nSchengen countries to strengthen police and judicial cooperation among participating countries.78 The Schengen \nInformation System (SIS) was established, followed by the introduction of its second generation version in 2013, \nenabling countries to share information about\n\n 74 The new Schengen countries were (year of signing the agreement in brackets): Italy (1990), Portugal (1991), \nSpain (1991), Greece (1992), Austria (1995), Denmark (1996), Finland (1996) and Sweden (1996).\n\n 75 As Huybreghts (2015) points out, this step was triggered by the need to determine the legal basis for each part \nof the Schengen acquis in the new pillar system created by the Amsterdam Treaty. In addition, the council needed \nto identify Schengen provisions which had already been superseded by EU developments in the Justice and Home \nAffairs (JHA) area and were thus no longer relevant.\n\n 76 The SBC was codified in March 2016 in the EU (2016a).\n\n\n\n 77 These rules are codified in the aforementioned Schengen Borders Code. In addition, in 2006, the Commission \npublished a Practical Handbook for Border Guards (Schengen Handbook), intended as a tool for national \nauthorities to help ensure a uniform execution of border control tasks (Council of the EU 2006).\n\n 78 While not part of the Schengen Area, the United Kingdom and Ireland opted into Schengen\u2019s cooperation \nmechanisms (Council of the EU 2000a; Council of the EU 2002).\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 48\n\n individuals and goods between relevant border, law-enforcement and judicial authorities.79\n\n 1. Current challenges to the Schengen system\n\n The recent influx of irregular migrants and refugees to Europe80 has put the Schengen system under considerable \nstrain and has led to several Schengen countries re-introducing border checks on a temporary basis.\n\n The possibility of re-introducing controls at internal Schengen borders is foreseen in the Schengen Borders Code, \nwhose Article 2581 lays out a general framework for the re-introduction of controls where there is a \u2018serious threat \nto public policy or internal security\u2019 in a given country. In such a case, the country may decide to re-introduce \ncontrols for up to six months, provided that the border controls represent a \u2018last resort\u2019 option and are temporary in \nnature (Guild et al. 2015). Article 26 of the SBC specifies the criteria for any member state\u2019s re-introduction of \ninternal border controls, namely \u2018any threats to [member state\u2019s] public policy or internal security\u2019 and the likely \nimpact of the re-introduction itself. Article 27 of the SBC further specifies the procedure for the re-introduction of \nborder controls and lays out the pertinent notification requirements (giving at least four weeks\u2019 notice) in order to \ninform all relevant stakeholders including other Schengen countries, the European Commission, European \nParliament and the Council of the EU.\n\n For situations that necessitate immediate action, Article 28 of the SBC allows for short-term (up to ten days, with \npossible extensions) emergency action. In addition, Article 29 includes a provision for situations where \u2018the overall \nfunctioning of the area without internal border control is put at risk as a result of persistent serious deficiencies \nrelating to external border control\u2019 and allows the re-introduction of border controls for a period of up to two years \n(an initial six-months period, followed by up to three six-month extensions). Importantly, unlike measures taken \nunder Articles 25 or 28, re-introduction of border controls under Article 29 can take place based on a \nrecommendation from the Council of the EU, which itself should be based on a proposal from the European \nCommission. Article 30 lays out the criteria to be taken into consideration with respect to any border control re-\nintroductions made in accordance with Article 29.\n\n 79 For a more detailed description of Schengen\u2019s compensatory measures, see for instance Delivet (2015).\n\n 80 The International Organisation for Migration estimated that the number of arrivals in Europe during 2015 \nexceeded one million people, and that the number of arrivals in the first two months of 2016 was much larger than \nthat over the same period in 2015 (IOM 2015; IOM 2016).\n\n 81 The numbering of SBC Articles in this report is done in accordance using the codified version from March 2016, \nwhich may result in discrepancies with older texts referencing the SBC.\n\n\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 49\n\n Table 1.1: Overview of SBC provisions dealing with the temporary re-introduction of internal border controls\n\n SBC Article\n\n Provision\n\n Article 25\n\n Provides for temporary re-introduction of controls in response to a \u2018serious threat to public policy or internal \nsecurity\u2019 (up to six months)\n\n Article 26\n\n Criteria for temporary re-introduction of controls under Articles 25 and 28\n\n Article 27\n\n Procedure for re-introduction of controls under Article 25\n\n Article 28\n\n Provides for temporary re-introduction of controls in cases requiring immediate action (up to two months)\n\n Article 29\n\n Provides for temporary re-introduction of controls in cases where the overall functioning of the Schengen Area is at \nrisk (up to two years)\n\n Article 30\n\n Criteria for temporary re-introduction of controls under Article 29\n\n In September 2015, Germany was the first country to resort to temporary measures under Article 28 and re-\nintroduced controls at its border with Austria (Council of the EU 2015j). In November 2015, facing a deadline after \nwhich Article 28 border controls could not be sustained, Germany announced that it would keep controls in place \nunder the provision of Article 25, thereby availing itself of an additional six months in order to maintain border \nchecks. Austria followed suit shortly after the original German announcement and re-introduced Article 28 controls \nat its borders with Hungary, Italy, Slovakia and Slovenia (Council of the EU 2015i). As with the German case, \nAustrian controls were reclassified as Article 25 measures in November 2015. One day after Austria, Slovenia also \nannounced the re-introduction of temporary controls at its border with Hungary (Council of the EU 2015k). \nHowever, unlike Germany and Austria, Slovenia terminated its temporary controls in October 2015 (Council of the \nEU 2015l).\n\n\n\n Since the initial announcements in September 2015, several other Schengen countries (Belgium, Denmark, \nFrance,82 Germany, Hungary, Norway and Sweden) have taken similar measures.\n\n The temporary re-introduction of border controls in accordance with the provisions discussed above by Schengen \ncountries is not necessarily an unusual development. In fact, countries have routinely made use of these, for \ninstance in the context of high-profile events taking place in a given country or in response to serious public health \nrisks.83 However, the recent succession of individual countries invoking the relevant SBC\n\n 82 France initially introduced temporary border controls in connection with a climate change conference in Paris \nheld in November and December 2015. Following the November terrorist attacks in Paris and the subsequent \ndeclaration of a state of emergency, the already established controls were retained (Council of the EU 2015h).\n\n 83 See, for instance, Carrera et al. (2011) and Groenendijk (2004).\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 50\n\n provisions and continued \u2019serious deficiencies\u2019 with respect to external border controls in Greece (EC 2016b) has \ngiven rise to questions about the system\u2019s future.84\n\n Various European Union bodies have clearly stated their commitment to preserving internal border-free movement \n(EP 2015b), notably in a Council Recommendation of 12 February 2016 describing steps to address deficiencies in \nexternal borders (Council of the EU 2016d) and in the EC\u2019s March 2016 communication on a roadmap for restoring \na fully functioning Schengen system (EC 2016a). This roadmap outlined steps to be taken, mostly concerning \nimprovements in Greece\u2019s ability to manage its part of the Schengen external border, resumption of Dublin \ntransfers to Greece, and provision of assistance to Greece. The roadmap established a progress-monitoring \nschedule to help the EC determine whether the situation had improved sufficiently to avoid the invocation of SBC \nArticle 29. In early May 2016,85 based on reporting from Greece and its own assessment, the EC concluded that \nwhile substantial progress had been made by Greece, not all previously identified serious deficiencies in external \nborder management had been sufficiently addressed (EC 2016n). As a result, the EC recommended that the \nCouncil of the EU issue a decision allowing member states to maintain internal border controls, albeit only with a \nlimited scope and for a period of up to six months. The council adopted these recommendations in a 12 May 2016 \nDecision (Council of the EU 2016b).\n\n 2. Links between Schengen and other policy areas\n\n From the perspective of the member states that have re-introduced temporary border controls since September \n2015, the main challenge to border-free movement stems from factors external to the Schengen governance \nframework. This is well documented in justifications for the re-introduction of internal border controls submitted to \nthe Council of the EU in line with the relevant SBC provisions outlined above. As summarised in Table 1.2, the most \nfrequently cited reason is the uncontrolled influx of undocumented migrants and security threats. The aim of this \npaper is not to examine the legality or appropriateness of these justifications86 but simply to note them as an \nexpression of the political context in which member states have taken the decision to re-introduce internal border \ncontrols, and as a statement of member states\u2019 needs which must be addressed if there is to be a return to the \nnormal functioning of Schengen. Therefore, a consideration of policy options to improve the functioning of the \n\n\n\nSchengen Area needs to take into account the Schengen framework as well as other policy areas, which is \nreflected in the scope of this study.\n\n 84 In this context, it is worth recalling a short-lived discussion to establish a mini-Schengen (limited to Benelux, \nAustria and Germany) floated by Dutch representatives in December 2015 (Guild et al. 2015).\n\n 85 The timing of this assessment is set so that its results are known before the lapse of any border controls \nintroduced by member states under Article 25 of the SBC.\n\n 86 This aspect will be examined as part of a parallel paper completed by the Centre for European Policy Studies.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 51\n\n Table 1.2: Overview of selected temporary re-introductions of internal border controls in Schengen countries since \nSeptember 2015\n\n Country\n\n Date of notification\n\n Stated reason\n\n Document ref.\n\n Germany\n\n September 2015\n\n Uncontrolled influx of third-country nationals\n\n 11986/15\n\n Austria\n\n September 2015\n\n Influx of third-country nationals\n\n 12110/15\n\n Slovenia\n\n September 2015\n\n Uncontrollable migration flow\n\n 12111/15\n\n\n\n Sweden\n\n November 2015\n\n Unprecedented migratory pressure\n\n 14047/15\n\n Norway\n\n November 2015\n\n Unpredictable migratory pressure\n\n 14633/15\n\n France\n\n December 2015\n\n State of emergency following November 2015 terrorist attacks\n\n 15181/15\n\n Denmark\n\n January 2016\n\n Unprecedented migration pressure\n\n 5021/16\n\n In addition to member-state notifications, this interconnectedness of policy areas is acknowledged both in official \nEU documentation and the academic literature. To illustrate, the latest EC report on the functioning of Schengen \nnoted that \u2018although the asylum legislation is not part of the Schengen acquis, it is obvious that the refugee crisis \nhas significant consequences for the situation at the EU\u2019s external borders and within the Schengen area\u2019 (EC \n2015b, 3). Similarly, the EC report \u2018State of Play of Implementation of the Priority Actions under the European \nAgenda on Migration\u2019 notes that \u2018the Union\u2019s ability to maintain an area free from internal border control is \ncontingent on having secure external borders\u2019 (EC 2016e, 13). Also, acknowledging the linkage between \nSchengen and police and judicial cooperation, the European Agenda on Security (EC 2015f) hails the Schengen \nInformation System as one of the most important tools for law enforcement cooperation in the EU.\n\n Put slightly differently, the current challenges to the Schengen system do not necessarily stem from inadequacies \nin the Schengen governance framework itself. For instance, Steve Peers (2015a) suggested that the current issues \nobserved in Greece and the resulting Schengen suspensions are a product of deficiencies in the EU\u2019s asylum \nsystem rather than Greek border management per se. Similarly, Bertoncini and Vitorino (2016) argued that the \nSchengen Area, rather than contributing to the asylum-seeker crisis, was its \u2018collateral victim\u2019. The need to address \n\n\n\nexternal factors in the interest of the Schengen Area is also acknowledged in the latest European Commission \nreport on the functioning of Schengen, which noted that:\n\n addressing the two major challenges faced in the Schengen area \u2014 the refugee crisis and the terrorist threat \u2014 \nrequires full and correct implementation of the measures already contained in the two sets of documents tabled by \nthe Commission in spring [2015]: the European Agenda on Migration and the European Agenda on Security (EC \n2015b)\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 52\n\n 3. Role of trust and democratic legitimacy in the current challenge to Schengen\n\n Given the importance of the political context in the re-introduction of internal border controls, the role of trust (or, \nmore precisely, a breakdown thereof) needs to be acknowledged. This is applicable at two distinct levels: (1) trust \nbetween individual member states, and (2) trust between the public and national and EU institutions. The first \ndimension, trust among member states, represents the \u2018basis of Schengen cooperation\u2019 given that individual \nmember states need to have confidence that their partners\u2019 policies and controls are adequate and similar enough \nto warrant the removal of internal borders (Pascouau 2012). However, as pointed out by Sinkkonen (2016), this \ntype of trust has diminished, as demonstrated by \u2018blame games\u2019 over which member state has failed to uphold their \nobligations. This is echoed by Bertoncini and Vitorino (2016), who argue that the \u2018tension undermining the \nSchengen area is a result first and foremost of a crisis in trust among the member states\u2019.\n\n Public trust in institutions is the second dimension of the underlying issue. Trust in institutions across the EU had \nbeen decreasing with the continuation of the migrant crisis (Atwater 2015), which may reflect a general trend \nregarding confidence in governments\u2019 ability to address public concerns.87 This trend is particularly relevant for EU \ninstitutions since, as numerous observers (Majone 1998; Scharpf 1999) have argued, there appears to be a link \nbetween effectiveness and legitimacy with respect to EU policymaking.88 Pedersen (2015) argued that this may be \nparticularly the case with respect to security policies. Using the example of the Schengen Information System (SIS) \nand Eurodac, he suggested that if the problem-solving capacity of these tools is encumbered, \u2018the legitimacy of the \ninstruments and ultimately the Schengen agreements in their present form could be seriously endangered\u2019.\n\n Therefore, the breakdown of inter-member state trust and the lack of public trust in the EU\u2019s ability to uphold \nsecurity and common migration and asylum policy need to be understood as a direct contributing factor to the \npolitical context that has led member states to re-introduce temporary internal border controls. This observation \nfurther underscores the point made above that policy initiatives aimed at reinstating Schengen to its full functionality \nneed to extend beyond the Schengen governance framework.\n\n 87 The re-introduction of temporary border controls needs to be seen in this context. As Pastore and Henry (2016) \nnoted, the very first re-introduction of border controls, by Germany in September 2015, represented a notable \nturnaround in German policy, prompted by a sudden spike in migrant arrivals in Bavaria not long after the German \ngovernment\u2019s very welcoming initial stance.\n\n 88 More recently, in a reference to the refugee crisis, Emmott (2015) observed that the purpose of the EU has \ncome under question in relation to its inability to find a solution.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n\n\n PE 581.387 53\n\n 4. Gaps in intra-EU solidarity as a factor contributing to trust breakdowns\n\n Inseparable from the issue of trust is the notion of solidarity among member states, both in terms of respecting \nobligations to uphold common rules and in implementing financial and operational assistance schemes (Pascouau \n2012). While member states have not always complied with their obligations under the existing Schengen migration \nand asylum acquis, it remains a matter of debate as to what extent these obligations were realistic to start with, \nparticularly in light of recent migration volumes. A range of solidarity and assistance mechanisms has been \nproposed and, to a varying degree of success, implemented, in line with Article 80 of the TFEU (Treaty on the \nFunctioning of the European Union) on solidarity and the fair sharing of obligations, including areas of border \ncontrol, migration and asylum (EP 2015d). However, no information exists on how these assistance mechanisms \ncompare to the overall needs of border countries and what resources these countries would need to fully meet their \nobligations under the current circumstances. Solidarity mechanisms require a small number of member states to \nprovide at a disproportionate cost a service to the entire EU/Schengen Area, and the degree to which existing \nassistance mechanisms fall short of these countries\u2019 current needs remains an open question.89\n\n To illustrate, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) conducted a review (ECA 2014) of spending under the External \nBorders Fund, which focuses on management of the external Schengen border. The review concluded that while \nthe fund had contributed to financial solidarity among member states, it was impossible to determine its results and \nimpact due to deficiencies in the relevant authorities\u2019 monitoring and ex-post evaluations. In response, the ECA \nrecommended that member states develop measurable targets, coupled with progress indicators in terms of the \nfund\u2019s outputs, outcomes and impacts.\n\n Similarly, in 2016 the ECA published the results (ECA 2016) of an audit of EU spending related to migration in \nSouthern Mediterranean and Eastern Neighbourhood countries. As with the 2014 report, this audit concluded that it \nwas difficult to provide a measurement of the outcome of EU spending in this area and called for the \nimplementation of a set of \u2018clear and measurable objectives\u2019.\n\n In addition to their design, at least some existing solidarity mechanisms appear to have been hampered by the lack \nof member states\u2019 participation and cooperation. One example is the current scheme for the relocation of asylum \nseekers. In September 2015, the Council of the EU issued two decisions introducing (Council of the EU 2015b) and \nsubsequently amending (Council of the EU 2015c) a mechanism whereby asylum seekers would be redistributed to \nother Schengen countries.90 However, shortly after the adoption of these\n\n 89 It is worth stressing that the issue of solidarity and burden-sharing is not a new question but one that has been \nposed many times before. See, for instance, EP (2010); Thielemann (2006), Thielemann (2008) and Eiko and \nArmstrong (2012).\n\n 90 As Carrera and Guild (2015) point out, in addition to introducing a measure of solidarity, a related reason for the \nproposed relocation mechanisms was the failure of some member states to comply with their obligations under the \nReceptions Conditions Directive 2013/33\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 54\n\n decisions, the possibility of forcing uncooperative member states into compliance came into question.91\n\n\n\n Subsequent developments have largely confirmed these concerns. The relocation mechanism continues to attract \nstrong opposition, particularly from new EU member states,92 and in December 2015, Slovakia challenged the \ndecision before the Court of Justice for the European Union (CJEU) (Vikarska 2015). Other countries, while not in \nprinciple opposed to the decision, have largely not come anywhere near fulfilling their share of relocations. \nTherefore, the numbers of actually relocated asylum seekers has lagged far behind the original plans and remains \nextremely low (EC 2016r).93 In addition, in some instances relocated asylum seekers failed to stay in the country \nallocated to them and attempted to move to a different country (Lazarov\u00e1, 2016). In light of these events, the \nscheme was considered a failure by various commentators as early as January 2016 (de la Baume 2016; Peers \n2016a; Maiani 2016). Notably, the relocation mechanism is not the only scheme where member-state participation \nhas fallen short of projected needs. Other examples include hotspots in Greece and Italy, which have been affected \nby a lack of seconded staff from member states (EC 2016e; Kaca 2016).\n\n 5. Economic, social and political costs resulting from imperfect functioning of the Schengen Area\n\n The political context in which member states have re-introduced internal border controls also provides a good \nindication of what can be conceptualized as costs associated with gaps in the functioning of Schengen. Economic \ncosts of various forms (e.g. direct administrative costs associated with the management of re-introduced borders, \nmacro-economic costs stemming from disruptions to trade and travel, and so on) are an obvious category and have \nbeen discussed in existing literature.\n\n Multiple studies have estimated the economic costs of the removal of Schengen border-free movement (also \ndubbed \u2018the costs of non-Schengen\u2019) with regard to trade, waiting times and impact on financial markets \u2013 see for \nexample reports by the EPRS (EP 2016b), Jacques Delors Institute (auf dem Brinke 2016), EC (2016a) and France \nStrat\u00e9gie (Aussilloux & Le\n\n to provide acceptable conditions for asylum seekers. For a discussion of the situation in Greece, see for instance \nHRW (2011).\n\n 91 See, for instance, Peers (2015b). One of the underlying considerations being that while the EC could initiate \ninfringement proceedings, this is a very lengthy process and at its end member states may prefer simply to pay the \nfinancial penalty. Interestingly, financial penalties were explicitly built into the new version of the relocation \nmechanism proposed by the EC in May 2016.\n\n 92 The Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia voted against the Council of the EU Decision of 22 \nSeptember 2015. The decision was passed using the qualified majority voting procedure.\n\n 93 While engagement of member states (or lack thereof) seems to be one of the key factors, other underlying \nfactors also need to be acknowledged. These include, among others, the administrative compexity of the scheme \nand its lack of attractiveness to asylum seekers. See, for instance, EC (2016v).\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 55\n\n Hir 2016). These reports demonstrated that an abolishment of the Schengen agreement could have a detrimental \nimpact on the European economy and its member states. However, these studies either did not consider the \nrunning costs of border re-establishment or included only a brief analysis of such costs based on an extrapolation \nof previous, often hardly comparable, estimates.\n\n\n\n A more thorough analysis of a related topic can be found in another report published by the EC (2016c), which \nestimates the costs of \u2018smart borders\u2019 (modern self-service gates and kiosks) implemented at the external borders \nof the EU. Unfortunately, the report considers only changes to the running costs of existing external borders \ninstead of looking at internal borders as well. Finally, yet another EC report (2016j) looks directly at the additional \nadministrative and fiscal costs, suggesting that they would range from \u20ac0.6bn to \u20ac5.8bn annually based on a 1993 \nestimate of public administrative costs in the range of 0.1\u20130.2 per cent of the total value of intra-community trade, \nand on the EU standard-cost model for the reduction of regulatory burden from 2004 (EC 2004). Table 1.3 provides \na summary of the various economic cost estimates.\n\n In addition to economic costs, re-introducing intra-EU borders may have wider social and political costs. For \nexample, Schengen is an integral part of the EU\u2019s Area of Freedom, Safety and Justice (Guild et al. 2010) while the \nabolition of internal borders routinely ranks among the most popular EU achievements among general public (Peter \n2015). It is noted that to ensure security within the border-free area, Schengen states have increased police \ncooperation to tackle organised cross-border crime and terrorism. Cross-border surveillance, hot pursuits,94 the \nestablishment of joint police centres and the SIS are particular examples of intra-Schengen cooperation.\n\n Hence, the costs of non-Schengen may also be conceptualised by considering what Schengen was supposed to \ndeliver. In addition to creating a border-free travel area, Schengen (and in particular its compensatory measures) \nwas intended to result95 \u2013 and according to some authors (Vitorino & Bertoncini 2015) may actually have resulted \u2013 \nin a more secure area. Therefore, it is possible that there are safety and security costs associated with non-\nSchengen which merit greater examination (Gros 2015). However, in light of recent migration waves and terrorist \nattacks some argue that border controls are essential to safeguard national internal security (Vasilopoulou 2013). \nThe underlying reasoning behind this argument is that the lack of internal border controls may allow criminals and \nterrorists to operate in one country and hide in another, making legal prosecution and enforcement more difficult.\n\n The majority of evidence is anecdotal, however, and there is only sparse empirical evidence \u2013 P\u00e1na (2011), for \ninstance, highlighted that after the Czech Schengen accession in 2007 no\n\n 94 \u2018Hot pursuits\u2019 allow the police force from one Schengen state catching criminals in the act of committing serious \noffences to pursue them across borders and detain them on the territory of another Schengen state.\n\n 95 Bertoncini and Vitorino (2016) argued that the original security dimension of Schengen has been played down in \nthe recent debate surrounding the re-introduction of internal border controls.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 56\n\n overall significant increase in crime was observed. In Austrian and German border regions no increase in crime \nwas reported; on the contrary, in some of the border regions overall crime levels even decreased. P\u00e1na (2011) also \nmentioned that one other change in the border areas was a decrease of prostitution due to the end of large queues \nat border crossings, which previously represented an opportunity for prostitutes to find clients. Ademmer et al. \n(2015) came to a similar conclusion by looking at German regions bordering the Czech Republic and Poland. This \nstudy looked at four German states (Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Brandenburg, Saxony and Bavaria) bordering \nthese two countries and examined how criminal activity had evolved in them after Schengen compared to non-\nborder states. The idea was that these four states would have been adversely affected compared to non-border \nstates, although the study findings suggested that while crime rates have generally decreased across Germany, \ncriminal activity in German states bordering Poland and the Czech Republic in fact decreased relatively more over \n\n\n\nthe period between 2006 (the last full year border checks were in place) and 2014. A similar pattern was observed \nwhen looking only at property crime, and while the results are merely descriptive (and the authors acknowledge that \nmore in-depth analysis is required to shed light on causal effects), the findings at least suggest that the abolition of \nborder controls may have led to a decrease in criminal activity in German states not bordering new member \nstates.\n\n In contrast to the studies above, McCabe (2015) looked at a different type of crime pursued by organised crime \ngroups across Europe: drug trafficking. This study found a negative association between joining Schengen and a \ncountry\u2019s volume of heroin seizures, suggesting that Schengen states intercept less heroin than they would as a \nnon-Schengen state. The study examines cross-country differences and long-term trends in the quantities of heroin \nseized by comparing Schengen with non-Schengen countries. However, it does not compare the total volume of \nheroin seized by countries after joining Schengen to their pre-Schengen levels, which would have shed more light \non the potential causality of this association. We investigate this point in more detail below.\n\n Looking at political costs, the discontinuation of Schengen, particularly if seen as connected to the EU\u2019s inability to \nuphold its migration and asylum policies, may contribute to losses in public trust in the European project or other \nareas of trust relating to national and international institutions (Heinrich B\u00f6ll Stiftung 2016).\n\n Table 1.3: Overview of selected studies estimating the costs of non-Schengen\n\n Study\n\n Methodology\n\n Findings\n\n Cecchini (1988).

As outlined above, although recent literature has provided a good evidence base relating \nto the macro-economic cost of non-Schengen, there remains a gap in the evidence base concerning potential \nbudgetary costs along with wider social and political costs. This paper aims to bridge that gap.\n\n While social and political costs can take many different forms, we focus on those related to justice and home \naffairs, including crime, safety and security, and trust.\n\n Additionally, given the likelihood of substantial costs associated with an imperfect functioning of the Schengen \nArea, this study seeks to identify the potential benefits of more concerted action at EU level which could enable \nSchengen to return to full functioning, with resulting benefits. In its analysis of policy options and areas requiring \nmore concerted action at the EU level, the paper notes the political context in which internal borders were re-\nintroduced and of the needs of the member states responsible. Therefore, in addition to the Schengen governance \nframework, the following external domains are also examined: external border control, migration and asylum \nacquis, and police and judicial cooperation.\n\n In essence, this paper seeks to address two main research questions which can be divided into further sub-\nquestions as follows:\n\n 1) What are the economic, social and political costs of the re-introduction of border controls in the area of justice \nand home affairs?\n\n a.

What is the empirical association between Schengen and various modalities and levels of trust?\n\n 2) Would potential benefits result from more concerted action at the EU level within the current Schengen \ngovernance framework, or by external factors?\n\n It is important to acknowledge the limited timeframe of this study, resulting in constraints on the paper\u2019s scope and \nlevel of detail. We could also have looked further into other areas of crime (such as human trafficking) related to \nborder controls or the lack thereof, but due to the absence of existing quantitative data have not pursued that area \nof research.\n\n IV - Research approach and limitations\n\n A number of different research activities have been undertaken to produce this paper. Overall, we applied a mix of \nqualitative and quantitative methods including desk research and literature review, semi-structured interviews with \ndifferent stakeholders, cost-modelling and econometric-modelling techniques. Our approach is as comprehensive \nas has been possible within the timeframe of this study, although a few limitations need to be highlighted.\n\n i. Conceptual limitation: what is \u2018non-Schengen\u2019?\n\n An underlying conceptual challenge to this study is a lack of clarity concerning the most accurate description of \n\u2018non-Schengen\u2019. A somewhat crude approach would be to imagine Schengen as a binary choice, i.e. either the \nSchengen Area and its provisions are in place for a given country, or they are not. This is the approach this paper \ntakes for a subset of analyses owing to methodological and data considerations.\n\n In reality, however, the spectrum of options is more complex, and the forms in which Schengen may function are \nmore varied. For instance, based on the Council of the EU\u2019s decision of 12 May 2016 (Council of the EU 2016b), \ninternal border controls are maintained by five countries. In each of these countries controls are carried out only at \na subset of their respective borders and checks are intended to be targeted and limited in scope. However, future \nre-introductions of internal borders may be of a completely different scope. Furthermore, the duration of temporary \ncontrols can be subject to change, adding complexity to efforts at estimating their impact. The temporary nature of \nre-introduced border controls may make countries reluctant to make investments in longer-term solutions and \narrangements, thereby relying on measures of a more stopgap nature. In estimating economic costs, this paper \nattempts to address this uncertainty and variation by introducing a series of sensitivity analyses.\n\n In addition, even in the event of a discontinuation of the internal border-free area, it is conceivable that some \nSchengen compensatory measures and other related features would be retained. This applies particularly to the \nSchengen Information System, described by one interviewee as \u2018by far the largest cooperation system on the \nplanet\u2019. This poses a challenge for estimations based on comparisons with status quo ante, i.e. the situation before \nthe establishment of Schengen or before a given country\u2019s accession to the area. Put\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 59\n\n differently, one way of thinking about the costs of non-Europe is that they represent the opposite of EU added \nvalue. Viewed from this perspective, even in the event of a complete re-introduction of internal border controls in \nthe Schengen Area, some EU added value stemming from the Schengen governance framework is likely to be \n\n\n\nretained, such as in the form of improved law-enforcement cooperation. It is therefore unlikely that the costs of \ncomplete non-Schengen would equal the totality of Schengen\u2019s EU added value.\n\n 1. Methodological limitations\n\n The study was undertaken in a constrained time-span which determined the extent of the analysis. For instance, \nthe cost-modelling approach applied in this paper is based on relatively scarce data and assumptions had to be \nmade throughout the modelling process to extrapolate and/or aggregate missing input data for a wider set of \ncountries. With more time available more data points could have potentially been collected. Nevertheless, we have \nclearly highlighted all assumptions made and, in line with good practice, provide a range of cost estimates based on \nsensitivity analyses.\n\n In addition, the report uses data on criminal activities. Such data comes with caveats and is not always available at \nall geographic levels of analysis (e.g. country or regional level) over a longer period of time. This has to some extent \ndetermined the empirical analyses conducted in this paper. It is also important to note that all empirical estimates in \nthis paper should be interpreted as associations rather than causal effects. The specific limitations of the empirical \napproach taken in this paper are discussed in the relevant sections of chapter 2.\n\n 2. Limitations of policy assessments\n\n EU institutions have been very active in the past two years as far as policymaking in Schengen-related areas is \nconcerned. Relevant examples range from the adoption of documents setting out broad policy direction (such as \nthe European Agenda on Migration and its security counterpart) to concrete legislative proposals (such as the \nproposal to establish the European Border and Coast Guard) along with the development of tools to complement \nexisting policies (such as common risk indicators). These recent undertakings are currently in various stages of \ntheir policy life \u2013 some are still under consideration while some are in the early stage of implementation. This poses \nseveral challenges for an analysis of their impacts. In the case of recently implemented initiatives, there may not be \nenough evidence available. For initiatives that are currently under consideration, their final form \u2013 which itself may \nvary substantially from the initial proposal \u2013 may not have been agreed on. In addition, while some policy proposals \nhave been accompanied by an impact assessment, as Malmersjo and Rem\u00e1\u010d (2016) noted, this is by no means a \nuniversal occurrence.\n\n V - Structure of the paper\n\n This research paper is structured as follows:\n\n - Chapter 2 aims to quantify the economic, social and political cost of non-Schengen from a home affairs and civil \nliberties perspective;\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 60\n\n - Chapter 3 examines different options where action at EU level could lead to beneficial outcomes compared to the \ncurrent state of play;\n\n - Chapter 4 provides a report summary and conclusions.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n\n\n PE 581.387 61\n\n CHAPTER 2 \u2013 QUANTIFYING THE COSTS OF NON-SCHENGEN IN ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL \nTERMS: A HOME AFFAIRS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES PERSPECTIVE\n\n I -Analytical approach\n\n As outlined in chapter 1, the goal of this paper is to add to the existing evidence base on the potential economic, \nsocial and political costs of \u2018non-Schengen\u2019 \u2013 or, in other words, what Europe could lose by reversing the current \ninternal border-free zone within the Schengen Area.\n\n With regard to economic costs, this study focuses on the potential costs of physically rebuilding borders between \nSchengen states. In principle, these costs can be divided into direct and indirect (opportunity) costs, which can in \nturn be further differentiated by the type of affected subject. To that end we apply a cost-modelling approach taking \ninto account information from a variety of sources.\n\n Concerning social and political costs, we use econometric-modelling techniques to investigate the association \nbetween Schengen and different types of crime, including acquisitive and violent crime, as well as the illicit drug \ntrade. We also explore associations between Schengen and different measures of trust, including interpersonal \ntrust and trust in national and transnational institutions. For potential social and political costs we examine both \ncross-country and within-country trends and changes by comparing border and non-border regions. Specific \nanalyses are outlined in more detail below.\n\n II - Economic costs: direct budgetary impact of re-introducing internal border controls\n\n 1. A cost-estimation approach\n\n In order to calculate the potential budgetary costs of re-establishing border controls we use a bottom-up cost-\nmodelling approach, breaking the total expected costs down by type of expense (one-off fixed costs and operating \ncosts), attaching a value to each category and country, and summing those up to provide a total estimate. Each \nindividual estimate is calculated using either country-specific parameters or appropriately modified parameters from \nother countries. Although more complicated and demanding than the alternative (i.e. a top-down cost estimation \nbased on dividing total expenditure by total units of activity), a bottom-up approach is more transparent and \nversatile, and facilitates use of the analysis in different scenarios (Cabinet Office, n.d.). Moreover, a top-down \napproach is infeasible in our study to start with due to lack of data on the total costs of border protection at country \nlevel.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 62\n\n In essence, the direct budgetary costs of re-introducing border controls can in principle be divided into two \ncategories depending on their re-occurrence and dependency on other factors (see Figure 2.1):\n\n 1. Fixed costs of setting up or reconstructing border crossing points, including building new checkpoints, \nrefurbishing older unused outposts, purchasing computers, scanners, and other IT equipment, developing \n\n\n\nsupporting IT infrastructure, purchasing personal equipment for border force officers, patrol vehicles, related \ninfrastructure, and project management and training for new border-force employees. We assume that fixed costs \nare a function of country, border-outpost size, type (air/land/maritime) and total number, as depicted in Figure 2.1. \nThat is, establishing a border outpost will: (1) generally be more expensive in richer countries, particularly due to \nhigher prices and also possibly more expensive equipment used; (2) will depend on outpost size and intended \ntraffic capacity; and (3) will be more expensive for land border outposts that need to be completely refurbished or \nwholly rebuilt compared to air and maritime borders (see below). Total costs will be the sum of expenses required \nto re-establish each individual border outpost.\n\n 2. Operating, patrolling, administrative and maintenance costs of day-to-day border controls, consisting principally \nof border-force salaries, equipment maintenance, fuel, law-enforcement activities and administrative expenses \nsuch as visa checks. As with fixed costs, operating costs will mainly depend on the number, type and size of border \ncrossing points, as well as on the length and type of the border itself. Every border outpost requires border \nagency officers and infrastructure maintenance, but borders with a lower density of border outposts are more \nexpensive to patrol. There are also substantial costs related to law enforcement and administration. Again, richer \ncountries are more likely to see higher expenses per border outpost or 100 km of border length.\n\n In the following we do not consider potential increases in the costs of processing visas as it is difficult to estimate \nthe number of additional applications, while countries may have existing capacity to cover any increases in demand. \nIn addition, there are no national data on the extent to which processing costs can be recovered through user fees \nand it is possible that all costs would be covered this way.\n\n In principle, one-off fixed costs are related mainly to the number of border crossing points and their location, type \nand size, whereas operating costs depend more on the number of border-force employees and border crossings, \nor on the length and structure of land borders (Figure 2.1). Unfortunately, the theoretical model cannot be fully \nreflected in the calculation due to data limitation, particularly the lack of a detailed cost breakdown. In the following, \nwe first introduce variables relevant for both cost categories, discuss their calibration at the national level, and \nsubsequently calculate estimated direct budgetary costs in two proposed scenarios.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 63\n\n Figure 2.1: Cost-estimation diagram\n\n It is important to stress that estimating the budgetary costs of reversing the Schengen Agreement is difficult due to \nthe shortage of detailed data (e.g. the lack of a land border crossing points register as a result of absent internal \nborder controls), the diversity of possible scenarios, and methodological limitations. To that end, any predictions \nare by definition uncertain. In order to diminish the degree of uncertainty we provide a range of estimates for a set \nof different scenarios complemented by sensitivity analysis. That is to say, scenarios serve to identify the main \npossible paths of future development (for example either the permanent re-introduction of borders or just a time-\nlimited alternative) while sensitivity analysis works with the underlying parameters and induces variation within each \nscenario to provide information on the effect of a change in parameter estimates on the resulting costs.96\n\n Below we discuss how we calculate the different cost elements as outlined in Figure 2.1 to obtain the total costs of \nre-establishing borders in the Schengen Area.\n\n\n\n 2. Border crossing points\n\n In order to assess the costs of re-establishing borders it is important to discuss first the different types of borders.\n\n 96 This may be illustrated by looking at the time required to perform a passport check. A European Commission \n(2016j) report suggests that checking travel documents takes between 1.5 and six minutes per passenger for all \nmodes of transport, while for each lorry between four and 16 minutes is needed to perform the document check and \na cargo inspection. Depending on the value chosen, the upper bound on the estimate can therefore be up to four \ntimes higher than the lower bound.\n\n Total costs\n\n Fixed costs of re-establishing outposts\n\n Border crossing points\n\n Cost of re-establishment\n\n Size\n\n Type\n\n Country\n\n Outposts\n\n Infrastructure\n\n Extent\n\n Operating and maintenance costs\n\n Internal Schengen borders\n\n Length\n\n Typology\n\n Density of crossing points\n\n Costs of protecting border\n\n Patrolling\n\n Administration\n\n Legal enforcement\n\n\n\n Bottom-up approach\n\n Border checks\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 64\n\n The internal borders within the Schengen Area, i.e. borders between two countries that are both parties to the \nSchengen Agreement, are open and unguarded. There are in principle no officers present even at border crossing \npoints (i.e. official locations of entry into another country), even though this may vary by country size/importance of \nthe particular crossing point. Either way, border-force officers do not carry out border checks regardless of \ntravellers\u2019 country of origin. Schengen states are required to remove all obstacles to the fluid movement of road \ntraffic, and while police and security checks may still be carried out, they must be on the basis of police information \nabout possible threats to public security or suspected cross-border crime, or only to verify a person\u2019s identity, \nrespectively (EU 2006). (Norway, Switzerland and Iceland are in the Schengen Area but not in the EU, and \ntherefore have customs controls in effect for all arriving travellers, regardless of point of origin.)\n\n In the event of reversing the Schengen Agreement, some/all internal borders would need to be patrolled again, \ndepending on the particular agreements among European countries, and a vast network of border posts would \nneed to be re-established around the continent to check identity and the travel entitlements of people wishing to \nmove from one country to another. Importantly, since most border posts along internal borders have been closed \n(and some completely removed), this would come at a significant cost to the countries concerned.\n\n By contrast, the external borders of the Schengen Area, i.e. borders between Schengen and non-Schengen \ncountries, are guarded and the participating countries are required to apply standardised strict checks on travellers \nentering and exiting the Schengen Area. The checking procedures are outlined in Regulation (EU) 2016/399; we \nuse these procedures as an average standard in our forward-looking analysis. That is to say, should border checks \nbe reinstated we assume that they would be procedurally similar to those currently taking place at external \nSchengen borders in terms of their scale and scope. In other words, all travellers would be subject to at least a \nminimum check of their identity and the expiry date and authenticity of their travel documents.97 Additionally, \nborder officers might investigate signs of document falsification or counterfeiting as well as consulting \n(inter)national databases to ensure that the traveller does not represent a threat to the country. Depending on \nwhether they were entering or exiting the country, third-country nationals might also need to show an appropriate \nvisa/residence permit if required, inform the officer of the purpose of their stay, point of departure and destination, \nand provide proof of sufficient funds to cover their stay. Given the variation in the procedures required, average \nprocessing times might differ substantially.\n\n Another way of differentiating between borders is according to their geographical location, where we distinguish \nbetween land borders (including natural sweet-water borders such as rivers or lakes), air borders, and sea \nborders. Only land borders can be considered\n\n 97 Border-check procedures governed by national law rather than Schengen-wide directives may be less strict in \ntheir requirements to check all travellers, resulting in the practice adopted by many European countries before \nborder controls were stopped whereby border agency officials allowed barrier-free transport for some individuals \nbased on their professional judgement.\n\n\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 65\n\n internal or external as air and maritime borders are open to any plane/ship in a virtual sense, regardless of their \ncountry of origin. Hence, air and maritime borders in all Schengen countries are continuously guarded98 and while \nthere are separate areas to process individuals travelling within the Schengen Area, these borders would not need \nto be substantially transformed if the Schengen Area was abolished.\n\n Finally, we may distinguish border crossing points on the basis of the volume of traffic passing through them. \nAccording to an EC report (EC 2016c), approximately seven per cent of the total 1,800 border crossing points in \nselected EU member states is defined as a \u2018large\u2019 border crossing: 40 sea border crossings, 27 air border \ncrossings, 40 land border crossings, and 20 railway connections linking Schengen countries. Moreover, 70 per cent \nof travellers are estimated to use these large border crossing points. In our study, we further distinguish \u2018medium\u2019 \nand \u2018small\u2019 land border crossing points. The three categories would roughly correspond to, for example, French\u2013\nBelgian border crossing points between Roubaix and Kortrijk (large), Bercu and Crinquet (medium), and at Oost-\nCappel (small).\n\n In order to estimate the overall costs of re-introducing borders within the Schengen Area, a list of border crossing \npoints in operation before Schengen was established (or potential outposts should it be abolished) would be \nneeded. To the best of our knowledge, there is no such official and complete list of historic and/or potential border \ncrossing points publicly available. We therefore used a European Parliament regulation99 to establish a list of \ninternal border crossing points for the Schengen countries. This document contains detailed lists of border \ncrossing points for all countries that joined the Schengen Area in 2007 or later (note that Liechtenstein is only \nreported as a part of Switzerland100) as well as the air and maritime border crossing points of all other Schengen \ncountries as reported by national officials. As of May 2016, there were an additional 45 updates to the original \ndocument from 2006, mostly relating to the addition/removal of air or maritime crossing points.\n\n Unfortunately, it seems that while some countries reported a full list of official routes, others arguably reported only \nthose above a certain level, neglecting local border traffic and tourist crossing points. What is more, neighbouring \ncountries sometimes provide different lists of crossing points; for instance the Czech Republic lists 100 crossing \npoints on its border with Poland, whereas Poland lists 109. To deal with these inconsistencies we apply the \nprinciple of prudence, taking the lower of the two numbers to obtain a lower bound for the overall cost estimate. In \naddition, in order to make a clear distinction in the analysis we assume that unless a subset of the listed border \ncrossing points is explicitly labelled as official local or tourist points (e.g. using a note next to the crossing\u2019s name), \nonly\n\n 98 For simplicity, we assume that all airports, airfields, and aerodromes listed in the official documentation (see \nbelow) as air borders are open to planes coming from within and outside the Schengen Area. Even though there \nmay be some small airports open to internal Schengen flights only \u2013 and thus not necessarily guarded \u2013 these \nwould not significantly affect the results of our analysis.\n\n 99 List of border crossing points referred to in Article 2(8) of the EP Regulation (EU, 2006).\n\n 100 Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Switzerland.\n\n\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 66\n\n \u2018standard\u2019 crossing points are reported. To reflect this in the analysis, all explicitly defined local border traffic \ncrossings and tourist crossing points are excluded from the calculations to establish consistency across \ncountries.101\n\n To test the appropriateness of our approach, we picked an example and manually analysed the Austrian border \n(see Appendix for details). Our findings shed additional light on the issue; in the European Parliament regulation, \nAustria lists 16, 19, 3 and 16 border crossing points with the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, and Switzerland \n(including Liechtenstein) respectively. Those numbers are much lower than our findings of 69, 33, 10 and 22. \nHowever, when we looked at Slovenia, the 21 regular border crossing points and 31 local border crossing points \nreported in the official document (EU, 2006) exactly match the 52 crossing points determined during our map \ninvestigation, suggesting that the other numbers of Austrian border crossing points (which do not explicitly mention \nlocal border traffic and tourist crossing points) exclude crossing points below a certain threshold, which is also the \napproach taken in our analysis.102\n\n In addition, we use the recent border closures by Austria and France and the related reports (Council of the EU \n2015f & 2015g) listing all newly introduced border controls to see how they match those listed in the 2006 \nEuropean Parliament documentation and to provide us with new information on, for example, border crossing \npoints between France and Belgium which was not available in the other documents. Arguably, the recently \nestablished border crossing points are the same as those that would be re-established should the Schengen \nAgreement be abolished. Indeed, recently opened borders (such as the one between Austria and Hungary) would \nlikely have more or less the same number of crossing points as before 2007, even though their distribution as \nregards to size is slightly different in the 2006 and 2015 documents, possibly due to various road extensions. \nHowever, looking closely at the data we can see that, for example, the French\u2013Belgian border has substantially \nfewer actual crossing points than one may have expected.103 It is possible that the French authorities deliberately \nreduced the number of crossing points in order to cut the costs of protecting the border and to integrate border \ncontrols into as few nodes as possible, but this may eventually be the case in all countries. Either way, the lower \nnumber of border\n\n 101 Local border traffic crossing points can only be used by residents of the border area and are generally in \nremote places not accessed by other travellers. Similarly, only minimal volume of traffic leads through tourist \ncrossing points. We therefore argue that such crossing points may not be guarded at all or would only require \nnegligible investment in comparison with total costs. In line with the principle of prudence, we leave them out of the \ncalculations, giving us a lower bound on the total costs estimated.\n\n 102 In addition, the recently published list of border crossing points re-established in reponse to the ongoing \nmigrant crisis (see below) distinguishes four levels of border crossing points. Although there are some \ndiscrepancies (arguably due to reconstruction of individual communications), only level 1\u20133 border crossing points \nseem to be included in the older documentation, again suggesting that the smallest border crossing points were \npreviously excluded.\n\n 103 Indeed, small roads cross the 620km-long border every few kilometres but there are only 18 officially \naccessible border crossing points listed in the documentation, i.e. 2.9 crossing point per 100 km \u2013 far lower than \n\n\n\nthe average 5.96 across all countries with known crossing points (excluding local border traffic and tourist-only \nborder crossing points).\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 67\n\n crossing points is in line with our principle of prudence and where double records exist (e.g. the French\u2013Swiss \nborder) we use the newest data only.\n\n The next step in our analysis employs statistical methods in order to estimate the number of land crossing points \nbetween countries that joined the Schengen Area prior to 2007 and for which we therefore do not have any official \ndata. Specifically, we created a dataset consisting of all known land border posts (countries that joined Schengen \nin 2007, plus Austria and France), border lengths, type of terrain (lowlands, highlands, mountains) and controls for \nnatural borders (particularly rivers which decrease the number of crossing points per 100 km), and determined \nwhat the number of crossing points between any two Schengen countries would be based on existing observations, \ngiven the length of their mutual border, its specifications, and the average number of crossing points per 100 km for \nsuch a type of border (see the Appendix for technical details).\n\n Finally, border post re-establishment costs depend on the extent of work to be done and whether there are \nsubstantial cross-country differences in the status of land border crossing points that need to be taken into account. \nA substantial randomized online search based on checking satellite pictures of border crossing locations showed \nthat there are essentially no longer any posts on borders between countries that joined the Schengen Area prior to \n2007. For instance, looking at the French\u2013Belgian border, not only there are no functioning posts, but there are not \neven buildings that would somewhat resemble them, either on large or small roads. By contrast, in other parts of \nSchengen, traces of former border infrastructure survive. The Haparanda\u2013Tornio border crossing (one of the few \nSwedish\u2013Finnish crossing points on the Torne River), for example, has an old customs building on the Finnish side \nbut no infrastructure for regular checks of individuals and vehicles. Similarly, looking at the Czech\u2013German, Polish\u2013\nSlovakian and Latvian\u2013Lithuanian borders we discovered that car gates and border-force officer booths have often \nbeen demolished, although some of the infrastructure \u2013 roads and buildings \u2013 remain.104 A European Commission \nreport (2010) supports our findings, stating that obstacles to fluid traffic flow (such as buildings, control booths, roofs \nover the road and mobile equipment) would be dismantled gradually following their country\u2019s entrance into the \nSchengen Area, but that the process might take a long time due to various property-rights constraints, plans for \nfuture refitting and so on, noting that countries which had joined the Schengen Area in 2007 or later have had \ndifficulties adjusting their borders accordingly.\n\n 3. Costs of (re-)establishing and running border crossing points\n\n Lack of reliable data presents a major difficulty in analysing both fixed and operating costs. Again, very few \ncountries in the Schengen Area have working land borders which might serve as a basis for calculations, there are \nno international statistics available on the subject, and national authorities rarely publish any data, resulting in very \nlittle information being available. Even where data exist, border agency budgets are not broken down into \nsufficiently detailed categories or locations and the staff responsible are unable to provide\n\n 104 For instance, looking at the Latvian\u2013Lithuanian border crossing point near Kurpalaukis and Grenct le, we can \nclearly see the whole outpost next to the highway.\n\n\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 68\n\n additional data. For instance, we obtained the projected 2016 Latvian border agency expenditure but were unable \nto distinguish between the costs of protecting the external land border with Belarus and Russia and the maritime \nborder, as the Latvian officers responsible informed us that they did not have the information themselves. In what \nfollows we discuss our approach in dealing with this lack of data.\n\n 3.1 Operating costs\n\n There is no reason to believe that processing and maintenance costs would substantially and systematically differ \nfrom one outpost to another within the same country. Border-force officers are state employees and as such are \nlikely paid a similar wage, possibly adjusted for local discrepancies in price levels; similarly, the cost of new \nequipment and servicing is more or less equal within individual countries. The opposite is true for inter-country \ncomparison where various other factors, particularly average salary, income tax rates and employment levels come \ninto play. This is reflected, for example, in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) \ncomparative price levels,105 a purchasing power parity (PPP) index which shows that to buy the same bundle of \ngoods, people in Switzerland, the most expensive country in the dataset, must pay 29 per cent more than in the UK \nand 142 per cent more than in Slovakia. Consequently, assuming that re-establishment and operating costs would \nbe equal in all countries, adjusting only for currency exchange rates, would lead either to understating costs in rich \ncountries, overstating costs in poorer countries, or both. We therefore use OECD comparative price levels to obtain \nnational cost estimates.\n\n Overall, only one (Finland) out of a potential 12 Schengen countries with external land borders provides a publicly \navailable detailed breakdown of border maintenance costs.106 These confirmed 2013 data show that Finland \nspent \u20ac103m on border controls alone, employing 1,119 officers and performing 17.8 million border checks across \nall external air, maritime and land borders. These numbers correspond to the official data on external border \ncrossing statistics,107 which depict an increase in external border traffic (and a decrease in internal border traffic) \nup to the same number of approximately 17.8 million external border crossings in 2013, out of which approximately \n10.6 million were passengers with visa requirements. In addition, 1,232 border force officers patrolled the external \nborders, costing \u20ac113m. The figure also includes staff salaries, capital expenditure, technical supervision and \nassistance services.108 Unfortunately, Finland is an exceptional\n\n 105 Available at            http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=CPL. The monthly comparison reflects \namount of money that must be spent in each country to purchase a comparable bundle of goods consumed \nregularly by households, such as products for everyday needs (food, clothing, cars, rents, personal services), \nproducts provided by the government, and payments to the government for licences and permits.\n\n 106 Available from the Finnish open data service website,            http://budjetti.vm.fi.\n\n 107 Available at            http://www.findikaattori.fi/en/105.\n\nhttp://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=CPL\nhttp://budjetti.vm.fi/\nhttp://www.findikaattori.fi/en/105\n\n\n 108 Inflation in Finland, as measured by the consumer price index, was 0.8 per cent during 2013\u20132016; applying \nthis to the estimates we obtain \u20ac105.5m and \u20ac115.7m for border check and patrolling costs respectively, as the \nactual 2016 price adjusted estimates used in our analysis.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 69\n\n example in several ways. In particular, the Finnish\u2013Russian border goes through mostly uninhabited territory with \na high degree of natural vegetation and a low number of permanent border crossing points. It would therefore be \ninappropriate to use the Finnish data as a basis for cost extrapolation to other countries, and in the following we \napply the Finnish data only to Sweden and Norway, which have borders very similar to the Finnish\u2013Russian one.\n\n To circumvent the issue, we further use data from Switzerland109 and Latvia.110 Both countries report overall \nexpenses related to border protection only, preventing a detailed analysis. Nevertheless, based on their description \nof respective border agency responsibilities they include essentially the same items (such as maintaining border \noutposts, controlling passengers, border surveillance, capital expenditure, patrolling costs and administrative and \nmaintenance costs), and can thus be compared and used as a basis for extrapolation to other countries using a \ncommon denominator.\n\n The EPRS report (EP 2016b), one of a very few comparable studies that endeavours to estimate the budgetary \ncosts of re-establishing borders, applied population size as the common denominator used to extrapolate country-\nlevel costs. We argue that this approach is subject to substantial limitations, particularly due to the weak link \nbetween population size and border length, typology, number of border crossing points and their size, which \nconstitute the main factors in determining the overall expense of maintaining land borders. Alternatively, the report \nby the Jacques Delors Institut (auf dem Brinke 2016) uses border length to extrapolate the estimated costs of \nprotecting the US\u2013Canadian border with the Schengen Area. However, this approach does not take into account \nthe fact that there are only 119 open land border crossing points (including Alaska) at the US\u2013Canadian border, \nmany of which are in sparsely populated areas completely different geographically from the European landscape. \nBy contrast, we estimate that the internal Schengen border, although only a little less than twice as long, would \nhave over 1,500 border crossing points, i.e. over 12 times more than the US\u2013Canadian border.\n\n A possible alternative common denominator is the volume of passenger crossing country borders, although \nneedless to say, abolition of border checks has significantly complicated monitoring border-crossing statistics, \nparticularly at land borders. Frontier countries such as Finland, Poland or Hungary have up-to-date statistics on \nexternal border crossings that are further reported to the European authorities, and the number of passengers \nusing rail, air and water transport can be deduced either from data provided by transport companies or from various \nother security checks required prior to boarding train/aircraft/vessel. However, the lack of any border controls at \nroads, combined with the popularity of car and coach transport, creates a substantial gap in the data. Moreover, \nEuropean countries did not have the obligation to publish any data on border crossings prior to joining the \nSchengen Area, resulting in extremely sparse historical data. Hence, we refrain from using passenger flows as the \ncommon denominator, although we use them \u2013 together with per-passenger cost estimates from the UK \u2013 to \nprovide cost estimates for Greece, Iceland, and Malta, which do not have any land borders with other Schengen \ncountries (see Appendix\n\n 109 Swiss Federal Finance Administration,            www.efv.admin.ch.\n\nhttp://www.efv.admin.ch/\n\n\n 110 Latvian State Border Guard,            www.rs.gov.lv.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 70\n\n for a description of the methodology). We also use a weighted average of both estimates (using land border \ncrossing points and passenger flows) to determine cost estimates for Denmark and Estonia. These counties are \nunique in having a high share of passengers travelling by maritime transport; the expenses stemming from \nadditional passenger checks would thus be significantly under-represented using only the main methodology based \non the number of land border crossing points.\n\n In what follows we take the approach that the number of border crossing points is the most appropriate common \ndenominator, and therefore use it in our cost modelling. Not only does this approach explicitly link costs to actual \nborder outposts and their size (and therefore indirectly to passenger flows) but also implicitly connects to border \nlength through our estimation of border post counts using border length and typology. In other words, a cost \nestimate per border crossing point contains information on salary and outpost maintenance expenses as well as \nborder surveillance, making it the most reliable basis for extrapolation.\n\n Using this approach the estimated costs of protecting land borders are \u20ac1,283,752 per border crossing in \nSwitzerland, \u20ac1,786,187 in Latvia, and \u20ac11,045,924 in Finland (PPP adjusted, see Table 2.1 and further details on \nthe calculation in the Appendix). As expected, the Finnish estimate is higher due to the lower density of crossing \npoints along the Finnish\u2013Russian border. We then combine the Swiss and Latvian estimates into an average \nestimate of \u20ac1,534,970 to be applied for all but the Scandinavian countries. To account for a possibly large margin \nof error due to inter-country heterogeneity, we complement the estimates by sensitivity analysis in range of \u00b125 per \ncent around the point estimate. The resulting estimates are shown in Table 2.1.\n\n Table 2.1: Operating costs estimates\n\n Base country\n\n Cost per border crossing point\n\n To be applied in\n\n Finland\n\n \u20ac11,045,924\n\n Scandinavia\n\n Switzerland and Latvia\n\n \u20ac1,534,970\n\n Other Schengen countries\n\nhttp://www.rs.gov.lv/\n\n\n 3.2 Fixed costs of border re-establishment\n\n As described earlier, we assume that only land borders would require substantial capital investment, as these \nwould need to be refurbished or completely rebuilt, unlike air and maritime borders, which are already operating \nand would mainly require additional staff and equipment. According to responses in a note from the Council of the \nEU (2009b), the average passenger processing time at the external Schengen border was 0.5\u20132.5 minutes for \npassengers without visa requirements and 1\u20135 minutes for passengers with visa requirements, with Italy and \nNorway having the fastest and slowest controls, respectively (with slight variation between entry and exit checks).\n\n Unlike road transport, air and maritime transport is well documented in the official statistics. Eurostat111 data show \nthat 216.9 million passengers travelled by air and 49.8\n\n 111            http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 71\n\n million by sea between Schengen countries in 2014.

Using detailed calculations based on \nthe number of existing air and maritime border crossing points and national statistics on passenger traffic, 12\u201335 \nadditional officers would need to be present at major airports and 4\u201310 at\n\n\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 72\n\n major ports to process passengers travelling within the former Schengen Area.112 Finally, following the European \nCommission report (EC 2016c), we assume that other \u2018small\u2019 crossing points would require two officers at any time.\n\n For simplicity, and in line with the EC report, we assume that each officer requires a personal computer, passport \nscanner, fingerprint reader and equipment for taking facial images. An overview of the assumed costs is shown in \nTable AB.4 in the Appendix. Given all the facts, we assume fixed costs at large air and maritime borders, excluding \nany reconstruction of Schengen Area lanes, project management, additional IT infrastructure, officer training and \npeak-time backups to be in range of \u20ac92,000\u2013294,000 and \u20ac53,900\u2013154,000 for airports and ports, respectively. \nBecause the resulting costs are negligible in the summary, we use these estimates to show the magnitude of any \nsuch changes rather than to provide an exhaustive list of all possible related expenses.\n\n In addition to the updating costs of land and maritime borders we attempt to estimate the costs of re-establishing \nland borders. Following on from the discussion in the previous section, we assume that all land borders opened as \na result of the 2007 and later Schengen enlargements later would not need to have their border posts completely \nrebuilt but rather refurbished and re-equipped. Since it is difficult to estimate the extent of such reconstruction, we \nassume that the costs of refurbishment would be 40\u201360 per cent lower than the cost of building a new outpost of \nthe same size.\n\n Given the lack of any appropriate European data, we use available information on the costs of similar US projects \ninstead. In particular, we collected data on three US\u2013Mexico land border crossing points in Calexico, CA, \nColumbus, NM, and Laredo, TX. Although two of these (Calexico and Laredo) are mainly reconfiguration and \nexpansion projects, budgets range from $68m to $370m, i.e. in line with unofficial statistics from Europe.113 Using \nmore conservative figures, we believe that costs would be in range of \u20ac80\u2013200m per large border crossing.\n\n 112 Specifically, there are 810 ports and 617 airports in the reporting countries (Liechtenstein does not have any \nairports), out of which we assume that 15 per cent are major crossing points (based on the distribution of regular \nairports and aerodromes in our dataset) processing 70 per cent of all passengers as per the European Commission \n(2016c) report quoted earlier, giving us an average of 3,152,631/8,637 passengers to be processed each year/day \nat major airports and 1,351,227/3,475 at all major ports. Note that there is large variance in the data across \nindividual crossing points and countries. As a sanity check, we consider the Czech Republic with 18 listed airports, \ni.e. approx. 3 major airports according to our assumptions. The largest airport, V\u00e1clav Havel Airport in Prague, \nclears more than 11 million passengers for departure each year, while the second largest airport, in Brno, clears \nless than 500 thousand passengers per year, with both figures including flights to all destinations. Overall, the \nnumbers are therefore in line with our results.\n\n 113 The German\u2013Czech border crossing at Waidhaus\u2013Rozvadov cost over CZK 1.1bn in 1997, i.e. approx. US \n$35m in 1997 prices and US $52.9m in 2016 prices. Data taken from iHned.cz (1997).\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 73\n\n\n\n To approximate the costs required to build a medium-size outpost, we use public tender on the construction of \nborder crossing point in Bijaca, Bosnia and Herzegovina (EC 2014), valued at \u20ac4.932m, and a report published by \nthe Estonian Ministry of the Interior on the reconstruction of the Ivangorod\u2013Narva border crossing points on the \nEstonian-Russian border (EstLatRus, n.d.), costing \u20ac8.221m. Accounting for lower purchasing parity levels in these \ncountries, we therefore assume a medium-size outpost to cost on average between \u20ac5m and \u20ac10m to build.\n\n Finally, small outposts are the most difficult to measure due to their heterogeneity and lack of data. To partially \nreduce the heterogeneity, we exclude local traffic and tourist crossing points from our analysis, providing a \nconservative estimate of the total costs. Based on the medium-size estimate and our expert opinion, we consider \nthe costs to build a small border outpost to be between \u20ac100,000 and \u20ac400,000, which is likely to be far below the \nactual figures and therefore in line with our principle of prudence. The summary of fixed costs related to land \nborders can be found in Table 2.3.\n\n Table 2.3: Re-establishment costs of land border crossing points Size of border crossing point Estimated unit cost \nLarge \u20ac80\u2013200m Medium \u20ac5\u201310m Small \u20ac100,000\u2013400,000 %reduction for post-2007 Schengen countries 40\u2013\n80%\n\n 4. Estimating the budgetary costs of non-Schengen\n\n Having prepared all the underlying data, we now determine possible scenarios of development. For simplicity, we \nassume three scenarios:114\n\n 1. a two-year suspension of the Schengen Area in the five countries that have recently re-introduced border \ncontrols (Austria, Denmark, Germany, Norway and Sweden) and only at places where they have been re-\nintroduced;\n\n 2. a two-year suspension of the Schengen Area and re-introduction of border controls in all Schengen countries at \nall internal borders;\n\n 3. indefinite suspension of the Schengen Agreement in all countries.\n\n For Scenarios 1 and 2 we provide cost estimates for the two years of temporary border re-introduction. For \nScenario 3 we provide an annual cost estimate and the total estimated costs for the first ten years after border re-\nintroduction.\n\n Note that the calculations refer only to additional costs related to the new borders and do not represent the total \nexpenditure on border controls (particularly the cost of protecting maritime and air borders). For example, the \nestimates for Germany only reflect additional\n\n 114 Due to linearity and the independence property of our cost modelling, costs associated with any subset of \ncountries/borders is directly proportional to their share of border crossing points out of the total. Similarly, \noperating costs are assumed to be constant across years and annual costs can thus be multiplied to obtain \nestimates for multiple years.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n\n\n PE 581.387 74\n\n costs of re-establishing land borders and processing additional passengers at airports and ports but do not include \nexisting costs of maintaining air and sea borders that occur regardless of the Schengen Agreement. Furthermore, \nwe do not consider additional visa processing costs in Scenario 3 as a result of third-country nationals having to \napply for multiple visas when visiting more than one Schengen country rather than just a single Schengen visa, as \nin the current arrangement. This is due to high degree of uncertainty in terms of passenger flows should the \nSchengen Area be abolished and lack of reliable data on visa-processing expenses. Again, our estimates are thus \nconservative and the actual figures may be higher.\n\n There are also several caveats to be mentioned. Firstly, we assume that the border crossing points identified in \nthe European Parliament regulation115 would all be re-established. However, it is possible that actual numbers \nmay be either lower and higher given that some cross-border roads may be closed or given local border traffic \nstatus rather than guarded, reducing the potential total costs, or on the contrary some newly built roads not \nrecorded in the 2006 documentation may serve as new crossing points. We try to minimise such occasions by \nexcluding former local border traffic and tourist crossing points from our analysis.\n\n Secondly, using a single cost estimate for such a wide variety of countries inherently introduces error in the \nanalysis. Consider, for example, patrolling costs in the light of the current migration crisis in Europe. Arguably, \ncountries on the main migrant route such as Austria and Germany are likely to aim for a higher degree of internal \nSchengen border surveillance than for example Poland or Estonia, thus possibly overstating patrolling costs for the \nlatter two countries and understating them for the former. We try to reduce this error by using both Swiss/Latvian \nand Finnish estimate to account for differences in geography across Europe and by introducing a range around the \npoint estimate to give a better idea of the potential costs. Finally, the analysis does not take into account possible \nbilateral agreements allowing barrier-free movement of people such as the former Nordic Passport Union; these \nwould partially open borders again and thus lower potential costs.\n\n The main parameters used in the calculation are summarised in Table 2.4. All figures are in 2016 prices, i.e. using \npresent value of money.\n\n Table 2.4: Parameters used in the cost estimation\n\n Parameter Lower bound Upper bound Source Border outpost re-establishment \u2013 large \u20ac80m \u20ac200m Calexico, CA, \nColumbus, NM, and Laredo, TX (all USA) Border outpost re-establishment \u2013 medium \u20ac5m \u20ac10m Ivangorod\u2013Narva, \nEstonia; Bijaca, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\n 115 List of border crossing points referred to in Article 2(8) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European \nParliament and of the Council of the EU of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing \nthe movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code).\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 75\n\n Border outpost re-establishment \u2013 small \u20ac100,000 \u20ac400,000 Expert opinion Reduction in re-establishment costs \nfor new Schengen countries 40% 80% Expert opinion Operating costs per border crossing point \u2013 Europe \n1,559,657 Latvian State Border Guard, Swiss Federal Finance Administration Operating costs per border crossing \n\n\n\npoint \u2013 Scandinavia 11,045,924 Finnish open data service Passenger processing time (without visa) 0.5 minutes \n2.5 minutes Council of the European Union note116 Passenger processing time (visa requirement) 1 minute 5 \nminutes Additional officers per large border \u2013 air borders 12 35 Authors\u2019 calculations Additional officers per large \nborder - maritime borders 4 10 Additional officers per small border 2 2 European Commission (2016b)\n\n 4.1 Scenario 1: two-year border introduction in five countries at specific locations\n\n The two-year suspension corresponds to the legal time limit for reinstating temporary border controls in the \ncontext of the current Schengen Agreement as per Article 29 of the SBC. The five countries with effective internal \nborder controls as of June 2016 are:117\n\n \u2022 Austria: at the Austrian\u2013Hungarian land border and Austrian\u2013Slovenian land border;\n\n \u2022 Denmark: in the Danish ports with ferry connections to Germany and at the Danish\u2013German land border;\n\n \u2022 Germany: at the German\u2013Austrian land border;\n\n \u2022 Norway: in the Norwegian ports with ferry connections to Denmark, Germany and Sweden;\n\n \u2022 Sweden: in the Swedish harbours in the Police Region South and West and at the \u00d6resund bridge.\n\n Unfortunately, there are currently no data available on the actual costs of the recently re-introduced border \ncontrols. Should country officials believe that any border controls are only temporary, it is unlikely that land border \noutposts would be reinstalled in full.118 Moreover, contrary to Scenario 2 we assume that personal and other \nequipment as well as human resources would be relocated within countries and that either no or insignificant\n\n 117 European Council press release available at            http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-\nreleases/2016/05/12-internal-border-controls/.\n\n 118 This assumption is in line with testimonies offered by interviewed officials.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 76\n\n funds would be spent on new equipment and hiring additional staff. This assumption is in line with information \nobtained during our interviews and based on the fact that controls were re-introduced at only a small proportion of \nland borders in Austria, Denmark and Germany, and in ports that had such equipment prior to re-introduction of the \nadditional controls to check passengers coming from outside the Schengen Area.\n\n The bottom line is that there would be little to no additional fixed and operating costs as a result of relocating \nresources within countries. However, to give an indication of maximum potential costs should all equipment be \npurchased and new staff hired, we use the same methodology as in Scenarios 2 and 3 with a proportionally \nreduced number of assumed operating border crossing points. In particular, we assume that all types of border \n\nhttp://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/05/12-internal-border-controls/\nhttp://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/05/12-internal-border-controls/\n\n\ncrossing point would require the same additional equipment (personal computers, passport readers, face-\nrecognition machines and fingerprint scanners) but that land border crossing points would also need equipment for \nnewly hired border-force officers (particularly fully equipped cars), backed up by sufficient infrastructure. Without \nany data available, we suggest as a conservative estimate that an additional \u20ac20,000\u201340,000 would need to be \nspent per land border crossing point on average for all equipment. For air and maritime borders, we follow the \nmethodology introduced in the previous section.\n\n Using these estimates, the upper bound on costs of border protection over the two years at the selected borders, \nincluding one-off fixed costs, would be \u20ac211.5m. The assumed costs of border protection in addition to what would \notherwise be spent on human and capital resources that are likely to be relocated within countries would be in \nrange of \u20ac0\u2013211.5m.119\n\n 4.2 Scenario 2: two-year border introduction in all Schengen countries\n\n As in Scenario 1, it is unlikely that a temporary re-introduction of border controls, although this time on a larger \nscale, would prompt countries to hire a substantial number of new border-force officers or even rebuild permanent \nborder crossing points. Notwithstanding that, additional equipment would have to be purchased to reflect the \nincrease in the number of passengers to be checked. We assume that these costs would be the same as in \nScenario 1, i.e. \u20ac20,000\u201340,000 per land border crossing point and as per the detailed breakdown shown in Table \n2.4 for air and maritime border crossing points.\n\n Note that the purpose of calculating fixed costs in this scenario is essentially to show the vast difference between \nthese and both the operating costs and fixed costs in Scenario 3.\n\n Starting with operating costs, our total estimate is \u20ac2.19\u20133.65bn to be spent annually in all Schengen countries. \nUnsurprisingly, the highest costs would be on the German side, whereas Greece, Iceland, Malta and the Eastern \nEuropean countries would be least affected. Greece, Malta and Iceland do not have any land borders with other \nSchengen countries and the added costs would only be related to additional checks on air and maritime transport \npassengers.

Indeed, without alternative regional arrangements in place such as a free-\ntraffic zone between\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 78\n\n Sweden and Norway (which are not considered in this scenario), countries would need to fully re-establish all land \nborder crossing points rather than temporarily substitute the posts with mobile border force units. As discussed in \nthe methodology section we between distinguish large, medium, and small outposts and their related building costs, \nwith reduced costs for countries that joined Schengen Area in 2007 and later, as these countries would need only to \nrefurbish existing, albeit no longer used, checkpoints.\n\n Based on these assumptions, the total annual costs in Scenario 3 would again be in the range of \u20ac2.19\u20133.65bn, \nwith an additional \u20ac7.41\u201319.76bn to be spent on the re-establishment of land borders. The total budgetary costs \nover a ten-year period would thus be \u20ac29.31.1\u201356.26bn for all countries in the Schengen Area.\n\n\n\n Finally, in line with the recent European Parliamentary Research Service report (EP 2016b) we also present \nestimated costs only for the five countries that have recently re-introduced border controls. Assuming these \ncountries would leave the Schengen Area indefinitely, they would face \u20ac3.17\u20137.70bn in one-off fixed costs and \n\u20ac0.92\u20131.54bn in annual operating costs.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 79\n\n Table 2.6: Scenario 3 \u2013 estimated costs Country Land border length Fixed costs Operating costs Lower bound \nUpper bound Point estimate Lower bound Upper bound Austria 2,562 868.4 2,102.6 199.6 149.7 249.5 Belgium \n1,385 408.3 986.3 93.6 70.2 117.0\n\n Czech Republicd 1,881 94.6 684.7 182.5 136.9 228.1 Denmarkc 68 110.0 270.1 77.7 58.3 97.1\n\n Estoniad 339 13.9 96.3 46.5 34.9 58.1 Finland 1,350 107.8 261.0 121.5 91.1 151.9 France 2,828 883.5 2,136.1 \n201.2 150.9 251.5 Germany 3,621 1,556.5 3,766.5 369.6 277.2 462.0 Greecea - 1.7 2.8 23.2 17.4 29.0\n\n Hungaryd 1,145 40.5 292.6 81.1 60.8 101.4\n\n Icelanda - 0.6 1.0 2.0 1.5 2.5 Italy 1,890 552.6 1,337.4 127.9 95.9 159.9\n\n Latviad 1,323 202.9 491.3 67.1 50.3 83.8 Liechtenstein 76 257.5 633.3 9.4 7.0 11.7\n\n Lithuaniad 544 39.2 285.6 54.6 40.9 68.2\n\n Maltaa - 0.1 0.1 4.8 3.6 6.0 Luxembourg 359 116.9 280.7 31.2 23.4 39.0 Netherlands 1,027 399.3 966.3 90.5 67.8 \n113.1 Norway 2,355 237.7 576.9 265.1 198.8 331.4\n\n Polandd 1,649 66.7 481.0 145.0 108.8 181.3 Portugal 1,214 367.7 891.9 104.5 78.4 130.6\n\n Slovakiad 1,427 60.5 439.0 107.6 80.7 134.5\n\n Sloveniad 664 57.5 418.1 82.7 62.0 103.3 Spain 1,837 568.7 1,377.3 151.3 113.5 189.1 Sweden 2,233 401.1 \n983.9 276.1 207.1 345.2\n\n Switzerlandb 1,880 - - - - -\n\n Total 33,657 7,414.5 19,762.9 2,916.2 2,187.2 3,645.3\n\n Note: in \u20ac millions per year, 2016 prices, PPP adjusted a Operating costs calculated using passenger flows \nmethodology (see Appendix for details). b No additional costs assumed as border controls and surveillance are \nfunctioning at the moment. c Operating costs calculated from estimates obtained using the two methodologies. d \nCountries with existing border outposts in need of refurbishment.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 80\n\n\n\n Finally, Table 2.7 contains an overview of annual costs and fixed costs in all three scenarios.

Overall, analysing crime trends and their determinants is a \ncomplex endeavour and no consensus has been reached in the academic literature on the factors driving the \naforementioned trends. Some argue that increased alcohol consumption, especially among youth, may have led to \nhigher rates of violent crime over the last decades (Aebi & Linde 2010), whereas Tonry (2014), for instance, argues \nthat the rise in reported non-lethal violent crimes such as assaults, sex and family-violence has been observed \nbecause of a shift in the cultural threshold of tolerance in reporting such crimes, suggesting that this increasing \ntrend might be driven by changes in reporting patterns rather than by the underlying frequency with which these \ntypes of crime are committed.\n\n Furthermore, some have argued that demographic change leads to decreasing youth cohorts, which may \nsubsequently have led to lower crime rates (Baumer 2008). The explanation behind this (well documented in the \nliterature) is that youth, especially young men, are over-represented as perpetrators of crime compared to any other \ndemographic group. Another set of research focuses on the influence of economic variables in explaining trends in \ncrime. Emphasising property crimes, some argue that national differences in economic factors such as inflation, \nunemployment and economic growth are relevant determinants of crime (Buonanno et al. 2014).\n\n In this regard, in many European member states, especially those that joined the EU from 2004 onwards, the \nsocio-economic situation has improved over the last decade, with increasing standards of living, output and \nemployment leading to lower rates of property\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 81\n\n crime. In addition, Aebi and Linde (2010) argue that the reinforcement of police measures at external EU borders \nin the light of Schengen has played a major role in reducing crime by making it more difficult for criminals to \ntransport illegal goods.\n\n In summary, the analysis of crime is complex and many theories exist in the literature as to why certain crime \ntrends observed over the last decades have occurred, but no conclusive explanation has emerged. Building on \nwork by Ademmer et al. (2015), which analyses regional crime trends between existing and newly acceding \nSchengen states in light of the 2007 Schengen enlargement, the analysis that follows does not aim to provide an \nexplanation of the causal effects of the crime trends described above but to provide an illustrative overview on how \ntrends in certain types of crime evolved before and after the 2007 Schengen enlargement for different groups of \ncountries and regions.\n\n\n\n 1. Acquisitive and violent crime\n\n In order to assess the associations between abolishing border controls and crime rates, we investigate in more \ndetail the 2007 Schengen enlargement during which all new member states except Cyprus entered the Schengen \nArea. In particular, we focus in more detail on the existing Schengen states and the newly acceding Schengen \nstates (Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania).\n\n In essence, the purpose of this analysis is to investigate whether we can observe different trends in crime rates for \nexisting Schengen states before and after the 2007 enlargement, with a particular attempt to test the hypothesis \nthat those states with direct borders to the newly acceding Schengen states (Germany, Italy, Austria, Sweden and \nFinland)120 were affected by substantial changes in crime rates. We also examine whether there has been a \nchange in crime rates in the new Schengen states compared to non-Schengen states in the same region. Note that \nthe 2007 Schengen enlargement happened de facto in December 2007. Hence, in what follows, we look at time \ntrends before and after 2008, the year in which we would expect changes in crime statistics if the opening of \nborders is related to crime trends.\n\n Unfortunately, no comprehensive quantitative data on cross-border crimes exist. To counter this deficiency, we \nuse three different data sources, (1) UNODC crime statistics (2003\u20132014), (2) European Social Survey (2002\u2013\n2014), and (3) Eurostat regional crime data (2008\u20132010) and investigate how crime rates evolve in the existing \nwestern Schengen states and in the new Schengen states and their neighbouring non-Schengen states.\n\n When analysing crime trends across countries several well-known issues have to be considered. Firstly, police-\nreported crimes may underestimate the true number of committed crimes. For instance, there is good reason to \nassume that people may not report\n\n 120 Note that Sweden and Finland do not have substantial direct land borders to new Schengen states from the \n2007 Schengen enlargment. Nevertheless, Finland has close maritime borders and active ferry traffic with Estonia, \nand Sweden has close maritime borders with the Baltic states and Poland.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 82\n\n minor crimes to the police because they feel ashamed of being a victim, because the monetary value lost is too \nlittle to make the effort of reporting the crime worthwhile (Buonanno et al. 2014) or because the person has a lack of \ntrust in the ability of the police to find a criminal. Nevertheless, criminological literature (e.g. Aebi & Linde 2010) \nsuggests that reported crime data is appropriate when studying the evolution and trends in crime across countries \nunder the assumption that recording procedures do not change substantially over time. Secondly, when using \nreported crimes for cross-country analysis, one has to be cautious due to the heterogeneity of reporting rates \nacross time and countries. For instance, reporting rates differ across countries and hence it has been suggested \nthat it is also useful to compare reported crimes with crime victimisation survey data (Van Dijk, Van Kesteren, & \nSmith, 2007). Thirdly, another problem when analysing crime statistics is that the classification of crimes may differ \nacross countries.\n\n 1.1 Cross-country trends in acquisitive crime and homicide rates (2003-2013)\n\n\n\n In order to tackle the aforementioned issues in analysing cross-country and cross-regional trends in crime rates we \nfollow Buonanno et al. (2014) and look separately at homicide rates and an aggregate measure of several other \ncrimes called \u2018acquisitive crime\u2019 (including burglary, theft, car theft and robbery) to circumvent to some extent \ndifferent crime classifications between countries. In addition, we not only look at police-reported crimes but also use \ncrime victimisation survey data from the ESS. Lastly, we use the natural logarithm of crime rates and apply \ncountry/region and time-fixed effects to alleviate the potential under-reporting issue and to negate the influence of \nmeasurement error that is constant over time or space.\n\n Figure 2.2 depicts trends in acquisitive crime and homicide rates for Western Schengen states before and after the \n2007 Schengen enlargement. Note that the time series are adjusted for country-specific and time-specific \neffects.121 Interestingly, although for acquisitive crimes we observe a downward trend after 2008, the decreasing \ntrend is somewhat stronger in states with direct borders to the new Schengen members after 2007. Looking at \nhomicide rates, we cannot observe a clear upward or downward trend for Western Schengen states either with or \nwithout direct borders to the Eastern Schengen states that entered the area in 2007. While there is some slight \nincrease in homicide rates in Western states without direct borders from 2008 to 2010, the trend falls afterwards.\n\n 121 E.g. depicted are the residuals from a linear regression model using OLS employing the crime rate as outcome \nvariable and controlling for country and year fixed effects.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 83\n\n Figure 2.2: Trends in acquisitive crime and homicide rates in existing Schengen states before and after 2007 \nSchengen enlargement\n\n Notes: based on UNODC crime statistics. Entries depict the residual crime rates for different groups of countries \nover time after taking into account country- and time-specific effects based on a linear regression.\n\n Furthermore, figure 2.3 depicts trends in acquisitive crime and homicide rates for the newly acceding Schengen \nstates entering the area in 2007 compared to non-Schengen countries in the same region (Bulgaria, Romania, \nCroatia, Moldova and Ukraine). The rate of acquisitive crimes falls in the period before 2007 for the newly acceding \nSchengen states and continues with a downward trend thereafter. The figures even reveal a slightly more \ndownward sloping trend after 2007. The same applies to homicide rates, although the rate fluctuates relatively \nstrongly in the post-2007 period, and a clear trend cannot be determined.\n\n While the time-series in figures 2.2 and 2.3 are adjusted for time-invariant country effects and general time-effects, \nother time-varying variables such as a country\u2019s GDP per capita as a measure of wealth might also influence overall \ndifferences in crime rates across countries. In order to test whether the different trends across groups of countries \ndepicted in figures 2.2 and 2.3 are robust to the inclusion of further control variables and are indeed statistically \nsignificant, we estimate the following linear regression model using OLS:\n\n \u00f0 \u2018 \u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u2019\u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1=\u00f0 \u203a0+\u00f0 \u203a1\u00f0 \u2018\u017d\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1\u00f0 \u2018\u2019\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1+\u00f0 \u203a2\u00f0 \u2018\u201d\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u0153\u00f0 \u2018\u00a2\u00f0 \u2018 \u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1+ \u00f0 \u203a3(\u00f0 \u2018\u017d\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1\u00f0 \u2018\u2019\u00f0 \u2018&lowast;\u00f0 \u2018\u201d\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \n\u2018\u0153\u00f0 \u2018\u00a2\u00f0 \u2018 )\u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1+\u00f0 \u203a4\u00f0  \u00b6\u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1+\u00f0 \u0153\u00f0 \u2018 +\u03b3\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1+\u00f0 \u0153\u20ac\u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1 (1) -.1\n\n -.05\n\n 0\n\n\n\n .05\n\n .1\n\n 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013\n\n year\n\n border states non-border states\n\n acquisitive crime rate\n\n -.3 -.2 -.1\n\n 0\n\n .1 .2\n\n ln homicide rate (residual)\n\n 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013\n\n year\n\n border states non-border states\n\n homicide rate\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 84\n\n Where \u00f0 \u2018 \u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u2019\u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1 in equation (1) represents the natural logarithm of the number of police reported crimes \nper 100,000 inhabitants (burglaries, vehicle theft, theft and robbery) and the number of homicides per 100,000 \ninhabitants in country i in year t.

It is noted in the criminological \nliterature that controlling for the age structure is very important as young males are statistically more likely to be \ncriminal offenders than any other demographic group (Levitt & Lochner 2001). In addition, different levels of \nunemployment may determine levels of crime. Economic theory would predict that, all else being equal, an increase \nin unemployment may induce rises in crime levels as the opportunity costs (e.g. earning a market wage) decrease. \nNote that \u00f0 \u0153\u00f0 \u2018  represents country-fixed effects, and \u03b3\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1 (group-specific) time effects.\n\n Figure 2.3: trends in acquisitive crime and homicide rates in newly acceding Schengen and non-Schengen states \nbefore and after 2007 Schengen enlargement\n\n\n\n 122 In each round, the ESS asks people whether a member of the household has been a victim of robbery or \nburglary within the last five years. -.2 -.1\n\n 0\n\n .1 .2\n\n 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013\n\n year\n\n Schengen states non-Schengen states\n\n acquisitive crime rate\n\n -.4 -.2\n\n 0\n\n .2\n\n ln homicide rate (residual)\n\n 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013\n\n year\n\n Schengen states non-Schengen states\n\n homicide rate\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 85\n\n Notes: based on UNODC crime statistics.

In the first sample, the indicator variable \u00f0 \u2018\u201d\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u0153\u00f0 \u2018\u00a2\u00f0 \u2018 \u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1 takes the value 1 if a country has a direct \nborder to the newly acceding Schengen states (namely Austria, Germany, Italy, Finland or Sweden) and 0 for all \nother existing Schengen states without direct borders. For the second sample, the indicator variable takes the \nvalue 1 for all the newly acceding Schengen states (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia and Poland) and \n0 for all non-Schengen states. The parameter estimate \u00f0 \u203a2 reports whether there are any initial differences in the \nlevel of crime rates between the two groups of countries. \u00f0 \u2018\u017d\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1\u00f0 \u2018\u2019\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1 takes the value 1 after 2008 and \n\n\n\nrepresents the period after the new Schengen states entered the area.

In existing Schengen states, outlined in table 2.10, crime rates are generally falling but as the data suggest, this \nfall is even more pronounced in states with direct (internal) borders to countries that joined Schengen in 2007. This \napplies for police-reported crime as well as self-reported crime victimisation rates. In addition, individuals are more \nlikely to report that they feel secure in their neighbourhood at night in states with direct borders.\n\n Table 2.11 reveals that the newly acceding states the Schengen area in 2007 report lower rates of crime for both \nacquisitive crimes and homicides. This also applies when examining self-reported crimes (column 3). In addition, \nindividuals in Schengen states feel relatively more secure after the abolishment of border controls (column 4).\n\n Table 2.8: Summary table trends in crime rates in existing Schengen states before and after 2007\n\n (1)\n\n (2)\n\n (3)\n\n (4)\n\n Existing Schengen states\n\n police- reported acquisitive crime\n\n police- reported homicide\n\n self-reported acquisitive crime\n\n self-reported feeling secure\n\n Data source:\n\n UNODC\n\n ESS\n\n (1) No direct border\n\n \u20137.87%\n\n \u201313.86%\n\n\n\n \u20131.10%\n\n 0.12%\n\n 123 Note that the overall average change in crime rates for countries included in \u00f0 \u2018\u201d\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u0153\u00f0 \u2018\u00a2\u00f0 \u2018 \u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1 is \ncalculated as the sum of \u00f0 \u203a1 and \u00f0 \u203a3, whereas \u00f0 \u203a3 represents the change for countries in the group net of a \ncommon time trend similar for both groups of countries.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 86\n\n \u0394 before 2008 - after 2008\n\n (2) Direct border\n\n \u201328.03%\n\n \u201310.17%\n\n \u20135.83%\n\n 4.40%\n\n (2)-(1)\n\n \u201320.16%\n\n 3.69%\n\n \u20134.73%\n\n 4.28%\n\n Notes: based on parameter estimates reported in table AC.1 in Appendix C.\n\n The crime trends presented above tell a compelling story, countering the hypothesis that abolishing (internal) \nborder controls in the light of Schengen leads to increased crime and insecurity. If at all, we observe downward \ntrends in acquisitive crime rates. It is important to note that the parameter estimates presented in the tables above \nrepresent associations and not causal effects. Although we aim to control for as many potential confounding factors \nas possible, unobserved factors that may affect crimes rates after 2008 may still be correlated with any of the \nparameters of interest, hence leading to a biased estimates. What is more, the types of crimes investigated in this \nsection do not paint the full picture on how the abolishment of border controls may affect levels of crime as other \ntypes of crime such as drug or human trafficking activities are also impacted by changes in the extent of border \ncontrols. Hence, in section 2 below we investigate the associations between Schengen and drug trafficking in more \ndetail.\n\n\n\n While the presented findings for acquisitive and homicide rates emphasise the between-country aspect of crime \nand Schengen, it is also important to investigate whether border regions within countries evolve differently over \ntime in terms of their crime rates compared to non-border regions.\n\n Table 2.9: Summary table trends in crime rates in newly acceding Schengen and non-Schengen states before and \nafter 2007\n\n (1)\n\n (2)\n\n (3)\n\n (4)\n\n Newly acceding Schengen states\n\n police-reported acquisitive crime\n\n police-reported homicide\n\n self-reported acquisitive crime\n\n self-reported feeling secure\n\n Data source:\n\n UNODC\n\n ESS\n\n \u0394 before 2008 - after 2008\n\n (1) No direct border\n\n \u201315.69%\n\n \u201319.29%\n\n \u20136.48%\n\n \u201318.32%\n\n (2) Direct border\n\n \u201329.74%\n\n \u201343.20%\n\n\n\n \u201327.21%\n\n 24.62%\n\n (2)\u2013(1)\n\n \u201314.05%\n\n \u201323.91%\n\n \u201320.73%\n\n 42.94%\n\n Notes: based on parameter estimates reported in table AC.2 in Appendix C.\n\n 1.2 Cross-regional trends in acquisitive crime and homicide rates: border versus non-border regions\n\n The previous section investigated cross-country crime trends between different groups of Schengen and non-\nSchengen states before and after the 2007 Schengen enlargement. As mentioned above, it has been argued by \nsome that the abolishment of border controls in light of Schengen may have improved economic output but at the \ncost of higher crime and\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 87\n\n insecurity (Vasilopoulou 2013). If this hypothesis holds, one could expect that such effects on crime might be more \npronounced in border regions than in non-border regions due to their closer proximity to regions in countries with \nlower levels of economic prosperity. Hence, we would expect that regions with direct borders to the Eastern \nSchengen states might be affected disproportionally. At the same time, one could argue that border regions may \nnot be the most economically advanced regions due to their peripheral character and hence criminal activities may \nfocus more in less peripheral and more urban centres further away from borders.\n\n In this section, and similarly to Ademmer et al. (2015), we investigate how trends in crime rates evolve within \ncountries by comparing border to non-border regions. To that end we run similar regression models as illustrated \nin equation (1) but using regional police reported crime level data (burglary, robbery and car theft) for NUTS 3 \n(Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) regions provided by Eurostat (n.d.) as our outcome variable of \ninterest. Unfortunately these data are only publicly available for the years 2008, 2009 and 2010. Hence, we can \nonly compare whether trends in crime rates evolve differently for border versus non-border NUTS 3 regions after \nthe 2007 enlargement from 2008 for three years onwards. For the purposes of this analysis we look at NUTS 3 \nregions of countries with direct land borders to the Eastern Schengen states, namely Austria, Germany and Italy, \nas well as NUTS 3 regions in southern Sweden and Finland with maritime links to the Baltic States.\n\n Figure 2.4 depicts trends for NUTS 3 regions in existing Schengen states with borders that were abolished as a \nresult of the Schengen Area enlargement in 2007 compared to NUTS 3 regions without such borders within the \n\n\n\nsame country.124 Note that the parameter estimates are adjusted for regional GDP per capita, regional type \n(metropolitan or mountainous), net migration and total population of the region.\n\n 124 Countries included are Austria, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Finland.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 88\n\n Figure 2.4: Regional trends in acquisitive crime (burglary, car theft and robbery) and homicide rates between \nborder and non-border NUTS 3 regions\n\n Interestingly, the trend is similar to the one reported in the previous section for trends across countries. Overall, \ncrime rates tend to decrease faster for border regions than for non-border regions.\n\n While it is important to stress that this analysis cannot identify any causal effect Schengen enlargement may have \nhad on crime rates in border countries and their border regions, the results do not support the hypothesis that the \nabolition of internal borders has led to an increase in crime or that border regions would be particularly affected by \nthis phenomenon.\n\n 2. Illicit drug trade\n\n As mentioned above, crime is a multifaceted phenomenon and any attempt to try to investigate its associations \nshould consider different types of crimes. Whereas the sections above looked at acquisitive and violent crime, in \nthis section we examine in more detail whether abolishing direct border controls at border crossing points alters \nthe ability of countries to tackle cross-border drug trafficking. Some argue that there is a clear \u2018border effect\u2019 and \nthat a lack of border controls, as one important supply-reduction strategy, weakens attempts to efficiently combat \nthe illicit drug trade. The argument is that open borders reduce the costs of trafficking as, once the drug has \npassed external Schengen 6.7 6.8 6.9\n\n 7\n\n 7.1\n\n 2008 2009 2010\n\n y ear\n\n border NUTS3 region non-border NUTS3 region\n\n acquisitive crime rate\n\n .2 .4 .6 .8\n\n 1\n\n ln homicide rate\n\n\n\n 2008 2009 2010\n\n y ear\n\n border NUTS3 region non-border NUTS3 region\n\n homicide rate\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 89\n\n borders, arguably no further controls within the whole Schengen Area should be expected (McCabe 2015). This is \nmore or less in line with the argumentation of the basic economic framework of crime whereby a lack of direct \nborder controls may reduce the expected \u2018cost\u2019 of criminal activity, in this case, trafficking illicit drugs across \nborders. However, at the same time one could argue that supply-reduction strategies such as improved cross-\nborder police cooperation and other law-enforcement mechanisms building on Schengen compensatory measures \ncould have made the fight against drug trafficking more effective. For instance, police resources that were caught \nup at border controls can now focus on other activities such as combatting cross-border crime (P\u00e1na 2011). \nHence, the argumentation could go in both directions and the theoretical arguments are inconclusive.\n\n The aim of this analysis is to investigate whether the abolishment of border controls in light of Schengen is \nhampering the fight against the illicit drug trade across Europe. We compare how different proxy indicators of \nsupply-reduction efforts evolve before and after a country abolishes border controls. Attributing before and after \ntrends in the quantity of seized drugs in a given country only to Schengen may be misleading as other (unobserved) \neffects might influence such indicators, including changes in demand or supply shocks in production countries. In \norder to take these factors into account we benchmark the change in the volume of drugs seized before and after \nbecoming member of the Schengen Area with countries that have not been part of the area at a given point in time.\n\n Note that analysing illicit drug markets is not straightforward due to some special features of such illegal markets, \nincluding for instance (1) the role of imperfect information where sellers and buyers are uncertain about the quality \nand quantity of drugs in a transaction and (2) the role of enforcement in affecting the price of drugs and the way \nthey are produced and distributed. Firstly, when buying an illegal drug one only learns its purity after the sale is \nmade. Based on US data, Galenianos, Liccardo Pacula, and Persico (2009) found that five to ten per cent of \ntransactions were faked. These so-called \u2018rip-off\u2019 transactions involved no drug content at all, although buyers paid \nthe same average amount for the product as they did for real drugs. Unlike in a normal goods market, product \nquality in a drug market cannot be enforced by the buyer lawfully. Galenianos et al. (2009) argue that under these \ncircumstances repeated transactions with a particular seller are more likely \u2013 or, in other words, regular buyers \nkeep their sellers honest by discouraging rip-offs. That is, stronger enforcement may make repeated interactions \nmore likely and increase the purity of the drug sold. For instance, higher levels of undercover police activity may \ninduce a higher risk of switching suppliers as the next supplier could be an undercover police officer. Hence, it has \nto be taken into account that enforcement may affect simultaneously the quantity and quality sold in a given drug \nmarket.\n\n Secondly, when looking at the supply side with a focus on Europe, synthetic drugs and marijuana (for instance) are \nproduced within Europe but also trafficked into European countries over a variety of different trafficking routes \n(EMCDDA 2015). Stronger enforcement in some of the source countries could increase costs of production and \n\n\n\nhence induce a substitution effect to synthetic drugs or marijuana produced within European borders. However, it \nis not only changes in enforcement in source countries which might affect production of these drugs. More efficient \nborder controls may lead to fewer drugs being trafficked cross-border, with a resultant increase in domestic \nproduction to satisfy demand. These two factors may confound any parameter estimate in empirical analysis.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 90\n\n Therefore, to mitigate the confounding nature of these challenges in analysing the drug markets described above, \nwe focus only on drugs with virtually zero production within Europe: cocaine and opiates.\n\n Cocaine is mainly produced in South America and shipped over different routes to Europe. The main countries \nthrough which cocaine enters Europe are Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy, with the first two \nproviding the major share of cocaine seizures (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime [UNODC] 2009). Western \nEurope, one the world\u2019s largest heroin markets, sources its heroin primarily from opium grown in Afghanistan via a \nnumber of land routes, including the \u2018northern\u2019 route across Central Asia and Russia, and the \u2018Balkan\u2019 route across \nEastern and Southeastern Europe (Siddharth & Barkell 2013). For both cocaine and opiates, European supply-side \nreduction strategies are predominantly based on intelligence-led law enforcement, including exchange of \ninformation across national and international agencies (Council of the EU 2008).\n\n As outlined in the analytical framework by Kilmer and Hoorens (2010), a host of indicators exist to assess whether \nsupply-side reduction measures work. These include, among others, drug seizures and purity-adjusted prices. In \nessence, seizures of illicit drugs serve several purposes: (1) as a potential deterrent to transporting drugs (across \nborders); (2) generating information about the geographic flow of drugs; and (3) providing a performance measure \nfor law-enforcement agencies. The issue with drug seizures as a supply-reduction indicator is that it is a function of \nthe overall quantity of drugs shipped, the relative performance of the enforcement agencies, and the general \u2018ability\u2019 \nor \u2018productivity\u2019 of drug traffickers. So for instance, observing an increase in the volume of drug seized between \nSchengen states compared to non-Schengen states (e.g. comparing Hungary with Serbia) after 2008 could, all else \nbeing equal, be driven simply by a larger volume of drug traffic through Hungary, as smugglers may find it more \neffective to change their route through states without physical border controls. Hence, in order to investigate in a \nmore comprehensive manner whether Schengen is associated with alterations in supply-reduction strategies we \nalso look at drug prices. Note that while one might expect reductions in drug supply due to effective enforcement to \nlead to higher drug prices, looking at raw drug prices alone is misleading as suppliers can adjust the purity of the \ndrug in response to enforcement-led changes in drug supply. Hence we look at purity-adjusted prices which are \ncalculated by dividing the total price paid for a unit of a drug by its purity.\n\n For the purpose of this analysis we use data from the World Drug Report provided by the United Nation\u2019s Office on \nDrugs and Crime (UNODC) online database.125 Data on seizures on opiates and cocaine is collected by the \nUNODC through Annual Questionnaire Reports (ARQ). For many countries the data is available virtually from the \nearly 1980s until 2014. In addition we use data on purity and prices from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs \nand Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), which is available from 1995 onwards. The data on prices and purity for opiates is \npatchy across time and country coverage; hence we use only price and purity data for cocaine, which therefore \nalso serves as the main drug we focus on in our analysis, although we also include seizures of heroin for \ncompleteness.\n\n 125            https://data.unodc.org/\n\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 91\n\n Since the data on prices and purity are only available since 1995 and some observations before the country \nentered the Schengen Area is needed to perform a before and after comparison, we include all European countries \nin our sample only from the 2000 Schengen enlargement round up to 2007, and those countries that have never \nbeen part of the Schengen Area (Ireland, the UK and non-EU countries such as Turkey) which act as comparison \ngroups. We exclude Switzerland from the analysis because even though Switzerland entered the Schengen Area in \n2008, it still has running border crossing points to check the flow of goods.\n\n In essence, we run the following econometric model using OLS: \u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1=\u00f0 \u203a0+\u00f0 \u203a1\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u2019\u00f0 \u2018\u017d\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1\u00f0 \u2018\u2022+\u03a3\u00f0 \u203a\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \n\u2018\u2019\u00f0 \u2018\u017d\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1+\u00f0 \u203a\u00f0 \u2018\u2020\u00f0 \u2018 \u00e2\u201e\u017d\u00f0 \u2018\u2019\u00f0 \u2018\u203a\u00f0 \u2018\u201d\u00f0 \u2018\u2019\u00f0 \u2018\u203a\u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1+\u00f0 \u203a\u00f0  \u00b6\u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1+\u00f0 \u0153\u00f0 \u2018 +\u00f0 \u0153\u20ac\u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1=2 (2)\n\n Where \u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1 in equation (2) represents the natural logarithm of the volume of seized drugs (in kilograms) and \nthe purity-adjusted drug prices in a given country i at time t, \u00f0 \u2018\u00a1\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u2019\u00f0 \u2018\u017d\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1\u00f0 \u2018\u2022 represents an indicator variable \nwhich takes the value 1 if the country is in the treatment group (e.g. country enters Schengen at some point) and \u00f0 \n\u2018\u2020\u00f0 \u2018 \u00e2\u201e\u017d\u00f0 \u2018\u2019\u00f0 \u2018\u203a\u00f0 \u2018\u201d\u00f0 \u2018\u2019\u00f0 \u2018\u203a\u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1 is an indicator that takes the value 1 if the country has abolished its border controls \nas a result of entering the Schengen Area, \u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u2019\u00f0 \u2018\u017d\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1 is a set of indicator variables that capture common year \neffects across all countries, and \u00f0 \u0153\u00f0 \u2018  represents a country-specific time-invariant effect. To explain further, the \ncommon year effects aim to capture general trends in consumption of a specific drug, whereas the country-fixed \neffects should take into account time-invariant effects specific to a country, including for instance any differences \nacross countries in reporting drug seizures. \u00f0  \u00b6\u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1 is a vector of country-specific time-varying effects, including \nproxies for demand-side measures, such as total population or GDP per capita, but also the amount of public \nmoney spend per capita on policy and public safety.126 We also include the proportion of young males among the \ntotal population and the unemployment rate.\n\n 2.1 Trends in supply-reduction indicators before and after entering Schengen\n\n Table 2.10 reports associations between the abolishment of internal border controls after entering the Schengen \nArea and the volume of seized cocaine and heroin and purity-adjusted prices of cocaine. The parameter estimates \nin column (1) and (2) suggest that on average, countries that entered Schengen after 2000 have increased \nquantities of seized cocaine and heroin by around 50 to 67 per cent, respectively. To put that into perspective, this \nmeans that the pre-Schengen average of around 50kg of seized drugs increased to around 75kg annually, whereas \nthe pre-Schengen average of around 60kg increased to around 100kg annually in the countries under \nconsideration.\n\n Looking at purity-adjusted prices for cocaine, we observe that entering the Schengen Area increases on average \nthe purity-adjusted prices by around nine per cent. That is to say, the empirical findings suggest not only that the \namount of seized drugs increased but also the purity-adjusted prices. Even though our analysis cannot fully control \nfor demand-side mechanisms (we include only total population and GDP per capita as demand-side indicators), \ngiven the assumption that demand for drugs, in this case cocaine, is price-\n\n 126 Based on COFOG data:            https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=SNA_TABLE11\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n\n PE 581.387 92\n\n inelastic, then the simultaneous increase in purity-adjusted prices may suggest a supply-side effect driving the \nresults.\n\n It is important to stress that the parameter estimates presented Table 2.10 represent associations and not \nnecessarily causal effects between entering the Schengen Area and indicators for supply-reduction measures. \nNevertheless, our findings highlight the fact that entering the Schengen Area does not hamper the ability of states \nto effectively combat the illicit drug trade. If there is an effect at all, then the associations reported suggest that \nsupply-reduction efforts may become more efficient when a country enters the Schengen Area.\n\n At first glance, the fact that abolishing border controls may increase the number of drug seizures might seem \ncounterintuitive. That is to say, a lack of border controls would seem to make it easier for drug traffickers to move \ndrugs within the Schengen Area as they do not face the risk of being captured once they pass physical border \ncontrols. This argument is made in McCabe (2015). One potential factor which may explain our findings is that \nbetter cross-border police cooperation in light of Schengen might have led to better or more frequent information \nexchange. In addition, police resources that have been performing static border enforcement may have become \nmore efficiently used in combatting drug trafficking.\n\n Table 2.10: Schengen and indicators of supply-reduction measures.\n\n (1)\n\n (2)\n\n (3)\n\n Dependant variable:\n\n In seizures of cocaine\n\n In seizures of heroin\n\n In purity-adjusted price of cocaine\n\n treat\n\n \u201311.0150\n\n \u201310.4487\n\n \u20131.2603\n\n (5.398)**\n\n (2.912)***\n\n (0.466)***\n\n Schengen\n\n\n\n 0.5348\n\n 0.6798\n\n 0.0927\n\n (0.299)*\n\n (0.379)*\n\n (0.055)*\n\n Constant\n\n \u2013142.5473\n\n \u201398.4652\n\n 31.3854\n\n (58.966)**\n\n (27.939)***\n\n (4.681)***\n\n Observations\n\n 387\n\n 598\n\n 368\n\n R-squared\n\n 0.6908\n\n 0.4197\n\n 0.6778\n\n Notes: Clustered (country) standard errors in parentheses, *** p<0.01, **p<0.05, *p<0.1.

This \ncorresponds to trust at different levels, mainly trust between member states and trust between the public and \nnational and EU institutions. To the best\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 93\n\n of our knowledge no comprehensive quantitative data on inter-country trust is available.127 To address this gap, in \nthis section we use the European Social Survey (ESS) to investigate whether abolishing border controls is \nassociated with changes in public trust. The ESS has asked individuals since 2002 in different regions and \ncountries across Europe about how much they trust others, politicians, the national and European Parliament, the \npolice, and the legal system. Since the data is only available from 2002 onwards, we focus our analysis on the 2007 \nSchengen enlargement and compare how different measures of trust in these countries have evolved before and \nafter they joined the Schengen Area. As comparison group we use other non-Schengen countries in the same \nregion. In addition, as when analysing the associations between abolishing border controls and crime rates, we \nalso investigate how measures of trust have changed in existing Schengen states after 2007 compared to before \n2007. To that end we run the following regression model using OLS: \u00f0 \u2018\u00a1\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u00a2\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1\u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018 \u00f0 \u2018\u00a1=\u00f0 \u203a0+\u00f0 \u203a1\u00f0 \u2018\u017d\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1\u00f0 \n\u2018\u2019\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1+\u00f0 \u203a2\u00f0 \u2018\u201d\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u0153\u00f0 \u2018\u00a2\u00f0 \u2018 \u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018 \u00f0 \u2018\u00a1+ \u00f0 \u203a3(\u00f0 \u2018\u017d\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1\u00f0 \u2018\u2019\u00f0 \u2018&lowast;\u00f0 \u2018\u201d\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u0153\u00f0 \u2018\u00a2\u00f0 \u2018 )\u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018 \u00f0 \u2018\u00a1+\u00f0 \u203a4\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1+\u00f0 \u0153\u00f0 \n\u2018 +\u03b3\u00f0 \u2018 \u00f0 \u2018\u00a1+\u00f0 \u0153\u20ac\u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1 (3)\n\n Where \u00f0 \u2018\u00a1\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u00a2\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1\u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018 \u00f0 \u2018\u00a1 represents a measure of trust for individual i in country or region c at time t, \u00f0 \u2018\u017d\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \n\u2018\u00a1\u00f0 \u2018\u2019\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1 is a dummy variable taking the value 1 after 2008, the year after the 2007 Eastern Schengen \nenlargement. \u00f0 \u2018\u201d\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u0153\u00f0 \u2018\u00a2\u00f0 \u2018 \u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018 \u00f0 \u2018\u00a1 takes the value 1 if an individual lives in a country belonging to the specific \ngroup of interest.

In our analysis we \ninclude trust based on the variables and questions outlined in Table 2.11, which can be observed over all surveys of \nthe ESS between 2002 and 2014. In order to measure trust in the criminal justice system we combine the variables \ntrust in police and trust in the legal system. In order to create a measure of trust in national political institutions we \nalso combine the variables trust in national parliament and trust in politicians.128 The only variable measuring trust \nin European institutions is the variable trust in the European Parliament. In the lack of alternative measures, we use \nthis variable as a proxy measure for trust in European institutions in general.\n\n 127 There are surveys, such as Pew\u2019s Global Attitudes Project, that ask respondents about their views of a \nselected small number of major world countries or their policies. However, these questions are typically limited to a \nsmall number of countries and cannot be used for a systematic analysis of inter-country trust within the EU.\n\n\n\n 128 Note that we take the average value of both variables combined.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 94\n\n Table 2.11: Measures of trust included in the ESS, 2002\u20132014.\n\n Trust measure\n\n ESS: variables/questions\n\n Scale\n\n General trust\n\n Most people can be trusted or you can\u2019t be too careful\n\n 0 (you can\u2019t be too careful) to 10 (people can be trusted)\n\n Trust in criminal justice system\n\n Trust in the police\n\n 0 (no trust at all) to 10 (complete trust)\n\n Trust in the legal system\n\n 0 (no trust at all) to 10 (complete trust)\n\n Trust in national political institutions\n\n Trust in national parliament\n\n 0 (no trust at all) to 10 (complete trust)\n\n Trust in politicians\n\n 0 (no trust at all) to 10 (complete trust)\n\n Trust in European institutions\n\n Trust in the European Parliament\n\n 0 (no trust at all) to 10 (complete trust)\n\n Notes: we combine trust in police and the legal system by taking the average of the two; the same applies to trust \nin national parliament and trust in politicians.\n\n 1.1 Cross-country trends in different measures of trust (2002\u20132014)\n\n\n\n The full regression output of estimating equation (3) can be found tables AD.1 and AD.2 in Appendix D. Tables \n2.12 and 2.13 summarise the main findings regarding trends in trust over time for newly acceding states that \nentered the Schengen Area at the end of 2007 and for existing Schengen states before and after 2008, \nrespectively.\n\n For the sample containing new Schengen states and countries that have not (yet) joined Schengen in the same \nregion, we observe on average an increasing trend in trust across the board. This includes general trust, trust in \nthe criminal justice system, trust in national and European institutions. Over the same time period, we observe that, \ncomparing before and after 2008, trust in non-Schengen countries decreased. Similar trends apply to existing \nSchengen states when we examine the trend before and after 2008. Overall, general trust has increased but tends \nto be more pronounced in existing Schengen states with direct borders to the newly acceding states entering the \narea in 2007.\n\n Table 2.12: Change in trust before and after 2008 for newly acceding Schengen and non-Schengen countries in \nthe same region\n\n (1)\n\n (2)\n\n (3)\n\n (4)\n\n Newly acceding countries\n\n general trust\n\n trust in criminal justice system\n\n trust in national institutions\n\n trust in European institutions\n\n \u0394 before 2008 - after 2008\n\n (1) Non-Schengen\n\n \u20135.28%\n\n \u20135.41%\n\n \u20138.86%\n\n \u201311.71%\n\n (2) Schengen\n\n 13.62%\n\n\n\n 6.28%\n\n 1.38%\n\n 3.55%\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 95\n\n (2)-(1)\n\n 18.90%\n\n 11.69%\n\n 10.24%\n\n 15.26%\n\n Note: based on parameter estimates reported in table AD.1 in Appendix D.\n\n Table 2.13: Change in trust before and after 2008 for existing Schengen states with direct or no direct borders to \nnewly acceding states entering the area in 2007\n\n (1)\n\n (2)\n\n (3)\n\n (4)\n\n Existing Schengen states\n\n general trust\n\n trust in criminal justice system\n\n trust in national institutions\n\n trust in European institutions\n\n \u0394 before 2008 - after 2008\n\n (1) No direct border\n\n 2.10%\n\n\n\n 0.37%\n\n 7.45%\n\n 1.76%\n\n (2) Direct border\n\n 3.93%\n\n 2.13%\n\n 16.43%\n\n 2.11%\n\n (2)-(1)\n\n 1.83%\n\n 1.76%\n\n 8.98%\n\n 0.35%\n\n Note: based on parameter estimates reported in table AD.2 in Appendix D.\n\n 1.2 Cross-regional trends in trust: border versus non-border regions\n\n In addition to cross-country trends in different measures of trust, we also examine trends at the regional level by \ncomparing border and non-border regions within countries in light of the 2007 Schengen enlargement. In essence, \nusing the analytical framework outlined in equation (3) we use the regional component from the ESS multilevel \ndata129 that is available for the years 2008, 2010 and 2012. We adjust the results for demographic factors such as \nage, gender, education, citizenship and domicile and use the weights provided in the ESS to make the reported \nvalues representative. In addition we include regional fixed effects (NUTS 2 or NUTS 1 level) and regional-specific \ntime effects which adjust for all factors that vary over time by region.\n\n In the analysis a region is defined as a \u2018border region\u2019 when its borders have been abolished in the 2007 \nenlargement, including for instance German\u2013Czech or German\u2013Polish regions with border crossing points. It is \nimportant to note that the ESS multilevel reports are not the same NUTS levels for the countries included. Notably, \nGerman regions are reported on the NUTS 1 level, whereas for instance regions of the Czech Republic are \nreported as NUTS 3 regions. This needs to be taken into account when comparing different trends, in that the \nunderlying entity differs.\n\n\n\n Figures 2.5 and 2.6 illustrate the fact that, albeit having different levels in existing Schengen states, general trends \nacross different measures of trust are very similar for border and non-border regions for the sample of newly \nacceding Schengen states, as well for the existing Schengen states.\n\n 129            http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/data/multilevel/\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 96\n\n Figure 2.5: Trends for border and non-border regions in different measures of trust for newly acceding states that \nentered Schengen Area in 2007.\n\n Note: entries based on ESS multilevel data.\n\n 11.21.41.61.8general trust200820102012yearborder regionnon-border regiongeneral11.21.41.61.8trust in EU \ninstitutions200820102012yearborder regionnon-border regionEU institutions11.21.41.61.8trust \ninstitutions200820102012yearborder regionnon-border regionNational institutions11.21.41.61.8trust in criminal \njustice system200820102012yearborder regionnon-border regioncriminal justice system\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 97\n\n Figure 2.6: Trends for border and non-border regions in different measures of trust for existing Schengen states \nwith direct borders to newly acceding states that entered Schengen Area in 2007.\n\n Note: entries based on ESS multilevel data.\n\n 1.851.91.9522.05general trust200820102012yearborder regionnon-border regiongeneral1.851.91.9522.05trust in \nEU institutions200820102012yearborder regionnon-border regionEU institutions1.851.91.9522.05trust \ninstitutions200820102012yearborder regionnon-border regionNational institutions1.851.91.9522.05trust in criminal \njustice system200820102012yearborder regionnon-border regioncriminal justice system\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 98\n\n CHAPTER 3 \u2013 OPTIONS FOR CONCERTED ACTION AT EU LEVEL\n\n As the analysis presented in the previous section and wider academic literature demonstrates, there are positive \neconomic, social and political outcomes associated with the Schengen Agreement. Therefore, it is worth examining \npossible areas for concerted EU action that may help restore Schengen to its full functioning and thus potentially \nhelp reclaim the full extent of Schengen\u2019s benefits. This is the objective of this chapter. We reiterate that the \ninclusion of policy options for more concerted action at the EU level stems from the contextual considerations \n\nhttp://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/data/multilevel/\n\n\npresented in chapter 1 and take into account the costs discussed in chapter 2. Therefore, these need to be \nunderstood as a discussion of responses to a political situation in which trust between member states has been \neroded, as has that of the general public in the EU\u2019s ability to uphold common standards and policies in the areas of \nborder control, migration and asylum. Therefore, in addition to examining options pertaining to the Schengen \ngovernance framework, we dedicate a section to options for EU action in the following three policy areas:\n\n - External border control\n\n - Police and judicial cooperation\n\n - Asylum and migration law\n\n In each of these areas we take stock of existing initiatives and additional possible options along with their possible \nimpact, building on available literature supplemented by interviewee testimonials where available. In each policy \narea we also consider the acceptability and feasibility of EU action in a given area.\n\n Ultimately, not all options discussed in this chapter should be seen as a pre-requisite for a return to the normal \nfunctioning of Schengen. For instance, as laid out in the EC\u2019s \u2018Back to Schengen\u2019 roadmap (EC 2016a), the \nobjective is to return to a normally functioning Schengen Area by the end of 2016, although some of the options \ndiscussed in this chapter may conceivably require longer to take effect. Accordingly, some options are more likely to \nhave an impact in the near future than others and may therefore be more important, at least from the short-term \npoint of view. This sense of prioritisation can be seen in the EC\u2019s exploratory memorandum to its May 2016 \nrecommendation to prolong current internal border controls. The document calls for the following initiatives to be \u2018in \nplace and fully operational without delay\u2019 (EC 2016n): (1) the European Coast and Border Guard, (2) full \napplication of EU asylum law provisions, (3) improved implementation of the emergency relocation scheme, and (4) \nthe EU\u2013Turkey joint action.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 99\n\n I - Schengen governance framework\n\n Action in this area could address the following needs arising from the political context surrounding the re-\nintroduction of internal border controls\n\n - Need to improve the management and monitoring of cross-border flows\n\n Policy options in this area\n\n - Improve the enforcement of the existing Schengen acquis.\n\n - Expand the use and functionality of SIS.\n\n - Continue implementing the new Schengen evaluation system.\n\n Possible impact of undertaken steps\n\n\n\n - The steps discussed below, particularly upgrades to SIS, are likely to contribute to greater exchange of \ninformation and, by extension, to addressing some of the current security concerns.\n\n - However, overall, the existing Schengen governance framework appears to be broadly fit for purpose and does \nnot require major modifications. The impact of any steps discussed in this section on the political context leading to \nthe re-introduction of internal border controls is therefore very limited.\n\n This section discusses areas of possible action covered by the Schengen governance framework. Namely, the \nfollowing three topics: (1) the Schengen evaluation mechanism; (2) SBC provisions pertaining to the re-introduction \nof internal controls; and (3) Schengen Information System.\n\n 1. Enforcement of existing rules\n\n Before embarking on introducing new initiatives, it is important to recognise that better use can also be made of \nexisting legislation and instruments by ensuring that member states have implemented all relevant acquis in an \nappropriate way and/or are compliant with their provisions. With respect to the Schengen acquis, EC\u2019s seventh bi-\nannual report on Schengen (EC 2015k) noted violations of Schengen provisions in terms of ensuring the absence of \ninternal border controls. Most often these pertained to the obligation to ensure that any controls conducted in \nborder areas do not have an effect equivalent to that of formal border controls (Article 23) and to the duty to \nremove obstacles to traffic flow (Article 24). In response, the EC\u2019s use of formal notices, information exchanges, \ninvestigations (with the possible escalation to infringement proceedings and their established system of financial \nsanctions [EC, 2016l]) have been and remain an important tool to help ensure member-state compliance with \nexisting EU law. Improved compliance with Schengen acquis has beneficial impacts on individuals crossing internal \nborders. However, viewed from the perspective of the needs expressed by those member states that have re-\nintroduced internal border controls, it is difficult to see that better compliance with the Schengen acquis would have \nany impact on the current political context which has led to the re-introduction of internal border controls.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 100\n\n 2. SBC rules on the re-introduction of internal controls\n\n Several comments can be made on SBC Articles 25-30 on the basis of interviews and wider literature. Overall, \nevery interviewee who commented on the topic felt that the current system is working well. One interviewee \nstressed that the provisions of Article 29 and the role of the EU in their introduction helpfully incorporate the need \nfor a multilateral solution, well suited to current challenges, which span the domains of border control, asylum, \nmigration law and so on.130 Having said which, the interviewee added that this assessment is based on the \nassumption that current issues can be resolved within two years given that current rules are unable to address an \nevent of a longer duration.\n\n With respect to the provisions of Article 25 and 28, two interviewees pointed out that there was a disconnect \nbetween the original aims of Article 25 and Article 28 and the way in which these have been used in the past year. \nThe introduction of the two articles in 2013 did not foresee the current scale of the migrant crisis; rather, the \nintention was to address member states\u2019 needs related to temporary circumstances such as high-profile sport \nevents. However, this was not the reason for which Schengen countries invoked Article 25 and 28 in 2015. The fact \nthat the EC agreed with those re-introductions further demonstrates what one interviewee called a \u2019shift in the \ninterpretation\u2019 of the suspension measures. Importantly, though, this is not a criticism of the suspension measures \n\n\n\nper se. Articles 25 and 28 also have the advantage of giving member states the possibility of responding to any \ndevelopments while the EC assesses the need to trigger provisions covered by Article 29.\n\n Peers (2013) assessed the changes to the SBC resulting in the introduction of Article 29. He argued that the new \nprovisions amounted to a compromise between those desiring to increase member state power over the re-\nimposition of border controls and those advocating a shift towards more EC control. The author welcomed the \nintroduction of greater measures to increase member states\u2019 accountability once they decide to re-introduce border \ncontrols in the form of reporting requirements and detailed criteria to be applied in the decision process.131\n\n The report by Peers also highlighted several potentially problematic areas. First, member states are free to react to \nan EC decision related to Article 29 controls in any way they deem fit and it is conceivable that the consequences of \nany divergence in how member states re-\n\n 130 The existing provisions of Article 29 are mirrored in proposed amendment by the EC to the European Border \nand Coast Guard Agency proposal, which would provide for a coordinated re-introduction of internal controls if the \nfunctioning of the Schengen Area is at risk due to the fact that a member state does not ensure proper follow up to \na vulnerability assessment conducted by the agency or does not request sufficient support from the agency to \nrespond to a specific and disproportionate pressure at its external borders.\n\n 131 Member states\u2019 adherence to this reporting process is well illustrated by the series of notifications published \nover the course of the last year. In addition, the EC and Council of the EU have expressed views on the application \nof these criteria, although these by themselves are not legally binding.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 101\n\n impose border controls may be somewhat chaotic. Second, the applicable rules do not specify what it actually \nmeans to re-introduce internal controls and, for instance, how similar their regime should be compared to that of \nexternal Schengen borders. Ultimately, however, this is not to suggest that member states\u2019 discretion in this area \nhas resulted in systematic issues and there does not appear to be any evidence of that having occurred since the \nuse of Article 29 in May 2016. Instead, it is discussed here as a potential risk which may or may not merit \naddressing through greater coordination efforts.\n\n 3. Schengen Information System\n\n The Schengen Information System is another of the \u2018compensatory\u2019 measures introduced to complement the \nabolition of internal borders and represents a common database of the Schengen Area. In operation since 1995, it \nenables relevant national authorities to share and access in real-time information on people as well as goods \n(Delivet 2015). In 2013, a second generation of the system (SIS II) was launched and the management of the new \nversion was transferred to a then recently created agency \u2013 the European Agency for the operational management \nof Large-Scale IT Systems (eu-LISA).132\n\n In 2015, eu-LISA (2015) published a report on the technical functioning of SIS II focusing on its central system and \ncommunication infrastructure. The report described the technical availability and performance of the system as \n\u2018excellent\u2019 and did not find any considerable impact on ongoing operations stemming from a small number of \nreported incidents. In addition, eu-LISA noted a steady increase in the overall use of SIS since its inception in 2013. \n\n\n\nThe latest EC reports on the functioning of Schengen (EC 2015c, 2015k) also highlighted the central role played by \nSIS and noted several recent initiatives to further improve its performance, such as amendments to the SIRENE \n(Supplementary Information Request at the National Entry) Manual and new visualisation functionalities. Efforts \nhave also been made to align SIS and Interpol\u2019s firearms database.\n\n At the same time, while the EC\u2019s seventh bi-annual report (EC 2015k) on Schengen welcomed increases in the use \nand functionality of SIS, it noted \u2018significant discrepancies\u2019 in the employment of SIS between member states. The \neighth Schengen Report (EC 2015c) did not elaborate on this observation other than adding that \u2018the majority\u2019 of \nmember states made good use of advances in the system\u2019s functionality, suggesting that there were some member \nstates that did not.\n\n Along similar lines, in its November 2015 resolution (EP 2015c), the European Parliament called on member states \nto increase the use of available information-exchange tools, including the SIS and VIS (Visa Information System). \nOne interviewee highlighted the contribution of regular evaluations and noted that member states are good at \nfollowing up on resulting recommendations. An up-to-date indication of the use of the SIS by member states, along \nwith a discussion of further possible areas for improvement, can be expected from the upcoming results of an \nevaluation of SIS II, projected by the EC to be available in\n\n 132 In addition to SIS II, the European Agency is currently managing EURODAC and the Visa Information System \n(VIS) (eu-LISA, n.d.).\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 102\n\n the second quarter of 2016.133 This is in line with the roadmap for the evaluation of SIS II (EC 2016k).\n\n Several additional efforts to improve SIS are envisaged in the foreseeable future and should be acknowledged \nhere. In February 2016 the EC published a report on the ability of SIS to use fingerprint information for identification \npurposes (EC 2016t). The report concluded that the technology (Automatic Fingerprint Identification System \u2013 \nAFIS) was ready for incorporation into SIS, which paved the way for its implementation.134 According to a May \n2016 memo from the EC, the system will be ready in mid-2017 (EC 2016i). In other developments, the Council of \nthe EU Presidency is preparing an action plan on SIS and foreign terrorist fighters and on addressing notable \noperational difficulties. The action plan is expected to be published before the presidency\u2019s end. Later in 2016, the \nEC is expected to propose a revision of SIS. This proposal will address, among other issues, the following areas: \n(1) return of irregular migrants and entry bans, (2) biometric identification through facial images, and (3) alerts for \nwanted unknown persons (EC 2016i).\n\n The SIS was initially perceived as deficient in terms of data protection and fundamental rights (Centre for the Study \nof Global Ethics 2010; Parkin 2011). However, more recent official publications document existing data-protection \nsafeguards such as controlled access restricted only to information necessary for the performance of the tasks of \nrelevant authorities (EC 2015a).\n\n The Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) is currently examining the risks and benefits of holding individuals\u2019 \npersonal data, particularly with regards to biometric data, in the SIS (and VIS and Eurodac), although the results are \nnot yet available (FRA, n.d.a). Interestingly, a related survey conducted by the FRA concerning travellers\u2019 \nperception of the use of biometrics showed that most travellers do not view this as a rights violation (FRA 2015).\n\n 4. Schengen evaluation and monitoring system\n\n\n\n The Schengen evaluation system is among the compensatory measures adopted to complement the abolition of \ninternal borders in the Schengen Area (Delivet 2015), originally set up as a permanent mechanism in 1998 at the \nintergovernmental level.135 Following the communitarisation of the Schengen acquis by the Treaty of Amsterdam, \nthe responsibility of the Evaluation Standing Committee was taken over by the Council of the EU\u2019s Schengen \nEvaluation Working Party (SCH-EVAL) (Council of the EU 2014).\n\n 133 As indicated in a response to an MEP question (EP 2016a).\n\n 134 An interviewee highlighted a current gap that will be targeted. There is no effective search function associated \nwith fingerprint information, meaning that the information is useful only if there is a name attached to the fingerprint \nthat is being checked.\n\n 135 The standing committee on the evaluation and implementation of Schengen. The committee\u2019s tasks were (1) \nassessing the progress of candidate countries towards meeting the conditions for entry, and (2) monitoring the \nimplementation of Schengen acquis in member states that were already parties to the convention (Arbid ne et al. \n2016).\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 103\n\n In 2013, the Council of the EU adopted a regulation to strengthen the Schengen evaluation mechanism, the first \nsince its early version agreed in the late 1990s (Council of the EU 2013b). According to the new mechanism, the \nEC is tasked with establishing a multi-annual and an annual work programme, whereby each member states would \nbe evaluated every five years.136 The evaluations draw on several data collection exercises: (1) a questionnaire \nprepared by the EC in consultation with member states, Frontex, and Europol to be completed by competent \nnational authorities; (2) on-site visits (both announced and unannounced) conducted by experts designated by \nmember states and EC representatives; and (3), if requested, risk analyses conducted by EU bodies, offices and \nagencies other than Frontex that are involved in the implementation of the Schengen acquis.\n\n Based on these activities, member state experts and EC representatives prepare evaluation reports and formulate \nrecommendations to remedy any observed deficiencies. These are then submitted to the Council of the EU for \nconsideration.137 The evaluation system also includes a follow-up mechanism by which a member state found in \nneglect of its obligations is required to prepare an action plan in response to any recommendations from the Council \nof the EU. The adequacy of this action plan is subject to EC assessment and its implementation needs to be \nregularly reported on by the member state. Commenting on the new division of responsibilities between the EC and \nmember states, one interviewee noted that the involvement of the EC has created a more formal and actionable \nmechanism, although some member states have expressed reservations about a perceived loss of say in the \nprocess.\n\n The EC\u2019s Seventh Bi-annual Report on Schengen (EC 2015k) commented on the implementation of the new \nevaluation regime, which started in November 2014. The report noted that the rollout of the new system was \npreceded by an intensive training and preparation period, based on a commonly agreed curriculum. The report \nfound the first series of evaluation visits very positive, with good cooperation among all engaged parties including \nthe EC, member states and Frontex. With respect to individual features of the new system, the report highlighted \nthe ability to conduct unannounced visits and the fact that individual member-state evaluations are supposed to \ncover all aspects of Schengen acquis in a relatively short period of time, enabling the evaluators to get a \ncomprehensive snapshot of the situation in a given country. Arbid ne et al. (2016) also argued that innovations in \nthe evaluation mechanism, such as the use of highly qualified experts and unannounced visits, contribute to \u2018high \npreparedness standards\u2019 for relevant national authorities.\n\n\n\n The most recent eighth bi-annual report on Schengen (EC 2015c) offered a somewhat more negative assessment \nof the evaluation process. The report noted that the success of the evaluation mechanism is to a considerable \ndegree dependent on member states\u2019 cooperation and compliance with respect to the Schengen Questionnaire \ndistributed to\n\n 136 In other words, each year five to seven member states would be evaluated (Malmersjo & Rem\u00e1\u010d 2016).\n\n 137 Arbid ne et al. (2016) pointed out that one of the reasons implementing powers to adopt recommendations \nrests with the Council of the EU is to strengthen mutual trust between member states.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 104\n\n relevant national authorities. Regrettably, the record of the member states undergoing an evaluation in 2016 in this \nregard was rather mixed \u2013 half of them failed to return the questionnaire on time (even allowing for extending \ndeadlines). In addition, some of the returned questionnaires either left some questions unanswered or provided \ninformation of poor quality and were thus of limited use to the evaluation. To improve the mechanism\u2019s \neffectiveness and efficiency, the EC developed, with input from member states, a Schengen Evaluation Guide \n(Schengen Committee 2015) and guidelines on the conduct of unannounced visits (Schengen Committee 2014).\n\n 5. Conclusion\n\n In conclusion, there is little evidence that the current Schengen governance framework is not be fit for purpose. \nImprovements can be made, for instance through better enforcement of existing acquis or expanding the use and \nfunctionality of SIS. However, these steps bear little relation to the needs of member states identified in the \nintroduction to this paper and are therefore unlikely to have a major impact on the political context in which internal \nborder controls have been re-introduced.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 105\n\n II - External border control\n\n Action in this area could address the following needs arising from the political context surrounding the re-\nintroduction of internal border controls\n\n - Better management of migratory flows crossing the external border and within the EU.\n\n - Mitigation of terrorist and other security threats.\n\n Policy options in this area\n\n - Increase of the institutional capacity dedicated to the protection of external border through the establishment of \nthe European Border and Coast Guard Agency.\n\n\n\n - Strengthening of border checks through conducting systematic checks against relevant databases, introducing \nthe Entry\u2013Exit System, and utilising common risk indicators.\n\n Possible impact of steps undertaken\n\n - The proposals to strengthen external border checks are expected to result in greater effectiveness of controls. \nSystematic checks would result in greater demands on resources; the EES could result in savings, once initial one-\noff costs are absorbed.\n\n - There appear to be substantial limitations on the potential impact of the European Border and Coast Guard \n(EBCG) Agency. Notably, it would continue to be reliant on member-state resources, which has been an issue for \nFrontex as well.\n\n Given the needs of member states identified in the contextual discussion of this paper, external border control is \nan area where more concerted action at the EU level may merit examination. This section discusses two distinct \nareas of possible action: (1) increases in institutional capacity, and (2) strengthening of external border-check \nprocedures.\n\n 1. Increase in institutional capacity\n\n In response to the increased migration flows seen at Schengen\u2019s external border, the European Union has \nundertaken a series of steps to improve the ability of relevant authorities to manage pressures encountered. These \ninclude hotspots in Italy and Greece (EC 2015c), Frontex joint operations (Triton and Poseidon) and Rapid Border \nIntervention Teams (RABITs), and a naval military operation Sophia. However, as noted by numerous observers, \nthere are clear limits to the effectiveness of these initiatives due to factors such as implementation issues138 and \nthe scope and objectives of the intervention.139\n\n 138 This is particularly applicable to hotspots. See, for instance, (EC 2015b, 2016e, 2016s; Kaca, 2016).\n\n 139 For instance, the UK House of Lords found opration Sophia unable to make a meaningful contribution to the \ndeterrence of the flow of migrants and smuggling networks\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 106\n\n Overall, however, hotspots and other ongoing initiatives intended to manage migrant flows need to be understood \nas extraordinary crisis-response measures. In an effort to systematically increase the effectiveness of external \nborder controls and address some of the challenges described above, the EC proposed in December 2015 to \nestablish a new European Border and Coast Guard (EBCG) Agency (EC 2015i). The proposed new agency would \nreplace Frontex and have additional tasks, responsibilities and powers.140 The EBCG proposal and its features \nbuild on the findings of an independent evaluation of Frontex (Frontex 2015a), conducted in 2015, and incorporate \nrecommendations issued by Frontex management in response to the evaluation (Frontex 2015b). The evaluation \nnoted that while Frontex was operating effectively, several areas with room for improvement could be identified. \nThese included a better delineation of the agency\u2019s role vis-\u00e0-vis national and other EU agencies, lack of monitoring \ncapacity, challenges with access to member-state resources and monitoring of fundamental rights in agency\u2019s \n\n\n\nactivities (Frontex 2015a). The area of fundamental rights was also picked up by the European Ombudsman, which \nrecommended the establishment of a complaints mechanism, as suggested in the EBCG proposal.\n\n To help meet the agency\u2019s objectives, the proposal envisages the doubling of Frontex\u2019s current staff count and the \ndevelopment of a reserve pool of national experts. The latter is supposed to address the current challenge faced by \nFrontex, which relies on member states\u2019 cooperation in responding to its calls for national experts (EC 2016e). \nHowever, Carrera and den Hertog (2016) pointed out that the EBCG would still remain dependent on member \nstates\u2019 resources and as such falls short of a true European system.141\n\n There is no impact assessment available on the EBCG proposal. However, in April 2016, the European Parliament \npublished a study (Rijpma 2016) on the proposal commissioned by the LIBE committee which voiced several \nconcerns. First and foremost, it suggested that the agency\u2019s proposed right to intervene and member states\u2019 \nobligation to provide personnel for intervention teams might be in violation of EU treaties and of member states\u2019 \nexclusive control of their internal security. Secondly, the report felt that the dual mandate of coordinating member-\nstate activities and of monitoring those very activities might be problematic to execute. Thirdly, the EP suggested \nthat the agency\u2019s third-country cooperation be limited to parties to the Geneva Refugee Convention and the \nEuropean Convention on Human Rights. The EP report also suggested that several aspects of the proposal \nrequired further clarification. These were: (1) division of responsibilities between\n\n because, according to the authors, the operation is a response to the symptoms rather than the causes of the \nmigrant crisis (House of Lords, 2016).\n\n 140 These include a right to intervene (with the EC\u2019s approval) in member states if they do not act on previous \nEBCG recommendations, increased monitoring capabilities stemming from a dedicated monitoring centre, and a \ngreater role for the agency in migrant returns. In addition, the proposal foresees the establishment of a complaints \nmechanism (EC 2015i).\n\n 141 In this context, it is worth, however, recalling that this approach is consistent with a 2014 feasibility study on \nEuropean border guards, which observed that member states\u2019 preference was to remain in control of their own \nborder guards. In response, the study recommended a phased approach for any shift in responsibility away from \nthe member-state level.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 107\n\n the agency and other border-management actors; (2) differentiation between the agency\u2019s monitoring and the \nSchengen evaluation mechanism; (3) information to be collected from member states by the agency; and (4) \nresponsibility of the agency\u2019s officers operating outside their country of origin. Finally, the EP recommended that the \nagency\u2019s adherence to the Charter of Fundamental Rights be strengthened.\n\n Carrera and den Hertog (2016) also produced an assessment of the EBCG proposal. The authors stressed that the \nproposed agency would not address what they felt was the principal challenge to the Schengen Area, i.e. \ndeficiencies in the EU\u2019s asylum system and inadequate reception conditions. In addition, they foresaw possible \nchallenges in the fact that the agency\u2019s strengthened coordination role would lead it to work with (para)military \norganisations in some member states. In these instances, the authors argued, it was not clear how the compliance \nof such organisations would be assured and what the reporting lines would be in place in the event of an incident.\n\n\n\n In late June 2016, the European Parliament and Council of the EU agreed on a compromise text of the proposal, \nwhich addresses some of the points raised above (EP 2016c). The revised version incorporated additional \nfundamental rights safeguards to its return provisions and increased the role of the agency in return proceedings, \nthough only following member-state decisions. In situations where member states fail to cooperate with the agency \nor do not take appropriate steps in the event of \u2018specific and disproportionate\u2019 pressure at its external border, the \nproposal suggests this may be grounds for the re-introduction of internal border controls if the functioning of the \nSchengen Area is at risk. To that end, the revised text proposes a revision of Article 29 of the SBC that would \ninclude the provisions of the ECBG regulation (and member-state non-compliance) as a possible reason for \ninvocation of the article.\n\n 2. Strengthening of border checks\n\n 2.1 Systematic checks against relevant databases\n\n In December 2015, the EC put forward a proposal to reinforce checks against relevant databases at external \nborders with the aim of enhancing overall security within the Schengen Area (EC 2015j). The current provisions for \nthird-country nationals foresee systematic checks as to whether such nationals are \u2018considered to be a threat to \npublic policy, internal security or the international relations of any of the member states\u2019 only at entry via external \nSchengen borders. At the exit of external borders, checks take place only \u2018whenever possible\u2019. The new proposal \nnow foresees thorough checks also at the exit, thereby aligning entry and exit requirements, with the consultation of \nrelevant databases becoming binding (EC 2015j). Similar systematic checks are envisaged for persons enjoying the \nright of free movement under EU law.\n\n As for possible technical impacts, the EC expects these systematic checks to lead to \u2018further demands on the \nborder management capacity and resources of member states\u2019 (EC 2016c). In its explanatory memorandum, the \nEC does not see any concern with regard to the respect of fundamental rights in relation to the proposal (EC 2015j). \nRelated to the question\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 108\n\n of possible fundamental rights issues in this area, one interviewee pointed out that these checks would be passive \nonly and would not result in any retention of information such as travel patterns, while another noted that the FRA is \ncurrently looking to update its policing handbook to cover the use of search databases (FRA 2013).\n\n 2.2 Entry\u2013Exit System\n\n Alongside the legislative package described above, the EC also published an updated proposal on the \nestablishment of an Entry\u2013Exit System for the external borders of EU member states in April 2016 as part of its \nproposals on \u2018smart borders\u2019 (EC 2016g). In addition to the three main centralised information systems for EU \nborder management (SIS, VIS and Eurodac), the proposal for an Entry\u2013Exit System (EES) aims to improve \nexternal border management as well as contributing to the fight against terrorism. Furthermore, as there is no \nEuropean-wide provision for the registration of entries and exits of third-country nationals under the current rules \n(EC 2016c), the EES aims to electronically register when and where third-country nationals, who are admitted for a \nshort stay, enter and exit external Schengen borders (EC 2016o).\n\n\n\n The objective of this registration system is to detect overstayers and identify persons who, while within the \nSchengen Area, are not in possession of identity documents. The EES proposal goes further than the proposal on \nthe reinforcement of checks at external borders insofar as the EES would collect new data from third-country \nnationals which are not collected under current border provisions, including alphanumerical data as well as \nfingerprints and facial images. From the perspective of fundamental rights, one interviewee stressed that the current \nEES proposal represents an improvement over its unfavourably received predecessor in 2013 in that it adopts a \nmuch lighter approach in line with recently adopted EU data-protection standards (EU 2016b).\n\n According to an impact assessment accompanying the package, expected advantages of the EES are a positive \nimpact on border-crossing times at entry for travellers using the self-service systems. In addition, the system is \nexpected to improve identification of overstayers and irregular migrants. In terms of the economic cost, it is said that \n\u2018the net present value of the EES becomes positive four years after start of operations and the cumulated benefits \nover ten years are more than 2.5 times the accumulated costs over the same period\u2019 (EC 2016d).\n\n The expected disadvantages of the measures are the negative impact on border-crossing times at entry for visa-\nexempt travellers at first enrolment, although this is mitigated by the use of self-service kiosks. In addition, another \ndisadvantage of the measures are the development costs of the EES, amounting to \u20ac395m over the three years \nthat is required to build the system. The changes required to VIS and SIS have been estimated at a \u20ac40m \ndevelopment cost, although with no additional operational cost.\n\n 2.3 Common risk indicators\n\n In light of the increased risk of terrorist travel, the EC developed a set of common risk indicators (CRIs) in May \n2015. These CRIs were set up in order to detect terrorist travel (EC\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 109\n\n 2016h), particularly in terms of returning terrorist fighters, and to help national border agencies apprehend \nsuspected individuals who could be a threat to public security. In combination with other tools such as the PNR \n(Passenger Name Record), the CRI is intended to track the movement of offenders to help \u2018prevent criminals \nescaping detection by travelling through another member state\u2019 (EC 2015g).\n\n CRIs are meant to be used by all member states during external border checks, screening all returnees \nsystematically to assess their level of risk. Details on the content of CRIs are not known, although the EC noted that \nCRIs are \u2018based on travel trends, patterns and specific characteristics of those persons\u2019, and developed in \u2018close \ncooperation\u2019 with member states, national experts, the European External Action Service (EEAS), Europol and \nFrontex (EC 2015j). According to one interviewee, CRIs are planned to be continually developed and regularly \nupdated in accordance to the situation on Schengen\u2019s external borders. The CRIs have been rolled out to every \nmember state, along with a handbook and training and awareness-raising developed by Frontex, which has been \ncoordinating the implementation.\n\n The expected advantages of the CRIs is that they help support the work done by national border agencies, \nimprove target checks, and provide further criteria on who is a likely threat (EC 2015k & 2016i). However, criticism \nhas been made on the basis of the criteria used by the CRIs. While these are not known, the possibility of \ndiscriminatory profiling in relation of a traveller\u2019s country of origin or arrival from certain third countries has been \n\n\n\nraised (Bigo et al. 2015; Privot 2016). There has not been an official release from the EC specifically addressing \nconcerns surrounding this tool.\n\n 3. Conclusion\n\n In conclusion, all policy options discussed in this section are directly related to the declared needs of member \nstates as they aim to contribute to improvements in external border management, resulting in improved \nmanagement of migration and threat detection. However, while assessments of measures intended to strengthen \nborder checks suggest possible positive impacts, the effectiveness of the potential ECBG Agency has been \nquestioned on numerous occasions.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 110\n\n III - Police and judicial cooperation\n\n Action in this area could address the following needs arising from the political context surrounding the re-\nintroduction of internal border controls\n\n - Better management of migratory flows crossing the external Schengen border and within the EU.\n\n - Mitigation of terrorist and other security threats.\n\n Policy options in this area\n\n - Improve police and judicial cooperation through (1) closing gaps in the type of information collected, and (2) \nimproving the interoperability of existing information collection systems.\n\n Possible impact of the steps undertaken\n\n - Action in this area would likely have a positive impact as some of the issues encountered in the past that \ncontributed to the current challenges would be resolved with the proposed suite of initiatives. Some limitations may \nstem from the need to consider data protection and privacy needs.\n\n - Action in this area would have a very limited impact on needs linked to the area of asylum, which appears to be \nthe dominant concern.\n\n Given the security-focused nature of member-state concerns discussed in the contextual section of this paper, \nimprovements in cooperation between law-enforcement and judicial authorities represents an area where member \nstates\u2019 needs may be addressed through concerted action at the EU level. This section focuses on options \nsurrounding information sharing and exchange between relevant authorities.\n\n There currently exists a multitude of information databases relevant for border management and law enforcement \nin the European Union and Schengen Area (summarised in Appendix A). While the databases are invaluable tools, \ngaps in their coverage, interoperability and utilisation, along with wider information-sharing practices among law-\nenforcement authorities, represent an area with room for improvement (de la Baume & Paravicini 2015).\n\n\n\n 1. Closing information gaps\n\n According to an EC assessment, current information systems suffer from gaps of information as well as from \nshortcomings in terms of the actual functionalities of the systems (EC 2016g). Suggested remedies consist of \noptimising law-enforcement tools and improving the data collected by the various systems, with a view to \nminimising information gaps. In an effort to close some of these observed gaps in data coverage, the EC \nsuggestions also include the creation of additional information systems. These comprise the Entry-Exit proposal for \nthird-country nationals (discussed in section II.2), the PNR, ETIAS and EPRIS (EC 2016g).\n\n The PNR, approved in April 2016 (Council of the EU 2016a; EC 2016m), is a system by which airlines will have to \nshare passengers\u2019 data with national authorities for \u2018all flights\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 111\n\n from third countries to the EU and vice versa\u2019. In combination with other tools such as SIS and common risk \nindicators (discussed in sections II.4 and III.2), these would track the movement of offenders to help \u2018prevent \ncriminals escaping detection by travelling through another member state\u2019 (EC 2015g). The initial PNR proposal was \nrejected by the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) in April 2013 \ndue to concerns over its \u2018necessity, proportionality, and impact on data protection\u2019 (EC 2016g).142 In December \n2015, the European Parliament and Council of the EU reached an agreement on a revised version of the text \nincorporating additional data protection and privacy safeguards which was subsequently endorsed by the LIBE \ncommittee (EP 2015a). However, the approval of the directive was met with continued concerns voiced by \norganisations such as European Digitals Rights (EDRI) (Naranjo 2015) regarding areas such as data protection, \nretention and access, and discriminatory profiling. 143\n\n The European Police Records Index System (EPRIS) is intended to give member states\u2019 law-enforcement \nauthorities a \u2018quick overview of whether and possibly where relevant police information on a certain person can be \nfound\u2019, a system which would be used in the context of international organised crime or terrorist networks (Council \nof the EU 2009a). The EC will assess its necessity, technical feasibility and proportionality through the help of a \npilot project held in five member states (EC 2016g).\n\n Another option (although not yet formally proposed) is the introduction of the EU Travel Information and \nAuthorisation System (ETIAS), which would register relevant journey information for visa-exempt travellers (Council \nof the EU 2016c). This would be similar to systems established by other countries, such as ETA in Australia, ESTA \n(Electronic System for Travel Authorization) in the United States and eTA in Canada. ETIAS is not intended to be \nused to monitor actual border crossings, but to work alongside the current \u2018smart borders\u2019 proposal.\n\n In the opinion of one interviewee, the development of ETIAS would be a welcome step towards basing travel \nauthorisation and security considerations on personal history and individual information as opposed to on country of \ncitizenship (currently demonstrated by the existence of visa waivers).\n\n 2. Improving interoperability\n\n In addition to expressing the need to expand data coverage, the EC has also highlighted the fact that current \ninformation systems and databases represent a fragmented system in terms of data management for border \ncontrol and security (EC 2016g). Information is rarely interconnected, can be stored in an inconsistent manner \nacross various databases and may be subject to diverging level of access for relevant authorities. In practical \nterms, it can be difficult to know which database should be checked in any given situation, exacerbated by\n\n\n\n 142 See also FRA (2011).\n\n 143 Reflecting on the fact that not all forms of profiling are illegal and discriminatory, one interviewee noted the \nexistence of FRA\u2019s lists of dos and don\u2019ts for police officers as a useful resource. See e.g. FRA (n.d.b & n.d.c).\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 112\n\n the fact that not all member states have access to the same sources.144 In addition, there are varying levels of \nimplementation of the information system across member states, with some information systems not properly \nadopted by certain member states.\n\n This fragmentation is not necessarily an issue in itself and can be viewed as a byproduct of data-protection \nconsiderations in a process in which systems were developed in different institutional, legal, and policy contexts \n(EC 2016g).145 Rather, it is the lack of interoperability that hampers the effectiveness of existing systems. Indeed, \nas one interviewee suggested, EU information systems may be used by some authorities as a secondary tool at \nbest, precisely due to the fact that they are not integrated as well as they might be.\n\n To improve the interoperability of the systems, the EC proposes focusing on four dimensions of interoperability:\n\n 1. having a single search interface that would search several of the information systems at once and combine the \nresults;\n\n 2. data that would be registered would only have to be done so once, unlike the current system;\n\n 3. a shared biometric matching service;\n\n 4. a common repository of data for different information systems (visa applications, entry/exit records, criminal and \npolice records, asylum applications).\n\n To this end, the EC will set up a senior-level Expert Group on Information Systems and Interoperability which will \ninvolve EU agencies, national experts and institutional stakeholders (EC 2016g). The objective of this group will be \nto develop a strategic vision for the overall EU architecture of data management in the domains of border control \nand security, along with proposals for its implementation. At the time of writing, the mode of reporting of this expert \ngroup has not yet been determined.146\n\n 3. Conclusion\n\n In conclusion, initiatives intended to improve the exchange of information between law-enforcement and judicial \nagencies aim to address existing gaps in European security infrastructure. As such, they are likely to contribute to \nmeeting the needs of member states that have arisen during the political debate surrounding the re-introduction of \ninternal borders. At the same time, they are by themselves unlikely to have a considerable impact on challenges \nassociated with recent migratory flows and related legislation and institutional capacity.\n\n 144 This consideration includes EU countries whose participation in various aspects of Schengen is optional \n(Denmark, UK, Ireland) along with Schengen countries which are not members of the EU.\n\n\n\n 145 This point was echoed by an interviewee who stressed that tying all systems together would not be desirable \nfrom a data-protection perspective.\n\n 146 A group of PPE MEPs raised a parliamentary question to that effect on 3 May. An answer is not available (EP \n2016d).\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 113\n\n IV - Asylum and migration\n\n Action in this area could address the following needs arising from the political context surrounding the re-\nintroduction of internal border controls\n\n - Better management of migratory flows resulting from deficiencies in the EU asylum law and its implementation.\n\n Policy options in this area\n\n - Reform the Dublin system.\n\n - Improve the EU return policy.\n\n - Strengthen collaboration on managing irregular migration with transit countries and countries of origins.\n\n Possible impact of steps undertaken\n\n - Proposed and undertaken steps are likely to result in the decrease of pressure on the system in the form of fewer \nnew arrivals.\n\n - Concerns persist over legality, feasibility and the impact on human rights of some policy options.\n\n - Deficiencies in inter-member state solidarity are not likely to be addressed substantially.\n\n As shown by the mention of uncontrolled migratory flows in member states\u2019 notifications re-introducing internal \nborder controls, a reform of the EU\u2019s asylum system may represent one way of addressing member states\u2019 needs \nin the current crisis. This need to reform the EU\u2019s asylum acquis, both as a solution to the current crisis and as a \ngoal in its own right, has also been voiced by numerous commentators (see for example Bertoncini & Vitorino 2016; \nCarrera & den Hertog 2016; Carrera & Guild 2015; Peers 2015a).\n\n Accordingly, this section discusses areas of possible action pertaining to the EU\u2019s asylum and migration law. It \nfocuses on efforts to reform the Dublin system but also takes note of other related measures. However, we precede \nthe discussion of policy options by reiterating that there are gaps in the implementation of existing acquis in the \narea of asylum and migration. The communication on the state of play in the implementation of actions under the \nEU Agenda on Migration (EC 2016f) examined the implementation of the following six measures:\n\n - Asylum Procedures Directive 2013/32/EU\n\n - Reception Conditions Directive 2013/33/EU\n\n\n\n - Qualifications Directive 2011/95/EU\n\n - Directive 2011/51/EU (Long-term residents)\n\n - EURODAC Regulation EU/603/2013\n\n - Return Directive 2008/115/EC\n\n The communication noted that between September 2015 and February 2016 the Commission took 58 decisions to \nsend either a letter of formal notice or a reasoned opinion to a member state deemed in possible breach of its \nobligations. Only Finland and\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 114\n\n Slovakia147 were not recipients of either type of communication, suggesting that gaps in the implementation of \nrelevant EU law are widespread, although this overview does not provide an indication of the scope of the \ndeficiencies in question.\n\n 1. Dublin reform\n\n In April 2016, the EC proposed a reform of EU asylum law consisting of three pillars. First, the EC proposed the \ntransformation of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) into a new EU Asylum Agency, tasked with a \ngreater coordinating role amongst relevant national organisations and with assessing conditions in third countries to \ninform as to the admissibility of incoming asylum requests (EC 2016p). Secondly, the EC proposed a revision of the \nEurodac Regulation, increasing the volume of data collected, the length of their retention and their possible sharing \nwith third countries. Thirdly, the package proposed an amendment to the Dublin Regulation which would prioritise \nthe consideration of an application\u2019s admissibility, severely limit benefits to asylum seekers in the event of their \nsecondary movements, and introduce objective criteria for when asylum seekers should be relocated as a solidarity \nmeasure among member states (EC 2016q).\n\n The proposal raises a series of questions surrounding its legality, feasibility and objectives. Firstly, several \nprovisions of the proposals may be in violation of the EU Charter and/or previous CJEU rulings (Peers 2016b).148 \nIn addition, the proposals raise a host of concerns relating to data protection stemming from the envisaged \nincreases in the volume of data collected and stored, in the number of people about whom data would be collected, \nand in the number of parties the data would be shared with (including, under certain circumstances, non-EU \nentities). The provisions prioritising considerations about the admissibility of asylum applications also appear to \nbuild on the recent controversial EU\u2013Turkey Joint Action Plan (see section IV.2).\n\n Secondly, it is questionable as to what extent some elements of the asylum package are politically feasible. This \nobservation pertains particularly to the proposed corrective relocation mechanism which represents a new attempt \nat introducing some form of sharing among member states. However, it is not clear why those member states, \nwhich had been steadfastly opposed to previous relocation proposals, should want to accept this latest version. In \nthis context, it is also worth consider acceptability of the scheme to asylum seekers and recalling critical \nassessments of the current relocation scheme set up in September 2015 as they continue to be applicable to the \ndebate surrounding this latest proposal. Both Carrera & Guild (2015) and Peers (2015b) pointed out that the system \npaid little attention to the preferences of asylum seekers themselves with respect to their country of destination.\n\n\n\n 147 Not counting Denmark, Ireland and the UK, for which the analysis is applicable only in the case of the Eurodac \nDirective.\n\n 148 This applies particularly to the prioritisation of considerations of admissibility and to several provisions \nconcerning the prevention of secondary movements, which are problematic from the perspective of, among other \nareas, rights of the child, human dignity, right to an effective remedy, right to access an asylum procedure, and non-\nrefoulement.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 115\n\n The proposed relocation mechanism is intended to relieve some pressure on selected border countries, assuming \nits feasibility. However, its impact would be limited in that member states would not be allowed to relocate \ninadmissible cases and so the judgment of admissibility would still rest with the first EU country (Peers 2016b). \nLastly, as one interviewee pointed out, although its name might suggest otherwise, the proposed EU Asylum \nAgency would fall short of an EU decision-making body. As such, while the responsibilities of the new agency would \nbe increased compared to those of the EASO, the role of national authorities in the asylum-processing system \nwould remain largely unchanged, along with its associated challenges. Primary among these remains the issue of \nhow responsibilities and costs are distributed among member states.\n\n 2. Related policy areas\n\n 2.1 Return\n\n The effectiveness of the EU\u2019s asylum policy is related to the effectiveness of returns. In setting out the EU\u2019s \nAgenda on Migration, the EC acknowledged that the EU\u2019s return policy was working \u2018imperfectly\u2019 (EC 2015e) and \nsubsequently published an \u2018EU Action Plan on return\u2019 in September 2015. This action plan outlined measures \naimed at rendering the EU return system more effective and was accompanied by a \u2018Return Handbook\u2019 with \nguidelines and best practices for the execution of return procedures (EC 2015d). The actual policy steps to \nimplement the action plan overlap to a considerable degree with other policy areas discussed elsewhere in the \nreport (see Table AE.1 in Appendix E). One relevant area not previously discussed in this report is policies targeting \nthird countries and their nationals. This topic is briefly discussed below.\n\n 2.2 Initiatives targeting third countries and their nationals\n\n EU-Turkey Joint Action Plan\n\n One possible way of relieving migratory pressures faced by EU border member states is to better manage \nmigratory flows and discourage them in the first place through cooperation mechanisms with third countries and \ncommunication efforts targeting third-country nationals. A landmark effort in this area is the EU\u2013Turkey Joint Action \nPlan, activated in November 2015 (Council of the EU 2015e; EC 2016u). According to provisions agreed in March, \nirregular migrants travelling from Turkey to Greece will be returned to Turkey. Those arriving in Greece will be \nprocessed according to EU Asylum Law, for the purposes of which Turkey is considered a safe country. To \ncompensate for the returns to Turkey, a 1:1 scheme was introduced whereby for one Syrian national returned to \nTurkey, another Syrian will be resettled from Turkey to the EU. Turkey also agreed to take steps to fight illegal \nmigration from Turkey to the EU. In return, the EU agreed to provide up to \u20ac6bn for the Facility for Refugees in \nTurkey, to reopen selected chapters in the EU\u2013Turkey accession process, and to liberalise the visa regime for \nTurkey citizens.\n\n\n\n The implementation of the EU\u2013Turkey Joint Action Plan had a clear short-term impact, driving down the number of \nmigrants coming into Greece (Reuters 2016). At the same time the agreement has been viewed as highly \ncontroversial (Barigazzi 2016), primarily because\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 116\n\n it considers Turkey a \u2018safe\u2019 country, an assertion which has been challenged by numerous observers (Amnesty \nInternational 2016a & 2016b; Frelick 2016; Peers & Roman 2016; Roman, Baird, & Radcliffe, 2016; Ulusoy 2016) \nand even in multiple instances by a Greek court (EDAL 2016). Related to the implementation of the deal with \nTurkey, several international organisations, including the UNHCR (Fleming 2016), M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF \n2016b) and Oxfam (Oxfam 2016) have expressed concerns about conditions in Greek hotspots and their use as \ndetention centres as part of a system of forced migrants and asylum seekers. In protest, these organisations \ndecided to suspend some of their activities supporting the hotspots (EurActiv 2016) while M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res \nannounced that it would discontinue accepting EU funds in protest at the EU\u2013Turkey deal (MSF 2016a).\n\n In addition to human rights concerns, the EU\u2013Turkey deal faces several potential practical risks to its effectiveness. \nFirst, the visa-free regime for Turkey citizens is yet to be approved (Al-Jazeera 2016) and a failure to do so may \nremove a key building block of the agreement. Second, several authors (e.g. Barigazzi 2016; Shuster 2016) pointed \nout that the impact of the deal depends to a considerable degree on Turkey\u2019s ability and, perhaps more importantly, \nwillingness to implement its part of the agreement.\n\n Furthermore, the agreement addresses the situation only in the Aegean Sea. As one interviewed expert suggested, \nit is likely that this deal, all else being equal, will result in a diversion of main migrant flows towards the central \nMediterranean route, resulting in pressure on Lampedusa and southern Italy in general. Consequently, a solution \nsimilar to the EU\u2013Turkey deal which would be applicable in this region would require a deal with North African \ncountries such as Libya, which may be even more problematic.149\n\n Other mechanisms targeting third countries\n\n In addition to the EU\u2013Turkey deal, the European Union has put in place or is working on agreements with other \ncountries to readmit their nationals who were not allowed to stay in the EU. In October 2015, the Council of the EU \ncalled on the EC and the EEAS to develop \u2018tailor-made packages\u2019 to incentivise and leverage individual third \ncountries with a view to supporting and encouraging better implementation of readmission arrangements (Council of \nthe EU 2015a). Concurrently, in November 2015, the Council of the EU approved the creation of European \nMigration Liaison Officers (EMLOs) to be seconded to EU delegations in key third countries with the aim of \nimproving the engagement of third countries in migration issues and of enhancing EU\u2019s migration action in those \ncountries (Council of the EU 2015d). As of March 2016, the first series of EMLO vacancies was being advertised for \nposting in Ethiopia, Niger, Pakistan and Serbia (UK Parliament 2016). Return, readmission, and reintegration with \nspecific respect to Sub-Saharan Africa was one of five major areas covered by the Valetta Migration Action Plan \nagreed by the Council of the EU in November 2015 (Council of the EU 2015m).\n\n However, despite increasing attention, the European Agenda on Migration progress report noted in February 2016 \nthat readmission rates remained low (EC 2016e). Therefore, continued focus on concluding readmission \nagreements (e.g. with Algeria and Morocco)\n\n 149 Peers (2016b) calls any possible deal with Libya \u2018heinous\u2019.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n\n\n PE 581.387 117\n\n or at ensuring their effective implementation (e.g. with Pakistan and Sub-Saharan Africa) remains a necessity. \nTherefore, while in principle greater cooperation with third countries is likely to have a positive impact, this has not \nyet materialised.\n\n 3. Conclusion\n\n In conclusion, the policy of reducing the number of arrivals, as exemplified Joint Action Plan with Turkey, is likely to \ndecrease pressure on the EU\u2019s asylum system, at least in the short run, thereby addressing member states\u2019 needs \nand priorities with respect to the management of migratory flows in Europe. The proposed reform of the Dublin \nsystem may further develop the legal underpinnings of this policy. However, the steps necessary to achieve this \ngoal have given rise to substantial concerns about their legality, feasibility and respect for human rights. In addition, \nthe current set of proposals does not appear able to address deficiencies in solidarity among member states, which \nin turn raises questions about the extent to which the lack of trust among member states is being addressed.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 118\n\n CHAPTER 4 \u2013 REPORT SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\n This study has sought to quantify the economic, social and political costs of the re-introduction of border controls \nin the Schengen Area and to identify areas where more concerted action at the EU level may yield benefits.\n\n The focus of the study was on civil liberties and home affairs aspects relevant to the LIBE Committee of the \nEuropean Parliament. The research team employed a mix of quantitative (cost-estimation and econometric \nmodelling) and qualitative (review of relevant documents and interviews with seven stakeholders) methods. The \nfindings of the study are summarised below.\n\n I - The costs of non-Schengen\n\n The study builds on existing evidence on the costs of non-Schengen which looked at the potential economic costs \nof re-establishing internal border controls within the Schengen Area. The majority of these studies calculate the \ncosts to the EU economy with regard to reductions in trade and waiting times at border crossings.\n\n Using a bottom-up cost-estimation approach this study estimates what it would cost the Schengen states to rebuild \ntheir borders, both in terms of physically rebuilding border crossing points and in terms of annual operating and \nmaintenance costs. Under three scenarios, which differ in assumptions made about the length and scope of the re-\nestablishment of border controls, our estimates suggest that reversing Schengen from a border-free zone to one \nwith border controls could cost the current Schengen states around \u20ac0.1\u201319bn in fixed costs and around \u20ac2\u20134bn in \nannual operating costs. The former corresponds to around 0.01\u20130.16 per cent and the latter to around 0.02\u20130.03 \nper cent of the GDP of the current Schengen Area.\n\n In addition, the findings suggest that abolishing border controls has not led to increasing levels of crime and \ndecreasing levels of self-reported feelings of security among European citizens. In fact, our empirical findings \nsuggest that Schengen membership may be associated with lower levels of acquisitive crime and better supply-\nreduction efforts with regard to illicit drug trafficking. However, it is important to note that these empirical findings \n\n\n\nneed to be interpreted as associations only and cannot be read as causal effects of Schengen. Moreover, due to a \nlack of quantitative data this study has not empirically investigated links between Schengen and border-free travel \nzones and other types of organised crime such as human trafficking.\n\n Trust in national and European institutions and trust among member states is seen as an important tool in the \nworking of the Schengen governance framework. For the former our study finds positive associations with \nSchengen. We observe increasing levels of trust in Eastern European member states that entered the Schengen \nArea in 2007, as well as for Western Schengen states that were members of Schengen before the 2007 \nenlargement. While it is difficult to express increased levels of trust and decreased levels of crime in\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 119\n\n monetary terms, these costs should be considered as potential opportunity costs in light of the re-establishments of \nborder controls.\n\n II - Are there potential benefits of more concerted action at EU level within the current Schengen governance \nframework or by external factors?\n\n In light of this identification and, where possible, quantification of the costs of non-Schengen, this study discussed \na series of possible steps which could be taken to help return the Schengen Area to its full functioning and thus \nmitigate the potential costs outlined above.\n\n With respect to the Schengen governance framework, our analysis found that current arrangements are largely fit \nfor purpose. There are areas where further steps can be made (and are underway), such as continuing to improve \nmember states\u2019 utilisation of and participation in the Schengen evaluation mechanism and the Schengen \nInformation System. However, taking into account the current political context, marked by breakdowns in trust and \ndeficiencies in solidarity among member states, action in this area alone is unlikely to address the fundamental \nneeds and concerns of member states that have led them to re-introduce internal border controls. To achieve this \ngoal, steps in other areas may need to be considered, namely in the domains of external border control, police and \njudicial cooperation, and asylum and migration acquis.\n\n With respect to external border control, institutional capacity may be increased with the establishment of the \nEuropean Border and Coast Guard Agency, although the current proposal does not remove challenges stemming \nfrom reliance on member-state resources. Greater effectiveness of border checks can be achieved through \ninitiatives such as systematic checks on EU nationals, the Entry\u2013Exit System and the use of common risk \nindicators.\n\n Existing police and judicial cooperation arrangements would also benefit from improvements in information \ncollection and sharing across agencies and member states. In this regard, two areas for improvement are closing \nexisting data gaps and bringing about greater interoperability of existing (and any new) information systems. \nHowever, action in these two areas may have only limited impact on the immediate needs of member states that \nhave led to the reintroduction of internal border controls.\n\n\n\n Lastly, action in the area of migration, asylum and external relations may also result in benefits for the Schengen \nsystem by addressing underlying member states\u2019 concerns, namely the arrival and subsequent unmanaged \nsecondary movements of migrants. This appears to be the case with the currently pursued policy of reducing the \nnumber of irregular arrivals, to which a series of recent policy proposals may provide a more developed legal basis. \nHowever, this approach leaves a series of major fundamental right concerns unaddressed. In addition, as with the \nEBCG proposal, it does not appear to have large potential to address questions around solidarity and the reliance \non a small number of member states to provide an EU-wide public good.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 120\n\n III - Implications\n\n The Schengen Agreement, long considered one of the major achievements of the European Union, has come \nunder considerable pressure during the current refugee crisis in Europe. Several member states have felt the need \nto re-introduce controls along their internal controls, thereby placing limits on internal border-free movement. \nSeveral studies have linked suspensions of Schengen to considerable macroeconomic costs, and in this study we \nfurther highlight the fact that suspensions of Schengen have substantial direct budgetary costs for the EU and its \nmember states. In addition, other opportunity costs associated with possible breakdowns of the Schengen system \ninclude crime, security and trust. Reflecting the fact that Schengen is one of the components of the EU\u2019s Area of \nFreedom, Security and Justice, our analyses showed that Schengen membership is not associated with any \nincreases in crime and may even be associated with decreased crime trends in border regions compared to non-\nborder regions of individual member states. Furthermore, Schengen membership appears to be associated with \nimproved outcomes in terms of illicit drug seizures, a finding which is further corroborated when considering purity-\nadjusted prices. In terms of other social costs, Schengen membership appears to be positively associated with a \nrange of measurements of trust.\n\n In light of these findings, it seems plausible that, in addition to direct budgetary costs, suspensions of Schengen \nmay result in a range of social and political costs. This report examined a range of policy options for action at the \nEU level which may help restore Schengen to its full functioning and therefore mitigate the aforementioned and \nother costs. Our analysis found that the Schengen governance framework itself is broadly fit for purpose, although \naction in other areas may be necessary. This observation is in line with the needs and objectives of member states \ndeclared in connection with the re-introduction of internal border controls, which revolved around the areas of \nexternal border control, police and judicial cooperation, and migration and asylum acquis.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 121\n\n CHAPTER 5 REFERENCES\n\n Ademmer, Esther, Barsbai, Toman, L\u00fccke, Matthias, & St\u00f6hr, Tobias.

Distribution of land border crossing points\n\n To confirm findings of the European Commission (2016b) that approximately 7 per cent of internal Schengen \nborder crossing points are large, processing about 70 per cent of all passengers, we conducted a detailed analysis \nof the Austrian border. Austria is conveniently located in the centre of Europe and has substantial lowland and \nmountainous borders, to provide a rough estimate on the distribution of different types of borders. Using a detailed \nmap, we determined 289 individual Austrian border crossing points (i.e. places where a permanent road connected \non both sides of the border to further main communications crosses the state border) and established, based on \ntheir location (particularly type of road, proximity of large cities, or being on a major trans-European travel paths), \ninto which size category they belong (small/medium/large).\n\n As a rule of thumb, large crossing points are located on motorways and other main roads in areas with substantial \nroad traffic, medium crossing points are on secondary roads in high traffic zones or on main roads in less traffic-\nintensive areas, and small crossing points are mainly on local roads in sparsely populated areas. The \u2018small\u2019 \ncategory also contains local border traffic and tourist crossing points such as the former pedestrian-only border \ncrossing points on the Czech-Polish mountainous border.\n\n For instance, the border crossing point on highways A1/8 (Austria/Germany) and 155/304 are both considered \nlarge border crossings as they lie in close proximity to Salzburg and are on a major east-west traffic route. \nSimilarly, the border crossing point on highway 148/12 is considered large as it is on the same route, but the \nnearby crossing between Braunau am Inn and Simbach am Inn is only considered a medium point as it is off the \nmain highway, while still being on the east-west route. The same reasoning applies for the crossing at 1/21, which \nis just off the main highway. Finally, e.g. the border crossing point between H\u00f6rschlag and \u010cesk\u00fd Her\u0161l\u00e1k is \nconsidered small as it is located on a local road, not near any large city or major traffic route. The aforementioned \ncrossing points are shown in Figures AB.1 to AB.3. Since it is impossible to distinguish a small border crossing \npoint from a local border traffic or a tourist crossing point, all of those were put in the \u2018small\u2019 category and we \nfurther rely on the official documentation to provide detailed distinction used in the cost analysis.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 135\n\n Figure AB.1: Large border crossing point on highway A1/8 (Austria/Germany)\n\n Source: \u2018Highway A1, Austria.\u2019 Map.

Number of border crossing points\n\n To obtain a full dataset of internal Schengen border crossing points, we first started with the European Parliament \nregulation152 and the recent reports from Austria and France153 to create a basis of all known land, air, and \nmaritime crossing points. Unlike air and maritime borders which are known in full and will not change, the list of \nknown land border crossing points is patchy with no information on borders between countries that joined \nSchengen before 2007 (except for Austria and France) such as Netherlands, Denmark, or the whole Scandinavia. A \npart of the dataset is shown in Table AB.2.\n\n Table AB.2: Dataset of borders, their length (in km) and number of known border crossing points Country \nNeighbouring Country Border characteristic Border length Standard land BCP Local b. t.

Specifically, we complemented the information on all known land border outposts by border \nlengths, type of terrain (lowlands, highlands, mountains) and controls for natural borders (particularly rivers which \ndecrease the number of crossing points per 100 km), and determined what would the number of crossing points \nbetween any two Schengen countries be based on existing observations,\n\n\n\n 152 List of border crossing points referred to in Article 2(8) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European \nParliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the \nmovement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code).\n\n 153 Note from Austrian delegation to Working Party on Frontiers/Mixed Committee no. 14211/15 from 18 \nNovember 2015 and Note from French delegation to Working Party on Frontiers/Mixed Committee no. 15181/15 \nfrom 10 December 2015.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 138\n\n given the length of their mutual border, its specifications, and the average number of crossing points per 100 km \nfor such type of border. For instance, the Belgian-Dutch or Dutch-German borders are in many ways similar to the \nFrench-Belgian border and it is therefore reasonable to expect that the number of border crossing points per 100 \nkm would not be substantially different one border from another. A snapshot of the final dataset is shown in Table \nAB.3.\n\n Table AB.3: Dataset of borders, their length (in km) and number of known border crossing points Country \nNeighbouring Country Border characteristic Border length Standard BCP Local b. t.

Cost of border protection\n\n As described in chapter 2, we use Finnish,154 Latvian,155 and Swiss156 data to estimate the operating costs of \nprotecting land borders in Europe, with the number of border crossing points serving as a common denominator \nused for extrapolation to other countries. The Finnish data are conveniently broken down into document checks, \npatrolling, law enforcement, and search and rescue emergency operations while the Latvian and Swiss data are \nonly in a form of a bulk estimate for all border control related activities. On the contrary, the Swiss costs are related \nto existing internal Schengen borders,157 whereas the\n\n 154 Finnish open data service website,            http://budjetti.vm.fi.\n\n 155 Latvian State Border Guard,            www.rs.gov.lv\n\n 156 Swiss Federal Finance Administration,            www.efv.admin.ch\n\nhttp://budjetti.vm.fi/\nhttp://www.rs.gov.lv/\nhttp://www.efv.admin.ch/\n\n\n 157 Switzerland is in Schengen but not in the European Union (and its common trade area) therefore continuing \nborder surveillance operations and maintaining operating border outposts at all its borders. In line with the \nSchengen principles, border force officers at the\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 139\n\n Finnish and Latvian figures to external borders only. As discussed earlier, there is no reason to believe that the \ncosts per border crossing point should be substantially different within one country and we can therefore use the \ncosts to protect external borders to estimate equivalent protection of internal borders. The lists of border crossing \npoints for all respective borders are known from the official documentation.\n\n Unfortunately, the Finnish costs are not directly comparable to the Swiss and Latvian ones. In particular, while we \nwere able to extract only patrolling costs related to the land border with Russia, the 1,340 km long border has only \n10 permanent border crossing points due to very specific location in subarctic climate and sparsely populated land. \nHence, we only use the Finnish data to estimate costs to protect borders in Norway and Sweden, i.e. countries \nessentially similar to Finland in these characteristics. Additionally, we were not able to extract Latvian expenses \nrelated only to the land borders with Belarus and Russia; the Latvian figure thus also contains costs to protect the \nmaritime border at the Baltic sea and we include the 10 officially documented Baltic sea ports among border \ncrossing points used in the calculation. Since the Latvian costs per border crossing point are broadly similar to the \nSwiss figures, we believe the costs are applicable for extrapolation to other countries. Finally, Germany lists \nunexpectedly high number of crossing points on their borders with Switzerland.158 Hence, we slightly reduced the \nnumber of border crossing points to reflect this using a manual analysis of the border.159 Finally, we include main \ninternational airports as documented in the European Parliament report in the total number of border crossing \npoints serving as denominator; nevertheless, only land borders are used for extrapolation to other countries.\n\n Using the approach the estimated costs of maintaining border control are \u20ac1,283,752 per border crossing in \nSwitzerland, \u20ac1,786,187 in Latvia, and \u20ac11,045,924 in Finland (PPP adjusted). Combining the Swiss and Latvian \nestimates we obtain a \u20ac1,534,970 estimate to be applied for all but the Scandinavian countries.\n\n outposts do not perform document checks but may control any passenger as a part of customs duties. We argue \nthat since document checks at land borders constitute just a small proportion of the total costs, the difference in \nprocesses does not have a significant impact on our analysis.\n\n 158 This is particularly due to specific typology of the border and approach to cross-border traffic between these \ncountries; unlike in other countries where any two cities practically resembling one split by a country border are \ndivided along the border and connected only at certain points to allow integrated border control, cities along the \nGerman-Swiss are generally connected by any street that crosses the border. For instance, Konstanz, a university \ncity with approximately 80,000 inhabitants and a land border of only 2.6km with Switzerland has 7 official border \ncrossing points.\n\n 159 Such reduction is in line with the recent re-introduction of border controls in France; although there are over \none hundred roads of any type connecting France and Belgium, the French government only re-introduced 18 \nborder crossing points.\n\n\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 140\n\n 4. Alternative cost modelling using passenger flows\n\n One issue with cost modelling using border crossing points is that it cannot be used to approximate costs related \nto higher passenger flows through air and maritime borders alone. In particular, Greece, Iceland, and Malta do not \nhave any land borders and Denmark with Estonia have far greater amount of passengers travelling using maritime \nthan air transport so their increased costs of processing more passengers are not appropriately reflected in the \nmain analysis.160 Hence, we calculate the costs of protecting borders using an alternative approach based on a \ncost per passenger obtained from the UK, suggesting that each passenger costs \u00a32.8 (\u20ac3.61).161 This figure is \nexcluding patrolling costs which is in line to no new patrolling costs occurring in Greece, Iceland, and Malta should \nthe Schengen Agreement be abolished. To obtain country cost estimates, we simply multiply the per-passenger \ncost (adjusted for PPP differences) by the total number of passengers travelling through air and maritime transport \nwithin the Schengen Area obtained from Eurostat as described in chapter 2.\n\n 5. Fixed costs of extending air and maritime border control\n\n Table AB.4: Air and maritime border equipment costs Equipment Estimated unit cost Estimated cost per airport \nEstimated cost per port Large Small Large Small Computera \u20ac 2,000 \u20ac24,000- \u20ac70,000 \u20ac4,000 \u20ac14,000-\u20ac40,000 \n\u20ac4,000\n\n 160 The overall expenditure data used in our analysis include costs of document and luggage checks at the air and \nmaritime borders as well as their protection so the extrapolation to other borders/countries implicitly contains all \nrelevant expenditure categories, providing reliable estimates for countries with the ratio of internal Schengen land \nborders to other borders roughly corresponding to the projected increase in air and maritime transport to be \nchecked. This is true for all countries except for Denmark and Estonia because the number of airports is highly \ncorrelated with the length of country borders so extrapolation using border crossing points inherently includes \ncosts of higher air passenger flows as well. However, countries with high amount of maritime transport would have \ntheir costs understated using this approach. Scandinavian countries (Finland, Norway, and Sweden) form a \nseparate category in this regard as their cost estimates are calculated using the Finnish data.\n\n 161 UK Border Force agency. The data were calculated using a full-cost allocation model, assuming total related \ncosts of \u00a3332m and 118.4 million passengers. According to the UK Border Force officials, the calculation includes \nHome Office headquarters overheads and omits costs allocated to seizures and patrolling. Moreover, the UK Visas \n& Immigration spending is excluded from the numbers. Exclusion of patrolling costs prevents a direct comparison of \nthe results to the main scenario since these would be underestimated but is necessary for the Greek, Maltian, and \nIcelandian data to be correct since these countries would not introduce any new border surveillance in case the \ninternal borders controls would be re-introduced.\n\n The Cost of Non-Schengen: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aspects\n\n PE 581.387 141\n\n\n\n Passport scannera \u20ac 1,200 \u20ac14,000-\u20ac42,000 \u20ac2,400 \u20ac8,400-\u20ac24,000 \u20ac2,400 Fingerprints readerb \u20ac 4,000 \u20ac48,000-\n\u20ac140,000 \u20ac8,000 \u20ac28,000-\u20ac80,000 \u20ac8,000 Facial image scannerb \u20ac 500 \u20ac6,000-\u20ac21,000 \u20ac1,000 \u20ac3,500-\u20ac10,000 \n\u20ac1,000\n\n a Source: Online search b Source: Council of the European Union (2009)\n\n APPENDIX C \u2013 SOCIAL COSTS: CRIME AND SECURITY\n\n Table AC.1 and AC.2 report the findings from estimating equation (1) using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) \nregressions. Columns (1) to (3) in Table AC.1 include the findings for comparing existing Schengen states with \ndirect borders to the new member states from the 2007 enlargement with existing Schengen states with no direct \nborders. The parameter estimates confirm the trends depicted in figure 2.2 - there seems to be an overall decline \nin acquisitive crimes in both border and non-border existing Schengen states in the period after 2008. The \nparameter estimate for \u00f0 \u2018\u017d\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1\u00f0 \u2018\u2019\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1 indicates that on average acquisitive crime in countries with no direct \nborders to newly acceding Schengen states has decreased on average by around 7 per cent after 2008. In \naddition, the parameter estimate for the interaction term (\u00f0 \u2018\u017d\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1\u00f0 \u2018\u2019\u00f0 \u2018&lowast;\u00f0 \u2018\u201d\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u0153\u00f0 \u2018\u00a2\u00f0 \u2018 )\u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1 means \nthat on average acquisitive crime decreased by 20 per cent for existing Schengen with direct borders to the newly \nacceding Schengen states. Interestingly, similar trends are observable using victimisation data from the ESS \n(column 3). The interaction term parameter estimates measures that the self-reported probability of being a victim of \nburglary or robbery has decreased by around 1.64 percentage points. For homicides we observe a slightly stronger \ndecline in existing non-border Schengen states than for border states, but none of the parameter estimates is \nstatistically significantly different from zero.\n\n Columns (1) to (3) in Table AC.2 include the findings when comparing the newly acceding Schengen states from \nthe 2007 enlargement with non-Schengen states in the same regon. Again, the parameter estimates mainly confirm \nthe trends depicted in figure 2.3. However, none of the estimates for police reported crime is statistically \nsignificantly different from zero, whereas the estimates using victimisation data from the ESS suggest that self-\nreported acquisitive crimes have decreased after 2008 on average, by almost 9 percentage points in the newly \nacceding Schengen states.\n\n Cost of Non-Europe Report\n\n PE 581.387 142\n\n Table AC.1: Cross-country trends in acquisitive crime and homicide rates 2003\u20132014 \u2013 Existing Schengen states\n\n (1)\n\n (2)\n\n (3)\n\n (4)\n\n estimation method:\n\n OLS\n\n\n\n sample:\n\n Existing Schengen states\n\n data source:\n\n Police reported (UNODC)\n\n Victimisation (ESS)\n\n crime:\n\n acquisitive crime\n\n homicide\n\n acquisitive crime\n\n feeling secure\n\n level:\n\n country\n\n individual\n\n \u00f0 \u2018\u017d\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1\u00f0 \u2018\u2019\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1\n\n -0.0787\n\n -0.1386\n\n -0.0031\n\n 0.0006\n\n (0.091)\n\n (0.387)\n\n (0.001)**\n\n (0.002)\n\n\n\n \u00f0 \u2018\u201d\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u0153\u00f0 \u2018\u00a2\u00f0 \u2018 \u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1\n\n -0.9845\n\n -1.6671\n\n 0.0608\n\n 0.1132\n\n (0.497)**\n\n (1.568)\n\n (0.003)***\n\n (0.003)***\n\n (\u00f0 \u2018\u017d\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1\u00f0 \u2018\u2019\u00f0 \u2018&lowast;\u00f0 \u2018\u201d\u00f0 \u2018\u00f0 \u2018\u0153\u00f0 \u2018\u00a2\u00f0 \u2018 )\u00f0 \u2018\u2022\u00f0 \u2018\u00a1\n\n -0.2016\n\n 0.0369\n\n -0.0164\n\n 0.0235\n\n (0.073)***\n\n (0.259)\n\n (0.001)***\n\n (0.002)***\n\n Constant\n\n 26.5201\n\n 39.2901\n\n 0.2812\n\n 0.5342\n\n\n\n (7.262)***\n\n (24.921)\n\n (0.012)***\n\n (0.015)***\n\n Observations\n\n 168\n\n 168\n\n 164,907\n\n 165,184\n\n R-squared\n\n 0.9488\n\n 0.4811\n\n 0.1494\n\n 0.1112\n\n Clustered standard errors in parentheses (country); *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.10.
