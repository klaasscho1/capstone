{"title": "Protesters condemn amnesty plan; OPPOSED TO BILL IN SENATE", "body": "\nWaving handwritten signs that proclaimed ``No Amnesty,'' a handful of activists braved a light rain in Fremont on \nFriday evening to protest legislation that would create a process for undocumented immigrants to earn U.S. \ncitizenship.\n\n``I'm not for stopping all immigration. But if we give amnesty to people who came here illegally, we are sending the \nmessage that it's OK to break the law,'' said Dave Sander, a 40-year-old industrial painter who waved an American \nflag at Mowry Avenue and Fremont Boulevard.\n\nSander and about 15 other protesters said they decided to speak out after a week in which President Bush called \nboth for cracking down on illegal border crossings and for creating a legalization process for immigrants already \nhere.\n\nThe U.S. Senate appears close to adopting such a plan, although it must be reconciled with a House of \nRepresentatives bill that would instead make illegal immigration a felony, punished by time in prison.\n\nProtesters said they support the House bill, and were dismayed by Bush's proposal even though the president \ninsisted it was not ``amnesty.'' He called for imposing civil fines while letting undocumented immigrants apply for \ncitizenship behind people who have entered the country legally.\n\nHomemaker Eileen Williams said her husband's roofing company loses business to competing firms that hire \nundocumented workers at lower cost. She said a prison sentence would discourage people from coming to this \ncountry illegally.\n\n``Lawful immigration is OK, but when I see any breach of the law, I get upset,'' said Chetan Hari, a 70-year-old \nengineering technician who came to the United States legally from India in 1996. Now a U.S. citizen, he held a sign \nthat said ``Deport all illegals'' and added: ``The law is what makes this country strong.''\n\nContact Brandon Bailey at bbailey@mercurynews.com or (408) 920-5022.\n"}
