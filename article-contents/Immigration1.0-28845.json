St. Pete Polls called up \n3,283 registered voters[1] across the state and asked whether they were for or against the measure, which would \nban the possession of semi-automatic rifles and shotguns capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition at \nonce. Just over 60 percent said yes, while 34 percent said no, and 6 percent were unsure. \n\nThat puts the measure just over the threshold for passage. Of course, there's plenty of time for that to change, \nassuming the amendment even coughs up the 650,000 petition signatures it needs to go before voters. Voters \nweren't as keen on other amendments being floated for the 2020 ballot. The top-two primary plan, which would \neschew partisan nominating contests and put the two best performers in August on the general election ballot, is \nunderwater. About 38 percent want the change, while 48 percent want to stay the course. A majority of Republicans \nare against the plan, while Democrats and independent voters showed lukewarm support, but neither was in striking \ndistance of the 60 percent threshold. In fact, it fared worse than a ballot initiative that would require voters to \napprove constitutional amendments twice before they could make it into the state's governing document. Just under \nhalf say constitutional amendments should get a double OK while 30 percent disagree, and 21 percent are unsure. \nThe St. Pete Polls survey[2] was conducted Oct. 7 through Oct. 10 with a margin of error of 1.7 percentage points \nat a 95 percent confidence level. \u2014 TODAY'S SUNRISE \u2014 First Lady Casey DeSantis flew on a private jet of a \npolitical contributor to her husband, which is raising some interesting ethics questions \u2014 notably because Mrs. \nDeSantis attended both a Republican Party fundraiser and a health care policy event.

The Governor says this call was \nintentional and would affect '60 percent of teachers.' The average teacher salary in the 2017-2018 school year, \ntopped $48,000, Florida state records show. DeSantis' proposal would raise teachers' starting salary from around \n$37,600 to $47,500. But as the proposal stands right now,it doesn't address what the increase means for longtime \nteachers who already make more than the potential new rate.

'For sale' signs hang in many yards of the houses that remain standing and in the \nempty lots where some have chosen not to rebuild. But there are far more signs that read 'NOT FOR SALE' rising \nfrom the sandy and grassy yards of those who have pledged their allegiance to their 'Mayberry by the Sea' and \nhave vowed to rebuild.

For weeks, Biden spoke cautiously about impeaching the president. But in speeches at two events, \nBiden attacked the president in the sharpest and most personal terms he's used since entering the Democratic \npresidential primary.

'Thanks to self-loan, Jim Bonfiglio \ntops Mike Caruso in September earnings for HD 89[50]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics \u2014 Former Ocean Ridge \nMayor Bonfiglio has added a $20,000 loan to his campaign, enough to ensure he brought in more money than his \n2020 opponent, GOP Rep. Caruso. So far, Caruso has been the better outside fundraiser between the two. But \nBonfiglio added that $20,000 self-loan to $1,000 in outside money, giving him $21,000 in funds added during \nSeptember. Caruso, meanwhile, earned tenfold Bonfiglio's haul in outside money, bringing in just over $10,000. But \nthat leaves him with less than half of Bonfilgio's September haul altogether.

But the newest numbers from September saw the script flipped, though with slightly smaller totals. Still, \nboth candidates earned six figures. Levine Cava raked in $125,000 between her campaign and political committee \nOur Democracy PC. That topped Penelas by about $25,000. His committee, Bold Vision, raised just over $100,000. \n'Day by day our campaign is working tirelessly to hit milestones that we were told were out of reach,' Levine Cava \nsaid in a statement.

History will record their names along with \nTrump's in the annals of ignominy. The President's principal accomplices in his brazen assault on the rule of law are \nVice President Pence, Secretary of State Pompeo, and Attorney General Barr. Pence has adopted the Sergeant \nSchultz defense: I know nothing!
