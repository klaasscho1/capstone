{"title": "ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION; Federal fingerprint plan goes statewide", "body": "\nAll 159 Georgia counties are now participating in a federal fingerprint-sharing program aimed at deporting violent \nillegal immigrants.\n\nOn Tuesday, 116 counties from across the state joined the Secure Communities program, according to U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement's website. Atlanta-area counties have been connected for months.\n\nGeorgia now joins 20 other states in having statewide coverage from the program, including Florida, North Carolina \nand South Carolina. ICE plans to have the program up and running nationwide by 2013.\n\nThe program works by comparing the fingerprints of everyone booked into participating jails with prints held in \nfederal databases to determine whether the inmates are in the country illegally.\n\nFederal immigration officials could seek to deport inmates when matches are found, though they say they are \nprimarily focusing on noncitizens who have committed violent offenses and other serious crimes.\n\nCivil and immigrant rights groups in Georgia have called on the Obama administration to dump the program, \ncomplaining it is distracting police from important crime-fighting duties and tearing families apart. They have also \ndecried how it has resulted in the deportations of many people who have committed no crimes other than being in \nthe country illegally.\n\nOn the other side, local jailers have praised the program, saying it is helping curb illegal immigration in Georgia \nand preventing criminals from deceiving them with aliases.\n\nMore immigration\n\nHouse Speaker David Ralston said he is pleased with state's law.\n"}
