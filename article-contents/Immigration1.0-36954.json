{"title": "METRO DATELINE;Doctor Is Charged With AIDS Fraud", "body": "\nA Hudson County physician concealed a positive AIDS test for an immigrant seeking residency status in exchange \nfor $3,000, the government charged yesterday.\n\nThe doctor, Monir A. Dawoud, told the unidentified immigrant he would be deported if medical tests required by the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service showed the positive test result, a Federal complaint said.\n\nThe complaint was unsealed at a bail hearing for Dr. Monir A. Dawoud, 49 years old, of Jersey City. U.S. Magistrate \nStanley R. Chesler set bail at $50,000 and freed Mr. Dawoud until the end of business Monday, the deadline for the \ndoctor to produce backing for the bail.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Kevin McKenna had asked for $500,000 bail. Mr. Dawoud was charged with making a false \nstatement to the government, and faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted.\n\nMr. Dawoud's lawyer, Vincent Verdiramo, said his client was innocent and declined to comment further.
