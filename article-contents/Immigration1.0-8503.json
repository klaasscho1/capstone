{"title": "UFW'S ARTURO RODRIGUEZ: HOUSE GOP BILL WOULD SLASH FARM WORKER PAY AND REVIVE BRACERO PROGRAM ABUSES", "body": "\nThe following information was released by the United Farm Workers of America (UFW):\n\nSame day Senate panel weighs farm worker amendments to bipartisan 'gang of eight' immigration reform\n\nUnited Farm Workers President Arturo S. Rodriguez will testify at 10 a.m. EST Thursday before a House judiciary \nsubcommittee that a Republican-backed farm worker guest worker bill \"bears much closer resemblance to the \nhorrific [1942-1964] bracero guest worker program than it does to the immigration changes\" needed in the 21st \nCentury.\n\nMeanwhile, also on Thursday the Senate Judiciary Committee considers amendments to the bill known as the \nBorder Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013 (S. 744). The committee is \nexpected to vote on amendments impacting the agricultural provisions of the comprehensive immigration reform \nmeasure that were negotiated earlier this year by the UFW and the nation's major grower associations.\n\nRodriguez will testify before the subcommittee against HR 1773, by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob \nGoodlatte (R-Va.). The UFW president will detail how the House GOP bill would slash pay for both American and \nforeign farm workers; deprive U.S. farm workers of jobs by minimizing the obligation of employers to first recruit \ndomestic workers before seeking foreign field laborers; abandon decades of other agricultural labor law \nprotections for domestic and foreign farm workers established by both political parties in response to the terrible \nabuses of the bracero program from the 1940s to the '60s; and fail to provide a path to either legal status or \ncitizenship for the 1 million undocumented farm workers in the country now who would remain here while hundreds \nof thousands of additional foreign agricultural workers are brought in.\n\n###\n"}
