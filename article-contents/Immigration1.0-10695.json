{"title": "Fox sets immigration reform deadline", "body": "\nPresident Vicente Fox of Mexico, the guest of honor Wednesday at President Bush's first state dinner, sparked \ncontroversy by challenging his host to strike an agreement on immigration reform by the end of the year.\n\nFox, flanked by Bush, made his remarks during a welcoming ceremony with a military honor guard on the South \nLawn of the White House Wednesday morning.\n\nWhile aware of his thinking on the issue, administration officials said Fox did not clear his remarks with the White \nHouse, or with his inner circle of advisers.\n\nBush hailed bilateral relations as a \"relationship of unprecedented closeness and cooperation,\" but he did not \nembrace Fox's lofty deadline.\nFOX-BUSH\n\nThe White House had scripted the day with pomp and circumstance to showcase glowing U.S.-Mexico relations \nunder the Bush administration, and, in the process, to boost the president's standing among Latino voters.\n\nBy the end of the day, however, administration officials were scrambling to contain the political fallout. For weeks \nthey had worked to lower expectations for a deal on the politically volatile issue of immigration.\n\nOnly a day earlier, Bush had said he needed time to work with Congress to build political support for immigration \nreform.\n\nWhite House proposals to grant legal status to millions of illegal Mexican immigrants living in the United States have \nmet with fierce opposition.\n\nMexican government officials say the anti-immigrant backlash in the United States is what prompted Fox to take \nsuch a bold position Wednesday.\n\nThey say it was a deliberate attempt by Fox to put pressure on the administration to reach an agreement on \nMexican migration quickly, instead of years down the road.\n\nIn his speech at the White House, Fox said Mexican immigrants should be recognized for the cultural and economic \ncontributions they have made to the United States.\n\n\"For this reason, we must, and we can, reach an agreement on migration before the end of this very year,\" Fox \nsaid, adding that before his and Bush's terms are over, it should be easier for Mexicans to migrate to the United \nStates legally.\n\n\nFor Fox, challenging Bush in his own back yard - literally - is bound to play well in Mexico. Last July, he made \nhistory by kicking Mexico's notoriously corrupt ruling party out of office after 70 years in power.\n\nDuring his campaign, the former Coca-Cola executive pledged to fight for an open border with the United States \nand for better treatment of illegal Mexican immigrants. A series of roadblocks, however, including an intransigent \nCongress and a hobbled economy, have left his promises largely unfulfilled.\n\nAnd his popularity is sinking.\n\nFor those who know Fox, his stance at the White House wasn't surprising.\n\nKnown for his straight talk, he often got a good laugh on the campaign trail by telling opponents to \"tell it to your \ngrandma.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House wasn't laughing.\n\nCondoleezza Rice, Bush's national security adviser, was bombarded with questions about Fox's remarks at an \nafternoon news briefing.\n\nIs setting a deadline counterproductive?\n\nShe didn't answer.\n\n\"Look,\" Rice said, visibly agitated, \"everybody would be delighted if we could get this done by the end of the year.\"\n\nEarlier at the White House, Attorney General John Ashcroft also was asked for his reaction to Fox's remarks. \nAshcroft and Secretary of State Colin Powell are working on the migration issue with their Mexican counterparts.\n\nAshcroft refused to say whether he knew in advance of the Fox challenge. He said both sides were working to \nreach an agreement \"as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"I cannot forecast an exact time,\" Ashcroft said. \"I can tell you it's a matter of priority.\"\n\nPrivately, administration officials said they would have preferred to avoid the pressure of a public deadline.\n\nBefore Fox took the podium, Bush, who has been courting the Latino vote with an eye toward his re-election in \n2004, showered him with pageantry.\n\nPennsylvania Avenue was decked out in American and Mexican flags.\n\nA military band played.\n\nAnd making the morning just about perfect were a cool breeze, delicious skies and the smell of something good \ncooking in the basement of the West Wing - perhaps the pumpkin seed-crusted bison on the state dinner menu.\n\nBush was effusive in his praise.\n\nAnd he peppered his speech with Spanish.\n\n\"A Mexican proverb tells us that que tiene un buen vecino tiene un buen amigo. He who has a good neighbor has a \ngood friend.\n\n\"Today, both our countries are committed to being good neighbors and good friends. Friends deal in good faith, and \ndisagree with respect. Friends stick together, in good times and in bad.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n\n\n \n\nPHOTO, Associated Press, (2); Laura Bush wears a 'lollypop red' gown and President George W.
