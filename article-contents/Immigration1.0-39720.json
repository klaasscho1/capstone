{"title": "200 Chinese Deportees Caught at U.S. Border", "body": "\nAbout 200 illegal Chinese immigrants who escaped from Mexican custody Friday night were apparently all rounded \nup on both sides of the border today.\n\nThe immigrants, all men, were part of a group of more than 300 detained at the Rodolfo Sanchez Taboada \nInternational Airport in Mexicali. The immigrants escaped Friday night by breaking down a security cordon, \noverwhelming the guards with sheer numbers and running off into the night.\n\nUnited States Border Patrol guards arrested 87 immigrants as they crossed the border into Calexico, said a \nspokesman, Paul Villanueva.\n\nThe remaining Chinese immigrants were believed to have been caught in Mexico or voluntarily returned to the \nairport, Mr. Villanueva said. Mexican officials were unavailable for comment.\n\nThe immigrants will be deported to China unless they request a hearing or receive political asylum, officials said. \nThey were being processed in Calexico and El Centro, Mr. Villanueva said.\n\nMexico's plan to deport the illegal Chinese immigrants was halted Friday after the United States and Canadian \nauthorities refused to let a plane land and refuel.\n\nAn official in Washington, who requested anonymity, said permission was denied because, once the plane landed \non United States soil, the Chinese could request political asylum.\n\nThe American Immigration and Naturalization Service said 12 boats carrying 1,300 Chinese had been intercepted \nin the last 18 months before arriving in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Honolulu and New Bedford, Mass.\n"}
