{"title": "New York Growth is Linked to Immigration", "body": "\nNew York City took in 854,000 immigrants between 1980 and 1989, who fanned out into all five boroughs to feed \ngreat changes in racial and ethnic concentrations, according to data released yesterday by Federal immigration \nofficials and the Census Bureau.\n\n The figures show that the city's rebound in population in the 1980's rode upon waves of immigrants from Asia, the \nCaribbean and Latin America, who more than made up for a continuing loss of whites.\n\nAll this created a much different city, where one out of nine New Yorkers came from another country in the last \ndecade and where whites of European ancestry now account for less than half of the city's population.\n\n Residents identifying themselves as Hispanic grew by 281,797 -- to 1,783,511. Asians more than doubled in \nnumber, growing by 281,218 -- to 512,719.\n\n \n\nDecline in White Population\n\n Asians grew sharply across the country, according to the census, and that pattern held across New York State, \nwhere they grew to 693,760 residents from 310,526 in 1980. More than half live in Brooklyn and Queens, whose \nAsian populations now both outnumber Manhattan's Asian population.\n\n The city's overall population increased by 3.5 percent, to 7,322,564, despite a 10.9 percent decline in whites. The \nnumber of whites, which in the data released yesterday includes several hundred thousand Hispanic residents who \nidentify themselves as white, fell to 3,827,088, from 4,294,075 in 1980.\n\n Similar patterns were seen in New York State, where the overall population increased by 2.5 percent, to \n17,990,455, even though the white population fell by 4.1 percent. There were 13,385,255 whites in the state in \n1990, down from 13,960,868 a decade earlier.\n\n In contrast with the growth in New York City, though, immigration in New York's next largest cities -- Buffalo, \nRochester, Yonkers and Syracuse -- was not enough to prevent overall population declines because of the loss of \nwhites.\n\n\n The new census data confirm trends that have long been noted by demographers and others. \"We've gotten used \nto the fact that New York City is a place where the whiteEuropean population is now less than 50 percent and \nfalling,\" said Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\n\n The data released yesterday elaborated on overall population figures released last month. New York and other \ncities have challenged the data in a lawsuit, on the ground that the Census Bureau failed to count thousands of \nresidents, many of them minorities.\n\n The figures, according to New York officials, are likely to understate the actual minority population. Figures from \nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service show that between 1980 and 1989 New York City took in 854,000 \nimmigrants. This is seen as the principal reason why the city's population grew both in absolute numbers and \ndiversity in the last decade.\n\n Among the various racial and ethnic groups, blacks showed the largest increase: 318,175. The census put the \nnumber of blacks at 2,102,512, up 17.8 percent over the 1,784,337 reported in 1980. Nearly half of the increase -- \n149,493 -- was registered in Brooklyn, which has seen a large influx from the Caribbean.\n\n The most dramatic increases were registered by Asians, whose population was put at 512,719, more than double \nthe 1980 total of 231,501. The largest influx was in Queens, which has become a favorite destination of Chinese \nimmigrants. There were 238,336 Asians in that borough, or 154 percent morethan the 93,780 counted in 1980. The \nAsian population also grew by 159 percent in Brooklyn, 135 percent in the Bronx, 153 percent on Staten Island and \n52 percent in Manhattan.\n\n The data released yesterday showed that whites still constitute 52 percent of New York City's population. But the \nfigure of 3,827,088 whites includes a high percentage of the city's 1,783,511 Hispanic residents.\n\n Demographers thus agree that sometime during the mid-1980's non-Hispanic whites ceased to be a majority of the \ncity's population. Confirmation of this must await the release of further data from the Census Bureau, possibly next \nweek.\n\n \n\nMany Whites Leave City\n\n The proportion of non-Hispanic whites in the city has been declining for several decades, and analysts generally \nagree that the net loss of 466,987 whites over the decade was caused almost entirely by continued migration of this \ngroup.\n\n Manhattan and Staten Island could be exceptions to this trend. The white population of Manhattan, including some \nHispanic residents, grew by 26,023 during the decade, to 867,227, a gain of 3.1 percent. Staten Island added 8,509 \nwhites for a total of 322,043, a gain of 2.7 percent.\n\n The number of Hispanic people in the city increased by 281,797, a gain of 18.8 percent. The largest gain, 126,758, \nwas in the Bronx, which became the only borough in which Hispanic residents now outnumber whites. In 1980 there \nwere 554,046 whites and 396,353 Hispanics in the Bronx. In 1990, the bureau reported, there were 430,077 whites \nand 523,111 Hispanics.\n\n Data for New York State showed that, among the various racial and ethnic groups, Hispanic people accounted for \nthe biggest gains. There were 1,659,300 Hispanic residents in 1980, or 9.5 percent of the overall popultion. By last \nyear this figure had increased by 554,726 to 2,214,026, or 12.3 percent of the total.\n\n \n\nStrong Black Growth\n\n Blacks also showed strong growth in the state, increasing by 457,049. The black population went from 2,402,006, \nor 13.7 percent of the population, in 1980 to 2,859,055, or 15.9 percent of the total, in 1990.\n\n\n\n Asians showed the strongest percentage growth, registering an increase of 123.4 percent. The statewide Asian \npopulation grew from 310,526, or 1.8 percent of the total, in 1980 to 693,760, or 3.9 percent, in 1990.\n\n Suburban counties showed what is also becoming a pattern throughout the metropolitan area: stagnation of the \nwhite population and an increase in the number of residents from racial and ethnic minorities.\n\n Nassau and Westchester Counties, for example, both registered overall declines in population because of loss of \nwhites. In Nassau the white population dropped by 7.4 percent, to 1,115,119, while in Westchester the number of \nwhites declined by 4.9 percent, to 694,308.\n\n Ms. Scanlon of the Port Authority said that the decline in white population in such suburbs was largely a result of \ndeclining family size. \"There's a lot of empty nesting in those areas,\" she said.\n\n Suffolk County, which has a somewhat younger overall population, was something of an exception to this trend.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nGraphs: \"New York City's Decade of Change\" shows percentage of New York City's population in 1980 and 1990, \nfrom the Census Bureau (pg.
