{"title": "TEACHER FREED FROM JAIL BUT MUST LEAVE U.S. IN MONTH", "body": "\nYana Slobodova came home from jail Tuesday night, but it is a bittersweet and temporary reprieve.\n\nThe Russian piano teacher was detained and had been held in an Oakland jail for nearly three weeks because she \nwas living in the United States without authorization. Slobodova could have been deported without the chance to \nsay goodbye to her 20-month-old son, Nikita, and her husband, Alexander Makarchuk. But in order to gain freedom \nfor 30 days, Slobodova promised immigration officials she would not appeal her case any further and to leave the \nUnited States by Feb. 27.\n\n\"I'm just happy to be out, to tell you the truth,\" said Slobodova, who arrived in the country in 1996 with improper \npapers. \"I'm probably going to be shocked later, upset later, but for now I'm just happy to see my baby and my \nhusband.\"\n\nMakarchuk, a U.S. citizen, is still seething. \"I feel mad at the government because they made her sign away her \nrights\" to keep appealing her case. If Slobodova had not agreed to the conditions of her release, she might have \nbeen deported to Russia without seeing her family.\n\nWhile a direct appeal to immigration officials is off the table, Makarchuk said the family will try asking for help from \nvarious branches of the federal government: California's congressional delegation, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and Vice President Dick Cheney.\n\nSlobodova, who lives in San Francisco, is from St. Petersburg, Russia. In 1996, while she was single, she entered \nthe United States with documentation stating that she was the wife of a U.S. citizen. Slobodova has since admitted \nto misrepresenting herself to immigration officials, but she and her husband contend that she was also the victim of \nfraudulent immigration consultants who gave her the wrong paperwork. Slobodova said she paid $10,000 to \nimmigration consultants, who convinced her she could gain permanent residency based on her extraordinary \nmusical ability.\n\nUpon arriving in the United States, Slobodova began a lengthy process of seeking asylum. She married \nMakarchuk, a naturalized citizen, in 1999. Her parents successfully sought refugee status as Russian Jews and \nnow live in San Mateo. They helped post Slobodova's $10,000 bond from jail this week.\n\nThe much-beloved teacher taught private piano lessons at a performing arts school in San Francisco and at the \nCommunity School of Music and Arts in Mountain View. Dozens of students, parents and friends have written letters \nto immigration officials attesting to Slobodova's character and the hardship to her family that her deportation would \ncause.\n\nMakarchuk has no plans to move to Russia. He hopes to find a cheaper apartment for himself and Nikita, and \nSlobodova is looking up acquaintances in St. Petersburg, where she earned a master's degree at a conservatory. \n\n\nMakarchuk can later make another attempt to gain permanent residency for his wife. Beyond that, the family said, it \nis hard to picture the future.\n\n\"I love the city,\" said Slobodova, who lives in San Francisco. \"I have a healthy baby and everything was going so \nwell for me. It's very hard to lose all this.\n\n\"Being locked up for so long makes you think how much you take for granted. It's about time to say thank you for \neverything. I'll call and see a lot of people. Thirty days seems maybe like a long time, but it's not.\"\n\nNotes\n\nSHORTER VERSION: page 8B, Morning Final edition\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPhoto;\n\nPHOTO: SPECIAL TO THE MERCURY NEWS\n\nYana Slobodova, shown with son Nikita, taught piano lessons at the Community School of Music and Arts in \nMountain View.\n"}
