Farmers \nWeekly\u2019s machinery team picked out a few of the latest machines on show.\n\nWeaving GD8000T drill\n\n\nWeaving\u2019s GD drill has proved to be hot property on the zero-til scene since its launch in 2015 and, with more than \n300 now working across the UK, the company has set its sights on the 8m market.\n\nSee also: NAAC farm contractor charges 2018/19\n\nThe extra wingspan has required a complete redesign of the drill\u2019s running gear, including a chunky chassis that \nruns underneath the hopper, a link-arm hitch and massive low ground pressure tyres on the back, although it can \nstill fold to 3m for transport.\n\n \n\nThere are also double metering units and distribution heads to keep the slanted disc coulters fed from the 4t \nhopper. Currently it\u2019s only geared up to handle grain, but a split version will be launched later.\n\nSpacings between the 48 low-draft coulters are set at 16.7cm, although the added bulk means it will want 280hp up \nfront.\n\nThe drill is built at Weaving\u2019s Evesham base and a standard spec model is expected to list at about \u00a389,000. \nHowever, that figure will climb if it\u2019s ordered with Avadex, fertiliser or slug pellet applicators.\n\nAmazone Hektor plough\n\nFollowing its buyout of ailing cultivations maker Vogel and Noot, Amazone has added another plough to its ever-\ngrowing line-up.\n\nThe semi-mounted Hektor is based on the old V and N model of the same name, but has had a number of \nupgrades, particularly to the headstock.\n\nHere, Amazone engineers have reworked the turnover mechanism and improved the damping so the plough turns \nover more smoothly. Apparently this was a particular weak spot on the previous model. It\u2019s also rated to 360hp.\n\nFurrow width adjustment is manual from 15 to 19in and the standard shearbolt version can be specced with six, \nseven or eight furrows.\n\nThose on stonier ground also have the option of hydraulic auto reset, although this isn\u2019t available on the biggest \nmodel.\n\nBuyers can choose from eight different mould boards and there\u2019s tool-free setting of both the working depth and \npitch. At the rear, a wide depth/transport wheel with hydro-pneumatic suspension comes as standard.\n\nThe Hektor, along with the rest of the Amazone plough range, is being built at the former Vogel and Noot factory in \nHungary.\n\nThis includes the maker\u2019s in-house developed Cayron, with was originally put together in Leipzig.\n\nList price of the eight-furrow Hektor model pictured is \u00a342,940.\n\nHouseham Harrier\n\nAfter a troublesome six-year existence, Househam has replaced its mid-ranking Merlin sprayer with a fresh-faced \nHarrier machine.\n\nThis follows on from the launch of the new flagship Predator at Cereals last year, which signalled the end for the \nMerlin and coincided with customer comments stating that the Merlin bore little resemblance to the machine that \nwas released in 2012.\n\n\n\nTipping the scales at 8,500kg unladen, the machine has a single-piece chassis with oscillating A-frame axles on the \nfront and rear, which has significantly improved the ride and weight distribution, we\u2019re told.\n\nRunning the same 240hp MTU six-pot engine that was in the outgoing Merlin, it has a choice of boom widths from \nthe twin-fold 24m to larger 36m units.\n\nThere are three tank sizes with the smaller 4,000-litre coming in fibreglass while the larger 5,000- and 6,000-litre \ntanks are stainless steel.\n\nA new cab, fitted out with much of the same technology as the Merlin, includes the TMC screen and auto section \ncontrol through the Field master terminal and the option of Househam\u2019s own or Norac boom levelling.\n\nBuilt at the Househam HQ in Lincolnshire, it is available to order now starting at about \u00a3160,000.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nBus and bin lorry technology is being used on an Aberdeenshire farm to shave 20% off its red diesel bill and eke \nextra power from existing machines without tampering with the engine.\n\nThe retrofit hydrogen electrolyser comes as a bolt-on, suitcase-sized box and can be plumbed into the air intake on \npretty much any vehicle, including tractors, telehandlers and 4x4s.\n\nIt uses basic physics to split distilled water into its constituent parts \u2013 oxygen and hydrogen \u2013 by running an electric \ncurrent through it via two probes. This oxyhydrogen is then fed into the intake alongside the standard flow to alter \nthe characteristics of the air in the combustion chamber.\n\nIn doing so, it produces a cleaner and quicker combustive explosion that has been proven to cut nasty emissions by \nmore than 80%.\n\nThis isn\u2019t enough to provide a sole source of power on its own \u2013 it has to run alongside a standard diesel (or petrol) \ncombustion engine \u2013 but, because the hydrolysis process happens on the move, there\u2019s no need to organise \nstorage or transportation of the second fuel.\n\nSee also: Converting 4x4s to red diesel \u2013 how to stay road legal\n\nHigh-tech buses\n\nDave and Nicola Barron were the first farmers in the UK to fit the system to an agricultural vehicle.\n\nTheir family farm at Nether Aden, near Mintlaw, Peterhead, is one of nine businesses taking part in a trial run by the \nScottish government looking into the options for reducing agricultural carbon emissions.\n\nMr Barron first came across the technology on Aberdeen\u2019s bus fleet and felt it offered a good opportunity to \nsignificantly reduce emissions caused by his machinery fleet.\n\nBut, while the council\u2019s fleet runs on pure hydrogen, the bolt-on system offered by Barnsley-based Water Fuel \nEngineering is simpler and cheaper because it\u2019s designed to work alongside a conventional engine rather than \neliminate its use altogether.\n\nThe hydrolyser was fitted to Mr Barron\u2019s JCB telehandler in September last year \u2013 and then on his New Holland \nTS115 tractor a couple of months ago \u2013 with grants for the cost supplied by the Scottish government.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nGas is produced on-the-go, meaning there\u2019s no added responsibility for producing, distributing or storing the \nhydrogen.  \n\n\n\nThe simple kit mounts on the telehandler\u2019s chassis (just above the hydraulic oil sight glass) and includes an \nelectrolyser, control unit and water reservoir, which must be topped up periodically.\n\nIt works by running an electric current through distilled water to produce oxy-hydrogen gas, which is collected in a \ntest tube that can be seen bubbling from the cab. This then filters into the engine\u2019s air intake to supplement the \nsupply of diesel at a rate of about 6%, which, in turn, transforms Mr Barron\u2019s run-of-the-mill Loadall into a hybrid \nvehicle.\n\nAdding the gas accelerates the engine\u2019s combustion process, causing a cleaner, faster and more efficient burn of \nthe diesel mixture. This extra efficiency helps to reduce fuel use.\n\nIf the box stops working for any reason, the machine will revert to conventional diesel power.\n\nResults\n\nExtensive trials have shown stacks of benefits. The headline figures include fuel savings that have ranged from \n11% to 29% and a reduction in emissions of up to 80%.\n\nHowever, the clean-burning nature of the system means there are other advantages that can add a healthy cost \nsaving to a farm\u2019s annual bill. For instance, diesel particulate filters will need to be replaced less frequently on \nmodern tractors and oil change hours can also be extended.\n\nThat\u2019s because mixing oxy-hydrogen with the diesel produces an earlier and more mechanically efficient explosion \nat the piston. Because of the better burn of the diesel mix there\u2019s also an argument that engines with the system \nfitted will no longer need AdBlue additive.\n\nMr Barron saw fuel use on his JCB drop from 6.84 litres/hour to 5.92 litres/hour after the kit had been fitted.\n\nThis equates to a 13.5% fuel saving, though it is expected to get closer to 25% as the company has since increased \nthe electrical current being used to produce the hydrogen, which, in turn, will improve diesel efficiency.\n\nAnd with the farm\u2019s telehandler clocking up around 1,000 hours/year \u2013 a 920-litre fuel saving \u2013 he will trim at least \n\u00a3500/year from his red diesel bill. And if AdBlue is removed it would cut another \u00a3500 from the farm\u2019s annual \nrunning costs.\n\nMr Barron also reports a noticeable increase in usable power, which has meant increasing working speeds and less \ntime spent in the field.\n\nMaking the bills stack up\n\nThe major stumbling block for most interested parties is likely to be the price.\n\nThe Scottish government stumped up \u00a37,500 for Mr Barron\u2019s first kit (he paid for the second himself), but Water \nFuel Engineering has since altered its pricing to make the system more accessible for other farmers by structuring it \nto match the potential fuel savings.\n\nIt can now be retrofitted to any tractor or loader for about \u00a31,500 followed by monthly fees of \u00a3110, which the \ncompany says should still allow farmers to benefit financially from the fuel savings.\n\nThe kit has a life expectancy of 20 years and has since been fitted to a Land Rover Defender in Aberdeenshire, \nwhich is now achieving 24% fuel savings on white diesel.\n\nInvestment costs are also tiny compared to a full switch to hydrogen power. Hydrogen fuel costs about \u00a310/litre and \nthe machines are very expensive to buy, plus the fuel tanks are heavy and the fuel must be stored carefully.\n\n12V alkaline electrolyser\n\n\n\nOperating voltage 12V to 14.2V\n\nConsumption Up to 21amps\n\nGas production Up to 5 litres/minute\n\nDimensions 250mm x 200mm x 200mm (wxhxd)\n\nHydrolysis performance\n\nCarbon dioxide 64% reduction\n\nCarbon monoxide 85% reduction\n\nHydrocarbons 53% reduction\n\nOpacity (soot) 52% reduction\n\nFuel use 35% reduction\n\nFarming for a Better Climate initiative\n\nDave and Nicola Barron are taking part in a Scottish government-backed scheme that encourages farmers to \nconsider their carbon footprint.\n\nThe programme has been running for six years and currently has nine focus farms dotted around Scotland. Each \nfarm is carbon audited and is encouraged to trial new farming systems and monitor the effect they have on \nefficiency and profitability.\n\nFitting the JCB\u2019s hydrolyser was just one of the initiatives Mr Barron has integrated into his mixed farming system.\n\nHe has also increased his spring cropping area to cut fertiliser use, aims to dry all of his grain in a carbon-neutral \nfashion using a biomass boiler and solar power and has incorporated green manures into his cropping plans.\n\nHe is also keen to explore the potential of storing hydrogen gas as part of a farming co-operative.\n\nFARM FACTS: Nether Aden, Mintlaw, Aberdeenshire\n\nArea: 210ha\n\nCrops: Spring barley, winter barley, whole crop, winter wheat, grass\n\nLivestock: 140 suckler cows\n\nMachinery:\n\nTractors \u2013 New Holland TS115 and T6.180\n\nTelehandler \u2013 JCB 526\n\nCombine \u2013 New Holland TX32\n\nImplements \u2013 Kuhn Accord 3m, 24m Berthoud Racer sprayer\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nGrowers in England who had crop drilling plans disrupted by bad weather must apply for a derogation to the three-\ncrop rule before 30 June, warns the NFU .\n\n\n\nSnow, ice and heavy rain across Europe in March and April prevented access to land for many growers and this \nmeant they could not fulfil EU greening rules on crop diversification. \n\nSee also: UK arable growers win three-crop rule exemption\n\nThe diversification regulation, or so-called three-crop rule, means at least three different crops must be grown on \nfarms with more than 30ha of arable land.\n\nOn farms where the arable area exceeds 10ha, two or more different crops must be grown to qualify for greening \npayments.\n\nBack in the spring it quickly became clear that low temperatures and soil conditions meant it was impossible to \ncarry out the necessary fieldwork.\n\nA number of EU member states applied for the rule to be suspended and Scotland, Northern Ireland and the rest of \nthe UK followed suit.\n\nTo qualify Defra had to submit data on rainfall, rain days and temperatures to the EU Commission. While it was \naccepted the derogation could apply for the whole of Scotland and Northern Ireland, England\u2019s farmers were \nrequired to submit an application based on their own location.\n\nThe derogation does not entirely suspend the diversification rule, warned NFU senior BPS adviser Richard \nWordsworth.\n\n\u201cWhere the requirement was three crops, the derogation will allow two without jeopardising payments, as long as \nthe application is lodged by the 30 June deadline,\u201d he said. \n\nMr Wordsworth encouraged farmers who were prevented from drilling spring crops to act immediately.\n\n\u201cThe application process is not at all onerous and does not require pages of form-filling,\u201d he said.\n\nTo help growers understand the process, the NFU has drawn together a Q&A to provide advice to potential \napplicants.\n\nWhat you need to know about the three-crop rule derogation\n\nWhat parts of England does the wet weather derogation apply to? It applies across the whole of England. \n\nDoes the derogation apply to all farmers who need to undertake greening? No, the derogation only applies to the \nrules for crop diversification and only to those farmers who would normally be required to have a minimum of three \ncrops \u2013 in other words, those who have more than 30ha of arable land on their claim form. Farmers who have been \naffected by the wet weather can apply to the RPA for a derogation to allow them to have two crops instead of three. \n \n\nDoes the derogation need to be applied for? Yes. Farmers affected must apply to the RPA to take advantage of this \nderogation. Derogation requests can either be made by email or by telephone, and must be received by the RPA by \n30 June 2018. Send emails to ruralpayments@defra.gsi.gov.uk using the subject line \"Wet weather derogation \nrequest\".\n\nWhat information needs to be included? The following information should be provided in the body of the email:\n\nSBI and name of the business making the request\n\nA list of the affected land parcels\n\nWhat crops you intended to plant\n\nmailto:ruralpayments@defra.gsi.gov.uk\n\n\nIf you are unable to email this information to the RPA, requests can be made by calling 03000 200301.\n\nYou will need to provide the RPA with all of the above information.\n\n Am I required to do anything else to take advantage of this derogation?It is important to keep evidence of your \noriginal cropping plans, as this may be required during an inspection.  \n\nWhy doesn\u2019t this derogation apply to those farmers that are only required to have two crops (10-30ha of arable \nland)?The regulation does not allow for a derogation in this situation. However, there are force majeure and \nexceptional circumstances provisions that may also be applicable.

To maximise seed number, the \ncanopy has to be managed to reach the right size at flowering so it will go on to produce the optimum pod number.\n\nEstablishment, along with seed rate and nutrition, are the key factors in achieving this.\n\n\n\nTo get good crop establishment, growers must look at soil conditions before they focus on any agronomic \nconsiderations, as the crop is more likely to establish successfully in a well-structured soil.\n\nSoil conditions should also dictate the time of drilling, rather than calendar date. This is illustrated by the range of \nsowing dates used by the YEN entrants, from 6 August to 15 September, with the average sowing date being 23 \nAugust.\n\nAnalysis by Bayer shows the UK oilseed rape crop is drilled about two weeks earlier than  five years ago. Sowing \ndates in the third week of August are now the most popular.\n\nSeed-bed conditions\n\nAs with most crops, the aim is to create a seed-bed with a fine tilth. A useful rule of thumb is the smaller the seed, \nthe smaller the aggregate needed around it \u2013 there is research to show percentage establishment falls dramatically \nas aggregate size increases.\n\nGood seed-to-soil contact is important for best results, as it allows moisture to get through the seed coat and give \ngood germination. In dry conditions and on heavy soils, soil aggregate size influences the potential for this.\n\nWhere soil structure is good, it can usually be drilled without any further action. However, some soils will need some \nhelp, as compaction inhibits oilseed rape root growth and limits its access to moisture and nutrients.\n\nAny restructuring done for oilseed rape should have benefits for future crops, helping to spread the cost of the \noperation.\n\nA good soil structure that allows water infiltration will also reduce the risk of any herbicide run-off and help to protect \nwatercourses \u2013 something becoming increasingly important for preventing restrictions on their use.\n\nAssessing soil structure should start with the previous crop, or just after harvest, explains Philip Wright, \nindependent consultant at Wright Resolutions, who suggests the following steps:\n\nDig down with a spade to look at soil profile\n\nIdentify where there is a compacted layer\n\nPlan the timing of restructuring to suit soil moisture \u2013 if it\u2019s too wet, it won\u2019t work\n\nCultivate to the appropriate depth to deal with any problem\n\nDig down afterwards to check results\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about providing the optimum conditions for crop growth,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cWith oilseed rape, you are placing the seed at a precise depth, which you can\u2019t do with a cloddy seed-bed or where \nthere\u2019s a compacted layer.\n\n\u201cRemember too that residue management can affect establishment, especially if surface trash is poorly distributed.\u201d\n\nSowing depth\n\nA consistent sowing depth is more important than the actual depth \u2013 with the season and conditions also playing \ntheir part. For most conditions, seed should be sown at a depth of 2-3cm, and no deeper than 5cm.\n\nVariable sowing depth means there is likely to be patches of delayed or failed growth, having a detrimental effect on \ngrowth and creating management issues throughout the season.\n\n\n\nConsolidation is also important, as it helps to retain moisture, ensures good seed-to-soil contact and assists with \nslug control. It also ensures optimum performance where soil applied herbicides are used.\n\nIn dry conditions, seed should be sown as soon as possible after cultivations to minimise soil moisture loss, \nfollowed by rolling.\n\nDrilling date\n\nWinter oilseed rape is mainly drilled between mid-August and mid-September in England, with crops in Scotland \ngoing in from mid-August to early September.\n\nHigh yields can be achieved from drilling at any of these times, but a significant yield reduction is more likely with \ncrops drilled after mid-September.\n\nBased on average temperatures in England, crops sown in August will take about 10 days to emerge, while those \nsown in September will take 14 days. Oilseed rape needs 90C days for germination and 140C days for one pair of \nleaves.\n\nSeed rate and plant population\n\nSeed rates should be geared to achieving about 25-35 plants/sq m for both hybrid and conventional varieties.\n\nThe seed rate necessary to achieve this target will depend on the percentage plant establishment \u2013 which in turn \ndepends on the conditions and slug pressure. Predicting plant establishment is difficult, but rates tend to range from \n50-80%, with 70-80% being typical in most seasons.\n\nThe practice of allowing some margin for uncertain weather and pest pressures has resulted in a wide range of \nseed rates being used on-farm.\n\nIn general, conventional varieties are sown at 50-120 seeds/sq m, while hybrids go in at 50-70 seeds/sq m. Where \n70-80% establishment is being achieved, the optimum seed rate is 35-40 seeds/sq m.\n\nHowever, there is scope to reduce seed rates, believes Pete Berry of Adas, as the crop has good ability to \ncompensate for lower plant populations and is less likely to lodge in these conditions. Thick crops are at risk from \nweaker stems, poor light penetration and higher light reflectance \u2013 which may reduce yields.\n\nIn contrast, going too low with seed rates risks there not being enough pods or seeds to produce a reasonable \nyield.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to note the two top performers in the YEN competition both achieved very high yields from low plant \npopulations.\n\n\u201cOne of them sowed 30 seeds to get 15 plants/sq m, while the other sowed 45 seeds to get 30 plants/sq m.\u201d\n\nIncreasing row width\n\nEstablishing oilseed rape in rows wider than 30cm apart has become more common in recent years.\n\nAdas work suggests row width can be increased up to 48cm, without affecting yields. Going from 48cm up to 72cm \ndid reduce yield potential.\n\nWhere seed rates higher than 60 seeds/sq m are used, there is potential for a high degree of plant crowding and \ncompetition within the rows.\n\nWider rows also leave an amount of soil unprotected, increasing the risk of weeds germinating and soil run-off.\n\n\n\nIn wider rows, the optimum plant population is lower than that for crops sown in traditional row spacings. With some \nsystems, growers now work to a target plant number/linear metre, to get the right population for high yields.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFarmers should avoid cutting corners when it comes to buying grass seed and should use the Recommended List \nto ensure they are selecting the best varieties possible.\n\nThat was the message from independent grassland adviser Chris Duller at the Royal Welsh Grassland event last \nweek (16 May).\n\n\u201c[Grass] will hopefully be in the ground for 5-10 years.

Be clear in your mind what \nit\u2019s going to do.\u201d\n\nFor example, he said grazing required denser swards whereas grass for cutting would need to be more open.\n\n\u201cFor some farmers, a cut and graze mix will suit [those taking only one cut], but there\u2019s advantages to being more \nspecialised.\u201d\n\nBeware of fillers\n\nMr Duller also warned farmers about using mixes containing \u201cfillers\u201d or cheaper varieties that had fallen off the \nRecommended List.\n\n\u201cBeware of fillers if they have been taken off for a good reason; because they have been out-classed in terms of \nyield or have changed in terms of disease resistance or quality.\n\n\u201cSaving money by buying varieties [that are poorer] makes no commercial sense.\u201d\n\nInstead, he encouraged farmers to challenge their seed merchant and find out more about the variety in question.\n\nPicking the best varieties off the list\n\nWhen choosing varieties to add to their \u201cshopping list\u201d he advised farmers to go through the list with a highlighter \nand pick out the ones with 5%+ gains against others, not 2-3%, because 5%+ would make the most difference on \nfarm.\n\nFor example, he said AberGain had the highest grazing value of 78.6 which equated to an extra 7% more grass \nthan average.\n\n\u201cRemember, one point increase in D value is worth a 5% improvement in animal performance.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFarmers are pushing up costs by spending too much money on buying new machinery, an AHDB survey has \nrevealed.\n\n\n\nThe survey, carried out in partnership with Strutt & Parker, looked at machinery costs across the levy board\u2019s 21 \nmonitor farms and revealed a huge variation in machinery costs a hectare.\n\nTotal machinery costs varied from \u00a3113/ha to \u00a3290/ha across the farms which ranged in size from 97ha to 1,278ha.\n\nEconomies of scale\n\nDespite this size difference there was no benefit from economies of scale, according to the AHDB\u2019s knowledge \nexchange manager in the East Midlands, Harry Henderson.\n\n\u201cWe expected to see the larger farms able to spread machinery investments across their wider hectareage and \nrealise their economies of scale,\u201d Mr Henderson said.\n\n\u201cBut this wasn\u2019t the case. Some of the largest farms had the highest costs and so are simply spending too much on \nbuying new machinery,\u201d he said.\n\nSee also: Farmers advised to allocate machinery spending better\n\nThe variation was also not linked directly to different soil types.\n\n\u201cBecause the farms stretch from Cornwall to Moray and have all types of soil, we also expected to see units with \nheavier land having the highest cost.\n\n\u201cAgain we were able to rule that out with farms on so-called boys\u2019 land having some of the higher costs while some \nof the smallest farm businesses on heavier land were running at the lowest cost,\u201d Mr Henderson said.\n\nBad weather\n\nHe noted some farms justified purchasing larger machinery because the ability to carry out operations more quickly \ncould offset any risks of bad weather.\n\n\u201cWhile wet springs and catchy harvests mean many farmers are keen to have increased drilling or harvesting \ncapacity, farmers need to look at this policy in terms of cost to the business.\u201d\n\nHeavier, larger machines can also lead to deep compaction which can take years to correct,\u201d Mr Henderson pointed \nout.\n\nMr Henderson suggested farms with higher costs should review their buying policy.\n\nIt is important farmers don\u2019t succumb to machinery envy and compete with the neighbours for having the biggest kit, \nhe said.\n\n\u201cFarms with the biggest newest and shiniest machinery are not necessarily the best run farm businesses,\u201d Mr \nHenderson stressed.\n\nUsage review\n\nThe AHDB recommended the first step in cutting costs was to review their tractor usage and to keep what they \nalready had in the shed for longer.\n\n\u201cTrade-in values will be lower but keeping the machine and riding out the steep depreciation curve until it has \nflattened out is still cheaper than early replacement.\n\n\u201cDepreciation is a real cost and even having to spend more on repairs, new tyres or a gearbox can be cheaper than \nbuying a brand new machine,\u201d Mr Henderson said.\n\n\n\nIn the longer term, a planned replacement policy, a review of the whole system and appropriate machinery \npurchase according to the operation were all important factors.\n\nFarmbench\n\n\u201cFarmers should also use AHDB\u2019s Farmbench to help assess their machinery and business costs,\u201d Mr Henderson \nsaid.\n\nFarmbench is one of the tools for farmers to help manage resilience to risks and to cope with volatility. It is a free to \nlevy payer service for farmers to analyse their own cost structure and then compare costs with other local growers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very powerful tool to see where your business might be poorly performing in comparison to others and need \nsome attention.\u201d\n\nHe added joining a benchmarking group was even more valuable.\n\n\u201cFigures for each farmer in the group are still anonymous but meetings can discuss how to tackle them and share \nknowledge and tips on how to get the most from machinery,\u201d he added.\n\nMachinery costs range (\u00a3/ha)\n\nOverall\n\n\u00a3113\n\n\u00a3290\n\nDepreciation\n\n\u00a34\n\n\u00a3120\n\nRepairs\n\n\u00a320\n\n\u00a362\n\nPloughing\n\n\u00a340\n\n\u00a397\n\nCombining\n\n\u00a341\n\n\u00a397\n\nDiesel\n\n\u00a328\n\n\u00a386\n\nSource: AHDB/Strutt&Parker\n\n\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nPlans to require all cattle keepers in Scotland to tag cattle with EID tags are to be announced at the Highland Show \nnext week.\n\nThe current timeline will mean all newborn calves will have to be EID tagged by 1 January 2020, with discussions \ncontinuing about how to roll them out to the rest of the national herd.\n\nIt is likely that all cattle leaving a holding will need EID tags by 1 June 2022 \u2013 meaning youngstock will already have \nthem by this stage and only adults will require retagging.\n\nSee also: How a large Luing beef herd is managed on the Scottish isles\n\nThe change, which is still subject to the passage of legislation in Holyrood, will play a big part in making paper \nrecords for cattle a thing of the past, says ScotEID director Bob Yuill.\n\n\u201cRetagging will be kept to an absolute minimum,\u201d he promised, but said that farmers need to recognise that there is \na cost \u2013 both financial and administrative \u2013 to running the old and new system in parallel for longer than necessary.\n\nTag manufacturers price a pair of cattle EID tags at about \u00a32 more than conventional tags, but costs will be kept \ndown by the EID number being the same as the visible number, meaning there will be no obligation on farmers to \npurchase EID readers if they do not want to.\n\nBut Mr Yuill said there will be significant benefits from embracing the benefits EID tags have to offer. These include \nreduced workloads during TB testing, with cattle able to be identified electronically rather than the dangerous work \nof scraping dirt off tags on cattle that are stressed and aggressive.\n\nIt will also mean an end to animals having to be destroyed at abattoirs rather than enter the food chain if they arrive \nfor slaughter with the wrong paper passport, and it is likely to be simpler to move cattle between farms with the \nsame holding number.\n\nEU deadline approaching\n\nAll EU member states were ordered in June 2014 to start preparing their cattle traceability systems for compatibility \nwith EID technology, with a deadline for compliance set by the end of 2019.\n\nScotland is significantly further ahead of England and Wales, as they are close to completing the backend software \nrequired to manage an EID-based movement service.\n\nIn contrast, work at Defra on the Livestock Information Program \u2013 the replacement for CTS Online \u2013 has not even \nbegun, with pre-consultation discussions still taking place, according to NFU chief livestock adviser John Royle.\n\nThe proposed multispecies database would allow real-time movement recording of all livestock and bring about \nhuge savings for farmers, markets and abattoirs by eliminating paper records and reducing the number of on-farm \ninspections, he says.\n\nBut despite the relatively short time left to deliver a large IT project, he is bullish about the prospects of the system \nbeing ready in time, saying there are comparable systems in other industries that deliver traceability of goods that \ncan hopefully be adapted.\n\nScottish farmers wishing to learn more about the changes can visit the ScotEID stand at the Highland Show on \nAvenue 7 between NFU Scotland and the SRUC.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\n\n\nThe new season UK ammonium nitrate market kicked off a good \u00a340/t higher than last year, with limited June and \nJuly tonnages being snapped up as soon as they were offered.\n\nCF issued a price which put June deliveries on to farm at \u00a3220/t late last week, with July at \u00a37/t more.\n\nHeavy uptake meant the book was closed on these two months within a day or so, even though prices were about \n10% higher than the trade had been expecting.\n\nSee also: 6 ways arable farms can reduce business risk\n\nThe long winter and late wet spring delayed demand from the grassland sector and some arable areas until \nrelatively recently, resulting in a background of very low stocks and pent-up demand, according to traders.\n\nCF\u2019s list price put another \u00a36/t on to the price for August deliveries, putting product on farm at \u00a3233/t.

The \nrobots were all fitted with their own RTK systems working to 10mm precision, from maps already in place or ones \nthey produced themselves.\n\nIn April 2018, all three robots worked simultaneously in the same field. The first one dropped fertiliser in the \ncultivated strips and worked from soil analysis maps to add the correct amount for the varying soils, before its two \nsiblings followed behind with drills.\n\nPlanting speeds of about 8kph has been achieved. However, because of the wet weather experienced in southern \nFrance this spring, the progress has been slow and the drilling is yet to be completed.\n\nFuture plans for the crop will be a dose of post-emergence nitrogen about a month after drilling, before three further \ninter-row weeding operations by two robots in the run-up to harvest.\n\nThe weeding takes the place of any further chemical control methods.  \n\nThere are five different tools that attach to the tracked robots, which have a 24-hour autonomous run time, which \nmeans the only human-controlled job will be harvesting the crop later in the year.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nShoppers back British food, but even a small price rise will cause them to switch to imported alternatives, an AHDB \nsurvey has revealed.\n\nThe survey for the AHDB\u2019s latest Consumer Focus report looked at shopper sentiment towards \u201cBrand Britain\u201d and \nquestioned whether there were any generational differences. \n\nSee also: Farming in grave danger from US trade deal, warns Ed Balls\n\n\n\nAlmost 70% of shoppers wanted to see more British produce in stores, and three in four would buy more home-\ngrown food if it was better value.\n\nA total of 78% believed Britain needed to be more self-sufficient in food and not rely on imports so much.\n\nFickle shoppers\n\nBut the findings showed just a 10% increase in the cost of a home-grown product would cause one in three \nshoppers to abandon their principles and buy a cheaper import instead.\n\nThe revelation suggested that maintaining price competitiveness would be key for the UK agricultural sector in a \npost-Brexit world, the AHDB said.\n\n\u201cTo-date there is little to suggest a wave of patriotism has helped bolster sales of all things British since the EU \nreferendum and relying on \u2018Britishness\u2019 alone is not the answer,\u201d it warned.\n\nAmong the other key findings was a stronger commitment to British food from older shoppers who said they tried to \nbuy British whenever they could.\n\nEven so 74% of people over the age of 55 said increasing food prices were their biggest concern when it came to \nfinancial circumstances.\n\nTherefore, any positive sentiment towards buying British will only count for so much as shoppers try to manage \never-tighter household budgets, the AHDB concluded.\n\nYounger shoppers surveyed, were less likely to find \u201cBritishness\u201d compelling as a driver of purchase \u2013 highlighting \nthe need for industry to look at how best to sell Brand Britain to this sector of society.\n\nQuality and health\n\nYounger generations were more likely to base their buying decisions on better quality, with health being a top \npriority. Convenience and time-saving were also important to this age group, the AHDB said\n\nReport author AHDB retail insight manager Sukhvinder Gill suggested the focus on price was likely to intensify.\n\n\u201cThe UK shopper is price conscious and increasingly so, given the current economic climate which is putting \npressure on household budgets,\u201d Mr Gill said.\n\n\u201cSentiment towards buying British remains fairly strong. But this is against a backdrop of almost four-fifths of \nshoppers in an IGD poll stating that rising living costs were of concern to them.\n\n\u201cWith real incomes only recently returning to marginal growth, the focus on price and, indeed, quality is likely to \nintensify in the foreseeable future,\u201d he added.\n\nPost-Brexit world\n\nAnd the levy board\u2019s chief market development officer Christine Watts warned: \u201cThis evidence to-date serves only \nto highlight the uncertainty of what might happen in the future.\n\n\u201cIn a post-Brexit world we can see that simply featuring the Union flag on products is not enough and so industry \nneeds to demonstrate the other attributes they provide to meet consumer requirements around quality, provenance, \nsupporting local farming and so forth.\u201d\n\nMs Watts added: \u201cIt is also clear from this report that price is a key purchase consideration and remaining \ncompetitive will be crucial for home producers and growers. The concern we all have in the industry is that if the \nprice gap gets too big, consumers will simply look for cheaper alternatives from abroad.\u201d\n\n\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThroughout the 2018 show season, we\u2019ll be bringing you regional coverage of the UK\u2019s best-loved agricultural and \ncountryside shows.\n\nThese events showcase the best of British farming and food, while also serving as a great social occasion and an \nopportunity for consumers and the public at large to learn more about the agriculture industry.\n\nSee also: Zwartbles and Dairy Shorthorn dazzle at Balmoral Show 2018\n\nBalmoral Show\n\nThe brilliant Balmoral Show celebrated its 150th anniversary from 16-19 May at Balmoral Park, Lisburn, Northern \nIreland. About 115,000 people attended the four-day spectacular.\n\nVisitors were treated to plenty of sunshine, with temperatures hitting highs of 19C on the final day.\n\nIt was all too much for Monree Spot 3, who needed a power nap after winning the Saddleback class and claiming \nthe interbreed reserve rosette for Diane Ruddock, Donaghcloney, County Armagh. \n\nSee also: A beginners guide to careers in agriculture\n\nDairy interbreed history was made when Ballytrain Bloom 30th became the first Dairy Shorthorn to win the \nchampionship.\n\nBig names were out in force at this year's show. Bainbridge farmer and Ulster and Ireland rugby hooker Rory Best \nmade an appearance, pictured here with Helen Davies of Shearwell Data. \n\nPrincess Anne and secretary of state for Northern Ireland Karen Bradley also came along.\n\nTrueman genetics were to the fore in the beef ring, with both the interbreed champion Limousin and commercial \nchampion reserve coming from Trueman sires.\n\nWith a bumper turnout of sheep entries this year, everyone wanted a look at the catalogue. \n\nIf you\u2019ve got an agricultural show taking place in your area and think it should be covered by Farmers Weekly, let \ncommunity editor Oli Hill know by emailing oli.hill@reedbusiness.com\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nBarley varieties that are tolerant to a key viral disease could help farmers reduce yield losses when growing barley \nwithout neonicotinoid seed treatments.\n\nTwo breeders are investigating barley varieties in the UK that can tolerate barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), which \ncould reach farms in the next couple of years.\n\nThe disease, which is spread by aphids, can result in significant yield losses, especially with early infections leading \nto plant death.\n\nSee also: How a neonic ban will affect beet and cereal growers\n\nBird-cherry and grain aphids, which both spread the disease, can be successfully managed by the use of \nneonicotinoid seed treatments.\n\nHowever, this autumn will be the last time farmers will be able to use them as the EU extends a ban on three \nneonicotinoid pesticides to cereals and sugar beet.\n\nmailto:oli.hill@reedbusiness.com\n\n\nWhile bird-cherry aphids are still well controlled by pyrethroid sprays, there are resistance problems in grain aphids.\n\nTherefore, varietal tolerance could have a future role in barley, with varieties already being grown in France, where \nBYDV is a bigger problem.\n\nVarietal tolerance is especially valuable when considering that later drilling, which can help reduce BYDV risk in \nwheat, is not an option for barley.\n\nThere are already tolerant varieties and Will Compson, sales and cereals manager at KWS, says the company is \nreleasing Amistar commercially in Autumn 2019 on a limited basis with pilot growers.\n\nSo how does Amistar work? KWS barley breeder David Harrap explains that it contains a tolerance gene. This \nmeans plants will still get infected, but  will tolerate the virus and grow normally.\n\n\u201cThe YD2 gene has been around since the 1960s and was commercially available, but died a death as there was \nno interest,\u201d he says.\n\nHowever, growing concerns over the future of neonicotinoid seed treatments have brought an acceleration of work \nto introduce BYDV tolerance, especially in the past two years.\n\nVariety performance\n\nJohn Miles, KWS product development manager, says that in trials Amistar has been impressive, giving similar \nyields to Tower.\n\nThe variety is in its second season of strip trials in higher BYDV risk areas from south Wales to East Sussex.\n\nHe highlights one trial in East Anglia where there was a 10-15% loss of yield in a standard variety because of \nnatural infection. Amistar lost just 0.5% in the same area, in what he describes as a medium risk year.\n\nMr Harrap points out that you can still get leaf yellowing, but with no significant effect on yield.\n\nHowever, Mr Miles says farmers may still need to manage aphids.  \n\n\u201cYou still get the virus circulating, as the gene does not break the lifecycle,\" he says. \"Therefore, farmers may still \nneed to manage aphids to reduce the risk of virus spread to neighbouring crops of wheat and barley.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Mr Miles believes tolerant varieties will appeal to farmers on high risk sites such as the south coast. \nHe suggests that for the first few years, they may be used as a tool on headlands, as aphids come in from the \nheadlands.\n\nIt could also have a role in buffer zones around watercourses, so farmers can make more use of no-spray zones\n\nVariety pipeline\n\nThere are more varieties in the KWS pipeline, including two-rows, and Mr Harrap believes there will be a substantial \nmove to BYDV tolerance in coming years.\n\n\u201cIt will be a trait that we will see more of in pretty much everyone\u2019s breeding programmes.\u201d\n\nThere is little risk of resistance developing in the aphid population, he says, so it will be around for some time.\n\nFellow breeder Limagrain is trialling a six-row with BYDV tolerance that is already being grown on the continent, \nfrom its Belgian breeding programme.\n\nThe variety, Rafaela, is vigorous and early to mature, making it an ideal entry to oilseed rape, says arable technical \nmanager Ron Granger.\n\n\n\nCereals product manager Les Daubney says that in trials last year, it performed as well as other six-rows, sitting at \nthe bottom end of the hybrids.\n\nThe company is still testing its performance and it should be commercially available from next autumn, in time for \nwhen Deter is no longer available.\n\n\u201cBreeding efforts have accelerated and two-rows are about one or two years away from entering national list trials,\u201d \nhe says.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nWelsh farmers will only receive the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) subsidy in its current form until 2019.\n\nThe Welsh government has announced what it terms as a \u201cgradual and multi-year transition\u201d from the existing BPS \nto new schemes.\n\nSee also: FW poll on how government should phase out direct payments\n\nCabinet secretary for rural affairs, Lesley Griffiths, insists she wants to avoid a New Zealand-style \u201ccliff edge\u201d \nremoval of subsidies and has confirmed the transition period will run until 2025.\n\nFarmers can rely on receiving two further direct payments from the current scheme \u2013 in 2018 and 2019 \u2013 but in \n2020 a gradual five-year phasing in of the new structure will kick in.\n\nBPS timetable at a glance\n\nJuly 2018 Welsh government will announce preferred options for future subsidies\n\n2018 and 2019 BPS payments to continue in current form\n\n2020-25 Transition period to new payment structure\n\nMs Griffiths suggested the BPS was not the best tool for delivering support for food production and said future direct \nfinancial support would instead be given in return for \u201ceconomic activities\u201d and \u201cpublic goods production\u201d.\n\nWhat this actually means for farmers won\u2019t be known until July when the government announces its preferred \noptions in a consultation document.\n\n\u201cThere are clearly important links between the production of food and public goods so the support must be \ncomplementary,\u201d said Ms Griffiths.\n\n\u201cMany land managers will be able to produce both, but support for food production must not undermine our natural \nenvironment.\u201d\n\nFarmer concerns\n\nThe proposed two-tiered support mechanism has caused some concern in the industry, with NFU Cymru calling for \na single framework.\n\nThe union\u2019s president, John Davies, said food production and the delivery of environmental goods and services \nwere not \u201cmutually exclusive\u201d and urged the government to carry out an economic impact assessment of every \nproposal being considered.  \n\n\u201cMeasures that support and incentivise productive agriculture can also positively impact on our environment,\u201d he \nsaid. \u201cThis is why we have advocated a single integrated policy framework with elements supporting productivity, \nthe environment and financial stability.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut Mr Davies approves of a long transition period until 2025. \u201cThis is crucial not just for farming businesses, but for \nthe rural economy that relies on thriving farming businesses, and for our food processing sector who need \nguaranteed supply to ensure their plants can run efficiently,\u201d he said.\n\nFunding\n\nHow the new arrangements will be funded is unclear because Westminster has not provided any detail or \ncommitment to farm support beyond 2022.\n\nMs Griffiths was critical of this failure and has written a joint letter to Defra secretary Michael Gove seeking \u201curgent \nclarity\u201d.\n\n(function(d,s,id){var

\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe battle among tenants to secure land and farms is fierce as supply remains thin in the rental market in England \nand Wales.\n\nSeasonal and long-term lets are oversubscribed, with reports of strong rental values as a result.\n\nThe level of demand was exemplified last month when more than 50 application packs were requested for a small \ngrassland farm in the north of England being let on a five-year farm business tenancy (FBT).\n\nSimilar scenarios are being seen elsewhere and the clamour for land is leading some tenants to agree to \n\u201cunsustainable\u201d rents.\n\nSee also: Farmland buyers search for non-agricultural income streams\n\nThe Tenant Farmers Association has warned applicants not to overstretch themselves.\n\nChief executive George Dunn said he was only aware of a handful of tenancies on offer this year. That included \nNorfolk County Council\u2019s four farms, which were launched in February and received 39 applications.\n\n\u201cI suspect that even if there had been only one unit available, it would have attracted around the same number of \napplicants,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cStrong demand is a feature throughout the country. The fact that it is a slim market does tend to encourage \nindividuals to bid levels of rent that are far in excess of what would be sustainable in terms of the finance of the \nbusiness.\u201d\n\nCraig Brough, associate director at H&H Land and Property, said average prices for seasonal grass lets have \nincreased.\n\nHis firm has seen tough competition for longer-term opportunities too, evidenced by a five-year FBT on 135 acres of \ngrass he let earlier this year amid strong interest.\n\n\u201cWhat is really significant is the level of applications from young farmers wanting to start up their first tenancy.\n\n\u201cWith so many more applicants than there are farms or land to let, it is so important for those applying to rent a farm \nto ensure they make their business plan stand out among the crowded field.\n\n\n\u201cTo even make it as far as the interview stage you must spend time, take advice and present a well-prepared \nbusiness plan that is sustainable and realistic.\u201d\n\nValues and duration\n\nBaileys and Partners director Ed Bailey said negotiations held over farm rents in Wales were not necessarily \nincreasing, despite strong demand.   \n\nLandlords\u2019 agents, he said, argue that the market supports relatively high rentals for marginal land, while tenants \nsay uncertainty surrounding future support mechanisms give reason to support static or falling rents.\n\n\u201cSuch differences in opinion normally fuel intervention by third-party rental determination, but the market appears \nstill to be opting instead to settle by reaching compromise,\u201d Mr Bailey said.\n\nOn tenancy duration, CAAV secretary and adviser Jeremy Moody said average lengths have risen in the past two \nyears.\n\n\u201cI think there is a slight shift towards longer tenancies, which experience tells us is what happens during times of \nturbulence relating to support mechanisms,\u201d he said. \n\nRemoving seasonal agreements from the equation, Mr Moody said the average FBT duration is about six years.\n\nOn the market now\n\nOne of the few large estates currently offering a six-year FBT is the Beachborough Estate, north-west of Folkestone \nin Kent.\n\nTenders must be submitted by 1 June to BTF Partnership for the 743-acre farm, which has 441 acres of arable land \nand 302 acres of woodland.\n\nBerrys has about 80 acres of land available to rent on a short-term grazing licence at Battlefield, Shrewsbury.\n\nThe mowing and grazing land is in one block with six enclosures, and has good road access off the A53.\n\nMatthew Anwyl, managing partner of Berrys, says the long winter and forage shortage will heighten interest.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nNottinghamshire farmer Trevor Needham is successfully using beef cattle to improve the health of his hungry \nsandland soils, lifting cereal yields in the process.\n\nBringing grass leys into the rotation has resulted in valuable savings in fertiliser use over the 1,800ha that Mr \nNeedham farms, producing high-value carrots as well as cereals, oilseed rape, sugar beet and permanent pasture.\n\nMr Needham, general farm manager for the Howard Farms business based at Little Morton Farm, near Retford, \nexplains why having such healthy soils is important to the farm.\n\n\u201cWithout good soil profiles, profits will be hard to achieve and being a sandland farm, we\u2019re very conscious of \nhaving damaged soil structures through irrigation and root cropping,\" he says.\n\nThe inclusion of cattle began in 2003 and by 2012, they became integral to the arable rotation. Now more than \n1,400 cattle are deployed, including followers, fatteners and a suckler herd of 400.\n\nFarm Facts\n\nArea: 1,821ha\n\n\n\nPrincipal crop is carrots. Other crops grown are winter wheat, winter barley, spring barley, oilseed rape, sugar beet, \nrotational grass and permanent pasture\n\n20 full-time employees\n\nFifth generation of Howard family now farming at Little Morton Farm\n\nHome to 23 John Deere tractors\n\nWhere grass leys have been introduced into the arable rotations, there has been a significant rise in earthworm \nnumbers and improvement in soil structure, especially from the second year onwards.\n\nWhy cattle?\n\nMr Needham says the whole farm is now in HLS (High Level Stewardship) environmental agreements and that \ncattle had seemed the most suitable option for improving soil health.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve looked at other options, but we don\u2019t feel sheep bring tremendous benefits, in terms of grass growth, as they \ntend to overgraze,\" he says.\n\n\u201cFor small animals, they can do a tremendous amount of damage on a long-term pasture, whereas cattle are far \ngentler with the grass. We use short rotation paddock grazing so the grasses remain strong and robust. They just fit \nall systems that we want at the moment.\u201d\n\nRotations\n\nThe most profitable crop grown on the farm is carrots. Howard Farms is a major player in the UK carrot industry, \nfocusing on the Chantenay brand.\n\nIt functions in a one-in-eight to one-in-ten-year rotation, depending on rental and stewardship requirements.\n\nIn between carrot crops, the focus is on putting nutrition and structure back into the soil, allowing it more time to \nrecover, to give the next crop of carrots a stronger chance of producing profitable yields.\n\n\u201cNormally we\u2019re working on a three- to four-year grass ley period and we\u2019re pretty confident that will sort out any \ngrassweed problems,\u201d he says. \u201cIdeally, we\u2019ll tend to grow two straw crops, prior to the carrots,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvantages\n\nMr Needham says he believes cereal yield have probably risen by up to 2.5t/ha since cattle arrived on the farm. He \nalso highlights further benefits of using less bagged fertiliser and utilising organic manure produced by the cattle.\n\nPros\n\nSoil health improvement\n\nAbility to stretch the rotation\n\nUtilises labour better during winter, as staff are given stock duties (feeding, fencing etc)\n\nCons\n\n When they get out of fields!\n\nOften receive noise and smell complaints from public and there's also a danger of animals escaping on to fast \nmoving roads\n\n\n\n Through HLS, the requirements mean you can\u2019t always do the things you want to, to move the business forward\n\nThe cattle create 500-600t of manure each year, with a further 1,000t of pig manure bought in annually. Being able \nable to spread it across the land has helped to make the soils more resilient, and has reduced the use of inorganic \nfertilisers.\n\nPreviously, sugar beet grown on the light land at Little Morton would suffer from a drought period in August, but \nsince applying manure in front of crops, droughts have been avoided as the manure helps the soil retain moisture.\n\nMr Needham admits that one of the biggest problems with organic manure is the transport cost and that application \nis not as even across fields, compared with a fertiliser spreader.\n\nSetting-up costs\n\nCost is a key factor that will put many growers off the idea of introducing livestock on to their land, with funds \nneeded for items such as fencing, feeding and supplying water to each field.\n\nMr Needham says the HLS schemes helped with the set-up costs, providing subsidies towards all the water pipes, \ntroughs and fencing, although he highlights that enterprises need to stand on their own feet and not rely on \nsubsidies.\n\nHe has been able to introduce catch crops, based on cereal/legume mixes, to provide a late autumn bite for the \ncattle and keep growing plants to help improve soil structure rather than leaving bare stubble.\n\nMike Green, environmental stewardship manager for the agrochemicals giant BASF, believes the Howards Farm \nbusiness has been successful in introducing cattle and sees environmental schemes, such as HLS, as important to \nfarmers.\n\n\u201cTrevor has looked at the primary crop, carrots, and the barriers for making it more successful, realising that both \nthe fertility and structure of soils needed improving. They\u2019ve decided to bring in cattle and I think they\u2019ve done a \npretty good job,\" he says.\n\n\"It\u2019s important not to enter them solely for the extra money and subsidies, but instead focus on the long-term effects \nto your business and how a new enterprise will fit in to your current farming strategy,\u201d Mr Green says.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nSustained demand for UK beef, combined with a reduction in prime cattle throughputs, have firmed prices further.\n\nThere was a 3% drop in prime cattle slaughterings to 31,600 head for the week ending 15 June compared with the \nprevious week. The figure is also down by 2% on the same week a year ago.\n\nSee also: Tight supplies predicted to preserve Scots meat prices\n\nAllied to reasonable demand, the GB all-prime average price strengthened by a further 1.33p/kg compared with \nprices a week earlier, to average 370.26p/kg, said AHDB Beef and Lamb.\n\nThe main driver for the price rise and fall-off in throughput were steers, which saw slaughterings decline by 6% \nweek-on-week and R4L specification average prices rise by more than 4p to average 384.5p/kg.\n\nThe latest increase means cattle prices have risen by 16p/kg in the past four months.\n\nHowever, the AHDB said values had started to narrow year-on-year against the strong uplift seen in summer 2017 \nand could come under more pressure as throughput recovered with grass-finished cattle coming on stream.\n\n\n\nIn contrast to steers, R4L heifers slipped by 1p to 381.3p/kg, and R3 young bulls fell by less than a penny to stand \nat 365.9p/kg.\n\nHowever, the market for cows has remained robust this week, bolstered by demand for manufacturing-type beef \nand the continuing overall high for prime cattle.\n\nDespite a throughput rise of 700 head to 10,100 for the week, the overall average cow price rose by 3p to average \n267.2p/kg.\n\nThe demand for manufacturing beef has also driven a rise in imports over the first four months of 2018 compared \nwith the same period in 2017. Total imports of fresh/frozen beef reached 91,000t, up 6% on January to the end of \nApril 2017.\n\nImports from France in the first four months of 2018 showed the largest proportional rise at 88% against year-earlier \nstatistics, to total 1,200t. The vast majority of imported beef (70%) came from Ireland and this also rose by 6.5% to \n65,000t in the first four months of 2018.\n\nHowever, while the UK imported more beef from certain countries up to the end of April, the period also saw a rise \nin exports of home-grown product against those four months in 2017.\n\nAHDB analyst Tom Forshaw said fresh/frozen beef exports up to 30 April totalled 38,700t (+17%).\n\n\u201cIreland was the biggest export destination for the UK, commanding over 30% of the market share of exports,\u201d Mr \nForshaw said.\n\nIn the first four months of 2018, UK total fresh/frozen beef exports to the republic totalled 13,500t (+33%).\n\n\u201cThe reason for the uplift was cattle supplies in Ireland have tightened, which could support demand for UK beef,\u201d \nMr Forshaw forecast.\n\nThe value of total UK fresh/frozen beef exports also increased, to total \u00a3144m (+21%) in the first four months of \n2018.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nUnderstanding the financial and physical performance of your business is vital to make accurate management \ndecisions and maximise profitability.\n\nBenchmarking for the first time can be daunting given the array of information available, but Sentry\u2019s rural business \nadvisor Alec Smith says even relatively simple measures will reveal worthwhile information that may prompt more \ndetailed analysis.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get hung up on detail or worry about getting everything 100% right straight away. The important thing is to \nstart somewhere and work up from there,\u201d he says.\n\nBenchmarking tips\n\nKeep it simple to start\n\nBe honest and open to advice\n\nApportion costs correctly\n\nLook at results over several years\n\nCompare your results with others\n\n\n\nMr Smith highlights six key areas for arable farmers to focus on:\n\n1. Seed, fertiliser and sprays\n\nA traditional measure of variable costs on arable farms, this is a good way of checking expenditure on the main \ncrop inputs is not too high.\n\nFigures are generally easy to collate and costs can be calculated on an area basis (as below) or a tonne by dividing \ncosts by average yield.\n\n\u201cOur costs were lower than many in 2017, which is mainly due to our buying strategy rather than using less. \nBenchmarking isn\u2019t just about saving costs, but ensuring costs are proportional to output,\u201d says Mr Smith.\n\nSee also: Key cross compliance and greening dates by region \n\nComparing costs on a field-by-field basis also helps evaluate whether poorer areas are costing too much for that \nlevel of output and whether it may be better to put  another crop to use, such as environmental stewardship.\n\n2. Fungicide cost/tonne\n\nAnother way of checking key input costs are in balance with output is to calculate total fungicide spend on a \ntonnage basis.\n\nThe average across Sentry\u2019s wheat area last year was \u00a311.40/t, but the top 25% spent \u00a39.60/t.\n\nBreaking information down to a block of land or individual field basis helps identify whether expenditure is \nproportional to yield.\n\n\u201cSome farms use the same fungicide strategy across one crop, but ideally it should be tailored to yield potential,\u201d \nsays Mr Smith.\n\n3. Labour and machinery costs/hectare\n\nLabour and machinery costs can be the hardest to tackle, but must not be overlooked.\n\nAll aspects should be included, which for labour includes the cost of full/part-time staff, and a value for any family \nlabour.\n\nMachinery costs depend on the farming system, but typically include spares and repairs, fuel, depreciation, hire \ncharges, service agreements, tax and insurance.\n\nAverage labour costs on Sentry farms in 2017 were \u00a3140-145/ha, with the top quartile nearer \u00a3110/ha.\n\nAverage machinery costs were \u00a3250/ha (see chart), down to \u00a3220/ha for the top performers.\n\n4. Enterprising\n\nFor accurate benchmarking data, costs should be attributed to the appropriate enterprise to ensure nothing is \nmissed or overestimated.\n\nFor example, if machinery or labour is used across arable and livestock enterprises, a representative proportion of \nthat item\u2019s total cost should be assigned to each enterprise.\n\nOr, if contract harvesting 200ha alongside 200ha of your own land, only half of the combine costs would be \nattributed to the farm\u2019s land, with the remainder against the contracting.\n\n5. Look for data trends\n\n\n\nGiven the seasonality of farming, it is dangerous to base assumptions or decisions on just one year\u2019s data.\n\nEqually, it can be easy to make excuses for poor performance in a single season, so several years of data \u2013 at least \nthree, preferably more \u2013 are needed before underlying trends can be seen and acted upon.\n\n6. Input balance\n\nOne measure Sentry uses to compare its farms is to rank total variable costs and output with an \u2018input balance\u2019 \npercentage.\n\nCosts are calculated for every farm on a per hectare basis, then each one is ranked from 0 to 100, with 0 \nrepresenting the highest cost and 100 the lowest.\n\nOutput (yield x price) is also ranked, with 0 representing the lowest and 100 the highest.\n\nAdding the two figures together should total close to 100% if expenditure and output are in balance (ie, high input, \nhigh output or vice versa).\n\nA low figure indicates a potential problem - eg, costs are too high or output too low for that level of spend.\n\nBenchmarking at Sentry\n\nSentry covers 16,300ha of arable land and has been benchmarking since 1988.\n\nThe company now uses the AHDB Farmbench service to collate data before analysing its own results, comparing \nthem across Sentry farms and with the rest of the industry.\n\nFarmbench is an online benchmarking system that allows farmers to enter whole-farm or enterprise-specific \nbusiness data that can then be compared against others through aggregated and anonymised results.\n\nIt uses three broad performance indicators: financial information (eg, sales, costs and margins), technical data such \nas fertiliser use, and production data (eg, crop yields). Criteria can be on an area or tonnage basis.\n\nResults are fed back to growers through discussion groups or individual reports.\n\nSentry average costs, harvest 2017 (\u00a3/ha)\n\n \n\nSeed (inc home-saved)\n\nFertiliser\n\nSprays\n\nWinter wheat\n\n67.60\n\n169.30\n\n242.30\n\nSpring barley\n\n74.10\n\n133.50\n\n\n\n142.40\n\nWinter oilseed rape\n\n76.00\n\n188.00\n\n207.80\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe financial benefits of no-tillage farming are set to be outlined by agricultural accountant Gary Markham later this \nmonth. They will show that clear savings can be made in agrochemicals, fuel and working capital.\n\nUsing the results from some 12 arable no-tillage farms in East Anglia, he has recorded the financial results from \ntheir no-till approach compared with conventional farming from the 2017 harvest.\n\nHe will be presenting his findings at the second day of the Groundswell event in Hertfordshire in late June, and give \nhis views on whether no-tillage is financially viable.\n\nSee also: Farm\u2019s self-imposed insecticide ban leads to healthier crops\n\nMr Markham has been benchmarking this group of 12, who have been practising no-tillage crop establishment for \nseveral years, and comparing them with the 40,000ha of conventionally farmed land which he manages financially.\n\nVariable costs\n\nBig savings in agrochemicals from a no-tillage approach helped bring variable costs down sharply for the group of \n12, with the major cost savings coming from a lower spend on herbicides compared with conventional \nestablishment techniques.\n\nFixed costs were clearly lower, with machinery capital per hectare showing a large reduction due to using a one-\npass direct drilling compared to minimal tillage or ploughing methods, with some showing savings of as much as \none-third.\n\nLess machinery use led directly to big reductions in fuel used, with the diesel costs of the no-tillage farms showing \nsavings of nearly 50%.\n\nNo financial account was taken of the increase in soil health and other environmental benefits which may have \ncome from using no-tillage farming.\n\nAnnual event \n\nThe hosts for the third year of this annual event will be brothers John and Paul Cherry, who run a 1,000ha farm in \nnorth-east Hertfordshire, just south of Baldock.\n\nThe farm gave up ploughing in favour of minimal tillage in the year 2000, prompted by the desire to save on diesel, \nmetal fatigue and time, and then just over a decade later took the plunge and went fully no-tillage.\n\nThey saw their chalky boulder clay soils were more workable and earthworm numbers and soil organic matter \nincreased. They also stopped using insecticides three years ago and increased cattle numbers and expanded their \nherbal leys.\n\nThis all chimes with Michael Gove\u2019s enthusiasm for no-tillage techniques and promoting the \u201cpublic good\u201d that these \nmethods can bring in terms of more sustainable healthy soils, according to the Defra secretary.\n\n\n\nGary Markham is director farms and estates for Land Family Business\n\nGroundswell 2018\n\nThe two-day event is focused on no-tillage techniques, soil regeneration and the value of livestock in arable and \nmixed farming systems. It features high-profile speakers and field-scale direct drilling demonstrations. The third \nannual event will be held on 27-28 June 2018 at John and Paul Cherry's Lannock Manor Farm, Weston, Hitchin, \nHertfordshire SG4 7EE.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe number of anaerobic digesters in the UK is being forecast to rise by up to 13% as the guaranteed price paid for \nenergy generation is set to increase to its highest level since 2016.\n\nLegislation set to make its way through Parliament on 22 May will pave the way for the restoration of tariffs of up to \n5.6p for each kilowatt hour of renewable heat generated.\n\nThis is an increase of 2.3p on the current renewable heat tariff price for biomethane injection-type digesters that \nproduce a flammable gas from breaking down organic wastes such as slurry or purpose-grown energy crops.\n\nSee also: Grants available for farm energy storage and distribution\n\nThe gas is then burned to produce renewable heat or to generate electricity, with nutrient-rich fertiliser also \ngenerated as a by-product.\n\nThere are currently 308 operational agricultural anaerobic digesters in the UK, and the Anaerobic Digestion and \nBioresources Association (Adba) is forecasting the price rise could tempt as many as 40 more units online in the \nnext two years.\n\n \n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var \ni=\"InfogramEmbeds\",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?\"http:\":\"https:\";if(/^\\/{2}/.test(s)&&(\ns=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var \na=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,\"script\",\"infogram-\nasync\",\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\");\n\nNew plants that are eligible for the increased price will then be able to lock in that tariff level for 20 years.\n\nThe price rise has been on the agenda since early 2016, but the snap general election called by Theresa May \nseverely delayed the passage of the law change required.\n\nCharlotte Morton, chief executive of Adba, said: \u201cAD is already reducing gas imports by 2% and has the potential to \nreduce them by as much as 16%.\n\n\u201cWith emissions from heat accounting for one-third of all UK greenhouse gas emissions and no clear government \nstrategy yet identified for decarbonising heat, it\u2019s imperative that the government commits to long-term support for \ngreen gas beyond 2020.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nWeather conditions during harvest in the Scottish Borders are increasingly unpredictable \u2013 the only certainty being \nthat virtually every tonne of grain will need to pass through a dryer. And that\u2019s a costly process.\n\nBut more and more growers across the north of the UK are looking at ways of trimming those costs with all sorts of \nnovel solutions using the latest state-of-the-art tech, common-sense and a bit of initiative.\n\n\nWith a wind turbine and two biomass boilers on their farms in the Scottish Borders, the Hodge family is familiar with \nrenewable energy and the potential revenue it can generate.\n\nBut bringing in income through subsidies is only one side of the story \u2013 the bigger long-term opportunity lies in the \nsavings to be made on energy bills, says Andrew Hodge.\n\nSee also: How to renovate a Master batch grain dryer\n\nFarm Facts\n\nFirm of Thomas Hodge, Rulesmains, Duns, Scottish Borders\n\nFarmed area: 648ha\n\nCropping: Winter wheat 170ha, spring barley 120ha, winter oats 73ha, winter barley 73ha, oilseed rape 60ha, \nspring beans 16ha, rotational grass leys 101ha, permanent pasture 65ha\n\nStock: 100 Angus suckler cows, 60 Simmental X suckler cows, plus 350 followers and bought-in store cattle\n\nSoil: Light sandy loams and areas of heavier clay loam\n\nMachinery:\n\nTractors \u2013 JD 7930, 7820, 6155-R, 6930, 6810, 6610 and 6430\n\nLoader \u2013 JCB 535-60\n\nCombine \u2013 Claas Lexion 750 with 6.7m (22ft) header\n\nSprayer \u2013 2500-litre Kelland Agribuggy with 24m booms\n\nBaler \u2013 McHale F660\n\nDrier \u2013 20t Opico Magna with biomass burner\n\nRenewables: 15kW wind turbine, 90kW and 70kW biomass boilers\n\nStaff: Andrew, Jill and Emma Hodge plus one other full-time and two part-timers at busy times\n\n\u201cFour years ago we installed a 90kW biomass burner here on the home farm to provide heat for the main \nfarmhouse, office, workshop and bungalow,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cAt around \u00a365,000 for the whole installation, it was a big chunk of cash to lay out, but we could see the savings \nwe\u2019d be making on our fuel bills and the income we\u2019d be getting from the RHIs, so we took the long view and bit the \nbullet.\n\n\u201cThere was only one problem: the system would only be working at capacity for about six or seven months of the \nyear. When things warm up through the summer we don\u2019t need the heat in the buildings.\u201d\n\nHowever, on the farm there was another big user of heat energy when everything else was running cool \u2013 the grain \ndryer.\n\nSwitching from gas\n\nAt the time, the Hodges were using a gas-fired 12t Opico GT dryer, but with more arable acres it was struggling to \nmatch the capacity of the farm\u2019s larger Claas Lexion 650 combine and it was due for a change.\n\n\n\nHaving had decent reliability from the Opico dryer and good back-up from local dealer John Thorburn just a couple \nof miles away, Mr Hodge was keen to stick with what he knew and ordered a 20t Opico Magna. A diesel-burner, it \noffered the flexibility for the next trick up Mr Hodge\u2019s sleeve.\n\n\u201cI had a plan to site the new dryer in the building next to the biomass burner and rig up some sort of heat exchanger \nto warm the air going in.\n\n\u201cWe had used Renew Green Energy from Galashiels to install a second woodchip boiler to heat the three houses at \nour other farm and they really knew their stuff, so we got them to design a system for the dryer.\u201d\n\nIn simple terms, what is effectively a massive radiator is positioned just outside the grain drier shed.\n\nHot water from the system\u2019s buffer tanks flows through it with electronic valves used to redirect the flow from the \nbuildings\u2019 circuit into the heat exchanger.\n\nConnected by steel ducting to the intake, the dryer fan draws ambient air in through the radiator fins, bringing it up \nto about 50-55C, so the diesel burner is required to kick in much less often.\n\nKeeping things simple\n\nThe beauty of the set-up is that the dryer itself is virtually unmodified. The computer controller prompts the burner to \nkick in on high flame as required and then to throttle back to low flame as it normally would (the only link between \nthe dryer and boiler being a signal to shut off the water pump when the burner cuts out).\n\nThe key difference is that the burner now spends much more time on its low setting, with the biomass boiler \nproviding the lion\u2019s share of the background heat.\n\n\u201cWith the dryer spending more of its time on low flame, we\u2019re seeing a 20-30% saving on our diesel bill.\n\n\u201cWith our quantity of grain to dry \u2013 about 3,000t/year \u2013 that\u2019s well worth having. Together with the RHI payments it \ngenerates, that makes the \u00a38,000 we spent on the set-up easy to justify.\u201d\n\nThe only downside is that the dryer cooling cycle now takes longer than before because the intake air is still drawn \nthrough the heat exchanger for that phase of the operation.\n\nAlthough water is not pumped through the radiator when the dryer goes into cool down mode, it takes a while for all \nthe heat to dissipate out of the core. In reality it\u2019s no problem \u2013 the burners just need to be shut down 10 minutes \nearlier than before.\n\nDespite that, throughputs are pretty impressive \u2013 drawing out 6% moisture, the 20t Magna will deal with five \nbatches in a 24-hour period.\n\nWhat about the feedstock?\n\nFor the last three seasons the business has bought in timber from a local woodland management company, \nstacking it up to dry for a year before having it chipped by a specialist contractor.\n\nHowever, last winter the Hodges had some of the 60ha of woodland at Rulesmains Farm thinned out and now have \na 10-year felling and replanting plan in place to provide a long-term supply of feedstock for the two biomass \nburners.\n\nEach one has a large reception hopper capable of holding 8-9t of woodchip. Once dry it\u2019s not dense at all \u2013 the load \nin a 14t grain trailer only weighs around 4t.\n\nWith the bigger boiler at the home farm running flat out, one hopper load will generally last three to four weeks.\n\n\n\nSelf-feeding, the burner chamber is stocked by a sweeper auger in the bottom of the bin that helps to avoid any \nissues with the material bridging and blocking.\n\n\u201cWith our woodland and wind here in the Borders it makes sense to make use of the natural resources we have at \nour disposal,\u201d says Mr Hodges.\n\n\u201cWe had the biomass boiler sitting there doing very little through the summertime, so it made sense to make a \nrelatively small investment to get it working for us drying grain.\n\n\u201cThe next step is to look at ways of getting the other burner at our other farm paying its way year-round. Without \ngrain storage on site, we\u2019re thinking of converting a silage trailer with a mesh floor to dry woodchip.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA teenager has been diagnosed with the 18th century disease, cowpox after feeding cattle on a farm on the \nWrexham-Cheshire border.\n\nThe unnamed 15-year old contracted the believed-to-be extinct disease when he was bitten by a calf he had been \nfeeding, grazing his skin.\n\nSee also: Buyers guide: 6 options for calf housing compared\n\nHe developed pus-filled lesions on his hands, arms and feet before receiving treatment at the Countess of Chester \nHospital where he was diagnosed with the rare disease.\n\nThis is a very rare occurrence according to the Endell Vet Group\u2019s Keith Cutler, who says he hasn\u2019t seen a case of \ncowpox in almost a quarter of a century.\n\nTips on how to handle a cowpox\n\nThe risk of getting cowpox remains very low, however, as a precaution it is best to:\n\nAvoid contact with animals with suspected or confirmed cowpox, especially so if you have a suppressed immune \nsystem\n\nWear gloves and observe strict hygiene precautions when handling any affected animals\n\nAvoid being in contact with cats and rodents on farms if possible\n\nIf you suspect you may have cowpox, go to your GP and explain carefully the likely nature of exposure (for \nexample, you work on a farm with livestock)\n\nSource: Public Health Wales\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s strange to hear about cowpox at all, let alone in a calf,\u201d says Mr Cutler.\n\n\u201cThe disease used to be occasionally seen in dairy cows where roughly circular scabby lesions would appear on \nteats which would become reddened and inflamed before scabbing over and becoming brown and crusty.\u201d\n\nHowever, Mr Cutler says improved parlour hygiene and udder cleanliness had all but eradicated the pox virus \ndecades ago.\n\nHygiene reminder\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be overdramatic about this but now is a useful time to remind dairy farmers about the \nimportance of maintaining high parlour hygiene standards.\n\n\n\n\u201cFarmers should always wear the right personal protective equipment such as waterproof trousers and always wash \nhands before eating or touching your mouth,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe incident, which the boy fully recovered from after six weeks, occurred three months ago, but only recently came \nto light after the boy\u2019s doctor alerted colleagues at a recent medical convention.\n\nWhat happened to cowpox?\n\nCowpox was prevalent in milkmaids in the 18th century, who would catch the disease from the infected teats of \ndairy cows.\n\nThe introduction of industrialised farming methods saw an end to hand milking, effectively eradicating the cowpox \nin Europe.\n\nHowever, the disease does have a presence in the UK, carried by rodents and stray cats and is most prevalent at \nthe end of the summer and early autumn.\n\nIn 1796, English doctor Edward Jenner recognised dairy farmers and milkmaids had developed an immunity to the \nmuch deadlier smallpox virus, which killed one in five carriers.\n\nDr Jenner developed a smallpox vaccine from the fluid of a milkmaid\u2019s infected cowpox lesion, in the process \ncreating modern-day vaccinations.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nSuffolk grower Andrew Colchester has taken a big step towards banishing blackgrass on his farm by radically \nchanging his cultivation strategy and beefing up his herbicide programme.\n\nHe had seen the pernicious grassweed take a firm hold on his farm during the past decade, hitting his yields. He \nrealised a dramatic change was needed last autumn.\n\nOn one trial field he abandoned his plough, delayed his winter wheat drilling and used a comprehensive herbicide \nspray policy and now he is hard-pressed to find any blackgrass this spring.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just rely on chemicals, as we have tried this over the past 10 years and it does not work,\u201d he tells Farmers \nWeekly.\n\nNew approach\n\nTherefore, he gave his usual plough and power harrow approach a break this season for his chosen 7ha field and \nwent for a light cultivation, drilled it with winter wheat on 16 October and held his breath.\n\nSee also: Autumn wheat drilling delayed to battle blackgrass\n\nIn hindsight, it was probably the worst season to try a new approach, as his late drilling was followed by one of the \nwettest winters on record. This stressed his wheat plants, but now, well into a warm spring, they have recovered.\n\n\u201cI am looking for blackgrass, but I can't see any and I am more confident that I am not going to see it this season,\u201d \nhe says.\n\nMr Colchester farms 75ha at Church Farm, Thrandeston, north Suffolk, two miles south of Diss, on sandy clay \nloams that can run to heavier land, where the blackgrass flourishes.\n\nEstablishing cereals\n\n\n\nHe is a third-generation farmer, taking over the land from his father in 1991, and his traditional approach to \nestablish winter cereals is a plough-press followed by a power harrrow-drill combination, with everything in the \nground before his birthday on 28 September.\n\nBut as he contemplated spraying off some of his winter wheat last summer because of a heavy blackgrass \ninfestation, he knew he had to change, and change quickly.\n\nSo with the help of Hugo Pryce, local agronomy manager at agrochemical giant BASF, he decided to take radical \nsteps on his chosen field, as part of the group's trial arable weed control programme.\n\nThe wet weather at harvest 2017 meant the combining of the previous spring barley crop and the baling and \ncarting of straw had left the field badly damaged by machinery.\n\nLow soil disturbance\n\nSo a disc-tine-roller low-soil-disturbance cultivator was used to level the field on 9 September. The stubble was left \nto green up and then sprayed off with glyphosate three to four days before drilling with a low-soil-disturbance disc \ndrill.\n\nA comprehensive herbicide programme, costing up to \u00a380/ha, was used on the trial field, including pre-emergence \nchemistry aimed at controlling blackgrass.\n\nOne expert brought in to advise on this arable weed control trial was independent soils and cultivations specialist \nPhilip Wright.\n\nHis first comment was that there was too much ploughing on the farm, as the key to improving soil structure and \nalso controlling blackgrass was low-disturbance operations.\n\nUse of plough\n\nHe advises to plough only once in every four to five years, because if the plough is used every year, growers are \nresetting their soil structure each year and bringing up buried blackgrass seed.\n\nThe Sumo disc-tine-roller cultivator operated at a depth of 175-200mm, and was ideal to loosen the ground, but not \nbring blackgrass seed to the surface. The Weaving disc drill worked well due to its low-soil-disturbance \ncharacteristics.\n\nIf another winter cereal is planned after the wheat, Mr Wright advises following the same route as before, and the \nfirst cultivation can even by omitted if the harvest is dry and the stubble is in good condition.\n\n\"This has been encouraging for soil structure and encouraging for grassweed control, so it is a win-win situation,\" \nsays Mr Wright.\n\nChurch Farm, Thrandeston\n\nPrevious cropping\n\nSpring barley\n\nDrilling date \n\n16 October 2017\n\nVariety\n\nShabras\n\n\n\nSeed rate\n\n190kg/ha\n\nHerbicides\n\nPre-drilling: 2.5 litres/ha glyphosate 360 + Companion Gold (drift retardent)\n\nPost-drilling: 15kg/ha Avadex (tri-allate)\n\nPeri-emergence: 4.0 litres/ha Trooper (flufenacet + pendimethalin) + 0.2 litres/ha Hurricane (diflufenican).

imazamox + metazachlor\n\nCleravo - imazamox + quinmerac\n\nAstrokerb - aminopyralid and propyzamide\n\nBenefits\n\nThe benefit of being able to hit broad-leafed brassica weeds such as charlock, runch and hedge-mustard became \napparent in just one season.\n\nWithout the competition from the weeds, crops at Wilcote yielded 0.5t/ha more than at the 560ha Swinbrook Estate.\n\nThe following season the weed problem reached a critical point at this second estate, when half a field of rapeseed \nhad to be mowed out to get on top of the charlock problem.\n\nLast season was the first growing 100% Clearfield across the whole farm, and the results are encouraging - \nSwinbrook achieved 3.4t/ha, while Wilcote managed 3.6t/ha.\n\nWhile last year\u2019s crop has yet to be sold in a pool, Mr Hogsbjerg expects to achieve an average gross margin of \n\u00a3470/ha, based on a price of \u00a3320/t.\n\nWith Clearfield varieties delivering lower yields than those on the Recommended List, and being fairly expensive to \ngrow, many farmers choose to limit their use to the fields with the biggest weed problem.\n\nBut the severity of the weed problem at Swinbrook means it is actually more profitable to grow 100% Clearfield \nvarieties.\n\n\n\nMr Hogsbjerg admits these yields aren\u2019t great, but are a huge improvement on the 2.5t/ha the farm was achieving \nfive or six years ago when crops were failing due to charlock.\n\n\u201cRape yields improve year-on-year. They are still not where they should be, but we have no charlock and crops are \nestablishing.\u201d\n\nWithout the competition, crops are better developed, as they are intercepting more light. This season he is \nexpecting to yield about 4t/ha.\n\nAlong with the weeds, Clearfield herbicides are also clearing up rapeseed volunteers, which is in turn bringing down \nthe erucic acid levels of the crop, which have been a problem in the past.\n\nPrevious approach\n\nA close rotation of rapeseed of just one in two, or one in three, combined with mild winters lacking the necessary \nfrosts to kill off weeds, allowed the charlock and runch situation to get out of control.\n\nIn the past Mr Hogsbjerg always grew DeKalb varieties, using bifenox under an extension of authorisation for minor \nuse to hit the charlock.\n\nBut while chemical control works well with a good frost, the resilience of mature charlock means it needs two doses \nto kill it, and if the weather turned, the second dose was often missed.\n\nThis allowed the charlock to go to seed and means that in many of the fields, the charlock situation is such that Mr \nHogsbjerg could not rely on frosts to clear up.\n\nCurrent crop\n\nThis season the oilseed rape drilling was completed by 28 August. It was min-tilled as shallow as possible into \nwheat stubble to also incorporate sewage sludge using a Horsch Sprinter fitted with 5in Dutch openers.\n\nIt was rolled once or twice depending on conditions, and a pre-emergence spray missed unless there was a major \nissue with weeds.\n\nThe crop then received a standard post-emergence of Vulcan or Centurion Max for grassweed control.\n\nMr Hogsbjerg uses two of the post-emergence Clearfield herbicides available - Cleranda and Cleravo \u2013 to tackle a \nrange of broad-leaved weeds and grassweeds, and also take out rapeseed volunteers.\n\nThese tend not to need to be followed with Astrokerb unless there is a major issue with poppies.\n\nThis herbicide programme is achieving 95% control of weeds, he says, and a complete rotation round both estates \nshould ultimately solve the weed problem.\n\nRotation change\n\nAlongside moving to herbicide-resistant varieties, in the past three years the rotation has been broadened as the \nfarm tries to find other crops that will be profitable.\n\nAt the Swinbrook Estate the rotation now consists of wheat, barley, rapeseed, wheat, and then spring wheat or \nbeans. Wheat, rapeseed, wheat and spring beans are grown at Wilcote.\n\nAlthough yields are increasing and weeds are being eradicated, the switch to Clearfield varieties has not been \nentirely plain sailing.\n\n\n\nLast season Mr Hogsbjerg grew Clearfield Imperial at Wilcote and Veritas at Swinbrook. While Veritas was meant to \nhave the highest potential of the two, the crop was disappointing, at it was slow to get growing in the spring.\n\nThis year he has switched to Impersario at Wilcote and Imperial at Swinbrook.\n\nAs a result of the disappointing crop, Mr Hogsbjerg is conducting a field-scale on-farm trial of Clearfield varieties in \norder to select the ones that will give the highest yields.\n\nHe is looking for vigour in autumn and spring and the earliest harvest, and says that while Clearfield varieties \nweren\u2019t great in the past, they have been improved.\n\nSix Clearfield varieties are being trialled in hectare plots \u2013 Imperial, Phoenix, Pleurax, Veritas and two unnamed \npioneer varieties.\n\nOf the six trials, Pleurax has the earliest vigour and is the most likely variety to be sown next year.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nWales has seen a 13% rise in new herd incidents of bovine TB despite a raft of new disease controls.\n\nIn the 12 months to March 2018, figures release by Defra show there were 785 new herd incidents compared with \n696 in the previous year.\n\nThe sharpest rise was in Clwyd \u2013 an area classified as Intermediate (North) within the Welsh government\u2019s new TB \nzones \u2013 where there were 64 new herd incidents compared with 45 over the previous 12-month period, a rise of \n42% for that area.\n\nSee also: Defra to extend badger cull to low-risk area\n\nFarmers in the region, including milk producer Dei Davies (pictured), are concerned by that big increase.\n\nHe has never had a case of TB and suggests that more must be done to protect herds. \u201cIt is very worrying that it \nseems to be getting closer. Not enough is being done to address the issue in wildlife,\u201d said Mr Davies, of Moor \nFarm, Flintshire.\n\n\u201cWe are clear and don\u2019t want to do anything to upset the eco balance of that, but in areas where that is not the case \nmore needs to be done. The wildlife controls seems to be working in England.\n\n\u201cBadgers are the disease carrier that people worry about, but there has been an outbreak of TB around Denbigh \nwhere there are a lot of wild deer, which is worrying.\u201d\n\nRising incidents\n\nAll regions of Wales have experienced a rise in new herd incidents, apart from upland mid-Wales where the number \nwas static at 64.\n\nFarmers have also lost more animals from their herds. The number slaughtered in the 12 months to March 2018 \nwas 10,226, an increase of 3%.\n\nIn total, 5.7% of registered herds were under TB restriction during that period, up from 5.1%.\n\nThe issue was raised in the Senedd on Wednesday (13 June) by AM Nick Ramsay whose Monmouth constituency, \nwhich falls in the High East TB region, experienced a 23% rise in new cases.\n\nHe too wants to see more done to control TB in wildlife.\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s one thing to deal with the rates of infection within livestock \u2013 that\u2019s got to be done \u2013 but also within the wider \nwildlife reservoir and in the wider environment, as well,\u201d he said.\n\nIn October 2017, the government introduced new measures for tackling TB, including more cattle testing and \ntougher rules around moving and selling cattle for farmers in high-risk areas, such as Pembrokeshire, \nCarmarthenshire and along the border with England.\n\nThe government urged caution regarding the latest figures.\n\n\u201cIt is important to take caution when observing short-term trends in TB statistics and we need to allow time for any \nimpacts to take effect before we draw any meaningful conclusions,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nNew bovine TB herd incidents\n\n \n\n12 months to end March 2017\n\n12 months to end March 2018\n\nYear-on-year change\n\nWales\n\n696\n\n785\n\n13%\n\nEngland\n\n3,858\n\n3,683\n\n-5%\n\nScotland\n\n36\n\n39\n\n 8%\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe new Agriculture Bill setting out the policy framework for supporting UK agriculture post Brexit is due to be \npublished next month and is unlikely to include any plan to cap payments to larger farmers.\n\nThe surprise announcement was made by Defra secretary Michael Gove, giving evidence to the cross-party \nEnvironment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) committee in Westminster on Wednesday (13 June).\n\nSee also: Cereals campaign aims to put arable farming top of political agenda\n\nIt had previously been suggested the bill would not see the light of day until the autumn, leaving little time for proper \nscrutiny before the UK leaves the European Union in March 2019  \n\n\n\nBut Mr Gove told the Efra committee the aim was now to publish the bill \u201cbefore the summer recess\u201d and civil \nservants were scrutinising the 44,000 responses to the Health and Harmony consultation to decide what it should \ncontain.\n\nCapping to be lifted\n\nAsked by committee chairman Neil Parish whether these responses were having any effect, Mr Gove revealed he \nwas already reconsidering capping as a result.\n\n\u201cRight at the very beginning, I\u2019d argued that one of the inherent unfairnesses in the BPS system was that it \nallocated money on the basis of size of agricultural holding to people who were already very wealthy,\u201d he said. \u201cI \nthought the right thing to do was to have some form of cap.  \n\n\u201cBut one of the things that has come though very strongly in the evidence from people across farming is that they \nwould prefer there to be the same percentage reduction for all farmers who are in receipt of BPS. A strong \nargument has been made and we are discussing it with officials in the department.\u201d\n\nConservative MP Julian Sturdy suggested a straight cut for all farmers would have a bigger effect on smaller-scale \nfarmers, who are much more reliant on subsidies than larger-scale farmers, especially tenants.\n\nBut Mr Gove stressed that, while no definitive decision had yet been made, the message about capping was \ncoming from both large- and small-scale farmers.\n\nConversations\n\nHe referred to conversations he had had just this week with County Durham upland sheep farmers, who favoured \neveryone taking a small slice off their BPS payments.\n\n\u201cTheir argument was that everyone has to recognise that change is going to come, so therefore a small reduction \nfor everyone means that nobody can be under any illusions that they have to think about what that change might \nbe,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Gove also suggested there could be some lower threshold, below which no BPS money would be taken during a \ntransition phase. It was also possible that larger farmers could face slightly bigger BPS cuts than smaller farmers, \nthough he was keen to avoid overcomplicating things.\n\nConservative MP Caroline Johnson questioned whether cutting BPS for all would restrict the involvement in any \nnew agri-environment scheme to larger farmers, who had the resource to go through the application process. \n\nBut Mr Gove rejected this suggestion. \u201cThere are some farmers \u2013 for example, some large tenant farms \u2013 where the \nbusiness is in receipt of a significant BPS payment, but is not a supremely well capitalised or extremely profitable \nbusiness. So it is not automatically the case that a large BPS payment correlates to someone who is wealthy.\u201d\n\nCountryside Stewardship not fit for purpose\n\nDefra's delivery of the Countryside Stewardship scheme has been weak and this is undermining confidence in both \ncurrent and future schemes, Mr Gove told the Efra committee.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest problems we have is that the imperfect delivery of Countryside Stewardship means that people \nwho would otherwise be undertaking environmental enhancement are not in the scheme and are wary of joining \nfuture schemes as well,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Efra committee chairman Neil Parish, this was absolutely fundamental to the government being able to \ndeliver its environmental objectives.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we are going to take the farming community with us, they are going to need more confidence than they have at \nthe moment in the agencies\u2019 ability to deliver,\" he said. \"Yet there is very little confidence on the ground because of \nthe time and complexity involved, and the fact they don\u2019t hear from the agency for months.\u201d\n\nMr Parish suggested existing agri-environment schemes (such as Entry Level Stewardship and Higher Level \nStewardship) should be extended until the government\u2019s new Environmental  Land Management Scheme was up \nand running, effectively by-passing Countryside Stewardship.\n\nMr Gove revealed there were changes on the way soon that would ease some of the problems.\n\nHe also acknowledged the input of the CLA with its recent Land Management Contract proposal. While insisting this \nmight not be the exact model Defra comes out with, the ideas it contained were \u201cvery useful\u201d.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nMore than 100 food and farming organisations have joined forces to call for a Brexit deal that works for UK \nagriculture.\n\nThe UK Food Supply Chain Manifesto sets out key principles they believe can help ensure Brexit is a success for \nthe supply of food in the UK.\n\nIt has been drawn up by organisations representing farmers producing the raw ingredients and their suppliers, right \nthrough to manufacturers and retailers.\n\nSee also: Farm support phase-out must be fair for all - NFU\n\nPublished on Monday (28 May), the document sets out the need for positive outcomes on trade, labour, regulation \nand domestic agricultural policy.\n\nManifesto principles\n\nThe manifesto calls on the government to:\n\nMaintain free and frictionless trade with the EU, and secure the benefits of existing EU preferential trade \narrangements, at least until government can replace them with acceptable alternative arrangements\n\nEnsure ongoing access to an adequate supply of permanent and seasonal labour\n\nContinue to promote food production through agricultural policy alongside our existing high environmental, health \nand animal welfare standards\n\nEnsure businesses operate under an efficient and proportionate regulatory system that is centred on scientific \nevaluation and that incentivises innovation and competitiveness.\n\nIt was signed by representatives from 105 organisations and sent to prime minister Theresa May \u2013 as well as other \nkey cabinet ministers.\n\nOrganisations\n\nSignatories include the NFU, Country Land and Business Association, National Association of Agricultural \nContractors, and the Tenant Farmers Association.\n\nNFU Scotland, NFU Cymru and the Ulster Farmers\u2019 Union are also signatories.\n\nFarm suppliers include the Agricultural Industries Confederation, Agrii, CF Fertilisers, Elsoms Seeds, KWS, \nLimagrain, Procam, Ses VanderHave, the Wynnstay Group and Yara.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the signatories, NFU president Minette Batters said it was vital Brexit did not undermine the \nUK's food production and supply sectors.\n\nMs Batters warned: \u201cA Brexit that fails to champion UK food producers, and the businesses that rely on them, will \nbe bad for the country\u2019s landscape, the economy and critically our society.\n\n\u201cConversely, if we get this right, we can all contribute to making Brexit a success for producers, food businesses \nand the British public.\u201d\n\nBenefits of success\n\nDoing so would improve productivity, create jobs and establish a more sustainable food supply system, said Ms \nBatters.\n\nThe food and farming sector was worth at least \u00a3112bn to the UK economy and employed about four million people \n\u2013 meeting 61% of the nation\u2019s food needs.\n\nFarmers and food producers provided high-welfare, traceable and affordable food while caring for three-quarters of \nthe countryside and supporting tourism worth \u00a321bn.\n\nMs Batters said: \u201cWhen it comes to the nation\u2019s ability to produce food, we believe it is critical the different elements \nof Brexit are carefully considered by all government departments.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister had herself spoken about the importance of supporting the sector \u2013 and the 105 organisations \nwould be looking to ensure the government\u2019s objectives achieved this.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFarmland could be abandoned in the Scottish Highlands and Islands because of the challenges posed by Brexit, \nwarns a report.\n\nScottish farmers and crofting communities are likely to face major upheaval because of the UK's decision to leave \nthe European Union, says the study.\n\nThe report looks at the likely effects of different Brexit scenarios on the economy, local communities, wildlife, the \nenvironment and sectors such as tourism.\n\nSee also: 9 recommendations to help improve landlord-tenant relations\n\nIt concludes that existing trends such as declining agricultural activity, land abandonment and a shrinking \nagricultural workforce could all be accelerated by Brexit.\n\nThese trends will have negative effects on environmental land management \u2013 as well as on sectors such as food \nand drink and tourism, it suggests.\n\nTargeted support\n\nFuture policy and funding will need to respond to these challenges and reflect the distinctive needs and \ncontributions of the region, says the study.\n\nThe report was commissioned by the Highlands and Islands Agriculture Support Group (HIASG), which comprises \nfive local authority councils and RSPB Scotland.\n\nIt is calling on the Scottish government to ensure that future farming, land management and rural development \npolicy after Brexit is properly targeted to support local communities.\n\n\n\nHIASG chairman Douglas Irvine, who is also economic development manager for Shetland Islands Council, said \nthe government should give farmers and crofters time to adapt to change.\n\nVulnerable\n\n\u201cThis report is a wake-up call and shows how important farming and crofting is to the economy, people and \nenvironment of the Highlands and Islands, but also how vulnerable it is,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe challenges faced here look set to increase rather than diminish.\u201d\n\nThe work was carried out by consultants Andrew Moxey of Pareto Consulting and Steven Thomson of Scotland's \nRural College (SRUC).\n\nIt was presented at an event in Ediburgh attended by Scotland's rural cabinet secretary Fergus Ewing on Monday \n(14 May).\n\nMr Ewing said the report highlighted the distinctive challenges of farming in the Highlands and Islands, both in \nterms of the land and those available to work it.\n\nBiggest challenge\n\n\u201cIt confirms what I have been saying ever since the Brexit referendum \u2013 that Brexit is going to be the biggest \nchallenge that the industry and rural communities has faced for generations.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore vital that the special circumstances of the Highlands and Islands are not ignored, and that their \nunique social, economic and environmental conditions remain supported.\u201d\n\nJust over two-thirds of Scotland\u2019s high nature value farmland is located in the Highlands and Islands region, where \nagriculture is mainly extensive, small-scale farming and croft-based.\n\nTourism\n\nThe region has a high share of sites designated for their national and international environmental importance \u2013 \nmaking it a destination for tourists as well as wildlife.\n\nVicki Swales, head of land use policy for RSPB Scotland, said traditional farming and crofting practices had helped \nto create a region of enormous environmental importance.\n\nThe Scottish government should ensure that the environmental land management carried out by farmers and \ncrofters was properly supported and rewarded.\n\nA recent public poll showed overwhelming support for farmers being paid for managing their land in ways that were \ngood for wildlife, water quality and the environment, said Ms Swales.\n\nShe added: \u201cThe Highlands and Islands are well placed to benefit from such an approach.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nBritish farming productivity rose by 2.9% to its highest-ever level in 2017 after sharp increases in crop and livestock \noutputs, Defra figures reveal.\n\nThe data also shows the increased output, combined with higher prices, pushed up total income from farming (Tiff) \nby \u00a31,683m to \u00a35.7bn.\n\nBroken down, the Tiff figure for each person engaged in entrepreneurial labour - generally farmers and partners in \nfarming businesses - rose by 41% between 2016 and 2017 to \u00a329,794 a year, Defra said.\n\n\n\nThe department said a strong harvest in 2017 had been a major driver for the higher productivity, with a 7.3% \nincrease in the volume of all crops produced.\n\nSee also: Tax implications of changing to a company structure\n\nOutputs in the livestock sector also rose, with meat up by 0.5% and other meat products increasing by 4% on 2016 \nlevels.\n\nOverall the average increase in volumes for farming was 3.6%.\n\nHowever, within the figures there were huge hikes in volumes for certain crops.\n\nBarley volumes jumped by 13.2% between 2016 and 2017, while oilseed rape rose by 23%. The biggest increase \nwas seen in sugar beet, where volumes were up by 58%.\n\nMilk volumes were also up 4% on the previous year, while the main increase in the livestock sector was for \nsheepmeat at 2%.\n\nThis compares with a far smaller overall rise of just 0.7% in the volume of inputs used across all farming sectors. \nThe major falls were in fertiliser use \u2013 down by 2.4% -  and animal straight feeds, which fell by 2.5%.\n\nTotal factor productivity up by 2.9%\n\nTotal factor productivity is a measure of how well inputs are converted into outputs, giving an indication of the \nefficiency and competitiveness of the agricultural industry.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2017 volume outputs increased by 3.6% while inputs increased by just 0.7%. The calculated \ndifference between the two figures at 2.9% is the figure used to show how productivity has changed.\n\nThe increased productivity recorded shows farmers are producing more with less, which suggests they are using \nsmarter, more efficient methods and embracing innovation, Defra said.\n\nThe NFU said the performance was further evidence that the sector needed to be properly valued by the \ngovernment post-Brexit.\n\nNFU deputy president Guy Smith said: \u201cThis is positive news for the farming sector and very clearly demonstrates \nthe significant contribution agriculture makes to the wider economy.\n\n\u201cAs the NFU prepares to submit its consultation response to the government on a future farming policy, these newly \nreleased figures provide further evidence that a new agricultural policy must allow farm businesses to be \nproductive, profitable and progressive.\u201d\n\nBut Mr Smith said the figures should be treated with some caution because the increase in incomes was achieved \non the back of low profits in previous years.\n\n\u201cIt is important to remember that this rise comes after three years of falling profits and margins, and increased price \nvolatility for many across the industry.\n\nThe NFU is concerned whether this performance can be sustained in future years,\u201d Mr Smith said.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the effects of the recent wet weather, the cost base of the industry has been rising. Some farm \ncommodity sectors are also witnessing price falls from the highs seen in 2017. The milk price, for example, has \nfallen nearly 8% in the past three months,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cLower farmgate prices will feed through to a lower bottom line for 2018 and it would be reckless to draw from these \nfigures that farming is entering a period of sustained profitability.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn order to put farmers in the best position to continue producing food for the nation, this sort of volatility needs to \nbe addressed in future agricultural policies. The NFU believes that with the right government policies, Britain\u2019s \nfarmers can continue this impressive performance.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nSugar beet hauliers were \u201cgroomed\u201d to expand their businesses without any guarantees of bigger contracts to \nharvest and transport the crop, suggests a report.\n\nThe allegation was made by operators during an independent assessment of the British Sugar Industry Harvesting \nand Haulage Scheme \u2013 and how it might be improved.\n\nThe scheme was set up by British Sugar in 2010 to provide harvesting and transport services to sugar beet \ngrowers \u2013 but has faced criticism from farmers and hauliers.\n\nSee also: How to avoid losses from cercospora beet disease\n\nJointly funded by British Sugar and NFU Sugar, the Douglas assessment looked at each stage of the scheme to \nidentify where greater transparency would benefit growers and hauliers alike.\n\nAreas of concern\n\nThe assessment report outlines areas of concern \u2013 including grooming, poor relationships and some ill-feeling and \nmistrust between British Sugar and hauliers.\n\nSome operators were allegedly encouraged to increase haulage capacity so they could transport more beet \u2013 but \nthen allocated low or no tonnage as their rates were deemed too high.\n\n\u201cSelected operators claim to have been encouraged to invest significantly and to grow their capacity, without \nguarantees of tonnage,\u201d says the report.\n\nBut the report says it found no evidence of any wrongdoing within the scheme\u2019s operation and any allegations \nappeared to be anecdotal only and without factual evidence.\n\nIt also points to a \u201clack of understanding\u201d among the wider community of growers and hauliers in relation to the \ntender process for contracts with British Sugar.\n\nReconciliation needed\n\nThe Douglas report recommends reconciliation with \u201cgroomed\u201d hauliers to prevent the perception of British Sugar \nditching operators solely on price.\n\nAnd it says repeatedly negotiating year-after-year with multiple hauliers should be avoided as it creates conflict, \nparticularly with long-standing contractors who are later eliminated.\n\nBritish Sugar says it will now implement improvements to the scheme ahead of the 2018-19 sugar beet harvest \u2013 \nand says it will communicate these changes to growers in due course.\n\nBritish Sugar managing director Paul Kenward said: \u201cI take the recommendations of the Douglas report very \nseriously and we are committed to implementing them.\u201d\n\nThe scheme had the potential to drive further efficiencies and yield improvements and British Sugar would continue \nto work with NFU Sugar to deliver a better scheme, he added.\n\nTransparent future\n\n\n\nNFU Sugar board chairman Michael Sly said growers had maintained for some time the scheme had focused on \ncost reduction at the expense of value to the industry.\n\n\u201cTalking with growers there are plenty of examples of fragmentation..., which not only goes against the core aims of \nthe scheme, but has been a real financial and logistical burden.\n\n\u201cTo remain competitive in the post-quota world, our industry must focus on maximising yield potential from farm to \nfactory.\u201d\n\nIt was pleasing that British Sugar had committed to making improvements and work with NFU Sugar to make \nfurther changes for it to operate more transparently, said Mr Sly.\n\nPrinciples for improvement\n\nIn addition to reforming the haulage scheme, NFU Sugar and British Sugar have also agreed three principles it \nmust operate to and will now work together to make the changes.\n\nThe principles are:\n\nMaximise value to the industry Focusing on maximising yield potential from farm to factory and continuing to drive \nefficiencies\n\nA well-run and operated fairly scheme Organised appropriately and operated transparently, with clear, open, honest \nand timely communication\n\nEncourage and reward Define, communicate and reward best practice\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nButter prices have hit a record seasonal high after milk production grew at a slower rate than buyers anticipated.\n\nIn the 13 months since March 2017, UK wholesale butter prices have reached record seasonal highs every month, \naccording to AHDB Dairy.\n\nAlthough they remain well short of the overall peak of more than \u00a36,000/t in August and September last year, the \nprice for April hit \u00a34,660/t.\n\nSee also: Dairy wholesale markets stable as poor weather continues\n\nThat is an increase of \u00a3935, or 25%, on year-earlier figures, when prices were at about \u00a33,725/t in April 2017.\n\nAHDB senior analyst Patty Clayton said there was concern in the market about supply levels, with stocks still tight \nand milk production growing at a slower rate than anticipated.\n\n\u201cEarlier in the year there was an expectation milk supply would increase,\u201d said Ms Clayton.\n\n\u201cBut this hasn\u2019t been the case - mainly because of the poor start to the growing season.\n\n\u201cThis is causing a nervousness among the buyers and pushing up prices as they compete for stocks.\u201d\n\nIn April, an AHDB report suggested deals had been struck where product was still needed to fulfil the orders, forcing \nbuyers to venture into the spot market.\n\nThe effect on prices was marked and they rose quickly from \u00a34,200 to hit the record average for the month.\n\nAs well as the questions over future supply, a further driver for the rising price has been stronger consumer demand \nfor fats.\n\n\n\nSeveral studies questioned the link between saturated fat and heart disease and food trend analysts suggested that \nconsumers had returned to using butter because of a popular belief that it was a healthier alternative to margarines.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA large-scale weather scare in a major producer can often trigger an upturn in grain prices on the back of a tangible \nrisk to grain supplies. At other times it can be a collection of \"what-ifs?\"\n\nWhile recent weather events in some parts of the world have been significant enough to fall into the first category, \nthe majority are far from done deals, with plenty of time for conditions and growth to catch up.\n\nThe combination has been enough to unsettle markets, however, with grain prices rising accordingly despite the \nongoing strong stocks and supply situation.\n\nSee also: Business Clinic: How can I recruit good farm staff?\n\nAlthough the US experienced a slow start to corn and spring wheat plantings due to heavy snow, followed by rain, \nthe situation has now improved and it is generally the hot and dry conditions in some regions that are causing \nconcerns.\n\nIndeed, dry conditions causing historically poor crop ratings in US hard red winter (HRW) wheat in the southern \nplains has been one of the main market drivers recently.\n\nStuart Shiells is UK trading director at Cofco International\n\nDuring the recent Kansas Wheat Quality Crop Tour, yield estimates were put at just 37 bushels/acre (bpa) against \nlast season\u2019s final yield of 48bpa \u2013 a drop of 23%.\n\nWith most of the HRW crop now reaching critical growth stages, better weather could still have a big effect on final \nyields.\n\nIn fact, following the mid-May USDA report, a lack of fresh bullish data, combined with more favourable weather \nforecasts for key regions, has been enough to take markets sharply lower.\n\nToo late to reverse yield losses in Brazil\n\nAnother area exerting a strong influence on prices recently has been the Safrinha corn crop in Brazil, where \ndryness has caused some analysts to cut total corn production estimates to as low as 82m tonnes from the USDA\u2019s \nearlier 92m tonnes.\n\nAlthough rain would help stabilise the crop, it\u2019s now probably too late to reverse yield losses.\n\nAt the same time, the market is keeping a close eye on Australia, where a similar lack of rainfall could affect \nplanting prospects.\n\nRussian rain limits Black Sea losses\n\nSome areas of the Black Sea region have also experienced dryness, but recent showers have stopped this \nbecoming a real issue. With Russia being the world\u2019s cheapest source of wheat, it will continue to be a big market \ndriver in the coming season.\n\nAlthough some damage to 2018\u2019s global production potential has been done, the general feeling is that the effects \nof this are already priced into the market.\n\nIf all the worries in different countries deliver their full consequences, prices could have further to rise, but the reality \nof this happening is historically remote.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, there are signs that prices are already starting to slip as the current stories play out and lose their \nhold.\n\nThe bottom line is while there is hope that prices can move a little higher, it will take something new and significant \nlike a major weather event in the Black Sea region to really drive the market further.\n\nEffect on the UK\n\nThe price rally has been a welcome diversion against a backdrop of a wet, cold spring and late planting woes.\n\nWhile the poor start to the year has triggered concerns over spring-sown crops, the recent warm weather has done \nmuch to help growers catch up. Winter wheat crops are generally looking strong.\n\nAcross the EU, crops look good too and with a good chance Russia\u2019s production might not be the record breaker it \nwas last year, export opportunities to take up the slack could be forthcoming.\n\nUnfortunately, the UK is unlikely to benefit much from this, with current production estimates putting 2018 in the \nsame range as last year, resulting in a very small exportable surplus.\n\nA summary of the current main price factors and their probable influence\n\nRed: Factors putting downward pressure on prices \u2013 accounts for 20% of current market influence\n\nCanadian wheat area forecast at 10.2m hectares compared with 9.06m hectares last season, plus a record wheat \ncrop of 20m tonnes could be produced in Argentina. Brazil could produce 117m tonnes of soya beans, helping to \noffset any shortfall in the Argentinian crop.\n\nAmber: Watch this space \u2013  50%\n\nA lot of weather stories need to play out across the world. While any one of these is unlikely to unsettle the bigger \npicture, a few adverse results together could.

The detailed proposals on changes to the CAP are due to be officially presented on 1 June.\n\nThe total CAP budget for 2021-27, adjusted for inflation, will be about 365bn (\u00a3322bn), compared with 382.5bn \n(\u00a3337bn) for the EU (excluding the UK) in 2014-20.\n\nBut the axe will fall especially heavily on Pillar 2, where seven-year spending totals are going to be about 15% \nlower than in 2014-20 \u2013 much to the annoyance of environmental and countryside campaigners.\n\nThe commission also wants member states to make significantly higher contributions to co-funded programmes in \nPillar 2 than at present.\n\nThe whole financial package will be the subject of fierce and complex arguments between member states over the \nnext 12 months or so, and there could be significant changes to the plans before they are finally agreed next year.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nGrowers will be able to vary their arable crop inputs using just an iPad thanks to a new low-cost app.\n\nUsers of Hutchinsons' Omnia precision agronomy tool will be able to transfer variable-rate field data with just a click \nof a button from the office straight to a tractor in the field, removing the need to use memory sticks.\n\nThis means fields will be able to be drilled, fertilised and sprayed taking into account Omnia\u2019s field performance and \ncost-of-production mapping tools.\n\nSee also: How a Hampshire farmer is managing contrasting soils\n\nBy connecting straight into the machine\u2019s controller, the app allows growers to use the existing variable-rate \ncapabilities of their fertiliser spreaders, drills and sprayers without the need to unlock or update the controller, which \ncan be an expensive option.\n\nSimplicity\n\nWhile the app is primarily aimed at small- to medium-scale growers who have not yet invested in auto-steer \ntechnology, instead making use of the iPad\u2019s own built-in GPS system, the ease at which data can be transferred to \nthe field is expected to appeal to all growers.\n\nPrecision technology manager Oliver Wood said the driving factors for Hutchinsons in developing the app were to \ncreate an affordable and simple way of accessing variable-rate technology.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe data transfer element of the process has always been a challenging area for farmers, so we have done \nanything we can to make it easier,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the app is compatible with a wide range of machinery via its connect box, it can only be used with \nHutchinson\u2019s Omnia technology, and will cost an additional \u00a3300 per year.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA key seed-borne disease of barley appears to have overcome the azole chemistry found in seed treatments used \nin the winter barley crop.\n\nOutbreaks of loose smut have been reported in treated crops this year from across the UK. The problem has also \nbeen confirmed in France.\n\nThe seed industry is waiting to see if the disease will also be seen in spring barley.\n\nSee also: Top tips on tackling pests when establishing OSR\n\nWhile not confined to a single variety or region, the widespread problem has occurred regardless of the barley seed \ntreatment used \u2013 all of which contain azole chemistry.\n\nLooking for loose smut\n\nInfected barley plants are easy to spot, as masses of spores (or smut) replace the entire barley head and then \ninfect the open flowers of healthy plants by wind or rain dispersal.\n\nThe spores, which are released as soon as the ear emerges, then germinate and infect the developing grain, \nstaying there without showing symptoms until the next growing season.\n\nThe fungus develops in the growing plant, but only becomes apparent when the plant reaches maturity in the \nfollowing year.\n\nThe blackened ears are an alarming sight, but the disease may only be present at low incidence levels.\n\nAs a result, Bayer has confirmed it is investigating the causes, the results of which will be shared with the industry \nas soon as they are available.\n\nBarry Barker, national arable seed manager with Agrii explained azole chemistry was included in seed treatments to \nimprove the control of barley diseases and, up until this year, has always given good control of loose smut.\n\n\u201cIn our case, Raxil Star and Raxil Star Deter are the treatments. We were alerted four weeks ago to some \nunexpected loose smut infections, with the majority of problems that we\u2019ve seen being found in the variety Glacier.\u201d\n\nFour growers\n\nAgrii\u2019s Glacier seed came from four different growers and went through three processing plants, with the seed \ntreatments being applied at the correct rate and in the right conditions, he reported.\n\nThere are also reports of the disease being found in other winter barley varieties, including the hybrid barley \nSunningdale and the winter malting type Flagon, and where the seed treatments Redigo Deter and Celeste Trio \nhave been used.\n\nOur advice is to get out in the field and look for any signs of the disease and to test seed for loose smut Barry \nBarker, Agrii \n\n\n\n\u201cFortunately it won\u2019t have a big effect on yields this year because infection levels are below 0.5%,\u201d commented Mr \nBarker. \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know whether the seed treatments have given no control or are only giving partial control.\n\nThis autumn\n\n\u201cThe bigger question for growers is what they should do this coming autumn, especially if they are planning to \nhome-save some seed. Our advice is to get out in the field and look for any signs of the disease and to test seed for \nloose smut.\u201d\n\nThe EU minimum standard for loose smut infection in seed is 0.5% while the higher voluntary standard, which the \nUK operates to, is 0.2%.\n\n\u201cEither way, growers are likely to see it in the field until new chemistry comes along,\u201d pointed out Mr Barker.\n\n\u201cThere are seed treatment products based on other chemistry in the market, but they are not approved for use in \nbarley.\u201d\n\nHe stresses there is nothing the industry could have done to prevent this occurring. \u201cWe are looking for confirmation \non the type of resistance at play so that we can work out the best strategy for this coming autumn.\n\n\u201cIt does mean that some barley seed stocks could be limited.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nAll four farmer finalists in the industry's first yield competition fought off strong competition in what was a record \nbeet-growing season and very high-yielding year.\n\nThe four finalists of the Beet Research Organisation's (BBRO) Beet Yield Challenge are Guy Hitchcock of \nHitchcock Farms in Suffolk, Will Jones from Salle Farms in Norfolk, GR Mawer and Son from Grimsby and Mark \nMeans of JS Means in Norfolk.\n\nThe overall winner is set to be revealed at the Royal Norfolk Show at the end of the month.\n\nSee also: How to manage disease in sugar beet crops\n\nOf the 28 fields entered from all four factory areas, the average yield in 2017 was 97.4t/ha.\n\nThis represented 73.5% of estimated potential yield \u2013 something the BBRO described as phenomenal and due \nlargely to favourable early summer weather, which drove rapid crop canopy development.\n\nGrown on a range of soil types with different cultivation practices, drilling and lifting dates, the crops entered in the \nchallenge provide a unique barometer of UK sugar beet production and have helped to highlight some key focus \nareas, said Simon Bowen of BBRO.\n\n\u201cIt came as no surprise to us that attention to detail at each key stage of production is what separated the good \ncrops from the very good crops.\n\n\u201cThis applies right from primary soil cultivation through to delivery at the factory,\u201d Dr Bowen said.\n\nDry start\n\nGiven the very dry start to the 2017 growing season, soil management and seed-bed production were challenging \nand resulted in delayed emergence and some patchy establishment \u2013 which is where between 12-17% of potential \nyield was lost.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt reinforced the importance of seed-bed quality and achieving the recommended 100,000 established plants/ha. \nAll of the highest-yielding crops, including the four finalists, had plant populations in excess of 100,000/ha.\u201d\n\nBut the stand-out feature and base for high yields in 2017 was the very rapid canopy development in May and June, \nrevealed Dr Bowen, with those crops that reached higher crop cover scores by 21 June having the greatest yields.\n\n\u201cWe had higher-than-average rainfall in early summer, which helped, as soil moisture is key at this stage.\n\n\u201cAttending to crop needs in this rapid-growth phase is also important, so adequate nutrition proved essential. \nChecks to growth from herbicides and bird and pest damage were kept to a minimum in the best crops,\u201d Dr Bowen \nsaid.\n\nBBRO Key focus areas\n\nSeed-bed quality \u2013 establish a uniform 100,000 plants/ha\n\nSeed rates \u2013  higher seed rates help compensate for difficult early conditions, but are not a substitution for good \nseed-beds\n\npH levels \u2013 sugar beet is sensitive to pH, with an indication of higher yields from higher pH levels\n\nEarly canopy growth \u2013 very rapid canopy development in May/June in a high-yielding year\n\nWeed control \u2013 early identification of weeds allows tailoring of herbicide programmes\n\nFoliar disease \u2013 yield-limiting factor, third spray paid in later-harvested crops\n\nHarvest date \u2013 select the right crops for later harvesting\n\nManure benefits\n\nAn effect of organic manures on this key early growth stage was noted, with the average yield of crops receiving \nmanures being 106t/ha, compared with an average of 93t/ha where no manure was applied.\n\nProtection from foliar disease also played a role in the results, with vigilance for the first signs of disease helping \nwith optimum spray timing and product choice. While most crops received two fungicides, a third spray was cost-\neffective for later-harvested crops.\n\n\u201cWhere the number of sprays was tailored to expected harvest date, there was an impact on yield,\u201d Dr Bowen said.\n\nLater harvest dates gave higher yields, but highlighted a tendency for crops to achieve a lower percentage of their \npotential, he noted. \n\n\u201cThe longer the crop is left in the ground, the wider the range of variables it is subjected to. Again, it\u2019s down to detail \n\u2013 selecting the right fields, varieties and agronomy programmes can all make a difference with later-harvested \nyields.\u201d\n\nResults from the Beet Yield Challenge\n\nAdjusted yield range \n\n(t/ha)\n\nPercentage of crops\n\n70-80\n\n\n\n7\n\n80-90\n\n25\n\n90-100\n\n29\n\n>100\n\n39\n\nPercentage of potential yield achieved\n\nPercentage of crops\n\n<60\n\n7\n\n60-70\n\n32\n\n70-80\n\n39\n\n>80\n\n21\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nHigh-yielding, low-input oilseed rape varieties suitable for an integrated farm management approach are the aim of \nbreeder DSV\u2019s triple layer concept, which was unveiled at Cereals 2018.\n\nThe new concept will form the basis of the company\u2019s future breeding strategy, as it concentrates on producing \nvarieties with the yield and performance stability growers will increasingly need to overcome complex challenges.\n\nSee also: Advice on achieving high OSR yields with good establishment\n\nThose include restrictions on pesticide and fertiliser use, climate change and seasonal stresses, said DSV\u2019s \nAlex Doering, who added triple layering will be combined with the company\u2019s existing variety characteristics of \nstrong early vigour, good compensation powers and open plant architecture.\n\n\u201cHaving developed these characteristics in our post-neonicotinoid breeding initiative, we are now bringing in \nadditional layers of disease resistance and yield protection traits,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt should allow us to develop a \u2018drill and forget\u2019 production system for oilseed rape, so that costly agronomic \nintervention becomes a thing of the past,\u201d Dr Doering added.\n\nTriple layer\n\n\n\nThe term triple layer refers to a combination of disease resistance trait and physical characters found in the \ncompany\u2019s latest development hybrid varieties \u2013 all three of which are under test in the UK and expected to become \ncandidates later this year (see \u2018Triple layer varieties\u2019, below).\n\nIf successful, they are likely to be the first commercially available varieties to combine all of these traits.\n\nThe first layer is multi-gene resistant to phoma and light leaf spot, while the second and third layers bring in \nverticillium wilt tolerance and pod shatter resistance.\n\n\u201cIt allows the varieties to be grown with fewer inputs and in a range of conditions, making them easy to manage and \ngiving consistent results,\u201d added Dr Doering.\n\nThe company is also working on turnip yellow virus resistance, with a portfolio of resistant varieties showing good \nyield stability in a number of European countries.\n\nIn addition, it is hoping to develop the first multi-layered Clearfield variety and has clubroot-resistant varieties in the \npipeline.\n\nTriple layer varieties\n\nCurrently in National List year two, the three varieties that have the triple layering (turnip yellows virus, pod shatter \nand phoma resistance) are:\n\nWRH530 (Award)\n\nWRH532 (Dazzler)\n\nWRH527 (Darling)\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFarmers can get a glimpse of a pest and disease forecast service set to be launched in autumn 2019, offering a 10-\nday prediction of key pests and diseases.\n\nA prototype is running on the Crop Monitor website, giving farmers a feel of what the tool will offer.\n\nThe existing Crop Monitor platform, which is free for farmers, is a valuable source of pest and disease alerts for \ngrowers and agronomists, said Guy Thallon, Fera\u2019s strategic business development manager.\n\nSee also: 5 pea and bean pests for growers to look out for\n\nIt brings together in-field leaf assessments from selected sites and Met Office weather data plus AHDB and \nRothamsted aphid data.\n\nHowever, autumn 2019 will see the launch of a local forecasting element for more than 40 pests and diseases of \nwheat, barley, oilseed rape and potatoes, in conjunction with Crop Health and Protection.\n\nMoray Taylor, Fera disease expert said it would include septoria, yellow and brown rust fusarium and eyespot in \nwheat, light leaf spot, phoma and alternaria in oilseed rape and for barley, mildew, net blotch and rhynchosporium.\n\nSubscribers will be able to check out their nearest site to get a local forecast and the service will initially be for 100 \nlocations across the UK.\n\nFurther developments are in the pipeline including new spray window forecasts to help farmers predict spray days. \nDr Taylor said it was undergoing further development and validation.\n\nTo access the forecast, go to the Crop Monitor website and click on the York location.\n\n\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe Cereals event returned to its regular southern haunt at Chrishall Grange, Cambridgeshire this week. Farmers \nWeekly\u2019s Machinery team headed down the drills and cultivation isle to pick out some highlights.\n\nBrocks Campaign drill\n\nMaking its Cereals debut in the working plot area was the huge Campaign drill built by Essex machinery dealer \nBrock.\n\nThe orange-livered unit was launched last November at the firm\u2019s open day and is available in widths from 8-13.3m \n\u2013 ideal for controlled traffic operations.\n\nSee also: Cereals 2018: sprayers and spreaders\n\nA monster 5,500kg hopper has a 50:50 split to allow seed and fert to be drilled together and has hydraulic folding \nlids to keep the rain out.\n\nThere\u2019s also a nifty diesel-powered heater to remove any moisture that has worked its way into the hopper \novernight to avoid seed becoming damp and bunging up the pipes.\n\nKey to the drill\u2019s design is the two central flotation wheels that bear the weight, leaving the following tine \narrangement (spaced at 150mm centres) free to follow ground contours and deal with wetter conditions.\n\nTop-spec Streamline models have Topcon software on-board for auto shut-off on headlands and automatic \ncalibration, while LED lights are standard too.\n\nA swing out mini-auger helps remove left over seed from the hopper.\n\nAn 8m model should need 280hp and will cost close to \u00a3127,000.\n\nHorsch Serto disc drill\n\nThe trend for later drilling has prompted Horsch to introduce a wide disc drill that can cover the ground as quickly as \npossible.\n\nCalled the Serto SC it boasts a 6,000-litre hopper, working widths of up to 12m and drilling speeds of 20kph, \nmeaning it should be able to deliver on that promise.\n\nThere are no cultivation elements to the drill (other than a set of disc wheel track eradicators) so it\u2019s designed to \nwork in a conventional plough-based or min-till situation.\n\nIn these conditions, the full-width tyre packer consolidates the ground before the heavy-duty double-disc coulters \ndeposit the seed.\n\nThese have hydraulic pressure adjustment from 5 to 150kg per unit, with colour-coded shims for fine-tuning the \nsettings. The coulters are also mounted on a parallel linkage for better contour following.\n\nUnlike many double disc units with a leading disc to cut a slot, the Horsch units are mounted in line to force a more \npronounced opening. An adjustable press wheel at the rear then pushes soil over the seed.\n\nThe hopper itself is split into two 3,000-litre sections with separate metering, meaning two types of seed or seed \nand fertiliser can be applied. There\u2019s also a microgranular applicator on board.\n\nThe 12m machine pictured needs about 300hp on the front and has a list price of \u00a3160,000. There\u2019s also a smaller \n10m version that comes in at about \u00a3135,000.\n\n\n\nLemken Azurit\n\nTaking centre stage on the Lemken stand was the Azurit 9 precision maize drill, which made its first UK appearance \nat the Lamma show.\n\nThis techy piece of kit places the seed in two rows at alternate spacings, with the added bonus of being able drop a \nline of fertiliser between the seeds. Lemken also says it will maintain accuracy at speeds of up to 18kph.\n\nManual depth and pressure control for each seeding unit is available too, as well as a tramlining feature and Isobus \nconnectivity.\n\nThe machine can also be connected to the rear of the firm\u2019s Solitair cereal drill when the toolbar has been removed. \nThis allows the Solitair\u2019s standard 3t hopper to be used for fertiliser, while the 200kg Azuirt hopper can hold the \nmaize seed.\n\nThe Azuirit is available in 3m, 4m and 6m-wide guises with the option of 50cm, 75cm and 80cm-row spacings. The \neight-row version is likely to be the most popular in the UK and this has a list price of \u00a362,312.\n\nLandquip Stack and Jack\n\nTo put an end to jacking up kit off a wobbly section of wooden blocks found around the yard, Landquip has come \nup with the Stack and Jack.\n\nThis adjustable-height piece of lifting gear has a 15t bottle jack at the top and four interlocking steel sections that \ncan be added or removed to get you to the correct height.\n\nTo prevent slippages when in use, the sections are locked in place with a pin and the whole unit is mounted on a \ntrolley, making it easy to shunt around. When the front of the trolley is lowered the rear wheels lift off the ground for \nadded stability.\n\nIt\u2019s available in various combinations of sections, but the full 250mm to 1,750mm system pictured costs \u00a3699.\n\nSahco Geacut 600\n\nFor those with bulky cover crops to knock down before direct drilling, parts supplier Spaldings is offering the Geacut \n600 from Sacho Land Solutions.\n\nThis 6m folding implement has three serrated rollers that can thunder along at speeds of up to 30kph to help reduce \nthe bulk of the crop to more manageable levels.\n\nAt these speeds, there\u2019s a considerable shock impact between the outer wings and the frame, so large rubber \ndoughnut-style bushes have been fitted to absorb it.\n\nIn standard form, the Geacut weighs 5,210kg but water ballasting can push this up to 7,020kg to provide extra \ncultivation on heavy soils or to penetrate through particularly dense vegetation.\n\nAs well as cover crop bashing, Spaldings says it can be used on long maize or oilseed rape stubbles. The full-width \nsteel blades can also be replaced when they\u2019re worn out.\n\nIt has a list price of \u00a328,000 and apparently a 150hp tractor should be adequate to pull it.\n\nAgrimaster R250W hedgecutter\n\nAlongside the 8m GD drill, Weaving was showing off several more modestly sized items from its Italian-built \nAgrimaster stable.\n\n\n\nThe first is a cheaply priced Golden R250W hedgecutter that uses a joystick in the cab to provide proportional \nmovements of the trimmer\u2019s hydraulic functions via cables, much like an old loader tractor control.\n\nThe basic design does away with any unnecessary electronics and is perfectly suited to running on a sub-100hp \ntractor.\n\nBase spec models cost just \u00a39,800 and come with a rotor reverse function, parallel arm, head float and power slew.\n\nThe company was also showing what it reckons is the first fully offset flail mower \u2013 the Blade N260.\n\nThis means the tractor doesn\u2019t have to run on the grass while mowing, which helps to produce a more consistent \ncut.\n\nA hydraulic break-back mechanism offers some protection from immovable objects too, and sprung suspension \nhelps with self-levelling.\n\nThere\u2019s just one width \u2013 2.6m \u2013 and it pivots backwards to lock into transport mode. The asking price is \u00a35,800.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nLimagrain has such high hopes for its soft feed wheat candidate, Skyscraper, that it is making up to 4,000t of seed \navailable for this autumn.\n\nDescribed as a breakthrough variety, Skyscraper is the highest-yielding wheat candidate on 109%, so the \ncompany\u2019s decision to accelerate seed production by a year means farmers have an opportunity to try the high-\nperforming variety before it is fully recommended. \n\nSee also: Kent grower\u2019s second wheat crop measures up to first\n\nBreeder Ed Flatman said Skyscraper combines very high yields with desirable agronomic characteristics and end-\nmarket opportunities, putting it in a league of its own in the feed wheat sector.\n\nSkyscraper \u2013 disease resistance on a scale of 1 (least) to 9 (most)\n\nMildew: 7\n\nYellow rust: 8\n\nBrown rust: 6\n\nSeptoria: 5.9\n\nEyespot: (4)\n\nOrange wheat blossom midge: resistant\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a barn-filler, but not a high-input variety,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will give some of the hard feed wheats a run for their \nmoney and could end their 10-year dominance.\u201d\n\nThose agronomic characters include orange wheat blossom midge resistance, good all-round disease resistance \nratings (see \u2018Skyscraper \u2013 disease resistance on a scale of 1 (least) to 9 (most)\u2019, right) and equivalent maturity to \nDiego (0), while consistent yield performance has been seen across regions and seasons.\n\nA taller type at 90cm in height, Limagrain research done on Skyscraper to date suggests it has similar standing \npower to other feed varieties, with the company anticipating it will get 7 ratings for resistance to lodging with and \nwithout plant growth regulators (PGRs).\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had two seasons with PGR timing issues and some of the 2017 lodging data should be viewed with \ncaution,\u201d said arable technical manager Ron Granger. \u201cIt was an erratic year, which made it difficult to target spray \nprogrammes.\u201d\n\nSkyscraper \u2013 Summary\n\nVery high yield of 109%\n\nSoft milling feed candidate variety\n\nProvisional \"good\" distilling rating\n\nAll-round disease resistance\n\nEarly maturity\n\nOrange wheat blossom midge resistance\n\nAs with other Limagrain varieties, Skyscraper will respond to a split PGR programme based on chlormequat and a \n\u201csniff\u201d of Moddus, he advised, with either Cerone or Terpal a sensible precaution on high-fertility sites.\n\nA Santiago/soft wheat cross, its pedigree explains its high-tillering capacity and semi-prostrate winter growth habit, \nas well as its rapid spring development.\n\n\u201cWe suggest drilling it from the third week of September onwards, not in the very early drilling slot,\u201d added Mr \nGranger.\n\nIn terms of grain quality, Skyscraper has a Hagberg of 216, a specific weight of 77.7kg/hl and a grain protein of \n12.5%.\n\nMore importantly, after two years of official testing, it has been given a provisional good rating for distilling, making it \nof potential interest to growers in the North.\n\nLimagrain data also suggests Skyscraper does well in the second wheat position.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe Cereals event returned to its regular southern haunt at Chrishall Grange, Cambridgeshire this week. Farmers \nWeekly\u2019s Machinery team delved into the sprays and sprayers ring in search of the latest crop protection kit.\n\nJohn Deere R4050i\n\nFlying up and down the sprays and sprayers demo area was the flagship John Deere 4050i self-propelled unit, with \na larger 5,000-litre tank, carbon-fibre boom and a few new tricks up its sleeve.\n\nA fresh transmission has been built by Deere and, although it does bear similarities to the old one, there\u2019s now a \ncruise control feature on the joystick and independent wheel slip control. This is designed to direct power to the \nwheels with the most traction and will hopefully avoid it getting bogged down in wet holes.\n\nSee also: A pick of the latest kit on show at Cereals 2018\n\nThis new single-range hydrostatic transmission is now standard on all JD\u2019s self-propelled models.\n\nAlso standard (and an option on trailed machines) is PowrSpray, which uses two centrifugal pumps to handle huge \nwater volumes.\n\n\n\nA 1,200 litres/min filling pump pulls clean water into the tank. Due to the speed of filling, Deere has added a pause \nfeature, which stops the tank level rising and allows the operator to add the chemical through the induction hopper.\n\nCleverly, the rinse water for the hopper comes from the paused pressurised external feed. This way, there should \nnever be a rush to get all the chemical in before the tank is brimmed and cans are washed with clean water, as \nopposed to mixed chemical solution from the tank.\n\nThe second spraying pump is 1,000 litres/min and can reach 0-8bar in under three seconds. This two-pump design \nalso means the filling pump handles the clean water and the spraying pump takes care of the chemical solution.\n\nThere are also two new boom levelling options that use either two or three sensors across the width to keep things \nrunning straight.\n\nLitetrac boom spreader\n\nPeterborough-based sprayer maker Litetrac has added a pneumatic boom spreader to its line-up.\n\nThe in-house-built machine comes with a 950kg stainless steel hopper \u2013 although extensions are available to \nincrease this \u2013 and it\u2019s available with 12m or 24m aluminium booms. These can also have up to 24 individual \nsection controls.\n\nTo give a smooth ride on rough ground, the central frame and hopper are air suspended. This suspension system \nalso allows the unit to self-level.\n\nThe machine was originally designed for use in the field trials sector, but the firm says it\u2019s suitable for broad-acre \narable units as well.\n\nPrices vary according to size and spec, but most will come in between \u00a335,000 and \u00a340,000.\n\nDammann DT2800H S4\n\nFeaturing Dammann's usual bright colour scheme, the self-propelled DT2800H S4 sprayer has a totally new cab \nthat the company says gives operators oodles more glass area and room inside. It has also scrapped the odd-\nlooking car-like grille styling from the previous unit.\n\nThe bones of the cab are made by Dietec in Germany, but the fitting and construction for everything inside is \ncompleted by the in-house team at Dammann\u2019s Hamburg factory.\n\nCustomer research highlighted that staring at crop reflections all day was draining, so the new full-length front \nwindow can be darkened at the bottom to reduce glare and movement from the crops.\n\nThe cab is now standard on all of the firm\u2019s self-propelled models and has slight tweaks to the sliding door opening \nand the option to have multiple screens arranged on the right-hand-side of the driver.\n\nMuller provides the hardware for the spraying screen, which is now attached to the seat and moves with the \noperator, while there are LED lights all round and plenty of room for a large hound on the cab floor.\n\nThe model on the stand at Cereals costs about \u00a3246,000.\n\nFendt Rogator 655\n\nThe Rogator sprayer made its Cereals debut in Fendt colours, almost a year after Agco revealed the extent of its \nrebranding exercise that has all but killed off Challenger products in Europe.\n\nThe 655 model on stand is the biggest in a range of three and comes powered by a 242hp six-cylinder sourced \nfrom the company\u2019s engine division, running through a CVT gearbox.\n\n\n\nTop-spec tank capacity is 6,000 litres (the smallest is 4,000 litres) and maximum width of the aluminium booms is \n36m.\n\nOther details to note include an empty weight of 12,500kg, 3.6m wheelbase and 6.28m turning circle.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nWheat growers should focus on 10 varieties for this autumn\u2019s drilling which could save them \u00a340/ha in fungicide \ncosts, and cut the risk of big yield losses in a high-disease season.\n\nImproved resistance to wheat\u2019s biggest disease threat, septoria, means growers can choose to grow these \nvarieties, such as Siskin, Graham and Sundance, which can save on fungicide spray costs compared with the likes \nof Santiago, Diego and Barrel.\n\nBill Clark, fungicide expert at crop consultant Niab, said growing these varieties should allow growers to use only \none SDHI and moderate rates of azoles, compared with two SDHIs and higher azole rates for disease-susceptible \nvarieties.\n\n\u201cGrowers can save about \u00a340/ha on fungicide costs by changing varieties, and also reduce risks in a high-disease \nyear,\u201d he told Farmers Weekly at the 2018 Cereals event, held at Chrishall Grange in Cambridgeshire.\n\nSee also: Why growing a Group 3 wheat may pay off next season\n\nMr Clark said growers could make quite a saving in a high-disease year by growing Graham with a fungicide cost of \n\u00a398/ha, compared with Santiago at \u00a3135/ha, while in a low-disease year Graham would have a fungicide cost of \n\u00a363/ha compared with Santiago at \u00a3110/ha.\n\nHe list the top 10 varieties from the AHDB Recommended List with good disease resistance as Dunston, Zyatt, \nMoulton, Motown, Sundance, Illustrious, Graham, Freiston, Crispin and Siskin.\n\nThese all show good resistance to septoria and so low yield responses to fungicide regimes, which may be as little \nas 1.41t/ha for Dunston compared with untreated crops.\n\nFungicide programme\n\nThese varieties should only need a reduced fungicide spray programme where a T0 is usually not required, a T1 is \nof a moderate-dose azole plus a protectant fungicide such as chlorothalonil, a T2 of a moderate rate of azole-SDHI \nplus a protectant and a T3 of a moderate-dose azole.\n\nThere is a moderately disease-resistant group of varieties, including those \u2013 such as Revelation, Skyfall, Costello, \nGleam, Elicit and Bennington \u2013 wthat show a moderate response to fungicides of between 1.82-2.02t/ha.\n\nThe disease-susceptible group of varieties would include Santiago, Reflection, Cordiale, Leeds, Barrel, Lili and \nDiego, where the fungicide response is up to 3.77t/ha as in the case of Santiago.\n\nThese would have a full fungicide programme of a T0 consisting of an azole plus protectant, a T1 of a high-dose \nazole-SDHI plus protectant, a T2 of a high-dose azole/SDHI plus protectant, and a T3 of a high-dose azole.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA conventional winter barley delivering hybrid yields plus a potential Group 2 wheat with an untreated yield 33% \nabove control varieties are among the latest KWS varieties up for recommendation this autumn.\n\nTwo-row barley\n\n\n\nThe latest two-row barley variety Gimlet offers a step up in yields with a treated yield of 107% and the joint highest \nuntreated yield, which KWS barley breeder David Harrup said looks really promising.\n\n\u201cIn the arms race of conventionals versus hybrids, it brings conventionals back up to that of the hybrid Bazooka, but \nwith a lower seed cost.\u201d\n\nSee also: Why growing a Group 3 wheat may pay off next season\n\nIts strong resistance to wet weather diseases is the reason for its good untreated yields and it also has five to six \nmore grain sites per ear than other KWS two-row varieties.\n\nAnother feature is the high yields are being achieved without pushing maturity, being harvested one-to-two days \nearlier than Glacier.\n\nAnd while it is a little taller at 97cm, it has a good lodging score (3%) and stood up well last season.\n\nGroup 3 wheat\n\nMoving to wheat, Firefly is a potential Group 3 offering a yield of 106% in the East and West, which is up with Elicit \nand Barrel.\n\nIt also has a good septoria resistance of 6.3, which is similar to Elicit, which combined with a brown rust rating of 7 \nand 9 for yellow rust results in a good untreated yield, said KWS sales and cereals manager Will Compson.\n\nHowever, one key advantage is its good grain quality, offering a Hagberg of 253.\n\nGroup 2 wheat\n\nThe third variety, Extase is from the KWS French breeding programme, which is attracting attention in France. The \nvariety is also performing well in Denmark and soon arrive in the UK, says Mr Compson.\n\nOne notable feature he highlighted is its very good disease resistance, resulting in an untreated yield of 146% in the \nfirst year of National List trials and 136% in the second year.\n\n\u201cThe fact [Extase] maintained this level in two trying years means it is something special,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is 20% ahead of the best and 33% ahead of the controls. It is due to a combination of having the top yellow \nrust rating of 9, a 7.3 for septoria and also being strong on mildew and brown rust.\n\nPushing for septoria resistance can lead to poor grain quality, but good grain quality has been maintained. Another \nvaluable trait is its early maturity, being close to Cordiale and Gallant.\n\n\u201cWith the loss of actives, varieties like Extase will be in vogue for the future,\u201d said Mr Compson.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nGrowers are being urged to invite MPs on to their farms this harvest as part of a major campaign to highlight the \nimportance of the cereals sector to the UK\u2019s food and drink industry.\n\nLaunched by the NFU on the first day of Cereals, the Your Harvest campaign aims to raise the political profile of \nthe arable sector \u2013 and emphasise its contribution to the economy \u2013 as the government prepares to publish its \nAgriculture Bill detailing its policies for farming after Brexit.\n\nSee also: A pick of the latest kit on show at Cereals 2018\n\n\n\nIt comes amid concern that the government\u2019s determination to deliver a \u201cgreen\u201d Brexit risks failing to recognise that \nfarmers are primarily food producers and businesses in addition to their role as stewards of the countryside and the \nrural environment.\n\n\u2018Brilliant story\u2019\n\nThe future for the cereals sector \u2013 including farm support, productivity and pesticides \u2013 was among the key topics \nfor the two-day Cereals event, being held on Wednesday and Thursday (13-14 June) at Chrishall Grange, Duxford, \nnear Cambridgeshire.\n\nNFU combinable crops chairman Tom Bradshaw said: \u201cThe arable sector has a brilliant story to tell and never has \nthere been a more important time to tell it. We all have a responsibility to show how we grow the crops which form \nthe bedrock of the UK's food and drink sector.\u201d\n\nInviting politicians on farm could be an excellent way to build relationships with MPs, said Mr Bradshaw. It could \nalso help press home the point that farmers provide the raw materials for a UK food and drink industry worth \n\u00a3112bn and employing nearly 4 million people.\n\nInform thinking\n\n\u201cSetting aside a couple of hours to host a visit during a busy time such as harvest when there\u2019s lots to see is \ndefinitely worthwhile,\u201d Mr Bradshaw said. \u201cIt will give you the opportunity to inform their thinking on key issues for \nthe arable sector \u2013 and make it a day to remember.\u201d\n\nMr Bradshaw, who farms near Colchester, Essex, said the campaign goal was to promote a positive perception of \nthe industry. \u201cThe future of agriculture and of the cereals sector in particular is in the hands of politicians. Being too \nbusy to influence your MP is no excuse.\u201d\n\nIt was vital that the government and MPs recognised the economic value generated by farmers in addition to the \nenvironmental benefits provided. \u201cThe arable sector is the cornerstone of agriculture in the UK \u2013 producing livestock \nfeed in addition to food and drink ingredients.\u201d\n\nWithout a viable arable sector, the UK would have to import more food. This would have a knock-on effect for the \nfood and drink sector and would effectively export food and drink manufacturing to countries where costs and \nstandards were often lower.\n\nCampaign goals\n\nA framework that ensures UK farmers can produce food on a level playing field. If competitors can produce grain to \nlower standards with a lower cost of production, British farmers could be unable to compete post-Brexit.\n\nA science-based approach to regulating crop production \u2013 not political. Integrated pest management \u2013 including the \ntargeted use of pesticides \u2013 can help drive a productive future. Crop production is complex and the government \nmust recognise this.\n\nA straightforward environmental land management scheme open to all farmers \u2013 and with fair rewards for \nenvironmental enhancement. A scheme that complements the practicalities of food production and supports \nproductivity.\n\nThe ability to increase the use of productive arable land so it delivers both food and non-food goods and \nenvironmental services. Doing so will help ensure future generations can benefit from British agriculture.\n\nSource: NFU\n\n \n\n\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFrom April 2019, all farming businesses will need to keep an electronic record of all business transactions on \napproved record-keeping software in order to be able to make VAT returns.\n\nFor businesses that do not already use accounting software, this will require investment in software, training to use \nit and a working internet connection.\n\nThere will be no changes to the way that VAT is calculated, or to deadlines for submitting returns online.\n\nSee also: Business Clinic: Tax implications of changing company structure\n\nThe changes are the first step in a longer-term plan to make all tax submissions electronic, but the rules will initially \nonly apply to VAT, and therefore to businesses that have a turnover of more than \u00a385,000.\n\nIt is anticipated that income and expenditure records will have to be submitted electronically by April 2020 for the \ncalculation of income tax.\n\nFigures from HMRC show there is a \u00a312.6bn shortfall between the amount of VAT that is being collected and the \nestimate of what should be received and officials say this is part of a strategy that will help them narrow this gap by \nreducing record-keeping errors as well as tax evasion.\n\nChartered accountant Anne Cianchi, Making Tax Digital project consultant for Farmplan, highlighted five key facts \nbusinesses need to be aware of:\n\n1. There will no longer be the option to use a paper-based record-keeping system to calculate the amount of VAT \nowed before submitting a paper return or manually entering calculations on the HMRC website. However, paper \nrecords can still be kept, providing information from the invoices is entered into the electronic system.\n\n2. Farms using electronic spreadsheets, such as Microsoft Excel, will also have to invest in specialist accounting \nsoftware or bridging software (a tool to transfer data from one place to another) as, after the change, they will be the \nonly products capable of sending and receiving data from the website.\n\n3. HMRC have already made it clear there will be no free software provided by them for users to make VAT \nsubmissions.\n\n4. There are currently no software packages that have received HMRC approval for VAT submissions, as \ncompanies still have to submit the packages for testing, which will not be complete until later this year. As these \nchanges have long been signalled, it is expected that many of the common accounting software providers such as \nXero, QuickBooks, Sage and Farmplan will win approval.\n\n5. Only one submission will be allowed for each individual VAT registration number. This means companies that \nkeep multiple sets of accounts for different businesses - for example, a farm and a diversification enterprise \u2013 will \nneed to combine them into one figure for a VAT return. HMRC have made it clear that if the figures are combined \nfrom different sources this needs to be done electronically, so bookkeepers should ensure any software they \npurchase is capable of doing this. \n\nAre you concerned about the changes?

It could result in them ploughing up field \nmargins or using more pesticides and fertilisers to maximise yields, increasing water pollution.\n\nLower food standards: Food imported into the EU is four times more likely to exceed legal pesticide residue levels \nthan food produced here.\n\nA bigger environmental footprint: Beef is more than twice as expensive to produce in the UK as in Brazil, but the \nenvironmental effect of Brazilian beef is nearly three times higher, mainly due to deforestation. Importing more beef \nfrom Brazil would increase the environmental footprint of UK food.\n\nTo avoid these risks, the authors say the government must develop a trade policy that supports high-quality food \nand environment standards \u2013 and that all imports should meet at least the same standards as UK-produced food.\n\n'In the dark' on trade\n\nCommenting on the report, NFU president Minette Batters said the country \u201cremains in the dark about what the \ngovernment\u2019s overarching approach to trade will be\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cWe still await a convincing explanation as to how the tension between protecting our own high \nstandards of production and pursuing a cheap food trade policy will be resolved.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nBritish farmers could be sending beef to China by 2021 after the country lifted a 22-year ban on beef imports.\n\nThe move, which is likely to help carcass values by increasing demand for cuts not favoured by British consumers, \nis still subject to negotiations on market access, which are expected to take three years.\n\nSee also: Trading with China: Opportunities for livestock producers\n\nChina took in almost 700,000t of the meat last year, and is now the world\u2019s second-largest beef importer after the \nUS.\n\nAs recently as 2010 it took in just 23,000t, but consumer demand is soaring for the meat, seen as a leaner, \nhealthier alternative to pork.\n\nTermination of the UK ban, which was put in place at the time of the BSE crisis, comes after a successful inspection \nvisit in April 2018 by Chinese officials.\n\n\n\nLast year, Chinese consumers purchased more than \u00a3560m worth of British food and drink and the AHDB suggests \nthat beef could add \u00a3250m of additional value in the first five years of trading.\n\nPhil Hadley, AHDB international market development director, said he was delighted with the lifting of the ban. He \ndrew a parallel with British exports of pork to China, which began in 2012 and had grown to a \u00a374m market just four \nyears later.\n\n\"Today's news follows years of collaboration between the AHDB, government and industry to make this a reality \nand we now look forward to seeing UK beef exported to the country for the first time in over 20 years,\" he said.\n\n\u201cWe will now begin the work on the export protocols and approvals to allow commercial shipments to begin.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nAll the money spent on the CAP in England should be transferred to a new \u201cpublic money for public goods\u201d scheme \nin England \u2013 and possibly more, if farmers are to be incentivised to take part.\n\nThat is one of the key demands from the CLA, which has issued its detailed proposals for a Land Management \nContract (LMC) to replace the Basic Payments Scheme following a post-Brexit transition.\n\nSee also: Gove unveils clampdown on farm pollution\n\nThe LMC concept was first mooted by the CLA in July last year. The idea is to give farmers a menu of ways they \ncan manage land to deliver public benefits.\n\nThey will effectively sign a contract with government, and receive payments based on what they contribute, rather \nthan the amount of land they own.\n\nThese ideas have now been fleshed out in a report from the CLA called The Land Management Contract \u2013 Design \nand Delivery in England, which it describes as \u201cpositive, progressive and pragmatic\u201d.\n\nThe LMC should not be the only tool, says the CLA, but should be one part of a wider policy \u201cto boost profitable \nfarming and forestry through improved productivity, competitiveness and resilience within a thriving rural economy\u201d.\n\nBut a new contract with government should also be used to deliver things such as clean water, carbon storage, \nenhanced public access, biodiversity, heritage and sustainable farming practices.\n\nProper funding\n\nThe paper emphasises that, while a new public goods scheme based on LMCs would present significant \nopportunities for environmental improvement, \u201cthese benefits will only be delivered if the new scheme attracts \nfarmers and land managers by making good business sense\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis will require the government to commit to transferring, over time, at least the current CAP spend into the new \npublic goods scheme, to ensure sufficient incentive.\u201d\n\nIn England, the spend under the CAP is \u00a32.2bn/year.\n\n\u201cFor a long time, the CLA has advocated a policy that incentivises land managers to deliver public goods like \ncreating new habitats for wildlife, action to improve soil quality and delivering high standards of animal welfare,\u201d said \nCLA president Tim Breitmeyer.\n\n\u201cThis policy will succeed if it sits alongside a clear plan for supporting profitable food production, through a transition \nperiod and for the long term.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis means sufficient investment into the scheme, whilst avoiding unnecessary complexities and burdensome red \ntape. It also means long-term guaranteed payments, so that farm businesses can have the certainty that is crucial \nin planning for a resilient future.\u201d\n\nWhat the Land Management Contract looks like\n\nThe CLA sets out four key elements:\n\nA universal LMC \u2013 available to all, with a menu of options to choose from, with payments based on a points system\n\nA universal capital LMC \u2013 one-off payments for infrastructure improvements that deliver public benefits\n\nAn enhanced LMC \u2013 to encourage more complex land management, with collaboration. This would be open to \ntender and involves one-off and ongoing payments\n\nLandscape scales restoration projects \u2013 aimed at improving large areas of degraded landscape\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe government has been cautioned against making major changes to the inheritance tax (IHT) system on the \nground it could lead to major upheaval for farm businesses.\n\nBut the Country Land and Business Association has called for small changes to the administration and \ninterpretation of inheritance rules \u2013 in particular asking for IHT relief to be available to farmers and landowners who \nhave diversified into furnished holiday lets.\n\nThe demands appear in the association\u2019s official response to a review of the IHT framework being carried out by the \nOffice of Tax Simplification.\n\nSee also: Inheritance tax review forces succession plan changes\n\nThe main points the CLA makes are:\n\nThe current IHT reliefs of agricultural property relief (APR) and business property relief (BPR) are vitally important \nto the agricultural industry so working farms do not have to be broken up following a death.\n\nFarmers are already facing significant change through the replacement of the CAP with a new domestic agricultural \npolicy and major changes to the inheritance regime at this time of uncertainty will make it impossible for individual \nfarming businesses to plan.\n\nThe deadline for settling any IHT liability (currently six months after death) should be realigned so it is the same as \nthe deadline for submitting the relevant IHT paper work (12 months after death).\n\nFurnished holiday lets are not considered as trading for IHT purpose, even though they are deemed a trade for \nincome tax and capital gains purposes. This is not helpful when many farming businesses have diversified into the \ntourism sector to build non-agricultural income streams.\n\nRelief from IHT should be available for any business that undertakes economic activities in order to support \ndiversification.\n\nIf IHT relief is not available to anyone letting out land then the availability for land for tenant farmers could disappear \nas landowners take ground in-hand. All let land should qualify for 100% relief (currently pre-1995 AHA land is \ngranted a 50% rate and farm business tenancies get 100% relief).\n\n\nCLA president Tim Breitmeyer said: \u201cBrexit will bring significant and fundamental change for many land-based \nbusinesses across the countryside. In order to respond, many will need to invest to increase profitability, \nproductivity and accelerate growth.\n\n\u201cThis includes more farm businesses seeking new income streams from activities like tourism that sit alongside their \ncore farming business. It is important those who do this are not penalised by current inheritance tax rules.\n\n \u201cAlso, as government policy clearly identifies a switch to encouraging more public good activities on rural land as a \ncore policy objective, it must ensure landowners who respond do not get penalised by the inheritance tax system.\n\n\u201cFor example, land dedicated to environmental schemes must benefit from the same reliefs as agricultural land.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nClaas has added smaller models to its Volto tedder and Liner rake ranges, making them suitable for farms still keen \nto run their own machinery and maintain control over part of their silage and haymaking.\n\nThe new four-rotor Volto 55 has a working width of 5.2m and can spread two swaths from a 3m mower. Its Max \nSpread system uses tines angled by 29deg to produce a longer sweep, collect more crop and encourage the \nmaterial to flow between the rotors in a straight line to reduce crop damage.\n\nClaas says the end result of this is a wider and more even spread pattern with fewer lumps and quicker drying.\n\nThe drive system incorporates a finger clutch at the pivot points that allows the arms to be folded hydraulically by up \nto 180deg for transport.\n\nEach of the 1.5m diameter rotors is fitted with six 10.5mm tines and the spreading angle can be adjusted by \nbetween 12deg and 16deg without needing tools.\n\nThe starting price is \u00a37,610 and options include a guide wheel and edge-spreading guard.\n\nSee also: One-pass Wecan reseeder reduces workload for Devon contractors\n\nElsewhere, the new single-rotor Liner 320 completes the company\u2019s range of compact rakes and has a working \nwidth of 3.2m.\n\nAs with larger Liner models, the rotor drive is completely sealed and continuously lubricated.

So we have to bear in mind how \nquickly we can realistically get to that point. In the UK as an industry we are calving at 28-29 months, so there\u2019s \nhuge scope for bringing this down. Heifers that calve by 24 months are cheaper to rear and produce more milk \nthroughout their lifetime\".\n\nBelow, we summarise the guidance on how heifer calves should be fed in the first few hours, weeks and months of \nlife, up until weaning, to ensure they hit vital targets.\n\nColostrum management\n\nChoosing a powder\n\nFeeding the calf up to weaning\n\nTargets\n\nMilk mixing protocols\n\nSupplementary feeding advice\n\nColostrum management\n\nColostrum is a true \u201csuperfood\u201d and if fed correctly, it can provide the calf with immunity to fight off disease \nchallenges.\n\nHowever, calf rearers have a short window to ensure antibodies are absorbed to their full potential, said Mr \nO\u2019Sullivan. He explained how much should be fed and how quickly:\n\nQuantity: 10% of bodyweight.\n\nQuickly: Three litres in the first three hours of life. The absorption of immunoglobulins drops significantly six hours \nafter birth.\n\nQuality: Measure colostrum with a refractometer. Aim for more than 22% on the Brix scale for Holsteins and more \nthan 18% for Jerseys. At least 80% of your colostrum tested should be good quality. If it isn\u2019t, it could indicate \nproblems with dry cow and transition management.\n\nCleanly: Bacterial count of less than 100,000 colony-forming unit (cfu)/ml. Total plate count and faecal coliforms \nbelow 10,000 cfu/ml. If it doesn\u2019t meet cleanliness standards, absorption rates can drop by 50%.\n\nSafely: Colostrum, if frozen, should be thawed at no more than 80C for 15 minutes. A higher temperature will \ndenature the antibodies.\n\nQuantify: Bloods can be taken in the first week of life to check the volume of colostrum antibodies that have been \nabsorbed into the calf\u2019s bloodstream. Ask your vet to take some samples and monitor the results.\n\nChoosing a milk replacer \u2013 what to look for\n\nSkim or whey-based powders?\n\n\n\nSkimmed milk powders are typically about 80% casein and 20% whey. The casein forms a clot in the abomasum \nand is digested like whole milk \u2013 slowly over time.\n\nIn comparison, whey-based milk powders are digested much more quickly and in the absence of casein, do not \nform a clot. They are a by-product of cheese production.\n\nTraditional thinking was that skim was \u201cgold standard\u201d, but we\u2019ve moved on from this, said Mr Richards.\n\n\u201cHigh-quality whey-based powders perform very well, and may encourage earlier dry feed intake.\"\n\nWhat to look for on the label\n\nProtein: Protein levels must support accelerated growth and tissue development in dairy calves in early life. \nProteins should be milk-based for the best performance. Beef calves can be fed lower levels of protein to support \nmore flesh than frame growth. Required level: 20-27%\n\nFat and oil: These will generally be made up of vegetable fats such as soya bean, palm oil and coconut. Too high a \nlevel of vegetable fats will increase the risk of scour. Required level: 16-20%\n\nFibre: This is a good indicator of the protein quality. Required level: Products that contain more than 0.15% contain \nhigher milk protein. More than 0.2% means they are more heavily weighted in lower-quality plant protein sources.\n\nAsh: Indicates the overall level of minerals. Required level: Less than 8%.\n\nTop tips: What to check\n\nIs the calf milk replacer you chose backed up with research and published data?\n\nHas it been manufactured to a high standard?\n\nWill it be consistent? Each batch must be formulated in the same way.\n\nIs it palatable and do calves drink it well?\n\nFeeding the calf up to weaning\n\nWhat quantities to feed up to weaning?\n\nTo obtain daily liveweight gains of 0.75-1kg, calves will require a minimum of 900g of milk powder daily. Below is an \nexample guide of how CMR should be fed from birth to weaning.\n\n \n\nFeeding rates\n\n \n\nDays 1-3\n\n Days 4-7\n\nDay 7\n\nWeek 10\n\nWeek 11\n\nWeek 12\n\n\n\nFeed requirements (litres) fed twice daily\n\n4 litres of colostrum\n\nBuild up to at least 5 litres by day 5\n\n6 litres\n\nOAD\n\nOAD\n\nWeaned\n\nEvery 1C drop in temperature below 5C requires 2% more milk replacer. Have a min/max thermometer in the calf \nshed to monitor the temperature.\n\nTargets\n\nWeaning\n\nCalves should be at least double their birthweight\n\nCalving\n\nHeifers should be 90% of mature weight\n\n22-24 months\n\nTarget age at first calving\n\n226\n\nCalves that grew at 100g extra produced this much extra milk (kg) in their first lactation, according to a study by \nAlex Bach from the Department of Ruminant Production IRTA in Spain\n\n70\n\nThe monthly cost in \u00a3 of delaying age at first calving\n\nMilk-mixing protocols\n\n1. Add half of the water to the bucket. Water should be 40C maximum.\n\n2. Weigh the powder using a scale and a scoop. Remember milk and water combined should make 1 litre. For \nexample, if feeding 900g daily, 150g of powder should be added to 0.85 litres to make up one litre.\n\n3. Add the powder to the water and mix thoroughly using a whisk.\n\n4.  Add the remaining water and mix once again.\n\nSupplementary feeding\n\nFeeding starter nuts\n\nFeed a 20% protein product based on high-quality protein, for example soya/protected soya/distillers' grains rather \nthan than wheat feed and sunflower.\n\n\n\nProvide fibre ad-lib along with chopped straw (2cm) and ensure there is plenty so calves aren\u2019t forced to eat \nbedding and consume pathogens.\n\nWater: Ensure it is clean and there is plenty. Typically, a calf will consume 4 litres of water for every 1kg of starter \nfeed eaten.\n\nSponsors\u2019 message\n\nThanks to Zoetis, Volac and XL Vets, whose sponsorship made it possible for us to run the Rethinking Cattle \nPerformance workshop.

Accredited BVD-clear since 2002, the Rendalls\u2019 herd is also at Johne\u2019s risk \nlevel 1.\n\n\u201cAll four cattle farms on Papay are clear of BVD,\u201d says Mr Rendall, who employs one part-time worker - 29-year-old \nSam Mercer.\n\n\u201cThis gives us the confidence to rely on biosecurity, without vaccination.\n\n\n\u201cThe only cattle we buy in is the occasional stock bull, which is thoroughly tested and isolated for up to four weeks \nbefore joining the herd.\u201d\n\nAnother reason why good health is key is again the farm\u2019s remoteness. The vet needs to fly from Kirkwall to get to \nthe farm and one of the Rendalls\u2019 fields acts as the Papay \u201cairport\u201d runway.\n\n\u201cOther than for routine visits, fortunately we rarely need a vet,\u201d he adds.\n\nSince 2001, OLA has almost cleared the islands of BVD, with more than 95% of Orkney herds (beef and dairy) \ncurrently eligible for accreditation. Until a breakdown in March 2018, no BVD had been found in Orkney for more \nthan 18 months.\n\nSale of stock\n\nPreviously many of the Holland Farm cattle were finished off grass and sold to Scotbeef at Bridge of Allan, near \nStirling. Scotbeef supplies Aberdeen Angus beef to some of Britain\u2019s main retailers, including Marks & Spencer.\n\nDespite farming on the very edge of Britain, the couple are producing top-quality stock and have won Scotbeef\u2019s \nprestigious Aberdeen Angus Beef Finishing competition twice, in 2007 and 2011.\n\nBut now all stock is sold as stores, between 15-17 months, through Orkney Auction Market in Kirkwall to capitalise \non the excellent trade, which is yielding a better premium than finishing stock, they say.\n\nWith no roll-on, roll-off ferry facility on Papay, all cargo too heavy to carry is craned on to the ferry, which calls on \nTuesdays and Fridays.\n\nThe Rendalls\u2019 cattle travel to the ferry in the farm livestock trailer, which is then carefully hoisted from the pier to the \nferry deck. The cattle remain in this trailer until unloaded in Kirkwall mart. The trailer, crammed full of straw to avoid \nfreight costs, returns on the next Papay ferry.\n\nAll traded Orkney auction cattle, plus finished stock direct from farm, travel to the livestock lairage at Kirkwall ferry \nterminal, where they are loaded for their journey to Aberdeen into specifically designed transport trailers.\n\nThese trailers provide more comfort for the travelling bovines than most human commuter trains. Facilities include \nfeed, water, inspection ladders and lights, plus a \u201chospital\u201d pen.\n\nCurrently there are no livestock slaughter facilities in Orkney. A consortium of Orkney butchers hope that by early \n2019, they will have new premises where they will be able to slaughter and process approximately 20 cattle, 25 \nlambs and 15 pigs a week.\n\nPapa Westray and Orkney\n\nMeasures 4.5 miles by \u00bc mile and its highest point is just 157ft\n\nTotal land area is 1,000ha\n\nIt has four farmers and a population of just 70\n\nBeef cattle are the cornerstone of the Orkney economy. There are currently 30,000 beef cows farmed on 93,000ha \n\u2013 regarded as the densest population of beef cows in Europe\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThieves behind a countryside crimewave are

Weekly\n\nAs June arrives, the disease and pest threats continue to occupy our agronomists\u2019 minds with concerns of brown \nrust growing in the South.\n\nFlea beetles are hammering linseed crops in the East and weed control is proving tricky in beans.\n\nOne rare bit of good news has been the recovery in barley in the South West, as warmer temperatures and rain \narrived back in May.\n\nSouth: Iain Richards\n\nAgrii (Oxfordshire)\n\nBrown rust is one of our key concerns as most wheats receive their flag leaf sprays.\n\nSticking to our T0 guns and maintaining robust T1s means we\u2019ve yet to see significant signs of infection.\n\nHowever, the worrying number of reports we\u2019re getting locally show the cold, late spring hasn\u2019t done the job we \nhoped it might.\n\nWith Agrii research showing about 70% of the main varieties in the ground at high risk from brown rust and the \nsheer amount of Crusoe being grown, we\u2019re not taking any chances here.\n\nIt\u2019s a disease we cannot afford to be chasing. \n\nSee also: T3 spray tips for battling ear blight in wheat\n\nSo, Solatenol (benzovindiflupyr) is our T2 SDHI of choice wherever we have any varietal concerns.\n\nSupporting this with an epoxiconazole/metconazole co-formulation and a multisite protectant should give us the \npeace of mind we need in our septoria management as well.\n\n\n\nDry weather has kept infections nicely confined to the base of most crops so far. However, we know how rapidly \nthings can change especially in light of forecast rainfall.\n\nGreen leaf area\n\nCrop performance this season will be all about working hard on maintaining green leaf area to compensate for the \nvery slow start to spring growth.\n\nThis will be particularly important for crops on heavier ground, which didn\u2019t get their nitrogen nearly as early as we\u2019d \nhave liked.\n\nMany of these are decidedly thin when you get into them, having lost many tillers, making the contribution of their \nlower leaves to grain fill more vital than ever.\n\nMaximising grains/ear will be crucial too. So we\u2019re including more magnesium in our T2s to encourage both \nphotosynthesis and N use. With the weather as dry as it has been, minimising stress in the run-up to flowering is \nkey.\n\nWe will also be keeping a very close eye on orange blossom midge levels. Reports suggest adult midges are \nemerging at about the same time as crops are susceptible for the first time in recent years.\n\nThere\u2019s a brutally short control window, many varieties aren\u2019t resistant and our chemical armoury is limited to say \nthe least.\n\nEast: Sean Sparling\n\nAICC/SAS Agronomy (Lincolnshire)\n\nT2 fungicides are now being applied across winter wheats and barleys and judging by ear size, there\u2019s potential for \na good harvest.\n\nHowever, with noticeably shorter crops and late spring cereal drillings, straw may be in short supply. The \nimplications for livestock farmers are concerning \u2013 isn\u2019t it time they took priority over power stations?\n\nSeptoria has been held back by T1s, but lurks in the base and remains the significant threat, although on Reflection \nwheat, yellow rust continues to frustrate. Mildew is widespread, but, where a prothioconazole-based T2 is used, the \nneed for additional mildewicides reduces.\n\nBlackgrass levels are low where crops were drilled late and robust pre-emergence herbicides were applied, despite \nfew contact herbicide applications.\n\nMost spring barley is receiving T1 fungicide/herbicide mixtures. Rhynchosporium and net blotch is always \nthreatening alongside low levels of mildew and abiotic spotting.\n\nSpring wheat woes\n\nOverall, spring barley is lush and vigorous \u2013 more than can be said for some spring wheats, which have whined \nsince the day they went in.\n\nOilseed rape is largely out of flower, but with the weather we have seen, protectant sclerotinia sprays have been \nvital.\n\nSeed weevil numbers are moderate on headlands, but minimal within the field. Therefore, that situation is still being \nmonitored.\n\n\n\nWinter beans display high levels of chocolate spot due to early season stress and initial bruchid beetle migration \ncoincided with first pods being set.\n\nPea and bean weevil continue to assault both winter and spring beans as well as peas, but with warm soils and \nsome welcome rain, crop growth is rapid and notching is being outgrown.\n\nFlea beetles are hammering some linseed crops, but the sugar beet is growing almost as fast as the weeds. \nHowever, with near constant winds, it\u2019s proving a challenge to get the required fine quality sprays applied when \nrequired.\n\nWest: Stephen Harrison\n\nAICC/Southwest Agronomy (Avon)\n\nThundery rain has eased drought stress on crops. I was concerned for the security of some heavy hybrid barley \ncrops during the deluges, however, a walk around a few local fields shows that they are still standing. \n\nEarlier in the spring, I bemoaned the state of barley on heavy wet soils. Their recovery, as temperatures improved \nand rain fell, has been dramatic. I am so pleased we did not succumb to the temptation to write off or redrill these \nfields.\n\nDecision-making on poor crops is invariably tricky, as there is always a temptation to take no chances and destroy \nthe evidence. The early Victorian naturalists had a saying: \u201cWhat\u2019s shot is history, what\u2019s left a mystery.\u201d\n\nWheat is now approaching ear emergence. Disease is largely confined to leaf five with more susceptible varieties \nshowing a little septoria on leaf four. \n\nWhile disease is never welcome, this lower canopy infection combined with a clean leaf three suggests most of the \nT1 fungicides went where they were intended.\n\nMosaic virus\n\nThe only yellow rust prone variety we grow is Zulu, being resistant to soil-borne cereal mosaic virus. Despite a \nrelatively low rust risk, spring spray misses in this variety have been taken out. \n\nOur only other mosaic virus resistant varieties are Cordiale and Claire.  Frequent questioning of plant breeders \nsuggests there is little or no new material coming through.\n\nOn the subject of viruses, we are also seeing resistance breaking strains of barley yellow mosaic virus appearing. \nVarietal resistance to the virus is a single gene, so it is not surprising that other strains are infecting crops.\n\nIf you have unusual symptoms in winter barley I suggest you have the presence of virus confirmed or refuted by \nFera. The virus is carried by a soil fungus, so care should be taken not to spread infected soil.\n\nOf further concern in barley is the appearance of loose smut on crops grown from treated seed.\n\nOn the positive side with viruses, the barley yellow virus tolerant variety, Amistar, looks to be performing well in our \nsecond year of field-scale trials.\n\nNorth: Andy Goulding\n\nCAS/Hutchinsons (Cheshire)\n\nA familiar tale of one extreme to the other: we started the year with an awful winter and early spring, but we are now \nleaving behind an exceedingly hot and dry May.\n\n\n\nThe residing moisture is available for established autumn-sown and early sown spring combinable crops (of which \nthere are few).\n\nThere doesn\u2019t look to be many lazy rooting spring crops, but none the less, a little flurry of rain has just kept \neverything establishing.\n\nWheat T2 is on the last leg of the run and crops are still all over the place, with the seasonal calendar unable to get \nthings to an equilibrium due to the huge array of planting dates and poor early growing conditions.\n\nWe\u2019ve gone from exceptionally high septoria pressure to low, and rates have been tuned accordingly.\n\nMoisture for establishment is not an issue with potatoes that have been planted late, as it can be found around the \nseed tuber, and there's plenty of energy left in there yet.\n\nRidge moisture may reduce efficacy of the residual herbicides, which we so majorly rely on.\n\nHowever, with little moisture in the outermost part of the ridge, weed emergence is also delayed.\n\nProduct selection and rate is going to be geared around the half-life of the active ingredient, as we strive for \npersistency for when the flushes come.\n\nWeed challenge\n\nBeans have also been subject to the same dilemma, with residual herbicides not achieving the desired control.\n\nIn instances where broad-leaved weeds will become competitive, post-emergence products are being used. Be \nmindful of the narrow application window and potential for herbicide damage \u2013 these are best applied during the \ncooler part of the day.  \n\nDespite mainly being late drilled, maize is mostly up and away, and looking good with no cold snap to hold it back.\n\nPost-emergence herbicides are a little off yet, but I will be using other chemistry as terbuthylazine starts its phase \nout from the market.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe large swings in temperature and rainfall in recent weeks are taking their toll.\n\nWith memories of flooded fields still fresh in the mind, some crops are now showing signs of drought stress, partly \ndue to their underdeveloped root systems.\n\nThe extremes in temperature have even led to crops bolting, with reports of spring beans flowering while only 4in \ntall.\n\nSee also: Crop Watch: Spray now to tackle septoria burden\n\nOilseed rape crops in the North, as well as winter barleys are struggling. The one glimmer of hope is spring barley, \nand growers are being advised to think of growth regulation to help stimulate rooting and tillering.\n\nSouth: Kevin Knight\n\nZantra (Kent)\n\nThere has been a lot of weather fluctuations this May. Temperatures from high 20s down to frosts, 3in of rain in a \n24-hour period with another 1in a couple of days later.\n\nNow spring-drilled crops could do with a drop, but are enjoying some warmth after a week of cold, harsh northerlies.\n\n\n\nFluctuations between these extremes have made some crops bolt and others sit still. With spring beans it\u2019s both \u2013 \nbolting to flowering while sitting at 4in tall (not helping them grow away from weevil pressure).\n\nSee also: Why growing triticale can help you earn more\n\nWinter cereals look green, superficially clean and generally rather pleasing. They usually do in late May.\n\nWhere crops went in well and a reasonable programme was applied (despite the challenges), it is still easy to find \nseptoria on leaf 4, and higher up where compromises or delays went further than they should have.\n\nStressed crops are showing increases in mildew activity, particularly on sandy areas where drought kicks in earlier.\n\nYellow rust has been kept in check thus far, but stripes on the odd leaf of Skyfall and Zulu influenced the T2s going \non late/second wheats this week. Mine consisted of SDHI (Solatenol) plus a good dose of an azole, some \nchlorothalonil and a mildewicide.\n\nWith heavy rain washing nutrients away, I\u2019m adding a broad-spectrum foliar feed where needed on current and \nsubsequent passes through the crop.\n\nSpring crops\n\nSpring cereals are moving apace now, and close attention to early plant growth regulator and fungicide timing will \nbe necessary.\n\nWith spring barley, front load your fungicide spend \u2013 get the big guns out early (SDHI + prothioconazole) to keep a \nclean crop, then you can apply a more economical top-up the second time around.\n\nThe warm weather has brought a few bruchid beetles out. It is too early to have much of an effect, as most winter \nbeans are just developing pods on the bottom trusses. However, beware if you are chasing that attractive human \nconsumption premium.\n\nPotato planting is just finished, late, but generally went in well. We have had confirmed cases of blight in dumps in \nKent over recent weeks and have hit Hutton periods this week, so where there is a potato canopy, it\u2019s being treated.\n\nFluazinam isn\u2019t having the desired effect on the EU37 strain, so my programmes will involve mancozeb and \ncymoxanil until the canopy gets moving rapidly. At that point we\u2019ll use more mobile actives such as propamocarb.\n\nEast: Marcus Mann\n\nFrontier (Essex)\n\nAs the season begins to catch up, the flag leaf has emerged in winter wheat and T2s are under way. The wet \nweather in March and April has meant there is active Septoria tritici in many crops, with leaves 4 and 5 in \nsusceptible varieties expressing significant visible symptoms.\n\nWith the importance of keeping the flag leaf clean, T2 sprays are being based on robust rates of SDHI and azole \nalong with a multisite to prevent any resistance developing.\n\nYellow rust is also present within the more-susceptible varieties. The addition of a strobilurin will help add additional \nprotection against rust as well as helping to retain green leaf.\n\nMagnesium is the most important nutrient to apply with the T2, as the crops are beginning the period of maximum \ngrowth and biomass production. This will also enhance specific weight and protein levels in the grain for all quality \nwheat crops.\n\nRapid growth\n\n\n\nSpring cereals are racing through their growth stages and reaching their T1 timing. While plant growth regulators \nare not routine on spring barley, more is now being grown on heavier, more fertile soils for blackgrass control.\n\nWith the late drilling, shorter growing period and increased seed-bed nitrogen, this could result in poor rooting \nleading to poor tiller formation and retention. So manipulating the main apical dominance as well as stem \nstrengthening should be considered, even if not applying a T1 fungicide on the less-disease-susceptible varieties. \n\nAphid numbers are currently low. However, AHDB/Rothamsted monitoring reports indicate the three main cereal \naphids have been found in suction traps. Crops should be considered at risk of barley yellow dwarf virus until \ngrowth stage 31.\n\nBlack bean aphid has just begun to become active within pulse crops, so monitor as temperatures increase.\n\nWest: Giles Simpson\n\nPearce Seeds (Somerset)\n\nWhat a difference a few weeks make. Crops that were drowning six weeks ago are now looking for a drink. I never \nthought I would say that. The recent dry spell we all wished for is now stressing crops that have poor root structure \nfollowing the winter\u2019s wet weather.\n\nThe early-season wet conditions meant most of the crops received their fertiliser late. The winter barleys are now \nreally showing this and are generally thin. I don\u2019t hold out much hope of them yielding well, although they are \nrelatively free from disease.\n\nThe winter wheats are all over the place in growth stage. Many are now at T2, but I have some backward crops that \nare still only growth stage 33. This has made for a very taxing season so far.\n\nThere is plenty of septoria around and noticeably more where the T0 was omitted or T1 was late due to ground \nconditions. Siskin looks to be the best at the moment. Of all the late-drilled wheat, Anapolis looks as though it has \nsurvived the best and held on to tillers.\n\nSpring barley\n\nThe spring crops have emerged very quickly and evenly. The spring barleys have received manganese and growth \nregulator. Very few weeds have emerged, so these will be dealt with when the fungicide goes on.\n\nMost of the maize is now drilled and is emerging well. Some seed-beds were drying out very quickly and, hopefully, \nseed has been drilled into moisture. Some pre-emergence sprays have been put on, but in the past week there has \nbeen much debate about whether it\u2019s worth doing. Who knows what the next few weeks will bring?\n\nI decided to go with just pendimethalin rather than a more expensive option just in case it stays dry. Some seed \nrates were lowered to allow for the fact that most maize was being drilled about a fortnight later than normal.\n\nNorth: Patrick Stephenson\n\nAICC (Yorkshire)\n\nNo two seasons are the same, and this one is certainly different, with huge swings in temperatures \u2013 often more \nthan 20C movements in 24 hours. Crops have changed beyond all recognition and although much is aesthetic, it \nhas made crop walking more rewarding.\n\nOilseed rape crops are a real mix. Some are flowering, some have finished, and some just started. None has really \nflushed that eye-watering bright yellow. It has been a real task to judge sclerotinia spray timings and even decide if \nthe crop is going to flower.\n\n\n\nI will be glad to shut the gate on OSR this year, as everything seems to have conspired to make the crop struggle \nand I fear the yield outlook is not good.\n\nSimilarly, winter barley on heavy land is a sorry sight, and any thoughts of copious straw yields to replenish stocks \ncan be dismissed. Light land crops are more hopeful and all have now received their final fungicide, with \nchlorothalonil included to combat ramularia.\n\nSpring barley is far more hopeful and despite the late drilling, emergence has been fast. Crops are now receiving \nherbicides and, depending on plant stand, some are receiving growth regulator to encourage tillering.\n\nAlthough these crops will be very dependent on the weather, particularly rainfall, over the coming months, they \nhave certainly started well.\n\nWinter wheat crops have at long last picked up and are a rich, dark green, feeding off the reservoir of applied \nnitrogen. Unfortunately, many are best viewed at 55mph from the road.\n\nHeavy land woes\n\nOnce again the heavy land is, in general, not a pretty sight and there certainly is no requirement for further growth \nregulation. Despite all the early spring rain, septoria is contained in the lower canopy.\n\nYellow rust is bubbling away and despite many varieties having theoretical good resistance, the rapid changes in \nstrains means no variety can guaranteed resistance.\n\nThe recent rapid crop growth, with a new leaf appearing every week, means spray intervals will be short, with some \ncrops receiving three fungicides in the space of six weeks.\n\nAt this point, I part company with many of my more learned colleagues, as with such tight spray timings I have no \nappetite for high SDHI rates and have moved to \u201cappropriate\u201d doses. \n\nWinter beans are now flowering and will be due a chocolate spot spray very soon. Spring beans have emerged well \non the whole and weed control is good, with the usual rape volunteers surviving.\n\nThese volunteers always cause a headache, with much debate about Basagran (bentazone) and its use. If there is \na more frustrating herbicide than Basagran I have yet to meet it. Performance can range from good to \u201care you sure \nyou put the chemical in?\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA lack of rainfall in recent weeks may have helped curb some disease threats such as potato blight in the North, but \nthere are growing concerns on the impact of crop yields.\n\nThe vital grain-filling period is upon us and this week\u2019s heatwave is likely to see some crops wither away with many \nalready stressed due to lack of rainfall. Spring barley in the South, in particular, is being hit hard.\n\nAnother concern for our agronomists is the poor blackgrass control in some fields, which will prompt a rethink on \nstrategy for next season.\n\nSouth: Iain Richards\n\nAgrii (Oxfordshire)\n\nOrange blossom midge proved just as troublesome as we feared it might. And along with brown rust in wheat and \nlack of moisture in spring barley, it remains a particular concern as we move towards what could be a promising \nharvest.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a good 15 years since we\u2019ve had to treat such a large area for blossom midge and, with only pyrethroids in our \narmoury, we\u2019re now finding a worrying number of larvae in the ears of some crops.\n\nSee also: What the neonic seed treatment ban means for sugar beet\n\nAcute midge problems meant some T3s went on slightly earlier than we\u2019d have liked to avoid the need for separate \nsprays within barely a week. Fine for fusarium protection, this has left us with the challenge of keeping the many \nvarieties at high risk of brown rust clean at a time we\u2019re forecast to get the hot, dry weather the disease loves.\n\nThankfully, our T2-T3 interval was well under three weeks in most cases. So continued activity from Solatenol \n(benzovindiflupyr) we used widely as our flag leaf SDHI on susceptible varieties should bolster our T3 azole \ncombinations.\n\nWe\u2019re not planning to do so, but if brown rust comes in to any significant extent we won\u2019t hesitate to go back in with \na T4. Especially for the later wheats that need to stay green for another four weeks.\n\nWe may have been cursing it back in April, but having more than enough moisture in the ground going into the \nsummer has been a godsend. No rain worth mentioning for three weeks is leaving winter crops on the gravels \nlooking stressed. However, it hasn\u2019t done most of our acreage much harm yet.\n\nSpring barley woes\n\nThe same cannot, unfortunately, be said for our spring barleys. Where they went in well and got enough early \nnitrogen they\u2019re carrying a decent number of tillers.\n\nWhile March drillings are averaging nearly 30 grains/ear, those that didn\u2019t go in until mid-April have less than 20 \ngrains/ear. And they\u2019re all badly in need of a drink.\n\nIt definitely won\u2019t be a record spring barley year. Having said that, feed prices are firm and malting premiums are \nholding-up. So decent spring barleys will repay the effort put into creating them.\n\nWe\u2019ve been very pleased with the grassweed control we\u2019ve achieved this season but incredibly disappointed with \nthe few cases in which a spring clean-up has been needed. This has underlined we no longer have any reliable \nfallback once winter crops are established \u2013 even where blackgrass levels are moderate. \n\nEast: Sean Sparling\n\nAICC/SAS Agronomy (Lincolnshire)\n\nWinter wheat and barley are now on the final push, though wet weather throughout flowering may yet cause us \nproblems with fusarium ear blight, but ear and foliar disease levels still appear remarkably low. Crops are still \nstanding too.\n\nBlackgrass is an annoyance in a few too many fields and weed-wipers, mowers, sprayers and roguing gangs are a \ncommon sight on the wolds, heath and fen alike.\n\nIt may be a case of going back to basics this autumn with the emphasis on attention to detail \u2013 glyphosate for initial \nflushes, delayed drillings, quality seed-beds, rotations crucial, nerves of steel and vital targeted use of robust \nresiduals \u2013 a combination of all these is crucial.\n\nSpring barley and spring wheat are finished as far as fungicides go. Much higher levels of rhynchosporium, net \nblotch, abiotic spotting and ramularia are being seen, but no surprise thanks to the stresses of a late drilling season, \nsnow, heatwaves, torrential downpours, hurricanes and frosts. The frosts caused high levels of blind grain sites in \nsome areas.\n\nSpring wheat\n\n\n\nSpring wheats look good, but may yet show the wisdom of \u201ccuckoo wheat\u201d folklore. Sugar beet is now at full cover \nin many fields with no disease, bugs, moths or leaf miners to report.\n\nPeas and beans are flowering and podding well, however, downy mildew and botrytis are an issue due to the \nblighty conditions. Thankfully, the bug and beetle levels remain manageable \u2013 for now at least.\n\nWith Hutton periods occurring almost every day, potato blight programmes are necessarily robust and routine \u2013 \nseven day plans are in full force.\n\nThis season continues to frustrate. Two weeks ago, 83mm of rain fell in 95 minutes 12 miles away and I took just \n0.2mm the same day and only 7mm this month.\n\nGrowers are desperate for rain and are irrigating beet and cereals in fields with cracks 3in across, while over-wetted \nneighbours gaze guiltily from just over their lush hedges.\n\nNorth: Andy Goulding\n\nCAS/Hutchinsons (Cheshire)\n\nWith only 28mm of rain in May and 6mm in June (at the time of writing) there are many combinable crops now \nstarting to wither away. With a heatwave forecast there are likely to be many more casualties, especially those \ncrops with shallower roots.\n\nMany spring cereals have been under such stress they have skipped tillering with producing offspring as the only \ngoal.\n\nSoil texture differences within field are now obvious to spot with the sandier patches going off to a line.\n\nWe now lie in hope the forecast will change and crops will have some rain to help fill what grain sites are there.\n\nThis year seems one of those extremely rare occasions where the East\u2019s weather has swapped with the West\u2019s.\n\nWith no rain to wash granular fertiliser in, there have been many applications of amine nitrogen as a foliar spray.\n\nThis is now finding a firm place as a genuine part of a nutrition programme with its far superior, simple and safe \nuptake and excellent tank mix-ability.\n\nPotato pressure\n\nBlight pressure is low and as such there is no requirement for curative products or tight intervals at present. The \nproblem we have faced, however, has been weed control. Even timed to the most favourable of application \nwindows we have still had problems.\n\nCloddy seed-beds from a wet spring and bone dry ridges has led to the word Titus (rimsulfuron) cropping up all \nacross town.\n\nThis is the last thing we want in current conditions in late-planted crops, but where not applied, I have heard of \nsome particularly weedy scenarios competing hard with the crop.\n\nMaize crops are also a mixed bag. Some had just about finished the flush of weeds and were about to close over \nthe rows, which made herbicide timing difficult. In other crops that are struggling, you can still walk between the \nrows without too much resistance from brushing your legs on the leaves.\n\nThere have been many purpled and yellowed crops as they have struggled to extract nutrition from the soil so there \nhas been plenty of foliar intervention including nutrition and biostimulants to help them on their delayed flight from \nthe ground.\n\n\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA warmer than average May has seen crops motor through their growth stages and help reduce disease pressure \nnorth of the border.\n\nEven after a strange spring, there are still some surprises being seen in crops, the most notable is higher levels of \nloose smut appearing in barley ears.\n\nIt is affecting a range of crops, including those that had a seed treatment, and agronomists suggest further \ninvestigations are needed to reveal the causes.\n\nNorth: Mary Munro\n\nAICC/Strutt & Parker (Perthshire)\n\nThe warm dry weather of the past four weeks has kept disease at bay in Scotland.\n\nOur most troublesome diseases are those that like the wet, and this season there is a marked lack of septoria in \nwheat, which is a joy for all concerned.\n\nMost crops are at or near ear emergence this week which is not far off the norm. I have tried some Elatus Era \n(benzovindiflupyr + prothioconazole) this year, but there may not be much pressure on it to compare with other T2 \nproducts \u2013 we will see what the rest of the season brings.\n\nSee also: How to manage disease in sugar beet crops\n\nHaving skipped T0 without ill effect, I am not planning to omit any further treatments, and the risk of heavy localised \nshowers means a degree of septoria protection has to be maintained at T3. However, I may tinker slightly with the \nrates and not go over the top.\n\nPod-fill\n\nWinter barley and oilseed rape are suddenly round the corner and into grain- and pod-fill. The oilseed rape had a \ndry flowering period and with virtually all petals off, the disease risk is lower here too.\n\nIt is a difficult crop to predict \u2013 crops look great this season, but appearances can often be deceptive. There seem \nto be plenty of pods, the question is how many seeds will they hold?\n\nSpring barleys have motored on undeterred since sowing. They have tillered out well, and again the usual \nrhynchosporium and mildew challenges have not materialised so far.\n\nI have one or two crops earmarked for a single spray fungicide strategy, while the less marginal ones will have a \nrestrained T1 and a Siltra (bixafen + prothioconazole) plus chlorothalonil.\n\nWest: Antony Wade\n\nHillhampton Technical Services (Herefordshire/Shropshire)\n\n\u201cMotor in May\u201d has never been truer than this season with all crops rushing through their growth stages in a warmer \nthan average May.\n\nAs always nature has a phenomenal ability of making up for lost time to ensure crops are flowering around the time \nof the summer solstice.\n\n\n\nAt present, with ears emerging on forward crops, disease control looks to be holding up but, with recent heavy rain \nfrom thunderstorms, it is too early to assess septoria control strategies as this will not really be revealed until the \nthird week in June at the earliest.\n\nMy T3 spend will be modest as it is difficult to justify a large spend for ear disease when you can only expect \nmoderate control and the timing is difficult to get right, especially if we have showers around flowering.\n\nWinter barley crops romped through later growth stages making late plant growth regulator applications difficult to \nachieve, but they are generally are shorter than normal, which I hope will mean they will stand although the recent \nthunderstorms and heavy rainfall are testing them.\n\nDisease control so far is good with chlorothalonil added in at T2 for ramularia control. On hybrid varieties, \nfluxapyroxad was used to try to reduce risk of brackling.\n\nLoose smut mystery\n\nAs has been reported in the press, I have noticed some loose smut infected ears in some barley crops it will be \ninteresting to understand if this is the start of this disease getting through fungicidal seed treatment.\n\nOilseed crops are almost impossible to assess for yield potential and I have not seen the significant pod abortion \nreported in some crops elsewhere. Flowering period was short which I predicted in my last blog and very interesting \nto read this may be linked to higher yield so we are hopeful.\n\nSpring cereals that have only been in the ground about four weeks have really started to move and are heading into \nstem extension. The recent rainfall was welcome to help keep them growing.\n\nContact weed-control plans will be made shortly, once we have seen what weed germination has been stimulated \nby the rains.\n\nSpring beans are similarly motoring away escaping the weevil attack with some grassweed emerging this will \nreceive a graminicide shortly.\n\nEast: Marion Self\n\nPrime Agriculture (Suffolk)\n\nWinter wheat ears have emerged and are flowering. Orange wheat blossom midge (OWBM) populations have been \nhigh in some locations while, in other areas, populations have remained below threshold.\n\nIt is a relief most crops are beyond the susceptible stage from ear emergence to flowering.\n\nT3 fungicide applications are planned this week to protect crops from fusarium infections during flowering and to top \nup foliar disease control.\n\nDisease in the top of the canopy has been well controlled, although differences in septoria levels on the bottom \nleaves are becoming apparent between varieties.\n\nDuring grain fill, we hope for moderate temperatures to compliment recent rains to maximise yield potential.\n\nFor milling wheat\u2019s, high yield potential will increase the need for a top up of foliar nitrogen to achieve quality \nspecifications, this can be applied until milky ripe.\n\nBruchid risk\n\nIn beans, Bruchid alerts continue as maximum daily temperatures for two consecutive days reach 20C as pods \ndevelop. Chocolate spot will be encouraged by overcast, humid weather.\n\n\n\nAphids pressure is increasing in peas. For all insecticides check product labels for timing of application, maximum \nnumber of treatments and total permitted dose per crop.\n\nSugar beet crops are growing well and weed-control strategies have worked well. Monitor crops and if necessary \nbe ready to apply a final herbicide treatment before row closure, especially where recent showers have encouraged \nanother flush of weeds.\n\nMany of you will be visiting trials demonstrations during the next month. I encourage you to participate in these \nevents; discuss your challenges and seek solutions.\n\nYou will find your neighbour is facing the same issues. All growers are battling blackgrass at some level. \nRemember, the foundation of control starts with good soil management and rotation.\n\nSouth: Richard Harding\n\nProcam, (Sussex)\n\nSome spectacular storms over the Downs have been followed by variable amounts of rain, ranging from none, to up \nto 40mm in places.\n\nWe have, however, escaped the flooding others have experienced.\n\nCrops have stood well with no obvious lodging anywhere.\n\nThe recent rain and rising temperatures have all contributed to rapid crop development as well as increased \ndisease risk.\n\nWheat T2 fungicides have nearly all been applied, and with crops moving quickly into full ear emergence, a T3 \nfungicide consisting of tebuconazole + prothiconazole, will follow shortly. Crops with a high yield potential will also \nreceive a partner strobilurin (pyraclostrobin).\n\nAt ear emergence, the risk of OWBM is higher than normal this season.\n\nSpring barleys vary hugely in growth stages.\n\nWhile some are only just receiving a T1 fungicide/plant growth regulator, others are close to receiving their T2, with \nlate drilled crops just beginning stem extension.\n\nBrown rust can be found in untreated susceptible varieties, as can mildew, with the recent rise in temperatures, and \nhigh humidity.\n\nMildew can be easily found in later-sown crops, as they grow quickly. This makes a two-spray fungicide programme \nessential on spring barley with good yield potential, irrespective of drill date.\n\nBarley ripening\n\nA slight change in colour in some winter barley crops suggests the onset of ripening on the most advanced crops.\n\nLevels of loose smut seem much higher than normal this year, and this will require further investigation, to \nunderstand the possible causes.\n\nDiseased ears have occurred in a range of conventional, and hybrid varieties, and within different seed treatments.\n\nConditions have been perfect for aphids, and a close eye is being kept on late-sown spring cereals, where barley \nyellow dwarf virus could still be a risk, as well as for gout fly eggs on spring wheat and barley.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve yet to find any downy mildew in spring bean crops, but most crops have received at least one fungicide for \nchocolate spot control on winter crops.\n\nConditions are perfect for bruchid beetle, so a well-timed insecticide will be needed where quality is being targeted.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe improved weather in recent weeks has seen wheat fungicide timings get back on schedule with the T3 ear \nsprays being currently applied.\n\nHowever, the rust threat remains high, as shown by the \u201cdevastatingly high levels of yellow rust\u201d in spray misses in \nthe West and the North.\n\nIn addition, our agronomists highlight that now is a good time for farmers to review their blackgrass strategy and \nconsider making changes for next season.\n\nNorth: David Martindale\n\nArable Alliance (Yorkshire)\n\nMay proved largely to be a dry month and crops have responded well to some warmer weather. More recently, \ncoastal areas have had either sea mists or heavy cloud, so despite the dry conditions a distinct lack of sunshine will \nnot be helping grain filling of either winter barley or oilseed rape crops. \n\nLate-sown spring cereal and pulse crops are racing through their growth stages and look well.\n\nWinter wheat crops are receiving their T3 fungicide mixes. Thankfully, the top three leaves are clean, which is \ncrucial, as these are the most important for building yield. The dry weather in the past few weeks and fungicide \ntimings back on schedule has recovered the disease control situation from the difficulties at the T0 and T1 timings. \n\nSee also: Why growing a Group 3 wheat may pay off next season\n\nYellow rust has made a late appearance in spray misses in field corners or around telegraph poles. While yellow \nrust in these areas is unsightly, it does reinforce just how well fungicides can control this disease.  \n\nOrange wheat blossom midge numbers have been higher than in recent years, but it is such a localised pest, with \nnumbers caught in traps varying significantly across the same farm. A continued shift to growing varieties resistant \nto this pest is sensible as a risk management tool, as well as reducing insecticide use.\n\nBlackgrass control\n\nOverall, blackgrass control has been good this season, but mapping any grassweed issues is worthwhile. Even \nmore worthwhile is making time to rogue any grassweeds, which in my opinion is one of the most important \ninvestments of the year.\n\nSpring barley crops have a huge range of drilling dates, with the earliest-sown crops now at the ear emergence \nstage. T2 fungicides have already been applied at the awns-emerged stage, with chlorothalonil added for ramularia \nprotection. \n\nGout fly continues its love affair with spring wheat with multiple eggs laid on the same plant, which in many cases \nhas required a prompt insecticide application.\n\nSpring beans mostly look well, with the earliest crops just beginning to start flowering. Weed control so far has been \ngood due to plenty of moisture for the pre-emergence herbicides to work well, leaving only deep-germinating \nvolunteer oilseed rape and charlock to be controlled post-emergence. \n\n\n\nBlack bean aphid populations are starting to build and, in some cases, there are large numbers on individual plants \nthat is particularly early where crops have yet to start flowering. \n\nWest: Neil Potts\n\nMatford Arable (Devon)\n\nSince my previous article, the weather has done a complete U-turn and we have now had weeks with little or no \nrain. This has meant everyone has been able to \u201cgo like hell\u201d and catch up with spring plantings.\n\nThe warmer and drier conditions have helped to reduce the wet weather disease pressure and crops have cleaned \nup reasonably well. Unsprayed corners of fields are, however, showing devastatingly high levels of yellow rust. This \nis quite refreshing to see as it demonstrates just how effective the fungicide programmes have been.\n\nWinter barley crops where nitrogen timings were on time are now looking fairly promising, whereas those where \napplications were delayed are a bit on the thin side to produce a good yield.\n\nCrops of Cassia where T2 applications have been delayed or not made at all are once again showing high levels of \nramularia. With the recent warm weather, it is looking like we might even have a relatively early barley harvest at \npresent.\n\nWinter wheat crops and winter oat crops have now responded to N inputs and are looking very well, if a bit on the \nshort side, as the weather was still wet and cold at early stem extension and little growth was made.\n\nShort crops\n\nDue to the late start to spring, many wheat crops have also dropped a leaf, which is contributing to the shortness of \ncrops. Hopefully lodging will not be problem this year.\n\nThe spring barley crop this year, although late, is looking good where seed-beds were correct and moisture has not \nbeen a limiting factor or looking dreadful where seed-beds were poor and it has been too dry. In many crops, \nparticularly the later-drilled ones, weed germination has been very slow and there have been repeat flushes.\n\nWith late planting and rapid growth, fitting in all the applications required has been a bit of a challenge, particularly \nwhere wild oats are an issue. With stressful growing conditions, complicated tank mixes have been a bit of a no-no \nin some situations as well.\n\nThe maize crop probably got off to its best start in years this season, with crops emerging quickly, staying green \nrather than turning yellow and red as in some seasons and growing quickly as a result of both warm days and \nnights. Many crops are approaching knee high in early June rather than by the beginning of July.\n\nEast: Ben Pledger\n\nFarmacy (Beds/Herts)\n\nEar emergence in forward winter wheat crops has coincided with the wet, thundery weather a fortnight ago. Even \nwith high disease pressure this spring, most crops are showing good potential after the robust fungicide \nprogrammes that have been used to date.\n\nWith that in mind, the option to go cheap and cheerful with the T3 fungicide has been ruled out. Prothioconazole \nhas been the go-to chemistry to control both fusarium species and Microdochium nivale. A strobilurin active \ningredient has been included for improved control of rusts, Septoria nodorum and sooty moulds and also to prolong \ngreen leaf area retention.\n\nCereals event\n\n\n\nFor those of you who travelled to Cereals this week, there were a lot of thought-provoking things to look at. \nHowever, I\u2019d put money on the fact that one of the first was the varying populations of blackgrass in crops on the \nway to the event.\n\nUnless you are planning on spraying areas of high populations off, whole cropping or hand rouging, there is little \nyou can do about problem areas this season.\n\nNow is the time to start your blackgrass control strategies for next year though. There are a number of relatively \ninexpensive cultural controls that can be employed before you even think about reaching for a can of chemical.\n\nThese include increasing seed rates, choosing a competitive variety, delaying drilling, extendibg rotations, using \nstale seed-beds, blowing down and cleanibg out combines between blocks, planning harvesting to reduce the \nspread of seed around the farm and making sure contractors enter the farm with clean machinery.\n\nDelayed drilling can lead the way to create stale seed-beds to kill off flushes of blackgrass before the crop is even \nsown. All fairly standard advice, which can be overlooked in the rush of harvest. Make a plan now and stick to it \nwhere possible.\n\nSouth: Tod Hunnisett\n\nAICC (Sussex)\n\nEarwash time after yet another challenging season, and once again Mother Nature has demonstrated her ability to \nthrow in a few wild cards.\n\nThese include wheat flowering when the ear is only half emerged at the end of May, winter barley having had tillers \nin ear for a month coming back into flower and spring barley demonstrating what looks like 150% germination, \nsplitting the boot five weeks after drilling.\n\nIn the south of England, we had a very hot, very wet, very windy last week of May. Unprotected flag leaves were in \ndesperate need of fungicide. Unfortunately, some timings were stretched and in some cases, rust has come back in \nwith a vengeance.\n\nThere is yellow rust in Claire (yes, it is still widely grown near export ports) and brown rust in Crusoe \u2013 I cannot see \nthis variety lasting much longer after this year. It annoys me that a variety of wheat has the ability to keep me awake \nat night.\n\nSpring crops\n\nThe hot, wet weather has certainly helped the spring crops though. Fantastic establishment of everything from \nspring barley through to maize, spring oilseed rape and linseed. Manufacturers of growth regulators are laughing all \nthe way to the bank where people increased their seed rates in spring barley.\n\nSpring beans seem to have grown 6in between the time the sprayer started and finished spraying the field. \nApparently, last week was the highest-ever measured pollen count in our area \u2013 a month before traditional \nhaymaking time.\n\nIt will not be long before oilseed rape desiccation tickets. Some will need ultra-high-clearance sprayers. I think rape \nwill be cut before winter barley this year, as this weird secondary flowering looks like it will be hanging on for some \ntime before it becomes fit.\n\nWe\u2019re getting to the stage now when all we can do is hope we haven\u2019t upset Mummy Nature too much\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\n\n\nRecent warm weather allowed most growers to catch up but our agronomists urge proactivity with T2 fungicide \napplications in winter wheat, which are suffering heavy burdens of septoria.\n\nThese should be applied at the right time rather than observe the usual 21-day gap between T1 and T2 if disease is \ngoing to be successfully managed.\n\nThe lack of weeds seen so far in some spring cereals could point to a late flush after many herbicides have already \npassed their cut-off point, making control difficult.\n\nSee also: How Velcourt manages its wheat fungicide spend\n\nWest: Neil Potts\n\nMatford Arable (Devon)\n\nSo far, 2018 has turned into the craziest season I can remember.\n\nCrops are all over the place and all the spring cereals have been drilled in the second half of April and into early \nMay.\n\nWinter barley crops that had delayed nitrogen applications are not looking great, compared with those that received \nsome on time.\n\nMany barley crops missed their T0 altogether and ended up having a robust and late T1.\n\nThese crops are now at awn emergence and the disease control is looking fairly satisfactory. T2 applications have \nnow started.\n\nWinter wheat crops have suffered the same fate, with some missing their T0\u2019s and those on the heavier ground \nreceiving late T1 applications.\n\nThe disease situation in these crops is not so great.\n\nThere are heavy burdens of septoria in crops that have missed applications or suffered delays. T2 applications are \ngoing to need to be made on time even if the period between T1 and T2 is a shorter than normal.\n\nSome big guns are going to be needed at T2 to bring septoria back under control, particularly if the showery \nweather continues.\n\nDelays could prove costly\n\nOnly LG Sundance is looking clean at the moment, with later-drilled Graham not far behind.\n\nEarly drilled Graham is showing worryingly high levels of septoria and Skyfall, which is usually quite a clean variety, \nis brown with septoria on the lower leaves.\n\nOn the plus side, many wheat crops that were looking shocking six weeks ago have responded well to nitrogen \napplications and are now looking like they have some potential so long as the disease can be checked.\n\nSpring barley crops are going to be difficult to manage this year due to the lateness of drilling.\n\nThey will undoubtedly come into ear at much the same time as usual, which means they are going to grow very \nquickly, giving us much smaller windows for top-dressing and spray inputs.\n\nI would urge growers to not waste a single opportunity to get applications on to the spring barley crop as a small \nweather delay could prove very costly.\n\n\n\nWith spring cereals, maize and beet crops all going in the ground at the same time the agronomic workload is \nlooking a bit daunting at present.\n\nNorth: David Martindale\n\nArable Alliance (Yorkshire)\n\nI cannot describe how good it has been to arrive on a farm and hear the phrase \u201cI am all up to date\u201d.\n\nMost crops have dramatically improved in the past two weeks as they have responded to fertiliser applications and \nthe warmer weather.\n\nFlag leaves are beginning to emerge on winter wheat crops. Many have received a more robust T1 fungicide mix \nafter missing T0.\n\nSeptoria tritici is the disease of concern and is easy to find on leaf four where no T0 fungicide was applied.\n\nWith the all-important T2 fungicide timing approaching there will be different fungicide choices and doses depending \non the variety, drilling date and what did or did not happen at T0 or T1 in relation to Septoria tritici control. \n\nThe most robust T2 mixes will be for early sown crops which did not receive a T0 fungicide and their T1 application \nwas delayed. \n\nOilseed rape crops are in full flower and appear to be quickly setting pods. Pod set in most cases looks good so \nfar. \n\nSclerotinia fungicides have been applied and pest pressure has been confined to a small number of seed weevil \nhotspots.\n\nHuge variation\n\nWinter barley crops are mostly at the awns emerging stage.  T2 fungicides are being applied which will include \nchlorothalonil for ramularia control. \n\nWhere T1 fungicides were delayed in barley the rhynchosporium and net blotch levels are higher up the canopy \nthan ideal. The T2 fungicide will prevent further spread of these diseases up the canopy while also providing brown \nrust control.\n\nSpring barley crops have a huge variation in growth. Those sown before Easter have suffered the most from poor \nestablishment due the heavy rains that followed drilling, but they have begun to improve in the past two weeks. \n\nT1 fungicides will soon be ready to be applied to these crops with herbicides often added at the same time.\n\nWinter beans are beginning to flower a fungicide mix to protect against chocolate spot should soon be applied. \n\nEarly sown spring beans look excellent at the 4-5 leaf pair stage while later-sown crops are emerging quickly but \nhave required an insecticide after heavy attacks by the pea and bean weevil.\n\nEast: Ben Pledger\n\nFarmacy (Beds/Herts)\n\nWith winter wheats moving quickly through growth stages, the flag leaf is now emerging on forward crops.\n\nT1 fungicides may have only been applied to these crops seven to 10 days ago, and the temptation will be to keep \nto the standard 21-day interval between T1 and T2.\n\n\n\nAs I write this, I can hear heavy rain at the window, and with active Septoria tritici sitting in the base of some crops \nmy mind turns to rain splash moving spores in the base of the crop up the plant.\n\nWith the flag leaf contributing to more than 40% of yield, it is even more important than usual to protect it at the \ncorrect timing.\n\nSDHI chemistry in the forms of bixafen or fluxapyroxad will be employed at T2, mixed with either epoxiconazole or \nprothioconazole, with the latter forming a good base to control fusarium later on.\n\nA multisite active ingredient such as chlorothalonil or folpet may also be added on susceptible varieties, or if wetter \nweather is forecast.\n\nLate weed flush\n\nBlackgrass control in winter wheat in the form of mesosulfuron-methyl + iodosulfuron-methyl went on later than the \nideal timing in places, controlling smaller plants, but allowing larger, well-tillered blackgrass to grow away to \nproduce seed heads.\n\nTo top this off, I\u2019m now finding new blackgrass emerging out of cracks in the ground. Later emerging broad-leaved \nweeds are also possibly going to cause problems as crops are now nearing the cut-off points for most herbicide \nproducts, with some products such as mecoprop-P having already passed its cut off point.\n\nIn spring crops, the lack of weeds in some places is concerning, pointing to a later flush, especially as it is raining. \nThese may prove tricky to control, particularly in spring barley, sugar beet and peas where intervals between \nbroad-leaved weed control and graminicides need to be observed.\n\nSouth: Tod Hunnisett\n\nAICC (Sussex)\n\nIt\u2019s been a funny old season. Non-stop rain followed by extremes of temperatures accompanied by howling gales.\n\nUnreserved credit must go to the long-suffering operators: \u201cI\u2019m sorry sweetheart \u2013 I\u2019d love to come to our \nwedding/grandad\u2019s 80th birthday celebrations/auntie\u2019s funeral but it looks like the weather\u2019s going to be nice and I \nhave about a million acres to drill/spray/fertilise .\u201d\n\nFinally, people are beginning to feel they are catching up.\n\nLate-drilled spring crops have gone into warm, moist soils and have shot through the ground \u2013 some coming \nthrough so quickly they\u2019ve missed their pre-em slot.\n\nLast nitrogen doses have gone on to wheat and at last they have a decent bit of colour.\n\nBecause of the wet early conditions I went in pretty heavy with early fungicide doses; if it stays dry from now on it \nwill give me the opportunity to cut back a bit.\n\nPlough still has use\n\nSpring grassweed sprays that went on in the early hot weather seem to have worked superbly \u2013 which is \nencouraging because it suggests previous year\u2019s attempts that have been unsuccessful have only not worked \nbecause of the weather and not because of a resistant population.\n\nEar wash tickets have started to be recommended for winter barley.

While planning \u2013 if you haven\u2019t sprayed off or rogued bad \ngrassweed patches then score your fields from 0 (\u201cclean\u201d) to 10 (\u201clawn\u201d) and plan harvest to follow that order.\n\nMini-flowering\n\nWinter barley and oats are beginning grainfill. Spring barley and oats romped away and it\u2019s been a struggle to keep \nup with them on strong ground due to wind. Final fungicides are either on or imminent.\n\nRapeseed is looking generally good. Some rapeseed raced through flowering to podset very rapidly, and over the \npast fortnight has thrown some axillary shoots to a \u201cmini-flowering\u201d which looked disconcertingly like charlock. As \nmuch use too \u2013 avoiding red seed could be tricky. Splitting pod sealant applications may help.\n\nSpring beans will be getting their second fungicide application shortly. There was Black Bean aphid in winter beans, \nbut I try to hold my nerve until this week in June \u2013 and it\u2019s paid off again.\n\nFortunately, no Bruchid spray was required until this week as that tends to knock the beneficials and Pirimicarb \n(aphox) is then needed to curb the aphids. Talking of which, I am seeing numbers of rose-grain aphid building on \nthe ear in some areas. Individual plants with barley yellow dwarf virus in field are common even where Deter-\ntreated seed was used.\n\nWithout Deter it is very clear the pressure was high, as even with an autumn aphicide the wheats show a high level \nof infection.\n\nEast \u2013 Marcus Mann\n\nFrontier\n\nWith conditions remaining dry crops are accelerating their growth towards harvest.\n\nOilseed rape has fully podded, with lighter land seed already beginning to turn. Pod sealants are being applied to \nthe crop to ensure maximum elasticity and also to protect the tramlines.\n\nEncouraging them to lean over while the stems are still green allows the desiccant to go on later without snapping \nthe stems and potentially losing them.\n\nAlthough desiccation is a few weeks away, when applying glyphosate add an adjuvant containing ammonium \nsulphate to speed up the kill of problematic weeds such as thistles, as well the desiccation of the crop. \n\nIf nothing else, a water conditioner should always be added to the tank before glyphosate to buffer against hard \nwater and retain the efficacy of the herbicide. \n\n\n\nWinter wheat crops have all received there T3s, and attention is now on nitrogen levels to ensure crops meet or \nexceed quality specifications at harvest.\n\nExtra nitrogen\n\nThe best way of assessing whether applied nitrogen to date has been adequate is to take test flag leaves, either by \ncollecting samples and sending them for analysis or using hand-held monitoring units.\n\nApplications of foliar N such as Multi N on the ear can increase protein levels up to 0.5%, which can make the \ndifference between full and lower specification milling wheat, but make sure you have sufficient availability within \nNmax.\n\nManganese and magnesium are being applied as a matter course to sugar beet, and where the crops are \nbackward, foliar biostimulants are being applied to mitigate against abiotic and biotic stress, safeguarding the crop \nduring early establishment and the key yield-building phase.\n\nAphid populations within cereals remain low, however pulse aphids continue to increase with pea aphid and black \nbean aphids reaching thresholds and pirimicarb is being applied with fungicides.\n\nPea moths have been caught in pheromone traps, so continue to monitor traps and the PGRO website for \npopulation levels.\n\nBruchid beetle activity remains higher with the increased temperatures. Spray timing is critical and should be based \nupon the simple criteria of pods being present, and the temperature having reached at least 20C on two \nconsecutive days.\n\nNorth \u2013 Patrick Stephenson\n\nAICC (Yorkshire)\n\nCereals is always a watershed for agronomists as it\u2019s the first time we all get together to discuss the past season.\n\nThe journey to Chrishall Grange was a sobering event as all our weed problems were clearly visible from the Vale \nof Pickering to Duxford. Blackgrass, oats, brome, poppy, mayweed and ryegrass to name a few, meant the \ndiscussion had a pessimistic air.\n\nThe plots at Cereals were a stark reminder of what brown rust infections can do in wheat. However, even this is \nunlikely to force another spray application.\n\nSoon it will be desiccation time for rapeseed and, at this point, I will seek some miraculous intervention. The \nvariability in many crops means the timing could be like buying a lottery ticket. At some point we will have to pull the \ntrigger and decide if we add sealant.\n\nThis spring has been the ultimate challenge for spring drilling, with March and April yielding more than 175 mm of \nrain. However, the majority of crops look well and now have ears emerging.\n\nThe only disease of any significance has been mildew in stressed crops, but the risk of ramularia means that a final \near spray based on chlorothalonil is being planned.\n\nPoppies\n\nIn an attempt to tackle the poppies that has been providing tourists traveling to Scarborough with a Monet-like \nscenery, I have used the new Arylex Active and, at the moment, the A64 to Scarborough is not a crimson vista.\n\nOats and beans have grown rapidly and remain clean. Spring beans are flowering and black bean aphid can now \nbe found, which could mean an aphicide if conditions remain settled or predator numbers do not build.\n\n\n\nInevitably, Cereals is when all seed houses try to convince to invest in their latest offering. From my point of view \nthe biggest debate still revolves around the makeup of the rotation.\n\nI must reluctantly accept oilseed rape is still an important part. Rapid establishment and light leaf spot resistance \nare priorities, but the concern of erucic acid levels is starting to impact on variety choice.\n\nWhile Clearfield does give an opportunity to minimise risk, it comes at a cost. At the moment, I have only the odd \ncrop on charlock infested fields, but I am starting to look where it could be applicable on a wider platform.\n\nWe will still see Costello taking a large slice of the winter wheat area but the concerns of Orange Blossom Midge \nwill mean varieties carrying the resistance will be sort after.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nAlternating warm and cold spells are proving to be a challenge for our agronomists this spring, as they look to get \nfungicide and growth regulator application timings back on track with widely varying crop growth.\n\nThe hot bank holiday weekend will once again accelerate cereal growth and awns are already emerging in winter \nbarley which are receiving their T2 sprays.\n\nLikewise, the flag leaf in some early wheat crops is starting to emerge meaning the key T2 spray is fast \napproaching with no let up in the disease threat.\n\nSee also: How to find the best varieties on the revamped oilseed rape list\n\nSouth: Richard Harding\n\nProCam (Sussex)\n\nA glorious weekend on the Downs has allowed many to catch up and good progress should be possible on more \nforward winter wheat T2 fungicides next week.\n\nThose crops with good potential, will receive a mix of epoxiconazole, fluxapyroxad, pyraclostrobin and chlorothalonil \n(for anti-resistance protection), plus a late plant growth regulator (PGR) where required.\n\nThe result of recent fine weather will mean crop growth will be picking up again in cereals. For wheat, even those \nwhere T1s have only just been/are still being applied, crops will be moving rapidly towards flag leaf emergence \u2013 \nsome likely to show this coming week.\n\nPrevious wet weather, and more unsettled conditions to come, means the disease risk, particularly from septoria, \nremains high.\n\nBarley T2\n\nAt the same time, winter barley awns and ears are emerging, and T2 fungicides including chlorothalonil for \nramularia, will need to be applied, if not already done.\n\nBrown rust is still ticking on in the bottom of many crops, and net blotch is easily found. Planned late PGRs based \non ethephon, which were delayed by recent wet and windy weather, may now be too late, as we are past the awns \nemerging stage in many situations.\n\nOilseed rape crops are past peak flowering, and moving back to a more green appearance, and the pod-fill stage. \nWhere flowers are still present, the sclerotinia risk remains high, and a top-up fungicide based around \nprothioconazole and fluopyram will be applied.\n\n\n\nSeed weevils will also be more active under current conditions. Although not likely to cause severe damage by \nthemselves, their feeding holes allow the pod midge to lay their eggs in pods, ultimately causing the familiar pod \nsplitting, most typically within the headland areas of the crop.\n\nWinter beans are now growing rapidly, and have received a fungicide to control chocolate spot and downy mildew.\n\nPea and bean weevil grazing is relatively high at the moment, but crops are growing away from any damage, and \nare unlikely to require an insecticide.\n\nEast: Marion Self\n\nPrime Agriculture (Suffolk)\n\nA tricky start to the season saw our planned technical strategies being reshaped into a series of compromises \ndriven by logistics and what is actually achievable. How well we have managed this difficult period of wet conditions \nand fast development will be revealed later in the season.\n\nIn wheat wet conditions and increasing temperatures have increased septoria pressure on lower leaves and in \nuntreated crops more susceptible varieties have significant rust infections.\n\nIn early wheats, the tips of flag leaves are likely to be appearing. On these crops many T1 fungicide sprays were \napplied late to emerging leaf two rather than leaf three. It\u2019s important that we get back on schedule with T2 \nfungicides aimed at protecting the flag leaf.\n\nIn contrast on many October and later drilled wheats, T1 treatments have been well-timed at leaf three emergence.\n\nMy advice would be to keep fungicide timings tight and sprays robust. Many crops have good yield potential and will \nbe receiving an SDHI plus azole + chlorothalonil mix at this timing.\n\nGrowth regulation\n\nWheats with good biomass or where the timing of earlier PGRs was compromised will need a robust dose of late-\nseason PGR. The T2 fungicide timing is an opportunity to apply another PGR and finalise cleaver control (so long \nas it is applied before ear emergence).\n\nIn oilseed rape, where a two-spray fungicide strategy is in place it will soon be time for the second fungicide as \nflowering declines.\n\nWinter beans have received the first fungicide at early to mid-flowing as chocolate spot begins to develop low in the \ncanopy.\n\nSpring crops are at very different stages depending on drilling date. Some spring barleys will be at late tillering and \nready for their first fungicide with broad-leaved weed control.\n\nLater-drilled sugar beet crops have established and herbicide treatments are under way. Earlier drilled crops with \ndelayed treatments are now weedy, but large enough for more robust treatments.\n\nNorth: Mary Munro\n\nAICC/Strutt & Parker (Perthshire)\n\nThis is one of the most interesting weeks of the year as it is a great yardstick for crop development. At last we have \nsome warmth in the soil and crops are growing on.\n\nWinter barleys are still a bit behind last year, but perhaps now less than a week later.\n\n\n\nWinter wheat has also caught up to pretty much its usual stage on average, with most at growth stage 32 and leaf \ntwo coming out. As ever, there is a wide range of wheat growth stages at this time. Many have had the T1 \n(especially if T0 was omitted) and are on track with the fungicide programme. \n\nThere are the usual varietal differences in septoria levels, and yellow rust made an appearance pre-T1, although at \na low level.\n\nSlow oilseed rape\n\nWinter oilseed rape has been notably slower in development following the late spring, and is taking a long time to \ncome into flower. There may be one or two that are backward enough to merit a pollen beetle spray now \ntemperatures are warmer, but growers should go firmly by the thresholds.\n\nEven then, the threshold may not be met further into the crop despite large numbers of beetles at the edges. The \nmid-flowering fungicide may be a bit later in the month than usual.\n\nAfter all the delays, spring cereals were drilled in double-quick time into good seed-beds which had benefitted from \nfrost and broke down beautifully.\n\nCrops emerged very quickly and are heading towards a weed spray and manganese at leaf two, with the first \nfungicide aimed at growth stage 31.\n\nPotato planting was held up significantly and a large proportion of the crop was not in the ground before May. \nThese spring crops seem destined for a late harvest.\n\nWest: Antony Wade\n\nHillhampton Technical Services (Herefordshire/Shropshire)\n\nThe short spell of warm weather in the third week of April allowed us to get some much-needed grassweed \nherbicide applications to wheat crops.\n\nHowever, I do fear the delay to these applications is going to result in poorer than hoped efficacy as blackgrass, \nryegrass and brome were all larger than ideal.\n\nIn some cases, chlorothalonil was added as a severely delayed T0, but worthy of inclusion as leaf four was still the \nemerging leaf at that time.\n\nT1 recommendations followed rapidly behind as the short warm spell meant rapid leaf three emergence.\n\nThen the roller coaster spring weather plunged again to cooler and unsettled meaning that these T1s have only \nbeen applied recently when temperatures climbed back in an unprecedentedly warm bank holiday weekend.\n\nSo this has meant leaf two is going to get some fungicide coverage which is no bad thing in my opinion although \nleaf three may well have already been exposed to infection.\n\nWinter barley T1s were also applied in this April peak of warmth, despite crops still looking fairly short at this time I \npersevered with a robust plant growth strategy.\n\nIn hindsight this was the right decision as barley crops have romped though the growth stages and awns will be \nemerging on forward crops by the time you read this, too late for a late PGR product.\n\nSo T2s will be going out in the coming week with a more traditional awns emerging \u201cpaintbrush\u201d timing plus some \nchorothalonil added for ramularia protection.\n\n\n\nOilseed rape crops went from green bud to early flower with this shot of warm weather so yellow bud planned \nfungicides went on, but have certainly covered early flowering protection from sclerotinia.\n\nThese will followed up after three to four weeks with a mid-flower sclerotinia fungicide which in most cases will go \non this week.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nAn extra \u00a3400,000 will be added to the allocation budget of a multimillion-pound farm business grant scheme in \nNorthern Ireland.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) announced on Wednesday (2 May) that the \nsecond tranche of tier 1 of the Farm Business Improvement Scheme \u2013 Capital (FBIS-C) would receive extra \nfunding.\n\nAlmost 3,000 applications have been received under the second tranche of the scheme, which is designed to \nsupport small-scale investments such as the purchase of equipment and machinery, to improve the sustainability of \nfarm businesses.\n\nSee also: Essential tips for BPS 2018 claims\n\nGrants are available for 40% of eligible costs on projects ranging from \u00a35,000-\u00a330,000.\n\nThe second tranche originally had a budget of \u00a37.5m, but this has been increased to \u00a37.9m.\n\nA Daera spokesperson said: \u201cThis will help to ensure that the future sustainability of even more farms in Northern \nIreland is achieved through capital investment in equipment that will also bring about improvements to the \nenvironment, animal and plant health, occupational health and safety and production efficiency.\u201d\n\nOversubscribed?\n\nThe Ulster Farmers\u2019 Union (UFU) has welcomed the announcement, saying the extra funding will help many \nfarmers improve the efficiency of their farms.\n\nBut UFU president Ivor Ferguson added: \u201cDespite the additional funding, the scheme remains oversubscribed and \nwe would call on Daera to do what it can to find further additional funds for this popular scheme.\u201d\n\nTo date, 1,480 letters of offer for grants totalling \u00a37.5m have been issued.

We agreed together at the outset that the key to reducing the vet spend was to tackle the incidence \nand underlying causes of disease on farm.\u201d\n\nHe outlined three ways they have reduced overall spend by improving cow health and management:\n\n1. Reducing mastitis\n\nThere has been an eightfold reduction in mastitis since erecting a new cubicle shed for higher yielding cows and \nincreasing loafing area in older buildings.\n\nIn 2013-14, mastitis was running at 80 cases per 100 cows, but now incidence is sub-10 cases per 100 cows.\n\n \n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var \ni=\"InfogramEmbeds\",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?\"http:\":\"https:\";if(/^\\/{2}/.test(s)&&(\ns=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var \na=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,\"script\",\"infogram-\nasync\",\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\");\n\n\u201cBefore, we were probably trying to do too much with our hands tied behind our backs,\u201d explains Mr O\u2019Sullivan. \n\u201cWe wanted to make as much use of the old facilities, but we had a bottleneck \u2013 stocking rate was always over \n100% and it was very difficult for cows to loaf.\u201d\n\nThis has been overcome by:\n\nIncreasing loafing areas outside of older cubicles\n\nMoving water troughs outside to encourage cows to go outdoors\n\nPut up a new shed comprising 91 cubicles for the highest yielders (+35 litres)\n\nServicing the parlour annually\n\n2. Improving transition cow management\n\nHerd expansion from 110 to 220 milking cows has aided better transition cow management. \u201cPreviously, having 3-4 \ncows in a dry cow group made it difficult to mix feed. But being at 220 cows we never have less than 15 cows in the \ndry cow group so it makes it easier to feed,\u201d concedes Mr Wilson. Being militant about the way freshly calved cows \nare managed and implementing strict protocols have been key to reducing the number of dirty cows 60 days post \ncalving:\n\n\nEach freshly calved cow and heifer gets \u201crevive drink\u201d within minutes of calving, containing calcium and glycol \nyeasts to rehydrate the cow, provide energy and prevent milk fever.\n\nIf a cow hasn\u2019t cleansed within three hours they will be given oxytocin which causes the uterus to contract and \nexpel the cleansing.\n\nThey also receive 150ml of propylene glycol twice a day for five days to prevent ketosis and left displaced \nabomasum.\n\nCows carrying twins or fat are given Kexxtone boluses three weeks prior to calving to prevent ketosis.\n\nMr Wilson carries out post-calving checks to ensure each cow is clean, although incidences of these have reduced \ndue to the above.\n\n \n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var \ni=\"InfogramEmbeds\",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?\"http:\":\"https:\";if(/^\\/{2}/.test(s)&&(\ns=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var \na=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,\"script\",\"infogram-\nasync\",\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\");\n\n3. Improving youngstock management\n\nThe farm switched from feeding calves whole milk to milk powder two years ago and since then has really \nsharpened attention to detail on youngstock management.\n\nCalves are fed three litres of colostrum within three hours. Colostrum is tested with a Brix refractometer and if it\u2019s \nabove 22% in quality it is frozen.\n\nBloods are then taken from calves within one week to check their immunoglobulin status which indicates how well \ncolostrum has been fed.\n\nCalves start on two litres of milk twice a day, building up to three litres by one week of age twice daily. Powder is \nmixed at a concentration of 150g per 0.85 litres of water to make up one litre.\n\nThey are fed ad-lib starter nut, straw and fresh water, and bedded on straw.\n\nFeeding is stepped down to once daily at week 10 with calves weaned at week 12.\n\nCalves are kept in individual hutches until one month when they move into groups of four.\n\nCalves are BVD tag and tested, and vaccinated for pneumonia.\n\nBenefits of reducing vet spend\n\nAlthough vet spend is reducing, Mr O\u2019Sullivan says it is good for both businesses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not all bad news for the vet practice that vet spend has gone down. It\u2019s more sustainable in the long term,\u201d he \nsays.\n\n\u201cIf vet spend is at 2p/litre is it probably unsustainable and that person might only be milking cows until the next price \nfall. Whereas someone whose vet spend is 0.8p/litre is more likely to be in business in years to come.\u201d\n\n \n\n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var \ni=\"InfogramEmbeds\",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?\"http:\":\"https:\";if(/^\\/{2}/.test(s)&&(\ns=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var \na=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,\"script\",\"infogram-\nasync\",\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\");\n\nMr O\u2019Sullivan points out that it also gives farmers the opportunity to spend more on vaccination and preventing \ndisease rather than \u201cfirefighting\u201d with drugs.\n\nMr Wilson says this is being realised on farm, where now they are implementing more vaccines to prevent disease.\n\n\u201cWe now tag and test calves for BVD and vaccinate for pneumonia. When our vet spend was over 2p/litre this \nwould have been unaffordable, but having lower costs gives us the option to be more proactive and it\u2019s a good \nposition to be in.\n\n\u201cLong term, hopefully we are improving herd health and reducing antibiotics use, which is really important for us, as \nthe pressure to do so is growing.\u201d\n\nSponsors\u2019 message\n\nThanks to Zoetis, Volac and XL Vets, whose sponsorship made it possible for us to run the Rethinking Cattle \nPerformance workshop.

prospect of the milk price to concentrate ratio dropping over the course of the year, increases in \nherd reproductive performance would be crucial in sustaining the current level of farm business improvement, \naccording to Mr Davies.\n\n\u201cThe February report for the average sample suggests there might be a hint of deterioration in this area \n[reproduction], as the calving percentage metric has fallen from 98.6 to 97.6 per 100 cows in the past 12 months,\u201d \nhe added.  \n\n\u201cFor this reason, I\u2019d recommend that producers and their consultants pay particular attention to herd reproductive \nperformance as they use Milkminder to help them plan ahead for continued success next year.\n\n\u201cIf they can master that, they\u2019ll be one step closer to repeating the

production also peaking in what has been a much-\nrestrained spring flush.\n\nHealthy demand and most processors operating close to maximum capacity drove strong prices, according to \nAHDB dairy, which reported increases for all four of the main traded commodities.\n\nSee also: Consecutive milk price rises for Muller producers\n\nTrade and prices of bulk cream grew consistently through May, finishing the month 13% higher at \u00a32,350/t \u2013 an \nincrease of \u00a3400/t on the same period last year.\n\nButter saw a similar rise of 11%, averaging \u00a35,180/t helped by a strong demand for cream and subsequent cream \nprice increases.\n\nThe levy board said sellers were in a strong position as there were little-to-no stocks available for spot trade and \nproduction wound down in the latter stages of the month.\n\nA welcome change was seen in the skim milk powder (SMP) price, which shot up 14% on the month to an average \nof \u00a31,320/t, but still remained 15% down on its level in May 2017.\n\nA bumper sale of 42,000t of SMP from EU intervention stocks appeared to reinvigorate the market for fresh powder, \naccording to AHDB Dairy, helping to increase demand and tighten the available stocks.\n\nMild cheddar largely emulated butter, with tight stocks leaving sellers in a strong position of only having to sell if the \nprice was right.\n\n\nConsequently, trade was relatively thin and the average wholesale price only nudged up 2% on the month to \n\u00a32,970/t, perfectly in line with its position 12 months earlier.\n\nExpert Analysis: Peter Meehan at INTL FCStone\n\nEuropean Dairy commodity futures prices continued their march higher over the past couple of weeks.\n\nStrong demand and lower than anticipated milk collections across the EU throughout the spring period are two of \nthe drivers behind the price increases, despite improved milk fat and protein content for most of Europe\u2019s big milk \nproducers offsetting the reduced liquid milk collections.\n\nThe latest milk collection numbers for April are showing New Zealand, the US and Australia all saw increases \ncompared with last year.\n\nSpot European butter prices have now seen eight consecutive weeks of increases, moving up by 24% in that \nperiod.\n\nSpot skim milk powder (SMP) prices are also heading higher, posting seven weeks of gains on the bounce, up 19% \nin that period. SMP prices have remained firm on the back of very strong demand, with EU SMP exports for \nJanuary-March up 8% on last year while SMP prices were unfazed by the EU Commission\u2019s sale of 42,000t of \nIntervention stocks last week.\n\nWith average UK farmgate milk prices posting four consecutive months of declines between December and March, \nthe commodity price strength over recent weeks suggests farmgate milk prices may have bottomed out, with milk \nprice increases announced over the past seven days.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nUK dairy producers and processors have made significant strides towards reducing the industry\u2019s environmental \nfootprint over the past decade, including meeting a 2020 target for renewable energy production two years early.\n\nThe UK Dairy Roadmap Report 2018, an initiative chaired by Dairy UK, working alongside the NFU and AHDB, \nhighlighted the improvements in sustainability and efficiency made by UK dairy in the 10 years since the inception \nof the cross-industry initiative.\n\nSince 2008, the UK dairy sector has reduced greenhouse gas emissions associated with milk production by 24%, \nwhile water efficiency has been increased by the same amount.\n\nSee also: Dairy Crest makes \u00a385m investment in production capacity\n\nWater efficiency has risen by 18% in the past decade and the proportion of total waste sent to landfill by the dairy \nindustry has reduced from 35% to just 4% over the same period.\n\nDairy farmers hit five of the seven targets outlined in the previous 2015 report, including having 65% of dairy-\nmanaged farmland in environmental stewardship schemes, 10-15% of dairy farms using renewables and 50% of \nfarms implementing new technologies to reduce emissions.\n\n

dairy farmers to be actively \ninvolved in nutrient management planning and achieving a declining trend in serious pollution incidences on farm.\n\nWhat is the Dairy Roadmap?\n\nCross-industry initiative introduced in 2008\n\nChaired by Dairy UK working alongside AHDB and the NFU\n\nSets a series of targets to improve dairy\u2019s environmental footprint\n\nWorks with dairy farmers, producers and industry partners\n\n \u201cThe dairy industry has made great strides in reducing its environmental footprint and it is great to see their \nongoing progress to further increase the sustainability of this vital industry, said George Eustice Conservative MP, \nand minister of state for agriculture, fisheries and food.\n\n\u201cAs the UK\u2019s largest agricultural sector, the industry has a major role to play in delivering our ambitious 25-year \nenvironment plan and I look forward to working with Dairy UK to deliver a bright future for our farmers, processors \nand the environment.\u201d\n\nNFU dairy board chairman Michael Oakes said the report highlighted the significant environmental progress dairy \nfarmers had made over the past decade, driven in part by the ambitious and wide-reaching targets set by the \nRoadmap.\n\n\u201cThese targets include commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency, water \nusage and waste management on farm,\u201d Mr Oakes said.\n\n\u201cThe achievements of the past 10 years stand as testament to the hard work and commitment of our dairy farmer \nmembers to meet these environmental ambitions.\n\n\u201cWe will continuously review future targets to ensure that the contribution of dairy farmers to the Dairy Roadmap \nremains ambitious and relevant to the range of sustainability challenges ahead.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe government has announced \u00a310m worth of grants to restore England\u2019s peat bogs as part of its 25-year \nEnvironment Plan.\n\nFunding

sites covering 98ha \n\nWill focus on the Meres & Mosses Natural Area\n\nMoor Carbon\n\nLed by the Peak District National Park Authority\n\nWill be working in the Peak District National Park, West Pennine Moors SSSI, and Rossendale Gap to restore more \nthan 2,000ha of blanket bog\n\n\u201cPeatlands are an iconic aspect of the English landscape which are not only a haven for wildlife, but also provide us \nwith clean water and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said environment minister Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey.\n\n\u201cThe 25-year environment plan sets out the government\u2019s commitment to improve peatlands, and grant schemes \nsuch as this one will enable us to leave our environment better than we inherited it,\u201d she added.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nDefra has relaxed rules for applicants of the Countryside Productivity Small Grants (CPSG) scheme, following \nconcerns equipment bought under the scheme would not arrive in the permitted time frame.\n\nApplicants initially had 150 days to submit a claim and receive new equipment, but were liable to lose grants if \ndelivery fell outside of this period.\n\nSee also: New \u00a360m small grants scheme \u2013 all you need to know\n\nThis led to concerns that items such as fixed and mobile livestock-handling systems and cattle crushes could not be \nmanufactured in time.\n\nHowever, in response to the issues raised by producers and the NFU, successful applicants will now be able to take \nreceipt of equipment outside of the 150-day window, receiving payments when the kit arrives.\n\nFarmers who withdrew applications during the 14-day cooling off period can reinstate claims now or during a \nsecond round of funding due to open in the autumn.\n\nNext steps for applicants\n\nThe RPA will contact producers who withdrew grants for livestock-handling equipment to inform them of these new \noptions.\n\n\n\nApplicants with further concerns should contact the RPA directly.\n\nDefra added that 3,500 grants had been awarded worth \u00a323.5m, a 57% increase on the \u00a315m originally budgeted \nfor the scheme\u2019s first round, thanks to its popularity.\n\nReaction\n\n\u201cThis is a positive move to improve a successful scheme,\u201d said NFU chief economics adviser Andrew Francis.\n\n\u201cThe CPSG scheme has been a really positive initiative from Defra that has been easy for producers to apply for.\u201d\n\nDr Francis added he hoped these latest amendments would mean the scheme did not become a victim of its own \nsuccess.\n\nCountryside Productivity scheme grant facts\n\nScheme worth \u00a360m for improving farm or forestry productivity, adding value to agri-food and water resource \nmanagement and reservoirs.\n\nGrants from \u00a33,000 to \u00a312,000 provided for equipment such as livestock handling systems, crushes, weighing \nequipment, arable GPS units, yield-mapping devices and direct or strip-till drills.\n\nIt pays out 40% of the total equipment value. So for a grant of \u00a33,000 the minimum equipment cost will need to be \n\u00a37,500, which must be paid upfront by the applicant before being claimed back.\n\nDeadline for the scheme was 14 March 2018\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nDefra has rejected suggestions it is unprepared for Brexit \u2013 saying it has taken on more than 1,250 extra staff to \nhelp make a success of leaving the EU.\n\nThe department spoke out following a report by think tank the Institute for Government, which questioned \nWhitehall\u2019s preparedness for life after the EU.\n\nA lack of experience at Defra meant the department faces a major challenge when it came to getting Brexit-related \nlegislation through parliament, said the think tank.\n\nSee also: How to review your farm business to prepare for Brexit\n\nThe challenge was further complicated because agriculture is an area where powers have been devolved to \nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nThis meant parts of the government\u2019s forthcoming Agriculture Bill would need consent beyond Westminster if it was \nto establish a new UK-wide framework for farming.\n\nProlonged stand-off\n\nDevolution has already led to a prolonged stand-off between Scotland and Westminster over the government\u2019s EU \nwithdrawal bill, said the Institute for Government.\n\nThe think tank said Defra\u2019s core department had already grown by 65% \u2013 but it suggested it would take time for \nstaff to get up to speed.\n\nIt warned: \u201c\u2018Bums on seats do not necessarily result in the capacity required.\n\n\n\n\u201cNew hires, who tend to be junior and mid-ranking civil servants, don\u2019t bring the experience and authority of the \nsenior civil service.\u201d\n\nMost affected\n\nAt the same time, the report said Defra was still expected to make savings of \u00a3130m to its resource budget this year \n\u2013 despite being one of the departments most affected by Brexit.\n\nBut a Defra spokesman said: \u201cWe have an extensive programme of work focused on delivering a green Brexit that \nwill enhance environmental, animal welfare, and biosecurity standards.\n\n\u201cWe have recruited around an additional 1,250 staff with the right skills, experience and leadership to make the \nmost of the opportunities ahead.\u201d\n\nThe department has previously prepared a YouTube video to encourage people to work at the department. \n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe government has announced it will allow badger culling to take place in the low-risk area of England where TB \nherd breakdowns are linked to badgers.\n\nDefra published the results of its consultation on Thursday (24 May) on proposals to cull badgers in low-risk areas \n(LRA) in the north and east of England, including Yorkshire, Cumbria and Northumberland, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex \nand Kent.\n\nAn expansion of the cull into low-risk and \u201cedge\" areas of England could take place as early as this autumn, if \napplications for badger control licences are approved by Natural England. \n\nSee also: Farm minister explains purpose of bovine TB review\n\nHowever, any decisions to allow badger culling in the LRA will be taken by ministers on a case-by-case basis and \nonly in a \u201cvery small number of areas\u201d identified as hotspots by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA).\n\nThe consultation ran from 16 February to 15 April and it attracted 832 responses. Defra said just 3% of respondents \nidentified themselves as \u201cfarmers or from farming organisations\u201d.\n\nMost of the farming community would support extending the badger cull into low-risk areas of England to tackle \nbovine TB, according to the findings of the government consultation.\n\nThey stressed the importance of tackling the disease both in wildlife and cattle.\n\nFarmer support\n\nMost of those who expressed support for culling said they felt it would help stop the spread of TB in low-risk \ncounties. These included the NFU, the British Cattle Veterinary Association (BCVA), and the British Veterinary \nAssociation (BVA).\n\nHowever, opponents, including the Badger Trust and the Humane Society International (HSI) UK, expressed \nconcerns about the badger culling policy itself and the scientific evidence relied on to formulate it.\n\nThe Badger Trust and Born Free organisations said irrespective of the level of infection of badgers in the LRA, there \nwas no evidence that badgers are a risk to cattle in the LRA, therefore culling was not justified.\n\n\nThe Wildlife Trusts, Zoological Society of London (ZSL), the Badger Trust and the Animal Welfare Group all \nsupported government-led vaccination, but not culling.\n\nDefra view 'unchanged'\n\nIn its response, however, the government hinted that badger culling will soon be extended to low-risk areas.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s view remains that enabling badger control in the LRA where disease in badgers is linked with \ninfected herds is a rational extension of the TB strategy to eradicate bovine TB,\u201d said Defra.\n\nIts objective for the LRA is to \u201ccontinue to protect it from the ingress of disease through the movement of cattle and \nthe possible resulting infection of wildlife vectors\u201d.\n\nTB strategy review\n\nThe government added that its position remains that \u201cvaccination is unlikely to lead to disease eradication in the \nbadger population within an acceptable time limit\u201d.\n\nOn Thursday (24 May), Defra published a document on new guidance to Natural England on badger culling \nlicences to control the risk of bovine TB. The document also details policy requirements for the low-risk area and \nareas considering supplementary culling following four-year culls.\n\nA review of the government\u2019s 25-year TB eradication strategy for England is currently being chaired by Sir Charles \nGodfray, a population biologist and fellow of the Royal Society.\n\nCompensation announcement\n\nDefra has also rubber-stamped a proposal to pay compensation at 50% of the average market price for any animal \nbrought into a TB breakdown herd which then fails a TB test whilst that breakdown is still ongoing.  \n\nThis already happens in Wales, but the UK government has confirmed it will apply in England from 1 November \n2018.\n\nIn a written statement to parliament, farm minister George Eustice said: \u201cThe proposal is intended to encourage \nherd owners to take further steps to improve their disease controls in a sensible and proportionate manner.\n\n\u201cOne way they can do this is to seek accreditation under a scheme based on the standards laid down by the Cattle \nHealth Certification Standards (CHeCS) body.\n\n\u201cHerds which are accredited at the time of the breakdown will continue to receive 100% compensation for all \ncompulsorily slaughtered cattle.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nDefra has confirmed some farmers and landowners who have yet to be paid their Countryside Stewardship (CS) \nmoney, will benefit from a 75% bridging payment, with the money hitting bank accounts by the end of June.\n\nSpecifically, Defra says mid-tier agreement holders, who claimed payments in 2017, will receive a bridging payment \nif they have not been paid by 21 June.\n\nSee also: Bridging cash needed to plug Countryside Stewardship scheme hole\n\nThe move follows a concerted lobbying effort by the Country Land and Business Association (CLA), the NFU and \nthe Tenant Farmers Association (TFA), which wrote to Defra secretary Michael Gove earlier this week, describing \nthe payment situation as a \u201cshambles\u201d.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe backlog of farmers awaiting payments for environmental work, some up to nine months, is unacceptable and \nmust be sorted quickly,\u201d said the letter.\n\nA day later, Defra put out a statement explaining affected customers will soon receive 75% of the estimated value of \ntheir CS 2017 claims in the form of an interest-free loan.\n\n\u201cWhen the full payment is processed and made, the amount paid through the bridging payment will be held back,\u201d it \nadded.\n\nInadequate\n\nDefra says some 82% of 2017 CS claimants have already received a payment for environmental work on their \nfarms, so 18% will now get bridging payments.\n\nBut, while acknowledging the move as a \u201cwelcome first step\u201d, NFU deputy president Guy Smith said it \nwas \u201cinadequate\u201d it was only going to those on mid-tier schemes.\n\n\u201cThis bridging payment covers less than half of farmers involved in agri-environment schemes \u2013 those on higher-tier \nCS, entry-level stewardship or higher-level stewardship will not see the benefit,\u201d said Mr Smith, adding the issue \nshould have been sorted out far sooner as the problems had been apparent since the start of the year.\n\nHe also described the measure as a \u201csticking plaster\u201d which could not mask the deeper problems with CS, including \nits complexity and problems with getting applications accepted.\n\nThe NFU, together with the CLA and TFA, is asking Defra to consider simply rolling over existing ELS and HLS \nschemes on an annual basis, until a new environmental land management scheme is up and running post Brexit, so \nby-passing CS.\n\nFailure to do so would put at risk the many years of valuable conservation work farmers have already delivered.\n\nWhen will final BPS money go out?\n\nThe Tenant Farmers Association (TFA) is calling for urgent clarity from the Rural Payments Agency as to when \nfarmers will receive their final balancing payments under the 2017 BPS scheme.\n\nThe association says it has been told many farmers will not receive these payments by 30 June \u2013 the deadline set \nby Brussels.\n\nBridging payments worth 75% of the expected full amount went out to 3,200 farms in April, but the TFA says many \nare still feeling the financial pressure.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nDefra is facing an \u201cimpossible challenge\u201d and is \u201cin the dark\u201d about how to prepare for Brexit, a government scrutiny \ncommittee has warned.\n\nThe Public Accounts Committee\u2019s report, released on Friday 4 May, says preparations for Brexit are being \nhampered by uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future relationship with the European Union.\n\nDefra and the Department for International Trade (DIT) were described as being without a clear plan of top \npriorities.\n\nSee also: Brexit green schemes a \u2018no-brainer\u2019 for farmers, says Eustice\n\nBut, the report adds, both departments appear optimistic that they can deliver what\u2019s required by March 2019, \nwhatever the outcome of the negotiations.\n\n\n\nHaving to work up options for three different scenarios \u2013 deal, no deal or transition \u2013 is \u201ctime-consuming and costly\u201d \nfor Defra in particular.\n\nIt also has to navigate new legislation and major IT programmes in a very short time, though the committee is \nconcerned this may not be realistic.\n\nDefra has said it will fall back on manual systems to deliver Brexit, but this could impede or slow down imports and \nexports, and cause severe delays at the border.\n\n\u201cThere are substantial risks, including disruption to the agri-food and chemicals industries, if Defra\u2019s IT systems are \nnot ready in time,\u201d the committee said.\n\nDefra to make changes\n\nDefra has 64 active workstreams \u2013 up from 43 when the committee took evidence in March \u2013 from import controls \non animals and animal products to the authorisation of new chemical products.\n\nThe committee has said it is \u201cunrealistic\u201d to expect Defra to make its planned \u00a3138m of savings in 2018-19 while \ndelivering its Brexit programme and its usual work.\n\nIt has recommended Defra set out a list of programmes it plans to stop, postpone or minimise by the end of June.\n\nCommittee chair Meg Hillier said: \u201cOur committee has repeatedly raised concerns about government\u2019s \npreparedness for life outside the EU. The clock is ticking and there is still no clarity about what Brexit will mean in \npractice.\n\n\u201cDepartments are under extreme pressure. If parliament is to hold them to account, then it is vital that government \nis as transparent as possible on the progress being made.\u201d\n\nClose collaboration \u2018vital\u2019\n\nA spokesman for the government said: \u201cWe have already agreed the terms of an implementation period that will \nprovide businesses with the continuity they need to prepare and thrive after we leave the EU.\n\n\u201cWork is being undertaken across the whole of government, in a range of exit scenarios in preparation for our \nwithdrawal from the EU.\n\n\u201cClose collaboration between departments is vital as we negotiate our exit from the EU and develop our future trade \npolicy with the world, and Whitehall is rising to the challenge.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA \u00a35.3m package unveiled by Defra aims to improve the resilience, sustainability and quality of major crops for UK \nfarmers.\n\nFour leading agricultural research centres will help develop new technologies and environmentally friendly \nproduction for farmers and growers across the country.\n\nSee also: Why urgent research is needed to fight flea beetle\n\nThey will focus on boosting productivity for pulses, wheat, leafy vegetables and oilseed rape as part of Defra\u2019s Crop \nGenetic Improvement Networks (GINs).\n\nDefra secretary Michael Gove said: \u201cDeveloping new technology is crucial to making sure our farmers can continue \nto grow world-class produce in an environmentally friendly way.\"\n\n\n\nResistance\n\n\u201cThrough this new fund, I hope to see the creation of new and innovative growing practices and crop protections so \nwe can truly unlock the potential of our food and farming industries.\u201d\n\nSince their creation in 2003, Defra\u2019s GINs have helped increase crop resistance to pests and diseases such as \norange blossom midge and turnip mosaic virus.\n\nThey have also helped researchers and scientists enhance pea crops, which are now being used to produce high-\nquality animal feed.\n\nCrop production\n\nThe four recipients that will undertake the research are the John Innes Centre, Rothamsted Research, University of \nWarwick and University of York.\n\nIan Bancroft, who leads the agricultural research centre at the University of York, said: \u201cInnovation through these \nnetworks is essential if we are to see growth in healthy crop production.\u201d\n\nThe government has so far invested \u00a3160m through its agri-tech strategy to harness the latest agricultural research \nand technologies.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nScottish farms are finally entering the market after poor spring weather delayed photographs and marketing plans in \nthe first four months of the year.\n\nPublicly marketed acres are down by nearly a third on 2017, but a number of May and June launches have \nsurfaced.  \n\nAgents say buyers are poised and tight supply is already leading to healthy competition.\n\nSee also: More than 3,000 acres hit spring farmland market\n\nMost of the 4,000 acres on the open market from January to April were bare blocks and small farms.\n\nEarlier this month Strutt & Parker launched 220-acre East Bowhouse at Leslie in Fife at offers over \u00a31.5m, but it \nacknowledged that supply has been slow.\n\nAssociate director William Dalrymple said: \u201cIt has been relatively quiet compared to last year, however 2017 saw \nsome exceptional early spring launches.\n\n\u201cWith the exception of three farms, all those marketed in Scotland so far this year have been under 250 acres, \nwhich shows us that it is the smaller, less profitable units which are being sold.\n\n\u201cIt is still early in the season for Scottish sales though, and there are some interesting farms in the pipeline.\u201d\n\nSavills agreed that the market had been slow to get underway following a wet winter and slow spring.\n\nThe firm\u2019s director of rural agency, Evelyn Channing, predicted restricted supply would remain.\n\n\u201cIt feels like volume will again be constrained this year \u2013 we are certainly not expecting to be awash with farms,\u201d she \nsaid.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of estate sales which will include in-hand land and farming opportunities. I definitely perceive \nthat buyers are poised to spring into action.\u201d\n\n\n\nSales already agreed\n\nStrong demand from fast-moving buyers has been evident in Ayrshire.\n\nBob Cherry, partner at Galbraith, said two farms he brought to the market in March \u2013 140-acre Roughdyke Farm at \n\u00a3795,000 and 112-acre MacQuittiston Farm for \u00a3585,000 \u2013 both went under offer in late April. \n\n\u201cThe market for farms and farmland in Ayr is still strong, despite the atrocious weather we have experienced over \nthe past couple of months,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur approach is to consider dividing farm sales into lots, where appropriate, to open up the sale to a wider pool of \nbuyers.\u201d\n\nNew to market \n\nFarms of reasonable scale have been hard to come by so far this year, but Savills has two to launch. \n\nElphinstone Tower Farm has 450 acres in the heart of East Lothian, 12 miles from Edinburgh.\n\nOffers over \u00a33.25m as a whole, or in three lots, are invited for the arable unit, which includes buildings and a two-\nbedroom cottage.\n\n\u201cWe are anticipating strong interest from both the local market and buyers from south of the border looking to \nScotland for scale,\u201d said selling agent Luke French.\n\nFurther north, lying south of the Angus Glens at Fern, 350-acre Balquhadly has just hit the market.\n\nIt could attract livestock

dementia.\n\nPublished to coincide with Dementia Action Week which ends on Sunday 27 May, it urges individuals, community \ngroups and organisations to do more for those affected.\n\nSee also: Results of study into rural dementia revealed\n\nLiving in the countryside and having dementia (caused when the brain is damaged by diseases, such as \nAlzheimer\u2019s) can put people in a position of \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d, according to the report.\n\nThey can be left feeling \u201cexcluded and disempowered\u201d, unable to access support, guidance and services such as \ntransport, shops, healthcare and banks.\n\nThere is more society needs to do to ensure everyone, in every corner of the country is supported Jeremy \nHughes, Alzheimer\u2019s Society chief executive\n\n\u201cThere is more society needs to do to ensure everyone, in every corner of the country is supported,\u201d said \nAlzheimer\u2019s Society chief executive Jeremy Hughes.\n\n\u201cTwo thirds of people with dementia are based in rural areas.\u201d\n\nSafety hazards\n\nThe condition can have particular implications in the agricultural sector because farmers often continue working \nlong after the state retirement age.\n\nThere are also additional safety hazards, such as machinery, silage pits or livestock, and the often-solitary nature of \nthe job can lead to delays in calling for help \u2013 or it arriving \u2013 following an accident.\n\n\u201cThe cost in time and money of attending appointments can be particularly prohibitive for farmers, who are self-\nemployed and may not have someone to manage the farm or have to pay for additional staff, added Mr Hughes.\n\n\n\nDementia facts\n\nBegins with mild symptoms that get worse\n\nA person experiencing it might have problems with day-to-day memory, difficulties making decisions, language \nissues, problems with perception of where objects are, lose track of the day or date, or show changes in their mood\n\n225,000 people will develop it this year\n\nOne in six people over the age of 80 have it\n\nCharles Smith, chief executive of the Farming Community Network which was involved in the development of this \nguide, said the charity is seeing more cases of dementia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not exclusively a disease of old age, but it\u2019s often associated with it \u2013 and as the farming population gets older, \nso we are likely to see more.\n\n\u201cFarmers frequently stay working and involved with the business later in life so, if they\u2019re affected with dementia, \nroutine tasks can get forgotten or done too many times.\n\n\u201cIn extreme cases, they can be at risk using machinery or even get lost.\"\n\nResearch has also shown you are far more likely to develop dementia if you are lonely, so encouraging social \ninteraction is really important, added Mr Smith.\n\nGood to talk\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to talk about this as a family so you can develop coping strategies. It\u2019s a physical health issue \u2013 \nthere\u2019s absolutely no shame attached to it.\u201d\n\nThe guide also highlights the importance of members of farming families having discussions about lasting powers of \nattorney and succession planning.\n\nVillage schools, youth groups, Guides and Scouts all have a role to play giving support, as do Young Farmers \u2013 and \nthe report praises the work of the National Federation of Young Farmers\u2019 Clubs\u2019 Rural+ campaign which was \ndeveloped by \u2013 and run in association with \u2013 FCN.\n\nLaunched in 2014, this aimed to raise awareness of rural isolation, dementia and mental health.\n\n\u201cYoung farmers play an integral role within rural communities as they communicate and work with the older \ngeneration who are less likely to talk about any issues they may be facing,\u201d Mr Hughes said.  \n\n\u201cThis raises awareness, reduces the stigma of dementia, and builds stronger and healthier rural communities.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe wife of a Somerset County Council tenant has spoken of her heartbreak as the couple prepares to leave their \ndairy farm ahead of its sale.\n\nSue and David Osborne have \u201cfought tooth and nail\u201d to stay at 135-acre Oxenford Farm, near Ilminster, where they \nhave lived for 16 years.\n\nBut the unit is one of seven being sold this year by the council to free up capital to invest in public services.\n\nSee also: What to do if your landlord decides to sell the farm\n\nEarlier this month their Holstein herd was sold and the farm \u2013 usually occupied by 300 cattle \u2013 fell silent.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like being on the Mary Celeste or standing in a ghost town,\u201d Mrs Osborne said. \u201cThe lights are on but no one is \nhome.\n\n\u201cWe are here taking apart something we have built since 2002 and David has designed and created a lot of this. It\u2019s \ndevastating for him.\u201d\n\nMrs Osborne, a district councillor, blames funding cuts and the pressure from central government being put on local \nauthority finances.\n\n\u201cCouncil farms are highly saleable assets and if you are under a farm business tenancy, once it comes to an end, \nyou\u2019re out if you can\u2019t afford to buy it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe couple explored all possible avenues, including raising a large mortgage and working with an investor, but just \ncouldn\u2019t make the numbers work.\n\nAt the eleventh hour they thought they had found a solution, with a local farmer offering to buy Oxenford and keep \nthe Osbornes in place until their retirement.\n\n\u201cHe has three sons who want to farm in the long term, so put in an offer of \u00a31.6m with a view to us staying for three \nto five years,\u201dMrs Osborne said.\n\n\u201cThe bid was turned down, apparently because it is worth more on the open market.\u201d\n\nSeven council farms on market\n\nSomerset County Council says it has not received any offers that match what advisers expect to receive on the \nopen market.\n\nThe authority is selling seven of its farms this year \u2013 units where tenancies are coming to an end and are not being \nreviewed.\n\nIt will bring the number of farms in its portfolio down to 20.\n\n\u201cThe farms being sold are surplus to our requirements and the money generated is used to fund valuable and \nmuch-needed capital projects that benefit the entire county such as the building of new schools,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\n\u201cWe are expecting to raise about \u00a38m from the sale of these seven farms.\n\n\u201cSince the policy was introduced in 2009, we have raised about \u00a335m from the sale of about 30 farms.\u201d\n\nWhich Somerset County Council farms are being sold?\n\nWhitney Farm, Donyatt, 50 acres (60 acres retained)\n\nEastside Farm, Bridgwater, 101 acres (24 acres retained)\n\nOxenford Farm, Dowlish Manor, 135 acres\n\nDolly\u2019s Pool Dairy, Donyatt, 10 acres (100 acres retained)\n\nStream Farm, Weare, 52 acres (30 acres retained)\n\nSelwood Farm, Lympsham, 73 acres  \n\nColdharbour Farm, Donyatt 145 acres\n\n'Done all we can to stay'\n\n\n\nMrs Osborne thinks industry bodies and organisations have a duty to fight to protect council farms from being sold.\n\n\u201cWe were on a starter farm before we progressed to this one,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cUnless the industry really ramps up a campaign against the sale of these farms, you won\u2019t have them at all in 10 \nyears, because the pressure on local governments to sell is horrendous.\n\n\u201cWe have done all we can to stay here, but it\u2019s not enough.\u201d\n\nThe couple have to vacate the farm and farmhouse by 31 May, and are currently searching for new work \nopportunities.\n\nAt the time of writing, two of the council\u2019s units \u2013 Whitney Farm at Donyatt and Eastside Farm at Bridgwater \u2013 were \nset to be sold to sitting tenants.\n\nThe remainder will be auctioned, with the council expecting sales to be completed by the end of June.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nOxfordshire grower James Alexander hopes to increase yields while drastically cutting his diesel bill by switching to \ndirect drilling across his 323ha of organic cropping.\n\nThe direct drilling advocate already employs no-till across an additional 81ha of conventional cropping \u2013 matching \nhis neighbours\u2019 yields with an average of 8.6t/ha while spending far less on cultivation and pesticides.\n\nWith a diesel bill four times higher and yields plateauing at an average of 3.7t/ha, direct drilling is the obvious \nsolution for this contract grower to maximise his returns from the organic cropping area.\n\nSee also: Top tips from two US no-till and cover crop veterans\n\nWithout being able to plough, weed control is usually the hurdle organic growers have to overcome if they are to \ndirect drill, but Mr Alexander is achieving this through a combination of cover crops, mechanical weeders and high \nseed rates.\n\nInstead, his problem is not being able to successfully kill off the cover crops grown for both nutrition and weed \ncontrol to allow the following winter wheat to be direct drilled.\n\nName: James Alexander\n\nProblem being solved: Forms of weed control other than ploughing must be found if organic farmers are to be able \nto use no-till cultivation on their farms.\n\nApproach: Using a mixture of high seed rates, mechanical weeders and cover crops to manage weeds, and \nemploying a crimper roller to kill off cover crops.\n\nKilling cover crops\n\nIn the absence of glyphosate the owner of cross-slot drill manufacturer Primewest has built his own crimper roller, a \nknife roller designed to roll, cut and bruise cover crops in front of a direct drill, to experiment with.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to build one for a long time, but with glyphosate\u2019s future in doubt long-term, we thought we must do it \nnow,\u201d he says.\n\nAfter the first roller was snapped up by a customer in Lincolnshire, Mr Alexander built a second roller to allow \nexperimentation on his own farm.\n\n\n\nAround 81ha of cover crop are grown each year to put nitrogen back into the drought-prone limestone brash over \nrock soils after a lengthy rotation of winter wheat, spring barley, spring or winter oats, beans and then spring wheat.\n\nThis one-year break is extended to two in areas plagued with blackgrass as part of a zero-tolerance approach to the \ngrassweed, an approach that often sees him top sections with high blackgrass plant populations.\n\nWhile these cover crops are direct drilled at the end of the rotation, Mr Alexander currently has to plough after the \none- or two-year break before he can drill winter wheat.\n\n\u201cBecause of the cover crop we haven\u2019t moved the soil for two years, then we have to move it all up,\u201d he says. \n\u201cPloughing is the worst thing you can do for your soil.\u201d\n\nMix of species\n\nMr Alexander, who is part of the Innovative Farmer\u2019s alternative methods for terminating cover crops trial, says the \ndifficulty in killing a cover crop without glyphosate lies in the fact that good cover crops are a mix of species.\n\nA mix means that the crop will not reach the ideal stage for crimping, flowering, at the same time.\n\nFor blackgrass control a combination of red clover and rye grass is used, while the one-year fertilising crop is vetch \nand oats.\n\n\u201cWe tried crimping so that we can kill the vetch but not the oats. The oats just grow back, even if you mow them.\u201d\n\nThe year he is trying vetch with rye, the main cover crop used in the USA, for the first time.\n\nHe plans to lay the crop onto the ground in June and crimp it to create a weed-suppressing mat which will last until \nthe winter wheat is drilled in October.\n\nIf it doesn\u2019t, a second cover crop will be drilled in July or August. This is likely to consist of a frost-intolerant plant, or \nmix of plants, such as buckwheat, mustard or phacelia, which can remain in the wheat crop and be taken out by the \ncold.\n\nDepending on how experiments with crimping this new mix work this summer, Mr Alexander thinks he could be \ndirect drilling his cereal crops within three years.\n\nWhile this crimper goes on the front, he is also thinking of looking at trailed versions which would go over the \nground faster.\n\n\u201cHopefully, over summer we can try out a few things,\u201d he says.\n\nPermanent clover\n\nHe is also planning to try establishing a permanent clover cover crop, which would remain in the bottom of the crop \nto provide both nutrition and weed control.\n\n\u201cIf we could get clover to linger in the field all year round, we would be laughing, but we need to find the right \nvariety.\u201d\n\nAs well as the British climate being a challenge to achieving this, not being able to mow the clover to stimulate \ngrowth after the commercial crop has established is a problem.\n\nMr Alexander has also found that once certain types of clover have established, herbicides are necessary to get rid \nof them.\n\n\n\nFor this reason, he trials new ideas on the conventional farm first, so herbicides are always available as a fall-back \nposition when they don\u2019t work out.\n\nIf glyphosate was banned, Mr Alexander would like to think he would be able to continue direct drilling on his \nconventional farm as herbicides are already used minimally.\n\nBlackgrass is no longer a problem, so crops of wheat and rape are often grown with just a pre-emergence \nherbicide.\n\nHe is also using less fungicide and no insecticide, and uses the farm to showcase the benefits of ultra-low-\ndisturbance direct drilling to his drill customers.\n\nMeanwhile, with the organic licence due to run out at the time of Brexit and very mixed messages coming from \nDefra about soil health, coupled with high input costs, the owners of the organic farm may take the opportunity to \nrevert.\n\nWeed control strategy\n\nJames Alexander\u2019s strategy for weed control on his organic land involves high seed rates, cover crops and the use \nof mechanical weeders.\n\nA seed rate of 400 seeds/sq m is used in both spring and autumn to try to compete out weeds.\n\nBlackgrass is a problem in some areas on the farm and is met with a zero-tolerance approach. Select areas of \ncrops where the grassweed is gaining a foothold are often topped to stop the spread of seed.\n\nLast season Mr Alexander topped a field of beans which had become more grassweed than beans, and considered \ntopping a field of wheat.\n\nA two-year cover crop of red clover and rye grass is put in for two years to eliminate the grassweed in affected \nfields.\n\nDocks and thistles are the biggest issue on the farm. These are cut out of a growing crop using a CombCut, a \nselective weed mower, which is passed through the crop four or five times a season.\n\nThe coarser weeds are caught in the fixed blades and cut off completely or severely damaged.\n\nTrailblazers\n\nThis new series aims to showcase arable farmers who are ahead of their time and are trying new approaches, \nwhether it's growing new crops, taking a radical approach to growing oilseed rape or being a pioneer in the use of \nnew technology.\n\nIf you know of any farmer or wish to be featured in this new series, contact the arable editor

growing population could spread serious diseases.\n\nAccording to the National Pig Association (NPA), the Gloucestershire forest saw a trebling of boars between 2013 \nand 2017 to peak at almost 1,600 last year.\n\nSee also: Danes and Poles plan 800 miles of fence to halt wild boar\n\nmailto:richard.allison@reedbusiness.com\n\n\nThe rapid rise in boar numbers is fuelling concern among pig sector officials over the potential future transmission \nof diseases such as African swine fever (ASF).\n\nAlthough ASF has not yet been seen in the UK, the disease is progressing steadily westwards from Russia into \nEuropean countries.\n\nDisease spread\n\nThe movement of infected wild boar has been blamed for much of the spread but the virus has also been carried \nover larger distances by farmworkers and visitors.\n\nThe UK\u2019s reliance on farmworkers from eastern Europe, combined with the growing wild boar population, means it \nis vulnerable so potential wild populations, which could harbour the disease, must be addressed, according to the \nNPA and the Pig Veterinary Society (PVS).\n\nSpeaking on the NPA\u2019s website, PVS vice-president Richard Pearson, said: \u201cASF and the expanding feral boar \npopulation in the Forest of Dean are of significant concern to the PVS and the pig sector more widely.\n\n\u201cSo while our UK status as an island affords us protection from migrating wild boar in Europe, our feral pigs do give \ncause for rising unease, especially given the number of [former] Eastern Bloc workers returning with meat products \nthat could enter the food chain.\u201d\n\nSolutions\n\nNPA chief executive Zoe Davies added she had already begun discussions with local Conservative MP, Mark \nHarper, and wildlife groups such as the Deer Initiative to discuss possible solutions to the problem.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been talking to Mr Harper about the industry/Forestry Commission joint-funding a dedicated resource to co-\nordinate efforts by farmers, councils, stalkers and Natural England to control the boar population more effectively,\u201d \nDr Davies said.\n\nShe also hopes to secure levy money funding through AHDB Pork to help fund a proper control plan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d hope with the emphasis on export markets and the risk those feral pigs pose, the AHDB will agree it is an \nentirely sensible use of levy payers\u2019 money,\u201d Dr Davies said, stressing that ideas and discussions were still at a \nvery early stage.\n\nHowever, she said that one aim could be to provide a co-ordinator role to oversee effective collaboration between \nthe Forestry Commission rangers, Natural England, local landowners, pig keepers and farmers, as well as the \nhunters, councils and emergency services.\n\nThe role could improve public information about wild boar to the public, log data on culling and co-ordinate work to \ncontrol feral pigs more effectively, she envisaged.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe failure of the voluntary code of practice (VCOP) to deliver any lasting change has left the NFU with no option \nbut to call for milk contract regulation, according its dairy board.\n\nDespite some milk buyers making great strides towards a fairer system, bad practices were still rife in the industry, \naccording to an open letter signed by the NFU\u2019s Michael Oakes, dairy board chairman, Sian Davies, chief dairy \nadviser and Nina Winter, chief legal adviser.\n\nSee also: Muller confirms fixed-price milk contract\n\n\n\nThe industry could not continue with farmers shouldering all the risk and with buyers making amendments to \ncontracts as and when it suits themselves, the letter said.\n\nThis had been evident during recent market crashes which highlighted how some buyers slashed contracts to \nprotect margins, in turn cutting many dairy farm businesses to the bone.\n\nWhat is the NFU calling for?\n\nDefra has indicated in its recent Command Paper it would seek to adopt the EU Commission\u2019s common market \norganisation regulation (CMO), a document described by the NFU as \u201cprescriptive\u201d and \u201cinflexible\u201d.\n\nWhat does the common market organisation regulation say about dairy?\n\nContracts should have transparent pricing\n\nPrices should either be fixed or linked to market signals\n\nMinimum contract length of six months\n\nEncourages the creation of producer organisations\n\nIncludes safety net provisions such as skim-milk powder intervention storage\n\nHowever, the NFU has indicated the CMO could be used as a framework for new regulations, leaving Defra with the \noption of creating a bespoke set of contractual rules for the dairy industry after the UK leaves the EU.\n\n\u201cWe gave the VCOP a good shot but it\u2019s clear some buyers just can\u2019t be trusted to deliver fair contract terms,\u201d said \nMr Oakes.\n\n\u201cThey continue to use and abuse farmers as a tool to manage their own business risk, so we have no choice but to \ncall for the regulation of dairy contracts.\n\n\u201cWe want to see a flexible and innovative regulation that delivers fair terms for farmers and an equitable balancing \nof risk between farmers and buyers.\u201d\n\nMr Oakes added that as the UK leaves the EU, the dairy market would not be able to be commercially focused, \ninnovative and competitive if buyers continued to live in the dark ages using unfair contracts to manage risk. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for buyers to look to the future, operate as proper commercial businesses and deal with farmers fairly.  \nThat\u2019s all we\u2019ve ever wanted on dairy contracts \u2013 fair terms,\u201d Mr Oakes said.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA short film inspired by the gay son of a farmer is seeking to open up conversations about farmers who may be \nstruggling in silence with their sexuality.\n\nTwo years ago Rupert Williams, who's father is a Lancashire dairy farmer, began working with award-winning \nfilmmaker Matt Houghton, having researched homosexuality in rural areas some years earlier.\n\nPart of his own investigation led him to contact Cheshire-based farmer-turned-chaplain Keith Ineson, who set up the \nonly helpline dedicated to gay farmers in 2010.\n\nSee also: How gay-tolerant is the countryside?\n\nSince then Keith has taken hundreds of calls from farmers who have nobody to turn to for support, often living in \ncomplete isolation or with family they feel they can\u2019t talk to for fear of causing upset or awkwardness. The helpline \ngets at least one new caller every week.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s well-known that suicide rates in agriculture are among the highest of any profession in the UK, especially among \nmen.\n\nCouple that with the fact that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) people are at a far greater risk \nof mental health problems, which includes having thoughts about ending their lives, and you\u2019ve got a recipe that \nputs gay farmers in an extremely high-risk category.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no roadmap to doing this sort of thing and it was difficult for me growing up,\u201d Rupert explains, thinking \nabout his own experiences as a gay man being part of a farming family. \u201cThere was a silence about it, a not \nknowing what to do. I knew that farming wasn\u2019t my world.\u201d\n\nToday, Rupert lives and works in London as a social worker and has previously worked at the London Lesbian and \nGay Switchboard, but his experiences of growing up on the farm prompted good friend Matt to start work on the \ndocumentary, titled Landline. \n\nA sense of isolation \n\nRupert's feelings of isolation and confusion are precisely what this short film is aiming to help with. It takes a \nhandful of cases where people from farming communities had called the Gay Farmer Helpline, showing a \nreconstruction of the moments and emotions described in their recorded phone conversations.\n\nYou can watch a trailer of the film below.\n\nLandline | Trailer from Matt Houghton on Vimeo.\n\n\u201cSpeaking to Rupert one evening, we got talking about what it was like for him growing up in a farming family as a \nqueer man, and the unique sense of isolation that he felt,\u201d says director Matt.\n\n\u201cAs we researched further, we began to understand the extent to which being an LGBTQ farmer was so heavily \nwrapped up in ideas of identity. Keith Ineson\u2019s helpline seemed a unique lens through which to explore these \nideas.\u201d\n\nOver the course of about a year, they collected stories and experiences from farmers who have dialled 07837 \n931894  \u2013 the Gay Farmer Helpline number.\n\nA series of recorded telephone conversations form the heart of the captivating 12-minute film, funded by Film \nLondon and made with Pulse Films and production company Fee Fie Foe. \n\nWhat may surprise viewers, though, is that not all of the case studies are sad and depressing \u2013 far from it in fact. \nThere are cutting personal accounts that pull at the heartstrings, but Landline also features stories of falling in love, \nof stress and risk-taking and of overwhelming support from family, friends and the wider community upon coming \nout as an openly gay person in farming.\n\n\u201cThese are stories about mental health, rejection and acceptance, but what the film also shows is that farming \ncommunities can be supportive,\u201d Rupert adds.\n\n\u201cI think part of the reason for doing this was a curiosity to see if there were other people out there like me. I thought \nthat there must be others out there who are struggling with their sexuality. I wanted to shed light on that, see what \nother people's experiences were and ultimately raise awareness.\u201d\n\nOne thing viewers will notice about this film is that all five of the case studies are men, but that\u2019s not through lack of \nresearch or making the assumption that this is an issue that doesn\u2019t affect women.\n\nWhile he\u2019s certain that isn\u2019t the case, Rupert admits that the team found it hard to identify LGBTQ women in \nagriculture and even those they did contact weren\u2019t keen to talk. This is a barrier that the documentary makers \nsometimes hit when speaking to men too, such is the fear of speaking out about who they are.\n\n\n\n\u201cSome people were quite hesitant about telling their story but they wanted to. In the end they were quite eager to \ntalk about their lives and I think some found it quite therapeutic to tell their story,\u201d says Rupert.\n\nIt's good to talk\n\nThe short documentary has been been screened at a number of film festivals in the UK and abroad and was picked \nas one of the British Film Institute\u2019s (BFI) Five Films for Freedom, branded the world\u2019s widest-reaching LGBTQ \ndigital campaign.\n\nLandline was watched more than 460,000 times during the 12-day London film festival BFI Flare, which showcases \nnew and classic LGBTQ films from around the world. It has also won an HBO Documentary Short Film Award and \nwill eventually be publicly available to watch online.\n\nBut ambitions for this candid, intimate and at times shocking short film stretch well beyond sparking ardent \napplause from the metropolitan scenes of London and gaining accolades from international film buffs.\n\n\u201cIt is the honesty and openness of our contributors that made this film possible,\u201d says Matt. \u201cTo me, it is defined by \nits intimacy but in depicting the very personal.

It\u2019s not a matter of ignorance, \nit\u2019s more naivety I think.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nArable growers in the West Country face a constant battle to harvest grain at an acceptable moisture, so having \na decent drying set-up is essential \u2013 even if they're expensive to purchase, fuel costs erode ever-decreasing \nmargins.\n\nBut what if someone actually paid you to dry your grain? When it was introduced in late 2011, the government\u2019s \nRenewable Heat Incentive (RHI) offered exactly that.\n\nSavvy farmers keen to make the most of that opportunity jumped at the chance, but many were confounded by an \nalmost complete absence of off-the-shelf, turn-key biomass dryers on the market.\n\nSee also: Continuous-flow grain dryer transforms harvest\n\nIn 2012, Robin Blatchford, a beef and arable producer on the Wiltshire-Dorset border, found himself in exactly that \nsituation and set out to put together his own set-up.\n\n\u201cWe found ourselves in the position where, to cope with our increasingly late, wet harvests, combines were getting \nbigger and bringing the corn in faster,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cBut the drying side of things got left behind. We had a 30-year-old Alvan Blanch continuous-flow dryer that didn\u2019t \nstand a chance of keeping up with the combine, so inevitably we\u2019d end up with heaps of wet grain backed up \nwaiting to go into store.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, operating the drier was a dusty job. I became sensitised to the dust and one year ended up getting \nquite ill as a result.\n\n\n\n\u201cI decided enough was enough and resolved to build a proper ventilated floor store with the ability to draw moisture \nout of wet grain. The hope was that it would be far easier to maintain and would mean less exposure to dust.\u201d\n\nFarm facts\n\nPeckons Hill Farms, near Shaftesbury, Dorset\n\nFarmed area: 396ha\n\nCropping: Winter wheat 113ha, OSR 57ha, spring barley 57ha, winter beans 57ha, organic wheat 6ha plus 107ha \nof organic grass, ELS and HLS areas\n\nStock: 60-cow suckler herd with followers kept through to heavy store weight\n\nMachinery:\n\nTractors - Fendt 720 and 722, JD 6420-S\n\nLoader \u2013 Caterpillar TH406\n\nCombine \u2013 JD 9780i CTS with 25ft) header\n\nSprayer \u2013 JD 732 with 24m booms\n\nBaler \u2013 Welger D4000 (2001)\n\nDryer \u2013 1,200t ventilated floor store with Farm 2000 straw-burner\n\nStaff: Robin Blatchford plus one full-timer and one part-timer\n\nMaking the money stack up\n\nWanting to make the most of the opportunities that the RHI presented, Mr Blatchford looked into the options for \nbiomass burners capable of doing the job as well as replacing the old oil-fired heating systems in the main \nfarmhouse and a cottage in the yard.\n\nHe was also keen on the idea of using a home-grown fuel source to gain some control over the costs of farm \nenergy bills.\n\nInitially woodchip was the preferred fuel source, but it quickly became apparent that the farm\u2019s woodland wasn\u2019t big \nenough to produce the volume of material required.\n\nIn addition, woodchip boilers were ruled out because of the high numbers of moving parts and consequent \nmaintenance requirements. Instead, he turned to the idea of burning home-grown straw.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science \u2013 you burn straw in a steel box with a water jacket around it. This hot water is passed \nthrough a big radiator that heats the air going into the grain store to dry the grain.\n\n\"We looked around and after talking to several people running straw boilers, I was convinced by their simplicity and \nreliability \u2013 there were a number out there over 30-years-old and still running.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere seemed to be three options \u2013 Dragon Heat, Glen Farrow and Farm 2000. We settled on the latter because \nof its capacity and simplicity.\u201d\n\nGetting the payments\n\n\n\nAt the time, RHI payments were based on the scale of the system \u2013 8.7p/kWhr for anything up to 199kW and \n5.2p/kWhr for anything above that.\n\nHaving plans in place for a 1,200t floor store, the calculated heat output of the suggested gas space heaters \nneeded to be something close to 300kW to dry wet corn at a reasonable pace. A lesser burner would still do the job, \nalbeit at a slower pace.\n\nAlthough tempted by the higher payments for smaller boilers, Mr Blatchford opted for a 294kW Farm 2000 \nBB254H/2 boiler, which qualified for the less-lucrative payments. \n\n\u201cWe had more flexibility for the future in being able to burn any size bale and, because it would need stoking less \noften, less hassle.\n\nCritically, when we really needed it we would have the heat capacity to dry big tonnages of damp grain at a decent \nrate.\n\n\u201cIt was a slightly off-piste project and because of that I felt we needed a bit of hand-holding. At the time there \nseemed to be very few people to do that.\n\nFarm 2000 did not come out on farm but had an excellent manual to help guide us through the boiler installation \nand was very helpful on the telephone.\u201d\n\nHeat transfer\n\n\u201cThe next step was to work out how we\u2019d transfer the heat to the air being blown through the underfloor ducts.\n\n\u201cWhile the various boiler manufacturers could offer plenty of advice and expertise in plumbing their burners into \ntraditional heating systems, no-one was able to supply me with the full package to dry grain.\u201d\n\nSo Mr Blatchford set about designing his own system. Two key elements needed sorting \u2013 a heat exchanger and \nsome means of storing heat.\n\nHe first used Farm 2000\u2019s pipework plan and had a heating design engineer calculate frictional losses and flow \nrates and make some decisions on pump choice \u2013 double-headed Grunfoss units.\n\nThen, having taken advice from a heat exchanger manufacturer on flow rates and temperature drop (300 litres per \nmin with a 10C temp drop through 3in pipe) and Lincolnshire-based fan manufacturer Pellcroft on the airflow \nrequired for the floor store, he was able to make some calculations on the size of heat exchanger required.\n\nArmed with this information, he contacted Heat and Cooling Solutions in Southampton, which double checked the \nfigures and suggested a large, single-core radiator would be the best way to avoid restricting airflow, assuming a \n10C temperature drop in the water entering and exiting the heat exchanger.\n\nFor a cost of around \u00a31,300, a monstrous 2.4m x 3.6m heat exchanger was fitted in an opening on one side of the \nheavily sound-baffled blockhouse hosting the two Typhoon fans.\n\nWater tank heat store\n\nNext it was the heat store. Farm 2000 had suggested installing the biggest insulated water tank available to give \nplenty of buffering capacity and avoid the need to keep the burner running 24 hours a day, but even bespoke-built \nheat reservoirs didn\u2019t match the capacity required.\n\nFlicking through the back pages of Farmers Weekly, Mr Blatchford spotted a Starkey Tankers advert offering \n26,000-litre stainless steel ISO-container bulk liquid tanks for sale.\n\n\n\nSo, for about \u00a35,000, one was delivered and installed in the biomass boiler shed alongside the new grain store with \nvarious 3in tappings welded into it.\n\nIt came shrouded in a thin layer of insulation, but to keep the water warm for a decent spell a 100-150mm coating of \nspray-on foam was applied for an additional cost of about \u00a3700.\n\nWith everything in place it was then a case of plumbing it all in. Although big-bore pipework (3-4in) was used where \npossible, the system itself was kept very simple with straightforward flow and return lines from the boiler to the heat \nstore and from there to the heat exchanger and back.\n\nControls-wise, things were kept equally uncomplicated. A conventional grain-store-style switch panel is used to \nmanually activate the pumps.\n\nFarm 2000 supplied a simple boiler control panel, triggering the single door-mounted fan to fire up as required and \nthe air diverter valve to send air to either the top or bottom of the combustion chamber depending on the stage of \nthe burn cycle.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nWith the set-up installed and running, things seemed to be working well, although the burner seemed to be a bit \nunderpowered.\n\n\u201cWhen we first set it going I was impressed that everything worked as well together as it did,\u201d says Mr Blatchford.\n\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t feel the burner was running as it should, so I decided to turbo-charge it and set a pedestal fan running \nin front of the intake for the factory-fitted unit. Immediately we got a cleaner burn.\n\n\"After a discussion with Farm 2000, it helpfully suggested a much bigger 2.2kW fan unit and new burner control box \nas well, which I believe is now standard for this size boiler.\u201d\n\nTime proven\n\nFive years down the line, the system has run pretty much faultlessly with very few modifications and the old \n13t/hour Alvan Blanch dryer is now up for sale.\n\nAs regards performance, it depends on how dry the straw is. Mr Blatchford has been surprised how cool the water \ncan be to still be able to dry with relative humidity.\n\nCritical to that has been the gantry-mounted Harvest Installations stirrer set-up.\n\n\u201cWe burn two four-string D4000 bales per burn over about 4-5 hours. The only limiting factor in how often we burn is \nthat you do not really want the embers from the previous burn to melt the strings and pop the next bales you put in \nbefore the door is shut or it gets quite exciting.\n\n\"We do have a large hose by the door for these eventualities but have not had to use it yet. The heat output from \neach burn cycle is generally between 800 and 1,000kW, equating to an RHI payment of about \u00a326 per bale.\n\nIn a typical year, with 2,000 tonnes of grain to dry, the farm will generally get through 230 bales.\n\nPutting the value of the straw at \u00a310/bale at harvest, without taking RHIs into account, the fuel bill is about half \nwhat the old dryer used to cost to run.\n\nOn top of that, there\u2019s the heating bill for the house and cottage. Their heat consumption equates to about 150 \nbales/year, or \u00a31,500 \u2013 a third of the previous oil cost.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve still got the oil boiler in the house as back-up and, of course, the Aga,\u201d says Mr Bltachford.\n\n\n\nCash saver\n\nThe total investment in the system came to just shy of \u00a3100,000 but, with the RHIs alone bringing in around \n\u00a310,000/year alongside the cut-price fuel bills, it\u2019s not hard to see the value of the set-up.\n\n\u201cI think the key thing in the success of our system has been its simplicity. If the water is slightly cooler, it\u2019s just going \nto take a bit longer to dry the grain.\n\n\u201cMost things we could mend if we needed to \u2013 I just hope Farm 2000 does not make the controllers too complicated \nin the future,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf I was to do the same thing again, the only thing I might change would be the size of the heat store to give us \nflexibility to hold more heat to use as required. Next time I might go for a 35,000 or 40,000-litre tank.\n\n\u201cAnyone with a 200kW+ biomass plant that is not busy in the summer who has an on-floor store could do exactly \nwhat we have very easily. It just needs a pump and heat exchanger plumbed into the existing system. It is so \nsimple.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing special about the on-floor store. I just use straw as opposed to gas or oil and get paid for doing it.\u201d\n\nCrop conundrum\n\nInitially Mr Blatchford tried burning a range of different materials in the Farm 2000 boiler, but he has come to the \nconclusion that wheat straw is the best bet.\n\n\u201cWe tried old, damp bales of wheat to begin with, but they smoked terribly and produced no heat, so we quickly \nlearnt that the drier the straw was, the better. We tried some miscanthus too and the heat output was phenomenal \nbut it tended to smoke,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cRape straw was another option but invariably it gets cut green and has to be left to dryout before baling. In that \ntime it generally gets several soakings, so you end up with a less-than-dry feedstock \u2013 that makes a huge \ndifference to how much heat you get from a bale.\n\n\u201cNext we tried linseed \u2013 the energy value was huge (like napalm) but the burn cycle was completely uncontrollable \n\u2013 it would flare up to the point where it would run out of oxygen.\n\n\u201cThen it would start to pull air back down the flue and belch back out huge black clouds of smoke \u2013 it looked like \ncross between a steam train and a tractor puller. And, when I opened the inspection door to see what was going on, \na 6ft flame shot out, singing my eyebrows \u2013 a good lesson never to store straw near the burner.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we settled back on wheat straw. Often we\u2019ll RoundUp the field we plan to bale for the boiler so that we know it\u2019ll \nbe properly dead and dry.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe livestock sector has won praise from a senior human health official after figures showed dramatic cuts in \nantibiotics use and almost total compliance with EU medicine laws.\n\nDuring an AHDB Pork event last week, government chief medical officer Sally Davies said she was proud of the UK \nlivestock sector for the work it had done to cut antibiotics use.\n\nSee also: Antibiotics use halved in the pig industry over two years\n\n\u201cYou have halved antibiotics use in two years \u2013 we are aiming by 2020 to hit 99mg/population correction unit [PCU] \nand at 131mg/PCU we are well on the way,\u201d said Dame Sally.\n\n\n\nShe added the use of medicines vital for human health, known as critically important antibiotics, had virtually \nceased altogether and this had been achieved voluntarily.\n\nWelcomed reduction\n\nDame Sally: \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough.

Markets are so local that traders have warned old-crop prices could fall further in some areas\n\nRussia prospects\n\nCombining wheat has begun in Russia and barley is reported to be coming off at 10-15% lower yields than last \nyear.\n\nThe Russian Agriculture Ministry estimated the country\u2019s grain crop at 100m tonnes recently, well down from the \n135m tonnes recorded last year, due to late spring planting and the recent dry weather in southern parts of Russia.\n\nForecasts for Russian wheat output vary widely, from 67.4m tonnes to 73.1m tonnes. The lowest of these would \nmark a 21.5% fall from 2017\u2019s record production, but would still be the country\u2019s third-largest wheat crop ever.\n\nRussia is nevertheless expected to top the league of world wheat exporters in the 2018-19 season.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA pair of petrol-head ag students are preparing to drive from London to Mongolia to raise a heap of cash for a \ncharity helping farmers struggling with mental health issues.\n\nHarper Adams agrics Jon Glen and Alan Walker are gearing up for the drive of their lives as they embark on a \n15,000-mile round trip across the globe in a small, high-mileage two-seater sports car.\n\nStarting on 15 June, they\u2019ll be recording their epic voyage through 22 countries in about seven weeks by posting \nregular updates and videos on social media and on their website.\n\n\n\nSee also: How to get a job as a farm manager\n\nThe pair of agricultural engineering students have been fettling their 22-year-old Mazda MX-5 bought for next to \nnothing, fitting a sump guard to protect the car\u2019s underbelly and replacing the suspension in a bid to make the \njourney as smooth as possible.\n\nThe aim is raise more than \u00a35,000 for the Farming Community Network (FCN) and increase the awareness of \nmental health problems in farming.\n\n\u201cHaving had my own battle with mental health while farming, I appreciate the seriousness of their cause,\u201d says 23-\nyear-old Jon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a charity that\u2019s very close to my heart and Alan is hoping to raise at least \u00a3500 for Kettering General Hospital\u2019s \nCharity Fund.\n\n\u201cThe suicide rate in agriculture is nearly three times that of the accidental death rate,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cOn average 84 people in the British agricultural community take their lives each year.

However, dirt roads like those in Mongolia might \npose an issue. It could rival the Land Rover Defender for a car made of the most rust,\u201d says Jon.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest hurdles to overcome is emphasising that people need to talk about mental health and often this \ncan be the first step to overcoming problems in ones own mental well-being.\u201d\n\nTo find out more about Jon and Alan\u2019s mental adventure, visit their website.

Clarkson\u2019s benefit should be that he received as the result of committing his fraud.\u201d\n\nTo account for his expense of buying the barn eggs would lend a \u201cmeasure of legitimacy\u201d to his fraudulent \nenterprise, the judge added.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nAll the money currently spent on the Common Agricultural Policy in England \u2013 and possibly more \u2013 should be \ntransferred to a new \u201cpublic money for public goods\u201d scheme in England, if farmers are to be incentivised to take \npart.\n\nThat is one of the key demands from the CLA, which has published its detailed proposals for a Land Management \nContract (LMC) to replace the Basic Payments Scheme following a post-Brexit transition.\n\nThe LMC concept was first mooted by the CLA in July last year. The idea is to give farmers a menu of options for \nmanaging land to deliver public benefits.\n\nThey will effectively sign a contract with government, receiving payments based on what they contribute, rather than \nthe amount of land they own.\n\nPolicy report\n\nThese ideas have now been fleshed out in a new report from the CLA called The Land Management Contract \u2013 \nDesign and Delivery in England, a \u201cpositive, progressive and pragmatic\u201d policy for the post-Brexit era.\n\nThe LMC should not be the only tool, the CLA says, but should be one part of a wider policy \u201cto boost profitable \nfarming and forestry through improved productivity, competitiveness and resilience within a thriving rural economy\u201d.\n\nBut a new contract with government should also be used to deliver things such as clean water, carbon storage, \nenhanced public access, biodiversity, heritage and sustainable farming practices \u2013 things that are not normally \nrewarded through any normal market mechanism.\n\nTwo prerequisites for introducing LMCs\n\nUK farmers should continue to have good access to European markets\n\n\n\nAgricultural goods produced to lower standards should not be allowed to undercut British farmers\n\nProper funding\n\nThe paper emphasises that, while a new public goods scheme based on LMCs would present significant \nopportunities for environmental improvement, \u201cthese benefits will only be delivered if the new scheme attracts \nfarmers and land managers by making good business sense\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis will require the government to commit to transferring, over time, at least the current CAP spend into the new \npublic goods scheme, to ensure sufficient incentive,\u201d says the CLA. For England, that would mean spending of \n\u00a32.2bn a year, or more.\n\nCLA president Tim Breitmeyer says his organisation has advocated incentives for land managers to deliver public \ngoods for a long time. \u201cBut this policy will only succeed if it sits alongside a clear plan for supporting profitable food \nproduction, through a transition period and for the long term,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cThis means sufficient investment into the scheme, while avoiding unnecessary complexities and burdensome red \ntape. It also means long-term guaranteed payments so that farm businesses can have the certainty that is crucial in \nplanning for a resilient future.\u201d\n\nWhat the Land Management Contract looks like\n\nThe CLA sets out four key elements to its LMC proposal, insisting that taking part should be a \u201ccommercial decision \nfor land managers\u201d and that it should be \u201ca choice, not an entitlement\u201d. There should be no requirement to be an \n\u201cactive farmer\u201d, it adds, saying anyone who can provide public benefits should be eligible.\n\nFour elements:\n\n1. Universal LMC. This should be available to all land managers, with a menu of options to choose from, such as \nanimal welfare, nutrient management, soil health and climate change adaptation.\n\nThe scheme should be \u201cbroad and shallow\u201d in terms of what is required, with different activities attracting different \npoints and rewards.\n\nA premium should be available above a certain points threshold. The CLA favours schemes that last for three to 10 \nyears, with a \u201crolling application window\u201d, so that people can apply at any time.\n\nWoodland management and sustainable farming practices are an integral part of the Universal LMC.\n\n2. Universal Capital LMC. This part of the plan should also be available to everyone, with one-off payments for \ninfrastructure improvements that deliver public benefits.\n\nDesigned to complement the Universal LMC, this money could be used for things such as fences (to keep livestock \nout of water courses), woody dams (to slow flood waters), manure storage (to reduce ammonia emissions), or \nenriched rearing systems (to improve animal welfare).\n\nAgain, the CLA favours a rolling application window, and suggests co-funding with third parties, such as water \ncompanies, which may benefit from some of the measures.\n\n3. Enhanced LMC. This is designed to encourage more complex land management projects that are targeted at \nimproving the wider natural environment, or enhancing whole landscapes.\n\nIt also seeks to encourage and reward collaboration among groups of landowners and other parties. This would be \nopen to competitive tender and involve both one-off and ongoing payments.\n\n\n\nInitially, payments could be linked to the actions taken, but in the long-run the aim is to base payments on actual \nresults. (Natural England is currently trialling two results-based projects.)\n\n4.Landscape scale restoration projects. While the Enhanced LMC is all about enhancing the natural environment, \nthis last part of the framework is to do with restoring degraded landscapes across large areas.\n\nAgain, this is best undertaken on a collaborative basis, with applicants competing for a finite budget. Projects will \nneed to exceed 5,000ha and bring in funding from outside central government.\n\nWhy a points based system?\n\nAllocating points allows different values to be linked to different outcomes. A land manager could then choose to \nfocus on a small set of high-scoring activities, such as woodland creation or pollinator strips, or make more \nnumerous, but smaller changes across their whole farm.\n\nWhat about the money? Will it be worth it?\n\nTo attract farmer buy-in, a new LMC needs to be suitably flexible, must fit in with existing farm management \npractices, and must come with decent advice and training, says the CLA. But above all, payment rates must be \nattractive.  \n\n\u201cIt cannot be assumed that, without BPS, land managers will automatically apply to any source of government \nfunding,\u201d the report says. \u201cHow future schemes are designed, implemented and incentivised will determine whether \nland-based businesses will engage with them.\u201d\n\nThe CLA explains that, under EU and WTO rules, current payments are restricted to \u201cincome forgone\u201d and \u201ccosts \nincurred\u201d in any environmental projects. This has discouraged more efficient farmers from getting involved, and fails \nto prioritise activities that deliver multiple benefits.\n\nBut the CLA believes the EU is taking too narrow a view of WTO rules, which are really about avoiding trade \ndistortion, and says the UK government can and should go further. \u201cIncome forgone and cost incurred should be the \nfloor for any payment rate,\u201d it says. \u201cIf the government wants to improve the environment, it will have to provide a \nmore attractive proposal.\u201d  \n\nOne way of doing this would be to base \u201cincome forgone\u201d on the top performing farms, rather than just taking the \naverage. Giving more points to activities with greater public benefit will also achieve better results.\n\n \n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var \ni=\"InfogramEmbeds\",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?\"http:\":\"https:\";if(/^\\/{2}/.test(s)&&(\ns=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var \na=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,\"script\",\"infogram-\nasync\",\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\");\n\nFarmers Weekly says\n\nThe Land Management Contract (LMC) idea floated by the CLA last July seems very much in tune with the \nEnvironmental Land Management (ELM) concept recently proposed by Defra secretary Michael Gove in his \u201chealth \nand harmony\u201d consultation. Indeed, it is almost as if the has influenced his thinking.\n\nIf that is the case, there seems every likelihood that the model now described in more detail by the CLA may bear \nsome real resemblance to the type of scheme that eventually sees the light of day at the end of the Brexit process.\n\n\nThe latest CLA document certainly has much to recommend it. For example, the idea of a multi-tiered system, with \na \u201cbroad and shallow\u201d scheme for the masses and a more upmarket option for those with grander ideals, makes \ngood sense.\n\nSo too does having a rolling application period, rather than enforcing a specific deadline that only adds to the \nbureaucratic burden. And a points-based system of payments will make it easier to prioritise those areas of public \ngoods that offer the greatest benefits.\n\nCrucially, the CLA also emphasises that any future LMC/ELM \u2013 call it what you will \u2013 should not be the only thread \nof a new agricultural policy. Public money should also be available to bolster farm productivity and help farmers \ndeal with market volatility. Supply chain inequality must also be addressed.\n\nAs ever, though, it will come down to money. Not only must any new LMC/ELM be easily accessible to the vast \nmajority of farmers, it must also reward them in a way that enables them to see a positive return from the time and \ncapital they will have to put in.\n\nMr Gove should bear this all in mind as he moves on to the next phase of post-Brexit policy formation.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nAgricultural machinery dealer RW Crawfords, based in South Woodham Ferrers in Essex, has invested \u00a33m in a \nnew parts and workshop store on land it owns opposite Writtle University College in Chelmsford.\n\nThe move is due to take place in the coming months and will see full operations relocated to the new site after 38 \nyears in south Essex, with building works on track for an open date in June 2018.\n\nSee also: Workshop legends: We visit Lincs kit dealer Andy Dixon\n\nA 22,000sq ft steel-framed building is already up and will house offices, showrooms and workshops, with more than \n\u00a35m worth of Agco machinery along with Isuzu pickup trucks on show.\n\nThere will also be a dedicated student training room, which will allow Writtle students on both college- and \nuniversity-level agricultural courses access to the latest machinery and an insight into a large-scale dealership.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe head of EU farmers\u2019 lobby Copa-Cogeca has issued a withering attack on plans to cap support payments for \nfarmers.\n\nEuropean farmers and agri-co-operatives met in Brussels on Friday (15 June) to urge the EU to minimise the \n\u201csevere impact\u201d of subsidy cuts on EU farmers \u2013 and they called for a fair deal for farmers on future trade \nagreements.\n\nCopa president Joachim Rukwied said: \u201cWe are disappointed with the EU Commission proposal on the future \nCAP.\"\n\nSee also: EU plans 100k limit on farm payments under new CAP\n\n\u201cIt is unacceptable that more and more is being asked of farmers in terms of respecting tough food safety, welfare \nand environmental requirements for less and less money.\u201d\n\nMr Rukwied spoke out on behalf of the 66 presidents of farmer and co-operative organisations across the EU, after \ndetails emerged last week of the European Commission\u2019s plans for the future of the Common Agricultural Policy \n(CAP).\n\n100,000 subsidy limit\n\n\n\nBrussels has proposed a 100,000 (\u00a387,000) limit on payments to farmers under the next round of the CAP (2021-\n2027), which is due to be implemented after the UK leaves the European Union.\n\nA leaked document had earlier suggested that payments to EU farmers could be limited to \u00a352,000.\n\nMr Rukwied said it was a \u201cmajor concern\u201d that the technology toolbox farmers rely on to maintain their \ncompetitiveness \u201cis being eroded every day\u201d.\n\nEarlier this year, the EU announced plans for a total ban of neonicotinoid pesticides to cover all outdoor crops. The \ncommission is also coming under intense political pressure from environmental lobby groups to ban the popular \nweedkiller glyphosate.\n\nGove outlines plans\n\nDefra secretary Michael Gove indicated last week he was unlikely to approve plans to cap the amount of money \npaid to the largest landowners after Brexit.\n\nHe had previously proposed an upper yearly limit of \u00a3100,000 per landowner, which would free up about \u00a3150m for \nthe environment and other public goods.\n\nMr Gove told MPs Defra was considering alternative plans, contained in its Health and Harmony consultation, for \n\u201ceveryone to take a small slice reduction\u201d.\n\nAn industry farm policy expert told Farmers Weekly: \u201cIf you compare the future CAP models to now, everything \nlooks really gloomy [for farmers].\n\n\u201cEven if we had stayed in the EU, there would be the same problem.\u201d\n\nMercosur warning\n\nMeanwhile, Cogeca president Thomas Magnusson warned that the potential issue of free-trade agreements could \nseriously undermine EU farmers\u2019 ability to compete.\n\nIn particular, Copa-Cogeca is concerned that standards could be weakened or farmers could be subjected to unfair \ncompetition in an EU trade deal with the South American Mercosur states.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nBrussels has proposed a 100k (\u00a387,000) limit on payments to farmers under the next round of the CAP, due to be \nimplemented after the UK leaves the European Union.\n\nEU farmers will also be expected to implement more environmental measures in return for money \u2013 although not to \nthe extent proposed by Defra in the UK.\n\nSee also: Brussels leak points to \u00a352,000 aid cap for EU farmers\n\nEuropean farm commissioner Phil Hogan said the proposals delivered on the commission's commitment to \nmodernise and simplify the CAP.\n\nThey would ensure a more resilient agricultural sector in Europe while increasing the ambition of the CAP in relation \nto the environment and climate change, he said.\n\nAt the same time, the new CAP would ensure fair and better targeted support of farmers' income.\n\nAn earlier leak had suggested a cap of \u00a352,000.\n\nFormal proposals\n\n\n\nThe main features of the commission's formal proposals are:\n\n1. A new way of working Member states will have more flexibility in how to use their funding allocations, allowing \nthem to tailor programmes for farmers.\n\nMember states will also have the option to transfer up to 15% of their CAP allocations from direct payments (Pillar \nOne) to rural development (Pillar Two) and vice-versa.\n\n2. A fairer deal through better targeting of support Direct payments will remain a key part of the policy, the \ncommission says, ensuring stability and predictability for farmers.\n\nDirect payments will be reduced above 60,000 and capped for payments above 100,000 per farm in a bid to ensure \na fairer distribution of payments.\n\nSmall and medium-sized farms will receive a higher level of support per hectare. Countries will have to set aside at \nleast 2% of their direct payment allocation for new entrants\n\n3. Higher ambitions on environmental and climate action The new CAP will require farmers to achieve a higher level \nof ambition through both mandatory and incentive-based measures.\n\nEach member state will have to offer eco-schemes to support farmers who go beyond mandatory requirements, \nfunded with a share of their national direct payments allocations.\n\n4. Greater use of knowledge and innovation A budget of 10bn from the EU\u2019s Horizon Europe research programme \nwill be set aside for agricultural research and rural innovation projects.\n\nMember states will be encouraged to use big data and new technology to monitor farms and payments, reducing \nthe need for on-the-spot checks.\n\nThe new CAP is scheduled to take effect from the start of 2021 and will not apply to the UK, which is due to leave \nthe European Union on 29 March 2019.\n\nHowever, the UK will remain a de facto part of the CAP until the end of the Brexit implementation period, which is \ncurrently scheduled for December 2020.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA Scottish farm leader has accused Edinburgh City Council of having an \u201canti-meat agenda\u201d after it

Farmers Weekly\n\nFarm leaders have agreed a list of principles they want the government to put at the centre of post-Brexit agriculture \npolicy.\n\nRepresentatives from 15 UK farming organisations met on Friday (11 May) in Belfast for discussions on how policy \nshould be agreed among devolved nations.\n\nIn a statement, the organisations called on the four UK governments to respect and maintain the current devolution \nsettlement of policy and regulation to the constituent parts of the country.\n\nSee also: Foliar fertiliser could benefit farmers in post-Brexit world\n\n\u201cA guiding principle should be that no single country determines or curtails UK policy in the rest of the UK,\u201d it said.\n\nThe UK governments should take every step to retain and protect single market access for food, agricultural \ncommodities, live animals and plant and plant products throughout the UK, they added.\n\nIn developing distinct agricultural policies to replace the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), farm ministers across \nthe UK should ensure potential differences in application of agricultural policy do not adversely affect trade within \nthe UK. \n\nCommon frameworks\n\n\n\nMinisters should maintain common frameworks across a broad range of policy, including biotechnology, organic \nfarming, animal health \u2013 including the movement of animals and control of disease \u2013 maximum residues, minimum \nstandards on specific commodities, food labelling, plant protection products  and plant variety rights.\n\nBut the organisations said neither England, Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales should be allowed to develop rules \nor policy that threatens to curtail access for other parts of the UK to international markets.\n\nThe leaders welcomed the UK government\u2019s commitment to provide the same cash total in funds for farm support \nas is currently paid out under the CAP (Roughly \u00a33bn/year). \n\nBut in the longer term, with the development of a new domestic agricultural policy, at least the same level of money \nin agriculture should be ring-fenced, they insisted.\n\nThe meeting of the UK Farming Roundtable was chaired by NFU president Minette Batters.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nGovernment plans to phase out direct payments must be fair for all farms regardless of size \u2013 rather than targeting \nlarger recipients first, says the NFU.\n\nThe union made the recommendation in its response to Defra's Health and Harmony consultation on proposals to \nreform farm support after the UK leaves the European Union.\n\nThe consultation, which closes on Tuesday (8 May), is seen as a key opportunity for farmers to have their say on \nshaping the future of agriculture and the countryside.\n\nSee also:

invest, it adds.\n\nThe NFU says a future domestic agricultural policy should seek to maintain a level playing field across the UK and \nwith respect to the UK's main competitors\n\nDefra wants to replace direct payments with a new system of \u201cpublic money for public goods\u201d largely based on \nrewarding farmers who undertake environmental measures.\n\nPhasing out\n\nIt has proposed a transition period of five, seven or 10 years \u2013 including the gradual phasing out of direct payments, \npossibly from 2020.\n\nDefra has proposed three ways of phasing out payments \u2013 \u201cprogressive reductions\u201d for most farmers, a straight cap \non the maximum amount received or a combination of the two.\n\nThe NFU says future policy should ensure public investment in agriculture promotes productivity, while fairly \nrewarding environmental delivery and managing market volatility.\n\nAnd it warns: \u201cDirect payments are currently the most substantial and effective tool that farmers have to mitigate \nthis volatility.\n\n\u201cWhile farmers in the UK share the aspiration of reducing their reliance on these payments, it should not be \narbitrarily pursued without sufficient and robust policy replacements.\u201d\n\n\n\n'Significant role'\n\nThe NFU says direct payments will continue to play a significant role in underpinning the financial viability of many \nfarm businesses in the short to medium term.\n\nAnd it says any reduction in Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) payments should be fair and equitable for all farms, \nrather than focusing on larger recipients.\n\n\u201cIn our view this means the same percentage reduction should be applied to all recipients, regardless of claim size,\u201d \nsays the NFU response.\n\n\u201cThis redirection of funds must be to the direct benefit of active farmers whose businesses will be striving to \nmanage the impacts of the loss of income resulting from BPS reductions.\n\n\u201cThe scale

Snails are not present in all wet areas, as commonly assumed, and trained \nstaff are needed to identify potentially suitable habitats, find these tiny, elusive creatures and differentiate them from \nother non-fluke transmitting snails.\n\nSee also: A guide to managing fluke on your sheep farm\n\nHefin Williams, a lecturer in agricultural environment at the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences \n(Ibers) at Aberystwyth University says this process would be impractical on a national scale because it is costly and \ntime-consuming.\n\nHowever, an environmental test that detects mud snail DNA in water has been developed at Aberystwyth University \nand could be the solution.\n\nHow the test has been trialed on farms and the results\n\nDr Williams has been leading a joint study between Farming Connect and Ibers into the use of this test on Welsh \nfarms.\n\nDuring the project potential mud snail habitats were surveyed on five farms \u2013 one dairy and four beef and sheep.\n\nFarms were visited up to four times between May and October 2017, when wet habitats were repeatedly surveyed.\n\nWater from the habitats was filtered through DNA-capturing filters, which were then screened for the presence of \nmud snail. Meanwhile, livestock groups infected with liver fluke and rumen fluke were identified using faecal egg \ncounting (FEC).\n\nThe test identified mud snail DNA in each habitat where snails were physically detected and in other habitats where \nno snails were seen.\n\n\u201cThe test also picked up both liver fluke and rumen fluke DNA in mud snail habitats which is also promising as we \nlook to develop this test further in future and use it to assess fluke infection risk in fields,\u201d explains Dr Williams.\n\n\n\nUsing maps to identify risk\n\nEach of the farms was given a detailed map assessing fluke infection risk in each area.\n\nRhys Jones, who was involved in the research during his PhD, adds: \u201cIt\u2019s hoped these maps will assist farmers in \nmaking informed livestock management decisions in consultation with their vet to assist with fluke control.\n\n\u201cInterventions to reduce contact between livestock and fluke on pasture such as fencing and draining can be costly \nand being able to specify and prioritise which habitats pose the most immediate risk should be valuable information \nto manage fluke risk in the future, especially as the threat of anthelmintic resistance grows.\u201d\n\nOf the five farms involved in the latest research, some have since fenced off newly identified mud snail habitats \nfrom livestock, as well as adapting their fluke control programme to test livestock in the spring to ensure animals \nshedding fluke eggs on to mud snail habitats are identified via FEC testing and treated. \n\nFluke prevalence in Wales\n\nThis study comes two years after a team from the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences (Ibers) \nat Aberystwyth University  \u2013 a Farming Connect innovation site \u2013 published research on the prevalence of rumen \nfluke on Welsh farms.\n\nThat study, based on a survey of 100 farms, found:\n\n61% of farms sampled were positive for rumen fluke\n\n68% were positive for liver fluke\n\nAnd co-infection of both flukes was seen on 46% of farms \n\nOnly 17% were negative for both\n\nResearch Farm: Hafod Farm, Llandysu\n\nFarm facts\n\nSpring-calving herd of 140 Friesians and Norwegian Red crosses\n\nYielding an annual average of 5,000 litres at 3.50% protein and 4.15% butterfat\n\nMilk sold to Arla\n\nBoth liver and rumen fluke were detected at Hafod Farm near Llandysul, with levels of rumen fluke the highest \nrecorded by the research team.\n\nSix snail habitats were identified at this 49ha dairy farm, which Liam and Annie James farm in partnership with \nAnnie\u2019s father, Clive Lott.\n\nSnails in three of these habitats were infected with liver fluke and rumen fluke infection was detected in snails in two \nof the sites.\n\n\u201cGiven the number of snails seen in the habitats and the sizeable nature of these habitats it would be reasonable to \nconclude they pose a significant risk of infection to livestock grazing the surrounding areas,\u201d says Hefin Williams, a \nlecturer in agricultural environment at Ibers.\n\nThe family are in their fourth year of farming at Hafod and, although they are aware that poor drainage has resulted \nin some very wet areas, they were completely taken aback by the sampling results.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d had reports from the abattoir of liver fluke in a couple of cull cows, but we were completely unaware we had \nrumen fluke in the herd,\u201d says Mr James.\n\n\u201cLiver fluke and juvenile stages of rumen fluke can affect milk yield, but you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell by looking at a \ncow whether she was infected.\u201d\n\nThe study has been valuable on two counts. Instead of using a flukicide that treats only liver fluke, a product that \ncovers both rumen and liver fluke is now administered during the dry period.\n\nThe family is also able to prioritise which areas to drain and fence off from livestock.\n\n\u201cWe have put some temporary fencing up as a short-term measure,\u201d says Mrs James.\n\nThe farm has required a lot of investment, but she says this study has shown that fencing and drainage in certain \nhigh-risk areas must be a priority.\n\n\u201cIt is not going to be a magic fix, but the awareness and the changes we are putting in place should help.\u201d\n\nMr James says that dealing with the fluke issue should lift milk yields.\n\n\u201cGetting on top of the problem will require investment but some of the work should pay for itself if we can produce \nmore milk.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA dog owner stood by and watched as his out-of-control pet husky worried a flock of North of England Mules.\n\nShocked sheep farmer James McIntosh caught the dog attacking his sheep in a 4ha field at Pophleys Farm, near \nRadnage, Buckinghamshire, as he drove past in his Land Rover on Friday (4 May).\n\nMr McIntosh leapt out of his vehicle and ran to the aid of his sheep, who were being chased round in circles by a \nbrown husky dog.\n\nSee also:The law on shooting dogs \u2013 critical facts farmers must know\n\nAlthough he would have been within his rights to shoot the dog, Mr McIntosh was not carrying his shotgun at the \ntime of the incident.\n\nAs the unflustered dog owner stood by, Mr McIntosh spent several minutes trying to catch the dog. He eventually \ncornered the animal after began struggling for breath.\n\nSheep warning\n\nAt the entrance to the field, a home-made sign, made out of plywood, states: \u201cSheep. Please keep your dog on \nlead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are sheep all over our farm. The owner knows there are sheep there, but he still let his dog off its lead.\n\n\u201cHe was holding the lead. The dog had a harness on it, but the owner did nothing to try to stop it.\n\n\u201cHe never said sorry. The last owner whose dog we caught worrying sheep was devastated.\u201d\n\nOn this occasion, it appears that none of the 70 ewes and 70 lambs was physically injured. However, one three-\nweek-old lamb is displaying signs of stress.\n\nMr McIntosh described the dog owner as a respectable man, aged in his 50s.\n\n\n\n\u2018Weak excuses\u2019\n\nHe said the dog owner made \u201cweak excuses\u201d about the gate, but it couldn\u2019t have been more secure.\n\nHe told Mr McIntosh his dog ran ahead of him under a gate and then jumped over a stile. He thought that because \nthere were no sheep in the field last time it would be empty.\n\nMr McIntosh has reported the incident to police to investigate to see if he is liable for any compensation, or if any \naction should be taken against the owner.\n\n\u201cLuckily the lambs are all three to four weeks old. But if they had been a couple of weeks old, it could have been \nreally bad,\u201d said Mr McIntosh.\n\n\u201cDespite so many public awareness campaigns on sheep worrying, I think some dog owners are disconnected. \nThey are not involved with the farm. They are so delusional.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA Staffordshire farmer in dispute with Natural England over a joint Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) agreement has \ntaken his case to the parliamentary ombudsman.\n\nTenant Ian Sadler, who farms at Hill Farm, Kinver, near Stourbridge, says he entered into a 10-year HLS \nagreement jointly with his landlord, the National Trust. Starting in 2007, the agreement was to restore and enhance \nthe trust\u2019s land at nearby Kinver Edge.\n\nThe HLS agreement followed the conclusion of an earlier five-year Countryside Stewardship scheme which had \nsuccessfully controlled ragwort, rabbits and moles on the same land. The CSS agreement included five years of \nDefra trials to enhance light, sandy heathland.\n\nSee also: Extra month for Countryside Stewardship payment applications\n\n\u201cThe Countryside Stewardship Scheme ticked every box under the sun,\u201d said Mr Sadler. It was so successful that \nhe established his own small herd of pedigree beef shorthorns to graze the land \u2013 accompanied with a farm shop \nselling rare-breed beef and lamb.\n\n\u201cWe cleaned the ground up, got rid of the ragwort and knitted a sward. The fescues came and the wildflowers and \nwe got some fertility back in the soil, building up the structure. It was all working well. We developed our business \naround stewardship.\u201d\n\nAfter the former Countryside Stewardship Scheme came to a close in 2007, Mr Sadler says he as tenant and the \ntrust as landlord agreed a joint 10-year HLS programme \u2013 with his own name jointly on the agreement. Everything \nwent well, he says, until 2012 when he and the trust fell out.\n\nParliamentary ombudsman\n\nAfter initially undertaking stewardship on the land in return for \u00a31,640  year, Mr Sadler claims locks were put on \ngates preventing him from accessing 20ha. He also claims his name was taken off the HLS agreement and no \nfurther stewardship was carried out.\n\nMr Sadler said he took his case to the parliamentary ombudsman after trying but failing to get his name reinstated \non the agreement. Natural England should have ensured that the original joint agreement was honoured, he added.\n\nThe National Trust said the stewardship agreement was with Natural England \u2013 and it was flourishing.\n\nIt said Mr Sadler had not been a party to the agreement at any point, but had worked in close partnership with the \ntrust to manage some of the land and had a farm business tenancy. The trust said: \u201cRegrettably, our working \n\n\n\nrelationship with Mr Sadler broke down after we raised concerns that he was not managing the land in line with our \nconservation aims. We met Mr Sadler many times to informally discuss the situation but we were unable to reach \nagreement.\n\n\u201cEventually, as a last resort, we took legal action to end his occupation of the land covered by his tenancy. We\u2019ve \nbeen speaking to Mr Sadler throughout and are happy to attend any meetings arranged with Natural England to \ndiscuss this matter further.\u201d\n\nA Defra spokesperson for Natural England said: \u201cThis case is currently being reviewed by the parliamentary \nombudsman. We don\u2019t comment on ongoing cases.\u201d\n\nThe parliamentary ombudsman is expected to reach a decision in due course.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA South West egg producer is facing jail after admitting conning his customers into buying eggs incorrectly \nclassified as free range.\n\nJames Gigg, from Yetminster, Dorset, admitted to a fraud originally estimated at about \u00a3230,000.\n\nBut on Monday (18 June) Taunton Crown Court was told the fraud\u2019s final value had to be determined before the 41-\nyear old could be sentenced.\n\nSee also: A guide to good egg marketing\n\nMr Gigg previously admitted three offences, which can carry a three-year jail term.\n\nOne was that between November 2015 and January 2017 he made a false representation, selling eggs to the \nTraditional Free Range Egg Company which were incorrectly classed as free range.\n\nHe also admitted furnishing false information in relation to egg production records and sales, which did not reflect \nthe actual figures achieved.\n\nAnd he pleaded guilty to marketing eggs as \u201cclass A free range\u201d from 5,500 hens in house one and 8,500 hens in \nhouse two, when the maximum permitted number of hens in each house was 4,000 and 6,500 respectively.\n\nFinancial gains\n\nAt Taunton Crown Court, judge David Evans was told the \u00a3230,000 figure was based on the premise all these eggs \nwere effectively sold illegally.\n\nBut Mr Grigg\u2019s lawyers said the farmer strenuously disputes the financial gains he has made, pointing out \u00a3230,000 \nwas the gross turnover of his farm, not the profit from the eggs.\n\nHis defence team argued the value of the fraud was \u00a386,700.\n\nJudge Evans told Mr Gigg he could not sentence him on \u201ca mistaken basis\u201d and the \u201cvalue of the fraud has to be \ndecided\u201d before sentencing next month.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nBoth calving and lambing are going well, helped in no small part by the sun coming out and the end of the \nceaseless rain falling from the sky.\n\nDespite the sun shining, the temperatures are nothing special and gloves and hats are still part of the daily \nwardrobe.\n\n\n\nToday has been a big day on the calving front, with eight calved already as I write this (1 May). \n\nAll the improved ground and reseeds have good covers of more than 1,500 kg/ha DM, but the old rigg and furrow \npastures have only 1,100 kg/ha DM. This is just about OK for the singles to lamb down on to.\n\nSee also: Cold, wet spring conspires against farmers\n\nWe are doing some work with our vets and the vets at the University of Edinburgh blood-testing cows and calves, \nlooking at the transfer of passive immunity from cow to calf through maternal colostrum.\n\nBlood samples were taken pre-calving from the cows and energy balance, body condition, protein status and \nmineral status were investigated.\n\nAll levels were good except for protein, so we added 1kg of a 28% protein pellet to the ration pre-calving which has \ncorrected any protein deficit.\n\nCows are calving well. We are on target for 65% calving in 21 days, with no retained cleansings. Colostrum/milk \nproduction is good and calves have plenty of get up and go.\n\nIn terms of a British agriculture policy post-Brexit, there are many instances of public money for public goods in the \nuplands: water, wildlife, biodiversity, carbon capture and tourism to name but a few. For years farmers have been \ndelivering public goods without it always being recognised. \n\nHow do you put a value on the benefits we deliver when previously they have been taken for granted?  \n\nThe challenge is getting from where we are now to the future environmental schemes without massive holes in farm \ncashflows.\n\nI think Gove et al may have to frontload the new scheme in the early years as the BPS reduces and we adjust to the \nnew structure, or there could be a significant number of casualties. \n\nSimon Bainbridge farms a 650ha upland organic farm with 160 suckler cows, 1,500 breeding ewes and 12,000 \norganic laying hens with his wife, Claire, and his parents. Healthy, maternal livestock and quality feed is a priority.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nIn May, I did an interview with BBC Radio Gloucestershire about the feral boar population in the Forest of Dean and \nwhat it means in terms of the threat African swine fever (ASF) poses to the UK. \n\nASF hasn\u2019t been seen in the UK before, but it is a notifiable disease that often causes 100% fatality.\n\nRecently it has spread west from Russia and Georgia at an alarming rate as far as Poland, the Czech Republic and \nHungary.\n\nWild boar and possibly the illegal movement of infected pigs or feeding of infected pork/pork products have been \nspreading it.\n\nAs an island we are protected somewhat, but the disease can be transmitted easily in pork products and on vehicle \nwheels or clothes. \n\nSee also: Guide to biosecurity measures to keep pigs disease-free\n\nThe population of \u201cwild\u201d boar in the Forest of Dean is thought to be well in excess of 1,000 and is principally a \ncross-breed of a more commercial pig and wild boar.\n\nFeral boar having access to BBQ meat and leftover picnics is a major concern in tourist areas.  \n\n\n\nAn outbreak of ASF in the UK would be devastating \u2013 not only for the farms affected, but to the UK pig industry as a \nwhole. \n\nThe UK pork export market, which is worth \u00a3345m, would be shut down immediately. Last time we had a classical \nswine fever outbreak it took 10 years for China - our second-largest export market - to let us back in.\n\nIt would probably be easier to get back into the EU, but after Brexit, who knows? Also, to get back into these export \nmarkets we have to be able to prove we are free from ASF. If ASF is circulating in feral wild boar, this could be \nimpossible.\n\nThe NPA has been collaborating with Mark Harper MP (Forest of Dean) and the Deer Initiative to present a case to \nthe AHDB for co-funding for a dedicated resource; possibly in conjunction with the Forestry Commission, to provide \na co-ordinated effort to reduce the feral boar population to more manageable levels that do not facilitate the easy \nharbourage of disease.\n\nBeing less than 20 miles from the Forest of Dean, this is a real concern for us and other pig farmers in the area.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nShortly after I wrote my last column we set a new farm record for numbers born alive. The JSR 400 terminal sire \naveraged 15.43 across 88 sows.\n\nSince our first farrowing on the batch system in January 2017, we have averaged 14.41 born alive on the Hermitage \nMaxgrow and the JSR 400 terminal sires.\n\nThis is up 1.2 piglets a litter on the weekly system in 2016 across the PIC 337, Maxgrow and the JSR 400. Genetic \nimprovement must play a part, but it was such a step-change after switching to batching that we feel the good \nresults must be down to the focus of labour on one task at a time.\n\nIt prompted me to look back a decade to 2008 - our average born alive for was 11.97.\n\nSee also: Deadline nears for recording antibiotics use on eMB-Pigs\n\nAlthough these high numbers are fantastic, they have also caused a few headaches. We have had to sell 150 \npiglets at weaning and it is likely we will have to send a significant number as pork and cutter-weight pigs, as we \ndon\u2019t have the finishing space to take them through to bacon weight, particularly through the summer months, when \nwe like to stock a little lighter.\n\nAs these higher numbers look set to stay, we have been forced to think about what we do to manage this. It looks \nas though, in the short term, our only option is to farrow fewer sows per batch, but this pains me.\n\nWhere to invest\n\nWe have been talking about investment on the pig farm for some time now, and it\u2019s come to crunch. However, it\u2019s \njust a case of deciding where to start. Our dry sow housing and feeding system is antiquated.\n\nOur farrowing house is labour intensive and hours could be saved here with upgrades to the flooring. And our \nfinishing accommodation is perfectly adequate, but we just don\u2019t have enough space anymore.\n\nInvesting in more finishing space would bring the fastest return on investment, but if our current dry sow housing \ndoesn\u2019t perform, it\u2019s not much use if we don\u2019t have the pigs to fill it.\n\nThe Pig and Poultry Fair couldn\u2019t come at a better time and I\u2019m hoping to come away with some firm decisions on \nhow to proceed.\n\n\n\nSophie Hope, Cheltenham, farms 380 sows indoors from farrow to finish, producing 10,000 pigs a year direct to \nTesco, as well as 81,000 broiler-breeders. A straw-based system is currently in place with boars from composite \ncommercial lines and some Hampshire used for hardiness.  \n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nI wonder if blackgrass should become a swear word, certainly I often precede it with one. As usual, just as I am \npreparing to head off to the Cereals event thinking I\u2019ve dealt with it, some more late comers appear.\n\nI go for the research and \u201cenjoyed\u201d hearing from Rothamsted about how mixing active ingredients does not help if \nthe blackguard has metabolic resistance to herbicides.\n\nOf more hope were the various ideas they were investigating to control it, such as genetic techniques, germination \nstimulants, biological control, UV and heat.\n\nSee also: How to use integrated methods to control blackgrass\n\nThe new long-term experiment they have set up looking at different cultivations, rotations and fertiliser sources \ncould be very useful.\n\nCrop ancestry\n\nAt the Assist stand I saw a programme that models changes in such things as soil carbon, pollinator richness and \ncalories produced for changes in cropping intensity.\n\nAt a brief glance, upping cropped area seems to show the familiar idea of increasing calories but decreasing \npollinator richness, for instance. But other research I found there suggests that we can have wildlife-friendly farming \nand increase crop output.\n\nWork being done at NIAB on improving nitrogen use efficiency and the root architecture of wheat, and at the \nUniversity of Essex on increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis and water use, would compliment this.\n\nAt the JHI stand they described their attempts to build the malting characteristics of spring barley into winter \nvarieties and showed me a fascinating crop ancestry tool that depicts the family tree of current varieties.\n\nI will have a look at this to see if I can find Napier or Istabraq in any parentage, because these have anecdotally \nbeen good in no-till situations \u2013 perhaps they could feature it in AHDB Recommended Lists?\n\nWhat really frustrates me is that much of this work relies on BBSRC funding, who, in turn, rely on scientific papers \npublished as a measure of success.\n\nIn fact, knowledge transfer to farmers is often held up as papers wait to be accepted! What on earth is the point if \nresearch never makes it to the field?\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe calving period has nearly finished. As I write this (23 May), we have two heifers and a cow left to calve.\n\nI was a bit wary this year, as in the past I used semen that was selected for calving ease. This year we purchased a \nWelsh Black bull to run with the herd.\n\nHe did an excellent job. All cows are in calf and all within six weeks. We haven\u2019t had any major issues; one \nassisted, one set of twins and one poorly cow.\n\nAll are out grazing now and making the most of the sunshine. The only negative is the high number of bull calves, \nwhich won't help me increase herd numbers.\n\n\n\nSee also: How to set up rotational grazing on your beef farm\n\nIt's also time for eight-week weights to be taken on the nucleus lambs. We did this on the weekend and it was \npleasing to see.\n\nIwan has done tremendously and all the lambs were looking sharp and healthy. The single average weight was \n24.5kg and the twins averaged 21.3kg.\n\nThese figures are slightly up on last year, but I won\u2019t tell Iwan that, as we are both rather competitive.\n\nThis small difference in lamb weights reinforces the importance of increasing prolificacy within the flock and \nweaning a high percentage.\n\nDue to the decrease in numbers, the singles aren\u2019t following the twins, but rather grazing their own block, with cattle \nfloating between both mobs to help control pastures. Additional silage will also be cut this year to help manage the \ndecrease in numbers.\n\nIt is great to share photos and videos with our customers in the shop and via social media. At this time of year we \nare selling new-season lamb, hogget and mutton. This has people intrigued and they are eager to sample all to \ncompare taste and texture.\n\nThe one restricting factor in the butchery industry is staff. This is most definitely having an effect on our business at \nthe moment.\n\nWe are looking for enthusiastic, hard-working and experienced butchers and an apprentice. If anyone reading this is \nlooking for a new challenge, please get in touch. @ShaunHallJones\n\nShaun Hall Jones and his father Barrie farm 1,000 ewes, including an Abermax nucleus flock, and 40 Welsh Black \ncattle across 364ha near Llanybydder, Carmarthenshire.

With the dry \nweather set to continue, I am taking the opportunity to keep fungicide and growth regulator rates at the lower end of \nthe scale, making some savings from the dry weather.\n\nI am sure oilseed rape flowering will finish quite quickly, so a second flowering spray is not going to be required.\n\nSee also: T3 spray tips for battling ear blight in wheat\n\nGovernment proposals on organic manure storage and application in the future are a concern. While injecting slurry \nmakes a lot of sense, the proposals for solid manure seem less well thought out.\n\nStoring it undercover in sheds is not realistic on a large scale with spread-out fields and I don\u2019t relish trying to cover \nfield heaps in plastic, which will inevitably start to get blown around the countryside.\n\nMuckspreading and ploughing\n\n\n\nDepending on the definition of bare land, incorporation within 12 hours of application is a potential issue where we \nare applying to stubble ahead of ploughing. The difference in output between muckspreading and ploughing could \ncause some headaches, with spreading contractors in demand only for the first three hours each morning.\n\nI think there will be much discussion to come on this and hopefully some common sense applied to avoid \nunintended consequences that outweigh any potential benefits.\n\nIf the past few years are a guide, the fact that we are getting ready for silage-making is sure to bring a change in the \nweather. I hope we get just the right amount of rain to keep the crops going, but not a return to a bit of rain every \nday like we had earlier in the year.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nAnother bank holiday wash-out brought some fantastic rain. Now we\u2019re basking in 20C sun again and grass growth \non the platform will be out of control.\n\nIt's a reminder that in the UK and Ireland we have a huge comparative advantage over most of the world. Our ability \nto grown and use the cheapest form of feed available to us (grass) allows us to develop sustainable business \nmodels capable of surviving price volatility and political changes.  \n\nFurthermore, in its simplest form, using grazed grass can be achieved with the smallest amount of capital outlay, \nproviding the foundation for young farmers and new entrants to establish their businesses and grow their equity in \nstock.\n\nSee also: How to set up rotational grazing on your beef farm\n\nWhy make it complex?\n\n\u201cLife is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated\u201d rings too true in so many circumstances. Expensive \nmachinery, sheds and show-winning cattle create an expensive smoke screen to mask what is growing - or not \ngrowing - in the grazing and silage fields surrounding us.\n\nEven at fantastic events such as Welsh Grassland, how many potential young farmers gawked at \u00a3100,000-plus \nset-ups going up and down the field, yet walked right past the grass-breeding stands and trial plots?\n\nI was guilty of all of the above before changing my approach to grass management. My point is that if all you see to \nstarting up with your own stock ownership is barriers, or if Brexit, subsidies or potential cheap imports keep you \nawake at night, ask yourself if you are maximising the comparative advantage handed to us.\n\nPleased with submission rates\n\nOn the farm we are four weeks into AI, with about a week to go. We had a pleasing submission rate of 90% in the \nfirst three weeks and things have really quietened down now, which is promising. \n\nGrass growth is good, with some surplus taken off the platform and first-cut silage finished on the support ground.\n\nThis month we say goodbye to Pete, who is returning to Ireland to take on the management of a 240-cow herd. I am \nvery grateful for the hard work he has put into the farm for the last two seasons and wish him all the very best for \nthe future.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nIs any crop better than no crop?

The farm also runs a large beef fattening unit.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nWe have had a cool, wet autumn where I farm in South Africa. The wet weather has made harvesting soya beans \na challenge but it is good for my cover crops. \n\nI recently finished my soya so now I can turn my attention to dry beans (pinto beans). Harvesting dry beans can be \na challenge, but if done correctly it can be very lucrative. \n\nSee also: Spring beans outperform oilseed rape on heavy Essex land\n\nYou get many varieties of beans. The older types don\u2019t stand very well, with a high percentage of their pods on the \nground, which is disastrous if you get late rain. \n\n\n\nMany pods will rot and many of the individual beans will discolour from water stain. Fortunately, I grow a variety that \nstands, although that is a bit of a misnomer as many of the pods still touch the ground. \n\nHarvesting by hand\n\nPlanting was about two weeks later than I would have liked, but this has turned out to be a good thing as the beans \nwere still green when conditions were very wet. \n\nNow that the weather has dried off, my beans are ready to harvest, which is an interesting exercise. I don\u2019t grow \nenough to warrant a windrowing machine, so I windrow them by hand. \n\nUnemployment is very high in South Africa so it is possible to get a team of about 80 people to pull the beans. \n\nThe plants have a very weak root system and are pulled out of the ground and placed in a windrow. A combine then \npicks up the rows to thresh the beans. \n\nAs the beans are very susceptible to splitting, it is better to avoid augers and if one must use an auger, then run it \nslowly. \n\nThe beans are sieved and sorted, then packed into 4kg bags for retail. Large portions of these bags are \ntransparent, making every blemish noticeable, so it is imperative to have a high quality product.\n\nBruce Shepherd farms in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.

The countryside and nature is at its most \nbeautiful and many days are spent in awe of the wonderful wee world we live in \u2013 life is good.\n\nThe rotations have been shortened to try and maintain grass quality. Swedes and fodder beet have been sown. \nKale and swift will be sown and bales will be placed in the winter fields in the next week.\n\nI had two very enjoyable and inspirational days away this month. The first was a day with our Quality Meat Scotland \n(QMS) grazing group.\n\nSee also: How to set up rotational grazing on your beef farm\n\nWe visited one of the organic farms within the group and, as always, the discussions left my head spinning with an \ninformation overload.\n\nThe second day was a sheep meeting on a friend\u2019s farm. I love going to there because, being the outstanding \nyoung farmer my friend is, you always leave inspired.\n\nThe attention to detail he and his stockman have is incredible and he makes all his decisions based on information \nthat he collects and records continuously.\n\nI keep the annual QMS benchmarking book on my desk and regularly use it to compare my sheep figures and \nmostly I end up with a feeling of despair. But at least it gives me a target.\n\nWhen I started paddock grazing my fattening cattle the locals all thought I was mad. When I told them (and lots of \n\u201cexperts\u201d) about seeing cattle in New Zealand doing 2-3kg daily liveweight gain (DLWG) in this system the \nreply was always: \u201cAh but that\u2019s New Zealand.\u201d And that was even from the \u201cexperts\u201d.\n\nInterestingly, there are lots of people paddock grazing now \u2013 even the \u201cexperts\u201d think it\u2019s a great idea.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s still surprising how few people monitor DLWG\u2019s \u2013 it comes back to the old adage \u201cyou can\u2019t manage what you \ndon\u2019t measure\u201d.\n\nIn the Damn Delicious shop Michelle has introduced fresh hot pies and sandwiches and they are proving very \npopular.\n\nShe has also introduced lots of new heavily discounted packs which everyone seems to love.

We have also direct-drilled some grass seeds into \nswards sprayed with glyphosate.\n\nThe contractors are under pressure, with three months' work to do in a month, as muckspreading, maize planting \nand first-cut silage are all overlapping this year.\n\nAt short notice we had a Glastir agri-environment scheme capital works inspection, which prompted some panic \nand a couple of hastily finished fencing jobs. Thankfully we passed with no penalties.\n\nI spent a day helping with the \u201cCows on tour\u201d at Marshfield Primary School just outside Cardiff. Abi Reader started \nthis initiative a few years ago to try to educate school children about where their food comes from.\n\nSee also: How to feed dry cows to prevent negative protein balance\n\nIt involves taking the farm to the school, with sheep, chickens, a cow and a tractor.

They arrived just in time to see the \nlast part of morning milking.\n\nOne visit included a lady from the US, who had just placed a significant order of goat's cheese. Hopefully we can be \none of the few sectors of British agriculture to benefit from Brexit, as most of the new markets for goat\u2019s cheese are \noutside the EU.\n\nThe Boer-cross kids are just starting to be born and are noticeably meatier than the dairy kids.\n\nA local goatmeat farmer was featured on a BBC TV show recently and following the programme, their website was \ninundated with orders for goat meat.

They \nalso own a small pedigree Welsh Black suckler herd to graze permanent pasture.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nShearing season has been pretty easy to manage so far, as the weather has been on our side and not held us up \ntoo much, which is good.\n\nHowever, jobs out and about on the farm are starting to stack up. One of the jobs I\u2019m relieved I didn\u2019t have the time \nto race into was subsoiling.\n\n\n\nSome of the jobs done early seem to be drying out with all this hot weather so we are aiming to get stuck into that \nsometime in August.

I use it to \neducate them a little and they all seem to love coming around the deer and seeing the new arrivals and can\u2019t quite \nbelieve the stags grow massive antlers every year.\n\nI\u2019m also really pleased with how well this year\u2019s yearlings are going as we have nearly reached weights we were \nhoping to get to by October, so slowly things are getting better but there\u2019s still a lot to learn.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThis is my final Farmer Focus article. In the two-and-a-half years I have been writing a lot has changed on all fronts.\n\nThe biggest issues for British farmers in that time have been the uncertainty of Brexit and the resulting repatriation \nof agricultural policy.\n\nWhen I started this column, the biggest issues in the goat milk sector were undersupply and recruitment of new \nsuppliers.\n\nSee also: 6 top tips for getting into milking goats\n\nBack then I warned it was a niche market. Now we have quotas, price cuts and new producers losing their milk \ncontracts. The milk price cut is now starting to bite reducing our income significantly.\n\nI have also become more involved with NFU Cymru and done some media work to help get the farming message \nacross. I have seen the huge amount of work done for the members by the staff and office holders in the NFU.\n\nOn the farm we have taken on some more land on a short-term farm business tenancy, but haven\u2019t significantly \nincreased goat numbers.\n\nWe have, after a long, drawn-out process, obtained planning permission for a new dwelling with an agricultural tie.\n\nIn the future, we are looking at a new enterprise to spread the risk, although milking is so relentless we have \ndiscounted taking on any new species of animal.\n\nThere may be some opportunities for some share farming or contract farming in the locality, as landowners look to \nprotect themselves from potential inheritance tax changes.\n\n\n\nThe children are growing up fast, with Tommy playing cricket for school, club and county and Megan busy with her \npony.\n\nIt is often hard to find the time to watch them. There will always be farming jobs that need doing, but the children will \nsoon be grown up and gone so we need to find the time.\n\nOver all, I have enjoyed writing the column and thank Jess for doing the proof reading. It is surprising who reads \nFarmers Weekly, accountants, bank managers, farmers in France and lots of others that you wouldn\u2019t expect to.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nAt last, in the second week of May, spring has finally sprung in Lanarkshire.\n\nSwallows have returned, grass is virtually jumping out of the ground, lambs are skipping, the cattle are into their \nrotation and I finished rolling the undersown arable silage today.\n\nAll is well with the world and the farmer is a lot happier.\n\nFive ewes are left to lamb, but on the whole I would say it hasn\u2019t been too bad. However, I won't really know before \nI do a proper first count.\n\nAfter the winter, it is time - while things are still fresh in the mind - to look back and try to get a grasp on where I \ncould improve things.\n\nThe saying: \u201cGrant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, \nand the wisdom to know the difference\u201d comes to mind.\n\nSee also: 9 steps to getting a spring reseed right\n\nI was very disappointed in my cattle performance during the winter. The weight gain of outside groups was static at \nbest and this was mainly down to a lack of feed.\n\nWe had a very prolonged period of hard frost midwinter that hammered all my fodder crops. This is the second time \nthis has happened to me, so this year, in addition to my swift, kale and fodder beet, I am sowing some swedes as \nan insurance policy.\n\nI also feel the animals would benefit from more protein in the diet, so I have gone back to an arable silage mix that \nincludes peas rather than a pure stand of barley for my wholecrop.\n\nI have added red clover to my undersown grass seed, in hope of two outcomes: more protein in my silage and \naftermaths to provide me with a crop of \u201crocket fuel\u201d for finishing lambs.\n\nI have also set myself the target of having all lambs off the farm by 1 November - hopefully all the new Suffolk and \nHampshire Down lambs will help.\n\nThe shop is going through a major transition, with my wife, Michelle, planning and developing lots of new products. \nFrom the end of May we will be offering a take-away service of our own hot pies and rolls, made with our home-\ncooked meats. \n\nMichael Shannon finishes 150 head of mostly Angus beef stores each year and runs 280 Scotch Mules on a 100ha \nforage-only enterprise, as well as free-range turkeys for Christmas, near Biggar, Lanarkshire. Meat is sold through \nhis online business and farm shop Damn Delicious, with surpluses sold deadweight.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\n\n\nFollowing recent rainfall our crops have all switched to \u201cfast forward\u201d and, helped by the warm temperatures, have \nraced through growth stages. We are now back on track for a respectable harvest.\n\nCurrently my favourite wheat crops are the variety Graham, although the Montana also looks promising.\n\nI recently organised a farming study tour to Kent, the Garden of England.\n\nThis county has so much to offer and we saw unfamiliar crops such as hops, asparagus and lavender being grown \nsuccessfully, and met farmers thinking \u201coutside the box\u201d to stay one step ahead.\n\nSee also: Gove\u2019s new farm pollution controls: The details and reaction\n\nEveryone returned home with fresh ideas. Study tours are a great way to enjoy a short break with the added benefit \nof being a legitimate tax-allowable expense! In these times of impending change there is a great deal to learn from \neach other.\n\nEncouraging wildlife\n\nMy personal highlight of the trip was a visit to the Elmley National Nature Reserve on the Isle of Sheppey.\n\nThis family-run farm thinks of wildlife as being their \u201ccrop\u201d. Using a combination of advanced habitat enhancement, \nrobust predator control and balanced livestock grazing they have created a stunning environmental landscape.\n\nThe reserve was teeming with lapwing and redshank fledglings, among other rare species. Elmley told a really \ninspirational story and the inference was obvious: if you want a conservation project run properly, ask a farmer to do \nit!\n\nSoft targets\n\nThe Defra Clean Air strategy 2018 is yet another consultation clearly picking on agriculture as a soft target.\n\nDespite ammonia emissions having fallen 13% between 1980 and 2015, farming is faced with draconian proposals \nsuch as manure covers and decreased fertiliser limits, with special measures inflicted on dairy herds of more than \n150 cows.\n\nOther industry and transport sectors are largely overlooked or given much longer timescales to work with. Farming \nbodies need to come together in unity to challenge these unreasonable ideas.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nAs a pro-Brexiteer, I must say I am becoming disillusioned and pretty disgusted at the direction (if any) we are \nheaded.\n\nThe first thing we need is no MP holidays this summer and no parliamentary recess, as there are far too many \nissues that need addressing before March 2019.\n\nOver-regulation was the number one reason for me wanting to leave the EU and Michael Gove said once we left, \nthe amount of rules and regulations would fall. However, it\u2019s now looking like there will be more red tape in every \nsector.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear our food standards must remain similar to the EU to continue trade.\n\nSee also: Analysis: Hard Brexit best for UK milk prices\n\nI would have been a supporter for a \u201chard\u201d Brexit and being free from the customs union, but I don\u2019t trust trade \nminister Liam Fox at all \u2013 he would give away anything just to grab a deal.\n\n\n\nI have very little faith in the two big Scottish players (Gove and Fox). The Scottish National Party walking out of \nparliament the way they did is not the way to gain support south of the border. \n\nSwedish farmers have some of the highest welfare standards in the world, which their consumers seemingly \ndemanded. Sweden became 90% self-sufficient in food.\n\nThey were told if they joined the EU, demand for their produce would increase. However, in stark contrast, their own \nconsumers began to enjoy cheaper imported food from other EU countries and now Sweden\u2019s self-sufficiency has \ndropped to 50%, while no other EU consumers are willing to pay extra.\n\nMy fear is, if we open our gates to the rest of the world with zero protection, our self-sufficiency could easily drop \nfrom 62% to maybe 40%, which would be a disaster.\n\nMr Gove \u2013 who we met again at this year\u2019s Royal Highland Show \u2013 is quoted as saying \u201cover my dead body\u201d when \nquestioned about the threat of low-quality imports \u2013 tell me, what\u2019s the average lifespan of a controversial MP?\n\nIt\u2019s clear we need clarity now to plan our future. Too many farms are either cutting back or in maintenance mode \nwhere investment needs to happen as soon as possible.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThis must be d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u2013 35 days later and I am writing about silaging again.\n\nAdmittedly, we are looking to push the multicut system, but none of us envisaged literally waiting for the nitrogen \nlevels to drop.\n\nOn the whole, the crops have been ready to go since the beginning of the week. The month of May has been \nmadness, with the farm growing at an extraordinary pace - nettles and all.\n\nGround conditions meant getting the maize in needed to be a very patient affair. The stubble ploughed over very \nwet, and it even meant I spent a weekend bouncing around on the sumo.\n\nSee also: 6-step guide to successful maize establishment\n\nAll things considered, 18.2ha went in before the second bank holiday weekend, into a cobblier-than-hoped-for seed-\nbed. Since then the weather has been perfect, with warmth, rain and sun in equal measures.\n\nDespite my concerns, given the lateness and initial conditions, the crop is up and growing nicely. Long may it \ncontinue.\n\nThis month has also seen 95 low-yielders go out to graze. Given the spring, it was definitely the right call to delay \nturnout until after first cut.\n\nAlthough they are eating grass well, with limited buffer fed they have been a little restless and the milk has taken a \ntumble. This will be something we have to review in the next few weeks.\n\nWe have also taken Muller up on the option to fix up to 50% of our milk at 28p/litre through the deal they signed with \nLidl. We gave it a lot of thought and consideration and in the end signed the three-year option.\n\nWe think it is a sensible move given the previous four years, and should help to put some stability into our cashflow \nand forecasting. However, there is always that what if.\n\nWith it being based on last year's lowest month and our expansion it only equates to 35% of our milk in real terms \ntoday, but a positive nonetheless.\n\n\n\nMy fiance has left for Dublin on her hen do this morning. Not sure whether my stag will be starting with eggs \nBenedict and a glass of fizz.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nWhat a difference a prolonged spell of dry weather makes to the farm and, indeed, my mood.\n\nI don\u2019t think I have ever known crops to go through their growth stages so quickly, so we have been very busy trying \nto keep up.\n\nHowever, we made it and crops are looking reasonably well - apart from my oilseed rape, which is thin and patchy, \nmainly due to excessive wet weather since drilling.\n\nSee also: Read more from our arable Farmer Focus writers\n\nSpring crops went in much later than I would have liked, but they seem to have hit the ground running and I am now \nfeeling more positive about their prospects.\n\nAll this emphasises just how dependent our industry is on settled weather - I wonder if we can build that into our \nnew agriculture policy?\n\nOn the lookout\n\nI am writing this just before departing for Cereals 2018. It will be interesting to see how the event will have changed \nor improved under new management.\n\nIt will also be interesting to hear others\u2019 views on how they think our industry will change after Brexit and how they \nwill meet those challenges and opportunities.\n\nI plan to use the show to learn, and hopefully discover new ideas and management approaches to make my \nbusiness more competitive.\n\nHowever, I am also aware that it is a huge shop window for machinery. This leaves me in a bit of a quandary as \nright now I am in the - maybe - enviable position that I own outright every piece of kit on the farm.\n\nThe problem is that, like me, it is all getting old and somewhat worn, it won\u2019t last forever and will need replacing at \nsome stage.\n\nDo I want to spend hard-earned money on some shiny new machine while entering somewhat uncertain times?\n\nOn the other hand, new machines can sometimes make a business more competitive, so that is the dilemma we all \nhave to face and the solution will often be different according to each individual business.\n\nMaybe I'll take the credit card anyway - but leave it in the car.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nI'm back from two days at the British Pig & Poultry Fair in Stoneleigh. This biennial event is well attended by \nproducers.\n\nThere was a really positive feeling from everyone I spoke to. Sure, feed prices are rising, bedding is expensive and \nthere are health challenges out there, but trade stands seemed busy.\n\nMany of us were maybe window shopping, as it costs a lot of money to replace old, worn-out buildings and \nequipment.\n\n\n\nThe first day I spent catching up with old mates, often over a few beers, which those kind people in the allied trades \nkept thrusting into our hands.\n\nSee also: Guide to biosecurity measures to keep pigs disease-free\n\nIn the evening, my daughter Katy and I had a few more beers with a couple of Scottish poultry men, who I seem to \nremember were equally positive about the poultry sector, though things were getting a bit hazy by this time.\n\nAHDB Pork strategy director Mick Sloyan was equally positive about the British pig industry.\n\nHe patted us pig producers on the back for reducing antibiotics use by 28% in just one year. I was also surprised to \nlearn from his forum talk that in 2017 the value of British pork exported to China was double the value of Scotch \nwhisky exported there.\n\nThe second day there seemed significantly fewer people in the pig hall, but the poultry hall seemed equally as busy \nas the first day.\n\nNext month is the 134th Lincolnshire Show (20-21 June). The piggery's longest-serving employee will be receiving \nhis 40-year medal at the show's awards.\n\nI usually take the lads from the piggery for a jolly to Market Rasen races in the summer, but I think we should have \nit at the show this year to mark our colleague's award.\n\nI added up the total years the six of us have put in at the piggery - it comes to 144. Divided by six that equals 24 \nyears each.\n\nI know it is a struggle for some farmers to retain staff. Perhaps someone at AHDB should be looking into staff \nretention?\n\nKeeping antibiotics use to a minimum is a key aim for David Owers on the 700-sow indoor closed unit he manages \nin Lincolnshire. He sells half of the progeny as 8kg weaned pigs and rears the rest to bacon weight (105kg). The \nfarm includes horses, cattle, 1,620ha of arable land and an AD unit.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nLambing is largely finished. The ewes were remarkable, especially one group of 100-odd ewes that became \nstranded on an island for almost two weeks when the water level rose and washed away my sheep bridge.\n\nThe weather broke and we got a reprieve \u2013 for a few days we even managed to drive across fields. In the latter half \nof the month the weather closed back in just as the ewe lambs started lambing.\n\nAs part of the AHDB\u2019s \u201cchallenge sheep\u201d programme we are recording parentage of just under 400 ewe lambs and \nwill be tracking them and their offspring for the next seven years \u2013 I am confident we have the foundation of a \ntremendous flock.\n\nThe unseasonable spring has also meant Jo and I have experimented with role reversals (it\u2019s not as exciting as it \nsounds).\n\nFor a few days I had to switch to arable as the contractor\u2019s big Fendt and 8m cultivation gear became bogged \u2013 our \nlittle Massey could reach places others couldn\u2019t.   \n\nSee also: High lambing losses likely to support fat price for longer\n\nBig thanks go to Dan Livings for stopping his drilling and running across with a Cat Challenger to rescue the \ncontractor. Also, thanks to Trevor and Ralph, who donated/sold me various bits of small lightweight cultivation gear.\n\n\n\nOver three days we managed to get about 25ha of barley in the ground as well as 10ha of grass seed \u2013 although \nwith our drill having no tramline system or markers, it won\u2019t be the prettiest job.\n\nHighlights for me are the knowledge that the local Indian takeaway will deliver to a field gate at 9.30pm (free fork) \nand that trying to ratchet-strap a bailer to the front loader to help the front tyres grip does not work.\n\nOur drilling window has probably shut, with about 100-120 acres of peas still sat in bags. Cheap forage mixes for \nthe lambs could make use of these fields and, with a bit of luck, we can salvage the situation by finishing lambs \nearlier than normal.\n\nRob and Jo Hodgkins run 1,500 ewes across 485ha of grass and have 566ha of arable in Hertfordshire, producing \nlambs for Tesco and breeding sheep through Kaiapoi Romneys. Subsidy-free farming means sheep must be \nfunctional, lamb outdoors and produce lambs on forage alone.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nIt feels as if summer finally decided to show up. It\u2019s been a mad rush around since it started to dry up.\n\nWe have been trying to get everything back on level, growing grass and overseeding all the paddocks that we \nwintered the deer in.\n\nAll the deer are starting to look well now, as the grass is starting to keep up with them. It is great to see them losing \ntheir winter coats.\n\nWe are due to start calving any day now. It looks as if most have managed to hold on to their calves despite all \nwhat nature has thrown at them.\n\nLamb numbers are back on where we would like them to be, but in fairness, all the ewes that didn\u2019t get hit with \ncampylobacter (abortion) have done really well and most of the lambs look well.\n\nSee also: Advice on silage aftercut nutrition in a late spring\n\nWe hosted an open day for the British Deer Farms and Parks Association and there was a reasonable turnout, with \nthe weather making it an enjoyable day.\n\nHopefully we put a few ideas out there for anyone thinking of getting into deer farming.\n\nI bravely decided to show how I muster the deer using my Huntaway. When no one is watching, this goes really \nwell, but I was a bit nervous about all the things that could go wrong.\n\nThe dog hadn\u2019t been worked much for weeks and was wound up like a coiled spring, but it actually came off alright.\n\nMy younger brother Rowly flew over from New Zealand for six days. We ran three competition courses for both the \nBritish wool board and Heiniger. We travelled to Wiltshire, north Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nWe were asked to put on these courses as it is a big year for anyone chasing the circuit to compete at France in the \nworld championships next July.\n\nIt was good to be able to put something back into the industry, as we both really appreciated the support with both \nour world record achievements. It was also great to spend time with Rowly.\n\nMatt and Pip Smith run 500 Red/Romanian deer and 800 breeding Romneys across 121ha in Cornwall. Matt is also \na shearing contractor and trains sheepdogs.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\n\n\nWhat weather we are having. The sun shines for days, only to be interrupted by the odd downpour and \nthunderstorm.\n\nPaddocks have gotten ahead of us and we now need to reassess and begin closing acreage off to be cut and \nbaled.\n\nThis is not an issue, as we do not have any buffer forage stock in the system, and this seems to be the trend with \nmany farmers in the local area.\n\nAnother benefit to the early summer is that the ewes are shearing well. The nucleus and indoor lambing flock are \ndone, and the outdoor commercial flock will be done in the coming days.\n\nOnce this is complete we will begin weaning, recording weights and taking the back fat and eye muscle \nmeasurements.\n\nSee also: Guide to breeding from ewe lambs\n\nQuality meat, not quantity\n\nThe BBQ season continues at the shop. We are seeing an increase in customers, although the trend seems to be \nthat they buy less, but \"better\" meat.\n\nOur sourcing policy of rearing our own, or sourcing from Welsh farms, appeals to the consumers who want ethically \nreared meat with provenance. We must continue to ensure standards are high, that we promote what we do and \nthat we\u2019re proud of our industry.\n\nShop closure\n\nA local family butchers closed its doors last week. The shop was in its third generation of ownership and highlights \nthe evolution of the high street.\n\nBeing an independent family business is no longer enough - the consumer expects better quality, better sourcing \nand better service from independents.\n\nIf this isn\u2019t provided, there is nothing to keep them away from taking the convenient option of supermarket shopping. \nSupermarkets have parking, late opening hours and deliveries which makes them very attractive to the busy \nconsumer.\n\nAs independents, we need to find a way to compete. The change in buying trends is evident, with supermarkets \npromoting British farming and promoting their collaborations with farmers.\n\nThis is fantastic for our industry and we hope that it results in fairer prices throughout the season and that we, as \nfarmers, feel valued and not exploited. \n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nIt has been a crushing few weeks on our ranch. We lost our patriarch, my grandfather.\n\nIt means we have slipped from four generations of the family at home down to three. It may be because it is still so \nraw, but I think these sort of things are more difficult on a family farm.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t just a grandfather who I visited during holidays and got cards in the mail from a few times a year. He was \nmy mentor, my boss, my business partner, my hero. \n\nI grew up eating as many meals at his table as my own. The past few years, as he got older, I may have eaten at \nhis house more than mine - with that time came a lot of talking, both about life and cattle. \n\n\n\nSee also: Farmer Focus: Global disdain at some British cattle breeding\n\nHe was also the majority owner of our business. This of course adds another layer to trying to work through things.\n\nFor many reasons, it is difficult - nothing ever stops when livestock are involved. Soon after I got the news, we had \nto work a set of calves and with less help because Mom and Dad needed to meet with the funeral director.\n\nFeeding cattle hasn\u2019t quit while we grieve either. This week we begin our spring AI season - we breed 700 \ncommercial heifers this week.\n\nOnce they're done and at summer grass we will start doing the pedigree animals. It\u2019s a numbing feeling to not be \nable to quit, or run away, or just turn it off for a little while. \n\nThere is a saying in the American West that when someone has complete buy-in to whatever they are doing they \nare \u201criding for the brand\u201d.\n\nI have reflected on this in the days that have passed since I marked his coffin with our cattle brand -  the \u201cquarter \ncircle over M Bar\u201d. This marks what belongs to our ranch for \u201coutsiders\u201d to see, but it has a much more personal \nsentiment for us.\n\nI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have a full appreciation of what it will mean to ride for the brand like Grandpa did, not only with our \nranch life, but in a broader, human sense.\n\nI can only try my best to continue with the legacy he instilled in us and keep pushing along.\n\nDaniel Mushrush is a third-generation Red Angus breeder in the Flint Hills.

We are no longer Jefferson\u2019s America and \nagriculture is usually ignored/underappreciated/attacked by people who don\u2019t care about it.\n\nSavvy rural politicians have moved food stamps into the programme and kept them there, ensuring urban politicians \ncare about the bill and have to pass it. \n\nSee also: How to \u2018home-test\u2019 grass to know when to cut for silage\n\nThe remaining 20% is for agriculture. About 15% goes to crop insurance and commodity programmes.\n\nMost goes to the \"big five\" - corn, wheat, soya beans, cotton and rice. The cotton guys in particular have done a \ngreat job in carving out an oversized piece of the pie. \n\nLimited payments for livestock \n\nThe last 5% goes to conservation programmes and \u201cother.\u201d This is where livestock guys usually fit in for buffer \nstrips near streams and redesigning water facilities, for example.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cother\u201d involves disaster programmes for droughts and wildfires that can completely wreck businesses and, \nalthough the smallest portion of the whole bill, is the most important and the only money livestock farms can get. \n\nThe Farm Bill is just welfare and a way for rural America and the urban poor to take a little bit of money from our \nrich, soft, latte-drinking suburban counterparts.\n\nLand is the goal\n\nI was lucky enough to have a university professor who wrote farm bills. One thing he drove into us was research \nshowing that farmers, by nature, buy land, and farm payments were capitalised in land values.\n\nThis means the large \u201cbig five\u201d farmers get bigger and push livestock out of the way.\n\nThe older you are, the more time you have had for the equity to accumulate. He called this \u201cgrandpa\u2019s way of \nscrewing his grandsons\u201d.\n\nBut it's OK. As a young guy trying to branch out and grow with only livestock, I\u2019m not bitter all. \n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nHedgerows have burst into colour, fields are green and the sun is shining. Everything is a lot more positive and it\u2019s \na lot easier to find enthusiasm to do things \u2013 even BPS applications and its associated headaches.\n\nMay is mental health awareness month, which is fairly apt for the agricultural industry after the past few months of \nweather woes.\n\nAs an industry where workers are often isolated and independent, it is difficult to speak up and tell someone your \ntroubles, or that you are not coping well. But it shouldn\u2019t be \u2013 there are a host of people you can talk too; friends or \nfamily, or farming charities.\n\nSee also: Where farmers in need can find charity help\n\nOften a simple phone call can be a huge relief, even if it only tells you that you\u2019re not alone in having the worries or \nfrustrations.

Things always seemed better after the call.\n\nDrilling update\n\nSpring drilling has taken place in relatively good conditions compared with what we thought they would be back in \nApril.\n\nAlthough later than I would have liked, I am very pleased with the results.\n\nA few wet areas that are still like porridge have been left, but they are now home to a number of lapwing and \nskylark, so it isn\u2019t all bad.\n\nThe main jobs to be doing while I eagerly await my first proper harvest will be yard and track improvements to aid \nlogistics and make the place tidier. We also want to establish some pollen and nectar margins and wild bird feed \nplots.\n\nHarvest will also be a big step, because after much deliberation I\u2019ve bought my own combine.

The target is 99mg/PCU \n(population-corrected unit) and the industry level for 2017 is 131mg/PCU, so we are well on the way to beating the \ntarget a couple of years early.\n\nAs a company, we have reduced our use to 6.6mg/PCU, which we are extremely proud of.\n\nSee also: How Devon pig farmer is saving \u00a330,000/year by slashing antibiotics use\n\nWe achieved this by maintaining our high health status through having a closed herd, three-week batch farrowing \nand investing in new weaner/grower housing, which has allowed us to remove all in-feed medication in the crucial \ntwo-week post-weaning period.\n\nWe operate a creep-feeding protocol in the farrowing room, which ensures all piglets are eating solid food before \nweaning. In our new weaner buildings, the water system is sterilised using a chlorine dioxide product, followed by \nan organic acid that improves intestinal health and water uptake.\n\nThis is not a cheap option, but we are finding excellent results without relying on antibiotics. Until a couple of years \nago, we really did not know what our antibiotics use was, but since the introduction of the eMedicine Book, we know \nexactly what we are using and we are striving to reduce our use whenever we can.\n\nAntibiotics benchmarking is now available which allows you to compare your antibiotics use against holdings similar \nto your own.\n\nPig farmers always love a challenge and a target to beat. We would rather make things happen than wait for things \nto happen.\n\nWhoever had the idea of the eMedicine Book deserves a good pat on the back, or maybe even an award.\n\nIt got me thinking whether there is such a thing in human health - does the NHS have a league table of surgeries \nand hospitals for antibiotics use? l would bet there is a world of difference between the best and worst.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nServing started on 1 May, a week later than previous years to try to avoid having as many late January calves. And, \nafter the pressures of this spring, an extra week for the herd won\u2019t be a bad thing.\n\nCows were all tail-painted the day before, and general bulling activity seems good. This is a relief after the late \nspring and prolonged buffering with silage throughout March.\n\nGrass growth finally took off in the second week of April and we were able to take the brakes off the cows and hit \nand maintain a 20-day grazing round, with no silage and easing back the feed in the parlour from nearly 6kg to 4kg.\n\nSee also: Jersey cows produce profits from milk solids in Ireland\n\nGrass quality is excellent and the cows are milking well, giving about 1.8kg of milk solids.\n\n\n\nWe are measuring grass every week, using this information to track grass growth, average grass cover on the farm \nand the round length of the cows (how many days it would take to graze the whole farm based on the hectares \ngrazed since the last grass measure).\n\nThe information allows us to foresee potential grass surpluses which could compromise quality \u2013 or potential \ndeficits.\n\nWalking the farm is also a vital management tool: it\u2019s amazing how many actions you can note down by the time it\u2019s \ndone.\n\nFieldwork has ramped up in the past week, with the wintering ground being worked down and resown back to \ngrass. Fodder beet crops will hopefully be all sown by the first week of May, followed by the kale.\n\nSome rented land has posed some issues, having produced very little in the previous two seasons. The conclusion \nis it\u2019s down to historic compaction from potatoes \u2013 there was near to no worm activity.\n\nHopefully a deep subsoil and 2t/acre (4.942t/ha) of lime and chicken manure will help kick-start a crop of \nAberNiche.

Maximising grazed grass and good milk solids are priorities.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nWow, what tremendous growth we have seen in our crops recently. The sprayer doesn\u2019t know what has hit it, with \nT2 fungicides following T1 very rapidly \u2013 just a two-week interval in places as the flag leaf showed itself at the usual \nmid-May timing.\n\nSome might argue that we could have omitted the T0, or the T1, and cut down the fungicide spend. It is such a \ngamble taking that approach though. We just can\u2019t predict the weather two weeks ahead.\n\nYou only need a week of rain, or high winds, or very warm weather to reduce spray opportunities.\n\nSee also: Tips on how to recruit good arable farm staff\n\nThe spring barley, naked oats and millet went in the ground in good conditions. As predicted the spring beans didn\u2019t \ngo in, a phacelia cover crop taking their place.\n\nSince this is by a public footpath, signs will tell walkers what we are up to and will highlight the benefits of the \nphacelia to wildlife, which they should see for themselves when it is buzzing with bees.\n\nHarvest student\n\nIt is quite uncanny how I regularly find myself doing the flag leaf spray in the week leading up to the Essex Young \nFarmers Show while Hew is up at the showground helping set things out.\n\nWhat a show it was too. Run entirely by the members, it attracted over 15,000 visitors, drawing in the whole farming \ncommunity, but also attracting the wider population too.\n\nThere is a real interest in country sports, food and farming which Essex Young Farmers have tapped in to.\n\nI have been blown away by the quality of young people that we have met recently in the search for a harvest \nstudent.\n\n\n\nThere are some seriously dedicated people out there eager to get on the UK farming ladder. With the right \nencouragement and support they will flourish and then start to teach you things.\n\nWe would have been happy to have any of them join us, but it is Harry who we will be welcoming to the farm for the \nsummer.\n\nChristy Willett farms with her son Hew on 475ha at Parklands Farm, Galleywood in Essex, growing combinable \ncrops alongside diversifications into horse stables on DIY livery, industrial and office lets.

However, when you get into \nMay and spring drilling is yet to be completed, it does start to try your patience.\n\nWe have now finished drilling, but it has been spread over a two-week period, so should make harvest interesting.\n\nThe first block of spring oats is now emerging, but it is not looking pretty. With the soil not being quite dry enough at \nthe time of drilling, then heavy rain and now baking heat, it can be said that emergence is a little uneven.\n\nSee also: New spring oat variety with miller backing good bet for 2018\n\nWith the second block we ran a disc cultivator lightly 24 hours ahead of the drill and drilling conditions were greatly \nimproved. I think being flexible has to be the key.\n\nSpreading risk\n\nWe have not completed our total planned spring drilling area as we decided to spread the risk and leave the grass \ncover crop in and take a cut of silage.\n\nThe winter wheat has really picked up in the past 10 days and a T1 has now been applied. An SDHI-based \nfungicide has been used where we think there is potential.\n\nBoth of our chosen wheat varieties, Graham and Costello, are living up to their good disease ratings.\n\nThe oilseed rape has reached full flower one month later than last year, but does look full of promise.\n\nIn the winter barley we look to have lost quite a few tillers and I think this is down to the crop having wet feet for a \nprolonged period of time and not receiving nitrogen soon enough.\n\nI also think the earlier-drilled conventional barley is showing signs of a barley yellow dwarf virus infection.\n\nJack Hopkins is the assistant farm manager on a 730ha estate in north Herefordshire on predominantly silty clay \nloam soils. Cropping includes wheat, barley, oilseed rape, spring oats and peas, plus grassland that supports a \nflock of 1,000 ewes and 25 pedigree Hereford cattle.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThis spring has felt like one continuous conveyor belt of work, with timings of applications continuously rolling from \none to the next.\n\nFrom being very late it now seems growth stages have caught up and become slightly earlier, if anything, than in a \nnormal season (whatever one of those is).\n\nThe spring oats drilled in May have really grown rapidly and it really has shown that patience is the key.\n\nSee also: Read more from our arable Farmer Focus writers\n\n\n\nBlackgrass has become a more common sight this year, with a few plants in most fields of wheat rather than the \nodd isolated case we have had in recent years.\n\nNot worth the price\n\nWe have been roughing to make sure we keep it at a manageable level.\n\nI think it has come from either muck we imported or balers where we have sold straw, so we are going to stick to \nour guns and chop all the straw we will not be using ourselves, even though straw prices are going to be particularly \nhigh this year.\n\nI have been working closely with Finley Hawkins from Cobb Agri and once again we have taken tissue samples \nfrom the wheat.\n\nThis showed potassium levels in the crop were slightly lower than it should be, but field levels seemed OK.\n\nFin said he has seen this across the county, so we will do the same again next year to see whether it has been a \nseasonal effect or if we need to consider a foliar application.\n\nCommodity prices all seem to be rising, which is good for selling new-crop wheat with its relatively moderate input \ncosts.\n\nHowever, new-season fertiliser prices are considerably higher than last year. We have taken cover on some UK AN \nas the price does look as if it is going to strengthen further.\n\nElsewhere, silage-making is in full flow and this year we have tried an Ag Bag, aiming for more consistency and \nquality in the silage. It has certainly brought efficiency to the operation.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nWhat to do with all of that extra time in the office? That is the question that our recent upgrade to superfast \nbroadband has posed.\n\nIt\u2019s just amazing; no more making a cup of tea while waiting for downloads, and using the Rural Land Register \nmaps to complete the BPS form has almost been a pleasure. Click on the parcel number and it\u2019s there. \n\nThat is of course tempered with an element of sarcasm; it would be if the map on the screen actually matched what \nis on the ground.\n\nSee also: Read more from our arable Farmer Focus writers\n\nIndividual and completely separate fields amalgamated with their neighbours, pony paddocks sub-divided with \ntemporary electric fencing and very many other frustrations detract from the delight of actually being able to view \nthe map.\n\nI wonder how many more mapping exercises we will have to go through before we actually get the true size of the \nfarm.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t be messing around mapping to the nearest square metre if farming isn\u2019t going to be supported in the \nfuture.\n\nSpring has sprung\n\nNow that spring eventually appears to have arrived, I hope you have all managed to challenge nature by sowing \ncrops later than is generally regarded as optimum.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s hope the season does balance out through the year so the late-planted crops can make up for lost time. \n\nWinter cereals are romping through their growth stages. Root crops, including sugar beet, are also giving it a good \ngo, especially those that were planted in mid-April. \n\nI look forward to seeing you all at the revamped and re-energised Cereals event next month. \n\nI wonder what the principal themes will be - no doubt how we can get more from less, how to enhance our \nenvironment and how to make more profit while providing cheaper food. Or am I just being an old sceptic?\n\nJust one month after the Health and Harmony consultation will surely be too early to have our responses and come \nout with a plan regardless.\n\nAndrew Blenkiron manages the 4,400ha Euston Estate, south of Thetford.

It's a bit lighter than last year, but excellent quality.\n\nGrass for zero grazing is hitting growth rates of 100kg DM/day, which is helping keep purchased feed costs down \nalmost 2p/litre.\n\nThe milk market is certainly showing more positive signs, with butter and cream the main drivers.\n\nOur main concern is what next winter's feed is going to cost, with proteins at crazy prices just now and wheat \nholding firm.\n\nSee also: Step-by-step guide to controlling weeds in grass\n\nForage stocks could be an issue if this summer turns out to be a dry one, with very little carryover from 2017. Still, if \nthe milk price starts with a three, we should manage OK.\n\nThe one thing I have really noticed on the farm is compaction on the land. Heavy rains in 2017 took their toll.\n\nA dairy can consume so much time in the yard that the land can very easily be taken for granted, yet drainage, \nliming and reseeding are key drivers for production and profit.\n\nOn my travels last week I attended the AGM of our next generation group at NFU Scotland. I am very excited to be \ninvolved with this group, as I feel it is very important to have strong links between young farmers and NFU Scotland.\n\nAgri-politics is not for everyone, but the ones who are inspired must be given every opportunity to express the need \nfor change in our current agricultural policy to help the younger generation develop and grow their businesses.\n\nBut this is not just about new entrants. I believe there are many young farmers out there in a family business that \nfeel very constrained in trying new ideas or systems.\n\nHow do we change this?

We were invited \nto a wedding in Carluke, Scotland, of a lad who worked for us here in Valetta 10 years ago.\n\nJayne and I haven\u2019t travelled to any extent before, nor have we camped as a family previously, so travelling to the \nUK and camper-vanning with three children would be best described as an awesome and epic adventure.\n\nAs well as attending the wedding, it was our intention to visit as many of the lads that came to New Zealand to work \nfor us when we were contracting as possible.\n\nSee also: Read more from our arable Farmer Focus writers\n\nOn a personal level, it was very special to see guys who came to us as bright-eyed 18- or 20-year-olds and now \nmeet their wives or partners, parents and children and get to see what they are now doing.\n\n\n\nAll four coasts\n\nWe completed 2,800 miles in 25 days.

I was struck by the stark differences in land tenure \nbetween our countries and circumstances that are steeped in history dating back hundreds of years.\n\nThe most common question I was asked was how I farm without any form of government support.\n\nWe loved our trip. It was not without its challenges, but awesome for us as a family. If you saw a white camper with \nNZ and a KIWI on the back taking photos over your fence; that was us!\n\nAbsolutely loved our time, thank you all very much.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nMay is a fantastic time of year if you are fortunate enough to live and work in the countryside and I am seeing more \nwildlife than ever on a daily basis.\n\nHowever, I \u2013 like others \u2013 am becoming ever more frustrated when I read flippant comments on social media by \ninfluential professional persons and charitable companies about how modern farming is  resulting in a massive \ndecline in wildlife numbers.\n\nThis simply isn\u2019t the case. I do wish these people could be made to either prove their point or retract it with an \napology. Sorry, rant over.\n\nThe farm is looking well, although we have a few more ruts than I would like to see. Travelling hasn\u2019t been easy at \ntimes this spring and more remedial work will be required to put this right after harvest.\n\nBlackgrass numbers are manageable and certainly lower than this time two years ago, which is promising. My \nbiggest frustration this year is volunteer barley in wheat.\n\nI can understand it on fields we have grown barley on in the past, but we have it both where we have never grown \nbarley and in new seed, so it looks like some hand-rouging is required.\n\nSee also: Blackgrass battle looks winnable for Suffolk grower\n\nBuilding work\n\nBetween the showers and glorious sunshine we have been carrying out some building work in one of our old grain \nstores. The partitions were originally made of timber and had become prone to breaking or moving, causing a \ndegree of hassle every year.\n\nThey have now been replaced with steel uprights and concrete panels. We have also raised the height from 3m to \n4m, increasing storage capacity by a thousand tonnes in the process.\n\nAll we need to do now is learn to grow bigger crops to fill it.\n\n\n\nThe elder harvest has started and so far it looks as if it could be a bumper year. My go-to reference plants are \ncarrying more than 20% more flowers than normal, which is fantastic.\n\nThe slowdown in the weather and return to more spring-like conditions is also helping to give us more picking time \u2013 \nfingers crossed it stays like this.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nSo, that\u2019s our first flock of hens complete. Hens are out, building mucked out, washdown team in, cleaned, \ndisinfected and diatomaceous earth applied.\n\nThat one sentence does not really sum up the effort involved in the past three weeks. Hard graft, stress, several \nbruises and a burnt-out motor, followed by an endless list of jobs to do before the new hens arrive in a week or so. \n\nThe hen muck is going on to the fields being sown into brassicas for finishing lambs on this autumn and winter. We \nhave applied manure, ploughed, worked and sown 7.2ha.\n\nSee also: Business Clinic: What tax relief can be claimed for new poultry unit?\n\nWe have also sown 32ha of barley/vetch wholecrop, undersown with red or white clover and high-sugar grasses. \nFields are already starting to green up nicely.\n\nEwes and lambs are now out of their lambing fields and all silage fields have been shut up. This has happened later \nthan we would have liked, but the grass growth on the permanent pastures has been very slow.\n\nThe yearling bulling heifers have been weighed and pelvic measurements taken and their comprehensive BVD, \nleptospirosis and lungworm vaccination programme has commenced. A cobalt, selenium, iodine and copper bolus \nhas also been given.\n\nFour out of 64 heifers failed their pelvic measure and one had temperamental issues, so we have 59 to bull \nourselves or sell. The last of the prime cattle are now away at an average of 24 months old.\n\nCalving is nearly over, with three left to calve at the time of writing (29 May). It has been a long six weeks and \neveryone has run out of steam now. \n\nCalving, lambing, drilling, hen depletion and clean-down in a short period of time takes its toll. A holiday needs to be \nbooked.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nI am sure we are not alone in having endured a challenging spring, but we can see the light at the end of the tunnel; \nthe fields are all drilled, everything has received fly control and lambing is over. \n\nWhen our shepherd departed at the end of February, we thought: \"It will be rough, but we can do this.\"\n\nThe main flock and ewe lamb lambing is staggered and we have lambed 880 on our own before, so we thought: \n\"We will dig deep and get it done.\"\n\nHowever, we didn't anticipate the wet weather (leaving us to complete lambing beats on quad bikes and \noccasionally just on foot) and the repercussions it would have for us trying to get our new heavy land farm drilled.\n\nSee also: 7-step guide to planting brassica crops\n\nLighter gear gets job done\n\n\n\nRob wrote last month about the Massey riding to the rescue and also that we still had empty fields. Well, some of \nthose were set to enter mid-tier grassland options this year, so we drilled them with grass early and abandoned the \nlast crop.\n\nThe others we battled in between us and our contractor. In total our 3.3m drill (\u00a33,300), Massey (\u00a324,000), \nCultivator (\u00a3800) and rolls (\u00a3600) covered about 141ha in the autumn (establishing forage and greening crops) and \nhave done 80ha this spring.\n\nThis has been drilling a mix of combining peas, spring barley and grass. For us to cultivate, drill and roll costs us \n\u00a333.77/ha and we could travel over all of our acres.\n\nWe know this kit couldn't do the whole 607ha and we know it's been an exceptionally wet year, but it does make \nyou think.\n\nThe results from the combine will be fascinating, with \"cheap\" drilling right next door to \"proper\" drilling \u2013 or \"light \nkit\" next to \"heavy kit\".\n\nOur combined tractor/drill weight was about 7t - the Fendt 939 alone is 11t without an implement. Should these big, \nheavy tools be left purely for primary cultivations in the autumn?\n\nThe cost implications are massive, but as we are all trying to do more spring work, are these larger machines really \nthe future? Yield and price of wheat are certainly not growing in line with machinery increases. \n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nI\u2019m writing this looking across Lake Garda while on a week\u2019s break. When this trip was booked I fully expected that \nthe bulk of the spring workload would have been finished by now.\n\nInstead I have left Andrew and the team at home carrying on with potato planting while I\u2019m off chilling out.\n\nI try to live by the theory that you should leave the farm once a day, the village once a week, the county once a \nmonth and the country once a year.\n\nSee also: 3 fungicide strategies to fight resistant potato blight\n\nIt\u2019s a nice idea, but, in practice, it doesn\u2019t work like that. Some days I seem to struggle to get out of the office, let \nalone get off the farm!\n\nMin-till experiment\n\nPotato planting seems to have gone relatively well despite its late start. This, combined with what is likely to be our \nlatest ever finish, means I can\u2019t see that we will achieve last season\u2019s yields. Maybe that will be a good thing.\n\nWe have been a bit radical this year and not ploughed everything going into potatoes. We found that some of the \nploughed land, following the wet autumn and winter, was turning over in big slabs which just slowed the progress of \nthe bed tiller.\n\nInstead we have used the Sumo Trio on some selected fields as an experiment. The structure seemed much freer \nwithout the big soil blocks to break down.\n\nOtherwise the cereals appear to be galloping through their growth stages. Wheat T1 applications seemed to take \nforever as there was such a range. By the time we got to T2, growth stages had tightened up considerably, making \nit rather more straightforward.\n\nWhen I was doing my BASIS training a wise, experienced agronomist always said you could pretty much predict the \nT2 timing by the calendar date, and I have never found that to be widely inaccurate.\n\n\n\nNature has a marvellous way of putting things right and keeping them on track.\n\nJeremy Oatey manages 1,200ha of arable land near Plymouth in Cornwall and is 2013 Farmers Weekly Arable \nFarmer of the Year.

The bank holiday weekend has seen \ntemperatures get into the mid 20s, which has allowed us to do a 24-hour wilt.\n\nWe were aiming for 35% dry matter, but at times the lightest crops were almost blowing away as they were so dry. I \nam intrigued to see what the outcome is when we open up the pit in a month\u2019s time.\n\nThis spring has certainly been a challenge, but I have enjoyed getting to understand how our farm deals with it and \nit has certainly been made evident by the yield variation across fields.\n\nSome crops yielded poorly and I\u2019m getting some samples done to see if there is anything sinister in it.\n\nSee also: Optimise second cut with aftermath nutrition\n\nI think the main issue is simply the awful winter and spring we have had. As I was putting fertiliser on this evening I \nwas pleased to see the aftermaths almost greening up in front of me.\n\nFingers crossed the moisture in the ground and a bit of sun will lead to a bumper second cut, as we will need to \nmake up some bulk.\n\nWe will hopefully get maize planted this week if the weather stays dry enough. We tried to get both farmyard \nmanure and slurry on the stubbles two weeks ago, but had to abandon ship as ground conditions wouldn\u2019t allow it.\n\nAway from the fields, I am pleased to say we got the green light for the grant funding on our shedding gate; one tool \nI really cannot wait to get up and running.\n\nI will end with an irritation about the fertility indicator we are all encouraged to use, Pregnancy Rate. I found out this \nweek that different software uses different indices when calculating submission rates.\n\nOnce again, when we are all trying to benchmark our performance, you find there can actually be significant \nvariation depending on what software is being used to calculate the figure, so we are left pondering if we are at \n23%, 30% or somewhere in between.\n\nIf anyone can shed any light on the matter then please get in touch @LowerWoodFarm.\n\nHenry Wilson milks 225 Holsteins on a tenancy alongside his parents Jean and Chris in Alberbury, Shropshire. \nCows calve year-round with milk supplied to Muller on a non-aligned contract.

Marketing maestro\n\nThere\u2019s no point producing something if you can\u2019t sell it, so you have to know your market and, increasingly, \nfarmers are dealing directly with consumers.\n\nThis means you\u2019ll need to be confident, concise and convincing when conveying the key benefits of our great British \nproduce \u2013 whether that\u2019s traceability, taste or welfare standards. Our 2016 star sellers had to retail meat at the \nGreat Yorkshire Show.\n\nSee also: Meet the 2018 Apprentice finalists\n\n2. Crop selection guru\n\nYou won\u2019t make many decisions more important than selecting what to grow.\n\nSo, when contestants were tasked with creating a planting and management plan for wheat, they had to research \nthe soil, climate, pests and diseases and varieties, then combine this data with expected costs and returns using \npowerful farm management software. The goal? Turning a healthy profit.\n\n3. Technology nous\n\nNew kit has a vital role to play in reducing costs, increasing returns and farming in a more environmentally friendly \nway so we gave competitors the chance to fly a drone to capture field facts, then use it to create a fertiliser plan, \nwhich they had to input into a state-of-the-art tractor.\n\nNot forgetting having to jump in the cab and actually get spreading, of course.\n\n4. Husbandry heroes\n\nStockmanship is a fundamental skill for many farmers, so previous apprentices have been put through their paces \ndoing everything from checking the condition of pigs to assessing lambs' readiness for market and preparing cattle \nfor showing.\n\nThey\u2019ve also had to build pens and round up the animals to begin with, of course, which can bring a whole set of \nchallenges of its own.\n\n5. Happy hands-on\n\n\n\nThe theory's all very well, but there are plenty of times when you have to roll your sleeves up. Welding is a tough \ntask \u2013 perfect, then, as a way of challenging our would-be winners. Some prospered in the workshop; others were, \nahem, not quite so good...\n\n6. Machinery maintenance\n\nNot many farms have got a mechanic on hand, so a few maintenance and repair skills can be vital. The scenario \nwe created was a simple one. Rain\u2019s on its way but you've got a few dry hours, so you need to get a combine good \nto go.\n\nOur apprentices were given some instructions, a few tools and \u2013 under the watchful eye of an engineering expert \u2013 \ntold to get working\n\n7. Business brains\n\nCashflows, costs, revenues, profit. Figures matter. And not solely when it comes to the tried and tested aspects of \nagriculture \u2013 nowadays you need to think laterally, whether that\u2019s adding value, niche markets or diversification.\n\nWe set contestants the individual challenge of formulating a business plan for a college farm which would return a \nprofit, while delivering on its educational objectives. They then had to present it to the judges in a 10-minute \nDragons\u2019 Den-style pitch. No pressure then...\n\n8. Leadership\n\nWe\u2019re looking for go-getters who have a vision, make decisions and enjoy taking responsibility. Such natural \nleaders are also good listeners and can inspire those around them.\n\nThat's why bootcamp tasks often have a leader (we might choose them; or we might get the contestants to) which \nreveals a lot about everyone involved. Are you someone who\u2019s happy to put your head above the parapet?\n\n9. Communication counts\n\nWhether it\u2019s an email to your agronomist, a phone call to an auctioneer, a conversation with a family member or a \nletter to your bank manager, you need to be clear, succinct and persuasive, sometimes in high-pressure situations.\n\nOver the course of the week we\u2019ll be keeping an eye on what you say and what you write \u2013 and how you say and \nwrite it. Here\u2019s a tip: be brief!\n\n10. Teamwork\n\nOne plus one equals three. Well it doesn\u2019t; actually, it equals two, but you know what we mean. It\u2019s all about the \nsum of the parts. This means coming up with a shared vision and agreeing responsibilities. When people work \ntogether effectively, the results can be incredible \u2013 and very satisfying!\n\nA word from one of the judges\n\nHaving a willingness to learn is one of the most important attributes required, says farmer Robert Neill from \nRoxburghshire.\n\n\u201cFarmers have always been good at adapting, but agriculture could be about to go through some of the biggest \nchanges it's ever experienced, so I want to see apprentices who are keen to learn, have a hunger to acquire new \nskills and are open to new ideas.\n\n\u201cFarming is so specialist nowadays that you can\u2019t be knowledgeable about everything, but if you don\u2019t know \nsomething, you should be prepared to ask someone who does.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe successful farmer of the future will also be very willing to embrace new technology to help improve efficiency, \nso IT skills will become ever-more important.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d also like to see the apprentices display huge reserves of passion \u2013 we need the next generation to be so \nenthusiastic about what they do that they\u2019ll seize opportunities to promote agriculture to the general public.\u201d\n\nWhat is Farmers Apprentice?\n\nFarmers Apprentice puts 10 young people through a week-long bootcamp that exposes them to some of the best in \ntechnical equipment and expertise to reflect real challenges faced by UK farmers.\n\nAt the end of the week, one will be crowned Farmers Weekly Farmers Apprentice 2018, winning \u00a310,000 to get a \nfoothold on the farming ladder. \n\nSponsored by\n\nSee the Farmers Apprentice website for more information about the competition and bootcamp details, and follow \nthe competition @farmersweekly, #farmersapprentice.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA Hertfordshire farmer at loggerheads with his local council after an outdoor pursuit company set up camp in \nadjacent woodland hopes his three-year battle may soon be over after the local authority admitted it made a \nmistake.\n\nWilliam Ashley, who farms at Monks Green Farm, near Hertford, said his ordeal began after the Bushcraft Company \nerected 56 tents on land next door.\n\nThe company uses the woodland to host residential camping trips for students and schoolchildren aged seven to \n18.\n\nSee also: Five tips to speed up planning permission\n\nMr Ashley said coach drivers often get lost trying to find the campsite and end up travelling down his farm drive.\n\nOn other occasions, parents and taxi drivers coming to collect children from the site knock on his door ask for \ndirections. Verges were damaged as the increased traffic took its toll on local lanes.\n\nLand used for tented camping for more than 28 days a year usually requires planning permission \u2013 or an \nexemption.\n\nMr Ashley said he was convinced Bushcraft had neither \u2013 but it took three years before East Hertfordshire District \nCouncil acknowledged they needed one or the other.\n\nNightmare\n\n\u201cWhat Bushcraft do with the kids is fantastic,\u201d said Mr Ashley, who erected a signpost in an effort to point coach \ndrivers in the right direction and away from his farm. \u201cBut coaches were rocking up the drive and then having to \nback out again because they couldn't turn around \u2013 it was a nightmare.\u201d\n\nSection 269 of the 1936 Public Health Act requires an operator to obtain a special licence from the local authority \nfor land used as a campsite for more than 42 days in a row \u2013 or 60 days in total during any 12-month period.\n\nThe Bushcraft Company told Farmers Weekly it had worked closely with the local authorities to obtain all necessary \nlicences to operate at the site. These included a Section 296 licence and planning permission to erect a storage \ncompound, it added.\n\n\n\nSignage\n\nIn a statement, Bushcraft said: \u201cThe company has signage located at the entrance to the site and provides all \nschools with detailed instructions of where coaches need to drop off and collect school groups at the start and end \nof their camps.\u201d\n\nAfter being contacted by Farmers Weekly, a spokesperson for East Hertfordshire Council said the local authority \nhad now advised Bushcraft it would either require full planning permission for the site or a certificate of exemption \nfrom Natural England.\n\n\u201cThe council has written to the company giving them 28 days to apply for either of these,\u201d said the council \nspokesperson. \u201cThe company already has a licence under the Public Health Act 1936 \u2013 although such licences only \ncover how campsites are run.\u201d\n\nTricky situation can be expensive to resolve\n\nSituations like this can be incredibly frustrating and leave farmers feeling powerless, says Julie Robinson, partner at \nRoythornes Solicitors.\n\n\u201cPrivate actions are available, but cost and the chances of success are major obstacles except in the most \nindefensible cases,\u201d she explains.\n\nIn cases of simple trespass, farmers can take action, but it is probably not worth pursuing except where there is \ncontinuous or repeated trespass creating significant risk.\n\n\u201cYou are best asking people politely to leave and putting up more private land notices. If people come on to your \nland with the intention of disrupting your lawful activities, that\u2019s a different matter; such aggravated trespass is a \ncriminal offence.\"\n\nA private nuisance claim may also be possible, but again this is best saved for situations where there is continuous \nand unreasonable interference with the use or enjoyment of your land.\n\nIndirect options rely on hard-pressed local authorities and others to take action. You might act if planning \nregulations are being breached, or if roadways are being used in a way that exceeds their status, such as a \nbridleway being used by vehicles.\n\nYou may also ask whether conditions of any licence or exemption under the Public Health Act 1936 are being \nobserved, or whether the use of the land is exceeding its permitted use, for example under a tenancy, licence or \nrestrictive covenant.\n\nThere might be grounds for a statutory nuisance action by the local authority, but the bar is set high.\n\nConsider whether an activity is unreasonably and substantially interfering with the use of your land or likely to injure \nhealth. This could include letting rubbish pile up or unreasonable noise.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe NFU has warned farmers they face rises in climate change taxes unless they register for a discount scheme \nbefore the 31 July deadline.\n\nThe climate change levy (CCL) is a tax charged on gas, electricity, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), coal and coke \nused by UK businesses.\n\nIn April 2019, CCL rates levied on energy bills will increase by about 3% for electricity and 7% for gas for any \nbusinesses that do not register for a discounted rate under an NFU scheme.\n\n\n\nSee also: Why farming\u2019s being asked to do more to fight climate change\n\nUnder the CCL scheme, eligible businesses can receive a discount in return for meeting energy-efficiency or \ncarbon-saving targets. Achieving these targets will enable the business to receive a discount until March 2023, the \nNFU says.\n\nThe NFU CCL scheme gives up to 93% levy reductions on electricity and 78% on gas to qualifying businesses in \nthe pig, poultry and protected horticulture sectors. It is therefore imperative to sign up to the scheme before the \ndeadline of 31 July, the union warns.\n\nExample of annual CCL savings for poultry farm using 350,000 kWh of import electricity and 45,000 litres of LPG\n\nYear\n\nNon-member pays\n\nCCL member pays\n\nMember saving\n\n2012-13\n\n\u00a33,615.50\n\n\u00a31,265.43\n\n\u00a32,350.08\n\n2017-18\n\n\u00a34,608.10\n\n\u00a3605.71\n\n\u00a34,002.39\n\n2019-20\n\n\u00a36,907.75\n\n\u00a3630.36\n\n\u00a36,277.40\n\nIn addition to the cost saving, the NFU said joining the scheme would help with business marketing by \ndemonstrating to customers an official and committed approach to improving energy sustainability.\n\nHow to join\n\nOnce the decision has been made to join the scheme, farmers will be asked to enter into a climate change \nagreement (CCA), according to advice from the NFU-owned consultancy FEC Energy.\n\nThis involves the following steps:\n\nProvide your base year data (energy and production). The base year should be the continuous 12-month period \nfrom January to December 2008 unless there are valid reasons why it is not available \u2013 for example, the site wasn\u2019t \nin production or was run by another operator.\n\n\n\nCheck the \u201c70% rule\u201d. You need to provide evidence that you comply with the 70% rule \u2013 that the energy you use \non the eligible processes alone accounts for more than 70% of the total supplied to each facility. \n\nComplete a \u201cfacility eligibility form\u201d giving all essential details, including an annotated site plan. FEC will check your \ndetails and make a formal application for you based on them.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFarm leaders in Scotland have urged the Scottish government to support proposals to tackle the blight of livestock \nworrying.\n\nEmma Harper MSP recently announced her intention to bring forward a private members bill to the Scottish \nparliament to address livestock worrying.\n\nSee also: Special investigation \u2013 Police fail to crack down on sheep worrying\n\nNFU Scotland has now written to rural economy cabinet secretary Fergus Ewing seeking Scottish government \nsupport for the proposed Bill.\n\nIn the letter, NFUS has mapped out five areas it believes merit inclusion in any new legislative framework or \nguidance:\n\nLivestock worrying to become a recordable crime\n\nAll non-working dogs to be on a lead around sheep\n\nPolice powers to issue dog control notices\n\nPolice powers to seize dogs and have dogs destroyed\n\nFines for offenders and full compensation to farmers\n\nNFUS president Andrew McCornick said: \u201cTerrible events around Scotland this spring demonstrated the \ndevastation caused by out of control dogs.\n\n\u201cThe graphic images of dead and mauled sheep and lambs have highlighted the impact of irresponsible dog \nownership on farmers\u2019 livelihoods and action is needed.\u201d\n\nBlight on farming\n\nMr McCornick said the union welcomed Ms Harper \u2019s proposed Bill and had taken the opportunity to meet with her \nto discuss the issue.\n\n\u201cDespite a vast amount of awareness raising by many stakeholders, including Police Scotland, livestock worrying \nremains a blight on Scottish livestock farming,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing as an irresponsible dog, only irresponsible dog owners.\n\n\u201cThis proposed Bill presents a genuine opportunity for Scottish government to back change that will make a \nmassive difference to livestock keepers across the country.\u201d\n\nFinancial costs\n\nMs Harper said dog attacks were harmful to animal welfare but also had severe financial implications for farmers.\n\n\u201cLivestock worrying is an enormous issue which I know is of concern to people across the agricultural sector,\u201d she \nsaid.\n\n\n\nMr Ewing said it was a criminal offence for a dog owner to allow their animal to worry livestock, and local authorities \nhave the power to issue dog control notices.\n\nThe Scottish government had written to all 32 local authorities, seeking further information about how they use their \npowers, he told MSPs.\n\n\u201cWorking with partners, we will consider all practical measures that can effectively tackle livestock worrying by out-\nof-control dogs,\u201d said Mr Ewing.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFarmers who responded to a rural crime survey could help secure fairer funding for police battling to keep the \ncountryside safe, say campaigners.\n\nSome 20,260 people responded to the survey, which was organised by the National Rural Crime Network. The \nfindings, to be published next month, will be sent to Home Office minister Nick Hurd, who allocates police funding to \nfight crime and anti-social behaviour.\n\nSee also: Farm security advice to combat rural crime\n\nNetwork chairman Julia Mulligan, who addressed an NFU Council meeting this week, said: \u201cMinisters are in no \ndoubt of my view on this issue. The funding formula for police forces does not recognise the costs of policing rural \nareas. This needs to change.\u201d\n\nUnder pressure\n\nMs Mulligan, who is also police and crime commissioner for North Yorkshire, added: \u201cProviding services across \nlarge, sparsely populated geographical areas is expensive and, as resources come under greater pressure, this is \nbecoming even more challenging.\u201d\n\nKey challenges faced by rural police forces are not properly reflected in government funding decisions, Ms Mulligan \ntold the NFU meeting at Stoneleigh on Tuesday (19 June). The survey results would provide evidence of this \u2013 \nensuring the voices of farmers affected by crime were heard by government ministers.\n\nMany rural constabularies are doing what they can on limited resources. In Northumberland, for example, police are \nworking with the National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Unit and the Plant and Agriculture National Intelligence Unit to \ncombat agricultural machinery theft.\n\nStretched all the time\n\nLincolnshire police deputy chief constable Craig Naylor, who is also the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for \nrural crime, said: \u201cWe are stretched all the time, so we look at the threat, the harm and the risk that we face, and we \nprioritise.\u201d\n\nRural crime was a priority for Lincolnshire police, which served a large rural county, said Mr Naylor. Rural \nchallenges included hare-coursing, fly-tipping and farm theft, which were all growing problems, he said.\n\nRecommendations from the last National Rural Crime Survey \u2013 carried out in 2015 \u2013 had fair funding as one of its \npriorities for change. But three years on, Ms Mulligan said the challenge for rural police forces remains.\n\nHidden crimes\n\nIt was vital that the needs of rural communities were not overlooked by the Home Office, said Ms Mulligan. \u201cI hope \nthe minister recognises that this situation cannot go on and that rural communities deserve better,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nThe Home Office says its funding formula is based on a range of factors. It says police are seeing more complex \ncrimes being reported, including previously hidden crimes such as child sexual exploitation and modern slavery \u2013 \nand forces must respond to terrorist threats too.\n\nHome Office minister Nick Hurd has said that providing funding certainty over the next two years to enable the \npolice to plan in an efficient way is his priority. Proposed changes to the funding formula will therefore be revisited in \nthe 2019 spending review.\n\nMake your voice count\n\nPolice say all crime should be reported \u2013 no matter how trivial. Only then will the true extent of the challenges faced \nby rural communities be revealed \u2013 and the necessary resources deployed to combat crime in the countryside.\n\nFarmers are urged to liaise with their local police and crime commissioner, who is elected to make sure local police \nmeet the needs of the communities they serve. Commissioners should be contacted about how areas are policed \nand the police budget.\n\n\u201cIntelligence and information is really important,\u201d said the National Rural Crime Network's Julia Mulligan. \u201cIf the \npolice don't know about it, they can't do anything about it.\n\n\u201cIf something happens, let the police know. We know from our last survey that people are so fed up with the \nresponse they get that they think there is no reason to report an incident. But if we don't have the evidence of what \nis happening, we can't put the resources there.\"\n\nRural crime blights farmers' lives across the UK\n\n \n\nFly-tipping is daily occurrence in Hertfordshire\n\nWaste is illegally dumped every day on farmland in Hertfordshire \u2013 but little is done to reprimand the culprits, says \nlocal grower Will Dickinson, of Cross Farm, Harpenden.\n\n\u201cIt is utterly dispiriting beyond belief,\u201d he says. \u201cI suffer fly-tipping crime every single day of the week. Why should I, \nas a member of the public, have to suffer crime? Every single day somebody chucks some rubbish on my farm.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, more than 120 fridges were dumped on surrounding farmland and by rural roads. Seven fridges \nwere left in a single field \u2013 with dozens more abandoned on grass verges and in the surrounding area.\n\nMr Dickinson says he caught some of the fly-tippers red-handed. But he says they were let off by local police, who \narrived on the scene but didn't know what to do.\n\nHeavy losses from livestock rustling in Dorset\n\nSheep have gone missing in Dorset almost every week for the past eight weeks \u2013 stolen by livestock rustlers, says \nlocal farmer James Cossins.\n\nMr Cossins, who farms at Tarrant Rawston, Blandford Forum, says he gets on well with local police. But he adds: \n\u201cMost of those sheep then go out of the county \u2013 and there seems to be little co-operation or communication with \n[police in] other counties as to where they go.\n\n\u201cWe are looking to put tracers either on or in the sheep so we have some idea where they do end up, but we need \nsome sort of support for it. We've also asked traffic officers late at night if they see a cattle lorry or trailers being \ntowed to stop and ask them what they are doing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe problem is that many police officers don't realise the need for movement licenses or livestock passports \u2013 and \ndon't ask the right questions, says Mr Cossins.\n\n'Siege mentality' as travellers camp in Essex\n\nA 70% increase in illegal traveller encampments since 2015 has sparking concern in Essex, says farmer Robert \nStacey.\n\n\u201cLast year, we had 365 encampments on private property \u2013 mostly farmland,\u201d says Mr Stacey, who farms near \nChelmsford. Police do their best, but \u201cit leads to a siege mentality across the county, with gateways barricaded\u201d, he \nadds.\n\nAfter one encampment was set up last year, Mr Stacey says police immediately visited local households and \nadvised them to make sure any property was locked and secure. \u201cObviously, they know there is going to be \ntrouble,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cFor farmers, it is a frustration and the mess that is left behind, you have to clear up. Often it contains human \nexcrement. It is unjust that one section of society appears to be beyond the law at the moment.\u201d\n\nHare-coursers run amok in Lincolnshire\n\nA police policy of seizing dogs from hare-coursers has helped to ease the pressure that the illegal sport puts on \nfarmers \u2013 but the problem persists, says Lincolnshire grower Mark Leggott.\n\n\u201cThese people are so brazen \u2013 they are coming into our fen five times a week,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know them by their \nfirst names, they say good morning as they go past and carry on with their hare-coursing.\u201d\n\nThe fines imposed by the courts are not enough to act as a deterrent, says Mr Leggott. \u201cThey just laugh and say \nwe'll be back tomorrow. Why can't we have three strikes and you're out? They don't have to come coursing.\u201d\n\nMr Leggott says he understands why the Home Office is opposed to custodial sentences. But he says it is getting to \nthe point where prison is the only option.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFarmers are being urged to take extra care when working near overhead power lines in a bid to reduce potentially \nfatal incidents on farms.\n\nThe annual \u201cLook out, look up\u201d electricity safety campaign was launched at the Cereals event this month, ahead of \nthe busy harvest season.\n\nAccording to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), the agriculture industry is statistically the most dangerous \nindustry, claiming the lives of about 30 people in farm accidents each year.\n\nSee also: 10 shortcuts that could kill you at harvest time\n\nThe Energy Networks Association, which organises the annual campaign says one or two people die each year \nfrom electrocution caused by touching power lines with machinery.\n\nIn addition, there were also 1,140 near-miss incidents involving machinery and equipment contacting overhead \nelectric power lines where serious injury or death was a possibility in the past five years.\n\nBigger machinery\n\n\nEvery year there are accidents involving power lines on farms \u2013 all of which are totally avoidable Phil Latham, NFU \nCheshire\n\nIn recent years, farm machinery has become bigger and taller and dangers can occur during ploughing, using \nirrigation pipes and ladders, loading or unloading vehicles, using combine harvesters, tipper wagons or trailers in \nfields and stacking materials.\n\nCheshire dairy farmer and NFU Cheshire county chairman Phil Latham, said: \u201cEvery year there are accidents \ninvolving power lines on farms \u2013 all of which are totally avoidable.\n\n\u201cMy advice to my fellow farmers in the region is firstly make sure everyone knows where the lines crossing your \nland are.\n\n\u201cThis means the farmer, their staff and visitors \u2013 especially delivery drivers and harvest staff.

He regularly \nsupplies Warburtons, Budweiser and Weetabix.\n\nMost crops are grown on contract or with a premium agreed prior to sowing. He likes to start harvest about 50-60% \nsold. \n\nBudgeting and benchmarking against other heavy clay farms is carried out with a farm business consultant to get a \ngood focus on business costs and margins. Machines are costed individually so running costs can quickly be \nassessed.\n\nThe move to no-till means crops are established for about \u00a360/ha including rolling and occasional mole draining, \ncompared with \u00a3135/ha for the conventional approach.\n\nMost of the farm work is carried out by Andrew and one full-time employee, with regular seasonal help. Overheads \nhave been trimmed by Andrew taking on work that the farm\u2019s land agent would traditionally have done \u2013 for \nexample, negotiating lease terms for a 32MW solar park.\n\nAn annual health and safety review is run by a consultant, with staff encouraged to take the lead.\n\nAndrew is responsible for farm strategy and investment and meets informally once a week with the estate\u2019s owner, \nwith quarterly management meetings held to report on performance against budget.\n\nThe farm entered ELS in 2011, followed by a Countryside Stewardship agreement in 2017, with 10% of the land \nnow in environmental options. \u201cThis, coupled with our cover crops and zero till, is providing a great environment for \nwildlife,\u201d says Andrew.\n\n \n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var \ni=\"InfogramEmbeds\",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?\"http:\":\"https:\";if(/^\\/{2}/.test(s)&&(\ns=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var \na=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,\"script\",\"infogram-\nasync\",\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\");\n\n \n\nTechnology and innovation\n\nA further step towards full conservation agriculture brought sheep back into the arable rotation last autumn, with a \nlocal grazier bringing his flock to cover crops.\n\nAndrew is improving the management of 80ha of traditional woodland, securing a grant for a forwarding trailer to \nsupply timber for chipping to fuel a biomass boiler, which heats a large house, hall and function room.\n\nNitrogen fertiliser is being reduced by 10% each year, replaced with other sources of nutrients including digestate. \nAndrew also hosts fungicide trials every year and this year\u2019s new combine with on-board weighing will give more \naccurate data from the trials.\n\nIn 2015 he stopped using insecticides and believes the business is no worse off for it.\n\n\nLooking ahead\n\nAndrew\u2019s five-year plan is to continue increasing non-farming income, with the conversion of an old piggery to \nindustrial units his latest project.\n\nRecent machinery investments have set the farm up well, with some spare capacity so no significant fixed cost \nincreases are expected for the next few years. Over that period, reliance on pesticides and other artificial inputs will \nbe further reduced. \n\nKeeping a tight rein on all costs, Andrew aims to be well-placed when a new agricultural policy is introduced.\n\nJudges liked\n\nDiversified to reduce risk and improve financial sustainability\n\nVery active in welcoming public, promoting wider understanding of farming and food production\n\nAdopts new techniques\n\nGood understanding of soil health, recently introduced livestock into arable rotation\n\nAdds value through end-user contracts\n\nWhat the judges say\n\n\u201cAndrew is proactive over many of the risks to the business, including Brexit. He has reduced costs through \nadopting conservation agriculture and his excellent public engagement shows he is a real ambassador for the \nindustry.\u201d\n\n Mike Shapland, James Foskett Farms, Bromeswell, Suffolk\n\nMultiple parcels of land across a wide area, high-risk organic cropping and managing more than 20 full-time and up \nto 60 seasonal workers \u2013 these are daily challenges for Mike.\n\nIn eight years since joining James Foskett Farms, Mike has dramatically increased the organic enterprise, overseen \na rise in cropped area and huge investment in storage, a workshop and staff facilities.\n\nCarbon footprint is being reduced through 300KW of solar and an Organic Entry Level scheme provides wildlife \nmargins, among other benefits.\n\nFarm facts\n\nDiverse vegetable cropping, some cereals and sugar beet\n\nMain crops \u2013 potatoes, onions and carrots\n\nOrganic potatoes, onions, beetroot, French beans, sweetcorn, butternut squash, beetroot, courgettes\n\nLight, free-draining irrigated grade 4 sandy loam soils; coastal climate allows early season production\n\nMarketing\n\nProfit from high risk crops can fluctuate wildly from season to season. Mike manages price risk by having as much \nas possible on fixed price contracts, and marketing potatoes and onions through a co-op and a producer \norganisation (PO) respectively to add value.\n\nThe ware potatoes are mainly earlies and are 70-75% contracted pre-season.\n\n\n\nMike oversees the marketing of a growing volume of organic produce, including to national box schemes and farm \nshops. The business also has many individual seed potato customers.\n\nOrganic production is also largely priced before planting. The risk here is not in the price but in production volume, \nquality and production costs.\n\nHis attention to detail clearly extends to investing in and empowering his team of 21 full-time and 60 seasonal \nworkers. There have been significant internal promotions to finance manager, irrigation manager and operations \nmanager.\n\nA comprehensive training plan motivates staff, with courses ranging from crop storage to management and \nleadership. Health and safety good practice is integral to day-to-day operations, evidenced by a thorough induction \nprocess.\n\nAn annual outing to Newmarket races, several barbecues and a further trip for the seasonal workers also help with \nmotivation.\n\nStaff meetings at several levels are held regularly where an update is given on the performance of the business, \nplans, and health and safety. Daily texts inform staff of who is working on what and where.\n\nThe nature of operations means that large kit is often moved several hours before normal daytime traffic begins, \nand Mike ensures staff are considerate road users.\n\nThe farm hosts visits for a range of groups, from students to local farmer discussion groups and growers from other \ncountries.\n\n \n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var \ni=\"InfogramEmbeds\",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?\"http:\":\"https:\";if(/^\\/{2}/.test(s)&&(\ns=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var \na=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,\"script\",\"infogram-\nasync\",\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\");\n\nTechnology and innovation\n\nMike drives the capital spending plans for machinery and equipment, with the larger investment decisions such as \nthe recent new store, workshop and staff facilities made in conjunction with his fellow director and employer James \nFoskett.\n\nChanges in technology have driven recent investment \u2013 for example, in a Tillerstar cultivator, which gives better \nquality crops and less damage but without the cost of traditional destoning.\n\nMachinery is mainly owned, with a significant proportion including destoners, tractors and cultivators bought \nsecond-hand\n\nIn-house machinery manufacturing includes a system for in-season injection of liquid fertiliser for potatoes and \nonions, as well as an inter-row gas weed burner, which recently emerged from the workshop and is working well.\n\nMuch has been learned in the conventional side of the business, from going into organics \u2013 far more mechanical \nweeding is now done on the conventional crops than before the organic side was established, says Mike.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nMike is aiming for a 25-35% rise in turnover over the next five years, with continued development of the organic \nenterprise and steady growth in the potato business.\n\n\nHe will also further extend the potatoes and organic areas, taking on new land where it becomes available and fits \nwith the plan.\n\nIf access to non-national seasonal labour becomes more difficult, he would like to employ more local labour but if \nthis is not possible, further mechanisation is likely to result.\n\nJudges liked\n\nPlanned and oversaw significant investment in crop storage\n\nIncreasing proportion of organically produced crops to satisfy customer demand\n\nVery innovative, adapting existing farm machinery or investing in latest technology\n\nFull financial control, strong financial acumen, good understanding of risk and markets\n\nBenchmarks with other growers in group\n\nWhat the judges say\n\n\u201cMike\u2019s excellent attention to detail is shown throughout the business, from crop production to machinery \nmaintenance.

He was promoted to a \nmanager role in 2007 and now oversees all day-to-day farm management, also advising his employers on future \ndevelopment.\n\nThe acreage under his management has grown from 223ha on one farm to 1,675ha in five main locations, including \na 390ha farm in Lincolnshire.\n\nApart from the practical challenges, this brings plenty of paperwork too, with four BPS claims to complete.\n\nSeveral successful Open Farm Sundays have been held and the farm hosts tours for the annual village day. Chris \nregularly takes tractors and other machinery to the local primary school and has also taken lambs to bottle feed at \nschools.  \n\nFarm facts\n\nComplex set-up of four farming businesses\n\nCombinable crops and 250 Mule ewes  \n\nRotation \u2013 winter wheat, some second wheat, spring barley followed by break winter barley had maize too\n\nSoil types range from thin chalk to heavy clay\n\nMarketing\n\n\n\nSome crops are grown on contract for Budweiser, with malting premium achieved on every load. About 40% of the \nexpected tonnage of crops is forward sold before harvest to help with cash flow and risk management, with 20% \ngoing into pools.\n\nMarkets are monitored weekly, with the rest of the crop sold through the year to even out cashflow and avoid \nmarket troughs.  \n\nChris grows seed barley on contract and has also developed a more local market, growing maize and forage crops \nfor a neighbouring 500-cow dairy, an arrangement that began in a small way four years ago. This helps with \nblackgrass control and means the farm has not needed to grow oilseed rape for some years.\n\nA straw for muck agreement alongside this brings valuable solid manure onto the farm, improving fertility, reducing \nfertiliser spend and helping raise soil organic matter.\n\nFour years after Chris joined the business, the existing soft fruit pyo and asparagus enterprises ceased. The 60 \nsuckler cattle also went in 2013, replaced by 150 Mule ewes to graze steep grass banks on chalk land at the home \nfarm in Bledlow.\n\nEwe numbers have since been expanded to 250 with lambs generally sold as stores in August because the chalk \nland cannot hold all the sheep in a dry summer.\n\nManaging agents have been phased out since Chris\u2019s appointment. He runs the 1,285ha Buckinghamshire-based \npart of the businesses with just two full-time staff and one summer helper, involving them in day-to-day decisions.\n\nHis machinery policy runs tractors to between 4,000 and 5,000 hours - too far past that and the drop in residual \nvalue is too great.\n\n \n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var \ni=\"InfogramEmbeds\",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?\"http:\":\"https:\";if(/^\\/{2}/.test(s)&&(\ns=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var \na=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,\"script\",\"infogram-\nasync\",\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\");\n\nTechnology and innovation\n\nGPS kit is used to minimise input use and the drill tractor runs an RTK steering system. \n\nChris has also introduced digestate, which he says works like rocket fuel in spring on thin, chalky soils, making \nnutrients readily available.\n\nAlongside routine maintenance, Chris and his team also adapt and fabricate machinery, building a large two-deck \nsheep transporting box, a grass seed drill and gun bus trailers.\n\nHe marks his biggest achievement as the turnaround of run-down tenanted farms as they come back in hand, \nincreasing productivity and incorporating them into the in-hand farming business.\n\nChris entered all the farms in ELS originally and now has two CSS agreements running.

Last year 90% of the maize \nreceived no artificial fertiliser.\n\nMr Steer said more than half of the land supported a conventional arable rotation of wheat, spring cereals and \noilseed rape, with margins further improved by a focus on premium contracts. \n\nHe said 30% of the first wheat area was grown for milling, with the 10-year yield average standing at 9.5t/ha and \nhagberg levels peaking at 340.\n\nChallenges being tackled\n\nDespite being a significantly sized arable enterprise, the farm\u2019s average field size is still only a modest 5.5ha, which \nmeans about 20% of the cropping area is headland.\n\nMr Steer said this had encouraged a strategy of reducing tillage, which had to be balanced against the need to \nretain cultural controls such as ploughing to assist with grassweed control.\n\n \n\n\n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var

fields have been targeted by repeat cropping with winter barley for forage, which has reduced \nseeds in the soil profile by ensiling the crop before the plants mature.\n\nOn the dairy front, tackling Johne\u2019s disease has proved a significant headache, with the farm having implemented a \nstrict snatch calfing regime and culling high-risk individuals.\n\nFurther losses have been incurred by the closed herd after it recently suffered its first TB outbreak, and measures \nto keep badgers away from feedstocks have been improved.\n\nWhat do they do best?\n\nThe business has limited the difficulty of finding the right staff by having an outstanding retention rate of 15-20 years \nfor full-time workers.\n\nNew workers can progress through a four-tier pay system, which starts at the voluntary living wage, by learning new \nskills, and all staff have the opportunity of accommodation in estate housing.\n\nNevertheless, with 50% of the staff coming from elsewhere in the EU, the managers rank poorer access to labour \nas the second biggest threat to the business after milk price volatility.\n\nThe judges liked:\n\nClear and measurable objectives\n\nStrong awareness of costs

Brownlee, Loughgall, Armagh\n\nDriving the narrow council roads that divide the 141ha that Matthew Brownlee manages in partnership with his \nfamily, there is little sign of the technologically advanced business that is set in the rolling green countryside, but a \nvisit soon reveals the truth.\n\nFour efficient, cash-generating enterprises are spread across the relatively modest area, with two \u2013 robot-milked \ndairy cows and pig finishing \u2013 added since he returned from studying Agricultural Technology at Queen's University \nBelfast.\n\nAnother, cattle finishing, has been scaled up to allow year-round sales by adding bought-in calves to compliment \nthose produced by the suckler herd, with the traditional County Armagh industry of apple-growing completing the \nset.\n\nShape of the business\n\n\nIdentifying an improvement in cashflow as one of the key objectives needed for growth and securing access to \nfinance, each of the enterprises has been carefully managed to bring regular income into the business.\n\nWith the infrastructure already in place for cattle finishing thanks to a suckler herd of Limousin x Angus cattle, \nbuying in calves to bulk up numbers was a low-risk early strategy.\n\nFarm facts\n\nMinimal machinery policy built on idea that if the animals are done right then other people can be paid to do the \ntractor work\n\nThree cuts of silage per year plus round bales taken off any paddocks where grass has run ahead of cattle\n\nCattle are mostly bedded on woodchip\n\nThe operation now sells 650 finished cattle a year, with the objective being to sell on a weekly basis.\n\nSelling into Dunbia\u2019s nearby Dungannon plant also provided the opportunity to be a part of the Co-op\u2019s \u201cTruly \nIrresistible\u201d beef producer group, which has earned a premium by switching to a Hereford bull.\n\nWith the all-grassland farm fully stocked, future growth could only come from indoor enterprises \u2013 and the pig \nfinishing enterprise was therefore next on the agenda, with the first shed completed in 2015 and another completed \nrecently.\n\nThe operation works with JMW Farms, which supplies pigs at about 40kg and all inputs apart from the shed, water, \nelectricity and labour, taking animals  through to finishing.\n\nMr Brownlee says he is paid a flat rate for each kilo added, regardless of market price, describing the system as \nproviding as close to financial certainty as is possible in farming.\n\nChallenges being tackled\n\nDairy cows arrived on the farm earlier this year, with the robot milker up and running just as the snow fell in \nFebruary.\n\nThe new enterprise is offering a steep learning curve, as Mr Brownlee freely admits to having only limited dairy \nexperience previously.\n\nHe credits the Lely robot, installed at a cost of some \u00a3130,000, with being useful not only at milking, but also for \nheat detection and reducing antibiotic use as it can pick up udder health issues before clinical signs are apparent.\n\nIt can cope with some 2,000kg of milk a day, and Mr Brownlee said he aimed to run it as near to capacity as \npossible year-round, with his entire 43-cow herd on the system at the moment and more freshly calved cows added \nas the earlier arrivals dry off.\n\nElsewhere on the farm he is improving his grass utilisation to make sure cattle grass at the right growth stage to \nmaximise performance.  \n\nHe is also looking to streamline handling by replacing more of the data he is currently recording on paper with \nelectronic recording.\n\nWhat do they do best?\n\nMr Brownlee has proven that the limited access to land in Northern Ireland is no barrier to increasing turnover and \nprofitability.\n\n\n\nBy being willing to put together credible financial plans in order to access the significant finance necessary to add \nnew enterprises, he has shown that a can-do attitude and a head for figures, as well as a supportive family, can \nbring about real change in a surprisingly short amount of time.\n\n \n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var

His focus on enterprises that \naren\u2019t reliant on subsidy means he is well placed for a potential hard Brexit.\u201d\n\n  \n\nDavid Bell, Fairfield Farm, Colinsburgh, Fife\n\nBlowing sand may not be a problem uppermost in the minds of many Scottish farmers, but keeping soil in fields is \ncertainly uppermost in the mind of beef and arable farmer David Bell.\n\nHe farms more than 1200ha around the village of Colinsburgh in Fife, with some of the lightest land In Scotland \nrunning from the north bank of the Firth of Forth up to heavier land some 600 feet above sea level.\n\nWorking in partnership with his family and with a workforce of six staff, this technically challenging mix of owned, \nrented and contract farmed land turns out premium-earning produce ranging from Aberdeen Angus beef to salad \npotatoes and malting barley for Scotch whisky and lager.\n\nShape of the business\n\nThe 400-strong herd of suckler cows is firmly integrated in the arable rotation by grazing short-term grass leys, with \ncosts kept as low as possible by outwintering and calving many outdoors.\n\nThe closed herd is moving closer to pure bloodlines after a policy of retaining Aberdeen Angus-sired heifers from \nthe formerly Simmental-cross dams and returning them to top quality Angus bulls.\n\nWeaned youngstock get a second summer at grass before being housed for finishing on barley silage with a protein \nadditive, with a goal of slaughtering at 24 months.\n\nWhile lighter land is an asset for many beef businesses as it lowers input costs and reduces labour requirements, \nMr Bell says the land would actively suffer in the absence of livestock as the manure binds the light sand and feeds \nthe nutrient-hungry soil.\n\n\nGreener patches are clearly visible in following barley crops where there have been urine patches, and a light \ncoating of farmyard manure is often used to bind soil following crop establishment.\n\nFarm facts\n\nFocus on improving headlands to drive yield has seen switch to liquid fertiliser to get nutrition right to the edge of \nfields without polluting hedgerows\n\nNutrient mapping has been deployed to allow variable rate applications of lime, phosphate and potash\n\nCrops are forward marketed where possible to reduce risk and improve income\n\nThe 710ha of land in arable rotation includes 50ha of salad and prepacked ware potatoes destined for supermarket \nshelves.\n\nWhile labour intensive, this helps to spread workloads.\n\nSalad potatoes start being harvested around the end of July along with early maincrop varieties, before the focus \nturns to harvesting the 540ha of cereals, beginning with winter barley and then moving into winter wheat and \nspring malting barley.\n\nChallenges being tackled\n\nThe wide variety of soil types across the cropping area has also been turned from a challenge to a positive by \nenabling autumn and spring cultivations to take place over a wider window.\n\nThis has been further increased by a machinery policy of keeping tractor size down and running them on the \nmaximum size tyre possible to keep compaction to a minimum.\n\nPotato headlands, which get a hammering from regular machinery traffic and cause lower yields in following cereal \ncrops, are also being planted with clover mixes which reduce the impact of wheelings and reduce the need for \ninputs by increasing available nitrogen.\n\nWhat do they do best?\n\nA continual drive for self-improvement is enabling Mr Bell to unlock benefits for his business, with BASIS and \nFACTS qualifications allowing him to better hold suppliers to account.\n\nSimilarly, by allowing Adas to hold on-farm trials, sitting on a number of AHDB committees, and being a member of \nhis local NFU Scotland branch, he feels he is able to stay abreast of developments in on-farm best practice and \nagricultural policy.\n\nMr Bell is also a supporter of the Royal Scottish Agricultural Benevolent Institution, describing the time given up \nvolunteering and helping with campaigns as giving back to the industry which has given him so much.\n\nThe judges liked:\n\nUtilising challenging land to produce premium-yielding crops and cattle\n\nCosts of production lowered and soils improved by out-wintering cattle\n\nReal desire to learn and incorporate new farming practices\n\nWhat the judges say:\n\n\u201cDavid has risen to the challenge of producing a healthy profit from a highly complex yet integrated business which \nblends multiple enterprises running across land with many different owners.\u201d\n\n\n\n \n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var

Marmite subject. Most farmers have one, but actually don\u2019t enjoy owning or driving it.\n\nThey tend to be expensive to buy, loud to drive and can struggle with the harsh realities of daily farm toil.\n\nIn winter they are cold and \u2013 if you scrimp on the option of doors \u2013 leave drivers exposed to whatever the skies \nhave to offer.\n\nTry searching for a viable replacement for the UTV and the pickings are slim, unless you go for the even more \nopen-air feel of a quad bike and trailer.\n\nSee also: Custom-built Zuki Ute is warmer ATV alternative\n\nHowever, the Zuki Ute featured in the 15 December 2017 issue of Farmers Weekly showed a farmer-converted \nSuzuki Jimny, which attracted lots of interest from FW readers asking where to buy one.\n\nSo, when Paul Short, owner of TP4x4, got in touch, we were keen to find out what he was up to.\n\nFor him, the catalyst for his creation was being asked by a local fencing contractor to convert a Suzuki Jimny into a \nfence-post-carrying 4x4, capable of staying afloat in a soggy bog.\n\nMr Short has been involved in off-road car rallying for more than 30 years, so he knows a thing or two about \nadapting cars to fit his needs.\n\nHe has also designed, built and sold more than 2,500 Land Rover Discovery bumpers and accessories across the \nworld.\n\nSince the first Jimny rolled out of the doors he has received more enquiries, and in October 2017 full production \nkicked into life.\n\nSo far, 15 Jimnys have been converted into two-seat trucks with a UTV-sized rear load bed.\n\nWe visited TP4x4 to find out how they transform a small four-wheel drive into a go-anywhere, load-lugging vehicle.\n\nChoose your colour\n\nThe early decisions are pretty simple. Buyers will need to choose how much lift they want the vehicle\u2019s suspension \nto have \u2013 either a 2in or 3in raise \u2013 and if they require flotation tyres, as this option needs boy-racer-style flared \narches on the front.\n\n\nThe other choice early on is what colour the Terramaxx should be. Mr Short is happy to spray the trucks any colour \nthe customer desires, with previous models having a camouflage vinyl wrap and a stealth paint job.\n\nThe firm converts both new- and old-model Jimnys running the 1.3-litre VVTI engine, and Mr Short likes to source \nthe cars himself to have control over their condition and what should be avoided, although customer-owned projects \nare taken on, too.\n\n\u201cWhen you work with a vehicle, you get to know the good and bad points. The earlier Jimny models, from 1998 to \n2005, have a manual lever to engage 4WD and a stronger transfer box,\u201d says Mr Short.\n\n\u201cThe newer models have dash-mounted buttons to select 4WD and a cleaner design. Spanish company Santana \nMotors built the convertibles and the engines were the older single-cam variants, which aren\u2019t as good\u201d.\n\nThe build\n\nStage 1 \u2013 Stripped back\n\nOnce an order is placed and a vehicle sourced, the team set about chopping the rear end off and removing the two \nback seats to convert the Jimny into a two-seater and make space for a load bed.\n\nThis involves using the original horizontal roof brace and uprights that surround the rear door and remounting them \nbehind the two front seats.\n\nThis way the shape of the Jimny is maintained by using original parts, without costly fabrication of new bits.\n\nA strengthened twin-layer steel bulkhead is welded in behind the front seats, with a full-width window that is heated \nas standard.\n\nSteel is used rather than fibreglass for extra strength, which in turn allows the seat belt and body mounts to be \nbeefed up to MOT standards.\n\nAll the glass in then removed, corners smoothed and the cab shell, along with the bonnet and wings, are sent away \nto a local paint shop for a final sand and spray.\n\nThe remaining body is then attached to a two-post car ramp and stripped back to the bare chassis, with axles, \nexhaust, engine and transfer box being removed.\n\nStage 2 \u2013 Full service\n\nThe naked Jimny\u2019s frame is sanded and any repairs carried out before a layer of anti-corrosive coating is applied to \nprotect the metalwork from rust or corrosion.\n\nThis also puts a solid barrier in the way for any rocks or debris that may come into contact with it.\n\nThe axles are stripped back with new bearings, king pins and seals fitted on all corners, while the brakes are also \ntreated to new pads and discs all round, with any worn or broken parts replaced.\n\nNot all Jimnys left the factory with all-round disc brakes, so TP4x4 offers a conversion kit to have a set of shiny \ndiscs. Although the team don\u2019t touch an engine rebuild project, it is given a spruce-up, too.\n\n\u201cThe engine has a full service and clean, dropping out all fluids and resiting a few parts, such as centrally mounting \nthe intercooler from its original position under the front light on the diesel models, so our custom-made bumper fits,\u201d \nsays Mr Short.\n\n\u201cThe engine bay has a clean-up and a lick of paint, along with a new radiator, battery, a new exhaust front to back \nand even new wiper blades.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile the cab is off, the transfer box is removed and given a check over for any engineering gremlins and instead of \nrefitting it on the brittle aluminium mounts, some replica steel ones slot straight into the existing holes.\n\nElectrics\n\nAlong with spray painting, wiring is the only other outsourced job, which is completed by a local auto electrician.\n\nThis begins when the chassis is bare and all unwanted wires are removed and the majority are rerouted to better \npositions.\n\nThe old rear lights wiring used to sit on the outside of the chassis, held on by little clips.\n\nMr Short reroutes these wires through the centre of the chassis to keep them clean and protected from damage.\n\nThe rear LED lights and number plate marker are on a pre-made board, which attaches to the Terramaxx with a \nwaterproof plug providing the power.\n\nAt this stage, if the customer wants some spotlights on the front or a control switch in the cab for a slug pelleter on \nthe back, the wires are installed to make mounting the equipment later much easier.\n\nStage 3 \u2013 Rebuild\n\nWhen the cab is bottled back on, the job of screwing it all back together begins and every nut and bolt that was \nundone is replaced with a new one.\n\nAfter the engine and gearbox have been fitted, the refurbished axles are bolted on along with a castor arm \ncorrection kit to rotate the axle back into its original position (if the Jimny has had a 3in lift) using the same mounting \nholes.\n\n\u201cFor the suspension, we use heavy-duty adjustable Panard rods,\u201d explains Mr Short.\n\n\u201cPro-comp shocks beef up the suspension, along with some equally hefty Pro-comp black springs, which are \noverengineered and rated to 400kg capacity.\u201d\n\nEach wheel arch is given the anti-corrosion paint job before the laser-made powder-coated rims and tyres, along \nwith an in-house-built front bumper, complete the running gear rebuild.\n\nInside the cab, the metal area is treated to some professionally upholstered black soundproofing, similar to a \ncamper van, which not only keeps the occupants warm but also has a classier feel than bare metal or cheap plastic.\n\nRear load bed\n\nThere are many options for the rear load bed and it\u2019s up to the customer to spec it to their needs. As standard is a \nUTV-style back, with a drop-down rear and cushioning on the locking pins.\n\nInside, all the beds are covered in anti-corrosion paint to keep them free of dents and scratches.\n\nA tipping unit is available, as is the option to have greedy boards to pack more gear in.\n\nHowever, Mr Short reckons payloads are about the 400kg mark.\n\nFour lashing points are standard but, as the build takes place in-house, any special mounting points or external \nhooks can be added.\n\nThere\u2019s also the option of an aluminium hood to keep the dog dry.\n\n\n\nIf pure off-roading is the destination for the Terramaxx, extras fitted in the past include a winch, beefier transfer box \nand air-locking 4x4.\n\nDiesel option\n\nFarmers will undoubted be slightly put off by the fact they have to fill the tank with petrol from the local garage \nrather than using a drop of cherry from the tank on the farm.\n\nMr Short is keen to solve this conundrum and imports diesel Jimnys from France, although the imported cost bumps \nup the final purchase price and takes it above an equivalent UTV.\n\nThere is also the small issue of driving a left-hooker in the UK, which not everyone is comfortable with.\n\nAnother option is to build a right-hand-drive diesel Jimny, getting rid of the standard 1.3-litre petrol and fitting a \ndiesel block instead.\n\nMr Short plans to fasten a 1.5-litre diesel engine from a French manufacturer into one of his next vehicles, and at \nthe time of our visit he was adapting a flywheel and clutch pack to marry the Jimny\u2019s current running gear to the \nnew engine.\n\nIf this emerges successfully, it will undoubtedly be the most popular farm-ready version, while there\u2019s also a six-\nwheel-drive model planned for its maiden outing at the Great Yorkshire Show in July, which is bound to get some \ninterest from passers-by.\n\nPricing and DVLA\n\nThere are four options of Terramaxx, with varying degrees of engineering complexity. Option one starts at about \n\u00a37,995, which is a basic service, tyres, bumper and pickup conversion.\n\nFor a base price of \u00a313,950, option four has all the bells and whistles, with a 3in lift and very little remaining from \nthe original Jimny.\n\nThere are also two mid-spec options, but Mr Short is happy to fill whatever requests he gets, within reason.\n\nHowever, the caveat for both of these prices is how much the original vehicle costs. Any imported vehicle will \ncommand a premium, as will a right-hand-drive diesel conversion, or a modern petrol model with low mileage.\n\nAs a parting gift, Mr Short offers to register the vehicle modifications with the DVLA, such as alterations from a four- \nto a two-seater truck and colour changes. This is then logged on the V5 along with agricultural registration, if the \ncustomer requires.\n\nHe is also in talks with the NFU about recognising the Jimny for its new worth rather than what its previous number \nplate would indicate.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nWarwickshire farmer and agricultural contractor Chris Gardner usually drives a Fendt tractor for customers across \nthe Midlands and beyond, but for 75 days each year he has another job \u2013 a technician and driver assistant for a top \nmotor-racing team.\n\nStrange though it may seem, he got into the world of racing after getting his HGV licence in 2003.\n\nHe was doing general haulage at the time, until a team his father was working for as a timekeeper was looking for a \ndriver to take their race truck to European circuits \u2013 and Chris bagged the job.\n\nSee also: Farm-spec Suzuki Jimny challenges UTV domination\n\n\n\nBefore long he was headhunted by a competitor, working his way through numerous roles and teams until the 2008 \nglobal financial crisis bit, forcing motorsport teams to dive on to the brakes and cut back.\n\nThis, at least, presented Chris with an opportunity to return home to focus on farming.

It will have to concede more on tariff reductions, given that current UK tariffs \u2013 \nespecially on food \u2013 are generally higher than US tariffs.\n\n\u201cDefra is filled with rabid free traders who will sell us aspects of a better deal that will hurt agriculture.\u201d\n\nSenior board member at the Food Standards Agency\n\nIt also suggest the UK will have to go further than the 97.5% tariff reduction offered by the EU in the recent \nTransatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations, \u201cgiven the smaller scale of opportunity the UK \nmarket offers\u201d.\n\nUS objectives\n\n\u201cFor the US, removing or sharply reducing tariffs on agricultural products will be a key objective,\u201d says the report.\n\n\u201cHowever, while consumers would certainly see lower prices, opening the UK market to much cheaper US food, \nproduced under what is perceived to be lower health and environmental standards, could destroy large parts of \nBritish farming and face intense consumer resistance.\u201d\n\nThe report quotes a senior board member at the Food Standards Agency as saying: \u201cThose of us in agriculture feel \nvulnerable that we will be sacrificed in exchange for a better deal in services. Defra is filled with rabid free-traders \nwho will sell us aspects of a better deal that will hurt agriculture.\u201d\n\nUS demands\n\nKey \u201casks\u201d from the US are likely to include relaxation of regulations on labelling, food safety and use of genetically \nmodified organisms.\n\n\u201cSuch demands will almost certainly spark strong public opposition in the UK, illustrated by the already intense \nconcern about possible imports of chlorine-washed chicken,\u201d says the report.\n\nIt quotes a senior UK government official as saying: \u201cDefra has made it clear they will not accept a deal which \nlowers food standards for the sake of a deal.\u201d\n\nAnother sticking point is that the UK has already indicated it will adhere to large swathes of EU regulation, to secure \naccess to that market, and this will limit the scope for any free-trade deal with the US.\n\nAffordable, not cheap\n\nBut sustainable farming group Sustain is concerned that other interests may come to the fore. \n\n\"The report is clear on risks all round and trade secretary Liam Fox is mistaken if he thinks British people want to \ntrade away food standards,\" said Sustain's campaign co-ordinator, Vicki Hird.\n\n\n\n\"We need affordable food, not \u2018cheap\u2019 food,\" she said. \"Cheap, poor-quality, imported food will come at a cost \u2013 to \nthe farmer or food producer, to animal welfare, to the environment or jobs in UK food and farming. \n\n\"Our UK farming industry has worked hard to clean up meat production and while more is needed, we don\u2019t want \ntheir farms and jobs put at risk by competition with cheap, poor-quality and lower-standard imports.\"\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nTime is running out to apply for a place on a farming and rural enterprise training course.\n\nThe deadline for applications to the John Edgar management development scheme, run by the Hampshire-based \nJohn Edgar Trust, is 1 June.\n\nSee also: John Edgar Trust: 40 years on and still going strong\n\nThe trust is dedicated to helping people achieve their potential in farming and rural enterprises throughout southern \nEngland and the course aims to develop individuals working in the rural sector into more effective leaders.\n\nApplications are invited from people who are at an early stage in their career in agriculture or a rural business \nbased in the South, the trust said.\n\nApplicants should already be in a management position or at least show the potential to achieve this in the near \nfuture, the trust added.\n\nAfter the deadline an interview round on 20 June will select 12 people for an award to participate in the course that \nwill then run in early 2019.\n\nAlthough the course is sponsored by the trust, participants will be asked to make a contribution of \u00a3500 towards the \ncost of their training.\n\nHowever, bursaries are available at the discretion of the trustees for individuals who might be unable to pay this. \n\nThe course\n\nThe three-module residential course in rural business management will cover managing people, business practice, \ntaxation and law, media management and leadership.\n\nCourse dates 2019\n\n7-11 January five-day tutored course at the Royal Agricultural University, Cirencester\n\n28-31 January four-day project-based case study module based at the RAU, Cirencester\n\n25-28 February four-day project-based case study module based at a Hampshire Hotel\n\nHow to apply\n\nApplications should be submitted by 1 June 2018.\n\nThe 2018-19 application form is available as a pdf.  \n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFarming businesses are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit new staff, despite the total number of jobs in \nagriculture falling.\n\n\n\nThe most recent figures released by Defra show the total agricultural labour force in the UK in 2017 was estimated \nat 419,000, down 2,000 from the previous year and half of what it was in 1973.\n\nHowever, consultants and farm leaders are warning that competition for jobs is actually in decline, with fewer \napplicants for full-time roles such as herd managers as well as part-time roles like harvest staff.\n\nSee also: Contracts of employment - how to get the basics right\n\nFactors include agricuture's ongoing inability to attract more would-be workers from outside the industry, the flow of \ngood people heading into related food and agri-business roles, and the number of farmworkers now reaching \nretirement age.  \n\nRecruitment experts report that farmers are increasingly having to make compromises when it comes to selecting \nstaff and it is taking longer to fill jobs than it used to. They are also having to offer increasingly generous packages \nto compete to secure the right calibre of candidate, which is driving up their cost base.\n\nIan Lindsay of recruitment business LKL Services said it has \u201cnever been harder\u201d to find the skilled staff necessary \nto work on the UK\u2019s dairy farms and a good herdsman can have their pick of jobs.\n\n\u201cEven four or five years ago you could publish an advert and you would get about a dozen decent CVs.

They are reliable, highly repeatable and \naccurate.\u201d\n\nThe results\n\nIn this latest study, the higher carcass weights of the 2016-born bull calves from the top 1% index bull were 10.6kg \nheavier than progeny from the top 10% bull.\n\nThis was worth an extra \u00a342 a head at a base carcass price of \u00a33.50/kg, taking into account penalties for heavy \nweights.\n\nMr Marsh describes the performance of the calves from both Simmental bulls as \u201coutstanding\u201d with carcass weights \nof 371.9kg-382.5kg at just 380 days.\n\n\u201cThis smashes the AHDB Beef & Lamb target for intensively finishing suckler bulls of a 350kg carcass at 14 months \nold,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nThe bulls were finished at just over 12 months old.\n\n\u201cThis almost produces a \u2018cycle of perfection\u2019 with the old calf being slaughtered when the new one is born,\u201d adds Mr \nMarsh.\n\nThis is the seventh study carried out by Harper Adams to compare the performance of progeny from bulls with \ndifferent terminal indexes.\n\n\u201cAll seven have shown that with bulls with reasonably high levels of accuracy, that EBVs work with significantly \nimproved performance recorded from bulls with better figures,\u201d says Mr Marsh.\n\nThe bulls used in the trial were Dirnanean Bradley (terminal Iindex +137 \u2013 top 1%) and Omorga Volvo (terminal \nindex +93 \u2013 top 10%).\n\nResults showed:\n\nVolvo\u2019s calves recorded heavier birth weights than Bradley\u2019s and an improved calving ease, contrary to the EBVs of \nthe sires\n\nVolvo\u2019s calves also had higher daily liveweight gains (DLWGs) and 200-day weights contrary to Bradley\u2019s better \nEBVs for 200-day weights\n\nHowever, post-weaning calves sired by Bradley overtook those of Volvo\n\nBradley sons finished two days quicker on average and recorded higher DLWGs from weaning to slaughter of \n1.86kg compared with 1.70kg\n\nThis resulted in higher carcass weights for Bradley\u2019s calves \u2013 10.6kg (382.5kg versus 371.9kg)\n\nThe calves sired by Bradley in the 2016 trial were leaner with a fat classification of 3= compared with  3+/4- for \nprogeny from Volvo which mirrors the fat depth EBVs.

Within days of her hearing I was going to be out of action \nfor a few weeks, a large parcel arrived bearing her distinctive handwriting.\n\nAt first glance, the contents seemed disappointingly mundane: a huge box of coloured pens, and a colouring-in \nbook.\n\nOn further inspection, however, the book turned out to be page after page of obscenities and profanities \u2013 some of \nwhich I\u2019d never heard of.\n\nThe lovely covering letter wished me a speedy recovery and hoped a couple of beautifully coloured-in \u201cf***s\u201d and \n\u201ct**s\u201d would help relieve the frustration of those occasional but inevitable bad days on the long road back to fitness.\n\nSee also: Read more of Charlie Flindt\u2019s columns\n\nWhat Lizzie probably didn\u2019t realise is her present is perfectly timed, because June is prime colouring-in time.\n\nIt\u2019s time to start choosing next year\u2019s cropping, and that means breaking out a freshly photocopied, squeaky-clean \nfarm map and colouring in it.\n\n\u2018A thousand Hampshire diamonds\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s a nice red pen for the easy one \u2013 wheat \u2013 which of course follows the spring beans and the oilseed rape.\n\nBeans (brown pen) and OSR (yellow) will once again be the break crops of choice for next year (following the \nassorted barleys), unless the field is one of our light ones, in which case I dig out the purple pen for peas... and then \npause.\n\nPeas. Every time I grow them, they promise so much. Waist-high in June, strong enough you feel you could lie full \nstretch on them and they\u2019d still support you.\n\nYou\u2019re confident of a two-ton crop and some baled haulm the cattle go wild for.\n\nAnd then the good Lord sends a wet iron through them just before harvest, and you spend a week of what should \nbe wheat harvesting time trying to scrape them \u2013 without a thousand Hampshire diamonds \u2013 off the floor.\n\nBut then I remember the great pigeon decoying, and the fabulous wheat that comes the next year, and commit \npurple pen to paper.\n\nEmpty straw barns\n\nAnd that leaves winter and spring barley to fill in the rest of the farm map in light blue and dark blue.\n\nMost years it\u2019s a juggle between overdoing the spring workload and getting enough winter barley in to set up OSR \nthe next year in full knowledge that winter barley rarely pays its way.\n\nThat\u2019s all changed this year, though. Winter barley is having a spectacular revival. Not long ago, we were selling it \noff the combine for \u00a348/t, and chopping in the unwanted straw.\n\n\n\nHow circumstances have changed. Demand for good old bog-standard feed barley remains high, and we all know \nabout the nation\u2019s empty straw barns.\n\nThe dark blue winter barley pen can rampage its away across the map with a clear conscience.\n\nOf course, the daft thing is even after all that majestic colouring in, even after the seed has been ordered and \nstockpiled at the back of the barn, and the dear old Horsch CO3 has gobbled up another couple of tubes of grease \nin eager anticipation, the whole cropping plan can change.\n\nIf the good Lord feels October, November and December would once again be the best time to top up the water \ntable, there\u2019s diddly squat we can do about it \u2013 except get the colouring pens out, and another blank farm map, and \nstart again.\n\nI could also dig out Lizzie\u2019s Book of Obscenities, and carefully and therapeutically work my way through another \ncouple of \u201cd******ds\u201d, \u201cd*******gs\u201d and a mysterious\u201cg****ls\u201d. God knows what they are, but they\u2019ll make me feel \nbetter anyway. \n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nReasons why we love farming, number 56: continuity. Half a century ago, I got a new bicycle. It was a Raleigh, it \nwas blue and silver, and I was pleased as punch with it.\n\nI set up a simple loop round the farm buildings to enjoy its performance.\n\nFrom the back door, I followed the track past the estate yard and workshop, complete with its creosote tank and \nmassive sawbench, where Lord Sherborne\u2019s carpenters and workmen made doors, windows and fence posts for \nthe houses and farms of his village.\n\nSee also: Read more of Charlie Flindt\u2019s columns\n\nI flew past the brand-new block of garages, put up in the early sixties by His Lordship as a response to these new-\nfangled motorcars which his tenants were buying and parking untidily on the roadsides.\n\nUnfortunately, each garage\u2019s dimensions were based on accommodating an Austin A40. Within a decade, they \nwere useless.\n\nThen it was round the left-hand bend, past the little cottage where the Debenhams lived; \u201cMrs Deb\u201d was my \nmother\u2019s \u201chelp\u201d.\n\nHer unwritten job description covered everything from cooking and cleaning to having me to stay when my parents \nwent on holiday. Memories are clear of having a \u201cbath\u201d in her old-fashioned kitchen sink.\n\nJim-jams and crutches\n\nAnother left bend took me on to the public road \u2013 always a source of worry for my mother, but this was in the days \nbefore the National Trust arrived, before the M3 brought the Londoners down, and when sleepy little Hinton Ampner \nwas all but unknown.\n\nThe road dropped downhill, I could pick up speed and sweep back into the farmyard \u2013 taking care not to lean over \ntoo much in the brand-new gravel that had just been laid \u2013 and start the loop again, and again, and again, as fast \nas possible.\n\nFifty years on, my pace is somewhat slower. I\u2019m not on the bicycle, although I\u2019m sure it could be found somewhere \nin one of the old barns and sheds if I looked hard enough.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m in my jim-jams and dressing gown, and on two crutches, pushing the new hip as hard as I dare. The route, \nhowever, is identical.\n\nPast the old estate workshop, long silent; many years have passed since the howling three-phase planer could be \nheard finishing a window frame.\n\nThen it\u2019s gently round the massive locked gates \u2013 unheard of and unneeded 50 years ago \u2013 past the now-\ndemolished garages, and gingerly round the bend next to Mrs Deb\u2019s house.\n\nMoral support often arrives from the modern-day residents, and from some of the hordes of National Trust visitors \nbaffled to find a fat farmer in jim-jams hobbling along what is now part of the trust\u2019s round-the-estate walk.\n\nHinton Ampner Who\u2019s Who\n\nThe short stretch of public road is next; infinitely busier than it was in the days when a non-village car was enough \nto get everyone rushing to the windows, and an ear now has to kept open for a trophy wife in an SUV (aka \u201ctwig in a \nbox\u201d) hurtling nonsensically through the over-lush June lanes.\n\nThere\u2019s a short, steep and challenging climb up the drive, over crumbling tarmac, and into the farmyard again.\n\nNo danger of slipping in deep gravel anymore; the last of it was washed down Farm Hill ages ago. Another leisurely \nlap competed.\n\nDear old Mrs Deb would chuckle at the final link over the 50 years. Just before being discharged from hospital, a \nbubbly and utterly professional young nurse was discretely helping me with a fantastically welcome shower.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re from Hinton Ampner?\u201d she asked. \u201cDid you know Mrs Deb?\u201d Of course, I replied. \u201cWell, I\u2019m her \ngranddaughter.\u201d It was the kitchen sink all over again.\n\nNow that\u2019s what I call continuity.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nWhen I\u2019ve perfected my time machine, I\u2019ll be loading it up with glyphosate haters, and travelling back to the mid-\n1980s.\n\nWe\u2019ll visit a heavy Hampshire field, where a Ford 7600 is struggling to tow a Bamlett CD4 through couch-infested \nclay.\n\nThe tightly spaced Suffolk coulters can barely manage half a furlong before the bow wave of rhizomes forces the \nlong-suffering tractor driver to reach under the seat for the spool valve (no wonder his hips are knackered), jack the \ndrill up and do a huge loop on the sown ground, hoping to shake off the sticky mess.\n\nPerhaps we\u2019ll leap forward a few months to the early summer, and watch a 3m cultivator hard at work doing couch \ncontrol on a fallow field.\n\nSee also: Read more of Charlie Flindt\u2019s columns\n\nEvery time it reaches the headland, the driver leaps out to clean the spring tines, and gather the sinewy lengths of \ncouch in little heaps to be burned at a later date. If we were to hang around for a couple of weeks, the whole \nlaborious process would be repeated.\n\nAll that diesel, all that compaction; would our glyphosate hater be shuddering at the concept of \u201ccultural control\u201d?\n\nNow we\u2019ll twist the dial on the time machine\u2019s dashboard forward a couple of years, and watch the Allman mounted \nsprayer, with its state-of-the-art 30ft boom weaving its way across the field, applying paraquat.\n\n\n\nUnsophisticated guidance system\n\nThe theory was to burn off the above-ground greenery, and eventually \u201cexhaust\u201d those pesky rhizomes. The \npractice was carnage in the fields, and in more than one farmhouse. Certainly not agriculture\u2019s finest moment.\n\nAlong comes glyphosate. You\u2019d think it would be the eco-warriors\u2019 dream. No more damaging soil cultivation \n(although back in the 1980s, soil erosion wasn\u2019t the bogeyman it is today). And glyphosate was safe.\n\nOne early product was labelled with a hare as some sort of tacit acknowledgement of paraquat\u2019s disastrous legacy. \n\u201cYou could drink this,\u201d assured Ernie, the farm\u2019s first sprayer man, as I helped him load up the Allman for a bit of \npre-harvest couch control.\n\nWe didn\u2019t of course, but the harvest student and I had the dubious task of waving fertiliser bags on long sticks to \nguide Ernie from one end of the field to the other in those far-off pre-tramline days \u2013 so thank goodness it was safe. \nAnd it worked.\n\nExcept, it appears, glyphosate is no longer safe. It has become even more of a farm evil than the poor old humble \nplough, and no eco-activist\u2019s rant is complete without hyperbolic hatred of glyphosate and its inventors and \nmanufacturers.\n\nCue the eco-wailing\n\nAnd their number one go-to piece of scientific evidence is a report by the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) \ncancer agency \u2013 the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) \u2013 issued in March 2015.\n\nTheir verdict? Glyphosate is Group 2a carcinogen, a substance that probably causes cancer in people. Let the eco-\nwailing commence.\n\nBut then Reuters managed to get a sneaky peek at early versions of the IARC\u2019s report, and found that the early \nverdicts differed somewhat from the final.\n\nIn the original, noted Reuters, multiple scientists concluded their studies and had found \u201cno link between glyphosate \nand cancer in laboratory animals.\u201d\n\nThis and other equally significant bit of news somehow failed to make it to the WHO\u2019s final publication. Google \n\u201cWHO Reuters glyphosate\u201d for the full, and frankly astonishing, story.\n\nIt\u2019ll make you cross. It sure made me cross. If my farm is going to be forced to succumb to the eco-lobby\u2019s \ninfatuation with winding agriculture back in time to those horrible pre-glyphosate years, then I want to see straight, \nclear, honest evidence; not reports with inconvenient truths removed.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe \u201cto do\u201d list we put together at the beginning of May was so long that it was almost overwhelming. So much to \nget done before the hip operation, and, as the much-missed Time Team nearly said, we only had 16 days to do it.\n\nIt took a couple of days to stop running around in a circle (ah, that might explain the surgery) and sort out priorities. \nEventually, we sorted out a top three.\n\nAt number three was the 40% of the farm that was still unsown after six very unco-operative months.\n\nSee also: Read more of Charlie Flindt\u2019s columns\n\nEight tonnes of winter beans were formally informed that they would not be needed, and would have to sit and wait \nat the back of the barn until next autumn \u2013 or in a good second-hand grain trailer if I can find one for sensible \nmoney.\n\n\n\nExtra spring bean seed was miraculously found, spring barley seed was boosted by another tonne, and contractors \nbooked to help with sowing \u2013 but the days were ticking by.\n\nIs May really a suitable time for sowing? We\u2019ve done good spring beans in May, but spring barley? Who knows? \nThere\u2019s always wholecrop silage if all else fails.\n\nThe Eurovision forecast\n\nBut there were other, more important jobs to do. There was a long list of Eurovision songs to be checked and a \nprediction to be made.\n\nLuckily, 10 seconds spent watching the Israeli entry was enough to convince me that I needn\u2019t waste time watching \nany others.\n\nI made my forecast very publicly in the Jolly Flowerpots to anyone who would listen, including the Cookham Turkey \nMagnet (at least, I think that\u2019s what they call him; sounds a bit like an odd version of Babe Magnet, but there we \ngo), who had joined me and neighbour Robert for what he\u2019d hoped would be an evening of fine beer and intellectual \nconversation. Well, he got one right.\n\nFinally, there was the Single Farm Payment online form to fill in. This, of course, is the big one, and it takes a \ncurious change of mindset to do properly.\n\nWhat's a hedge?\n\nYou have to say a strict mental farewell to the world of grease guns, drill calibration and lamb castrations (ie, what \nout forefathers would recognise as \u201cfarming\u201d) and channel your energies into what an IT consultant/Defra wonk \nthinks \u201cfarming\u201d is.\n\nThank goodness for the crucial booklet called How to check and change your hedge information, which included a \nfull page entitled \u201cWhat is the definition of a hedge?\u201d We never knew. I could sense the farmhouse ghosts shaking \ntheir heads in bewilderment as I read that page.\n\nA brief visit to the RPA\u2019s record of my farm showed that most of the hedges, despite all their formal definitions, \nweren\u2019t mapped.\n\nDid I want to go through hours of sketching and sending in a pile of RLE1 forms? No. I managed to source my \nEcological Focus Area thanks to the corners and edges that were now available after we gave up trying to get into \nthe Keystone Cops Countryside Stewardship, topped up with some very popular wild bird strips, with just a soupcon \nof buffer strip to make up the numbers.\n\nPhew. The form was electronically submitted without an RLE1. Then the sun blazed majestically, and 300 acres of \ncrops were in and rolled in a week (don\u2019t mock \u2013 for us, that\u2019s a lot).\n\nA heavy night of rain (the first welcome rain in 10 months) meant the barley was through in five days \u2013 a good start.\n\nAnd, of course, Israel won Eurovision. I hope the Turkey Magnet took my tip  and put a bob or two on them. He can \nbuy the fine beer next time. \n\nCharlie Flindt is a tenant of the National Trust, farming 380ha in Hampshire with his wife, Hazel.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nWhen the mighty Minette rings you up and tells you to do something, by heck you do it \u2013 even if the message is \ndelivered by an automated evening call that somehow bypasses the Telephone Preference Service.\n\n\n\nHer instruction was clear: go and read Mr Gove\u2019s lengthy 64-page consultation document, \u201cHealth and Harmony: \nthe future for food, farming and the environment in a Green Brexit\u201d or, the \u201cShampoo Report\u201d as it shall henceforth \nbe known, thanks to its obsession with \u201chealth and harmony\u201d.\n\nSo I did, expecting little, and wasn\u2019t disappointed. The grubby fingerprints of the powerful agri-eco-lobbies could be \nseen all over each page as I scrolled all 64 of them down my screen.\n\nSee also: Read more of Charlie Flindt\u2019s columns\n\nAll their favourites (and unsolved contradictions) were there: soil is damaged, but somehow we farmers are still \nproducing high quality food.\n\nWe must boost yields, while doing all we can to remove plant food from the atmosphere. The CAP is blamed for the \ndecline in farmland birds, with no mention of the multitude of predators that have arrived in the past couple of \ndecades.\n\nGrammatically-challenged pages\n\nAnd, somewhat inevitably, the ultimate country contradiction pops up again in the Shampoo Report: we must do \nmore for countryside wildlife while encouraging more public access.\n\nFree-range people and their free-range dogs are incompatible with thriving wildlife. Our farm has just had another \nspring without a single lapwing to be seen.\n\nThey were once numerous enough to feature in the briefing for those setting off with Cambridge rollers.\n\nThe different options for reduction in payments were interesting, although the multi-thousand acre estates will \nalready have clever schemes in place to avoid qualifying as the top, most-penalised tier.\n\nI raised an eyebrow at plans to phase direct support out altogether \u2013 tens of thousands of bureaucrats and civil \nservants rely on measuring and inspecting British agriculture. Are they really going to be out of a job?\n\nI left the livestock bit to Hazel, whose lengthy submission involved a constructive plea for a return to local abattoirs \n\u2013 even a fleet of \u201ctravelling\u201d ones. \n\nAnything to avoid the hideous long haul to vast industrial units hundreds of miles away.\n\nI suggested she mention the absurdity of claiming \u201cworld-class welfare standards\u201d while allowing certain ghastly \nslaughter techniques, just to avoid upsetting the religious offend-atrons. She said she\u2019d leave that to me.\n\nAlso missing from the Shampoo Report is any mention of food supply. The assumption is clear across all of its \ngrammatically-challenged pages (it\u2019s \u201coutside the EU\u201d, not \u201coutside of the EU\u201d): food supply will always be plentiful. \nMother Nature is suggesting otherwise.\n\nEven the AHDB is taking a break from its Brexit bashing to report on the distinct possibly that \u201cthe unusual run of \ngrain surpluses\u201d may be coming to an end.\n\nTheme park Britain\n\nAnd how: there\u2019s an awful lot of North American seeding kit still frozen in the barn. A long-overdue run of mediocre-\nto-poor harvests might reset the perspectives on the countryside\u2019s purpose.\n\nSo that\u2019s what I decided my reply to the Shampoo Report would be. It would have to be short and snappy, and to \nthe point.\n\n\n\nIt would have to somehow get across to someone somewhere deep within the bowels of Defra house (who hasn\u2019t \nbeen relocated to the RPA to read 231,694 RLE1 forms) that full shelves aren\u2019t guaranteed.\n\nI toyed with \u201cFarmers make food. Food is plentiful. It won\u2019t always be so.\u201d But that seemed a bit long and over \nwordy.\n\nInstead, on a carefully laid out A4 formal letter, I typed: \u201cTheme park Britain won\u2019t feed Britain\u201d, and posted it. If that \ndoesn\u2019t warrant a congratulatory call from the mighty Minette, nothing will.\n\nCharlie Flindt is a tenant of the National Trust, farming 380ha in Hampshire with his wife, Hazel.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe orthopaedic surgeon leaned back in his plush leather chair. \u201cSo,\u201d he asked, putting fingertips to fingertips, \n\u201cWhen did you finally decide to go ahead with this hip operation?\u201d\n\nI had to think about it for a moment or two. I\u2019d abandoned the front row because of neck injuries, so it wasn\u2019t then.\n\nI gave up wicket keeping, but still soldiered on without the gloves.\n\nBut then I found I couldn\u2019t even wield my mighty Newbery properly, and tried umpiring; but standing still for four or \nfive hours started to hurt too. But still couldn\u2019t face surgery.\n\nSee also: Read more of Charlie Flindt\u2019s columns\n\nFor a couple of years I\u2019ve sat in the tractor with what feels like an open knife in my right pocket. I had to change the \nhabit of a farming lifetime and abandon the foot throttle: angling the right leg out was just too painful. Using the \nhand throttle was a whole new skill for me.\n\nLast autumn, that imaginary single-blade knife turned into a Swiss army knife, with every razor, corkscrew, hoof \npick and bottle opener jabbing relentlessly into my right hip.\n\nFred the flatcoat\n\nA few months ago, the surgeon filled the hip with a scary mix of painkiller and cortisone; life did get easier, which \nconfirmed that the hip was the problem.\n\nYou could tell the surgeon is of good Scottish farming stock; as he withdrew the huge needle from the deepest \nrecesses of my groin, he casually remarked: \u201cIn an ideal world, we\u2019d install a grease nipple on the outside of the \nhip.\u201d\n\nBut what was the moment that persuaded me to bite the bullet and agree to let him loose with his scalpel? The \nfamily was having a love-in with Fred the flatcoat, who, at twelve-and-a-half, has long since picked his last bird.\n\nThe back legs don\u2019t work terribly well, he\u2019s totally deaf, but being a flatcoat, he still considers life is fantastic \u2013 even \nwhen he has tumbled over into an undignified and helpless heap again. The tail still wags.\n\n\u201cIf he were in as much pain as you are,\u201d said Hazel, \u201cwe\u2019d have shot him.\u201d That was the moment. I was on the \nphone to make an appointment faster than you can say inflammatory arthritis.\n\nGory details\n\nThere was one more decision to be made: total hip replacement or \"Birmingham resurfacing\"? The differences are \ngory (but fascinating if you\u2019re into a bit of bone grinding), and probably best not discussed over breakfast.\n\n\n\nThe fancy \"resurfacing\" job is the better choice for a fat man who still reckons on shovelling a bit of the proverbial \nwhen he returns to work.\n\n\u201cWill I get back in the scrum?\u201d I asked. A shake of the head. \u201cBack behind the stumps?\u201d Another shake. \u201cBatting at \nnumber 5 for the White Hunter CC?\u201d A welcome smile and an approving nod.\n\nI drifted off as memories flooded back of striding boldly (and without pain) to the immaculately kept square of the \nBrockwood Oval, the very man to steady the ship with the White Hunter score at a traditional 9 for 3. A polite cough \ninterrupted my daydreams. Well? \u201cRight,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201d\n\nAnd so it is, if all goes to plan, that while you\u2019re settling down with this week\u2019s Farmers Weekly, I will be enjoying \nday two of my new right hip.\n\nI have no idea what to expect. I may be sprinting up and down the hospital corridors, rehearsing that quick single.\n\nOr I may be moaning and whining, milking my helplessness for all it\u2019s worth. Although that will all have to stop when \nHazel asks causally about the keys to the gun cabinet.\n\nCharlie Flindt is a tenant of the National Trust, farming 380ha in Hampshire with his wife, Hazel.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nSix weeks sitting in my \u00a3200 leather reclining chair from eBay feasting on 24-hours-a-day television has left me \nolder and wiser. It\u2019s amazing, the stuff I\u2019ve learned \u2013 often at 2am, while waiting for the painkillers to kick in.\n\nFor instance, did you know that every other suitcase arriving at Australian border control from south-east Asia is full \nof raw, bleeding meat?\n\nAnd did you know that there are officially more comedy quiz shows than there are approved comedians? And that it \nis illegal for the Question Time panel to reflect the Brexit views of the nation?\n\nSee also: Read more of Charlie Flindt\u2019s columns\n\nThere was one truth that became apparent as my eyes got squarer and squarer during my convalescence \u2013 the \nchance of our farm being the subject of an hour-long special presented by the impossibly wholesome Kate Humble \nare zero.\n\nThere are three reasons for this. First, my face is not camera friendly at the best of times; put it next to the heart-\nachingly photogenic Ms Humble, and it would look even worse.\n\nNiche or nothing\n\nThe second reason is that my farming is terribly dull. The non-farming TV viewer must think that every farmer is \ndedicating his acres to reviving a rare breed from the seventeenth century, and only using feed harvested by \nvillage virgins using the light of the second full moon of any month in a leap year. It\u2019s niche or nothing.\n\nHere at Manor Farm we stick with what works. When it comes to livestock, Hazel\u2019s motto is: \"They\u2019re not called rare \nbreeds for nothing.\" On the arable side, we grow what the farm has always grown.\n\nIf William Cobbett were to ride through again, he\u2019d recognise all the crops \u2013 with the sole exception of oilseed rape.\n\nIn that respect we\u2019re like the vast majority of British farmers: we get on with producing a selection of mundane \narable crops with varying but reasonably consistent degrees of success year after year. Hardly the scenario to \njustify the arrival of a film crew.\n\n\n\nThe third reason is a bit more complicated. I can\u2019t bring myself \u2013 no matter how hard I try \u2013 to use the word \n\"passion\" when it comes to my farming.\n\nPut someone from the Countryfile-approved farming world in front of a camera, and their eyes glaze over and the \n\"passion\" starts flying.\n\nYou would never believe how passionately passionate they are about their passion for showing just how much \npassion they have for farming with as much passion as they can passionately muster.\n\nYou see the word creeping into job adverts \u2013 \u201cDo you have a passion for quick-fit metric hydraulic connections?\u201d \u2013 \nand invitations to apply for tenancies, especially those offered by well-known land-owning charities.\n\nDo I worry that I can\u2019t proclaim my farming \"passion\" to anyone who will listen? Not really. I find it slightly creepy, \nslightly \"Stepford Farmer\".\n\nMy ideal farming gathering involves a good moan, vast dollop of cynicism and a complete lack of bespoke \nembroidered gilets.\n\nOstentatious \"passion\"\n\n\u201cI hate pet lambs,\u201d growls Hazel after another bruising session in the barn. The language I use after installing the \nde-awning plates in the NH TC5080 combine or unblocking the Horsch seed pipe can be fruity and medieval. But \nwe both love what we do.\n\nIt\u2019s just that we don\u2019t have \"passion\" ostentatiously (if metaphorically) tattooed on our foreheads for all to see. So if \nthe cameras do arrive at Manor Farm, the final result would be terribly dull, despite Ms Humble\u2019s best efforts.\n\nThe agricultural adventures of two cynical fifty-something farmers would hardly be Bafta material. Mind you, it would \nbe perfect for the 2am insomniacs, waiting for the soothing touch of paracetamol.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nWe are living in a golden age of geographical information. Never has it been so easy to pay a virtual visit to just \nabout anywhere on the planet.\n\nI can lose hours following my son doing his much-delayed \u201cgap yaah\u201d around South America.\n\nI can indulge in a tear-filled nostalgia fest as I track down the New Zealand youth hostels that hosted me in 1981, \nwhen \u201cgap yaahs\u201d were simply called \u201cyears out\u201d. Some are still there.\n\nCloser to home, I get back from a shoot and just love tracking down the aerial views of the drives, and work out why \nI was facing the wrong way when the main covey came over.\n\nSee also: Read more of Charlie Flindt\u2019s columns\n\nAnd then, even closer still, I browse the fantastic aerial view of my own farm, and spot the mysterious and \npreviously unknown lines and enclosures that were visible from God-knows-what altitude in March last year, when \nthe latest pictures were taken.\n\nIf I could only get the landlord to take an interest and do a bit of digging, we\u2019d be able to start in precisely the right \nspot, thanks to all the measuring tools available.\n\nAnd yet, the very same Mr Google who is responsible for this seemingly infinite virtual atlas is also responsible for \nthe very opposite: geographical information that is completely wrong.\n\nDelivery disappointment\n\n\n\nI knew something was up a couple of Christmases ago, when the children had ordered presents \u2013 via the internet, \nof course.\n\nThanks to the marvels of technology, they were able to track their latest purchase, which was inevitably yet another \nhigh-tech gizmo.\n\nI find it best not to ask how much the latest purchase cost, or what was wrong with the last one. You just end up \nfeeling old.\n\nThe tracking would say \u201cpending despatch\u201d, then \u201chas been despatched\u201d, and then it was \u201cen route\u201d. Excitement \nwould build; time to get the dogs in and wait by the open kitchen window.\n\nThere would then be an anguished cry, followed by a quivering bottom lip. The tracking message read: \u201cWe tried to \ndeliver, but there was no-one home. Please ring this number to rearrange delivery.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, angry phone calls would follow, consoling hugs were meted out, but there was still no parcel as \npromised.\n\nThe mystery was solved by a recent delivery of farm stuff. The driver rang: \u201cI\u2019m outside Manor Farm.\u201d I said he \ncouldn\u2019t be, \u2018cos I was, and he wasn\u2019t. But I could hear an engine running.\n\nI followed the rumble of an idling diesel engine, and found him parked outside Godwin\u2019s Farm, another heavenly \nfarmhouse on the other side of the tractor barn from ours.\n\nJust Google it\n\nI explained that he was outside the wrong house. \u201cNot according to Google,\u201d he pointed out on his tablet, and \nindeed he was right. There was a Manor Farm tag right over Godwin\u2019s Farm.\n\nNow, Godwin\u2019s Farm is not only heavenly, it is also empty, and has been for some time. All those parcel deliverers \nmay indeed have knocked on the door and had no reply.\n\nIt all made sense. And it\u2019s not just us; my neighbour\u2019s Flower Emporium has been mysteriously moved west. I \nwonder how widespread the problem is.\n\nI\u2019ve tried emailing Google to point out its error, but, not surprisingly, have had no reply. I doubt my message made \nmuch of an impact in the inbox of the world\u2019s biggest company.\n\nI could get my son to divert his travels, head north to California, and hammer on the door of Google\u2019s HQ, which, \nGoogle tells me, is at 1,600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View.

However, he was upset that the \ncouncil refused to use some of the money to pay for the removal of the waste, which is still in place.\n\nCost of clearing\n\nAlternatively, Mr Tucker said the council could have ordered the offender to pay for the cost of clearing.\n\n\u201cBathnes Council took the money, but we still have to pay to remove somebody else\u2019s waste.

But it cannot guarantee that any individual product is non-GM fed, unless it is \norganic.\n\nGM Freeze campaign director Liz O\u2019Neill said: \u201cWe want to see strong regulation of GM across the food chain and \ninformation for consumers through the labelling of GM ingredients and the use of GM feed.\n\n\u201cPeople do want to know how their food is produced.

demand, putting downward \npressure on farm gate prices.\n\nDefra statistics show that free range eggs accounted for 51% of throughput in the first quarter of 2018, which is \nthree percentage points higher than in Q1 2017.\n\nIn total, 3.9m cases of free range eggs were produced during Q1 2018, compared with 3.5m in 2017, 3.2m in 2016 \nand 2.9m in 2015.\n\nSee also: All major retailers committed to cage-free eggs by 2025\n\nOver the same three-year period, the average retail price of eggs has fallen from 98.8p/dozen in 2015 to \n82.7p/dozen in Q1.\n\nRobert Gooch, chief executive of the British Free Range Egg Producers Association (BFREPA), said that over the \npast three years existing producers had got bigger and there had been a large number of new entrants to the \nindustry as people sought to diversify.\n\nThis meant the sector was now at a \u201ctipping point\u201d, with a risk that it could overshoot the market and suffer price \ncuts later this year.\n\n\u201cOver the past three years the free range industry has been growing at 10% a year, but overall egg consumption \nhas been increasing at only 5%,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo we think its unsustainable and we think we are at risk of over oversupplying the market which will have terrible \nconsequences in terms of egg price.\u201d\n\nMr Gooch said retailers announced last year that they were moving away from caged eggs from 2025 and there \nhad been general misunderstanding that this meant eggs from caged hens would be replaced with free-range.\n\nBFREPA\u2019s conversations with retailers suggest, however, that they intend to meet their commitments by shifting to \neggs produced in barn systems.\n\nThis will be more cost-effective and so help supermarkets to keep delivering a \u201cvalue\u201d product.\n\n\n\nMr Gooch said producers were often attracted to free-range egg production as an enterprise as it had the lowest \ncapital requirement of all the systems.\n\nBut it was vital that farmers took independent advice on budgets.\n\nAccording to BFREPA\u2019s latest figures the margin (excluding finance and deprecation) is \u00a31 a bird, but  rent and \ndepreciation take that to a loss of \u00a33.04.\n\nBFREPA publishes updated costings on its website each month.\n\nMr Gooch stressed that the free-range egg sector was still growing and there was no doubt that consumers liked \nthe product.\n\n\u201cThe question is how we make sure that we don\u2019t overdo it and keep free range growing with demand and not \nexceeding demand.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nEd

about 30 people, and Barn on the Farm festival was born.\n\nWhile it has grown considerably from the early days, it has managed to retain its authentic farm-based vibe thanks \nin part to the clever

arable farm started its diversification journey under Matt\u2019s father Rob, in the 1980s.\n\nGradually the farm business moved away from growing cereals, potatoes and onions in favour of producing soft fruit \nand vegetables, including blackcurrants, raspberries, asparagus and pumpkins.\n\nThe bulk of the fresh produce is sold through their own farm shop, which has thrived thanks to the farm being just a \ncouple of miles north-west of Gloucester city centre.\n\nMatt looks after the events side of the business, while brother Rees oversees the day-to-day running of the farm \nand sister Abbie is part of the festival-organising team.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was made a farm partner in 2013 and the festival turned into a limited company around that time. It was more of a \nhobby for us until then, but from that point the festival got more serious and had to start making money,\u201d says Matt.\n\nOver the next few years the team toiled to increase capacity as the festival became more established, adding a \nsecond stage and later building a permanent roundhouse structure, which is used as the main stage for headline \nacts.\n\nBig names at Barn on the Farm\n\n2011 Ed Sheeran, Ben Howard, Gabrielle Aplin\n\n2012 Bastille, Bear\u2019s Den\n\n2013 James Bay, George Ezra\n\n2014 Catfish and the Bottlemen, Hozier\n\n2015 Jack Garrett, Rag\u2018n\u2019Bone Man\n\n2016 The Amazons\n\n2017 Tom Odell\n\nRegular reseeding\n\nBeing named the UK\u2019s Best Independent Festival at the 2014 AIM Independent Music Awards was a real boost for \nthe enterprise, further helped by the fact that it has earned a reputation for booking budding bands and musicians \nwho go on to be major players in the music game.\n\n\u201cBarn on the Farm was actually Ed Sheeran\u2019s first headline gig at a festival in 2011 and four years ago James Bay \nwas the first act on, playing our smallest of the three stages.\n\n\u201cYou start thinking about all of the amazing artists that we\u2019ve had over the years and the mind boggles,\u201d says Matt.\n\nAnd while the thought of having thousands of revellers milling around a working farm would be enough to make \nmany farmers tear their hair out, Matt says the chilled-out nature of the festival has meant no major issues have \never come up during the four-day spectacular.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fairly used to reseeding the grass paddocks now,\u201d he laughs. \u201cFortunately, we\u2019ve only had one really wet \nyear, so the land has never suffered too much. It helps that a lot of the areas for food and drink vendors and \nwatching the artists are on hard standing.\u201d\n\nAmazing places\n\nHaving grown up in nearby Cheltenham and worked on farms when he was younger, Josh says the sights, smells, \nunique buildings and history of a farm were all elements he was keen to play on to make his festival extra special.\n\n\u201cThe land and architecture of a farm is so unique and there's just something about walking along a dirt track in \nbeautiful weather. It's an amazing feeling to work on the farm in the final month before the festival,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cFarms are amazing places, but more importantly it's about the people who run them. A lot of people can come up \nwith an idea for a festival, but it's something else to make it happen and farmers are used to managing the land in \nextraordinary ways and coming up with new ideas.\u201d\n\n\n\nWith a background in directing music videos for artists such as Bastille, Ed Sheeran and Gabrielle Aplin, today Josh \nmanages the likes of George Ezra and Lily Moore and keeps his ear to the ground for the music world\u2019s next big \nthing.\n\nAs for the festival\u2019s future, Josh says he\u2019s planning something special for the 10-year anniversary and would love to \nsee some of the huge artists like Ed Sheeran return to Barn on the Farm.\n\n\u201dIt would be great to encapsulate something that made the last 10 years so special, but we'll see,\u201d he says.\n\nHopes are the event will continue to sell out and grow steadily, although Matt highlights the farm only has a finite \namount of usable space and thinks that 4,500 festival-goers would be a comfortable number to have at the family \nfarm.\n\nBarn on the Farm is being held again at Over Farm this year from 5-8 July.

The conversation will include a bigger \npicture look at the future of glyphosate, including its use in perennial crop and amenity systems, which have been \nidentified as being at relatively high risk, in terms of resistance.\n\nFive steps to effective glyphosate stewardship\n\nIf you must use glyphosate pre-harvest to control weeds, always follow label recommendations to keep crop \nresidues to a minimum\n\n\n\nTo use glyphosate as a stale seed-bed management tool, the strategy is: one, prevent survivors; two, maximise \nefficacy; three, use alternatives; and four, monitor success\n\nAlternatives to glyphosate should be used whenever possible and more than two pre-drilling applications must \nalways be avoided\n\nWhen applied, glyphosate should be at the right dose, at the right time and in the right conditions\n\nAny surviving weeds should not be treated with glyphosate again and any suspected resistance must always be \nreported and investigated.\n\nPre-harvest glyphosate use in cereals and oilseed rape\n\nA single pre-harvest application of glyphosate per crop should not increase the risk (unless survivors are present \nfrom prior glyphosate applications).\n\nBe sure your target market permits the use of glyphosate\n\nCheck and follow product labels\n\nFollow best application practice (for maximum efficacy and drift reduction)\n\nOnly apply glyphosate as a harvest aid when the grain or seeds have less than 30% moisture content\n\nUse the guidance in this publication to estimate moisture contents\n\nOnly target weeds that are green, healthy and actively growing\n\nGlyphosate food residue levels \u2018safe\u2019\n\nScientists from Europe\u2019s food safety watchdog have concluded glyphosate residues present in EU food samples \nare safe for human health.\n\nThe European Food Safety Authorityhas completed its review of the maximum levels of glyphosate that are legally \npermitted to be present in food, based on data on glyphosate residues in food submitted by all EU member states.\n\nThe maximum residue levels are set to ensure consumers continue to be protected against excessive quantities of \nglyphosate in their diet. They are based on an analysis of all existing authorised uses of the herbicide in the EU.\n\nThe review \u2013 covering all crops treated with glyphosate \u2013 includes a risk assessment which shows exposure levels \nare not expected to pose a risk to human health.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nDefra secretary Michael Gove has issued licences to farmers in England to cull ravens on farmland to protect \nnewborn lambs.\n\nMr Gove has agreed that Natural England can issue licences for ravens to be culled in five English counties \u2013 \nDerbyshire, Lancashire, Berkshire, Wiltshire and Dorset.\n\nFarmers Weekly understands the licences have only been granted to a small number of farmers in these areas. If \nthe trial proves successful, more licences could be granted to farmers elsewhere.\n\nSee also: NSA supports wider cull of ravens to counter high lambing losses\n\nThe move will be welcomed by farmers, who have been campaigning for a cull to be introduced for several months. \nBut it has angered conservationists, including the RSPB, because ravens (Corvus corax) are a protected species.\n\n\n\nLast month, the National Sheep Association (NSA) called for the cull of ravens to be widened from Scotland, where \nit is routine, to other areas to counter high lamb losses.\n\nFigures from Scottish National Heritage (SNH) show more than 1,000 of the animals have been culled each year \nsince 2016.\n\nNSA welcomes move\n\nNSA chief executive Phil Stocker said the NSA has received reports of up to 100 lambs killed by ravens in Scotland \nthis year.\n\nBut responsible culling under licence \u201cwill allow farmers to keep on top of the numbers and protect stock when they \nare at their most defenceless\u201d.\n\nMr Stocker said: \u201cWe think this is a really positive move and recognition of some of the problems that ravens can \ncause.\n\n\u201cCulling is a way to stamp out the nasty behavioural traits that can develop in these birds. They are very intelligent \nbirds and the ability for them to communicate within a group is massive.\n\n\u201cOne of our members in south Wiltshire said 80 of his ewes and lambs were lost, or had to be put down last year, \nbecause of raven attacks.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cRavens can peck out the eyes and tongues of lambs. We have also received reports of lambs\u2019 \nstomachs being ripped out before they are able to stand. They can be really vicious birds.\u201d\n\nRaven numbers\n\nAccording to the RSPB, the UK\u2019s raven population is estimated at 7,400 pairs (RSPB, 2016).\n\nAn RSPB spokesman said: \u201cWe are concerned because raven populations are recovering well after a period in \nwhich their population suffered significant declines, in part driven by widespread historic persecution.\n\n\u201cWe understand farmers' concerns over ravens, however we need NE to be very clear on the licensing process and \nwe seek assurances that the continued recovery of raven populations in England will not be compromised.\u201d\n\nRavens are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, but licences can be issued to cull a \u201csmall \nnumber of birds\u201d.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nMichael Gove has announced plans to crack down on illegal waste crime and fly-tipping by organised criminal \ngangs, which is blighting the countryside.\n\nThe Defra secretary has announced a three-month review to beef up the government\u2019s approach to tackling waste \ncrime in England.\n\nWaste criminals operate illegal sites, evade landfill tax and undercut responsible waste disposal businesses, say \nministers.\n\nSee also: Revealed \u2013 the burden of fly-tipping on farms\n\nTheir activity cost the English economy \u00a3600m in 2015. In 2016-17, councils spent \u00a358m of taxpayers\u2019 money \nclearing fly-tipped waste.\n\n\n\nMr Gove said: \u201cOrganised criminals running illegal waste dumps and fly-tipping are blighting local communities. \nThey cost our economy vast amounts of money, pollute our environment and harm our wildlife.\n\n\u201cWe must crack down on these criminals, who have no regard for the impact they have on people\u2019s lives. The time \nis right for us to look at how we can best tackle these antisocial and inexcusable crimes.\u201d\n\nWaste sites shut down\n\nMore than 850 new illegal waste sites were discovered by the Environment Agency in 2016-17.\n\nAn average of two illegal sites are shut down every day, but they continue to create severe problems for local \ncommunities and business, especially in rural areas.\n\nThe Home Office believes criminals may also operate illegal waste sites as a cover for theft, human trafficking, \nfraud, supplying drugs and firearms, and money laundering.\n\nThe review, launched on Sunday (10 June), will consider serious and organised waste crime, including the \ngovernment\u2019s response \u2013 so that the panel can make recommendations for a strategic approach.\n\nLed by Defra non-executive director Lizzie Noel, the review will also consider other measures for the Environment \nAgency, local authorities, the private sector and the police to tackle organised waste crime.\n\nNew measures\n\nThe latest announcement builds on a range of measures to tackle waste crime, including new powers for the \nEnvironment Agency to lock the gates of problem waste sites and for councils to hand out on-the-spot fines for fly-\ntippers.\n\nThe review is due to be completed in September, after which an evidence-based report will be submitted to Defra \nministers for consideration.\n\nTim Breitmeyer, president of the Country, Land and Business Association (CLA) said: \u201cFly-tipping is not a victimless \ncrime.\n\n\u201cThe government, local authorities and the Environment Agency must work together with farmers and landowners to \nhelp reduce fly-tipping on private rural land.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a vicious cycle of costly clean-ups by the victims who bear the burden of waste crime and the threat of \nprosecution.\u201d\n\n5 ways to get tough on fly-tipping\n\nImpose and enforce penalties that better reflect the seriousness of the crime \u2013 seizure of vehicles must be the \ndefault penalty to send a clear signal that criminals will face damaging consequences if they are caught fly-tipping.\n\nEnforce fines for home and business owners whose waste is found in fly-tipped locations \u2013 to act as a deterrent and \nencourage waste disposal through legal channels.\n\nAppoint a national \u201cfly-tipping tsar\u201d, whose responsibilities would include co-ordinating with national agencies to \ntackle organised criminal gangs, monitoring and reporting on the scale of the problem across public and private \nland, and benchmarking enforcement performance.\n\nDevelop new ways to aid clear-up and support victims, such as a new scheme to allow any private landowner to \ndispose of fly-tipped waste free of charge, and removing the landowner\u2019s liability to clear up waste on private land.\n\n\n\nPromote education and working in partnership by sharing best practice and advising landowners on how to reduce \nthe chance of being a victim of fly-tipping. Examples of local partnerships include shared CCTV monitoring \nschemes, Countryside Watch and incident intelligence sharing, which should be showcased.\n\nSource: Country Land and Business Association\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nStrict and tighter limits will be imposed on ammonia emissions from agriculture under government plans to improve \nUK air quality.\n\nFarmers and livestock producers face further restrictions on organic and inorganic fertiliser, including manures, \nslurries and nitrogen-rich chemicals and their application.\n\nEnvironmental controls will be extended to large dairy farms by 2025 under the plan \u2013 similar to the permits already \napplied to intensive pig and poultry units.\n\nSee also: What EU ammonia rules could mean for pig farmers\n\nThe proposals are contained in the government\u2019s Clean Air Strategy, which was launched by Defra secretary \nMichael Gove on Tuesday (22 May).\n\nFor the first time, the government will take concerted action to tackle ammonia from farming \u2013 which is responsible \nfor 88% of ammonia emissions, says the document.\n\nFarmers will be required to invest in the infrastructure and equipment necessary to reduce emissions \u2013 and \nsupported to do so through a new system of public money for public goods.\n\n\u2018Biggest threat\u2019\n\nThe government says air pollution is the fourth biggest threat to public health after cancer, obesity and heart \ndisease. Other industries will also face restrictions.\n\nMr Gove said: \u201cWe will work with businesses, farmers, industry and households to develop innovative new solutions \nto reduce emissions.\u201d\n\nThe Country Land and Business Association said it was important any scheme provided genuine incentives to \nsupport farmers making the changes. CLA president Tim Breitmeyer said any system must provide flexibility and \neasy engagement for farmers alongside clear obligations for delivery.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe will consider carefully the proposals that require farmers to invest in any system or new infrastructure \nand equipment that helps deliver sustained improvements.\u201d\n\nSerious emissions\n\nBut the Soil Association said the government\u2019s plan for tackling air pollution failed to do enough to tackle serious \nammonia emissions from farming.\n\nSoil Association policy officer Honor Eldridge said: \u201cIf the UK is to improve its air quality, it is critical that we address \nall the causes of air pollution.\n\n\u201cWhile UK emissions of nitrogen oxides have fallen by about 70% due to measures to control air pollution in the last \ntwo decades, there have only been small decreases in ammonia emissions.\u201d\n\nMs Eldridge said the government should support and promote a wider shift towards more extensive farming \nsystems, such as organic grass-based systems with lower stocking densities.\n\n\n\nThe proposals are in addition to the government\u2019s \u00a33.5bn plan to reduce air pollution from road transport and diesel \nvehicles, set out in July last year.\n\nDefra says the combined actions will reduce the costs of air pollution to society by an estimated \u00a31bn/year by 2020, \nrising to \u00a32.5bn every year from 2030.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFresh legal challenges to the government\u2019s badger cull will be heard at the High Court this summer.\n\nDefra executive agency and culling licensee Natural England is facing two legal challenges in July over its decision \nto extend the culls, which are part of the government\u2019s 25-year bovine TB eradication programme.\n\nThe legal action is being led by Tom Langton, an ecologist with a long-standing interest in wildlife disease and \nnature conservation.\n\nSee also: Expert advice \u2013 what happens if my herd fails a TB test?\n\nMr Langton\u2019s legal challenge is being financed through crowdfunding and he is also supported by the Badger Trust, \nthe Born Free Foundation, 20 badger groups around the country, and private individuals.\n\nThe first judicial review relates to the five-year supplementary culling licences issued to west Somerset and west \nGloucestershire by Natural England.\n\nThe claimants question the way consultation was carried out in 2016-17 in relation to the 2011 badger culling policy \nand its science.\n\nIn numbers: bovine TB and the badger cull\n\n40,000+ TB-infected cattle were slaughtered in the UK in 2017\n\n19,274 badgers were culled across 21 areas last year\n\nNine new areas have applied for licences to cull badgers in 2018\n\n\u00a3100m annual bill to taxpayer from cost of bovine TB\n\nThe second judicial review relates to the 2017 badger culling licences for five of 11 areas where culling was \nintroduced that year, on the grounds that assessments of the ecological effect of culling more than 70% of the \nbadger population \u201cwere not done correctly\u201d.\n\nHigh Court hearing\n\nBoth legal challenges will be joined and heard by the same judge at the High Court in London from 9 to 11 July.\n\nMr Langton told Farmers Weekly: \u201cThere are a lot of animals in decline or rare species in the countryside and it \ndoesn\u2019t take much to change their habitats before their fate is changed.\n\n\u201cThis is not really anything to do with TB, it\u2019s really to do with how Natural England and Defra have handled the \nconsultations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about getting proper safeguards for the environment and making sure that the right decisions are made. We \ndon\u2019t believe Natural England has gone through this whole process properly.\u201d\n\nA third challenge to the 2016 badger cull impact assessments is being \u201cworked up\u201d, anti-cull campaigners say.\n\nIf the legal challenge succeeds, it could result in some of the licences being quashed.\n\n\n\nGovernment response\n\nA Defra spokesperson said it would be inappropriate to comment on the particulars of the case while a legal matter \nis ongoing.\n\n \n\nBut the spokesperson said bovine TB is one of the greatest animal health threats in the UK and has a devastating \neffect on our farmers.\n\n \n\n\u201cIt is a slow-moving, insidious disease that presents many challenges and there\u2019s no single measure that will \nprovide an easy answer. That is why we are pursuing a wide range of interventions, including cattle movement \ncontrols and a cull of badgers in areas where disease is rife.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nGovernment plans for a new environmental watchdog after the UK leaves the European Union have been criticised \nby industry leaders and environmental campaigners.\n\nA 12-week consultation on an independent statutory body to hold the government to account and uphold \nenvironmental standards was launched on Thursday (10 May).\n\nSee also: Will farmers pay price of government's 'green' Brexit?\n\nDefra secretary Michael Gove said an Environmental Principles and Governance Bill will then be published in draft \nform this autumn and introduced early in the next parliamentary session.\n\nThe proposed new body would partly replace the role currently played by EU agencies holding UK governments to \naccount for the delivery of environmental policy.\n\nThe consultation sets out options for transposing existing international environmental principles into domestic law \nand creating a new office.\n\n'Independent scrutiny'\n\nDefra says the new body will provide independent scrutiny and advice on government policy \u2013 and will be able to \nhold the government to account on environmental legislation.\n\nBut the Country Land and Business Association said the plans risked adding confusion and complexity rather than \ngenuine accountability to environmental policy.\n\nCLA policy director Christopher Price said the UK had some of the highest environmental standards in the world \u2013 \nwhich should be maintained through Brexit and beyond.\n\nBut it was important that everyone involved in deciding, implementing and complying with environmental law was \nworking to clear and consistent standards.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that what is suggested in this consultation could add significant cost, complexity and \nbureaucracy to the system and put at risk the better delivery of environmental policy.\u201d\n\n'Confusing arrangements'\n\nThe CLA would be asking the government why it was not looking at a more fundamental consolidation of the many \nagencies currently involved in environmental governance.\n\n\n\nMr Price said: \u201cThis agency could end up duplicating or confusing existing arrangements for scrutiny and \nenforcement in parliament, existing public authorities and the courts.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental campaigners have also criticised the government's plans.\n\nGreener UK, which represents 13 environmental organisations, said the government's proposals would give the \nenvironment and countryside less protection.\n\nGreener UK chairman Shaun Spiers said: \u201cThere is no commitment to give the proposed new watchdog power to \ninitiate legal action.\n\n\u201cNor is there any commitment to enshrine vital environmental principles \u2013 such as the precautionary principle and \nthe polluter pays principle \u2013 in law.\u201d\n\n'Fundamental test'\n\nMr Spiers said the proposals failed the fundamental test of ensuring that environmental protection was not \nweakened after the UK left the EU.\n\n\u201cIt is not too late for the government to deliver on its commitments, but with less than a year to go until we leave the \nEU, time is running out,\u201d he added.\n\nMr Gove said the new watchdog would ensure a \"green\" Brexit \u2013 and insisted the government would not weaken \nenvironmental protections.\n\n\u201cWe will only achieve our aims by also creating a strong and objective voice that champions and enforces \nenvironmental standards,\u201d he said.\n\nAn independent and statutory watchdog would hold governments to account for delivering their commitments to the \nnatural world, Mr Gove added.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nStricter controls are to be imposed on fertiliser, manure and slurry applications under government plans to improve \nUK air quality.\n\nDairy and beef farms are among the sectors that will bear the brunt of restrictions as the government seeks to \nreduce ammonia emissions from agriculture.

Either that, or consumers will have to pay more for their food.\u201d\n\nAngus Gowthorpe, beef farmer, Escrick, Yorkshire\n\n\u201cThere certainly isn\u2019t enough money in beef to enable me to build a shed with concrete floor, effluent tank etc just to \nstore 6-9 months of farmyard manure.\u201d \n\nPhil Latham, dairy farmer, Cheshire\n\n\u201cDefra has to regulate the market and extend the remit of the groceries code adjudicator to ensure an equitable \nshare of available margins for farmers, so that we can fund investments that need to happen.\u201d\n\nJames Winslade, beef farmer, Bridgwater, Somerset\n\n\u201cAny grants that are made available for equipment must be protected against significant price rises from the \nmanufacturers as soon as the grant comes out.\u201d \n\nWhat industry is saying\n\nNFU deputy president Guy Smith said a range of actions were needed to ensure farmers could retain the capacity \nto produce food while continuing to safeguard the environment. He added: \u201cIt is crucial that new measures support \nfarm businesses to be productive and competitive.\u201d\n\nCountry Land and Business Association president Tim Breitmeyer said any scheme must provide genuine \nincentives to support farmers making the changes. It should also provide flexibility and easy engagement for \nfarmers alongside clear obligations for delivery.\n\n\n\nBut the Soil Association said the proposals failed to go far enough. It said they should include support for a wider \nshift towards more extensive livestock farming \u2013 such as organic grass-based production systems \u2013 with lower \nstocking-densities.\n\nThe proposals are in addition to the government\u2019s \u00a33.5bn plan to reduce pollution from road transport and diesel \nvehicles. Defra says the combined actions will reduce the cost of air pollution by \u00a31bn annually by 2020, rising to \n\u00a32.5bn annually from 2030.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nDry weather in some key grain producing areas around the world is pushing domestic prices ever higher.\n\nBetween \u00a3145/t and \u00a3164/t ex-farm was being offered for new crop UK feed wheat midweek, with a tight end of \nseason picture.\n\nNew crop barley was worth \u00a3130/t-\u00a3142/t ex-farm for harvest movement.\n\nSee also: Can the grain price rises of recent weeks continue?\n\nGrain price factors\n\nTight UK end of season grain balance\n\nDry weather reducing global crop outlooks in important regions\n\nUK 2018 wheat crop estimated at  about 14.4m tonnes\n\nHighest UK barley use for 25 years\n\nContract high for November 2018 London feed wheat futures of \u00a3158.25/t delivered\n\nAcross all grains \u2013 wheat, barley, oats and maize \u2013 for the current season the UK is facing the tightest balance of \ngrain available compared with total expected domestic consumption for four years.\n\nWeather worries in parts of Canada, Australia, the US, Argentina, Brazil and the Black Sea region are the key \nconcerns. Traders highlight the likelihood of volatility as crop and weather news emerge.\n\nAHDB Cereals & Oilseeds pointed out that with opening grain stocks for the new season looking as if they will be \nbelow average and an early estimate for the size of the UK wheat crop at just 14.4m tonnes, domestic supply of \nwheat is set to fall by about 3% year-on-year.\n\nWheat use in animal feed is already up 3% year on year, and in the poultry sector at least this looks set to continue.\n\nBroiler chick placings between January and April this year were 5% higher than in the same period of 2017 and up \n11% on the five-year average.\n\nTight wheat supply has encouraged more use of barley across the UK, which is at its highest level for 25 years.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nHigh-horsepower foragers were making pretty light work of the showground\u2019s grass crop. New Holland, John Deere \nand Fendt all had their choppers at work, as did Krone with its new Liebherr-powered Big X 780.\n\nThe Swiss engine maker also builds Claas\u2019 new range of Torion loading shovels, which were beavering away on \nthe nearby silage clamp.\n\n\n\nOther highlights included an old John Deere 6030 pulling a forage box on the Kverneland stand and an unusual \nsystem for sheeting silage clamps.\n\nSee also: High-hour Horsepower: 26-year-old forager still going strong in Herefordshire\n\nJohn Deere 6030 and Kverneland forager\n\nVintage horsepower is guaranteed to pull in the show crowds as Kverneland found when it hooked this 1972 John \nDeere 6030 to one of its latest KV10040R forage wagons. There was plenty of black smoke to show for its efforts, \nbut the 213hp, six-cylinder up front had ample power for the job.\n\nWarthog Buckrake\n\nSomerset-based Warthog Machinery has something of a reputation for putting together seriously well-built bespoke \nbits of kit.\n\nThe latest example is this ultra-heavy duty buckrake. It stands 2.7m wide and weighs 1850kg to help with clamp \nconsolidation. One key concern for the customer was visibility, and so it\u2019s been designed with that in mind. In \naddition, the push-off frame runs right to the end of the 50mm square-section Hardox tines, ensuring the fork \ndoesn\u2019t carry any grass back down the clamp.\n\nPrice for this heavy-duty version is about the \u00a36,000 mark, although the lighter standard model comes in slightly \ncheaper.\n\nSaphir clamp compactor\n\nHeavy ring-press clamp compactors have become commonplace with many silage gangs across the UK and now \nthey\u2019re starting to become a bit more clever. This one from German firm Saphir has a 1.2m fold-down press arm \nthat can be used to roll the shoulders of the clamp.\n\nA double-acting ram with gas accumulators means it can generate up to 900kg of downforce. In addition, the \nmachine has a 700mm hydraulic side-shift function that means the rolling tractor is kept well away from the side of \nthe heap. The unit itself weighs 3.25t empty, but plugs in the box section frame and roller mean it can be water \nballasted to more than  4t.\n\nThe other key difference, according to UK importer Suffolk Farm Machinery, is that the press rings are kept narrow \n(20mm). With 225mm spacing, they cut down through the surface layers to consolidate at depth.\n\nThe only trouble is that all this bulk requires a tractor of at least 250hp up front \u2013 and there\u2019s an equally hefty price-\ntag to match, \u00a312,500. For those without such big budgets or as much power on tap, a lighter version is available \nthat comes in closer to \u00a39,000.\n\nClaas Torion loading shovels\n\nGrassland UK provided the first working demo of Claas\u2019 new Liebherr-built Torion loading shovels. Two models \nwere working on the clamp \u2013 the 18t 1812 and the 15t 1511.\n\nThe larger has a true lift capacity of 6t and 230 litres/min hydraulics while its smaller sibling can handle 5t and has \n170-litres/min oil flow. Both run on 750/65R26 rubber, but that\u2019s where the similarities end.\n\nThe lighter machine employs a 167hp John Deere engine to drive a twin-pump Bosch Rexroth hydrostatic \ntransmission and Dana Spicer axles while its bigger brother gets its muscle from Liebherr\u2019s own 195hp motor and \nhas a hybrid mechanical-hydrostatic CVT drive much like a Fendt Vario, with ZF axles putting power to the ground. \nClaas says to expect prices to come in close to similarly specced JCB shovels.\n\nLogosol sawmill\n\n\n\nAlthough not mainstream grassland tackle, this B1001 sawmill from Swedish firm Logosol attracted plenty of \nattention. Capable of dealing with logs up to 1m in diameter, it uses a 23hp V-twin Vanguard petrol engine to power \na ripping band saw, turning tree trunks into usable timber.\n\nAt present only a static version is on offer but later this year a mobile version will be launched with electric loading \nand log turning functions powered by a rechargeable battery pack. For now the static version comes in at \u00a37,995.\n\nHuesker Silage Safe\n\nA nifty new silage sheet system aims to take the hassle out of closing off a clamp and improve the quality of the \nforage inside.\n\nAgritec Silage Safe from German firm Huesker is made up of a series of 2m-wide webbed sheets that are draped \nover the sides of the pit walls before filling starts. At the base of each of these there\u2019s a length of perforated pipe, \nwhich when connected together act as a drain for any rain water running down the sides of the clamp.\n\nOnce the sheets are in place, the standard silage sheeting is installed and filling begins. When the clamp is full the \nwoven sheets are dragged over the top, before being pulled tight using a belt-and-ratchet system connected to steel \npipes slotted into the fabric.\n\nThe ratchet itself has a long lever so the installer has enough leverage to really crank up the pressure.\n\nAccording to Huesker, the system creates even pressure across the top of the clamp and ensures there are no air \npockets. It\u2019s also considerably quicker than humping hundreds of tyres around, and allows the clamp to be quickly \nreopened to add another layer.\n\nThe sheets are stored in a crate that can be lifted up to the clamp on pallet tines and Huesker says they have a life \nspan of at least 10 years.\n\nPrices vary slightly depending on the quantity ordered, but on average it works out at \u00a38.72 per sq m.\n\nMaschio Rotaseeder\n\nKit options for getting a fresh grass crop into shallow, stony soils are fairly limited, but Maschio reckons it has hit the \nmark with its rotavator and seeder combination.\n\nThe two-part outfit is designed to stir up a thin, fluffy tilth in old leys or cereal stubbles ahead of the piggybacking air \nseeder and is a far quicker way of getting seed down than anything plough-based, according to UK importer Opico.\n\nThere are several Maschio rotavators, ranging in width from 2.1m to 3.1m and in power requirements from 60hp to \n250hp.\n\nOpico also suggests fitting either the Cobra rotor (extra vertical blades) or Condor rotor (aggressive steel spikes) to \nhelp break up hard ground.\n\nOn top is a standard air seeder with basic electronic calibration, variable-rate sowing and the ability to broadcast or \nband sow. A rear packer is included too, which improves seed-to-soil contact and breaks down any remaining \nclods.\n\nThe 2.8m wide Maschio SC280 rotavator with Condor blades, packer roller and air seeder costs \u00a324,388.\n\nAnderson RBM 2000 Pro trailer\n\nCanadian outfit Anderson reckons it has solved the age-old quest to speed up silage bale collection by doing away \nwith the telehandler or tractor loader.\n\n\n\nThe 12m-long RBM Pro uses a clever claw to grab wrapped bales from the ground and hoist them on-board without \ntearing the film.\n\nThe arm sits stationary in relation to the ground as soon as a bale is detected to avoid scuffing the plastic, while the \ntractor and trailer continues to trundle steadily around the field. It\u2019s also able to swivel to collect bales that are laid \non their sides.\n\nAnderson reckons typical loading time is about 20secs per bale and the controls run through a Danfoss \ntouchscreen in the tractor cab.\n\nMaximum capacity is 20 bales, with two rows of seven topped by a single row of six, and the whole lot is unloaded \nby tilting the trailer rearwards and pushing them off with the headstock.\n\nThe trailers are sold through Lincolnshire contractor D Clifford & Sons and the asking price is about \u00a347,000.\n\nKrone BiG X 780\n\nThe thrum of the new BiG X 780 at full chat drew in the crowds to Krone\u2019s Grassland stand.\n\nIt is one of a trio of new-generation models \u2013 badged the 680, 780 and 880 \u2013 that were officially unveiled at \nAgritechnica in November to replace the 700, 770 and 850 .\n\nThey slot in behind the flagship BiG X 1100 and are powered by 16.16-litre V8 Liebherr engines with outputs \nranging from 687hp to 898hp.\n\nThe updates were focused on operator comfort, so most of the internals remain the same.\n\nThat includes the six pre-compression rollers that help serve up a blockage-free crop flow and drum that comes in a \n20-, 28- or 36-blade format. There\u2019s also a biogas drum with 40 or 48 knives for extra-fine chopping.\n\nElsewhere, an independent wishbone suspension arrangement has replaced the solid rear axle to improve handling \nand allow for tighter turning circles.\n\nThere\u2019s also a new armrest-mounted 12in touchscreen and the option of Krone\u2019s slightly wacky-looking Lift Cab that \nuses a scissor lift to hoist the cockpit 70cm upwards, providing a better view over tall maize crops and into silage \ntrailers.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe process of mowing, raking and tedding was in focus at this year's Grassland event, with all the big names \nshowing their take on the silage system.\n\nItalian firm Abimac caught the eye with its novel front-mounted rotary rake, while Kuhn, Reiter and SIP were \npromoting the virtues of merger units over standard rotary rakes.\n\nFilm-on-film silage wrapping was also in the spotlight, with several firms now doing away with the traditional net \nbase layer in order to improve silage quality.\n\nSee also: Driver's view: McHale Fusion 3+ round baler\n\nAbimac Avantime\n\nGrassland debutant Avimac was showing off a time-saving way of rowing up grass or straw ahead of the baler.\n\nIts butterfly rig runs on the tractor\u2019s front linkage while the baler is towed behind, completing two passes in one and \navoiding rowed-up crop getting soaked by a rain shower before the baler reaches it.\n\n\n\nThe kit is built in Turin, Italy, and comes to the UK via North Yorkshire farmer and contractor Simon Smith, who set \nup Abimac UK 18 months ago.\n\nThere are three models in the twin-rotor range that vary in weight from 1,250kg to 1,750kg, have power \nrequirements of 110hp to 130hp, are all 5m long and run on a weight-bearing front wheel to help follow ground \ncontours.\n\nThe smallest 6m model has nine arms per rotor and costs \u00a316,500, while the largest works out to 8m, has 13 arms \nand costs \u00a320,500.\n\nKuhn Merge Maxx 950\n\nMerger machines are yet to take off in the UK, but Kuhn hopes its redesigned Merge Maxx 950 will spark some new \ninterest in the concept.\n\nUnlike the sweeping action of a rake, these implements pick the crop off the ground and shift it sideways on an \nelevator belt. The theory is that this prevents contamination from soil, stones and other unwanted detritus, as well \nas producing a more uniform swath.\n\nOne of the downsides has been the premium price, but Kuhn has simplified the design of its latest model, making it \neasier to build and, crucially, cheaper to buy.\n\nWith a list price of \u00a365,356 it is indeed getting more competitive with some of the larger four-rotor rakes.\n\nAs for performance, the trailed Merge Maxx 950 can gather in a maximum width of 9.5m with its pair of pickup and \nmerger belt units. These can be configured in several different ways, allowing it to produce windrows either in the \ncentre of the machine, on the left and right sides or a combination of all three.\n\nEach of the pickup units has a roller at the front to smooth crop flow, before the cam-track pickup flicks the material \nonto the rubber merger belts. The whole system is hydraulically driven via the machine\u2019s own pto-driven pump.\n\nSIP mowers and merger\n\nSlovenian manufacturer SIP has been making rapid progress in the UK mower market since debuting at last year's \nGrassland and Muck event in Stoneleigh.\n\nIt now offers a pretty big range that includes the front and rear combo in action at the show, as well as bigger \nbutterfly triples.\n\nThe company was also demoing one of its mergers on the site. The front-mounted Air 300F is built under licence \nfrom Austrian company Reiter and uses many of the same components. However, the frame and hydro-pneumatic \nsuspension system is an SIP design.\n\nLike Reiter\u2019s own machine, it has a roller at the front that guides the crop to the flexible camless pickup. A finger \nrotor then flicks the crop onto the rubber conveyor belt, which can be set to deposit the material on the left or right \nside of the machine.\n\nAll components are hydraulically driven and it requires a minimum oil flow of 60 litres/min. Working width of the \nfront-mounted machine is 2.95m and a larger 5m trailed will be available soon. This can work independently, or be \nteamed with the front unit.\n\nThe front-mounted 300F has a list price of about \u00a320,000 and the rear unit will come in at about \u00a355,000.\n\nCase-IH RB545 Silage Pack\n\nCase was one of several companies showing off a baling unit that uses plastic film rather than traditional net wrap.\n\n\n\nThe company reckons this provides a better oxygen barrier to produce higher-quality silage, even when it\u2019s stored \nfor a long time.\n\nThe fixed-chamber RB545 Silage Pack is also fresh from a redesign that has seen access to the film rolls improved, \nrotor cutter knives strengthened and wrapper table belts lengthened. The quarter-turn option has been tweaked too, \nallowing bales to be dropped perpendicular to any slope.\n\nIt will make a 1.25m bale, takes about 135hp to run and has a wrapping capacity of up to 50 bales an hour. Retail \nprice is \u00a374,439.\n\nThe Silage Pack was being towed by a Maxxum 145 Multicontroller, which was returning to work after its record-\nbreaking performance at the German DLG testing station.\n\nIt notched the lowest specific fuel consumption ever recorded by a four-cylinder in the PowerMix test, which was \nmore than 9% better than its nearest competitor (apart from sister firm New Holland, of course).\n\nKey to the tractor\u2019s success, says Case, was the combination of 145hp, 4.5-litre FPT engine and new 24-speed \nActive Drive 8 transmission.\n\nThe gearbox was launched at last year\u2019s Agritechnica event and offers eight speeds in each of three ranges, sitting \nbetween the company\u2019s more basic 16-speed semi-powershift and the stepless setup of the CVX.\n\nKverneland butterfly mowers\n\nKverneland\u2019s latest high-spec mower combination comes in the form of the 3332FT font and 53100MT rear butterfly \nunit.\n\nThis setup has a maximum cutting width of 10.2m and comes with the firm\u2019s Quattrolink suspension system. This \nhas a vertical working range of 700mm , which apparently helps maintain constant ground pressure over undulating \nterrain.\n\nThere is also the option of a Geomow full Isobus system with section control. This automatically lifts and lowers \nindividual mowing units at the headlands and offers automatic adjustment of overlap too.\n\nJD V451M baler\n\nThe most recent round of variable-chamber balers from John Deere have been treated to a few updates to improve \ntheir performance in different crop conditions.\n\nThese include a larger-diameter pick-up and one-piece in-line auger rotor for improved intake and crop flow. For \nquicker clearance of blockages, there is also a full-width drop floor.\n\nElsewhere, the V400 range has been given a general beefing up, with a heavier-duty frame, bigger drive chains and \nlarger roller bearings. Ultra-tough Hardox steel tines have also been used in the rotor.\n\nThe bale density system has been reworked, too, and they come with the option of net-only or net and twine \nwrapping.\n\nKuhn FBP3135 Intelliwrap baler with film wrap\n\nFor the 2018 season, Kuhn will be offering film binding on its FBP3135 Intelliwrap combination baler.\n\nUnlike some other machines that bind the bale with a separate roll of full mantle film, the Kuhn system uses two \nrolls of standard 750mm bale wrap.\n\n\n\nThis approach is apparently cheaper and faster, as the narrower film feeds into the chamber more quickly. Tying or \nbinding is done with four layers, before the bale drops onto the 3D wrapping table.\n\nAt the moment Kuhn recommends applying the standard six layers of film, but it says there is potential to drop this \nto five in some situations.\n\nThe FBP3135 baler itself has a list price of \u00a367,722 and the film wrapping option adds \u00a36,000.\n\nMaxam mower\n\nFresh off the boat from New Zealand, this Maxam mower has a few unusual tricks up its sleeve.\n\nTwo- and four-drum versions are available and have wilter rotors that catch the grass as it comes off the blades, \nspreading it out to the full working width of the machine.\n\nAlthough offset versions are available, Maxam says its in-line models are the most popular because of their \nsimplicity. Running down the grass you\u2019re about to cut is no issue, according to the company, as cranked blades \nand slightly angled drums lift laid crop with little issue \u2013 looking at the demo plot of importer Suffolk Farm \nMachinery, that certainly seemed to be the case.\n\nAll the elements are entirely belt and pulley driven, making for a very low-maintenance, quiet-running gearbox-free \nsetup. Power requirement for the 3.3m model is 90hp while the two-drum 2.5m version requires just 70hp. Prices \nstart from \u00a37,500.\n\nPottinger Impress baler-wrapper\n\nPottinger has only been building round balers for four years, but already those that are out there are gaining a \nreputation for performance, according to the company.\n\nBoth fixed- and variable-chamber versions of the Impress combi are available with a 32-knife chopper unit that will \nreduce fibre lengths to 36mm.\n\nA novel wrapper arrangement with underslung \u2013 rather than overhead \u2013 satellite arms is used to apply the film. With \na slew ring underneath the table, there is said to be a lot less stress placed on the whole machine, particularly when \ntravelling at pace across bumpy ground.\n\nBeing based in the Alps, the other area the company has concentrated on is bale transfer on slopes. Between the \nbale chamber and the wrapper is a receiver cradle that slides on rails between the two. Initially it stabilises the bale \nand then travels rearwards and upwards to place it on the forward cranked table. Once in position, the wrapper \nlevels out and the film arms start to spin.\n\nThis approach is said to do away with the issues of getting bales from the chamber to the wrapper on both uphill \nand downhill slopes.\n\nPrices are yet to be set, but expect the Impress combi to come in at about a similar figure to the obvious \ncompetition. Two different spec levels are available with virtually every function automated and the company is \ncurrently working on a netwrap free film-on-film system.\n\nVicon 732 mower-conditioner\n\nVicon\u2019s mounted mower-conditioners have had a revamp that sees a return to race car-type suspension and a \nclever parking system that makes it possible to store the machines upright.\n\nBoth 3.2m and 3.6m models are now suspended from the centre of the bed and employ a four-link parallelogram \nframe with pivoting ball-ends in each tie-rod to provide 3D contouring in all planes.\n\n\n\nAs ever the mowers are equipped with Vicon\u2019s trademark tri-blade discs, each of which is now designed to shear a \nshaft should an obstacle be encountered, avoiding costly damage to the gears.\n\nThree flip-down legs with gas struts mean it is possible to unhitch the mower in a matter of seconds, leaving it in its \nupright folded position.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nWeaning can be a stressful experience for a cow and calf, breaking the maternal-offspring bond and removing milk \nfrom the calf\u2019s diet.\n\nHowever, there are strategies beef producers can take to reduce the effect on performance.\n\nSimon Marsh, principal lecturer and cattle specialist at Harper Adams University, says the first rule of weaning is \nthat there is no optimum age \u2013 some calves can be weaned at five months, others as late as 10 months.\n\nSee also: Expert advice on creep feeding calves\n\n\u201cTotal flexibility is needed. Age at weaning needs to fit into your own system and it really depends on cow \ncondition,\" he explains.\n\nWhen to wean\n\nReducing stress\n\nTop weaning tips\n\nCase study\n\nWhen to wean\n\nIf the cow is lean, weaning early will allow her time to recover and gain condition. If the cow is overconditioned, \nweaning can be left until later.\n\nMr Marsh says the ideal is condition score 3-3.5 at housing and 2.5 at calving, so age at weaning should be \ndictated by those parameters.\n\n\u201cIf it has been a poor grass-growing year, you might want to wean earlier because it takes the pressure off the cow.\"\n\nRemoving a cow\u2019s lactation requirement earlier will also allow her to carry more condition into autumn and winter, \nreducing cow maintenance cost, because she will need less winter supplementation.\n\nIf increased body condition is maintained through winter calving and breeding, this could have a positive effect on \nconception rates.\n\nWeaning early: effect on calf and how to reduce stress\n\nFor the calf, weaning stress can result in reduced liveweight gain, a marked increase in physical activity, including \npacing and calling, and a reduction in the time spent feeding during the post-weaning period.\n\nAbrupt weaning will compound this. Therefore, it is worth considering pre-weaning tactics such as fence line \nseparation or anti-suckling devices such as nose flaps, says Mr Marsh.\n\nFence line weaning\n\nFor fence line weaning, separate cows and calves on either side of a fence for four days or more before separating \ntotally.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis allows the cows and calves to still see, hear and smell one another and where possible have nose-to-nose \ncontact,\" says Mr Marsh.\n\nNose flaps\n\nA recent study carried out by Harper Adams University and funded by AHDB Beef & Lamb showed at 11 days after \nweaning, calves fitted with nose flaps to prevent them suckling their dam had a greater liveweight gain compared \nwith the abruptly weaned calves.\n\n\u201cDespite not being significant, this suggests a reduced growth check at weaning compared with the abrupt weaning \nmethod,\" adds Mr Marsh.\n\n11 top tips for weaning\n\n1. Avoid housing and weaning calves at the same time to minimise the number of stressors they are exposed to at \nany one time. Instead wean two to three weeks before housing.\n\n2. Introduce creep a minimum of four weeks before housing because a calf\u2019s ability to covert feed is at its highest at \nthat point \u2013 every 120kg of feed is converted into 40kg of liveweight gain.\n\nIt also means that at weaning the calf will be used to hard feed. The only exception might be native breed heifers \nbecause they will lay down fat and they also finish later than other breeds.\n\n3. Do not dehorn or castrate a month before or after weaning to minimise stress.\n\n4. Graze calves purchased weaned at market for two to three weeks before housing in a well-fenced and sheltered \nfield.\n\n5. Vaccinate against pneumonia and clostridial diseases before housing.\n\n6. Clip a 30cm wide strip from the calf\u2019s back to prevent sweating.\n\n7. Treat for internal and external parasites with a clear anthelmintic and treat for fluke if needed.\n\n8. House in well ventilated sheds with plenty of straw and avoid a dusty environment.\n\n9. Stocking density should be double the normal space requirements \u2013 2-3s square metres per 100kg of liveweight \ninstead of the normal 1-1.5.\n\n10. Introduce the store or finisher diets gradually and feed plenty of good quality forage initially.\n\nStart supplementary feeding with the creep feed diet then slowly change to the winter ration if the formulation is \ndifferent\n\n11. Avoid mixing groups of calves because of the risk of disease spread if they come from different disease \nbackgrounds. \n\nCase study: Robert Hartley, Holdgate Hall Farm, Much Wenlock \n\nFarm facts\n\nSpring-calving herd of 140 Saler cross Simmental suckler cows\n\nCalve from February onwards\n\nUses British Blue bulls with estimated breeding values in the top 1% for the breed\n\n\n\nWeaning up to three weeks after housing when calves have adapted to their new environment curtails growth \nchecks in the cattle Robert Hartley takes through to finishing.\n\nAlthough daily liveweight gains (DLWG) are slow in the week Mr Hartley removes calves from their mothers, \nperformance reverts within a month, at which point bulls are recording DLWG of 2.5kg.\n\nMr Hartley, who farms in partnership with his son, Peter, puts this down to weaning at a point when calves are well \nadjusted to their new environment. \n\nConsistency in their diet is important too, he says.\n\nCreep feeding\n\nCows and calves are turned out to grass after calving from mid- to the end of April.  \n\nCalves are first given creep at grass in metal creep feeders from three months old. They also receive this ration in \nthe first few weeks at housing.\n\n\u201cNot all of them take it, but it is there if they want it,\" says Mr Hartley.\n\nCalves are at grass until the end of October, when they are loose housed with their mothers. At that point, they are \nwormed and vaccinated for blackleg.\n\n\u201cThey stay with their mothers for two to three weeks while still having the creep, as well as silage,\" Mr Hartley \nexplains.\n\n\u201cWe weigh every month and at weaning. We noticed the growth weights drop a bit in the first week, but it doesn\u2019t \ntake long for them to get back on track,\" says Mr Hartley.\n\nAt weaning, bulls average 330kg and heifers 300kg, 50% or more of cow liveweight.\n\nHe has used nose flaps in the past but didn\u2019t rate them, because they came off in more than one-third of the calves.\n\n\u201cIt was probably because they were in and out of the feeders,\" he says. \u201cWe did notice that those that did retain \nthem were quieter at weaning, so if we sold our cattle as stores, we might have given them another go.\n\n\u201cAs it is, we sell at about 14 months, so the growth check isn\u2019t an issue by then.\"\n\nAfter weaning, bulls and heifers are separated and receive ad-lib rations of home-grown barley, soya, molasses and \nstraw.\n\nBulls finish at 600kg and heifers at 500kg, with all cattle sold at Bridgnorth market.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe annual Farmplanner competition has been won by a team of five students from Harper Adams university.\n\nThe contest, for students attending an agricultural university or college, provides a real-life farm business case \nstudy which is facing a challenge, and they have to propose a solution.\n\nFinal-year students Daniel Liddell, Harry Dunford, Charlie Cheyney, Paul Brown and Michael Wood won the judging \npanel over with a confident presentation and a detailed brief, edging out competition from Bishop Burton college.\n\nSee also: How setting up a company can help succession and diversification\n\nA team from Newcastle had also been shortlisted but withdrew from the competition at the last minute.\n\n\n\nFor John and Cathy Charles-Jones of Woodborough Park farm, near Nottingham, their issue is how to take a step \nback from the successful arable farm they have built up over the past 14 years while still driving the business \nforward.\n\nThe couple, who are thinking about retiring in the next five to 10 years, have two children but neither is interested in \ncoming home to farm.\n\nThey also asked entrants to suggest how they could mitigate a likely reduction in subsidy payments, prepare for a \npotential glyphosate ban and diversify their redundant farm buildings.\n\nWoodborough Park farm facts\n\nSize: 244ha\n\nCurrent cropping: Winter wheat, winter oilseed rape, spring beans, spring wheat/barley, permanent pasture\n\nSoil type: Silty clay loam\n\nCurrent diversifications: Wind turbine, ground and roof-mounted solar panels\n\nThe Harper team proposed increasing the amount of labour employed from the current setup of a part-time self-\nemployed person to a full-time employee.\n\nStarting in an assistant farm manager role, it was hoped that the successful candidate would graduate in time to \nrunning the business day-to-day to allow Mr and Mrs Charles-Jones to take a step back.\n\nYear-round work and additional income to justify the extra cost would be provided by adding a beef finishing \nenterprise.\n\nSufficient grazing for the cattle would be provided by adding short-term grass leys into the arable rotation alongside \nthe existing permanent pasture.\n\nThe grass would also help with weed control, particularly to suppress the blackgrass that has caused some issues \non the farm\u2019s silty soils.\n\nThey also proposed generating additional income by transforming the farm\u2019s traditional buildings into either holiday \nlets, office lets or self-storage.\n\nThis would take advantage of the farm\u2019s situation in a high population area, being situated about 30 minutes away \nfrom Nottingham city centre and close to several other towns and villages.\n\nWhat is the Farmplanner competition?\n\nRun by the Institute of Agricultural Management, and now in its 25th year, the Farmplanner competition invites \nteams of students studying agricultural courses to analyse a farm with a business problem that needs solving.\n\nThey are given a presentation from the hosts and business and banking professionals, and then have to submit a \ncarefully costed business plan.\n\nA shortlist of three teams is then invited back to the farm to present their ideas and take questions from a panel of \nprofessionals.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nWeight has been paying at marts this spring as sluggish lamb production has left some farms having to sell lighter \nlambs (37-38kg) with throughputs 30-40% back on the year and prices matching the year.\n\n\n\nScorching haymaking weather and a European holiday led to both reduced supply and demand and a slide in trade \nover the past week, with the national SQQ down to 216p/kg on Friday 22 June and 212.19p/kg on Monday 25 \nJune. \n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var

premium for weight has been reported at Hereford in June, where Greg Christopher is seeing 41kg lambs \nmake 225p-230p/kg but heavier 43kg-plus lambs make 240-250p/kg.\n\nNumbers are tight, with new-season lamb throughputs back 500 to 1,000 head a week, effectively leaving supply \nthree to four weeks behind last year.\n\n\u201cI would say weight will be dear for a month or so. It will pay to get lambs to 42-43kg, I don\u2019t see the heavy lambs \nslipping too much,\u201d Mr Christopher told Farmers Weekly.\n\nHeavy (45.6kg-52kg) lambs hit 245.9p/kg on 20 June, as 2,164 lambs averaged at 233p/kg and 2047 lambs hit an \nSQQ of 232.4p/kg.\n\nNorth West Auctions\n\nNumbers are back 10-15% each week in the North West, with many vendors having half as many lambs to sell on a \nweekly basis from a year ago.\n\nMonday\u2019s sale at Lancaster (25 June) saw 10% fewer lambs on the week (517) due to haymaking weather and an \naverage 9p/kg back on the week at 221p/kg.\n\nBut numbers were down for a variety of reasons, including the tough spring leading to higher mortality and slower \nweight gain.\n\n\u201cDairy farms getting out of sheep to concentrate on dairy has seen numbers back in the Lancaster area,\u201d said Ian \nAtkinson of North West Auctions. \u201cMeanwhile there are several early lambers who have stopped lambing earlier \nbecause they felt it wasn\u2019t being rewarded highly enough. This year it would have been.\u201d\n\nHe stressed the important thing for vendors to remember was that lambs should be finished properly. \u201cThere is \nparticularly strong demand for lambs at 43kg and above but some farmers need the lambs away in good time and \nat lighter weights.\u201d\n\nStirling United Auctions\n\nNumbers are back 30% on the year, although 2017 was an exceptionally good lambing and spring for growing \nlambs, said Peter Wood at United Auctions.\n\nHe stressed that lamb supplies were only slightly behind a typical year, with numbers close to the 1,000-1,500 mark \nwhich continues through the peak of the summer.\n\nYardings have been about the 800-900-head mark, with a total of 784 NSLs reported last Thursday (21 June) at an \naverage of 227.8p/kg (SQQ of 225.7p/kg).\n\n\n\u201cLate February and early March-born lambs have been slower. Ewes would have been milking less at the time and \nthey would have got the biggest growth stunt,\u201d said Mr Wood. \u201cWe could end up with a lot of lambs coming ready at \nonce.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nHeifers reigned supreme at the Beef Expo at Shrewsbury Market yesterday (25 May), scooping both interbreed \ntitles and the silverware in the baby beef section.\n\nTaking the day\u2019s top honours and making it their second interbreed title at Beef Expo was the Lyon family from \nBourne, Lincolnshire, with their 16-month-old British Blue cross Ayanna, which weighed 498kg.\n\nShe won the red rosette earlier in the day in the heifer championship. She was purchased privately from Messrs \nReed, Knarr Farm, Cumbria, for an undisclosed figure.\n\nNo stranger to the show ring, she won first place at Countryside Live as a calf and claimed the championships at \nNewark and Woodhall Spa Country Shows earlier this month. She heads to Herts County Show next (26-27 May).\n\nSee also: How and why Shropshire beef farmer is converting to organic\n\nReserve interbreed was awarded to Phil and Sharon Sellers, Thorpe Tilney, Lincoln, with their 13-month-old \nLimousin heifer She\u2019s a Diva, weighing 554kg.\n\nBred by Guto Lewis, Welshpool, she was originally purchased by Wendy Morgan alongside her dam, who sold her \nto the Sellers last year after Diva\u2019s success in the baby beef section at the English Winter Fair.\n\nSired by Lodge Hamlet, she is out of a pure Limousin cow. Diva won commercial champion and reserve interbreed \nat Woodhall Spa County Show earlier this month. She heads to Lincolnshire Show later this month (20-21 June).\n\nCommenting on his placings, judge Neil Slack, who keeps 15 commercial cows in Penrith, Cumbria, said Ayanna \nreally stood out on the day: \u201cShe had good lines, good legs, no waste at all and makes a bonny picture. But there \nwasn\u2019t a lot between them.\u201d\n\nBaby beef results\n\nIn the baby beef championship, it was heifers again that were pick of the day with judge Michael Alford, Foxhill \nFarm, Cullompton, Devon.\n\nHe tapped out nine-month-old Limousin cross Scarlet as his champion. Bred by Berwyn Hughes, Lampeter, she \nwas purchased privately by Morgan and Jones, Llandovery, Carmarthenshire.\n\nShown by 27-year-old Sam Jones, she tipped the scales at 350kg and heads to Shropshire County today (26 May) \nbefore competing at the Royal Welsh later this summer.\n\nPhil and Sharon Sellers were back in the winnings, taking reserve spot with their seven-month-old Limousin cross \nLittle Gem. Bred by Phil Jones, Powys, she was purchased at Ruthin for \u00a33,250.\n\nShown by Phil\u2019s son, 13-year-old Ryan Jones, she is out of Limousin cross Blue cow and is sired by an Irish \nLimousin bull. She weighed in at 323kg and will go home to rest before returning to compete on the Christmas show \ncircuit later this year.\n\nSteer championship\n\nTaking the silverware in the steer championship were Melanie and Michael Alford with their three-quarter Limousin \nsteer No Likey from Cullompton, Devon.\n\n\n\nThe 11-month-old was purchased at Brecon Show potential sale for \u00a32,400 from DE and G Davies, Garth, and \nweighed in at 520kg. He next heads to the Royal Cornwall show.\n\nRunner-up on his first outing was the home-bred June 2017-born Marley from Wilkinson and Marwood, Leyburn, \nNorth Yorkshire.\n\nSired by Waindale UFO, he is out of a British Blue cow and weighed 443kg. Shown by 19-year-old Beth Wilkinson, \nhe will now be exhibited at Northumberland Show (28 May) and the Great Yorkshire in July.\n\nSouth Devon performance championships\n\nWinning the South Devon breed championship on his first outing was the home-bred 16-month-old bull AI X Rufford \nSAS Quest from RW and SM Bostelmann, Eccleshall, Staffordshire.\n\nSired by Rufford SAS Dillon, he is out of AI Z Rufford Erica 25 Ex90. He has already been sold privately, but will be \nshown at the Shropshire (25 May) and Suffolk (30-31 May) before heading to his new owner in Cornwall.\n\nThe yearling heifer Z Cilgwrrwg Cariad stood reserve to him.

: Farmers Weekly\n\nAuctioneers are warning there is no prospect of straw prices reverting to normal levels for the rest of 2018 as \ncarryover stocks are virtually non-existent and standing crops in some areas are looking short and thin.\n\nAs decision time approaches for growers considering whether to chop or bale early cereal crops, prices per tonne of \nbarley straw are forecast to be \u00a390-100/t, with wheat about \u00a370-80/t.\n\nThis is some \u00a320/t higher than where the price started last season, said Wright Marshall auctioneer Andrew \nWallace, but well below the \u00a3130/t some loads were trading at by the end of the season.\n\nSee also: Six alternative bedding options to straw compared\n\nWith agronomists warning of short, thin-looking crops in the ground, the Cheshire-based auctioneer said he predicts \na buoyant trade, noting some merchants in his region are increasing their storage capacity in anticipation of firm \nprices.\n\nThe price rises cost some farmers an additional \u00a370 a cow last winter, according to a report published in April by \nSAC Consulting, leading to a potential 19% decline in beef enterprise gross margins.\n\nBut livestock farmers hoping growers in the arable heartlands of East Anglia will moderate the trade by sending \nmore straw west are likely to be disappointed.\n\nCommitted choppers\n\nJohn Hartwright, director at consultancy firm Laurence Gould, said while the higher prices would more than \ncompensate farmers for the nutrient value lost by not incorporating, many of his clients are committed to chopping \nstraw.\n\n\u201cThey are very aware of the delays waiting for a baler can create,\u201d he explained, saying that many are anxious to \nimmediately start drilling oilseed rape or controlling blackgrass.\n\nFor those in the East who do regularly bale, many are supplying the four straw-burning power stations in the region \non long-term contracts, said Mr Hartwright.\n\n\n\nThey take in excess of 900,000t/year at a price of about \u00a340/t, depending on moisture content, some 9% of the total \namount of straw used in the UK.\n\nThis scale of usage has drawn sharp criticism from the National Pig Association which recently warned that demand \nfrom power plants is contributing to the severe strain on straw supplies and is threatening the shift towards high-\nwelfare straw-based systems.\n\nThey said some producers in the north of the country are unable to take in stock as they cannot source bedding, \nwhile other finishers are paying up to \u00a3150/tonne, almost the same as the cost of the grain.\n\nMore supply this year likely\n\nAdrian Cannon, rural partner at Gloucestershire-based auctioneers Tayler and Fletcher, said he is forecasting \nhigher straw prices than two years ago but does not expect them to hit the heights of last year when supply was \nlower than normal due to the wet harvest.\n\nEarly planted winter crops are looking well in his region he said which should also mean the standing crop at \nharvest is likely to be up on the year.\n\nGrowers minded to bale should therefore have more to supply, but he said others regarded the hassle as not being \nworth it at any price.\n\nWeather dependent\n\nDonald Dunbar, senior agricultural consultant at SAC consulting, said that Scottish prices would be very dependent \non the weather at harvest, with many growers only contemplating baling if there was a prolonged dry spell \npreventing wet swaths lingering in fields.\n\nWith virtually no carryover from last season, rain this summer would be likely to send costs soaring again as long-\ndistance haulage from England took its toll.\n\nHis advice for straw users is therefore to talk to suppliers early and get a price agreed for their straw requirement for \nthe whole season rather than buy per load through the winter when prices could be at their highest.\n\nHow can livestock growers cut bedding costs?\n\nUnless they are in a mixed farming region and can set up a mutually beneficial straw-for-muck agreement with an \narable farm, livestock farmers often regard themselves as price takers on the straw market.\n\nBut the extreme prices of last season are prompting some livestock farmers to look at other options for bedding \nafter tight supplies and a long winter sent prices soaring to more than \u00a3130/t.\n\nDonald Dunbar, senior agricultural consultant with SAC consulting, said he is seeing an increased proportion of new \ncattle sheds in the Scottish Borders having slatted floors.\n\nThis style of shed has in the past had an image of being less welfare-friendly, but he said the addition of rubber \nmats had improved cow comfort and were proving popular among farmers.\n\nOthers in the area have also been experimenting with woodchip aggregates which are a by-product of supply chain \nto wood-fired power stations.\n\nThe price of these stands at about \u00a3400 for an artic load, Mr Dunbar said, with farmers using them either under \nstraw to form the base for the bed or as a full alternative.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\n\n\nMint condition John Deere 10-series tractors are now fetching close to their as-new price, but that hasn\u2019t deterred \none young contractor from running a high-houred 6610 on the frontline of his fledgling business. Edd Mowbray \ncaught up with him on his Devon farm.\n\nWhen Marcus Tucker spotted a stunning John Deere 6610 that became available at a local dealer, he offered \neverything he could lay his hands on to make sure it joined his small fleet of contracting machinery.\n\nAlongside his 1,000 hours a year of contract farming, Mr Tucker has a metal fabrication business that builds \nanything from gates to grain trailers and the front weights for the 6610 parked at his Talaton, Devon base.\n\nHe tells Farmers Weekly why he picked it and what he uses it for.\n\nWhere did you buy it from?\n\nI knew what I wanted ever since I started saving and, after biding my time and letting some less tidy examples go, \nthis one came up for sale at local dealer Smallridge Brothers in Barnstaple.\n\nI drove up there and paid \u00a317,500 for it.\n\nIt had one previous owner when I bought it at just under 10,000 hours. It has now clocked 13,750 so I\u2019ve done the \nbest part of 4,000 hours in the seat.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty much a top spec model as well. I think the only extras it doesn\u2019t have are a sunroof and creeper box, \nalthough I fitted the front linkage in 2014 to make switching weight blocks easier and give me the option of using a \nswath roller when baling.\n\nSee also: Ultimate guide to buying a tractor 2018\n\nWhat are its main tasks?\n\nIt spends 400 hours a year hedge cutting with a McConnel 6500T, which is mounted to the axle of the tractor. I\u2019ve \nalso got a Pottinger rake, Vicon mower and a Kuhn baler, with which I produce around 7,000 bales per year, and do \nsome work for a local contractor, taking annual workload to around 1,000 hours.\n\nThis has slowly crept up over the past few years as I have taken on more work. I don\u2019t advertise so it\u2019s just word of \nmouth and I work within a 10-mile radius from my base.\n\nI charge one way travel on each job, which isn\u2019t to everyone\u2019s taste but I\u2019m a small business and when the wheels \nare turning I need to be charging.\n\nHow well is it looked after?\n\nReligiously \u2013 I\u2019m a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to maintenance.  \n\nI\u2019m the only driver so if something goes wrong or gets broken, I\u2019ve only got myself to blame. But on the flip side, at \nleast I know about it straight away and it will get fixed immediately.\n\nIf you start to let the little things get away, the list grows and becomes unmanageable.\n\nI blow out the radiators and cab every evening when I come home and give all the main points a squirt of grease. It \nusually gets cleaned around once a week.\n\nEngine oil is dropped out every 250 hours along with the front hubs, while the back end, filters and front axle oil is \nchanged every 1,000 hours.\n\nRunning old kit means I have to be on top of my servicing regime and it has just had a new set of boots, too.\n\n\n\nThe reason I went for this series of tractor is its simplicity. It means I can fix almost anything on it without the help of \na laptop or mechanic costing extra.\n\nI could sell this and buy a newer model, but my reliance on others would be greater. \n\nIs the cab starting to show its age?\n\nThe cab is kept pretty clean and everything has its place. I don\u2019t wear work boots in the cab as I have a carpet in \nthere, which does mean I\u2019m quite particular about footwear.\n\nI had to replace the seat a few years ago as the previous 11,000 hours had taken their toll.\n\nI spotted a brand new genuine John Deere seat on eBay from a dealer who was having a clear-out. I snapped it up \nfor \u00a3750 and it came with the whole assembly. \n\nHave you done much to it?\n\nI\u2019ve made covers for the diesel tank and bonnet when hedge cutting. I learnt the hard way when a piece of wire \nspeared a hole in the side of the tank in my early days and I ended up needing a replacement tank.\n\nI\u2019ve wired in a Greenstar screen to give me a light bar to keep my lines straight, too. The main benefit is it records \nfield sizes so I can charge customers exactly for the work I\u2019ve done.\n\nOlder tractors of this size lack tool storage and, as I like my cab to be clean, I\u2019d rather not have tools and flails \nrattling around my feet.\n\nI bought a Stanley toolbox and welded a sliding bracket behind the front wheel under the exhaust stack. I can store \nall the tools here and it tucks away when I don\u2019t need it.\n\nThe wheels get a refurb every couple of years as you don\u2019t realise how much a yellow wheel loses its shine until \nyou give it a fresh coat, especially after a lot of hedge cutting.\n\nIs it reliable?\n\nI\u2019ve had a few little niggles, but nothing major. The injector pump went soon after I got it and luckily it was fixed \nunder warranty.\n\nThere was also a crack in the rear spool block that I had to get sorted, but these have been the only two mechanical \nissues.\n\nI replaced both rear mudguards as the outside metal had started to rust through. The new ones are half plastic but \nlook identical, so they should last longer.\n\nI\u2019m starting to notice a slight drag in the gearbox from start-up, which means I have to select reverse first and roll \nback a couple of inches before I get the forward gear I want.\n\nIt only usually happens when it\u2019s cold but it is a problem that wasn\u2019t there when I bought it.\n\nMy view is that I don\u2019t pay hire charges or monthly payment plans so if a big repair is needed then I\u2019ll pay it, as it\u2019s \nthe trade-off with running older kit.\n\nWill you ever sell it?\n\nNo. It\u2019s a tractor that I\u2019ll keep forever and will probably carry me to my funeral. I\u2019ve been offered double what I paid \nfor it, I\u2019ve even had a written cheque put into my hand but I have refused every time.\n\n\n\nFor me it\u2019s more than a tractor as it\u2019s been the machine that has allowed my business to expand and take on more \nwork.\n\nMy dream second tractor would be a John Deere 7810 in similar condition and spec but these are becoming much \nrarer and every time a good example comes up at a dealer, they are snapped up instantly.\n\nJohn Deere 6610\n\nEngine \u2013 JD 6.8-litre six-cylinder\n\nTransmission \u2013 Auto quad\n\nTorque \u2013 486Nm @ 1,300rpm\n\nPower \u2013 114hp\n\nTop speed \u2013 50kph\n\nSpool valves \u2013 3\n\nTyres \u2013 BKT\n\nPTO \u2013 three-speed\n\nHours \u2013 13,750\n\nPrice paid \u2013 \u00a317,500 (2013)\n\nHow much is a JD 6610 fetching now?\n\nJD 6610 with Stoll front loader\n\nYear \u2013 1999\n\nHours \u2013 9,625\n\nTransmission - Powerquad\n\nTyres \u2013 Rears 80%, Front 30%\n\nCondition \u2013 Very good\n\nPrice \u2013 \u00a318,995\n\nWhere \u2013 JF Engineering, based near Milton Keynes, Bedfordshire\n\nJD 6610 SE\n\nYear \u2013 2000\n\nHours \u2013 10,300\n\nTransmission \u2013 Powerquad\n\nTyres \u2013 Rears 40%, Tyres 20%\n\nCondition \u2013 Average and low spec\n\n\n\nPrice \u2013 \u00a319,375\n\nWhere \u2013 Farmers Weekly classifieds, based in Germany\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nAfter featuring a succession of high-mileage Japanese 4x4s, we\u2019ve been presented with a slightly surprising new \nchart topper \u2013 a 1990s Land Rover Discovery.\n\nTo anyone who\u2019s owned one of these vehicles, it may seem a little far-fetched that an example has managed to \nsurpass the half-a-million-mile mark.\n\nAs our regular columnist and seasoned Land Rover owner Stephen Carr recently pointed out: \u201cI fear the bar has \nbeen set too high for me \u2013 the one I drive most of the time has started to push alarming quantities of oil out of the \nbreather, despite several visits to the garage.\u201d\n\nBut Northamptonshire-based self-employed contractor Martin Rainbow has managed to buck the reliability trend \nand eke a staggering, and relatively trouble-free, 540,000 miles from his 1996 model.\n\nOriginal running gear\n\nMartin Rainbow\u2019s Land Rover Discovery\n\nYear 1996\n\nPurchased 1998\n\nPurchase mileage 96,000 miles\n\nMileage now 540,000\n\nEngine 2.5-litre four-cylinder Land Rover 300Tdi\n\nPower 111hp\n\nTorque 263Nm\n\nTransmission R380 five-speed manual\n\nPrice paid \u00a313,500\n\nAs the rules of this series dictate, this Solihull-built truck still has its original engine and most other major parts are \nits first too, including the five-speed manual transmission and the starter motor.\n\nMr Rainbow is the Discovery\u2019s second owner, having bought it when it was just 18 months old and on an already \nhigh 93,000 miles.\n\n\u201cI paid \u00a313,500 for it, which was a lot for me at the time,\u201d he says. \u201cI then had plenty of sleepless nights wondering if \nI\u2019d done the right thing.\u201d\n\nBut since then he\u2019s clocked up about 20,000 miles a year and every year it goes through its MOT with very little \nbother.\n\n\u201cWhen it went in for its first service the chap said: \u2018There are good and bad ones of these \u2013 yours looks like its going \nto be a good \u2018un\u2019.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo keep it mechanically sound Mr Rainbow has continued to carry out a full service every 6,000 to 8,000 miles, \nincluding all oils and filters.\n\nFor most of its early life, this involved filling the block with straight mineral oil, but now he\u2019s ungraded to semi-\nsynthetic 15W40. \u201cWhen it\u2019s running on this it doesn\u2019t burn a drop,\u201d he says.\n\nLong-lasting engine\n\nThe engine fitted is Land Rover\u2019s 2.5-litre 300Tdi turbo diesel that, when new, developed 111bhp and 263Nm \ntorque.\n\nApart from regular servicing, this has had just one core plug replaced and it is still on its original head gasket. The \ntappets were adjusted about 12 years ago and they\u2019re still OK now.\n\nOne possible reason for the engine\u2019s longevity is the fact that Mr Rainbow gives it a regular dose of Millers diesel \nadditive. This apparently helps lubricate the fuel system and the engine in general.\n\nHe uses regular pump diesel and during general, mixed driving an 80-litre tank will get him about 600 miles (about \n34mpg). However, on a long, cruisy run this will nudge up to almost 40mpg.\n\nTougher transmission\n\nUnlike earlier 200 Tdis that were known for gearbox problems, this 300 model had a beefed-up version that\u2019s still \ngoing strong.\n\nThere\u2019s apparently just a slight crunch when going into second as, understandably, the synchro is slightly worn.\n\nThe transducer that controls the speedometer also stopped working a few years ago and it took a month or two for \nhim to get around to fixing it. As a result the odometer reads only 537,000.\n\nOther mechanical work has included three clutches \u2013 the original lasted for 370,000 miles, but the second was \nmuch shorter as the garage forgot to fit the version with a heavy-duty selector fork.\n\nShow us yours\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a high-mileage 4 --4 that\u2019s given you sterling service and is still on its original engine, we\u2019d like to hear \nfrom you.\n\nThe trucks above are clearly tough to beat, so we\u2019d be interested to see vehicles with 350,000 miles or more on the \nclock. Thankfully we\u2019re no longer eagerly awaiting news of a vehicle from the Land Rover stable that\u2019s made it into \nthe high-mileage club.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to be featured, email a few details to James Andrews\n\nIt has also had a pair of rear brake callipers, an alternator, one radiator and new track rod ends.\n\nBut the rest of the mechanicals are original, including the steering box, front suspension turrets and the exhaust \u2013 \nalthough this has had some welding.\n\nBut it\u2019s the bodywork that has required most of the attention. Over the years it\u2019s had two sets of sills, front inner \nwing sections, repairs to the rear inner wings and a new boot floor.\n\nMr Rainbow carried out all of these repairs himself using a mix of pre-made repair panels and some he fabricated \nhimself.\n\nThe original set of replacement sills came from Land Rover, but these were expensive and rotted out quickly.\n\n\n\nThe next set were galvanised versions from an independent suppler, which are still solid.\n\nSome of the electrics have also had attention, particularly the ECU. \u201cI\u2019ve learnt my way around it over the years and \nI can usually pinpoint any problems pretty quickly,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re not expensive to fix either.\u201d\n\nDespite the mileage, the truck is still Mr Rainbow\u2019s daily driver and he has no plans to change it or reduce its \nworkload. \u201cIt\u2019s a working vehicle and although I look after it mechanically it doesn\u2019t get pampered,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAfter all this time it\u2019s got quite a bit of sentimental value and I still enjoy driving it.\u201d\n\nOther high-milers\n\nHere\u2019s the league table of mile-munching motors we\u2019ve featured in the past:\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nSheep farmers are being urged to build positive relations with dog owners to highlight the devastating impact of \nsheep worrying.\n\nThe National Sheep Association (NSA) says farmers should target the many agricultural events and shows taking \nplace this summer to reach out to the public and promote responsible dog ownership.\n\nThe serious problem of livestock worrying is well recognised by farmers and the wider industry, but more work must \nbe done with the dog-owning public to stop attacks which are \u201ccompletely avoidable\u201d.\n\nSee also: Special Investigation shows police are failing to crack down on sheep worrying\n\nIn particular, the NSA says there must be improved behaviour from the minority of dog walkers that \u201callow their \nanimals to run free around livestock, often with devastating results\u201d.\n\nNSA spokesman Katie James said: \u201cBrowbeating the public and portraying negative messages about shooting dogs \nis not an effective message.\n\n\u201cWe want to share a positive message about dog owners enjoying the beautiful landscapes in Britain, which are \ncreated by the hard work of sheep farmers, and to do so responsibly and consider the impact an attack can have on \nfarmers business and livelihood.\u201d\n\nFor several years, the NSA has collected data and opinions on sheep worrying attacks to gain an insight into its \nseverity and consequences.\n\nFinancial and emotional cost\n\nNSA surveys have highlighted the financial and emotional cost of sheep worrying on farmers. For example, 85% of \nsheep farmers who have suffered sheep worrying attacks experience feelings of stress and anxiety, leading to \nalmost a quarter of those affected subsequently considering giving up sheep farming.\n\n\u201cThis personal angle is a really important one to share when talking about attacks on sheep, as dog owners often \nthink their pets are \u2018just playing\u2019 and do not understand the wider picture,\u201d added Mrs James.\n\nThe NSA will be spreading the messages of improving relations with the wider public and the importance of \nreporting attacks at shows and events throughout the summer.\n\nMeanwhile, it wants farmers to report all incidents of livestock worrying to the police to help build an accurate \npicture of the true scale of the problem.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\n\n\nOilseed rape growers now have a high-yielding option that offers resistance to the turnip yellows virus, which can \nreduce yields by up to 30%.\n\nArchitect is the only variety on the current AHDB Recommended List that has resistance to the virus. It replaces \nAmalie, which was some 10% behind the top yielder for gross output on the previous year\u2019s list.  \n\nSee also: What the 5 new sugar beet varieties offer\n\nDavid Bouch, seeds manager at Hutchinsons, believes if a farmer is growing hybrids or a mix of hybrid and \nconventional types, Architect should be one to consider as part of the variety mix.\n\n\u201cIt can help with risk management and is the only one on the list offering turnip yellows resistance. Also, it is only 2-\n3% behind the mainstream varieties on yield,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Limagrain variety is the result of the company\u2019s German breeding programme, which has a good pedigree for \nturnip yellows virus resistance. It has nine varieties at the moment, plus more in the pipeline.\n\nAphids\n\nTurnip yellows virus is spread by peach potato aphids and monitoring last year found high levels of infection, with \nsome sites showing 100% of aphids were carrying the virus.\n\nInsecticides can be used to control the disease; however, getting the timing right can be difficult, as it varies year to \nyear, says John Challans, seed specialist at Nickerson Seeds.\n\n\u201cIf you spray a crop and it happens to be the tail end of a peak, they can come in again to infect the crop. The spray \nis only effective for 10 days, so it is difficult to hit migration of aphids,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cSo by the time you see aphids, it [the disease] is already there and it is too late.\u201d\n\nMr Bouch believes farmers can use Architect to help manage risk, acting as an insurance in a high disease year.\n\n\u201cBy growing one to two fields of the variety, farmers don\u2019t need to worry about the disease across this area,\u201d he \nsays.\n\nOther benefits\n\nIt is not just about turnip yellows; the variety brings other agronomic benefits including strong vigour and pod shatter \nresistance.\n\nWolfgang Lueders, European oilseed rape product manager at Limagrain, highlights its strong vigour.\n\n\u201cThis allows good establishment and restart of growth in the following spring, even under unfavourable conditions in \nthe field,\u201d he says.\n\nMr Bouch sees the value of pod shatter resistance, offering some protection against losses during summer storms. \n\u201cThis is becoming more and more important,\u201d he says. \u201cI have seen empty pods in crops without pod shatter \nresistance after a storm, while in a variety with [resistance], the pods were largely intact.\u201d\n\n \n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var \ni=\"InfogramEmbeds\",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?\"http:\":\"https:\";if(/^\\/{2}/.test(s)&&(\ns=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var \na=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,\"script\",\"infogram-\nasync\",\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\");\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nMr Bouch says one minor quibble is Architect's stem canker disease rating of five, which is a little low \u2013 ideally he \nwould like to see a rating of at least 6.\n\nHe also points to its performance in the north with a gross output at 99%, of control, which is a little behind the top \nyielder. Therefore, he believes it is more suited for growing south of the Humber.\n\nSo what are the yield benefits? Mr Challans highlights European trials carried out in 2015 and 2016 showing that \nyields increase as turnip yellows virus levels rise.\n\nThe variety delivered an 11% yield advantage at sites with very high infection levels.\n\nHe says this equates to 0.5t/ha in a high-disease pressure situation. Pod shatter resistance brings another 0.4t/ha \nin a high-risk situation, adding up to nearly 1t of extra yield.\n\nSecond breeder plans to introduce turnip yellows virus resistance\n\nResistance to turnip yellows virus is also set to become a key feature of varieties from fellow breeder DSV, with a \ncandidate up for recommendation later this year.\n\nTemptation could be the first UK variety from DSV to carry full resistance to the virus, says Sarah Hawthorn of DSV \nUK.\n\n\u201cWorking with our colleagues in Germany, we\u2019re confident that virtually all new DSV varieties will carry turnip \nyellows virus resistance, with trials across Europe showing very impressive results,\u201d she says.\n\nThe breeder says Temptation has strong autumn vigour, which makes it suitable for medium-late drilling.\n\nIt has a disease rating of 6 for light leaf spot and 5 for stem canker and in 2017 was ranked number one in France.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA sheep race scrapped after farm owners received threats from animal rights activists is to return this weekend after \nvets gave it the all clear.\n\nHoo Farm in Preston Upon the Weald, Shropshire had been entertaining families for nearly 30 years with its bank \nholiday sheep-racing tradition.\n\nOrganisers were forced to cancel the event at Easter after being targeted by activists and vegans, who branded the \nevent \u201ccruel\u201d and \u201cinhumane\u201d.\n\nSee also: Easter sheep run cancelled after vegan threats\n\nOwner Will Dorrell, 27, said he scrapped the Sheep Gold Cup and the Sheep Grand National races after staff \nreceived verbal and physical threats.\n\nMore than 50,000 people signed a petition calling for the event to be banned, arguing it goes against the timid \nnature of sheep.\n\nBut vets from the government\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) said they were satisfied the event would \nnot compromise the sheep\u2019s welfare.\n\nSheep welfare \u2018not compromised\u2019\n\nIn a statement on its Facebook page, Hoo Farm said: \u201cWe are delighted to announce the return of the world-famous \nsheep steeplechasing this Saturday (26 May).\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter a review of the racing and the entire farm by two vets from the APHA on the 19 April, they were satisfied the \nwelfare of the sheep was not compromised by being involved in the racing.\u201d\n\nHowever, the vets did make three recommendations to the organisers to help the perception of sheep racing and to \nmake it even safer.\n\nOrganisers released a five-minute video on Facebook explaining the recommendations, which included a make a \nchange in the sheep\u2019s food, recording which sheep are used in which race, and changing the material the fences \nwere made from to foam.\n\nIn a statement on Facebook, animal activists group Lambentations, which organised the petition, said: \u201cAll our hard \nwork undone by the APHA.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA Scottish Blackface sheep, bred by renowned farmer Malcolm Coubrough, has been selected as the \u201chero image\u201d \nfor this year\u2019s Royal Highland Show (21-24 June).\n\nThe ewe, which won the Breed Title last year, is featuring the length and breadth of Scotland on billboards and \nbuses \u2013 as well as on social media and TV.\n\n\u201cYou never go to a show expecting to win, but once we\u2019d won the class, I knew we had a chance,\u201d the Lanarkshire \nfarmer said.\n\n\u201cIt was an absolutely fantastic moment. I haven\u2019t won many shows, so that was definitely the biggest win I\u2019ve had. I \ngot a lovely reaction from my fellow breeders.\u201d\n\nSee also: Blackface ewe hits 11,000gns at Lanark\n\nLaunched at St Andrew Square in Edinburgh, the campaign has involved a photoshoot \u2013 which Mr Coubrough\u2019s  \ndaughter, Emily (after whom the sheep was named), also attended.\n\n\u201cI was a little bit nervous about taking a Blackface ewe into the centre of the city,\u201d he said. \u201cBut she was relaxed and \ntotally chilled out. It\u2019s been a great experience.\u201d\n\nFamily affair\n\nThe family\u2019s enterprises are spread over four farms, covering about 2,430ha (6,000 acres).\n\nAt the heart of it are Mr Coubrough and his wife, Audrey; their children Emily and Charlie; his parents Malcolm and \nElla; and shepherds Gordon MacDougal and Ross Henderson.\n\n \n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var \ni=\"InfogramEmbeds\",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?\"http:\":\"https:\";if(/^\\/{2}/.test(s)&&(\ns=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var \na=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,\"script\",\"infogram-\nasync\",\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\");\n\nThe stock includes about 1,900 pure Blackies \u2013 an iconic breed the family have always kept.\n\n\u201cBlackface sheep breeding is either in you or it\u2019s not and I was hooked as a wee lad after following Dad at lambing \ntime round the hill,\u201dMr Coubrough recalled.\n\n\n\u201cThe breed is all about character. It\u2019s a well-balanced animal with plenty of size, a good body and displaying a lot of \ncharacter in the head.\u201d \n\nTough breed\n\nHe adds: \u201cIt is bred to survive the brutality that the Scottish Highlands can throw at it, so it needs to have the \nqualities and temperament to cope with the harshest environments.\n\n\u201cThis has been particularly important this year, as we\u2019re coming out of one of the worst winters and springs I can \nremember. There might not be as many lambs on the ground as normal \u2013 but we\u2019ve still got a product to sell.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a prolific breed. The better you look after a Blackie, the better she looks after you.\u201d\n\nAmong Mr Coubrough\u2019s highlights are a shearling which made \u00a310,000 last year and one that went for \u00a312,000 two \nyears ago. \u201cThe family record is \u00a316,000, though. That\u2019s the benchmark set by my dad \u2013 that\u2019s the one I\u2019ve got to \nbeat!\n\n\u201cMuch of the Scottish landscape has been shaped by native breeds, which have grazed the geography of this \ncountry for centuries. We owe a lot to these breeds for the beauty that we see. \n\n\u201cThey have also provided an income for generations of farmers who have relied on their hardiness to generate a \nliving \u2013 which has been vital for the economy of rural Scotland.\u201d\n\nBiggar-based Mr Coubrough will be showing four sheep at this year\u2019s show.\n\n\u201cLike I say, you don\u2019t go expecting to win \u2013 but we\u2019re taking the best we\u2019ve got and, if we\u2019re competitive, we\u2019ll have \na chance.\u201d\n\nBreed facts\n\nBlackface have a coarse, dense fleece that is resistant to biting winds and rainfall\n\nGood at maintaining condition on poor forage, generally with no supplementary feed\n\nPurebred ewes may be crossed with breeds such as the Bluefaced Leicester to produce larger, more commercial, \nNorth Country and Scotch Mules\n\nLambing is late \u2013 around March-April \u2013 but the breed can give birth unaided and has good mothering abilities\n\nThe wool is used in a variety of products including carpets, tweeds and mattresses\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe owner of an upland sheep and cattle farm in South Wales has sorted out her succession plan by bringing her \nfarmworker into the business as a junior partner and future heir.\n\nLorraine Howells, 70, who has lived and worked all her life at Cwmcarno Farm near Merthyr Tydfil, was determined \nthat her holding would pass to a young person who would continue her work despite having no family member \ninterested in taking it on. \n\nThat\u2019s why she has brought Lee Pritchard, 26, who has worked on the farm for 10 years, into the business as a \njunior partner this year and she has said he can continue to work on the farm for as long as he wishes.\n\nSee also: 10 pieces of advice for young people starting in agriculture\n\nNo money has changed hands for his stake in the business, but Ms Howells says that this doesn\u2019t mean people \nshould think it hasn\u2019t cost him anything.\n\n\n\n\u201cYoung people don\u2019t have an opportunity to save up. It has been his hard work over the last 10 years that has been \nhis contribution, rather than a lump sum,\u201d she says.\n\nGelligaer YFC chairman Mr Pritchard, 26, had previously been working on the farm on a self-employed basis.\n\nHe grew up just a few miles from the farm and has always had an interest in agriculture.\n\n\u201cI have always wanted to farm and have put everything aside for that,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cNot much has changed at this stage except I can sign the cheques,\u201d he explains, saying they had already been \ndiscussing business decisions together before the transition.\n\nThe 161ha farm, which also enjoys grazing rights on the adjoining Gelligaer and Merthyr Common, supports 800 \n\u201cNelson\u201d South Wales Mountain ewes and 30 Welsh Black cattle.\n\nMuch of the land is still affected by the legacy of opencast coal mining, common in the area until the 1970s, which \nhas disrupted soil drainage, making land prone to be either very dry or wet.\n\nVenture scheme funding\n\nMr Pritchard became a partner in the business on 1 January this year after funding from Farming Connect\u2019s Venture \nservice helped navigate the legal hurdles.\n\nVenture, a matchmaking service designed to pair up landowners who are looking to step back from the industry with \nnew entrants, offers funding for business planning and legal guidance.\n\nThe new partners say that once they had agreed on a course of action, the actual formalities were fairly \nstraightforward, with one joint meeting between a solicitor, accountant and them able to iron out most details.\n\nAll the work done by the solicitor was paid for, and they also benefited from free business planning.\n\nMs Howells says that she is not alone in having to make a decision that some may regard as radical.\n\n\u201cThe hardest thing to do is letting go. I have made all the decisions on my own here for years [but] older people \ncan\u2019t do the work, and younger people have not got the money to buy into a business. It is something that a lot of \nfarmers have to recognise,\u201d she warns.\n\nShe says the only other alternatives would have been to sell the farm, which would have meant her having to leave \nher home, or grass letting, which would have also meant losing control to an extent.\n\nBringing a successor into the business has therefore been the option which has given them both long-term security \nand, while both parties laughingly admit they \u201cargue like hell\u201d, a frank exchange of viewpoints often sees \ndisagreements getting resolved.\n\nGood working relationship\n\nThis good working relationship has also given them confidence to plan for the future, and they have jointly \npurchased a block of land some 11 miles away from the main holding.\n\nThis will support a planned increase in both ewe and cattle numbers as well as adding higher-quality grazing land \nwith a view to fattening more lambs off grass and forage crops.\n\nCwmcarno is one of five farms that supply Cig Mynydd Cymru (Welsh Mountain Meat), a butcher\u2019s shop in the \nnearby village of Treharris, and it also sells meat at local farmers\u2019 markets.\n\n\n\nThey say that selling via the shop has enabled them to improve prices for their livestock and given them the security \nof having a guaranteed market for at least a portion of their output.\n\nA portion of the flock are crossed to Texel and Suffolk rams, with the remainder put back to the Welsh ram to \nprovide replacements or sold through the breeding ring.\n\nIncreasing carcass weights of the lambs going into the food chain is a key focus as they look to Brexit-proof their \nbusiness, as the main outlet for lighter lambs is the vulnerable European market.\n\nIt\u2019s a similar story in the cattle enterprise, with a Charolais bull recently purchased to increase the weaning weight of \ncalves, which will then be sold store instead of fat.\n\nA portion of the herd will continue to be kept pure Welsh Black, and fattened, as a premium can be realised from \nmarketing them through the butchery, with the aim being to double cow numbers by retaining more females for \nbreeding.\n\nWhat is the Venture scheme?\n\nRun by Farming Connect, the Welsh government\u2019s organisation for delivering European rural development funding, \nVenture is a matchmaking scheme designed to pair up young entrants looking for land and landowners seeking \nsomeone to collaborate with.\n\nAs well as introducing potential new business partners, the scheme also funds business planning for the new \nventure.\n\nThere are more than 300 members, with 40 potential matches currently being investigated to see if they will support \njoint venture options.\n\nTo date, nine partnerships have completed the process and established a business together, and 14 partnerships \nare in the final stages of completion.\n\nAnyone in Wales interested in finding out how to get involved can  visit the Farming Connect Venture website or call \n08456 000 813.\n\nWhat to do if you live outside of Wales\n\nA similar scheme also exists for those in England and Scotland, called the Fresh Start Land Enterprise.\n\nThis offers advice for those who are looking to set up a business, enter a joint venture, develop existing family \nbusinesses or have an opportunity to offer others.\n\nThere are currently 11 opportunities advertised on its website from both landowners and those looking for an \nopportunity to go into partnership.\n\nNorthern Irish farmers looking to register their interest in participating in a joint venture scheme should contact the \nLand Mobility Scheme Northern Ireland.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nWith fresh thinking and bags of energy to back them up, young people can make amazing entrepreneurs.\n\nTaking on the extra work of starting up a new business may seem daunting for many people, so imagine launching \na venture while also attending lectures, writing essays and revising for exams.\n\nWe spoke to inspiring students who are juggling the world of commerce with their academic work to find why they \ndecided to take the leap and how they manage such a bold move. Meet the students who mean business.\n\n\n\nSee also: 10 pieces of advice for young people starting in agriculture\n\nJohn and Hannah\n\nNever take chairs to a show or event \u2013 however much time you are going to spend on your feet.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the abiding rules of John Davies and Hannah Kinston, who run a thriving cheese retailing business in \ntandem with their university studies.\n\nThe principle is a simple one: if you take chairs it\u2019s tempting to sit down. By moving around, greeting potential \ncustomers and being enthusiastic, you can be more welcoming and get people to visit your stand.\n\n\u201cAbout half the people who try will buy \u2013 but you\u2019ve got to get out there and talk to them, rather than waiting for \nthem to come to you,\u201d says 21-year-old John.\n\nBoth second-year degree students, the pair sell cheese they buy from the award-winning Cheshire cheesemaker \nJoseph Heler.\n\nIt\u2019s got a distinctly personal connection \u2013 milk from Hannah's family\u2019s dairy herd in Derbyshire supplies the cheese \nmaker.\n\nJohn and Hannah\u2019s top tip: Ask customers lots of questions and really listen to what they tell you.\n\nThey launched the enterprise in 2016 and now offer a range of more than 15 products at shows, via hamper orders \nand through farm shops, including the one at Chatsworth House.\n\nThey will attend 20-plus shows during 2018, including the Leicestershire County Show and the Ashby Show. The \nannual Open Farm Sunday event at Hannah\u2019s family farm near Burton-on-Trent is another big date in their \ncalendar, typically attracting about 2,000 visitors.\n\nVisitors are fascinated by \u201cthe girls\u201d \u2013 the Jersey cows that produce some of the milk that ends up in their products.\n\n\u201cYoung people aren\u2019t lazy\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople, especially more elderly ones, like the fact that we\u2019re doing this,\" explains 20-year-old Hannah. \"There can \nbe a perception that young people are lazy and just mess around, wasting their student loans \u2013 so they like to \nsupport us because we\u2019re working hard and really trying to make a go of this.\u201d\n\nFor John, reading agri-business at Harper Adams University, and Hannah, studying veterinary medicine at the \nUniversity of Nottingham\u2019s Sutton Bonington, it\u2019s not always easy juggling a growing business with their studies.\n\n\u201cThere have been times when we\u2019ve been surviving on between two and six hours sleep a night, but it makes sense \nto go the extra mile to establish the business at this point in our lives,\u201d Hannah says.\n\nSee also: Job profile: What's it like to be an agronomist?\n\nTheir approach is to set prices at levels that are \u201caccessible for everyone\u201d to capitalise on the exploding demand, \npartly among the younger generation.\n\n\u201cYou used to see burger vans outside nightclubs \u2013 now it\u2019s vans selling cheese toasties,\u201d says John, who is from a \nfamily farm in Snarestone, Leicestershire. \u201cYounger customers always want to try the chilli smoked cheddar. It\u2019s got \na real kick to it.\u201d\n\nFor this entrepreneurial couple, cheese could also prove a stepping stone to something bigger \u2013 they\u2019re currently \nrearing a small batch of rose veal calves and, potentially trading as Jersey Boy Beef, are exploring opportunities to \nsell prime meat cuts and luxury burgers.\n\n\n\nBiJimini\n\nIdeas come from the most unexpected places, according to Luke Craven.\n\nThis Royal Agricultural University student had his eureka moment in the car when he passed a van transporting \ninsects for reptile food.\n\nHe\u2019d recently learnt during his international business course about how a world protein shortage was looming.\n\nPut the two things together and he and his now-business partner, Adam Gray, forged their big idea \u2013 farming \ncrickets for human consumption.\n\nThere\u2019s a huge demand for sustainable protein sources and the pressure on farmland from housing is getting ever \ngreater.\n\nThe duo realised that crickets could be kept on a small piece of land, their methane emissions are minuscule and \nthey are a great source of protein.\n\nAnd so BiJimini was born, a Wiltshire-based business that produces a cricket flour, using organic flour from local \nmillers blended with a fine-milled cricket powder.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got space for 65,000 crickets,\u201d 22-year-old Luke said. \u201cIf we were farming 65,000 cows, we\u2019d need half of \nEngland.\u201d\n\nUsing them in a pre-mixed flour was a very deliberate decision, to avoid having to sell them whole. \u201cThis avoids the \n\u2018yuk\u2019 factor,\u201d explains Luke.\n\nBiJimini farms tropical house crickets, which are indigenous to Asia. They sourced the original breeding stock from \nthe Netherlands, and now breed their own. \n\nLuke's top tip: Do your market research thoroughly before you launch \u2013 you can never do too much of this.\n\nIt\u2019s been a massive challenge learning about the breeding, feeding and environmental conditions in which they \nperform best.\n\nWhile the critters\u2019 exact diet remains a closely-guarded secret, the entrepreneurs say they\u2019ve been sourcing organic \nvegetable waste from local farmers.\n\n\u201cOne day, we\u2019d like to get the product certified as organic, but at present there\u2019s nobody that will do this because \ncrickets are so unusual,\u201d Luke says.\n\nDelicious, nutty flavour\n\nThey currently sell face-to-face on a relatively small scale and through their recently launched website, but hope to \nstart retailing their tasty PowerFlour via online supermarkets soon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got a slightly nutty flavour compared to ordinary flour. It\u2019s delicious,\u201d says Luke.\n\nWhile he reckons it frequently feels as if there are not enough hours in the day, there are big synergies between \nrunning the business and studying. \u201cWhat I\u2019m learning on the course is hugely helpful to the business, and vice \nversa.\u201d\n\nThe pair won the RAU\u2019s Grand Idea Awards in 2017, netting a \u00a310,000 prize and ongoing support from the \nuniversity, such as providing stand space for them at this year's Badminton Horse Trials.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you start a business, you\u2019ve got to believe in yourself and your product. If you\u2019re going to do it, just go for it,\u201d \nsays Luke.\n\nC&C Farming\n\nYou\u2019ll never get a better time to launch a business that when you\u2019re a student, according to Chris Webb.\n\nYou probably haven\u2019t got any dependants, you\u2019re unlikely to have a mortgage or assets to lose, and you\u2019re \nsurrounded by lecturers who\u2019ll offer you free advice, he says.\n\nNow 40, Chris launched a calf-rearing venture with Chris Roberts and Larry Anscombe in 2014 when he was a \nmature student at Reaseheath College.\n\nAt the time he was studying agriculture, selling a technology business he had started a few years previously and \ngetting the calf enterprise off the ground. Time management quickly became a key skill.\n\n\u201cWhen you put together an idea for a farming business, it\u2019s not necessarily a case of finding a big gap in the market \nbecause they may not exist. It\u2019s more about considering what skills and resources you\u2019ve got and how to use these \nin a way that isn't already being done by too many other people,\" he says.\n\nData-driven\n\n\u201cCalf rearing didn\u2019t require land or millions of pounds of investment and has a relatively high gross margin. It\u2019s also \nquick turnover, so better from a cashflow point of view compared with finishing beef cattle, which can tie money up \nfor 18 months or longer.\u201d\n\nChris founded his first technology company when he was an undergraduate studying maths at Cambridge in the \n1990s.\n\nChris\u2019s top tip: Pick an enterprise that makes best use of the assets, skills and resources you have. If you haven't \ngot land, there are plenty of enterprises that don't need it.\n\n\u201cMy background gave me a slightly different perspective. My instinct is to automate to make processes more \nefficient.\n\n\"We\u2019re quite data driven \u2013 I like to know exactly what the calves drink and eat, what they're costing us and how \nquickly they grow.\n\n\u201cYou have to know your own strengths and capitalise on these. Similarly, be honest with yourself about your \nweaknesses. For example, I really enjoy working with the stock but I\u2019m not a natural salesman or tractor driver.\u201d\n\nThe Shropshire-based business, which now rears about 1,000 calves a year, buys stock at two to three weeks old, \nthen sells it at 14 to 18 weeks old. \n\n\u201cI\u2019d definitely encourage people to get an enterprise started when they\u2019re studying. You have to pick a sector you \nenjoy because you won\u2019t have the same drive and commitment if you don\u2019t enjoy it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the love for what you do that\u2019ll get you through the tough periods. I really enjoy working with cattle, especially \nyoungstock, and calf rearing is awesome.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nBrexit uncertainty and a hyper-competitive retail environment mean many businesses are gearing up to export the \nbest UK dairy has to offer.\n\n\n\nThe prospects for this trade are encouraging, with both export volumes and values for all UK dairy products \nenjoying sustained growth over the past two decades (see \"Key figures\", below).\n\nThe opportunities\n\nThe trend comes on the back of many consumers in other countries prioritising quality over cost, as highlighted by \nthe AHDB Horizon report, International Consumer Buying Behaviour.\n\nSee also: Dairy farming climbs to most profitable sector in England\n\nIt examined the buying habits of nine of the UK\u2019s prime export targets, including the US, China, India, Saudi Arabia \nand the UAE. Seven of the countries rated quality as the most important factor when choosing food.\n\nThe research also highlighted the complexities of exporting dairy products to multiple geographical markets where \nthere is wide variation in what consumers want.\n\nFor instance, in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and US, longevity is the primary factor for buying dairy goods, while in \nJapan and Canada, consumers are more concerned with price.\n\nKey figures\n\nBetween 1998 and 2017 the annual sales value of UK dairy exports increased by 134% to \u00a31.67bn, while export \nvolumes doubled to 1.36m tonnes.\n\nThe EU remains by far the largest market for UK dairy, accounting for 92.7% of UK exports in 2017.\n\nShipments to the EU over the same 19-year period grew by 153% in value to \u00a31.26bn, as volumes also shot up \n138.7% to 1.3m tonnes.\n\nDairy shipments to non-EU countries, which dropped 30% between 1998 and 2017, have picked up by 46% to \n106,208t since 2012, with export values burgeoning by 90% to \u00a3404.7m.\n\nWhile in 2017 the average price for 1kg of UK cheese at export was \u00a33.34 on the EU market, the same volume was \nworth \u00a34.02/kg to China, \u00a34.47/kg to India, \u00a35.67/kg to the UAE and 102% more to the US than the EU at \u00a36.74/kg, \naccording to HMRC.\n\n \n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var \ni=\"InfogramEmbeds\",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?\"http:\":\"https:\";if(/^\\/{2}/.test(s)&&(\ns=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var \na=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,\"script\",\"infogram-\nasync\",\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\");\n\n \n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var \ni=\"InfogramEmbeds\",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?\"http:\":\"https:\";if(/^\\/{2}/.test(s)&&(\ns=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var \na=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,\"script\",\"infogram-\nasync\",\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\");\n\nAfter the 2008 melamine scandal caused  the deaths of six babies and 300,000 more fell ill due to contaminated \ninfant formula, the average Chinese consumer\u2019s top priority became food safety \u2013 a quality that consumers see as \nsynonymous with products carrying the Union flag.\n\n\nHowever, diverging consumer demands means understanding the global export market is complex, and comes with \nsignificant costs.\n\nUK dairy products therefore remain niche around the world, with the highest proportion of respondents (43%) \nstating they simply didn\u2019t know how they felt about UK produce as they had had no exposure to it.\n\nThe report stressed dairy farmers were the integral link in the supply chain for selling the \u201cfarm-to-fork\u201d story of how \nthe food is produced.\n\nWyke farms exporting strategy\n\nFew people know the difficulty of penetrating individual markets better than Wyke Farms chief executive, Rich \nClothier.\n\nWyke currently lists 167 regions on its exports roster, with 30% of the company\u2019s total production currently being \nsent overseas.\n\nBut Mr Clothier wants to increase this to 50%, while focusing more resources on fewer markets \u2013 and it\u2019s all linked \nto wine.\n\nThe \u201cChablis Index\u201d is part of the Wyke lexicon and is one of the processor\u2019s methods of establishing which new \nmarkets to enter. The rationale is if the target society enjoys a glass of French or Australian wine, chances are they \nwill buy some premium cheddar too.\n\nEach new market brings unique challenges to the business (see \u201cWyke Farms key considerations for businesses \nconsidering exporting\u201d), but the benefits far outweigh the costs, says Mr Clothier, who estimates that Wyke\u2019s \npresence in overseas markets is worth 2p/litre to the firm\u2019s dairy farmers.\n\nExports have also insulated the processor\u2019s 130 milk producers against exposure to the worst troughs of domestic \nmilk market volatility.\n\nMr Clothier believes the UK has a long way to go to catch up with the likes of Ireland, whose dairy exports were \nworth more than double the UK\u2019s at 4.05bn (\u00a33.52bn) in 2017.\n\n\u201cIreland do very well already,\u201d he says, \u201cKerrygold butter is in virtually every US supermarket.\u201d\n\nMr Clothier says it is essential for Defra to do more to help companies export and open up new markets, but also for \nthe government to be less hawkish in world diplomacy.\n\n\u201cI would like to see the UK take a backseat in world affairs. We should be inviting people like [Donald] Trump to the \nUK with open arms.\u201d\n\nMr Clothier adds: \u201cHe is the leader of the richest country in the world and we are risking trade deals with the states \nwith negative rhetoric. We should be getting on with everyone.\u201d \n\nWyke Farms key considerations for businesses considering exporting\n\nNot all milk buyers are active in export markets \u2013 are you missing out on farmgate premiums of about 2p/litre?\n\nProtecting your brand is costly. Depending on the region, it can cost between \u00a310,000 and \u00a320,000 to register a \nbrand and this can take years. It took Wyke a decade to get into Russia.\n\nWyke had to go to court in Australia as someone tried to copy their brand. The cheese company won, but at great \nlegal expense.\n\nCertain products need to be blessed. Rabbis and imams must be flown in to assure religious certification.\n\n\n\nLabelling must be customised for each market. Different countries demand different elements. All of this adds to \ncosts.\n\nMany countries want 12 months on cheese sell-by dates, whereas the UK requires only eight months.\n\nIt takes nine months for Wyke cheese to reach the Falkland Islands and the taste can change while in transit.\n\n \n\nWhat does it take to export?\n\nOrganic dairy co-op OMSCo exports dairy products worth 20% of its annual turnover, but the processor has \nambitions to increase this to 50% in the coming years.\n\nOf the exports sent outside of the EU, 60% heads to the US under a United States Department of Agriculture \n(USDA)-accredited contract.\n\nMilk suppliers must receive individual farm accreditation from the USDA.\n\nOMSCo chairman Lyndon Edwards is one of 40 of the processor\u2019s 250 dairy farmers with that accreditation.\n\nThe accreditation is notoriously difficult to achieve, and Mr Edwards says it has assured that he is always pushing \nhimself towards the highest standards. \n\n\u201cWe make around a 2p/litre premium from the [USDA] contract, but the costs of adhering to it are higher, so it \nprobably levels out about even,\u201d says Mr Edwards.\n\n\u201cBut we enjoy the challenge of always being at the top of our game \u2013 as a farm we\u2019ve had to evolve, grow and be \nreally open-minded with what the contract is asking you to do.\u201d\n\nMr Edwards says the key for his farm business is faultless animal health to guarantee the highest-quality milk \u2013 one \nslip-up and you will lose a market forever, he says.\n\n\u201cWe take health so seriously we\u2019ve brought silaging in house to guarantee we get the highest quality. You cannot \nskip on attention to detail with exports.\u201d\n\nThe accreditation also requires the farm to change bedding twice a day and add extra feed enriched with selenium \nto help increase immunity.\n\n\u201cThe quality of the product is as important as the story behind it,\u201d says Mr Edwards.  \n\nOMSCo\u2019s number one export brand, Kingdom Cheddar, focuses strongly on branding, with a union flag and images \nof sweeping green British pastures, which global customers respond positively to, says Mr Edwards.\n\n\u201cFinally, the pricing has to be right \u2013 we can\u2019t be more expensive than our nearest rivals or the customer won\u2019t try \nour cheese in the first place.\n\n\u201cConsumers buy Kingdom on price first and return a second time because of the flavour.\u201d\n\nMr Edwards admits that belonging to a processor that has the ability to balance its milk supply and sell any surplus \nabroad may just have kept him in the milk game.\n\n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t join OMSCo when we did, we would have experienced the full volatility of the milk market \u2013 we would \nhave thought about getting out of milk altogether.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\n\n\nFarmers in England are taking effective measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the results of a Defra survey \nshow.\n\nThe Greenhouse gas mitigation practices \u2013 England Farm Practices Survey (FPS) 2018 [PDF]  provides a range of \nresults to show how seriously farmers in England are taking action to improve air quality.\n\nThe FPS asks questions about how farming practices are affected by agricultural and environmental issues.\n\nSee also: No progress on reducing agricultural emissions, says report\n\nThis survey, sent out in February, focused on practices relating to greenhouse gas mitigation, including nutrient \nmanagement, anaerobic digestion, emissions, fertiliser, manure and slurry spreaders, manure and slurry storage.\n\nFarm health planning and biosecurity, grassland and grazing, livestock feeding regimes and breeding practices, \nwere also covered in the survey.\n\nThe key results are summarised below:\n\nThe survey was sent to 6,037 holdings, which were targeted by farm type and size to ensure a representative \nsample.\n\nThe response rate was 40%. The full breakdown of results, by region, farm type and farm size will be available at \nthe end of June 2018.\n\nEarlier this week, Defra secretary Michael Gove said his department would be taking action to tackle ammonia \nemissions in farming, which accounts for 88% of all emissions.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe recent Health and Harmony consultation from Defra, while covering a wide range of policy options for post-\nBrexit agriculture, has been criticised by some for its lack of focus on human health and nutrition.\n\nBut a new report from Exeter University\u2019s Prof Michael Winter, designed to coincide with the inaugural Nuffield \nFarming Lecture in early July, suggests there are considerable opportunities for farmers to tap into the growing \ndemand for healthy food \u2013 with or without government support.\n\nSee also: Thousands respond to Defra\u2019s Health and Harmony consultation\n\nAccording to Prof Winter, food security is no longer solely about the availability of food, but also covers its nutritional \nquality.\n\n\u201cFor farmers, the potential for heightened attention to the nutritional content of their products extends far beyond the \ntraditional concerns of safety, quality and provenance,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the health consequences of the \u2018nutrition transition\u2019, farmers may face new market changes, \npresenting both challenges and opportunities.\u201d\n\nFragile situation\n\nProf Winter says he is reluctant to see extra demands imposed on farmers in the quest for a more nutritious food \nsupply, given the fragile economic situation that many face and the high degree of dependency on CAP payments, \nwhich are set to be phased out post Brexit.\n\n\u201cMerely to heap yet more demands on a beleaguered sector is inappropriate and unhelpful,\u201d he says.\n\n\nBut in some areas, there is potential for farmers to capitalise on the emerging demand for a better quality diet, \nespecially in the meat sector.\n\nAccording to Prof Winter, the growth of veganism is symptomatic of a much wider set of concerns about meat. But \nrather than mounting a vigorous pro-meat advertising campaign \u201cand so putting itself at odds with dietary \nrecommendations\u201d, he suggests the livestock sector should \u201cunderstand and adapt to change\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt has long been the case that white meat has been perceived as a healthier option than red meat and moreover, \nwhite meat can be seen as a more \u2018sustainable\u2019 option,\u201d says Prof Winter.\n\n\u201cWhat these arguments do not fully take into account are issues of animal welfare and the fact that ruminants, \nunlike pigs and poultry, can be fed on feed not directly palatable to humans such as grass and crop residues.\u201d\n\nThere is also a growing body of evidence that grass-raised beef has specific health benefits, which is enabling \nsome producer groups, such as Pasture For Life, to promote their meat on this basis.\n\nProf Winter cites research showing that grass-fed beef can significantly improve the fatty acid and antioxidant \ncontent of beef, as well as raising Omega 3 levels. It is also better for cholesterol levels.   \n\nFruit and veg\n\nThe Nuffield report also highlights fruit and vegetables as an area where there is a big trade deficit and, as such, an \nopportunity for farmers.\n\n\u201cThe scope to expand production of a range of soft fruit, apples, pears and plums, nuts and many vegetables is \nenormous, and plays well to both the health and local provenance agendas,\u201d says Prof Winter.\n\nHaving said that, he predicts challenges accessing sufficient seasonal labour post-Brexit, and points to the high \ncapital requirement to engage with some specialist crops.\n\nBeyond the fruit and vegetable sector, there are other opportunities for farmers to tap into the health food market \u2013 \nfor example, in the areas of whole grains, 'minor' cereals (such as spelt, rye and oats), and pulses, which can all \ndeliver benefits to consumers.\n\n\u201cConsumption patterns, and therefore demand for food, will change as a consequence of both increased consumer \nawareness and new policy imperatives,\u201d says Prof Winter. \u201cFarmers can either react as these developments unfold, \nor they can be proactive.\u201d\n\nPolicy initiatives\n\nWhile keen to avoid further burdens being placed on farmers, Prof Winter suggests a new policy framework is \nneeded to encourage better health and nutrition.\n\nIn particular, he welcomes Defra\u2019s drive towards paying \u201cpublic money for public goods\u201d, but says limiting this to \nthose services which the market cannot reward, such as the environment and recreation, is too narrow.\n\nHealthy food, says Prof Winter, is something which is \u201cmost palpably in the public interest\u201d and should also be \nsupported.\n\nHe describes it as \u201ca profound paradox\u201d that the sector that receives the least CAP support \u2013 horticulture \u2013 is the \none that has the most to offer in terms of healthy eating.\n\n\u201cI am not suggesting direct subsidies for horticultural products. But we could consider capital grants or loans to \nencourage appropriate investment, start-up assistance in marketing and, perhaps, a conversion scheme similar to \nthe successful Organic Conversion Scheme,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nProf Winter also suggests public research should have \u201chuman nutrition at its heart\u201d, while marketing initiatives \nshould be encouraged, such as \u201chealth proofing\u201d quality assurance schemes and building more robust supply \nchains.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe short, five-month grass growing season that Finnish farmers face will strike a chord with many UK counterparts \nfollowing one of the toughest spring growing seasons on record.\n\nYet progressive farmers in the Scandinavian country have doubled grass yields to more than 10,000kg DM/ha in \nthe past five years, overcoming hard winter frosts of -10C and heavy spring rainfall.\n\nProagria national grassland consultant Anu Ell\u00e4 told delegates at the Royal Welsh Grassland Event that the grass \ngrowing season typically ranged from 1 May to 19 October in the south and 9 June to 29 September in the north, \nwith many fields resembling a mud bath as close to six weeks before cutting.\n\nSee also: 12 varieties added to grass and clover recommended lists\n\n\u201cIn five months we have to produce all the silage for the next year so we have to be effective and we

consumed\n\nMs Ell\u00e4 explained how progressive Finnish farmers were working together in discussion groups to overcome these \nchallenging growing conditions.\n\nShe highlighted a group of 10 dairy farmers she is working with who have doubled grass yields from 5,480kg DM/ha \nannually to 10,425kg DM/ha, on average, in the past five years (see Table 1).\n\nMs Ell\u00e4 said Finnish farmers who had improved yield were choosing diverse grass mixes containing timothy for \nimproved winter hardiness and tall fescues for drought survivability.\n\nMeanwhile, tetraploid perennial ryegrasses, alsike clover and white clover are over-sown in the spring to replace \nthat lost to winter kill and increase D-value and palatability of second and third silage cuts.\n\nImproving sward density by adjusting cutting height to 10cm protected grass from frost and aided regrowth, Ms Ell\u00e4 \nsaid. \u201cEven soil surface of silage ground decreases the yield losses caused by ice damage and we don\u2019t mow in the \nautumn,\u201d she explained. \u201cGood density going into the winter prevents problems the following year and grass grows \nat 350kg/day before first cut.\u201d\n\nTable 1:

years, with some farms now using five or even six \nfungicide applications to protect yield.\n\nUnhappy with being dragged down this slippery slope, Kent grower Andrew Howard is moving away from a \nprescriptive chemical-reliant approach by adopting a system that focuses on soil health and plant nutrition to reduce \nthe impact of disease.\n\nA UK wheat production system that relies heavily on bagged fertiliser and pesticides has produced some world \nrecord-breaking yields in recent years, most notably the 16.52t/ha achieved in Northumberland in September 2015.\n\nSee also: How to find the best varieties on the revamped oilseed rape list\n\nMr Howard says this \u201chigh-input, high-output\u201d system can be successful, but comes with eye-watering costs and is \njustifiable only for those growers with the best land and climate.\n\nFarm Facts \u2013 Bockhanger Farms, Ashford, Kent\n\n\n\n330ha combinable crops\n\nSoil type \u2013 mixed (heavy clay/alluvial loam/sands)\n\nCropping \u2013 winter wheat, winter barley, spring barley, spring oats, spring beans, spring linseed, grass seed and \nintercrops (peas/spring rape and spring beans/spring rape)\n\nEstablishment system \u2013 no-till\n\nHeadland factor\n\nHis farm just outside Ashford sits on variable soils and in an area prone to yield-strangling hot spells during June. \nAverage field size is also small, meaning that on some fields 30-40% of the crop is on headlands.\n\nWhile his wheat can achieve 14t/ha in the middle of the smaller fields on the best soils, the headland factor drags \nhis average down to 9-10t/ha, so he can\u2019t justify high variable costs.\n\nHe also doesn\u2019t see the system having a bright future. \u201cI might be wrong, but I think that type of [high-input] farming \nis going to be phased out,\" he says.\n\n\u201cYou only have to look at Defra\u2019s 25-year environment plan to see that.\u201d\n\nKnowing his farm\u2019s limitations, Mr Howard went about researching how he could reduce this reliance on external \ninputs and reduce costs, while maintaining or even improving output of his crops in the process.\n\nInspired by Nutrition Rules!, a book by Australian agricultural consultant and plant nutrition expert Graeme Sait, he \ndiscovered an alternative philosophy to intensive agriculture that cuts use of chemicals and bagged fertiliser.\n\n\u201cIts basis is that all plant disease is linked with nutrition and if you get that right, disease should, in theory, \ndisappear. There has been a lot of work done in this area and there is reference after reference out there to back it \nup,\u201d he adds.\n\nHealthy soils\n\nGiving plants all the nutrients they need is impossible without healthy soil, and following 10 years of min-till and then \nstrip-till, the farm adopted a no-till establishment system in 2011 to further improve soil health and biology.\n\nMycorrhizal fungi and their association with plant roots are a fundamental factor in plant health and to avoid \nharming or reducing these fungi in the soil, Mr Howard is phasing out fungicide seed treatments on his cereal crops.\n\nHe also injects a liquid feed alongside the wheat seed to help improve establishment, stimulate rooting and help the \nmycorrhizal-rhizosphere relationship in the autumn.\n\nThis includes a mixture of plant-associated Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Azotobacter bacteria species and \nTrichoderma fungi which, when applied within a healthy soil system, can promote plant growth, health and disease \nresistance.\n\nTo cut costs, Mr Howard home-brews his own bugs in an intermediate bulk container (IBC), rather than buying in \nready-made products. The brewing kit cost just \u00a3300 to set up and after finding a different food source for the bugs, \nhe has halved his production costs.\n\n\u201cWe were using seaweed powder, but we now use molasses. It results in double the bugs in the solution, so we \nhave been able to reduce rates by half,\u201d he explains.\n\nSilica uptake\n\n\n\nAnother component of the liquid applied with the seed is silica, which is heavily linked with reducing abiotic and \nbiotic stresses in plants and increases their ability to resist pathogenic fungi.\n\nTough plants such as mare\u2019s tail (Equisetum arvense) are very high in silica and Mr Howard says increasing levels \nof the element in the crop through the season helps act like armour against pathogens such as septoria and rusts.\n\nHe uses a highly concentrated form of silica known as diatomaceous earth, mixed into the suspension for as little as \n\u00a32.50/ha, and last season tested throughout the growing cycle to monitor levels in his wheats.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to get a benchmark. Generally, 100ppm is OK and we were at 300ppm last year. If you get over \n500ppm, it is considered very good,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cMycorrhizal fungi are linked with silica uptake, so without the right soil biology you won\u2019t be able to improve it and \none of the biggest antagonists is nitrogen fertiliser.\u201d\n\nWeakened defences\n\nAs well as being an antagonist to silica uptake, Mr Howard says excess nitrogen in the crop system is the biggest \ncause of disease.\n\nHe likens it to sugary energy drinks in humans: it gives the plants a sudden \u201crush\u201d, but ultimately they crash, \nweakening disease defences and increasing the need for fungicides.\n\nAmmonium nitrate is one of the worst culprits and a switch to urea sulphate as a slow-release alternative has \nhelped reduce this \u201crush\u201d effect.\n\nNitrogen fixers are also included in the liquid mix at seeding to provide the crop with a slow release nitrogen supply \nthat serves up 30-80kg/ha of N throughout the growing season.\n\n\u201cA key thing with the nitrogen fixers again lies in the soil. You can\u2019t put them on to a poor environment, it needs to \nbe healthy for them to survive and provide the [crop] benefits,\u201d he adds.\n\nAfter using the alternative system and markedly improving his soils over a seven-year period, the foundation was \nlaid to reduce bagged N use by 10% a year over the past three years.\n\nLast season three passes of 38:0:0:19 (NPKS) urea sulphate and late application of ammonium nitrate to hit milling \nspec gave his quality wheats a total of 180 kg/N/ha, and the 10% incremental reduction will continue in future \nseasons, with just 160 kg/ha planned for 2018.\n\nSpring programme\n\nThe autumn biological and nutrient programme is designed to produce a well-established and healthy crop and is \nfollowed up by a series of foliar sprays at the main fungicide timings during the spring.\n\nMr Howard tests his soils, accounts for nutrients available from the preceding cover crop and draws up a nutrient \nplan for the season.\n\nThis is backed up by tissue tests that continue to measure nutrients, plant pH and brix levels (an indicator of \nphotosynthetic capability) as the season progresses.\n\nAny deficiencies are then addressed by adding macro or micronutrients to the base solution of amino nitrogen \u2013 \nwhich itself is 95% efficient \u2013 and applied at the T0, T1, T2 and T3 timings with any fungicide that is required, based \non the season\u2019s risks.\n\n\n\nThis is all complimented by another home-brew microbial mix, based on Bacillus species with a food source, which \ncolonises the leaf surface and stomata (leaf openings) and helps reduce or delay disease infection. The cost is \nabout \u00a31.25/ha per application.\n\nTo implement his system, Mr Howard works closely with his independent agronomist Roger Bryan of Crop \nManagement Partners and receives advice from agronomy, soil health and biological consultancy Edaphos\u2019s \nmanaging director, Mike Harrington, on nutrient planning and biological product use.\n\nCutting costs\n\nWhile this approach won\u2019t \u201ccontrol\u201d disease completely, healthy, happy plants and microbes working in the crop\u2019s \nfavour are allowing Mr Howard to cut his fungicide spend considerably.\n\nLast year he didn\u2019t use a T0 fungicide at all and reduced fungicide spend at T1 by 30%, with just an \nazole/chlorothalonil mix applied with the nutrients and microbes.\n\nThe T2 timing has included costlier SDHI-based chemistry in the past, but Mr Howard has reduced dose by 30% \nand isn\u2019t convinced it will be required at all in the future if the crop is supplied with the right balance of nutrients.\n\nThis is particularly the case with phosphorus, potassium and copper, as deficiencies in these elements have been \nlinked with rust epidemics and plants struggle to scavenge sufficient supplies themselves.\n\n\u201cMy agronomist would like to use an SDHI at T2, but I\u2019d hope in the future, two applications of Bravo (chlorothalonil) \nat both T1 and T2 might be enough,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe only issue is the potential for mycotoxins [following a fusarium outbreak], so a fungicide will be required at T3 \nfor the foreseeable future. The last thing you would want is to end up with a heap of unmarketable product.\u201d\n\nBetter bushels\n\nMr Howard has seen comparable yields to previous years and when comparing wheat treated with his biological \nprogramme with conventionally treated controls, he noticed an improvement in bushel weights from 76-77kg/hl to \n79-80kg/hl last year.\n\nThis season he is conducting some strip trials where no T1 fungicide will be used at all and he would also like to \nwean his crops off remedial use of trace elements as the health of his soils improves.\n\nThere are also trials in the ground looking at wheat variety blends of three Group 1s and three Group 3s to see if \nthe mixture of genetics can provide further assistance in reducing the impact of disease. \n\nHe is not aiming to go organic, but instead wants to fight the tide that has seen UK growers move from using \n180kg/ha of N and two fungicides 20 years ago, to much higher N rates and four or five fungicides today.\n\n\u201cAlso, any new fungicides that come along work well for a few years and then they start to break down,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI see moving to this system as a necessity, not a choice, and the ultimate goal is for the farm system to run itself \nwithout any external inputs.\u201d\n\n \n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var

Howard\n\nProblem being solved: The cost of managing disease in wheat has rocketed in recent years, but this high-input, \nhigh-output approach does not pay on more challenging soils and climates.\n\nApproach: Overhauling how wheat is grown, cutting back on inputs such as fertiliser and fungicides by adopting a \nsystem that focuses on soil health and plant nutrition to reduce the impact of disease.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nCompanion cropping is helping to offset some of the risks associated with growing 120ha of winter oilseed rape on \na Worcestershire farming estate.\n\nAt the same time, it is supporting the 1,500ha farm\u2019s ongoing commitment to soil health and adding some resilience \ninto the system, while helping to support a sustainable rotation and reduce the need for crop inputs.\n\nSee also: How one farmer slashed his fertiliser and fungicide use in wheat\n\nWith the technique now in its third year at Overbury Enterprises, near Tewkesbury, farm manager Jake Freestone \nsays he started to look at its potential when the neonicotinoid seed treatments were banned and he had to look at \ndifferent ways of growing rape.\n\n\u201cIt was partly about dealing with an increased risk from cabbage stem flea beetle, but also about soil health,\u201d he \nexplains.\n\n\u201cAs a predominantly no-till farm, we are looking to bring benefits to soil structure and fertility in all of our actions and \noperations.\u201d\n\nSoil fungi\n\nOne issue he hoped to overcome with companion cropping was the fact oilseed rape doesn\u2019t host any mycorrhizal \nfungi, so existing soil fungi populations are starved for the year the crop is being grown in the rotation.\n\n\u201cHaving promoted these fungi by moving to no-till and encouraging the symbiotic relationship between them and \nplant roots, it makes sense to look after them,\u201d points out Mr Freestone.\n\n\u201cCompanion plants, which grow down the rows with the rape, can fulfil that function.\u201d\n\nSelecting species\n\nIn the first year, having taken advice from Nuffield scholar and Kent farmer Andy Howard, he used a vetch and \nbuckwheat mix as the companion crop, drilling it at the same time as the oilseed rape crop in mid-August.\n\nAt a seed rate of 12kg/ha of vetch and 7kg/ha of buckwheat, it grew very well.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a particularly fast-growing season, so both species flourished but didn\u2019t outcompete the rape,\u201d Mr \nFreestone recalls.\n\nmailto:richard.allison@reedbusiness.com\n\n\nIn the second year, he trimmed the seed rates back a bit to 10kg/ha and 5kg/ha, respectively, with the crop taking \nvery well and giving him some concerns about any possible competitive effects on the rape it was growing with.\n\nYield boost\n\n\u201cIt turns out I needn\u2019t have worried, our rape yields in 2017 were the best we\u2019ve had for some time, at an average of \n4.08t/ha. The year before, they were lower at 3.03t/ha.\u201d\n\nCompanion cropping benefits at Overbury\n\nSeen oilseed rape yield of 4.08t/ha\n\nUse of bagged nitrogen has been reduced by 10%\n\nNo longer need a pre-emergence herbicide, the saving is more than the extra cost of seed\n\nHelped reduce cabbage stem flea beetle feeding damage\n\nHowever, having a shoot on the estate forced some changes for this year\u2019s companion crop species mix, with the \nbuckwheat being dropped in favour of 2kg/ha of crimson clover, to prevent pheasants taking refuge in the vigorous \ncover.\n\n\u201cIt is all drilled in one go with the rape, using different hoppers, and with slug pellets and fertiliser also going on at \nthe same time in one pass,\u201d explains Mr Freestone. \u201cIt\u2019s a quick and simple operation.\u201d\n\nNutrient contribution\n\nVetch, which develops very rapidly, produces active nodules within six weeks, which means the nitrogen is recycled \nand made available for the oilseed rape in the spring, after the companion crop has been destroyed.\n\nAs a result, the use of bagged nitrogen has been reduced by 10%, which gives Mr Freestone an idea of the nutrient \ncontribution made by the vetch.\n\n\u201cWe are also putting an active carbon source, molasses, in with the liquid fertiliser, which helps the soil microbiology \nuse the fertiliser more effectively.\u201d\n\nHe does the same with every pesticide application, as he looks for ways to reduce the farm\u2019s spend on \nagrochemicals.\n\nCrop destruction\n\nAn application of Astrokerb (aminopyralid + propyzamide) in late winter is used to destroy the companion plants, \nalthough the buckwheat component was always killed by frost.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only broad-leaved weed herbicide we use in the rape and we are going in then anyway for grassweed \ncontrol,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cThe weed suppressing effects of a companion crop means it doesn\u2019t need a pre-emergence herbicide, which has \nbeen a saving.\u201d\n\nThe companion crop seed cost is \u00a332/ha, which is just below the cost of a pre-emergence herbicide, he calculates.\n\nHaving more diversity in the field seems to have helped reduce cabbage stem flea beetle feeding damage, which \ncould be due to the pest being confused by the other plants or the rape crop is disguised in some way.\n\nPest damage\n\n\n\n\u201cEither way, they\u2019re not feeding on the rape like they were. We haven\u2019t had to put any insecticide on the crop.\u201d\n\nMr Freestone has used the companion cropping technique with both conventional and hybrid oilseed rape, with \nequal success, and has even done a split field trial to check there were no detrimental effects on yield.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t any downsides that we have encountered,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt is helping with one of our overall aims of reducing our agrochemical use and it is maintaining our soil fungi \npopulations. Last year\u2019s lift in yields is a good indicator.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, he is interested in other oilseed rape growers\u2019 experiences with different companion plants, such as \nspring beans, and is keen to extend the concept to other crops and put another species in with his wheat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what yet,\u201d he admits.\n\nHe has tried having an understorey of white clover in the rotation, with it established and growing in with beans, \nfollowed by wheat and then barley.\n\n\u201cThe clover grew fine, but it didn\u2019t give us any savings in fertiliser and herbicide.\u201d\n\nWhat is companion cropping?\n\nCompanion cropping is the practice of growing two or more plant species in the same field at the same time.\n\nWhile it can include practices such as intercropping, undersowing, relay and pasture cropping, the technique \ndescribed above results in only one of the plant species being harvested.\n\nIn France, a yield benefit of 0.3t/ha was recorded by seed merchant and distributor Jouffray-Drillaud, when a mix of \ntwo vetch species and berseem clover was grown alongside winter oilseed rape.\n\nThe same French work also suggested nitrogen applications can be reduced by 30kg/ha where companion planting \nis being used.\n\nOther benefits recorded by the trial were reduced insecticide use, weed suppression and improved soil structure.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFertility is improving in Ireland\u2019s largely block-calving dairy industry despite tough growing seasons and ambitious \nherd expansion plans since milk quotas ended in 2015.\n\nThe average national calving interval has fallen since the Economic Breeding Index (EBI) was introduced in 2001, \nwith the national average reducing from 403 days in 2011 to 389 in 2016, according to the Irish Cattle Breeding \nFederation (ICBF) \u2013 the organisation in charge of Irish beef and dairy cattle genetic evaluations.\n\nUK farms also cut calving intervals by 14 days between 2009-10 and 2016. National Milk Records show a reduction \nfrom 428 to 414 days between 2009-10 and early 2016 in a much more all-year-round calving-dominated industry.\n\nThree farmers in eastern Ireland are all strong advocates of the EBI system and opened their doors to an Ireland \nGenetics study tour to show why.  \n\nSee also: Dairy conversion trebles output by focusing on milk from grass\n\nUK v Irish index\n\nUK profitable lifetime index (PLI)\n\nUK Spring Calving Index (SCI)\n\n\n\nIreland Economic Breeding Index (EBI)\n\nProduction 32.2%\n\nProduction 29.3%\n\nFertility 35%\n\nFertility 20.3%\n\nFertility 21.3%\n\nProduction 32% (protein 18.6%)\n\nLifespan 14.4%\n\nMaintenance 16.1%\n\nCalving 10%\n\nMaintenance 9.6%\n\nLifespan 13.5%\n\nBeef 8%\n\nSCC 9.1%\n\nSCC 10.4%\n\nMaintenance 7%\n\nUdder 7%\n\nFeet/legs 3.7%\n\nManagement 4%\n\nCalving ease direct 1.6%\n\nUdder 2.6%\n\nHealth 4%\n\nCalving ease maternal 0.3%\n\nCalving ease 2.6%\n\n \n\nFertility allows diversification into heifer sales\n\nDavid Hannon, T\u00edr Na R\u00ed Farm, Derrypatrick, Drumree, County Meath\n\n285 cows plus followers on 107ha at 2.87lu/ha\n\n83ha grazing platform at 3.5lu/ha\n\n5,460kg milk recorded yield at 4.56% fat and 3.61% protein at 118,000 SCC \n\n\n\n446kg MS at 0.8kg:1kg cow bodyweight\n\n370-day calving interval\n\n600-750kg/concentrates a cow\n\nManufacturing contract, Lakeland Dairies\n\nSpring-calver David Hannon has developed a reputation for high EBI heifers, which he has been able to sell for the \npast six years on account of his herd\u2019s great fertility performance.\n\nThis is despite undergoing herd expansion, doubling cow numbers in 10 years and bringing the mean calving date \nforward a week to 17 February.\n\nCalving in a 12-week block and hitting a calving interval of 370 days means he can cull cows through choice, not \nnecessity, and can retain the earliest born heifers, selling surplus females.\n\nMr Hannon undertakes AI work on cows at home, while replacement heifers are contract-reared off-farm for \n1.50/day (which includes feed, health plan and serving). \n\nBeef bulls run with heifers for 12 weeks and for four weeks with the cows, accounting for about 10% of overall \ninseminations.\n\nCalf sales\n\nThe current high EBI status of the herd (119) produced heifer calves last year with an EBI score of over 206, \nagainst a national average of 140-150.\n\nMr Hannon prefers to serve more cows to dairy, selling about 35 heifers a year for \u00a3220-\u00a3264 a head and getting \n\u00a370.33 a head for Friesian bull calves for export, rather than having Angus crosses going for \u00a340-\u00a3131.  \n\nBreeding\n\nThe Hannon family aims to breed robust, fertile cows that yield good milk solids. The grazing platform is long and \nthin, meaning cows walk up to 3.5-4 miles/day.\n\nThis year\u2019s six-week in-calf rate was at 85% in cows with a barren rate of just 5%. Meanwhile, the farm's \ncomponents are allowing the Hannons to make 4-5p/litre over base price (3.6% fat, 3.3% protein).\n\nA simple three-week tail painting programme is used on cows, with all AI being natural on cows.

The maiden spring-calving heifers are the only group naturally bulled \ndue to them being far away in paddocks in spring and early summer.\n\n \n\nLongevity\n\nCurrently 25% of the herd is fourth lactation or higher. Mature cows are bred to be 580-600kg and are finished on \npasture when barren, to make 1,050 deadweight.\n\nCows get a minimum of 3kg concentrate (16% crude protein) at all times. Autumn calvers get about 2t a cow and \nspring calvers get 1.25t a cow, although this was increased last year (1.9t/cow average) on account of higher \nstocking rates and a 10% drop in grass production.\n\nComponent lift worth \u00a315,800 a year\n\nMartin Quigley Farm, Inniskeen, Dundalk, County Louth\n\n90 cows and 20 heifers on 43ha at 2.45lu/ha\n\n30ha grazing platform at 3.5lu/ha\n\n6,500kg at 4.32% fat and 3.59% protein at 123,000 SCC\n\n390-day calving interval\n\n518kg MS at 0.9kg:1kg cow bodyweight\n\n1.4t of concentrates a cow\n\nWinter contract, Glanbia\n\nLifting milk constituents has bolstered the income of autumn calver Martin Quigley, putting 2.6p/kg on his milk \ncheque.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, Mr Quigley\u2019s EBI herd was producing milk at 3.91% fat and 3.33% protein, which increased to 4.32% fat \nand 3.59% protein by 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, he has increased his herd from 70 to 90 cows, started genotyping and has seen his calving interval \ndrop from 410 to 395 days over the same period, with 50% of the herd calved in four weeks.\n\n\u201cHerd expansion means we have added about five days on the calving interval for each carry-over cow,\u201d explains \nMr Quigley, who expects a sub-380-day interval when numbers peak at 100 cows.\n\nCurrently running cows around 570kg mature weight, Mr Quigley is targeting 1kg of milk solids per every kg of cow \nbodyweight, which he believes can be achieved in the future on account of last year\u2019s heifers having an EBI of 186 \nand predicted to yield 620kg of milk solids as mature cows.\n\nAutumn block\n\nNorth-eastern Ireland receives less rain (750mm) and colder winters than the southern dairying regions, meaning \nMr Quigley opts for an 11-week autumn calving block. Much of the farm is 23cm of clay over shale, but still \nmanaged to produce 11.3tDM/ha of grass in 2017.\n\nMr Quigley oversees AI of the cows, while Progressive Genetics manages a synchronisation programme with the \nheifers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more confident of having grass here in February than I am in July,\u201d explains Mr Quigley, who has the option of \ndrying off in July when cows are 270-280 days in milk.\n\n\u201cMy top EBI cow is 213 and you can\u2019t tell her apart from the rest,\u201d he adds. \u201cWithout figures we don\u2019t know where \nwe are.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nCounty council farms provide a great opportunity for people looking to reach the first rung in the farming ladder and \nmany holdings are designed specifically with new entrants in mind.\n\nIn England, 2,502 farms covering 87,000ha are let by councils to 2,053 tenants, according to the 67th annual report \nto parliament on local authority smallholdings, which covers April 2016 to March 2017.\n\nCambridgeshire\u2019s Farms Estate is the largest in England and Wales, and is made up of 232 tenancies across \n13,400ha \u2013 giving an average farm size of 57ha.\n\nSee also: How the Next Generation network is helping young people get into farming\n\nWhat's on offer\n\nSmaller starter units offered by councils are often an appealing alternative to a bigger private tenancy that can \nrequire an investment of hundreds of thousands of pounds.\n\nGeorge Dunn, chief executive of Tenant Farmers Association, says most local authorities will be looking for tenants \nbelow the age of 40, though tender exercises will be open to individuals of any age.\n\nIt is also important for tenants to consider what the plan will be beyond the fixed term being offered by the authority, \nas the time will tick away quickly.\n\nSome councils do offer long-term agreements, but many are still fixated with short-term plans. Others may offer a \nshort tenancy on a starter farm, with the possibility of a future term on a progression holding.\n\n\n\nTenants should bear in mind the wider context surrounding county farms. As assets of the local authority, the \nestates need to be run profitably to contribute to other frontline services, so rents may not necessarily be cheap and \na strong, viable business plan is essential.\n\nApplication advice\n\nDuncan Slade, rural estates surveyor at Norfolk County Farms, is tasked with finding the best potential applicant \nfor any farm on offer.\n\n\u201cWe start with preparing the details of the farm and conducting a farm open day so applicants can meet us and view \nthe farm,\u201d he says. \u201cWe also run applicant training days where we have a team of experts to offer advice on \nbudgeting, business planning, marketing for example.\u201d\n\nEach applicant has to attend a farm viewing day, complete an application form and submit a detailed business plan \nfor the farm they want to apply for.\n\nThe business plan must include a financial summary and forecasts covering the first three years of the proposed \nbusiness, a management and marketing strategy, a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats analysis, and \nbusiness aims and objectives.\n\nSee also: County council farms \u2013 how many are left?\n\nMr Slade recommends people seek professional advice where appropriate or discuss it with their farming friends \nand connections.\n\nAfter the applications have been submitted, now done entirely online, the team uses a scoring matrix to create a \nshortlist of people to interview.\n\nA panel of experts interviews the candidates and then appoints the successful applicant.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for someone who can assure us that they are the best fit for the farm \u2013 someone who we can give \nthe keys to the farm to and know that it is in good hands,\u201d says Mr Slade. \u201cWe want tenants who are enterprising, \nadaptable and hardworking.\u201d\n\nMr Slade\u2019s three top tips:\n\nReally engage with the process\n\nThe business plan is an essential and critical document so don\u2019t just pay lip service to it\n\nConsider what the council\u2019s aims and objectives are for holding the county farms estate.

It will take weeks to prepare a good \ntender and it may need to be altered before submission.\n\n\n\nPrepare a budget, cashflow and balance sheet to demonstrate the viability of the business, show your assets and \ndisplay how you would finance taking over the farm.\n\nPresent the information in a clear and logical way; your figures will have to stand up to scrutiny.\n\nDecide on a level of rent that is sustainable. Do not overestimate the rental value in an attempt to win the farm.\n\nBefore signing a written farm business tenancy agreement, check it contains the terms you expected. It is advisable \nthat you seek advice on this. \n\nIf you don\u2019t succeed on your first attempt, ask for feedback and keep trying. \n\nCase study\n\nBrian and Carla-May Roberts, Coxhill Farm, Burlington Estate, Norfolk\n\nEarlier this year, Norfolk County Council (NCC) began a search for enthusiastic and hard-working tenants to take \non business tenancies at four farms.\n\nThe council received 39 high-standard applications and nine candidates were interviewed by a panel of officers, \nelected members and external experts. Tenants were found for each farm.\n\nCouncillor Keith Kiddie, chairman of NCC\u2019s business and property committee, said: \u201cThis year\u2019s lettings illustrate \nthe success of the county farms estate in providing a crucial ladder into farming.\n\n\u201cTwo existing tenants are being able to progress to larger farms, and new entrants are being given the chance to \nget established and farm on their own account.\u201d\n\nNew entrants Brian and Carla-May Roberts successfully applied for the tenancy of the 88ha Coxhill Farm on the \nBurlingham Estate.\n\nMr Roberts\u2019 great-grandfather and grandfather were both county council farm tenants, which prompted the idea of \napplying for a council farm tenancy.\n\nAdvised to learn a trade, Mr Roberts became a plumbing and heating engineer, but about seven years ago decided \nto follow his dream of getting into farming.\n\nThe couple bought a tractor and started a contracting business, but still wanted to farm full-time.\n\nWhen they discovered that the county council farm was coming up for tender, they immediately decided to apply.\n\nSee also: The benefits of becoming a council farm tenant\n\nAfter completing a two-day course offered by NCC for first-time applicants, Mr and Mrs Roberts attended the \nmandatory viewing day and worked on their application, with the professional assistance of a land agent.\n\n\u201cOur goal was to stand out,\u201d says Mr Roberts. \u201cThe council gave us the criteria of what they wanted, like business \nplans, and we tried to go the extra mile and give lots of detail.\u201d\n\nIt took three weeks after submitting their application to find out they had made the shortlist for interview.\n\nThen Mr and Mrs Roberts gave a presentation on their proposal and answered questions from six panellists.\n\n\u201cI wanted to show this is the biggest move of our life, it\u2019s life-changing,\u201d said Mr Roberts. \u201cI tried to put across that \nwe are passionate and hard-working and aware we\u2019ll come across hard times.\u201d\n\n\n\nLater that day, Mr Roberts received a phone call to say they had been successful and their 10-year tenancy would \nbegin in October.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get on the farming ladder so this is a big opportunity, and it\u2019s a privilege to be given it by the council,\u201d \nsays Mr Roberts.\n\n\u201cThe hardest thing is sitting and waiting, I just want to get on, hit the ground running and put our mark on it.

especially the case in a dry autumn when crops are slower to establish, with weeds robbing rapeseed \nseedlings of space and nutrients.\n\nHere two agronomists in different parts of the UK outline their weed control strategies in this key break crop\n\nView from the South\n\nSteve Cook, Hampshire Arable Systems/AICC, South\n\nFor Steve Cook, there are plenty of cultural and chemical options for managing weeds in oilseed rape and a flexible \nstrategy is key to using them appropriately and cost-effectively.\n\nApplying an integrated approach, growers should firstly be thinking about how they can get plants up and away, \nwith a healthy crop the best weed suppressor of all.\n\nAdjusting rotation to get an early harvested crop in front of the rapeseed \u2013 such as winter barley or hybrid rye for \nanaerobic digestion \u2013 will help, allowing the use of a stale seed-bed to kill a flush of weeds, plus the application of \norganic manures and early drilling.\n\nSee also: How to tackle herbicide resistance in broad-leaved weeds\n\nDirect or low-disturbance drilling will also lower the weed burden before any herbicides are even considered, by \nencouraging less seed to germinate with the crop.\n\nOnce seed is in the ground, Mr Cook believes growers should always be prepared to use a pre-emergence \nherbicide, despite flea beetle, slugs and lack of moisture threatening successful establishment.\n\nDecisions should be taken on a field-by-field basis, assessing weed spectrum and choosing the product \naccordingly.\n\nFor some weeds, Mr Cook says only metazachlor will offer early control, including some activity on blackgrass, \npoppies, fat hen, mayweeds and shepherd\u2019s purse.\n\nActive Ingredients\n\nAstroKerb: propyzamide + aminopyralid\n\nCenturion Max: clethodim\n\nCleravo: imazamox + quinmerac\n\nFalcon: propaquizafop\n\nFox: bifenox\n\nGalera: clopyralid + picloram\n\nKerb: propyzamide\n\nstrong>Laser: cycloxydim\n\nRalos: aminopyralid + metazachlor + picloram\n\nWhere a high cleaver burden is present, clomazone should also be considered as a pre-emergence option.\n\n\u201cCleavers can be a real nightmare and options after that are limited after [clomazone]. Galera can be used in the \nspring, but by that time they are usually too big to be stopped,\u201d adds Mr Cook.\n\n\n\nSingle hit\n\nFor those opting for a single post-emergence hit for broad-leaved weed control ahead of graminicide applications, \nmetazachlor-based products can be applied up the seven or nine true leaf stage, depending on product label.\n\nMr Cook has also had good results with Ralos, which can be applied at pre- and post-emergence from expanded \ncotyledon stage up to 3-leaf stage, or before the end of September.\n\nProgrammes can then be finished off with Centurion Max in high blackgrass situations, followed by Kerb or \nAstroKerb for the final blow to grassweeds, plus some additional broad-leaved weed control.\n\n\u201cIt is a concern how much pressure we are putting on these later products in some situations, so the more that can \nbe done earlier the better.\n\n\u201cAlthough you need a lot of weeds to hit oilseed rape yield, keeping them down will help keep the combine running \nand growers are also used to clean fields now too,\u201d adds Mr Cook.\n\nKey OSR weed control tips \u2013 South\n\nGet crops off to the best start for maximum competition\n\nConsider low-disturbance establishment for less weed germination\n\nUse pre-emergence sprays to take pressure of post-emergence products\n\nDon\u2019t rely on spring tidy-ups as weeds are often too large\n\nView from the North\n\nPeter Lindsay, SAC Consulting, Perthshire/Angus\n\n\u201cStart with a clean slate,\u201d is the overriding message for oilseed rape growers from Perth-based SAC Consulting \nagronomist Peter Lindsay, and how that weed-free clean slate is achieved will depend on the establishment system.\n\nSome growers in the North still choose a deep cultivation or plough ahead of establishing rapeseed, but many have \nswitched to direct or low-disturbance drilling to save time and cost.\n\nIn these situations, it is possible to use a hit of glyphosate ahead of harvest in the previous winter barley crop \nand/or clean up dirty stubbles before drilling oilseed rape.\n\nWeed burden should then be low and this strategy can be enough to see growers through to propyzamide \napplications later in the autumn, providing a very cost-effective start to the weed programme.\n\nVolunteers\n\nThere is one caveat, however, with Mr Lindsay mindful of volunteer cereals, which as combines become wider are \nbecoming more densely concentrated in lines across the field, as the larger volumes of straw and chaff are more \ndifficult to spread.\n\n\u201cGood chaff spreaders on the combine help, but if volunteers are not controlled with a graminicide [for example, \nFalcon or Laser] quickly in a separate pass, the volunteers can out-compete the oilseed rape and result in a gappy \ncrop that allows problem weeds like chickweed to establish and take off.\u201d\n\nWhere growers are cultivating or ploughing and a larger flush of weeds is encouraged, Mr Lindsay advocates using \na pre- or early post-emergence treatment.\n\nThese will be based on metazachlor and quinmerac or clomazone, depending on the farmer\u2019s nerve.\n\n\n\nClomazone can cause bleaching of the crop as it comes through the ground, so despite being an effective option, \nsome will prefer to use metazachlor-based sprays for less visible crop effect.\n\nWith less pressure on crops from flea beetle, growers in Scotland can be more confident the investment in a pre-\nemergence will pay, but keeping other pests at bay such as slugs and pigeons is crucial to ensure growers get a \nreturn.\n\n\u201cAnything that gets the crop off to a good start is key and in terms of weed control, you always end up spending \nmore on a poor crop than a good one because of the shading effect,\u201d adds Mr Lindsay.\n\nKey OSR weed control tips \u2013 North\n\nGlyphosate pre-drilling can replace pre-emergence in low disturbance systems\n\nAlways use a pre- or early post-emergence spray on cultivated soils\n\nCereal volunteer, slug and pigeon control key to avoid gappy crops that encourage weeds\n\nExtra cost of Clearfield pays in Shropshire\n\nDespite being more expensive to grow than his conventional oilseed rape crops, one West Midlands grower \nbelieves the extra investment in Clearfield varieties will pay in the long term with better weed control.\n\nAdrian Joynt, farm manager at the Apley Estate, situated between Telford and Bridgnorth, oversees 972ha of which \n526ha are combinable crops.\n\nWhen the Allscott sugar factory closed in 2005 the farm needed to find a break crop to replace beet in the rotation \nand being the most profitable alternative, oilseed rape was the logical choice.\n\nSince being introduced, however, brassica weeds charlock and hedge mustard have built on parts of the farm, as \nthey are difficult to control in oilseed rape. Only Fox offers a post-emergence chemical option.\n\nUnhappy with relying on inconsistent control from Fox, Mr Joynt decided to try two Clearfield varieties \u2013 Imperial \nand Veritas \u2013 in autumn 2016 across problem fields. Both are tolerant to the ALS (acetolactate synthase)-inhibiting \nactive ingredient imazamox.\n\nSecond year\n\nNow in the second year, he has been very happy with the results, despite the extra combined costs of seed and \nherbicide sprays (see table).\n\n\u201cWe are now using a low dose of metazachlor at pre-emergence as a holding spray and go in with an application of \nCleravo at the 4-leaf stage of the crop in October, waiting for as big a flush as possible,\u201d explains Mr Joynt.\n\nThis is then followed up with a Kerb application for grassweed control, tidying up the brome and wild oats which can \nalso be problematic.\n\nA conventional variety with a full autumn herbicide programme, including Fox, is \u00a322/ha cheaper than using the\n\nClearfield system and a non-Clearfield hybrid variety with a full autumn herbicide programme is only \u00a34/ha cheaper, \nand with \u201cfantastic\u201d control of brassica weeds, Mr Joynt says the extra cost is negligible.\n\n\u201cYou get less yield effect from the weeds and less risk of erucic acid exceedances. That \u00a322 saving [using \nconventional varieties] doesn\u2019t go very far if you start getting rejected loads.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou have to look at it across the rotation and without doubt [Clearfield] is helping to reduce the [brassica weed] \nburden. Yields have also been comparable to conventional varieties.\u201d\n\nMr Joynt adds that concerns over Clearfield volunteer control were soon dispelled, with no problems so far in the \nfollowing cereal crops.\n\n\u201cWe are using DFF (diflufenican) in the autumn in our cereals and we also have the older hormone chemistry like \nMCPA and CMPP to fall back on too.\u201d\n\nThe cost of Clearfield at Apley Estate\n\nVariety\n\nHerbicide programme\n\nCombined cost (\u00a3/ha)\n\nConventional (no brassica weeds)\n\nPre-emergence (metazachlor)\n\nPre-emergence (Clomazone)\n\nGraminicide (fop/dim)\n\nKerb\n\n \n\n88\n\nConventional (brassica weeds)\n\nPre-emergence (metazachlor)\n\nGraminicide (fop/dim)\n\nKerb\n\nFox\n\n \n\n113\n\nClearfield\n\nPre-emergence (metazachlor)\n\nGraminicide (fop/dim)\n\nCleravo\n\nKerb\n\n \n\n135\n\n\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe AHDB Recommended List for winter oilseed rape has been given a makeover, with all the varieties \nrecommended for growing in different regions of the UK now being displayed in one table.\n\nThe new format has replaced the two regional lists that existed before, where varieties were assessed on their \nsuitability for the East/West region and the North region and ranked according to gross output.\n\nInstead, UK-wide varieties are now separated from those recommended for the East/West region only as well as \nthose considered suitable for the North region only.\n\nSee also: 6 varieties added to sugar beet Recommended List\n\nAs a result, it means growers have to scan three distinct categories when considering the options, as each variety \nonly appears once in the table \u2013 even though it may be suited to growing in more than one area of the country.\n\nSimon Kightley, oilseeds specialist at Niab Tag, explains the difference in the way varieties are displayed means \nthere will be a transition period as growers get used to the way the list is structured.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to get such a huge amount of data into one table,\u201d he says. \u201cIt means it is quick and easy to compare \nvarieties \u2013 whether that\u2019s across the UK or in the regions.\u201d\n\nStar performers\n\nHowever, he points out the way that the 2018-19 Recommended List is presented means the star performers are \nalmost hidden away, as they tend to appear in the middle and right-hand sections, rather than on the left as before.\n\nTo highlight this, he points out that Windozz and Elgar in mid-table, along with Elevation, Kielder and Broadway on \nthe right, are the standout varieties.\n\nIn addition, Alizze and Nikita are the best for all regions, but they\u2019re not the varieties with the highest gross output.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all got used to seeing the highest gross output varieties on the left, with the varieties then being listed in \ndescending order,\u201d he says. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the case anymore.\u201d\n\nFinding varieties\n\nHis advice to growers using the new list for the first time is to be systematic and thorough.\n\n\u201cThe information is all there, but you just need to train yourself to use it. You may have to go hunting to find the best \nvarieties.\u201d\n\nMr Kightley adds a visit to the AHDB Cereals & Oilseeds website gives access to all of the data in an Excel file, so it \nis possible to re-sort the information and rank varieties according to the criteria which are most important to your \nfarm situation.\n\n\u201cIt can be tweaked, so there are options for making more use of the data and tailoring it to individual requirements.\u201d\n\nHigh standards\n\nWhat is clear is there are a lot of very good oilseed rape varieties and it is almost impossible to split them, he notes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never known a season where there is such a fantastic choice \u2013 and there could have been even more varieties \nrecommended and included.\u201d\n\nTo this end, the conventional type, Django, would have fitted in well to the East/West region, he believes, adding \nthere are also a couple of hybrid varieties that were very unlucky not to make the cut.\n\n\n\nWorking with the new format, Mr Kightley picks out the varieties he considers to be the best hybrids and the best \nconventionals (see \u2018Top OSR choices for 2018\u2019, below).\n\nBest choices\n\n\u201cWith hybrids, there\u2019s a clear case for Windozz, Alizze, Aquila and Wembley,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve been a solid \npresence and are performing well.\u201d\n\nThe conventionals have been a bit more variable, he notes, but picks out Elgar, Flamingo, Nikita and Campus as \ntop choices for the East/West region.\n\nFor the North, the conventionals choice is even richer, with everything from Elevation down to Anastasia providing \nhigh yield potential and good agronomic and disease-resistance characteristics.\n\n\u201cThis domination of the North region list by conventionals is remarkable,\u201d he adds.\n\nHe would like to see the agronomic data broken down by region, especially for the North region, as he believes \nthere would be more differentiation for standing ability and maturity if a North-only data set was available for \ninspection.\n\n\u201cOf course, there may not be the depth of data to allow this, especially for new varieties.\u201d\n\nSpecial recommendations\n\nClearfield and club root resistant varieties will also be of interest, he predicts, with lots of promising breeding \nmaterial coming through the testing system.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t many of these varieties on the list at the moment, but we are going to see more of them.\u201d\n\nNew for this year is Architect, with a special recommendation for its resistance to turnip yellows virus, which has \njoined the list as a UK variety.\n\nDisplacing its predecessor Amelie, Architect has a gross output of 102%, putting it 5% behind the best varieties in \nthe East/West region. In the North, it has a gross output of 99%, so lags by 8%.\n\n\u201cArchitect represents progress and is certainly going in the right direction,\u201d comments Mr Kightley. \u201cThe resistance \ncontinues to be evaluated, which is good news for growers.\u201d\n\nCandidates\n\nLooking further ahead, Mr Kightley is reluctant to give a verdict on the candidate varieties, as he believes there is \nnot enough data available on many of them to be confident of their performance.\n\nHe does, however, mention Crome, which has club root resistance. \u201cAt this stage, it would seem to be right up there \non gross output. So that one is of interest.\u201d   \n\nTop OSR choices for 2018\n\nSimon Kightley\u2019s top oilseed rape variety picks for drilling summer 2018\n\nBest hybrids\n\nWindozz\n\nAlizze\n\nAquila\n\n\n\nWembley\n\nBest conventionals\n\nElgar\n\nFlamingo\n\nNikita\n\nCampus\n\nBest UK-wide varieties\n\nAlizze\n\nNikita\n\n Newcomers\n\nArchitect \u2013 turnip yellows virus resistance, UK-wide special recommendation\n\nElevation \u2013 conventional variety for the North\n\nKielder \u2013 conventional variety for the North\n\nBroadway \u2013 conventional variety for the North\n\nButterfly \u2013 conventional variety for the North\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nScientists have been using near-infrared spectroscopy for decades, analysing everything from blood and tissue \nsamples to livestock forage and grain.\n\nBut now this technology is starting to migrate from the lab to the field, with units suitable for fitting to forage \nharvesters, slurry tankers and combine harvesters already making their way on to the market.\n\nThese systems work by shining a beam of broad-spectrum near-infrared light at the silage, slurry or grain the \noperator wishes to analyse. Depending on the make-up of the sample, different amounts of this light are absorbed, \nreflected or scattered when they make contact with it.\n\nA sensor within the system records the amounts of light being reflected back off the sample and compares the \nfigures it receives against a database of samples tested in a lab.\n\nMany samples can be taken per second, and providing the reference data is up to date, the results should be very \naccurate (see Limitations of NIRS).\n\nBelow we take a look at a few of the systems that are currently available.\n\nSee also: Driver's view: John Deere 8600 self-propelled forager\n\nForage harvesters\n\nJohn Deere \u2013 Harvest Lab\n\nJohn Deere has been the first of the major agricultural machinery manufacturers to really capitalise on the benefits \nof near-infrared technology.\n\n\n\nIts Harvestlab system has been around for several years now and when fitted to a forager is capable of measuring \nsilage dry matter and automatically making adjustments to chop length to suit.\n\nThe latest versions will also analyse protein levels, starch, neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF) \nand most other silage constituents.\n\nOperators are able to view the readings while harvesting and then make the relevant adjustments to maximize \nfeed quality. The information can also be sent wirelessly to Deere\u2019s operations centre where more detailed analysis \ncan be carried out\n\nThe Harvestlab unit itself is mounted on the forager spout and has a lens that takes up to 4,000 readings per \nsecond from the forage as it whizzes past.\n\nIt\u2019s capable of taking measurements from maize crops as well as grass and can be removed from the harvester and \nused as a stationary tester for assessing forage nutrient quality during feeding. It can also be transferred to muck \nand slurry spreading kit for on-the-go manure testing.\n\nThe latest Harvestlab 3000 unit has a list price of \u00a315,192.\n\nClaas \u2013 NIR\n\nClaas now offers a brace of NIR systems for its range of Jaguar forage harvesters \u2013 one that offers a simple dry \nmatter reading and another capable of doing nutrient analysis.\n\nThis records amylum, crude fibre, crude protein, crude ash and crude fat. Like John Deere\u2019s version, the unit \nmounts through a hole on the forager spout and takes readings directly from the crop as it passes by. \n\nThis is then sent to the Cebis in-cab screen so the driver can monitor any changes in the quality of the grass. It is \nalso possible for the information to be transferred wirelessly back to the farm office.\n\nThe list price of the complete NIR sensor kit is \u00a319,125 while the simpler dry matter sensor is \u00a33,520.\n\nDinamica Generale \u2013 NIR On Board\n\nA third NIR option for forage harvesters comes from Italian maker Dinamica Generale.\n\nThis is the unit New Holland uses on its machines, but it\u2019s also available separately through UK importer \nGreenforage.\n\nLike the Deere and Claas systems, the NIR On Board kit fits to the forager spout and uses a lens to read the forage \nas it passes by.\n\nThe results are displayed on a screen in the cab and can also be wirelessly transmitted to the firm\u2019s own cloud-\nbased software system called Field Trace.\n\nIt can be installed on any make of forager and is capable of reading both dry matter and nutrient content. The kit \ncan also be used for taking readings on slurry tankers and combine harvesters and mixer wagons.\n\nThe system has only recently become available in the UK and so far one unit has been sold, which is being fitted to \na New Holland machine. Prices start at about \u00a315,000.\n\nManure testing\n\nVeenhuis \u2013 Nutriflow\n\n\n\nDutch firm Veenhuis has had a busy few years developing its own NIRS system for accurately measuring the \nnutrient content of slurry and digestate being applied by its machines.\n\nNow that the testing phase is out of the way, the Nutriflow system is on sale with several units working in the \nNetherlands and a few in the UK.\n\nThe unit itself bolts into the tanker\u2019s pipework and constantly beams near infrared light at the liquid as it passes by.\n\nIt\u2019s capable of picking up nitrogen, phosphate, potassium, ammonium and dry matter percentage, and has been \ncalibrated using \u201call manor\u201d of liquid manures to make sure the readings are as accurate as possible.\n\nBy linking this system to the spreading equipment control and GPS via Isobus, the rate can then be varied to make \nsure the field gets an even dose.\n\nAccurate application maps can also be produced to show how much of each nutrient has been applied where.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to combine the Nutriflow unit with a front fertiliser tank, which can be mixed with the slurry or digestate \nif the nutrient content of a certain batch is too low. The system can be combined with automatic section control to \nprevent any overlaps, too.    \n\nThe system is available through UK importer Technical Waste Solutions and has a list price of around 49,000, \nalthough this does vary depending on the machine its fitted to. Unlike some of the systems on the market this \nincludes all of the additional equipment and calibration curves needed.\n\nJoskin and John Deere\n\nA number of slurry equipment makers have adopted Deere\u2019s Harvestlab system for nutrient analysis of manures, \nbut Belgian maker Joskin was one of the first.\n\nIt has been working closely with John Deere over the years to develop an integrated system, which was launched \ncommercially in 2017.\n\nThis uses the Deere sensor to take the nutrient readings, while Joskin\u2019s own flow meter uses the information to \nadjust application rates accordingly.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible to hook the system up to John Deere\u2019s tractor implement system (TIA). This allows the tanker to \ntake control of forward speed, offering another method of automatically controlling application rates.\n\nOperators can pick minimum and maximum values of N, P and K, and the flow meter automatically adjust the \nquantity of nutrients going to the distributor.\n\nNo modifications need to be made to the Harvestlab unit, but about \u00a34,000 worth of additional parts are required to \nhook it up to the tanker.\n\nJoskin doesn\u2019t sell the Harvestlab sensing kit itself, so this needs to be sourced through Deere. However, for those \nwho already have a unit fitted to a forager, it\u2019s a 20-minute job to move it from one machine to the other.\n\nCombine protein analysis\n\nNext Instruments \u2013 Cropscan 3000H\n\nOn the combine front, NIRS gives farmers the opportunity to accurately measure protein, oil and moisture in cereal \ngrains and oil seeds as they are harvested.\n\nThe Cropscan 3000H from Australian firm Next Instruments \u2013 imported by Precision Decisions \u2013 is mounted on the \nclean grain elevator and takes samples as the crop makes its way up to the tank.\n\n\n\nSamples drop into the sampling head for a few seconds while light is passed through them. A fibre optic cable then \ncollects the transmitted light and sends it to the NIR spectrometer unit in the cab. The readings are then displayed \non a touch-screen computer.\n\nData is collected and displayed every seven to 12 seconds and the operator can view tank averages, field averages \nand real-time protein maps. It can also wirelessly transfer the information to a computer.\n\nAccording to Precision Decisions there are currently five machines operating in the UK, fitted to three different \nbrands of combine. Initially, the units were used for research, but some commercial farms are now running them.\n\nSo far the data has mainly been used to identify nitrogen removal and how this affects yield. Most of this has been \nin milling wheat, but some work has been done in barley too.\n\nTo make sure they\u2019re giving accurate results accurate, the units receive new calibrations every year, which are \nspecific to UK varieties. Precision Decisions has done this calibration work in conjunction with ADAS, which \ninvolved putting more than 50 samples of nine different varieties through the system.\n\nPrices can vary depending on the machine they are being fitted to, but generally it costs about \u00a316,500.\n\nTechno Cientifica \u2013 Grain-Q\n\nA similar system to the Cropscan 3000H is available from Techno Cientifica, based in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nThis also mounts to the clean grain elevator and continuously hives off small samples that pass by the NIR sensor.\n\nThe unit is capable of monitoring moisture, protein, starch and sugar and the readings are apparently accurate \nenough to tally with the instruments used by most mills.\n\nAll readings are sent back to a tablet computer in the cab and there is a built-in GPS unit to show you which parts of \nthe field have performed best. It will also keep a record of the average condition of each tank load.\n\nThe system costs about \u00a320,000 and is available through Master Farm Services.\n\nPortable systems\n\nFor those who want to test field samples prior to harvesting and monitor the quality of forage during feeding, there \nare a number of portable NIR systems.\n\nThe Agri-NIR from Dinamica Generale fits into a small wheel-along unit and is calibrated to take readings from most \ntypes of forage crop.\n\nAll the operator has to do is load a sample into the unit, press a couple of buttons and wait 60s for the result to \ncome through. The result can then be printed on a ticket or transferred to a computer via USB.\n\nIt does need to be plugged into a 240v power supply unless a separate DC power pack is purchased.\n\nThe company also offers a smaller hand-held system called X-NIR. This is very simple, requiring the operator to \npoint the machine at the sample to be tested. Results are given in less than a minute and are stored on the unit. \nThe readings can then be transferred using a USB stick.\n\nBoth of these units are available through Greenforage, based in Ingleton, Yorkshire. Prices start at \u00a312,000.\n\nLimitations of NIRS\n\nA recent study conducted by independent researcher Dr Dave Davies of Silage Solutions called the accuracy of \nsome near infrared spectroscopy testing into doubt.\n\n\n\nAfter testing 177 grass silage samples in January 2017 using both wet chemistry and NIRS analysis, he found the \nlatter inaccurate when it came to sugar predictions.\n\nThis could lead to some farmers over-feeding expensive protein sources as a result of labs underestimating true \nforage potential. \n\nDr Davies said the failing did not mean the NIRS technique was inferior, but was reflective of the databases that \nlabs used to predict the results.\n\nThese databases are based on historic chemical analysis and are used to predict the quality of fresh silage samples \nsubmitted using near infrared-spectroscopy, he says\n\nTherefore, unless these databases are kept up to date, it is difficult to predict silage quality accurately.\n\nAlthough his report is primarily aimed at those getting NIR testing carried out by a lab, he advised farmers to \nquestion the quality of the databases used before committing to using them.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nVisitors love having the opportunity to speak with farmers on Open Farm Sunday and listen to their stories about life \non the farm. It gives consumers the chance to get their questions answered and discover the truth about farming.\n\nSo if you've signed up for Open Farm Sunday, but you're having nightmares about being thrown impossible \nquestions from the public about castrating lambs, pouring chemicals on crops and the ethical considerations of \ndairy farming, we've got some tips.\n\nFirstly, don't panic it won't be nearly as taxing as you're imagining it to be. This is a great opportunity for the public \nto discover farming and see first-hand the fantastic work farmers do to produce food and manage the environment. \n\nSee also: Open Farm Sunday: Why you should get involved\n\nFor farmers who don\u2019t regularly speak directly with the public, this can be daunting, but the feedback from Open \nFarm Sunday host farmers is resoundingly positive.\n\nThe key is to follow some tried and tested top tips \u2013 especially when answering tricky questions.\n\nBy answering honestly, knowledgeably, and staying calm, visitors will leave with the understanding and trust in \nfarming which Linking Environment and Farming (Leaf), all the host farmers, supporters and sponsors aim to \npromote.\n\nThese seven tips will help you when the big day comes around on 10 June.\n\n1. Keep it honest. Answer questions honestly because your passion and knowledge for, and understanding of, \nfarming will shine through. Openness and transparency will help to promote trust from visitors. \n\n2. Know your facts. As well as being honest, it\u2019s important to answer any questions knowledgeably. Not only will this \nback up your points and opinions, facts will also help your audience leave feeling reassured and informed.\n\n3. Stay positive and confident. Enthusiasm is infectious. Talking about all the positive things in farming and what it \ndoes for the countryside will mean your audience feels as interested in and excited about farming as you are. \n\n4. Keep it simple. Open Farm Sunday events are for everyone, attracting a range of age groups and visitors with \ndifferent levels of understanding when it comes to farming.\n\nBy keeping your language simple, interesting and succinct, and avoiding jargon, you can be sure your answers will \nbe fully understood.\n\n\n\nYou don't want people to leave the farm feeling confused or uncertain about why something is done or how it \nhappens.\n\n5. Stay calm. Yes, the thought of having crowds of people milling around the farmyard and poking around the \nparlour can be stressful, but try to be polite, respectful and keep your cool in all situations.\n\nThis will help you explain everything clearly, and maintain the respect from your guests, as well as avoiding any \nconfrontation.\n\n6. Agree to disagree. As with any difficult question or conversation, it may not be possible to reach an \nunderstanding or resolution.\n\nBe prepared for this to happen and, if it does, find a way to close the conversation in a polite and non-\nconfrontational way.\n\n7. Practice makes perfect. As with most things, practice is invaluable. Ask your friends, family or colleagues to quiz \nyou on questions that might come up on the day, and practice your answers to them.\n\nThis will help you identify the information you may need for answers, mean you're less likely to be caught off-guard \nby an unexpected query and you'll feel more at ease on the day.\n\nHow to get involved\n\nOpen Farm Sunday will be held on Sunday 10 June 2018. Meanwhile, Open Farm School Days \u2013 a nationwide \nproject to get schoolchildren onto farms and learning about where their food comes from \u2013 will be held throughout \nJune.\n\nAll host farmers receive a range of free resources and support.

This one-pass \nmethod of application reduces the time pressure at a busy time of year, while placing a combination of nutrients \nright next to the seed.\n\nAs explained previously, this is of greater importance for phosphate, which does not move in soil to the same extent \nas nitrogen.\n\nThe choice of specific product to use at this stage is often controlled by the capabilities of the drill. Some combine \ndrills can cope with high rates of granular fertiliser, while subsoiler type drills are often only able to handle lower \nrates of microgranules or liquids.\n\nOSR starter fertilisers\n\nProvide key nutrients close to the seed\n\nImprove establishment\n\nIncrease the efficiency of nutrient uptake\n\nMeet nitrate vulnerable zone autumn N limits\n\nProduct choice\n\nDi-ammoniun phosphate (18:46:0 NPK) is the most commonly used product for this purpose.\n\nThis is an ammonium phosphate, so it provides a balanced nutrient boost and gives increased P absorption from \nbeing applied with nitrogen.\n\nThere is a proven synergistic effect on plant uptake of phosphate where nitrogen is present in the ammonium form.\n\nStarter fertilisers used at this timing include microgranules and liquids. These are applied at low rates and are \ntargeted at the early growth stages \u2013 they will not provide the crop with all of its nutritional requirements for the \nwhole growing season.\n\nThe main advantage of microgranular products is the increased availability of nutrients through their greater surface \narea. This means they can supply phosphate much quicker than a standard granular fertiliser.\n\nLiquid fertilisers are 100% soluble and rapidly available. In these, phosphate is supplied in the ammonium \nphosphate form, bringing the same combined benefits that di-ammoniun phosphate offers.\n\nAutumn nitrogen applications have to be limited to 30kg/ha where the farm is in an nitrate vulnerable zone.\n\nWhat about lime?\n\nLiming should be considered as part of a long-term strategy for reducing clubroot build-up in affected fields.\n\nAHDB-funded work has shown that clubroot severity is linked to soil pH and crops in acidic soils are more at risk of \nsevere symptoms.\n\nAlthough the clubroot pathogen is highly resilient and will survive and infect even at high soil pH levels, soil \namendments that raise the pH and calcium content of soils can be effective.\n\nA neutral or alkaline pH (+7) is best \u2013 but this may not be beneficial for the wider rotation due to nutrient lock-up.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\n\n\nAn Essex sugar beet grower hopes to recapture his high yielding ways and produce one of the UK\u2019s top-yielding \nfields, by focusing on disease and weed control in the coming months.\n\nIn the late 1990s, David Halsall led the way on sugar beet yields being in the top 5% of farmers.\n\nHe recalls one season when he was third on British Sugar\u2019s league table of best-performing crops, when it used to \npublish yields.\n\nYields progressed less rapidly at Docuras Farm and fell back a little. That was until last season, when David and his \nson George broke through the 100t barrier setting a new record on their farm of 109t/ha.\n\nSee also: What the 5 new sugar beet varieties offer\n\nThis season, the father and son team hope to push even further and get back into the top 5% of growers, although \nthey recognise the late spring means some potential yield has already been lost.\n\nThey were fortunate to start drilling on 23 March although the wet cold spell meant the rest of the area had to wait \nuntil a month later.\n\nAnother consequence of the difficult spring was crops did not receive a pre-emergence herbicide. Despite this, \nweeds have been successfully dealt by two post-emergence applications in May (see \u2018Four diseases of sugar beet \nto look out for and their symptoms\u2019, below).\n\nDisease management\n\nOnce into late June, the focus switches to disease and there are four key foliar diseases that can affect sugar beet, \nrust, powdery mildew, ramularia and cercospora.\n\n\u201cRust is the main disease to look out for, as mildew is being seen much less frequently these days,\u201d says \nindependent expert Mike May. Powdery mildew used to be the main disease, before being displaced by rust a few \nyears ago.\n\nAzole fungicides give good control of all four, however timing is critical. \u201cDon\u2019t let disease get established, monitor \ncrops from June and spray at first signs, usually in July.\u201d\n\nWhile rust is something the Halsall\u2019s are familiar with, one disease they have yet to see is cercospora.\n\nThis is a relatively new disease that is spreading in the UK. It\u2019s currently further north, but could spread rapidly, as \nMr May points to the Dutch situation where it spread through the country within five years.\n\nBayer root crop campaign manager Edward Hagues says some growers were caught out last year, as rust came \nearly. \u201cFarmers treated crops and then left a large gap between sprays; which then let in rust.\u201d\n\nMind the gap\n\nTherefore, the message is to avoid stretching the gap too much to the second fungicide. \u201cTry to keep the timing to \nfour weeks.\u201d\n\nThe Halsalls follow the British Beet Research Organisation approach with the early lifted (October) crop getting one \nfungicide while the later lifted area gets two applications.\n\nMr May says good coverage is important and so is spray volume, as some farmer who cut back on volume saw \nsome problems last year.\n\nDavid and George follow best practice typically applying 200-250 litres/ha. And being potato growers, they use Defy \nnozzles to get good coverage with alternating forwards and backwards facing jets.\n\n\n\nFour diseases of sugar beet to look out for and their symptoms\n\nRust\n\nRust appears on both sides of the leaf as small 1-2mm diameter raised pustules that are red-orange or brown in \ncolour.\n\nDisease spreads during periods of moist weather when temperatures are between 15C and 20C and most intense \nwhen dew persists for long periods\n\nCan be seen early June onwards\n\nHeavy infections in late August can reduce yields by 10% or more\n\nCercospora\n\nAppear as small round grey spots with reddish margins\n\nUnder humid conditions, black dots appear through the stomata which help distinguish it from ramularia\n\nCan cause severe damage\n\nRamularia\n\nAppears first as brownish grey spots with dark edges\n\nPrefers cooler conditions (about 17C) than powdery mildew and infection only occurs when humidity exceeds 95%, \nso mainly seen, usually at low levels, September onwards\n\nSeldom causes significant yield losses in the UK\n\nPowdery mildew\n\nCharacterised by white powdery covering of leaves\n\nOlder leaves tend to be infected first and symptoms more prevelant on upper leaf surface\n\nGrowth of fungus favoured by high temperatures (about 20C) with dew at night\n\nFarm facts and beet weed and disease

rough and loveless life, but patching them up with second-hand spares \ncan push them a few years beyond their sell-by date without costing the earth.\n\nThere are several specialist 4x4 breakers dotted around the country (though predominantly in northern England), \nincluding MJM in Hull, A1 in Heywood, Lancashire, and CWS in Glastonbury, Somerset.\n\nWhile these can all offer a pretty good range of parts for everything from Suzuki Jimnys to BMW X5s, Thornton 4x4 \nBreakers based in Halifax, West Yorkshire, specialises in pulling apart single- and double-cab pickups built from \n2000 onwards.\n\nIt has close to 1,000 pickups and Land Rover Defenders in various states of undress, all stacked three-high across \nhuge lengths of cantilever racking, along with thousands of other spares stored on shelves.\n\nHaving celebrated 30 years in the breaking trade last year, owner Peter Jones knows a thing or two about \nsqueezing every last penny from a crumpled motor.\n\nSee also: Pickup test: 6 farm trucks compared\n\nSourcing the trucks\n\nEverything that is dragged into Thornton\u2019s yard has been written off by insurance companies as a category B-\ngraded vehicle, so can be stripped of its working parts but not restored and returned to the road (see \"Insurance \nwrite-offs \u2013 what you need to know\").\n\nOnce written off, the vehicles are sent to auctions, where buyers from all over the world scrap it out for the best \nbargains.\n\nUK firms have the advantage of lower transport costs that eat into potential profit, but many of the foreign bidders \nare based in countries where cat B write-offs aren\u2019t recognised, so they can get the trucks patched up on the cheap \n(rather than breaking them) and sell them in \"roadworthy\" condition for a healthy margin.\n\nUp to 20 motors arrive at Thornton\u2019s 2.5ha site each week, 90% of which have a decent engine and gearbox that is \nremoved and put into storage.\n\nNon-runners are stripped for the good bits \u2013 the core block, injectors, turbos and fuel pumps \u2013 that can be used on \nreconditioned engines or sold as spares.\n\nWith the engine and gearbox checked, cabs are removed, chassis stripped and wheel/tyres salvaged, though it \nusually takes a couple of vehicles to assemble a sellable set.\n\nIn all, very little goes to waste, aside from beaten-up body panels and smashed windows.\n\nThe company uses a clever computer management system to keep tabs on the millions of individual parts stored on \nsite.\n\nOnce the chassis number is typed in, it populates a full list of parts fitted to each vehicle, as well as automatically \nloading them straight onto eBay.\n\nIt means the team knows exactly what is on the shelves at any one time and helps track whether there is an excess \nof any particular items that might influence pricing in the future.\n\n\n\nAs well as selling parts to the UK, the company regularly packs up 40ft containers destined for the tropical shores of \nTrinidad and Tobago, Greece and Dubai.\n\nThis tends to be the pre-2005 stuff, with newer parts reserved for the UK market.\n\nDiscount engines\n\nThere are plenty of incentives to buy second-hand parts, with price and lead time the two most convincing factors.\n\nTake a popular farm truck such as Isuzu\u2019s D-Max, for instance. The 2.5-litre engine it ran until last year can cost \nmore than \u00a36,000 to replace new and has a lead time of about three months, which isn\u2019t particularly handy for a \nvehicle relied upon daily.\n\nAdded to that, the price is for a short motor (head and block), so you will still have the arduous task of stripping the \nold engine and fitting all the ancillary parts.\n\nHowever, a second-hander could be sourced for \u00a32,500 and fitted a few days later. Throw another \u00a3400 at it and \nThornton\u2019s will collect your vehicle and fit the engine, too.\n\nThough the D-Max block is a good example, it also happens to be at the higher end of the price list because it\u2019s so \npopular.\n\nLess-common engines tend to be cheaper: expect to pay closer to \u00a32,000 for the Toyota Hilux\u2019s three-litre, or \n\u00a31,500 for a Nissan Navara D40\u2019s 2.5-litre.\n\nComparatively, Land Rover Defender spares are now astronomically expensive. Car values are soaring, which \nmeans they are very rarely written off and the supply of parts has all but vanished.\n\nBody panels are like hens\u2019 teeth, so while a Mitsubishi L200 door might be \u00a350, a Defender\u2019s is more like \u00a3450.\n\nCar insurance write-off categories \u2013 what you need to know\n\nThe Association of British Insurers (ABI) updated its industry code of practice \u2013 known as the salvage code \u2013 on 1 \nOctober 2017 to take into account the increasing complexity of new vehicles, which makes it harder for damaged \ncars to be safely repaired.\n\nIn general, a write-off includes any vehicle deemed to have sustained enough damage to be unsafe on the road, or \none that is still safe to drive, but uneconomical to repair.\n\nThe latter is based on a repair-to-value ratio that varies between insurers and is calculated by taking into account \nthe vehicle\u2019s condition and the collision damage it has sustained.\n\nThere are still four write-off categories that are graded in severity from pure scrap to repairable cosmetic damage.\n\nPreviously, this ranged from A to D. The last two of those (C and D) were governed by the insurance company\u2019s \nestimated cost of repair, which has risen significantly because cars are so complicated.\n\nThis means they are more frequently being deemed write-offs, despite being perfectly safe and usable.\n\nHowever, while A and B grades remain proper write-offs that are not suitable for repair, C and D have been \nreplaced by two new categories \u2013 S and N.\n\nThese are designed to shift the focus from the cost of repair to the actual problem, highlighting any structural \ndamage that must be properly dealt with if the vehicle is to remain on the road.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick guide to the different classifications:\n\n\n\nA \u2013 Scrap only. These have to be crushed and salvageable parts must be destroyed. Fire damage is a good \nexample.\n\nB \u2013 Break. Seriously damaged, but parts are salvageable. These should never re-appear on the road, but reclaimed \nparts can be used in other road-going vehicles.\n\nS \u2013 Structurally damaged but repairable. These have suffered damage such as a bent or twisted chassis, so the \ndamage is more than cosmetic and needs to be professionally repaired \u2013 it won\u2019t be safe to drive until then.\n\nN \u2013 Non-structurally damaged and repairable. These are likely to have cosmetic or electrical damage that makes \nthe vehicle uneconomical to repair, but both S- and N-grade vehicles can be sold on back to the original owner or a \nthird party.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nTesting for wormer resistance is vital to enable farmers to put effective worm control plans in place.\n\nWormer resistance costs the UK sheep industry \u00a384m each year. Almost all farms (94%) are thought to have \nresistance to white wormers, 68% to yellow wormers and more than 50% to ivermectin-type drenches. \n\nMost recently, resistance to the newer monepantel (orange drench)  has been reported. \n\nVet Dave Armstrong from Zoetis talks through how and why you need to test for resistance in your flock.\n\nWhat is resistance and why is it a problem?\n\nA farm has resistance problems when a product is not killing at least 95% of worms. Above this level production \nlosses will be minimal.\n\nHowever, below this effectiveness, there will be production losses. It is only when resistance is at about 50% that \nclinical disease will be notable.\n\nReduced drench performance due to resistance leads to more worms surviving and, ultimately, reduced lamb \nperformance, which is why it is so costly.\n\nFor example, it could take only five weeks for a weaned lamb to put on 10kg from eating 65kg of feed if worm \ncontrol is effective. However, if worm control is ineffective, it could take 14 weeks to gain the same weight, with \ndouble the amount of feed consumed.\n\nZoetis has developed a Drench Check app that can be downloaded for free from the Apple App Store or Google \nPlay Store. This app uses the latest UK resistance data or bespoke farm data to clearly highlight the return on \ninvestment of using the right wormer, to help farmers create specific drench plans.\n\nTo get the most out of the app and put together effective worm control plans with their vet, farmers need to know \nthe resistance status on their farm. The easiest and crudest way to do this is to perform a post-drench faecal egg \ncount test, to check worms have been killed post treatment.\n\nHow to carry out a post-drench FEC\n\nSummary of the wormer groups\n\nGroup 1: White - BZ benzimidazole\n\nGroup 2: Yellow - LV levamisole\n\nGroup 3: Clear - ML avermectin/moxidectin\n\n\n\nGroup 4: Orange - AD monepantel\n\nGroup 5: Purple - SI derquantel\n\nStep 1: Collect samples\n\nThe first thing to do is to take faecal worm egg counts from a pooled sample of 10 lambs that have been wormed.\n\nThese samples must be taken 14 days after treatment for all wormers, except the yellow group, from which samples \nmust be taken seven days after treatment.\n\nYou can do this by collecting random fresh faecal samples (less than one hour old) from the group and storing them \nin an airtight container or plastic bag in a cool place. The samples should be examined within 48 hours.  \n\nStep 2: Analyse results\n\nIf there is a positive egg count after treatment, this would indicate either a potential resistance problem or the lambs \nmay have been underdosed. It is important to remember a negative sample does not mean there is no resistance; \nthere may have been no worms present before treatment.  \n\nStep 3: Further investigation\n\nIf you suspect some level of resistance, further investigation may be required.\n\nThis can involve conducting a faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT), where the wormers in question are tested \nagainst a control. Samples are taken before and after treatment to determine a percentage reduction. More sheep \nneed to be involved in this and it is best to speak to your vet or adviser about conducting these tests.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that before reaching for any product, you must know what is happening on your farm and \nwork with your vet, SQP or adviser to devise specific worm control plans. <  \n\nMore information\n\nGet more information and resources on worm control, including a guide on using the Drench Check app online.

Drilling dates are also being pushed back.\n\n\u201cWe have clearly moved towards better, more septoria-resistant varieties such as Skyfall, Siskin and Graham, while \nwe are also looking at Sundance,\u201d Mr Hudson says.\n\nBrian Redrup, the company\u2019s farms director for the Midlands region, says drilling date is dictated largely by \nblackgrass, and where this grassweed is a problem, delayed drilling is a must. An added bonus is that it also helps \nlimit disease development.\n\n\u201cWe drill relatively little of our 16,000ha of wheat in September, with most sown in early and mid-October,\u201d he says.\n\nWith an eye on resistance to the SDHI fungicides, the group\u2019s budget includes just one SDHI, but this season the \nsingle-SDHI strategy may not be the best approach and two are most likely to be used. \n\nTypical fungicide actives\n\nAdexar SDHI fluxapyroxad + azole epoxiconazole\n\nAscra SDHIs bixafen + fluopyram + azole prothioconazole\n\nAviator SDHI bixafen + azole prothioconazole\n\nElatus SDHI benzovindiflupyr + azole prothioconazole\n\nLibrax SDHI fluxapyroxad + azole metconazole \n\nKeystone SDHI isopyrazam + azole epoxiconazole\n\nVertisan SDHI penthiopyrad\n\nLate, wet spring \n\nThis season, the late, wet spring prevented many T0 azole-multisite fungicide sprays being applied, saving about \n\u00a310/ha, and this has seen the cost of T1 sprays pushed up to compensate, and many have included an SDHI.\n\n\u201cWhere T0s have not gone on, a more robust T1 has been applied as we look to use the strongest products when \nthe disease pressure is the highest,\u201d says Mr Hudson.\n\nAlthough an SDHI is not budgeted at T1, this year \u2013 given the rainfall, the likely latent septoria in crops and the \nabsence of a T0 \u2013 the T1 will generally be more robust and an SDHI-azole-multisite mix.\n\nMr Hudson emphasises that the group generally plans for one SDHI to try to manage SDHI resistance as well as \nspend per hectare, but this season may result in two SDHIs being used in mixes with azoles and multisites to keep \non top of septoria in the wet weather.\n\nMissed sprays\n\n\n\nWhere T0s sprays were missed this season, T1 applications were slightly early at 50% of leaf three emergence.\n\nTherefore, a multisite T1.5, aimed at leaf two emergence, may be used to ensure the T1 to T2 interval is not \nstretched beyond three-and-a-half weeks.\n\nBut with the season developing so quickly and flag leaf sprays likely to be applied in the third week of May in most \nof southern and central England, the gap between T1s and T2s may be about three weeks and a T1.5 may not be \nneeded.\n\nTraditionally, the biggest fungicide cash spend comes with the T2, as this has given the best return on investment \nof all the sprays, and so an SDHI-azole-multisite approach is likely.\n\nAgain an SDHI-led approach may be followed for septoria, and where varieties have key weakness, such as \nCrusoe with brown rust and Reflection with yellow rust, T2 fungicides with added activity against rust will be used.\n\nThis approach gives very good control and persistence against rust diseases, and is used to protect against rapidly \ncycling brown rust hitting susceptible Crusoe milling wheat crops.\n\nMay weather\n\nHowever, if the weather in May turns dry, and for varieties with good septoria resistance such as Siskin, Graham \nand Sundance, an azole-multisite approach may be followed, especially if crops have been drilled late after root \ncrops and are thin, with a low yield potential.\n\n\u201cIf conditions become very dry, with late-drilled resistant varieties where the disease pressure is lower, we may not \nautomatically use an SDHI at T2,\u201d says Mr Hudson.\n\n\u201cThis year, many late-drilled crops did not tiller well and look too thin and we will have to assess the septoria risk to \nthose crops,\u201d he adds.\n\nDifferences in nitrogen fertiliser timings are quite apparent in crops and where nitrogen was applied in mid- to late \nFebruary, tiller survival has been greater and the crops look healthier.\n\nCrops where ground conditions did not allow the first nitrogen to be applied until late March or early April have \nsuffered, with thinner plant stands in some cases, resulting in increased susceptibility to disease. \n\nSDHI resistance\n\nThe group is well aware of the risk of SDHI resistance to septoria. Indeed, it found in its own monitoring that 26% of \nseptoria isolates gathered carried an SDHI mutation, compared with 17% in 2017 and zero in 2016.\n\nTherefore, Mr Redrup emphasises the group\u2019s aim is to optimise production over a number of soil types, but still \ntake into account factors such as septoria resistance and the yield potential of crops.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t insurance spray against every eventuality, but fungicide spend of \u00a380-\u00a3100/ha is where we would like to \nbe,\u201d he adds.\n\nVelcourt\n\nThe group farms 52,000ha of land under a variety of management arrangements stretching from the Moray Firth in \nthe north of Scotland to Devon in south west England with a focus on arable and dairy farming.\n\nVelcourt\u2019s agronomy service also advises on 29,000ha of additional arable land through its agronomists and some \nof its farm managers.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\n\n\nGrowing willow is a diversification option that can earn farmers up to \u00a3618/ha (\u00a3250/acre) a year and help protect \nland against flooding and soil erosion.\n\nAt Langwathby Hall Farm, near Penrith, Cumbria, farmer Simon Peet has been growing willow for a year and has \nplanted over 16ha (40 acres) on his 100ha (250-acre) farm.\n\nHis land runs along 1.25 miles of the River Eden, which floods every year, meaning he is unable to grow crops or \ngraze it during the winter.\n\nSee also: Video: How Gloucs farmers are working to prevent future flooding\n\nDuring Storm Desmond in 2015, 6,000t of gravel was deposited on Mr Peet\u2019s fields, with the damage to land and \nfences stretching to almost \u00a340,000.\n\nAs a result, he looked into planting willow, which has been found to lessen the effects of flooding and reduce soil \nerosion.\n\nMr Peet says: \u201cWe are always looking at ways we can diversify our business and willow offered us an opportunity to \nearn some decent money on land that we can\u2019t crop in the winter or graze with livestock. It has also been found to \nhelp stabilise the soil and slow the flood water, which reduces the damage.\u201d\n\nWorking with paperboard manufacturer Iggesund Paperboard, Mr Peet last year planted 6ha (15 acres) followed by \nan additional 10ha (25 acres) this year, with a further 12ha (30 acres) to be planted next year.\n\nIggesund provides farmers with long-term contracts for growing willow to fuel its biomass boiler at Workington in \nCumbria.\n\nEstablishing willow\n\nPlanting willow is no different to planting any other crop. To establish willow, fields should be sprayed off with 5l/ha \nof round-up, ploughed and then power harrowed in the autumn, and a cover crop added before planting the willow \nin the following spring/early summer. The ideal soil pH should be between 6.5 and 7.\n\nThe cuttings are 20cm when they are planted. They are established in a twin-row format, meaning the machines \nused to harvest can go over the same tram lines, thus reducing soil compaction.\n\nThe aim is to produce 15,000 cuttings/ha. After the crops have been planted there is very little more that needs \ndoing.\n\n\u201cEssentially you can just shut the gate and leave the willow crops for three years,\u201d Mr Peet told farmers at a meeting \norganised by the Cumbria Farmers Network earlier this month (12 June).\n\nIt cost him \u00a31,200 an acre to establish, with returns expected to be about \u00a3618/ha (\u00a3250/acre) a year depending on \nacreage grown, yields and distance to the mill.\n\nOnce willow is established, it is harvested every three years, with the life expectancy of a willow plant expected to \nbe 25+ years. If the land floods, harvest can be rolled over to the following year at no loss to the grower.\n\nVarieties\n\nA mixture of 6-8 varieties of willow are used, but it\u2019s mainly willow shrub hybrids that are planted.\n\nIggesund\u2019s alternative fuels manager Neil Watkins explains: \u201cWe only use varieties that have no known disease and \nhave been thoroughly trialled and tested with performance test data to back them up.\n\n\n\n\u201cTheir tapping roots spread sideways rather than down, which provides a good matting, keeping the soil together \nand not causing any destruction to drains.\u201d\n\nMr Watkins describes willow as the UK\u2019s equivalent of bamboo. \u201cIt\u2019s fast growing and high yielding with expected \nyields of 9-14 oven-dried tonnes (ODT) a year.\n\nIt can grow on even some of the poorest land or good land and is a very low input crop,\u201d he says.\n\nMr Peet says even though the oldest willow crop on his farm is only one year old he has already seen the benefit of \nreducing the flood damage.\n\n\u201cNormally when the River Eden floods we lose some fences. This year when it flooded, one of the fences that \nalways goes didn\u2019t, so it must be doing something,\u201d he says.\n\nContracts\n\nMr Peet is contracted to sell the willow to Iggesund, which supports him throughout the process. The farmers buy \nthe cuttings with help from Iggesund, which covers the cost and organises the harvest and haulage.\n\n\u201cWe have special machines that can harvest willow. Rather than using a middleman to harvest and transport the \ncrop, we deal with the farmers directly, so everything is transparent,\u201d says Mr Watkins.\n\nThe crop is chipped straight away when it is harvested and transported to the biomass plant rather than being cut \nwhole and then stored on the farm. Growers are paid per green tonnage.\n\nWillow and sheep\n\nTrials at Iggesund\u2019s own willow plantation in Workington, where sheep graze in between the willow, has seen some \nsuccess, explains Mr Watkins.\n\n\u201cOver the year before harvest we\u2019ve had 20 ewes with twins grazing among the crop. The sheep grazed it cleanly \nwithout damaging the willow. It also offered protection to them when it was cold and windy and was a good shelter \nfor the lambs,\u201d he says.\n\nThe benefits of willow\n\nNot only can willow provide farmers with an income on land that may not have returned a penny, there are plenty of \nother benefits:\n\nHorizontal growing roots help reduce soil erosion and improve soil infiltration\n\nCan generate income from poor quality land, so is a good diversification option\n\nGrows in most UK soil types and climates\n\nImproves local air quality\n\nProvides natural flood management as it slows the water (hydronic roughness)\n\nCan be used as biosecurity barriers\n\nProvides shelterbelts and windbreaks in winter for large arable growers or livestock\n\nEarly pollination sites for bees (good mix with arable crops)\n\nMinimal input needed to maintain crop\n\n\n\nPotential to graze lowland sheep and Mules in year three of harvest crop. Worm risk will be low as land will be \nclean as not grazed for two previous years.\n\nEligible for Single Farm Payment as it\u2019s considered a greening crop\n\nDid you know?\n\nOne hectare of willow wood chip has the same energy content as 4,500l of home heating oil. It will also yield at \nleast 14 to 30 times more energy than is needed for its production.\n\nHow does willow help reduce flooding?\n\nThe Environment Agency has described the function of willow plantations in their use for flood management like a \n\u2018green leaky dam\u2019, used to slow the speed of water across the floodplain.\n\nWillow has the highest ability to increase hydronic roughness, which means a willow plantation slows water down \nfrom entering watercourses for longer and catches sediment.\n\nFloodplains comprised of entirely short grazed grassland do not provide much roughness and it\u2019s the roughness \u2013 \nwhether it\u2019s willow, large boulders, trees, walls or hedges \u2013 that slows the speed of water as it flows over the \nfloodplain.\n\nThis means it can also reduce the amount of debris the flood water carries.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA huge sinkhole the length of two football pitches and the depth of a six-storey building has appeared on a New \nZealand farm.\n\nA farmer discovered the 200m-long and 20m-deep chasm when he was rounding up cows for milking.\n\nIt appeared on land near the North Island town of Rotorua, triggered by several days of heavy rain, and experts \nbelieve it could be the biggest ever seen in the country.\n\nSee also: 7 of the biggest farms in the world\n\nColin Tremain, the farm manager, said the area often develops sinkholes, due to degrading limestone rock beneath \nthe ground\u2019s surface, but never of this size.\n\nMr Tremain said: \u201cWe\u2019ll keep it fenced off as it is to keep stock out, although stock aren\u2019t stupid \u2013 they\u2019re not going \nto walk into a hole.

should review their succession plans, say advisers, as the government in turn reviews \nhow inheritance tax (IHT) works.\n\nThe Office of Tax Simplification (OTS) has issued a call for evidence and launched a survey on IHT, having been \nasked by Chancellor Philip Hammond to examine the regime and how it may be simplified.\n\nSee also: Video: Estate comes to market as family leaves farming after 70 years\n\nWhile accountants are extremely cautious about the likely outcome of the review, they say this is a good prompt for \nfarming families to review their IHT position, succession and retirement plans.\n\nAgriculture benefits from up to 100% relief from IHT on qualifying assets through agricultural property relief (APR), \nwith the result that proper organisation and planning can mean no IHT is due on many farms and estates.\n\nScope of the Office of Tax simplification review\n\nThe process of submitting IHT returns and paying any tax\n\nGifts rules including the annual

perception of the complexity of the IHT rules among taxpayers, advisers and industry bodies\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very benign regime for agriculture and if people are minded to leave assets to the next generation, then it \nmay be best to do so before people start changing the rules,\u201d said Rob Hitch of Cumbria accountant Dodd & Co.\n\n\n\nIn almost every Budget of the past 20 years there has been a degree of nervousness about possible changes to \nIHT reliefs.\n\nWhile much of the Chancellor\u2019s target was the administration of the tax, there was perhaps a warning shot for \nlandowners, said Mr Hitch, referring to the OTS also looking at how gift rules interact with the wider IHT system.\n\nInheritance tax facts\n\nIntroduced in 1988, replacing capital transfer tax\n\nCharged at 40% but only on any value above the personal \u2018nil rate band\u2019 of \u00a3325,000 for an estate\n\nRaises about \u00a35bn/year\n\nAnnual gift exemption of \u00a33,000 (same for past 30 years)\n\nAgricultural property relief and business property relief offer up to 100% relief from IHT\n\nIt will also consider whether the current framework causes any distortions to taxpayers\u2019 decisions surrounding \ntransfers, investments and other relevant transactions.\n\nEven if a farmer or landowner does not expect to make changes in terms of passing on assets, it is good practice to \nregularly review and understand what the tax position would be in the event of a transfer or a death.\n\nThe more diversified a business is, the more important it is to perform such a review, as diversification can take \nassets outside of the scope of APR, although business property relief (BPR) may still be available, also at up to \n100%.\n\nCarlton Collister of tax adviser landtax said farmers and landowners needed to be aware changes were likely as a \nresult of the review. \u201cIt is speculation at this stage what form those changes might take and the timescale,\u201d said Mr \nCollister. \u201cHowever, If one considers any changes to the current favourable tax treatment for APR and BPR are \nlikely to detrimental, the timetable for the consultation reporting back in the autumn provides a reason to carry out \nsuccession planning that is currently being worked on before the date of the autumn budget.\u201d\n\nThe budget is expected in late November or early December and while the OTS will make recommendations, the \nChancellor is responsible for final decisions on tax policy.\n\nThe OTS wants to hear from anyone with experience of the system including farmers and their advisers.\n\nAdvice on inheritance tax reliefs for farmers and landowners\n\nEligibility for agricultural property relief (APR) depends on assets qualifying \u2013 in general this means that they must \nhave been owned and occupied and used in agriculture by that owner for at least two years. Alternatively they must \nhave been owned for seven years and may have been used by another person for agriculture during that time.\n\nWhere APR is not achievable, then business property relief (BPR) may be available but accountant Saffery \nChampness warns that entitlement to BPR can be jeopardised when land or property is let.\n\nTwo cases from 1999 and 2010 determined that where more than 50% of a property consists wholly or mainly of \nmaking or holding investments, that property would fall outside the scope of BPR.\n\nFurnished holiday lets are often denied IHT relief as they are deemed primarily to be investment businesses unless \na certain level of service is included in the lettings.\n\n\n\nThere has also been a number of cases relating to caravan parks, grazing land and commercial property and in \nmost of these the taxpayer\u2019s BPR claim has failed unless there is evidence of a significant related trading element, \nwarns the firm.\n\nSaffery Champness also cautions not to make significant changes without checking out whether these may affect \nthe position with regard to other taxes.\n\nHow to respond\n\nEmail ots@ots.gsi.gov.uk or write to: Office of Tax Simplification, Inheritance tax review, Room G/41, 1 Horse \nGuards Rd, London SW1A 2HQ\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA tracked version of JCB\u2019s novel Teleskid skid-steer with telescopic boom is now available in the UK.\n\nLike its wheeled sibling, power is provided by a 4.4-litre JCB Ecomax engine developing 74hp together with a 90 \nlitres/min hydraulic system as standard.\n\nHydrostatic drive offers a modest forward speed that is limited to 13kph and it runs on 450mm-wide rubber tracks.\n\nJCB says the 3TS-8T handles in a similar fashion to a regular skid-steer, with the obvious perk of being able to use \nthe extending boom to load muck trailers or stack bales.\n\nSee also: On test: JCB Teleskid v Norcar a7545 mini pivot-steer\n\nThe tracked model is actually able to lift more than the wheeled version because it weighs around 1.3t more.

Farmers often request \nadvice if they feel they\u2019re not achieving target performance, such as the desired growth rates in their calves.\n\nI\u2019ll help set targets and provide suggestions that will help reach them, looking at key areas including calf nutrition, \ndisease management, housing and the environment. \n\nWhat do you most enjoy about your job?\n\nI enjoy making a difference. When I make suggestions for changes in calf nutrition or housing for example, and I \nthen go back to weigh the calves and can see an increase in daily liveweight gain or reduction in disease incidence, \nand I feel a real sense of achievement.\n\nHistorically, calf nutrition has centred around dairy calves, but I have a personal passion for the beef industry, so I \nalso enjoy working with beef rearers and having the flexibility in my job to share my knowledge with both sectors of \nthe industry.\n\nWhat can be the downsides?\n\nI consult over quite a large area of the country, covering the south-west region, including Devon, South Somerset, \nDorset, South Wiltshire and Hampshire, so time away from home can be an issue.\n\nWhat percentage of your job is office-based?\n\nI'd say that 10-20% of my time is spent in the office. The rest of my time is spent out working with customers on-\nfarm, helping find solutions to problems or ways to optimise performance.\n\nWhat skills and qualifications are essential to the job?\n\nGood interpersonal skills are key in my role. When you\u2019re interacting with farmers every day you need to be a good \nlistener.\n\nProblem solving skills are also essential for this role. The ability to walk on to a farm with an issue, dig down to find \nthe cause and provide a solution is vital. It's much more about the person than qualifications. \n\nWhat experience did you have before starting? \n\nI grew up on a beef farm in Northern Ireland and went to study Animal Behaviour and Welfare at Bristol University.\n\nFrom there, I worked for a meat processing company for two years before joining Wynnstay. I love the contact I get \nwith farmers, and the diversity of farms I see on a daily basis.\n\nWhat tips/advice would you give to someone wanting a similar role?\n\nBe open minded. In an advisory role there is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach. Go on to each farm with no pre-\nconceived ideas of what they\u2019re doing right and wrong.\n\nYou will come across scenarios where what the farmer is doing, in theory, should not work as well as it does.

This \nseason Mr Metson is growing two varieties which have a proven track record as second wheats \u2013 Skyfall and Zyatt.\n\nWhile data is somewhat limited on second wheat performance, some have been shown to consistently deliver as \nsecond wheats and this should be the deciding factor, not their performance as first wheats.\n\nA good second wheat will be a vigorous grower in the autumn to build root architecture which can cope with a dry \nseason later on.\n\nThis early growth is crucial as root function will be impeded by the fungus as levels in the soil increase, leading to \nnecrosis of the roots and limiting water and nutrient uptake.\n\nMr Metson also tries not to exacerbate the take-all problem with his first wheat varieties.  \n\nKWS product development manager John Miles says that while the theory is still in academia, there appears to be a \nrelationship between how first wheat varieties cope with take-all themselves and the level of the fungus being built-\nup in the soil, which will affect the following crop.\n\nHe says farmers want low-end take-all build-up. This season Mr Metson is growing Zyatt, Crusoe and Bassett.\n\nSoil and nutrition\n\nWhile the right variety is a crucial, soil condition is the most important factor for a successful crop, he says.\n\nDrilling later on better land with improved drainage, rather than drilling early on marginal land which is compacted \nand a bit wet, is the key to limiting take-all.\n\nTherefore to improve soil condition he is applying organic matter in the form of paper waste.\n\nTwo types are being incorporated, one with a high carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, and the other with more phosphate, \nmore nitrogen and less carbon.\n\nThe farm has also just started applying anaerobic digestate from food waste, which has the potential to halve \nnitrogen use.\n\nFeeding the crop at the right time is also important, with 50kg/ha applied in the middle of February to stimulate \nrooting and offset the disease.\n\nAn early dose of nitrogen followed by a main application later in the season avoids leaching losses due to root \ninefficiency.\n\nHowever, the wet and cold conditions this season meant crops received this early application two weeks late, but \nwould have been unlikely to be able to use it effectively any earlier.\n\nThe mild autumn and wet conditions experienced this year mean lazy rooting could be a problem and could affect \nhow nitrogen is taken up by crops.\n\nIn the past it was traditional to plough in front of a second wheat, but now Mr Metson tries not to plough as part of \nhis efforts to control blackgrass by exhausting the seed in the top few inches of the soil.\n\n\n\nA Sumo Trio one-pass disc and press cultivator is instead used to achieve good consolidation around the roots to \nget the crop growing.\n\n\u201cThe ground here isn\u2019t the kindest,\u201d his Agrii agronomist Neil Harper says. \u201cWe would like to be lower-disturbance if \nwe could, but we need to incorporate organic matter as all the straw produced is baled and sold.\u201d\n\nThe move away from ploughing and rolling is achieving better seed beds with a lot less work and cost, as the take-\nall fungus is less able to move through the soil as easily as it does through ploughed land.\n\nSeed treatment\n\nAlthough the combination of the right variety on properly managed soils is keeping the lid on take-all, Mr Metson \nalways uses seed dressing Latitude (silthiofam) to protect roots in the autumn during this important growth stage.\n\nWith the same fungicide programmes, this seed dressing insurance is the only additional input for second wheats \non the farm.\n\n\u201cI treat all my second wheats with Latitude,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a valuable insurance policy and has to be done. Take-all \nis always there ready to bite you.\u201d\n\nDavid Leaper, seed technical manager at Agrii, says: \u201cEvery other year we see a high infection. Take-all is endemic \nand will always build-up, but Latitude has the potential to recover half of the lost yield whatever the variety.\u201d\n\nThis season the crop is looking much better than expected given the difficult weather. The benefits of using Latitude \ncould be particularly evident this season as hot weather, such as that experienced recently, could see untreated \ncrops burn out.\n\nAlthough an additional cost, Latitude is helping Mr Menton aim for the top of the market by protecting the quality of \nhis wheat and allowing him to take advantage of local outlets for milling wheats.\n\nAround 75% of both his first and second wheats make milling wheat protein specification. \u201cWith Brexit we need to \nbe growing crops with value and that we have a market for, and that\u2019s milling wheats,\u201d he says.\n\n5 tips to keep on top of take-all\n\n1. Improve soils\n\nMove away from drilling early on marginal land. Instead ensure drainage is good and seedbeds are well \nconsolidated after ploughing by rolling to enable roots to get a good start before the winter.\n\nHowever, there is a difference between compaction and consolidation.\n\nThis season, heavy rain will have brought on compaction due to sitting water, so take the opportunity to map out \nthose areas and improve them before next season.\n\n2. Variety selection\n\nGrow a variety which is proven as a second wheat, although data is somewhat limited.\n\nGood second wheat varieties should be able to grow vigorously from an October drilling date to establish good root \narchitecture which will cope in drier conditions later in the season.\n\nAlso look to grow a first wheat variety which can cope with take-all on its roots as this can help keep levels in the \nsoil low.\n\n3. Drill later\n\n\n\nEarly sowings exacerbate the disease due to the warmer soils and present a longer potential period for infection, so \ndelay until October.\n\nWhile the take-all risk will be reduced, root structure also has the potential to be reduced. In a dry season poor roots \nwill result in a yield penalty, but this can be negated using a seed dressing.\n\n4. Manage other hosts\n\nShort-term grass leys contain beneficial organisms which can protect a following second wheat, but take-all will \nincrease drastically after a long-term grass ley.\n\nAlso be aware of including host species in cover crops, and the effect of grassweeds and cereal volunteers on \nmaintaining the level of the fungus in the soil during the rotation.\n\n5. Use a seed dressing\n\nWith take-all endemic in UK soils and very weather-dependent \u2013 favouring a dry autumn and winter, followed by a \nwet spring, growers should be prepared to invest properly in the crop to ensure good results.\n\nIt has the potential to recover up to half of the lost yield and will protect quality, allowing growers to target the milling \npremium.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nLamb prices are expected to stay high over the coming weeks, with export demand underpinning farmgate prices.\n\nPrices remain well above historic normal levels, despite having fallen back from the highs of mid-April.\n\nClean sheep slaughterings in the UK are up on where they were a year ago, but export demand is good, imports \nfrom New Zealand have declined and tight supplies and good prices are characterising the global market.\n\nSee also: Why an EU trade deal could hurt beef after Brexit\n\nAs a result, the producers\u2019 share of the retail price of lamb has also shot up over the past three months, taking it to \n67% \u2013 the highest for at least the past 10 years.\n\nThe Livestock Auctioneers Association (LAA) points out that the Muslim holy month of Ramadan began on 17 May, \nwhich has meant high demand for old-season lambs, cull ewes and spring lambs over the past couple of weeks.\n\nDemand from the halal market is also expected to be strong at the end of Ramadan (14 June) when Eid al-Fitr \ncelebrations take place.\n\nThis will be followed by Eid al-Adha celebrations on 21 August, which is expected to result in a particularly strong \ntrade for ram lambs of six months or over.\n\nAverage prices\n\nIn the week ending 16 May, the average liveweight old-season lamb (OSL) SQQ price fell by 4.1p/kg to 237.03 \np/kg, but this is 46.75p/kg higher than a year ago.\n\nThe new-season lamb (NSL) liveweight SQQ price was 303.96p/kg, which was steady on the previous week.\n\nThe LAA reports that after a tough start, because of the weather, the number of new-season lambs now coming into \nmarkets has started to increase.\n\nBut according to AHDB data, in the year to date, 13% fewer new-season lambs have come forward than at the \nsame time last year.\n\n\n\nDeadweight prices for OSL in the week ending 12 May rose by 9p/kg to 578.5p/k, which is 165.6p/kg above where \nit was a year ago, but down on the record prices seen in April.\n\nThe deadweight NSL SQQ followed a similar trend (+9.6p), moving to 610.5p/kg.\n\nRebecca Oborne, AHDB analyst, said lamb prices here have the potential to continue to be well above historic \nnormal levels over the next few months, as prices on the global market were still trending high.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t see them falling away drastically.\u201d\n\nMarket reports\n\nMalton market in North Yorkshire said it sold 1,371 hoggs at its Tuesday market (15 May), which topped out at \u00a3180 \na head and averaged 261.47p/kg.\n\nIt also sold 184 spring lambs with a top price of \u00a3136 (324p/kg) being paid for a 42kg Texel-cross.\n\nBakewell Market\u2019s lunchtime sheep sale on Thursday (17 May) saw spring lambs reaching a high of \u00a3155 a head \n(346p/kg), with an overall average of \u00a3120 a head.\n\nA \u201ctail-end sample\u201d of finished hoggs averaged 198.89p/kg, with well-finished, heavier types making the best prices, \ntopping out at 252p/kg and \u00a3134 a head.\n\nAshford Market\u2019s weekly report on its 15 May sale said demand for quality hoggets was still strong, with quality \nsheep making about \u00a3150 a head.\n\nBut its advice was to sell at these levels before the hogget trade inevitably slides as more new-season lamb comes \non stream.\n\nAt Newark Market on Saturday (19 May), 627 spring lambs went under the hammer, making a SQQ average of \n289.2p/kg, with OSL SQQ at 237.5p/kg.\n\nDeadweight\n\nFarmer marketing group Farm Stock Scotland said more spring lambs were urgently needed.\n\nOver the past week they had been about 600-620p/kg, the highest ever start to a new trading year in living memory.\n\n\u201cWe expect demand to remain very firm as abattoirs switch entirely from hoggets to new-season lamb in the next \ncouple of weeks.\u201d\n\nThe group is advising anyone with hoggets to cash them in as soon as possible to avoid missing out.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nMedium-term prime lamb forecasts remain buoyant despite trade tumbling during Ramadan (17 May to 16 June).\n\nMarts are pointing to a combination of steadily increasing new season lamb (NSL) supplies and Islamic fasting to \nexplain a 50-60p/kg drop in trade over the past two weeks.\n\nGreat British liveweight NSL prices fell more than 70p/kg between 14 May and 25 May, from more than \u00a33/kg to \n231.11p/kg.\n\nHowever, Stuart Ashworth, director of economic services at Quality Meat Scotland, said prime sheepmeat prices \nmay see support a week ahead of the Muslim festival\u2019s conclusion.\n\nSee also: Advice for finishing leftover prime lambs\n\n\n\nAyr\n\nSpring lambs are coming to market two weeks later than normal in Ayrshire, where auctioneer Drew Kennedy, \nCraig Wilson Ltd, says the bad spring has delayed production.\n\nAyr market is yet to see significant NSL numbers at its Monday sales. Numbers were back 30% this week (28 May) \nwith 152 through the ring compared with 220 last year.\n\nVery blocky texels topped the NSL trade at \u00a3134 and others hit 281p/kg, with the whole sale averaging 247p/kg, \nabout 40p/kg back on two weeks ago.\n\n\u201cIt has been hard to get the quality up here,\u201d Mr Kennedy told Farmers Weekly. \u201cIt has taken more effort this year to \nbalance the supply of hoggs and spring lambs and keep the supply of lambs up.\u201d\n\nHe predicted a shortfall in hill lambs coming to market as stores in the back end and as hoggs in 2019 following a \nlong winter and difficult spring.\n\n\u201cHill farmers have had it worst,\u201d he added. \u201cSome ewes were lean and abandoned lambs. Some hill farms are \nreporting between nine and 12 lambs per 20 ewes. You would expect 25 lambs in a typical year.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead two to three weeks, he predicts hoggs to be a better trade from 11 June as Ramadan comes to an \nend and NSL numbers to overtake hogg numbers at Ayr by mid-June.\n\nExeter\n\nQuality is making good money at Exeter where heavier lambs (48-49kg) are in short supply, although hogg prices \nhave dropped 50p/kg on a fortnight ago.\n\nMonday\u2019s (28 May) sale saw heavy lambs making \u00a3137 and recorded a market average of 242p/kg, which was still \n11p/kg up on the year, according to auctioneer Russell Steer of Kivells.\n\n\u201cDecent, in-spec lambs are in short supply now farms are into the tail-end of the hoggs, which are showing the \neffects of a challenging winter,\u201d he told Farmers Weekly. \n\n\u201cWe are perhaps seeing a little bit of resistance to some of the high prices. Good numbers of lambs are coming \nforward now and we are now in the middle of the Ramadan fasting period, which doesn\u2019t help.\u201d\n\nMalton\n\nPrime lamb prices have fallen to 250p/kg from highs of more than \u00a33/kg before the bank holiday at Malton Livestock \nAuctioneers, North Yorkshire.\n\nAuctioneer Keith Warters said better weather had helped finish spring lambs, which had increased numbers at a \ntime of less demand.\n\nHe reported an SQQ of 234.3 for 366 NSLs on Tuesday (29 May), a 22% increase in volume on the week.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA landowner is facing a \u00a310,000 clear-up bill after a group of travellers set up camp on a farmer\u2019s field in Surrey.\n\nSeven caravans arrived at the site of the former Wisley Airfield on Sunday evening (13 May).\n\nFarmer Colin Rayner, who rents the land, discovered the unauthorised encampment when he started work on \nMonday morning (14 May).\n\n\nSee also: Dealing with travellers \u2013 staying safe and staying legal\n\n\u201cWe arrived at the farm at 5am and found them sitting on the former runway,\u201d Mr Rayner told Farmers Weekly.\n\n\u201cWe found the locks on the gate had been cut off with portable angle grinders. Seven caravans were occupying an \narea of the site.\n\n\u201cWe then called the landlord who got a bailiff to serve notice for them to leave by 8pm on Monday (15 May). I\u2019m \nkeeping well away from these people for the safety of my family and farm staff. Their reputation precedes them.\u201d\n\nThe landowner, Wisley Property Investments (WPI), employed a security guard with a dog at the gate to prevent \nfurther caravans from entry.\n\nHowever, under the Human Rights Act, the travellers must be allowed to come and go, especially if they need \naccess to local hospitals and schools.\n\nLarge clean-up bill\n\nThe caravans eventually left the farm on Tuesday afternoon (15 May).\n\nBut WPI is facing a clean-up bill of about \u00a310,000 to pay for the security and bailiffs, repair the gate and remove the \nfly-tipped waste.\n\n\u201cThis is how travellers make their money. They go around housing estates, take a load of muck and then dump it on \nmy land for nothing,\u201d said Mr Rayner.\n\n\u201cThe landowner or farmer is then left to pick up the bill. If you are required to take the waste to a landfill site, it can \ncost \u00a3100 per tonne. A lot of this stuff is contaminated with asbestos, so the cost goes up.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Guildford Borough Council said there was no council involvement, as the  incident happened \non privately-owned land.\n\nSurrey Police said they worked with the private landowner to provide advice and ensure a safe eviction.\n\nCo-ordinated approach\n\nChristopher Price, CLA director of policy and advice, said: \u201cTravellers who occupy land illegally should not be given \nsignificant protections which prevent their lawful removal.\n\n\u201cExisting powers of enforcement could be used much more effectively on private land if the local authority, police \nand other relevant agencies had a more co-ordinated approach and used their joint resources at an earlier stage in \nthe development of an illegal camp.\n\n\u201cTo really tackle illegal sites, the government must ensure there is suitable provision of lawful camps to avoid the \nissues that arise from unauthorised encampments.\u201d\n\nGypsy and traveller encampment on your land \u2013 options \n\nPreventing unauthorised encampments\n\nEnsure your gates are properly locked. You can also put concrete boulders in vulnerable entrances, reinforce gates, \nand flood access routes. However make sure that you do not obstruct a public right of way or a highway or erect \nanything likely to cause injury.\n\nHave ready copies of title deeds or land registry documents, tenancy agreements and grazing agreements to help \nyou quickly prove ownership of your land.\n\n\n\nKeep in touch with neighbours or local rural crime networks to stay informed about potential issues.\n\nEnsure you have adequate insurance cover.\n\nAdvice and options for dealing with an unauthorised encampment\n\nCalmly ask the trespassers to vacate immediately. You should be accompanied in case confirmation is needed that \nyou asked the trespassers to leave. If your own or anybody else\u2019s safety is in doubt then you should leave \nimmediately.\n\n Avoid agreeing any occupation with travellers; inviting would-be trespassers onto your land; or supplying food, \nfirewood or water \u2013 you may inadvertently give them rights.\n\nFind out the details of the nearest authorised site or stopping place.\n\nKeep a record of any damage done to your property.\n\nLiaise with the police and local authority.\n\nFind contact details for a firm of reliable, responsible bailiffs, who if necessary can be instructed to remove travellers \nby relying on the landowner\u2019s right to use reasonable force.\n\nSource: CLA director of policy and advice Christopher Price\n\nGovernment review to tackle illegal gypsy and travellers\u2019 sites\n\nLast month, housing minister Dominic Raab announced a government review of the law and powers to deal with \nunauthorised caravan sites and developments.\n\nThe public consultation, which runs until 15 June, covers police and local authority powers, court processes, \ngovernment guidance, the provision of legal sites, and the impact on settled and nomadic communities.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nLess than a week remains for farmers to complete a major survey examining the effect of crime in the countryside.\n\nThe National Rural Crime Survey aims to measure the personal, social and economic cost of rural crime and \nantisocial behaviour across the country.\n\nSee also: Farm security advice to combat rural crime\n\nThe rural crime survey is available on the National Rural Crime Network (NRCN) website and is open for \nsubmissions until Sunday 10 June.\n\nThe last survey took place in 2015, when 13,000 people responded to give their impressions of crime and antisocial \nbehaviour.\n\nSignificant costs\n\nResults revealed that the financial cost of rural crime to the country was significant \u2013 totaling an estimated \n\u00a3800m/year.\n\nThe goal of the 2018 survey is to provide a clear picture of what has improved, what challenges remain and what \nmore can be done to combat rural crime.\n\nQuestions in the survey cover a range of issues \u2013 including whether you report crimes and if you believe enough is \ndone to catch offenders.\n\n\n\nRural challenges\n\nThe NRCN brings together police and crime commissioners, police forces and organisations playing a key role in \nrural communities.\n\nThese organisations include the NFU, the Country Land and Business Association, Neighbourhood Watch, \nCrimestoppers, Historic England and the Countryside Alliance.\n\nNRCN chairman Julia Mulligan said: \u201cI hope everyone living or working in a rural community will spare a few \nminutes to complete our survey.\n\n\u201cIt will provide a clear picture of what has improved, what challenges remain and what more government, police \nforces and other organisations can do.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nWeed control is set to be a challenge for late-drilled beet crops, tackling stubborn weeds without hitting crops.\n\nMany crops did not receive a post-emergence herbicide and broad-leaved weeds are becoming established.\n\n\u201cWeeds will have hardened up by now and will, therefore, be harder to hit,\u201d says independent sugar beet expert \nMike May.\n\nSee also: What the 5 new sugar beet varieties offer\n\nThe delayed season means farmers are going later, applying herbicides at a time of higher temperatures and big \ntemperature fluctuations.

Therefore, machines on up to 5,000 hours are still popular.\n\nAs a result of this interest, prices have climbed considerably since the lows of \u00a3500 to \u00a31,000, with some tidy \nexamples now worth more than \u00a310,000.\n\nSee also: Video: It's coming; Massey Ferguson's huge 650hp Ideal combine\n\nShipping them abroad\n\nTo get the combines to South America as efficiently as possible, Mr Rushton came up with the idea of piggybacking \nthem on an 18t flatbed lorry (also in high demand) and shipping the two as one unit.\n\nTo fit the machines neatly on the truck bed he removes the wheels, stacking them under the rear hood, and puts \nany spare parts in the grain tank.\n\nHeaders are shipped separately, with units up to 16ft being the most popular and 18ft generally the maximum.\n\nThe combine/lorry package is then hauled on a low loader to Ipswich dock before beginning its transatlantic journey \non the top deck of the ship. When this makes its return journey it\u2019s largely packed with rice and timber.\n\nTypically, the journey takes two weeks and includes various stop-offs in the Caribbean, such as Trinidad and \nTobago.\n\nSometimes the combine and lorry combo has to be shifted around the boat, which is when damage can sometimes \noccur.\n\nAfter their arrival in Georgetown, Guyana, the buyer treats the machines to full overhaul, including fresh paint if \nneeded. They build and fit their own steel track units, too, which help them stay afloat in the paddy fields.\n\n\n\nTooth peg drums are also installed instead of the standard rasp-bar units for more efficient threshing of the tough \nrice plants.\n\nAsian market\n\nPakistan is another country Mr Rushton has been dealing with for the past 15 years or so.\n\nThis market has similar preferences to Guyana, but is willing to take a wider range of machines in more varying \nstates of repair.\n\nRather than being shipped whole, these eastbound machines are disassembled and packed into shipping \ncontainers.\n\nOn average, three combines can be shoehorned into two containers. However, this often involves removing the \nwheels, grain tank, cab, engine and cutting off some sections of tinwork.\n\n\u201cWith the big six-walker 3850s you have to do some serious work,\u201d says Mr Rushton.\n\n\u201cGetting an 11ft 6in combine through a 7ft 6in container opening takes a bit of doing.\u201d\n\nOnce they arrive in Pakistan the machines get completely rebuilt before heading out for cereal and rice harvesting \nduties.\n\nNew Holland 8070s are another particular favourite in this region and Mr Rushton has sent some of these over too.\n\nUK machines\n\nAlmost all of the Laverda combines shipped abroad are sourced from within the UK, and due to the sheer number \nof machines sold in the 1970s and 80s there has been a fairly rich supply over the years.\n\nHowever, due to exports, breaking and scrapping, Mr Rushton reckons there are now just 80 to 100 Laverda \ncombines still running here.\n\nThese range from the 1960s-built M120s up to Laverda and McCormick-branded 2000 series. Many are located in \nthe west of the country and the midlands, where the main Laverda dealer Burgess had it highest concentration of \ndealerships.\n\nHowever, the last dealers to sell the combines in the UK were Yorkshire-based Wilfred Scruton and Mike Garwood \nin Hampshire, so those areas are where some of the latest models can be found.\n\nMost popular model\n\nOne of the most desirable Laverda models is the 3790, which is what Mr Rushton uses to cut the 80ha of arable \ncropping on the 180ha family farm near, Uttoxeter, Staffordshire. \n\nThese combines were built between 1985 and 1992 and have five straw walkers, a 175hp Iveco/Fiat engine a \nhydrostatic transmission and a 16ft header. Tidy versions of these can still command high prices.\n\nSpare parts\n\nTo keep the UK base of Laverda machines rolling, Mr Rushton also provides a comprehensive parts service.\n\nThese include genuine and non-genuine new spares as well as some second-hand items from machines he has \nbroken.\n\nGenerally, Laverdas are pretty resilient, so the most common replacement parts are the usual consumables such \nas belts, bearings and knife sections.\n\n\n\nHowever, the 3600 and 3700 non-hydrostatic machines are notorious for clutch problems.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, they\u2019re an embarrassment,\u201d says Mr Rushton.\n\nAs a result, he sells modified versions that correct most of the problems associated with the original item.\n\nHe also sends parts all over the world, including Poland, Finland, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nLaverda in the UK\n\nLaverda started building combines at its base in Breganze, Italy in the 1950s, but it wasn\u2019t until the late 1960s they \nstarted to make their way into the UK, though importer Bamford.\n\nAt that time Burgess was the main dealer and with more than 100 branches in the UK it quickly got a foothold on \nthe smaller end of the market.\n\nWith plenty of keen deals on offer it managed to saturate many areas with Laverda combines. \n\nMost of the UK machines were built during the 20-year period when Laverda was partnered with Fiat, which is why \nmany sport Fiatagri decals.\n\nHowever, things started to change when Fiat bought Ford New Holland in the mid 1990s and began selling many of \nits machines under the New Holland brand.\n\nLaverda-badged combines were still being sold in the UK at this time, but some machines, such as the TL58i \nhillsider, appeared in New Holland livery.\n\nWhen Fiat added Case-IH to its portfolio, the EU competition authorities insisted it sell off one of its combine \nbusinesses. As a result, Laverda moved to the Argo group in 2000 and for a time, some machines were sold as \nMcCormicks.\n\nFour years later Argo and Agco struck a deal whereby Laverda supplied combines to Agco to sell under its own \nbrand colours. By 2007 that had developed into a 50/50 joint venture.\n\nAgco closed its Dronningborg combine plant in mid-2010, transferring production to the Laverda factory in Italy, \nbefore buying the remaining 50% share from Argo in 2011.\n\nThe Breganze factory is now home to Agco\u2019s entire European combine operation from the Laverda-based straw-\nwalker models sold in Massey Ferguson and Fendt colours, up to the new Ideal range of rotary machines.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\n\u201cFair\u201d and \u201cequal\u201d are not necessarily the same thing when it comes to farming succession and passing on assets.\n\nUS attorney and adviser John Baker works for the Iowa State University Extension service, which runs a \u201cbeginning \nfarmer centre\u201d to help farming families with business planning and succession in particular.\n\nHis advice for successful succession planning includes seriously questioning the tendency for parents to want to \ntreat their children equally. Equal is not the same as fair, he says, and splitting business assets can overburden \nthose running the business.\n\nSee also: Farm succession advice \n\n\u201cSuccessors take over management, heirs take on ownership of assets,\u201d says Mr Baker. \u201cHowever, every business \nand family will vary in size and complexity; successors and heirs can be the same people, but not necessarily.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn larger businesses, non-succeeding heirs could have shares in the business that can only be sold to other family \nshareholders. Such shares would have a capital value but needn\u2019t involve annual dividends.\u201d \n\nSuccession tips from John Baker\n\nA 15 to 20-year succession plan, beginning when successors are aged 20 to 28 and seeing the retiring generation \nstepping down in its 60s.\n\nThe older generation should take the lead in initiating discussion and, while those discussions should be long-term, \nthey should not be so protracted that no decision is ever reached.\n\nEven where it is obvious who will succeed, that person\u2019s skills, education and knowledge must be assessed to \nidentify any gaps, rather than relying on having grown up on the farm and in the business as succession \nqualifications.\n\nIan Naylor, a partner in Staffordshire law firm Bowcock & Pursaill, says there has to be an acceptance that the \ndivision of assets will not be equal and that in most cases the farm has to keep going.\n\nEveryone should be aware of the plans so that there are no nasty shocks when a death happens, he advises.\n\nThe issues of fairness and equality in farming succession are ones that Mr Naylor encounters every week. \u201cMost \nfarming businesses can only support one successor,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe biggest hurdles are likely to be providing for the retiring generation and non-farming family members.\u201d Good \npension planning can help with the former, he says, while there are several options to address the latter.\n\nThese include:\n\nLeave the farm to the farming child or children, with the provision that they pay out certain sums to their \nsiblings/other beneficiaries over a number of years \u2013 there\u2019s no arithmetical model for this, every situation is \ndifferent, but it is important not to place too heavy a burden on the business.\n\nIf there is development potential on the land, provision could be made for siblings to be included in the division of \nany development sale proceeds.\n\nLeave the farm to all siblings, with the farming child/children being given a long-term farm business tenancy so the \nremaining siblings receive the rent. However, this option comes with a warning that fragmented ownership can be \ncomplicated.\n\nMake provision for some land to be sold on the death of the current owner to payout the non-farming siblings/family \nmembers. This is not an option in many cases as all land is usually needed for the farm business. \n\nResidential barn conversions or other dwellings could be left to non-farming children.\n\nLeave the farm to the farming child/children with the provision that if it or any substantial part of it is sold in future, \nthe proceeds should be shared with their siblings.\n\nUse life insurance to provide a lump sum on the death of a parent/current owner \u2013 this can be expensive.\n\nPensions and insurance\n\nInsurance can be part of succession planning \u2013 whole of life cover or term cover can be useful for some families. It \ncan provide a lump sum to pay non-farming children or other family members, to reduce debt, to pay tax or invest in \nthe business. \n\n\n\nIt is usually important that life cover is written in trust so that it remains outside the inheritance tax net, says Justin \nBentley of Oxfordshire-based independent financial adviser Sandringham Financial Partners.\n\nAs well as providing for the retiring generation, any funds left in a pension pot on death can be left to non-farming \nchildren free of IHT, points out NFU Mutual.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nLook beyond the glossy displays of the big manufacturers and there were plenty of innovations to catch the \nlivestock farmer's eye at the 2018 Royal Highland Show.\n\nExhibitors included Ritchie with its high-tech cattle weighing station, an automated sheep crush that won the show\u2019s \nInnovation Award, new ATVs from Yamaha and Suzuki, and Landini\u2019s 7-series tractors.\n\nSee also: Sheep crushes go head-to-head in on-farm test\n\nRitchie Beef Monitor\n\nPrecision farming principles come to beef production with the automated recording of daily liveweight gain provided \nby Ritchie\u2019s high-tech drinking and weighing station.\n\nThe Beef Monitor has a false floor and weigh cells to record individual weights each time an animal drinks \u2013 maybe \nsix to 12 times a day \u2013 and uploads the data to a server, where the information can be accessed and analysed \nonline or via a smartphone.\n\nThe device uses an electronic ear tag reader to identify individuals and record their weight alongside the date and \ntime; it also analyses an animal\u2019s earlier records to reject false readings.\n\nIn future, says Andrew Edwards of Ritchie, the labour-free weighing system could provide alerts if a significant \nchange in weight gain or drinking frequency becomes apparent, and animals could be grouped according to weight \ngain performance and fed accordingly.\n\nHe adds that more accurate selection for slaughter should result from basing decisions on several stress-free \nweighings rather than a single snapshot weighing, with fewer individuals failing to meet the required specification.\n\nThe Ritchie Beef Monitor is priced at \u00a34,200, with a subscription for data transfer and Cloud storage likely to be \n\u00a315-\u00a320/month when finalised.\n\nJames Leggat crush\n\nJames Leggat won a Royal Highland & Agricultural Society Innovation Award for his highly automated Scotsqueeze \nsheep-handling system.\n\nA \"magic eye\" sensor closes the crush when it detects a sheep, adjusting automatically to the animal\u2019s size so that \nits head, feet and backside are easily accessible for treatment while barely bending over.\n\nThe crush is opened by a pedal or switch on the control panel. The drafting gates and the chassis incorporates \nhydraulics to remove the transport running gear and set the assembly level on uneven ground, too.\n\nScotsqueeze also demonstrated a weighing system with automatic powered entry, exit and drafting gates for better \nselection of sheep for slaughter.\n\nDesigned for a throughput of up to 600 fat lambs an hour, the system costs about \u00a314,000 complete with electronic \near tag identification.\n\nIAE water trough\n\n\n\nRedesigned water troughs for cubicle houses hold a bit less, but are simpler and easier to empty with a view to \nensuring cattle always have a clean, fresh supply of drinking water, says IAE\u2019s Paul Scragg.\n\nThe tipping version has a simpler handle and unlatching mechanism to rotate it, while the rigid version comes with a \nslide valve at one end.\n\nBoth are available as free-standing or wall-mounted units in four lengths, with prices starting at \u00a3460 for the tipper \nor \u00a3380 for the valve version.\n\nGlenFarrow boiler\n\nLarge boilers burning \"clean\" waste wood and straw in big bales to heat farmhouses, workshops and offices have \nbeen fundamental to the GlenFarrow business.\n\nBut a smaller model \u2013 resulting primarily from requests from Ireland for burning peat \u2013 is attracting interest as a log-\nburning boiler.\n\nThe GF90 incorporates a 1,200-litre water tank to provide a morning supply of hot water before the boiler is fired up \nfor the day, during which its fuel supply needs replenishing two or three times, says Paul Kitchen of the Lincs-based \nfirm.\n\nThe boiler needs single-phase 3amp electricity and mains water connections and costs about \u00a38,000 plus \ninstallation versus \u00a318,000 all-in for the next-biggest model.\n\nMr Kitchen says annual Renewable Heat Incentive payment receipts of \u00a34,000-\u00a35,000 are feasible.\n\nSuzuki KingQuad 750\n\nSuzuki unveiled a new KingQuad 750 ATV. It is an evolution of the current model, with the same power, but engine \nrefinements generating more torque lower down.\n\nThis, together with a revamped frame and hitch and more effective engine braking and service brakes, has \nprompted a towing capacity increase from 450kg to 600kg.\n\nNational sales manager Harvey Day reckons the new styling give the quad more visual appeal, while installing a \nheadlight on the handlebars improves visibility at night, especially through turns.\n\nRaised handlebars aim to improve the riding position, while revamped suspension using upgraded pre-loaded \nshock absorbers are said to improve the rider\u2019s comfort.\n\nThe KingQuad 750 with power steering is priced at \u00a38,849, while the similar 500 is \u00a38,049 and \u00a37,400 with and \nwithout steering assistance.\n\nYamaha Kodiak\n\nYamaha brought its latest Kodiak quads to the Highlands for a 2019 range preview.\n\nThe Kodiak 700 EPS SE is powered by a slightly smaller-volume (686cc) engine that has updated electronic fuel \ninjection with a remapped control unit said to result in more torque, smoother response and improved fuel economy.\n\nTowing capacity of 600kg makes this a practical machine for farmwork, reckons Yamaha, which will offer the new \nmodel in low gloss black or \"Back-country Blue\" paintwork, offset by a grey seat, front panel and load racks, plus \nsatin black cast-aluminium wheels.\n\nPrices will be revealed when the quad becomes available in September.\n\n\n\nStewart single-axle tipper\n\nWe are used to seeing big-capacity high-spec trailers from Stewart Agricultural, but the small Edge trailers originally \ndesigned to fill containers carrying shipments to far-flung export markets such as Australia are now available here.\n\nThe Edge 4 runs on a single axle, has a built-in body prop as standard and its tailgate can hinge from top and \nbottom, and from one side, swinging right round to latch into place.\n\nHardox steel and twin-pack paint reflect the approach used for the bigger trailers, there are rope rails rather than \nhooks and a hose storage clip.\n\nThe Edge 4 is priced from \u00a35,125 and there are tandem-axle Edge 8 and 12 models that come with LED lights as \nstandard.\n\nStewart dump trailer\n\nStewart also presented a new dump trailer with a body built using Hardox steel and the same construction method \nas on the Pro-series grain and silage trailers.\n\nThat means there are no box section uprights (apart from one at the centre), nor any floor bearers as used on the \nGX-series trailers built from mild steel. The floor and sides are built using thinner but stronger and more resilient \nmaterial.\n\nThese result in some weight saving and a \"cleaner\" design, says Stewart.\n\nThere are 15t and 20t versions; the Construction Pro CP20H on show is equipped with air suspension in place of \nleaf springs and runs on Nokian CT 560/60R22.5 tyres in tandem formation.\n\nNugent road trailers\n\nA number of new and improved features aim to refine Nugent\u2019s range of road trailers, including retractable floor \nlashing points and mesh sides that are now hinged rather than rigid, with a tailgate section that can swing upwards \nwhen tipping.\n\nSpring-loaded flip latches are said to hold the sides in place more firmly to minimise annoying rattles and squeaks, \nand LED lights, previously optional, are now standard.\n\nThe trailers retain Nugent\u2019s \"Dual Drive\" parabolic leaf suspension, which positions the end of the leaf between \nrubber balls and slipper plates for a more progressive and less \"crashy\" response to bumps and hollows.\n\nThis 10ft mesh-sided T3118H-MT is priced at \u00a34,100.\n\nLandini 7-series\n\nThe Royal Highland marked the launch of a new 7-series six-cylinder tractor line from Landini, featuring a 30x15-\nspeed (or 54x27 with creep) transmission with six powershift steps \u2013 two up on the previous version and more \nratios in total.\n\nIntelligent shifting that adjusts to driver demands is claimed for the auto transmission control mode and the tractors \ncan be brought to a halt and moved off again using only the brake pedals if required.\n\nDual Power boost for pto and transport work is on all models and, unusually, the top three have it for static as well \nas mobile pto applications.\n\nThe 7-160 shown in Active \"mechanical\" specification has 151hp for draft work and up to 165hp for pto/transport, \nwhile the new addition range-topping 7-230 Robo-Six has 205/225hp from its 6.7-litre FPTR engine.\n\n\n\nDynamic spec brings electronic spools and other eControl features, plus the option of a data screen, Isobus \nimplement control, guidance and so on.\n\nZetor Hortus\n\nIt says Zetor on the hood, but the Hortus 65 is actually a TYM in different colours.\n\nA modern 2.9-litre Deutz engine developing 67hp is matched to a 24x24 speed transmission, with mechanical or \npowershuttle reverser.\n\nA dual-element gear pump serves up oil at a rate of 39 litres/min for implement functions and the 1.93t capacity \nthree-point linkage, and there is a separate steering pump.\n\nThree-speed pto is also part of the package.\n\nTarget Set weeding machine\n\nFancy this job? Charlie Baker of potato fertiliser injector company Target Set gamely demonstrated the prone \nworking position of this electrically driven self-propelled weeding machine, which deploys up to six prone hand-\nweeding workers, albeit with the benefit of cushions and head rests.\n\nThe device, built by Dutch manufacturer De Jongh, can be powered by a portable generator or batteries topped up \nwith solar energy, and self-steers using a guide running along wheelings between beds of salad or vegetable crops.\n\nCross boom spreader\n\nA boom spreader for herbicide granules from Cross Agricultural Engineering is intended for front linkage use while \nthe tractor tows a set of rolls or a light cultivator.\n\nThe booms, which incorporate a slotted rail for easy positioning of the splash-plate spreading units, form storage \nstands when folded upright and a calibration tray is neatly stored in the frame.\n\nIt\u2019s priced at \u00a31,500 before any Stocks air spreader is installed.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nSecurity camera and sensor specialist Luda has developed a monitoring system that can alert farmers to an electric \nfence break.\n\nThe kit uses two clamps \u2013 one to the fence and a second to a ground pin \u2013 to monitor the circuit and sends \nnotifications via an app if the voltage drops below a preset level.\n\nIt also displays a graph to indicate whether the voltage drop is due to livestock tampering with the fence, or if it\u2019s the \nresult of shrubbery or rain.\n\nThe voltage level of the fence is sent through a built-in SIM card, so the fence status can be checked on any mobile \nphone without having to physically visit the field.\n\nSee also: How to put up an effective electric fence for livestock\n\nIt can be connected at any point in the existing fence and can be powered for two months with the rechargeable \nbattery, or constantly supplied with 220V or 12V.\n\nIf the unit doesn\u2019t report for 48 hours, or if the battery levels drops too low, then it will automatically send the user a \nnotification.\n\n\n\nThe basic kit costs \u00a3175 and sends updates every 48 hours, while the \u00a353/year upgrade checks the fence voltage \nevery minute if it has a constant power supply, or every 10 minutes if it\u2019s running on battery power.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThis spring\u2019s blizzards, sub-zero temperatures and flooding delayed sowing for a month and meant animals were \nkept under cover instead of grazing on the fields.\n\nBut as we moan about the inclement weather of 2018, spare a thought for the farmers of February and March 1947, \nwho suffered the heaviest snowfalls and lowest temperatures ever recorded, followed by the worst floods in living \nmemory.\n\nAmong them was farmer Maurice Wilks, who owned sprawling estates in Warwickshire and on Anglesey.\n\nHe borrowed a neighbour\u2019s ex-Second World War Jeep to get through the deep snowdrifts and clear fallen trees, \nwhile the rest of the country ground to a halt. He was suitably impressed.\n\nWilks was, in truth, a hobby farmer; in his day job he was engineering director of the Rover car company.\n\nBut his experience of the adversities faced by fellow farmers during the terrible winter of 1947 were to change the \nface of modern farming, because when he turned his brilliant engineering brain to the problem he came up with a \nsolution that was eventually to become the Land Rover.\n\nSee also: A nostalgic drive in the retiring Land Rover Defender\n\nKeeping it simple\n\nAlthough impressed with the Jeep\u2019s simplicity and capability, Wilks was frustrated by the much-abused vehicle\u2019s \ntendency to break down \u2013 and the difficulty in obtaining spare parts when it did.\n\nBut his experiences with that battered old Jeep were enough to convince him that a go-anywhere versatile 4x4 was \nexactly what the nation\u2019s farmers needed.\n\nBesides being the ideal farm runaround and towing vehicle, it could also be adapted for light ploughing, sowing, \nharvesting, baling and a host of other duties around the farm.\n\nDuring the Easter weekend of early April 1947, Maurice shared his ideas with his brother, Spencer, who was \nRover\u2019s managing director.\n\nSpencer was eager to press ahead with his brother\u2019s plans, because he knew that Maurice\u2019s proposed Land Rover \nwould also solve the company\u2019s problem with exports \u2013 or, rather, the lack of them.\n\nIn those austere post-war years, steel was strictly rationed and the lion\u2019s share went to manufacturers who exported \nmost of their production to bring in much-needed foreign cash.\n\nUnfortunately, there was little demand overseas for the outdated saloon cars that Rover was still building from pre-\nwar designs and, as a result, the company was in dire straits.\n\nBut aluminium wasn\u2019t rationed so it was decided that the new Land Rover would be built with aluminium bodywork \nbolted on a ladder chassis made from welded offcuts of steel.\n\nA 1.6-litre Rover petrol engine would supply the power. The Wilks brothers sold the idea to the Rover board by \ntelling them that the new vehicle would be a useful stopgap until steel was no longer rationed and reasoned that it \nwould achieve welcome export orders, too.\n\nProduction line\n\n\n\nWithin weeks, Rover\u2019s engineers were building prototypes. The first one had its steering wheel in the middle, so that \nit could be built without expensive conversions to left-hand drive for export.\n\nBut the so-called Centre-Steer was abandoned when it was realised that nobody would be able to see the hand \nsignals of a driver sitting in the middle of the vehicle.\n\nBut they soon got it right and the finished vehicle was on sale less than a year after its conception (a feat unlikely \never to be surpassed in the modern motor industry, where the development period of any new model is measured \nin years).\n\nFor maximum versatility for the farmer, the transfer box had three power take-off (PTO) points for auxiliary \nequipment, including a standard splined drive shaft to the rear to be connected to towed powered machinery such \nas mowers and binders, while an optional capstan winch could be mounted on the front.\n\nThe central PTO featured a pulley to drive vehicle-mounted welding equipment or a compressor to power a bench \nsaw, for example.\n\nDutch launch\n\nThe new vehicle was launched on 30 April 1948 at that year\u2019s Amsterdam Motor Show. It was a low-profile affair \nwith little fanfare, but the Land Rover was an instant success.\n\nWhat had been intended by its parent company as a stopgap aluminium-bodied vehicle to beat post-war steel \nshortages soon became Rover\u2019s best-seller \u2013 and it did indeed achieve excellent overseas sales.\n\nThis was an era when the sun still didn\u2019t set on the British Empire and that versatile 4x4 was exactly what was \nneeded out in the colonies.\n\nBack in the 1950s, it was said that the first motor vehicle seen by three-quarters of the world\u2019s population was a \nLand Rover.\n\nThe Land Rover was a hit with Kenyan coffee growers and Ceylon tea plantation owners alike, but nowhere was it \nmore popular than in the British countryside, among grateful farmers.\n\nThey didn\u2019t mind the fact that the seats were uncomfortable and that both heaters and door tops were optional \nextras. It was very comfortable compared with the tractors of its time.\n\nMore importantly, this was an era when the British Government had decreed that food production, and the acreage \ndedicated to it, had to be increased.\n\nThis was at a time when there was a severe labour shortage on the land, as a result of German and Italian PoWs \nbeing repatriated.\n\nMechanisation was essential and the Land Rover\u2019s sheer versatility was invaluable on the farm.\n\nDesign improvements\n\nThe original 80in wheelbase Series I was steadily improved over the next 10 years until its successor, the Series II, \nwas launched in 1958.\n\nThat was followed by the Series III in 1973, which was replaced in the 1980s by the Stage One V8 (with a 3.5-litre \npetrol engine to address the lack of power in the standard 2.25-litre petrol and diesel engines) and the Ninety and \nOne Ten coil-sprung models.\n\n\n\nEarly in 1990, these utility vehicles were given the same 2.5-litre turbodiesel engine that was under the bonnet of \nthe Discovery, launched the previous year, and the new model was badged Defender, so as not to cause confusion \nin the ever-growing Land Rover family.\n\nDuring its lifetime, the fortunes of the utility Land Rover had changed. In its early years, there was nothing to rival its \nall-round ability.\n\nIf you lived and worked in the countryside, a go-anywhere Land Rover was essential. But from the late 1960s, rival \n4x4s from other manufacturers ended Land Rover\u2019s monopoly.\n\nFew enjoyed the same off-road capability or the longevity of the aluminium-bodied Land Rover, but nearly all were \ncheaper.\n\nOf course, Land Rover launched a few new models of its own to rival those new competitors. The first, in 1970, was \nthe Range Rover.\n\nToday it is seen as a rich man\u2019s luxury 4x4, and priced accordingly, but nearly half a century ago the original two-\ndoor model was aimed at the farmer and was seen as a dual-purpose working vehicle that was equally at home in \nthe fields during the day or going out to dinner on a Saturday night.\n\nIt was very basic, with footwells designed to be hosed down after a hard day out in the mud.\n\nAs the Range Rover headed steadily upmarket, it was joined in 1989 by a new model, the Discovery, which was \npriced to take the fight to Land Rover\u2019s Japanese rivals.\n\nIt succeeded and became Europe\u2019s best-selling 4x4 until it was ousted by its own sibling, the Freelander, in 1998.\n\nAware that farmers would appreciate more workmanlike versions of these new vehicles, the company produced \nvan-style models badged \u201cCommercial\u201d that offered comfort, carrying capacity and excellent towing capability as \nwell as excellent off-road ability.\n\nGrowing family\n\nThese days, a bewildering choice of models bearing the green oval badge is available, including the Range Rover \nSport, Range Rover Evoque, Range Rover Velar and Discovery Sport.\n\nWhat they all have in common is class-leading off-road ability \u2013 it\u2019s part of Land Rover\u2019s heritage and something the \ncompany insists upon before any new model is launched \u2013 but they all have a bit too much carpet and bling for the \ntastes of many who work in the countryside.\n\nMeanwhile, throughout all these changes, the original Land Rover lived on under the Defender badge.\n\nIt still comprised an aluminium body on a steel ladder chassis and was essentially hand-built, although the vehicle \nhad evolved greatly since 1947, with creature comforts such as power steering, comfortable seats and decent \nheating added over the years.\n\nSadly, the Defender was discontinued in 2016. After decades of upgrades to keep it within safety and EU emissions \nrules, the company finally decided that it was time to tear up the 68-year-old design and start again.\n\nBut as the last models rolled off the Solihull production line in January 2016, the family resemblance with the 1948 \noriginal was striking. Stand them alongside each other and you wouldn\u2019t need to take DNA samples to confirm the \nparentage.\n\nAs it celebrates its 70th birthday in 2018, it is only fitting that a long-awaited new Defender is expected to join the \nline-up later this year \u2013 but whether a new generation of green Land Rovers will conquer the countryside as \ncomprehensively as that 1948 original remains to be seen.\n\n\n\nLand Rover landmarks\n\n1948      Original Land Rover makes its debut\n\n1953      Long wheelbase version introduced\n\n1958      Series II unveiled\n\n1966      500,000th Land Rover produced\n\n1967      Rover nationalised and becomes part of British Leyland (BL)\n\n1970      Range Rover launched\n\n1971      Series III\n\n1976      Millionth Land Rover built\n\n1982      Four-door Range Rover released\n\n1986      BL renamed Rover Group\n\n1988      Rover Group is privatised and becomes part of British Aerospace\n\n1989      Discovery becomes third Land Rover\n\n1990      Original Land Rover renamed Defender to avoid confusion\n\n1992      Second-generation Range Rover\n\n1994      BMW buys Rover Group (includes Land Rover)\n\n1995      Annual production at Solihull factory tops 100,000\n\n1997      Freelander is Land Rover\u2019s fourth model\n\n2000      BMW sells Land Rover to Ford\n\n2002      Third-generation Range Rover\n\n2004      Discovery 3\n\n2005      Range Rover Sport is fifth model\n\n2006      Freelander 2 built at Halewood on Merseyside\n\n2007      Record sales of 226,000 vehicles\n\n2008      Ford sells Land Rover to Tata Motors\n\n2011      Range Rover Evoque is sixth model\n\n2015      Discovery Sport replaces Freelander\n\n2016      Defender production ends\n\n2017      Range Rover Velar becomes seventh Land Rover\n\n2018      New Defender expected this autumn\n\n\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nWhen tractors first arrived in the early 1890s they were used mainly for stationary work, with a belt drive powering \nequipment such as threshing machines, and the next step was using the drawbar to pull ploughs and other \nmachinery.\n\nLoad-carrying tractors followed in the early 1900s, with much of the development work coming from British \nmanufacturers.\n\nPioneers included the Bedfordshire-based Saunderson company with a farm transport vehicle announced in 1898.\n\nAn improved version followed in 1906, designed with the driver at the front, a mid-mounted 30hp air-cooled engine \nand a manually tipped detachable load platform at the rear.\n\nThe versatility of the new Saunderson featured in a demonstration organised in a wheat field in 1906, starting with \nthe tractor harvesting some of the crop with a binder.\n\nWhen the binder was unhitched the tractor\u2019s load platform was attached and used to carry sheaves to a threshing \nmachine.\n\nThe sheaves were threshed using the tractor\u2019s belt pulley to power the thresher, and the belt then operated a \ngrinder turning the grain into flour.\n\nWhile bread was being baked from the newly harvested wheat, the Universal ploughed part of the field, prepared a \nseedbed and sowed next year\u2019s wheat crop.\n\nThe programme ended with a picnic tea using freshly baked bread from the newly harvested crop. The \nSaunderson won a Royal Show Silver Medal in 1906, but it attracted few customers.\n\nSee also: Machinery Milestones: Four-wheel drive tractors\n\nRemovable platforms\n\nThe idea of a removable load platform had already appeared in 1900 on Scotland\u2019s first production tractor.\n\nDesigned by Professor John Scott, it was powered by a 20hp engine and the load capacity was said to be three \ntons. The Scott tractor achieved few UK sales, but a small number were exported.\n\nAnother competitor in the load carrier market was the Intrepid tractor built in Somerset by Petter.\n\nAnnounced in 1903, it featured a single-cylinder horizontal engine producing 12hp, and the two-speed gearbox \nprovided 2.5mph for field work and up to 5mph in the transport gear. It was not a sales success.\n\nThe best known of the UK load-carrying tractor pioneers was the Coventry based Daimler company, a leading \nmanufacturer of luxury cars which later became the royal family\u2019s preferred motoring choice.\n\nFarm tractors arrived in the prestigious product range in 1911, powered by a 30hp engine developed for the \ncompany\u2019s cars and featuring the patented sleeve valve design that provided the smooth, quiet performance \nDaimler customers expected.\n\nThe specification also included a belt pulley plus a load container at the rear, but there were few customers.\n\nThe only major American company with an interest in the load-carrying tractor idea was Avery, a leading \nmanufacturer of steam traction engines.\n\n\n\nWith tractors providing increased competition for steam power, Avery announced its new Tractor Truck in 1909 with \ntwo front seats and a rear load container with 3 tons capacity.\n\nA 36hp four-cylinder engine provided the power to plough with three 14-inch furrows, and a front-mounted belt \npulley operated stationary equipment. Production ended in 1914.\n\nUnimog launch\n\nInterest in load carrying tractors waned during the 1920s and 1930s, and the revival in the late 1940s started in \nGermany with the Mercedes-Benz Unimog.\n\nWhen the Second World War ended Germany\u2019s aircraft industry had ceased to exist and a senior aircraft design \nengineer who had lost his job decided to design a farm tractor instead, and the result, in 1947, was a prototype \nversion of the Unimog.\n\nThe production model available from 1948 used a 25hp Mercedes engine, four-wheel drive, suspension front and \nrear, pto drives front and rear, two seats at the front and a one-tonne capacity load container at the rear.\n\nThe Unimog attracted enormous interest when it was launched at the 1948 DLG show, and orders flooded in as \nEurope\u2019s farmers re-equipped after the war.\n\nNow, 80 years later and with numerous design updates, the Unimog is a continuing success story with the \nproduction total recently passing 350,000, although most of the demand now is for construction work and military \nuse.        \n\nThe next German load carrying tractor success arrived in 1951 when Lanz announced their Alldog model based on \na rectangular frame with the driver and engine side-by-side at the rear.\n\nThis left space for front, mid and rear-mounted equipment, providing the versatility to operate more than 50 officially \napproved attachments.\n\nMany of them were specially designed for the Alldog including a range of haymaking machines, a single-row sugar \nbeet harvester, a mid-mounted plough, implements for rowcrops, and even a portable milking machine for small \ndairy herds.\n\nA tipping load-carrying container was probably the most popular attachment.\n\nThe Alldog was a big success on the continent, and some were imported into the UK.\n\nProduction started with a 12hp petrol/paraffin power unit and the final version, with an 18hp diesel engine, arrived in \n1956 when the Lanz factory was sold to provide John Deere\u2019s European production base, which is why the last few \nAlldogs were finished in John Deere colours.\n\nBritish makers\n\nBritain\u2019s load-carrier success of the 1940s was the Opperman Motocart introduced in 1946 to replace the horse and \ncart, which was still doing much of the transport work on UK farms.\n\nThe Opperman family farmed and ran an engineering business in Hertfordshire, and their first Motocart was built for \ntheir own farm where it was so successful that they began commercial production.\n\nThe design was simple, with a tricycle layout and an 8hp air-cooled engine attached to the powered front wheel.\n\nWith 1.5 tons load capacity and an 11.2mph top speed, the Motocart easily outperformed a horse-drawn cart, and \nthe sales total reached more than 10,000 when production ended in 1955.\n\n\n\nSince then there has been little interest in load-carrying tractors. Alternatives for moving small loads have arrived, \nincluding link box attachments for mounting on the back of the tractor.\n\nLightweight all-terrain utility vehicles are also a popular choice, and we have adopted America's enthusiasm for \npick-up trucks.\n\nThere is also a demand for tractors with a load space for equipment such as demountable sprayers or spreaders, \nbut these are not designed as transport tractors for general load carrying.\n\nExperimental tractors\n\nA major setback for agricultural load-carrier enthusiasts came in the 1980s after the Silsoe Research Institute (SRI) \ndecided to organise a major transport tractor investigation.\n\nThis involved building a special 120hp tractor for carrying demountable load units.\n\nFor research purposes the tractor was fitted with both a 10-speed mechanical gearbox and a hydrostatic drive \nproviding a 65kph maximum speed.\n\nRear wheel and pivot steering were both fitted as well as front and rear brakes and suspension.\n\nSpecial load units carried behind the front cab were mounted or removed using a hydraulically operated hook lift, \nand they included a container for grain or root crop harvesting, a rear delivery manure spreader body and, for \nsilage making, a rear-mounted load container for grass from a front-mounted forage harvester.\n\nThe experimental tractor was used in an extensive field test programme during the early 1980s, and the verdict was \na thumbs down for the load carrier.\n\nA standard 126hp tractor working with ordinary trailed equipment would have a much lower capital cost than the \nspecial transport tractor and its demount units, the official report said, and work rates with the standard tractor \nwould be much higher because it pulled bigger loads than the transport tractor could carry.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA 22-year-old man has died following an accident involving a tractor in Denbighshire.\n\nEmergency services were called to Prion, near Denbigh, at 2.31pm on Saturday (2 June).\n\nThe victim has not been named and police have asked for privacy for his family.\n\nSee also: Tributes to woman, 49, killed in farm accident\n\nIn a statement, Inspector Alun Davies, of North Wales Police, said: \u201cWe can confirm that on Saturday afternoon [2 \nJune], North Wales Police, along with North Wales Fire and Rescue Service and Wales Ambulance Service, \nattended an incident at Prion near Denbigh, where sadly a 22-year-old young man was killed in an incident \ninvolving a tractor.\n\n\u201cThe North East Wales and Central coroner John Gittins and the Health and Safety Executive have been informed \nof the incident.\n\n\u201cA thorough investigation is taking place into the circumstances.

But who makes the engines \nused in agricultural vehicles, and where are they built? \n\nThere was a time when Cummins, Deutz and Perkins dominated the production of diesel engines for tractors, \nloaders, sprayers and self-propelled harvesters. But times change: technical challenges, company strategies and \nproduction economics have brought more engine makers into the field.\n\nBelow we chart the source of power for agricultural machines used in the UK.\n\nSee also: Buying a tractor? How to make sense of engine statistics\n\nAgco Power\n\nWhen Agco bought the Valmet (now Valtra) tractor business in 2004, Sisu (now Agco Power) engines came as part \nof the package.\n\nInvestment in engineering and assembly at the Linnavuori plant in Finland \u2013 to increase capacity to 50,000 units a \nyear \u2013 led to the engines being progressively introduced into the entire Massey Ferguson tractor and combine \nranges, with four-, six-, seven- and 12-cylinder designs.\n\nThe 3.3-litre and 4.4-litre diesels have more recently been introduced to the Fendt 200 Vario and 300 Vario tractors, \nthe 9.8-litre and 16.8-litre designs replaced Cat units in the Challenger (now Fendt in Europe) tracked tractors, and \nthe principal OEM customer in agriculture is JCB for its Fastrac tractors.\n\nAgco Power also makes engines in Argentina (3,000 units capacity) and Brazil (30,000 units), and also in China \n(30,000 units) for the Global Series tractors built there.\n\nCaterpillar\n\nCat\u2019s influence has diminished in the agricultural market for large US-built six-cylinder engines but it retains a \npresence through the Perkins-branded Cat engines used by Claas in the Avero and Lexion 760 combines.\n\nCat\u2019s own telehandlers are powered by engines built in the Perkins plant in Peterborough.\n\nCummins\n\nAt its Darlington plant on Teesside, Cummins makes QSB diesels, which JCB installs in wheeled loaders and \nBargam uses in its Italian-built sprayers, with Agrifac switching from Volvo to 9.6-litre Cummins power with up to \n420hp for the next-generation Condor Endurance sprayer.\n\nCanada\u2019s Versatile is the main tractor customer. Its range is powered entirely by Cummins, while John Deere uses \nthe 15-litre QSX15 in the two most powerful models in its 9R/RT/RX line-up.\n\nThe 4.5-litre and 6.7-litre engines are ultimately derived from the European Engine Alliance joint venture with New \nHolland and Iveco Trucks, which was dissolved in 2008 when Fiat Group\u2019s FPT Industrial assumed full ownership of \nthe Turin factory built to produce the new power units.\n\nCummins likewise gained full control of the Rocky Mount Plant in North Carolina, originally set up with Case \nCorporation as Consolidated Diesel Corporation (CDC).\n\nDaedong\n\n\n\nThe South Korean manufacturer makes most of the engines installed in its Kioti tractors but it recently signed a \nmulti-year deal with Doosan.\n\nDeutz\n\nThis is the independent engine brand found most commonly powering farm tractors and equipment. In 2017 the \nGerman manufacturer supplied 21,660 diesels to agricultural vehicle manufacturers (up 26% on the year before) \nout of a total of 161,646 units.\n\nApart from fulfilling the bulk of SDF Group\u2019s engine needs for Deutz-Fahr and Same tractors, the Cologne-built \ndiesels are used in Fendt Vario tractors from 130hp to 396hp.\n\nArgo Tractors is a more recent customer, switching to new compact Deutz engines for its 70-136hp Landini and \nMcCormick models, and Zetor also now uses the engines for the small Hortus and Major and the six-cylinder \nCrystal models.\n\nDeutz powers the Chafer Interceptor, Hardi Alpha and all Sands sprayers with TCD6.1 engines, and a raft of \ntelescopic handlers from Claas, Faresin, Kramer, Manitou and Merlo as well as wheeled loaders from Schaffer, \nTobroco and Weidemann rely on Deutz power.\n\nEngine manufacture for local markets is undertaken in Argentina in co-operation with Agco, and at a joint venture in \nChina.\n\nDoosan\n\nThis South Korean construction machinery giant, which counts Bobcat among its divisions, is no stranger to building \nlarge diesels for marine and other applications but it is a relative newcomer at the smaller end of the scale, with \nambitions to produce 100,000 units a year at a new plant opened in 2012.\n\nBobcat skid-steer loaders and telehandlers (including Massey Ferguson branded telescopics) use the new 3.4-litre \nfour-pot, and farm and construction equipment heavyweight Lovol Industries is entering a joint venture to produce \nand use the engines in China.\n\nFPT Industrial\n\nThe heavy diesel engines unit of CNH Industrial \u2013 manufacturer of Case IH and New Holland farm tractors, \ntelehandlers and harvesters \u2013 is winning increased OEM sales on top of its in-house customers.\n\nAlmost half of the 606,700 units produced in 2017 were taken by CNH units, with agricultural equipment accounting \nfor 17% (47,400 units).\n\nThe other 54% went to customers such as Argo Tractors with 110-310hp engines for Landini and McCormick \nmodels, and Claas with 75-445hp engines for the Elios 200 and Axion 800 and 900 tractor ranges, plus Dieci and \nMerlo, and Agrifac for its Condor sprayer.\n\nThe current business was formed from the diesel engine operations of Iveco Trucks plus other elements of Fiat \nGroup powertrain operations, brought together under the CNH Industrial umbrella.\n\nThe company makes 3.4-litre to 6.7-litre engines in Italy and the large-capacity Cursor and new V20 engines in \nFrance. FPT also makes engines in Argentina, Brazil and China.\n\nJCB Power Systems\n\nWith 350,000 mainly four-cylinder DieselMax and EcoMax units under its belt in the 10 years to 2015, the JCB \nPower Systems operation at Foston, near Derby, now powers most of the group\u2019s light construction and farm \nhandlers with 4.4-litre and 4.8-litre engines up to 173hp.\n\n\n\nAmong OEMs, Briggs Irrigation uses JCB power for pump sets. Italian firm Mazzotti does likewise for smaller \nversions of its own sprayers and the Vicon iXdrive.\n\nJCB does make a six-pot engine \u2013 but only for lower-emissions regulated markets; and engines are built at its \nIndian construction machinery plant for the local market.\n\nJohn Deere Power Systems\n\nDiesel engine manufacturing is a major enterprise for John Deere, given that almost its entire range is powered in-\nhouse.\n\nThere are plants in Saran near Orleans, France, and at Waterloo, USA, feeding tractor, combine and forage \nharvester production, and also winning some OEM business.\n\nClaas retains Deere engines for the Arion 500 and 600 tractors built in France; Bateman Engineering and Multidrive \nare customers for their UK-built self-propelled sprayers; and Kuhn is among feed-mixer manufacturers using Deere \npower.\n\nA new 13.6-litre engine with up to 684hp could power some of Deere\u2019s most powerful machines from 2020.\n\nKohler\n\nStill best known for small-capacity petrol engines, the US manufacturer moved into diesels with the 2007 acquisition \nof Italian engine maker Lombardini and subsequently introduced its first heavy-duty diesel.\n\nAmong the first customers for the 3.4-litre KDI was JCB for small wheel loaders and telehandlers. The first tractor \napplication is the new Arbos 5000 Series being built by China\u2019s Lovol Group subsidiary in Italy.\n\nKubota\n\nSmall engines are big business for Japan\u2019s leading farm and light construction equipment manufacturer. It claims to \nbe the global market leader for sub-100hp diesels but it also builds larger units \u2013 a new four-cylinder series \ndelivering up to 210hp is on its way.\n\nApart from powering the 95-175hp Kubota tractors sold in the UK, it also counts Avant, Dieci, Manitou, Merlo, \nSchaffer and Tobroco among its materials handling customers with mainly 50-75hp engines.\n\nKubota also makes engines in China, Indonesia and Thailand for local consumption.\n\nLiebherr Machines Bulle\n\nLiebherr 15-litre D9508 V8 powers Krone\u2019s Big X 680 forage harvester with up to 662hp \u2013 other versions go to \n860hp\n\nThe heavy diesels division of the construction equipment giant has its foot in the door at Krone, supplying 687-\n898hp V8 engines for the BiG X 680 to 880 forage harvesters.\n\nA marketing agreement with Deutz should help push more units into the agricultural sector.\n\nMAN Engines\n\nGerman truck and bus maker MAN has just set up its engines operation as a separate business unit thanks to \ngrowing OEM sales, including new business in agriculture.\n\nIt has returned to the Fendt range after a long absence with a 12.4-litre unit for the 380-500hp 1000 Vario series. \nAgco uses the same engine, along with a 15.3-litre unit generating 647hp, for the new Ideal combine.\n\n\n\nClaas and Krone use MAN for their most powerful forage harvesters, peaking at 1,078hp.\n\nMTU\n\nThis division of Rolls-Royce Power Systems, based in Germany, adapts Daimler OM series truck and bus engines \nfor off-highway applications and stamps them with the Mercedes-Benz brand name.\n\nClaas is a big customer, buying 4,000 to 5,000 units a year for most of its Jaguar forage harvesters and Lexion \ncombines, and all Tucano combines and Xerion tractors. MTU engines up to 230hp are slotted into the Spirit, Merlin \nand new Predator sprayers from Househam.\n\nKrone\u2019s smallest forage harvesters have 490-626hp MTU engines, Grimme uses them exclusively for beet and \npotato harvesters, and Agrifac\u2019s Holmer unit employs the 15.6-litre at 626hp for the HexxTraxx.\n\nPerkins\n\nThe UK manufacturer may no longer list any big-name tractor marques among its customers but Perkins Engines \nCo does supply a number of smaller makers, including Armatrac and Lindner.\n\nThe Peterborough factory has capacity for up to 500,000 engines a year, building the small 400 Series and compact \n850 Series (which is derived from an FPT base engine), and the 4/6-cylinder 1100 and 1200 Series engines.\n\nThe new-generation Syncro range of 1.7- to 3.6-litre engines is waiting in the wings for compact machinery and \npotentially a tractor power revival with outputs up to 134hp.\n\nKnight Farm Machinery uses a six-cylinder, 7.1-litre 1206F engine for the Vista 1800 and 2000 series sprayers \u2013 as \ndoes Mazzotti, the Italian manufacturer behind the Vicon iXdrive, for its three biggest models.\n\nSeveral Kramer and Weidemann telehandlers and small loaders get Perkins power and the Cat-branded engines in \nCaterpillar telehandlers are built at the Peterborough facility.\n\nPerkins remains a big engine maker worldwide, with factories in the USA, Brazil and China.\n\nScania\n\nPea pickers built by PMC Harvesters in Fakenham, Norfolk, use a 12.7-litre Scania DC13 with 438hp, while the new \nthree-wheel spreading \u201cfloater\u201d from parent company Ploeger has the 9.3-litre DC09 with 400hp.\n\nThe bigger Scania motor also gets an outing in 500hp form in the DeWulf Kwatro four-row potato harvester.\n\nSDF\n\nThe maker of Same, Deutz-Fahr and Lamborghini tractors returned to latest-emissions engine manufacture with the \n2.9-litre and 3.9-litre FARMotion design built at its Indian plant.\n\nThis is installed in Deutz-Fahr 4E, 5D and 5G tractors, and equivalent Same models, and in the Claas Atos 200 and \n300 supplied by SDF.\n\nSonalika\n\nThe Indian manufacturer of tractors up to 90hp carrying the Solis brand in Europe are powered by in-house engines \nassembled at the tractor plant.\n\nTMTL Engines\n\nThis is the engines manufacturing unit of Tractors and Farm Equipment, maker of TAFE tractors in India, including \nthe 36-60hp models sold in the UK.\n\n\n\nVolvo Penta\n\nMastenbroek drainage trenchers and tracked backfilling vehicles are among the machines powered by Volvo Penta \n5-litre, 8-litre and 13-litre diesels with outputs up to 400hp from the Swedish truck, bus and construction machinery \nmaker\u2019s engines unit.\n\nA 13-litre unit developing 469hp also nestles under the hood of the AVR Puma 3 potato harvester; the same unit is \nused by Agrifac in its Holmer Exxact sugar beet harvesters with outputs of 469hp and 612hp.\n\nFour-cylinder Volvo Penta engines power the Kverneland Siloking feed mixers.\n\nYanmar\n\nThe company\u2019s Biwa plant in Japan specialises in compact three- and four-cylinder diesels up to 100hp. In 2015 it \nreached the five million units milestone, 20 years after opening.\n\nApplications for the TNV Series include one or two small telehandlers in the Dieci, Faresin, Kramer and Wiedemann \nranges, all bar one of the Italian MultiOne loaders and telescopics, and Landini and McCormick compact tractors, \nas well as Yanmar\u2019s own.\n\nZetor\n\nDespite low production volumes of about 3,200 tractors a year, Zetor continues to make its own 4.15-litre, four-\ncylinder engines for the 78-147hp Proxima and Forterra models, and for some OEM sales.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nUK dairy

Adaptable Ashley says taking \npart in the Farmers Apprentice will help him figure out the best way to realise his dream.\n\nHe\u2019s energised by the prospect of meeting like-minded people \u2013 and says if he did win he\u2019d try to get a farm \nbusiness tenancy or share-farming agreement and use the prize money to buy livestock.\n\nInteresting fact\n\nAshley says even though he can\u2019t sing very well, it never stops him from singing along to the radio in the tractor or \nparlour.\n\nSponsored by\n\nSee the Farmers Apprentice website for more information about the competition and bootcamp details, and follow \nthe competition @farmersweekly, #farmersapprentice.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nAt just 21, Laura Green is not just the youngest judge at this year\u2019s Royal Highland Show (21-24 June) \u2013 she\u2019s one \nof the youngest ever to hand out honours at the prestigious event.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I would normally only dream of getting asked to do,\u201d Laura says.\n\n\u201cGetting invited to preside over the Beef Young Handlers class is an amazing opportunity, so I\u2019m really excited, \nalthough a little nervous. Once I get in the ring though, I know the nerves will disappear and I\u2019ll relax.\u201d\n\n\n\nSee also: Balmoral Show 2018 highlights and photos\n\nAlthough a seasoned competitor in young handler classes herself \u2013 and having notched up lots of stock judging \nexperience in other situations \u2013 this will be the first time she has judged at a show.\n\nIt's all in the presentation \n\nThe SRUC graduate from Morayshire has a clear idea of what she\u2019s looking for. \u201cThe young handlers class is about \npresenting their animals to the best of their abilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like to see the handlers paying attention to the judge and being very attentive to \u2013 and aware of \u2013 the animal \nitself. If you\u2019re showing, you certainly can't let an animal see or sense you\u2019re nervous. The handlers should also be \ndressed very smartly.\u201d\n\nThe Green family has strong connections to the Highland Show, having attended for four generations and more \nrecently exhibited with their world-renowned stock, winning the Simmental Champion title in 2014 and the Junior \nInterbreed titles in 2013 and 2016 with home-bred animals.\n\n \n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var \ni=\"InfogramEmbeds\",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?\"http:\":\"https:\";if(/^\\/{2}/.test(s)&&(\ns=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var \na=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,\"script\",\"infogram-\nasync\",\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\");\n\nThis year the family are taking eight Simmentals under the family prefix of Corksie and two under the Garmouth \nprefix, which Laura founded in 2011 when she was given a nine-month-old heifer called Corskie Clover for her 15th \nbirthday.\n\n\u201cMy very first calf under my prefix, Garmouth Clover\u2019s Elderflower, was Reserve Junior Champion at the Royal \nHighland Show in 2015,\u201d she says. \u201cThe previous year, her mother was placed first in her class and together they \nwon Best Cow and Calf in the Simmental section.\n\n\u201cWe use Facebook quite a lot, but we don\u2019t really do any advertising, so the event is a great shop window for the \nbusiness. We also attend about 10 local shows and go to about six pedigree sales a year, mainly Thainstone, \nCarlisle and Stirling. We also sell a lot of stock privately.\u201d\n\nGoing home to bury underpants\n\nLaura returned home to work full-time alongside dad Iain on the 1,500-acre family farm after graduating from \nSRUC\u2019s Craibstone campus last July with a distinction in a rural business management degree.\n\nThe course, she says, represented \u201cthe best of both worlds\u201d, combining agriculture with finance, economics and \nmanagement.\n\n\u201cI commuted over an hour each way every day, but that meant I could work on the farm the whole time I was at \ncollege. There were times that were incredibly busy \u2013 and I came close to missing deadlines on a few occasions but \nnever did.\u201d\n\nThe business has arable, sheep and pig enterprises, alongside the cattle \u2013 which are her main passion. \"I love \nworking with them \u2013 you get to know them all and their individual characters.\u201d\n\n\nIt has recently become part of the QMS/AHDB Monitor Farm programme, designed to spread best practice and help \nimprove productivity and profitability. In fact, the farm made headlines recently as the site of a \u201cpants-burying\u201d \nexperiment.\n\nIt was a bit of fun, but explored a serious point, recalls Laura. The idea was to bury pairs of cotton underpants in \ndifferent soils and see how they decomposed.\n\nIf they rotted quickly, it would suggest the soil was healthy and full of bugs; if they didn\u2019t, it would show the soil \nwasn\u2019t the same quality. \u201cSTV news came out to the farm. The whole thing went viral.\u201d\n\nTechnology lines\n\nAs well as the \u201cbest of the best\u201d in the livestock lines, she\u2019s looking forward to perusing the new technology at the \nshow.\n\nIt\u2019ll be a chance, as well, to catch up with old friends, including those she met through the Aberdeen Angus Youth \nDevelopment Programme, the Simmental Young Members or the Scottish Association of Young Farmers\u2019 Clubs.\n\n\u201cI joined YFC as soon as I could and never looked back. I did everything from stock judging and sports to \nropemaking and tug of war.\u201d\n\nShe'll be at the show \u2013 which she first attended \u201cas a toddler or even younger\u201d \u2013 for the whole four days, staying in \na caravan on the site.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll come back exhausted, but I can\u2019t wait to be a judge. It\u2019s so important to encourage and educate the younger \ngeneration in showmanship. It helps them improve their skills, meet new people and gain valuable knowledge in \nworking at a high standard. Young people working at this level bring valuable enthusiasm and new ideas.\u201d \n\nBuilding up the herd\n\nMeanwhile, Laura continues to build her own herd.\n\nFor Christmas 2014 she was given another heifer, Corskie Fame, which went on to win red rosettes at the local \nshows.\n\nIn April 2015 she made her first purchase at Carlisle, snapping up Sterling Verity\u2019s Dumandy, who had Stirling \nDumandy\u2019s Glory at foot, for 4,200gns.\n\nClover has also gone out to produce more stock, including a full brother to Elderflower, Garmouth Iceman who won \nhis class at the Scottish National Simmental Show in 2017.\n\nShe also recently bought two in-calf Shorthorns in a bid to meet the demand for bulls for their commercial herd. \u201cIt \nwas my idea and, as my dad said, the day they arrived on the farm will be one I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d\n\nAnd as if all this isn't enough, she\u2019s also got a wedding to plan \u2013 she\u2019s getting married next May.\n\nAs for why her and husband-to-be Robert picked that month, well, it's a relatively quiet time on the farm.\n\nIt's just before first-cut silage, the cows will have gone out to grass, the sheep will have finished lambing and it's just \nbefore the Highland Show. \"I've got to make sure I'm back from honeymoon in time for that, after all!\"\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nArla has increased its standard manufacturing litre milk price by 1.15p/litre from 1 June.\n\n\n\nThe rise means the 2,400 producers of the UK\u2019s largest dairy co-op will receive 28.58p/litre for milk with a \nconstituent content of 4.2% butterfat and 3.4% protein.\n\nThis equates to 27.51p/litre for liquid litres of 4% butterfat and 3.3% protein.\n\nSee also: Use profits to prepare for rising costs, dairy farmers told\n\nThe upwards price movement is the co-op\u2019s first substantial increase since October 2017, when Arla\u2019s \nmanufacturing litre was 13% higher at 32.3p/litre.\n\n\u201cAfter a challenging start to the year, I am confident that this milk price increase will be welcomed by our farmer \nowners who have faced difficulties through unforeseen, extreme, conditions in the winter and early spring,\u201d said Arla \nFoods amba board director, Johnnie Russell.\n\n\u201cThe increase has been possible due to the strengthening of the markets.\u201d\n\nMr Russell said despite improving weather, the long cold spring in some areas reduced output leaving commodity \nmarkets short of product.\n\n\u201cThis, coupled with increased export demand and strong European demand, has pushed prices higher, particularly \nin cheese and butter, while skim-milk powder prices have been slightly stronger than expected,\u201d he added.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) has rejected a claim made against poultry supplier Winterton Brothers \nthat its pre-stunned chicken could not be called \u201c100% halal\u201d.\n\nThe firm advertises itself as a family-run business specialising in supplying halal poultry meat, and its website \nprominently advertises it offers \u201coriginal 100% halal\u201d, which was considered misleading by the complainant.\n\nSee also: Why halal will be critical for UK meat market\n\nHalal, which simply means \u201cpermitted\u201d, requires animals to be killed by a Muslim, who offers a short blessing before \ndelivering a clean cut to the neck with a razor sharp blade, severing the carotid artery, jugular vein and windpipe.\n\nIn practice, most halal poultry in the UK is submerged in an electrified water bath set to deliver a \u201crecoverable stun\u201d \nbefore killing.\n\nIntervention opposed\n\nSome Muslims oppose this intervention, claiming it is more humane \u2013 and more in line with their beliefs \u2013 to deliver \nthe kill without stunning.\n\nBut most halal certification bodies in Britain accept pre-stunned meat as halal, and it was for this reason the ASA \ndid not uphold the complaint made against Winterton Brothers.\n\nIt said the company\u2019s poultrymeat, which in this case was supplied by Highbury Poultry, was consistent with normal \nstandards for halal slaughter.\n\nApproved methods\n\n\u201cThe website of the Halal Food Authority stated they did allow the stunning of birds and animals, provided that \nprocess did not kill the animals and it was carried out by certain approved methods,\u201d said the ASA ruling.\n\n\n\u201cAlthough we recognised there was some division of opinion on the role of stunning in the halal slaughtering \nprocess, the requirements for halal slaughter did not appear to prohibit stunning and we understood the vast \nmajority of halal meat sold in the UK was slaughtered using that method.\u201d\n\nWinterton Brothers was approached for comment.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nGerman chemical giant Bayer will ditch the controversial Monsanto name as it prepares to close a $63bn takeover \nof the US seed and

ranked the 16th most-hated in the US.\n\nThe combined entity will create the world\u2019s largest seeds and agrochemical supplier despite Dow\u2019s merger with \nDupont and ChemChina\u2019s takeover

executive Werner Baumann said he expects it to go into effect on 7 June.\n\nTo gain approval in Europe, Bayer had to sell its existing InVigor oilseed rape varieties and hybrid wheat-breeding

about support mechanisms for agriculture after the UK leaves the European Union.\n\nThe warning follows a three-month inquiry examining whether Defra will deliver on proposals to increase farm \ncompetitiveness and enhance the environment. The inquiry was conducted by the House of Commons \nEnvironment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) committee.\n\nSee also: Thousands respond to 'health and harmony' consultation\n\nDefra wants to replace direct payments with a system largely based on support for environmental measures. \nHowever, farm leaders say the plan fails to recognise the importance of agriculture and threatens to expose UK \nfarmers to substandard food imports.\n\nThe committee of MPs recommend that the government ring-fences future funding for farming, provides greater \ndetail on new support mechanisms \u2013 including tax breaks and capital grants \u2013 and maintains environmental and \nwelfare standards on food imports (see \"Efra committee key recommendations\").\n\nBanned in UK\n\nThis week, American president Donald Trump blamed \u201cbig trade barriers\u201d for discriminating against US farmers, \nreigniting fears that British farmers may have to compete against imports of chlorinated chicken and hormone-\nproduced beef \u2013 both currently banned in the UK.\n\n\n\nCommittee chairman Neil Parish said a new funding model for agriculture was essential to ensure farming \nprospered after Brexit. It is also important that any trade agreements ensure imported products met UK standards \nand avoided a regulatory race to the bottom.\n\nMr Parish said: \u201cWe seek more clarity on funding, delivery and timing. The government risks not achieving its \nambition and damaging the sector. The government should respond to the farming sector\u2019s concerns and provide \nclarity as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nNFU president Minette Batters welcomed the report's recommendation that the government rejects any trade deal \nthat paves the way for food imports below UK standards. She added: \u201cIt is vital that British farming\u2019s produce and \ncontribution to the nation is not undermined.\u201d\n\nFresh approach\n\nA Defra spokesperson said Brexit was a historic opportunity to design a fresh approach to farming. \u201cWe have set \nout ambitious proposals to raise productivity and move away from land-based subsidies so we can reward farmers \nfor the public goods they provide.\u201d\n\nThe government has committed to match the \u00a33bn in farm support until the end of this parliament in 2022, followed \nby a longer agricultural transition period to give farmers time to adapt, said the Defra spokesperson.\n\n\u201cWe had more than 44,000 responses to our consultation, which we are analysing before bringing forward an \nAgriculture Bill later this year. We welcome the support shown by the Efra committee for this consultation and will \nrespond to their report in due course.\u201d\n\nEfra committee key recommendations\n\nSupport: Withdrawing direct payments will be \u201c particularly damaging\u201d for grazing livestock, cereal and mixed farms. \nThe government should identify support for small and medium-sized farms and ring-fence funds for the rural \neconomy and environment.\n\nCompetitiveness: The government should produce a farm productivity plan by May 2019 that investigates new tax \nbreaks, advice centres, capital grant support and the successor to the government's agri-tech fund, among other \nareas.\n\nEnvironment: There is broad support for animal health and welfare within Defra\u2019s planned policy of \u201cpublic money \nfor public goods\u201d. But the report says the government should consider food policy and its ability to improve public \nhealth more widely.\n\nStandards: It will be hard for Defra to find the right body to co-ordinate its national public goods framework and \navoid a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d in standards. An assessment of public bodies is required to co-ordinate a planned \nenvironmental land management scheme.\n\nTrade and labelling: The government should ensure that any trade agreements keep agri-food imports out of the \ncountry if they are below the UK's environmental, animal welfare and food standards. This will be supported by \nbetter country-of-origin labelling.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nMPs have launched an inquiry into government plans for an environmental watchdog after the UK leaves the EU.\n\nDefra wants to replace the role of the European Commission and European Court of Justice in enforcing rules on \nair, waste, water pollution and protecting wildlife.\n\nThe House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee said it wanted to scrutinise the proposals \u2013 and Defra \nplans to bring the EU\u2019s environmental principles into UK law.\n\n\n\nSee also: Gove\u2019s \u2018green watchdog\u2019 plan under fire\n\nDefra says the body will provide independent scrutiny and advice on government policy \u2013 and will be able to hold \nthe government to account on environmental legislation.\n\nBut landowners and environmental campaigners have both raised questions about the plan.\n\nConfusion and complexity\n\nThe Country Land and Business Association said the plans risked adding confusion and complexity rather than \ngenuine accountability to environmental policy.\n\nCommittee chairman Mary Creagh said ministers must ensure that the environment, wildlife and the ability to hold \nthe government to account on air pollution must not be lost after Brexit.\n\n\u201cThe new watchdog will not be ready in time for exit day in March 2019, and Green groups have criticised the \nproposed watchdog as toothless,\u201d she said.\n\nHigh standards\n\n\u201cWe will be looking closely at whether the government\u2019s proposals live up to its promises to keep high \nenvironmental standards after leaving the EU.\u201d\n\nThe committee\u2019s investigation will build on the written and oral evidence taken during its inquiry on the \ngovernment\u2019s 25-year plan for the environment.\n\nMs Creagh said the committee welcomed further written submissions on any of the issues raised by the \ngovernment's consultation on its plans to establish a new environmental watchdog.\n\nSubmissions should be made by 5 pm on Friday 1 June so the committee can conclude its inquiry in time to report \nbefore the government\u2019s consultation closes on 2 August 2018.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe Rural Payments Agency (RPA) is \u201cfailing on multiple levels\u201d, which is causing significant harm to farmers and \nraises questions about its ability to deliver in a post-Brexit era, according to MPs.\n\nThe warning is contained in a report on the performance of the RPA, published by the Environment, Food and Rural \nAffairs (Efra) select committee, which concludes the agency is failing in its core duties.\n\nIt is the latest in a long line of official reports published over the past decade which have attacked the RPA over \nproblems in getting support payments out to farmers (see \u2018A history of RPA failure\u2019, below).\n\nSee also: BPS delays down to childish turf war between civil servants\n\nThe report says it is \u201cunacceptable\u201d that more than 3,000 farmers had not been paid under the Basic Payment \nScheme by March 2018, as farmers should be able to rely on getting their payments on time.\n\n\u201cCommunications with farmers and the complaints handling system remain poor,\u201d said MPs.\n\n\u201cThere are also widespread concerns over errors from recent mapping updates and inaccurate payments. This is \nsimply not good enough.\u201d\n\nBrexit transition\n\n\n\nThe committee says it has concerns about the agency\u2019s ability to handle the extra burden of delivering the \nCountryside Stewardship and Environmental Stewardship schemes, responsibility for which is being transferred \nacross from Natural England.\n\nNeil Parish, chairman of the committee, says the group is also not confident the RPA has the capacity or expertise \nto deliver a seamless Brexit transition.\n\n\u201cSubstantial improvements across the organisation are needed to address this.\u201d\n\nNew target?\n\nCommittee members recommended that the RPA should stretch itself by setting a target of paying 98% of BPS \nclaims by the end of March each year \u2013 rather than its 2017 target of paying 90% of customers by the end of \nDecember.\n\nThey point out farmers are becoming increasingly frustrated at having to spend time and effort correcting mapping \nerrors which are not their fault.\n\nInstead of making farmers submit a paper-based RLE1 form to rectify these, the RPA should develop a system that \nallows farmers to make direct changes to the online mapping register.\n\nA history of RPA failure\n\n2006 National Audit Office reports that RPA\u2019s mismanagement of Single Payment Scheme has cost farmers \nmillions of pounds.\n\n2007 Efra committee sums up the RPA\u2019s inability to pay 2005 SPS payments on time as \u201ca catastrophe for some \nfarmers, and a serious and embarrassing failure for Defra and the RPA\u201d.\n\n2009 Public Accounts Committee investigates SPS problems and concludes that a disastrous IT system, poor \nmanagement and delays in payments have contributed to the biggest debacle in the committee\u2019s history.\n\n2009 Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman rules it has found cases of maladministration in the \nimplementation of the Single Payment Scheme.\n\n2016 Public Accounts Committee concludes a \u201cchildish turf war\u201d between civil servants in Defra, the RPA and the \ngovernment\u2019s digital service is to blame for major BPS delays.\n\n2016 Efra committee reports that farmers are facing \"unacceptable\" waits for their BPS payments.\n\n2018 Efra committee says RPA is still \u201cfailing on multiple levels\u201d. \n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nMore than 50 MPs are demanding urgent action to end the \u201cunacceptably poor\u201d mobile phone coverage in rural \nareas.\n\nExpressing concern about progress to date, the MPs are calling for a legally binding coverage obligation imposed \non all four major operators \u2013 EE, O2, Three and Vodafone \u2013 to support the Department for Digital, Media, Culture \nand Sport\u2019s stated ambition to deliver mobile coverage to 95% of UK geographic landmass by the end of 2022.\n\nThe government has estimated that achieving this ambition would add \u00a375bn to the UK\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nSee also: \u2018Rutland is worst place for 4G in England\u2019\n\n\n\nThe letter has been signed by 56 MPs from parties including the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, \nScottish Nationals and Plaid Cymru.\n\nIt challenges the government\u2019s digital secretary Matthew Hancock to bring forward its current speed and ambition of \n4G mobile coverage \u2013 which is up to 10 times faster than 3G services and allows you to stream films or videos to \nyour mobile phone.\n\nThe letter suggests: \n\nImposing a legally binding coverage obligation on all four major operators\n\nA rethink of Ofcom\u2019s statutory obligations clarifying its main purpose must be to work towards the delivery of \nuniversal quality mobile coverage\n\nNew laws to prevent mobile operators hiding behind \u201ccommercial confidentiality\u201d and refusing to tell communities \nwhere and when they plan to roll out coverage  \n\nThe letter has been co-ordinated by the All Party Parliamentary Group for Rural Business, which is chaired by \nJulian Sturdy, Conservative MP for York Outer.\n\nProgress \u2018not good enough\u2019\n\nMr Sturdy said: \u201cOfcom\u2019s Connected Nations report in December 2017 revealed while people inside 90% of UK \npremises can make telephone calls on all four mobile networks, this falls to 57% in rural areas.\n\n\u201cThis is just not good enough and progress in connecting the countryside has been painfully slow. We are asking \nthe secretary of state Mr Hancock to step in and work with Ofcom to ensure the mobile operators speed up delivery \nof 4G to rural areas.\u201d\n\nThe MPs\u2019 collective action follows a report by the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) last month which \nrevealed that in 2015, 2016 and 2017 mobile network operators have been failing to submit applications for new \nmasts to improve mobile coverage in some of the rural areas with the worst 4G coverage. \n\nRural areas \u2018disadvantaged\u2019\n\nCLA deputy president Mark Bridgeman, who farms in Northumberland, said people living in rural areas have been \ndisadvantaged by poor mobile phone coverage for too long due to network operators\u2019 failure to resolve poor signal \nand mobile \u201cnot-spots\u201d.\n\nAccording to Ofcom, For example, 30% of the UK\u2019s landmass is not covered by all four mobile operators.

This \nneeds to be taken into account, said Mr Baker.\n\n\u201cWhile this may appear to be scaremongering, it should be considered that labour, insurance, maintenance and \nservicing costs are also continuing to rise and it is no longer possible for contractors and their customers to bury \ntheir heads in the sand,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe industry needs to work together to ensure the contracting sector can run professional, safe and efficient \noperations, providing skilled labour, specialised machinery and professional services to land owners in a post-Brexit \nera.\u201d\n\n\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nPhenomenal and at times record cull cow prices have been unable to coax more cows to market, as auctioneers \nreport a national average price of 132.88p/kg to start June.\n\nThis leaves cows at least \u00a3100 a head dearer after starting the year at 110p/kg, as even the poorer sorts make \n90p/kg.\n\nHowever, auctioneers say TB restrictions mean many are being sold deadweight. \n\nThe AHDB also reports that deadweight supplies may be tightening. Its figures show liveweight throughputs are \nback 19.8% on the year for the four weeks from 12 May. And slaughter figures for May (8,500-9,000 head) are \ndown on April\u2019s weekly totals of just over 10,000 head.\n\nSee also: How to prevent fertility issues in dairy cows due to lameness\n\nGisburn\n\nGisburn\u2019s cull throughputs are decreasing as TB restrictions start to affect cattle trading in Lancashire. Cull cows \nmet a flying trade on Thursday (31 May), including an astonishing bid of \u00a31,600.60 for a trade-topping continental \ncow, with 59 culls averaging \u00a3854 overall.\n\nBest beef cows made 157.9p/kg, 22 primes made 130p/kg, 29 dairy cows made 121p/kg and leaner cows made \n98.5p/kg.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the trade there for the lean cows that is astonishing,\u201d dairy auctioneer Fred Spurgeon says.\n\nHe says he hasn't seen a cow at 80p/kg or less for a long time.\n\n\u201cWe would expect to see nearer 100 cows a week really, so numbers are down. About 20 mart regulars are \ncurrently under TB restriction.\"\n\nMr Spurgeon says increasing TB restrictions in northern England is limiting the number going live. \u201cAt \u00a325 to test an \nanimal, you\u2019re not going to test a cull cow \u2013 you can send it deadweight instead.\u201d\n\nMarket Drayton\n\nBarbers throughputs are also 50-80 head down on the year at Market Drayton. This is helping trade hit some big \nprices \u2013 sucklers have topped at 190p/kg and dairy culls hit 160p/kg recently (4 June).\n\nAuctioneer and partner Mark Jones has seen numbers drop over the past six or seven years from highs of 600-650 \nto 200-250 since red markets started, with 124 reported last week.\n\nHe says there is less interest in buying feeding cows, with good prices leading to cows being cashed and culled \nearlier.\n\n\u201cOne issue is that for the larger dairies a fortnightly mart isn\u2019t often enough if they are under TB restrictions, so they \nopt to sell deadweight instead,\u201d says Mr Jones. \u201cThere have been a few vendors who have been tempted back to \nthe mart with the trade as good as it is for all types of cows, although some have been lost for good, it seems.\u201d\n\nDumfries\n\nFodder shortages forced people to sell cows in south-west Scotland earlier in the year, leaving supplies tight, prices \nhigh and a very firm outlook for the rest of the summer.\n\n\n\nThis is according to Harry Begg of C and D Auction Marts, who is regularly seeing leaner cull cows over 100p/kg \nand generally over 90p/kg.  \n\nThroughputs through January to April were up to 80-120 head a week, but are now down to 50 head, which is \nreflective of typical summer throughputs.\n\nA small number of Irish bidders were helping trade, sometimes taking 50-60% of the yarding, Mr Begg adds. \n\n\u201cI see no reason why the price will drop at all. I think cow numbers will remain tight for the rest of the summer.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe government is seeking to beef up and expand the network of national parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural \nBeauty (AONB) as part of a review launched by Defra secretary Michael Gove.\n\nAccording to Mr Gove, the creation of national parks almost 70 years ago \u201cchanged the way we view our precious \nlandscapes \u2013 helping us all access and enjoy our natural world\u201d.\n\nSee also: Defra cash injection to fund English peat bog restoration\n\n\u201cAmid a growing population, changes in technology and a decline in certain habitats, the time is right for us to look \nafresh at these landscapes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure they are not only conserved, but enhanced for the next generation.\u201d\n\nThe review is one of the key commitments under the government\u2019s 25-year Environment Plan, published last \nJanuary.\n\nThe national parks network and review\n\nThere are 10 national parks and 34 Areas of Natural Beauty, covering about 25% of the landmass and home to \nmore than two million people.\n\nDefra claims they generate \u00a320bn for the rural economy, and support 75,000 jobs.\n\nThe review will be chaired by associate editor at the London Evening Standard, Julian Glover, and will report in \n2019 \u2013 the 70th anniversary of the first national park. It will not cover Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.\n\nWhile stressing the aim is not to impose new burdens on people who live and work in the national parks, the terms \nof reference also make clear \u201cweakening or undermining their existing protections or geographic scope will not be \npart of the review\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt will instead focus on how designated areas can boost wildlife, support the recovery of natural habitats and \nconnect more people with nature,\u201d said a statement.\n\nDefra has also made clear it wants to explore ways of expanding the area covered by national parks and AONBs, \nand improving public access.\n\nQuestion of balance\n\nCommenting on the launch, the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) said it was essential the review \nstruck the right balance between ensuring natural beauty and encouraging the right types of economic activity.\n\n\u201cMost businesses within designated landscapes experience significant opposition and hostility to development of \nany kind,\u201d said CLA president Tim Breitmeyer.\n\n\n\n\u201cSuccess in this review will see more landowners, users, park authorities and conservation boards coming together \nto identify opportunities which deliver the right types of sensitive development to improve the use and enjoyment of \nthese unique areas.\u201d\n\nBut the Liberal Democrats have described Mr Gove as a \u201cone-trick pony, reluctant to commit to anything more than \na review or a consultation\u201d.\n\nCase study: Farmer\u2019s diversification woes inside a national park\n\nOne farmer who has experienced issues with the national parks is Susie Macmillan, who keeps 18,000 organic \nlayers at her farm in Ditchling, East Sussex.\n\nGiven the tight margins associated with egg production, she has been seeking to develop a camping diversification, \nincluding 20 wooden lodges in one of the fields on the very edge of the South Downs national park.\n\n\u201cIt has been an absolute nightmare getting the required permission from the national park authority,\u201d she said. \u201cIt \nhas cost us \u00a326,000, not to mention the time, uncertainty and stress it has put on us.\n\n\u201cWe now have the planning permission, but it is subject to 30 conditions. It has been made so difficult \u2013 they just \ndon\u2019t want to see any change at all.\n\n\u201cI accept the national parks do a lot of good, for example in preventing the development of new housing estates on \ngreen spaces. But unless they become more flexible and more pro-farming \u2013 and recognise farming has to change \nand develop too \u2013 then more of us will be forced out of business.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThere have been a number new sales and service agreements for various brands and dealers; we round up what\u2019s \nbeen going on.\n\nSee also: Video: 400hp reverse-drive Valtra S-series on test\n\nHorsch\n\nGerman maker Horsch has strengthened its presence in Scotland, with Kelso and Lothian Harvesters taking on the \nfull range of Horsch sprayers and land working products, while in Derbyshire, Claas main dealer Alkmonton tractors \nhas also been tasked with shifting the Horsch brand.\n\nKuhn\n\nOwning four depots in Hampshire, Berkshire, West Sussex and Salisbury, Oakes Bros now has the job of selling \nthe full lineup of Kuhn\u2019s minimum tillage products and combination seed drills.\n\nClaas\n\nMachinery giant Claas no longer has a financial interest in Sellars, one of Scotland\u2019s largest agricultural \ndealerships.

A light kerb weight of \n1,179kg means it should have ample power, but we found it was a little lackadaisical in providing any serious \npropulsion with two burly chaps in the front seats.\n\nAlthough the Duster isn\u2019t known for mind-blowing speed, we had expected the 1.6-litre block to have a slightly \nbetter turn of pace \u2013 but it'll most definitely be residing in the \u201closer lane\u201d on motorways.\n\nThe engine gets pretty loud as the car winds up to a cruising speed of 70mph. There are undoubtedly more \ncomfortable vehicles for long commutes, but it's perfectly good for short jaunts on country roads.\n\nThe wing mirrors create a bit of unwanted wind noise at speed, although sound deadening has been improved \nacross the whole car and a 0.35mm thicker windscreen means old-shape Duster owners should notice a marked \nimprovement.\n\nWe\u2019d probably go for the turbocharged (yes, turbocharged) diesel 1.4-litre four-pot, which had a bit more character \nthan the slightly wimpy petrol offering. And with 260Nm of torque, it will certainly be more capable on towing duties.\n\nTransmission\n\nThe five-speed manual box is basic but works fine, although a hefty left-arm shove is needed to get the clunky stick \nthrough each gate.\n\n\n\nWe found the engine slow to drop when changing gears, which left the four-cylinder engine wildly revving away as \nwe selected the next cog and contributed to a rather stressful experience.\n\nAs far as manuals go, we\u2019d opt for the six-speed box if you plan to be on a motorway for any amount of time, but \nDacia also offers an automatic option that might be a bit more chilled.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Duster is a mishmash of many cars on the inside.

Imports of food produced using techniques banned in the UK would be allowed \u201cover my dead body\u201d, he told \nlisteners on Friday (25 May).\n\nSee also: Brexit must deliver for farming, Theresa May told\n\nMore consumers were prepared to pay for food quality and provenance, said Mr Gove, who appeared keen to pre-\nempt accusations that \u201cgold-plating\u201d UK standards would leave British farmers unable to compete.\n\n\u201cThe future for Britain \u2013 not just in this area but in other areas \u2013 is being seen to set some of the highest standards \nin the world. Of course there is the temptation to believe that left to their own devices politicians will conspire to \nlower standards everywhere.\n\nHighest quality\n\n\u201cBut actually, I think that the future British farming is to say we are not going to compete in a race to the bottom. We \ncouldn't win it and we shouldn't try.\n\n\u201cWe will succeed on the basis of consumers knowing that our food is of the highest quality and they can trace the \njourney from farm to fork and they can have absolute confidence that what they are buying is ethical and \nsustainable as well as being delicious and good value.\u201d\n\nTopics addressed by Mr Gove during an hour-long discussion included antibiotics in livestock production, promoting \ncollaboration between farmers and his intention to base a new system of farm support based largely on \nenvironmental measures.\n\n'Over my dead body'\n\nAt one point, Mr Gove was asked whether UK standards would ever permit the \u201cwholesale import\u201d of American \nfood, which include chlorine-washed chicken or hormone-produced beef \u2013 both methods banned in the UK. He \nreplied: \u201cOver my dead body, as it were.\u201d\n\nMr Gove was also asked about messages emerging from responses to Defra's Health and Harmony public \nconsultation on the future of farming, which closed last month. A common theme was that the government must \nrecognise the diversity of UK farming, he said.\n\nIt was also important to underline that the government recognised farmers would only be able to contribute to \nenvironmental enhancement if their businesses were successful \u2013 and that meant having food production at their \ncore.\n\nFarm policy must focus on food, warns Batters\n\nNFU president Minette Batters has criticised what she described as the lack of focus on food production in Defra's \nconsultation on the future of farm policy post-Brexit.\n\nMs Batters was asked about the Health and Harmony consultation during a public discussion at the Hay Festival. \u201cIt \ndidn\u2019t really mention food at all, and we are farmers, that\u2019s what we do \u2013 and we care for the environment as well \u2013 \nso I think that was a glaring oversight,\u201d she said.\n\nMuch of the consultation document focused on plans to replace direct payments to farmers with a system of support \nbased on rewarding farmers who undertake environmental measures. Ms Batters said Mr Gove had since \nacknowledged that it should have focused more on food.\n\nThe NFU had submitted a 100-page consultation response to emphasise the importance of food production, said \nMs Batters. She added: \u201cApparently, he did design the title himself. I did point out to him that it is a beauty salon in \nEssex if you Google 'health and harmony'.\u201d\n\n\n\nMost countries across the world supported farmers in order to keep food affordable, said Ms Batters. It was vital to \nensure farmers were able to secure a fair return from the market before changing farm support, she suggested.\n\nRadical changes were needed if the government really wanted to introduce a system of public money for public \ngoods because farming was driven by global pricing. \u201cYou can\u2019t just shut your eyes and say the market can run \nitself because the market is a savage beast,\u201d said Ms Batters.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nOne large Norfolk arable farm is seeing the benefits of a switch to using liquid nitrogen in terms of accuracy and \nflexibility, although it is too early to link the change to a rise in yields.\n\nProblems with using solid fertiliser on windy days and the precision achieved using liquid were factors behind the \nmove in 2014, which has resulted in more even crops.\n\nBased just outside North Elmham, north-west of Norwich, Foxburrow Farm gradually introduced liquid fertiliser over \nits 1,800ha of land, and applies it using two Horsch sprayers.\n\nSee also: Solid v liquid fertiliser: Which is best?\n\nSo what were the key factors involved in the switch on the farm, which grows oilseed rape, winter wheat and sugar \nbeet on a range of soils varying from clay loams to sands over chalk?\n\nDecision-making\n\nFarm director Will Goff explains that there were a number of key reasons behind the change from granular to liquid \nfertiliser as he was keen to utilise the technology available through modern sprayers.\n\n\u201cA normal fertiliser spreader is never going to vary the rate, provide section control, or apply the functions that liquid \ncan do, through a sprayer,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got individual nozzle control, flow rate control, everything under the sun is there, and we felt that if we \nwanted that level of detail, we needed to convert to liquid,\u201d he adds.\n\nJohn Alston, Foxburrow\u2019s farm manager, says that on windy days they had to pick and choose when they could \nspread solid fertiliser, which was reducing productivity.\n\nHe also explains that there were a number of aspects of solids that didn\u2019t agree with their farm strategy, such as the \nuse of vital machinery.\n\n\u201cFor me, the forklift is the most valuable piece of kit for farmers throughout the whole year. Having that tied up \ntransporting bags of fertiliser to fields isn\u2019t practical,\u201d he says.\n\nMr Alston highlights other frustrations with solid nitrogen including the wait for rain to break down and soak in \ngranules, the amount of shed storage taken up by bagged fertiliser, and the need to dispose of bags after use.\n\nResults since changing\n\nMr Goff says five years\u2019 worth of data would be needed to say conclusively that yields have improved as a result of \nthe switch to liquid. However, one visible difference since the change is that crops look far more even across the \nfield.\n\n\u201cWith solid fertiliser, there\u2019s usually a big difference in appearance between hills and hollows, and you can see the \nheadlands tail off. With a liquid system, you\u2019ve got uniform green right to the edge,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nMr Goff notes that it is hard to say whether or not this is thanks to liquid, as they have brought in other changes \nsuch as variable rate seeding, but his gut feeling is that they are seeing better crops.\n\nSome yield improvements have been seen in oilseed rape crops, as liquid nitrogen can be applied later than solid \nfertiliser due to the superior height of sprayers.\n\nScorch and corrosion\n\nOne key drawback of liquid fertiliser can be the risk of scorch, which occurs when applied in hot, dry weather. \nScorch from liquid nitrogen can cause spotting and tipping, both of which reduce green leaf area with the potential \nto affect yields. \n\nPros\n\nProvides even consistency across fields\n\nSprayer technology allows application to be far more accurate\n\nAn effective way of moving into precision farming\n\nCons\n\nRisk of scorch on crops\n\nUnable to spray in hot, dry conditions in the warmest parts of the day, so applications are often limited to early \nmorning and evenings.\n\nPotential for corrosion damage to sprayer\n\nMr Alston, who does all the spraying, highlights that the timing of liquid nitrogen on wheat at the flag leaf stage is \ncritical to avoiding scorch.\n\n\u201cI monitor the weather constantly, working early mornings and late nights, when there\u2019s a little bit of dew on the \nground, providing ideal conditions,\u201d he says.\n\nAnother possible disadvantage of liquid is the corrosion it can cause to sprayers, leading to increasing wear on \nparts such as booms, pumps and electrical connections.\n\nMr Alston says growers need to do preparation work on their sprayer, to minimise the chances of corrosive \ndamage, adding that the relevant parts of Foxburrow's two sprayers are mostly stainless steel.\n\nMr Goff adds that if sprayers are given a quick blast with a pressure washer after use, there is a good chance of \nwinning the battle against corrosion.\n\n\u201cIf sprayers are not looked after, then liquid has the ability to chew through anything,\u201d he says.\n\nLabour/safety\n\nThe switch to liquid nitrogen on the farm does not create a reduction in labour, as a second operator is still required \nfor the large 16,000-litre stainless steel bowser, which provides fertiliser and sprayer support.\n\n\u201cWhile it hasn\u2019t necessarily reduced manpower and the need for a tractor, it keeps the forklift on the farm, which \nwas a priority,\u201d says Mr Alston.\n\nTop tips for switching to liquid\n\n\n\nPreparation and maintenance of kit is key. Liquid is going to be physically damaging if you don\u2019t look after your \nsprayer.\n\nWork out suitable locations for your tanks, taking into account security risks\n\nBe flexible and have a plan in place with your agronomist\n\nSafety is extremely important and Mr Goff highlights that with solid products, there is always a risk of accidents \nsuch as bags slipping off forklift pallet forks and half-tonne bags dangling in the air.\n\nMr Alston says a major failure of a liquid tank would only happen if somebody drove into it, and explains that they \nhave a concrete barrier in place to mitigate that risk.\n\nThe positioning of liquid tanks is key, and he suggests that they are sited as close as possible to the farmyard and \naway from busy roads, to reduce the risk of tampering or vandalism.\n\nCost of switching to liquid \n\nMr Goff believes liquid tends to be slightly cheaper than the granular alternative, explaining that storage tanks are \nrented from the fertiliser supplier, Frontier.\n\n\u201cLiquid, without a shadow of a doubt, helps us make savings in the amount of fertiliser we use. You don\u2019t have the \noverlaps, especially with sprayer functions such as GPS and auto shut-offs,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re wanting the accuracy and efficiency of liquid application, then it\u2019s likely you\u2019re going to invest in a high-end \nsprayer, which we\u2019ve done,\u201d he adds.\n\nAndrew Melton, agronomist at Frontier, says many of its customers enjoy the flexibility of using liquid fertiliser.\n\n\u201cWith granular, you\u2019re buying it in bulk at the start of the season and filling a shed. However, with liquid, you\u2019re only \nbringing more in, if and when you need it,\u201d he says.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nAn experienced farmer has died following a quad bike accident on a farm in Northern Ireland.\n\nFather-of-two Hugh Henry suffered fatal injuries in the accident on Saturday afternoon (12 May) in Ringsend, near \nGarvagh, County Derry.\n\nAn air and land ambulance were sent to the scene after an emergency call at about 5pm.

If half of us milk 100 cows, this is unsustainable, as \nit\u2019s an extra 1.75bn litres of milk annually.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m too old to switch to milking cows, but beef farmers have the stock skills, the calving experience and can move \ninto it.\u201d\n\nCase study \u2013 James Taylor, County Antrim\n\nBeef producer James Taylor, 35, is in the process of converting to a spring-block calving dairy on his holding near \nPortrush.\n\nCurrently calving 100 spring-calving Stabilisers and finishing 800-900 prime cattle a year, Mr Taylor is hoping to \ntreble his profit a cow by switching to dairy.\n\nHe told Farmers Weekly that, despite achieving profits of up to \u00a3300 a cow, he calculated that an Irish-style dairy \nsystem using economic breeding index cows and a mix of Friesian/Jersey cross-breds will make more money.\n\n\u201cIn a normal year, I can make more than \u00a3200 a cow profit, but dairying should make \u00a3900-\u00a31,000 a cow,\u201d said Mr \nTaylor. \u201cWe will stay in the beef industry to a degree, grazing store cattle, but I\u2019m not sure if I will continue finishing \nthem, as the finishing shed is being converted to a cubicle house.\n\n\u201cI like being a suckler farmer and they are a profitable enterprise, but I can\u2019t make them come close to the profits \nthat dairy would.\n\n\u201cThere are some suckler herds looking at selling up, but there doesn\u2019t look to be a mass exodus happening.

Newborn lambs are especially vulnerable, sometimes having their eyes and \ntongues pecked out by the birds.\n\nmailto:oli.hill@reedbusiness.com\n\n\nSee also: Sheep farmers issued licences to cull ravens in England\n\nFollowing media attention surrounding the story, the National Sheep Association (NSA) said it had received \nnumerous enquiries and produced a factsheet for members on how to apply for a licence.\n\n\u201cThe position is that, in all UK nations, farmers must first encourage ravens away from livestock using non-lethal \ntactics,\u201d said NSA chief executive Phil Stocker.\n\n\u201cWhere this is not deemed sufficient to protect animals, a licence can be applied for to kill a limited number of birds \nto aid scaring and encourage other ravens away from the area.\u201d\n\nDeterrents\n\nThe NSA factsheet provides a list of non-lethal techniques that can be used to deter ravens (see \"Non-lethal \ntechniques to dissuade ravens\").\n\nNon-lethal techniques to dissuade ravens\n\nGas cannons\n\nPyrotechnic cartridges\n\nDogs\n\nScarecrows\n\nReplica or real corpses of the target bird\n\nFlags, rags and streamers\n\nAnti-perching devices\n\nFor farmers in England, it explains that Natural England also requires anyone wanting a licence to first keep a log to \nprove that non-lethal techniques have failed.\n\n\u201cIf granted, a licence will only permit a very limited amount of birds to be killed and only as an aid to scaring. The \nlicence will not permit an open cull of the birds,\u201d says the NSA advice.\n\nThe factsheet also provides links to both a suitable monitoring form (PDF) and the application form (PDF).\n\nSimilarly in Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) requires \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d that serious damage to \nlivestock is occurring. Application forms are available on the SNH website and the applicant must specify the \nnumber of birds that are believed to be causing the issue.\n\nRaven culling is seemingly more widespread in Scotland, where figures recently quoted by the Scottish government \nconfirmed more than 400 licences had been issued in the past three years, permitting the culling of 3,334 birds.\n\nHigh losses\n\nMr Stocker said he was pleased to see both Natural England and Scottish Natural Heritage moving to help tackle \nthe problem.\n\n\u201cNSA members who suffer high losses from ravens, particularly at lambing time, share troubling stories of the \ndamage these birds can cause.\n\n\u201cIt is important for farmers, who have respected the protection order on these birds, to be able to apply for licences \nwhere the situation cannot be controlled in any other way.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut the NSA also warned that illegal culling could result in up to six months\u2019 imprisonment and a \u00a35,000 fine per \noffence.\n\nNSA members can access further information on the association\u2019s website.\n\nRSPB response\n\nThe RSPB estimates there are now about 7,400 pairs or ravens in the UK and accepts that, in certain \ncircumstances, it may be necessary for farmers to kill a limited number for livestock protection.\n\n\u201cRavens are great opportunists with a hugely catholic diet and will indeed, on occasion, kill lambs,\u201d says \nconservation director Martin Harper on the society\u2019s website. \u201cThe RSPB acknowledges this can be a distressing \nsituation.\u201d\n\nHowever, it questions the lack of transparency in the licence application process.\n\n\u201cHow would we, either the RSPB or a member of the public, know what non-lethal measures had been carried out \nby a farmer and why they failed?\u201d it asks.\n\n\u201cHow would we know how many licences for how many birds have been issued? How many ravens will NE allow to \nbe culled in England, now and into the future? None of this information is in the public domain.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe National Sheep Association (NSA) has called for a wider cull of ravens in Scotland, after Scottish Natural \nHeritage (SNH) came under fire for sanctioning a limited cull.\n\nThe latest licence was granted by SNH to a conservation group in Strathbraan, Perthshire, which requested \npermission to cull ravens to see if that would help a recovery in curlew, lapwing and oystercatcher numbers.\n\nSee also: Farmer uses alpacas to guard sheep flock\n\nThe group blamed ravens for predation and was awarded a licence to cull 69 ravens this year, with more to come \nover the next five years.\n\nBut the decision led to a backlash, with SNH chairman Mike Cantlay even receiving death threats following public \ncomplaints by BBC Springwatch presenter Chris Packham.\n\nJustification\n\nSNH issued a strong justification for licencing the cull, pointing out that the habitat around Strathbraan \u201cis good for \nbreeding waders, but raven numbers are increasing\u201d, adding it was just a trial.  \n\nBut it has since been revealed the culling of ravens is more widespread than first thought. Following a parliamentary \nquestion, the Scottish government confirmed that more than 400 licences for the killing of 3,334 birds have been \nissued by SNH over the past three years.\n\nThis has triggered further condemnation from animal rights groups. Director of OneKind, Harry Huyton, said he was \n\u201cshocked\u201d to find so many ravens were being routinely killed across Scotland.\n\n\u201cRavens are supposedly a protected species, recovering from a long history of persecution,\u201d he said.\n\nHigh lamb losses\n\nHowever, the NSA has offered its support for the culls, and says licences to reduce raven numbers should be more \nreadily available in other parts of the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith lambing now finished across the UK, the NSA has received reports of very high losses to ravens this year, \nincluding flocks in Scotland where 50-100 lambs have been killed,\u201d said NSA chief executive Phil Stocker.\n\n\u201cRavens target lambs in vulnerable moments, even striking the very moment they are born.\u201d\n\nNSA Scottish regional chairman John Fyall acknowledged it was an emotive issue for campaigners, \u201cbut there is \nnothing as emotive as seeing a newborn lamb trying to find a teat to feed from its mother with no tongue and no \neyes\u201d.\n\nLegislation\n\nLegislation allows the culling of ravens under licence \u201cto prevent serious damage to livestock\u201d.\n\nBut the NSA believes raven numbers are getting out of control and more licences to cull are needed to counter the \nknock-on effects on other species.\n\nOneKind, however, says other, non-lethal methods of deterring raven predation should be pursued instead.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe number of farms making a loss in 2017 fell sharply as rising farmgate prices outstripped an increase in the cost \nof inputs.\n\nFigures released

oilseed rape crops taking advantage of the much-needed May sunshine, our four growers taking part in our \nOSR Masters series are keeping a close eye on crop progress as they start to make plans for next season.\n\nIn the second article of this series, yield performance and cost control are vying for our growers'  attention as they \nlook for ways to improve their crops\u2019 prospects and guarantee success.\n\nOver the next few months, we will be following their progress into the next cropping year to see how their new \noilseed rape crops establish.\n\nSam Paske, Hail Weston Farms, St Neots, Cambridgeshire\n\nCultivation kit\n\nHaving built his own piece of kit last year to establish oilseed rape in just one pass, farm manager Sam Paske \nintends to refine it for this coming summer.\n\nGetting team member Andy Harris to fit a Techneat Terracast seeder on to the back of a Horsch Tiger cultivator in \nthe workshop has allowed him to replace a previous disc and Sumo system, reducing the time and costs of \nestablishing 135ha of oilseed rape.\n\nGiven blackgrass pressure on the farm\u2019s heavy clay soils, he opted for a very narrow tine on the cultivator last year, \nso that OSR could benefit from drainage and root development, while soil disturbance and grassweed germination \nwere limited.\n\n\u201cIt worked well in good soil conditions, but we will be modifying it. The plan is to make it a bit more weather-proof, \nso that it can operate in wetter conditions, if necessary, and give greater seed placement accuracy,\u201d he says.\n\nSee also: 4 growers on how they get oilseed rape off to the best start\n\nHerbicide costs\n\nMr Paske has also cut the early costs of growing oilseed rape by using home-saved seed and has set his sights on \nbringing herbicide costs down as he works with Frontier agronomist Ed Schofield.\n\n\u201cThe aim is to trim costs without compromising yield. We are growing conventional varieties so that only a \nproportion of our seed has to be bought in, and we are using benchmarking to compare our costs with others\u2019 and \nlook for ways of reducing them,\u201d he adds.\n\nCurrently, he has Picto, Elgar and Flamingo in the ground \u2013 with the intention to save some of the Elgar and \nFlamingo for drilling next season, as they were more forward than Picto in the winter.\n\nSlug control\n\nDrilling starts in mid-August, at a seed rate of 5kg/ha along with broadcast slug pellets. Most of the straw is baled \nahead of rapeseed drilling, helping to keep slug numbers down, and he plans to roll the crop twice to retain soil \nmoisture.\n\n\n\nWith one of his farms bordering Grafham Water, and the other four all in the River Kym catchment, a water-\nsensitive area, Mr Paske works with Anglian Water when it comes to slug pellet use and relies on ferric phosphate-\nbased pellets when required.\n\n\u201cThe Techneat seeder has a split hopper, so it\u2019s a straightforward operation to apply them at drilling,\u201d he says.\n\nFlea beetle is the main establishment issue, with two autumn insecticides being needed in 2017. Applying some \nmore fertiliser at drilling might help the crop to get away faster, so he intends to look at how that can be done.\n\nA total of 250kg/ha of nitrogen is applied to oilseed rape, with 30kg/ha being applied in the autumn as diammonium \nphosphate (DAP) and the remainder in the spring.\n\nPhilip Woods, DH Woods & Son and PR Farming, Kensworth, Bedfordshire\n\nEstablishment\n\nGiving oilseed rape the best start takes planning and precision, Bedfordshire grower Philip Woods believes. This \nmeans making best use of variable seed and fertiliser rates, matching variety choice to drilling date and establishing \ncrops with low-disturbance tillage. \n\nWith 50ha of hybrid oilseed rape on his home farm in Kensworth and a further 230ha of conventional varieties \ngrown on four neighbouring contract farms, Mr Woods  switches variety type as drilling progresses and conditions \nchange, altering seed rates according to soil texture zones.\n\nHe uses a Mzuri strip-till drill to establish the crop in wide rows, as the one-man, one-pass system has allowed him \nto slash the crop\u2019s establishment costs by moving less soil, as well as reducing his reliance on agrochemicals.\n\n\u201cAt an average of 3.8t/ha, our yields aren\u2019t as good as I would like them to be yet, but there has been progress and \nour variable costs have come down,\u201d he says.\n\nDrilling starts at the beginning of August, with conventionals going in at a 5kg/ha, helped by DAP fertiliser placed \nunder the seed. Slug pellets go down the same day if thresholds have been reached, so the crop can exploit warm \ntemperatures and get going within two days.\n\n\u201cWith oilseed rape, it\u2019s all in the establishment. In good conditions, we find that conventional varieties do very well,\u201d \nMr Woods adds.\n\nAs August progresses, he switches to hybrids for their autumn vigour advantage and adopts a lower 2.6kg/ha seed \nrate, putting 4kg/ha of berseem clover over the back of the drill, which costs \u00a32.40/kg.\n\nCompanion crops\n\nThis companion crop is used to assist rooting, reduce weed germination and provide a distraction for flea beetle \u2013 \nwith pigeons being deterred by the lack of landing sites between the rows.\n\nHis agronomist, Damian McAuley of Indigro, explains that adding the berseem clover is cheap and doesn\u2019t require \nany additional management \u2013 making it a no-brainer.\n\n\u201cOilseed rape rooting does seem to benefit from the companion crop. We have also seen some direct feeding \ndamage from flea beetle on it, so it does seem to dilute flea beetle activity,\u201d he says.\n\nVariable seed rates are used by Mr Woods, so that seed numbers are matched to the expected establishment rate \nof different soil zones.\n\n\n\n\u201cOn our colder, heavier north-facing slopes, we get 65% establishment, but down in the valleys it goes up to 95%. \nWe aim to get 30 plants/sq m established in the autumn, so altering seed rates on the move helps us to achieve \nthat and gives a more even establishment,\u201d he says.\n\nPre-emergence herbicides are not required, as broad-leaved weed numbers have fallen since strip tillage was \nadopted. A single autumn spray of AstroKerb (propyzamide + aminopyralid) takes out both broad-leaved and grass \nweeds, as well as dealing with the berseem clover.\n\nWhizz Middleton, TC Shaw & Sons, Lilley, Bedfordshire\n\nVarieties\n\nIn a bid to raise yields, hybrid varieties account for all the 105ha of OSR grown by Whizz Middleton regardless of \nthe end market.\n\nOperating across four farm sites from the home farm base at Lilley, near Luton, Mrs Middleton and her father Brian \nopted for the variety PT256 for the fields destined for her cold-pressed rapeseed oil, and Clearfield varieties for the \nrest.\n\nHaving seen yields stagnate, they were hopeful that the better autumn vigour offered by hybrids would help crops to \nget away faster and overcome establishment challenges.\n\nHerbicide use\n\nAnother consideration was herbicide use, with the suspicion that the sulfonylureas formerly used in the rotation \nwere delaying the emergence of OSR.\n\nWorking with agronomist Chris Bumford of ProCam, they grew a trial area of Clearfield last year, which performed \nvery well and produced the farm\u2019s highest yield. That gave them the confidence to switch to the Clearfield varieties \nImpressario and Illustrious.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll wait to see how they perform at harvest. It would be good to see some yield progression,\u201d says Mrs \nMiddleton.\n\nDrilling\n\nEarly threats to the crop are flea beetles, slugs, pigeons and very dry conditions at drilling, so as a result the aim is \nto get the OSR direct drilled in the first week of August with a Horsch Sprinter drill.\n\n\u201cWe will stop the combine for the day to get the oilseed rape in. To avoid soil moisture loss, we don\u2019t do a stubble \nscratch or any soil movement first and we direct drill across the tramlines at a depth of 11-20mm, using the \nrecommended seed rate,\u201d she says.\n\nPest control\n\nThe field is then rolled and slug pellets applied. Flea beetle numbers saw an alarming rise in 2014, so post-\nemergence spraying with pyrethroids has become necessary. Adjuvants have proved helpful, so work with these is \nongoing. \n\nA flexible approach to the crop\u2019s agronomy is followed. Clearfield varieties wait until the end of September to \nreceive their first herbicide of Cleravo (imazamox + quinmerac), while the PT256 had an early post-emergence \nmetazachlor spray.\n\nOtherwise, both received Centurion Max (clethodim) for blackgrass control, along with an early application of \n30kg/ha of liquid nitrogen and Universal Bio. In total, crops will receive 230-240kg/ha of nitrogen and 40-45kg/ha of \nsulphur.\n\n\n\nThe better disease resistance of newer varieties is being exploited, as light leaf spot is becoming more prevalent on \nthe farm.\n\nDavid Lord, Lord & Hunt, Clacton-on-Sea, Essex\n\nOilseed rape must be competitive to keep its place on David Lord\u2019s farm, so he has not been afraid to make \nchanges to the way it is established and grown.\n\nLow-disturbance system\n\nHis ultra-low disturbance establishment system based on CrossSlot technology has reduced costs and maintained \nyields, with variety choice allowing the business to add value to the crop through specialist end-use premiums.\n\nDirect drilling is now being carried out across most of the land, so cover and companion crops are being used to \nhelp with soil structure and nutrient recycling. In addition, crop residues are being chopped and retained to prevent \nthe loss of soil moisture and limit weed germination.\n\nThat\u2019s quite a departure from the previous min-till system which worked the top 50-100mm of soil, creating the right \nconditions for blackgrass to germinate. As a result, one third of the 600ha farm is now down to spring crops \u2013 with \noilseed rape following spring oats.\n\n\u201cOur soils were in good shape before we introduced direct drilling, as they had benefited from FYM over the years. \nIt means crop rooting hasn\u2019t been compromised by lack of cultivation, although we are very careful at harvest to \nminimise trafficking and compaction,\u201d he says.\n\nVarieties\n\nThis year, he is growing high erucic acid rapeseed (HEAR) variety Palmedor for the first time, to add an extra \u00a335/t \nto the crop, as well as a small area of Exclaim.\n\n\u201cTry as we might, our average yields are reluctant to get over 4t/ha. We are hoping that the HEAR premium will \nmake up for that \u2013 if oilseed rape yields dip below 3.5t/ha, it\u2019s not worth growing,\u201d he says.\n\nThe farm moved to hybrids a few years ago from Clearfield varieties, as once direct drilling was introduced, the lack \nof soil disturbance reduced weed germination, making the Clearfield concept less relevant.\n\nA companion crop of berseem clover, which goes on with the oilseed rape as it is rolled, has become standard \npractice and adds just \u00a32.50/ha to growing costs, and helps to deter early pigeon damage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s there to help with soil structure, but it also reduces the need for pest control. We haven\u2019t had to use any \ninsecticide for the last two years,\u201d he adds.\n\nDrilling\n\nDrilling starts when soil moisture is right, which may be mid-late August or early September, and he says an ideal \ndate is about 20 August. An even spread of chopped straw from the combine is a big help in retaining soil moisture, \nso he often uses a straw rake as well.\n\nSeed rates are varied on the move according to a soil texture map, with an aim for a minimum of 20 plants/sq m in \nthe spring. Starter fertiliser goes down with the seed, supplying 30kg/ha of nitrogen and some phosphate. Spring \nfertilisers provides a further 180kg/ha of nitrogen and 60kg/ha of sulphur.\n\nPre-emergence herbicides are not required, with just one post-emergence application of AstroKerb or Dow Shield \n(clopyralid) needed to take out any weeds and the clover.\n\nSponsor\u2019s message\n\n\n\nMaking good decisions that protect farm businesses from risk is now every bit as important as driving up output or \nimproving efficiency.\n\nCorteva Agriscience\u2019s product pipeline has been developed to help farmers be more successful in what they do and \nArylex Active in oilseed rape facilitates a revolutionary approach.\n\nIt allows growers to see a crop emerge before spending any money on controlling the weeds within it. No more \nhigh-risk front loading of crop protection products, an end to spray and pray.\n\nThe farmers who will be successful in the future are the ones who can see a new way forward, and we\u2019re looking \nforward to seeing how this project evolves throughout the course of the year.\n\nFarmers Weekly had full editorial control of this report.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nOilseed rape prices have risen over the past week, helped by rising crude oil prices and reports of oilseed rape \ncrops coming off the field in western France at 2.5-3t/ha.\n\nThe same fields yielded 3.3t/ha last year, according to grower co-op United Oilseeds.\n\nThe Ukraine harvest has also started early, with yields about 5% down, but across a far larger area than last year, \nso heading for a larger crop overall.\n\nSee also: Health and safety \u2013 safety campaign checks 1,000 trailers\n\nEx-farm spot prices collected by Farmers Weekly on Wednesday (27 June) averaged \u00a3285.4/t compared with \n\u00a3281.3/t a week earlier, although there is a large regional spread. New crop prices for harvest ranged from \u00a3280/t \nto \u00a3296/t ex-farm.\n\nWhile prices remain below the \u00a3300/t that would trigger more farmer selling, there is little market activity by growers. \n \n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to think that there is potential for oilseed rape prices to go up, but if soya beans remain relatively cheap, \nthe EU will import US soya beans,\u201d said United Oilseeds\u2019 trading manager Owen Cligg.\n\nThe likelihood of a much earlier harvest than originally thought has prompted a flurry of pre-harvest activity to clear \nstores and prepare for the new crop, he said.\n\nOn the trade front, limited export business has been done.\n\nEscalating trade tensions between the US and China have made oilseeds markets extremely volatile \u2013 US futures

As for \nrunning times, the Stihl worked considerably longer run than its cordless cousin, managing 50 minutes to a tank of \nfuel, while the Husky was similar at 41 minutes.\n\nVerdict \u2013 can batteries cut it?\n\nIn power terms,  these cordless machines are now seriously close to the best petrol has to offer and they come with \nthe added bonus of relatively quiet and fume-free operation.\n\nFor out-and-out power, the Stihl is the one to go for, but the Husky is more convenient, particularly if you want a \ngrab-and-go loop-handle model. The Oregon is also worth a punt if you haven\u2019t got too much to do.\n\n\n\nIf not hammering them hard, all of the machines we tested can just manage continuous operation with two batteries \n\u2013 one in the machine and one on charge.  This does assume you have access to a mains power point or vehicle \nwith an inverter in which you can juice up the second battery, though.\n\nAs for price, the machine and one battery will come in around the same as a petrol equivalent, but opting for a \nsecond battery will push that up by another \u00a3200 or so.\n\nHowever, once purchased, these will cost a fraction of the price of a two-stoke machine to run and remove the \ninconvenient task of running to the pumps and mixing the fuel.\n\nIn the same vein as the cordless drill market, these batteries can be used in the makers\u2019 other kit, such as \nhedgetrimmers or leaf blowers, which are handy for cleaning down combines and balers.\n\nAs for their life expectancy, Stihl units are rated to last for 1,200 full charging cycles and Husky says its can do \n1,500, depending on how well they\u2019re looked after. If you do an average of 10 charging cycles per month, that \nworks out at a life expectancy of 10 and 12-and-a-half years respectively.\n\nFor those that do want longer run times to a charge, both Stihl and Husky offer larger backpack battery units. \nHowever, they\u2019ll set you back a good bit more than \u00a3500.\n\nWatch out for specs\n\nIf you\u2019re considering buying one of these machines it\u2019s important to check the specs of the batteries you\u2019re buying. \nWe had the top-end units and all manufacturers featured offer smaller versions, which will have considerably \nshorter run times.\n\nIt\u2019s a similar story with chargers, and lesser versions will take longer to juice the batteries back up.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nAdding ballast to a cultivation tractor is a time-honoured method of delivering maximum grip and making the most of \nthe ponies it has to offer.\n\nTraditionally this has come in the form of front-end weights, tyre ballasting or wheel weights. But the setback with \nall these options is that they\u2019re fairly time-consuming to add and remove \u2013 a front linkage-mounted block is the only \none on the list that\u2019s vaguely convenient.\n\nAs a result, extra weight is often carried around when it\u2019s not needed, which has a serious effect on tyre wear, fuel \neconomy and ride comfort.\n\nBut in a bid to make the ballasting process easier, John Deere has teamed up with French implement maker \nLaForge to build the EZ Ballast system, which is now an option on 7R-series tractors built after 2011.\n\nSee also: How to fit a fertiliser kit to a John Deere drill\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe system consists of a 370kg frame with hydraulic hook arm mounted on the tractor and the 1.7t weight itself.\n\nTo connect it, the operator starts by driving the tractor over the centre of the weight. Once the block is between the \nwheels, they lower the hydraulic hook arm and continue forward slowly until the hook slots into it. The block is then \nraised into the belly of the tractor, before hydraulic locks secure it in place.\n\nWith a little practice, the whole process can be completed in less than a minute, with removal involving a simple \nreverse of the procedure. Adding the system reduces ground clearance by about 2.5cm, although tyre pressures \ncan alter this figure.\n\n\n\nClearly this convenience comes at a price, with the frame and weight combo costing 11,500 (\u00a310,275), plus \nassembly. That\u2019s roughly \u00a36,275 for the frame and \u00a34,000 for the weight. To make it more affordable for those \nrunning several 7Rs, Deere says each tractor can be equipped with the frame and the weight can be switched \nbetween them.\n\nAs a comparison, Deere\u2019s price list quotes two 900kg wheel weights, including the two adapter plates (weighing an \nadditional 70kg a piece), at 6,068 (\u00a35,421).\n\nThe test\n\nTo find out if EZ Ballast is worth the extra outlay, our friends at German magazine Top Agrar put it to the test.\n\nThey took a John Deere 7310R and a 4.6m Kockerling Vector cultivator into a dry clay field and tried out eight \ndifferent options, from no ballast at all to a full 5.3t loading of wheel weights, front-end weighs and the EZ Ballast \nsystem.\n\nTo measure the pulling power of each setup, the Vector cultivator was fitted with hydraulic pressure cylinders in the \ndrawbar. Meanwhile, a GPS system was on hand to accurately measure tractor speed and wheel slip.\n\nThe 7310R was driven as close as possible to its power limit at all times, with the cultivator being pushed down to \ndepths of up to 17cm.\n\nBelow we run through the results from each of the ballasting combinations tested:\n\nUnballasted\n\nThe tractor on its own weighed 11,770kg. However, this included the basic supports for the wheel weights (140kg) \nand the 370kg mounting frame for the EZ Ballast system.\n\nWith this setup, the tractor\u2019s weight distribution was split 42% to the front and 58% at the rear. Pull forces on the \ncultivator were the lowest and wheel slip was the highest of all the setups tested.\n\nFront weight only\n\nJohn Deere supplied its large 1.8t front weight and adding this increased the front axle load by 2.8t to 7.7t.\n\nConsequently, rear weight distribution dropped from 58% to 43%, which improved traction and dropped wheel slip \nby 5%.\n\nHowever, due to the bigger-than-normal front weight, the permissible front axle load was exceeded by 1.2t, which is \nless than ideal.\n\nWheel weights only\n\nAdding wheel weights increased the total weight by 1.8t over the standard tractor.\n\nThis shifted the weight distribution to 37% at the front and 63% on the rear, and due to the load bearing point, they \nhad no influence on the front axle load.\n\nOf all the ballasting options they had the lowest effect on traction, partly due to the already high rear axle load of the \ntractor\n\nEZ Ballast only\n\nWith EZ Ballast, the weight increased to almost the same level as the wheel weights, but the central load point \nmeant it had the same weight distribution as a tractor without any weights.\n\n\n\nAt slower speeds the tractor with EZ Ballast offered 2% less wheel slip than the wheel weights, but as the speed \nincreased, the two variants were more evenly matched.\n\nFront and wheel weights\n\nThe tractor weight increased to 15.4t, with an almost 50/50 distribution. Performance was equal to the front weight-\nonly option, with wheel slip only dropping by 1%. However, the wheel weights had no lifting effect, so the front axle \nwas still overloaded.\n\nFront weight and EZ Ballast\n\nThe front axle load increased further and peaked at 8.5t due to the central attachment point of the EZ Ballast.\n\nWe reckon that with this setup, the front weight can be at least 1t lighter or dropped off completely during faster \npulling work to protect the front axle and improve the ride. We found this combination was a better option than the \nwheel weight and front weight pairing.\n\nEZ Ballast and wheel weight\n\nThis setup would rarely be used as there is no weight on the front axle to offer any grip. For this reason, wheel slip \nincreased slightly.\n\nEZ Ballast, front and wheel weights\n\nThe maximum ballast of 5.3t will be very uncommon. Although the slip dropped to the lowest value, it\u2019s difficult to \njustify this as a viable option for ballasting a tractor.\n\nVerdict\n\nThe EZ Ballast can definitely replace the time-consuming wheel weight option as it offers similar traction (and a little \nmore in places) and only takes a minute to hook on and drop off.\n\nAlthough the front weight-only option performed well in traction terms, it considerably overloaded the front axle. \nTherefore, using a smaller version in combination with EZ Ballast would probably be the ideal, albeit expensive, \nsetup.\n\nAfter the traction tests, we cultivated more land with the EZ Ballast and front weight combination versus wheel \nweights and front ballast.\n\nEZ Ballast came in slightly ahead, only having 8.6% wheel slip, drinking 15.8 litres/ha of fuel, and covering \n3.3ha/hour. Meanwhile, the wheel weight option slipped a bit more at 9.3% and guzzled 16.7 litres/ha of diesel.

This would see a meter in the fuel tanks automatically issue a reminder to order fuel when \nthe tank level reaches a certain point. This can also be set up to automatically request price quotes through Yagro.\n\nFuel is also the main input which Tim Merry orders through Yagro for JV Farming in Dorset. He is operations \ndirector of the joint venture farming business on 1,800ha, growing combinable crops including maize for an AD \nplant.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very simple, convenient and obvious, it\u2019s a wonder it hasn\u2019t been done before,\u201d says Mr Merry who finds he \ndoes not necessarily deal with the same suppliers as he did before using Yagro.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an education and I\u2019ve been pleased to see that smaller local suppliers can give the larger and sometimes \nmore disorganised companies a run for their money.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nMore than 270,000 people flocked to see what makes British agriculture world-class, in what was a spectacular \ncoming together of farmers and the public at large for Open Farm Sunday (OFS).\n\nAs many parts of the British Isles basked in sublime sunshine, more than 350 farms welcomed visitors with a range \nof informative tours, exciting activities and scrumptious produce to taste and take home.\n\nNow in its 13th year, the day saw all types of producers get involved, from large arable estates in East Anglia to \nmixed units in deepest Wales, as well as city farm parks, hop gardens and vineyards nationwide.\n\nSee also: Open Farm Sunday \u2013 why you should get involved\n\nThe nation-wide celebration of agriculture provides farmers with the ideal opportunity to show the public what \nmakes British farming world-class and helps improve consumers\u2019 understand of where their food comes from and \nhow it is produced. \n\nRun by Linking Environment and Farming (Leaf), this is of the biggest events in the farming calendar and is the \nindustry\u2019s annual open day.\n\nLeaf chief executive Caroline Drummond said: \u201cOFS continues to go from strength to strength and yet again we \nhave seen how by working together, the industry can really make a vital difference enabling the public to engage \nwith farming.\u201d\n\n\nWhile numbers were are still being finalised, it\u2019s thought OFS enjoyed a similar level of attendance and number of \nhost farms compared with the past two years.\n\n \n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var \ni=\"InfogramEmbeds\",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?\"http:\":\"https:\";if(/^\\/{2}/.test(s)&&(\ns=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var \na=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,\"script\",\"infogram-\nasync\",\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\");\n\nHere we share a selection of photos from farm open days across the the UK.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA few months ago, I wrote an article detailing my thoughts on the importance of one\u2019s degree when seeking \nemployment.\n\nIn the months following the article, numerous people have asked me: what are employers actually looking for?\n\nUnfortunately there is no set answer to this question, but there are a few constants that will impress any employer, \nwhatever the role.\n\nSee also: Read more of Josh Dowbiggin\u2019s columns\n\nBe a grafter\n\nIn many ways, hard work and determination are the top traits that employers will be looking for. If you can show that \nyou will always go above and beyond the norm in the workplace, you are sure to impress.\n\nBeing a grafter isn\u2019t just about long hours or physical work. It is crucial that you have the right approach to work and \nshow a willingness to learn.\n\nNo one can be perfect at everything, but showing an interest and being keen to expand your knowledge and skills \nset is a big win for you and your employer. Anything can be taught, but only to someone who wants to learn.\n\nYou might argue that it is hard to demonstrate these skills in an interview situation, but if your CV and references \nare full of examples to show that a bit of hard graft is in your nature, that won\u2019t be missed by the employer.\n\nStand out from the crowd\n\nIt is also really important that any application you present doesn\u2019t just get lost in the paper pile. When employers or \nrecruiters are reading through CVs, they haven\u2019t got all day, so it helps if your application stands out, and quickly.\n\nMake sure your CV is bright and bold. If you can get their attention quickly, they will read into the detail. If you don\u2019t, \nthey might just fling it back on the pile.\n\nThe next step in standing out from the crowd is in the content of your application. As harsh as it may sound, being \nchairman of your local YFC club might not always be enough.\n\nMake sure you are seen to be seeking every opportunity to experience different things outside your comfort zone.\n\nThis could be travel, building your own small business or starting a new initiative in your local community.\n\nShow that you are comfortable in positions of leadership or responsibility. If they detect a \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t get\u201d \nattitude, it\u2019ll be hard not to be impressed.\n\n\nCommunicate the right way\n\nFor some employers, being a good communicator is essential, and they will be assessing your qualities in this area \nfrom the get go.\n\nSomeone who is confident no matter who they are speaking to, approachable to all and knows how to listen is \nappreciated in any business.\n\nAt the same time, there is a fine line between confidence and arrogance \u2013 a line I have previously been accused of \ncrossing. This can be a hard one to get right, but I find the key is knowing your audience.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to be open and honest with people, but also appreciate the views of others in the workplace. It is \nimportant that you recognise who you are speaking to, especially with superiors, so make sure you have your say \nwhile also giving time for others to have theirs.\n\nIf you can nail these three opportunities to shine through in your application and interview, you will already be one \nstep ahead of the pack.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFifty years ago the high street was connected to the shopper.  Small, mainly family-owned concerns traded their \nspecialities. Britain was a nation of shopkeepers, so the saying goes \u2013 and the supply chain seemed short. \n\nI remember tagging along with my mother to the shops. \u201cDelicious fresh strawberries just in from Kent\u201d, the grocer \nwould ball. Provenance, seasonality and quality summed up in a short sentence.\n\nSee also: All the reports from Cereals 2018\n\nBy the time the butcher, Mr Simons, had chopped, cut, trimmed and wrapped your meat, you knew a bit about the \nfarmer, the meat, the quality, the price and the gossip. Connectivity.\n\nIn the half century that has followed, corner shops have grown into supermarkets and the supply chains have \nlengthened. Conversations have been lost, in the interest of convenience. \n\nWithout conversations over the counter at the point of purchase, the shopper becomes disconnected, not just from \nthe farmer, but from the produce. Appreciation, knowledge, value and the community all became casualties.\n\nBut attitudes are changing. There is most definitely a growing interest in being more connected with the farmer.\n\nEarlier this month Britain celebrated Open Farm Sunday (OFS). Orchestrated brilliantly by Leaf (Linking \nEnvironment and Farming), this fanfare of farming is hosted by British farmers for the British public.\n\nSince OFS began in 2006, more than 2.2 million people have been to a farm on this special day. \n\nIt's not just the positive, face-to-face interaction that is on the up. In the media \u2013 print, social and broadcast \u2013 the \nhits, swipes and air time are all increasing too.\n\nI attended a number of events on OFS, from the micro to the massive; from a smallholding in Hertfordshire to a \nhuge gathering at Edd and Paula Banks\u2019 Manor Farm at Harlton in Cambridgeshire.\n\nThe energy was palpable at each event.  Moreover, there was an atmosphere of appreciation, enjoyment and \ncommunity, which danced over all of them. \n\nHowever, a week later at Cereals, the UK\u2019s marquee arable event, things were very different. The farmers were \nconspicuous by their absence. Too many conversations were dour and optimism scarce.\n\n\n\nOne can\u2019t but feel parallels with the supermarket metaphor. The supply chain is too long. The retailer \u2013 or in this \ncase the events management company \u2013 is putting too much of a squeeze on the suppliers (the exhibitors), while \nthe consumer (the farmer) feels disconnected as the experience wanes.\n\nHistory tells us this will not end well. Such is the cycle of marquee farm events. Pitch prices increase, large players \nwithdraw, farmers don\u2019t turn up as there is less to see.  \n\nAnd yet, not far down the A505 at Lannock Manor Farm in Weston, an inspirational and independent farm show and \nconference is having a polar opposite experience.\n\nGroundswell, the brainchild of the Cherry family, is a fresh and innovative event that is finding numbers and interest \nbooming.\n\nWith the strapline \u2018by farmers, for farmers\u2019, Groundswell focuses on emerging methods of soil regeneration, \nreducing inputs and increasing profitability in arable and mixed farming situations.\n\nA short supply chain, with farmers sharing knowledge and happy to pay for it.  \n\nIt is apparent that, with the right conduit and connectivity, farming is very much in vogue.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nAside from the weather and a royal wedding, Brexit remains high on the agenda of conversation in the UK.\n\nThis remains the same within the agricultural community, with pretty much everyone (rightly or wrongly) having an \nopinion on how the next few years will play out.\n\nThe sheep sector seems to be receiving the bulk of the somewhat pessimistic predictions, and rightly so, you could \nargue, with a third of lamb meat produced in this country being exported \u2013 the vast majority of which goes to the \ncontinent.\n\nSee also: Read more of Josh Dowbiggin\u2019s columns\n\nI wonder, is a blanket assessment for the future of the sheep sector a fair and balanced analysis of what is to \ncome?\n\nAfter all, we know that margins vary greatly across the sector, meaning some producers are far better prepared \nthan others for the possibility that the Brexit process will negatively impact the domestic lamb price.\n\nThe old \u201cthat\u2019s how Dad used to do it\u201d mantra that some farmers still adopt will probably not be the right way to \nmaintain a sustainable sheep farming business going forward.\n\nProducers need to be able to understand that every penny spent has a purposeful and intended impact on the \nbusiness if they want to survive the next decade.\n\nAccording to AHDB, labour costs for bottom-third producers are more than double those of top-third producers, and \npurchased feed costs for bottom-third producers are almost four times those of top-third producers.\n\nNew approaches\n\nThis difference across the industry cannot be underestimated. There are several new approaches that some sheep \nproducers have adopted to reduce the cost of production.\n\nThe uptake of low-input New Zealand-style systems has been huge, with many producers removing purchased feed \ncosts, lambing outdoors and significantly reducing the cost of labour and veterinary inputs, all while maintaining \nlamb output.\n\n\n\nAside from cost reduction, the big output restraint for many producers is land, so maximising grass production \nallows for increased stocking density, improving enterprise output without the need for capital investment. This is an \neasy win for producers.\n\nAt the same time as reducing cost and maximising productivity, producers should make sure that the lambs they \nproduce are what the market wants.\n\nHitting the specification every time is a sure-fire way to keep margins as wide as possible. However, E-grade lambs \naren\u2019t always profitable lambs.\n\nCost-saving fallacy\n\nThe belief that reducing costs will only reduce output is, in my opinion, a fallacy, and this is proven by the difference \nin margins across the sector.\n\nYes, low-cost systems may not achieve the top price for your lambs at the mart, but that\u2019s irrelevant if it has cost \nyou a small fortune to get those high-sellers.\n\nWhatever happens to the lamb price over the next decade, the sheep industry has the tools and options to cope.\n\nBelow-average producers will most likely struggle, but there is still time for these producers to make changes to \ntheir businesses, in turn becoming fit for the future.\n\nIn my opinion, the producers that know where their costs lie and are producing what the buyers want aren\u2019t just fit \nfor the future, they could be sitting on a goldmine. And as for the predictions, plenty of those haven\u2019t come true in \nrecent times \u2013 just ask Hilary Clinton.\n\nSomebody once told me that an expert is just someone who made three correct guesses consecutively, so for the \ntime being, I\u2019ll be keeping my sheep.\n\nLancashire lad Josh Dowbiggin, 21, is in his final year of studying agriculture at Harper Adams University. He runs a \nsmall flock of Easy Care ewes alongside his Ghyll Beck Hereford Stud business, importing and marketing Hereford \nsemen and embryos from around the world.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nLivestock farmers should invest in good aftermath nutrition after the first cut to ensure they maximise yields and \nquality from second-cut silage.\n\nCheshire-based independent grassland adviser George Fisher, of George Fisher Consulting, says if there was ever \na year to focus on second-cut silage more than first, 2018 is it.\n\nFarmers who have been fortunate enough to take first-cut silage are reporting lighter cuts of grass silage this \nseason in the wake of the late spring, which has affected grass growth across the UK.\n\nFor those who haven\u2019t been able to take first cut yet, Dr Fisher advises getting on to fields as soon as ground \nconditions permit.\n\nSee also: First-cut silage runs high risk of slurry contamination\n\nFirst-cut tips\n\nDon\u2019t delay cutting: make up bulk with more cuts\n\nApply after-cut fertiliser as soon as possible after cutting\n\n\n\nUse a granular compound rather than a blend for better uptake and more landing sites. Granular compounds have \nall nutrients contained in each granule.\n\nDon\u2019t skimp on potash if you want high-energy silage\n\nUse sulphur to boost protein, yield and nitrogen use\n\nDelaying cutting date and subsequent post-cut fertiliser applications after a cold spring will limit silage quality and \nyield. At this time of year, Dr Fisher adds, the maturing of grass loses 0.5-1 D value/day, so a 72 D value today \ncould be 71 tomorrow or the day after.\n\n\u201cIt will be far better to take a first-cut close to the same time as usual and then invest in a full aftercut nutrition \nprogramme to ensure second-cut delivers the right yields with optimum protein and sugar content,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cEnsuring you manage grass properly now is essential to ensure adequate forage supplies for the coming winter.\u201d\n\nAftercut nutrition advice\n\nWhile farmers might be tempted to save money by relying on manure and slurry for grassland nutrition, James \nHolloway of CF Fertilisers warns that this approach could leave farms \u201cwoefully short\u201d of feed.\n\nDr Fisher adds that growers supplementing organic manures with straight nitrogen may find they are short of potash \nand sulphur. \n\nHe says that on farms that have applied as much slurry as possible earlier in the year, available nitrogen will have \nbeen lost by now.\n\nWhat to apply\n\nDr Fisher recommends soil testing so farms know what fertiliser is required, before following with a slurry \napplication. He says an N:K:S fertiliser should set up second cuts well.\n\nEven a 30m3/ha (2,600 gallon/acre) application of a 4% DM slurry will be well short of RB209 recommendations for \nnitrogen, providing only 19kg/ha of the 100kg/ha recommended for a 5t DM/ha grass crop.\n\nNitrogen (N), potash (source of phosphate) and sulphur (S) will therefore be required, explains Dr Fisher. \u201cWork \nfrom your soil analysis and take into account all the nutrients from manures.\u201d\n\nTypical second-cut applications for optimum growth are:\n\n80-100kg of N/ha\n\n25-40kg of S/ha\n\n60-90kg of potash/ha\n\nWhat nutrients does slurry provide?\n\nNutrient\n\nTypical requirements (kg/ha)\n\nNutrition of slurry 30cu m/ha (2,600gal/acre)\n\n% provided by slurry\n\nNitrogen\n\n\n\n100\n\n19\n\n19%\n\nPhosphate\n\n34\n\n14\n\n41.17%\n\nPotash\n\n120\n\n57\n\n47.5%\n\nSulphur\n\n40\n\n2\n\n5%\n\n*Requirements for second cut on a soil p and K index of 2\n\nWhen to apply\n\nAfter-cut nutrition programmes are best applied as soon as possible. Once first-cut is harvested, freshweight \nproduction drops about by 370kg/ha for every day\u2019s delay in nitrogen application, Mr Holloway explains.\n\n\u201cResearch has shown delaying aftercut fertiliser for a two-week period will lead to a potential 20-25% yield loss, \nwhich can be 1t/ha DM,\u201d he says.\n\nHe adds farmers should be prepared to spread slurry more thinly rather than be caught out by having to leave \ncutting until six weeks after the last application.  \n\n\u201cIf you focus on getting high quality from your first cut you can then use subsequent cuts to build silage stocks,\u201d he \nexplains. \u201cFocus on quality. If you need more bulk, take more cuts.\u201d\n\nWhy to supplement with phosphate (P), potash (K) and sulphur (S)\n\nPhosphate\n\nP is vital for energy capture by plants through photosynthesis.\n\nTest soil and strive to maintain a soil P index of 2.\n\nPotash\n\nA three-year trial adding 320kg/ha potash to soil with a K index of 1 lifted average silage ME from 10.9 to 11.5MJ \nME/kg DM.\n\n\n\nSulphur\n\nTrials are showing the benefits of sulphur applications in maximising crude protein and facilitating better nitrogen \nuse.\n\nSulphur plays a vital role in amino acid production (methionine and cystine).\n\nOne trial restored optimum sulphur levels to lift protein by 7% and yields by nearly 2t/ha.\n\nA sulphur containing granular compounds such as 25-0-13-7SO3 or 25-0-6-6SO3 should be considered, particularly \nthis year.\n\nCompaction caution\n\nWith high water tables, independent grassland adviser George Fisher, of George Fisher Consulting acknowledges \nmany producers will have to consider compaction this silage season.\n\nIf possible keep off wet fields especially 48 hours after heavy rainfall\n\nReduce machine size and total axle loads, as loads greater than 3.5t can cause serious and permanent compaction\n\nThe greater the weight of the vehicle and the greater the tyre pressure, the deeper the potential compaction\n\nReduce the pressure on the ground with larger tyres and lower inflation pressures to spread the weight over a \nlarger area\n\nConsider established wheelings or reduced traffic systems\n\nAvoid overusing entrances; use a separate exit if possible\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe amount of land in organic farming production has increased for the first time in more than six years, \ngovernment figures show.\n\nThe statistics issued by Defra reveal the UK\u2019s organic land area rose by almost 2% in 2017 to 517,400ha.\n\nThat figure includes 32,600ha of land that is in conversion from conventional production.\n\nIt is in this category where the overall area increase has been driven. Between 2016 and 2017 the conversion area \nincreased by 29.4% or 7,400ha to a total of 32,600ha.\n\nSee also: UK organic food sales hit record levels\n\nOverall the figures show the organic sector is dominated by livestock and mixed farms, with almost two-thirds (64%) \nof the area classified as grassland.\n\nUK organic farming\n\nLand area - 517,000ha farmed organically\n\nLand use - livestock accounts for 64% of organic land\n\nLivestock - 2.7% of the UK's total is produced organically\n\nCrops - just 7% of organic area is used for cereals\n\n\n\nOrganic sheep production increased by 5.5% to 887,000 head, while the UK\u2019s organic pig herd jumped by 86.9% \nfrom 31,000 to almost 59,000 head in 12 months to the end of 2017.\n\nHowever, cattle numbers dropped by 7.4%, down from close to 295,000 to 275,000 head over the same period.\n\nThe proportion of land under organic cereal production also fell. Defra\u2019s figures showed 7% of UK organic land was \nused to grow cereals in 2017, a decline of 2.6% to 37,400ha.\n\nBut this figure is expected to return to its pre-2016 level over the next 12 months, with 2,000ha currently under \nconversion from conventionally farmed systems.\n\nMore arable needed\n\nOrganic farming bodies welcomed the overall picture \u2013 especially the increase in land under conversion.\n\nBut they called for more arable farmers to join the sector and help meet growing demand.\n\nOrganic Farmers and Growers (OF&G) chief executive Roger Kerr said: \u201cMore shoppers than ever are looking to \nbuy organic food, and with figures showing a 29.4% increase in UK land currently under organic conversion, it \nsuggests more land will become fully organic in the coming years, which is hugely positive for the sector.\u201d\n\nAlthough the in-conversion cereal area figures indicate a recovery to 2016 organic production levels, Mr Kerr urged \nmore growers to join the sector.\n\nDemand for organic arable products outstripped supply and more growers were needed to boost home-grown \nproduction and substitute imports, he said.\n\n\u201cBy importing organic cereals we are effectively exporting biological diversity and not providing British organic \nbrands with enough home-grown organic crops.\n\n\u201cThis and other details where the market is not sufficiently supporting UK organic food production can be helped by \nfurther government support to help develop this vital part of the UK farming landscape,\u201d Mr Kerr said.\n\nFeed shortage\n\nOrganic trade body the Soil Association also urged a bigger take-up in the arable sector.\n\nThe organisation said it was concerned about a shortage of production in the arable sector - in particular for animal \nfeed.\n\n\u201cAs the UK organic food market continues to grow \u2013 with meat, fish and poultry sales up 4.1% in 2017 \u2013 so too does \nthe demand for organic animal feed,\u201d a Soil Association statement said.\n\n\u201cOur recent Organic Arable report, released last month, reveals that demand for UK-grown organic feed currently \nsignificantly outstrips supply, presenting large opportunities for arable farmers considering organic conversion.\u201d\n\nThe organisation\u2019s chief executive, Martin Sawyer, added that while the sector had demonstrated market growth, \nmore support was needed to help British farmers meet demand.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nOilseed rape growers could suffer substantial losses after a study revealed an important source of genetic \nresistance against phoma stem canker is becoming less effective.\n\nResearchers from the University of Hertfordshire have declared that host resistant gene Rlm7 has become less \nsuccessful in controlling the stem canker pathogen, Leptosphaeria maculans.\n\n\n\nPhoma, the second most common disease to affect oilseed rape crops after light leaf spot, can causes losses of \nmore than \u00a395m/year to UK farmers.\n\nSee also: 6 varieties added to sugar beet Recommended List\n\nGrowers rely on varieties that have good resistance against the pathogen causing phoma, after some effective \nfungicides for treating the disease have been withdrawn.\n\nThe disease is caused by two closely related fungal pathogens, Leptosphaeria maculans and Leptosphaeria \nbiglobosa, with Rlm7 the most dominant gene which is used to give oilseed rape varieties resistance.\n\nGeorgia Mitrousia, lead author of the study, which was published in Plant Pathology, believes it is important \ngrowers take note of this latest development.\n\n\u201cThis study acts as a warning to the oilseed rape industry and they will hopefully develop strategies to prevent the \nloss of commercially available cultivars,\u201d Dr Mitrousia said.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nGrassland values in England are continuing to climb in a trend that has lasted for nearly a decade.\n\nAnalysis from Strutt & Parker\u2019s Farmland Database shows the average price paid in 2017 was \u00a37,500/acre but \nsales in the first quarter of 2018 \u2013 albeit from a small number of transactions \u2013 are close to \u00a38,500/acre.\n\nIf the strong performance continues, it will be the ninth consecutive year in which average grassland values have \nrisen.\n\nSee also: The land market in your area: West Midlands\n\nHeadline figures mask some regional variation \u2013 more sales at higher price bands are being seen in the South East, \nWest Midlands and South West.

breeding has helped more than halve assisted calvings from \n20% of the total to 9% and cut calf losses from 8.6% to 3% at Launceston Farm, Tarrant Launceston.\n\nThe farm team\u2019s decision to adopt the practice of assessing heifer pelvic size before service \u2013 which is common in \nthe US and New Zealand \u2013 was taken in 2016 when calving figures came under the spotlight as part of Damory \nVet\u2019s Beef Discussion Group.\n\nTheir data showed that most of the calf losses in their 270-cow organic suckler herd occurred in heifers, with many \nas a result of a protracted or difficult calving.\n\nSee also: Pelvic measuring puts spotlight on calving ease EBV\n\nAs a result, heifer pelvic measurements and weights are now taken in advance of breeding and used as selection \ncriteria when choosing replacements.\n\nThe impact has been marked in this year\u2019s spring calving heifers, with fewer needing assistance or losing calves.\n\n \n\n\n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var

of Damory Vets believes calf losses as a result of heifers experiencing a difficult or protracted \ncalving are to blame for sub-optimal performance on many beef farms.\n\nThis could be one of the reasons that QMS data shows the average farm is achieving about 87% of calves finished \nper 100 cows and heifers put to the bull, versus a target of 94%.\n\nMr Burge explains: \u201cWhen you look at the data from most of our farms, when you add up the number of stillborn \ncalves, calves that die within 24 hours of birth, and the number of animals needing calving assistance or caesarean, \nthe majority of these are heifers.\n\n\u201cAnd the vast majority of the time, most are from heifers that were underweight at service or with bad pelvises.\u201d\n\n \n\nAs a result, Mr Burge urges farmers to record and identify when calving problems are occurring. If most of the \nissues are in heifers, actions can then be taken.\n\nPelvic measurements are a reliable way to identify animals that have small pelvises that could lead to calving \ndifficulties (see panel \"Pelvic measurements \u2013 how they are carried out\").\n\nDid you know?\n\nOne in 20 animals have small pelvises which can cause calving problems\n\nFrom his experiences of pelvic measuring, Mr Burge says about one in 20 animals can be expected to have small \npelvises, which are likely to cause calving problems.\n\nThese animals should be culled. Two or three in 20 will have marginal pelvises.\n\nThese should ideally not be bred or bred to an easy calving bull.\n\nWeighing also forms a vital component of pre-breeding assessment, because sub-optimal heifer size will negatively \naffect conception rates.\n\nBreeding at Launceston Farm\n\nAt Launceston Farm, farmer Jimi Collis has always weighed heifers as a means of assessing whether animals are \nready for service at 15 months to calve at 24 months.\n\nHowever, due to herd expansion over the past four years, some animals under the optimum 65% of adult weight at \nservice may have been put to the bull.\n\nThis was leading to higher barren rates, which were also affected by delayed leptospirosis vaccination in 2016.\n\nHaving now reached optimum herd size, Mr Collis and herd manager Pete Barrett are being more selective with the \nheifers they put to the bull, based on pelvic measurements and weights.\n\nFarm Facts\n\n270 suckler cows\n\n\n180 spring block calving, 90 autumn block calving\n\nAberdeen Angus base crossed to Limousin and some Simmental. Now introducing Stabiliser genetics to improve \nmaternal traits\n\nAlways select bulls within the top 5% for calving ease\n\nHeifers must now be over 360-380kg at service, depending on breed, and with a good pelvis.\n\nWhen a group of 33 spring-born heifers were assessed at the end of May, about half were under the optimum \nservice weight, two were freemartins and three were advised to be culled due to marginal pelvises.\n\nA higher number of heifers than needed will always be initially inspected, with the aim of breeding enough to meet a \n10% replacement rate.\n\nThe high proportion of small heifers this year is a result of a poor out-wintering turnip crop, coupled with the Beast \nfrom the East.\n\nThe heifers that fell out of spec will now be fattened and sold.\n\nRetaining all heifers for breeding\n\nOn farms that need to retain all heifers for breeding, Mr Burge advises planning in advance to ensure animals meet \ngrowth targets.\n\nThis could include splitting heifers off soon after weaning so they can be preferentially fed to achieve bulling weight.\n\nOverall, Mr Barrett is in favour of being more selective in breeding decisions as he believes it helps labour, welfare \nand costs.\n\nHe adds: \u201cEvery farmer needs to be seen to be doing everything properly. It\u2019s another tool to show Joe Public we\u2019re \ndoing everything to the best of our ability.\u201d\n\nBenefits of pelvic scoring and weighing\n\nThe benefits are clear to see in the herd\u2019s figures.\n\nSince pelvic scoring and weighing, the number of assisted heifer calvings in the spring block has reduced from 21% \nin 2017 to 9%.\n\nThe remaining 9% were due to factors unrelated to heifer size, such as the calf being breached or twins.\n\nOnly serving heifers at the correct weight and adhering to vaccine timings has also led to 9% fewer barren heifers.\n\nMr Collis adds: \u201cWe want to be efficient and if we can do that by measuring things not seen to the naked eye, then \nall the better. It\u2019s so noticeable how much easier they calved. Not just how they calved, but how quickly they \ncalved.\"\n\nPelvic measurements \u2013 how they are carried out\n\nPelvic measurements should form part of pre-breeding checks, carried out by a vet ideally a few weeks prior to \nservice.\n\nWeight and heifer age in months are needed for accurate results\n\nA sliding caliper device is inserted into the rectum\n\n\n\nThe width and height of the pelvis are measured and multiplied together to give the pelvic cross-sectional area\n\nPelvic area alone is not enough to determine if calving problems will occur.

But the Langfords believe the show ring was hindering genetic progress.\n\n\u201cI am not anti-showing, but I found it difficult to meet show requirements and maintain on-farm functionality,\u201d \nexplains Mr Langford.\n\n\u201cPedigree showing was a great way to get to know people and I enjoyed it, but eight years ago I stopped and since \nthen the maternal progress of the flock has been more consistent.\u201d\n\nMr Langford believes that concentrate feeding and breeding for larger heads and wider shoulders for the show ring \nis irrelevant for the commercial sector. Instead, he is focusing on reducing intervention at lambing and producing \nparts of the carcase that the market wants.\n\n\u201cThere is little money in a shoulder joint,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd the market for very large legs of lamb has gone, so a \nlonger, more balanced conformation is preferred.\u201d\n\nSince ceasing showing, the flock has grown a reputation among commercial, early lambing flocks, with six regular \ncustomers across the region all targeting the early-lambing market.\n\nHigh-index performance-recorded rams are bought and sold through the Centurion Group of Breeders, a discussion \ngroup and sire reference scheme, which Mr Langford helps co-ordinate. \n\nBreeding programme\n\nTeaser rams are put in at the end of March for 14 days, before ewes spend 35 days with the ram in five tupping \ngroups at 20-30 ewes per ram. This usually sees 80-90% tupped in the first cycle.\n\nAfter shearing and scanning in late June, any empty ewes (8-10%) go with rams again in July to lamb in November, \nalthough their progeny is then only kept for meat production.\n\nSeptember lambers usually scan at 150-160% with a 175-180% lambing overall and 3-4% empty rate.\n\nTups are matched to females to improve traits like litter size, fat depth and muscle depth. Fat depth is currently a \nlittle low and rams are being matched to improve that trait, says Mr Langford. Two ram lambs are usually retained \nfor use, as lambs, each year.\n\n\u201cI do not breed my ewe lambs as it brings huge management involvement and I want to choose my replacement \newes as shearlings,\u201d he explains.\n\nSheep are culled according to milking ability, udders, lameness (third intervention) and fertility. Lameness is \nmanaged by keeping scald at bay, liming the floor when sheep are worked and treating cases with an alamycin \ninjection in the foot, and a modern view is taken not to routinely trim feet.\n\nBenefits of recording\n\nAs well as weight-gain improvements worth \u00a35 a lamb, Mr Langford\u2019s Signet figures show a 10% increase in female \nprolificacy since 2004. \n\nEwes are also milkier, producing 1.4kg more milk since 2003. Meanwhile, birthweights have become more \nconsistent at around the 4-4.5kg mark, whereas during the show years weights of up to 9kg were not uncommon. \n\nMr Langford explains he was focused on figures from the outset of establishing the flock.\n\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t manage what you don\u2019t measure,\u201d he says. \u201cI will look at a ram\u2019s index before I look at phenotypic \ncharacteristics, like appearance or shape of the animal. I think most farmers tend to do it the other way around.\u201d\n\n2018 Signet evaluation\n\n \n\nTerminal index\n\nMaternal index\n\nBreed average\n\n280\n\n237\n\nBlackdown flock\n\n375\n\n296\n\nManagement overview\n\nGrassland management\n\nFields are small (2-3ha) and rotationally grazed. No fertiliser is used. Instead fields are spot-sprayed only.\n\nMost fields are very old swards that are being slowly improved by drilling with spring barley for a local dairy farm, \nfollowing with a grass mix of festuloliums (ryegrass/fescue), trefoils, sheep parsley, cocksfoot, timothy, plantain and \nburnet.\n\nConcentrate feeding\n\nNo breeding stock receive anything other than forage when growing. Prime lambs are built up to 0.5kg a head/day \npost-weaning on a 18% crude protein starter nut.\n\nA breeding ewe nut is fed to breeding ewes in late gestation at 0.4-0.5kg a head/day to help colostrum production.\n\nHealth plan\n\nFlooring is limed and stock are footbathed with zinc sulphate every time sheep are worked (3-4 times/year). All \npastures are rested for 14 days to allow the scald (fusobacterium necrophorum) to die.\n\nNo abortion vaccine is currently used, only a clostridia vaccine. Antibiotics use is restricted to lameness cases \n(alamycin) and 1-2 joint-ill cases a year are treated with a long-acting antibiotic. \n\nLambing\n\nLate summer, outdoor lambing minimises intervention and antibiotics. Only 3-4% of sheep require lambing \nassistance as average birthweights for twins are 4-4.5kg with a lamb mortality figure of typically about 5%. \n\nOnce lambed, ewes are brought inside for 24-36 hours and lambs are tagged and tailed.

However, a combination of plants closing for essential \nmaintenance works and other plants shutting down because of unexpected technical failures has led to a huge \nshortfall in stocks of the gas across the continent.\n\nFarmers Weekly understands that several gas companies have said they have been unable to fulfil contracts, but \nthe situation is mixed, with some abattoirs saying they still have three to four weeks supply.\n\nHow could pig production be affected?\n\nAbout half of the pigs in the UK are slaughtered using carbon dioxide. However, the vast majority of abattoirs have \ncontingency plans enabling them to switch to secondary methods of slaughter.\n\nThe situation is disruptive but not disastrous, according to pig industry consultant Peter Crichton.\n\n\u201cMost abattoirs using this method are still able to kill, but the kill rate is slower in places,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe majority [of abattoirs] have safeguards in place and have a plan B, having retained older systems as a back-\nup.\u201d\n\nMr Crichton recommended that pig producers should not sit on animals and should sell now if possible.\n\nIndustry has been working closely with the government to manage CO2 stocks, and veterinary adviser Dr Craig \nKirby, of the Association of Independent Meat Suppliers, stressed that this was not a situation that would imminently \nlead to empty shelves.  \n\n\u201cThe best advice for producers is to keep in touch with factories and make sure that everything is scheduled and \noperating normally,\u201d he said.\n\nThe cross-industry group, including the British Poultry Council (BPC), National Pig Association (NPA), British Retail \nConsortium (BRC) and Defra, would be holding a conference call on Monday to assess the situation.\n\nHow could poultry be affected?\n\nAs with pigs, carbon dioxide is widely used in the slaughter of chickens and also in the packaging of the meat, with \nbetween 60% and 70% of chickens that enter the food chain slaughtered using the gas.\n\nRichard Griffith, chief executive of the British Poultry Council, said production levels on slaughter lines had not been \naffected yet, but abattoirs were \u201cliving hand to mouth\u201d on desperately short supplies.\n\nHe said there could be no guarantee that slaughter levels could be maintained at full output beyond the weekend.\n\nThe BPC was still hopeful that a crisis could be averted.\n\nMr Griffith's advice for all poultry farmers is to keep closely in touch with their supply chain for updates on the \nsituation and to proceed as normal for the time being.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nPotentially lethal asbestos cement roofing has been found dumped at the entrance of a farm in Kent.\n\n\n\nThe toxic material has been fly-tipped outside a farm gate in Haymans Hill, Horsmonden, amid a \u201cspate of fly-\ntipping incidents\u201d involving industrial waste in the area, say councillors.\n\nOn this occasion, because the fly-tipped waste was dumped mostly on the public highway, it is the council\u2019s \nresponsibility to remove it \u2013 not the private landowner.\n\nSee also: Revealed \u2013 the burden of fly-tipping on farms\n\nJane March, a Conservative councillor for Brenchley and Horsmonden, said: \u201cThe asbestos sheets were probably \ntipped off a small tipper lorry on Friday 25 May.\n\n\u201cThe load was tipped onto the highway blocking access to two gates. It appears that whoever dumped it deliberately \nchose a steep hill, tipped it and then quickly escaped.\n\n\u201cTunbridge Wells Borough Council has put barriers around it ahead of organising asbestos removal.\u201d \n\nCllr March, who also farms locally, said the pile of rubbish is still in place as it needs specialist licensed council \ncontractors to remove it.\n\n\u201cCars can get around it, but they are degrading the grass verge and hedgerows,\u201d she added.\n\n'A regular occurrence'\n\nLucy Noakes, clerk to Horsmonden Parish Council, added: \u201cThe asbestos waste was dumped on the edge of the \nroad in front of the farm gate.

for oilseed rape and the most suitable technique will depend on \nsoil type, soil conditions, prevailing weather and likely weed and slug pressures.\n\nAs well as selecting a method that suits soil conditions and availability of machinery, costs can influence choice.\n\nIn recent years, low-cost, one-pass establishment systems have become popular, even though any potential \nsavings can be lost if establishment is patchy or the crop fails.\n\nSee also: Why strip-till is key part of one farmer\u2019s cultivations approach\n\nOilseed rape and soil compaction are not a good combination, which is why establishment systems that include a \ndeep loosening leg are in demand \u2013 whether that\u2019s done as a separate pass or is part of the drill being used.\n\nEither way, in dry conditions seed should be sown as soon as possible after cultivations to minimise soil moisture \nloss and ensure that the seed germinates.\n\nRolling after sowing is advised in most situations, to retain moisture and reduce slug risk.\n\nWith techniques where crop residues are being retained, a straw rake may be required to uniformly spread the \nresidue.\n\nUneven distribution of large amounts of trash can be a problem \u2013 both with its effect on germination and its ability to \nharbour slugs.\n\nOtherwise, the aim of any cultivations prior to establishment is to:\n\nCorrect compaction\n\nMaximise seed-to-soil contact\n\nSow seed at 2-3cm depth\n\nRetain soil moisture\n\nLimit weed numbers\n\nReduce slug risk\n\nAutumn nitrogen, applied up to a maximum of 30kg/ha in Nitrate Vulnerable Zones, is often used to boost early crop \ngrowth, especially where minimal soil disturbance means that no mineralisation is taking place.\n\n1. Broadcasting\n\nBroadcasting is a quick and cheap option, as seed is spread into standing cereals, often via Autocast.\n\nIt can be a high-risk option, as it may cause poor and uneven establishment. The main threat is that chopped straw \nor trash is not distributed evenly, forming a dense mat, which can impede the seedlings.\n\nAs a result, slug damage can be higher than with other systems.\n\n\n\nIn addition, broadcasting does not allow the use of treated seed or pre-emergence herbicides, as the seed is not \ncovered.\n\nSeed rates tend to be higher than with other methods, to compensate for the variability in establishment achieved.\n\nHowever, it can be done when the ground is too wet to allow deep cultivations. There is very little soil moisture loss, \na benefit in dry years, and the long stubble left acts as a deterrent to pigeons. Broad-leaved weeds are unlikely to \nbe a problem.\n\n2. Direct drilling\n\nA less risky technique than broadcasting in most seasons, direct drilling can work well where there is little or no \nsurface tilth present and soils are well structured.\n\nA low-cost, one-pass technique, it minimises soil moisture loss and new drill technology allows accurate placement \nof seed and good slot closure. Fertiliser can be applied at the same time.\n\nAgain, uneven trash distribution can be a risk to good establishment, so a stubble rake may be necessary.\n\nWeed numbers tend to be reduced, due to minimal soil disturbance, so pre-emergence herbicides are often not \nrequired.\n\nThe use of companion crops is becoming increasingly popular with direct drilled crops, where they help to improve \nrooting, confuse pests and recycle nutrients.\n\nThe companion plants are either killed by winter frosts or taken out with a targeted herbicide.\n\n3. Strip tilling\n\nStrip tillage is a low-disturbance tillage practice where only a narrow band of soil is cultivated to produce tilth. The \nremaining soil is left undisturbed, with crop residues retained on the soil surface.\n\nA popular technique for establishing oilseed rape, strip tillage allows the seed to be placed accurately and most \nsystems have the facility to put a band of fertiliser underneath the seed.\n\nAnother one-pass system, it is quick and brings costs down. Drill technology has improved in recent years, \nincreasing the consistency and reliability of the system as well as allowing wide or conventionally-spaced rows.\n\nUneven crop residue distribution is a potential problem, both for establishment and pests. Leaving a longer stubble \ncan help to deter pigeons.\n\n4. Subcasting\n\nSubcasting places seed in soil disturbed by widely spaced tines, such as those on a subsoiler.\n\nIt works well in drier soil conditions and where there is compaction, but often runs into difficulties in wet soils due to \nslotting and poor drainage.\n\nIt allows seed to be placed into a prepared seed-bed at less than 5cm deep and can cope with crop residues, as the \nlegs are widely spaced.\n\nThe depth of the pass will depend on soil conditions. It is essential to roll afterwards and a broad-leaved weed \nherbicide is usually required.\n\n5. Non-inversion tillage\n\nNon-inversion tillage offers the greatest flexibility and deals with any surface compaction.\n\n\n\nIt is suitable for most soils and conditions and makes use of either disc or tined cultivators, often with a seeder unit \nattached.\n\nThis means it can be a single-pass operation or drilling can be done with a cultivator drill in a separate pass.\n\nWhichever way it is done, consolidation is important for good seed-to-soil contact.

Our \nthinking is that it\u2019s all down to the strength of the root.\u201d\n\nThere was very little difference between the Sumo and the Mzuri, he notes, although the Mzuri\u2019s 60cm-wide row \nspacing wasn\u2019t as good in terms of yield as 30cm-wide rows.\n\nMr Price adds that while the findings were of interest, he is wary of reading too much into them after just one year of \nresults.\n\n\u201cIn another season, things might have been different.

The Eimeria parasite is widespread and it is likely that most dairy and beef \ncalves will acquire infection at some point.\n\nThere are 13 different types of Eimeria species, but the three most harmful and pathogenic are Eimeria bovis, \nEimeria zuernil and Eimeria alabamensis. Each species of Eimeria is host-specific, with no cross-infection (cattle \ncannot infect sheep and vice versa).\n\nThe lifecycle of Eimeria is a complex one, with the parasite undergoing many cycles of multiplication, causing \nextensive gut damage in the process.\n\nThe calf ingests infective oocysts from their environment, usually shed from the faeces of an infected animal.\n\nOnce the oocysts are in the calf, they release cells called sporozoites, which enter the lining of the intestine and \nmultiply rapidly, until they develop into oocysts, which are then excreted back into the environment in the faeces.\n\nOne oocyst can give rise to many thousands more, taking between 16 and 21 days to achieve this.\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nThe development of disease in calves is dependent on many things, including parasite, host  and environmental \nfactors.\n\nCalves with clinical coccidiosis present with watery scours containing blood and mucous; often the calf is seen to \nstrain to pass the faeces and in severe cases, scour may contain strips of the intestinal mucosa.\n\nSubclinical coccidiosis is much more common, and occurs when the coccidial challenge is lower, or when the calf \nhas developed some immunity against the parasite.\n\nOften, the subclinical signs show as:\n\nreduced appetite\n\nweight loss\n\nreduction in growth rate\n\na dull appearance.\n\n\n\nEconomic losses from the subclinical signs within a group can be greater than if clinical signs are seen.\n\nCan it often be mistaken for other diseases?\n\nYes, as there are several causes of scour in calves. However, these mainly occur earlier than the three weeks \nwhen coccidiosis presents. The main diseases coccidiosis can be mistaken for include cryptosporidium, rotavirus, \ncoronavirus and salmonella.\n\nThe main symptoms of coccidiosis are subclinical signs such as not growing well and looking dull and \nmalnourished, so pneumonia and poor feeding could also be mistaken for the condition.\n\nHow can you get a correct diagnosis?\n\nA veterinary diagnosis is required, with the veterinary surgeon taking into account the farm history, clinical picture \nand risk factors.\n\nThe symptoms the calf shows are often enough to be suspicious of coccidiosis. However, to be certain that an \ninfection of coccidiosis is apparent, a faecal analysis is required from a number of calves in the affected group.\n\nThis diagnosis is based on the number of oocysts per gram in the faecal samples, and indicates which species of \ncoccidiosis are in the faeces; as not all species of the Eimeria cause disease in calves.\n\nCan it be treated and how?\n\nAll affected calves should immediately be removed from the suspected source of infection and if it\u2019s likely one calf is \naffected, the rest of the group might be too.\n\nIt\u2019s advisable that the whole group should be treated the same, as failure to do so could cause reinfection.\n\nProducts that contain the active ingredient decoquinate or toltrazuril are licensed products that can be used in the \ntreatment and prevention of coccidiosis.\n\nDecoquinate works early in the Eimeria lifecycle, destroying them during the infectious stages. Sadly, it is not as \neffective in calves that are already infected, so it is imperative to administer it before the onset of the risk period.\n\nToltrazuril will destroy the parasite in the later life stages when it\u2019s in the intestinal cells and helps to reduce pasture \ncontamination.\n\nTreatment is best given during the period between exposure and the onset of clinical signs, as this will allow \nimmunity to build up before excessive damage is done to the calf\u2019s gut lining.\n\nHow can you prevent it?\n\nStrategic treatment with an effective anti-coccidial is a good prevention, based normally on timing of suspected \nexposure and knowledge of any previous outbreaks on the farm.\n\nProducts containing the active ingredient diclazuril can be used as a preventative measure for calves.\n\nThe level of challenge depends on the level of oocysts that have built up in the environment. Therefore, good \nhygiene plays a major role in preventing and controlling coccidiosis.\n\nWater and feed troughs should be cleaned and emptied on a regular basis and all bedding kept clean and dry, with \nhay from contaminated pastures not fed to calves.\n\nAs with many calf diseases, good ventilation will help to reduce oocysts, as the build-up can be greater in warm and \nmoist areas.\n\n\n\nOlder cattle are a big risk factor for spreading infection to younger calves, so it is advisable to avoid mixing age \ngroups.\n\nFinally, overcrowding at pasture and when cattle are housed should also ideally be avoided, as this could lead to \nstress and increase the risk of further infection.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nRingworm is a very common and highly transmissible skin infection, passed between both cattle and humans.\n\nIt causes intense irritation and can affect growth rates and damage hides, but steps can be taken to prevent it.\n\nVet Keith Cutler of Endell Veterinary Group, Salisbury, Wiltshire, answers some key questions on the infection, \nexplaining what causes it, the symptoms and treatment.\n\nWhat is ringworm and what causes it?\n\nRingworm is a fungal skin disease caused most commonly by the spore forming fungi trichophyton verrucosum.\n\nWhat does it look like?\n\nCattle are the most commonly affected farm animal species. Affected animals usually have roughly circular areas of \nhair loss where the skin becomes slightly thickened, crusty and flaky and greyish in colour.\n\nThese areas are often seen on the face, around the eyes and over the shoulders, although all areas of the body, \nincluding the udder, can become affected and the areas affected can be extensive.\n\nSee also: Q&A: Everything you need to know about liver fluke in cattle\n\nCan it affect livestock performance?\n\nGenerally, the effect on performance is minimal, although affected areas are itchy and while animals are rubbing \nthey will not be eating, which will affect performance and cause additional damage to their hides.\n\nRather than its effect on performance, the presence of widespread and extensive ringworm lesions among groups \nof cattle is often suggestive of an already debilitated state.\n\nHow should it be treated?\n\nThe in-feed treatments that were available years ago no longer are. Topical fungicidal washes containing the active \ningredient enilconazole or similar are available.\n\nThese are effective, but only where they are applied and treating the whole animal is rare, so the disease often \nspreads to untreated areas of skin giving the appearance that the treatment may not be working.\n\nThe infection often resolves without treatment, due to the development of natural immunity and exposure to UV light \nfrom the sun after turnout, especially in less severe cases.\n\nDoes it take long to clear up?\n\nIf not treated, lesions can persist for a considerable period of time. Even if the causative fungus is treated and killed \nit will take several weeks, or perhaps months, for hair to regrow and the lesions to disappear.\n\nIs it infectious?\n\n\n\nYes, ringworm is infectious. The causative fungus produces spores which can spread from animal to animal where \nthere is direct contact; this is why the part of the face around the eyes, which often rubs similar areas on other \nanimals when eating from troughs, is commonly affected.\n\nSpores can also, however, be spread by indirect contact via fence posts and building partitions. Isolating affected \nanimals, therefore, often fails to prevent spread of the disease.\n\nIs it contagious to humans?\n\nYes, ringworm is contagious to humans, often causing an itchy, roughly circular patch of dry flaky skin with an \nexpanding red margin in areas where clothing may rub; under the cuffs or collar, for example.\n\nTreatment advice should be sought from your GP or local pharmacist, but often an anti-fungal cream, Canesten, \ncontaining fluconazole, will be recommended.\n\nIs there a vaccination available against ringworm?\n\nYes, a vaccine, called Bovilis Ringvac, is available to protect cattle against ringworm and to hasten recovery.\n\nTwo doses of vaccine, with dose volume dependent on the age of the animals being vaccinated, are required to be \ngiven by intramuscular injection with an interval of two weeks between them. Immunity is achieved by three weeks \nafter the second dose.\n\nHygiene is also important to reduce the challenge from infectious spores deposited by previously infected animals.\n\nPerhaps of greatest importance is to ensure the general wellbeing of your livestock and that they are well fed so \ntheir own innate immunity can act against any challenge.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nRapeseed prices will need to tick higher to encourage a bigger oilseed rape crop to be drilled this summer as \ngrowers watch their crops struggling in the current wet weather.\n\nWith a likely late oilseed rape harvest and wheat prices showing a rally towards \u00a3150/t and so becoming more \ncompetitive, the attractions of drilling rapeseed this summer will be tempered.\n\nRapeseed prices ex-harvest are currently trading at about \u00a3275/t ex-farm and, even with an oil bonus, prices will \nstruggle to break through the psychological barrier of \u00a3300/t.\n\nSee also: Oilseed rape growers urged to be on alert for stem rot disease\n\nOwen Cligg, trading manager at co-operative United Oilseeds, says growers\u2019 interest in the crop tends to fade if \nprices before oil bonuses are below \u00a3300/t.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get a price rally or see yields up at harvest, then it is difficult to see the area showing a big increase this \nsummer,\u201d he tells Farmers Weekly.\n\nThe oilseed rape area is estimated to have risen to 600,000ha this season from a Defra figure of 554,000ha last \nyear, which represented its first rise after five years of falls and down from a record crop area of 756,00ha at \nharvest 2012.\n\nMr Cligg is pencilling in an average yield of 3.5t/ha from this year\u2019s harvest to give a crop of 2.1m tonnes, down \nfrom harvest 2017 when a 3.9t/ha yield from a smaller area gave a crop of 2.2m tonnes.\n\nLate harvest\n\n\n\nGeoff Hall, commercial lead for north-west Europe at rapeseed breeder Monsanto, estimates that this year\u2019s \nharvest could be around one week later than normal after wet and cold weather this spring.\n\nHe believes the area will be little changed his summer, with any movement largely due to conditions at planting. \nThe breeder controls about a third of the UK oilseed rape seed market with varieties such as Extrovert and Exalte.\n\n\u201cThe weather and soil conditions at drilling will be critical, but the area in some parts of Europe, such as northern \nGermany, are down, which may encourage more plantings here,\u201d he says.\n\nOne area of expansion could be in Clearfield varieties, which are bred conventionally with tolerance to the herbicide \nimazamox, which has good activity against brassica weeds such as charlock and runch.\n\nThese varieties are particularly useful where brassica weeds are a problem, and the high erucic acid content of the \nweed seed can lead to rapeseed loads being rejected.\n\nMr Hall expects the Clearfield area to rise from 60,000ha to 80,000ha or even as much as 100,000ha this season. \nHis group markets Clearfield varieties Imperial, Impression and Impressario.\n\nOpportunist growers\n\nBarry Barker, national arable seed product manager at agronomy group Agrii, says that about 5-10% of the \nrapeseed area is down to opportunist growers who drill more rapeseed if conditions at the time are favourable.\n\n\u201cThe overall area could be as big as this year but not any bigger, and will probably be 90-100% of this year\u2019s crop, \ndepending on conditions at drilling,\u201d he says.\n\nMr Barker adds the top varieties are set to be dominated by the hybrids Exalte, Extrovert and Alizze, and \nconventional varieties Elgar and Campus, with the Clearfield variety Imperial also set to be a good seller.\n\nHe expects Clearfield varieties could do well and take a 15% share of the market as growers worry about rapeseed \nloads being rejected for higher erucic acid content, especially as standards are being tightened up.\n\nThe European Union is reducing the food standard for rapeseed to a maximum 2% erucic acid from 5% previously, \nwhich could be implemented as early as this autumn, and Britain is likely to follow suit even after Brexit.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nPig and poultry units typically account for less than 0.5% of the total farmland sold across Britain each year. \n\nThe market is usually dominated by sales of grassland and arable farms, but three recent West Country launches \nhave thrown up some rare examples.\n\nTwo free-range egg units and a pig farm have just hit the market across Somerset, Devon and Cornwall.\n\nSee also: Grassland values in England continue to climb\n\nIn the past three years just 11 pig and poultry farms have been publicly advertised, according to Savills.\n\nThe firm\u2019s director David Cross says they are often sold because their size has become uneconomical without \nexpansion or reinvestment.\n\nHowever, he adds that sales of such farms retain a significant amount of value and attract good levels of interest.\n\n\u201cOne of the main drivers for interest is the established use because getting fresh planning consent for intensive \nlivestock is becoming increasingly difficult,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\u201cSome are bought to knock down the existing buildings and rebuild bigger sheds \u2013 but that\u2019s expensive \u2013 while \nothers may be considered for change of use.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always demand because they\u2019re few and far between.\u201d\n\nOne egg laying unit is being sold by Richard Nancekivell, partner at DJ&P Newland Rennie, who says he has sold \nonly two others in the past 20 years.  \n\nHe agrees that securing planning permission is challenging and the expansion process is expensive.\n\n\u201cAlongside the planning issue there is the upfront cost to invest in a free-range unit, which can be considerable.\n\n\u201cTo start from scratch is an investment for 20 years or more, which for many farmers isn\u2019t attractive. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why farms like this don\u2019t come on the market regularly,\u201d he says.\n\nNew to market\n\nGlenwood Farm at Okehampton was a high-yielding dairy unit before the owner spent more than \u00a3200,000 on \nbuildings and equipment to move into free-range eggs in 2005.\n\nHe is now retiring and has put the 88-acre unit up for sale with DJ&P Newland Rennie at a guide price of \u00a31.1m as \na whole, or in four lots.\n\nA large, clear span building currently houses about 12,000 laying hens, which range over 34 acres, with the balance \nput to grass with a small amount of woodland.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s phoenixed the farm from not making a living from dairy to being able to sustain a family from 12,000 hens,\u201d Mr \nNancekivell says.\n\nAcross the Devon-Cornwall border Stags also has a 12,000-bird laying farm at Boyton near Launceston.\n\nDunns Farm has 71 acres of Grade 3 pasture, which is used as the hens\u2019 range and for sheep grazing.\n\nAlongside the automated poultry shed, which operates a flat deck housing system, there is a range of modern \nversatile buildings currently used for lambing.\n\nThere is a six-bedroom farmhouse included in the sale, which is guided at \u00a31.5m as a whole but could be sold in up \nto five lots.\n\nStags also has a 117-acre unit in Somerset for sale with housing for up to 4,000 pigs, with a guide price of \u00a31.75m.\n\nTremlett Farm near Wellington puts Grade 1 and Grade 3 soils to combinable crops alongside the livestock \nenterprise.\n\nHousing spans more than 41,000 sq ft and offers a variety of facilities for weaners through to finishers.\n\nThere are two houses \u2013 a modernised three-bedroom farmhouse and a bungalow let on a secure tenancy.\n\nStags farm agent George Alder said it was rare to sell a pig farm in Somerset, particularly one that was ready to \nmove into and start farming straight away.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nSheep mortality hit its highest level for five years and possibly since records began in 2011, according to data from \nthe National Fallen Stock Company

since 2013, and probably \never, even factoring in a large allowance for the shortcomings of the data,\u201d according to NFSCo chairman, Michael \nSeals.\n\n\u201cLambing time was an extremely

seen in years.\u201d\n\nThis spring\u2019s adverse weather kicked in on 23 February when the \u201cBeast from the East\u201d rendered many areas of the \ncountry inaccessible due to strong winds and snow drifts.\n\nCold and rainy weather continued throughout what became the wettest recorded March for a decade.  \n\nDeserved respite for sheep farmers\n\n\u201cThe beautiful weather we are

\nAssociation chief executive Phil Stocker.\n\nMr Stocker commended the work of NFSCo and its contractors in the face of the alarming losses and significantly \nhigher costs placed on our sheep farming businesses.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the current strong finished lamb prices, sheep farmers would be desperate and there will be many \nindividuals that have not benefited directly and are not out of the woods yet,\u201d added Mr Stocker.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFarmers looking to secure fuel ahead of the harvest season are being warned to monitor rising diesel prices \nfollowing increasing tensions in the Middle East.\n\nThe cost of diesel has jumped by up to 2.5p/litre in a week after President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the US \nfrom an agreement to ease economic sanctions on Iran caused global oil prices to rise sharply.\n\nThe decision to force Iran, which can produce up to 2.5m barrels per day, about 3% of world demand, to keep its oil \nin the ground is the latest in a line of factors which have seen the price of Brent crude rise by 50% on the year.\n\n\nSee also: Min-till system overhaul slashes diesel and slug pellet use\n\nThese include longer term issues such rises caused by the post-Brexit currency devaluation as well as short-term \nfactors such as the Beast from the East in March, which caused prices to spike in March as demand increased for \nheating fuel.\n\nBy comparison, red diesel was costing as little as 35p/litre in December 2015.\n\nThe latest moves come as many farmers are looking to secure supplies ahead of the harvest season but \nmerchants are cautious about advising forward buying more than 50% of the volume needed in case prices come \nback down.\n\nDebbie Kay, sales office manager at northern fuel supplier Rix Petroleum, said the price of 2,300 litre of red diesel \nwas 59.95p/litre (16 May), a rise of 2.5p on the week and 6p in the last month.\n\nShe said farmers looking to forward book fuel would need to commit to 30,000 litre, with the price locked at the day \nof ordering.\n\nThe fuel could then be delivered according to the customer\u2019s needs, with a delivery charge based on the volume \nthey could take at each visit.\n\nShe advised buyers to stay in regular contact to keep up-to-date with price changes as there were signals that \nprices could fall slightly in the next few days.\n\n \n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var

LPG co-ordinator Linda Carter said she had been taking an increased number of calls in recent \ndays from farmers shopping around for prices.\n\nShe warned that the price of red diesel, as well as other fuels such as kerosene, were likely to continue to rise if \nuncertainty in the Middle East continued to concern traders.\n\nKerosene and red diesel prices normally follow each other, she explained, with kerosene typically 10p/litre cheaper \nthan red diesel despite it being a more refined fuel.\n\nPrices for a 5,000 litre delivery of red diesel to Norfolk were 59.45 at the time of going to press, up from 51.89p on 5 \nMarch, with the next price reduction available for customers buying 10,000 litre or more.\n\nShe advised farmers looking to forward buy fuel for the harvest season to hedge their bets by not committing to \nmore than half of their requirements in the price falls.\n\nMeasuring fuel usage vital to analysing costs accurately\n\nMonitoring fuel usage per operation has allowed one farmer to improve the accuracy of his enterprise costings.\n\nAndrew Ward, of Glebe Farm in Lincolnshire, says fuel accounts for the biggest proportion of tractor running costs, \nsomething the vast majority of farmers don\u2019t realise.\n\nIt makes up 42% of the total running costs of his Case Quadtrac, outstripping even depreciation.\n\n\nHe has his machinery operators record how much fuel a tractor is carrying as it enters and exits the field, the \nnumber of machine hours, and what job is being done.\n\nThis also allows him to apportion costs to each implement rather than just the tractor and make a more accurate \nassessment of whether each visit to a field is cost effective.\n\n\u201cIt gives operators a real interest in the job by making them feel part of the business,\u201d explains Mr Ward, saying that \nthey are always trying to improve their figures compared with the previous visit.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nDairy farmers have been urged to move towards remote fault analysis for high-tech milking equipment in a bid to \nreduce costly downtimes in modern parlours.\n\nSpeaking at a Milking Equipment Association conference in Birmingham dairy technology specialist Ian Ohnstad \nsaid breakdowns were increasingly costly as herd sizes continued to increase.\n\n\u201cThe average UK herd size is now over 140 cows so breakdowns have greater financial implications as well as \ncausing significant disruption to daily routines,\u201d Mr Ohnstad from The Dairy Group, told delegates.\n\nSee also: Dorset dairy farmers build

Mr Ohnstad stressed.\n\nBut technicians would need to have access to milking information, parlour and component performance \u2013 to \nanalyse, diagnose and resolve problems, without a physical visit.\n\nAct on data\n\nSo the process needed farmers to embrace a mindset that analysed and acted on the data produced by modern \ntechnology, said Mr Ohnstad.\n\nHe also said scheduled annual dynamic tests were undervalued in the UK but could help make parlours more \nefficient by identifying issues before they became problems. \n\nThe implications of a poorly operated machine are significant. Teat damage has health and welfare implications, \ncan affect milk quality and also increase mastitis incidence, Mr Ohnstad warned.\n\nUnderlying problems can affect parlour running costs, which vary hugely between farms.\n\n\n\n\u201cRunning costs range from 0.1p/litre to 0.87p/litre according to Kingshay data and farmers could make noticeable \nsavings by simply improving the efficiencies of their parlour,\u201d he added.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nDiscount retailer Aldi has retained its title as the best UK supermarket for its treatment of suppliers, according to a \nsurvey by the

been \ndelayed.\n\nThe \u201cuplift\u201d money was allocated by the EU because of Scotland's low payment rate per hectare \u2013 to bring it up to \nthe EU average payment level.\n\nHowever, rather than the money being distributed to Scottish farmers, some \u00a3160m was paid by the Treasury to \nfarmers in the rest of the UK.\n\nSee also: Scottish hill farmers denied CAP money, says Ewing\n\nThe Scottish government argues all the money should have gone to Scotland.\n\nTo date, the UK government has only allocated about \u00a330m to Scotland, it says, with the rest being distributed \nacross the UK.\n\nScottish rural cabinet secretary Fergus Ewing said: \u201cThis delay is completely unacceptable.\n\n\u201cScottish hill farmers are owed \u00a3160m, which the UK government has repeatedly ignored.\n\n\u201cI have been clear throughout that the money was earned in Scotland, and quite frankly should be returned to \nScotland.\"\n\nPrecedent\n\nMr Ewing said Scotland's demand for the money was about setting a precedent for future agricultural funding rather \nthan being against farmers in other parts of the UK.\n\nThe lack of progress was disappointing, particularly at a time when the Scottish government was preparing to enter \n\u201ccomplex and critical\u201d future funding discussions with the UK government, he said.\n\n\u201cHaving already secured the review and agreed its independent chairman, it is disappointing to learn the review is \nbeing kicked into the long grass.\u201d\n\nIn discussion\n\nDefra says it is in discussion with HM Treasury about the situation.\n\nIt says the review must be considered alongside wider funding implications in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland \nas the UK leaves the EU.\n\nThe government has pledged to ensure that all parts of the UK are treated fairly and their circumstances taken into \naccount.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nStrengthening dairy markets mean producer milk prices could hit the 30p/litre milestone in the next three months, as \nwholesale butter and cream prices continue to soar.\n\n\n\nMost UK dairy farmers will get at least 28p/litre in July, the highest price for the month since 2014, driven by \nrestrained supply off the back of prolonged wet weather, rendering the spring flush almost non-existent across \nmuch of Europe.\n\nSee also: Focus on fertility and forage lifts dairy cow performance\n\nWhere is the price heading?\n\nPrices for August and September should increase by up to 2p/litre across the two months for those on liquid milk \ncontracts and more for those producing cheese, according to dairy market analyst Chris Walkland, as long as \nmarkets maintain current momentum.\n\n\u201cThe outlook is very good for the next few months - a finely balanced very good, mind,\u201d says Mr Walkland.\n\nHowever, he adds that producers should remain cautious should the price exceed the 30p/litre mark.\n\n\u201cIf it does [go beyond 30p], don\u2019t go mad and up your volume because before you know it, your price will be down at \n26p/litre again.\n\nChris Walkland: Four factors affecting milk prices to August\n\nUK volumes \u2013 Volumes are very weather-dependent this year. Right now, it\u2019s a mixed picture, with some great \nweather and good first and second cuts. However, some parts are on a knife edge because of the dry weather.\n\nEuropean volumes \u2013 They\u2019re ramping up in France and Germany now; with political meddling over EU SMP \nintervention stocks and in the UK over milk supply contracts presenting potentially the biggest challenge since \nderegulation.\n\nRecruitment \u2013 A couple of years ago no buyers wanted you. Now, in many milk fields, the processors are all loved \nup again. They want you and your milk.\n\nPolitical pressure \u2013 Producers need to make a case for farming. They might not get anywhere, but it\u2019s definitely \nworth a try.  \n\n\u201cWhat you want is a long-term stable, high price, not the maximum price,\u201d says Mr Walkland.\n\nFurther milk price increases would mean breaking through the 28p/litre barrier, which Mr Walkland says has \nbecome a glass ceiling for retailers.\n\n\u201cI think the retailers have it in their minds from the downturn that 28p is a fair milk price, because back then they \nwere told that 28p should be \u201cthe fair milk price,\u201d and they agreed,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean the processors won\u2019t pay more than that, because they are still getting a good income from \ncream. If a producer is not making money at current prices, then they need to be in something other than milk,\" \nsays Mr Walkland. \n\nJohn Allen: Benchmarking can make 5p/litre savings\n\nKite Consulting's John Allen is currently running the R500 benchmarking programme for 400 Arla producers. The \nprocess can save money and improve wellbeing, he says. \n\nAdopt the \"Brailsford approach\", achieving small incremental results across several areas over two to three years.\n\nShare ideas with a group and emulate what works for the most successful producers.\n\n\n\nHave the confidence to ramp up output sustainably. Typically, the Arla groups increase output by 5-10% a year with \nlittle additional cost. This is where our producers get at least half of their improvement.\n\nThe aim is to put owners in control of their businesses, empowering them, which makes them mentally more \nresilient. What matters most is that they get to enjoy their business since they make money in good times and get \nthrough bad times without suffering.\n\nWholesale market performance \n\nWholesale markets have been buoyant in recent weeks, with UK wholesale cream and butter prices averaging 13% \nand 11% increases in May to \u00a32,350/t and \u00a35,180t, respectively \u2013 both one-fifth higher value than year-earlier \nlevels.\n\nRising butter prices have driven increases in the Actual Milk Price Equivalent (Ampe) dairy market indicator, which \nstood at 33.1p/litre for May, its highest level since September 2017.\n\nMilk for cheese value equivalent (MCVE), an indicator of cheese values to a processor before transport costs, hit \n32.3p/litre, its highest level for six months, due to strengthening values of mild cheddar and whey butter.\n\nMr Walkland says if there is anyone not making money at these prices now, then they need to do something else.\n\nIs now the time to spend?\n\nDairy consultants are urging farmers to take a longer-term view of prospective milk prices before getting the cheque \nbook out - farmgate prices have only exceeded 30p/litre in five of the past 36 months.\n\nThe key for producers is to have a clear idea of their financial position before spending, says Farm Consultancy \nGroup dairy business consultant Andy Dodd.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crucial to take a 12-month view of where cashflows are likely to be, rather than spending when the milk price is \nup,\u201d says Mr Dodd.\n\n\u201cNow is the time to examine variable costs such as feed, breeding and vet\u2019s bills. Producers should be reviewing \nthese costs twice a year and working with professionals to ensure they are getting the best price and best quality for \ntheir money.\u201d\n\nNow is also the ideal time to make sure stock numbers are optimised to fit individual systems, and excess heifers \nshould be put into beef to improve cashflow.\n\nIs now the time to switch buyer?\n\n\u201cWe are living in a volatile world, so it is important producers seek long-term stability where they can.\n\n\u201cMore and more milk buyers are looking to recruit, so it is crucial farmers do their research and check if moving \ncontracts would fit their current system.\u201d\n\nMr Dodd recommends not just examining the headline price for this month, but to look at a processor\u2019s long-term \nmilk price as well as how they deal with other producers.\n\n\u201cSpeak not just to one or two other suppliers, but six or seven, asking questions about how the processor \ncommunicates or deals with things like bonuses before making a final decision.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA nationwide series of roadshows highlighting the threat of scab in UK sheep flocks will take place later this \nsummer.\n\n\n\nThe roadshows will feature sheep disease specialists, consultants and dipping contractors and are open to farmers, \nvets and any suitably qualified persons (SQPs).\n\nSee also: Farmers Weekly academy on scab in sheep\n\nEach regional event will feature different speakers who are all experts in sheep scab control.\n\nSpeakers include:\n\nPeter Bates (specialist veterinary entomologist)\n\nLesley Stubbings (independent sheep consultant)\n\nNeil Fell (nationwide mobile plunge dipping contractor)\n\nThe speakers will discuss the sheep scab parasite, the effect of the disease and control options, including mobile \nplunge dipping.\n\nThere will also be an update on resistance to sheep scab treatments and a forum to share ideas on how to tackle \nthe disease.\n\nAll of the events have been organised by animal health product manufacturer and distributor Bimeda UK.\n\nThe firm is urging anyone who would like to attend to register with the appropriate regional contact (see table \nbelow).\n\nSheep scab awareness events\n\nDate\n\nTime\n\nVenue\n\n RSVP date and contact\n\n24 July\n\n10:30am\n\nPenrith Auction Mart, Cumbria\n\n17 July  mmarron@bimeda.com \n\n25 July\n\n10:00am\n\nSt Boswell\u2019s Mart, Scottish Borders\n\n16 July rwalker@bimeda.com \n\n26 July\n\n10:00am\n\nLochter Activity Centre, Aberdeenshire\n\nmailto:mmarron@bimeda.com\nmailto:rwalker@bimeda.com\n\n\n16 July ewalker@bimeda.com\n\n31 July\n\n11:00am\n\nHereford Market\n\n23 July fmoore@bimeda.com\n\n1 August\n\n11:30am\n\nLaunceston Rugby Club, Cornwall\n\n18 July dmead@bimeda.com \n\n2 August \n\n6:00pm\n\nRuthin Farmers Auction Co, Denbighshire\n\n26 July rmallet@bimeda.com\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThroughout the 2018 events season, we\u2019ll be bringing you regional coverage of the UK\u2019s best-loved agricultural and \ncountryside shows.\n\nThese events showcase the best of British farming and food, while also serving as a great social occasion and an \nopportunity for consumers and the public at large to learn more about the agriculture industry.\n\nSee also: What's next?

If you see something that isn\u2019t \nsafe, you should not be afraid to say so.\u201d\n\nMr Roberts said safety should be part of everyday conversations in farming and taken into consideration during \nevery job.\n\nHe is determined that agriculture will not take 20 years to make the impressive progress already achieved in other \nindustries, such as construction.\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\nIn Northern Ireland, accidents on farms that require medical attention happen 100 times a month, according to the \nFSP, which recently launched first aid training courses tailored to farming families and employees.\n\n\n\nThis week the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland (HSENI) is concentrating on \u201cKeeping Farming \nFamilies Safe\u201d at the Balmoral Show.\n\nHSENI chief executive and FSP chairman Keith Morrison said: \u201cUnfortunately many tragic accidents could have \nbeen avoided by planning ahead and taking actions to manage the dangers.\u201d\n\nNew safety measures\n\nMeanwhile, Mairead McGuinness MEP, a vice-president of the European Parliament, has stated that mandatory \nfarm safety measures may be included in CAP reform proposals.\n\nShe said it was unacceptable that farmers risked life and limb in carrying out their daily tasks.\n\n\u201cPressure on farmers to do more for less and to farm alone and under pressure leads to situations which may result \nin accidents,\u201d the MEP said.\n\nFarming retailer Mole Valley Farmers is launching a new health and safety initiative, \u201cTake a Moment\u201d, at this \nweek\u2019s Devon County Show, with leaflets, educational material and car stickers at the company\u2019s stand.\n\nFrom 1 June, all of its stores will have a section devoted to health and safety literature and equipment, such as \ngoggles, dust masks, steel toe-capped boots and high-vis clothing.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nScientists have produced pigs that can resist porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) by changing \ntheir genetic code.\n\nPRRS is an endemic disease and costs the pig industry about \u00a31.75bn/year in lost revenue in the US and Europe \nalone. There is no cure for the virus, although vaccination is available.\n\nScientists at the University of Edinburgh\u2019s Roslin Institute produced cells  resistant to the virus in lab tests last \nFebruary.\n\nBut for the first time they have now exposed live pigs to the virus. They found  none of the animals became ill when \nexposed to the virus, with blood tests finding no trace of infection.\n\nAbout porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome\n\nThe disease causes breathing problems and deaths in young animals and if pregnant sows become infected, it can \ncause them to lose their litter.\n\nThe virus is transmitted between pigs through nose-to-nose contact and via semen and faeces.\n\nGM regulations\n\nChristine Tait-Burkard, of the Roslin Institute, said the results were \u201cexciting\u201d but conceded it would may take \nseveral years before consumers were eating bacon sandwiches from PRRS-resistant pigs, due to regulations.\n\nGenetically modified animals are banned from the food chain in Europe.\n\nIt is not clear what regulations would apply to gene-edited animals, however, as the approach is different.\n\nGM techniques have been controversial because they can involve introducing genes of other species into an \nanimal.\n\nIn contrast, gene editing speeds up processes that could occur naturally through breeding over many generations, \nwithout introducing genes from other species.\n\n\n\nShe said: \u201cFirst and foremost, we need broader public discussion on the acceptability of gene-edited meat entering \nour food chain, to help inform political leaders on how these techniques should be regulated.\n\n\u201cWe also need to carry out longer-term studies to confirm these genetic changes do not have any unforeseen \nadverse effects on the animals.\u201d\n\nIf these studies are successful and the public are accepting of this technology, Dr Tait-Burkard said they would work \nwith pig breeding companies to integrate these gene edits into commercial breeding stocks.\n\nAbout the study\n\nThe virus infects pigs using a receptor on their cells\u2019 surface called CD163.\n\nResearchers at the University of Edinburgh\u2019s Roslin Institute used gene-editing techniques to remove a small \nsection of the CD163 gene.\n\nThey focused on the section of the receptor the virus attaches to, leaving the rest of the molecule intact.\n\nThe team collaborated with Genus, a leading global animal genetics company, to produce pigs with the specific \nDNA change.\n\nOther groups have used gene editing to create PRRS-resistant pigs by removing the whole CD163 receptor.\n\nRemoving only a section of CD163 allows the receptor to retain its ordinary function in the body and reduces the \nrisk of side effects, the researchers say.\n\nThis research, co-funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and Genus, is published \nin the Journal of Virology.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe Scottish Parliament has voted against UK Brexit legislation it says would restrict Holyrood's powers over key \nareas including agriculture, fisheries and the environment.\n\nIt says the current bill would allow the UK government to prevent the Scottish Parliament from legislating in key \ndevolved areas \u2013 including farming \u2013 for up to seven years.\n\nThe Scottish Parliament voted to reject the EU Withdrawal Bill on Thursday (15 May).\n\nSee also: Scots and Welsh warn against farm Brexit \u2018power grab\u2019\n\nFollowing the vote, Scotland's Brexit secretary, Michael Russell, urged the UK government to remove the parts of \nthe bill that constrain devolved powers.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn line with the clear majority of people in Scotland, we don\u2019t want to leave the EU and we are still working \nto find a way to secure as much as we can from our present relationship.\u201d\n\n'Undermining devolution'\n\nMr Russell said the Scottish government accepted legal preparation for Brexit was required, but the UK \ngovernment's EU Withdrawal Bill was an attempt to undermine devolution.\n\nAnd he accused the UK government of wanting to \u201ctake a power to restrict the competence\u201d of the Scottish \nParliament and then exercise it against the wishes of the Scottish people.\n\n\u201cThe Scottish Parliament has now said overwhelmingly that this attempt to undermine devolution is unacceptable,\u201d \nMr Russell said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe UK government cannot ignore the reality of devolution or try to drown out what this parliament says. They \ncannot pretend that no motion has been passed.\u201d\n\nThe Welsh Assembly gave its consent to the bill on the same day \u2013 although Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru \ncontinue to maintain it is a power-grab by Westminster.\n\n'Considerable offer'\n\nBefore the vote, Scottish secretary David Mundell said the UK government had worked hard to secure the support \nof the Scottish Parliament for the bill.\n\nThe UK government had put a considerable offer on the table that would see the vast majority of devolved powers \nautomatically flow from the EU to Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh, he said.\n\n\u201cFreezing\u201d a small number of specific policy areas while new arrangements were designed and implemented would \ngive essential certainty to businesses, said Mr Mundell.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe are clear our approach fully respects devolution, as the Welsh government has confirmed.\n\n\u201cWe still hope the Scottish government will come on board, even at this late stage.

It is seeking a temporary derogation from Quality Meat Scotland (QMS) to allow pigs to be slaughtered in \nNorthern England, but still be labelled as Scottish pork.\n\nThe derogation was used by the plant last August after it was closed for four months following a major fire at the \nfacility.  \n\nMeat processors and the wider industry were suffering from a lack of information, according to Tulip head of \ncorporate communications Nick Purnell.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting the same information as everyone else. An ammonia plant that was closed is expected to come back \nonline by 2 July, but it will be some time before the supply chain is fully replenished.\u201d\n\nMr Purnell said Tulip\u2019s procurement team were working round the clock to secure what little stocks of carbon \ndioxide were available to the UK and that animal welfare remained the highest priority for the company.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re urging producers to maintain open lines of communication with us and to continue to work to ensure high \nstandards.\u201d\n\nCreaking at the seams\n\nAbattoirs around the UK were \"creaking at the seams\" as carbon dioxide supplies continued to dwindle, according \nto British Meat Packers chief executive Nick Allen, who added that several had just days of supply remaining.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting trickier for our members to source carbon dioxide and we\u2019re likely to be in the same situation for the rest \nof the week,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Allen added that while some plants could fall back to secondary, electronic stunning systems, many had no plan \nB and would have to reduce throughputs if the situation did not improve soon.\n\n\u201cIf carbon dioxide supplies don\u2019t start coming through soon, we will start to see quite a substantial slowdown in \nproduction,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are also concerns over animal welfare as the supply chain gets backed up and more and more stock is left \non farm.\n\nWarm weather forecast for the next two weeks has compounded the issue, with demand for barbecues and beer \nexpected to peak and with animals requiring extra space to remain cool. \n\nDefra response\n\nDefra has stated it is working towards finding a resolution to the crisis and is consulting with the industry to see if \nfurther action needed to be taken.\n\n\u201cThe government is aware that there are reports of a carbon dioxide shortage affecting the food and drink sector, \nand that industry is working to find a solution,\" said a Defra spokesperson. \n\n\"While this is an issue for industry, the government is in contact with the relevant companies and trade \nassociations, including those within the food and drink sector and main carbon dioxide suppliers.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nIndustry leaders in Scotland are piling the pressure on politicians to provide answers about future arrangements for \nagriculture after the UK leaves the European Union.\n\nWith just nine months to Brexit, questions remain about future funding for farming, trading arrangements with the \nEU and ongoing access to overseas labour.\n\nSee also: Scotland plans cap on direct payments post-Brexit\n\nSpeaking at the Royal Highland Show, NFU Scotland president Andrew McCornick warned: \u201cCrucial decisions that \nwill affect the well-being of the nation\u2019s farmers, crofters and food and drink sector remain in limbo.\n\n\u201cOur primary producers are having to take business decisions now that will not come into fruition until well after the \nUK has left the EU and there is growing frustration and anger that they are making those decisions in a void.\u201d\n\nFinancial package\n\nMany themes in the Scottish government's Stability and Simplicity consultation, which proposes a five-year \ntransition for farming, chimed with the union's views, said Mr McCornick.\n\nBut Scotland\u2019s ability to deliver a policy that worked for farmers would depend on the financial package allocated by \nWestminster, he warned.\n\nMr McCornick said: \u201cBudgets based on existing CAP spend are guaranteed to the end of this parliament. We need \nreassurances on budgets beyond that period and confirmation that Scottish agriculture\u2019s share will be ring-fenced.\"\n\nScotland's farming industry has an excellent relationship with other parts of the UK \u2013 but free and frictionless trade \nwith the EU remains crucial to food producers.\n\n\n\nTrade arrangements\n\nThe importance of securing preferential and beneficial trade arrangements with the EU \u2013 a major trading partner \u2013 \ncontinued to go unaddressed, said Mr McCornick.\n\nOn labour, almost every soft fruit, flower and vegetable producer in Scotland was experiencing difficulties recruiting \nemployees, with ongoing reports of permanent and seasonal staff shortages.\n\nWith post-Brexit immigration arrangements unknown, alongside the lack of a seasonal workers scheme, Scottish \ngrowers were finding it harder to recruit much-needed permanent and seasonal staff.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nAfter months of rain, the sun\u2019s out, the soil\u2019s dried and the wheels of machines are beginning to roll.\n\nIt's all going so well until you hear a snap, or notice a crack, or a light appears on the dash, and everything comes \nto a grinding halt until the part can be replaced.\n\nSee also: Massey parts up for grabs as dealer has final clear out\n\nPart searching can often be a time-consuming process, so a new online parts store \u2013 buyanypart.co.uk \u2013 has been \nlaunched as a go-to platform which allows farmers to browse more than 500,000 parts for any type of machine in \none place, rather than trawling the web and phoning suppliers to compare prices.\n\nFinding the part can by done by entering the part number or by clicking on one of the manufacturers and scrolling \nthrough the listed items available.\n\nResults of both original and replacement parts matching the exact model are shown and, if there\u2019s no part available, \nthe company can help with further searching.  \n\nThe service is available every day of the year with prices quoted including delivery and VAT.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA new, mandatory sheep carcass classification system is being proposed by Defra, which will run on similar lines to \nthe grid systems that have existed for cattle and pigs for many years.\n\nAccording to a consultation launched on Wednesday (30 May), qualified assessors working in abattoirs will use a \nstandard grid to classify sheep and so determine how much a producer should be paid.\n\nSee also: 5 sheep crushes on test: Which handles best?\n\nDefra farm minister George Eustice described the idea as \u201can important step in improving fairness for sheep \nfarmers and ensuring they get a fair deal for their excellent produce\u201d.\n\nAccording to the consultation, there are two options \u2013 to either adopt the Europ grid system already established by \nthe EU or, post Brexit, develop a bespoke system for England to take account of future market opportunities and \nneeds.  \n\n\u201cIf we implement a bespoke system, we would consult again on the specifics of the system before imposing \nmandatory sheep carcass classification,\u201d says the report.\n\nProductivity\n\nAccording to the consultation, greater transparency will lead to productivity improvements, as producers will better \nunderstand the classification of their animals and make the necessary adjustments. \n\n\n\nThere are about 151 abattoirs registered to slaughter sheep in England, though just 34 account for more than 90% \nof all throughput.\n\nA number of these already operate voluntary carcass classification systems.\n\nThe plan is to exempt smaller abattoirs \u2013 those handling less than 1,000 sheep a week \u2013 from the requirement to \noperate a classification system.\n\nCommercial abattoirs taking part would be obliged to report deadweight prices back weekly to the AHDB, which \nwould publish the aggregated information.\n\nThe government is also considering requiring them to publish other charges, such as the cost of cleaning animals, \nclassification charges and insurance.\n\nReaction\n\nThe National Sheep Association (NSA) says it welcomes the consultation. \u201cHaving a mandatory system is the only \nway to get everyone to act,\u201d said NSA chief executive Phil Stocker.\n\n\u201cIt will hopefully put an end to things like rounding down of weights or random shifts in carcass grades.\u201d  \n\nExempting some smaller abattoirs also made sense. \u201cThe small abattoir sector is under severe pressure, so we \ndon\u2019t want to add to their costs. Besides, they have a very different relationship with their suppliers.\u201d\n\nLivestock Auctioneers Association executive secretary Chris Dodds also supported the principle of greater \ntransparency, adding the sheep carcass classifications should be sent back to marts, who could then feed it on to \nfarmers.\n\nNorman Bagley of the Association of Independent Meat Suppliers said developing a \u201cbespoke\u201d system for England, \npost Brexit, could be useful if it involved building in additional criteria, such as \u201ceating quality\u201d to help differentiate \nUK lamb from cheaper imports.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe shocking extent of labour exploitation and modern-day slavery in agriculture has been laid bare in a new report \nby the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA).\n\nDrawing on its extensive work with victims and offenders, the GLAA has concluded that the agricultural industry is a \n\u201chigh-risk\u201d sector for exploitation and abuse of seasonal workers, including poor wages and working conditions.\n\nThe report, The Nature and Scale of Labour Exploitation Across All Sectors Within the United Kingdom, paints a \nbleak picture when it comes to labour abuses in the agricultural sector.\n\nSee also: NFU's 10-point plan for attracting the best farmworkers\n\nThe Modern Slavery Act 2015 categorises offences as holding a person in a position of slavery, servitude, forced or \ncompulsory labour, or facilitating their travel with the intention of exploiting them soon after. \n\nIn the UK, the number of modern slavery cases rose by 35% from 2016-17, with agriculture and the food industry \namong the worst sectors.

Reports of under-age workers in the food industry are also being reported.\n\nRoger Bannister, GLAA chief executive, says: \u201cThe sad reality is that the criminality that drives exploitation and \nslavery is quite close to home in the towns, cities and countryside in which we live and work.\u201d\n\nComplex supply chain blamed \n\nFood and farming campaign group Sustain says parts of the food system are \u201cclearly broken\u201d when it comes to \nprotecting workers and a lack of enforcement of employment regulations is leading to huge exploitation in \nagriculture.\n\nVicki Hird, Sustain\u2019s farming campaign co-ordinator, says: \u201cAgriculture workers are getting sporadic pay and at \ndifferent rates, and there is too much evidence of criminality and slavery in food processing.\n\n\u201cThe report shows that the growth of complex supply chains \u2013 where a drive for cost savings is leading to abuse \u2013 \nare often to blame.\u201d\n\nSustain has called for changes in how the whole food chain is managed, including better enforcement and \nmonitoring of existing rules to tackle slavery and exploitation in agriculture.\n\nThe role of the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority\n\nThe Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA), formerly the Gangmaster Licensing Authority (GLA), was \nestablished in April 2005 by the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004.\n\nThe primary objective of the Act is to curb the exploitative activities of gangmasters \u2013 a term used widely in \nagriculture to describe labour providers \u2013 the majority of whom run reputable and legitimate businesses.\n\nThe GLAA regulates the activities of gangmasters through a licensing scheme for labour providers operating in \nregulated sectors. Since April 2007 it has been illegal to supply workers to the agriculture, horticulture and \nassociated processing and packaging sectors without a licence.\n\nThe licensing scheme ensures that businesses who supply workers (labour providers, gangmasters or agencies) \nand businesses who need workers (labour users, farmers, packhouses, factories) meet the employment standards \nthat are required by law.\n\nFor more information visit www.gla.gov.uk\n\nCalls for new seasonal labour scheme\n\nFarming organisations have repeatedly called on Defra to reintroduce the seasonal agricultural workers scheme \n(Saws), to address labour shortages.\n\nThe scheme provided an efficient supply of labour to the horticultural sector for 60 years.\n\nIt allowed fruit and vegetable growers to employ migrant workers from Bulgaria and Romania as seasonal staff for \nup to six months at a time.\n\nBut the government decided to close the scheme in 2013 after claims that there should be sufficient workers from \nwithin labour markets to meet the needs of the horticultural industry.\n\nhttp://www.gla.gov.uk/\n\n\nAn NFU survey revealed a 29% shortfall in labour supply for September, almost double the number in 2016. The \nunion has warned that labour shortages could result in more crops could left to rot in the ground this summer.\n\nSpeaking at the NFU Conference in February, Defra secretary Michael Gove said farm leaders had put forward \n\u201cstrong and compelling\u201d arguments for a new scheme. But no announcement has been forthcoming.\n\nCase study: Cornish gangmaster shut down for worker exploitation\n\nA Cornish gangmaster who skimmed pay and ordered workers to work double shifts with insufficient breaks had her \nlicence revoked by the GLAA in February.\n\nNeringa Butkeviciute also failed to pay workers all they were due and charged for accommodation in caravans that \nwere deemed both unsanitary and unsafe.\n\nThe 29-year-old operated her business DNK Recruitment out of the Bosparva Caravan Park in Leedstown, Hayle, \nwhere she provided workers for various roles in the horticulture sector.\n\nBut an inspection by the GLAA last December found serious issues with the way the business was being run.\n\nCaravans being used to accommodate workers were found with leaking waste pipes, broken doors and windows, \nmould on walls, curtains and windows.\n\nThere was general overcrowding, defective smoke detectors and electric heaters placed close to bedding.

Advice from Adas is to check susceptible winter wheat varieties at the \nsusceptible stage of ear emergence (GS 51-59) for adult female midges in the evening.\n\nSteve Ellis, an entomologist at the consultant, says the control threshold in susceptible milling and seed crop is one \nmidge per six ears and in susceptible feed crops it is one midge per three ears.\n\nAgronomists point out that this is the first year that big numbers of midges have been seen since the most effective \ninsecticide for controlling them, Dursban (chlorpyrifos), was banned in 2016.\n\nPaul Fogg, cereals specialist at agronomy company Frontier, says his group is seeing big numbers of midges, \nespecially in southern England, with one Oxfordshire trap catching a large number.\n\nHe says wheat growers need to be monitoring their crops until they start to come into flower, after which the risk of \nmidge damage is diminished.\n\nThere are some midge-resistant wheat varieties available on the AHDB Recommended List, including Skyfall, \nBarrel, Kerrin and Santiago.\n\nControl measures\n\nControl of fusarium diseases is achieved with azole fungicides, with prothioconazole giving the best control while \ntebuconazole and metconazole offer some level of activity while giving good control of rapidly-spreading brown rust.\n\nMr Blake said tebuconazole and metconazole can be useful if brown rust is a threat, while the multisite fungicide \nmancozeb can be useful to boost septoria control.\n\nFor midge control, Dr Ellis suggests pyrethroids such as lambda-cyhalothrin and beta-cyfluthrin, and says timing is \ncrucial as treatment only kills the adults present at the time of spraying.\n\nThe neonicotinoid insecticide thiacloprid (Biscaya) can control adults and has some activity against eggs and \nlarvae, he adds.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nNFU Scotland has welcomed the cancellation of a mass release of Chinese lanterns near Lockerbie.\n\nThe Light Fest, run by US firm Viive Events, had been due to take place at Springkell Estate near Lockerbie on 11 \nAugust.\n\nBut following strong opposition from farmers and environmentalists over the debris and fire risk to livestock, crops \nand buildings created by the lanterns, organisers have said the event will not go ahead.\n\nSee also: Calls for England to adopt Welsh councils\u2019 sky lantern ban\n\nNFUS said the timing of the event was especially bad as it coincided with harvest and lanterns have been shown to \nstart fires.\n\nTeresa Dougall, NFUS regional manager for Dumfries and Galloway, said the decision would be \u201cgreat relief\u201d to \nfarmers.\n\nCampaign for a total ban\n\n\n\nThe union has been campaigning for an outright ban on the lanterns for several years and said it would continue to \ndo so, supported by other UK farming unions. \n\n\u201cWhile organisers of such events may point at insurance being in place, that is of little comfort,\u201d she added. \n\n\u201cBy the time insurance is needed, the damage to property, crops, woodland or animal health has been done.\u201d\n\nIn total, 18 out of Scotland\u2019s 32 councils, including Dumfries and Galloway Council, announced a ban on the \nrelease of sky lanterns at all major events the council would host or sponsor. But that does not stop individuals \nreleasing lanterns from private land.\n\n\u2018Common-sense decision\u2019\n\nNFUS policy manager Penny Middleton said it was a \u201ccommon-sense decision\u201d, which should not require a \ncampaign to achieve this result.\n\n\u201cChinese lanterns can cause untold damage as there is no control over where these burning structures of paper, \nmetal and wood decide to land,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThat means they present an unacceptable risk to animal health, property and farmland at any time of year.\u201d \n\nSky lanterns have been banned across all public land in Wales.

\nas a result of the Asda-Sainsbury\u2019s mega-merger.\n\nApril\u2019s deal to create a Frankenstein\u2019s monster of a retailer from the two supermarket giants will force many \nsuppliers to go to

merger\n\nDespite the average profit margins within the food supply industry sitting at a healthy 4%, the report outlined that \n125 of the UK\u2019s 500 largest food manufacturers were already considered to be in \u201cfinancial danger\u201d.\n\nA further 73 businesses were in the financially vulnerable position of making losses before the inevitable squeeze \non margins as a result of the merger has even taken place.\n\nIn order to survive such a hyper-competitive environment, the report predicted many suppliers would have to merge \nthemselves to deliver greater margins from economies of scale.\n\n\n\n\u201cImproved efficiencies may be one area of cost savings for the newly combined Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda, but anymore \ndownward pressure on supplier prices will make it incredibly tough for food suppliers \u2013 ultimately costing jobs in the \nlong run,\u201d said Plimsoll senior analyst, David Pattison.  \n\nMr Pattison added if the deal goes ahead he foresaw a period of acquisitions, takeovers and mergers as \nsupermarket suppliers fought for survival, in a race to the bottom on price.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, these companies have a good gross margin but

\nauto-enrolment pensions and the weakened pound, said Mr Pattison, who added the proposed merger could be the \nfinal straw that pushed many suppliers to sell up. \n\n\u201cDoing business will become harder as more stringent financial controls are introduced in an effort to reduce \nexposure from both suppliers and customers going bust and it is the small supplier who will suffer

It is powered by a 1960 Fordson Dexta tractor.\n\nAlthough the splitter can handle big logs, loading them on to the main frame manually was difficult.\n\nTo solve the loading problem Mr Beckett has attached a lifting frame to the main beam of the log splitter, powered \nhydraulically by the tractor.\n\nWith the frame lowered, the log is rolled into position and its weight automatically triggers a pair of catches that \nprevent the log rolling off the frame.\n\nThe frame then lifts the log into position ready for splitting.\n\nAlthough it no longer qualified for the new equipment category in the competition, the new self-loading version of \nthe log splitter was awarded second place in this year\u2019s modifications class.\n\nClever gadgets\n\nIn the gadgets category a compact storage unit made entirely of recycled items took the top award.\n\nEntered by Chris Templeman of Red House Farm, Witnesham, Suffolk, the main components were large diameter \nconcave discs from a harrow that provided the three round shelves with a fourth disc used as the base.\n\nThe discs were originally serrated, Mr Templeman explained, but when the serrations became too worn to be \neffective, he decided to give the discs a new role as circular storage shelves for the corner of his workshop.\n\nThe circular shelves are free to rotate, and the top shelf is fitted with lengths of steel spiral from a pig feed auger to \nhold hammers and other workshop tools.\n\n \n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThis year, we\u2019re ramping up our regional coverage of the farming and countryside shows taking place across the \nnation.\n\nThese events are so valuable, allowing the agricultural industry to communicate more about British food and \nfarming to the general public, and bringing the rural community together for a much-needed day off.\n\nFrom 21 to 24 June, 190,000 visitors descended on the Royal Highland Centre in Ingliston on the outskirts of \nEdinburgh for the annual Royal Highland Show.\n\nSee also: Why young farmers should consider getting into poultry\n\nShow-goers had to get the suncream on as the four-day event was drenched with Scottish sunshine.\n\nAs always, the show was a great showcase for the best of British livestock with hundreds of outstanding entries \nexhibited in the dairy, beef, sheep and equine rings.\n\nThe grandstand quickly filled with spectators for the impressive Grand Parade in the main ring.\n\nSee also: The winners in the RHS beef, sheep and dairy interbreed competitions\n\n\n\nWith a forge, a forestry area and a countryside area, there was no shortage of places for people to learn about rural \ncrafts and skills.\n\nBut if it was retail therapy and a good lunch out visitors were after, they would not have been disappointed, with \nhundreds of food stands and shopping galore.\n\nIf you have an agricultural show taking place in your area and think it should be covered by Farmers Weekly, let \ncommunity editor Oli Hill know by emailing oli.hill@reedbusiness.com\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nAdults living in the countryside are more likely to be financially vulnerable than their urban counterparts, a survey \nhas revealed.\n\nThe research, carried out by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), showed that 54% of adults in rural areas lived \nin potential vulnerability compared with the UK average of 50%.\n\nThe FCA explained that vulnerability was not simply the level of indebtedness but a range of components, such as \nlow earnings, lack of online access and health problems.\n\nOnline access\n\nOne major difference uncovered was access to online financial services in rural areas. Of UK adults who never use \nthe internet, 70%, or 3.7 million people, live on farms or in villages.\n\nIt means the take-up of mobile banking by adults with a day-to-day account in rural areas, at 23%, is just half that of \nadults in urban areas (45%).\n\nSee also: 6 tips for improving short-term farm finances\n\nThe lack of online access means there is a greater dependency on bank visits, with 68% of country people using a \nbranch in the past 12 months against 61% in towns.\n\nWork and incomes\n\nRural dwellers are less likely to be working, with under half (46%) employed, compared with 62% in towns and \ncities.\n\nAs a result, household income was 10% lower for rural people, at an average of \u00a341,000, compared to \u00a346,000 in \nurban areas.\n\nThe survey also revealed more retired country people depend on a State Pension (51%) as their main income \ncompared to 44% of urban dwellers.\n\nEducation\n\nAdditionally, educational achievement levels were much poorer in the countryside, with only one in three holding \nhigher qualifications compared with 41% in built-up areas.\n\nThe difference was even starker for those with no qualifications at all at 23% in rural situations \u2013 almost double the \n12% level for people who live in urban locations.\n\nDebt\n\nHowever, responses to the survey revealed that the level of debt in rural areas was lower, with fewer people (37%) \nborrowing through credit cards, overdrafts and high-cost loans compared to the UK average of 46%.\n\nmailto:oli.hill@reedbusiness.com\n\n\nMore adults in urban (27%) than rural (20%) places have been overdrawn in the past 12 months and more urban \nadults (20%) than rural adults (14%) possess a credit card that they do not pay off the monthly balance on. It means \nadults in rural areas owe far less on average (\u00a32,510) than their urban counterparts (\u00a39,150). \n\nMortgage debt reflected a similar situation, with more adults in the country owning their home outright (42%) \ncompared to less than a third (30%) in Britain\u2019s towns and cities.\n\nBut average mortgage debts in the countryside, at \u00a3123,000, were similar to the UK average of \u00a3126,000.\n\nHealth\n\nThe survey also looked at health issues. It found one in three (32%) adults in the countryside had one or more long-\nterm physical or mental health problems, well above the UK average at less than a quarter (24%)\n\nThe survey\n\nThe FCA canvassed 13,000 people aged 18 and over. Interviews were carried out online and face-to-face to ensure \nnon-internet users were included. The survey data can be interpreted in many different ways. This report shows the \nresults across different geographic areas of the UK.\n\nReacting to the survey, the Country Land and Business Association focused on the disadvantages arising from poor \nonline access. \n\nThe organisation's senior rural business adviser Charles Trotman said: \u201cAs more and more services come online it \nis vital for rural areas to have the same digital connectivity available in towns and cities. However, homes and \nbusinesses across the countryside are still being disadvantaged by poor broadband and mobile coverage.\n\n\u201cFarmers struggle to fill in important BPS or tax documents, while barriers are created for rural tourism businesses \nwho can\u2019t offer digital services to guests or even operate online booking systems.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA lot of effort has gone into managing wheat crops during this difficult spring. However, getting the T3 spray wrong \ncould undo much of this good work and put income at risk.\n\nEar blight-causing species Fusarium culmorum and F graminearum produce the mycotoxins deoxynivalenol (Don) \nand zearalenone (Zon), and there are legal limits for both.\n\nHigh levels can lead to the loss of milling premiums, or even crops being rejected altogether.\n\nSee also: Angled sprayer nozzles give best wheat ear disease control\n\nWhile other species such as Microdochium nivale do not produce mycotoxins, they can have a severe impact on \ngrain yield and specific weight, as seen in the harvest of 2012.\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s important for farmers to manage the risk at the T3 fungicide timing.\n\nPrevention - trials with angled nozzles\n\nPhil Jennings, plant pathologist at Fera, says he is already seeing microdochium at the stem base and Fusarium \nculmorum on lower leaves.\n\n\u201cYou would not normally see F graminearum yet, but current dry conditions have been favourable for it,\u201d he adds.  \n\nDr Jennings highlights that it is all about prevention \u2013 and this relies on getting good coverage of the ear with a \nfungicide.\n\n\n\n\u201cIdeally you need to fully coat the ear. Then you have a better chance of stopping infection,\u201d he says.\n\nHe recalls a trial where they coated one side of the ear and still saw disease development on the other side.\n\nThe need for good coverage led Dr Jennings to carry out trials with angled nozzles.\n\n\u201cOur work has shown that that angled nozzles improve control,\u201d he says.\n\nHe tested angled nozzles versus vertical flat fans and saw a consistent response from Proline (prothioconazole), \nFolicur (tebuconazole) and Prosaro (prothioconazole + tebuconazole).\n\nFor example, with tebuconazole fusarium severity fell from 24% to 15% just by the switch to an angled nozzle.\n\nSprayer operator\n\nSprayer operator Matt Redman has gone a step further by fitting angled nozzles (Defy 3D), alternating forwards and \nbackwards facing.\n\n\u201cThis is so we can coat both sides of the ear as the sprayer travels through the crop,\u201d he explains.\n\nMr Redman has about 600ha of winter wheat in Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire that he will be applying a T3 to \nthis season.\n\nMatt Redman\u2019s approach to T3 spraying\n\nNozzle: Defy 3D, alternating forwards and backwards\n\nPressure: 3bar\n\nVolume: 100 litres/ha\n\nSpeed: Forward speed of 12-14kph.\n\nBoom height: 50cm above the crop\n\nIdeal timing - tight window\n\nThe other key part of a successful T3 spray is timing, as the window can be just a matter of a few days. Sam \nHarvey, Bayer\u2019s commercial technical manager, says the ideal timing is early to mid-flower at growth stage 63.\n\n\u201cWork with Fera identified this as the ideal timing. Plants start to flower at the centre of the ear and this is the time to \ngo in for maximum protection. You are applying before disease starts to penetrate via the anthers.\u201d\n\nHe warns that if farmers leave it to growth stage 65, the fungus may already be in the ear.\n\n\u201cConversely if you go too soon, you will not coat the anthers and this route of entry is exposed.\u201d\n\nThis season, the high variability of crops in fields will make timing more difficult, as you are not going to hit the \noptimum time for all plants.\n\nMr Redman says he goes by the majority of the field, as \u201cthis is where most of the yield potential is\u201d.\n\nFinally, on fungicide choice, Dr Jennings says azoles like metconazole and tebuconazole offer good control of \nFusarium culmorum and F graminearum.\n\nHowever, prothiconazole is the only azole that is effective for both fusariums and microdochium.\n\nKnow your enemy\n\n\n\nKnowing which species are present in your crop allows you to take the right action, thereby minimising the number \nof rejections.

After a five-mile chase, \nofficers eventually caught up with him at the junction of Marske Road and the A174 road.\n\n\n\nHe fled the tractor on foot but was chased by officers who caught up with him on the Coast Road at Redcar.\n\nMr Collinson was arrested at the scene and charged with drink-driving, driving while disqualified, driving with no \ninsurance and failing to stop for police. He later pleaded guilty to all four charges in court.\n\nOver the limit\n\nWhen he was breathalysed, his reading was 50 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath \u2013 the legal limit \nis 35.\n\nThe court was told he had been drinking vodka and cans of beer before deciding to take a friend for a ride in the \ntractor.\n\nMr Collinson, of Brotton Road, Carlin How, was sentenced to eight weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months. He \nwas banned from driving for 14 months and given a 20-day rehabilitation activity requirement. He was also ordered \nto pay \u00a3200 costs.\n\nA 30-year-old man who was arrested at the scene was released without charge.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nIt is often said that any dog is capable of attacking a sheep \u2013 it\u2019s the hereditary wolf in them, and even the most \nplacid pooch can turn killer if those ancient genes kick in.\n\nThat is true, says Kent-based sheep farmer Tobin Bird, but it doesn\u2019t mean the vast majority of dogs can\u2019t be \ntrained to respect livestock and become almost totally reliable in the presence of sheep.\n\nSee also: The law on shooting dogs\n\nLike many sheep farmers, Mr Bird has had repeated problems with dog attacks on his 80ha farm at Iden Green. \n\u201cEvery year it seems to get worse. I\u2019ve had two serious attacks, with sheep being ripped apart and on occasion \nhaving to be put down.\n\n\u201cIt is so frustrating. People just don\u2019t understand the consequences of their actions and the damage their pets can \ncause to a farmer, both financially and emotionally.\u201d\n\nThat is why, six years ago, Mr Bird decided to launch a sideline to his farming business called Sheep Proof Your \nDog.\n\n\u201cI have always worked with animals, and especially like working with problem cases,\u201d he says. \u201cInitially a few friends \nasked me to help train their dogs to stop chasing sheep. That worked so well that I then decided to develop it as a \nbusiness.\u201d\n\nMr Bird trains about 400 dogs a year on his farm and, while he cannot guarantee 100% success, he says only a \nhandful of dogs do not quickly learn to behave in the presence of sheep.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe key to a successful training session is to let the dog know who is boss, and that is all about the tone of voice.\n\n\u201cPeople just don\u2019t know how to speak to a dog,\u201d says Mr Bird. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to dominate the dog and let them know \nwho is the alpha party.\u201d\n\nEach session begins with the owner and the dog on a lead entering an enclosed pen with four sheep in it. As soon \nas the dog gets close to the sheep, Mr Bird shouts \u201cNo, No\u201d and makes a loud noise with bottles to effectively shock \nthe dog.\n\n\n\nThe numbers\n\nTobin Bird trains about 400 dogs a year\n\nSheep worrying is estimated to cost farmers \u00a31.6m a year\n\nA 30-minute mid-week training session costs \u00a331\n\nThere are 900 sheep in Ashdown Forest\n\nThis is repeated several times, before the group enters a larger field, where Mr Bird\u2019s two working Collies drive a \nsmall flock of sheep towards them. Again, as they pass close by, the strong command of \u201cNo, No\u201d is repeated.\n\nThe dog is then returned to its owner, who has to repeat the process as the sheep get near.\n\nThe dogs often seem completely disconcerted and associate the presence of sheep with a loud, scary noise. Within \nminutes, they start to regard the sheep with a mixture of respect and caution.\n\nAfter the lesson, Mr Bird encourages the dog owners to reinforce the message with voice and noise whenever they \ncan \u2013 especially to call their dogs off things like rabbits and pheasants, using the same technique.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to praise the dog as well when it comes back \u2013 and I still strongly recommend people keep their \ndogs on leads when livestock are visible and not take any chances,\u201d says Mr Bird.\n\nMeet the trainees\n\nButter wouldn\u2019t melt \u2013 or would it? Nigel Fish, the owner of this five-year old Madagascan Coton de Tulear,  said he \nhad no idea his family pet would show any interest in sheep \u2013 until three years ago when out on a family walk in \nSnowdonia.\n\n\u201cWe were nearing the end of our walk when we suddenly came across a flock of sheep and he went absolutely \nnuts,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe gave chase and we just could not get him to stop. Fortunately the sheep managed to cross a stream and got \naway, but it made me realise the same could happen again, so we\u2019ve always kept him on a lead, and now we are \nputting him through this training.\u201d\n\nThis three-year old Mastiff, Serberus, may look pretty mean, but according to his charge for the day, Fiona \nStephens, he has never shown any interest in sheep.\n\nBut with a sheep farm adjacent to the equestrian centre where he lives, his owners felt it imperative that he receive \nsome training to try to minimise the risks.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, people should be made to \u2018livestock proof\u2019 their dogs and this sort of training should be obligatory,\u201d \nsays Ms Stephens.\n\n\u201cAt least if you know your dog\u2019s limits, you know what you are dealing with. It only takes one sheep to go, and any \ndog can take off after them. I always keep my dogs on a lead near livestock \u2013 it should be made compulsory.\u201d\n\nForest partnership\n\nAs well as training about 400 dogs a year on his own farm, Mr Bird has also teamed up with the Ashdown Forest \nConservators in East Sussex to run four training days a year \u2013 held at the National Cat Centre in the forest.\n\nForest director Pat Buesnel says the forest has suffered a number of fatal attacks in recent times, both on its own \nHebridean sheep and on those belonging to its 12 active commoners.\n\n\n\nIn one incident last year, commoner Henry Osborne from Nutley, East Sussex was himself attacked as he tried to \nget two dogs off his sheep. In the past, he had to shoot a dog which was attacking his livestock.\n\n\u201cThe problem seems to be getting worse, with out of control dogs not only disturbing our sheep, but also our cattle, \nfallow deer and ground nesting birds,\u201d says Mrs Buesnel. \u201cIt\u2019s often due to ignorance on the part of the owners, so \nwe want to help them.\u201d\n\nAs well as publishing its own Code of Conduct for Dog Walkers, for the past four years the forest has helped \norganise training days with Mr Bird, catering for up to 17 dogs a day.\n\n\u201cThe courses are proving incredibly popular and are always over-subscribed,\u201d says Mrs Buesnel. \u201cWe publicise \nthem through social media and they are generally full within a few days. We often find people coming back for \nrefresher courses.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nTens of thousands of individuals and organisations with an interest in food, farming and rural issues are believed to \nhave responded to Defra\u2019s \u201cHealth and Harmony\u201d consultation, in the hope of influencing future policy.\n\nThe ideas and priorities now submitted to Defra will be pored over in the coming months and some of it will finally \nemerge as the new policy for British agriculture outside the European Union.\n\nHere we summarise the key points put forward by some of the bodies that have taken part.\n\nSee also: Key points to consider in Health and Harmony consultation\n\nTenant Farmers Association\n\nTenancies should be reformed to give growers and livestock producers greater security and incentive to invest in \ntheir businesses, says the Tenant Farmers Association (TFA).\n\nFarm businesses tenancies, let under the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995, lack the necessary security of tenure for \na vibrant, productive and prosperous farm industry, argues the TFA, which advocates a series of fiscal changes to \nstimulate a \u201cmore sustainable approach to letting land\u201d.\n\nRecommendations include restricting 100% Agricultural Property Relief (APR) from inheritance tax to landlords \nprepared to let for 10 years or more \u2013 or on new tenancies, including successions, with security of tenure under the \nAgricultural Holdings Act 1986.\n\nThe TFA says the government should also clamp down on landowners who use share farming, contract farming, \nshare partnerships and grazing licences as \u201cthin veneers of trading activity and as vehicles for aggressive tax \navoidance\u201d.\n\nArguing that these schemes are promoted by agents and accountants, the TFA says landlords taking advantage of \nthem in practice \u201ctake no risk in the business, have little, if any, entrepreneurial input and lack any management \ncontrol\u201d.\n\nTo further encourage longer tenancies, the TFA says landlords prepared to let land for 10 years or more should be \nable to declare their income as if it was trading income for taxation purposes. Stamp duty land tax should also be \nreformed to end discrimination against longer tenancies, it adds.\n\nA further issue to be resolved is \u201cdual use\u201d, which allows landowners to enter land into an agri-environment scheme \n\u2013 and receive the benefits from the scheme directly \u2013 even if they have let that same land to an agricultural tenant.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis practice supports the non-active individual and provides the opportunity for landlords to impose scheme \nrequirements on their tenants who often get no return from the scheme itself,\u201d says the TFA. \u201cThese practices must \nbe outlawed in any new arrangements.\u201d\n\nCountry Land and Business Association \n\nWhile favouring a move towards greater environmental delivery, the CLA is especially wary of a sudden change, \nsuch as a sharp drop in direct farm payments following Brexit. It has therefore set out three crucial preconditions:\n\nThere must be absolute clarity about the long-term EU/UK trade arrangements before there is any transition away \nfrom direct payments\n\nThere is a clear plan in place for investing in agricultural productivity during the transition period.\n\nThere must be clarity on what will replace the Basic Payment Scheme before steps are taken to start dismantling it.\n\nThe CLA is totally against the capping of payments to larger farmers and landowners as part of the process of \nwinding down direct payments, saying cuts should be made in small increments (no more than 20% a year) and \nspread across all farmers equally. A five-year transition is deemed \u201creasonable\u201d, while the CLA also sees no merit \nin retaining \u201cgreening\u201d requirements.\n\nIt also insists that the current budget for agriculture should continue beyond 2022, while payments for a new \nenvironmental scheme should do more than just cover \u201cincome forgone\u201d and actually provide a profit to participating \nfarmers.\n\n\u201cIt must also come with an effective delivery mechanism which has been shown to work,\u201d it says. The CLA is \nadvocating a system of land management contracts, including a non-competitive \u201cuniversal\u201d element that most \nfarmers can sign up to, and an \u201cenhanced\u201d element, with extra payments for those who want to take the provision of \npublic goods a stage further.\n\nThe CLA favours a new system of \u201crolling application windows\u201d, with area payments, stand-alone grants and a \u201clight \ntouch\u201d from inspectors.\n\nIt has welcomed the recognition of improved productivity and competitiveness as a public good worthy of support.\n\nNational Sheep Association\n\nTransition and ending direct payments\n\nThe NSA wants a minimum transition period of five years to give farmers time to adapt \u2013 and this should only start \nwhen there is clarity on the terms of trade with the EU, the new Agriculture Bill is on the statute books, and a food \npolicy agreed. As for direct payments, the NSA wants a \u201cfair\u201d percentage cut across all businesses.\n\nBarriers to progress\n\nA lack of core profitability due to high business costs and comparatively low product prices is holding businesses \nback, exacerbated by a culture of cheap food prices. Encouraging young people into agriculture is also constrained \nby a lack of reward. This must be addressed.\n\nCollaboration\n\nThe NSA believes it is beneficial to retain as many individual farm businesses as possible, but to seek scale \nthrough collaboration. A new policy should encourage farmers to work together in areas of research, land \nmanagement initiatives (such as water catchment areas and landscape management), and marketing to increase \nefficiency and negotiating strength.\n\n\n\nFarm support\n\nThe current budget for agriculture should be maintained and funding redirected to support capital investment, \nefficiency improvements (in particular a sheep health scheme), and public goods (including environmental and \nsocial goods).\n\nAnimal welfare\n\nThe NSA does not agree with raising welfare standards per se, as this could raise costs in comparison with \nproduction elsewhere. But it does aspire to raise welfare \u201coutcomes\u201d through investment in health measures to \nimprove productivity, efficiency, carbon footprints and welfare. \n\nDevolved issues\n\nA level regulatory platform between all UK nations is needed, with consistent movement and traceability rules and, \nwithin reason, comparable financial support programmes and no trade disruption within the UK.\n\nSustain \n\nSustain, \u201cthe alliance for better food and farming\u201d, is the umbrella organisation representing about 100 \nenvironmental and agricultural lobby groups. Its members include Compassion in World Farming, the Campaign to \nProtect Rural England, the Family Farmers Association, the Landworkers Alliance, Friends of the Earth, the \nNational Trust and the Soil Association.\n\nIt describes Defra's 64-page consultation document as \u201cuneven\u201d, but says it has some real strengths, in particular \nits focus on the public goods that government should support via regulation, advice, rewards and disincentives.\n\nSustain welcomes the focus on environmental outcomes, and soil and water, as well as biodiversity. But it says \nDefra needs to go further with \u201cdelivering public health outcomes\u201d, including measures based on public \nprocurement, mitigating climate change and organic farming.\n\n\u201cWe need to talk more about growing more, and sustainable fruit and vegetables, less sugar and growing for \nsustainable diets, as well as air pollution, pesticides, access to nature and reducing farm antibiotics,\u201d says \ncampaign co-ordinator Vicki Hird. \u201cIt needs to offer much stronger support for higher animal welfare.\u201d\n\nSustain is especially concerned with ensuring greater fairness in farming matters \u2013 with a better regulated supply \nchain to ensure farmers get a fair price. And it favours \u201ca diversity of farm businesses\u201d, with specific help for smaller \nfarmers.\n\nOn the phasing out of direct payments during the transition period, Sustain says cuts should be deep enough to \ngenerate sufficient funds for new pilot environmental schemes, but the burden should be spread more widely than \njust capping payments to the largest farmers. It suggests linking payments to employment levels, with the smallest \nfarms exempt from cuts.\n\nSustain does not favour the removal of \u201cgreening rules\u201d as part of the transition, but payments should be made \nconditional on delivering public goods.\n\nGenerally, Sustain has expressed concern about the long-term commitment of the Treasury to support Defra\u2019s \nambitions for delivering public goods and a support structure, including grants, advice and better IT.\n\nIt also wants farmworkers to be able to negotiate collectively on wages, \u201cas they can in Scotland, Wales and \nNorthern Ireland\u201d.\n\nNFU Scotland \n\n\n\nEven though the consultation is primarily focused on a new policy for England, it does touch on devolved issues, \nacknowledging the need for some policy divergence, while ensuring the UK single market works properly.\n\nNFU Scotland says it is vital that future agricultural policy meets the distinctly different needs of Scotland. It is \nespecially interested in the frameworks needed to facilitate intra-UK trade and future funding levels for Scottish \nfarming.\n\n\u201cThe UK\u2019s various governments should jointly take every step to retain and protect single market access for food, \nagricultural commodities, live animals and plant and plant products throughout the UK,\u201d says policy director Jonnie \nHall.\n\nNFUS is also seeking a clear statement on future funding levels for agriculture and rural development in Scotland. \n\u201cAt least the same level of public investment in Scottish agriculture must be retained and this budget must be ring-\nfenced to agriculture and rural support.\u201d\n\nSustainable Food Trust \n\nThe Sustainable Food Trust says it supports the high emphasis on sustainability, animal welfare and using public \nmoney for public goods. \u201cIf designed in the right way, such a future support package has the potential to correct the \neconomic distortions which currently exist within food and farming,\u201d it says.\n\nHowever, it cautions against getting rid of area payments per se, because of the \u201csocial security element\u201d of the \ncurrent scheme, which keeps many businesses afloat. \u201cInstead, we believe that many of the desired changes in \nfarming practice would be most effectively delivered through a whole-farm support package, based on land area,\u201d it \nsays.\n\nSuch a scheme could include a number of options, some applicable on a field scale, or even whole-farm scale, and \nsome of a more tailored stewardship nature.\n\nThe Sustainable Food Trust welcomes Defra\u2019s proposed Environmental Land Management Agreement, which is set \nto become the main vehicle for delivering post-Brexit farm support. But it is wary that such an approach might \nperpetuate the separation of food production from nature conservation.\n\n\u201cWe feel that the continued structural separation of nature conservation from food production \u2013 physically, \nfinancially and in the public mindset \u2013 will fail to reverse the catastrophic declines in biodiversity and natural capital \nwhich have occurred over the last 50 years.\u201d\n\nThe trust says it is also concerned about the possibility of significant areas of land being taken out of food \nproduction and given over entirely to nature conservation.\n\n\u201cFor a country which is nowhere near self-sufficient, this will either result in further increases in intensification on the \nareas remaining in production or increased imports of food from countries where environmental and public health \nstandards are not as high.\u201d\n\nA new system of conditional area payments should reward/encourage:\n\nCrop rotations which include a soil fertility building phase\n\nA reduction in the use of chemical fertilisers/pesticides\n\nFarming practices which build soil carbon and promote biodiversity\n\nHigh standards of animal welfare\n\nIncreased employment and staff development\n\n\n\nGreater sales to local processing facilities and markets.\n\nSoil Association \n\nThe Soil Association has expressed its frustration that, while the consultation is entitled \u201cHealth and Harmony\u201d, \nthere is \u201cbugger all\u201d in it about human health.\n\n\u201cThe need to reduce farm antibiotic use gets a mention, as does the possibility that access to green spaces might \nbenefit our wellbeing, but there is so much more to it than this,\u201d says policy director Peter Melchett.\n\n\u201cThe government is keen on the \u2018public money for public goods\u2019 principle, but it has, so far, failed to recognise \npublic health as a public good.\u201d\n\nAs such, the Soil Association is urging government to pay farmers to change their practices, including increasing \nvegetable production, reducing antibiotic usage and getting schoolchildren out onto farms and into green spaces.\n\nLord Melchett also calls for a change in public procurement policy to support British farmers, \u201cparticularly those \nproducing to high quality standards, such as high-welfare food that is good for wildlife and organic\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is still time to stop-the-clock on our declining public health by empowering farmers to join the battle for a \nhealthier Britain. Failure to do so will exacerbate the pressures already on the NHS, entrench already dire diet \ninequalities, and create not \u2018health and harmony\u2019, but worsening ill-health and social disharmony.\u201d\n\nAIC\n\nThe Agricultural Industries Confederation (AIC) says environmental enhancement must be coupled with agricultural \nproduction and support for innovation. Specifically, it wants:\n\nA greater acknowledgement of the need for productive agriculture\n\nIncentives to reward farmers for balancing production and environmental goals\n\nBetter education and training, to improve farm productivity\n\nContinuous professional development that includes environmental management\n\nResearch and development that is more relevant to farmers\u2019 needs  \n\nIncreased sharing of best practice between farmers\n\n \n\nRSPB\n\nA focus on public money for public goods \u2013 rewarding farmers who deliver environmental benefits such as more \nwildlife, cleaner water and carbon storage \u2013 presents the best case for ongoing public investment into farming, \nargues the RSPB.\n\n\u201cA significant increase in investment is needed compared to existing agri-environment schemes,\u201d it says. \u201cDefra \nshould retain, but refocus the overall budget associated with the CAP, in order to drive the restoration of nature that \nwe need.\u201d\n\nAlongside this, the RSPB says the government should develop a Sustainable Food Strategy for England \u2013 including \nmeasures that improve supply chain transparency, help farmers to get a fair return from the market and promote \nmore sustainable, healthy diets.\n\n\n\nRecognising the \u201curgent need\u201d to rebuild the confidence of the farming community in Defra\u2019s ability to deliver \nCountryside Stewardship, the RSPB says Defra's proposed new environmental land management scheme should \nlearn lessons and build on the best of previous initiatives.\n\nRecognising the scale of change faced by farmers, the RSPB says Defra should establish a transition fund to help \nfarmers adapt to life after direct payments. This would provide support for succession planning, business \nmanagement advice and new entrants.\n\n\u201cSecuring a stable transition will be essential in making a success of a new, expanded environmental land \nmanagement system,\u201d says the RSPB. So too will proper enforcement of rules that maintain high environmental \nstandards.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nMore than 4,000 people have signed a petition calling for tougher sanctions and a change in the law to combat \nlivestock worrying in Scotland.\n\nIt comes amid an ongoing NFU Scotland campaign, which is pursuing several legislative changes to tackle the \nproblem of dog attacks against livestock.\n\nThis spring saw repeated incidents where irresponsible dog owners allowed livestock to be killed or maimed by \ndogs, said the union.\n\nSee also: Investigation \u2013 Police

\u201cDespite a vast amount of awareness raising, livestock \nworrying remains a blight on Scottish livestock farming.\n\n\u201cDogs themselves are not to blame, it's their irresponsible owners who need to wake up and understand the \ndevastation this is causing.\u201d\n\nThe five areas NFU Scotland wants included in any new legislative framework are:\n\nLivestock worrying becomes a recordable crime\n\nDogs to be kept on a lead around sheep\n\nPolice powers to issue dog control notices\n\nPolice powers to obtain evidence, seize dogs and have dogs destroyed\n\nFines levied on offenders and full compensation to farmers\n\nMr Kennedy said: \u201cThis is a real opportunity to clamp down on the issue once and for all \u2013 hopefully saving our \nmembers immeasurable heartache and considerable financial losses.\"\n\n\n\nSouth Scotland SNP MSP Emma Harper recently announced that she will bring forward a proposal for a Private \nMembers Bill to ramp up the law.\n\nTrauma and devastation\n\nThe petition was presented to Ms Harper at the Royal Highland Show on Thursday (21 June).\n\nSpeaking ahead of the event, she said: \u201cThe trauma and devastating effects for all who are involved or witness \nlivestock worrying needs to be addressed.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the petition, 120 people completed a questionnaire related to livestock worrying.\n\nSurvey finding suggest only 47% of livestock worrying incidents are reported to the police \u2013 with 53% of \nrespondents stating they suffered unclaimed financial losses.\n\nMr Kennedy said NFU Scotland would continue to engage strongly with the legislative process to ensure robust \nenforcement of the law.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs always, we urge our members to continue to report all incidents of livestock worrying to Police \nScotland.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA looming threat to cereal and rapeseed prices has been stopped after plans to cut the use of crop-based biofuels \nin the transport sector was abandoned by European politicians.\n\nA compromise on revising the EU Renewable Energy Directive in Europe post-2020 was agreed by the European \nCommission (EC), European Parliament and the Council of Ministers at a meeting on 14 June.\n\nCrucially for farmers, plans put forward by the EC to reduce the cap on crop-based biofuels from 7% of total road \nand transport fuels in 2021 to 3.8% by 2030 (over concerns about using food as fuel) do not appear in the final \nagreement.\n\nSee also: Threat to crop-based biofuels grows\n\nFarm leaders expressed relief saying this should help to underpin demand for biofuels produced from UK-grown \nwheat or oilseed rape over the long-term.\n\nIt includes a binding renewable energy target for the EU of 32% by 2020 with an upwards revision clause for 2023.\n\nFuel suppliers will also be obliged to make sure that by 2030 at least 14% of the fuel used for transport comes from \nrenewable sources.\n\nSuccessful lobbying\n\nTori Morgan, NFU combinable crops adviser, said the NFU had been lobbying hard on the directive to help protect \nthe UK\u2019s export markets.\n\nAbout 40% of all UK oilseed rape ends up being turned into biodiesel on the continent, so if the markets were \nrestricted then this could reduce demand for UK growers.\n\n\u201cWhether we\u2019re inside or outside of Europe we will still be wanting to make use of those markets,\u201d she said.\n\nMs Morgan said overall the NFU was relatively pleased with the final deal, which was considerably better than it \ncould have been.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the initial proposals there were no specific transport targets, so it is positive the obligation to keep blending \nbiofuels with fossil fuel is still there,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe initial proposals also wanted to phase down the level of crop-based biofuels to 3.8% and that\u2019s all gone, so \nthese are all positive things.\u201d\n\nEuropean lobbying group Copa/Cogeca said it believed the agreement was going \u201cin the right direction\u201d, although it \nstill had points of concern.\n\nPekka Pesonen, secretary-general, said the deal offered biofuel producers a long-term stable framework to work \nwith.\n\n\u201cWe regret, however, that EU crop-based biofuels will not have the opportunity to expand because the phasing out \nof the use of palm oil has been postponed, especially since EU crop-based biofuels generate protein rich co-\nproducts for use in feed which livestock producers need.\n\n\u201cThey also play a bigger role in stabilising agricultural markets facing increasing volatility.\u201d\n\nUK targets\n\nIn April 2018, the government introduced revised targets for the use of biofuels under its renewable transport fuel \nobligation (RTFO).\n\nThe main change was to more than double the target for the amount of biofuels used in transport from 4.75% to \n9.75% in 2020, and 12.4% in 2032, a move which was welcomed by the farming industry.\n\nHowever, in a bid to encourage the use of more \u201cadvanced\u201d biofuels the RTFO does set a maximum cap for crop-\nbased biofuels of 4% in 2018, reducing annually from 2021 to reach 3% in 2026 and 2% in 2032.\n\nFuture fuels\n\nMeanwhile, parliamentarians have thrown their weight behind a campaign to get the government to adopt E10 \npetrol standards in the UK.\n\nNeil Parish, chairman of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs select committee and Nic Dakin, chairman of the \nAll Party Parliamentary Group for British Bioethanol, have written to ministers calling for the introduction of E10 by \nthe end of the year.\n\nE10 is regular unleaded petrol blended with 10% bioethanol \u2013 and is the biggest selling petrol in France, Belgium \nand Finland.\n\nIt also accounts for 95% of petrol sales in the US.\n\nThe UK only sells E5 petrol (a 5% blend) but it has been estimated that doubling the level of bioethanol in petrol \nsupplies would be the equivalent of removing 700,000 cars from the road, as well as bringing a boost to the farming \nindustry.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nStore cattle supplies have tightened across Europe, further strengthening prime beef values into 2018 in the face of \nstrong demand for manufacturing beef demand.\n\nDeadweight prime cattle prices have rocketed more than 6p/kg since the end of March and almost 11p/kg since the \nend of February, as huge cull cow numbers continue to see sufficient demand to support strong trade across the \nbeef market.\n\n\n\nGreat British cull cows have topped this year so far at a deadweight average of 260.3p/kg on 21 April, coming back \nslightly into May to 258p/kg, up 17p/kg on the year.\n\nMarket updates from AHDB analyst Rebecca Oborne suggest prime cattle supplies are tightening, with QMS \nanalyst Richard Ashworth stating that national and Europe-wide figures suggest numbers will remain constrained \nthis summer.\n\nSee also: Cattle prices firm into March as snow clears\n\nMr Ashworth said: \u201cWith BCMS data showing a fall in the number of 12- to 18-month old cattle on GB holdings at \nthe turn of the year, there is little likelihood of increased slaughter stock numbers in the medium term.\u201d\n\nIrish cattle are 4% dearer on the year, while across Europe, one-year-old cattle numbers were back 1.6% in \nDecember and two-year-olds back 0.7%.\n\nAnalysts still point to a weak pound helping UK exports, with a euro worth about 88p. Meanwhile, the markets wait \nto see if a typical seasonal summer price lift is felt.\n\nSelby\n\nSupplies are looking tight around the Selby area, where cattle prices have been consistently firm in 2018, according \nto auctioneer Richard Haigh.\n\nHe told Farmers Weekly he has been managing to keep numbers up, but with trade strong, there has been an \nincentive for finishers to sell.\n\nRecent weeks have seen bulls make 160-180p/kg for black and whites, beef-bred bulls hit 215-225p/kg and the \nbest make 220-230p/kg or even up to 240p/kg.\n\nLast Wednesday\u2019s sale (9 May) saw 51 steers average 220p/kg and heifer numbers lift 57% on the week to see 183 \nentries level at 228p/kg.\n\n\u201cGoing through the summer we will probably see supplies a bit tighter, but feeders seem to keeping numbers up \nreasonably well, which will have been difficult this spring because store cattle have been a good price. Once we get \ninto later summer and harvest time, prime cattle are typically harder to find anyway.\"\n\nMarket Drayton\n\nNumbers are \u201cabout on par\u201d at Market Drayton, where Bernie Hutchinson of Barbers Auctions is seeing in the \nregion of 100 bulls and 100-120 clean cattle every Wednesday.\n\nTrade has strengthened 5-10p/kg on the month, and has been strong this year generally, with a large proportion of \ndairy-bred cattle coming from the region. Steers and heifers have regularly averaged 200p/kg or more, with \nstronger, beef-bred animals at 240-250p/kg, Mr Hutchinson told Farmers Weekly.\n\nHe said supplies of cattle looked to be tight on finishing units in his area, adding that good prices have encourage \nstrong cattle to be sold. However, the late spring has slowed down the progress of the grass-fed cattle.\n\n\u201cHeavier stores have been slaughtered already in some cases and there may not be enough cattle coming \nthrough,\u201d said Mr Hutchinson. \u201cIn terms of grass cattle, they need a bit longer. Turnout was late, but there is \nsuddenly an abundance of grass now.\n\n\"I think trade should hold pretty firm or see a slight increase.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\n\n\nRed meat producers in Scotland are likely to see strong prices for beef and lamb for the remainder of the year as \ntight supplies give farmers the upper hand over buyers.\n\nDeadweight cattle prices are standing at near-record levels with R4L grade cattle selling to 385p/kg and Angus up \nto 435p/kg according to data published by Farm Stock Scotland, while deadweight lamb prices are some 30p/kg \nahead of last year at 540-570p/kg.\n\nScottish farmers were among the worst affected in the country by one of the most challenging springs for many \nyears said Stuart Ashworth, director of economic services at QMS.\n\nSee also: Six ways livestock farmers can improve carcass eating quality\n\nHowever, rising costs of production mean profit margins are unlikely to be as high as last year, as it will be difficult \nto pass these along, he warned.\n\nHe said many farmers were warning their lamb supplies were likely to be some 10% lower than the previous year \nafter bad weather battered farms during lambing season meaning there will be more competition for those that \nmake it to market.\n\nThe knock-on effect is already being seen in-lamb supplies across the country, with AHDB data showing the \nnumber of new-season lambs sold was a third lower last week than the comparable week last year.\n\nIn the year to date, there have been 26% fewer new-season lambs sold through auction markets but more are \ncoming forward each week.\n\nBeef prices also up\n\nHigh prices are also being recorded for finished cattle, as concerns also increase about sufficient beef supplies \ncoming to market, with calf birth registrations declining in Scotland for the second year in a row in 2017.\n\nMr Ashworth said production levels were still higher than five years ago, but the average volume of meat from each \ncarcass is falling as producers respond to market signals favouring lighter animals.\n\nThis contributed to a fall in the total amount of meat produced in Scottish abattoirs, which was down 3.9% in 2017 \non the previous year to about 212,000t, although turnover increased by \u00a332m, according to QMS data in their \nannual profile of the Scottish red meat industry, launched on Monday (18 June).\n\nHe warned it was crucial volumes were maintained for the sake of processors, as they, like farmers, are operating \non very tight margins, and preserving the processing sector was vital for the health of the overall industry.\n\nHigh prices since the Brexit referendum have been largely underpinned by the devaluation in the pound, and Mr \nAshworth said farmers needed clarity about their future as soon as possible in order for them to make appropriate \nplans to adapt.\n\nUntil trade deals were finalised, major decisions such as which enterprises to invest in and which to scale down \ncould not be made, he said.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nSoaring timber and firewood prices should act as an incentive for more farmers to consider planting trees or better \nmanage areas of existing woodland on their farms, according to forestry body Confor.\n\nFigures from the Forestry Commission show timber prices have risen by almost 30% in a year and are nearly \ndouble the level of a decade ago.\n\n\n\nThe statistics show a 28.2% surge in the price of standing timber \u2013 trees which have not yet been harvested \u2013 from \nMarch 2017 to March 2018.\n\nSee also: Thriving UK forestry market increases demand for farmland\n\nThe average price for coniferous standing sales is now about \u00a324.64/cu m overbark (this means it includes the bark \nin the

technical director, said prices were even higher in some regional hotspots, including Wales \nand Dumfries and Galloway in southern Scotland.\n\nFirewood prices had also risen and were about

supplies\n\nWith demand for timber predicted to remain high at a domestic and global level, Confor is calling for a long-term \napproach to forestry to secure future supply.\n\n\u201cScotland is increasing planting rates but the rest of the UK is lagging behind and the supply crisis will only get \nworse in the years and decades to come unless we tackle this problem now,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThese statistics highlight the need for forestry and wood processing to be a much more central focus of the rural \neconomy after Brexit.\u201d\n\nMr Heald said many farmers and landowners were realising the benefits of planting part of their land with trees.\n\n\u201cFor those who already have trees, but have maybe not managed them well \u2013 or who have timber in hard-to-access \nlocations \u2013 now is the time to have that asset valued and look at realising a great price.\n\n\u201cWhen you have done that, you can replant the land and then consider extending the area covered by trees.\u201d\n\nLocation specific\n\nMr Heald told Farmers Weekly the size at which a woodland would become a viable proposition for timber was very \nlocation specific.\n\n\u201cYou could have a small woodland of 4-5ha, which is near a road and easy to work, but if it is down a narrow track \nthen you might need 10-15ha,\u201d he said.\n\nFarmers who wanted to cut and sell timber would need a felling license before they proceeded, he said.\n\n\nThey could obtain this direct from the Forestry Commission, although it might be advisable to first contact a \nprofessional forester through the Institute of Chartered Foresters to get some advice on the best way to manage the \nproject and how to market the wood.\n\nSee also: Could your farm woodlands generate a new income stream?\n\nThe push for plantings\n\nThe UK is the world\u2019s second largest net importer of timber after China, but the creation of new woodland in \nEngland is at a 46-year low.\n\nStrong demand for timber is coming from the construction sector, pallet market, as well as from the agricultural and \ngarden fence sector, biomass and woodchip industries.\n\nTo increase domestic supplies and reduce the UK\u2019s reliance on imports, Confor has identified key areas in the north \nand west of England which it says should be designated as forestry investment zones with the aim of promoting \nlarge-scale woodland creation.\n\nIt says these are areas with land suitable for timber production and with sizeable timber processing facilities already \nlocated in the vicinity.\n\nThe first investment zone it has selected is in Cumbria, with other local authority areas as follows:\n\nNorthumberland County Council\n\nDurham County Council \n\nNorth Yorkshire County

future, according to one expert.\n\nThe EU has moved to ban three key neonic insecticides for use as seed treatments for all crops outside \nglasshouses by the end of this year.\n\nThese three insecticide actives \u2013 imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam \u2013 have already been banned for use \nin flowering crops such as oilseed rape since 2013, but now the ban is being extended to key crops like winter \ncereals and sugar beet.\n\nSee also: Farm\u2019s self-imposed insecticide ban leads to healthier crops\n\nFor wheat growers, there is one last season as the actives will be available until 19 December.\n\n\n\nHowever, the concern is that BYDV could proliferate after the use-up period has expired, according to Dr Steve \nFoster, entomologist at Rothamsted Research.\n\n\u201cSeed treatments have done a good job at protecting crops against insects,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThey have given up to six weeks protection at a time when the crop was most vulnerable, helping to limit the \nspread of the disease and allowing growers to manage their autumn workloads.\u201d\n\nVirus levels\n\nThere are three aphid species that are responsible for the transmission of the virus in both wheat and barley in the \nautumn, he says.\n\n\u201cWe can screen them for virus levels, so we know that around 10% are currently carrying the virus, which is low.\n\n\u201cHowever, it\u2019s not clear what will happen to those levels in the future. Using the oilseed rape example, we do know \nthat the amount of turnip yellows virus has gone up to 80% in the peach potato aphid population.\u201d  \n\nWithout alternatives, there is every reason to believe that virus levels in aphids will rise over the next five years, just \nas they have in aphids of brassica crops, he warns.\n\nThe grain, bird cherry-oat and rose-grain aphid species can all transmit BYDV \u2013 so there\u2019s a need to control all \nthree, especially where aphids are still flying into cereal crops in mild autumn and winter conditions.\n\n\u201cAfter the winter of 2018, growers will only have pyrethroids to fall back on,\u201d says Dr Foster.\n\n\u201cThere is already target-site resistance to pyrethroids in the grain aphid, so it\u2019s really important to keep rates up. We \nare right on the edge of resistance becoming a major issue.\u201d\n\nMonitoring is crucial for two reasons, he continues. \u201cWe need to know about pest numbers, so that we only spray \nwhen thresholds are breached, and we need to keep a track of the spread of resistance.\u201d\n\nThe other consideration for growers is that pyrethroids aren\u2019t great news for beneficial insects, so their use should \nbe considered carefully.\n\n\u201cThere are some new insecticides on the way, but they won\u2019t be here soon. For now, we are very limited in our \nchoices.\u201d\n\nLate drilling\n\nDrilling later is one option, as it avoids the crop being exposed when most of the aphids are flying, stresses \nagronomist Jock Willmott of Strutt and Parker.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine to do that with winter wheat, but there will still be a problem in winter barley,\u201d he reports. \u201cBarley crops \nneed to be in the ground by the end of September.\u201d\n\nTemperature will also have a bearing, as aphids will continue to move into crops if it is mild, even into December.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t survive at very low temperatures below freezing, but the crop does give them some insulation and \nprotection from the cold.\u201d\n\nFive ways to protect against BYDV\n\nConsider later drilling\n\nDelayed drilling will minimise BYDV infection in most years. Success will come down to seasonal conditions, as \naphid flight, population development and movement within the crop is dependent on temperature.\n\n\n\nMonitor crops\n\nUse alert services to understand the number of aphids flying in the autumn and keep a record of temperatures.\n\nSpray insecticides where necessary\n\nThe only option where aphids are at or above threshold, pyrethroid insecticides are already affected by resistance \nin some aphid species. Use the full recommended rate and only spray where necessary.\n\nCultivations\n\nGreen plant material left between crops can act as a \u2018green bridge\u2019 and help aphids colonise new crops. \nCultivations can be used to bury these materials and create a clean start, although they may also have an effect on \npopulations of beneficial insects.\n\nAlternatives\n\nIn the future, there are likely to be BYDV-tolerant varieties of barley, with plant breeders working hard to bring them \nto the market.\n\nThe effects of BYDV\n\nThe grain aphid and bird cherry\u2013oat aphid are the main vectors of BYDV, which is most damaging when young \nplants are infected in autumn.\n\nInfections cause leaf yellowing and stunting, initially confined to single plants scattered randomly in a field but later \ndeveloping into distinct circular patches, sometimes merging into extensive infection as secondary spread occurs.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe EU\u2019s top court has upheld Brussels\u2019 partial ban on neonicotinoid pesticides, rejecting legal challenges from \nagrochemical companies Bayer CropScience and Syngenta.\n\nIn December 2013, the European Commission (EC) announced a ban on the use of three neonicotinoid pesticides \nafter scientists linked their use with harm to bees.\n\nThe ban covered the use of the three actives, Bayer\u2019s imidacloprid and clothianidin and Syngenta\u2019s thiamethoxam, \nfor use on flowering crops considered attractive to bees, such as oilseed rape, maize and sunflowers.\n\nSee also: Can sugar beet survive a future without neonicotinoids?\n\nLast month, EU member states extended the neonics ban to cover all outdoor crops, including sugar beet.\n\nBayer and Syngenta had launched a legal case at the EU\u2019s General Court (GC) challenging the EC\u2019s 2013 partial \nban on neonicotinoids.\n\nBut the GC ruled the commission had correctly applied its \u201cprecautionary principle\u201d, which \u201cgives precedence to the \nrequirements relating to the protection of public health, safety and the environment over economic interest\u201d.\n\nChemical giants react\n\nSyngenta said the court\u2019s ruling was \u201cdisappointing and unfortunate\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe stand by our past decision to challenge the EC\u2019s decision-making process concerning thiamethoxam, as it \nrelied on a hypothetical risk to implement partial restrictions, on neonicotinoids, outside legally approved regulation,\u201d \nsaid Syngenta, in a statement.\n\n\n\nBayer said it remained \u201cconvinced of the safety of its products when applied in accordance with the label \ninstructions\u201d. \n\nThe company said it will review the verdict in detail and assess its consequences and potential legal options.\n\nOlder chemistry\n\nBoth companies have warned banning neonics will result in growers using older chemistry which could be more \nharmful for the environment and pollinators.\n\nThe Agricultural Industries Confederation (AIC) expressed disappointment at the ruling and said it firmly believes in \nan approval system that is based on scientific evidence, independent review and an assessment of impacts, rather \nthan politics. \n\n\u201cEffective modern crop protection products are an essential part of meeting UK government\u2019s drive to raise \nproductivity while enhancing the environment,\u201d said Hazel Doonan, head of AIC\u2019s crop protection sector.\n\nBut Greenpeace welcomed the decision as a victory for bees. Its EU food policy adviser Franziska \nAchterberg said: \u201cThe ruling sets the EU\u2019s priorities straight \u2013 its primary duty is to protect people and nature, not \ncompany profit margins.\u201d\n\nIn a separate ruling, however, the GC annulled measures restricting the use of BASF\u2019s pesticide fipronil, since they \nwere imposed by the EC in 2013 \u201cwithout a prior impact assessment\u201d.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nHere on the Machinery desk at Farmers Weekly we love a farm invention.

Geringhoff marketing manager Joel Dennis says this innovation has cut field losses to almost zero.\n\nThe system captures grain that might otherwise fall to the ground and be left on the field surface, to chit and grow.\n\nA distribution tube extends across the back of the header platform, feeding air into smaller tubes that reach down to \nthe knives. This helps to gather a majority of the grain, even in over-ripe crops where seed shattering is inevitable.\n\nIt fits to the company's 10.6m or 12.3m headers, which are different from all other draper models in that they have a \nflexible frame, cutter bar and reel that allows them to follow uneven terrain.\n\nThe cutting bar can flex up or down by 12in across the full width of the ground-hugging header to gather lodged and \nsmall-seeded crops, with height control allowing each frame section to follow contours independently.\n\n\n\nPowered pickup tailgate cuts out lifting\n\nHaving an extra pair of hands to help you shift heavy loads on to the back of a pickup can save your back \u2013 but \nalso cost you money in wages.\n\nHowever, a new electric tailgate made by Handy Gate uses the existing tailgate and power from the truck's \nstandard seven-pin trailer plug to easily raise loads from ground level to the pickup bed.\n\nThe unit comes with a 10in floor extension to accommodate the two tall lift assemblies which are fitted in place of \nthe tailgate\u2019s hinges, allowing the tailgate to hinge open and shut as normal.\n\nEach lift unit is operated by a PCB motor, with an on-off switch located on top of the assemblies. Dual motors keep \nthe tailgate level, with each assembly working from a screw shaft with ball bearings that roll along the threads.\n\nAccording to the company, the tailgate lift can easily lift loads up to 450kg, which makes it ideal for moving \ngenerators, motorcycles, wacker plates or multiple chemical cans, along with other materials.\n\nThe unit doesn\u2019t touch the pickup's bumper or require any modifications to the body and can be fitted in minutes \nusing only a screwdriver and ratchet, says the firm.\n\nThe tailgate lift will fit all US Ford, GM, Chevy and Dodge pickups under nine years old and costs $2,299 (\u00a31,646).\n\nShear-bolt monitor keeps tabs on cultivator tines\n\nA new monitoring system automatically detects broken shear-bolts on cultivating legs and lets the operator know \ninstantly when one snaps and needs replacing.\n\nPrecision Ag 360, based in Hancock, Minnesota, introduced its retrofit Shank Patrol monitor at the recent Iowa \nPower Farming Show in Des Moines.\n\nThe patent-pending system consists of an in-cab LED monitor, wire harnesses, mounting brackets, sensors and \nmagnets. It can be installed on conventional cultivators or muckspreaders that have shear-bolt protection.\n\nA simple bracket bolts on to each leg along with the sensor, magnet and wiring, so no fabrication or welding is \nnecessary. The sensor detects when a leg is out of its correct position and shows a lit LED and an audible alarm on \nthe in-cab monitor. Handily, once you install a new shear-bolt the system automatically resets itself. \n\nUnit price is specific to the model and number of rows but, as a guide, a system for an 11-leg cultivator should be \nless than $5,000 (\u00a33,580).\n\nElectronic depth control kit offers wireless control\n\nA new electronic depth control kit made by Graham Equipment, based in Sterling, Colorado, uses an electric \nactuator and self-contained hydraulic cylinder to offer more responsive and accurate pressure than using \nconventional springs.\n\nThe unit can be retrofitted to any planter, slotting into the place of an existing spring. It contains 4in actuators that \npressurise the hydraulic cylinders, creating the downward pressure.\n\nIf the kit is used through the firm\u2019s Command Pro touchscreen monitor the system can be controlled wirelessly \nusing the same power supply, with a control board relaying information to the cab screen.\n\nWe\u2019re told that each system can offer more than 450kg of pressure and the responsive actuators can alter this by \nup to 45kg at a time.\n\n\n\nThe company is releasing the wireless electronic depth control kit this spring. It retails at $1,200 (\u00a3860) per row, or \n$2,300 (\u00a31,650) per row with the firm\u2019s electric planter drive kit.\n\nTelescopic gate adjusts to multiple openings\n\nAn adjustable opening gate made from galvanised steel tubing could be just the space saving device needed in \ncramped older dairies or lambing pens.  \n\nSturdy Built, based in Denver, Pennsylvania, makes gates that have an extendable end to adapt to multiple widths, \nso one gate can be used to shut off different sized gaps.\n\nGates are available in widths up to 20ft and are built to order at different heights and widths, with galvanised tubing \nused because it has a higher strength-to-weight ratio than other materials.\n\nThey mount on standard brackets so no welding is required.\n\nWireless fertiliser blockage sensor keeps drills running\n\nA new wireless flow blockage sensor installed on Montag\u2019s air delivery applicators is designed to monitor the \nplacement of fertiliser on a seed drill.\n\nDeveloped in Brazil by J.Assy, the Visum wireless flow blockage sensor was on display at the Iowa Power Farming \nShow in Des Moines, where it was installed on a Montag granular fertiliser applicator hooked up to a strip-till drill.\n\nThe donut-shaped monitor is installed in-line on each row and contains a sensor that sends out radio signals, \npowered by a lithium-ion battery. A rubber coupling on either side of the monitor clamps on to the machine\u2019s hose, \ncreating an air-tight seal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s virtually maintenance-free, which makes it much more reliable than wire-type monitor systems,\u201d says William \nMontag of the family-owned company based in Emmetsburg, Iowa.\n\n\u201cThe sensor is on only when it senses motion. When fertiliser stops flowing past it, a monitor in the tractor cab \nbeeps and shows which row isn\u2019t performing,\u201d says Mr Montag.\n\n\u201cThe battery is designed to last for up to 2,000 hours.\u201d\n\nHe says the monitor has been used primarily to apply dry fertiliser in strip-till and no-till applications.\n\nUnder-blade sweeps break subsoil pans\n\nAl Hemerson\u2019s new Finish Line Sweeps solve a problem that farmers may not even realise they have.\n\nModern cultivators and shallow subsoilers might lift and till the soil, but they also compact the soil below the working \ndepth, he says. This resulting dense soil layer slows root development for deeper-rooting crops such as oilseed \nrape. \n\nFinish Line Sweeps have a knife blade on the bottom of the tine that fractures the soil below just as the point and \nwings disturb the soil above.\n\nThe under-blade cuts a path 70mm deep, which is enough to break the compacted layer and allow the hair-like \nroots to penetrate through.\n\nMr Hemerson says an upside-down jet aircraft\u2019s tail is the best way to describe the sweep\u2019s under-blade. Indeed he \ngot the idea when driving past an airport.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe backward-sweeping angle fractures the density layer, but it also slides up and over underground large \nobstacles without a problem,\u201d he says.\n\nMr Hemerson tested the design on his John Deere 725 soil finisher and saw immediate results with vertical relief \npatterns in the soil. After getting a patent, he shared the idea with Wiese Industries.\n\nThey quickly adapted the concept to their Viper bolt-on sweeps, which are currently priced at $20 (\u00a314).\n\nWheeled workshop is fully loaded with tools\n\nGlen Wasmuth has a built a wheeled workshop that allows him to transport all his tools around the yard instead of \nmoving the machine to the tools.\n\nHis wheeled treasure chest is filled with tools of all sizes, from spanners and grinders to a cutting torch, drill press \nand welder, along with a selection of machine parts.\n\nThe worktop is made of 9.5mm steel and measures a huge 762mm by 1,820mm. The whole thing is  3m long and \nweighs more than a ton, but can be wheeled around the yard by one person, with the front axle spinning by 90deg \nto help with corners.\n\nThe front end has a 1.8m towbar with 8in wheels salvaged from a combine pickup reel, while the rear axle rides on \n12in wheels from a John Deere weeder.\n\nThe drill press and cutting torch are mounted over the front axle, as are drill bits and a propane tank for the gas \ntorch. The moveable workbench has its own circuit breaker box with individual breakers for the welder, 5hp \ncompressor and circular saw.\n\nA 20-drawer mechanic\u2019s chest holding parts and tools sits at the rear end of the work area, with more drawers \nbeneath the work surface.\n\nAn adjustable shop light mounted over the work surface makes sure jobs are well lit, while a rack over the \nmechanics chest carries welding helmets and angle grinders.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nBritain\u2019s biggest flour miller, Whitworths, is urging wheat growers to produce very high quality grain which could \nreplace imports and help shield them from the uncertainties of Brexit.\n\nThe privately-owned group is looking to substitute German and Canadian imports, and so reduce the 500,000t \nannual need for very high specification wheat to make wholemeal loaves and bagels.\n\nNew bakeries currently being  built in the UK are looking for 14%-plus protein wheat, so the miller is appealing to \ngrowers to try to meet home needs rather than growing a mountain of feed wheat for export.\n\nRaich Growdridge, purchasing director at Whitworth Brothers, warns that wheat imports from the European Union \nmay become more expensive after Brexit, so there is a clear opportunity for UK growers.\n\n\u201cWe would love this wheat to be grown in the UK. If we ever see 14% domestic wheat it does not show good \nfunctional protein,\u201d he says.\n\nThe company has linked up with independent plant breeder Bill Angus, grain trading giant Glencore and agronomy \ngroup Agrii to look at a Hungarian wheat variety to try to meet this need.\n\nSee also: Wheat grower\u2019s 6-point plan to hitting top milling grade\n\nBread basket \n\n\n\nMr Angus, who selected the variety for the UK market, sees it as a wheat for East Anglia, the bread basket of the \nUK, with its high sunshine levels and dry climate, but it also could be grown south of a line between the River \nHumber and River Avon at Bristol.\n\n\u201cIt has been test baked with three independent bakers over three years with positive results, showing surprisingly \ngood hagbergs and strong protein,\u201d says Mr Angus.\n\nFour farmers are currently growing the variety, named Mv Fredericia, with an enlarged group of growers set to drill \n1,000ha this autumn, and then the seed will be more widely available next year.\n\nWhitworths, which mills 1.3m tonnes of wheat annually at its 13 mills \u2013 including Whitworth Brothers and Carr\u2019s \nFlour Mills \u2013 has seen little of the variety, but Mr Growdridge says it shows definite promise to fill the industry\u2019s need \nfor top quality wheat.\n\n\u201cWe have seen limited quantities of the variety so far, but it has baked at least as well as German wheats,\u201d he says.\n\nBakery demand\n\nMr Growdridge adds that the arrival of Aldi and Lidl supermarkets has shaken up the UK baking sector, with bakery \ngroups that supply the two retailers from continental Europe moving to Britain. The firms are currently building two \nnew plants and have 3-4 more in the pipeline.\n\nThese bakers are looking for wheat at 14% protein, hagberg 300 and specific weight 78kg/hl, compared with \nstandard UK millers\u2019 demand  of 13% protein, hagberg 250 and specific weight 76kg/hl.\n\nMr Angus\u2019s Hungarian variety may not hit this top quality, but the key will be protein functionality and how it bakes, \nand so help replace some of the German and Canadian imports which are priced at about \u00a310-30/t over standard \nUK milling wheats.\n\nQualities Whitworths is looking for in milling wheats\n\nConsistency\n\nProtein\n\nGluten quantity and quality \n\nFunctionality \n\nIdeally a good specific weight\n\nStandard Class 1 \u2013 13% protein, 250 hagberg, 76kg/hl specific weight. In most circumstances this is perfectly \nadequate\n\nHigher specification \u2013 14% protein, 300 hagberg, 78kg/hl specific weight\n\nFocus on quality\n\nJames Maw, managing director of Glencore Agriculture UK, also urges growers to focus on quality wheats rather \nthan feed wheat, as he does not see a big future for exports of these feed grains.\n\n\u201cGrowing this type of quality wheat gives more growers more opportunities as they are closer to the end user than \nthose in the middle of Germany or the Canadian prairies,\u201d he says.\n\nCurrently, German elite or E wheats come into the UK tariff-free, while Canadian hard red spring wheat also comes \ninto UK tariff-free if over 15.2% protein, or with a 90/t tariff if under this level.\n\n\n\nAfter Britain leaves the EU next year, it is unclear what, if any tariff, will apply to UK imports from EU nations like \nGermany and to non-EU nations like Canada.\n\nWith Britain importing about 22% of its annual milling wheat need, or 800,000-900,000t out of the total requirement \nof 3.7m tonnes, Mr Maw says farmers need to be focused on growing wheats that the market needs.\n\n\u201cIf we are importing 300,000 to 400,000t of German wheat, why not grow it on our doorstep,\u201d he says.\n\nRisks from Brexit\n\nGrowing this type of wheat will help growers manage the risks from Brexit and also reduce the carbon footprint of \nwheat production, adds Mr Maw.\n\nThe tie-up between Glencore and Agrii could be similar to that suppling spring malting barley of the variety Explorer \nat a higher nitrogen content than traditional to brew Budweiser beer, which currently amounts to 75,000t per year.\n\nMr Angus and Agrii will be working out an agronomy package to manage the variety to yield a modest 8-9t/ha and \nget it close to the high milling specification.\n\nThe variety is ideally late sown at the end of October, is early to harvest in late July and is probably 5% lower \nyielding than milling mainstay variety Skyfall.\n\n\u201cEarly maturity will always lead to lower yields, you can not compare Usain Bolt with Mo Farah,\u201d he adds.\n\nHungarian variety \n\nAlthough some German wheats grown in the UK have been weak-strawed and susceptible to UK-specific diseases \nsuch as septoria and yellow rust, this awned Hungarian variety is showing generally good disease resistance as it \nwas bred in a country with low fungicide use, says Mr Angus.\n\nHe suggests growers should monitor the variety for mildew, and fast-developing brown rust late in the season, while \nlodging could be an issue in thick crops. It has a good septoria resistance and a specific weight to match top-\nperformer Costello.\n\nThe variety is in national list trials but will not go into recommended list trials, as Mr Angus argues it will not fit well \ninto these trials as it is very early maturing at -4, compared to traditional early variety Cordiale at -2 and old \nfavourite Diego at 0.\n\nAnother big flour miller, ADM, is encouraging farmers to grow the German E wheat variety Montana bred by KWS \nwith a target to produce 14% protein wheat.\n\nDisease ratings from national list trials for Mv Fredericia\n\nMildew - 6\n\nSeptoria - 6/7\n\nYellow rust - 8\n\nBrown rust - 6\n\nFusarium - good\n\nWhy the name?\n\n\n\nAll varieties from the Hungarian breeder Martonvaras are prefixed with Mv, while Federicia was the name of the first \npirate radio ship transmitting Radio Caroline in the 1960s, which shattered the BBC radio monopoly and changed \nthe world of radio.\n\nCurrent crops\n\nSteve Corbett, senior agronomist at Agrii, says 23.3% of certified winter wheat seed currently in the ground is of \nGroup 1 milling varieties, nearly double that of four years ago. But this has not particularly helped the millers as \nmuch of it does not reach milling standards.\n\nTop varieties being grown currently are Skyfall, Siskin, Graham, Crusoe, Costello and Kerrin, with Skyfall and \nCrusoe being Group 1 milling varieties and another miller Zyatt is seventh.\n\nIn Agrii trials, the Hungarian variety along with old milling favourite Soissons and Crusoe gave the best protein \nlevels, while it performed best for yield and grain protein at a relatively modest nitrogen level of 200-250kg/ha.\n\nIn competition against blackgrass, it came top alongside Bennington, emphasising its usefulness in combating the \ngrassweed.\n\n\u201cThe speed of growth in the spring is impressive as it sees strong growth before the blackgrass wakes up,\u201d says Mr \nCorbett.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nPests are particularly troublesome during establishment, as small oilseed rape plants are very vulnerable to attack \nand severe infestations can wipe out parts of a field.\n\nAll too often, oilseed rape is emerging in dry conditions, which slows growth and gives pests more time to inflict \nfeeding damage.\n\nAn integrated approach to pest control, using more than one technique, is the best way to minimise attacks and \nensure crops survive the early onslaught.\n\nNeonicotinoid-treated seed cannot be planted, following the EU\u2019s ban on such products on all outdoor crops.\n\nSee also: Oilseed rape variety proves its worth in charlock-infested field\n\n1. Slugs\n\nGerminating oilseed rape is extremely vulnerable to feeding by slugs, with the grey field slug being the most \ncommon problem.\n\nThe most damage is done to seedlings, as the growing point of a germinating oilseed rape shoot is above the \nground. Plants remain susceptible right up until the four-true-leaf stage.\n\nAs a result, oilseed rape crops should be monitored regularly for slug damage. Estimating the size of the slug \npopulation present should be done in the field with refuge traps, placed before cultivation when the soil surface is \ndamp.\n\nThese traps should form a cover of about 25cm in diameter, with a small amount of bait (such as chicken layers\u2019 \nmash) underneath each one.\n\nNine traps should be set out in a W shape across each field where it is less than 20ha \u2013 increasing to 13 on the \nbiggest fields.\n\n\n\nTraps should be left overnight and examined early the following morning, before it warms up. If no slugs are found, \ntrapping should continue until crops are beyond the vulnerable stage. If there are four slugs per trap, there is a risk \nto the following oilseed rape crop.\n\nRisk factors\n\nMoisture and temperature \u2013 the activity, survival and reproduction of slugs are dependent on temperature, moisture, \nlight and soil structure. Slugs are active between 5-20C.\n\nSoil type \u2013 slugs are more abundant in heavy soils\n\nPrevious cropping \u2013 slug damage is greater after leafy crops, where soil conditions are moist.\n\nCrop residues \u2013 crop residues and farmyard manure applications provide slugs with a source of food and shelter.\n\nCultivations \u2013 open cloddy seed-beds allow slugs easy movement and provide more shelter. Direct and delayed \ndrilling often increase the risk of slug damage.\n\nCultural control\n\nSeed-bed preparation and quality has an important role to play in the control of slugs.\n\nCultivations will increase slug mortality, while firm seed-beds reduce the pest\u2019s activity by making it harder for them \nto move around.\n\nA fine, consolidated seed-bed is essential for the protection of seedlings. It enables the seeds to germinate quickly \nand the plants to grow rapidly through the vulnerable establishment stage.\n\nChemical control\n\nApplications of slug pellets are used to control slugs. These should always be used in conjunction with cultural \ncontrol methods.\n\nPellets have to be ingested by slugs to cause death, so their palatability and durability in field conditions matter. \nLarge slugs need to ingest more of the active substance than smaller ones.\n\nBroadcasting is the best method of pellet application, especially when it is used in combination with fine, firm seed-\nbeds. This action should be done as soon as possible after drilling. Pellets mixed with seed at drilling are less \neffective in fine seed-beds because they are not available to the slugs.\n\nThere are two active ingredients used in the manufacture of slug pellets:\n\nMetaldehyde \u2013 a selective molluscicide which acts on slugs by inducing excessive secretion of mucus. Metaldehyde \npellets are subject to best practice restrictions and guidelines, as the active ingredient is often detected in water \nabove EU standards. For more information on the latest guidance, visit www.getpelletwise.co.uk.\n\nFerric phosphate \u2013 an alternative to metaldehyde with no restrictions on its use, ferric phosphate can also be used \nin organic production. Once eaten. slugs quickly stop feeding and die within three to six days, often going \nunderground.  \n\nAs a result, the effectiveness of treatment should be measured by the decrease in feeding damage, rather than by \ncounting dead slugs.\n\n2. Cabbage stem flea beetle\n\nhttp://www.getpelletwise.co.uk/\n\n\nCabbage stem flea beetle is widespread in the UK. The adult beetles are about 5mm long, shiny black in colour with \na hint of green/blue.\n\nThese beetles migrate into crops during emergence and feed on the growing point, often destroying the plant.\n\nThey then bite \u201cshotholes\u201d in the cotyledons and early true leaves. Eggs are laid at the base of plants in the soil, \nwith newly hatched larvae boring into the leaf petioles and later into the main stems.\n\nRisk factors\n\nAir temperatures above 16C are favourable for adult beetle migration, so a warm autumn will favour egg laying and \nearly hatch.\n\nSlow growing crops, due to a lack of soil moisture or a cloddy seed-bed, will be less vigorous and are more prone to \nbeing eaten.\n\nMonitoring\n\nThe numbers of adult beetles emerging from the soil in the summer can be monitored to assess the risk.\n\nChecking beetle numbers in the previous crop\u2019s harvested seed, looking for signs of damage to volunteer oilseed \nrape plants and using water traps to check for numbers of active beetles are all effective.\n\nWithout neonicotinoid seed treatments, the only control option for growers is the use of pyrethroid sprays. However, \nresistance to the pyrethroids in flea beetles has been confirmed, so they often provide little or no control.    \n\nWhere they are to be used, pyrethroid sprays should only be applied where there is evidence of high pest pressure \nor if thresholds are exceeded.\n\nWhere adults have eaten over 25% of leaf area at the cotyledon-two leaf stage or over 50% of leaf area at the \nthree-to-four true leaf stage should sprays be used at full recommended rates.\n\n3. Pigeons\n\nPigeons can appear all year in large flocks, posing a particular problem in the winter.\n\nPigeons graze on developing oilseed rape crops and will often strip leaves right down to the main veins. Where \nmeristems are damaged, the plant compensates by producing additional lateral shoots from the base.\n\nDamage can be uneven across a crop, causing patchy spring development and inconsistent plant height and \nmaturity.\n\nThe best form of control is a well-established, vigorous crop, which limits their ability to land and feed. If crop \nestablishment is patchy, a combination of shooting and the use of bird scarers can be used to reduce feeding.\n\n4. Other Pests\n\nPeach-potato aphid, or Myzus persicae, is the main vector of turnip yellows virus, which can decrease yields by \n30%.\n\nAphids arriving in oilseed rape crops in the autumn transmit the virus, so a well-timed spray can be used to control \nthem.\n\nThere are recommended varieties with resistance to turnip yellows virus, so these can be grown where high levels \ninfection are expected.\n\n\n\nLeaf miners can infest the first developing true leaves, causing unsightly mines. They do not justify insecticide \ntreatment.\n\nRape winter stem weevil adults lay their eggs on petioles close to the stem, with the larvae then feeding within the \nstems over the winter. There are no thresholds for this pest, which only affects local areas.\n\nThe role of companion crops in pest control?\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest that companion crops have a role in keeping pest numbers down \nand reducing the need for insecticides.\n\nWhether that\u2019s due to a dilution effect, or that they confuse pests, remains to be seen. They may also have a barrier \neffect, preventing pests from getting to emerging rape plants \u2013 such as limiting the landing sites for pigeons.\n\nUnder severe pest pressure, they are unlikely to be a total solution. But for a very low cost and minimal effort, they \nare already providing benefits on many farms.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA tractor driver is lucky to be alive after a three-vehicle horror crash involving a stolen RS Ford Focus.\n\nThe distinctive white Ford Focus RS Mk2 was in a serious collision with a green tractor and a blue Peugeot 207, in \nGreat Barr, north-west Birmingham, West Midlands, on 1 June.\n\nThe tractor overturned in the collision and was seriously damaged after sliding on its side.\n\nWarning: Video contains some swearing\n\nIts windows smashed and glass showered on to the road.\n\nSee also: Read the latest news and features on farm health and safety\n\nIncredibly, the tractor driver walked away from the wreckage.\n\nHe was treated by paramedics for cuts to his back and head, given pain relief and sent to Sandwell Hospital for \nfurther checks.\n\nThe driver of the blue Peugeot was uninjured.\n\nFollowing the crash, the occupants of the stolen Ford fled the scene.\n\nPolice are still hunting for the offenders.\n\nEyewitnesses said the white Ford was travelling well in excess of 100mph when it collided with the tractor and \nPeugeot.\n\nStolen Ford\n\nAndrew Shaw, a plumber from Epsom, who owns the Ford, said it was stolen from The County Hotel in Walsall on \n23 May \u2013 just two miles from the crash scene.\n\nHe told Birmingham Live: \u201cI\u2019ve lost my pride and joy, the car\u2019s worth about \u00a330,000 and, after spotting the video on \nFacebook last week, I knew straight away that it was my car.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve smashed into the car and probably used a sensory card, like a fob which has been copied to steal it.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey also emptied the contents of my car and dumped it on a lady\u2019s front garden nearby, who then called my office \noff the back of finding my work diary.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019ve worked so hard for it \u2013 you can\u2019t have anything nice anymore.

agricultural equipment this year after strong \ngrain prices helped improve profitability.\n\nFigures released by the Agricultural Engineers Association (AEA) show there has been a 5% rise in new tractor \nregistrations in the year to date compared with 2017, with the biggest increase in sales coming from tractors over \n180hp.\n\nA total of 1,222 tractors over 50hp were registered last month, as wheat prices stood more than \u00a310/t higher than \nthe previous year and milling wheat some \u00a320/t higher.\n\nSee also: Ultimate guide to buying a tractor 2018\n\nThis was the highest May sales figures since 2014 and brought the total tractor registrations for 2018 to a healthy \n5,343.\n\nTractor sales are a key benchmark of the health of the agricultural economy as they closely track farming income, \nsaid AEA economist Stephen Howarth.\n\nLast year\u2019s improvement in dairy farm profitability was mirrored by an increase in registrations of new tractors \nbetween 120-180hp, as well as an increase in sales of grassland equipment.\n\nBut this year the biggest improvement in sales has been from tractors over 180hp, suggesting it is the arable sector \nthat is the most willing to invest in machinery, with sales of arable equipment also improving.\n\nThe increase in sales comes despite an increase in the price of tractors, with manufacturers blaming the weak \npound and legislation changes, although some customers are questioning if increases have gone beyond these \njustifications.\n\nThe most recent price-affecting rule changes were the European \u201cTractor Mother Regulations\u201d which came into \neffect on 1 January 2018 and set higher safety standards for all new tractors in the EU.\n\nMr Howarth said this meant dealers rushed to register 600-700 new tractors last December before the rules came \ninto effect in order for them to fall outside of the legislation\u2019s scope.\n\nDespite being registered in 2017, many of these will have been sold in 2018 and will have been in addition to the \nrise in registrations this year meaning the growth in sales will be higher than the official estimate of 5%.  \n\n\n\nSecond-hand market also strong\n\nDemand in the second-hand tractor market also shows no sign of abating according to Simon Wearmouth, partner \nat Brown & Co, despite an increase in machinery auctions happening across the UK.\n\nHe said additional throughput in the tractor and equipment market have not dampened the value of good-quality \nitems because more farmers are looking for a decent second-hand kit rather than

Wednesday (6 \nJune) as, Liam Fox\u2019s number two, Greg Hands MP appeared before the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \nselect committee.\n\nThe international trade minister was quizzed on prospective reductions to UK food and welfare standards, the \nprospects for the British sugar industry, future free trade arrangements, tariff rate quotas (TRQ) and the \nperformance of his department.\n\nHere\u2019s what he said when asked:\n\nWill the UK lower food standards as part of a free-trade deal with the likes of the US?\n\nWhere does the UK stand in terms of negotiating free-trade arrangements?\n\nHow are discussions going over the division of trade-rate quotas post-Brexit?\n\nHow will Brexit influence the UK sugar beet industry?\n\nIs the Department for International Trade prepared for Brexit?\n\nSee also: US leads opposition to UK-EU post-Brexit import quota plan \n\nWill the UK lower food standards as part of a free-trade deal with the likes of the US?\n\nWhat Mr Hands said: \u201cThe government is absolutely clear that we will not be lowering any of our food standards, \nanimal welfare standards or environmental standards as we leave the EU.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons why the food and drink sector is such an exporting success is precisely because people \nrecognise the quality of our food and drink so it would be perverse for us to do anything to bring into question \npeople\u2019s liking of the quality of UK food and drink.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of sectors are really looking forward to having our trade deals and to export more food and drink in the \nfuture.\u201d\n\nHowever, Mr Hands repeatedly refused to directly answer whether food produced under lower welfare standards \nthan in the UK, such as chlorine-washed chicken would be allowed to enter under a free-trade arrangement.\n\n\n\nHe eventually conceded: \u201cAny imported products would have to meet UK standards. Whether it be in agriculture or \nin anything else.\u201d\n\nWhere does the UK stand in terms of negotiating free-trade arrangements?\n\nWhat Mr Hands said: \u201cWe have set up 14 trade working groups involving 21 countries, however not all of these \ncountries will lead to a free-trade agreement.\u201d\n\nMr Hands also confirmed the UK can negotiate, sign and ratify new trade deals after March 2019 but cannot bring \nthese into effect before 1 January 2021.\n\nHe added there are no trade working group with any Mercosur nations.\n\n\u201cA lot of these working groups coincide with countries that have TRQ\u2019s such as Australia and New Zealand so you \ncan see the read across to where future free-trade deals might be going,\u201d said Mr Hands.\n\nHow are discussions going over the division of TRQ\u2019s post-Brexit?\n\n\u201cTRQ\u2019s will remain in place between the UK and the EU until December 2020.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic that UK would come to a positive conclusion with the World Trade Organization (WTO) over TRQ\u2019s.\u201d\n\nMr Hands admitted the entirety of some our TRQ\u2019s such as lamb from New Zealand or sugar from Brazil could still \ncome to the UK following Brexit.\n\nLast September, the US, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, Thailand and Uruguay wrote an open letter \nstating they would not accept any splitting of current TRQ\u2019s between the UK and the EU.\n\n\u201cWTO is an organisation that by its very nature believes in free trade,\u201d said Mr Hands.\n\n\u201cThe same members who have an interest in some of those TRQs are the same countries welcoming the UK in \nbecoming a stand-alone member of the WTO.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s a negotiation that is ongoing and in common with all negotiations that are ongoing it\u2019s difficult to provide a \nrunning commentary and it\u2019s difficult to provide absolute certainty.\u201d\n\nSee also: Why an EU trade deal could hurt beef prices after Brexit\n\nHow will Brexit influence the UK sugar beet industry?\n\nWhat Mr Hands said: \u201cExiting the EU presents opportunities for the sugar industry and it is down to the government \nto enable an innovative and productive sector that is competitive at home and overseas.\u201d\n\nMr Hands reiterated the UK\u2019s long-standing commitment to reduce poverty through trade with developing sugar-\ncane-producing nations.\n\n\u201cRemoval of EU sugar beet quotas in October 2017 is allowing British growers to move towards competing on a \nlevel playing field with other producers around the world.\n\nWe are rising to the occasion Greg Hands, MP \n\n\u201cThe government committed to help the industry to further develop its competitiveness.\u201d\n\nIs the Department for International Trade prepared for Brexit?\n\nWhat Mr Hands said: \u201cWe are rising to the occasion. The department has gone from 50 to 500 staff working in the \ntrade policy group.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe department that is battle ready for those negotiations in March 2019.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about trade deals, we can do a lot about reducing trade barriers outside of trade deals.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nTributes have been paid to a young trainee mechanic killed in an accident involving a tractor.\n\nNeil Graham, died after the accident at a farm in County Fermanagh on Tuesday (22 May).\n\nEmergency services were sent to Boho Road in Springfield, Enniskillen following a 999 call at 2.39pm.

They have said they want to maintain high food standards \nbut also that they would be willing to have minimal customs checks to avoid disruption at borders,\u201d said Lord \nTeverson.\n\nIndustry needs time to prepare\n\n\u201cWe are calling on the government to set out what checks they do intend to carry out on food imports, to allow the \nfood industry and customs authorities time to prepare and to reassure consumers that standards will be upheld.\u201d\n\nHe added the government had presented a paradox where it would seek trade deals that secure lower prices for \nconsumers, while UK food and farming were expected to be exemplars of high-quality production post Brexit.\n\n\u201cWe would urge the government to consider the impact Brexit may have on food inequality in the UK: will we have a \nsituation where high quality, local produce is available for those who can afford it, with cheaper food imported for \nthose on lower incomes?\u201d added Lord Teverson.\n\n\u201cThe UK needs a comprehensive food policy, to tackle these complex issues, and we urge the government to \nproduce one with some urgency.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nNew crop wheat prices have had a volatile week after forecasts of a poor Russian harvest initially pushed up \nvalues before they fell back again amid concern over the US-China trade war.\n\nThe price hike came as the market reacted to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) global crop forecast.\n\nSee also: Cereals 2018: Disease warning as barley seed treatments fail\n\nIt suggested a wet spring in Russia had potentially reduced the country\u2019s crop to 68.5m tonnes.\n\nAHDB Cereals said it meant forecasts for global wheat production in 2018-19 were down 3.1m tonnes on May \npredictions to 744.7m tonnes.\n\n\nThis projection represents a 19% decline in Russian wheat production from 2017-18, according to AHDB senior \nanalyst Daniel Rooney.\n\n\u201cEstimates suggested that European 2018-19 wheat production was also likely to be down by 1m tonnes on May \nestimates to 149.4m tonnes,\u201d Mr Rooney said.\n\n\u201cThe decline follows dry spring conditions in Germany and Poland raising concerns for winter wheat,\u201d he said.\n\nTight supplies\n\nElsewhere, dry weather has seen the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences \ndecreasing its monthly forecasts to 21.9m tonnes, putting it just 0.5m tonnes above the poor production last season.\n\nIn India wheat production is expected to reach 97m tonnes, up 2m tonnes on May projections, but this still \nrepresents a 2% decline from last season estimates, Mr Rooney added.\n\nNews of the downward revisions drove up Chicago milling wheat futures (Dec-18) by \u00a35.17/t in a single session to \nclose at \u00a3157.26/t on 12 June.\n\nThe UK feed wheat futures (Nov-18) reacted by closing at a new contract record high of \u00a3161.70/t on 12 June, \nrising \u00a31.40/t from day earlier levels, said the AHDB. And Paris milling wheat futures (Dec-18) rose \u00a31.98/t in 24 \nhours to close at \u00a3164.89/t, the highest level in sterling terms since 14 July 2017.\n\nIf the USDA forecasts are accurate a decline in Russian production and associated exportable surplus could create \na tighter feel to global markets, Mr Rooney added.\n\nPrice erosion\n\nHowever, Gleadell\u2019s managing director, David Sheppard, commented that 24 hours was a long time on the global \nwheat market as the high prices dramatically fell back a day later.\n\n\u201cAll of the gains made were eroded as talk of [US president Donald] Trump activating tariffs against China, and the \nexpected Chinese retaliatory action, spooked the market,\u201d Mr Sheppard said.\n\nAnalysing the European market Mr Sheppard said Denmark would have a much-reduced or zero export availability \ndue to lower plantings and drought-affected crop conditions.\n\nThis was particularly important for the UK because Denmark had been a significant source of feed wheat for the \nScottish, Northern Irish and North of England markets this year, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, forecasts of crop production from UK farmers appears split. Some grain traders have reported farmer \nconfidence is growing as winter crops look satisfactory with good cover.\n\nBut in Scotland crops are yet to rally after the cold spring weather.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nDairy farmers who are celebrating improved profits from the past 12 months need to prepare for rising costs by \npaying down debt or investing in efficiency measures.\n\nThat\u2019s the message from agricultural consultant Promar, which warns that rising input costs in the next six months \nare likely to eat into profit margins.\n\nFigures released this week show higher milk prices during the last financial year pushed up profits to an average of \n\u00a3125,000 for the farmers costed by Promar, up from an average of \u00a343,000 the previous year.\n\n\n\nSee also: How Co-ops scheme keeps calfs in the supply chain\n\nThe figures are drawn from a sample of more than 200 dairy farmers spread across Britain with an average herd \nsize of 203 cows and an average yield a cow of 8,281 litres.\n\nProducers will also be cheered by the forecast that no significant deviations in the milk price are expected for at \nleast the first half of the financial year.\n\nBut Nigel Davies, national consultancy manager with Promar, said farmers should make sure they are using the \nmoney to improve their business\u2019 resilience to combat rising production costs and static milk prices.\n\n \n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var \ni=\"InfogramEmbeds\",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?\"http:\":\"https:\";if(/^\\/{2}/.test(s)&&(\ns=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var \na=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,\"script\",\"infogram-\nasync\",\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\");\n\nHe said farmers should analyse their books to have a firm understanding of where the additional income coming \ninto their business is being deployed, and investments that either cut costs or improve output should be top of the \nlist for spending.\n\nThe cost of purchased concentrate feed has already risen by an average of \u00a314/t in the year to March 2018 to \n\u00a3217/t, adding \u00a310,400 to feed bills.\n\nAdditional pressure from inflation, variable costs and other overheads has also added \u00a310,700 to the cost of \nproduction for these herds in the same period.\n\nFour things dairy businesses need to do with their higher profits\n\nHave something tangible to show for it \u2013 investments which improve efficiency\n\nUnderstand potential tax bill \u2013 engage early with accountants\n\nUnderstand debt burden \u2013 each \u00a31,000 of debt/cow can equate to a cost of 1p/litre\n\nContinue to compare yourself against the best \u2013 the top 25% of operators have double the profit per cow compared \nwith the average\n\nWhile farmers are price takers on many inputs, Tim Harper, senior consultant at Promar, said they can maximise \nthe value of feed by careful monitoring of cow performance, particularly during diet transition.\n\nThis means not just testing the quality of feedstuffs, such as silage, but also monitoring how cows are performing on \nit, particularly lower-yielding animals, which can get less attention than higher-yielding cattle.\n\nSlash debt\n\nA focus on paying down debt with any available cash is also recommended in order to prepare for tighter times \nahead.\n\nPromar figures reveal the average farmer in its sample has debts of \u00a32,483 a cow, which would equate to 2.5p/litre \nif paid off over 15 years at 3% interest.\n\nOther farmers have debts of up to \u00a35,000 a cow, which would equate to 5p/litre on the same terms.\n\n\nInvestment in housing\n\nDairy farmer Paul Tomkins, who milks 200 cows in the Vale of York, said he has been investing additional profits in \nimproving calf housing and feed storage facilities in a bid to lower his cost of production.\n\nMr Tomkins said one of the primary goals of the business is to reduce reliance on purchased feed.\n\n\u201cI definitely have more control over my costs than I do my income, where I am definitely a price taker. That\u2019s why I \nfocus on reducing my costs,\u201d he said.\n\nWith input costs already edging up, he said his buying group\u2019s advice is to start buying required inputs forward now.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nDutch machinery manufacturer Vervaet has purchased a 50% share of its UK importer, J Riley Beet Harvesters.\n\nThe deal comes as no members of the Riley family are in a position to continue running the business. It was a \nlogical move as the two family-run companies have been in partnership for more than 25 years.\n\nSee also: Root-crop chasers take the headache out of harvest haulage\n\nJ Riley Beet Harvesters was established in 1994 by managing director Jeremy Riley, and now employs 14 staff \nfrom its base in Attlebridge, Norfolk.\n\nSince day one, J Riley has been the sole UK importer of Vervaet beet harvesters and Hydro-Trike self-propelled \nspreaders, supplying and servicing both new and refurbished second-hand machines throughout the country.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nSummer has arrived across the country, bringing with it a host of issues for the vets in this month\u2019s Vet Viewpoint.\n\nIn this edition, vets from around the country offer advice on fly control and coccidiosis in calves and lambs. They \nalso discuss selective dry cow therapy and we get an update on the Welsh bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) \nprogramme.\n\nSee also: Vet Viewpoint: Sheep lameness, abortion and fluke advice\n\nJohn Cammack\n\nGlenthorne Veterinary Group, Uttoxeter, Staffordshire\n\nFlies on cattle can cause reduced milk yields, decreased feed intakes and a rise in diseases such as mastitis and \nNew Forest eye.\n\nSo, as we move into peak fly season, a robust control plan is needed and this should take the form of a two-\npronged approach of environmental and animal control.\n\nAside from general hygiene, a range of treatments are available to reduce the environmental reservoir of flies, \nincluding adulticidal and larvicidal sprays, fly lamps and fly traps.\n\nUsing fly parasites that feed on the developing maggots and prevent them developing into adult flies is a novel \napproach to environmental control. It relies on the fly parasites being released around ideal breeding sites such as \ndung heaps.\n\nAnimal control relies on the regular application of insecticides, usually as pour-on preparations.\n\n\n\nMidges, which transmit the diseases bluetongue and Schmallenberg, will also be controlled by a similar strategy to \nflies.\n\nSee also: Vet Viewpoint: Metabolic profiling, abomasal bloat and grass staggers\n\nDanielle Priestley\n\nSt Boniface Veterinary Clinic, Crediton, Devon\n\nMany of the practice\u2019s dairy herds are autumn block calving and will shortly be considering their selective dry cow \nmanagement. Therefore, we thought we would share a few reminders about why a selective approach is best.\n\nThere is no sense in giving antibiotics to an uninfected cow. In fact, if you do give antibiotics to low-somatic cell \ncount cows, their risk of coliform mastitis in the next lactation actually increases.\n\nOf 52 UK farms studied, those using selective dry cow management were significantly less likely to have cows \ndeveloping mastitis in the first 30 days of lactation.\n\nAnd protection against new infection in the dry period is much better achieved by using teat sealants and will \nreduce the risk by about 25%.\n\nRoderick Dunse\n\nDunmuir Veterinary Group, Castle Douglas, Dumfries and Galloway\n\nOnce again, we have come through a long and wearing winter here in south-west Scotland. Persistent damp \nconditions have allowed coccidiosis to increasingly flourish in calves and lambs over recent years.\n\nThose affected by coccidiosis can possibly set their watches by it and know when to expect it and when to treat.\n\nFor those of us who have not yet met coccidiosis, it is a little protozoan parasite that loves moist conditions. And if \nan area is overstocked, so much the better for the little blighters.\n\nThe good news is that immunity develops to coccidiosis, the bad news is it really damages the digestive tracts \nbefore calves or lambs catch on to what is going on.\n\nSimon Wilson\n\nCain Veterinary Centre, Llansantffraid, Powys\n\nHere in mid-Wales, we have recently been making extra use of the TB test by taking the opportunity to blood \nsample youngstock for BVD exposure.\n\nThis free test forms part of the Welsh BVD eradication project, which aims to find which herds have the active virus \ncirculating in them and then to eradicate the disease from Wales.\n\nFarms testing positive benefit from funding to look for persistently infected (PI) \u201ccarrier\u201d animals. It is only by \nremoval of these PI animals from a herd that the cycle of BVD infection can be stopped.\n\nHopefully, through this scheme more farms can become free from the negative effects BVD has on fertility and \nimmunity and we can prevent the creation of more poor-performing PI animals. The scheme has certainly raised \nawareness of the disease in our area.\n\nVet Viewpoint is a regional monthly round-up of key issues from XL Vet Group.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\n\n\nValtra has finally let its heavyweight S-series loose on the 400hp tractor scene and, armed with lorry loads of \ntorque, a proven driveline and a redesigned cab, promises to unsettle a few of the traditional high-horsepower \ncampaigners.\n\nIt was back at the tail-end of 2013 that Valtra announced the launch of its fourth generation 270hp-390hp S-series \ntractors, but we\u2019ve had to wait until now to see any production machines in the flesh.\n\nIssues with previous incarnations of its flagship tractor range meant the Finnish company insisted on ironing out any \ngremlins before bringing them to market, which is sensible stuff; except the process has taken nearly five years to \ncomplete.\n\nHowever, there have been some upsides to the delay \u2013 during that period the company has added a new armrest, \njoystick and touchscreen computer that have the potential to position the S-series up there with the big boys.\n\nWith its sleek lines, curvy cabin and angular LED lights, the S394 certainly has the looks, but it\u2019s what\u2019s under all \nthat trim that counts.\n\nMuscle is provided by an 8.4-litre AgcoPower (Sisu) six-pot that can generate up to 1,600Nm of torque. That power \nis put to the ground by a Fendt stepless Vario gearbox.\n\nSo the driveline is pretty well-proven (some might say the Finnish power-plant is a better bet than the Deutz motor \nused by Valtra\u2019s green-liveried Agco stablemates) but what about the rest of the tractor?\n\nSee also: On test: JCB's 419S loading shovel brings extra muscle\n\nShared platform\n\nLike previous second and third-generation S-series models, this latest version uses a common platform shared with \nMassey Ferguson\u2019s largest 8700 tractors.\n\nBuilt at MF\u2019s factory in Beauvais, France, these high-horsepower prime-movers have the same cabin, albeit kitted \nout with different trim and controls.\n\nTwo critical things set the Valtra apart \u2013 it\u2019s on offer with the Finnish-firm\u2019s TwinTrac reverse-drive system and has \nthe company\u2019s new SmartTouch armrest.\n\nWith this in mind, we thought it best to put the new tractor to the test in probably the most common reverse drive \napplication \u2013 with a set of triple mowers.\n\nWhile FW\u2019s test team might know their onions when it comes to what\u2019s going on in the wacky world of farm \nmachinery, we\u2019re certainly not experts in operating this kind of kit, so we thought it best to take the big Valtra to \nsome men that are.\n\nReverse-drive debut\n\nIt was back in the early 1990s that Somerset contractors Robert and Colin Targett started experimenting with the \nidea of reverse-drive mowers. Initially, they adapted an old MF combine chassis to create a self-propelled mowing \nrig.\n\nIt had three mowers arranged to cut 6.7m (22ft) and proved the concept had merit. But more output was required, \nso the next step was to find something with a bit more muscle.\n\nWanting to retain the visibility benefits of having the cab right over the top of the mowers and keen to keep dust and \ndebris away from the radiators, the Targetts decided a conventional tractor running backwards was the best \nsolution.\n\n\n\nThey bought a 177hp Massey 8150 and sent it off to a specialist on the French-Swiss border who relocated the \ndiesel tank, cut a new footwell in the back of the cab for the reverse drive pedals and fitted a secondary steering \ncolumn which also carried the necessary switch gear for the Dynashift transmission and rear linkage control.\n\nThat did a few seasons\u2019 work, first with a set of Claas Corto triple drum mowers and later with a set of Disco mower \nconditioners.\n\nThe modified Massey was eventually replaced by a Fendt 926 with a factory-fitted swivel seat and steering column.\n\nSince then, there has been a succession of Fendts fulfilling the reverse-drive role, the current one being a 2017 \n930.\n\nThroughout that time the main man in the seat has been Dave Birch. There can\u2019t be many people in the UK who\u2019ve \nspent more time going backwards in a tractor \u2013 each year he knocks down some 3000ha of grass using the firm\u2019s \nClaas Disco 8600 mowers in reverse. Who better to put the 405hp S-series to the test?\n\nSilage season\n\nIt was towards the end of first cut silage that the S394 arrived at the Targetts\u2019 Somerset HQ.\n\nWith the 630-litre diesel tank brimmed and 60-litres of AdBlue on board, it was hitched up to the business\u2019s Claas \nmowing outfit.\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised to see that the tractor\u2019s touchscreen computer recognised the mowers almost \nimmediately after plugging the Isobus cable into the Valtra\u2019s socket.\n\nAll looked good, until it came to working out how to hoist each of the three beds in the air independently. Usually \nthis task is fulfilled by joystick buttons assigned to the individual Isobus functions.\n\nUnfortunately, the S-series doesn\u2019t yet have this functionality \u2013 Valtra promises a software update will be ready for \nAugust \u2013 so we were left with operating the mowers as one on a spool-valve.\n\nThe alternative option was to lift them individually by tapping the appropriate icon on the screen. That\u2019s all good \nuntil you realise that the Isobus screen is only accessible by flicking through the display pages \u2013 it cannot be \nassigned to one of the quarters on the four-way split home screen. Again, the Finns say they\u2019re working on this.\n\nIn the field\n\nWith workarounds found for each of these issues, we set out for the field. Default start-off setting for the \ntransmission finds the pedal as the master control, so a bit of right boot sets it moving and the tractor\u2019s computers \nwork out the right gearbox ratio and amount of throttle according to load.\n\nGiven the S-series\u2019 12t working weight, it\u2019s quick to accelerate to its 50kph top speed \u2013 a sign of things to come \nfrom the gutsy Sisu six-pot.\n\nKnocking the lever to the right and holding it there for a couple of seconds activates the cruise control. With no real \nload on the engine, the stepless box quickly closes down the swash-plate pumps and eases over from hydrostatic \nto mechanical drive.\n\nThis does away with that trademark Vario whine and means you can settle back into what has to be one of the most \ncomfortable, quiet cabs in the high-horsepower game.  \n\nWith 2,300kg on the nose and the triples stacked on the back, it feels pretty stable on the road \u2013 the combination of \nhydro-pneumatic cab suspension, front axle springing and a Grammer Evolution active seat make for a particularly \nsmooth ride.\n\n\n\nThe cab suspension settings can also be altered in the touchscreen computer.\n\nOnce in the field it\u2019s then a case of swinging the seat around into reverse-drive position.\n\nEven with the main steering wheel flipped right up, it\u2019s a bit of a faff to get the armrest and computer display around \nwithout clashing.\n\nOnce swiveled, the central driving position faces directly out over the mowers with a much smaller column, shuttle \nand wheel nestled between the driver\u2019s knees. (Unlike the Fendt that takes everything \u2013 including the main steering \nwheel \u2013 around with it).\n\nIt scores well for visibility, with the rear screen curving around to the B-pillars, allowing a look at the outer tips of the \n8.6m-wide mowers. Whether that would be the case with a 9.5m set, we\u2019re not so sure.\n\nMowing duties\n\nIt\u2019s immediately clear that the triples we\u2019d got hitched on were never really going to test the Sisu motor to the limits \neven in heavy, waxy crops of ryegrass.\n\nUsual mowing speed for the Targett 930 is 13-14kph, but we got the big Valtra up to 17-18kph before there was any \ndiscernable dip in engine note.\n\nEven then, pto revs barely flicker, which isn\u2019t surprising given it has a 90hp advantage on the Fendt and max torque \ncomes in at a whopping 1,600Nm in boost, compared to the 930\u2019s modest 1,278Nm.\n\nAlthough not necessarily to be relied upon, the tractor\u2019s fuel readout suggested the S394 was burning between 44-\n47-litres an hour. That\u2019s a pretty close match to consumption rates for the Bavarian prime-mover usually employed \nfor the job.\n\nIn the cab\n\nDriving controls are all pretty familiar, particularly the shuttle stick.\n\nThe main joystick is well thought out so, rather than standing upright, it sits horizontally and falls more naturally to \nhand.\n\nRockers for linkage, two spools and the shuttle are closely grouped but could do with a bit more differentiation to \navoid any accidental mix-ups.\n\nCruise control is activated by knocking the stick to the right, but there\u2019s one annoying feature here \u2013 preset speeds \nare lost every time the driver leaves the seat.\n\nOne way to reinstate them is to go into the transmission settings page on the touchscreen. This same menu page \nhas a slider for engine droop settings, biasing the transmission towards maintaining engine revs for pto type work or \nfor maximum speed with minimal revs for transport.\n\nGuidance\n\nSteering is handled by a Trimble box on the roof, running through the SmartTouch display.

And the challenge is \nall the greater as farm sizes swell, forcing operators to clock huge hours during peak seasons.\n\nThe widely trumpeted solution is to automate time-sapping jobs \u2013 a nice idea that has proved almost impossibly \nhard to bring to reality.\n\nMr Beaujot\u2019s aim was to build a versatile tool carrier, rather than wasting an intelligent platform by restricting its \nresponsibilities to simply drilling or grain carting.\n\nHis early plans proved enough to convince dozens of overworked Canadian growers (and several from other \ncontinents) to put down deposits long before the finished product was ready to hit the fields.\n\nSo, while the general UK farming consensus is that autonomous tractors remain a hazy mirage on the horizon, \nthose across the pond with more acres and tighter working windows are in no doubt the time is nigh.\n\nDot in a nutshell\n\nSix units running this year\n\nImplements will include a 36m sprayer, 14t grain cart and 9m drill\n\nBare unit likely to cost up to \u00a3225,000\n\nEurope-friendly 3m version coming by 2021\n\nHow does it work?\n\nIt uses a simple but clever U-shaped carriage to pick up implements sideways (in its 3.8m-wide transport mode) \nbefore swivelling 90deg on its four wheels so the engine sits at the front during field work.\n\nThe powerplant is soon to be upgraded to a 200hp Cummins Tier 5 block, which is mounted on one side of the box \nsection frame and sends its power through a splitter gearbox to a set of four Poclain variable displacement \nhydraulic pumps.\n\nTwo of these provide auxiliary power to the implements (all are oil-powered, so there\u2019s no pto) while the other two \nprovide hydrostatic drive to the wheels.\n\nEach leg carries a hydraulic motor \u2013 forget clutches and cogboxes \u2013 providing all-wheel power and two speed \nranges topping out at 9kph and 19kph, respectively.\n\nThis layout also makes it easy to run a traction control system that directs the oil to whichever wheel has the best \ngrip based on the disparity between the GPS and wheel speeds.\n\nA heavier-duty walking beam axle on the side opposite the engine helps keep all four wheels biting into terra firma \nand acts as a counterweight to the driveline.\n\nDot's choice of diesel power differs from most prototype driverless tractors, which tend to run off batteries.\n\nHowever, electricity adds complexity \u2013 both in manufacturing and for the end user \u2013 and is probably why most \nexperiments have failed to get anywhere close to full-scale production.\n\nBig batteries remain prohibitively expensive, don\u2019t have the capacity to deliver the huge power outputs required and \nare a nightmare to charge in hard-to-reach places with poor access to the grid.\n\n\n\nBelow is a video showing how it works on the farm:\n\nSoftware\n\nThe robot-grade software that allows Dot to run without a driver was developed by SeedMaster\u2019s seven developers \nand supported through a collaboration with guidance specialist Raven.\n\nManual steering with a remote-control joystick is only really needed for farmyard manoeuvres and picking \nup/dropping off implements, although even this can be automated once their GPS co-ordinates have been noted.\n\nIt uses existing field maps to create uncrossable virtual boundaries for the machine and its implement. The \ncompany\u2019s own software makes sense of the information provided by the map, including hazards such as rogue \ntroughs and power poles.\n\nFrom that, it picks out the most efficient route across a field, which must then be approved by the farmer before it is \nsent to the on-board processor.\n\nDot strictly follows this route and will stop dead if it\u2019s forced to deviate, before sending an alert and waiting for \noperator input. Owners can also keep tabs on its progress through on-board cameras, or even take the reins via \nlong-range wifi.\n\nMost of the basic decision-making during work is computerised, so it can do things such as reduce forward speed to \nclimb a steep hill.\n\nIt also collects data as it works, which can be used to form variable rate application and horsepower maps as well \nas monitoring fuel usage and repair/maintenance indicators. In time, more sensors will allow it to process \ninformation relating to soil conditions, crop health or weed detection.\n\nIn the field\n\nTo keep purchasing decisions simple, one Dot unit is designed to be able to cover the same land area as a single \ncombine \u2013 about 1,000ha.\n\nMachines still require a degree of operator input \u2013 sprayer tanks and drill hoppers need filling, as does the fuel tank \nevery 10-14 hours \u2013 but it\u2019s designed to be far less taxing than an 18-hour stint in the seat.\n\nNor is there any getting away from the fact that shear-bolts break and nozzles block, but there are plenty of \ncompanies developing cameras and sensors capable of detecting problems and alerting operators, who can then \nmarch out to the field with tools in hand.\n\nThe cost of the kit is tumbling too, so there\u2019s likely to be rapid progress in this department.\n\nCarrying implements on top of the power platform also helps cut compaction by making use of their weight to \nbenefit traction.\n\nTypically, tractors must outweigh the drill or cultivator to help put their power to the ground, but Dot can make do \nwith a fairly modest empty weight of less than 6t, which apparently reduces the quantity fuel and power required \npurely for propulsion.\n\nSpecs\n\nEngine Cummins QSB4.5 Tier 4F 4.5-litre turbocharged diesel\n\nPower 173hp@2,200rpm\n\nTorque 705Nm@1,500rpm\n\n\n\nTop speed 19kph\n\nAuxiliary hydraulic pump 230-litres/min@207bar\n\nDry weight 5,670kg\n\nCarrying capacity 18,000kg\n\nTransport width 3.76m\n\nTransport length 6.1m\n\nHeight 3.66m\n\nFuel tank 320 litres\n\nContinuous run time 10-14 hours\n\nStandard tyres 500/70 R24\n\nPrice Expected to be $250,000-300,000 (\u00a3188,000-225,000)\n\nHealth and safety\n\nAs ever, health and safety represents the biggest challenge in any type of automation.\n\nThe first objective is to get the machines working in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, where \nthe authorities are keen to embrace any technology that cuts the number of accidents caused by overtired \noperators.\n\nHowever, the company is bound to be engaged in a few arm wrestles with law makers in other countries, so its \ndesigners can ill afford to have a buccaneering approach to machine safety.\n\nDefault protection modes that bring it to a standstill outside of its working boundaries are standard and more safety \nkit will be added in due course, including radar/lidar sensors.\n\nDevelopments in the autonomy of cars \u2013 particularly self-steering and automatic braking \u2013 are making the \ntechnology cheaper than ever before, but someone, somewhere will still have to be responsible.\n\nEarly models aren\u2019t set-up to drive on the roads and will  need carting to sites on a trailer \u2013 but the plan is to be able \nto send units between fields in the future. By that time, driverless cars are expected to be well established.\n\nBuilding implements\n\nOne of the perks of Dot is that it can be used for all sorts of tasks, including grain carting, cultivating, drilling and \nspraying.\n\nAll of the implements are mounted without wheels or hitches \u2013 instead it uses four ram-powered hooks to hoist the \nimplement on to cone-like guides, in turn forming the fourth side of the rectangular frame.\n\nDesigning the power unit first \u2013 with a single, clear horsepower rating and hydraulic capacity \u2013 means the \nimplements can be built to suit its capacity.\n\nThe company has assembled a range of items through sister firm SeedMaster, most of which have been adapted \nfrom standard, hydraulically driven tools.\n\n\n\nThe 9m drill, for instance, is simply one third of the firm\u2019s mainstream product and is able to offer variable rate and \nauto shut-off. Other products will include a 12-row planter, 18m sprayer with 3,785-litre tank, a 12.5m land roller and \n14t grain cart.\n\nShort-line manufacturers have also been invited to build their own Dot-ready implements and it has prompted a \nflurry of interest from companies such as Pattison Liquid Systems, which is developing a 36m sprayer.\n\nAlthough the development process is expensive, potential suppliers see Dot as a fast-tracked opportunity to get into \nthe robotics business without relying on the world\u2019s biggest ag machinery makers, and the standardised platform \nshould bring their production costs down in the long-term.\n\nOther potential sectors for automation include the repetitive tasks of feeding and cleaning duties on dairy farms \u2013 a \nmarket where the likes of Lely have already had plenty of success with smaller robotic units.\n\nThere have also been whacky-sounding whispers about making a combine. Dot\u2019s carrying capacity is enough to \ncope with the body of a reasonably sized combine, which could be paired with a second engine to cope with the \ndemand of both threshing and motive power.\n\nWhen will it be available?\n\nAs many as six units should be up and running for this season, with another 20 scheduled for production next year \nand many more in the pre-order book.\n\nThe company is initially focusing on western Canada, but it hopes to have a Europe-friendly model with a 3m \ntransport width ready within three years.\n\nThat timeline puts it well ahead of most other autonomous tractors being developed by universities and \nresearchers, which are predominantly small, electrically powered and miles from reaching mainstream production \nand large-scale operation.\n\nSurprisingly, the farm machinery market\u2019s biggest hitters have so far failed to get any sort of chokehold on the gold \nrush of autonomous ag. The likes of CNH, Fendt and Kubota have dabbled with driverless technology \u2013 and several \nothers have demoed master-and-slave-style systems \u2013 but, so far, their efforts seem to be more of a bombastic \nmarketing exercise than anything close to manufacturing.\n\nRedesigning seeders to work with Dot\n\nSeedMaster had to redesign its drills to make them easily adapted to run on Dot.\n\nTraditionally, the company has used a fairly standard layout of three staggered rows of coulters to maintain decent \ntrash flow when working on min- or zero-tilled land.\n\nTo reduce the space required for the implement, the company now uses spoked, ground-driven wheels between \neach coulter to walk trash through the seeder.\n\nThe 8in spokes poke a small hole in the soil as they bite in and avoid throwing soil into the other rows. This means \nthat each coulter\u2019s packer wheel properly gauges the working depth, running level with its neighbour to complete all \nof the soil movement before any of the packers pass over the drilled seed.\n\nThe design also makes servicing much easier, as each coulter can be accessed from the rear rather than having to \nscrabble around underneath the drill.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe holy grail of crimping is for cover crops to slowly die into a weed-supressing mat, covering the soil without the \nuse of chemical sprays or the plough.\n\n\n\nFor an organic grower, this would allow wheat crops to be direct-drilled after nitrogen-producing cover crops, \nimproving soil health while minimising diesel bills.\n\nIt could have wider benefits for conventional no-till farmers, especially if glyphosate were to be banned.\n\nSee also: Direct drilling is within reach for one organic grower\n\nWhile many UK growers remain sceptical of the practice, one organic grower from Oxfordshire is determined to get \nthe kit to work this season.\n\nWatch the video and read the report below:\n\nJames Alexander is trialling a crimper roller on the cover crops growing on his 323ha organic farm near Chipping \nNorton, with the hope that he will be direct-drilling cereals on the farm within three years.\n\nChevron design\n\nBut he faces several difficulties in achieving that aim. The first challenge is finding the right design for the crimper \nroller.\n\nAs the owner of cross-slot direct-drill manufacturer Primewest, he has chosen to design his own crimper based on \nplans available from the Rodale Institute in Pennsylvania, USA, rather than rely on the offerings already on the \nmarket in the UK.\n\nThe institute\u2019s plans, which are not patented, use bars fitted in a chevron pattern across the roller to crush the crop.\n\nAttaching curved blades in this pattern means there is always a point of contact and consistent pressure being \napplied to the ground, unlike designs based on straight bars, as these encourage bounce.\n\nMr Alexander says poorly thought-out design, rather than the process itself, is the reason for crimping\u2019s bad \nreputation in the industry, leading many growers to doubt that it is actually capable of working.\n\nBut crimping is a regular practice in the US.\n\n\u201cThe ones used in the US are often this shape; it just took a bit of engineering and thinking about,\u201d Mr Alexander \nsays.\n\nEach blade bolts on to the chassis individually to allow for easy replacement \u2013 handy on stony Cotswold soils.\n\nMix of species\n\nUnlike in the US, the UK is not blessed with a guaranteed summer.\n\nIf temperatures were consistently hot, then crimped plants would almost certainly die. But in the UK there is always \nthe risk that unseasonably mild weather and rain will encourage regrowth.\n\nInstead, to successfully crimp a cover crop on UK soils, Mr Alexander thinks timing is everything.\n\nIdeally the crop should be flowering before being crimped, but finding this stage is complicated because UK \ngrowers typically opt for a mix of species in their cover crop.\n\nIn the US growers predominantly opt for single crops of rye, with one flowering time.\n\nBut the UK has followed France\u2019s example of favouring a mix of species to protect against complete crop failures.\n\nIn the past Mr Alexander has grown vetch and oats as his nitrogen capturing cover crop within his rotation, but \nfound that oats can be crimped, mowed and disced and still grow back.\n\n\n\nSo instead this season he is trying a mixture of rye and vetch for the first time, in the hope that rye will prove to be \nas easy to crimp in the UK as it has in the US.\n\n\u201cIf you are trying to use a crimper I would only recommend using one, maybe two species. One idea could be to use \na mixture with a few species which would be taken out by frost to leave just two for crimping,\u201d he says.\n\nVetch\n\nVetch usually starts flowering on Mr Alexander\u2019s farm around the time of the Cereals event in mid-June.\n\nNormally as soon as most of the crop is in flower he would go in and cut the top off with a mower to prevent it from \nsetting seed and contaminating the following wheat crop.\n\nWhile some farmers struggle to grow a decent crop of vetch, Mr Alexander has no such problems, growing a \n\u201cstonking\u201d crop which is so big and bushy that it out-competes any weeds.\n\nIt is normally so big that it is impossible to cut with a mower in just one pass without stalling the tractor. Instead he \nsets the mower as high as possible to take half out before returning 10 days later to mow the rest.\n\nIt is then disced to ensure it is completely killed, then left over the summer and ploughed at the end of August or \nbeginning of September ready for wheat.\n\nSwitching to crimping would, therefore, reduce Mr Alexander\u2019s considerable fuel bill, while also improving the soil.\n\nThis season, while the cover crops established well, they were not looking good in the wet and cold conditions of \nFebruary, lacking both bulk and height.\n\nSince then the crop has gained ground, and stood at more than 5ft at the start of June.\n\nEarly failure\n\nHis first experimental attempt at crimping at the beginning of May failed, proving to be just too early as the crop has \nsince grown back.\n\n\u201cIt was far too early. We left it 10 days and if had even sort of died we would have carried on crimping, but it didn\u2019t,\u201d \nhe says.\n\nWhen he next had an attempt, at the start of June, the vetch was starting to flower, but rye grains were still running \nclear when crushed rather than being milky, which is the ideal stage for crimping.\n\nIf the crop is crimped at the ideal time the roller will crush the stem rather than cut it, limiting the amount of water left \nin the crushed sections and effectively making the plant kill itself, as it carries on growing and runs out of water.\n\nMr Alexander thinks it should take a week to 10 days for the crop to die, depending on the weather, but after 10 \ndays the results were mixed.\n\nDespite expectations, the rye completely died off while some of the vetch has started to grow back, indicating that \nfor successful crimping vetch must be in full flower, which this season was around mid-June.\n\nA second cover crop\n\nIf the sweet spot can be found for crimping then next year Mr Alexander plans to direct drill a second cover crop \nthrough the weed-suppressing mat formed by the crimping.\n\n\u201cIf we can get the mix right, and get it laid right, then we will put another cover crop in which will do even more good \nby keeping any nitrogen produced by the vetch from leaching out of the soil over the summer,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nThis would probably be spring beans, buckwheat or mustard, direct drilled three to four days after crimping.\n\nWinter wheat would then be direct drilled into these non-frost hardy varieties, leaving the weather to do the job of \nremoving the cover crop.\n\nMr Alexander already has plans for how to improve the design of the roller, which he hopes to have ready for next \nseason.\n\nHe plans to move the roller from being front-mounted to trailed, as this would allow the crimper to be made wider \nand heavier for better crimping.\n\nIt would also distribute the weight across the crimper better, as currently there is some spring-back at the edge of \nthe roller.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA dairy farmer is appealing to the public to help identify a shameless woman caught on camera appearing to fly-tip \non his land.\n\nJoe Tucker, 19, installed a small camera in a hedge at a fly-tipping \u201chotspot\u201d by the roadside of his farm in Banes, \nnear Bath in north-east Somerset.\n\nThe infrared, battery-operated camera, which Mr Tucker bought on eBay for \u00a370, was placed inside the hedge at a \nspot which has suffered from fly-tipping incidents on previous occasions.\n\nSee also: Ultimate guide to farm security\n\nThe footage \u2013 which was filmed in April \u2013 shows a woman, aged about 55-60 years old, park up in a black Audi Q5 \nor Q7 4x4 estate car and open the boot.\n\nThe camera was unable to record the vehicle\u2019s registration number.\n\nThe woman nonchalantly removes a large plastic bag and chucks it by the hedge.\n\nShe returns to the boot to fetch some old wooden garden border fencing, which is also dumped.\n\nFinally, the woman presses the button to close the boot and gets back in the car.\n\nThe discarded bag was stuffed with bark, old black roof felt and several other bags tucked together.\n\nThe woman has short, brown hair, which is greying.

field where the baler dropped them, Geoff Eyre wasn\u2019t \na fan of the somewhat tedious job of collecting wrapped rounds and steadily loading and unloading to avoid \ndamage.\n\nThe Derbyshire farmer has about 400ha of mixed land, ranging from heather-covered hills to lowland grass fields, \nwith a well-established agricultural merchant shop, now run by his son and daughter, and heather harvesting work \namong general farm duties.\n\nA regular entrant to the Farm Invention Competition run every winter on the FW machinery desk, Mr Eyre says that \nhe is at his happiest when he sees a farmer using his design and getting the most out of it.\n\nSee also: Driver\u2019s view: Lely Tornado baler-wrapper\n\nTraileyre\n\nHis manufacturing adventure started in 1983 when he built the first Traileyre, a simple round-bale collector, which \nwon a gold medal at the Royal Agricultural Show in 1986.\n\nSince then, the building rights to the Traileyre have been sold to Ritchies in Scotland, which now sells around 25 \nunits a year in sizes from 6- to 10-bale units.\n\nThe simple design uses bale spikes mounted on steel arms connected to a hydraulic ram.\n\nSee the Traileyre in action in the video and read the full report below.\n\nEach of these arms folds down to the side of the trailer when the correct switch in the cab is flicked and spears the \nbale the driver has driven alongside.\n\nOnce the spike is home, the opposite spool valve control is activated and the bale lifts and sits on the trailer, with \nthe spike keeping it secure.\n\nmailto:philip.case@reedbusiness.com\n\n\nEach spike is mounted on a five-degree angle, so as the ram lifts the bale off the ground, it crowds back slightly as \nyou would naturally do if you were using a loader, to avoid any scrubbing as the tractor continues forward.\n\nHowever, Mr Eyre had a vision of a full wrapping and collecting service provided by one man and a tractor.\n\nSo he and his two workshop demons, Neil Deakin and Kieran Logon, have been beavering away in the workshop \non and off since 2015 to develop a wrapping system that will outcompete offerings from the biggest grassland \nmachinery makers.\n\nWrapeyre\n\nTo complement the trailer, a wrapping unit and conveyor was designed to load bales without the need for a loader.\n\nThe team constructed a curved conveyor with the idea that the Traileyre can reverse into the middle and drop a full \nload of six or eight bales on each side and the conveyor will cart them around to the wrapping unit.\n\nHowever, the complicated curved design meant it was too costly to consider manufacturing and the most time-\nconsuming process for the trailer driver was backing into the curve and getting the correct position for dropping off \nevery time \u2013 something that hindered output drastically.\n\nWith the curved unit destined for the bin, the team chopped the moon-shaped end off and were left with two straight \nconveyor units, each able to take three bales.\n\nThe simple conveyors have been built with off-the-shelf parts from various companies either sourced on the web or \nin the local area.\n\nSprocket drives at either end rotate and have two chains on either edge, running the length of the conveyor. \nGrooved bars spaced in the middle grip the bale and move it down the conveyor.\n\nThe design has helped to keep cost low and replication easy.\n\nWrapping units\n\nThe wrappers are adapted McHale stationary units that have been lowered by around 6in to fit in with the loading \nheight from the conveyor and avoid any snagging, which happened on the original version.\n\nBy adding a second wrapping unit to mirror the original and make use of the second conveyor, output was doubled \nand the tractor and Traileyre was able to drive in, drop the load and drive out forwards again in under a minute.\n\nPower for the wrapping system comes from a stationary 27hp Lombardini diesel engine, which has two 30 litres/min \nhydraulic pumps serving each wrapping system separately.\n\nIt barely moves off tickover, so fuel use is considerably less than having an old tractor powering the wrapper.\n\nIt has not been plain sailing since then as there have been numerous modifications and adjustments to fit in with the \nnew system, including feed rollers, controls units and roll holders.\n\nAlways mindful that one day he may sell the units to paying punters, health and safety is a key consideration and \nMr Eyre seeks advice from the Health and Safety Executive when a major change is made.\n\nThe latest modification required is to reduce the trip hazard the conveyor causes as currently someone can tread in \nthe centre of the moving conveyor.\n\nHelping the bale onto the wrapper unit has also been improved by adjusting the lift arm to include a set of wheels \nfrom an old animal feed trough, so the bale is now rolled onto the table rather than being forced by the metal arm.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nMr Eyre is confident that the two wrapping units running in conjunction with a Traileyre, hauling from a nearby field, \ncan collect and wrap 180 bales per hour at its peak output, which he claims for the capital cost of the setup, would \neasily knock a \u00a31 per bale from the contracting price.\n\nWhen we visited, Mr Eyre had the process running and managed to load, wrap and stack five bales in under 2.3 \nminutes.\n\nLoader hours will also be reduced as it will only be handling the bale once to remove the round from the wrapper, \nwe\u2019re told.\n\nHe is keen for the setup to be a one-man operation, with future modifications including fabricating the two \nconveyors to lift onto each side of the Traileyre via the bale collecting spikes.\n\nThe wrappers will be loaded separately by telehandler into the middle of the trailer, before the conveyors are \nconnected and hoisted on the side with the roll holders folded down for road transport.  \n\nThere are also plans to use a monster 600-bale roll at six layers a bale, rather than the staggered two-roll system \ncurrently employed, which can manage around 120 bales before it needs to be changed.\n\nThe roll holders are made by Film Technique in Wiltshire, and mounted in the standard arrangement, but bigger \nrolls will be horizontally mounted due to their weight.\n\nFuture plans\n\nAs with any new product, getting it to market and in front of prospective customers will be the biggest hurdle.\n\nAs there are still tweaks being made, the Warpeyre won\u2019t be on sale until Mr Eyre is happy with it.\n\nHowever, if it stirs enough interest, he will also have to find someone to build it as he admits his farm workshop \narea isn\u2019t up to full-scale commercial manufacturing.\n\nHis current challenge is upgrading the electrics of the system so the loader driver stacking the wrapped bales can \nbe in control of both wrapping units.\n\nOnce this has been sorted, the labour requirement will be halved and the cash savings will be increased.\n\nBoth wrappers will also still have manual controls, should the technology ever fail.\n\nWhen farmers see the current machine, there is a mixed reaction as there are no shiny paint jobs or a well-known \nmanufacturers\u2019 name splashed along the side, but Mr Eyre is confident that once the machines get to work, farmers \nand contractors will be convinced by the output.\n\nProposed pricing doesn\u2019t look too bad, either. The whole package is likely to sit around the \u00a320,000 mark for two \nconveyors, wrappers and a Lombardini engine.\n\nRemote-control wrappers may bump the price up further, as will having the wrapping units specially made to fit the \nsystem, which is also in the pipeline.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe next generation of farmers are young, passionate, experimental and brave \u2013 but most importantly, they are \nsucceeding.\n\n\n\nThe Exmoor Hill Farming Network is one organisation that has prioritised supporting young agricultural enthusiasts \nby creating a peer support Next Generation group.\n\nFarmers aged 30 and under are welcome, and the group currently has 100 members, a mixture of farmers\u2019 sons \nand daughters and young people trying to start a career in agriculture.\n\nVideo\n\nHow it started\n\nTwo young farmers' experience\n\nNationwide support\n\nGetting into micro-farming\n\nSee also: Video: Exmoor group tackles farm support and rural isolation\n\nWatch the video and read the full report below\n\nCreating the group\n\nNetwork chairman Dave Knight explains that the idea came after a survey the organisation completed a few years \nago identified that Exmoor had a high percentage of young people in farming.\n\n\u201cOne of the key points we found is that Exmoor actually has, on average, a younger farmer age, running, on \naverage, larger farms,\u201d Mr Knight says.\n\n\u201cThen within that there are a huge number of young people who are coming back into the area and wanting to farm. \nIt was absolutely vital that we did everything we could to help facilitate them.\u201d\n\nCreating and building the group was a challenge, network officer Katherine Williams admits, especially in an area \nwith a tight-knit young farmers\u2019 club community, which they didn\u2019t want to infringe on.\n\nAfter trialling several unsuccessful ideas, the network now runs events where it secures a farmer as host for, say, a \nfarm walk, and then invites the local YFCs and the Next Generation members to attend for free.\n\n\u201cThe members told me they wanted assistance with training and things like tractor and trailer tests, rather than \ngroup learning events,\u201d Miss Williams says.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is that getting them out and about on each other\u2019s farms, or farms where they can learn from \nothers who might be slightly older, works really well because they feel in their comfort zone.\u201d\n\nLearning from each other\n\nMeeting new people, learning about innovative things, putting others\u2019 ideas into practice and socialising with friends \nare all parts of the experience.\n\nSarah Eveleigh, 28, farms at West llkerton on Exmoor with her family. Since joining the Next Generation group she \nhas completed pesticide training courses and her trailer test, attended farm tours and gained \u201call the bits of paper \nyou need to be employable\u201d.\n\nGetting people off their own farm and allowing them to talk about their problems is really important, she says.\n\n\u201cSome people, if they\u2019re just in their little farming bubble, think \u2018why is it all happening to me and only to me?\u2019 But if \nyou get out and talk to people, actually everyone\u2019s had that problem this year, and it takes a bit of weight off your \nshoulders and you can find out how other people are dealing with things, so it\u2019s really helpful to share the load.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeef and sheep farmer Sam Smyth, 28, says the Next Generation group attracts enthusiastic young farmers looking \nfor new ideas to make their farms more efficient and he believes everyone can learn from their peers.\n\n\u201cWe have to be prepared to try new things to keep the farming industry going. It\u2019s good for us young farmers to \nhave these opportunities,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cDue to rural isolation, without groups like this there would be a lot of talented and knowledgeable people unable to \nget together to share their experiences.\u201d\n\nFirst-generation young farmers struggle to find tenancy\n\nFirst-generation farmers Kim Sharpe and Will Giles farm beef and sheep in Minehead and joined the Exmoor Hill \nFarming Network two years ago.\n\nThey became members of the Next Generation group hoping to meet other young farmers, discuss their difficulties \nof getting into farming and learn from others\u2019 experiences.\n\nThe couple attend most of the events that network officer Katherine Williams organises, not just the ones about \nsheep or cattle, to broaden their farming knowledge.\n\nThey find the information evenings, which range from lambing preparation to artificial insemination and rural \ndevelopment, the most useful.\n\nMs Sharpe, 23, and Mr Giles, 30, currently rent land and are trying to get a farm tenancy, but are finding it difficult, \nhaving come \u201csecond place\u201d a number of times. They find the network useful for making contacts, hearing about \nland opportunities and general advice.\n\nMs Sharpe says: \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to get that foot in the door. We know what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re working well and \nwe\u2019ve been told that we\u2019re doing it well. It\u2019s just having someone to put that faith in you to enable you as a first-\ngeneration young farmer to get into things.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about getting our name out there and getting young farmers as a whole out there. We are the next generation \nthat has to work through whatever\u2019s going to happen with Brexit, and the future is in us.\u201d\n\nMr Giles believes there is a gap in the market, with many farmers retiring without anyone to take on their farms, and \nhe wants new people to be able to come into the industry.\n\nHe says: \u201cThey need to be able to build a future because the farming network is still needed. Anything that can help \nthat benefits all of us.\u201d\n\nHow young farmers can find support nationwide\n\nStaffordshire farmer Richard Bower is the former chairman of the NFU next generation policy forum, a group of \nmembers under 40 who want to be involved in political decision-making.\n\nMr Bower says there are lots of opportunities available for young farmers now, and he advises getting off farm \nregularly and engaging in as many events as possible to learn new skills, share ideas and collaborate.\n\nHe adds: \u201cThe National Federation of Young Farmers\u2019 Clubs has groups locally, in some areas there are events \nspecifically to discuss what young people want from agricultural policy post Brexit, and some agricultural societies \nnow have next generation groups, like in my area.\n\n\u201cThe way we farm now is different to the past and how we farm in the future will be different, so the more ideas you \nhave in the future, the better.\u201d\n\nMr Bower has identified other ways for young farmers to find support in agriculture:\n\n\n\nFresh Start land matching service The Land Partnerships Service matches young farmers with landowners/farmers \nwho do not have a next generation to take over their farms.\n\nUnder 40s Fruit Growers A forward-thinking group who go on international study tours.\n\nThe Farmers Club Under 30s A fantastic group who have guest speakers at the Farmers Club in London and run \nfarm walks nationally in the spring and autumn.\n\nThe Henry Plumb Foundation Provides funding and a mentor for young farmers who have a project idea.\n\nA Focus on Nature (AFON) A group of young farmers/stakeholders who discuss the environment.\n\nTesco Future Farmer Foundation Supports new entrants and young farmers to launch their farming careers.\n\nCo-op\u2019s Farming Pioneers A scheme offering business skills and a support network to farmers aged 18-34.\n\nMuller\u2019s Next Generation programme Designed to develop and enhance young farmers\u2019 skill sets.\n\nNational Sheep Association\u2019s Next Generation Encouraging and supporting the sheep farmers and service \nproviders of the future.\n\nNFYFC has its own Agricultural and Rural Issues (AGRI) steering group for members, which is one of five steering \ngroups that feed in ideas to the national council.\n\nChairman James Hutchinson believes that to succeed in farming young people need determination, an open mind, \na good work ethic, common sense and a passion for the industry.\n\n\u201cWhile we know financial support can be difficult for people who are interested in farming, there are opportunities \nout there and we recommend exploring all of what\u2019s on offer,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAgriculture is a massive sector and needs people with technology and research skills as we work increasingly with \ndigital machinery and new technology.\u201d\n\nGetting into micro-farming\n\nThe Exmoor Hill Farming Network also has a peer support and discussion group aimed specifically at micro-farming \nmembers.\n\nTypically, these members have moved into the area and bought smallholdings, but do not necessarily want to be \nidentified as smallholders. Their farms may not be their main source of income, but they are running them with the \naim of making a profit.\n\nNetwork chairman Dave Knight explains: \u201cThat group has been a success and we\u2019ve managed to engage with \npeople who I don\u2019t think we otherwise would have, because they probably feel a little bit set aside from the main \nfarming community.\u201d\n\nThe peer support groups are designed to target the particular needs and interests of their members, with activities \nand events planned accordingly.\n\nWhen asked what event would really benefit them, the micro-farming members suggested a rundown on how to use \nthe local market \u2013 perhaps an obvious task for those who have used them day in, day out for years, but a daunting \nprospect for others.\n\nThe group were shown round the local, farmer-owned Cutcombe Market by an auctioneer who explained how \neverything worked, from driving in to unloading stock, booking in and the auction process.\n\n\n\nMr Knight says: \u201cSuddenly it\u2019s not this big frightening prospect of driving into market with your stock with all the \nother local farmers. That\u2019s a brilliant example of something we can do.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nBrothers Peter and Philip Le Maistre are sixth-generation Jersey farmers and for them this potato season has been \nthe worst since covering spuds with plastic started to be used on the island in the late 1970s.\n\nAs frosts were forecast at the end of February, they put insulating fleece on top of protective plastic, but even on \nfavoured southern slopes temperatures dived and crops were hit by frost and then heavy snow.\n\nPeter said it was the most challenging year he has witnessed, with harvesting on his first flat fields only starting in \nearly May, when it would usually commence  in mid-April.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the worst season we have known in terms of frost and wet soils since we started using plastic in 1979,\u201d he told \nFarmers Weekly.\n\nSee also: Spud Watch: Good conditions for seed planting\n\nYield from their early steep cotils fields were disappointing, with yields down to 0.4t/ha against an expected 1.6t/ha.\n\nWatch the video report below.\n\nHit by frost\n\nTheir first level fields were hit by frost when the spud shoots were about 100-125mm high. It wiped them out, so it \ntook time for other shoots to emerge, which is why the start to harvest is so late.\n\nFull mechanical lifting started on 2 May this season, with yields down at 1.6t/ha, when 2.4t/ha was expected. \nBecause of a lot of small potato tubers, two extra pickers were also needed to follow the potato harvester.\n\nIronically, although the frost hit yields, the potato samples are good, with not too many large tubers. They are likely \nto meet a good market as warmer weather in the critical UK mainland market boosts demand, said Philip.\n\nThe Le Maistre family grow 120ha of Jersey Royals on the 280ha mixed Master Farm, in the east of the island, \nalong with a 200-strong Jersey herd and an area of organic vegetables such as courgettes and cauliflowers.\n\nThey are the last of the individual island growers who supply their early crop to the Jersey Potato Company.\n\nSecond crops\n\nOn their flatter land they look to follow the early spuds with three second crops of spring barley, maize for silage \nand temporary grass for feeding dairy youngstock.\n\nThe spring barley crop gives a relatively low yield of 5t/ha, but the only input the crop receives is a herbicide, while \nthe straw and grain is very valuable  as it means they don't have to be imported them from mainland UK.\n\n\u201cThe straw is very valuable as the freight costs from the UK costs more than the straw itself,\u201d added Philip.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nJersey\u2019s early potato harvest is almost a month late this spring, with yields expected to be down one-fifth after the \nBeast from the East frosted off young plants barely out of the ground.\n\nLiftings of the earliest crops grown on the steep slopes tumbling down towards the sea are showing low tuber \nnumbers as the Channel Island struggles to meet supermarket demands from the UK mainland.\n\n\n\nThe searing cold in late February frosted off early growth, forcing the potato industry, which is Jersey\u2019s biggest \nexporter, to scramble and reschedule deliveries stretching all the way into July.\n\nWilliam Church of the Jersey Royal Company said after a desperately poor start to the season, harvesting is now \nstarting to pick up, while other early spud areas such as Cornwall, Pembrokeshire and Suffolk have all been hit \nbadly by poor weather.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a really challenging start to the season, but now going into May we have some excellent-looking crops,\u201d \nhe told Farmers Weekly.\n\nSee also: Video: Spud planting races to catch up after late start to season\n\nWorst season for 40 years\n\nJersey Royal growers say the season is the worst they have known for at least 40 years \u2013 since the practice of \ncovering early potatoes with plastic was first introduced to the island in the 1970s.\n\nSub-zero temperatures blown in from Siberia made for a testing time, as even double\u2013covered crops with plastic \nand also fleece suffered as temperatures dipped to -6C.\n\nWatch the video report below.\n\nHand-lifting on the vertiginous coastal slopes, know as cotils, is now finished, as picking teams move on to more \nlevel ground and yields of Jersey Royal new potatoes start to pick up.\n\nThese early crops can be grown in 10-12 weeks on Jersey\u2019s light and well-drained soils, and are harvested using a \ntractor-mounted winch-operated lifter that exposes the tubers for an army of pickers to gather.\n\nThe main outdoor spud crop is planted from January through to April, with harvest in a normal season from the end \nof March through to July, and at peak time the island can export 600-700t/day to the UK mainland.\n\nDown by one-fifth\n\nMr Church, the group\u2019s director of sales and marketing, believes island production will be down one-fifth to about \n24,000t this season compared with as much as 28,000-30,000t in a more normal year.\n\nHe is busy rescheduling supermarket deliveries to customers such as Tesco and pushing through big UK retail \npromotions in June and well into July.\n\n\u201cThe supermarkets are being really understanding as we are looking to extend our agreements into July, whereas \nthey usually tail off towards the end of June,\u201d he said.\n\nNormally, Jersey Royal\u2019s big month is May, quickly followed by Cornish earlies hitting the market in June and the \nSuffolk crop being lifted in July, but this season all those timings look like being a month later.\n\nMr Church\u2019s group have a sister company in Cornwall and down in the far south-west of England, many crops have \nalso been hit by frost and will be late maturing.\n\nBright spot\n\nThe one bright spot is that prices have held up due to lack of supply from Jersey and the other early areas. \nWholesale prices on Jersey Royals were holding at \u00a31.50/lb or \u00a33,300/t in early May amid hopes that prices may \nnot fall too low in the extended season.\n\n\n\nMr Church\u2019s company accounts for about 70% of the island\u2019s 2,500ha of potatoes, growing, harvesting, packing \nand distributing the crop. Each year it rents land from about 120 landlords. The rest of market is covered by a \nhandful of growers supplying rival potato group Albert Bartlett.\n\nThe Jersey Royal Company, which was bought in 2014 by Produce Investments, the owner of fellow potato \ncompany Greenvale, usually starts planting spuds in 10ha of glasshouses just before Christmas and this crop starts \nbeing lifted at the end of February.\n\nThe supply of these indoor crops, priced as high at \u00a35,000/t, was stretched out until the delayed outdoor crops \nbecame available in April after being hit by the heavy frost, almost unknown in the mild maritime climate of Jersey.\n\nMr Church explains that the frosts were well forecast and the group added fleece on top of plastic to protect the \ndelicate young plants, but the double-covering simply was not good enough.\n\nSevere frosts\n\nYoung green shoots were severely frosted and killed off, and crops took time to compensate and throw up a new \nset of potato shoots.\n\n\u201cThe very first outdoor crops showed yields of only 10% of what was expected and we were digging yields of less \nthan 1t/acre rather than a more normal 6t/acre on the early slopes,\u201d he said.\n\nHarvesting has now moved to flatter fields in May, but hand lifting is still used as these are often small fields where \ngreat chunks of granite can cause damage to heavy machinery.\n\nIntensive mono-culture where potatoes are grown every season on the same land requires special measures to \nkeep potato growers\u2019 two biggest headaches - nematodes and blight - at bay.\n\nSome growers say early spuds are often lifted before potato cyst nematodes become a real problem, but others are \nkeen to keep the ground as clean as possible of these destructive pests.\n\nMustard mixes\n\nAs soon as spuds are lifted on the early slopes, mustard seed mixes are sown, which later in the year can be mown \nand worked into the soils to act as a biofumigant to give some control against these pernicious pests.\n\nOn the steep cotils, mustard mixes are not often used, but rather a standard mix including barley, vetch and \nlegumes is grown to help fix nitrogen and act as a green manure to feed next year\u2019s potato crop.\n\nIn addition, Solanum sisymbriifolium or \u201cprickly potato\u201d can be planted, which acts as a trap crop as the stem and \nleaves contain solasodine, which makes the plant very resistant to many pests, including nematodes.\n\nBlight disease can be a problem in the warm, humid weather of the island, with potato fields never very far from the \nsea. Therefore preventative fungicides are used, while bad blight patches are sprayed off with herbicides.\n\nAnother pressing problem is labour, with Mr Church\u2019s group relying on about 420 seasonal workers, largely from \nPoland, with others from Romania and Portugal also arriving to help lift the spuds and operate the grading and \npacking lines.\n\nBut the fall in the pound after the 2016 Brexit vote, combined with an upturn in the Polish economy, is causing fears \nabout providing future labour needs.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nCereal goers were treated to a drill-off at this

the EU on 29 March \n2019.\n\nmailto:chris@fcn.org.uk\n\n\nThe NFU says it hopes to remain a Copa-Cogeca member \u2013 at least during the Brexit transition period which is due \nto last from 29 March 2019 to 31 December 2020.\n\n'Foreseeable future'\n\nThe Copa-Cogeca praesidium \u2013 which comprises representatives from its member organisations \u2013 is due to vote on \nthe issue of continued NFU membership on 14 June.\n\nNFU director of policy Andrew Clark told Farmers Weekly it made sense for the union to remain a Copa-Cogeca \nmember \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe NFU believes that working closely with our European colleagues on EU farm policy \u2013 and our shared \nfarming future \u2013 is incredibly valuable.\u201d\n\nThe NFU\u2019s membership of Copa-Cogeca played a vital part in that work, added Mr Clark.\n\n\u201cFor the foreseeable future, British farming will continue to follow the rules laid out by the CAP, alongside the \nthousands of other EU regulations and decisions that affect members on a daily basis.\n\nEuropean allies\n\n\u201cThe NFU will continue to fully represent the voice of British farming during this uncertain time, working with \nEuropean allies to strengthen our messages and ensure members get the best possible outcomes.\u201d\n\nThe Brussels-based Agra Facts news service says \u201cthere are no provisions in Copa or Cogeca statutes for this kind \nof situation\u201d.\n\nBut it adds several Copa-Cogeca members \u201chave underlined the importance of closest possible collaboration to \nminimise any disruption in our economic and political relations to the UK\u201d.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFarmers have been warned to be aware of the complexities surrounding the use of sideways loss relief  to minimise \nincome tax bills.\n\nAccountant Saffery Champness said it was offering \u201ca word of caution\u201d about the relief for losses arising from \nfarming after a number of tax tribunals involving farmers which have ruled in favour of HMRC.\n\nIn principle, sideways loss relief can be used where losses, arising from a trade undertaken on a commercial basis \nand with a view to making a profit, can be offset against any other income arising in the same or previous tax year, \nthereby reducing an individual\u2019s liability to income tax.\n\nSee also: Farmers to face new digital tax regime\n\nLosses can also be carried forward and automatically offset against the first profits arising from the same trade, in \nthe absence of any other claims, but not against future other income.\n\nThere is, however, a restriction on the amount of losses that can be offset against other income in a given tax year, \nthe limit being the greater of \u00a350,000 or 25% of an individual\u2019s adjusted net income.\n\nHobby farming rules\n\nThe hobby farming rules also introduce further restrictions on the use of losses arising from farming.\n\nThese rules mean after five successive years, sideways loss relief will usually be denied for any losses made in \nyear six, and these can then only be carried forward for use against future farming profits.\n\n\n\nThe rules were introduced in the 1960s to stop people claiming they were farming and then claiming their losses \nagainst other non-farming income.\n\nReasonable expectation\n\nAn exemption is available from the five-year restriction where farming activities meet the reasonable expectation of \nprofit test, and where a \u201ccompetent farmer\u201d carrying on farming activities in the current year would reasonably \nexpect future profits, but could not over the previous five years have expected their activities to become profitable \nuntil after the end of the current tax year.\n\nMartyn Dobinson, director at Saffery Champness, and a member of the firm\u2019s landed estates and rural business \ngroup, said: \u201cThis is a very complex area which has been tested a number of times at the tax tribunal, with victories \nfor the taxpayer [ie the farmer] being few and far between.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018hobby farming\u2019 rules still apply in the case of unforeseen and one-off events, such as poor weather and \ndisease, and market factors are not an acceptable argument for longer-term losses being made.\u201d Mr Dobinson \nadded the losses clock would be reset by a year of profit.\n\n\u201cHowever, transferring the business between spouses, or to or from limited companies, cannot, due to anti-\navoidance rules, restart the clock.\u201d\n\nAccounting year\n\nComplications also arise where the farm\u2019s accounting year and the tax year do not match.\n\nIn such instances, it can mean the restriction regarding the number of years can also kick in a year earlier than \nanticipated.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nVandals are causing huge losses on livestock farms and jeopardising precious forage supplies in a new wave of \nrural crime sweeping the

been slashed open, but some have been set alight while still in the field.\n\nThe risks associated with arson are particularly high given the prolonged spell of hot, dry weather.\n\nSee also: 7 tips to foil farm arsonists\n\nOn top of this, low grass growth has left some farmers concerned about forage availability. Having bales vandalised \nand destroyed is adding further pressure to livestock farmers already facing shortages.\n\nOn Monday (25 June), Matthew Senior, an organic dairy farmer in Crewkerne, Somerset, discovered his bales set \nalight at milking time. He is now unlikely to have enough forage to last through the winter.\n\n\u201cWe had 80 bales waiting to be stacked. All were slashed open and those on the front of the stack had been set \nalight,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will add another \u00a3300 to the cost of the bales, because they\u2019ll have to be rewrapped and six are \ncompletely unusable. My heart just sank \u2013 why have they done that?\u201d\n\nFurther north, Jeanette Mcguinness had 26 bales slashed open at her livery yard near Manchester. \u201cWe have all \nthe equipment to rewrap them, it\u2019s just a waste of time and effort,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was lucky it hadn\u2019t rained.\u201d\n\nShe will now have to sell the bales at a reduced price to livestock farms.  \n\n\n\nA similar incident has been reported in Lincolnshire, where Nigel Wright had 16 bales slashed open. \u201cWe had to \nremove the net, roll them out and then rebale them - a waste of time and money,\u201d he said. \n\nDavid George, regional communications adviser at NFU Mutual, said: \u201cUnfortunately, farms are vulnerable to this \nsort of casual vandalism and it is clearly impractical to keep silage bales under lock and key 24 hours a day.\n\n\u201cAlways report incidents of vandalism and criminal damage to the police, keep an eye out for any suspicious \nvehicles or people, and sign up to your local Farm Watch or Crime Watch scheme.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nWelsh farmers could lose about 40% of their support funding unless the UK government ring-fences the money that \nis currently spent on Welsh agriculture, First Minister Carwyn Jones has warned.\n\nThe general budget that Wales receives from central government is calculated using the Barnett formula \u2013 a \nmechanism which distributes money to the four UK nations based on population.\n\nSee also: MPs blast Defra\u2019s \u2018vague\u2019 approach to Brexit\n\nBut Mr Jones told the Farmers\u2019 Union of Wales (FUW) annual general meeting in Aberystwyth this week that using \nthe same formula to replace the funding Wales currently receives under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) \nwould seriously disadvantage Welsh farmers.\n\n\u201cThe last thing we want to see is agriculture funding become Barnett-ised,\" he told the meeting on Monday (June \n18).\n\nIf this happened, it has been estimated that Wales would receive about 40% less for agriculture than it currently \ndoes from the CAP.\n\nMr Jones insisted that the funding that will replace Wales\u2019 share of the CAP budget \u2013 currently understood to be \nabout \u00a3329 million \u2013 must be allocated as a separate payment.\n\n\u201cFunding for agriculture must not have to compete with health and education,\u201d he said.\n\nReassurances\n\nFUW president Glyn Roberts said the union had received \u201cacknowledgement\u201d from Defra secretary Michael Gove \nthat rural funding through the Barnett formula would not be appropriate for Wales and the other devolved nations.\n\nWelsh agriculture will remain a devolved issue after Brexit, and the first minister said this offered Wales a \u201conce-in-\na-generation\u201d chance to redesign policies.\n\nMr Jones said the Basic Payment Scheme was not the best tool for supporting food production.\n\n\u201cWe need to change the way we support farmers,\u201d he said, promising a \u201cradical approach\u201d to agriculture policies. \n\u201cSome change might be considerable, but we can\u2019t stand still.\u201d\n\nOn trade, he described the prospect of leaving the single European market as \u201cinsanity\u201d and said the Welsh \ngovernment would not tolerate that outcome.\n\nHe singled out lamb production as the sector most likely to be threatened by that.\n\nA new Welsh government consultation on future farm support is expected in July.\n\nProcurement\n\n\n\nOne farmer in the audience suggested that breaking away from EU state aid rules after Brexit could pave the way to \npublic procurement contracts for lamb and other farmed produce that would benefit Welsh farmers.\n\nBut Mr Jones believed such a protectionist approach would have negative repercussions for the industry, because \nother countries would react with similar policies and close the door to Welsh produce.\n\n\u201cBe careful what you wish for,\u201d he warned.\n\nCash available to help farmers prepare for Brexit\n\nTwo thousand Welsh beef and sheep farmers are to be financially supported to benchmark their technical \nperformance in a new \u00a32.1 million initiative announced by the Welsh government.\n\nFirst Minister Carwyn Jones told the FUW AGM that the benchmarking initiative \u2013 a first for the red meat sector \u2013 \nwas intended to help Welsh livestock farmers prepare for Brexit.\n\nThe funding is coming from the Welsh government's EU transition fund.\n\nFUW president Glyn Roberts said the investment would allow farmers to assess the financial status of their \nbusinesses to help them prepare for Brexit.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFarm operations manager Sam Glover (21) chats to us about his growing machinery fleet, why he has chosen a \nbrace of Agrifac Condor sprayers to cover the vast acreage and the reason his tractor fleet is exclusively red.\n\nHe also reveals why he has switched from running two sugar beet harvesters in previous years, to just one for the \ncoming campaign and why he still favours older Claas combines.\n\nSee also: See what's in other farmers' machinery sheds \n\nHow brand loyal are you?\n\nAs far as the combines go, Claas is the tried-and-tested brand. My dad, Tim, had a Claas Dominator 86 on the \nfamily farm, so it\u2019s stemmed for there.\n\nAlthough we have tried other brands, the backup and parts availability from Claas dealer Manns is second to none \nin our area.\n\nFor the past five years we have run a fleet of Case tractors and really like the CVX transmission and comfortable \ncabs, but when we first got going, we were solely McCormick.\n\nThe sprayers are Agrifac and as with all our kit, it boils down to reliability and helping the business develop. \n\nFavourite dealer?\n\nWe get on well with Ernest Doe Power based at Fakenham, which is about 30 minutes from us and where most of \nour kit comes from.\n\nDavid Gricks is the branch manager and has looked after us well over the past five years, and there\u2019s an engineer \nout the same day if we have an issue.\n\nFavourite bit of kit?\n\nThe Agrifac Condor is my favourite piece of kit, mainly because I drive it all spring, so I pretty much live in it.\n\n\n\nI like the boom stability and cab suspension, and the newest machine has Trimble RTK satellite, which means it is \nfairly relaxed when you get in big fields.\n\nIn spring 2017, our days started at 2:30am and finished at about 9pm. We covered about 200ha as the weather \nlimited decent spray days, although there is only a certain amount of time you can do these hours for.\n\nOur newest 2016 model already has 3,800 hours on the clock and has covered more than 22,000ha.\n\nLeast favourite?\n\nThe He-Va subsoiler \u2013 not because it does a bad job, but when there is a sign of weeds or some long stubble, you \nspend most of the time unplugging the legs.\n\nContracting facts\n\nBusiness Glover Agricultural Services, West Dereham, Norfolk\n\nStaff Sam Glover, plus 10 full-time and two self-employed staff\n\nWorkload\n\nSpraying \u2013 20,000ha\n\nBaling and chasing \u2013 25,000 bales\n\nCombining \u2013 1,300ha\n\nSugar beet harvesting \u2013 1,800 ha\n\nCereal drilling \u2013 600ha\n\nSugar beet drilling \u2013 250ha\n\nMuck- and Limex spreading, plus sub-contracting for large vegetable growers\n\nLatest purchase?\n\nWe have just purchased a new Ropa Tiger 6 sugar beet harvester, which has a 40kph gearbox that will speed up \njourneys around the county and allow us to spend more time in the field.\n\nThe RR lifter is a huge leap forward from our last model and the single-row adjustment will help reduce the amount \nof wearing parts that need replacing.\n\nWe used to run two Vervaet harvesters and this latest Ropa Tiger will see us drop down to one, so it may be a \ntesting season, although we plan to double-shift it and run 24 hours a day.\n\nOldest machine in the fleet?\n\nOur oldest machine still in full-time service is our baby Claas Lexion 460 combine, which is an R-registered model.\n\nDespite being the oldest, it is our most reliable combine, as it has minimal electronics and only had a couple of \nhydraulic hoses go last year.\n\nWe find it better to run two smaller and one large combine, rather than two monster machines. Some of the field \nsizes around here are as small as 3ha, so having a nimble machine more than pays for itself in these areas. \n\nHow long do you keep machines for?\n\n\n\nAll our Case tractors are on extended 5,000- or 6,000-hour warranties and due to our workload, most will easily hit \nthis figure within three years, so will be changed before the warranty expires.\n\nOur latest Pumas were delivered last August and one is already on 1,800 hours. We have on average three new \ntractors a year.\n\nWhat\u2019s next of your wish list?\n\nWe had a Case Optum 300 on demo last harvest to provide more firepower on the cultivation work.\n\nWe liked the AFS 700 screen and the cab is more comfortable than our Puma tractors. I\u2019d like to think we will have \none here for this autumn.\n\nMost expensive repair bill?\n\nOne of our early Case Puma 165s was under a year old on 1,200 hours when it gave us a hefty repair bill after it \ndeveloped a problem with its rear brakes.\n\nWe sent it to the dealer to be repaired, but the warranty didn\u2019t cover it, so we had to fit the \u00a36,000 bill.\n\nWe thought it was sorted, but later that year the same issue reoccurred on the same tractor and once again, the bill \nwas picked up by us.\n\nWhat couldn\u2019t you live without in the workshop?\n\nWe don\u2019t do a lot of inventing and most machines have their own service packages, but all our combines are older \nmodels and are serviced by my uncle, who has his own engineering business on site and is a bit of a Claas \nspecialist.\n\nDo you buy second-hand?\n\nNot really. Due to the hours we put on machines, warranties are valuable, so we tend to buy most things new to \navoid nasty surprises.\n\nFavourite job?\n\nSpraying. Possibly due to the sprayers we run, but I love being up early and getting lots of land covered in a day.\n\nLeast favourite?\n\nPaperwork.\n\nWhat\u2019s your everyday transport?\n\nA 2015 Isuzu D-Max, which we bought new and has the excellent 2.5-litre, twin-turbo engine. It\u2019s done about 48,000 \nmiles so far, but some days it sits in the yard as I\u2019m glued to the sprayer seat.\n\nWhat\u2019s in the shed?\n\nHarvesters 2007 Claas Lexion 600, 30ft header; 2006 Claas Lexion 570, 25ft header; 1997 Claas Lexion 460, 25ft \nheader; 2017 Ropa Tiger 6 beet harvester\n\nSprayers 2012 Agrifac Condor self-propelled sprayer, 36m; 2016 Agrifac Condor self-propelled sprayer, 36m, full \nRTK\n\nTractors 2015-2017, 11 x Case Puma tractors, 160 \u2013 240hp\n\n\n\nStraw kit 2 x New Holland BB9090t square balers; 1 x New Holland 4x3 baler; 1 x Heath Superchaser extra\n\nCultivation and drilling Lemken 7-furrow plough; Lemken Solitair 8 combination drill 4m; Horsch pronto drill \n4m; Vicon Unicorn 12-row beet drill\n\nBest tractor you\u2019ve owned?\n\nWe don\u2019t strictly own it yet, but the Case Optum we had on demo last year that pulled our Lemken plough about \n2.5kph quicker than our Puma 240, and made us think we need the extra power on some of the heavier land we \nfarm.\n\nWorst tractor?\n\nWhen we started the contracting business, we ran McCormick machines, as they offered a cheap form of power to \nget us established, but one 215hp machine caused us all sorts of issues, with the electric joystick and hydraulic \nsystem being the main culprits.\n\nIt prompted us to switch our shade of red. That said, we liked the smaller McCormick machines.\n\nBiggest machinery bargain?\n\nWe bought a new 6m weed wiper, used it for six years and sold it as part of a trade-in for more than the original \npurchase price. I wish it was like that with tractors \u2013 we\u2019d change them every year.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nNext year\u2019s sugar beet crop will be at greater risk from virus yellows, due to the loss of seed treatment control \nmeasures.\n\nThis follows confirmation that the sale and supply of three neonicotinoid seed treatment active ingredients will \ncease by mid-September, with the use of seed treated with the three actives ending on 19 December.\n\nSee also: How to manage disease in sugar beet crops\n\nFor sugar beet growers, this means that current choices thiamethoxam and clothianidin can no longer be used in \nseed treatments for the 2019 crop, after the EU extended the ban from using them on flowering crops to include all \noutdoor crops.\n\nImidacloprid, another neonicotinoid active ingredient that had previously been used in sugar beet, is also affected \nby the decision.\n\nPeach potato aphid\n\nIn their absence, beet growers are left without any control measures for the most important vector of virus yellows, \nthe peach potato aphid (Myzus persicae), which has developed resistance to several important insecticide groups, \nincluding pyrethroids.\n\nBefore the ban extension was announced, the British Beet Research Organisation (BBRO) was already working on \nalternative strategies for controlling virus-transmitting aphids, as well as other pests controlled by the widely used \nseed treatments \u2013 with that work now taking on greater urgency.\n\n\u201cThe UK sugar beet sector was severely challenged in 1987 by rhizomania,\u201d says Dr Mark Stevens, head of \nscience at BBRO.\n\n\u201cAt the time, there was plenty of doom and gloom, with some predicting the demise of the crop. That didn\u2019t happen.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow we are facing another challenge and we are up for it \u2013 there are potential solutions out there and we need to \nget them fast-tracked.\u201d\n\nThe neonicotinoid seed treatments have been an effective one-stop shop, he acknowledges. \u201cUp until now, growers \nhave been able to control 15 pests with their use and they\u2019ve all got used to that convenience. No wonder 97% of \nthe UK crop was treated.\u201d\n\nFor some pests, their loss won\u2019t be a problem, as there are actives such as tefluthrin which can still be used in seed \ntreatments, he stresses.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the case with soil pests, such as millipedes, symphylids and springtails. Tefluthrin, which is found in Force, \nwill give good control.\u201d\n\nLeaf miner\n\nAnother pest, leaf miner, is less of a problem due to its sporadic nature, although it does seem to be on the \nincrease, Dr Stevens warns.\n\n\u201cHaving said that, 2017 wasn\u2019t a bad year for it, so there was no need for an emergency authorisation for a foliar \napplication of thiacloprid.\u201d\n\nWithout foliar thiacloprid, control options for the pest are limited once the neonicotinoid seed treatments have worn \noff.\n\n\u201cHallmark can be used but it relies primarily on contact action, so once the larvae have penetrated the leaf, it is \ndifficult to control them. It is a pyrethroid, so it\u2019s not great for beneficials.\u201d\n\nVirus yellows\n\nVirus yellows is the biggest challenge and will require the use of integrated approaches, especially as tolerant \nvarieties are not likely to be available for at least another five years, Dr Stevens says.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that there is plenty of plant breeding work being done on developing tolerance, so we are \nhopeful that resistant varieties will be introduced in due course.\u201d\n\nHowever, there\u2019s no single major source of resistance, so that work involves identifying lots of minor genes for the \nthree different viruses, he explains.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s complex, which is why these varieties will take a few years to produce. In the meantime, we will have to monitor \ncrops closely and improve surveillance.\u201d\n\nNew technology will help with this, he believes, as will greater attention to farm hygiene.\n\nTeppeki clearance\n\nOther insecticides are also of interest, with Dr Stevens highlighting the aphicide known as Teppeki (flonicamid), \nwhich is already approved for use in potatoes and cereals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a foliar spray and, if it is cleared for use in sugar beet, we will only be allowed to make one application. So \ntiming will be very important,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt can give useful activity. A label extension to include sugar beet would be helpful.\u201d\n\nManufacturer Belchim confirms that it expects Teppeki\u2019s approval for use in sugar beet imminently, with delays \nlooking unlikely.\n\n\n\nWhat is virus yellows?\n\nVirus yellows is caused by a complex of viral agents, including beet mild yellowing virus, beet yellows virus and \nbeet chlorosis virus.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1995, losses to virus yellows were estimated at \u00a35.5m a year when older (pre-neonicotinoid) \ntreatments were applied, rising to more than \u00a310m in the absence of control measures.\n\nUnchecked, yield losses from virus yellows are estimated to be in the region of 20-25%, with the UK\u2019s maritime \nclimate proving to be ideal for the aphids, which transmit the virus by feeding on the plants. Losses are greatest in \nyears when aphids colonise beet plants early in the spring and multiply rapidly.\n\nUntil now, widespread use of neonicotinoid seed treatments has provided excellent control of aphids during the \nearly stages of crop growth, protecting the crop against virus yellows and its associated yield loss.\n\nIn 2017, BBRO aphid monitoring saw the first peach potato aphids being caught in May, while the first virus yellows \ninfected plants were found at its demonstration site at Rougham, Suffolk on 16 June.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nBrothers Rich and Chris Norman will make history this summer by being the first autumn block grazed herd to host \nthe Gold Cup Open Day on Thursday 14 June. \n\nDuring the day, the winners of the coveted trophy will reveal the secrets behind their success through a series of \ntalks from some of the people who inspired the achievements that saw them winning the 2017 Gold Cup. \n\nThroughout the day, attendees will get an insight into the running of the 580-head cross-bred herd and its other \nenterprises, including the 200,000 broiler unit and anaerobic digester, where managers will be on-hand to answer \nquestions.\n\nSee also: Cross-bred dairy herd wins Gold Cup\n\nProgramme of speakers\n\nFuture market predictions, presented by dairy market analyst Chris Walkland\n\nSuccession planning and the role of governance,presented by Tony Evans of the Andersons Centre \n\nFactors driving business and team performance and success, presented by LIC and Real Success\n\nThe benefits of linking your farm to the environment, presented by the Wye and Usk Foundation\n\nRich Norman said he hopes they are able to demonstrate how success is possible for all herd types and he hopes \nthe day will attract visitors from far and wide, from the whole range of dairy systems.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe are thrilled to be in this position and look forward to sharing some of our practices with visitors \nthrough specialist speakers who are integral to our business and its success. \n\n\u201cAbove all, we hope we are able to provide some key take-home points that people can apply to their own \nbusinesses.

It needed to have good ventilation \nand to hold up to 200 cattle of different age groups.\n\nWe chose two identical single-span sheds and constructed these opposite each other so in fact it looks like one \nshed with a 2.4m gap between the overhangs.\n\nThe environment is very airy and the layout lends itself well to handling different groups.\n\nWhat are the shed\u2019s dimensions?\n\nEach half is 36m long and 12m wide, with a ridge height of 6.36m and 3.65m to the eaves. The central passageway \nis 7.3m wide.\n\nAt capacity, we can house 180-200 cattle, including calves and followers.\n\nWhat is the building made of?\n\nThe frame is galvanised steel and the roof is fibre cement sheeting with clear plastic corrugated skylights.\n\nThe walls are a combination of Yorkshire boarding and concrete panelling. The bedded areas have compacted \nstone floors.\n\nHow is the shed laid out?\n\nEach side has six bays and the straw-bedded areas can be shut off from the feed passageway, which means we \ncan hold the cattle in those pens when we scrape.\n\nHow much did the whole thing cost?\n\n\n\nThe shed itself was \u00a387,695 excluding VAT. The internal fittings such as gates and other metal work cost \u00a315,840 \nand we paid \u00a322,213 to have those fitted.\n\nAs it was a greenfield site we needed to get three-phase electricity from a point 200m away, so that cost us another \n\u00a328,000.\n\nThe planning fee was \u00a35,390. We created a track from the farmhouse down to the shed using our own limestone \nand that worked out at about \u00a325,000.\n\nWe had an existing steel portal frame building at the old farmyard and spent another \u00a318,690 relocating that.\n\nWho was your supplier?\n\nThe shed was supplied by SA Mogg at Astwood Bank, Redditch, and constructed by Dudfield Farm Buildings at \nStow-on-the-Wold.\n\nThe gating and barriers were from IAE, but supplied by Stow Ag. It took two months to complete. This has been our \nsecond winter using it.\n\nHas it been a good investment?\n\nIt seems a lot of money for an 80-cow suckler herd, but we had the funds from the housing development and we \nwanted to continue with the beef enterprise.\n\nIf we hadn't had the income from the development, we would not have been able to do it.\n\nDad does the mucking out. It takes him an hour a day to scrape and to run a straw chopper down each side.\n\nIt had been taking two men three hours to bed and feed 80 sucklers because the old housing set-up was a rabbit \nwarren of buildings. We are now using about 750kg of straw a day.\n\nThe herd is mostly housed from September and out again by the end of March, but we have had to delay turnout \nthis spring because it has been so wet and grass growth has been slow.\n\nWe muck out the bedding every six to eight weeks. The shed is laid out in a way that we can shut the cattle into the \nconcrete passage while we do this.\n\nHow has it improved cattle health?\n\nIn our old buildings pneumonia and scours had been a big problem, but I\u2019m happy to say we haven\u2019t had a case for \ntwo winters.\n\nWe vaccinate for pneumonia. The cows get a rotavirus corona jab too and they pass that benefit on to their calves.\n\nWhat is your favourite feature?\n\nThere are removable metal bars in the barriers of one of the pens which acts as a creep feeding passageway for \ncalves.\n\nThey stay with their mothers, but they can come and go from a separate pen to get extra feed.\n\nWhen we don't have calves in that pen we use it to house our stock bulls.\n\nWhat would you change?\n\nThe water troughs are positioned behind the feed barriers and we find that the cattle have a tendency to muck in \nthem.\n\n\n\nI didn\u2019t want them on the back wall because I thought we would get more dirty bedding.\n\nAlso, if there had been a leak, the water would have soaked onto the bedding.\n\nWe have a temporary handling system, but ideally we would have a permanent area where we could isolate the \ncattle to PD and foot-trim them.\n\nHave you made any changes since the shed was built?\n\nWe have fitted hardboard under the doors to stop badgers getting in. We had been TB-free for 10 years, but \ncurrently have a herd breakdown.\n\nThere are also bits that we need to finish. For instance, we created a manure store from some materials we had at \nthe old site and will put a roof on that this year.\n\n \n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var \ni=\"InfogramEmbeds\",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?\"http:\":\"https:\";if(/^\\/{2}/.test(s)&&(\ns=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var \na=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,\"script\",\"infogram-\nasync\",\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\");\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nOur latest What\u2019s in your Shed? heads to Cheshire to visit mixed farmer Graham Lowe.\n\nThe families\u2019 workload load includes a herd of beef cattle along with arable cropping and baling, as well as a farm \nshop and equine business.\n\nWe find out why he is so loyal to the New Holland brand and still runs a brace of older TM models on the frontline\n\nHow did you get started?\n\nMy dad moved here in 1958 when the farm was just 12ha.\n\nHe opened a simple farm shop a couple of years later and we have gradually built up the business from there.\n\nNow we are farming a total of about 200ha, roughly half of which is rented, and we grow 40 types of vegetable to \nsell through the shop.\n\nThe shop itself was rebuilt and extended in 2015 and we are planning to add a caf\u00e9 next.\n\nSee also: What's in Your Shed? visits an Irish grassland contractor\n\nHow brand loyal are you?\n\nWe have been very brand loyal over the years, as we have two superb local dealers that we like to work with.

We\u2019ve only had \nto replace one set of blades in that time and it still looks as good as new.\n\nLeast favourite?\n\nWe had a Bomford Falcon Evo hedgecutter that we just couldn\u2019t get on with. It was a high-spec machine with \nvariable forward reach, but we found it very hard to control and almost impossible to keep the top of the hedge flat. \nWe replaced it with a simpler Kuhn Pro-longer that we\u2019ve been really happy with.\n\nIn the shed\n\nTractors: New Holland T7.235, T7.200, T6.180x 2, TM155, TM140 and 8260, Ford 3910, 4610 and 3600, Valtra \nA73\n\nBalers: New Holland Combi 125 round baler/wrapper, BB950 big square baler and BC5070 conventional baler, \nKuhn Intelliwrap bale wrapper, McHale mini bale wrapper\n\nGrass kit: Kuhn front and rear mower, Krone six-rotor tedder, Kuhn twin-rotor rake\n\nCultivation kit: Kverneland EG85 five-furrow vari-width plough, Heva 3m Combilift, Amazone 3m power harrow, \nStanden 3m rotavator, Dalbo 6.3m Cambridge rolls\n\nDrill: Kuhn Integra 3m combi drill\n\nTrailers: Richard Western SF11 and  SF12 silage trailers, Weeks 8t and 10t grain trailers, West 8t and 10t grain \ntrailers, AW cattle trailer, 21ft Marshall bale trailer x 2, 25ft Predator bale trailer\n\nTelehandler: JCB 526S\n\nVeg kit: Grimme DL15 and row over potato harvesters, Standen bedformer and destoner, Reekie potato planter, \nassorted small-scale veg equipment\n\nOther: Kuhn Primor straw chopper, Bunning Lowlander 90 muck spreader, JCB 3CX excavator\n\nWhat\u2019s your latest purchase?\n\nWe have just taken delivery of an ex-demonstrator New Holland T6.180 that\u2019s on about 200 hours.\n\nIt\u2019s the newer shape machine and is so much more comfortable than the T6.175 we had before. We have only done \na few hours in it, but so far it looks like a good purchase.\n\n\n\nBest tractor you\u2019ve had?\n\nWe used to have a K-reg Ford 7840 with retrofit turbo that was fantastic. We had it for 10 years and it easily coped \nwith our Reco Mengele SH40 forager, which was fairly power hungry.\n\nThe tractor was supposedly running at 125hp, but we think it was putting out a fair bit more than that.\n\nThe only spare part it had other than oil and filters was the fan belt. It got traded in for a TM135 when it was on \n7,840 hours, but I wish we had kept it, really.\n\nOur current T7.235 Power Command comes a close second. It has more than enough power for what we need and \nit\u2019s very smooth.\n\nWorst tractor you\u2019ve had?\n\nThe worst was a New Holland T5 with a loader. The tractor itself wasn\u2019t too bad, but the mounting brackets for the \nloader were too far forward, meaning it was incredibly front heavy.\n\nAfter 12 months we got fed up with how light it was at the rear end and moved it on. Shortly after that I think New \nHolland changed the brackets on them, so later or modified models might have been fine.\n\nHow long do you keep your machines?\n\nWe tend to keep our frontline tractors for three years and, because we only do about 500 hours a year, they\u2019re still \nunder warranty when we come to sell them.\n\nTo make sure we get the best trade-in prices, we look after them as best we can and they get treated to a full valet \nevery season. It only costs \u00a335 a tractor and it gets them looking like new.\n\nOur older New Holland tractors get the same treatment, but we have no plans to change these.\n\nThe rest of our kit is changed when it\u2019s worn out or we fancy a change. We are fastidious about looking after it all \nand everything gets stored under cover.\n\nBiggest machinery bargain?\n\nOur best buy has to be our New Holland 125 Combi baler. It was a demonstrator model that had done 700 bales \nand we were offered it for \u00a320,000 less than the new price.\n\nIt\u2019s very easy to use and so much quicker than running a separate baler and wrapper. We also like the fact that it \ndrops the wrapped bale on to a mat, reducing the chance of wrap getting punctured.\n\nA lot of our haylage is sold to horse owners, so it\u2019s important we keep the quality high. For that reason we also put \neight layers of wrap on each bale. Speed is pretty decent too, with it comfortably popping out 40 bales an hour.\n\nOldest machine still at work?\n\nWe are still using an old 1950s Robot potato planter that my dad bought. It\u2019s very simple with a land wheel and \nchain to turn the planting cups, but it does everything we need.\n\nWhat\u2019s next on your wish list?\n\nWe\u2019re looking to get an 80x70 square baler. At the moment we\u2019re doing round, conventional square and 120x70s, \nbut we think there is good demand for that interim size.\n\nThey are also good for the equine market as they\u2019re just about small enough to handle manually. All our current \nbalers are New Hollands, and this one probably will be too.\n\n\n\nBiggest machinery mistake?\n\nI was cutting a neighbour\u2019s hedges, which I\u2019d done for years, when I ran over the valve on a new underground gas \ntank they\u2019d had installed.\n\nIt caused the tank to leak and the emergency services shut the road for 24 hours while it was sorted. My insurance \ncompany also had to provide a new tank.\n\nBiggest repair bill?\n\nWe were landed with a \u00a36,000 bill on our New Holland BB950 baler when one of the needles pushed something \ntough (we\u2019re not sure what) into the knotter and smashed it. Malpas Tractors did the repairs for us and thankfully \nour insurance covered the fee.\n\nBest invention?\n\nIt\u2019s very simple, but we made an inter-row side-hoe weeder out of an old ridger. It works well, cost us nothing and \nwas quick to put together.\n\nWhat\u2019s your everyday transport?\n\nI have one of the last twin-cab Land Rover Defender pickups. I used to buy them with discount vouchers from the \nNFU and change them every three years, but obviously that has had to stop now.\n\nI sold the last one to the tuning house Kahn Design, which was planning to bling it up, and it only cost me \u00a33,000 to \nchange. This latest model is on 16,000 miles so far and I\u2019ll be hanging on to it.\n\nDo you have any classics?\n\nI have quite a few that I\u2019ve picked up over the years, most of which are Fords and David Browns. A few of them still \nget used on our vegetable ground, but most are stored. They are all run up at least once a year though.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe level of interest in the UK\u2019s largest farms and estates is closely linked to their diversity and potential for buyers \nto add value.\n\nAgents report bidders at the top of the market have become increasingly discerning and \u2013 despite not being awash \nwith options \u2013 are willing to wait for the right opportunity.\n\nA limited number of rollover buyers and expanding farmers are looking for large blocks to drive economies of scale \nwithin their enterprises.\n\nSee also: 7 of the biggest farms in the world\n\nBut cash from investors and institutions is being directed towards sales with non-agricultural income streams and \nlong-term strategic development appeal.  \n\nSome significant farms have been launched across the UK during the past 12 months, with potential investors \noffered farms ranging from 1,200 to 3,200 acres.\n\n \n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var \ni=\"InfogramEmbeds\",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?\"http:\":\"https:\";if(/^\\/{2}/.test(s)&&(\ns=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var \n\n\n\na=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,\"script\",\"infogram-\nasync\",\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\");\n\nGuide prices topped \u00a331.5m with the launch of the 2,177-acre Sutton Hall Estate, as reported in Farmers Weekly \nlast month.\n\nGood amount of interest\n\nOne-third of those advertised in the past year have completed, with negotiations continuing on the rest.\n\nCarter Jonas completed the sale of the \u00a313.5m Shackerstone Estate earlier this year, achieving the guide price.\n\nFirm associate Ben Ainscough, who sold the 1,738-acre portfolio on behalf of the Crown Estate, said there was a \ngood number of enquiries, but the estate\u2019s let farms didn\u2019t suit everyone.\n\n\u201cWe had a number of people contact us after it went under offer to say they are interested in something similar \nshould it become available,\u201d Mr Ainscough said.\n\n\u201cThe AHAs in place had further successions to run, so perhaps if there was the prospect of getting those farms \nback in-hand to improve or develop then there would have been more bidders.\n\n\u201cBuyers are happy to spend the money on quality, but if there is strategic investment appeal then that heightens \ninterest. Buyers are discerning and are holding off for the right thing.\u201d\n\nWhat do buyers want? \n\nFisher German associate Richard Gadd said there is greater demand for large estates with diversified income \nstreams because it softens the risk profile in comparison to a bare agricultural unit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen examples of institutions re-evaluating their risk profiles and considering looking at other investments \naway from agriculture,\u201d he added.\n\nMr Gadd said a balanced estate of 1,000-1,500 acres of Grade 2 or Grade 3 arable land, with a modest house and \nan established non-agricultural income stream would be the perfect fit for today\u2019s market.\n\n\u201cThe reason we don\u2019t have anything like this to offer is because if you own an estate like this, you wouldn\u2019t want to \nsell it,\u201d he said. \n\nCash is king\n\nSavills director Charlie Paton said most interest in scale was coming from cash buyers from the UK.\n\n\u201cThere are glimmers of overseas buyers, but the money is mainly UK based,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cThere are a few large estates on the market at the moment and the buyers are there providing it is priced sensibly \nand it\u2019s in the right location for them.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nMost spring calving dairy farmers would grimace at the thought of buying a feeder wagon.\n\nHowever, some are spring systems are doing just that in an attempt to extend grazing rotations and support milk \nproduction.\n\nA high stocking rate is another reason why some pasture-based herds are supplementing grass with total mixed \nration (TMR), while others are favouring feeding TMR to balance the variability in the dry matter, protein and \navailability of grass.\n\n\nSee also: Award-winning dairy farmer shares grassland management strategy\n\nIn County Cork, dairy farm Kevin O\u2019Neill has invested 40,000 (\u00a334,800) in a Keenan tub feeder wagon to allow him \nto feed TMR to extend the grazing window on his 32ha platform.\n\nHe milks 140 spring calving cows on a pasture-based system at Ahakeera, Dunmanway. Half the farm has free-\ndraining red sandstone land, but the remainder is reclaimed marsh which can be difficult to graze.\n\n\u201cWe can grow grass but we cannot get at all the paddocks,\u201d says Mr O\u2019Neill.\n\nWhen conditions are wet in the autumn and spring, the number of paddocks cows can graze is limited and that\u2019s \nwhere buffer feeding comes in.\n\nFeeding\n\nHe aims to turn cows out to grass on 1 February and doesn\u2019t house them until 1 December or later if conditions are \nfavourable.\n\nOn the shoulders of the season, when grass growth is low, cows receive a ration of 30kg freshweight a head made \nup of grass silage, straw, soya bean, maize meal, barley and sugar beet.\n\nThis reduces to 8-10kg as grass growth increases and then once housed this mix is upped to 60kg a cow. Cows are \nbuffer-fed in feed bunkers in the yard before the afternoon milking.\n\n\u201cWe fetch them in 10 minutes early, it helps speed up the process of getting them in from the field but it can make \nthem a bit lazy going into the parlour,\u201d says Mr O\u2019Neill, who farms 81ha.\n\n\u201cWe feed until the grass is plentiful, usually around mid-May, and introduce a buffer again at the end of September \nor beginning of October,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I think grass is tapering off in September or October I start using buffer feeding but I don\u2019t want to open \nthe pit silage so I use bales instead,\u201d he explains.\n\nCows receive 2-3kg of concentrates in the parlour in the autumn and 1kg in the spring.\n\nMilk production benefits\n\nThe herd produces an average daily milk yield of 31 litres which earns Mr O\u2019Neill 44 cents/litre (35p) from his milk \nbuyer, Dairygold.\n\n\u201cMilk solids come at a price, I wouldn\u2019t use TMR if it wasn\u2019t returning a premium for me, although other spring \ncalvers think I am an idiot for having a feeder wagon.\u201d\n\nIn a poor spring, buffer feeding has been very beneficial, he points out.\n\n\u201cDuring a cold spring like the one we have just had, those farmers might only have their cows at grass for three \nhours then they had to bring them back inside to feed.\n\n\u201cI know of grazing farmers who would have been feeding about 10kg of meal at that time whereas I only fed 7kg \nbecause the cows were getting a buffer feed.\u201d\n\nHis cows are larger than the more typical spring-calving animal \u2013 he milks pedigree Holstein Friesians, but these \nare moderate in stature and width.\n\nPre-mow grazing\n\n\nFarm facts\n\n110 spring-calving cows and 30 autumn calvers\n\n81ha owned\n\nMilk protein 3.49% and butterfat 4.47%\n\n12-unit herringbone parlour\n\n 60-70 bulling heifers with 120 calves reared annually\n\nOnly dairy semen/dairy stock bulls used for breeding replacements and to produce pedigree Ahakeera bulls\n\nHe has three-day paddocks, allocating grazing with an electric fence.\n\nTo maintain grass quality, he always mows pre-grazing.\n\n\u201cI never have to top a field, I get short, leafy grass, not long and stemmy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get any waste; the fields are like a golf course when the cows have left them.\u201d\n\nMr O\u2019Neill doesn\u2019t measure grass with a plate meter.\n\n\u201cI would rather be looking at it than looking for it. I mow grass every day so I know if the covers are getting too \nheavy and when they are I cut them for silage.\u201d\n\nHe applies 30-35kg/ha of nitrogen to paddocks after every grazing. \u201cWhen the grass is growing I fertilise as heavily \nat the nitrate regulations allow and cut what I don\u2019t need for grazing for silage.\u201d\n\nMr O\u2019Neill takes three cuts of silage \u2013 both clamp and big bales \u2013 with the first cut mostly in mid-May.\n\nFertility and health benefits\n\nHe believes buffer feeding underpins the health status of his herd.\n\n\u201cDuring this spring\u2019s calving we only had one case of retained cleansings and no displaced abomasums.\n\n\u201cIn an extreme spring grazing situation, the cows go out to grass and they are empty, their stomachs will move.\n\n\u201cIf I think my cows are loose I can add straw to the ration or a little bit of soya to help with digestion so that they are \nchewing their cud.\u201d \n\nA balanced diet has also resulted in very few cases of lameness. \u201cWe never have to cull for lameness even though \nthey have to walk up to a mile to and from the parlour,\u201d Mr O\u2019Neill reports.\n\nAnd he says fertility is good too \u2013 his submission rate in the first three weeks of breeding is 45%. \u201cWe have very few \nempty cows,\u201d he says.\n\nHe has a strict culling policy \u2013 removing between 10-15 animals from the herd every year, mostly due to poor udder \nstructure and if they have experienced more than two cases of mastitis.\n\nMr O\u2019Neill regards the wagon as a cost neutral investment. \u201cWhatever it is costing me it is certainly returning.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nCover cropping has earned its place in the arable rotation at Freefolk Farms in Hampshire, with stubble turnips \nbeing used ahead of spring cropping, bringing many benefits on the thin chalk soils.\n\n\n\nNot only does the 50ha provide grazing for the farm\u2019s sheep enterprise and help to fatten lambs, growing stubble \nturnips also helps the farm to meet some of the obligations of its Higher Tier Countryside Stewardship scheme.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve grown them for years,\u201d points out Hugh Crosbie-Dawson, who manages the AHDB\u2019s Basingstoke Monitor \nFarm site.\n\n \u201cAnd there\u2019s always a notable difference with establishing the following spring barley crop where the sheep have \nbeen.\u201d\n\nSee also: Cover crops benefit Lincolnshire blackgrass battle\n\nIn the right conditions, grazing the turnips allows him to direct drill afterwards, saving time and reducing fuel use.\n\n\u201cIf the sheep have grazed them, we can get the same spring barley establishment from drilling directly into the \nstubble as we can from using a cultivator,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThis year, the direct operation was twice as quick and saved us around 50 litres/ha of diesel.\u201d\n\nDifferent mixes\n\nAs part of the Monitor Farm programme, he agreed to try some different cover crop options last autumn, with six \ndifferent mixes being selected and drilled in a field that had previously produced disappointing spring barley yields \n(see table).\n\nFarm facts \u2013 Freefolk Farms\n\n1,161ha\n\n800ha arable \u2013 milling wheat, spring barley, winter oilseed rape and peas\n\n250ha grassland\n\n150 Holstein dairy cows\n\n500 breeding ewes\n\nCommercial lets, self-storage containers\n\nSolar farm\n\n\u201cSoil analysis hadn\u2019t given us any clues to the yield issue, so we were interested to see if different cover crops could \nhelp with soil structure and nutrient recycling on these thin, chalk soils, and whether that would result in a yield lift,\u201d \nhe explains.\n\nDrilling took place on 26 August 2017 with the farm\u2019s Horsch Sprinter drill, and all of the mixes were rolled \nafterwards, with 30kg/ha of nitrogen being applied to each 0.5ha strip.\n\n\u201cThey established well,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThey were all grazed off with the sheep over the winter and we drilled the \nfollowing crop of Propino spring barley in the first week of April.\u201d\n\nSome of the spring barley land was cultivated before drilling, with the remainder being direct drilled. \u201cIt was very \nwet, so my hand was forced. The headlands had to be re-drilled two weeks later, as they didn\u2019t establish well.\u201d\n\nThat spring barley crop is now being closely monitored so that it can be compared with the rest of the field, which \ndidn\u2019t have the preceding cover crop mixes.\n\nNutrient benefit?\n\n\n\nOf particular interest is whether there is a nutrient benefit in the following crop, or if the effects are longer term, and \nif greater diversity in the mixes adds some resilience and helps to suppress weeds.\n\n\u201cWe have been pulling some of the stubble turnips up to help with blackgrass control, so these mixes might have a \nrole with that.\u201d\n\nThe eventual outcome and findings will be shared at his future Monitor Farm meetings, which start again in October \n2018.\n\nHowever, the later-than-normal drilling date means that fertiliser use has already been reduced by 15%, with the \nbarley receiving 120kg/ha of nitrogen rather than its usual 150kg/ha.\n\nIt has also had a cheaper herbicide programme, with Foxtrot (fenoxapro) being applied for wild oat control rather \nthan Axial (pinoxaden) plus adjuvant Adigor, while the cost of the T2 fungicide spray has been halved.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken advantage of the cold, slow start to the season by reducing our variable costs,\u201d says Mr Crosbie-\nDawson. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t just been the case for spring barley: we\u2019ve been able to do that in our winter wheat as well.\u201d\n\nIn winter wheat, he has spent \u00a330/ha less on agrochemicals, having not used a T0 spray and saved \u00a320/ha on \npost-emergence grassweed control.\n\nCover crop mixes on test at Freefolk Farms\n\n \n\nName\n\nSpecies Mix\n\nCost (\u00a3/ha)\n\nComments\n\n1\n\nSimple EFA\n\n80% oat\n\n20% mustard\n\n17\n\nCheap\n\nModest benefit mix\n\n2\n\nComplex EFA\n\n56% rye\n\n20% radish\n\n4% phacelia\n\n20% vetch\n\n\n\n40\n\nDeep rooting\n\nSoil fertility\n\n3\n\nShort catch non-EFA\n\n15% black oat\n\n20% linseed\n\n20% buckwheat\n\n10% mustard\n\n15% radish\n\n20% peas\n\n32\n\nQuick growing mix\n\nUse after rape, before wheat\n\n4\n\nLong Cover\n\n35% rye\n\n5% phacelia\n\n25% vetch\n\n15% turnip rape\n\n20% barracuda radish\n\n45\n\nLong mix\n\nUse right through and in front of maize etc\n\n5\n\nGrazing\n\n70% winter oat\n\n15% turnip rape\n\n15% stubble turnips\n\n25\n\n\n\nFor grazing\n\nCould be switched into black oats/vetch\n\n6\n\nMulti-mix\n\n20% winter oats\n\n20% rye\n\n15% radish\n\n5% phacelia\n\n10% buckwheat\n\n5% crimson clover\n\n5% berseem clover\n\n10% linseed\n\n10% sunflowers\n\n35\n\nSoil health enhancement and good rooting depths\n\nWheatsheaf Farming Company, Hampshire\n\nCover crops have been an integral part of David Miller\u2019s arable farming system since 2010.\n\nAll of his spring cropped land has had cover crops for the past five years \u2013 with Wheatsheaf Farming Company also \nmaking the move to no-till in that time and putting the emphasis on soil health.\n\n\u201cThey are a continuation of our system as we are not moving the soil, so the rooting effect is important for building \nsoil biology,\u201d explains Mr Miller.\n\n\u201cAs a result of their contribution, we are making a lot of savings now.\u201d\n\nThose savings include nitrogen, which he has been able to reduce by 10%, as well as potash, which hasn\u2019t been \napplied for the past four years. Instead, di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) is used in the autumn, thanks to a \nderogation from the Environment Agency for use in a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ), with a DAP/urea mix used in \nthe spring.\n\nHis diesel use has fallen by 30%, dropping from 85 litres/ha to 60 litres/ha. Slugs were a problem initially, but he \nnow uses ferric phosphate-based slug pellets at drilling and continues to straw rake everything.\n\n\u201cAs the system settles and soil health improves, you get more natural predators,\u201d he comments.\n\nMr Miller has reduced his cover crop seed costs to \u00a320/ha, by buying straights. Where he is growing an early cover \ncrop, he uses a mix of berseem clover, vetch, lupins, phacelia and buckwheat, while his later sown mix is based on \nspring beans and vetch.\n\n\n\nHe also follows some basic cover crop rules \u2013 with no brassicas being used in the mixes to prevent issues with the \nfarm\u2019s oilseed rape and no cereals included where spring barley is to follow, so that disease and pest carryover is \nminimised.\n\nPT Hosier and Son, Wiltshire\n\nGeorge Hosier, who operates a mixed farming system in Wiltshire, has introduced 200ha of cover crops based on a \nmultispecies mix costing \u00a330/ha.\n\nWith a beef suckler herd and sheep, he plans to graze all of his cover crops, as he finds that the following crop \nestablishment is better behind grazing.\n\n\u201cIt also has the benefit of spreading the cost between two enterprises,\u201d he points out. \u201cThe cattle tend to be used on \nthe crops on lighter land.\u201d\n\nHis objective with cover crops is to build up soil biology and increase organic matter, with a range of rooting depths \nbeing exploited. Another no-till enthusiast, Mr Hosier operates a very diverse and flexible rotation, with oilseed rape \nbeing grown only once every 10 years.\n\n\u201cThat way, it\u2019s fine to have brassicas in our cover crop mixes. The same applied to peas and beans, which are also \ngrown 10 years apart.\u201d\n\nHe has also seen significant savings, with nitrogen fertiliser use falling by 10-15% on his wheat and even more on \nspring barley. No bagged P and K has been applied for the last two years, while seed treatment and insecticide use \nhas also been eliminated.\n\nWith a Cross Slot drill, he is able to drill most of his spring barley into the cover crops, which are then terminated \nafter the drilling operation.\n\n\u201cThe roots of the cover crop are so important, especially in a wet year,\u201d he says.\n\nHe has found that having a legume in a cover crop mix means that the life of the nitrogen in the soil is very short. \nWith other species, the nitrogen benefit is still there a year later.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFailing to create official contracts for family members that detail the terms and conditions of employment could lead \nto legal problems, succession planning issues, and even the break-up of families, a legal expert has warned.\n\nAlthough there has often been relaxed agreement among family members, with discretionary payments the norm \nuntil a partnership agreement is put in place, this approach could land employers in hot water, says Lindsey \nKnowles, employment solicitor and partner at Kirwans law firm.\n\nShe is warning parents that when it comes to employing family \u2013 even children who they are planning to bring in as \npartner  \u2013 they have to assume the role of employer.\n\nSee also: Business Clinic: How can I recruit good farm staff?\n\nThe fine

helping on the farm as part of their family chores don\u2019t need \nto worry about contracts or the minimum wage for as long as that situation remains in place.\n\nThe difficulty comes when the arrangement veers from a straightforward set-up.\n\nFor example, if the adult child has moved out of home yet is still working on the farm, or if the farm has evolved into \na limited company status, then an employment contract has to be drawn up.\n\nMs Knowles recommends having a solicitor either create, or at the very least look over, new contracts to ensure \nthat any newly employed family member is treated in exactly the same way as other non-family employees, as there \ncould be trouble ahead for those who fail to do so.\n\nEach employee, including family members, has to be hired to

on the horizon, experts are \nadvising wheat growers to adopt a more water-tight, integrated approach to minimising the problems in future \nseasons.\n\nFera started recording incidence of Fusarium ear blight symptoms in 1991 and since that point, there have been \nthree seasons of severe infection: in 1998, 2007 and 2012 (see graph 1).\n\nWhile there have been fluctuations after each disease explosion, levels have never returned to pre-epidemic \nheights and each has represented a step change in risk to the yield and quality of UK wheat crops.\n\n\n\nSee also: Angled sprayer nozzles give best wheat ear disease control\n\nOf the Fusarium species, F culmorum has historically dominated UK populations, but over the past dozen years, F \ngraminearum has come to the fore (see graph 2) and, worryingly, it is the most significant mycotoxin producer.\n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var

unlike F culmorum which is spread locally by rain splash, F graminearum completes its sexual phase on \ncrop debris and produces air-borne spores capable of travelling greater distances.\n\nRisk factors\n\nThe rising occurrence of ear disease and the shift to a more dominant mycotoxin-producing F graminearum began \nin the South-West and moved across the south coast and up the eastern seaboard to the East Midlands, around the \nWash.\n\nAccording to Harper Adams University expert Simon Edwards, a combination of factors is at play, with increasing \nmaize production and a slight rise in temperatures favouring its proliferation.\n\nIn hotspots such as the East Midlands, although maize is now grown more widely, an increase in reduced or zero \ntillage establishment methods in an intensive cereal-growing area is also contributing.\n\nThe combination seems to be creating a perfect storm, which, given the right conditions for F graminearum \u2013 wet \nand warm at anthesis \u2013 could result in levels of disease, mycotoxin infection and unsaleable grain not seen before.\n\nThe mycotoxins produced by F culmorum and F graminearum include deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol (NIV). \nBoth produce zearalenone (ZON) later in a delayed harvest.\n\nLooking ahead, Prof Edwards says it was recently confirmed at the European Commission\u2019s Mycotoxin Forum that \nthe permitted threshold in grains for human consumption looks set to change.\n\nSo, with increased fusarium risk and potentially less wriggle room on mycotoxin limits in the future, what should \ngrowers consider for countering the threat?\n\nFera expert Phil Jennings says three key factors influence the occurrence of fusarium and subsequent mycotoxins, \nincluding the region where a farm is located, the season and agronomic practices.\n\nTillage choices\n\nThe first two factors growers can do little about, but agronomic practices can be tweaked to minimise risk, such as \nnot overloading rotations with maize and re-evaluating tillage practices.\n\n\nWhile reduced or no-till is now considered a key component in improving soil health, there may be a trade-off in \nexposing crops to increased F graminearum risk \u2013 something seen in North America where it is a devastating \nproblem for wheat in no-till maize rotations.\n\nWith spore-producing perithecia resting on infected crop debris, release of wind-borne ascopores readily infect \nsurrounding wheat crops, so burying residue can help reduce inoculum build up.\n\n\u201cGrowers should also be looking to apply appropriate fungicides at the right time during flowering,\u201d Dr Jennings \nsays.\n\nHarvest management\n\nProf Edwards says another area that can be reviewed is harvest management, with any delays in getting wheat \ncrops cut risking the build-up of DON and ZON, not to mention the loss of quality characteristics such as Hagberg \nfalling numbers and specific weight.\n\nHe urges growers to look at combine capacity, with larger and more efficient machines capable of taking advantage \nof any small windows during a catchy harvest helping to minimise mycotoxin development.\n\n\u201cAlso make sure the combine is well maintained and you have a good access to parts and service to minimise any \ndowntime,\u201d he says.\n\nAlong with reliable, high-output combining, boosting grain storage and drying capacity will also aid growers in the \nquest to minimise mycotoxin levels and rejected grain.\n\n\u201cPlan to cut a proportion of the crop even if a few percent need to be knocked off the moisture content with the \ndryer, and prioritise milling wheats. It is a huge gamble leaving it out in the field,\u201d adds Prof Edwards.\n\nFuture innovation to help battle fusarium and mycotoxins\n\n1. One-stop decision support stop\n\nThe Europe-wide MyToolbox project is aiming to provide growers with a one-stop shop for decision making and \nadvice to reduce mycotoxin levels in cereal crops.\n\nHarper Adams University\u2019s Simon Edwards has been involved in the project, which has been evaluating models \nused in several European countries, where farmers enter local data and are provided with a mycotoxin risk \nassessment.\n\nThis can then be used to influence decisions pre- and post-harvest, such as fungicide inputs, harvest scheduling \nand storage.\n\nCurrently, an Italian model is being tested with Dutch data and vice versa to establish accuracy in differing \nconditions. Data from the UK will also be fed into the two models to establish suitability.\n\nIt is hoped that an online tool will be launched in 2020 across Europe, which will include wide ranging information \non the control of fusarium ear blight and mycotoxins.\n\n2. Spore trapping for accurate fusarium control\n\nScientists at Rothamsted Research are investigating the use of automated spore traps to enable more targeted and \naccurate fungicide applications, working with industry partners on Innovate UK and AHDB-funded projects\n\nProduced by Rickmansworth-based Burkard Manufacturing Co, the spore traps process about 300 litres of air each \nminute. They can then identify which pathogens are in the \u201csoup\u201d and sends a text message to a website, allowing \nthe farmer or agronomist to be alerted to the disease threat.\n\n\n\nWhile much of the work so far has focused on potato blight, sugar beet diseases and other cereal and oilseed rape \nthreats, Rothamsted\u2019s Jon West says it could also be useful in quantifying fusarium risk as wheat crops reach \nflowering.\n\nSome initial investigations have been carried out in conjunction with AHDB and ADAS, but only at the low fusarium \nrisk site at Rothamsted, so Prof West would like more funding to broaden his research into hotspots such as the \nSouth West and around the Wash.\n\n\u201cThis is a new type of precision agriculture. It\u2019s not only about knowing which fungicide to use, but also when to \napply it and only when it\u2019s absolutely necessary,\u201d he explains.\n\n3. Better varietal resistance in the pipeline\n\nIt is widely accepted that wheat varieties in the UK are more susceptible to ear blight than those in other parts of the \nworld, but that may be about to change as researchers seek novel sources of resistance.\n\nUK breeders haven\u2019t needed to focus on Fusarium resistance, as it hasn\u2019t been a problem until the recent hike in \nmaize area and F graminearum becoming the dominant species.\n\nIn response to a growing concern, Paul Nicholson at the John Innes Centre in Norwich is leading a project which \naims to address the weakness of UK wheats by introducing resistant traits.\n\nHe says there are three options for doing so, with the first bringing in genetic markers for \u201cexotic\u201d resistance traits \nfrom China, something that has been done with some success in North American breeding programmes.\n\nThe second aspect of the research is looking at wild relatives that can be crossed into elite wheats in the hope that \nthe progeny will inherit an ability to resist Fusarium.\n\nThe third is investigating the possibility of knocking out \u201csusceptibility factors\u201d. It is thought that Fusarium fungi \ndisrupt the plant\u2019s signalling pathways for growth and defence, so it can infect without any resistance.\n\nIf the \u201csusceptibility\u201d gene can be removed or disabled without interfering with other valuable traits, it could produce \nmuch more robust wheats.\n\n\u201cWe hope to see a dramatic improvement in varietal resistance within 10 years,\u201d adds Dr Nicholson.\n\nIn addition, he points out that AHDB is revising the way it scores resistance to ear blight in Recommended List \ntrials, which will help better tease out subtle differences between current varieties.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nGrowers are being urged to highlight the responsible approach they take to crop management \u2013 or face the \nprospect of further restrictions as the government pursues a \u201cgreen\u201d Brexit.\n\nThe need to demonstrate that farmers use a range of methods \u2013 not just agrochemicals \u2013 to manage pests and \ndiseases is seen as key to ensure policymakers understand the complexities of modern farming techniques and \navoid imposing additional regulations on the sector.\n\nSee also: Biopesticides play a greater role on arable farms\n\nThe issue was discussed by more than 40 growers, agronomists, academics and other industry professionals who \ngathered on Tuesday (7 June) for the first integrated pest management (IPM) summit hosted by the NFU at \nStoneleigh Park, Warwickshire.\n\n\n\nThere are many definitions of IPM but most involve the careful consideration of all available plant protection \nmethods and the integration of appropriate measures \u2013 including natural pest control \u2013 that emphasise the \nproduction of healthy crops with the least disruption to agro-ecosystems.\n\nPrinciples of integrated pest management\n\nCrop rotation\n\nCultivation techniques\n\nSeed breeding\n\nBalanced fertilisation, liming, irrigation and drainage practices\n\nHygiene measures\n\nBeneficial organisms\n\nThresholds for harmful organisms\n\nMonitoring\n\nReview of options\n\n(Source: The Voluntary Initiative)\n\nScrutiny\n\nEssex farmer and NFU combinable crops chairman Tom Bradshaw said: \u201cOne consistent challenge that we have \nfaced as an industry over the past decade is the intense scrutiny that our use of plant protection products has been \nunder.\u201d\n\nHigh-profile debates over glyphosate and neonicotinoids were just two examples, said Mr Bradshaw.\n\nFar more crop protection products would be thrust into the limelight as the EU sought to clamp down on endocrine \ndisruptors, he added.\n\nBrexit would not resolve the situation because the UK would likely have to continue abiding by the same rules if it \nwas to remain a valued EU trading partner, added Mr Bradshaw.\n\nThis meant farmers had to raise their voice and the sector\u2019s profile to get their message across.\n\n\u201cThe thought process that the vast majority of us go through during the farming year is about minimising the use of \nplant protection products \u2013 and yet we fail to talk about the basics,\u201d Mr Bradshaw told the meeting. \u201cWe need to \nshout about what we do.\u201d\n\nGovernment ministers and civil servants often didn't realise that most farmers used IPM techniques to reduce \nagrochemical applications.\n\nThey included delayed drilling dates, spring cropping and reduced cultivations (see \u2018Principles of integrated pest \nmanagement\u2019, above).\n\nComplex\n\nMr Bradshaw added: \u201cGoing forward we need to make sure policymakers realise that farming is incredibly complex \nand to make sure there is a safe, secure, affordable supply of food we need access to all the tools in the toolbox.\n\n\n\n\u201cNew products are few and far between so we need to make sure we do everything we can to maintain access and \nprevent resistance to the current products we have access to. Astute implementation of integrated management \ntechniques is crucial to that.\u201d\n\nYorkshire farmer and Voluntary Initiative chairman Paul Temple said demonstrating that IPM had environmental \nbenefits would help fend off the threat of heavy legislation \u2013 and encourage policies that allowed growers to self-\nregulate rather than face inspections.\n\nA similar view was expressed by Lincolnshire agronomist Sean Sparling, chairman of the Association of \nIndependent Crop Consultants, who said IPM could be seen as a hybrid of conventional agriculture and the best of \norganic production.\n\nFarmer Phil Jarvis, who is head of farming at the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust\u2019s Allerton Project in \nLeicestershire, is already using reduced tillage IPM techniques to combat cabbage stem flea beetle in oilseed rape \nfollowing the withdrawal of neonicotinoid seed treatments.\n\nRather than regulating farmers, Mr Javis said it was vital the benefits of IPM were reflected in the government's \nforthcoming Agriculture Bill, which will detail the government\u2019s post-Brexit policies for the farming sector when it is \npublished later this year.\n\nCase study: Farm measures business benefits of integrated approach\n\nThe cost benefits to farm businesses of adopting integrated pest management (IPM) techniques will be quantified in \na new collaboration between the AHDB and the Linking Environment And Farming (Leaf) initiative.\n\nKent grower Mark Bowsher-Gibbs is farm manager at Blackbird Farming \u2013 the trading name for GH Dean & Co \u2013 \nand hosts the AHDB\u2019s Sittingbourne Monitor Farm. The farm has been Leaf marque certified since 2007 and has \nnow become a Leaf demonstration farm.\n\nMr Bowsher-Gibbs carries out an annual Leaf sustainable farm review to record the IPM techniques carried out \nacross the business. It identifies areas where they are performing particularly well \u2013 and areas where there is space \nfor continual improvement.\n\n\u201cWhere we\u2019ve got to do more is in energy use monitoring, reducing waste, recycling and reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions,\u201d says Mr Bowsher-Gibbs. \u201cOn the welfare, social health, nutrient management and soil quality side, we \nwere getting top marks, and that\u2019s great to know.\u201d\n\nAnalysing the outcomes of the Leaf review using the AHDB's Farmbench tool will now establish the economic \nimpact of some of these practices, helping the farm to make the most of natural resources and will improve \nbusiness productivity.\n\nThe business has already benefited from a labour and machinery cost review, recently carried out on behalf of \nAHDB by consultants from Strutt & Parker. The results enabled him to compare his own strip-till performance with \nother farms.\n\nData confirmed the farm operates a low-cost and sustainable crop establishment system. But it also revealed a \nhigher than average amount of labour per hectare. Mr Bowsher-Gibbs said: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong for us, \nbut it does make us look at our approach to labour.\u201d\n\nThe summer Monitor Farm meeting at Sittingbourne, which is open to growers, takes place on 19 June.

The company had a 200m (\u00a3175m) turnover in 2017 and \nsays business is growing at 12% annually.\n\nThe use of biological control has reduced the use of crop protection chemicals by up to 95% in indoor tomato \ncultivation, says Koppert marketing director Peter Maes. But he adds: \u201cWe are moving more and more from \nhorticulture to outdoor field crops.\u201d\n\nFour key factors are driving the market for IPM products, says Mr Maes. They are pesticide resistance, residue \nmanagement, the need to increase productivity and quality, and consumer interest in organic food.\n\nIn the UK, Koppert is working with agritech company Azotic Technologies using micro-organisms to capture \nnitrogen from the atmosphere. The companies say N-Fix can reduce fertiliser usage and nitrogen pollution as well \nas improving plant efficiency and increasing yields.\n\nKoppert celebrated its 50th anniversary last year and set up its UK subsidiary company at Haverhill, \nCambridgeshire in 1981.\n\nBut Mr Maes says he believes IPM techniques are still in their infancy \u2013 with increasing potential to boost farming \nproductivity.\n\nKoppert says its \u201cRotabug\u201d machine which releases beneficial predator insects to destroy crop pests can reduce \nlabour costs from \u00a360 to \u00a36/ha.\n\nInitially developed as a blanket treatment for indoor strawberries, the company plans to use drones to spot-treat \noutdoor crops within five years.\n\nThat potential could be realised more quickly with more government support for research into alternatives to active \ningredients, says Mr Maes. \u201cA lot of education needs to be done so regulators understand what we do \u2013 and what \ncan be achieved.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA shortage of Group 3s and a glut of Group 1 wheats has resulted in biscuit wheat premiums rivalling that for full \nbreadmakers, but without the extra growing costs.\n\nPaul Taylor, head of crop marketing at Agrii, highlights that premiums for some buyback contracts are currently \n\u00a310-\u00a312/t for this harvest in 2019, although this is expected to ease back next season.\n\n\u201cIt is taking that level of premium to get farmers interested in growing Group 3s.\u201d Historically, the premium has been \n\u00a32-\u00a33/t.\n\nSee also: Top-quality wheats may cut imports and reduce risks from Brexit\n\nHowever, a newly recommended variety could help biscuit wheats bounce back, offering high yields and better \ndisease resistance.\n\nPreviously, Group 3 was the biggest wheat market, helped by a clutch of good varieties including Claire, Consort \nand Robigus, says Chris Guest, seed manager at Gleadell. However, it had diminished until about two years ago.\n\nBasset and Barrel from KWS helped to revitalise the group by reducing the yield penalty of growing a Group 3 \ninstead of a Group 4, especially Barrel with its northern yield of 107%.\n\n\n\nHowever, their one weakness was septoria and this tended to put growers off, especially those in high-septoria \nareas.\n\nSeptoria\n\nThis is where newcomer Elicit comes in, bringing a higher septoria rating of 6.4, compared with 4.7 and 5.2 for \nBarrel and Basset, respectively.\n\n\u201cIt is better than Revelation, which is looked upon as a good variety,\u201d says Mr Taylor.\n\nMr Guest adds: \u201cNow we have a true Group 3 variety with a class-leading yield [103%], which looks strong across \nthe whole Recommended List.\n\n\u201cBacked up with midge resistance and relatively stiff straw, it ticks a lot of boxes.\u201d\n\nThe variety is also suitable for later drilling, with the latest safe drilling date of late February, says Mr Taylor.\n\nDemand\n\nSo what about demand? Mr Taylor says there is a potential Group 3 market for up to 1m tonnes and currently there \nis a shortfall, forcing millers to blend inferior soft Group 4s.\n\nHowever, this does not work for all millers, hence there is demand for more true Group 3.\n\nCurrently Group 3 accounts for about 7.5-8% of certified seed. Mr Guest believes that, with Elicit in the sector, this \ncould rise to 10% next season, with Barrel and Elicit being the two largest by market share.\n\n\u201cIt [Elicit] is equivalent to the top-yielding Group 4 soft and is just 3% behind the top Group 4 hard. The premium \ncan offset this yield difference.\u201d\n\nIn addition, there is less pressure over specification, not needing extra nitrogen fertiliser or inputs like group 1s, \nhaving a general specification of 10.7% protein.\n\nSo the combination of a domestic shortage and a new variety with no significant weakness, both agree that growers \nshould have confidence to grow more Group 3.\n\nElicit stands up well\n\nColin Welby is one of only two farmers in the UK to have grown Elicit wheat last season and he highlights its \nstanding power.\n\nThe seed grower, based near Spalding in Lincolnshire, says it stood up well last summer, in a season that tested \nwheat. It also combined well, he adds.\n\nHe grows diverse crops on silt, including wheat seed crops for Elsoms, sugar beet, daffodils and brassicas.\n\nHe drilled the 6ha crop on 5 October and notes that it established well. \u201cThere was good emergence and early \nvigour.\u201d\n\nThe crop yielded 10t/ha, having received a three-spray fungicide programme plus two growth regulators.\n\n \n\n!function(e,t,n,s){var \ni=\"InfogramEmbeds\",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?\"http:\":\"https:\";if(/^\\/{2}/.test(s)&&(\ns=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var \n\n\n\na=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,\"script\",\"infogram-\nasync\",\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\");\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nTriticale's ability to out-yield other crops as a second cereal, combined with growing markets like anaerobic \ndigestion, means it is worth another look for the coming season, say researchers.\n\nAHDB-funded work done by ADAS has shown that triticale can be grown for both feed grain and wholecrop, \nopening up a place for the crop in the energy markets and making it suitable for feeding to both ruminants and non-\nruminants at the right inclusion levels.\n\nIts poor-relation image is out of date, believes Daniel Kindred of ADAS, who has seen it out-yield first wheats by 3% \nand second wheats by 8% in trials over six years, with its greatest advantage being as a second cereal. \n\nThis is especially tempting given the poor performance of second cereals last harvest.\n\nSee also: Q&A: Tips on using anaerobic digestate as a fertiliser\n\nAlternative feedstock for AD\n\nHe also highlights that triticale\u2019s high biomass production and earliness make it an alternative feedstock for \nanaerobic digestion (AD) plants \u2013 something which is often overlooked.\n\n\u201cRye is promoted for the AD market, but triticale comes in with lower seed costs, slightly earlier maturity and the \nflexibility of keeping it for grain at harvest if prices become preferable,\u201d he says.\n\nCurrently, the bigger potential market is as animal feed, he acknowledges, as although protein levels tend to be \nlower than those of feed wheat, triticale has higher lysine, methionine and threonine levels \u2013 making it especially \nsuitable for feeding to pigs.\n\nResilience\n\nIn the field, its high yields, resistance to septoria, take-all tolerance and fewer pest problems are all useful, while the \ncrop\u2019s competitiveness against blackgrass and lower nitrogen requirement than other cereals are further \nadvantages.\n\n\u201cIt is more efficient at utilising nitrogen than wheat, so tends to need around 40kg/ha less,\u201d he explains.\n\nIn terms of gross margins, it has an advantage of around \u00a360/ha, notes Dr Kindred.\n\n\u201cThe latest varieties are giving much higher yields than many growers associate with triticale.

It seems to shrug them off \nand grow away unheeded.\u201d\n\nSince then, it has also proved cheaper to grow than winter barley and capable of producing considerably more \nstraw \u2013 something which has a value in the west. As a result, the crop\u2019s area has increased, especially on lighter \nsoils.\n\nIn most seasons, he recommends a three-spray fungicide programme, as triticale is prone to yellow rust. \u201cWe will \ndo a T0, T1 and T2, with a robust plant growth regulator programme as well. Essentially, we treat it like growing \nrye.\u201d\n\nOne observation about the crop this year is that it has developed a massive root system and has coped with the \nvery wet spring conditions better than other cereals, he notes.\n\nAgromomist Charles Starkings, East Midlands\n\nZantra agronomist Charles Starkings has got triticale growing on five of the farms that he looks after in the East \nMidlands, where it is proving to be a popular low-input crop choice.\n\nTo date, yields have been very good and newer varieties such as KWS Fido are giving consistent results of over \n10t/ha and have hit the dizzy heights of 13t/ha on one farm, he reports, while the crop\u2019s management has been \nstraightforward.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s being grown for grain and it typically sells at a \u00a310 discount to wheat,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s either being used as a \nmore profitable alternative to second wheat or where growers don\u2019t want winter barley in the rotation.\u201d\n\nA few more herbicide options than are available in barley and a very competitive growth habit make triticale good \nfor blackgrass situations, adds Mr Starkings, who believes it has a role in helping to smother grassweeds and limit \nseed return.\n\n\u201cWe tend to use a pre-emergence herbicide on it where blackgrass is an issue, and then let it do its job.\u201d\n\nTriticale is cheaper to grow, in terms of fungicides and nitrogen, but it does need attention with growth regulators, \nhe says. \u201cIt can grow very tall and will put on a great deal of biomass quickly.\u201d\n\nIn a normal year, he will advise a two- or three-spray programme, with epoxiconazole and metrafenone aimed at \nyellow rust and mildew in early spring growth, after which he focuses on keeping yellow rust out.\n\nVarieties\n\nThere is an AHDB Descriptive List for winter triticale, so growers can compare the performance of varieties grown in \nUK conditions.\n\nDominating the market is KWS Fido, which has a yield of 105%, but there are three new additions to the list for \n2018 drillings.\n\nKasyno from Senova has taken the top spot, with a 2% yield advantage over Fido and shorter straw. Also \nrecommended are Dometica on 100% and LD17 on 99%.\n\n\n\nCase study\n\nBridgnorth Monitor Farm\n\nTriticale is being grown for the first time this year by Adrian Joynt, farm manager at Goulburn Farms in Shropshire, \nand host of the AHDB Bridgnorth Monitor Farm.\n\nWith 26ha of winter triticale KWS Fido on some very light ground, he has replaced some winter barley with the crop \nto look at its on-farm potential and has no concerns about marketing it at harvest.\n\n\u201cWe have some options \u2013 there are two local merchants who are happy to take it, we can use it to feed our own \ncattle,\u201d he says.\n\nAnaerobic digestion is another possibility, he adds. \u201cWe are already growing hybrid rye for a local AD plant, so that \nadds to our choice of outlets. But we didn\u2019t set out to grow it with that market in mind.\u201d\n\nMr Joynt points out that triticale is worth a bit more than winter barley and has the added bonus of lower growing \ncosts and a higher yield.\n\n\u201cIt needs less nitrogen, fewer fungicides and the seed is cheaper,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has looked far better than wheat or \nbarley would have done on the same site, but it\u2019s still early days.\u201d\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nFor young people dreaming of running their own farm business, getting into poultry could be an ideal way to build \nup cash and experience if land and money are proving hard to come by.\n\nBritish agriculture faces a dilemma. While interest in farming seems strong among the younger generations, the \ndream of getting into farming turns to a nightmare when the mammoth costs of buying or renting land and \nmachinery, and building sheds, stores and parlours are laid out.\n\nSee also: 8 secrets to progressing up the ag careers ladder\n\nWhile it isn\u2019t always the most obvious route into agriculture, poultry farming has helped young farmers build up \ncapital to pursue additional ventures, gain an extra income source or create space for themselves in the family farm \nbusiness.\n\nBreeding and selling pullets\n\nTom Parry\n\nAge: 23\n\nLocation: Brecon, Wales\n\nPoultry enterprise: Point of lay pullets\n\nFor Welsh young farmer Tom Parry, breeding and selling point of lay pullets was the ideal way to start small and \nbuild up enough money to move into sheep and cattle farming.\n\nGetting into poultry when he was just eight years old, today Tom has about 10 hens and cockerels including breeds \nthat range from the more traditional Gold Laced Barnevelder to ornamentals like the Blue Silkie.\n\nBreeding season runs from March to August, and he sells the pullets at about 19 weeks. \n\n\u201cDad encouraged me into this from an early age so that I could learn about the business side of farming,\u201d the 23-\nyear-old explains.\n\n\n\nHis family's 85ha beef and sheep farm sits on the northern fringe of the Brecon Beacons, about 40 miles up from \nCardiff.\n\nExpanding into sheep and beef\n\n\u201cThe poultry enabled me to get enough money together to eventually buy four Belgian Blue calves, which I hand-\nreared on the bucket,\u201d he says.\n\nAt 16, he was able to invest in his first Texels and today has a flock of 40 ewes, alongside 12 pedigree Blonde \ncattle that he keeps as part of a joint venture with his dad.\n\nTom points out that compared with sheep, poultry farming requires little investment to get going with a small \nnumber of birds, and this can be scaled up quickly once established.\n\nIt takes a minimal amount of time each day to keep his birds and the setup is very manageable, even though the \npeak selling time clashes with the tail end of lambing season.\n\nThere are good returns to be had too, he says, thanks to strong demand from the public and businesses looking for \nanimals for their small holdings. He sells hybrid pullets for \u00a315 each, while pure-breds fetch \u00a325.\n\nHe has customers who are prepared to travel to buy quality birds coming from across south Wales.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great selling poultry to a customer base that isn\u2019t solely farmers as this widens your opportunities,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cDealing direct with customers can be a great way of building confidence to move on to larger enterprises too, but \nit's always great to have as a side business. I love shaking hands with people and doing a deal.\u201d\n\nReinvesting in poultry\n\nHe admits that he has let his breeding stock numbers dwindle in recent years as the sheep and cattle interests have \ngrown, but now he\u2019s planning to reinvest in this side of his business because he sees it as a way of insulating \nhimself from any negative fallout once the UK withdraws from the European Union.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t much that affects the price because the target market is mostly smallholders,\u201d he points out. \u201cThe fact \nthat the income stream isn\u2019t really tied to traditional farming is one of the best things about it.\u201d\n\nSocial media is by far the number-one driver of sales for Tom \u2013 along with good old-fashioned word of mouth \u2013 with \nabout 40% of total sales taken as pre-orders.\n\nHe did have a website for a while, but found it expensive and complicated to maintain compared with the Facebook \npage he now uses and he advertises his pullets in many online groups.\n\n\u201cThe marketing of the birds is really key and social media helps to sell the story behind it all. Good photos are \nimportant \u2013 they've got to look visually impressive to catch the buyer's eye,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cPeople overlook poultry, especially on the scale that I am doing it. I think they make the mistake of assuming that it \nisn\u2019t worth the time and money, but that\u2019s wrong because you\u2019ve got to start somewhere, you can easily scale up \nand you can use the money you make to invest in other areas.\u201d\n\nFree-range turkey diversification\n\nWill Martin\n\nAge: 34\n\nLocation: St Austell, Cornwall\n\n\n\nPoultry enterprise: Turkey rearing\n\nFirst-generation farmer Will Martin diversified his beef and arable business with the introduction of free-range \nbronze turkeys for the lucrative Christmas trade.\n\nBased near Truro in Cornwall, he and his wife Kate farm about 100ha of owned and rented land which runs a herd \nof 80 spring-calving Limousins alongside a small number of pedigree Beef Shorthorns.\n\nSpring barley is grown across about 20ha for livestock feed and bedding.\n\nSix years ago Will started hunting for a diversification to bring some extra income on to the farm, and saw turkeys \nas a good bet.\n\nHis feathered enterprise has grown incredibly fast, going from producing 25 birds to rearing and butchering 800 \nturkeys for this Christmas.\n\nPoults arrive on the farm in June and are housed in a cattle shed with holes cut in the walls to allow the birds to \nroam. With an acre of land needed to rear 500 free-range turkeys, Will has plenty of room to expand.\n\n\u201cI wanted to add another income stream to the farm so I got some turkeys and I really enjoyed keeping them. \nTurkey is a really healthy, lean meat and there's great demand for it,\u201d Will says.\n\nThe birds hit maturity at 17 weeks but Will rears his to 24 weeks to improve the fat covering which makes for an \nextra-tasty turkey.\n\nXmas turkey trade\n\nFinal preparations for the festive season begin in early December, with the birds being killed, dry plucked by hand \nand hung for about two weeks to improve the flavour and give a distinctive dark colouring to the meat.\n\nThey are then hand finished and packed with herbs into special boxes ready for collection. About 80% are sold \ndirect to consumers, with the rest sold through butchers and farm shops.\n\nPrices range from \u00a345-\u00a375 depending on weight, and customers can pre-order on the farm\u2019s website with a \u00a320 \ndeposit.\n\n\u201cTurkeys eat a lot of food, so taking pre-orders and deposits throughout the year helps with cash-flow,\u201d he adds.\n\nNFU Poultry Indurstry Programme\n\nThere's a lack of understanding when comes to poultry farming that could be at least partly to blame for the sector's \nstruggle to attract younger generations, according to NFU poultry adviser Aimee Mahony. \n\nThat's precisely why the NFU's Poultry Industry Programme was set up, bringing together 16 young people from \nacross the sector to inform and inspire the next generation of poultry farmers.\n\n\"There is a recruitment problem in the poultry industry, despite the fact that there are roles like assistant manager \nthat pay about \u00a340,000 without the need for prior experience in some cases,\" says Aimee.\n\nPoultry makes a great diversification for pretty much any farm, helping to spread risk in times of uncertainty, she \nadds.\n\n\"We are now seeing more arable farms setting up poultry units to support their businesses. There are cases where \nthere isn't enough work on the family farm to warrant taking on sons or daughters, so they diversify to \naccommodate them.\"\n\n\n\nYoung poultry farmer and former Farmers Apprentice finalist Thomas Gent thinks more should consider the \nindustry.\n\n\"People perceive it to be less muddy boots farming and perhaps more food production. It's worth considering if \nyou're a young person who's struggling to find a way into farming.\"\n\nHis family farm near Peterborough has 64,000 free-range layers producing about 60,000 eggs a day for the Happy \nEgg brand.\n\nThe farm was originally all arable, and without enough work to support Thomas joining the family business, a \npoultry diversification was the clear solution to keep everyone busy.\n\nWith each person in the UK consuming about 200 eggs a year, Thomas says there's solid demand for their \nproduce.\n\n\"We work on five-year contracts with prices locked in so it protects us from any major volatility, although feed costs \ncan go up. The main issue that we have is hiring good staff,\" he says.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nA familiar menace has returned to the farm. The lesser-spotted fly-tipper. Over the past couple of months we \nhaven\u2019t had too many incidents, but a few weeks ago I had to deal with a massive pile of rubbish. \n\nSomeone had apparently decided that our wood would look much more picturesque with a pile of old carpets, \npaving slabs, children\u2019s toys and bits of wood full of nails. \n\nI know it\u2019s something that most farmers have to deal with, but I still find it hard to understand why anyone \nwould decide to do this.\n\nSee also: More Will\u2019s Way farming columns\n\nHow can someone drive into a beautiful area of woodland and decide that this is the place where they should dump \ntheir rubbish? \n\nIn theory, fly-tippers who are convicted at a magistrates\u2019 court can be handed a 12-month prison sentence or be \nfined up to \u00a350,000, but this rarely happens. \n\nThe most likely outcome is that they get away with it scot-free or have to pay a small fine to the council.\n\nThis simply isn\u2019t good enough, and I hope Mr Gove at Defra decides to crack down on these selfish individuals very \nsoon.  \n\nData-driven doses\n\nOf course, we don\u2019t spend all of our time clearing up other people\u2019s unwanted belongings. We recently tested out \nthe Isaria crop sensor I wrote about in one of my previous columns, and it was a promising start. \n\nIt appeared to do exactly what it was supposed to. In the poorer areas of the field, it told the spreader to deliver \nmore nitrogen and in the better areas it directed it to spread less. \n\nThe principle behind it is pretty simple but the technology that makes it work is very clever. It\u2019s too early to judge its \neffectiveness yet, but I\u2019m hoping to see its benefits by the time next year\u2019s harvest arrives. \n\nAt the moment we\u2019re still working out what to do with all of the data it produces, but I\u2019m fairly confident that we\u2019ll \nhave got our heads around it by the spring, when we plan to start using it again.\n\n\n\nCountdown to harvest 2018\n\nIt doesn\u2019t feel like very long ago that I was writing about the long, wet winter in Norfolk, but now it\u2019s gone the other \nway. \n\nWe\u2019ve had dry and hot conditions here for several weeks now and the crops are definitely starting to show it. \n\nIf you walk down the tramlines of many of the fields, you\u2019ll see cracks everywhere and the crops certainly seem to \nbe shorter than they were at this time last year. \n\nLuckily for us, most of our cereals were established in the autumn, but if we had decided to do more drilling in the \nspring I\u2019d be a bit more concerned right now.\n\nI still think we\u2019ll have okay yields, but I don\u2019t reckon we\u2019ll be chalking up any records. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to predict when harvest will begin, but I\u2019m hoping that by the time I write my next column at the end of \nJuly, we\u2019ll be well under way.\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nThe UK\u2019s first case of resistance to a monepantel wormer is a wake-up call for sheep farmers and advisers to follow \nbest practice guidelines, an industry expert has warned.\n\nIt has emerged the farm where the case occurred, previously saw multiple resistance to other wormers meaning it \nwas relying heavily on the newer monepantel type.\n\nSee also: Wormer resistance in sheep explained\n\nThe animals were also being moved to low-challenge pasture following treatment, which is highly selective for \nresistance leading to a \u201cperfect storm\u201d for resistance to develop.\n\nSpeaking for the Sustainable Control of Parasites in Sheep (Scops) group, Sheep consultant Lesley Stubbings said \nthe issue revealed the dangers of failing to correctly integrate newer wormers into control programmes.\n\n\u201cScops understands the farm concerned had a history of triple resistance to the 1-BZ [white], 2-LV [yellow] and 3-\nML [clear] groups of anthelmintics.\n\n\u201cThis meant they were relying almost exclusively on the newer monepantel wormer, the 4-AD [orange] group, for \nworm control,\u201d Ms Stubbings said.\n\nOther sheep farmers can avoid this risk by following Scops guidelines on the use of the 4-AD and 5-SI (purple) \nwormers, she added.\n\nScops has been advising that 4-AD and 5-SI wormers should be carefully incorporated into control programmes as \na quarantine drench and a mid/late season treatment for lambs.\n\nThat advice was given to avoid the exact situation where the other three groups were no longer effective and the \ngroup 4AD was relied upon alone, Ms Stubbings added.\n\nThe resistance case was reported in the Veterinary Parasitology journal\n\nScops advice on orange and purple wormers\n\nThe two newest wormer groups (4-AD and 5-SI) should be alternated and incorporated into worm control \nprogrammes on all sheep farms, not left until others fail\n\n\n\nThere are only two occasions when a group 4-AD or 5-SI should be used \u2013 quarantine, and mid/late season as a \none-off annual drench for lambs\n\nGroups 4-AD and 5-SI should only be used at other times under veterinary direction and then only if the full \nanthelmintic resistance status of the farm is known.\n\nEffectiveness of products used should be monitored carefully\n\nEnsure the correct dose rate (by weighing animals and treating to the heaviest in a group), calibrate the gun and \nadminister correctly, over the back of the tongue\n\nIf moving to low-challenge pasture after treatment, sheep must either be left on the dirty pasture for four to five days \nbefore moving, or at least 10% of the animals left untreated\n\nCheck the efficacy of wormer treatments on a regular basis\n\nJOURNAL : Farmers Weekly\n\nSmall vehicle and motorbike specialist Yamaha has updated its ATV and UTV offerings for 2019.

over the next two years after northern counties, led by Lancashire, \nlined up to voice their disapproval of a \u00a35 increase per YFC member in the national levy, currently set at \u00a316.38.\n\nThey succeeded in passing a more modest increase of \u00a31.64 per member after winning support from \nrepresentatives from Yorkshire and Northumberland at the AGM, held in the Winter

It will make family farms non-\nsustainable.\u201d\n\nVice-chairman Dafydd Jones said a level playing field would be important, and that high food safety and animal \nwelfare standards were the best selling points of British food.\n\nWhat changes would you like to see for subsidies post Brexit?\n\nCennydd Jones: \u201cThere must be a drive to push efficiencies most of all. Subsidies should go to the farm practitioner \nrather than the landowner \u2013 the farmer knows the land better than anyone else.\u201d\n\nDafydd Jones: \u201cThe crucial thing is it has to be simple to be effective. We also need to be upskilling in the sector, \nespecially if we want to compete with the technology and skills in places like New Zealand.\u201d\n\nLaura Elliott: \u201cIn the future policy is going to have to support farmers who are being innovative and pushing \nboundaries.\u201d\n\nLaura Elliott, Wales YFC chairman, told the committee: \u201cWe fear agriculture may be used as a cheap trade-off for \nother things, treated as a commodity rather than understanding its background.
