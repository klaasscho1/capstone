{"title": "Modern Agonies in Ancient Mexican Villages", "body": "\nJournalists from the United States often stop at the Mexican border when they're covering immigration issues, \nalmost as if the crisis starts and stops on this side.\n\nMatt Black, 40, who has spent years documenting the migrant population in the Central Valley (\"Oaxacan Exodus\"), \ncould very well see the effects in California. But for \"People of the Clouds,\" he wanted to understand what has \nhappening on the other side of the border.\n\nIt's not easy. To get to the remote Mixteca mountain region - including parts of the states of Oaxaca, Guerrero and \nPuebla - he typically takes a 12-hour bus ride from Mexico City to a highway town, from which he either hitches a \nride in the back of a truck or walks to the villages where he photographs. As he did in the Central Valley, Mr. Black \nimmerses himself in his subject, spending up to six weeks in the region.\n\nHis grainy, black-and-white pictures show a culture that has not been greatly touched by the modern world and \ncommunities that have lost most of their population, like the village of San Miguel Cuevas. \"In the span of a \ngeneration, this whole culture is vanishing,\" Mr. Black said. \"You can't find anyone between the ages of 16 and 45.\"\n\nMr. Black has been working on this story 10 years. He is not yet finished. In fact, he has begun a campaign on \nKickstarter to raise money for a return trip to the Mixteca region, a once-fertile area that has turned into a dustbowl. \nIn this way, he can investigate the environmental forces behind the migration. Still, he said, \"It's about the people \nfirst and foremost.\"\n\n\u2022 An Ancient Culture in Mountainous Mexico\n\n\u2022 Showcase: A Story, Waiting to Happen\n\n\u2022 Silent Sentinels Along a Vast Frontier\n\n\u2022 Chasing Stigma in Indonesia\n\n\u2022 A Warm Feeling for the Arctic\n"}
