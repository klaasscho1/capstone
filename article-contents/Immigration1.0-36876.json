{"title": "SENATE PANEL TO HOLD MCNARY HEARING OCT. 3", "body": "\nWASHINGTON: The Senate Judiciary Committee's confirmation hearing on St. LouisCounty Executive Gene \nMcNary will be held on Oct. 3, the committee announced Wednesday.  McNary has been nominated by President \nGeorge Bush to head the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\nThe hearing originally had been scheduled for next Monday. It was postponed after Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., cited a \nscheduling conflict and officials of various civil rights groups asked for more time to look into McNary's \nqualifications.  Some of the groups also had asked to testify at the hearing. But Jerry Tinker, staff director of the \npanel's subcommittee on immigration, said the schedule would not allow time for that.  Tinker said the groups could \nsubmit written testimony for the record if they wished.  Post-Dispatch Washington Bureau\n"}
