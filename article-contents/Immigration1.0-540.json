The money must be allowed to reach real people, fund infrastructure and give people an \nopportunity to work for themselves again.<nl/> Until or unless central banks change their policies to spur this \npositive economic behavior, they are basically funding war, depopulation and death and destruction.<nl/> \n[Comment: Fitts is right. But that is what the banksters want \u2014 destabilization, depopulation, war.

There are \nalways patterns, signs and indicators that tell us that something is about to happen. In this article, I am going to \nshare with you four patterns that are happening right now that also happened just prior to the great financial crisis of \n2008. These four signs are very strong evidence that a deflationary financial collapse is right around the corner. \nInstead of the hyperinflationary crisis that so many have warned about, what we are about to experience is a \ncollapse in asset prices, a massive credit crunch and a brief period of absolutely crippling deflation. The response \nby national governments and global central banks to this horrific financial crisis will cause tremendous inflation \ndown the road, but that comes later. What comes first is a crisis that will initially look a lot like 2008, but will \nultimately prove to be much worse. The following are 4 things that are happening right now that indicate that a \ndeflationary financial collapse is imminent\u2026<nl/> #1 Commodities Are Crashing<nl/> In mid-2008, just before the \nU.S. stock market crashed in the fall, commodities started crashing hard. Well, now it is happening again. In fact, \n\n\nthe Bloomberg Commodity Index just hit a 13 year low, which means that it is already lower than it was at any point \nduring the last financial crisis\u2026<nl/><nl/> Are Tech Giants' New Buildings Signs of the Top?[114]<nl/> If pouring \nbillions of dollars into outrageous 'look at me' buildings isn't tempting the gods, what is it?<nl/> When banks build \nnew gleaming headquarters, that generally marks the top of the bank's fortunes. There appears to be some sort of \nhubris in constructing a monumental new headquarters that shouts 'we're rich beyond all conception' that angers \nthe stock market gods.<nl/> For this reason, we should ponder the glamorous new headquarters Facebook just \ncompleted and Apple's 'spaceship' campus that is under construction. Google's plans for an ultra-modernist \nheadquarters were recently tabled by the city of Mountain View, but the grandiose plans themselves may count as \nhubris to the stock market gods.<nl/> Here is an interior view of Facebook's new digs: note that it's literally dripping \nwith arty decor:<nl/><nl/> Buffett, Johnny Depp Snap Up 'Cheap' Greek Islands[115]<nl/> On Monday, we brought \nyou a day in the life of a Greek realtor. Courtesy of Bloomberg, we got a first-hand account of what it's like in the \nAthens real estate market now that the Greek economy has collapsed.<nl/> 'For the last 15 days,' the Athenian \nrealtor featured in the video says, 'the market has been really dead.'<nl/> That's not surprising. Capital controls \nhave gripped the country since PM Alexis Tsipras called for a referendum on creditors' proposals and Greeks are \nmore concerned about whether they'll be food on the shelves and gas at the pumps (an acute credit crunch \nthreatens to leave the country with a shortage of imported goods) than they are about buying homes.<nl/> 'At least \n50% of real estate agents have closed down,' the realtor continues, adding that 'the market has been only those \nwho can afford [to pay] cash in recent years.'<nl/> But who can afford to pay cash for property in Greece? For the \nanswer, we go to Newsweek.<nl/><nl/> Day of Reckoning for American Pensions is Fast Approaching[116]<nl/> \nFor decades, local and state governments in the United States have made promises to their employees that they \ncannot keep. They guaranteed a certain level of income to retirees at a time when America was its most \nprosperous, and when most people didn't live as long as they do now. Those lucrative pensions they promised are \nstarting to catch up to them in a big way.<nl/> Earlier this week, Moody's cut Chicago's credit rating to 'junk,' largely \ndue to their $20 billion pension shortfall, and they put the City of Houston on notice. Many of the major pension \nfunds use the stock market to bolster their savings, but despite record profits on Wall Street, it doesn't seem like \nany of them reached their revenue goals. California's Public Employees Retirement System only reached a third of \nthe annual revenue they projected, and the state's teacher fund failed to reach their goal. Overall, Moody's found \nthat the 25 largest public pension funds in the US have a $2 trillion budget shortfall.<nl/> That means that many \nstate and local governments may face credit rating cuts in the near future, which will leave them owing even more \nmoney.<nl/><nl/> Deflation Lingers for Italy's Poorest, Says ISTAT[117]<nl/> Low energy costs hold down price \npressures for poor families<nl/> (ANSA) \u2014 Rome, July 21 \u2014 For some of Italy's poorest families, deflation \nremained in effect in the second quarter of this year, national statistics agency Istat said Tuesday. It broke down \nprice pressures according to income brackets and found that low-income households with little to spend were still \nseeing the benefits of weak energy prices. From April to June, families with low monthly expenditures saw prices \nfall by 0.2% over 2014, while those with more cash to spend felt inflation of 0.3% compared with Q2 2014.<nl/><nl/> \nItaly: Renzi's Announced 50-Bn Euros in Tax Cuts Lift Stock Market[118]<nl/> Premier sets out plans to eliminate \nlevy on homes<nl/> (ANSA) \u2014 Rome, July 20 \u2014 Italian stocks rallied Monday morning as investors absorbed \nannouncements of a major tax cutting program by Premier Matteo Renzi, including what he called the end of a \nhated tax on homes.<nl/> Huge cuts of as much as 50 billion euros over five years were in the works, Renzi said in \nseveral weekend statements, starting with an announcement on Saturday to members of his Democratic Party \n(PD).<nl/> He followed that Sunday with a statement on his Facebook page and an interview with RAI televisions \nTg2 news.<nl/> Milan's FTSE Mib gained almost 1.2% in early trading Monday on the news.<nl/> Renzi, who has \nbeen pushing through a series of reforms including changes to the Italian Constitution to reduce the powers of the \nSenate, linked the tax cuts to his reforms.<nl/> He added that the cuts have already begun.<nl/> 'I propose a pact \nto Italians,' said Renzi.<nl/> 'If the reforms go forward we will be able to lower taxes by 50 billion euros over five \nyears,' Renzi said. That includes cuts that he said began last year, including an 80 euro monthly tax bonus for low-\nincome earners and a reduction in the IRAP regional business tax.<nl/><nl/> ATF Works With FBI and VA to Get \nVeterans' Guns Taken Away[119]<nl/> The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is involved \nin a government effort to disarm America's veterans and seniors who may lack the capacity to manage their \nfinances.<nl/> And it's not just veterans facing this scrutiny: now it's anybody who gets Social Security.<nl/> New \ndocuments obtained by The Daily Caller reveal that ATF, a division of the Department of Justice, is working with the \nFBI and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to enter veterans who get VA benefits into the government's \nNational Instant Criminal Background Check System.<nl/> TheDC first reported on a government program in which \n\n\n\nthe VA sends veterans' medical information to the FBI to disarm them. VA uses sneaky criteria to get veterans on \nthe list for 'persons prohibited under federal law from receiving or possessing firearms.'<nl/><nl/> Black Rebel Flag \nSupporter Dies After Being Ran Off Road, Witness Says[120]<nl/> An African-American who was a long-time \nConfederate flag supporter died after reportedly being chased by a car and ran off the road following a flag \nrally.<nl/> The victim, 49-year-old Anthony Hervey, was found dead in a flipped-over 2005 Ford Explorer near \nOxford, Miss., on Sunday and a passenger in the vehicle, Arlene Barnham, said that after leaving the pro-\nConfederate Flag 'Monumental Dixie' rally, they were chased by a silver car which then swerved into their Explorer, \ncausing it to crash.<nl/> 'HELP! They after us,' Barnham posted on Facebook during the chase. 'My vehicle inside \ndown.'<nl/> 'Anthony pinned in\u2026 gas leaking.'<nl/> The pair were both speakers at the rally and Hervey in \nparticular was well-known for wearing a Confederate uniform in support of Southern heritage and for writing the \nbook 'Why I Wave the Confederate Flag: Written by a Black Man.'<nl/> The MacAlester News-Capital contacted the \nMississippi Highway Patrol, which confirmed the accident but declined to give further details as the crash is still \nunder investigation.<nl/> Although shocking, this incident is not surprising given the government-driven purge of the \nConfederate flag which has only stirred up racial tensions within America.<nl/> Not long after President Obama \npublicly attacked the Confederate flag, people were filming themselves stealing Confederate flags off of people's \nprivate property.<nl/> This lunacy is possible because many Americans are completely ignorant of multifaceted \nhistory of the so-called Civil War, which was a war waged by the federal government against Southern states \nthreatening to use the Tenth Amendment to secede.<nl/> Unfortunately, the ignorant routinely victimize well-\neducated individuals like Hervey who know history.<nl/><nl/> Chattanooga Aftermath: Terrorist Mollycoddled But \nNo Flags Lowered to Half-Staff[121]<nl/> Why do major television networks continue to get away with \nmollycoddling murdering radical terrorists in the very wake of their evil carnage?<nl/> Within four days of the attack \nthat claimed the lives of four US Marines and a Navy sailors slaughtered in the Chattanooga shooting spree, ABC is \nportraying poor Mohammod Abdulazeez\u2014not as a radical Islamic terrorist\u2014but as a 'disturbed, suicidal young man \nusing drugs, preparing for bankruptcy and facing an appearance in criminal court'.<nl/> While their loved ones are \nin tearful mourning, the mainstream media's crying killer Abdulazeez a river and getting \u00fcber maudlin with the \nviolins.<nl/> Why is it that every time another Islamic terrorist strikes, the mainstream media cover them in \nvictimhood and portray them as everything except what they truly are?<nl/> [Comment: This is by design. Ignoring \nthe victims is intentional.]<nl/><nl/> Climate and Vaccine Data Both Systematically Faked to Produce False \n'Science'[122]<nl/> (NaturalNews) Many emerging scientists today are taken advantage of and used, controlled by \nthe funds (the puppet strings) of powerful industries and the revolving door that exists between industry and \ngovernment regulatory agencies. With their careers on the line, emerging scientists are coerced into supporting \n'science' data that props up the elite industries or powerful world agendas that seek total control of minds and \nfreedom. The science is passed off as truth and is used to motivate entire demographics of people to support new \nlaws, new taxes and more centralized government.<nl/> World governments like the UN are hard at work trying to \ncontrol the energy sector by imposing global carbon taxes.<nl/> A couple of researchers are fact-checking global \nwarming propaganda with the weather source data used to support it. What they have found is exaggerated \ngeneralizations, amplified misconceptions and even omitted data from cooling periods over the past 60 years.<nl/> \nThese researchers found out that the weather records are being systematically manipulated to produce false \nresearch data. Researcher Paul Homewood checked the published temperature graphs for three weather stations \nin Paraguay. He compared the actual data with the government-recorded data. He found out that the two sets of \ndata did not match. In each instance, he noticed that the reported data had been manipulated so that a cooling \ntrend appeared as a marked warming period.<nl/><nl/> Donald Trump Gave Out Lindsey Graham's Personal Cell \nNumber to America[123]<nl/> (CNN) Speaking in front of hundreds at a rally in South Carolina on Tuesday, Donald \nTrump read a number he said people could use to reach South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham's private cell \nphone.<nl/> Trump and Graham have engaged in an ongoing feud in the past few days as they battle for the \nRepublican presidential nomination. In Trump's speech Tuesday, he called Graham an 'idiot,' after Graham called \nhim a 'jackass,' in an interview Monday with CNN's Kate Bolduan.<nl/> Trump gave out the number and urged \nattendees to call it.<nl/> 'Give it a shot,' Trump said, urging people to call the state's senior senator.<nl/> When \nCNN called the number, it went directly to voicemail and the recorded message said it was the phone number for \nGraham. The mailbox was full.<nl/><nl/> FDA-Approved Drug Turns Ordinary People Into Obedient Zombies\u2026 \nSaps All Free Will\u2026 Allows People to be Programmed by the Media or Government\u2026 Sold as Transdermal \nPatch[124]<nl/> (NaturalNews) When I lived in Ecuador, I was warned about the pollen from the flower of a \nbeautiful tree. The pollen is called 'Devil's Breath,' and when a tiny amount is blown into the face of an intended \n\n\n\nvictim, it immediately saps that person's free will, turning them into a compliance zombie who will do anything \nthey're commanded to do: Empty their bank account, engage in sexual acts or even donate a kidney.<nl/> This isn't \nsome urban legend, either. The Devil's Breath pollen is rich in scopolamine, a potent drug that saps free will and \nturns people into zombies. Scopolamine can 'can wipe the memory of its victims,' reports the Daily Mail:<nl/> \nScopolamine can be blown in the face of a passer-by on the street, and within minutes, that person is under the \ndrug's effect \u2014 scopolamine is odourless and tasteless.<nl/> 'You can guide them wherever you want,' he \nexplained. 'It's like they're a child.'<nl/> [\u2026]The drug, he said, turns people into complete zombies and blocks \nmemories from forming. So even after the drug wears off, victims have no recollection as to what happened.<nl/> If \nall this sounds exactly like what we're all witnessing in American society today, that's because drug companies \nhave turned scopolamine into an FDA-approved prescription drug.<nl/><nl/> Former High Ranking U.S. Senator \nWants to 'Hang Edward Snowden on the Courthouse Square'[125]<nl/><nl/>We need to hang him on the \ncourthouse square as soon as we get a hold of him.<nl/> \u2014 Former vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee \non Intelligence, Saxby Chambliss, on Edward Snowden<nl/><nl/>It appears the past few days have represented a \nsort of coming out party for formerly powerful players in the U.S. government to showcase their fascist tendencies. \nEarlier today, I highlighted General Wesley Clark's clear suggestion during a MSNBC interview that Americans who \nare 'disloyal' should be forcibly separated from the 'normal' general population through the use of WWII style \ninternment camps.<nl/> In the latest display, video has emerged of former Republican Senator, and ex-vice \nchairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, saying that Edward Snowden should be hanged in the \ncourthouse square. What ever happened to fair trials?<nl/><nl/> Four Dead Marines: Collateral Damage in \nWashington's War on American Culture[126]<nl/> Muslims in America now manifest as remote human-drone-killing-\nchange-agents in our own country. The more Muslims we import into America, the more killings we expect to suffer \nin the coming months. We face post American multicultural chaos.<nl/> Did you notice the mainstream media \ntripped over itself NOT to admit the killer followed Islam. Nonetheless, Muslim Muhammad Joussuf Abdulzeez \nmurdered five military personnel in Chattanooga, Tennessee. At first, political correctness dictated no mention of \nthe killer's religion: Islam. Barack H. Obama refuses to admit to the violence of Islam.<nl/> In this series, you will \nhear from Warren, a U.S. citizen, speak to our multicultural Islamic predicament. The fact remains: our country \nconstitutes a killing ground for U.S. citizen Muslims imported into America by our own Congress.<nl/> 'As a horrific \nverification of the folly of open borders and multiculturalism, we now have four dead marines in Tennessee,' said \nWarren. 'The tragedy \u2014 getting past all of the sanctimonious official verbiage about how aberrant, awful, and \nunavoidable such things are \u2014 is that individuals like Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez represent EXACTLY the \nkind of people that 'The Powers That Be' in Washington (and in the White House) want as 'change agents' in this \ncountry to create the new, post-American culture that they are seeking to impose on all of us.'<nl/><nl/> John \nKasich Launches Presidential Run: 'We'Ll Prove Them Wrong'[127]<nl/> The Ohio governor says he has a long \nhistory of winning elections he wasn't supposed to.<nl/> Few are giving the two-term governor much of a chance of \nwinning the nomination. With his late announcement, Kasich will be competing against a group of better-known and \nbetter-funded rivals who have spent months on the campaign trail. National polls show the governor near the \nbottom of the pack, and it's uncertain whether Kasich will qualify to appear in the first Republican debate, slated to \nbe held Aug. 6 in Cleveland. Missing the cut for a debate that will be held in his home state, many believe, would be \nan embarrassment.<nl/><nl/> Lawyer: Tennessee Shooter's Uncle Detained in Jordan[128]<nl/> CHATTANOOGA, \nTenn. (AP) \u2014 An uncle of the man who killed four Marines and a sailor in attacks on Tennessee military sites has \nbeen in custody in Jordan since a day after the attack, a lawyer said Tuesday.<nl/> Abdel Qader al-Khatib told The \nAssociated Press that he was barred from seeing his client and that family members were also prevented from \nvisiting the detainee. Al-Khatib identified his client as Asaad Ibrahim Abdulazeez Haj Ali, a maternal uncle of the \nChattanooga attacker, Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez.<nl/> A Jordanian government official said Tuesday that \nsome of Abdulazeez's relatives in Jordan were being questioned as part of an investigation into his stay in the \nkingdom. He would not elaborate on the probe.<nl/> The official said he was sure the uncle and 'other relevant \npeople' are being questioned, but that he did not know whether he was in detention. The official spoke on condition \nof anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case with the media.<nl/> Abdulazeez spent several \nmonths in Jordan last year under a mutual agreement with his parents to help him get away from drugs, alcohol and \na group of friends his relatives considered a bad influence, according to a person close to his family. That person \nalso spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern it would have business repercussions.<nl/> An FBI spokesman \nhas declined to comment on that information\u2026<nl/><nl/> Millions and Millions of Mohammeds[129]<nl/> by Daniel \nGreenfield<nl/> During WW2, we would not have allowed millions of Germans named after the Fuhrer, who admired \n\n\n\nhim and worshiped him, into the country. And if we had done something that stupid, we would have had only \nourselves to blame when the darling Adolfs shot and bombed their way across America.<nl/> A country with more \nMohammeds is a more dangerous place. If a million mothers named their offspring after Charles Manson and \nraised them to embody Manson Family values, America would be a much scarier place. An America with a million \nMohammeds will be even worse.<nl/><nl/> Rachel Dolezal is Still 'Black'[130]<nl/> It was just over a month ago \nwhen Rachel Dolezal burst into the national spotlight as the white woman who pretended to be black and became \nan NAACP president. But now, nearly 40 days later, Dolezal, who no longer works at the Spokane chapter of the \nAfrican-American organization, still maintains that she is black.<nl/> In a piece for Vanity Fair, the racially confused \nsocial justice warrior doubled \u2014 tripled, quadrupled \u2014 down on her identity:<nl/><nl/>It's not a costume. I don't \nknow spiritually and metaphysically how this goes, but I do know that from my earliest memories I have awareness \nand connection with the black experience, and that's never left me. It's not something that I can put on and take off \nanymore. Like I said, I've had my years of confusion and wondering who I really [was] and why and how do I live my \nlife and make sense of it all, but I'm not confused about that any longer. I think the world might be\u2014but I'm \nnot.<nl/><nl/>Besides sticking to this otherwise unscientific claim, Dolezal said it's not her fault that America was \noffended by her lies, but their own.<nl/> [Comment: Naturally. She 'feels' black \u2014 therefore in her mind she is black. \nThe reprogramming of such Americans is complete. Feelings trump reality/facts.]<nl/><nl/> RNC Rips O'Malley for \nLinking Rise of ISIS to Climate Change[131]<nl/> Republican Party Chairman Reince Priebus ripped Democratic \npresidential hopeful Martin O'Malley on Monday for linking the rise of the Islamic State to climate change.<nl/><nl/> \nU.S. Murder Rate Plunges as Guns in Public Proliferate[132]<nl/> The number of Americans carrying concealed \nfirearms has exploded in recent years, and contrary to the narratives and fearmongering peddled by anti-gun-rights \nactivists, the sky did not fall. In fact, according to the most recent data, not only did the sky not fall, murder rates \nand violent crime over the same period have plunged dramatically \u2014 demolishing the claims of gun-control \nproponents, while bolstering the pragmatic case for even broader proliferation of public firearms ownership.<nl/> Of \ncourse, as The New American has reported for years, experts who study the issue have long known that more guns \nin the hands of law-abiding citizens is correlated with less violent crime and murder. A report released last week by \nthe Crime Prevention Research Center confirms that fact yet again, and makes it abundantly clear: In the United \nStates, as more and more people were legally carrying weapons in public, fewer people were being murdered and \nviolently victimized by criminals.<nl/><nl/> Who Expert: 'Glyphosate is Definitely Genotoxic'[133]<nl/> The World \nHealth Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer's (IARC) has reiterated its stance on \nglyphosate's carcinogenic profile and now calls it 'definitely genotoxic' \u2014 just to be sure the world understands that \nMonsanto is causing harm to human beings and animals fed GM food.<nl/> One of the co-authors of the IARC \nreport which found glyphosate to be 'probably carcinogenic,' professor Christopher Portier says that there is 'no \ndoubt in his mind' that Monsanto's best selling product, Round Up, is genotoxic. This means that it can damage \nDNA molecules in genes, causing tumors and other serious health issues.<nl/> The professor reiterated his stance \nwhen speaking recently in London at a scientific briefing on glyphosate in Westminster, organized by the Soil \nAssociation.<nl/><nl/> Canadian Imam Calling for Establishing the Caliphate[134]<nl/> Imam Mazin Abdul Adhim, a \nsenior cleric of Hizb ut-Tahrir \u20ac' Canada, calls upon the Muslim Ummah (Nation) to unite in order to establish the \nglobal Islamic state, also known by its Arabic name the Caliphate.<nl/> The London, Ontario based Imam, \nvehemently opposes the Caliphate founded by ISIS in Iraq and Syria and does not accept the authority of its self \nproclaim Calif Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Rather he advocates for a new Caliphate that will implement the Islamic Law \nword for word and extend its authority over all the Muslim lands.<nl/> In a video clip on the occasion of Eid al-Fitr \n(July 17, 2015) at the end of the month of Ramdan, Imam Abdul Adhim explained that the Muslim Ummah is one \nbody, and all its woes in the different parts of split up Muslim lands are originated only from the lack of a home for \nIslam and the absence of an Islamic regime that is able to represent the Ummah, as all Muslim regimes today are \n'traitors' or serving the interest of the 'enemy' (the picture of US President Barack Obama was shown in the \nbackground)\u2026<nl/><nl/> British Charge Muslim Man in Plot Against U.S. Military, Trying to Join ISIS[135]<nl/> A \nMuslim delivery driver used his rides to scout the largest U.S. air base in Britain, all the while planning to run over \nan American serviceman, kill him with a knife and detonate a suicide vest, according to UK prosecutor Mark \nDawson.<nl/> Authorities in Britain charged two Muslim relatives on Tuesday with terror-related offenses, alleging \nthat one was plotting an attack against U.S. military personnel in the UK and the other planned to go to the Middle \nEast to join ISIS.<nl/><nl/> Denmark: Santa Claus is Coming to Town\u2026 in July[136]<nl/> Santas from all over the \nworld are once again gathered in Copenhagen for the World Santa Claus Congress.<nl/> Jolly Santas and happy \nelves from all over the globe are having their annual meeting in Copenhagen for a three-day schedule that mixes \n\n\n\nofficial Santa business and pleasure.<nl/> More than 100 people dressed up as Santa Claus or 'Julemanden', \narrived in Copenhagen on Monday to take part in the annual activities of the World Santa Claus Congress.

Pell's comments came a month after Francis released his historic \nencyclical, 'Laudato si', calling on humanity to fight global warming.<nl/> 'We do need to slow down and look at \nreality in a different way, to appropriate the positive and sustainable progress which has been made, but also to \nrecover the values and the great goals swept away by our unrestrained delusions of grandeur,' the pope wrote.<nl/> \n\n\n\n'The urgent challenge to protect our common home includes a concern to bring the whole human family together to \nseek a sustainable and integral development, for we know that things can change.' The 192-page document, whose \nEnglish title is Praise Be to You: On Care for Our Common Home, calls on humanity to be more motivated and to \nimprove education to save the environment.<nl/> 'The earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an \nimmense pile of filth,' Pope Francis wrote.<nl/> 'The climate is a common good, belonging to all and meant for \nall.<nl/> 'At the global level, it is a complex system linked to many of the essential conditions for human life.<nl/> 'A \nvery solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently witnessing a disturbing warming of the climatic \nsystem.' Pell is a well-known climate change skeptic.<nl/> He was appointed to reform the Vatican's finances nearly \n18 months ago.<nl/> Last August Pell enraged survivors of clerical sex abuse by comparing the Vatican to a \ntrucking company that could not be blamed if a driver molested a hitchhiker.<nl/> Pell made the remark while \ntestifying via videolink from Rome to an Australian probe into historic abuse and alleged cover-ups when he was \nMelbourne archbishop in the 1990s.<nl/> Saying it would not be appropriate for legal culpability to be 'foisted' on \nchurch leaders, he drew an analogy between the Catholic Church and a trucking company, citing a hypothetical \nexample of a case involving a woman who was molested by a truck driver.<nl/> 'It would not be appropriate, \nbecause it's contrary to the policy, for the ownership, leadership of that company to be held responsible,' Cardinal \nPell said.<nl/> 'Similarly with the church and the head of any other organisation.<nl/> 'If every precaution has been \ntaken, no warning has been given, it is, I think, not appropriate for legal culpability to be foisted on the authority \nfigure.<nl/> 'If in fact the authority figure has been remiss through bad preparation [or] bad procedures or been \nwarned and done nothing or [done something] insufficient, then certainly the church official would be responsible.' \nNicky Davis from the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests (SNAP) was in the audience of the royal \ncommission during Cardinal Pell's comments.<nl/> She said the truck analogy left the audience 'open mouthed in \nshock'.<nl/> 'We were literally saying to each other, 'Did he really just say that?',' she said.<nl/> 'He shows that he \nreally has absolutely no conception of what is appropriate or inappropriate behaviour and what are appropriate or \ninappropriate things to say to survivors.<nl/> Dr Cathy Kezelman from Adults Surviving Child Abuse said the \n'outrageous' and 'appalling' analogy could do a lot of damage.<nl/> 'The victims are already in this process of being \nrepeatedly traumatised.

The divisions have existed long time before and even the fight against the \nIslamic State seems incapable of uniting the country. Only the guarantee of rights for minorities could still save \nnational unity. The provocation of prof. Afshin Shahi: Iraq is dead. Translation from the original English text by \nAsiaNews.<nl/> Bradford (AsiaNews) \u2014 The end of Iraq is no longer a matter of if, or a matter of when \u2014 it has \nalready happened. The country has been on life support for too long, and no matter how hard external players try to \nsave it, Iraq cannot save itself.<nl/> One of the fundamental properties of any nation state is some sense a national \nconsciousness, a sense of belonging; shared values regardless of how abstract they may be and, most importantly, \na collective commitment to the perpetuation of the nation itself, which is perceived to be organically connected to \n\n\n\nthe state. Without these ingredients, there never can be a stable nation state.<nl/> Of course, one could argue that \nperhaps Iraq never had a cohesive national consciousness anyway. After all, Iraq was only constructed almost on a \nwhim by the colonial masters of the previous century. Even at the height of 'stability' under Saddam Hussein, Iraq \nwas a state without a nation.<nl/> There was very little effort put into building an Iraqi nation and the obstacles were \nalways huge. The Kurds, who made up about 17-20% of the population, hardly subscribed to an Iraqi identity, and \nthe Shia majority felt deeply marginalised by the political elite who were mainly Sunni.<nl/> But what's happening in \nIraq today is different from the realities of a classic multi-ethnic or multi-religious society in the Middle East. Similar \nsituations and grievances exist in much of the region, but what makes the situation hopeless in Iraq is that there is \nno longer any strong state in power \u2014 and, more importantly, no prospect of one emerging any time soon.<nl/> Out \nof the bottle<nl/> Until 2003, Saddam's Hussein's repressive state at least put a lid on the chaos, but invasion, \ndisastrous post-war policies and the opportunistic interference of regional states and sub-state actors finally let the \ngenie out of the bottle.<nl/> The forces unleashed are now beyond control, and old animosities between ethno-\nsectarian groups are channelled into armed confrontation. This cycle of violence has effectively burned any \ngrassroots bridges between the divided groups, who were supposed to be part of a nation, and these problems are \nhere to stay even if Iraq cleanses itself of transnational jihadism.<nl/> The rise of Islamic State (IS) reflects a history \nof poor nation-building as much as anything else. The international coalition against IS has so far been ineffective \nbut, in any case, cutting down IS without pulling up its roots would be nothing more than cosmetic surgery. IS is not \nreally a threat to Iraq's nationhood, rather a sign of its failure. The current hyper-sectarian conflict is not the cause, \nbut the symptom of the failed nation-state model.<nl/> The country is divided into three parts, each of which centres \naround strong identities \u2014 Kurdish, Sunni and Shia \u2014 which predate the modern borders. For each of these \ngroups, self-interest comes first.<nl/> The Kurds' loyalty is first and foremost to Kurdistan \u2014 and they see an \nopportunity in the current chaos to realise their long-term dream of a Kurdish state. In many aspects, the Kurdish \nregion is already independent, and given what they have gone through over the years spent resisting IS, it would be \ninconceivable to imagine them embracing the old system.<nl/> Southern Iraq, meanwhile, is effectively a country of \nits own. The majority of Shia live in the south with a very strong sense of Shia identity. The Shia political elite has \ndominated what is left of the Iraqi state and has shown little appetite for acknowledging the interests of other ethnic \nand religious groups \u2014 which would have been the only way to save Iraq. After all, in this hyper-sectarian climate \nbeing attentive to other minorities could have negative implications for a 'state' which is effectively dependent on \nShia militia for survival.<nl/> Many Sunni tribes, on the other hand, are stuck between the likes of IS or a Shia \nmajority government, which has a track record of discrimination against them. In the same week that there was an \nanti-IS coalition conference in Paris to try to save Iraq, 50 more Sunni tribes gave their allegiance to Abu Bakr al-\nBaghdadi because they feared the rise of Shia militia with links to Iran.<nl/> Face facts<nl/> So what could be the \nanswer? Democracy? Federalism? Iraq's hyper-sectarian politics would never allow a democratic system to flourish \nwithin either a federal or centrist system. Sectarianism destroys the roots of civic culture and undermines the \ndevelopment of any functioning civil society, which is the backbone of any democratic system.<nl/> As has been \nproven time and time again in Iraq, people vote to empower their sect, meaning the Sunni minority will be \nperpetually disadvantaged. This inevitably feeds the politics of victimisation and, in turn, leads to endless battles \nover the distribution of power between the haves and the have-nots.<nl/> Although there are uncertainties about \nthe result of this painful disintegration process, there is very little chance that an Iraqi nation state like that we knew \nbefore 2003 can ever be resurrected.<nl/> It's about time we faced facts: Iraq is dead.<nl/> * Director of the Centre \nfor the Study of Political Islam ...cturer in International Relations and Middle East Politics at University of \nBradford.<nl/><nl/> ISIS Transforming Into Functioning State That Uses Terror as Tool[171]<nl/> The Islamic State, \nalso known as ISIS, ISIL and Daesh, initially functioned solely as a terrorist organization, if one more coldblooded \neven than Al Qaeda. Then it went on to seize land. But increasingly, as it holds that territory and builds capacity to \ngovern, the group is transforming into a functioning state that uses extreme violence \u2014 terror \u2014 as a tool. That \ndistinction is proving to be more than a matter of perspective for those who live under the Islamic State, which has \nprovided relative stability in a region troubled by war and chaos while filling a vacuum left by failing and corrupt \ngovernments that also employed violence \u2014 arrest, torture and detention.<nl/><nl/> Nancy Menges ...is \nFleischman: Stop Ignoring Iran's Subversive Behavior[172]<nl/> As the deal with Iran is being scrutinized by the \nU.S. Congress, an opportunity opens up to discuss what has not been discussed during the negotiations.<nl/> \nDuring the negotiations over Iran's program the P 5 + 1 related to Iran as a tabula-rasa country seeking nuclear \nweapons. In this equation Iran's behavior and Iran's geo-political ambitions were left out even as the Islamic \nRepublic supported polarizing Shiite sectarianism in Iraq, the Assad regime in Syria and the Houthis in Yemen. This \n\n\n\ncaused major instability in Iraq and worked to depose an America-friendly government in Yemen. Iran's support for \nthe Syrian regime's viciousness strengthened the hand of ISIS. By displaying this behavior Iran helped reinforce the \npower of ISIS in the region and weakened the democratic forces operating in the Levant. Of course, this is without \neven mentioning the aid Iran provides to Hamas and Hezbollah, their traditional allies and proxies.<nl/> Dennis \nRoss, who served the Obama Administration in its first term and is not known for holding hawkish views, \nstated:<nl/> 'the release of 150 billion dollars in oil sales and frozen accounts to Iran within six months, even if Iran \n'uses 90 to 95 percent of that to meet domestic needs, it is inconceivable that the Revolutionary Guards won't \nreceive a payoff that they can use for aggressive purposes'.<nl/> Senior administration officials have argued that \nIran will use this money to give a boost to Iran's frail economy\u2026<nl/><nl/> Obama Calls for Release of Americans \nHeld in Iran, After Nuke Deal Omitted Them[173]<nl/> President Obama called Tuesday for the release of \nAmericans held in Iran, individually naming them during a speech at the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention \u2014 a \nweek after his diplomatic team helped strike a nuclear accord with Iran that did not secure the prisoners' \nfreedom.<nl/> The deal's failure to address the prisoners' status has fueled criticism of the Obama administration, \nthough State Department officials have said they raised their imprisonment repeatedly.

Indonesia 'was not born under the tyranny' of the majority, 'but based on the Constitution'.<nl/> Jakarta \n(AsiaNews) \u2014 Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama has come out strongly in favour of Ahmadi Muslims, an \nIslamic group considered heretical by majority Sunni Muslims because they do not view Muhammad as the final \nprophet.<nl/> Also known as Ahok, the capital's chief magistrate personally spoke on behalf of a local Ahmadi \ncommunity, after it became the victim of attacks by local Islamist extremist groups.<nl/> A Christian of Sino-\nIndonesian origin, he is one of the few Indonesian political leaders daring to fight for freedom of worship, a battle \nthat not even the current 'reformist' president Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, Ahok's former boss, seems intent on \npursuing.<nl/> In an official statement, Governor Purnama said that he 'would not submit' to pressure from any \nfundamentalist group. For him, this is nothing new. He had already come under fire from radical movements in the \npast, for being a Christian and for defending religious freedom and equal rights for all.<nl/> The latest incident took \nplace on 10 July, when an Islamic extremist group forced the closure of an Ahmadi mosque in Tebet district, South \nJakarta, disrupting Friday prayer with violence and threats.<nl/> Two days earlier, a district official had issued an \norder to halt religious services in the two-storey building because it lacked the required permits as a place of \nworship.<nl/> Speaking on the issue, Ahok said that he would on the legality of the Ahmadi faith, but that he plans \nto enforce the law and uphold the constitution in accordance with his role. Ahmadi believers have a right to pray and \nuse the building as a mosque based on existing rules.<nl/> For this reason, the governor signed a directive \nauthorising the re-opening of the place of worship. 'The State should not meddle in such issues [of faith],' he \nwarned.<nl/> 'I asked the head of the South Jakarta district the reasons for closing [the Ahmadi place of worship],' \nsaid the governor. 'I told him in no uncertain terms that hundreds, if not thousands of Muslim places of worship exist \nwithout a permit as required by the law, but no one dreams of shutting them down.'<nl/> For Jakarta's first citizen, \nIndonesia 'was not born under the tyranny' of the majority over the minority, 'but based on the Constitution.

Additionally the \nonly thing keeping the Obama administration from totally opening the southern border is a brave federal judge \nnamed Andrew Hanen, who has issued an injunction against Obama's executive orders to grant amnesty for scores \nof thousands of illegals living in the US. Of course the main purpose for attempting this bit of transformation is to \nshore up votes for Democrats.<nl/> Last week Obama visited a federal prison in Oklahoma, being the first sitting \nAmerican president to do so. Certainly his intentions for visiting were clearly signaled when he commuted the \nsentences of 46 felons prior to doing so. It's a clear signal that Obama further wants to 'transform' America, much in \nthe same way Castro did by opening Cuba's prison doors and sending the inmates to America, a la the Mariel \nboatlift of 1980.<nl/> Under the Constitution, Obama certainly has the power to commute or pardon prisoners and \nthe only question now is, how many are going to be let out of jail before January 20, 2017?<nl/> However, more \nimportantly, he also wants to grant voting rights to prisoners, a right that has long been suspended for felons on the \nbasis that if one is convicted of a felony, one loses the many rights enjoyed by non-felonious citizens.
