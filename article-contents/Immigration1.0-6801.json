{"title": "METRO NEWS BRIEFS: NEW YORK;Ruling Allows U.S. To Try Follower of Sheik", "body": "\nA Federal judge in Brooklyn refused yesterday to drop an indictment against an Egyptian man whose lawyer had \nclaimed that he was being unfairly prosecuted because of his political and religious associations.\n\nThe ruling, by Judge Carol B.  Amon of Federal District Court, clears the way for a trial of the man, Nasser K. \nAhmed, a follower of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the cleric convicted in 1995 in a conspiracy to blow up \nlandmarks in New York City.\n\nMr. Ahmed has been involved in a bitter three-year battle with the Immigration and Naturalization Service over its \nattempts to deport him based on classified information that the agency refuses to make public. In that case, which is \npending, Mr. Ahmed has been detained without bond for more than three years.\n\nA Federal grand jury indicted Mr. Ahmed in December on charges of making false statements in a decade-old \nimmigration matter; with yesterday's ruling, he now faces trial in June. The case involved an application from Mr. \nAhmed for residency status under a special program for farm workers.\n\nRoger L. Stavis, who is representing Mr. Ahmed in the false-statements case, said his client had been the victim of \nselective prosecution because of his links to Mr. Abdel Rahman.\n\nHerbert Hadad, a spokesman for Mary Jo White, the United States Attorney in Manhattan, said there would be no \ncomment on the ruling.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
