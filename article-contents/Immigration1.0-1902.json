{"title": "U.S. Backs Asylum for Mutilation Cases", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nPart of your May 3 news article on the asylum appeal of Fauziya Kasinga, who says she fled Togo to escape \ngenital mutilation, misrepresents the position of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n\nThe agency argued that the threat of such mutilation can be the basis for an asylum claim. The doctrine we \nadvocated, if adopted by the Board of Immigration Appeals, would extend the definition of persecution to include \ngenital mutilation of an unwilling woman.\n\nYou say that we would \"narrow the range of women who could qualify for asylum\" and that we seek protection for \nonly those who would be subjected to the most severe mutilation. We did not argue that women at risk of \"milder \nforms\" of the practice should not have protection, but we seek to insure that asylum is available only for those who \nreally need it. This means reserving protection for those at risk of forcible mutilation on return to their country.\n\nYou also make it sound as if I.N.S. seeks to defeat Ms. Kasinga's claim because we asked to have the case \nremanded to court. We supported many of the legal points she raised, but her claim was originally denied by the \nimmigration judge in part because he questioned her credibility.\n\nI.N.S. has taken the opportunity presented by this case to ask the board to establish that female genital mutilation \ncan be the basis for asylum.\n\n \n\nDAVID A.
