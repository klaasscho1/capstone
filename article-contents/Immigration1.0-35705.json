{"title": "AROUND THE NATION;Man Asks Military Trial Rather Than Extradition", "body": "\nA retired automobile worker whom Israel wants to extradite on charges of World War II crimes argued today that a \nmilitary court, not a Federal court, should try those charged with war crimes.\n\nThe man, John Demjanjuk, 64 years old, made the argument in a preliminary hearing before Federal District Judge \nFrank Battisti, who is considering the request for extradition.\n\nIsrael contends that Mr. Demjanjuk is the guard inmates at the Treblinka death camp in Poland called ''Ivan the \nTerrible.''\n\nMark O'Connor, Mr. Demjanjuk's lawyer, said only courts such as the one that judged Nazi war criminals at \nNuremberg, West Germany, had jurisdiction over suspected war criminals.\n\nJudge Battisti did not rule on the request to remove the case from the Federal courts.\n\nMr. Demjanjuk says he is not ''Ivan the Terrible,'' but a Ukrainian immigrant who never persecuted Jews.\n\nMr. Demjanjuk was stripped of his United States citizenship in a 1981 denaturalization trial for lying on his \nimmigration papers. An immigration judge found that he could be deported to the Soviet Union, but extradition \nwould take precedence over deportation.\n"}
