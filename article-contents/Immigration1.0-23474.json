TIME: 9:37 A.M. EST DATE: WEDNESDAY, MAY \n16, 2007\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  This hearing of the Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and \nInternational Law will come to order.\n\nI would like to welcome the Immigration Subcommittee members, our witnesses, and members of the public who \nare here today for the subcommittee's ninth hearing on comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nI would like to welcome the Immigration Subcommittee members.  We wanted to -- we started our series of \nhearings at Ellis Island, where we examined the need for comprehensive immigration reform to secure our \nborders, to address economic and demographic concerns, and we reviewed our nation's rich history.  We studied \nimmigration reform from 1986 and 1996 in an effort to avoid the mistakes of the past.\n\nWe've considered the problems with and proposed solutions for our current employment and worksite verification \nsystems.  In light of recent proposals by the White House to eliminate family priorities in immigration and replace it \nwith a completely new and untested point system, we studied the contributions of family immigrants to America and \nvarious immigration point systems used around the world.\n\n\nThe genius of America has always been our strength as a society. People from all over the world come to America \nto become Americans with us.  When a new citizen raises her hand to become an American at her citizenship \nceremony, she pledges her future to America, she promises to defend our country and our Constitution, and she \nimmediately inherits a grand history of her new country, from George Washington to today.\n\nToday some fear that America has lost its exceptional status and some contend that unlike immigrants from other \ngenerations, immigrants today are not assimilating fast enough or at all.  One clear and objective sign of \nassimilation is the process by which immigrants master the English language.  The census and various academic \nstudies and research show that immigrants and their descendants are learning English at a rate comparable to the \npast waves of immigrants. According to the 2005 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census \nBureau, 82 percent of immigrants 24 and older report that they speak English well or very well.  Younger \nimmigrants fare even better -- 95 percent of immigrants from 18 to 23 report speaking English well or very well.  By \nthe third generation, most grandchildren of immigrants can in fact speak only English, even in heavily Spanish- \nspeaking areas of the country such as Southern California.\n\nOur first witness, Professor Gerstle, explains that the Southern and Eastern Europeans who immigrated to the \nUnited States a century ago and are now held up as model immigrants were once depicted much as immigrants of \ntoday -- unable and unwilling to assimilate.  Yet, the professor explains, these European immigrants did well in \njoining American society.  He finds that these so-called new immigrants of then successfully integrated into the \nUnited States despite such hostility because of three factors:  the ability of immigrants to participate in American \ndemocracy, natural transition from immigrants to their children, ability of immigrants to achieve economic security.\n\nHe states that the ability of immigrants to participate in politics and to feel as though their votes made a difference \nwas crucial to their engagement with and integration into America.  He also notes that an immigrant population that \nfinds itself unable to move out of poverty or to gain confidence that it can provide a decent life for their children is far \nmore likely to descend into alienation than to embrace America.\n\nWhat we can learn from this historical account is that including immigrants in mainstream American society and the \neconomy is a quick way -- is the quickest way to assimilation and integration.  If creating new Americans is a goal \nof our immigration policy, then we should ensure that comprehensive immigration reform reflects that objective.\n\nPurely temporary worker programs with little opportunity for those who contribute to our economy to become full \nmembers of the country that they've helped to build run contrary to the goal of Americanism and assimilation \nbecause such programs relegate people to a life in a permanent underclass.  Furthermore, under purely temporary \nworker programs, there is little incentive and little time to learn English if after two or three years of full-time work in \nthe U.S. the only choice is returning home to a non-English-speaking country.\n\nAs we develop comprehensive immigration reform, we must not forget that mandating and facilitating the process \nfor immigrants to learn English is important but not sufficient in achieving the goal of assimilation and allowing new \nimmigrants to become Americans.  The opportunity to become fully participating members of our polity, our civic \nsociety and our economy is a key to, as Professor Gerstle so pointedly discussed in his written testimony, allowing \nnew immigrants to become our new Americans.\n\nI would now recognize the ranking member for his opening statement.\n\nREP. STEVE KING (R-IA):  Thank you, Madame Chair.\n\nAs I expressed to the witnesses this morning, I appreciate you being here and committing your time to the \nknowledge base of this Congress, this panel, and the American people.\n\nHowever nothing in these hearings will replace hearings on actual legislation when we can actually examine the \nlanguage and have input on the impact of that language on the American life with that policy that might come from \nspecific language.\n\n\n\nBut facing us on the back wall of this hearing room we're looking at our national seal.  And on the seal is our \nnation's motto:  \"E pluribus unum.\"  And that means, of course, \"Out of many, one.\"  This motto was proposed by a \ncommittee appointed by Congress on July 4th, 1776, and on that committee were John Adams, Ben Franklin and \nThomas Jefferson.  Lest there be any doubt about what meaning was intended by our founders in choosing that \nphrase -- E pluribus unum -- I point out that the design they proposed for the seal was not the eagle originally, as \nyou see today, but rather a shield containing the six symbols for, and I'll quote, \"the countries from which these \nstates have been peopled.\n\n\"\n\nThe patriotic assimilation of new immigrants has been a primary objective of our immigration policy since our \nnation's birth. Washington recommended that assimilation into the mainstream of American life and values be \nencouraged so that immigrants and native- born Americans would soon become one people.  Only within the last \ngeneration or so have the terms assimilation and Americanization given away to cultural pluralism and \nmulticulturalism.\n\nThe title of this hearing uses the word integration, a term that's defined in the American Heritage Dictionary as, \"the \nbringing of people of different racial or ethnic groups into an unrestricted and equal association, as in a society or \norganization.\"  Or alternatively, mostly we understand it to mean desegregation.\n\nThat term, however, does not capture the spirit of Americans.  In a public speech after the publication of the 1995 \nreport by the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, Barbara Jordan declared that:  \"The term Americanization \nearned a bad reputation when it was stolen by racist xenophobes in the '20s.  But it's our word, and we are taking it \nback,\" according to Barbara Jordan.  She explained, and I quote: \"When using the term Americanization, the \ncommission means the cultivation of a shared commitment to the American values of liberty, democracy and equal \nopportunity, something that is possible regardless of the nationality or religious background of immigrants and their \nchildren.  We view Americanization positively as the inclusion of all who wish to embrace the civic culture which \nholds our nation together,\" closed quote.\n\nI agree with her on this policy.  We need to refocus our priorities on helping those who are here legally now and \nhelp them embrace our new country by emphasizing the rapid learning of our common language of English, by \ninstilling core American values, the ideals of our constitutional republic, and by ensuring that immigrants' loyalty to \nAmerica and not to the country from which they came is achieved.\n\nThere are tens of thousands of people marching -- who have marched in the streets of America under thousands of \nflags of foreign countries, chanting for another nation -- doesn't give me confidence that we have established the \nAmericanization or the assimilation that we need to hold this country together under one cultural foundation. Teddy \nRoosevelt spoke to it powerfully in a number of his writings and statements.\n\nBut I would just skip forward and say that on a different subject, the minority requested a hearing for last week \nbecause we were denied the opportunity to present a witness of our choice from the previous week.  What \ntranspired was the use of the hearing process to demean the efforts of Mr. Willard Fair, one of our volunteer \nwitnesses as well.   He's the president and the CEO of the Urban League of Greater Miami and he's worked for 40 \nyears to help the lives of African-Americans and increase their employment.  He was not allowed to answer or \nrespond to the questions that were peppered at him, and I believe that we need to treat you all with a level of \nrespect and deference, and I insist that we do so.  But when I asked for unanimous consent for Mr. Fair to respond \nto those questions, there was an objection and that's something that I hope does not happen again with any of the \nwitnesses.  I want to hear from you myself.\n\nAnd so with that, I would say also that there was a rebuttal to the Rector study, and I hope that we can have a panel \nhere to allow Mr. Rector to be able to face his accusers.  I read the rebuttal.  I didn't find any facts in that rebuttal.  \nBut what I do have here is a request for a minority hearing, Madame Chair, and I'd ask unanimous consent that the \nletter be introduced into the record, and hopefully we can move forward with the proper edification of this panel and \nthe people of this country as they observe our process here.\n\n\n\nThis is a very pivotal issue that is before us in this Congress. There is no putting the toothpaste back in the tube.  \nWe had better get it right.  We can learn from history.  We can learn from facts. And as the chair stated last week, \nwe are entitled to our own opinions.  We are not entitled to our own facts.  The facts are in the Rector study.  They \ndo not include national interest or national defense in his conclusions.  They are only there that you can draw your \nown calculation if you choose, but not in Rector's conclusions. I look forward to hearing from him, and hopefully we \ncan have that kind of a hearing in the future.\n\nThank you, Madame Chair, and I'd yield back.\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  Without objection, the letter will be made a part of the record and dealt with according to the \nrules.\n\nI would now recognize the chairman of the full committee, Mr. John Conyers, for his statement.\n\nREP. JOHN CONYERS JR. (D-MI):  Thank you and good morning, Madame Chairperson, and members of the \ncommittee and our very important witnesses here.\n\nThis to me -- and I congratulate you, Ms. Lofgren -- is a philosophical inquiry that we're making today.  Are new \nimmigrant groups any different from old immigrant groups?  That's a great subject to kick around on a Wednesday \nmorning.\n\nAnd I remember -- I'm so happy to hear the ranking subcommittee member, Steve King, tell me that we need to \nrefocus our energies on those who are doing their best to make it here because that means he's come a little \ndistance from an assertion that I remember him making, that we've gotten so messed up in the immigration issue \nthat even legal immigration is unworkable.  And I'm happy to know that that is a direction that he's moving in.\n\nNow, are the new wave of immigrants different from the ones that came from Germany in 1751 or Ireland in 1856 or \nfrom China in 1882 or from Italy in 1896 or from Mexico in 1956, and now, of course, the Latino groups completely, \nfrom Latin America?  And what I'm thinking is that this discussion becomes critical in our understanding of what our \njob is about reform -- major reform of the immigration law -- because it's very easy to get caught in a time warp.  \nThat is to say that we're looking at now and good night; this is different, Conyers. Don't you get it?  This isn't the \n18th century or the 19th century or the 20th century.  This is different.  And if you don't understand that, we're not \ngoing to be able to get anywhere.\n\nAnd so this discussion amongst us and with our witnesses becomes important because it attempts to pull another \nlayer off the onion that gets us to the importance of what it is we're going to do legislatively.  We've been given \nanother week by the Senate.  I think that's critical.  I was very nervous when I came in to ask what finally happened \nlate last night.  But it just occurred to me that the first person killed in Iraq was Lance Corporal Jose Antonio \nGutierrez -- an illegal immigrant, if you please, who was undocumented.  Our country gave him a chance, a home, a \ncareer in the military, and he was just one of millions who've embraced America's promise of freedom and \nopportunity.\n\nAnd so yes, I say, time and time again, we've worried about whether some people can assimilate satisfactorily into \nthis so-called American melting pot.  And time and time again, these fears have proven to be completely \nunfounded.\n\nSo I look forward to all of the witnesses, including the minority's witness as well, to join us in this discussion this \nmorning.  And I thank you for this opportunity.\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  Thank you, Mr. Conyers.\n\nNoting that we have witnesses to hear from, without objection all members of the committee are invited to submit \ntheir statements for the record.\n\nWithout objection, the chair is authorized to declare a recess of the hearing at any time.\n\n\n\nWe have a distinguished panel of witnesses here today to help us consider the important issues before us.\n\nI would like to extend a warm welcome to Dr. Gary Gerstle, a professor of history at Vanderbilt University.  Dr. \nGerstle's research is focused on the nexus between immigration, race, and nationhood. His co-authored college \ntextbook, \"Liberty, Equality, Power:  A History of the American People,\" will soon enter its fifth edition. He comes to \nVanderbilt after teaching at the University of Maryland, the University of Pennsylvania, and the School for Advanced \nStudies in the Social Sciences in Paris.\n\nIn addition to his teaching and research responsibilities, he serves on the editorial board of the Journal of American \nHistory.  He earned his doctorate degree in history from Harvard University.\n\nWe will next hear from Dr. Ruben G. Rumbaut, professor of sociology at the University of California -- my home \nstate -- at Irvine.  A native of Havana, Cuba, Dr. Rumbaut has conducted world- renowned research on \nimmigration, including his current work on the landmark Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study, which began in \n1991, and the large-scale study of Immigration and Intergenerational Mobility in Metropolitan Los Angeles.  He \nwas a fellow at the Center of Advanced Study in the behavioral sciences at Stanford -- my alma mater -- and the \nfounding chair of the Section on International Migration of the American Sociological Association, and a member of \nthe committee on population in the National Academy of Sciences.  He received his bachelor's degree from \nWashington University in St. Louis, a master's degree from San Diego State University, and a master's and doctoral \ndegree from Brandeis University.\n\nI'm pleased to next welcome Donald Kerwin, the executive director of the Catholic League (sic/Legal) Immigration \nNetwork, Inc., or CLINIC, since 1993.  CLINIC, a public interest legal corporation and a subsidiary of the United \nStates Conference of Catholic Bishops, supports a national network of 161 charitable legal programs for immigrants \nfrom more than 260 locations across the nation.  Prior to his work at CLINIC, Mr. Kerwin practiced law as an \nassociate with the Washington law firm of Patton Boggs.  He serves as an adviser to the Conference of Catholic \nBishops Committee on Migration, a member of the American Bar Association's Commission on Immigration, and a \nfellow at the Migration Policy Institute.  He earned his bachelor's degree from Georgetown University and his law \ndegree from the University of Michigan Law School.\n\nFinally, we're pleased to welcome the minority's witness, Dr. John Fonte, the director of the Center for American \nCommon Culture and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute here in Washington.  In addition to his work at the \nHudson Institute, Dr. Fonte has worked as a senior researcher at the U.S. Department of Education and a program \nadministrator at the National Endowment for the Humanities.  He holds a bachelor's and master's degree from the \nUniversity of Arizona and his Ph.D. in world history from the University of Chicago.\n\nEach of you has written statements which I have read with great interest, and they will all be made part of the \nrecord in their entirety.\n\nI would ask that each of you summarize your testimony in five minutes or less.  And to stay within that time, you can \nsee that there's a little machine on the desk.  When the light turns yellow, it means that you have one minute, and \nwhen it turns red -- this always surprises witnesses because the time flies -- it means that five minutes are actually \nup, and we would ask that you summarize your last sentence so that we can hear from all the witnesses and then \nalso get to questions.\n\nSo if we would begin, Dr. Gerstle?\n\nMR. GERSTLE:  (Off mike.)\n\nREP. CONYERS:  Turn on your mike, please.\n\nMR. GERSTLE:  I wish to thank you for the invitation to appear before your committee today.\n\nSince its founding, the United States has arguably integrated more immigrants -- both in absolute and relative terms \n-- than any other nation.  In the years between the 1820s and 1920s, an estimated 35 million immigrants came to \n\n\n\nthe United States.  Approximately 40 to 50 million more came between the 1920s and the 2010s, with most of those \ncoming after 1965.\n\nThe immigrants who came in the first wave are thought to have been enormously successful in integrating \nthemselves into American society.  We are here today because many Americans doubt the ability or willingness of \nthe immigrants of the second wave -- especially those who have come since 1965 -- to replicate the success of that \nearlier wave.\n\nI am here to offer you the benefit of my historical knowledge regarding these earlier immigrants and to draw \nconclusions about what their experience means for today's immigrants.  My main points are as follows.\n\nFirst, that the integration process of earlier immigrants, especially the 20-plus million who came from Eastern and \nSouthern Europe in the years from 1880 to 1920 has been mythologized as quick, easy and unproblematic.  In fact, \nthese immigrants were widely regarded then, as many immigrants are regarded today, as radically different in \nculture and values from Americans and as lacking the desire and ability to integrate themselves into American \nsociety. Their integration would ultimately be an outstanding success, but it took about 50 years.  It required a \ngenerational transition in these immigrant communities and engagement on the part of these immigrants with \nAmerican democracy, and an opportunity for them to achieve economic security for themselves and their families.\n\nPoint two:  Are there too many immigrants present in American society today even to contemplate a successful \ncampaign to integrate them all?  My answer to that is no.  Immigrant density was greater 100 years ago than it is \ntoday.  Twenty-four million came into a society in 1900 that numbered only 76 million people.  To match that \nimmigrant density today, we would have to admit four times as many immigrants a year and sustain that for a \ndecade.\n\nThird point:  There is greater diversity culturally and economically among today's immigrants than those who came \n100 years ago.  However, for the majority of today's immigrants who are poor and non-white, the distance of their \nvalues and cultural traditions for mainstream America is no greater than what separated native-born Americans and \nimmigrants 100 years ago.  That we integrated the last wave should give us confidence that we can integrate this \nwave too.\n\nFourth point:  That confidence must be grounded in a realistic and robust sense of what successful immigrant \nincorporation requires. Immigrant incorporation requires two generations in time and a generational transition within \nimmigrant families and communities during that time so that the power of the first generation recedes and the power \nof the second generation comes to the fore.  Successful immigrant integration also requires immigrant engagement \nwith American democracy, becoming citizens and active participants in American politics.  And it also requires the \nachievement of economic security.\n\nThe institutions that were once so important in the early 20th century in bringing immigrants into politics and aiding \ntheir quest for economic security, political parties, and the labor movement, are no longer as well-positioned to \ncontinue performing that role.  Either these institutions must find ways to broaden their involvement with immigrants, \nor other institutions, such as the Catholic Church, must step forward to take their place.\n\nFifth point, and my final point:  Engaging immigrants in American democracy and broadening the access of the \nimmigrant poor to economic opportunity and security will in the short term yield as much contention as it will yield \ncomity.  But if done right, it will work to bind together the foreign-born and immigrant-born into one American nation \nand demonstrate, yet again, the remarkable ability of America to take in people from very different parts of the \nworld, to make them into Americans, and, in the process, to reinvigorate the power of American ideals and the \npromise of American life for all who have had the good fortune to make themselves a home on U.S. soil.  We \nshould try to make this happen again.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  Thank you very much, Doctor.\n\n\n\nDr. Rumbaut?\n\nMR. RUMBAUT:  Chairwoman Lofgren, Chairman Conyers, Ranking Member King, and members of the Judiciary \nCommittee and the Immigration Subcommittee, thank you very much for the opportunity to appear at this hearing.\n\nI could never have imagined when I arrived in this country on the eve of my 12th birthday, speaking no English at \nall, that one day 46 years later I'd be speaking to a congressional committee -- in English -- about the fate of \nimmigrant languages in the U.S. and of immigrants' acquisition of English.\n\nBut life, like history, is full of surprises and often unfolds like a telenovela in a Spanish-language TV channel in L.A.\n\nI used that metaphor deliberately because two summers ago in the Nielsen ratings of the 10 most watched TV \nprograms in the huge television market of greater Los Angeles -- where I live and work -- nine of the top 10 \nprimetime programs were telenovelas, broadcast in Spanish by KMEX, the Univision channel.  It was -- (in Spanish) \n-- Tuesday -- (in Spanish) -- Wednesday -- (in Spanish) -- Monday -- (in Spanish) -- Tuesday -- (in Spanish) -- and \nnumber nine was \"CSI\" -- and then -- (in Spanish) -- Friday, which, you know, came in last.\n\nSuch anecdotes would seem to support the concerns that have been expressed by some that immigrant integration \ntoday -- and especially their linguistic assimilation in areas of geographic concentration -- is being slowed or even \nreversed to the point of threatening the predominance of English in the United States, above all, among Spanish-\nspeaking Latin Americans, most notably Mexicans in Southern California and Cubans in south Florida.\n\nHowever, as the evidence from the census itself, from the American Community survey that was just cited by \nChairwoman Lofgren, and from every major national and regional study shows, compellingly and incontrovertibly -- \nincluding cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys carried out in Los Angeles and San Diego and Miami -- the \nprocess of linguistic assimilation to English today is occurring perhaps more quickly than ever in U.S. history.  I \nhave summarized that evidence in detail in my written statement, including an analysis of the determinates of \nEnglish fluency, et cetera, so I need not repeat it here except to highlight a few main points.\n\nFirst, the evidence documents a pattern of very rapid language transition from the first to the second and third \ngenerations, a switch to English that is completed before the third generation for most immigrant groups, and by or \nbefore the third generation even for those of Mexican origin in Los Angeles and of Cuban origin in Miami. The \npower of assimilative forces is nowhere clearer than in the linguistic switch across the generations.\n\nBut in addition to that, secondly, longitudinal studies such as our own Children of Immigrants' Longitudinal Study -- \nwhich have followed a large sample of children of immigrants representing 77 different nationalities for more than \n10 years in San Diego and Miami -- have documented the extraordinarily rapid switch to English in degrees of \nproficiency, preference and use for all groups.  Tables 6 and 7 in my written statement has specific information in \nthat regard. But just to give you a taste of it, by earlier adulthood, by their mid-20s, over 93 percent of the Mexicans \nin San Diego and 98 percent of the Cubans in Miami preferred English over Spanish, and for some of the other \ngroups it was 100 percent.\n\nAnd third, we carried out an analysis of what we call linguistic life expectancies for all the main immigrant groups \nconcentrated in Southern California from San Diego and the Mexican border to Los Angeles, and demonstrated the \ngenerational point at which language death occurs.  Even for Mexican Spanish in Los Angeles -- one of the largest \nSpanish-speaking cities in the world -- where the adult immigrant parents may be watching -- (in Spanish) -- on TV \nin one room but their kids are watching \"CSI\" and \"American Idol\" in the room next door in English; indeed, their \nparents may talk to them in Spanish, but they will answer back in English.\n\nAdditional point:  English proficiency has always been a key to socioeconomic mobility for immigrants and to their \nfull participation in their adopted society.  The last person you need to tell that to is an immigrant, who came to the \nUnited States precisely with that in mind.  Today is no different in that respect.  In fact, the United States has been \ndescribed as a language graveyard because of its historical ability to absorb millions of immigrants, as Professor \n\n\n\nGerstle mentioned, and to extinguish their mother tongues within a few generations.  And Spanish appears to offer \nno threat to this reputation, unfortunately.\n\nEnglish has never been seriously threatened as the dominant language of the United States, and with nearly a \nquarter billion English monolinguals in the United States today, it is certainly not threatened today, not even in \nSouthern California.  For that matter, English has become firmly established throughout the world as the premier \ninternational language of commerce, diplomacy, education, journalism, technology, the Internet and mass culture.\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  Dr. Rumbaut, your light is on.  If you could wrap up, that would be --\n\nMR. RUMBAUT:  What is endangered instead is the survivability of the non-English languages that immigrants \nbring with them to the United States, and whether that loss of such assets is desirable or not is, of course, another \nmatter.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  Thank you very much.\n\nMr. Kerwin?\n\nMR. KERWIN:  Madame Chairwoman, Chairman Conyers, distinguished members of the subcommittee, I \nappreciate the opportunity to testify before you today on the importance of citizenship in immigrant integration.\n\nThere are more than 11 million lawful permanent residents in the United States who are eligible or who will soon be \neligible to apply for citizenship.  As you know, citizenship confers important rights and responsibilities.  It is a \nprecondition to full membership in our society.\n\nIn our experience the naturalization process is also a focal point for a range of integration activities.  These include \nEnglish classes, citizenship classes, homeownership seminars, and provision of public health information.\n\nEarlier this year my agency released a report titled, \"A More Perfect Union:  A National Citizenship Plan.\"  The \nreport is based on more than 100 interviews and the best thinking of an advisory group of 22 experts on this issue.\n\nIt details the resources, partnerships and commitments that would be necessary to achieve the following goals.\n\nFirst:  to create a federally lead citizenship initiative that could play a central role in what we hope will be an \nemerging national immigrant integration policy.\n\nSecond:  to increase naturalization numbers and rates so that more immigrants can contribute fully to our nation.\n\nThird:  to make the naturalization process more meaningful by deepening the knowledge and commitment of \nimmigrants to our nation's history, political institutions and democratic ideals.\n\nFourth:  to increase opportunities for citizenship by expanding English as a second language and citizenship \ninstruction.\n\nFifth:  to address barriers to citizenship like proposed fee increases and security clearances that can drag on for \nthree or four years.\n\nSixth:  to build stronger bonds between the native-born and naturalized.\n\nAnd seventh:  to forge strong public-private partnerships in support of all of these goals.\n\nOur plan details how a wide range of stakeholders, faith communities, federal, state and local government, \nbusiness, labor, civic organizations and others can promote citizenship.\n\n\n\nWhile it includes hundreds of recommendations, I have included just 13 key proposals in my written testimony.  For \nexample, we propose that charitable agencies expand their citizenship services, particularly by offering more group \nnaturalization processing sessions.\n\nMy agency now funds and supports naturalization sessions in 21 communities, a number that we hope to increase, \nsome of those communities represented by you.\n\nMany other networks like the New American Initiative in Illinois have also mobilized to do this work.  These sessions \nat modest cost allow large numbers of immigrants to apply to naturalize.  They also help to prepare charitable \nagencies for the maximum amount of work they will need to assume if comprehensive immigration reform \nlegislation is to pass and be successful.\n\nWe also recommend that the Office of Citizenship be funded sufficiently so that it can coordinate a national \ncitizenship program and can support the work of community-based organizations.  Federal leadership and \ncoordination will be essential to a national citizenship drive.  The Office of Citizenship, which has a $3 million \nbudget and does not currently have grant-making authority, needs to be strengthened if it is to play this role.\n\nWe support increased funding for ESL and citizenship classes. Lack of proficiency in English and the shortage of \nsuch classes represent a major barrier to citizenship.  In addition, federally funded ESL classes do not typically \ncover civics or citizenship issues.\n\nWe also support the efforts of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to develop a more meaningful citizenship \ntest.  And we particularly support more meaningful preparation for this test.  Of course, we also hope that the \nrevised test does not preclude worthy immigrants from taking this important step.\n\nWhile immigration is a volatile issue, we have found broad and deep support for citizenship.  We worry that the \nnational debate over how many and what types of immigrants to accept may overshadow the many contributions \nthat immigrants make to our nation.\n\nWe also worry that this debate may obscure our need to promote immigrant integration and attachment to our \nnation's core principles. We believe that a national citizenship plan would represent a step in the right direction and \nwe pledge our gifts and resources to this important goal.\n\nWe thank you for taking on this issue.\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  Thank you Mr. Kerwin.\n\nAnd now Dr. Fonte.\n\nMR. FONTE:  Thank you, Chairwoman Lofgren, and Ranking Member King.\n\nWhat do we mean by integration?  Let's start by using a more vigorous term, assimilation.  There are different \ntypes of assimilation:  linguistic, economic, civic, patriotic.\n\nLinguistic assimilation means the immigrant learns English. Economic assimilation means the immigrant does \nwell materially.  Civic integration means the immigrant is integrated into our political system, votes and has some \ninvolvement in civic affairs.\n\nThese forms of assimilation are necessary but not sufficient.  We are reminded again in the Fort Dix conspiracy \nthat there are naturalized citizens, permanent residents and illegal immigrants living in our country who speak \nEnglish, are gainfully employed and would like to kill as many Americans as possible.\n\nThe type of assimilation that matters most is patriotic assimilation, political loyalty and emotional attachment to \nthe United States.  This was accomplished in the days of Ellis Island because America's leaders, including \n\n\n\nDemocrat Woodrow Wilson and Republican Theodore Roosevelt, believed that immigrants should be \nAmericanized.\n\nThey were self-confident leaders.  They didn't use weasel words like integration; they talked openly about \nAmericanization.  July 4th, 1915, President Woodrow Wilson declared National Americanization Day. The president \nand his Cabinet addressed naturalization ceremonies around the nation.\n\nThe most powerful speech was delivered by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, in which Brandeis declared, \n\"Americanization meant that the newcomer should possess the national consciousness of an American.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, the late congresswoman, Barbara Jordan, called for revival of Americanization and a new \nAmericanization movement.\n\nYesterday I was at a conference where Henry Cisneros said, \"The best term is Americanization.\"\n\nUnfortunately, for decades we have implemented anti- Americanization policies:  multilingual ballots, bilingual \neducation, and Executive Order 13166; this hurts assimilation.\n\nTraditionally the greatest indication of assimilation is intermarriage between immigrants and the native-born.  A \nmajor new study published in the American Sociological Review found a big decline in interethnic marriage.  The \nauthor declared, quote, \"These declines are a significant departure from past trends\" and \"reflect the growth in \nimmigrant population\" in which Latinos are marrying Latinos, Asians are marrying Latinos -- in the past reversed.  \nSo the '70s, the '80s, the '90s reversed.\n\nThe Pew Hispanic Survey found that a seven months after 9/11 only 34 percent of American citizens of Latino origin \nconsider their primary identification of Americans -- as American first.  On the other hand, 42 percent identify with \ntheir parents' country, Mexico and El Salvador, so on; 24 percent ethnic identity first.\n\nProfessor Rumbaut's excellent work on the children of immigrants show that after four years of American high \nschool, self- identification with hyphenated Americans went down, identification with parents in birth country went \nup.\n\nAn article in the Chicago Tribune, Friday April 6th, by the person in charge of the New Americans office is I think \nvery revealing.  The state official declared, quote:  \"The nation-state concept is changing.  You don't have to say, \n'I'm Mexican', 'I'm American'; you can be a good Mexican citizen and a good American citizen and it's not a conflict \nof interest.   Sovereignty is flexible.\"\n\nWell, a very different view was given by the president of the United States 100 years ago in 1907.  The president \nsaid -- Theodore Roosevelt:  \"If the immigrant comes here in good faith, assimilates himself to us, he shall be \ntreated on exact equality with everyone else. But this is predicated upon that person becoming an American and \nnothing but an American.  There can be no divided allegiance here.  We have room but for one loyalty and that is \nloyalty to the American people.\"\n\nSo we're presented with two very different views of the oath of allegiance and what this means -- in the Chicago \nTribune article of 2007 and Theodore Roosevelt in 1907.  We'll have to choose.\n\nWhat shall we do today?  Well, it makes no sense to enact comprehensive immigration reform which means a \nslow-motion amnesty, a massive increase in low-skilled immigration further exacerbating our assimilation \nproblems.\n\nWhat we need first is comprehensive assimilation reform for those immigrants who are here legally.\n\nOne, first we should dismantle the anti-assimilation regime of foreign language ballots, voting in foreign countries \nby dual nationals, bilingual education and Executive Order 13166.\n\n\n\nSecond, we should follow Barbara Jordan and Henry Cisneros' lead and call for Americanization not integration.\n\nThird, we should enforce the oath of allegiance.\n\nI had six or seven others; they are in the written statement.  I can take questions on that.\n\nWe need comprehensive assimilation reform first.  Comprehensive immigration reform is not comprehensive; \nthat's the problem.  It's basically not comprehensive; it doesn't deal with assimilation.\n\nComprehensive immigration reform is primarily about the special interest needs of particular businesses, not the \ninterests of the American people as a whole.  It ignores assimilation and puts the market over the nation.  But \nAmericans must remember:  We are a nation of citizens before we are a market of consumers.\n\nThank you.\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  Thank you, Dr. Fonte.\n\nWe will now begin questioning by members of the committee and I will start off.  We have just five minutes apiece.\n\nI would like to ask Dr. Rumbaut -- Dr. Fonte just mentioned you and a study that you did about the affiliation of \nteenagers and their loyalty to the United States.  Have you done any additional longitudinal studies on that subject?\n\nMR. RUMBAUT:  Yes.  Dr. Fonte was referring to data from the second wave of interviews from our CILS study \nwhich were published in a book called \"Legacies\" that he was referring to.  We have continued to follow that sample \nof thousands of young people into their mid-'20s and we have continued to ask questions about language, about \nidentity, about some of the issues that he's been talking about.\n\nI would make a couple of comments in response to that.  First, when you ask young people when they're 17, 18 \nyears old what their identity is and they're in high school and so on, their sense of self, their self-definitions, their \nidentities and so on reflect the context of an adolescent culture in high school, their peers and so on.\n\nIn the United States, that is heavily weighted to racial notions of racial identities which are made in the USA.  A lot \nof kids are using their national origin of their parents as a response to what their racial identity is and they're not \ntalking really about national identity or patriotic identities, but how they fit in the particular subculture of the high \nschool where they happen to be at.\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  Would that change after graduation?\n\nMR. RUMBAUT:  It changes.  By their mid-'20s we saw a complete reversal back to patterns that have been seen \nat the (time-one ?) baseline survey; so that dissipates.  Second, some of the most striking responses to a national \nidentity that we observed in 1995, which is when Dr. Fonte was referring to, was among Mexicans in Southern \nCalifornia.\n\nWe went into the field immediately after the passage of Prop 187 in California and it was in reaction to that, what we \ncall \"reactive ethnicity,\" that an assertion of a national identity as Mexican was made even by U.S.-born Mexican-\nAmericans because of perceived discrimination and prejudice against their nationality as a whole; that, again, \ndissipates.\n\nWhen we asked the same questions to Mexicans in Florida at the same time that Prop 187 was passed in \nCalifornia, we saw an assimilative pattern among Mexicans in Florida, but we didn't see that among those that were \nresponding to conditions of discrimination and prejudice.\n\nSo a lot of what this debate about identities is concerned -- entails is a response to what the larger conflicts in which \nthey are assimilating is composed of.  Assimilation has never been about simply individual acculturation on the \npart of an immigrant; it has always entailed an absence of prejudice and discrimination on the parts of the whole \nsociety.  It takes two to assimilate.  It takes two to tango.\n\n\n\nIt was Robert Park 100 years ago, one of the leading sociologists of assimilation in the country, at the University of \nChicago at the time, who said that the most acculturated American at the time was the American Negro.  He said, \n\"The American Negro is an English-only- speaking Protestant,\" and yet he was the least assimilated in this society \n--\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  Because of discrimination.\n\nMR. RUMBAUT:  -- not because of a lack of acculturation, but because of the caste restrictions that were imposed \non him by the whole society.\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  Let me ask -- I found your study on language absolutely fascinating because it matches so much \nwhat I find at home where my colleagues who are second generation are pulling their hair out because their kids \nare monolingual English and cannot speak to their grandparents.\n\nAnd you really identify the death of foreign languages in the United States -- which I think adds some other issues, \nbut it would be nice if we had more people who could speak another language.  But do you see any chance that \nEnglish will stop being the common language of the United States from your studies?\n\nMR. RUMBAUT:  Absolutely not.  In fact, you talk about what you see at home -- my wife, who is of Mexican origin, \nand I have been trying to raise a bilingual child.  If there is anyone committed to bilingualism in the United States \nand sees the benefits of it it is me.  It was my wife and I against Michigan and that -- now we moved to Southern \nCalifornia and we thought he'd be in a context where his bilingualism would -- we talk to him in Spanish and he \nanswers only in English.\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  Right.  My time is almost up.\n\nI'd like to ask Dr. Gerstle:  Is there a preset number where America should say we can't accept anymore immigrants \nbecause they would not become American because there's too many of them, in your judgment?\n\nMR. GERSTLE:  I don't think there is a preset number.   I made the point in my statement today and in the longer \nstatement that immigration density was far greater a hundred years ago than it is today.\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  My time has expired.  I'm going to try and be good about that.\n\nMr. King.\n\nREP. KING:  Thank you, Madame Chair.\n\nFirst I'd note that although when the process kicked off some time Wednesday afternoon, by the time the testimony \nreached me, the chickens had gone to roost so I didn't have an opportunity read thoroughly through all the \ntestimony.  I have scanned most of it.\n\nDr. Rumbaut, I understand that you have a lot of material here and I appreciate that input, and hopefully I can \nreview it after this hearing.\n\nI'd like to turn first to Dr. Gerstle and your statement about the numbers of immigrants and the percentage and the \nconcentration. If I recall -- and I do -- the U.S. Census reports, the first ones we got on immigration were in 1820 \nand you go to that year yourself when you tabulate those numbers.\n\nAnd I've gone back to those PDF files and reviewed and they're a little hard to see, but they're on the computer and \nyou can find them on the Internet.  And totaled, those numbers from 1820 until the year 2000, which would be our \nlast census -- and they are -- according to the U.S. Census Bureau, we have 66.1 million immigrants.  And that \nnumber -- that doesn't match up with the numbers in your testimony. Can you explain that discrepancy?\n\n\n\nMR. GERSTLE:  Well, the -- calculating the total number of immigrants who have come to this country turns out to \nbe rather difficult because one has to account not only for those who came and stayed but for the very significant \nnumbers who came and went home. So I think --\n\nREP. KING:  Where do your numbers come from now, please?\n\nMR. GERSTLE:  They are -- they come from the census materials.\n\nREP. KING:  Then why don't we match?\n\nMR. GERSTLE:  Well, because there are instances in the past and where those who have come have sometimes \ngone home, and sometimes those who came have also gone unrecorded and have been undocumented.\n\nREP. KING:  Do you use some other information to add to that number?  Because when I look at those numbers \nthey're finite numbers.\n\nSo I don't see any latitude there to expand that number or subtract from --\n\nMR. GERSTLE:  I can get those -- I don't have those -- I don't have that data with me today.  I can get those for \nyou.\n\nREP. KING:  I'd appreciate it if you would for the benefit of this committee.  And then I look at today; we're 11 \npercent immigrants and that includes 35 million, 12 million of which are counted as illegal, and a lot of us believe \nthat number is greater.  That takes us up to 11 percent.  And if you go to the high-water mark, the immigrant \nnumber concentration of the population is 14 percent roughly a century ago.  So I'm having trouble understanding \nthe statement that we'd have to multiply our current immigration number by a factor of four to meet the \nconcentration level at the high-water mark.\n\nMR. GERSTLE:  Well, the -- I was referring to those who are coming in annually at the height of that immigration \nperiod where the numbers approached or exceeded a million a year.\n\nAnd a few years ago the numbers coming into the United States were calculated to have reached that level, and \nthat was advertised at the time as being the all-time high.  My point there is those million a year coming into the \nUnited States now are coming into a society of approximately 300 million people.\n\nREP. KING:  That would be the legal ones.\n\nMR. GERSTLE:  Yes.  Whereas those coming in --\n\nREP. KING:  Excuse me, Dr. Gerstle.  I do have to measure my time a little bit, but I appreciate your testimony and \nyour answers.\n\nI'd like to turn, if I could, to Mr. Kerwin.\n\nIn your testimony, your statement here that there is a real concentrated interest in naturalization, and if I look at the \nnaturalization numbers -- I go back to 1970 -- of those -- and according to the USCIS, they show that immigrants \nwho are admitted prior to 1970 naturalized at a rate of 82 percent; those from 1970 to'79 naturalized at a rate of 66 \npercent, and from '80 to '89, 45 percent.  You see the trend.  From 1900 to the year 2000 it fell to 13 percent.\n\nSo how can -- how come -- how can the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services have a number that shows a \ndramatic decline over a period of 30 years from 82 percent to 13 percent -- how can that comport with your \nstatement that there is an interest in naturalization?\n\nMR. KERWIN:  Well, as I understand it, the most recent study by Pew Hispanic Center shows that there's actually \nbeen an increase in naturalization among lawful immigrants -- legal, permanent residents.\n\n\n\nREP. KING:  You'll allow there's a lot of room for improvement?\n\nMR. KERWIN:  Oh, absolutely.  And that's the point of our study. And what we'd like to do is we'd like to take the \nentities that were involved and key in integrating immigrants in the past and get them together -- the federal \ngovernment, churches, charitable agencies, civic associations.\n\nREP. KING:  Let me say, if might, Mr. Kerwin, you make a lot of good points in your testimony.\n\nMR. KERWIN:  Thank you.\n\nREP. KING:  And I can take issue with some parts of it, but there are a lot of good points that I think we all need to \nreview.\n\nAnd I'd like to quickly, if I could, turn to Dr. Fonte.\n\nAnd you referenced intermarriage.  I'd ask this question:  The reduction in the amount of intermarriages that we \nhave, interracial intermarriage, could that be -- and what are your thoughts on it being a result of the effects of \nmulticulturalism that might tend to isolate young Americans in those ethnic enclaves rather than being further \nassimilated into the broader society where they have contact with people of different areas of the society?\n\nMR. FONTE:  Yes, I think that's part of it.  And the research from the Ohio State professor said the main point was \nwe're bringing in large numbers of unskilled immigrants with low education and the people usually marry within the \ngroup in this particular category.  So Latinos are marrying Latinos and Asians are marrying Asians.  So this is a \ncomplete reversal in the '90s from what we saw in the '70s and '80s.  So it has something to do with numbers and it \nsuggests large numbers of unskilled folks are marrying each other.\n\nREP. KING:  Thank you, Dr. Fonte.\n\nI yield back, Madame Chair.\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  Thank you, Tom.\n\nThe chairman of the full committee, Mr. Conyers is recognized.\n\nREP. CONYERS:  Thank you, ma'am.\n\nThis is a great discussion we're having.  And if we could only find a way to get around the five-minute rule.  \n(Laughter.)  Because there's so much -- I've been looking very carefully, Dr. Fonte, to find something that you and I \nagreed upon.  We got to have a starting point here, and I may have it.  When you say that multiethnicity and ethnic \nsubcultures have enriched America and have always been a part of our past since colonial days.  Now that's a good \nstarting point, isn't it?\n\nMR. FONTE:  We agree.\n\nREP. CONYERS:  But the executive orders -- intermarriage -- it was against the law until 1967 when a Supreme \nCourt case made it legal for couples to decide to cross the line.  The Clinton executive order didn't bother me that \nmuch.\n\nBut let's get to what seems to be the heart of the matter in a couple minutes.  English-language-only laws:  That's \nwhat seems to be bugging a lot of people in the Congress and outside too.   Now, does that -- would English-\nlanguage-only laws help promote immigrants into Americanization?  There I used your term.\n\nMR. FONTE:  And Barbara Jordan's term.\n\nREP. CONYERS:  Who wants to try that?\n\n\n\nDr. Rumbaut.\n\nMR. RUMBAUT:  I would argue that exactly the opposite would happen.  Much as you saw with the instance of \nidentity expressions and so on, the moment you try to coerce and to impose a rule on someone and tell them what \nyou can and you cannot speak, you're going to engender a reaction to that.\n\nThe best way to Americanize, to use Barbara -- in Barbara Jordan's sense, is to treat the process of assimilation \nor Americanization as a seduction.  People will become American because they desire to.  They don't become \nAmerican or speak English because they are told to, or because they are required to.  All that would do is end up \ndriving a wedge in immigrant families between parents and children, and it would end up creating far more \nunintended but serious problems than you are trying to achieve.  Besides there's no need for it when you look at the \nevidence that you have in front of you; there is no need to require people to speak a language that they are all \nmoving toward at historic speeds.\n\nREP. CONYERS:  Dr. Gerstle, answer that and talk with me about the impression I've had since the mid-'60s that \ninnumerable swearing- in ceremonies of people becoming naturalized citizens, where the pride and the patriotism, \nthe loyalty, the excitement, the dedication is so overpowering.\n\nI mean, you take that away and then they have -- in Detroit you have right outside the swearing-in ceremony, you \ncan register to vote, right on the spot, as soon as you're given the oath.\n\nTalk to me about that and the previous question with the time I have left.\n\nMR. GERSTLE:  I second what Dr. Rumbaut said.  We're struggling with this issue in Nashville, Tennessee, now \nwhere an English-only ordinance was put forward by the city council attracted hundreds of people to meetings.  It \nwas ultimately passed by the council and then vetoed by the mayor -- splits among Democrats and Republicans in \nthat place.  And I think the feeling was, and it's a feeling that I agree with, that it would be more of a barrier to \nintegration and involving people in America than it would be a benefit.\n\nHistorically there were efforts in the 1920s to have English-only laws.  There were efforts to banish private schools \nwhere any language was taught other than English.  There was an effort to impose on public schools complete \nteaching of English every period of the day. The teaching of foreign languages was curtailed.  Several of these were \nthrown out by the courts.\n\nIt did have this effect:  It did mobilize the immigrant community and made them realize the importance of \nparticipating in politics, naturalizing, engaging American democracy, learning it, participating in it, and that, I believe, \nis their most important school.\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  The gentleman's time has expired.\n\nThe gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Goodlatte.\n\nREP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA):  Thank you, Madame Chairman.  I appreciate your holding this hearing.  It is, I \nagree with the chairman, very interesting.\n\nDr. Gerstle, I was very interested in your testimony regarding the capacity of our country to assimilate.  I am not \nsure that I disagree with you, but I am very concerned that it's not happening.\n\nThe evidence cited by the gentleman from Iowa regarding the dramatic downward trends of permanent residents \napplying for citizenship from 80 percent in the 1960s down to 13 percent in the last decade is very disturbing.\n\nWhat do you attribute that to?  Why are we failing to assimilate --\n\n\n\nMR. GERSTLE:  I think the first thing I would say is that this country went through a really tough period in the 1960s \nand '70s where all kinds of people became very anti-American, native- born and foreign-born alike.  And this had to \ndo with the frustration over civil rights, a frustration over the Vietnam War.\n\nThe origins of multiculturalism are as an anti-American creed: One's ethnicity, one's ethnic identity is preferable to \none's American identity.  So I think the decline in loyalty and belief in America happened across the board and it \nhappened among immigrants and the native-born.\n\nREP. GOODLATTE:  But during that decade, 82 percent of permanent residents who became eligible for citizenship \nduring that decade applied for citizenship.  In the 1980s when you didn't have that, it was dramatically down.\n\nIn the 1990s, so-called Clinton era, it was plummeting.  And I don't know what it's been for the last decade, but \nthose figures would seem to rebut not support your contention that --\n\nMR. GERSTLE:  Well, I think -- I think -- I would be very interested to see -- I don't have them handy, what the \nfigures are for the last couple years and to see if they have ticked upward in that regard.\n\nA couple things are important.  First, I think length of residence of time, is very important in terms of naturalization.  \nIf we look at the historical period we find very low rates of naturalization among European groups for very long \nperiods of time. In fact, if you look at the census and naturalization figures of 1920 you'd find only a quarter of any \nof these Eastern and Southern European populations having naturalized, and many of those people had been there \n20 or 25 years.\n\nREP. GOODLATTE:  Let me ask --\n\nMR. GERSTLE:   The '20s and '30s are the big decades of naturalization.\n\nREP. GOODLATTE:  All right, we'll take a look at those.\n\nLet me ask you about another subject:  dual citizenship.  As you may know, the Supreme Court ruled a number of \nyears ago that you couldn't deprive an individual of their citizenship in another country.  They could maintain that \neven upon swearing allegiance to the United States.\n\nDo you think that's a good thing or a bad thing?  Does that help assimilation?  Is it good that somebody is voting \nfor elected officials in another country elsewhere in the world as well as participating in the United States?  Does \nthat help with that?\n\nMR. GERSTLE:  I think it is a worldwide phenomenon that most countries are moving towards this and reflects, I \nthink, the degree to which people move around the world and are comfortable with that.  I think it would be difficult \nto resist that.\n\nI would say that the most --\n\nREP. GOODLATTE:  Is it dual citizenship or is it no citizenship if effectively people are choosing in such low \nnumbers to affiliate themselves with the United States?\n\nMR. GERSTLE:  I don't think it's no citizenship.  I think citizenship and integration and I'm very comfortable using \nthe word Americanization -- assimilation is a more problematic term that maybe we can talk about later -- but these \nhappen through institutions and through the engagement of immigrants in the practice of American politics.\n\nIf we find ways to do that, to bring them into American politics, give them a stake in the political system, through \ntheir representatives, mobilize them in this way, that will lead to a deepening attachment to America and \nappreciation for this country's heritage of freedom.\n\nREP. GOODLATTE:  I hope you're right.\n\n\n\nLet me ask Dr. Fonte:  Would an official English language be helpful in promoting that assimilation?\n\nMR. FONTE:  I think that that would be fine as a statement of E pluribus unum.  I think there's no reason we \nshouldn't all be voting in English; that gives the signal that we're all in this together.\n\nIt hurts the immigrant and the ethnic group if the immigrant is only following the election -- you could do this -- \nfollowing the foreign language venue, but you wouldn't have a full range of the debates; you wouldn't have all the \narguments out there.  So it hurts the immigrant more than anyone else, I would think.\n\nREP. GOODLATTE:  What about the issue of dual-citizenship?\n\nMR. FONTE:  I think dual-allegiance is a problem.  If someone is voting and holding office or running for office in a \nforeign country -- Felix Frankfurter, one of our great Supreme Court Justices, says this shows allegiance to a \nforeign power incompatible with allegiance to the United States and --\n\nREP. GOODLATTE:  Could we retest that in the Supreme Court?\n\nMR. FONTE:  What we could do is pass legislation.  Earl Warren, who wrote -- favored this decision, said you \ncouldn't lose your citizenship but he said there could be laws against voting in a foreign country, serving in a foreign \ngovernment.  So it could be made simply against the law by legislation and not -- someone wouldn't lose their \ncitizenship, but they're unlikely to do it if it's against the law.\n\nSo there -- measures could be taken and should be taken, because this is going to be a major problem for us.  And \nin the past, we had a person elected to the Mexican Congress last -- in 2004.  He was an American citizen and his \nloyalty now is obviously to the Mexican Congress.\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  Dr. Fonte, if you could rest --\n\nREP. GOODLATTE:  Thank you, Madame Chairman.\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  Thank you.  The gentleman's time has expired.\n\nThe gentleman -- Mr. Luis Gutierrez from Illinois.\n\nREP. LUIS GUTIERREZ (D-IL):  Thank you very much.\n\nI want to thank all of the panelists.  I hope that the ranking member does find time to read Dr. Rumbaut's \ndocumentation that he sent before the committee.  I think it's very important that the one time that we do have \nsomebody from the Latino community come before this committee that we at least read the testimony that he or she \nhas submitted; given that most of the ire and focus has been on the Latino community and Latino immigrants, as \nthough they were the only immigrants to the United States of America, when indeed we know that 40 percent of the \nundocumented never crossed that border.  They came here through a legal fashion and that there are indeed \nmillions of undocumented immigrants.\n\nWe watched www.LegalizetheIrish.org come here before the Congress, and the Polish community and the \nUkrainian community, the Filipino community, from so many different other nations enriching this great nation.  So I \nhope that we would take time.\n\nI would like to also say to Dr. Rumbaut, thank you so much for coming and giving the personal testimony.  And I just \nwant to share with you, I -- the only reason my daughter speaks Spanish is because we enrolled them in Spanish \nimmersion classes from kindergarten through eighth grade.  And I thank the public school system of Chicago for \nhaving those classes because if it were up to me and my wife, who are bilingual but only speak English at home \nand rarely watch Univision or Telemundo, unless, of course, we want news that's relevant to our community in the \nevening and we want to find out what really happened in our neighborhood and in our life -- well, we put them on.  \nBut this is the experience.\n\n\n\nI would hope that members of the committee would just take some time to visit immigrant communities and walk \namong the immigrant community.  And they would find that if you want to pass English-only, that's fine.  It's a waste \nof time, a waste of money to enforce it, because obviously my parents didn't come here as immigrants.  They came \nhere as migrants from Puerto Rico.  But they were monolingual. They only spoke Spanish.\n\nAnd as we look at assimilation, I think we also have to look at segregation, the kind of society that we live in.  The \nfact is, I became more assimilated as I grew older because economic and social possibilities were afforded to me \nthat were not afforded to me as a youth.  I grew up in a Puerto Rican neighborhood.  Most everyone I knew was \nPuerto Rican -- my parents, my family, the church I went to on Sunday, where my parents worked, almost every -- I \nmean, that's part of American society.  It's an unfortunate part of American society that segregation exists.\n\nBut if we're going to deal with this, quote, \"assimilation,\" I think we should also look at the underlying bias and \nprejudice that sometimes raises its ugly head, unfortunately, in our great American society that stops people from \nbecoming assimilated into American society.  As you become older, well, my kids are now going to college and my \ngrandson -- we're going to have a real big problem with the grandson.  Unfortunately, it's going to be a tough battle.\n\nMR.     :  As they say in Brooklyn, forget about it.\n\nREP. GUTIERREZ:  Forget about it.  (Laughs.)  We're going to have a tough problem.  And I just -- I share this with \nmy colleagues on the other side to say, \"Fear not.\"  My parents only spoke Spanish.  I obviously have some English \nproficiency that's allowed me to come here to the Congress of the United States.  I may not be as great as \nmembers on the other side of the aisle, but I try each and every day.\n\nAnd my daughters -- I assure you, we spent an inordinate amount of money.  I don't do it -- I do it because I want to \nmaintain that rich cultural history and linguistic history, but I also do it because I want to make sure the job \nopportunities and economic opportunities are available to them, As things are posted in the newspaper, \"bilingual \npreferred,\" by large American national corporations so that American citizens can produce goods and distribute \nthose goods throughout the world and we can become a more prosperous nation.\n\nPeople do buy goods because they're advertised in other languages. And Dr. Rumbaut knows, Univision isn't \nentirely owned by Latinos; much less Telemundo, which is owned by GE and NBC.  (Laughs.) I mean, so these \ncorporations are not just Latino corporations.\n\nI would like to say to all the witnesses, thank you so much.  And I would hope that we would simply read the \nliterature because -- instead of English-only, I wish we could all get together, because I could join my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle.  Let's fund English classes.  Let's fund them and let's open up centers and you will find \nthat they will be filled to capacity.  People want to learn English in this country.  They aren't given the ability to learn \nEnglish, number one.  Well, part of the reason is the segregation; another is access to educational opportunities.\n\nI thank the witnesses.  And I want to thank the gentlelady from California, our chairwoman, for putting this wonderful \npanel together.\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  Thank you.  The gentleman's time has expired.\n\nMr. Gohmert.\n\nREP. LOUIE GOHMERT (R-TX):  Thank you, Madame Chairwoman.\n\nAnd I do appreciate my colleague's comments about English classes.  You probably have a very good idea there.  \nOne of my close friends in Tyler, Texas, said -- you know, his parents, both of them came from Mexico, and \nspeaking English was a struggle, but they opened two restaurants that are two of our best in Tyler.  And they made \nclear that their children were to learn English, that if they were to reach their potential in this country, they needed to \nspeak good English and they speak probably better than I.\n\n\n\nBut it does seem that some well-meaning people encourage and want to allow people to continue to speak \nSpanish, which to me is almost a form of discrimination because that would prevent individuals from reaching their \npotential.  My friend Mr. Ramirez, at home, has been a city councilman and a county commissioner and that \nwouldn't have happened had he not spoken such excellent English and been able to communicate ideas so \neffectively.\n\nBut I go back to some of the things that were said here, and I admire greatly, Dr. Rumbaut, your testimonial.  My \ngreat-grandfather came over in the late 1700s, didn't speak English.  But he did two things:  He learned to speak \nEnglish and he worked his tail off.  And within 25 years, he built one of the nicest homes in Quero, Texas. It's still \nthere with the historic marker on it.\n\nI'm curious, just as a hypothetical, if something tragic happened and all of us in this room were wiped out -- \nalthough there are those that might say if I were wiped out it wouldn't be all that tragic, but for the rest it might be.  \nThis is being recorded.\n\nDr. Rumbaut, where would you want your loved ones to have your remains placed, whether cremation or burial?  \nWhere would you want them to place you?  You've moved around, you've seen the best of all kinds of places.  \nWhat do you think?\n\nMR. RUMBAUT:  I can tell you that my brother is here.  I have a sister in Texas that has an urn containing the \nashes of my father and we're waiting for the politically appropriate moment which, at his request, to take his ashes \nto Cienfuegos, which is a city in Cuba where he was born and where he first saw the sea and so on.\n\nOn the other hand, his name was -- (name inaudible) -- Rumbaut. My son is named -- (name inaudible) -- Rumbaut \nafter my father.  He was born in Michigan.  He's a Detroit Pistons fan, a Detroit Redwings fan; he's a Detroit Tigers \nfan.  We're in Anaheim now, but he doesn't follow the Angels; he doesn't follow the Ducks.  It's the Redwings, \"go \nRedwings,\" and so on.\n\nHe would not -- he knows that his grandfather came from Cuba and so on, but he would have no attachment to that \nwhatsoever.\n\nHe would not want to be buried there.  If anything, he would want to go back to Detroit.  We all form our own \nattachments in the context of our lives.  There is no plot out there that says that immigrants want to go back and \nthat their fifth column --\n\nREP. GOHMERT:  Okay, but I take it from your answer you hadn't made that decision yet yourself.  And I \nappreciate the discussion of other individuals.\n\nMR. RUMBAUT:  Unimportant.\n\nREP. GOHMERT:  What you would want?\n\nMR. RUMBAUT:  It's unimportant what happens to me.  What's important is what I do with my life.  It's, as I told Mr. \nConyers --\n\nREP. GOHMERT:  So that's what your -- you want your loved ones to know -- if you go back to my question, it was \n-- but you want me to say it doesn't matter --\n\nMR. RUMBAUT:  It would be in the United States.\n\nREP. GOHMERT:  Okay, well, there we go.  We got to the answer eventually.  Thank you.\n\nBut, you know, I appreciate -- Dr. Gerstle you had indicated about immigration in the last century or so.  How many \nof the individuals back 100 years ago -- I know my great-grandfather would be in this group.  He put his stake down \n\n\n\nin Texas, and despite nearly all of his family being in Europe, he had no intention of going back there.  Do you know \nhow many, in those days, asked to be buried or have their remains sent back to their country of origin?\n\nMR. GERSTLE:  No, I don't think we have that kind of data.  In fact, it's tremendously hard simply to find out who \nwent back and how many.  We have historians looking at ship registers to find out when they came and then other \nship registers in the subsequent five, 10, 15 years to find out when they went back.  So it's incredibly hard to do \nthat.\n\nNot every group who came here looked to go back.  It's just among the majority of Eastern and Southern \nEuropeans who came for the first 10 or 15 years ago, probably a majority were thinking of going back. Some went \nback, some didn't make it.\n\nREP. GOHMERT:  Well, just in conclusion, if I could -- as a history major and a fan of history, I can't help but \nwonder as nations throughout world history rose and fell, often they were becoming more fractured from more \nwidespread dissimilation and I can't help but wonder if there weren't experts back in those days saying, \"It's not \nhappening and if it is, it's a good thing.\" So --\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  The gentleman's time has expired.\n\nThe gentlelady from Texas.\n\nREP. SHEILA JACKSON LEE (D-TX):  I thank the chairwoman and I certainly thank the indulgence of the ranking \nmember.  I thank the witnesses for their very thoughtful testimony.  The lack of questions to any of you does not \nsuggest the importance (sic) of your testimony.\n\nBut this is a very emotional roller coaster that we're on.  It's a chicken and egg, Dr. Rumbaut, frankly.  If we don't \nhave comprehensive immigration reform, we'll never get to where our colleagues are wanting us to go.  Many of \nus have legislative initiatives that really speak to some of their concerns.\n\nIf we could get out of the start gate, our language in Save America comprehensive immigration bill that I have, the \nSTRIVE Act, all talk about -- and the earned access to legalization talks about an English requirement, talks about -\n- in particular, my bill talks about community service.  And in fact, it has the word \"Americanization,\" words that \nwe're not really running away from and words that you're speaking to.\n\nSo I want to ask -- first of all, I'd like you to just say yes or no.  These are elements that populations would not run \naway from if we had comprehensive immigration reform.  People are not running away from learning English, \nthey're not running away from if you wanted to do community service.  Our chairman of the full committee already \nsaid the first person that lost their life (in Iraq) was an undocumented person.\n\nWhen I traveled to Iraq and Afghanistan and I see the array, the potpourri of faces that represent the United Nations \nthat are Americans, I've never seen any diminishing of patriotism among those young Hispanic soldiers, young \nAsian soldiers, young African-American soldiers.  So I guess -- just a yes or no:  Do you think the immigrant \ncommunity, if a comprehensive immigration reform bill -- would run away from the concepts of English, \nAmericanization, community service?\n\nMR. RUMBAUT:  Absolutely not.\n\nREP. JACKSON LEE:  And let me probe you a little bit more, because this is an important question, and I wish the \nhonorable Barbara Jordan that preceded me some few years back was here to speak for herself, because one thing \nthat I knew her as in life was a person who grew, who looked at the landscape and would not stand for denying due \nprocess or fairness to anyone.  So she's not here to speak for herself.  And the word \"Americanization\" and all of \nher language, I guess they don't remember the words in this committee that said \"We the People will not be denied \nconstitutional rights.\"\n\n\n\nBut moving forward, I raised teenagers.  I raised them in an integrated high school, so call it, in Houston, Texas.  \nThere was the Latino Hispanic table; there was the African-American table, the Caucasian table, the Asian table.  \nAnd if anybody saw the movie \"Freedom Writers,\" that really captures what our young people are going through and \nthey achieve this identity.\n\nIf you remember the Black Power movement, if you remember the movement where I was in in college, all of us \nwere going back to Africa.  And we were citizens, but we were all going back.  We were going to the motherland.  \nThere's this emotional draw to your ethnicity.  But I tell you, as somewhat of an adult, over 21, in the tragedy of \n9/11, I didn't see one dry eye, no matter what color you were.\n\nI don't know why we're struggling and caught in the quagmire of people's identity when identities gives pride, are \nvaluable for America.\n\nSo could you just respond to this -- I think you did talk about it, teenagers' identity is completely different from \nrejecting becoming Americanized, completely different.  And if there are others -- panelists, Mr. Kerwin, you want to \nspeak to -- and Mr. -- Dr. Fonte -- completely different from this concept of never learning English and never \nbecoming American.\n\nI'll start with you Dr. Rumbaut.\n\nDR. RUMBAUT:  I would say very briefly --\n\nREP. JACKSON LEE:  Do you remember the Black Power movement and all of us -- many of us, of my culture \ngoing to the motherland?  We still do want to go.  (Laughs.)\n\nDR. RUMBAUT:  I understand completely.  I remember Barbara Jordan very, very well.  You resemble her in many \nways.  And I would say simply, very briefly, that part of the problem is framing all these issues in either/or terms.  \nThere's no contradiction in being proud of one's heritage and being proud of one's roots, in wanting to go back to \nAfrica at the time that you were -- the \"golden days,\" and at the same time being an American citizen concerned \nwith the best interests of this country and wanting to give it all, including, as you mention, and as Chairman Conyers \nmentioned, even one's very life, among -- there is simply no contradiction between the two.  And we need to frame \nit in larger terms.\n\nSo let me just stop there.  I mean, I could say many other things, but there are other members of the panel that you \nwant to respond --\n\nREP. JACKSON LEE:   Go ahead, Dr. Kerwin, please.\n\nMR. KERWIN:  Just to repeat, I think that it's absolutely true that the foreign-born want to learn English.  The \naverage wait for ESL classes by professional credentialed people is now six months.\n\nREP. LEE:  It's a crisis, really.\n\nMR. KERWIN:  It is a crisis.  And I don't think people dispute the need for patriotic assimilation.  You know, there \nmay be some out there that do, but I think in general that it's understood that that's necessary.  It's also true what \nyou say, that legal status is crucial to integration.  There's no doubt about that.\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  The gentlelady's time has expired.\n\nREP. JACKSON LEE:  I thank you.\n\nSorry, Dr. Fonte.\n\nMR. FONTE:   Was I supposed to speak or --\n\n\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  Well, the gentlelady's time is expired, but, without objection, we'll extend her time for one minute.  \nSo, Dr. Fonte --\n\nMR. FONTE:  Okay, as I said to Chairman Conyers and we agreed, that ethnic subcultures have always been an \nimportant part of American life.  But what's -- the key factor in immigration is when the new citizen takes the oath \nof allegiance.  I absolutely and entirely renounce all allegiance to my foreign state or country, and so on.\n\nThis is -- in other words, it's a political transfer of allegiance.  Someone is transferring political allegiance from the \nbirth nation to the United States.  So that is either/or.  You're either an American -- you're either loyal to the United \nStates, as Theodore Roosevelt said, and no other country.  That's different from a pride and ethnicity that which we \nall have.\n\nREP. JACKSON LEE:  Reclaiming my time -- I just -- just one minute.  I've never seen the two mixed together, \napples and oranges, taking the oath and a denial of your culture being -- let me just say this:  taking the oath and \nhaving to reject your culture and having your culture being nonpatriotic.  I don't think that makes sense at all.\n\nMR. FONTE:  Right, we're not -- you don't --\n\nREP. LEE:  They take the oath and they still believe in singing the songs and understanding that culture.  Believe \nme, they're still Americans.  That's what Americans --\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  The gentlelady's time has expired.\n\nThe gentlelady from California.\n\nREP. LINDA T. SANCHEZ (D-CA):  Thank you, Madame Chair.\n\nI do have questions, but I do have comments first, because I've been listening very intently to the conversation and \nto your testimony.\n\nI want to tell you a story.  It's about two immigrants that came from Mexico, probably would have been considered \nwithout skills:  one who worked himself from a factory shop floor to being a successful small-business owner; the \nother who raised seven children who all went to college and then in her mid-40s went back to school to get her \nGED, her AA, her B.A., her teaching credential and still teaches today in the public school system.  Of the seven \nchildren that they raised that went to college, two of them are now serving in Congress and we are the first women \nof any relation to serve in Congress.\n\nI'm talking about my family and my parents here.  So you can call it integration or assimilation or Americanization, \nor any other damn thing you want to call it, but it is an American success story that begins with immigrants.\n\nDr. Fonte, I take great issue with your assertion that English- only laws with respect to elections are necessary.  My \nmother, who came to this country and became a teacher -- she's a public school teacher, she teaches other \npeople's children English -- sometimes finds it easier to understand the nuances of complex ballot initiatives if \nthey're provided in the first language that she ever learned, which is Spanish.\n\nThis does not mean she's not fluent in English, because she teaches it.  But she understands and is a more \ninformed voter sometimes when she receives those materials in her native language. So I don't think that takes \nanything away from her loyalty to this country, her love of this country, her desire to continue teaching English in \nthis country.  And I really, really take issue with the idea that if we make English-only laws for voting that that's \nsomehow going to create a more informed citizenry or a more desirous citizenry for voting, because my mother \nalready has that desire.\n\nDr. Rumbaut, you mentioned telenovela.  I am a big fan of telenovela.  But even our telenovelas are linguistically \nassimilated because I used to watch \"Betty la fea\" in Spanish and we now have the English counterpart, \"Ugly \n\n\n\nBetty,\" which is a huge successful show. In fact, America Ferrera, who stars in the telenovela, the U.S. version, won \na Golden Globe for her performance.\n\nBut I do want to get down to some of the questions.\n\nProfessor Rumbaut, I know that you have been studying immigrant integration and linguistical assimilation for \napproximately 30 years. Based on your research, do you believe that there is a danger that English is going to stop \nbeing the common language of the United States?  Is there a real threat of that?\n\nMR. RUMBAUT:  No.  We'll, as I mentioned, no.  If anything, English is the official language of the Milky Way galaxy \nalready.  And its headquarters are right here in the United States and -- with a quarter of a billion English \nmonolinguals, it has absolutely nothing to worry about.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned, if there's something that I think might be -- one might worry about, it's the fate of the \nimmigrant languages that immigrants bring free of charge to the United States.  This is a human capital asset in a \nglobal economy.  It's a national asset.  It is even a national security asset.  The Iraq Study Group mentioned that \nonly six out of 1,000 American embassy personnel in Iraq knew -- are fluent in Arabic.  There's no contradiction in \ntrying to be bilingual and at the same time, as your mother, being fluent in English.\n\nREP. SANCHEZ:  And I understand that, and I think it's interesting that in this country we don't want bilingual \neducation, yet we require four years of a foreign language in order to get into college.  I think that's a contradiction \nthat I've never quite been able to understand.\n\nI'm interested in knowing a little bit more about how linguistic assimilation occurs.  You mentioned that the way to \nencourage it is not to force somebody to speak in English only but -- can you talk a little bit about linguistic \nassimilation?\n\nMR. RUMBAUT:  Let me -- yes.  The final way -- the number one determinant of becoming fluent in English and the \nacquisition of English fluency is -- among immigrants, is age at arrival.  There's a biology and a neurology of \nlanguage acquisition.  That is why children pick it up so quickly.  That is why if you don't learn it after puberty, you \nwill -- you may be able to learn English, but not without a telltale accent, and the older you are at arrival, the thicker \nyour accent.  You'll sound like Desi Arnaz.\n\nBut -- so that alone will insure the acquisition of English and speaking and sounding like a native.  With the media, \nthe pressure of peers and so on, that is going to take its way and English is going to triumph no matter what.  If you \narrive here as an elderly person, however, there's no way, no matter how interested you are in learning English, \nthat you will be able to command it and -- let alone speak it like a native.\n\nREP. SANCHEZ:  May I ask the chairwoman for unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds to ask a very \nsimple yes or no question?\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  Without objection.\n\nREP. SANCHEZ:  Thank you.\n\nAnd, Professor Rumbaut, last question:  Is there any reason to believe that the immigrants that we have seen of \ntoday -- today's era, the last couple decades -- are any less desirous of learning English than were the immigrants \nof the '20s and '30s?\n\nMR. RUMBAUT:  If anything, I would say that immigration is the sincerest form of flattery.  (Laughter.)\n\nMR. GERSTLE:  Can I add something brief to that?  If -- I want to emphasize how important longitudinal studies are \nof the sort that Dr. Rumbaut is doing.  If you look at population at any point in time, it may appear to you that \neveryone is speaking Spanish or some other language.  But if you break that population down for age and \ngeneration, you get a very different picture.\n\n\n\nIn 1918 or 1915 or 1910, if you did an impression walking down the street of any major American city in the \nNortheast, Midwest or West Coast, you might be overwhelmed by the degree to which people did not seem to be \nable to speak English.  But if you were to do the kind of longitudinal study that Dr. Rumbaut and his colleagues are \ndoing for the present moment, you would see a similar kind of progress --\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  The gentlelady's time has expired and we will grant an additional 30 seconds so Dr. Fonte --\n\nMR. FONTE:  Just a word about 1918, 1920:  One thing we're forgetting is one of the reasons there was a great \nsuccess in the immigration was there was a cutoff bill in 1924 that -- I wouldn't have been for it -- kept my relatives \nliterally out of the country. But there was an immigration cutoff bill in 1924, so we've actually had a pause from \n1924 to 1965.  We had low numbers of immigration that certainly helped the Americanization, assimilation \nprocess.\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  The gentleman -- Mr. Ellison.\n\nREP. KEITH ELLISON (D-MN):  Thank you, Madame Chair.\n\nMy question, Dr. Fonte, is this:  What year was the highest year of immigration in American recorded history?\n\nMR. FONTE:  I think --\n\nREP. ELLISON:  It's not a trick question.\n\nMR. FONTE:  It was around, I think early 20th century.\n\nREP. ELLISON:  And in that year, what percentage of people living in America spoke a language other than English \nas their first language?\n\nMR. FONTE:  There was a very large percentage who did not speak English.\n\nREP. ELLISON:  And America did okay, didn't it?\n\nMR. FONTE:  It did okay, yes.  I just said that the immigration cutoff of 1924 had a lot to do with it.\n\nREP. ELLISON:  Right, well, I mean -- what do you think about that Dr. Rumbaut?  Is the -- was 1924 a year that \nsort of saved \"Americanism\" due to immigration?\n\nMR. RUMBAUT:  In the first place, the 1924 laws were not fully implemented until 1929.  That's when the market \ncrashed.  It was the Great Depression that was most responsible for not allowing -- for not letting people come into \nthis country.  You can pass all sorts of immigration laws and undocumented immigration might follow because of \nthe demand by the American economy, et cetera.\n\nIf the issue is about language, however, then the passing of a law in 1924 is not what determined whether Italian-\nAmericans became fluent in English or not.  What determined that, first and foremost, as I said, was age at arrival \nand generation.  The second generation at best, their Italian would be Italianish in -- it's like English and -- like \nSpanglish; it would be that kind of a version.\n\nBy the grandchildren, regardless of whether you passed a law or not, they would be speaking English only because \nof the assimilative forces in American society with respect to language and the issue that I mentioned before, about \nthe biology of language acquisition, the schools, the pressure from peers, the media and all of that.\n\nREP. ELLISON:  Well, Dr. Gerstle.\n\nMR. GERSTLE:  I think -- I agree with that.  I think the cessation of immigration in 1924 in terms of the East and \nSouthern Europeans, it did not affect any peoples from the Western Hemisphere, so we should be very clear about \n\n\n\nthat, who continued to come in large numbers unless they were not allowed to come by other means.  I think it was \na factor if only in terms of accelerating the transition demographically from the first to the second generation.\n\nAnd it also reminds us that the present day is never -- can never be precisely like the past.  There are other \nelements of that history that are also different:  the World War I Army, even more importantly the World War II \nArmy, which took 16 million young men and a few women out of their homes everywhere across America, put them \ntogether with each other in a way that was also probably important in terms of their Americanization and integration.\n\nMy point is that we're unlikely to reproduce a 16-million-person conscription army in 2007, 2008, 2009, but we have \nto think hard about those institutions that will perform the kind of service that these other institutions did 30, 40, 50 \nyears ago.\n\nREP. ELLISON:  You know, just an observation:  I mean, part of what we seem to be debating today is what does it \nmean to be an American, and what impact does a language have on that identity?  And, you know, I think that our -- \nthe fact that we have at least a chance to have those assets that Dr. Rumbaut talked about, which is the multiplicity \nof languages that people bring here when the emigrate is -- doesn't diminish American identity and actually may \nadd to it.\n\nAnd if American identity means anything, hopefully it means a respect for law -- respect for the First Amendment, to \nallow people to express themselves.  So, I mean, we're the only country that I know of that is bound together by a \nconstitution as opposed to a long tradition, history and culture.  And maybe that's what we need to be focusing on \nand maybe you don't need to speak English to do that.\n\nSo, I mean, the founders of this country, did they say that we needed to speak English?  And did they consider it?\n\nDr. Rumbaut, do you know if Washington and Jefferson and Franklin thought about the need to have a national \nlanguage?\n\nMR. RUMBAUT:  Thomas Jefferson spoke fluent Spanish.\n\nMR. FONTE:  I can give you -- I've written on this.  The founders did definitely support English and a common \nculture.  They've written on it extensively.\n\nREP. ELLISON:  Well, why didn't they put it in the Constitution? I mean, they could have, but they didn't.\n\nMR. FONTE:  It wasn't necessary to put it in the Constitution.\n\nREP. ELLISON:  Well, why not?  I mean, they knew that --\n\nMR. FONTE:  They wanted a minimal Constitution, limited government.  There wasn't -- they didn't --\n\nREP. ELLISON:  But Doctor, they put the things in there that needed to be there.  Why didn't they put English?  \nWould anybody else like to venture a view?  No?\n\nMR. FORTE:  There's no need to do so.\n\nREP. ELLISON:  Maybe they considered it and rejected it because they thought that English was not a sine qua \nnon of American identity. Perhaps that's true.\n\nMR. GERSTLE:  I think they also did feel, though, that the freedom of the new world would be so intoxicating that \npeople would want to learn English.\n\nMR. FONTE:  Congressman King just quoted a letter from George Washington to John Adams in which he said he \nwants -- the immigrant should be assimilated to our ways, our customs, our way of life, would become one people.  \nObviously, knowing English would be part of that.\n\n\n\nREP. ELLISON:  Didn't put it in the Constitution.\n\nREP. LOFGREN:  The gentleman's time has expired.\n\nAnd we have come to the conclusion of this hearing.  I want to thank all the witnesses for their testimony today.  \nAnd without objection, members will have five legislative days to submit additional written questions to you, which \nwe will forward.  And we ask that you answer as promptly as you can so that we can make your answers part of the \nrecord.  Without objection, the record will remain open for five legislative days for the submission of any other \nmaterials.\n\nYou know, Dr. Rumbaut, you mentioned as you started your testimony what a country, really, that you came here \nas a young man, never expecting to be a witness here before the Congress.  Ms. Hong, the counsel for the \nsubcommittee wrote me a little note saying she came as an immigrant at age 12 never dreaming that she would be \nthe counsel to the Immigration Subcommittee in the United States Congress. So we have much to be proud of in \nour wonderful country, and your testimony has been very helpful to us today.\n\nI would like to extend an invitation to everyone here today to attend our next hearing on comprehensive \nimmigration reform.  We will have one tomorrow afternoon at 3:00 p.m. in this very same room, during which we \nwill explore the impacts of immigration on state and local communities.  Then, on Friday morning at 9:00 a.m., we \nwill focus again on comprehensive immigration reform as it relates to the future of undocumented students and \nreform.  With that, this hearing is adjourned.\n"}
