{"title": "House committee OKs breaking INS in two", "body": "\nA House committee agreed Tuesday on terms for dismantling the Immigration and Naturalization Service and \nreplacing it with two separate agencies, moving beyond Bush administration guidelines to overhaul the agency.\n\n\"The time for talk is over with,\" House Judiciary Chairman James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said Tuesday.\n\"The time for action is at hand.\"\n\nSensenbrenner's committee plans to approve the new approach today with legislation to dissect the INS into one \nagency to enforce immigration laws and another to handle citizenship and immigration. The bureaus, which would \nremain under the Justice Department, would report to an associate attorney general for immigration.\n\nINS Commissioner James Ziglar wants to divide the INS functions administratively but keep the agency intact, \nreforming the agency without a new law, he told House members Tuesday.\n\nCommittee members said they have heard too many ineffective INS overhaul plans from different presidents and \nthis time were ready to move forward with their own. \"We've been doing the administrative tango with the INS for a \nlong time,\" said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the committee's ranking Democrat.\n\nIF YOU'RE INTERESTED\n\nTo read the restructuring bill, HR 3231, or Tuesday's testimony on the Web, go to \nwww.house.gov/judiciary/full.htm.
