{"title": "The Nation;An Immigration Proposal That Gets Somewhere", "body": "\nPresident Ford, President Carter and the 96th Congress all studied immigration policy. So did President Reagan \nwho, like Mr. Carter, issued legislative proposals.\nImmigration reform bill is introduced in CongressLast week, the 97th Congress went further, producing an actual \nreform bill.\n\nThe measure, introduced in the Senate by Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, and in the House by Romano \nL. Mazzoli, a Kentucky Democrat, would offer permanent resident status to those who entered the country illegally \nbefore 1978 and temporary status, which could be upgraded after two years, to those who entered before 1980.  \nThose arriving after that, Mr. Mazzoli said, ''would have to go back home.'' The Reagan Administration had \nproposed a 10-year waiting period, which critics said would be too long to be effective.\n\nThe Simpson-Mazzoli bill would come down harder on employers who knowingly hired illegal workers than the \nAdministration, subjecting those with even a single illegal employee to fines of up to $2,000 and six-month prison \nterms. Mr. Reagan had sought to limit comparable sanctions to employers with four or more illegal workers.  The bill \nwould also require the President to develop a ''universal employment authorization'' system to determine a worker's \neligibility, something Mr. Reagan opposes. Instead of the President's guest-worker program, it would ''streamline'' \nexisting programs admitting laborers from Mexico, Jamaica and other countries.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nIllustrations: photo of Alan Simpson and Romano Mazzoli\n"}
