{"title": "Immigration Policy Should Reflect Concern for Environment;Don't Cut Off Aid", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nRe \"A Better Senate Bill on Immigration\" (editorial, May 7): You fail to acknowledge the devils in the details of this \nlegislation.\n\nOnly 16 months ago Congress promised not to pass laws that shift costs to states without financing. While the bill \nclaims to target only illegal immigration, the National Council of State Legislatures estimates that new measures to \nprevent legal immigrants from participating in just 10 assistance programs will put a $744 million strain on state and \nlocal budgets. That's hypocrisy. The Constitution gives the Federal Government sole responsibility for immigration. \nYet Congress is passing the buck to state and local taxpayers.\n\nThis bill also endangers public health by effectively barring legal immigrants from Medicaid. If a legal immigrant's \nsponsor can't pay for medical services and the Government refuses reimbursement, a hospital can deny \nnonemergency medical coverage, increasing risk of contagions and other health problems, or it can accept the \npatient, assume a financial loss and risk interruption in services to all.\n\n \n\nBOB GRAHAM\n\nU.S. Senator from Florida\n\nWashington, May 9, 1996\n"}
