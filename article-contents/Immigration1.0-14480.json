They intend to urge \nCongress to pass both bills, particularly the DREAM Act, he said.\n\n\"Hopefully, we want DREAM Act to be the final law because there is no age clause,\" said Yun, who already has \ncollected 1,500 signed letters in favor of the two bills.\n\n'It's painful'\n\n\"It's painful, because sometimes I feel like I have nothing in the future,\" said Im as she wiped away tears. \"But if the \nDREAM Act gets passed, it would mean I would be able to go to college and not worry about whether I should get \nmarried to a United States citizen in order to get legal status. When they reintroduced it last month, I called my mom \nand . . . we both cried.\"\n\nSaid Yun, \"If the bills pass, they will tremendously impact the 55,000 undocumented immigrants in the Korean \nAmerican community and the 115,000 undocumented immigrants in the Chinese-American community out of the 7 \nmillion nationally. We are urging not only Asians but other communities to work together.\"\n\nAna Maria Archila, executive director of the Latin American Integration Center, said the Latino population is \"the \nlargest minority population in the state.\"\n\n\n\"Although there are no specific numbers on the number of Latino undocumented immigrants, roughly half of the \nundocumented numbers are Latino,\" said Archila. \"We believe this is important legislation to secure the future of our \nimmigrant communities.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nTARA ENGBERG A BETTER WAY Carolina Mateo and Keith Chen look over petitions in support of legislation that \nwould allow illegal immigrants to attend school here.\n"}
