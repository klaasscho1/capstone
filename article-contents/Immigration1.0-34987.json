{"title": "AROUND THE NATION;Marcello Deportation Order Is Upheld by Appeals Court", "body": "\nA Federal appeals court today upheld an order to deport a reputed organized crime chief, Carlos Marcello of \nNew Orleans, an effort that began almost 30 years ago.\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed a ruling by Federal District Judge Jack Gordon of \nNew Orleans, who had blocked a deportation order upheld by the Board of Immigration Appeals.\nFederal Appeals Court upholds deportation order for organized crime leader,Carlos Marcello\n\n''It means that Marcello's latest attempt to avoid deportation has been unsuccessful,'' said John Volz, a United \nStates Attorney. ''The deportation order, arguably, is now back in effect.''\n\nIn refusing Mr. Marcello's 1972 application for suspension of the deportation order, the Board of Immigration \nAppeals said the reason was that he ''lacked good moral character.''\n\nThe board's refusal to suspend the deportation order was appealed to Judge Gordon in 1979. He vacated the \nboard's ruling and sent the case back for a reassessment of Mr. Marcello's character.\n\nJudge Gordon said he felt the board had relied on ''rumor and innuendo'' instead of reading more than 30 sworn \naffidavits obtained from Louisiana residents saying that Mr. Marcello is a fine man.\n\nBut the appeals court said, ''We are unable to adopt these objections to the board's order.''\n"}
