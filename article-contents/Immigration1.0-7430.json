{"title": "COURT: CAN'T HELP SOMALIAN TEEN STAY A FEDERAL JUDGE SAID HE HAD NO JURISDICTION IN THE CASE. THE ISSUE IS THE SAME ONE FACING ELIAN GONZALEZ.", "body": "\nConfronting one of the same legal issues at the center of the Elian Gonzalez case, a federal judge refused \nyesterday to get involved in the case of a 17-year-old boy fighting deportation to Somalia.\n\nU.S. District Judge Alan Gold ruled he lacked jurisdiction to help the teenager, who is known in court only as \nAbdul and claims to know of no relatives left alive in his homeland. Abdul had asked the judge to order that his \ncase be heard in state court.\n\nThe judge said that even if he had legal authority to intervene, the Immigration and Naturalization Service acted \nproperly in deciding to send the teenager back to Somalia despite his fears about returning.\n\nThe question of jurisdiction also figures in Elian's case, which will be argued Tuesday before a different federal \njudge.\n\nAbdul flew into Miami by himself Dec. 23. He has said that he and his father were separated from his mother and \ntwo brothers by war in 1990, and he told INS officials that he saw his father killed by bandits in 1996.\n\nHe wanted a state court to declare him a ward of the state and let him remain in the United States on the grounds \nof abandonment by his parents.\n\nBut federal prosecutors argued that allowing anyone but the INS to decide the boy's future would \"thwart the intent \nof Congress.\"\n\nCheryl Little, one of Abdul's lawyers, said that because of yesterday's ruling - and because Abdul turns 18 today - \nhe will have to pursue a political-asylum claim instead, the usual route taken by adults who arrive in this country.\n\n\"It's a much higher burden,\" Little said. \"It's much more difficult for him to win his case, because he has to prove he \nhas a well-founded fear of persecution upon his return to Somalia.\"\n\n\nAfter the ruling, an INS dentist examined Abdul and concluded from his teeth that he is an adult already subject to \nINS rules governing them. Abdul was allowed to get his belongings from a juvenile center where he had been \nstaying and was transferred to an INS detention center for adults.\n\nMariano Faget, an INS official arrested Thursday on suspicion of being a Cuban spy, was the one who denied \nAbdul's requests to remain in this country. But the judge said the arrest had no bearing on Abdul's case.\n\nU.S. officials said Faget played no role in deciding Elian's case.\n\nEarlier in the day, Attorney General Janet Reno rejected a request to meet with Elian during a visit to Miami, her \nhometown. The meeting had been requested by Lazaro Gonzales, the great-uncle with whom the boy is staying \nand who has protested the INS decision to return Elian to his father in Cuba.\n\nAlso yesterday, the INS rejected a request from the father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, that the child be transferred to a \nnew temporary custodian. The INS said the move would be too disruptive. The father had complained that Lazaro \nand his family had given the news media too much access to Elian, had arranged psychiatric treatment for the boy \nby doctors who had not been approved by his father, and had allowed relatives with criminal records to be around \nthe boy.\n\nThe INS statement said the agency shared the father's concerns about the boy's well-being \"and therefore will \nrequest information from Lazaro Gonzalez concerning the credentials of any psychiatrist or psychologist who has \nseen Elian, as well as any treatment that may have been prescribed for him.\"\n"}
