{"title": "Letters: Government shouldn't protect illegal immigrants on the job", "body": "\nIllegal immigrants can now complain to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission about workplace \ndiscrimination or harassment, according to the Journal report \"Agency will come to aid of illegal workers\" (Oct. 27). \nEmployers can be forced to reinstate those who were unfairly fired, and may have to pay damages.JOURNAL\n\nThis can't really be happening in a civilized country based on the rule of law.  How can an employer be said to have \ndiscriminated against someone whom it was illegal to employ?\n\nHow can the employee be unfairly fired if it was illegal to employ him? And how can the employer be required to \ncommit another crime by rehiring the illegal immigrant? Will he be fined for the first illegal hiring, the firing and \nthen the mandated rehiring?\n\nAnd why is one arm of the federal government --- the EEOC --- not doing the duty of every responsible citizen and \nreporting the illegal immigrants to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for immediate deportation?\n\nDAVID W. ROSS, Stockbridge\n"}
