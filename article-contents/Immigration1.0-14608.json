{"title": "L.I. Firebombing", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nRe \"Old Tensions Over Immigrants Surface After Firebombing\" (news article, July 14):\n\n     Can any reasonable person suspect that the firebombing of the Hispanic home in Farmingville, on Long Island, \nis anything but a hate crime? \n\n It is ludicrous that the police and the F.B.I. are only now suggesting that it might be a bias crime.\n\nWhen will Suffolk County wake up to the need for a hiring site for day laborers? Where hiring sites exist in other \ncommunities, the incidence of violence diminishes.\n\nRobert J. Gaffney, the county executive, missed a real opportunity to reduce tensions by constructing a site after \nthe attempted murders of two Hispanics in September 2000. One hopes that local officials will act now, before \nsomeone is killed.\n\nEDWARD J. THOMPSON\n\nFarmingdale, N.Y., July 14, 2003\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
