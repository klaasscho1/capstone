{"title": "Levy's Record On Minority Issues", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\n Re ''A Chance to Reach Out'' (editorial, April 24):\n\n I have been vilified in these pages for working with the federal government to enforce its own laws with respect to \nillegal immigrants who commit felonies. Whether you agree or not, however, should not be the basis for judging my \nrecord with respect to minority issues. \n\n  No previous administration has been more proactive on issues of concern to minorities. I am leading the fight to \nend the over-assessment of property taxes in minority communities, and racial steering in our housing policies. I \nannounced the creation of a Minority Health Bureau under the auspices of my appointee, the county's first African-\nAmerican health commissioner. \n\n I appointed a Hispanic deputy commissioner of social services, as well as three division heads, and I elevated two \nHispanic police officers to inspector positions, a first in Suffolk. I am the first executive to provide Spanish \ninterpreters at polling places and expanded prenatal units to reduce minority infant mortality rates. One-third of my \nexecutive assistants were minority, as was my first appointment to the bench. I created a program to redevelop \ndowntowns in diverse communities, and I am certifying minority-owned businesses through a procurement \ndirectory. \n\n Hispanics care about more than immigration matters. They care about safe neighborhoods, affordable homes and \nquality-of-life issues -- all of which my administration is addressing with vigor.\n\nSteve Levy\n\nSuffolk County Executive\n\nHauppauge\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
