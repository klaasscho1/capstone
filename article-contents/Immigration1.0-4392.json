{"title": "Immigrant Refugees Improve U.S. Quality of Life;They'll Stay Forever", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nJames R. Edwards Jr. (Op-Ed, Dec. 2) is correct in noting that the thousands of illegal immigrants from Central \nAmerica covered by the amnesty Congress recently enacted \"could return home today and face no threat of \npolitical persecution.\" Unfortunately, the politics surrounding this new amnesty make it clear that no migrant, once \nsettled here, is ever going to go home.\n\nWith this fact in mind, the United States should never again embrace the mendacious notion of \"temporary\" refuge. \nWe must understand that virtually everyone we admit for humanitarian reasons will stay. Thus, those whom we \nwant to protect but do not want as permanent residents of our country must be sheltered in safe havens outside the \nUnited States, like the Guantanamo base in Cuba, and repatriated when the emergencies in their countries have \npassed.\n\n \n\nMARK KRIKORIAN\n\nWashington, Dec. 3, 1997\n\n \n\nThe writer is executive director, Center for Immigration Studies.\n"}
