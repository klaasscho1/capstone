{"title": "Why Are We Losing Our Foreign Students?", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\n  ''Imported Brains'' (editorial, Dec. 3) sounds the alarm on the falling number of foreign students in American \nuniversities. \n\n  You do not mention one important reason for the decline in enrollments: the tarnished reputation of the American \npolitical system among international students.\n\nMore than half of the foreign undergraduates I have recently advised on their choice of graduate school told me \nthat while they think American universities are the best, they were not applying to them because they could not \ncountenance continuing to study in a country they perceive as having lost its respect for human rights. \n\n  Top on their list of concerns is the C.I.A.'s practice of abducting and ''rendering'' suspects to other countries, with \nno due process, where they may be tortured.\n\n  For decades, our universities have been the envy of the world, in large part because of the number and quality of \nthe students they attract from abroad. These great institutions will lose that status unless we can restore \nconfidence in the integrity of our government.\n\nDavid Martyn\n\nSt. Paul, Dec. 3, 2005\n\nThe writer is an assistant professor of German studies at Macalester College.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
