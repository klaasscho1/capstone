{"title": "Five illegal immigrants die in Ariz.", "body": "\nFive illegal immigrants died after crossing the border into southern Arizona's treacherous desert, and authorities \nsearched yesterday for a sixth.\n\n\"We're hoping to find him or her alive,\" said Andy Adame, a spokesman for the Border Patrol's Tucson Sector, \nwhich covers most of the Arizona-Mexico border.\n\nTwo adults and two juveniles survived. They and the six others had become stranded in the rugged terrain Sunday \nafter crossing the border. Temperatures soared over 100 degrees.\n\nOne of the survivors was a Mexican man who sought help Sunday morning at a ranch west of Gila Bend, about 75 \nmiles north of the border, Adame said.\n\nOver the next several hours, Border Patrol search crews found four dead migrants and a fifth who died while en \nroute to a hospital. Two of the dead were females.\n\nIt was the deadliest border crossing in Arizona since May 2001, when Border Patrol agents found 14 dead \nimmigrants on the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge near Yuma. Twelve survived that crossing, including a \nsmuggler.\n\nMore than 115 illegal immigrants have been found dead since Oct. 1 in the Arizona desert, the busiest illegal \nentry point along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\"It surprises me that we have not had more deaths in large groups,\" said the Rev. Robin Hoover, founder of \nHumane Borders, a group that puts water in the desert for illegal crossers.\n\nA record 154 immigrants died sneaking into Arizona in the 2003 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, most of them \nsuccumbing to the heat.\n\nAdame said he did not know how long the group found Sunday had been in the desert. He also did not know their \nnationalities, except for the man who went for help.\n\nThree immigrants were hospitalized and were expected to survive, Adame said.\n\n\nThe man who reported the group was treated for dehydration and did not require hospitalization. He was in Border \nPatrol custody yesterday, along with one of the three other survivors, who had been released from the hospital, \nAdame said.\n"}
