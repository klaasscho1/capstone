{"title": "Hispanic Businesses Get Out the Vote; Recruitment Campaigns, Immigration Debate Spur Latinos", "body": "\nHispanic businesses and Spanish-language media, galvanized by the immigration debates of recent years, are \nsponsoring a bevy of civic engagement and get-out-the-vote efforts in the Washington area.\n\nSome are part of larger national campaigns, spurred both by discussions of immigration policy and by \nRepublican and Democratic interest in recruiting Hispanic voters. The majority of the efforts are nonpartisan and \naimed at getting Hispanics to register and show up on Election Day.\n\nThe Ayuda Business Coalition runs one such campaign, focusing on Northern Virginia, particularly Prince William \nCounty. The nonprofit was formed last year by business owners opposed to the county's crackdown on illegal \nimmigration, calling it bad for the local economy. It consists of more than 100 local, Hispanic-owned businesses.\n\nAyuda has set up registration booths at some members' grocery stores and at soccer matches. It also plans to \nconduct demonstrations on how to use voting machines and run spots on Spanish-language radio  with the tagline, \n\"Si no votas, no cuentas,\" or, \"If you don't vote, you don't count.\"\n\nJos\u00c3\u00a9 Marinay, the owner of a real estate settlement company in Annapolis, joined the Ayuda coalition last year \nwhen he saw sales at his Smart Choice Settlements office in Prince William County plummet. Marinay said he had \ndonated to Democratic campaigns in the past but had not been involved in lobbying or voter mobilization efforts.\n\n\"Immigration was having a tremendous effect in Prince William County because nobody wanted to buy there and it \nwas like they were shutting the door down on us,\" Marinay said. \"There was nothing I could do, and I was trying to \nfind a way to make a difference.\"\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats are courting the Hispanic vote. The Service Employees International Union, \nwhich has endorsed Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.), has been getting its members to register Hispanic voters by \nphone and on the streets. The Republican National Hispanic Assembly, on behalf of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), \n\n\nplans to hold its own roundtable discussions for Hispanic business owners before the election, emphasizing tax \nissues. It also plans to host Hispanic happy hours.\n\n\"The Hispanic vote in Virginia could be pivotal,\" said Raul \"Danny\" Vargas, the founder of Herndon marketing \ncompany VARCom Solutions and chairman of the assembly. \"What you will see is that there are a number of \nbusiness leaders that are engaged in the political process, whereas they had not been before.\"\n\nHispanic media are also playing a stepped-up role, donating air time and advertising space to get Hispanic voters \nto the polls. Local newspapers Washington Hispanic and El Tiempo Latino, a publication of The Washington Post \nCo., are donating ad space to the campaign called \"Ya Es Hora,\" or \"It's Time,\" run by the National Association of \nLatino Elected and Appointed Officials in Los Angeles.\n\nThat campaign, backed nationally by the Spanish-language media giant Univision, has been encouraging \nimmigrants to gain citizenship and vote this year.\n\nAlberto Avenda\u00c3\u00b1o, associate publisher and editor in chief of El Tiempo Latino, said the campaign was born out of \nthe demonstrations by immigrants in 2006.\n\n\"This year, the community is really energized,\" Avenda\u00c3\u00b1o said.\n\nThe local affiliate of Telemundo is partnering with the nonprofit Voto Latino, which will run public service \nannouncements and give political analysis, said Maria Teresa Petersen, director of the Voto Latino campaign.\n\nThe U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce plans to launch get-out-the-vote efforts in October to try to mobilize \nvoters through its member chambers, including ones in the District, Rockville, Germantown and Herndon. It is the \nfirst time that the chamber, which has also stepped up its lobbying and policy efforts in the past two years, has \nattempted to mobilize voters, said David Ferreira, vice president of government affairs for the commerce.\n\n\"We decided to get involved in this election once we saw that comprehensive immigration [legislation] failed,\" he \nsaid. \"We knew we needed to activate the Hispanic community.\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nIMAGE; By Linda Davidson -- The Washington Post; Mirna Urias mans a phone for the Service Employees \nInternational Union's push to get Hispanics to register to vote.
