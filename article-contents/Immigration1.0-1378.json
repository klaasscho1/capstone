Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The \namendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, February 13, 2018, under ``Text of Amendments.'') Recognition of \nthe Minority Leader The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is recognized. Mr. SCHUMER. \nMr. President, as we enter the second day of the debate on immigration, everyone should be focused on finding a \nbill to protect the Dreamers and address border security that can get 60 votes. That is the ball game. The majority \nleader's desire to vote on an unrelated, partisan immigration bill--legislation that is not only silent on Dreamers but \nis silent on border security as well--is not a productive way to begin debate. Let's get to the crux of the issue. Let \nRepublicans offer whatever they want on DACA and border security, and we will do the same. The leader supports \nthe proposal by Senator Grassley, which is, essentially, the President's plan. Let's vote on that first. We will have \nseveral bipartisan bills to offer. We should vote on those too. Democrats are focused like a laser on finding a \nbipartisan bill that can pass the Senate to protect the Dreamers. Several moderate Republicans are working toward \nthat as well. The one person who seems most intent on not getting a deal is President Trump. President Trump's \ncontribution to this debate has been to put forward a proposal that contains a vast curtailment of legal immigration, \nfar outside the scope of DACA and border security, and has demanded that the Democrats support it. Instead of \nmaking a proposal in good faith or working with Democrats on a compromise, President Trump is trying to force his \nunpopular, hard-line immigration agenda down the throats of the American people by calling it a DACA bill. The \nPresident's proposal, now the Grassley bill, is so extreme on legal immigration that several Republicans have \nbeen critical of it, including my friends from South Carolina and Arizona. Yet President Trump somehow thinks that \nDemocrats would be to blame for not getting a deal on DACA because we didn't go blindly along with his partisan \nplan--extreme as it is and with no input from Democrats. That will not happen. Only in a Kafkaesque, 1984 world \ncould the Democrats be blamed for the current predicament on DACA. As much as the President wants to turn the \nworld upside down, as much as he wants everyone to just accept what he is saying, the American people know \nbetter. Everyone here knows that President Trump has stood in the way of a bipartisan solution to DACA from the \nvery beginning. Let's take a quick look at the history. First, it was President Trump who terminated the DACA \nProgram last August, not the Democrats and not the Republicans here. Unilaterally, we are in this pickle--worse \nthan a pickle--in this bad situation because President Trump chose to end the DACA Program last August. That \nstands out above anything else. Then President Trump turned his back on not one but two bipartisan immigration \nproposals. I went so far as to put the wall--the President's signature campaign issue--on the table for discussion. \nThat still did not drive him to a deal. Finally, now that we are working hard in the Senate to come up with a \nbipartisan proposal, President Trump is just trying to gum up the works. According to reports, President Trump may \nthreaten to veto legislation that doesn't match his hard-line demands--``my way or no way'' and with no Democratic \ninput. A statement this morning from the White House said the President would oppose even a short-term bill to \nprotect the Dreamers. So who is intent on kicking out these people who know no country but America, who work in \nour factories and offices, who go to our schools, who serve in our military? Who is intent on kicking them out? It is \nnot the American people, as 90 percent want to support the Dreamers. It is not any Democrat and not a good \n\n\n\nnumber of Republicans on that side of the aisle. It is just the President. On three separate occasions, President \nTrump has stood in the way of a bipartisan solution to DACA--a problem he created in the first place. Yet the \nPresident is in this dream world. He thinks: Oh, I can blame the Democrats for the impasse. As I said, only in a \n1984 world where up is down and black is white could this be true. Only in a 1984 world where up is down and \nblack is white would the American public blame the Democrats for this. They know where Trump stands. They know \nit. The American people know what is going on. They know that this President not only created the problem but \nseems to be against every solution that might pass because it is not 100 percent of what he wants. If, at the end of \nthis week, we are unable to find a bill that can pass--I sincerely hope that is not the case, due to the good efforts of \nso many people on both sides of the aisle--the responsibility will fall on the President's shoulders and on those in \nthis body who went along with him. Bipartisan negotiations are ongoing and are, perhaps, very close to a \nconclusion. Nothing is ever certain given the contentious nature of this debate, but I am hopeful that Senators can \nput the President's hard-line demands to the side and come up with a deal that works for both parties. If we want to \ngo beyond border security and the DACA kids, let's do comprehensive reform. We did it once. It worked pretty well \nin the Senate, but the House blocked it. Let's go back to it. First, the issues at hand are the DACA kids and border \nsecurity. That is the only thing that can pass this Chamber--the only thing. We need to push through to the finish \nline. There are only 2 days of debate remaining this week. Everyone has to make a final effort to reach consensus. \nThat doesn't mean adding new demands or drawing lines in the sand. It means being willing to compromise and \ntake yes for an answer. If we pass something, it might not be everything that either the Democrats want or \neverything that the Republicans want, but it may get the job done for the Dreamers and the overwhelming majority \nof Americans who would like to see them stay in the country. Republican Tax Bill Mr. President, on another matter-\n-taxes--our Republican friends argued that their massive corporate tax cut was not such a huge giveaway to \ncorporate America. They predicted that corporations would spend the tax savings on benefits for workers. The \nevidence is already mounting that those predictions were wrong. Since the passage of the Republican tax bill, \ncorporations have been pouring billions of dollars into stock repurchasing programs, not into significant wage \nincreases or other meaningful investments in workers. These stock buybacks--this stock repurchasing--which \nbenefit, primarily, the people at the top have reached a significant milestone. Since the passage of the Republican \ntax bill, there have been over $100 billion in stock buybacks. As of last week, corporations had announced twice the \nnumber of corporate share buybacks as during a similar period last year. Let me repeat that. The number of \ncorporate share buybacks has doubled since the Republican tax bill passed. Why is that so significant? It is that \nshare buybacks don't help the average worker. They inflate the value of a company's stock, which primarily benefits \nshareholders, not workers. It benefits corporate executives, who are compensated with corporate stock, not \nworkers, who are paid by wages and benefits. The money corporations spend on repurchasing their stock is money \nthat is not being reinvested in worker training, equipment, research, new hires, or higher salaries. According to \nanalysts at Morgan Stanley, companies that were surveyed said they will pass only 13 percent of the Trump tax cut \nsavings on to workers in comparison to 43 percent that they will spend on share buybacks. For manufacturers, it is \neven worse: 9 percent to go to workers, 47 percent to share buybacks. The Republicans made a conscious \ndecision to give corporations and the wealthiest Americans the lion's share [[Page S933]] of the tax cuts and \npromised it would trickle down to everyone else. Unfortunately, trickle-down never works, and it is not what is \nhappening now. Corporate America is doing what is best for corporate America, and working America is getting left \nbehind. It goes to show you just who President Trump and the Republicans were working for when they crafted their \ntax bill. They gave corporations and the wealthiest Americans a huge tax cut and cut out everybody else. I yield \nthe floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is \nimmigration week in the U.S Senate, and we are preparing today's procedural moves to bring bills to the floor for \nconsideration as early as today, perhaps tomorrow at the latest. It is an unusual time when the Senate is focused \non such an issue and actual bipartisan amendments and substitutes are being offered. We are at this point at this \nmoment in time because of a decision by President Trump on September 5 of last year when he announced he was \nending the DACA Program. DACA was a program created by President Obama by Executive order, which allowed \nthose who had been brought to the United States as children, infants, and toddlers to be able to stay legally in the \nUnited States on a temporary visa renewable every 2 years. It was called DACA, and 780,000 young people \nstepped up and paid the filing fee of almost $500, went through a criminal background check and an interview and \nreceived DACA protection. They then went on with their lives, with 90 percent of them going to work or to school, \nenlisting in the military--undocumented in America, willing to hold up their hands and take an oath that they would \ndie for America. That is how much they love this country. Twenty thousand of them went to work as school teachers \n\n\n\nacross the United States of America. Perhaps they are teaching your children or grandchildren today. They are \ndoing important things in this country. But President Trump announced last September 5 that the program that \nprotects them and allows them to work will end. Then he challenged us. He said to the Senate and the House: Do \nsomething about it. Pass a law. Isn't that what you are there for? The President is right. That is our job. This week \nwe are going to try to pass a law to end this crisis, which is going to reach a head on March 5 of this year when the \nDACA Program officially ends and 1,000 young people a day lose their protection. We have less than 3 weeks. So \nwe are going to move today, I hope, or tomorrow or this week, at some point to consider some alternatives to solve \nthis problem. I am sorry to say that there is no plan in the U.S House of Representatives to even address the \nproblem--none. I don't understand it. They know that lives hang in the balance, and they know that overwhelmingly \nthe American people want to give DACA and the Dreamers a chance. The numbers come rolling in; 75, 80, 85 \npercent of Americans agree that these young people should be given a chance to earn their way to legal status \nand citizenship. Even 60 percent of those who voted for President Trump agree with what I just said. It is a popular \npolitical issue on both sides, and it also is the right thing to do. What the President has proposed as his alternative, \nfrom my point of view, is unacceptable. Let me tell you why. Two weeks ago the White House released a one-page \nframework on immigration reform and border security. The White House claimed that this is a compromise \nbecause it includes a path to citizenship for Dreamers--some of them. That, of course, as I mentioned, is supported \nby a majority of Americans. The reality is that the Trump plan would put the administration's entire hard-line \nimmigration agenda on the backs of these young people. These young, DACA-protected people are being held as \npolitical hostages for President Trump's hard-line immigration agenda. For example, the White House wants to \ndramatically reduce legal immigration by prohibiting American citizens from sponsoring their parents, siblings, and \nchildren as immigrants. We are talking about literally millions of relatives of American citizens who entered this \nsystem legally and are following our immigration laws. Some have been waiting for as long as 20 years to \nimmigrate to the United States. The conservative Cato Institute says the following about President Trump's \nproposal: In the most likely scenario, the new plan [from the Trump administration] would cut the number of legal \nimmigrants by up to 44 percent or a half million immigrants annually--the largest policy-driven immigration cut \nsince the 1920s. Compared to current law, it would exclude nearly 22 million people from the opportunity to \nimmigrate legally to the United States over the next five decades. You have to go back in history to a time when \nthere was a proposal that passed on the floor of this Chamber that cut as many legal immigrants to the United \nStates. The year was 1924. Calvin Coolidge was President of the United States. We had just seen the end of World \nWar I. There was a growing fear that because of all of the damage that was done in Europe, Europeans would \ncome to the United States. There was also a concern that the wrong people were coming to the United States, in \nthe eyes of some of the Members of Congress. The Immigration Act of 1924 passed, and it set quotas for \ncountries, and it set quotas for people. It was expressly designed to exclude certain people from around the world \nfrom entering the United States of America. It was a notorious piece of legislation. Those who were to be excluded \nfrom America included people from Italy, Eastern Europe, Japan, Asia, and Jewish people. That was the \nimmigration policy of the United States of America because of that bill in 1924. That is the last time this Chamber \nhas made such a dramatic cut in legal immigration to America. It was a source of embarrassment for decades. \nThe United States established quotas and said: We want America to look a lot different than it would look if other \nimmigrants came to this country. Thankfully, in 1965, it was changed. Thankfully, we gave up the quotas that had \nbeen criticized roundly as being insensitive to the realities of the world population and the reality of the population of \nAmerica. Now the Trump administration wants to cut legal immigration to the United States again, by 44 percent, \nthe biggest cut--as the Cato Institute tells us--since that horrible bill was passed in 1924. Let me tell you what else \nthe Trump immigration proposal would do. It would create an unaccountable slush fund of $25 billion of American \ntaxpayers' money for a border wall that, as I remember correctly, Mexico was supposed to pay for--$25 billion. I \nhave to double check, but I think that is almost the annual appropriation for the National Institutes of Health. The \nPresident wants $25 billion and wants no strings attached. He wants to be able to spend it where, when, and how \nhe wants. That is an invitation for fraud and waste. It is an invitation for money to be spent for something other than \nits purpose. It is an invitation for taxpayers to be the ultimate losers with this slush fund for President Trump's \nfamous Mexican wall. The President's proposal on immigration, in the midst of the worst refugee crisis on record in \nthe world, is now calling for fast-track deportations without due process of women and children fleeing gang and \nsexual violence. I can't tell you how many times we have had this conversation with members of the Trump \nadministration. They create a scenario. The scenario is of a 6-year-old child who is swooped up in some Central \nAmerican country. The parents give thousands of dollars, their life savings, to a smuggler who says: I will get this \n\n\n\nchild to the border of the United States. The child is then taken off by the smuggler in a car or truck or bus to the \nborder. The child then comes out of the car, is pointed toward one of our Federal employees with the Border Patrol, \nand the child walks up and hands a piece of paper to the Border Patrol agent with the name of someone in the \nUnited States. That process then unfolds, and the child ultimately, in many cases, ends up with that relative while a \ndecision is made about the status of the child. Is there exploitation in this system? You bet there is. Is there abuse \nin this system? For sure. Is there actual human trafficking taking place? Yes. [[Page S934]] Are atrocities committed \nagainst these children in the course of this journey? All true. Should we be dedicated to cleaning this up? Sign me \nup, on a bipartisan basis. Let me tell you another scenario, another story that has a different origin than turning over \na child to a smuggler. Let me tell you about cases we know of in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala where, \nbecause of the rampant crime, gang activity, and violence that takes place, parents, desperate to save their \nchildren--some of whom have daughters who have been victims of rape by these gangs--send them to the United \nStates in the hope that they can save their lives. They show up at the border, having lived in fear of this violence in \ntheir countries, and they are accepted into the United States to determine whether that fear can be established in a \nhearing. These are two different cases--a little child being exploited by a smuggler, a young girl escaping violence \nand perhaps death because her parents have nowhere to turn to save her life. Should we treat them both the \nsame? I don't think so. Historically, we have said that when it comes to asylum seekers, who come to this country \nwith a credible fear for their own lives, the United States has given them a chance to be protected. We have said \nthat over and over again. We said it to the Cubans who were escaping Fidel Castro. We have said it to the Soviet \nJews who wanted to have freedom of religion and came to the United States, believing this was the only chance \nthey had in the world. The Trump immigration proposal does not make a clear distinction on those two cases. In \nfact, what it does is end up with fast-track deportations without due process. Accepting the Trump approach will \nliterally return many of these folks who have come to our border to harm and in some cases death. There are fast-\ntrack deportations in the Trump proposal without due process for millions who have overstayed their visas. An \nestimated 40 percent of the 11 million undocumented fit in this category. So even if they have no criminal record, \nwithout considering their legal claims to remain in the United States, they would be deported. It dramatically cuts \nimmigration from sub-Saharan African countries. We have a diversity visa program. It is far from perfect, but it is a \nprogram that was created years ago, so countries that do not have an opportunity to send people to the United \nStates for legal immigration would have a chance. Immigrants who come from these countries are limited in \nnumber. They have to go through the background checks, criminal background checks, biometric investigations--all \nof the investigations and interviews that we would expect in order to make sure we do everything humanly possible \nto cull out those who would be any danger to the United States. They face that same scrutiny, and they should. \nMany of them are rejected. They can't make the case for their lives and what they have done with them, and they \nare not given a chance to come. The President wants to eliminate the diversity visa program. For those living in \nsub-Saharan African countries, huge countries, about 12,000 to 15,000 come to the United States each year \nthrough this program. By eliminating this program, the Trump administration sadly is going to deny those \nimmigrants from Africa even a chance to apply for this opportunity. In the past, many Democrats have been willing \nto support some of the President's proposals, changes in our immigration system, eliminating the diversity visa \nlottery, but when we made that offer 5 years ago, it was part of comprehensive immigration reform with give and \ntake and compromise that tried to make sense out of senseless immigration laws. In 2013, a Democratic-led \nSenate passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill with a strong bipartisan vote of 68 to 32. The bill was a \nproduct of months of negotiations, with committee and floor debate. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership in the \nHouse of Representatives refused to even consider the bill. Now we are being asked to accept the administration's \nproposal with no conditions, no compromise, no give and take; rather, take it or leave it. Democrats have shown \nthey want to comprehensively fix our broken immigration system, but right now we have to fix our focus on the \nDACA crisis created by President Trump with his announcement of September 5. That has to be our priority. In the \nnext day or two, we expect the so-called Grassley proposal, which is the Trump immigration plan, to come to the \nfloor. I want to say for the record, Democrats support comprehensive immigration reform, but we will not stand by \nand a\n\nllow Dreamers to be held political hostage to the administration's entire immigration agenda. I yield the floor. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The senior \nassistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \n\n\n\nordered. Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I come to the floor out of great concern for America's Dreamers, whose \nfutures hinge on the ability of this body to keep its word and get something done. I want to be clear whom we are \ntalking about when we talk about Dreamers. We aren't talking about criminals. We aren't talking about terrorists. We \naren't talking about ``bad hombres.'' We are talking about kids as American as apple pie. As I often say, the only \ncountry they call home is the United States. The only flag they pledge allegiance to is that of the American flag. The \nonly national anthem they know how to sing is the ``Star-Spangled Banner.'' We are talking about 800,000 young \npeople who were brought to this country as children and were able to obtain legal protection under the Deferred \nAction for Childhood Arrivals Program, known as DACA. These kids put enormous faith in our government. They \ncame out of the shadows, they passed background checks, and they registered with our government--all to get a 2-\nyear renewable work permit and protection from deportation. Even the Cato Institute, which is a conservative think \ntank, says that deporting Dreamers--91 percent of whom are gainfully employed-- would hurt America's economy. \nAt the same time, we are also talking about thousands of additional Dreamers who were eligible for DACA but didn't \napply. Some couldn't afford the cost and others were still working through the lengthy application process. These \nare the Dreamers the White House Chief of Staff John Kelly called lazy asses. Well, Mr. Kelly, here is what you \ndon't understand: The reason they didn't apply is not because they were lazy. In fact, in many cases, they didn't \napply because they were afraid--afraid of people like you. They were afraid that if they came out of the shadows \nand registered with the government, they would end up on a short list for deportation. What is depressing is that this \nadministration's actions have proven them right. Now DACA recipients and undocumented Dreamers alike fear they \nhave a target on their back, and that is because President Trump put an expiration date on their dreams when he \ndecided to end DACA. Now, let me be clear, DACA was never perfect, and it was never a replacement for truly \ncomprehensive immigration reform. Make no mistake, we still need comprehensive immigration reform, and I \nam committed as ever to that cause--a cause I have spent the better part of my congressional career trying to \nachieve. I was a member of the Gang of 8 in the Senate back in 2013 when a bipartisan supermajority in the \nSenate passed the most historic reforms to our immigration system since the days of President Ronald Reagan, \nonly to die in the House of Representatives without even a vote, but that debate is for another day. That debate is \nfor what President Trump called phase 2. This week, we are not here to debate comprehensive immigration \nreform. We are not here to debate the numerous types of visas that exist under U.S law. We are not here to debate \nhow mayors run their cities or how police officers do their jobs. We are here to protect Dreamers. We are here to \naddress a crisis that President Trump started last September when he ended DACA. That is what this week's \ndebate [[Page S935]] is all about--it is about protecting hard-working, upstanding Dreamers across America from \nbeing deported to countries they haven't stepped foot in since they were in diapers. Now, many of my colleagues \nhave met Dreamers from their States in recent years, and they know the lion's share of these kids can't even \nremember coming here--only growing up here. For the Dreamers who do remember arriving here, they certainly \ndidn't arrive through any decision of their own. They were babies, toddlers, and very young children, and I challenge \nmy colleagues to think of any decision of consequence they made when they were babies, toddlers, and very young \nchildren. I bet you didn't decide what town you lived in, where your parents worked, or what kind of status you had. \nWhen we talk about Dreamers, we are talking about kids who have grown up American in every sense of the word. \nWe are talking about 22,000 New Jerseyans like Parthiv Patel, who came to New Jersey from India when he was 5 \nyears old. He gained DACA status in 2012. He graduated from Drexel Law School in 2016, and he became the first \nDreamer admitted to the New Jersey Bar in 2018. We are also talking about students like Christopher Rios Martine, \na constituent of mine who came here from Colombia at the age of 2. Today he is a junior at Rutgers University with \na 3.74 GPA. He is president of the Management Information Systems Association, and he is interning at Colgate-\nPalmolive. Christopher said: ``I am proud to be a DACA recipient and I plan on contributing as much to this country \nas I possibly can.'' As another Dreamer from New Jersey, Sara Mora, recently wrote: Without DACA her life has \nbecome ``one big question mark''--the question of whether this Congress will act. Will we protect Dreamers who \nhave become integral to our communities, many who are teaching in our schools, who are treating our patients, \nwho are serving proudly in the military of the United States--many are wearing the uniform of the United States, \nrisking their lives on behalf of our country, and yet we talk about deporting them--and many who are starting \nfamilies of their own? That is right. Nearly one-quarter of DACA recipients are the parents of U.S -born American \nchildren. That is whom we are talking about this week. We are not talking about criminals. We are not talking about \nterrorists. We are not talking about gangbangers or drug dealers. We are talking about Dreamers. They are not \nundocumented immigrants, from my perspective; they are undocumented Americans who have proven themselves \nworthy of the American dream. Yet the administration slapped an arbitrary expiration date on their dream, creating a \n\n\n\ncrisis that Congress needs to solve. I took President Trump at his word when he said he wanted to treat Dreamers \nwith heart, just as I took Leader McConnell at his word when he said this week would be about protecting them from \ndeportation. Now, as I listen to many of my Republican colleagues on the Senate floor, I am hearing less and less \nabout Dreamers and more and more about spending tens of billions of taxpayer dollars on a wall President Trump \npromised Mexico would pay for. Considering the Trump administration's own report noting that illegal border \ncrossings from Mexico have dropped to their lowest level in nearly 50 years, you have to question the wisdom of a \nmultibillion-dollar wall--a wall between the United States and a country that serves as our second largest export \nmarket in the world for American goods and services, as Mexican consumers and businesses buy American goods \nand services that support jobs created here at home. Likewise, I am hearing a whole lot about politically loaded \nterms like ``merit-based immigration'' and ``chain migration.'' These aren't terms you find in our laws. They are \npolitical catchphrases designed to incite fear and push policies that forever change how legal immigration works \nin the United States. The more insidious, of course, is the term ``chain migration.'' I am appalled when I hear my \ncolleagues talking about chain migration, just like I am appalled that the media--even the so-called liberal media--\nhas adopted this phrase as if it is actually a legitimate term, and I can't be the only one who thinks the term ``chain \nmigration'' is downright insulting to the millions of Americans whose ancestors were actually brought to this country \nin chains. Now, I have heard a lot about family values from my Republican colleagues throughout my time in \nCongress. The Republican Party has long claimed to be the party of so-called family values. Well, ``chain \nmigration'' is a term that dehumanizes families. When we want to dehumanize something, we create an inanimate \nobject, but this chain is about a mother and a father and a son and a daughter. It is not an inanimate object, but it is \na dehumanizing term. It is a term designed to make our system of legal immigration and family reunification sound \nthreatening and illogical, but there is nothing threatening about uniting mothers and fathers, and there is nothing \nmore common sense than uniting brothers and sisters and sons and daughters. They are not linked by chains. They \nare bound by blood and held together by love. Families are the essence of American values in our society. Families \nare the glue that builds strong communities--the foundation of our country. Yet some of my Republican colleagues \nact as if the nuclear family is a concept that has an expiration date. Well, I loved my daughter since the day she was \nborn and the day she turned 21 and the day she turned 30, the same as I do my son. I didn't love them less with \neach passing year. I don't love them any less now that they have gotten married; in fact, I love them more. So \nAmericans need to know that when Republicans speak of ending chain migration, they are talking about ending the \nlegal right of U.S citizens to legally sponsor family members in our immigration system. It is not chain migration; it \nis family reunification. That is what America is all about. That is what immigration policy for the past century has \nbeen about--keeping families together, not tearing them apart. The reality is, most Americans are, in some ways, \nthe beneficiary of family reunification. Without it, our country would be a very different place. End family \nreunification, and we would never have seen the leadership of individuals like Colin Powell, a general and Secretary \nof State. That is right. His parents wouldn't have been able to come here without the big bad chain migration that \nmy colleagues in the majority decry today. End family reunification and suddenly billion-dollar American technology \ncompanies like Kingston Technology would have never existed. Before John Tu was a billion-dollar businessman, \nhe was a self- described mediocre student from China. He would have never come to America if it were not for the \nsponsorship of his U.S citizen sister. He wasn't skilled when he got here, and yet he built a groundbreaking \ncompany. So let's get real. When President Trump professes his support for merit-based immigration, he doesn't \nhave a real plan for allowing a million engineers and inventors from around the world to come to the United States. \nHe is talking about cutting legal immigration by nearly 50 percent. That is a policy with disastrous implications for \nthe future of this country when you consider basic economic facts. Any credible economist will tell you that without \nsteady immigration, America's global competitiveness will suffer, and we will fall far behind much larger countries \nlike China, Pakistan, and India. According to a Forbes magazine article, even President Donald Trump is a product \nof chain migration. That is right. Friedrich Trump, Donald Trump's grandfather, was able to come to the United \nStates from Germany, with no English-speaking ability and no merit-based skills. Why? Because his sister was \nalready in the United States and claimed him as part of family reunification. You get to be President of the United \nStates because of chain migration. If Republicans were being honest, they would call their term of ``chain \nmigration'' what it really is. They would call it family reunification, but they don't want to call it family reunification \nbecause they don't want to own up to their intention, which is to strip U.S citizens of the right to sponsor their \nbrothers and sisters, mothers [[Page S936]] and fathers, and adult children as immigrants. I ask my colleagues to \nplease give it a rest. If you want to have a debate about the merits of our immigration system, we can have that \ndebate, but that debate over comprehensive immigration reform is not the debate we should have this week. This \n\n\n\ndebate is about whether we will do right by American Dreamers, about whether we will listen to the voices of the \nAmerican people who overwhelmingly want us to solve this crisis. According to the latest polls out this week from \nQuinnipiac University, 81 percent of Americans support giving Dreamers a path to citizenship. Yet, week after \nweek, month after month, Dreamers have languished in uncertainty. Republicans didn't let us protect them in \nSeptember or October or November or December or January. Yet, throughout all this time wasted, I hear my \ncolleagues in the majority say such nice things about Dreamers--how talented they are, how hopeful they are, how \nimportant they are. I say to them today that it is getting harder and harder to take your commitment to Dreamers \nseriously when, at every opportunity you have to do something, you do nothing. Instead, it is beginning to look like \nPresident Trump--the person responsible for ending DACA--has enablers in Congress who have been intent on \ndeporting Dreamers from day one. If that is not the case, now is the time to prove it because March 5 is just around \nthe corner. Come March, America's Dreamers will see their dreams extinguished, replaced with deportation orders \nto nations they have never called home. So far, there are 19,000 already out of status, and after March 5, there will \nbe 1,000 a day. If my colleagues want to have a debate about comprehensive immigration reform, we can have \nthat debate some other time but not today, not this week, not until we protect Dreamers living in fear of deportation \ndue to President Trump's reckless decisions--a President who once said about Dreamers that ``we're going to work \nsomething out that is going to make people happy and proud.'' Well, the polls show deporting Dreamers will not \nmake Americans happy and proud. The time for talk is over. The time for kind words is over. The time for excuses \nis over. So, this week, Congress needs to take action. It is time we let America see who stands with Dreamers and \nwho is complicit in their potential deportation. These young men and women have shown incredible courage and \nstrength in the face of adversity and uncertainty. They were handed a crisis, and they created a movement. They \nshared their stories and their dreams, and, in doing so, they have captured the hearts of the American people. I \nurge my colleagues in the Senate not to break America's heart because our hearts are bigger as a country and our \nfuture is brighter when Dreamers in this country stay right where they belong. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING \nOFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from North Carolina. Valentine's Day Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, in a moment, \nI am going to talk about the immigration debate we are going to have here. Before I do that, though, I want to \nrecognize that this is Valentine's Day. I happen to be several hundred miles away from my sweetheart, but I want to \nwish my wife a happy Valentine's Day. I made her a little card. I am sure I probably just violated a rule, but I don't \nthink anybody can fire me. I want my wife to know I love her and wish I was with her. Now, Mr. President, I want to \ntalk a little about immigration reform. We just heard a discussion. I tell you, sometimes I think I teleport from this \nChamber to the Kennedy Center because there are more theatrics going on here than you can find down there on \nany given day. Let me give you one example of that. The whole indignant position that the Member from New \nJersey just had on ``chain migration'' and somehow that mean Republicans came up with this term because we \nwanted to make a point. Demographers came up with this term decades ago. People on the other side of the aisle \neven have references to chain migration in bills they proposed. End the theatrics. Solve this problem. Let's talk \nabout the President's framework. I was presiding just before I got up here. I heard the word ``hard-line'' used--the \nhard- line demand of President Trump. I don't agree with everything President Trump has done. In fact, I said a \nyear and a half ago--and I got criticized for it--that when you sit down and talk border patrol and talk homeland \nsecurity, you are going to find out you don't need a large, monolithic wall from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of \nMexico. After the President was elected and after he got into office, he listened to homeland security and border \npatrol, and he came up with a plan that isn't a long, monolithic wall across the southern border. It is a strategic plan \nthat actually lets us improve the security of the homeland along the northern and southern borders. It is a plan that \ntries to confiscate tons of drugs that are poisoning Americans in the tens of thousands of every year. It is a plan \nthat makes sure gang members are more likely to be incarcerated when they cross the border illegally and less \nlikely to go into the very communities that many of the people who immigrate to this country go into. It is a plan to \nmake those communities safer. It is a plan to make sure we know the thousands of people that cross the border \nillegally are not carrying illicit drugs in a truck or car or a wheel well, the way they do it today, because it is using \ntechnology to be able to search more vehicles to make sure our homeland is safe. It is also a plan that shows more \ncompassion than President Obama's DACA plan. Right now, they are saying: Let's keep DACA going. Well, there \nare 690,000 people who are in DACA. Their future is uncertain because it is an Executive order. It doesn't have the \nforce of law. It could possibly be challenged by the court. The President decided on September 15 of last year, \nCongress do your job. You have been talking about immigration reform for two decades. We have an arguably \nillegal Executive order by President Obama that President Trump kept in place for about a year, and then he said: I \nam going to give you all 6 months to do your job and come up with something that has enduring value. The DACA \n\n\n\nproposal only provided the illegally present persons who came to this country--through the decisions of an adult--\nsome certainty that they wouldn't be deported. It doesn't give them any certainty in terms of a path to citizenship. \nPeople said the President has a hard- line plan. DACA allows 690,000 people who signed up for it to be here and, \nhopefully, not have that decision thrown out by the courts or have the President rescind it. What we just heard from \nthree or four Members on the other side of the aisle is that the President's hard-line plan is to have nearly three \ntimes as many people with a path to citizenship, not a piece of paper that hopefully will be in place for the time you \nspend in the United States but citizenship. So the President's hard-line plan actually legalizes about two and a half \ntimes as many people, not to just let them be here present, to have legal status but have a path to citizenship. That \nis hard-line? I am not sure the President was there when he was running for office, but he listened. He recognizes \nhe wants to be the President who gets something done, and he is willing to accept the criticism from people on my \nside of the aisle who may not support a path to citizenship. I do, and the President does. I find it remarkable that \nsomebody would say a President, who has endorsed a bill to provide a path to citizenship to 1.8 million people--two \nand a half times more than President Obama provided a temporary and passing status to--is hard-line. Border \nsecurity. Why is border security important? Is it just purely a hard-line deportation force sending people out? No. I \nalready talked about, No. 1, hundreds of millions of doses of heroin, fentanyl, and other illicit drugs come across our \nborder every year. We simply do not have the people, technology, and infrastructure to interdict them. Of the $25 \nbillion, about $18 billion of it would be spent for border security. About 10 percent to 15 percent [[Page S937]] of \nthat is on the northern border. The remainder is on the southern border. Some of that will be spent on wall \nstructures. When all is said and done, less than half of the 2,300 miles will have a wall structure. The rest will be \nspent on training additional personnel. If you have ever gone to a border crossing, you know the long lines they \nhave there. This is actually creating technology that has low-intensity x rays where you could drive a vehicle \nthrough. The Border Patrol folks can identify human smugglers, human traffickers, and drug smugglers without ever \nhaving the person get out of the car. That is what the border security plan is focused on as well. There are wall \nstructures where they make sense. They don't make sense along about half of the border. Let me tell you about the \nhumanitarian case for this, which I find remarkable no one on the other side of the aisle will bring up. I went to \nTexas last year. I went along the southern border. I was on the Rio Grande, on the Border Patrol boats, on \nhorseback, and at night I took ATVs around. I heard a lot of stories by a lot of people, including property owners. \nOver the last 20 years, 10,000 people have died trying to cross our border on U.S soil. We have no earthly idea \nhow many tens of thousands of people die just trying to get there. So 10,000 people died over the last 20 years \nbecause we didn't know where they were. They were on American soil, but we didn't know where they were. About \n1,000 of them were children. If that is not a case for needing to know who is crossing the border and where they \nare--even if they may get deported if they don't have a legitimate claim to asylum but have this threat to their safety-\n-then I don't know what else is. I don't see how border security is hard-line when you look at the facts--not the \ntheater but the facts. I think that second pillar of the President's proposal is balanced. It is less than what he \noriginally wanted, but it makes sense, and it shows a lot of movement on his part. Again, two and a half times the \nnumber of people are actually getting a path to citizenship--more than the DACA Executive order proposed--and it \nhas border security that makes sense and is no longer this idea of a monolithic wall. We heard somebody say there \nis a dramatic cut to legal immigration; that the promise we made to everybody who is in line because of a family \nrelationship is going to be broken. That is utter nonsense. There is no proposal like that on the table. The fact is, \nthere are about 3.9 million people in the backlog who, if the President's proposal is accepted, will get to this country \nin half the time it takes today. There are about 3.9 million people waiting to come to this country because of a family \nrelationship who we have proposed--that the President has proposed--should be able to get here sooner. The \ndiversity lottery is also something, I think, people have been misled or they are trying to mislead you. I will leave it to \nyou to decide. The diversity lottery is not ending. This actually comes up with a reasonable way to use those 50,000 \ngreen cards in a way that lets us draw down the backlog sooner--instead of having somebody wait 17 years or 20 \nyears to get into the country, maybe 8 or 9, but then it is also with a focus on the underrepresented countries. There \nare many countries in Africa--about 15,000--that we would like to make sure they have an opportunity every year to \ncome to this country. They are from an underrepresented country. We have already made proposals that said we \nare open to other proposals to make that be a part of how the diversity lottery gets settled. So 50,000 will continue \nto come. When we say we are ending the diversity lottery, we are not saying we will end the entry of 50,000 people; \nwe are talking about modernizing it. The last time we did any major immigration bill, I was 5 years old. I think it is \nabout time to look at how the world has changed and maybe open your eyes and open your hearts to a better way \nto do it that benefits the person trying to come to this country and benefits our country as a result of their entry. I \n\n\n\nthink it can be a win-win. The last thing on chain migration is, I want to go back and find everybody who voted for \nbills in the past, and they voted for a bill with legislative language in it that referred to chain migration. I am sick of \nthat kind of garbage on the Senate floor. That is just misleading. Chain migration is just a process that has been \nused in the past--not only by our country but other countries--to kind of link people together. I am absolutely \nsympathetic with some of the things the gentleman from New Jersey said, but to say that this is some hateful, \ndivisive term is not paying a whole lot of attention to your job. I have only been here 3 years. Many of these people \nwho are here voted for language that had chain migration in it, and now they are saying it is something the hateful \nfolks in our marketing departments created to be divisive. That is just untrue. Now the last thing. When we are \ntalking about legal immigration in this country--we immigrate about 1 million to 1.1 million people a year to this \ncountry. I don't have a problem with that number. If I had Members on the other side of the aisle, some of my \ncolleagues, say, ``Thom, we want to try to maintain that same amount of immigration over time,'' I would say that I \nam open to it. Some of my colleagues I have worked with on this bill may not be. But the way we go about doing it \nneeds to be modernized. How many times have I heard that when we have a foreign national here who graduates \nwith an engineering degree or some degree in STEM, that we should just staple a green card to the back of their \ndiploma--how many times have we heard that?--because we need high-end workers. We need welders. We need \ncarpenters. We need plumbers. We need people to come to this country to fill jobs, or at some point, our economic \ngrowth is going to be limited by the number of resources we have for those jobs. Our unemployment is going down. \nThe demand for the workers is there. But we have an immigration system where about three-fourths of everybody \nwho comes to this country comes purely because of a family relationship. I bet that if we dig into it, many of them \nactually could qualify on the basis of merit, but right now, it is just a random selection that doesn't really tie to our \nneeds as a nation and for our economic growth or for our economic security. I believe that if we get the \nimmigration policy right, over the next 10 years, we will be building a case to have more legal immigration here, \nmore than the 1 million or 1.1 million, but if we don't fix this, we are not going to fix the underlying problem with our \nimmigration system. I actually didn't plan on speaking. I just grabbed a couple of these slides so that I could talk \nabout it. But it is very important to me for us to--I don't like being a part of an organization that talks a lot and doesn't \nget anything done, and over the last 17 years, that is all these folks have been doing. They say: Reelect me. I \npromise you that next year, I will get immigration reform done. Next year, I will file the Dream Act, and we will get \nit done. Well, guess what. It hasn't gotten done under a Republican administration. President Bush was sympathetic \nto this issue. He couldn't get it done. Congress couldn't get it done. President Obama comes in and says: I am \ngoing to fix immigration. President Obama had the votes to pass ObamaCare. There was a time in this Chamber \nwhen not a single Republican vote was necessary to pass a bill out of here, right? So if you don't need a single \nRepublican vote in Congress, on the House or the Senate side, why didn't you get it done? Because I don't think \nyou have taken the time to construct something that makes sense, that is compassionate, that is responsible, and \nthat will have the enduring value of law. So now is the time to get it done, and the only way we are going to get it \ndone is with bipartisan cooperation. If you don't like some of the elements of the President's framework and you set \na hammer to it, fold your hands, and say: If you will not vote on mine, I will not vote on yours--look at this and tell us \nhow we can improve it. Tell us what we need to do to get a vote. Tell us what we can do to moderate this. To call \nthis a hardline bill is absurd. It is theatrics. It is the kind of stuff that has prevented us from getting things done for \nthe last 17 years. I hope people will have an honest discussion and debate. I hope people will come down here, \noffer all the amendments they want to, and I hope they [[Page S938]] will be mature enough, if they fail, to move on \nto the next one because I, for one, want to provide certainty to the DACA population. I say to the Presiding Officer, \nyou know better than I because you are in the Marine Reserves. There are 900 people serving in the military today-\n-that is more than a battalion, right? We have more than 900 DACA recipients serving in the military. I want to file \nthis bill. I want to get this bill to the President's desk and say to them: Welcome to this country. Thank you for your \nservice. I can't wait to go to your ceremony where you swear the oath as an American citizen. That is what we can \ndo this week. But I guarantee you, anybody who sits here and says that the President's proposal is unfair and \ninsincere and hardline is playing politics. It makes me wonder if some of them would just as soon have this be the \n``if you elect me next year, I promise I will fix this problem'' campaign speech versus take this off the table, provide \nthem certainty, and do something different for a change. Finally, I started by wishing my wife a happy Valentine's \nDay. When I get into these speeches--I worked in business most of my career. I haven't been in politics very long. I \nget very frustrated with the lack of production and with the lack of results. But, Sweetie, I am not mad. I just get a \nlittle bit intense when I talk about an issue where the solution is within reach. I am not mad. I am frustrated with the \nMembers of the U.S Senate who don't see the opportunity to seize this moment and get it done. Mr. President, \n\n\n\nthank you for the opportunity. I probably went long, and I apologize to anybody else who may be waiting to speak. \nBut this is the week to get it done. This is the Congress to get it done. This is the President who has given us a \nhistoric opportunity. I hope we seize the day. Thank you, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The \nPRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. \nWithout objection, it is so ordered. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is debating the fate of our Nation's \nDreamers this week. Everywhere I go, people recognize the uncontestable truth that underpins our discussion: We \nare all a nation of immigrants. Unless you are Native American, you come from a line of people who come from \nsomewhere else. More than in any other country on Earth, this simple fact is a defining characteristic of our national \nidentity. Throughout our history, immigrant communities have greatly enriched our Nation; their individual stories \nhave become the American story. Out of many, we have become one. My maternal grandparents emigrated from \nItaly, began a business, hired a lot of people, and were pillars of the community. My wife's parents emigrated from \nFrench-speaking Canada and also owned a business. She was born in Vermont. Yesterday, we buried my wife's \nuncle, an immigrant from Canada who started off as an $8-a-week clerk at a shoe store. He was buried with honors \nat the age of 100 yesterday, and people talked about the $20 million or $30 million he has given to philanthropic \ncauses in Vermont--this $8-a-week immigrant clerk at a shoe store. I think sometimes we forget who we are. In the \nlate 1800s we passed laws excluding Chinese immigrants. During World War II, we turned away Jewish refugees \nfleeing the Holocaust--turned them away at the shores of our country--and many went back to die in the gas \nchambers. We know today that these were tragic mistakes, fueled by our own ill-informed, xenophobic rhetoric. \nMistakes were made, but they must never be repeated. Yet now, in 2018, I am concerned that we are hearing \nechoes of past mistakes. Anti-immigrant voices, armed with the same shameful fearmongering, are attempting a \ncomeback in our country. In recent months, Dreamers have been regularly disparaged. Some have even suggested \nthat Dreamers pose a risk of terrorism or have links to international drug trafficking. These absurd depictions would \nbe laughable if they weren't so damaging, especially to those of us who remember one of the biggest terrorist \nattacks on our country, in Oklahoma City by Timothy McVeigh, who was not an immigrant; he grew up there and \nwas born there. Thankfully, most Americans know better. Dreamers are not threats to our national security; not a \nsingle one--not a single one--has been suspected of terrorist activities. Nor do Dreamers present a threat to public \nsafety. Far from it. By definition, Dreamers are law-abiding strivers who seek only to contribute to our country. \nBrought here as children, Dreamers are now our neighbors, our first responders, our teachers, our medical \npersonnel. Nearly 1,000 have served in our Armed Forces, risking their lives to defend the only country they have \never known as home. I will never forget one Dreamer who wrote to me last year. Dr. Juan Conde is a DACA \nrecipient. He is a resident of Vermont. He was born in Mexico and brought to the United States as a young child by \nhis mother. In 2007, tragically, his mother died of cancer. Showing remarkable courage and determination for a \nyoung man, Dr. Conde was motivated by this personal tragedy to help cancer patients like his mother. He ultimately \nobtained a Ph.D in cancer research from the University of Texas. But as accomplished as he already was, Dr. \nConde was not satisfied with just studying cancer. He wanted to treat the people suffering with and battling the \ndisease. Every one of us in this Chamber knows somebody who has suffered from and battled cancer, and many \nhave died. But only after he enrolled in DACA was Dr. Conde able to attend medical school, and he is currently \ndoing that. He is studying oncology at the University of Vermont's Larner College of Medicine. Dr. Conde hopes to \nspend his life in the United States treating cancer patients and researching to find a cure for the disease. This \nVermonter--and I think all Americans would agree--believes that America is a better place with Dr. Conde in it. \nThere are hundreds of thousands of Dreamers just like Dr. Conde, all with the potential to contribute to our \ncommunities and to our country. To deny them these opportunities because they were brought here as children \nwould be as senseless as it is cruel. We are better than that. And this week, we have an opportunity to prove it. I \nam proud of those in the Senate, both Democrats and Republicans, who are engaged in good-faith negotiations \nover proposals to protect our Dreamers and improve our border security. I sincerely believe that we can find a path \nto 60 votes, and I hope the Republican leadership will let us. The Majority Leader's decision yesterday to seek to \nopen up the debate with a vote on a poison pill amendment about so-called sanctuary cities--which has nothing to \ndo with either Dreamers or border security--was less than a helpful start. These kinds of attempts to score political \npoints stand in stark contrast to the bipartisan search done by leading Republicans and Democrats behind the \nscenes for a solution. As the most senior Member of this body, it is my hope that all Senators will focus on a \nbipartisan solution, not on just divisive distractions. I respect this institution as much as anybody. For 43 years, I \nhave been here and I have seen--and I hope contributed to--the good that can be accomplished. I have often said \n\n\n\nthat at its best the Senate can and should serve as the conscience of the Nation. But it can only do so when we put \naside our own self-interest, and we work across the aisle in the spirit of compromise. I know we are capable of \nmeeting this challenge today. We have done it before. Five years ago, when I was chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, we brought together 68 Senators, Democrats and Republicans, and we voted for an immigration bill \nthat provided protection for Dreamers, including an expedited pathway to citizenship. Unfortunately, the House, \neven though they had the votes to pass it, would not bring it up. Well, it is time now for the Senate to do so again \nand, this time, for the House to follow suit. President Trump claims he will treat Dreamers with great ``heart.'' If he \nmeant what he said, he will certainly sign our bipartisan compromise that emerges. So let's get to work. The future \nof Dreamers-- and the fate of the [[Page S939]] American dream itself--lies in our hands. As I left that funeral \nyesterday in Vermont, I thought of my wife's uncle and her parents coming from Canada to make a better life, my \ngrandparents coming from Italy, and my great grandparents coming from Ireland, all to make such a mark on our \nlittle State of Vermont, all for the better. As a member of that family, how proud I am to stand here on the floor of the \nU.S Senate, but I want to do more than just stand here. I want to vote for a bill to help more people like those who \ncome to our country and to make our country better. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING \nOFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, \nit is so ordered. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today a group led by Chairman Grassley of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee formally introduced a bill to address the DACA issue--the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals issue--\nthat we have heard so much about, as well as border security. I think it is a good starting point, and I am proud to \nbe a cosponsor of the legislation, which is called the Secure and Succeed Act. Perhaps the most important thing \nabout this bill is that it actually has a good chance of becoming law. That is because the President supports it. It \nencompasses the four pillars the President has laid out for us in any solution to the DACA challenge. The Secure \nand Succeed Act provides legal status and a pathway to citizenship for an estimated 1.8 million people who meet \nthe specific criteria of DACA. This is a far larger number than the number of individuals covered by President \nObama's Executive order. The fact is, this President has not only said to the 690,000 DACA recipients ``You are \ngoing to have a better, brighter future and a pathway to American citizenship''; this President has also offered all of \nthe young people eligible but who might not have previously signed up that same opportunity. What an \nextraordinarily generous offer. This bill also provides for a real plan to strengthen border security, utilizing the three \nthings that Border Patrol has always told me are essential: more boots on the ground, better technology, and, yes, \nsome infrastructure in hard-to-control locations, along with enhanced ports of entry. I know there has been some \nconfusion about that. The President likes to talk about the wall. It is true that back in roughly 2006 or 2007, \nCongress called for something called the Secure Fence Act, which got the support of then-Senator Obama, then-\nSenator Hillary Clinton, and, of course, current Senator Chuck Schumer. They supported the Secure Fence Act, as \ndid an overwhelming majority of Senators from both parties. When the President has talked about the wall, he has \nmade pretty clear what he is really talking about is a barrier similar to what was supported on a bipartisan basis. He \nsaid that the Border Patrol is going to have to be able to see through it. Indeed, as he has conceded, in many \nplaces it doesn't make any sense at all to have a physical barrier. That is why technology and boots on the ground \nare so important. This legislation also reallocates visas from the diversity lottery system in a way that is fair and \ncontinues the existing, family-based categories until the current backlog is cleared, which would take, probably, \nabout 10 years. I am proud to cosponsor this commonsense solution. But I know other colleagues have been \nworking hard on their ideas, which I look forward to reviewing as the debate continues. One group I haven't heard \nfrom much, though, is our Democratic colleagues, who literally shut down the government to force this debate to \noccur on their terms and at a time they chose. We are still trying to figure out--OK, you won, in a sense. I think the \nAmerican people lost when you shut down the government, but you made your point. You wanted a time certain \nand you wanted a fair process by which to present your ideas, and we have been waiting--here it is Wednesday, \nwith the clock ticking, still waiting--for that Democratic proposal. What is their plan? What is their proposal? Do they \neven have one? And if they do, why are they leaving the rest of us, as well as the Nation, in the dark? As the \nmajority leader said yesterday, we need to stop trying to score political points and start making law. The way to get \nthis done is to take a proposal like the President's and get started; people can offer amendments to that. Whatever \ngets 60 votes in the Senate passes the Senate, and then it is up to the House to pass it, and then it is up to the \nPresident to decide whether to sign it. He has pretty much given us the outline of what he would find acceptable. \nAgain, insofar as it grants a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million people, that is extraordinary in and of itself. The \nmajority leader made a commitment to hold this debate and to hold it this week. He has lived up to his promise, and \n\n\n\nnow we can't let it all go to waste. As each minute and each hour clicks off the clock, it looks as if it is more and \nmore likely to happen--that all of this will go to waste. The country is watching. The DACA recipients in my home \nState--all 124,000 of them--are watching and worrying, understandably anxious about what their status is going to \nbe when this program ends on March 5. One of those DACA recipients is Julio Ramos, a biology teacher who is \ngetting his master's degree in biomedical informatics. He is from Brownsville, TX, right along the U.S -Mexico \nborder, and he is a DACA recipient. After his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, he decided he wanted to \nbe a doctor. He has even been accepted to Texas medical schools, but he wasn't sure whether he would be \nallowed to attend. He is waiting and watching, worried about his future. Then there is Miriam Santamaria from \nHouston, TX. She graduated from high school in Houston with honors. She paid her way through community \ncollege, and she works as a manager at a construction company and owns her own photography business. She \nsounds like quite an entrepreneur to me. Miriam said: ``I am not looking for any kind of recognition or sympathy, [I'm \njust] looking to make a difference and inspire others.'' She is also looking to live in peace in the only country that \nshe has ever known and calls home. She came to the United States when she was 4 years old. Finally, there is a \nman whom I will just call by the first name of Daniel. He, too, lives in Texas. He graduated from the University of \nNorth Texas with a degree in advertising and contributes productively to society. Daniel came from Mexico at the \nage of 2, and he said: ``All the choices I make, I made as an American, because that's what I am.'' We need to \nlisten to these stories as we consider this legislation and as people are perhaps tempted into the political \ngrandstanding and gamesmanship that, unfortunately, sometimes overwhelms our best intentions. These are real \nhuman lives hanging in the balance. They are important, and they teach us about the real people behind the policy. \nBut their stories are not the only ones we need to listen to. We need to listen to the stories of the men and women \nwho have been waiting patiently for years to come here in a legal way through visas and green cards, waiting \npatiently to join their families here in the United States, doing it the old-fashioned, legal way. They have had to wait, \nsome for years, some for decades. We should listen to the stories of the border communities, which I am proud to \nrepresent in Texas, from men and women, many of whom are of Hispanic origin, who have suffered property \ndamage from illegal immigration. Illegal immigration is a pretty ugly business when you consider that it is in the \nhands of drug cartels and transnational criminal organizations. Recently, one of the military leaders who is \nresponsible for Southern Command, which is Central America south, said that these transnational criminal \norganizations or cartels are ``commodity agnostic.'' That is the phrase he used. He said that they don't care whether \nit is people, drugs, or other contraband. What they are in it for is the money, and they are willing to do [[Page S940]] \nanything for the money. Unfortunately, victims of human trafficking know exactly what I am talking about. Despite \nthese hardships, businesses in many of the communities, like those along the border, are thriving. But we need to \ndo everything we can to make sure that continues to be the case. Sympathy for DACA recipients is right and good \nbecause, in America, we do not punish children for the mistakes of their parents, and we are not going to punish \nthese young people who are now adults and have become part of our communities. But Americans who live along \nthe border in my State realize that illegal immigration has caused real, tangible harm in terms of public safety, \nproperty damage, and their way of life. When I talk to people like Manny Padilla, the Border Patrol's sector chief for \nthe Rio Grande Valley, it is hard not to realize just how much is required and how many more resources we need to \nmaintain situational awareness and operational control along the border. I will say this: The Federal Government \nhas failed over the years to live up to its responsibility to maintain the security of our border, so taxpayers in my \nState have to step up and fill the gap left by the failure of leadership of the Federal Government. But we have an \nopportunity to fix that in this legislation, following the parameters the President has laid out for us. That is why, \nduring this week's debate, ensuring additional resources for border security is an essential piece of the puzzle. That \nincludes areas other than between our ports of entry. Mexico is one of our largest trading partners. We have \nlegitimate trade and commerce that flows back and forth across the border with Mexico and supports 5 million \nAmerican jobs. Unfortunately, the cartels have figured out how to exploit that as well. So, because of antiquated \ninfrastructure and technology at our ports of entry, many of them are vulnerable through the importation of poison--\nliterally, drugs like methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin, and the like--that has taken the lives of so many \nAmericans. We need to do more and better when it comes to maintaining those ports of entry--upgrading the \ninfrastructure, improving the technology--so we can interdict more of that. Again, the border is as varied as \nanyplace in the world, with areas that are flat and open, areas that have mountains and rolling hills, rivers, \nobviously. Technology, as we have come to see, has transformed our way of life, and technology can increasingly \nbe the answer to supplement the boots on the ground and the infrastructure that the Border Patrol thinks are \nnecessary. There is a big difference between detecting illegal immigration in rural areas and urban ones. In urban \n\n\n\nareas, the Border Patrol tells us that you might have just a few seconds before someone can cross the border and \nenter into the United States. In large, open areas, there is more of a lag time, so perhaps a fence or some \ninfrastructure is not as important; technology might be more important, along with the Border Patrol agents \nthemselves. My basic point is that border security is complex. For those who think it is as easy as one, two, three, I \nencourage you to do as some of my colleagues have done; that is, travel to the border--we will host you--to see \nfirsthand why it is crucial that we strengthen our personnel, technology, and infrastructure. That has to be one of our \npriorities, and I am grateful to the President for making this one of his requirements as well. We have an opportunity \nto address not only the anxiety and plight of DACA recipients but also to make our country safer and more secure; \nto reform our legal immigration system in a way that will help us accelerate the reunification of families out of the \nbacklog of people waiting patiently and legally outside of the country to come into the country through legal \nimmigration; and to address the President's concern about the roll of the dice in the diversity lottery that makes \nlittle sense, given our need for people with job-based skills, graduate degrees, and other merit-based criteria that \nwould make them valuable to the United States, in addition to winning the lottery. I hope we will take advantage of \nthis opportunity this week. Time is wasting. It is Wednesday, and we don't have any time to waste at all. I yield the \nfloor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll. The \nsenior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PERDUE. Madam President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so \nordered. Mr. PERDUE. Madam President, I rise to talk about the topic of the week. Although some of us have been \nworking on this for some time, many of us in this body have actually been addressing this for over the last 20 years \nor so. I am new to this body, as I have only been here a few years, but, last year I got involved in this. We are \ndealing with the immigration issue today, not just the DACA issue. Our current immigration system is outdated, \nthreatens our national security, and does not meet the needs of our economy. The issue before the Senate this \nweek is not just about DACA, which is but one manifestation of our broken immigration policies. Rather, President \nTrump, while offering a generous solution for DACA recipients, has proposed a broader solution to our legal \nimmigration system that will ensure that we are not back here in just a few short years to deal with this same \nproblem again. Over the past 11 years, Congress has failed to fix our broken immigration system three times, \nprimarily because it has attempted to solve the entire situation, the comprehensive problem, which would be the \nlegal situation, the temporary work visa problems, and then the illegal situation. The Secure and Succeed Act only \ndeals with our legal immigration policy. From the onset of these negotiations, President Trump has been \nconsistent with what he has wanted as part of any immigration deal that deals with the legal immigration system. \nMonths ago, he gave us a clean framework. He said that any plan that didn't fit that framework would never become \nlaw. The Secure and Succeed Act, which we are dealing with this week, is the only plan that actually fits that \nframework. It is the only plan the President has said he will sign into law. The framework that has been laid out by \nPresident Trump has four parts. First, it provides a solution for the DACA situation and ends the program. It does so \nin a compassionate, responsible way that every Senator on the other side of the aisle should support and has \nsupported at various times. President Trump went out of his way to reach across the aisle to the Democrats when \nhe expanded the population that was being discussed in the DACA situation, and he actually talked about providing \nlong-term certainty for this population group. Second, this bill secures our borders with additional border security \nand a wall where required. It puts $25 billion in a trust fund toward border security and a wall system. This money \nwould be spent over the next few years to provide better national security for our country's borders. It ends policies \nlike catch and release, which encourage more illegal immigration. It makes critical changes to the immigration \ncourt system to clear out backlogs, expedite court hearings, and give law enforcement the resources it needs to do \nits job properly. Third, this bill fixes the flaws in the current immigration system that spurred this DACA problem in \nthe first place and incentivized illegal immigration. It protects the immediate family of the primary worker. Seventy-\ntwo percent of Americans believe immigration should include the primary workers, their spouses, and their \nimmediate children, which is exactly what this bill does. In addition, two-thirds of Americans actually believe that \nthe solution here for illegal immigration includes the DACA fix, an end to chain migration, border security, and an \nend to the diversity lottery--two-thirds. That is from a Harvard poll that was put out several weeks ago, and there are \nothers that actually corroborate that. This bill also expedites the backlog, which is something that was not even \ndiscussed before we brought this bill forward. This bill ensures that the primary family of immediate citizens-- [[Page \nS941]] some of them are recent green card recipients and new citizens who are trying to get their families in--will be \nreunited. But there is a backlog. We have that in this bill and have ensured that the backlog will be taken care of \nand that these families will be reunited, which is what most Americans want. Fourth, the Secure and Succeed Act \n\n\n\nends the archaic visa lottery program. This failed program is dangerous, filled with fraud, and has proven to be an \navenue for terrorists to enter our country. We simply must fix these national security flaws and close the loopholes \nin our current immigration system that incentivize illegal immigration. If we don't deal with these problems that got \nus here in the first place, we will be right back here in just a few short years. This is the President's objective. If we \nare going to deal with it, let's deal with it once and for all on the immigration side and then move on to the \ntemporary work visas and solve that as well. I don't think anybody in this body wants to be back here in a few short \nyears. Many on the other side and on our side have been trying to find a common solution to this for decades. I \nbelieve we have an historic opportunity right now to do something that people in this body have wanted to do for a \nlong time, and that is to solve our legal immigration system in a very compassionate, fair way that will benefit \nevery American. That is why we have to deal with these issues in a responsible and fair way. Politicians have talked \nabout this for far too long. I have discovered, now having been in this body, that it is easy for some to just kick this \ndown the road. It is a great pandering opportunity for one side or the other to blame this on them. Unfortunately, the \nAmerican people deserve better than that. We have a clean opportunity here to do what most people in America \nwant us to do. Other than politics, there is no reason for the Secure and Succeed Act not to have widespread, \nbipartisan support this week in this body. Each part of the Secure and Succeed Act has been supported by many \nDemocrats at various times over the last 30 years. As a matter of fact, in 1994, Barbara Jordan presented the result \nof her bipartisan immigration commission report to then-President Bill Clinton. The recommendations at that time \nwere to change our immigration system from our current country caps and chain migration system to more of a \nskills-based system like those seen in Canada and Australia. They knew then the flaws that were included in our \nimmigration law that was written in 1965 that actually incentivized illegal immigration. Unfortunately, it seems that \nbecause these ideas are now being put forward by President Donald Trump, the Democrats, all of a sudden, \ndisagree with these principles. President Trump has crafted a deal that is tough but more than generous. Nobody \nasked him to expand the number or to even talk about certainty in the long term. He has brought that forward \nbecause he wants this done. He wants this solved. He wants this ended right now. The Secure and Succeed Act \nfollows the framework that President Trump has crafted. Compromises have been made on both sides of this issue. \nIt deals with the DACA issue, secures the border, and fixes critical flaws in our immigration system that incentivize \nillegal immigration today. This is to ensure that we are not back here in a few short years to deal with the problem \nagain of a new wave of young people who may be brought here illegally. Again, the President has said repeatedly \nthat the Secure and Succeed Act is the only bill that he will sign into law. Leadership in the U.S House of \nRepresentatives has also been clear that the only plan it will bring up for a vote in its body is one that will be signed \ninto law. The Secure and Succeed Act is that plan. We don't have many opportunities in this body for common \nthought and common positions, but we have one here. I have seen what most people in this body have said about \nthese issues, and it impresses me that there is commonality of thought. At the root, this body wants to solve the \nDACA issue, but it also wants to solve the problems that caused this issue in the first place. This President called \nfor a compassionate compromise when he met with Democrats and Republicans several weeks ago at the White \nHouse, and we all agreed it was time to do that for the American people. Yet the American people want to be \nassured that the borders will be secure. They want to be assured that the policies that are embedded in our \nimmigration system will not create another wave of illegal immigrants. They also want this archaic diversity lottery \nto end, which has never worked as was originally intended and is nothing but a loophole for terrorists today. I think \nthere is too much talk about this bill cutting immigration. That is not the intent here. The intent is long term. We \nhave a bill in here called the RAISE Act that would actually move us to a merit-based system like those in Canada \nand Australia. That is not included in the Secure and Succeed Act. What is included here is a first step toward a \nlong-term solution not only on our legal immigration side, but it sets us up to then deal with the temporary work \nvisas and, ultimately, with the illegal population. I believe, as I know the Presiding Officer does, that it is time for \nthose in this body to put our self-interests and our partisan interests aside, as we say so many times, and to do \nwhat the American people want us to do, for which we now have hard evidence. I yield the floor. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk \nproceeded to call the roll. Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Congratulating Chloe Kim on \nWinning a Gold Medal at the Winter Olympics Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, let me begin by congratulating \nChloe Kim, a first-generation American who won an Olympic Gold Medal for the United States in the women's \nhalfpipe snowboarding event this week. Her father, Jong Jin Kim emigrated from South Korea to the United States \nin 1982, became a dishwasher at a fast-food restaurant, studied engineering at El Camino College after working \n\n\n\nthose low-skilled jobs, and then became an engineer. He left his engineering job to support his daughter's \nsnowboarding ambitions so he could drive her 5\\1/2\\ hours to the mountain for training. Congratulations to Chloe \nand to her entire family. You make the United States proud. Madam President, the whole debate we are now \nundertaking over immigration and the Dreamers has become somewhat personal for me because it has reminded \nme, in a very strong way, that I and my brother are first-generation Americans. We are the sons of an immigrant \nwho came to this country at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, a young man who was a high school \ndropout, who did not know one word of English, and who had no particular trade. A few years ago, my brother and I \nand our families went to the small town where he came from, and it just stunned me, the kind of courage he showed \nand millions of other people show leaving their homeland to come to a very different world, in many cases, without \nmoney, without knowledge of the language. My father immigrated to this country because the town where he lived \nin Poland was incredibly poor. There was no economic opportunity for him. People there struggled to put food on \nthe table for their families. Hunger was a real issue in that area. My father came to this country to avoid the violence \nand bloodshed of World War I, which came to his part of the world in a ferocious manner, and he came to this \ncountry to escape the religious bigotry that existed then because he was Jewish. My father lived in this country until \nhis death in 1962. He never made a lot of money. He was a paint salesman. My father was not a political person, \nbut it turned out that without talking much about it, he was the proudest American you ever saw, and he was so \nproud of this country because he was deeply grateful that the United States had welcomed him in and allowed him \nopportunities that would have been absolutely unthinkable from where he came. The truth is, immigration is not \njust my story. It is not just the story of one [[Page S942]] young man coming from Poland who managed to see two \nof his kids go to college and one of his sons become a U.S Senator. It is not just my family's story. It is the story of \nmy wife's family who came from Ireland, and it is the story of tens of millions of American families who came from \nevery single part of this world. In September of 2017, President Trump precipitated the current crisis we are dealing \nwith by revoking President Obama's DACA Executive order. If President Trump believed that Executive order was \nunconstitutional and it needed legislation, he could have come to Congress for a legislative solution without holding \n800,000 young people hostage by revoking their DACA status. President Trump chose not to do that. He chose to \nprovoke the crisis we are experiencing today. That is a crisis we have to deal with in the Senate, and we have to \ndeal with it now. Let us be very clear about the nature of this crisis because some people say: Well, it is really not \nimminent. It is not something we have to worry about now. Those people are wrong. As a result of Trump's \ndecision, 122 people every day are now losing their legal status, and within a couple of years, hundreds of \nthousands of these young people will have lost their legal protection and be subject to deportation. The situation we \nare in right now, as a result of Trump's action, means, if we do not immediately protect the legal status of some \n800,000 Dreamers--young people who were brought to this country at the age of 1 or 3 or 6--young people who \nhave known no other home but the United States of America--let us be clear that if we do not act and act soon, \nthese hundreds of thousands of young people could be subject to deportation. That means they could be arrested \noutside their home, where they have lived for virtually their entire life, and suddenly be placed in a jail. They could \nbe pulled out of a classroom where they are teaching, and there are some 20,000 DACA recipients who are now \nteaching in schools all over this country. If we do not act and act now, there could be agents going into those \nschools, pulling those teachers right out and arresting them and subjecting them to deportation. Insane as it may \nsound, I suppose the 900 DACA recipients who now serve in the U.S military today could find themselves in the \nposition of being arrested and deported from the country they are putting their lives on the line to defend. Some \npeople say: Well, that is far-fetched. Well, I am not so sure. It could happen. How insane is that? That is where we \nare today, and that is what could happen if we do not do the right thing and this week pass legislation in the Senate \nto protect the Dreamers. We have a moral responsibility to stand up for the Dreamers and their families and to \nprevent what will be an indelible moral stain on our country if we fail to act. I do not want to see what the history \nbooks will be saying about this Congress if we allow 800,000 young people to be subjected to deportation, to live in \nincredible fear and anxiety. Here is the very good news for the Dreamers. It is actually news that a couple of years \nago, I would not have believed to be possible. The overwhelming majority of American people--Democrats, \nRepublicans, Independents--absolutely agree we must provide legal protection for the Dreamers and that we \nshould provide them with a path toward citizenship. That is not Bernie Sanders talking, that is what the American \npeople are saying in poll after poll. Just recently, a January 20 CBS News poll found that nearly 9 out of 10 \nAmericans, 87 percent, favor allowing young immigrants who entered the United States illegally as children to \nremain in the United States--87 percent in Iowa, in Vermont, and in every State in this country. There is strong \nsupport for legal status for the Dreamers and a path toward citizenship. On January 11, a Quinnipiac poll found that \n\n\n\n86 percent of American voters, including 76 percent of Republicans, say they want the Dreamers to remain in this \ncountry. On February 5, in a Monmouth poll, when asked about Dreamers' status, nearly three out of four \nAmericans support allowing these young people to automatically become U.S citizens as long as they don't have a \ncriminal record. In other words, the votes that are going to be cast hopefully today, maybe tomorrow, are not \nprofiles in courage. They are not Members of the Senate coming up and saying: Against all the odds, I believe I am \ngoing to vote for what is right. This is what the overwhelming majority of the American people want. Maybe, just \nmaybe, it might be appropriate to do what the American people want rather than what a handful of xenophobic \nextremists want. Maybe we should listen to the American people--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--\nwho understand it would be a morally atrocious thing to allow these young people to be deported. When I think, \nfrom a political perspective, about 80, 85, 90 percent of the American people supporting anything in a nation which \nis as divided as we are today, this is really extraordinary. You can't get 80 percent of the American people to agree \non what their favorite ice cream is, but we have 80 percent of the American people who are saying, do not turn your \nback on these young people who have lived in this country for virtually their entire lives. We have to act and act \nsoon in the Senate, and there is good legislation that would allow us to do that. In the House, the good news is, \nthere is now bipartisan legislation, sponsored by Congressman Hurd and Congressman Aguilar, which will provide \nprotection for Dreamers and a path toward citizenship. My understanding is, bipartisan legislation now has majority \nsupport. I urge, in the strongest terms possible, that Speaker Ryan allow democracy to prevail in the House, allow \nthe vote to take place. If you have a majority of Members of the House, in a bipartisan way, who support legislation, \nallow that legislation to come to the floor. Let the Members vote their will, and if that occurs, I think the Dreamers \nlegislation will prevail. Madam President, we all understand that there is a need for serious debate and legislation \nregarding comprehensive immigration reform. This is a difficult issue, an issue where there are differences of \nopinion. There are a whole lot of aspects to it. How do we provide a path toward citizenship for the 11 million people \nin this country who are currently undocumented but who are working hard, who are raising their kids, who are \nobeying the law? What should the overall immigration policy of our country be? How many people should be \nallowed to enter this country every year? Where should they come from? All of this is very, very important and \nneeds to be seriously debated, but that debate and that legislation is not going to be taking place in a 2-day period. \nIt is going to need some serious time, some hearings, some committee work before the Congress is prepared to \nvote on comprehensive immigration reform, and it will not and cannot happen today, tomorrow, or this week. Our \nfocus now, as a result of Trump's decision in September, must be on protecting the Dreamers and their families and \non the issue of border security. There will be important legislation coming to the floor of the Senate today or maybe \ntomorrow, and I would hope that we could do the right thing, do the moral thing, and do something that history will \nlook back on as very positive legislation. Let's go forward. Let's pass the Dreamers bill. Let's deal with border \nsecurity, and then, in the near future, let us deal with comprehensive immigration reform. I yield the floor. (The \nActing President pro tempore assumed the Chair.) The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The Senator from \nOregon. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, our Constitution begins with three very simple and very powerful words: \n``We the People.'' It is the mission statement for our Nation, for our Constitution. It is a vision in which decisions are \nmade of, by, and for the people, not for the privileged and not for the powerful. Who wrote those words? Well, it \nhappened to be a group of White, wealthy landowners--the powerful and the privileged. They didn't choose to build \na nation that would make laws for their benefit but laws that would be designed for the entire populous to thrive. \nThey were descended from immigrants. In our country, unless you are 100 percent Native American, unless you \nhave just arrived as a new immigrant, you are descended from immigrants yourself. It is part of the fabric [[Page \nS943]] of our Nation. It is what makes us a combination of powerful talents and abilities from around the world. \nGeorge Washington himself once said: ``America is open to receive not only the Opulent and respected Stranger, \nbut the oppressed and persecuted of all Nations and Religions.'' On another occasion, he wrote to a friend: ``I had \nalways hoped that this land might become a safe and agreeable asylum to the virtuous and persecuted part of \nmankind, to whatever nation they might belong.'' True to Washington's wishes and to his vision, that is the land we \nhave been. It has been that land of opportunity, that land that welcomes others to our shores and gives them the \nchance to pursue the vision of opportunity, to help participate in the making of our great Nation, and to do so, each \ngeneration brings together a variety of languages and cultures and backgrounds. That is America. That is why, a \ncentury after our Nation's founding, the French gave to the United States the Statue of Liberty. The Statue of Liberty \nhas stood as a beacon of hope, welcoming those from other lands. Inscribed in the pedestal of that statue are these \nwords: Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your \nteeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door! Those are the \n\n\n\nwelcoming words for hundreds of thousands arriving here in the United States. As I speak at this moment, 800,000 \nyoung men and women right here in America are yearning to breathe free as full participants in the Nation that they \nhave grown up in. These are our Dreamers--Dreamers like this group of Oregonians who visited my office in \nDecember, who came to this country as very young children, who went to elementary school here, who went to high \nschool here, who are our neighbors, our community members, who have gone on to college, who have taken jobs, \nand who are contributing in every possible way to our community, studying in their schools, practicing and working \nin our industry. They are now young adults who are striving to support their families, building to strengthen this \neconomy, and building a future for themselves. They are paramedics saving lives. If you stand on a street corner in \nOregon and look around, there is a pretty good chance you will see a Dreamer. You may not know it because they \nare full members of our community, and you will see them contributing. But they have overcome a lot of obstacles, \nwhich creates a grit of character. It also helps to build the future of our Nation, just as it did for those of our \nforefathers and foremothers who arrived 1 or 2 or 3 or 10 generations ago. We provided a program, the DACA \nProgram, which struck a deal that said: If you give us all of your information, we will make sure that you are legally \nprotected. President Trump has broken that promise. He has broken that deal, that commitment made by our \nexecutive branch to these Dreamers. So it puts them in a terrible spot of uncertainty and stress and limbo. Now it is \ntime to set that right. It could be set right by the President in a moment. Several of the courts have weighed in and \nsaid that the President has acted unconstitutionally in attacking our young immigrants, our Dreamers. But let's not \nwait for the courts to remedy this. Let's take care of it ourselves in this Chamber, the Senate Chamber. After \nmonths and months of inaction, after broken promises by President Trump, let's finally protect these men and \nwomen who do so much to embody the American spirit. As we move forward in this debate, we must look again to \nwhat our Founding Fathers intended for the Nation they created and ensure that the ``golden door'' that the poet \nEmma Lazarus wrote about in her poem remains an open door, open to all those who dream to become an \nAmerican and to contribute to this Nation. We must remain, in President Washington's words, ``open to receive not \nonly the Opulent and Respected, but the oppressed and persecuted of all Nations.'' Yet, looking at the plan that \nPresident Trump has put forward and similar plans offered in this Chamber, there is a real interest in slamming the \ndoor shut by those who have already arrived as immigrants, who have fled persecution, who have pursued \nfreedom, who have pursued opportunity, and who have escaped from famine to come in and slam the door on \neveryone else. It is not very American to do that, and it is not a strength to undermine the future success of our \neconomy by draining away the extraordinary talents of our Dreamer community. President Johnson made the point. \nHe said: ``The land flourished because it was fed from so many sources--because it was nourished by so many \ncultures and traditions and peoples.'' President Ronald Reagan made the point. He said: ``More than any other \ncountry, our strength comes from our own immigrant heritage and our capacity to welcome those from other lands.'' \nThe founding President of our country, a respected Democratic President of our country, and a respected \nRepublican President of our country have said the same thing: The strength of our country is in the contributions \nthat have been made by our immigrants. The Founding Fathers wrote those words, that mission statement, that this \nwould be a nation of, by, and for the people, not one to make laws by and for the powerful and the privileged. That \nis the vision we need to continue to hold on to--to understand that the strength of this Nation comes from weaving \ntogether the many cultural threads of the people of the United States of America. Let's get this Dream Act to this \nfloor. There is a bipartisan understanding around restoring legal status. There is a bipartisan foundation for border \nsecurity. Let's not give in to those far-right Breitbart voices that are so out of sync with the traditions, the strength, \nthe culture, and the vision of our Nation. Let's restore the legal status for our Dreamers, enhance our border \nsecurity, and do the work that this Chamber should have done long ago. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER. \nThe Senator from Missouri. Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I am pleased to come and talk today. This is a week where \nwe had all anticipated a return to the Senate, where ideas are widely debated. I was standing by the majority leader \nlast week when he was talking about this, and he said that we will let a thousand flowers bloom. It didn't sound like \nsomething Senator McConnell would normally use as a reference, but he did, and I am thinking, well, that would be \na good thing, to see a thousand different ideas widely debated on the Senate floor. So far this week, there has not \nbeen any debate because we can't seem to agree on who votes on what first. I think that is a particular level of \ndysfunction that we should all be concerned about. For the Senate to do its work, we have to be willing to vote and \nwe have to be willing to take some hard votes. My sense of politics today is, whether you have taken the vote or \nnot, someone is going to accuse you of taking that vote. So you might as well not worry about the vote you take; \njust worry about the work we get done and whatever votes are necessary to be taken to get that done. On this topic, \nit does seem to me that we have two issues here that should be solved, two issues on which there is broad \n\n\n\nagreement. I have said for a long time that there are really three questions in the immigration debate that need to \nbe answered: No. 1, how do we secure the border; No. 2, what are the legitimate workforce needs of the country; \nand No. 3, what do we do with people who came and stayed illegally? As we think about securing the border, by the \nway, half the people who are in the country illegally came legally and just stayed. So it is not all a border issue, but \nit clearly is partly and significantly a border issue. One of the things that people expect a government to be able to \ndo is to secure its own borders. Often, when we hear a story of a country somewhere in the world in which the \ngovernment has disintegrated and is no longer in control of the country, one of the first things that are mentioned by \npeople talking about that dysfunctional government is that they don't control their own borders. It truly is a legitimate \nexpectation of a functioning government that you control your own borders. It is also a legitimate expectation of \ngovernment that you look at [[Page S944]] your economy and you look at what workforce needs you have that \naren't being met and figure out the best way to meet those workforce needs. In this debate, because we haven't \ncontrolled our borders and because we haven't kept track of people who legally crossed our borders and as a \nresult, we have some number of people--usually the estimate is about 11 million people in the country--who are not \nhere legally, what do we do with those people? My view has always been that if the government met its primary \nresponsibility, which is an immigration system that works, the American people would be very forward-leaning \nabout those other two issues, because nobody really argues that if we don't have people here to do the work that \nneeds to be done, whether it is highly skilled or not highly skilled, we ought to be thinking about what we need to do \nto get people here who can do that work. Also, what do we need to do to keep people here who came here to get \ntraining to do highly skilled jobs and graduated from colleges and universities or other skill-enhancing things that \nhappened while they were here. If they want to stay, my view is that if they didn't do anything that got them in \ntrouble while they were here, we should almost always want them to stay. If we don't have that skill set in our \neconomy, why wouldn't we come up with ways to reach out and get it? Those who are not here legally, generally, I \nthink if people thought the problem was solved, if they thought that the government had truly met its responsibility to \noperationally control the borders and that the government had met its responsibility to keep track of who comes in \nlegally and know if they have left or not--I mean, there is no retail store in America that doesn't have a better sense \nof its inventory than we do of whether people who have legally come into the country and checked in with a \nCustoms officer--we don't know if they have left. We couldn't tell you in weeks, perhaps, whether somebody is still \nhere, even if they did everything exactly the way they were supposed to do it. This debate is largely driven by the \nmost sympathetic of all of those groups: that group of people who came here and were brought here by someone \nelse who entered the country illegally--often by their own parents--but have grown up in America. My first response, \nand I think the response of most Americans when they think about that, is that kids who grew up here, kids who \nwent to school here, kids who haven't gotten in bad trouble while they were here, kids who have no real memory or \nconnection with the country they were brought from--of course we want them to stay; of course we want them to be \npart of our economy. Because they are an even younger society than we would be without them, why wouldn't we \nwant that to happen? In some respects, we have two separate issues here. People who were raised here, who \nhave done everything that anybody else would do to acclimate as an American in all ways, who went to school \nhere, who did everything else here--70 or 80 percent of the American people, and I occasionally see a number even \nhigher than that, believe they should be allowed to stay. More and more, as people think about that, they also \nbelieve that after they have been here, like any other immigrant who came to the country legally, they would \neventually be able to take the test and go through the process to become a citizen. That is a widely accepted \npremise that this debate should be built on. Another widely accepted premise that this debate should be built on is \nthat 70 percent or so of the American people--and it would be a higher percentage if people really knew the facts--\nbelieve the government has not met its responsibility to secure our own borders. Let's assume that number is 70. \nWe have two 70 percent issues. We would assume that a working Congress could take two 70 percent issues and \ncome up with a solution that makes its way to the President's desk and solves both of these problems. We are not \ngoing to solve these problems by saying: OK, we are going to solve the problem for people who are already here, \nbut we are not going to do anything to make it harder for others to be brought here illegally by someone who has \ncontrol of them. We are not going to solve that? Of course that is not going to work. I don't think whether you signed \nup for DACA should be a determiner, and apparently the President agrees. If you are here and in the category of \nthose who were brought here and grew up here, whether you signed up as a DACA kid, you could still be part of \nthat overall discussion of how to stay, and you still get to stay if we can come up with a solution for you to do that. \nBut we are not going to solve that problem and say: We will have a study of the other problem to see what is wrong. \nIf by now we largely don't know what is wrong with the other problem, we are never going to figure out what is \n\n\n\nwrong with the other problem. In 1986, long before the Presiding Officer or I came to Congress and maybe long \nbefore some of us graduated from high school, we were going to solve this problem. Everybody who was here \nillegally could stay if they wanted to, and the borders would be made secure. Here we are, over three decades \nlater, still debating the same thing. We need to solve both of these problems. If we can solve other problems while \nwe are doing it, that is fine, too, but we need to come up with a solution. There are a number of ideas out there as \nto how the Senate should move forward. On the DACA issue, it is important to remember that President Trump \nsaid: I am going to give the Congress 6 more months to solve this problem--until March 5. It is also important to \nknow that the courts have allowed people to continue to sign up, so really the deadline is somewhere beyond March \n5. But the President said: I am going to give Congress 6 more months. President Obama didn't do anything about \nthis for years--not because he didn't want to, I believe, but because he said he didn't have the ability to. President \nObama repeatedly said: The President cannot solve this problem; Congress has to solve the problem. In spite of 6 \nor 7 years of saying that he couldn't solve this problem on his own, he ultimately decided to try to do it with an \nExecutive order. The truth is, that Executive order was never going to do the job. I think President Obama knew \nthat. When President Trump did his own order, he probably also knew he didn't have the ability to do that any more \nthan President Obama had to do what he did. But both of these Presidents in their own way have tried to drive the \nCongress toward making a decision that comes up with a plan that works--a plan that works for kids who were \nbrought here with no choice in the matter and a plan for seeing to it that kids can't still be easily brought here with \nno choice. We need to let young people come here because we need them here as part of our workforce, as part of \nour country. Legal immigration is what made America great. The rule of law is also what makes our country what it \nis. We can't continue to let immigration be an area where we have decided there are laws that we will not enforce. \nThe challenge for the Congress right now is to come up with a solution so that this problem is not going to continue \nto be the same problem it is today, but as far as the problem today, we are going to solve it. We are going to solve it \nin a way that lets kids who grew up here become part of the solution. I continue to be committed to strengthening \nour borders. I continue to be committed to stemming the tide of illegal immigration. Frankly, I continue to be \ncommitted to the idea of legal immigration as part of continually reinforcing and re-enthusing who we are. But I am \nalso committed to finding a permanent solution for young people in that category who were brought here, grew up \nhere, haven't gotten in trouble while here, and have every reason to want to be part of the American dream and \npart of the American people whom they have been part of up until now. I hope we can find common ground on a bill \nthat does that. I hope we can pass a bill from the Senate that the House will also pass. If Senators think they have \ndone their job by passing a bill that can't possibly pass the House, that is just kicking the can down the road. We \nneed to find a solution that really resolves this problem, and we solve this problem by putting a bill on the \nPresident's desk. To do that, we are going to [[Page S945]] have to vote. We can't do that by just having a quorum \ncall or a vacancy here on the Senate floor. We have to be willing to vote. There are some things that I will \nenthusiastically vote for and some things I will reluctantly not be able to vote for. But that doesn't mean that I should \nsay: If I can't be for whatever is brought to the Senate floor, then I don't want to vote on it or debate it. We can't \ncontinue to tune in to a vacant screen of the Senate floor. This is the week that we have all committed to having a \nreal debate about solving as many problems as we can that relate to kids who were brought here and grew up here \nand solving that problem so other kids in these numbers are not likely to face that problem in the future. As I yield, I \nhope the floor is filled over the next couple of days with a vigorous debate about the best way to solve the problem \nbefore us in a way that the people we work for will feel good about it and the people who are most impacted by our \ndecision will feel equally the concern, the warmth, and the desire of our country to have a vibrant economy that has \npeople who want to be part of it, able to be part of it, and particularly people who grew up in the United States of \nAmerica to be part of it. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). The Senator from Wyoming. Tax \nReform Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, it seems as though just about every day we get more good news about the \ntax relief law that Republicans passed. This week, the news is getting even better for a lot of people all across the \ncountry. By the end of this month, 90 percent of workers across the country will see more money in their take-home \npaychecks. It doesn't matter where they are. They can be in Meeteetse, WY, and they will see an increase in their \npaychecks this week. That is because this Thursday, February 15, is the deadline for employers to start using the \nnew IRS tax withholding tables. The IRS tells employers how much money to withhold from people's paychecks so \nthat their taxes work out pretty close at the end of the year. That is the way it is set up. Well, the IRS looked at the \nnew tax law and saw that people are going to be paying lower taxes at the end of the year, so they put out the new \ntax tables. They told businesses to adjust how much money to withhold from a person's paycheck and to do it by \nFebruary 15, tomorrow. For 90 percent of Americans, this tax amount is going to be lower, which means their \n\n\n\npaychecks are going to be larger. A tax cut is the same as a raise. That is what we are seeing all across the \ncountry--people getting a raise in their pay. Some people have already gotten a paycheck with the new, higher \nwages. Others are going to get it very soon. The website Yahoo Finance crunched the numbers. They found that a \ntypical worker making $60,000 a year will get an extra $112 in their paychecks every month because of the tax law. \nThat is over $1,300 for the year. To me, that is very good news for American workers. I was at home in Wyoming \nthis past weekend, traveling around the State, and I am hearing about it in all the different communities I go to. \nPeople are saying: This has been better for me and my family personally. On top of this, a lot of workers are getting \nspecial bonuses and raises because of the tax law. So not only are they getting more money because of the fact \nthat the tax rates have been lowered, additionally, they are getting more money because they have gotten a raise or \na bonus. It seems there are about 4 million hard-working Americans who are getting bonuses of hundreds or even \nthousands of dollars as a result of the new tax reform law. They are also getting extra money in their retirement \nplans. They are getting higher starting wages. We are seeing many places increasing the starting wages, some up \nto $15 an hour. More than 300 companies have said they are increasing all of these kinds of compensations as a \ndirect result of the tax law. In my home State of Wyoming, people across the State are getting bonuses--bonuses. \nThese are people who work at Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, Starbucks, Wells Fargo, and other businesses that \nhave familiar names to people across the country. They are also people who are working in smaller businesses, like \nthe Jonah Bank in Wyoming. It has branches in Casper and in Cheyenne. It is not a nationally known bank, but it is \nvery important in our State and in our communities. Every employee of this bank is getting a $1,000 bonus. The \nbank is also increasing its giving in the communities in which it has branches. Workers benefit, and the community \nbenefits. That is what happens when we change the tax law so Washington gets less and taxpayers get to keep \nmore. That is why I voted for this tax law--to give the kind of tax relief that made these bonuses and these pay \nraises possible. It is good for Wyoming, and it is good for people all across the country. It is interesting--it is even \ngood for people in States whose Senators voted against the tax law. Ninety percent of people across the country \nare seeing the benefits no matter which State they are from. There is a business in Grand Rapids, MI, called the \nMill Steel Company. They said last week that they are giving an extra $1,000 to their workers because of the tax \nlaw that every Republican voted for and every Democrat voted against. Now, 400 people at that company are \ngetting a bonus. Michigan has two Democratic Senators. They both voted against the tax relief law. It still led to \n$1,000 bonuses for these 400 workers. What do the Senators have to say about it now? Are they proud that they \nvoted against the tax law? Are they glad they said no to these sorts of raises that made it possible for people in their \nhome States to get the bonuses? We know what Nancy Pelosi thinks. She went out and first she talked about how \nthe tax law was Armageddon, and then she said it was the end of the world. Most recently, she said all the benefits \npeople are getting under the tax law, in her words, are just ``crumbs.'' ``Crumbs,'' she said. For her, it may be \ndifferent, but for a lot of Americans, a $1,000 bonus--certainly for the people in my home State of Wyoming--is \nmuch more than crumbs. An extra $1,300--I talked about the worker earlier--in that paycheck is much more than \ncrumbs. For a person with a starting wage of $15 an hour, that is more than crumbs. It is bad enough Democrats \ntried to keep people from getting the extra money--Democrats voted against it because they didn't want people to \nget the extra money, it seems to me. It is hard to believe they would continue this way and take pride in voting \nagainst it, but they did. Now it seems like Democrats want to insult people by saying what they are seeing and what \ntheir benefits are, are resulting in crumbs. It is completely unfair, and I think it is disrespectful to the American \npeople. These are just some of the cash benefits workers are getting from the tax law. Republicans predicted, \nduring the debate over this law, there would be other benefits as well. We said businesses would pay less in taxes, \nand some of them would be able to additionally cut prices for consumers--let people buy things more cheaply. \nAmericans are starting to see this prediction come true as well. One of the first places they are seeing it is in their \nutility bills. Gas, electric, and water utilities are cutting their rates because their taxes are going down under the \nlaw. In Vermont, the State's only natural gas utility company is cutting rates by more than 5 percent because of the \ntax law. Both of the Senators from Vermont voted against the law, but it is the law Republicans passed that caused \nthese rates to go down. In fact, people living in at least 23 States and the District of Columbia are going to be \npaying lower utility bills because of the tax relief law. Another 26 States are looking into cutting rates. Rates are \ngoing down in California, Maryland, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut--States where every Democratic \nSenator voted against the tax law. What do these Democratic Senators have to say now? Are they proud of the fact \nthey voted against the tax cuts that made it possible for people to have lower utility bills in their States? When \npeople's monthly bills get cut, it is like a pay hike--more money in their own pockets. They have more money to \neither save or to spend on other things or to invest. [[Page S946]] The owner of a gym in Cincinnati, OH, spoke with \n\n\n\nhis local television station about what tax relief means for him. He said: When people have that extra money to \nspend, they spend it. Some save it. They go out to eat. They buy gym memberships. And they enjoy themselves. \nPeople have that extra money to spend now, today, because of the tax law Republicans passed. They have the \nextra money despite every Democrat in this body voting against tax relief. Every one of them said no. They all voted \nno. Democrats who voted no to tax relief for American families essentially voted yes to keep the extra money in \nWashington so they can decide how to spend it. I have much more faith in people at home in Wyoming deciding \nhow to spend their money than any faith I have in Washington, DC. For so many Americans, every dollar helps, \nand they are not crumbs. Democrats may not know the difference, but the American families do. People in every \nState of this country know the difference. The American people understand what Republicans did with this tax law. \nThey are seeing more money in their paychecks, more take-home pay, more money to decide what to spend and \nwhat to invest and what to save. They know Republicans promised to cut people's taxes. People know Republicans \ndelivered on the promise. They know the benefits they have gotten already, and they are confident the economy will \ncontinue to grow stronger day by day. People across the country also know the fact that every Democrat voted \nagainst this law, voted against giving them a tax break, voted against allowing them to keep more of their hard-\nearned money. The American people know who took their side, who voted for the American public versus who said \nno. Hard-working Americans asked us to do a job for them. Republicans are doing the job; Democrats in \nWashington certainly are not. Republicans are going to keep doing that job for the American people--a job we have \npromised and a job which we have delivered. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING \nOFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, \nit is so ordered. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, it is time for the Senate to do its job as a separate branch of \ngovernment. This week, we can come together on a bipartisan basis to resolve the crisis Donald Trump created \nwhen he canceled DACA. We can provide hundreds of thousands of young people in our country their shot at \npursuing the American dream without fear of deportation. Right now, these young people who were brought to this \ncountry as children are terrified they will be separated from their families and the lives they have built here, in the \nonly country they know and love. I have met and spoken with so many Dreamers in the Halls of Congress these \npast months. Their focus, determination, and commitment in this fight continues to be extraordinary and inspiring. \nEach Dreamer has a different story to tell, but they all share a profoundly simple aspiration--to live, work, and study \nin the only country they have ever called home. When you sit and listen to their stories, it is not difficult to \nunderstand why between 80 and 90 percent of Americans support protecting these Dreamers--people like Karen, \nMaleni, and Beatrice, who can attend the University of Hawaii because of DACA; people like Victor, from Houston, \nwho aspires to become a counselor for LGBTQ youth like him; and people like Getsi, from Oregon, who works three \njobs so she can pursue her dream of becoming a nurse practitioner to care for our seniors. These inspiring young \npeople don't need to hear any more promises. They need Members of Congress to put their votes where their \nmouths have been and do the right thing. Like many of my colleagues, I strongly support passing a clean Dream \nAct--legislation that already has bipartisan support--but it is critical that we get to the 60 votes we need to pass a \nbill. I am open to discussing different provisions, including some funding for border security to help us get there. We \ncan and should have a debate on comprehensive immigration reform but only after we pass legislation this week \nto protect the Dreamers. We cannot and should not use this debate to provide cover for efforts to dismantle the \nfamily-based immigration system or to make massive cuts to legal immigration. The President and a number of \ncolleagues have made it clear they would like to eliminate family-based immigration in favor of a system that is \ndesigned only to recruit immigrants with advanced degrees and specialized skills. It is important for the United \nStates to recruit highly skilled immigrants, and we have a number of immigration programs that are designed \nspecifically for this purpose, but when you restrict immigration only to people with highly specialized skills or \nadvanced degrees, you lose out on a lot of human potential that has historically contributed so much to our country. \nWe don't have to look far back into history to prove why this statement is true. Over the past week, the Olympics \nhas captured the excitement and imagination of people across the country--in fact, the world. Many of the people \nwe have been cheering for are either the children of immigrants or are immigrants themselves. Over the weekend, \nwe saw Mirai Nagasu, whose parents emigrated from Japan, become the first American woman to land a triple axel \nin the Olympics during her appearance in the team figure skating competition. Yesterday, we saw Maame Biney, \nwho immigrated to the United States from Ghana, take to the ice to compete in the short track speed skating. Two \nnights ago, I watched Chloe Kim throw down a near perfect score in the women's snowboard halfpipe to win the \nOlympic Gold Medal. After completing her history-making run, the cameras panned to her father Jong Jin Kim, who \n\n\n\nproudly waved his ``Go Chloe'' sign in the audience. Jong arrived in California in 1982 with $800 in his pocket. He \nworked for years at minimum wage jobs to save for college. While studying at El Camino College, he worked as a \nheavy machinery operator at night. Jong encouraged Chloe to begin snowboarding when she was 4. They would \njump off the lifts together, but because he didn't know how to snowboard, they would tumble to the ground. Jong \nbought Chloe her first snowboard on eBay for $25. When Chloe was 8, Jong quit his job as an engineer to support \nher snowboarding career. He would often wake up at 2 a.m in the morning to drive Chloe over 300 miles to her \npractices. After watching his daughter win the Olympic Gold, Jong said in Korean, ``When I came to the United \nStates, this was my American hope. Now, this is my American dream.'' In reflecting on her father's sacrifice, Chloe \nsaid, ``My dad has definitely sacrificed a lot for me, and I don't know if I could do it if I was in his shoes, leaving your \nlife behind and chasing your dream because your kid is passionate about this sport. I think today I did it for my \nfamily, and I am so grateful to them.'' Chloe's story of winning the Olympic Gold is extraordinary, but her father's \nstory speaks to a deep and abiding foundation of America and to my personal experience as an immigrant. My \nmom also came to this country--poor and without skills to escape an abusive marriage--to give her three children, of \nwhich I am one, a chance at a better life. Like Jong and Chloe, one generation after my mom came to this country, I \nam standing on the floor of the U.S Senate, fighting for humane immigration policies. These stories speak to the \nbroader immigrant experience in our country. We work hard and embrace the opportunities this country provides, \nand we often see the result of this hard work within a single generation. I would ask my colleagues: Do you think the \nUnited States would be better off if we prevented immigrants like Jong and me from coming to this country? \nTargeting immigrants for discriminatory and harsh treatment is denying our country's history. With the exception of \nour original peoples, everyone came to our country from somewhere else. We are fighting to preserve [[Page \nS947]] the spirit of our country--that shining city on a hill. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The \nPRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. \nMs. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The \nPRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, like my colleagues \nfrom whom we are hearing today, I also rise to talk about the importance of protecting the Dreamers, not just in the \nState of Nevada but across this country. I want to talk specifically about a term that I constantly hear during this \ndebate on how we need to protect Dreamers and at the same time address this issue of ``chain migration.'' I call on \nmy colleagues and President Trump to really stop using that term and to abandon the offensive and misleading \nterm of ``chain migration'' because it paints a picture that does not reflect reality. Immigrants cannot sponsor their \nentire families to come here. Our system of family-based immigration allows American citizens and green card \nholders to petition for some of their immediate family members to join them in the United States. There are \nnumerous steps families must take to legally immigrate to the United States. It is a long and arduous process that \nleaves husbands, wives, parents, brothers, and sisters waiting for decades. This system is so broken and slow that \nmany people die before they ever have the chance to be reunited with their loved ones again. So this image of \nimmigrants coming in endless chains across our borders couldn't be further from the truth. For instance, the U.S \nCitizenship and Immigration Services is currently processing visa applications for the siblings of U.S citizens from \n1994. That is 24 years ago. This backlog is painful for many American families, like Fely. Fely is an immigrant from \nthe Philippines who arrived in the United States with her husband and her youngest son back in 1989. Her father \nwas a veteran who served in World War II, earned his citizenship, and petitioned to have Fely join him in the U.S In \nthe almost three decades since then, Fely has worked tirelessly to reunite with her other children. Now at 80 years \nold, she is still waiting and hoping that three of her children will make it through the backlog to join her at home. Her \nstory shows us that sponsoring even your closest family members is a lengthy and difficult process. Tragically, \nFely's struggle is not uncommon. Thousands of Filipino veterans all across this country are in the same situation. \nAs a daughter and granddaughter of veterans, I know firsthand that when someone answers the call of duty, family \nmembers make sacrifices too. I support Senator Hirono's Filipino Veterans Family Reunification Act, a bill that \nwould expedite the visa process for Filipino World War II veterans' immediate relatives. We should honor the \nsacrifices that veterans and their families make by passing this bill, not by forcing them to wait in perpetual limbo. \nOur immigration system reflects our national commitment to the strength and importance of the family unit. \nFamilies are support systems. They pull each other up when someone is in need and pull together their resources. \nStrong families build strong communities. Karl is a 20-year-old Filipino-American community organizer born and \nraised in North Las Vegas. Karl's whole family is committed to community service. While attending high school, \nKarl's brother volunteers at an organization that serves the homeless. Karl's mother teaches special education in \nNorth Las Vegas to low-income children. Karl's dad is a mechanic and a military veteran, having served this country \n\n\n\nin multiple branches of the armed services. None of them would be here if not for our family-based, legal \nimmigration system. Some of my Republican colleagues claim to be champions of strong, nuclear families and \nfamily values. Yet here we are today, considering a measure that would tear apart families like Karl's, that would \nleave parents without children, sisters without brothers, and husbands without wives. Why does the party of family \nvalues think that is acceptable? The problem is that the party of Donald Trump is not the party of family values. \nDonald Trump doesn't care about families. He wants to be able to pick and choose which families get to come in \nand which have to stay out. The White House immigration plan we are considering would cut legal immigration \nby up to 44 percent. That is half a million more immigrants who would be banned each year. This is one of the \nlargest xenophobic-driven cuts to legal immigration since the 1920s. It would affect nearly 22 million people over \nthe next five decades. What is going on here? What are they so afraid of? I recently sat down with immigrant \nworkers in the Senate and the Pentagon who are about to lose their protections from deportation. One of them told \nme that she left El Salvador after seeing her husband brutally murdered in front of her and her son. She has been \nworking for the Federal Government for the past two decades, serving the very men and women who are preparing \nto vote to send her back to the country she fled with her children. I also spoke with a Dreamer who works right here \nin the Senate cafeteria. She is the sole provider for her three American-citizen children, and she, too, is afraid that \nunder Donald Trump's deportation policy, she is going to be ripped apart from her children and sent back to a \ncountry that she fled. These are the people Donald Trump wants to throw out of their homes. They are not asking \nfor special treatment or handouts or giveaways. They just want to be allowed to stay and work hard and provide for \ntheir families. They don't want to have to go back to a place where they will have to live every day in fear for their \nlives and for their children's lives. This President will tell you that immigrants are taking jobs. That is a myth. It is a \nlie that has been spread about every immigrant group in American history, and it has been repeatedly debunked by \neconomic research. According to the National Academy of Sciences National Research Council, a typical immigrant \nfamily will pay an estimated $80,000 more in taxes than they receive in public benefits over their lifetime. Immigrant \nfamilies bring long-term economic benefits to our country by starting businesses, purchasing property, and \nsupporting the education and achievement of their children. Research shows that immigrants drive growth. They \ngenerate new patents at twice the rate of native-born Americans. In 2014, they earned $1.3 trillion and contributed \n$105 billion in State and local taxes and nearly $224 billion in Federal taxes. Immigrants are 30 percent more likely \nto start a business in the United States than nonimmigrants, and 18 percent of small business owners in the United \nStates are immigrants. They create jobs right here in the United States. Jobs are not the problem here. The \nproblem is the color of immigrants' skin. We have a President of the United States who has wondered out loud why \nwe can't have more Whites come to this country. President Trump denies being a racist. For a nonracist, he has \ndone a shockingly good job of cultivating support among White supremacists. This is not about the color of people's \nskin, but this is about family. This is about strong nuclear families and family values. I am proud of who I am, where \nI came from, and I am a descendant of immigrants. But I also learned and believe in strong values and strong family \nvalues, and we lead with those values. So our immigration system should reflect our national commitment to the \nstrength and the importance of that family unit and those family values. It makes no sense to me that we are fighting \ntoday to protect these kids and keep them in this country and then take their parents and rip them out of their \nhomes and send them back to a country that they do not want to go to, that they do not call home, and where their \nsafety is called into question. I don't understand that as a family value or as an American value. So I ask my \ncolleagues, when we are talking about the immigration system [[Page S948]] and protecting Dreamers, let's \nimplement commonsense immigration reform. Let's make sure that when we are protecting Dreamers, we are \nalso protecting their family unit and those family values. This is not about pitting parents against their kids or having \nkids decide whether they should stay here or their parents should. No child should have to go to school concerned \nthat when they come home, their parents may not be there. I don't know about you, but I went through the public \nschool system in the State of Nevada, and I was always, always comforted with the thought that when I walked \nthrough that door, my mother and father would be there. Any other way to treat these children and their families, to \nme, is inhumane. They are not values that we stand for as Americans, and they are not values that we lead with \nwhen we are talking about commonsense reforms to immigration. So I ask my colleagues: Please, as we go \nthrough this debate, remember who we are talking about. There are faces, there are families, there are people \nbehind the very decisions that we make this week. Thank you. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The \nSenator from New Mexico. Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, as the \nSenate takes to the floor to debate a long-overdue, bipartisan solution for Dreamers--young immigrants who came \n\n\n\nto our country as children--I would like to tell you a story about one Dreamer in my home State of New Mexico to \nillustrate what is at stake here this week. Immigrants have long helped to write the economic, social, and cultural \nstory of my home State of New Mexico and, for that matter, our entire Nation. We are, after all, a nation of \nimmigrants. Over the last centuries, our Nation's foundation and the enduring American spirit were built by the hard \nwork and the dreams of so many striving young immigrants. When President Trump made the outrageous decision \nlast fall to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program--DACA--he threw hundreds of thousands of \nDreamers deep into fear and uncertainty. Two weeks ago, I was proud to welcome Ivonne Orozco-Acosta, one of \nthe estimated 7,000 Dreamers from New Mexico, as my guest at the State of the Union Address. Ivonne's family \nimmigrated to the United States when she was 12 years old. She learned English through middle school and \ngraduated from high school in Estancia, NM. It was during these challenging years of learning that Ivonne was \nencouraged by her teachers to grow and to learn. Ivonne knows the power that educators hold to create positive \nchange in students' perspective of themselves. Ivonne attended the University of New Mexico, where she earned \nher BA in secondary education with a concentration in Spanish. It is estimated that somewhere between 500 and \n1,000 students at the University of New Mexico right now are Dreamers like Ivonne. These are some of our \nbrightest students, and they are our future leaders. Since she graduated from UNM 4 years ago, Ivonne has been \nteaching Spanish at the Public Academy for Performing Arts, a charter school in Albuquerque, NM. Ivonne told me \nwhat DACA has meant for her. DACA allowed her to get a work permit, to follow her passion for education. It made \nit possible for her to buy a home and her first car. It has also given her an opportunity to impact the lives of her \nstudents each day and to contribute to our State's economy as a teacher and as a taxpayer. DACA gave Ivonne, in \nher words, ``a sliver of hope''--hope that she will finally be able to have a permanent home and a place in the only \ncountry that she knows how to call home. Because of her excellent teaching in the classroom and her incredible \npassion for her students, Ivonne was just selected as the 2018 New Mexico Teacher of the Year by the New Mexico \nPublic Education Department. That is right; Ivonne has been recognized as the teacher of the year for our entire \nState. Ivonne's commitment to education and to giving back to her community is truly inspiring, and it reminds us \njust how much is at stake for New Mexico and our country in this debate. Our State already struggles to keep \nschools filled with teachers and has one of the highest teacher turnover rates in the Nation. Dreamers across the \ncountry, like Ivonne, are stepping up to serve our communities, to teach our students. Nearly 9,000 of the Dreamers \nwho received temporary legal status and work permits through the DACA Program are teachers like Ivonne. Many \nmore are firefighters; they are police officers; they are scientists; they are doctors; they are members of our military. \nThese inspiring young people are Americans in every sense of the word, except for a piece of paper, and they \nwant nothing more than to be productive members of their communities. But until Congress passes the Dream Act, \nthese young people like Ivonne will continue to worry about whether they will be able to stay in school, keep \nworking, contributing to our economy, or remain even in their homes and their neighborhoods. I have to ask: Why \nwould we even consider threatening to deport the teacher of the year from my State? I simply cannot accept that as \nliving up to all that our Nation stands for. The Santa Fe New Mexican covered Ivonne's visit to Washington. The \nNew Mexican's editorial board said: ``It is no exaggeration to state that as the immigration debate goes, so does \nher future.'' They went on to call the immigration debate we are engaging here in Congress as a fight ``for the soul \nof this country, founded and strengthened by immigrants throughout our history.'' I, for one, hope that we can learn \nfrom the best and most challenging parts of our Nation's history of immigration and understand that Dreamers like \nIvonne are part of the immigration story that has always made our Nation great. Deporting these young people \nwho grew up in America and want to contribute to their Nation is not what the America that I know and love would \ndo. Dreamers deserve commonsense, compassionate, and responsible policy. Two weeks ago, while President \nTrump was taking cheap shots at immigrants during his State of the Union Address and insinuating that all \nimmigrants and asylum seekers pose an existential danger to our children and our families, I couldn't help but think \nof the impacts of his words on Ivonne as she sat in the Gallery. There are hundreds of thousands of Dreamers like \nher. They are truly bright spots and rising stars in our communities and in our country, and the time has come for us \nto stop playing politics with their lives. Let's stop stirring up fear and division when we should be working to find a \nreal path forward. This week, I believe we have a path forward here in the Senate in this debate, and we must pass \na bipartisan immigration bill that includes the Dream Act in the Senate and in the House. I will do everything I can \nto pass a solution for Dreamers, to create rational border security policies, and to make the investments that our \nborder region and its communities actually need. I will stand with New Mexicans against President Trump's fear-\nbased and un-American views, frankly, on immigration and his offensive and wasteful border wall that have no \nplace in this debate. I hope that each of us in this body recognizes our moral responsibility and our obligation to live \n\n\n\nup to our Nation's ideals and its values. We must act with a sense of urgency to find a way forward for these \nDreamers. Every day that passes without our passing the Dream Act is another day of desperation and limbo for \nyoung people like Ivonne who only know America as their home. Now is the time to give these young Americans a \npermanent place and an earned path to citizenship in our Nation. I will do everything I can every step of the way to \nmake that happen. Thank you, Mr. President. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from \nConnecticut. South Florida School Shooting Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, as we speak, there is a horrific scene \nplaying [[Page S949]] out in a high school in South Florida. Turn on your television right now, and you will see \nscenes of children running for their lives--what looks to be the 19th school shooting in this country, and we have not \neven hit March. I am coming to the floor to talk about something else, but let me note once again for my colleagues \nthat this happens nowhere else other than the United States of America, this epidemic of mass slaughter, this \nscourge of school shooting after school shooting. It only happens here, not because of coincidence, not because of \nbad luck, but as a consequence of our inaction. We are responsible for the level of mass atrocity that happens in \nthis country with zero parallel anywhere else. As a parent, it scares me to death that this body doesn't take \nseriously the safety of my children, and it seems as though a lot of parents in South Florida are going to be asking \nthat same question later today. We pray for the families and for the victims. We hope for the best. Mr. President, I \ncame to the floor today to talk about immigration. I want to make a specific case to you today, but before I do, I \nwant to talk a little about process. I heard a lot of my friends on the Republican side of the aisle say on this floor \nand in the Halls of Congress that President Trump has made an immigration proposal and Democrats have been \nasking for an immigration proposal, so we should just accept his first and only offer. What is the big deal? \nPresident Trump gave you something that says ``immigration'' on it. Why aren't you accepting it? It is a terrible \nproposal. It is bad for America. To his credit, President Trump does attempt to try to deal with these Dreamer kids, \nbut there are 3 million potentially eligible individuals in this country, and it only allows about 1.8 million of them to \nget through the process. But that is really not the worst part. The worst part is that it cuts legal immigration by 40 \npercent. It basically abandons this country's commitment to family-based immigration. I wouldn't be here if we only \nhad skills-based immigration. Most Members of this body wouldn't be here if the only way that your parents or \ngrandparents or great- grandparents could have come here is because of a Ph.D or a degree or a certificate. Most \nof the people in this Chamber, I would imagine, are here because their parents or great-grandparents or great-\ngreat- grandparents came here because they had friends or family here. Let's not reimagine the history of this \ncountry. Democrats aren't obligated to accept the first offer from this President if it is not good for America. \nNegotiation still has to be part of the legislative process, and I am glad there are Members of the Republican and \nDemocratic caucuses who have been trying to do that. We will see where that goes. The President has put this \nproposal on the table that dramatically cuts immigration into this country because he sees immigration as a core \nweakness of this country. He views new entrants to America as an economic drain. That is why he wants to \npotentially kick out 3 million Dreamer kids next month if we don't act. That is why he wants to dramatically cut \ndown the number of people who are allowed to legally immigrate to America. He views immigrants as a problem \nthat needs to be dealt with. And he is not alone. Many Americans agree. I, frankly, hear from them regularly in \nConnecticut. Frankly, one could also argue that there is nothing more American than being scared of immigrants. \nEvery single new wave of immigrants to our shores has been met with some degree of fear and derision and \nprejudice. Like clockwork, every generation or two, American politicians denounce immigrants as a threat to the \nAmerican-born worker. In the 1850s, growing numbers of Catholic immigrants from Ireland--as the Murphys came--\nand from Germany led to an anti-immigrant party arising in this country that elected more than 100 Congressmen, \neight Governors, and thousands of local politicians. They claimed that Catholics could never be Americans \nbecause they owed allegiance to the Pope. Starting in the 1880s, hundreds of thousands of Chinese immigrants \nbegan to immigrate to the west coast, causing a spike in anti-Chinese sentiment that eventually resulted in the \npassage of something called the Chinese Exclusion Act. Fearing those who are different from us in skin color or \nreligion or national origin or language is an unmistakable facet of American history, but over and over again, we \nhave overcome these base instincts because our better angels prevail but also because of this bright, straight line \nthat connects America's liberal immigration policy with our economic greatness. I want to take just a couple of \nminutes to make for you a compact but irrefutable case for the correlation between economic power and American \nimmigrants. From 1870 to 1910, it is no coincidence that America's transformation into a global economic \npowerhouse occurred during a period of massive influx of human capital. During that time, nearly 15 percent of all \nAmericans were foreign-born. That is a share that our country has never reached since then. This period of \nunprecedented growth forever dispelled the myth that we still labor under today that the number of American jobs is \n\n\n\nfixed. Immigrants increase demand, and that increased demand creates jobs. Organizations from the National \nAcademy of Sciences to the conservative Cato Institute have done their own studies on this question and have \ncome to the same conclusion. Cato recently said this: Immigrants add jobs, in part by raising consumer demand. So \ngetting rid of immigrants, such as by deporting unauthorized workers, would most likely destroy jobs and raise \nnative unemployment. That makes sense, right? But if you don't believe that immigrants create growth, there is \nanother, even simpler explanation as to why we need robust immigration. At present birth rates, we don't have \nenough people born here to fill all the jobs that are going to be created in the next 20 years. It is estimated that, \naccounting for growth, America is going to need 83 million new workers to enter the workforce in the next 20 years. \nBut here is the problem. Only 51 million new workers will be native-born. That leaves us 32 million short. Unless \nfolks start churning out a lot more babies, immigration is the only way to fix that deficit. Not convinced? Well, think \nabout how the Federal budget works. Most of our budget is social insurance--working-age Americans paying into \naccounts that pay benefits to older, nonworking Americans. You need a balance between the two in order to not go \nbankrupt. Many of our competitor nations around the world are spiraling toward this demographic cataclysm. By \n2030, the median age in Japan, with strict immigration policies, is going to be over 50. It is extraordinary. Do you \nwant to know why Germany is so interested in bringing refugees into their country? Because without them, their \nmedian age in 2030 will be 48. Budgets simply can't work with that many retirees and that few workers. Because of \nAmerica's liberal immigration policy, our average age, which today is 38, will increase in 2030 to just 39. During \nthat time, China--another country that doesn't really allow immigration-- will go from having a median age that is 2 \nyears younger than that of the United States to 3 years older. In 2010, undocumented immigrants and their \nemployers sent $13 billion to Social Security. Without them, the trust fund would be out of money today. You are not \nthere yet? Let's talk jobs. Just ask your farmers in your State how important lower skilled immigration is to keeping \ntheir farms afloat. But let's talk about high-skilled jobs. Would it shock you to know that 31 percent of Ph.D holders \nin this country are immigrants? It is amazing. And more than one-quarter of all high-quality patents in the United \nStates are being granted to immigrants. How about a study from 3 years ago that Senator Cortez Masto referred to \nthat found that immigrants are twice as likely as native-born Americans to start a business. That is not good \nenough for you? Here is a mind blower: 43 percent of Fortune 500 companies in the United States were founded or \ncofounded by an immigrant or a child of an immigrant. You know who they are. The founder of eBay came to the \nUnited States from France, where he was born to Iranian parents. Google's cofounder, Sergey Brin, emigrated with \nhis family from Russia when he was 6. [[Page S950]] Elon Musk, who started SpaceX, which has 4,000 employees, \ncame from South Africa. Daniel Aaron, who cofounded Comcast, was a refugee of Nazi Germany. Henry Ford was \nan Irish immigrant. Estee Lauder's family was Hungarian. Herman Hollerith, one of the founders of IBM, had \nGerman parents. You don't want Ford or IBM or Google to be part of the American story? Then keep saying \nimmigrants are an economic drain. Margaret Thatcher once marveled of America: ``No other nation has so \nsuccessfully combined people of different races and nations within a single culture.'' This combination is our \ndefinition as a nation, but it is also the story of our economic greatness, of our sprawling leap in under two short \ncenturies from an idea to the biggest, most dynamic economy on the face of the planet. To deny that history or to \nmisremember it would be perhaps an irreversible error. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator \nfrom Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, some of what I just heard, I can readily agree to. Certain things, such as \nthat we are a nation of immigrants-- no doubt about that. We need immigrants. We take roughly 800,000 to 1 million \nlegal immigrants a year. They are welcomed. We also, though, are a nation of laws, and as a nation of laws, we \nwant people to come here according to our laws and abide by the laws. We are working with a group of people. If \nyou call them DACAs, it would be about 800,000. If you refer to them as Dreamers, it is maybe 1.8 million. We \nobviously have sympathy for them because as a baby brought here in diapers by a person or family who crossed \nour border without papers, hence entering our country illegally--we don't attribute the sin and the unlawfulness of \nthe parent to the baby. A lot of that has happened. There is a general agreement--maybe not everybody in my \npolitical party agrees with this, but I think 80 percent of them do--that we need to deal with people who are here \nthrough no fault of their own and give them legal status. That is the compassion we are showing for people who \nbroke our laws by their parents doing it but not the kids doing it. I also didn't ever think we would be here today \ndebating this because I went through the 2013 debate on immigration. The Senate passed a bill; the House of \nRepresentatives didn't take it up. I was in the minority at that time, both in the caucus that was in the minority as \nwell as in the minority that voted against that bill, because I didn't think it did things the way I would do them. \nEverything died in the House of Representatives. Then, 2 years later, I became chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. We have jurisdiction over immigration legislation. I could have spent 3 months on immigration during \n\n\n\n2015 or 2016 and sent a bill to the House of Representatives that probably would have died, but I made up my mind \nearly in my chairmanship that I wanted to do things that we could get passed. So over the period of the last \nCongress, my committee voted out 31 bills, all bipartisan, and 18 of them got to a Democratic President. In 2015 \nand 2016, I felt, why go through that process if it is going to die in the House of Representatives? Now, a year later, \nafter the election of a President who campaigned so much against anything dealing with immigration and \nlegalization of people who are here--even young people, whom he has now come to the conclusion we ought to \nlegalize--I didn't think we would be having this debate, and somehow I think Members of the Democratic Party didn't \nthink we would be having this debate. I think they probably were shocked 2 or 3 weeks ago when the government \nshut down and when the majority leader decided to make an agreement to bring up this issue. But here we are, \ndebating an immigration bill that, quite frankly, I didn't think we would be debating. Here we are. Then, of course, \nwe didn't do anything Monday. We didn't do anything on this issue Tuesday. I don't know whether we are going to \nhave any votes today, but here we are debating immigration. We have a chance to do what Members of the other \npolitical party, as advocates for Dreamers and DACA kids--and we have them on this side but maybe not as vocal \nor as loyal as Democrats are on this issue. Somehow, we are now having a difficult time getting the issue up and \ngetting something passed. I offer to my 99 colleagues something the President said he would sign. Maybe you don't \nlike exactly what is in that proposal. Then get it up and amend it, and let's see what sort of compromise we can \naccomplish. But we are here because the leader said that we are going to work on this issue. It was something that \nthe minority demanded. We ought to reach a conclusion on it and get something to the President of the United \nStates. Once we knew that this issue was going to come up--and we knew that on September 5 when the President \nsaid that he was not going to continue the illegal approach to the DACA kids that President Obama did. We have \nreason to believe this from court decisions on older people where they ruled that the President didn't have the \nauthority to do what he did with the DACA kids. In fact, at least a dozen times before he made that decision, he was \ntelling the entire country he didn't have the authority to do it, and then he went ahead and did it. So this President \ncomes in, takes an oath to uphold the Constitution and the laws of this country, and he decides that he can't \ncontinue what was considered illegal activity by the previous President. This is a congressional decision that needs \nto be made, and Congress ought to make it. We were told on September 5 to do something by March 5, and here \nwe are. I heard from the previous speaker--and maybe a lot of speakers--that this is the President's plan. Yes, this \nis something that the President said that he is going to support and will sign, but I want to say to you that the work \nthat a group of us Senators have put into this issue over a period of the last 3 months, with about 18 meetings, 4 \nmeetings with the President of the United States to discuss the issue--most of what is in the proposal that is put \nbefore you are things that a group of Senators put together. I would say that as our group met, we probably had \nsubgroups of three who had different views, and some of them felt strongly about their positions, but everyone \ncame together in a compromise that you see here before us in my amendment. In some of those meetings, we \ndiscussed these things with the President, and I want to give the President credit. In a January 9 meeting that he \nhad where he called together 23 of us--bipartisan and bicameral--we were able to dial down all the things that we \nwould be discussing on immigration, and we came to the conclusion that there were four main points that we \nought to be dealing with. You have heard of these as the four pillars, but let me repeat them. No. 1 was legalization \nof these children who were brought here by their parents; No. 2 was border security; No. 3 was chain migration; and \nNo. 4, diversity visa. We discussed these things with the President, and I suppose the President probably \nemphasized citizenship to a greater extent than maybe we did in our deliberations, but we have something that has \nbeen put together by Members of this body who have compromised, with none of us getting everything we wanted. \nWe are fortunate enough to have the President's backing on this. So I hope that you see this, not as we have heard \nfrom the other side as the President's plan--as if seven of us who introduced this proposal somehow just took \nsomething from the White House and put our names on it, and it is here before the U.S Senate--because that isn't \nhow it worked. I want to address some of the issues that have been put before us by people on the other side. I \nwant to express--as you probably have seen me expressing already in my remarks so far--my frustration with the \ncurrent status of the immigration debate here in the U.S Senate. It amazes me that my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle simply aren't ready to have a serious immigration debate. They have been demanding to have this \ndebate for months. They have even shut the government down to get to this point, and now we are actually on this \nissue that they have been demanding that we debate for months during this Congress--some on the other side of \nthe aisle for [[Page S951]] years--and now when it is time to put up or shut up, they have come up emptyhanded. \nDespite having weeks to prepare, Senate Democrats are still rushing to put some plan together. Let that sink in. \nThink about this just for a moment. The Senate Democrats recklessly shut down the Federal Government over \n\n\n\nimmigration, and they did it over plans that they still largely haven't drafted. That should be very frustrating, not \nonly to this Senator but to most of my colleagues, and it is exactly why the American people seem to have less faith \nin this process in Washington, DC. Even more frustrating is that for 2 valuable days, they have refused to allow the \nSenate to debate immigration measures. I do understand why the Democrats are afraid to vote on ending \nsanctuary cities. Those policies of sanctuary cities are massively unpopular with the American people. In other \nwords, the American people feel that when the Constitution says that immigration law is one of the 18 powers of \nthe United States, then no local or State government should be able to interfere with what the Constitution says is \nthe supreme law of the land. I can't understand why, for 2 days, Democrats have refused to allow us a debate on an \nissue like sanctuary cities. That amendment would help us keep our communities safe from dangerous criminals, \nbesides carrying out the intent of the Constitution that the Federal Government has complete authority over \nimmigration. Who could be against an approach to send a signal that sanctuary cities aren't justified when that is \nhow to protect the American people from the criminal elements that some sanctuary cities protect? Apparently, the \nDemocrats are, since they don't seem to be for outlawing sanctuary cities. I guess another way to say it is that they \ncould do more to protect hard-working Americans from the criminal element that is, albeit, a small part of the \nimmigration community we are talking about, but it still creates havoc for people like the Steinle family, for \nexample, where Kate was murdered by an alien who was a felon who had returned to this country not once but five \ntimes. In other words, I have to ask my colleagues whether enforcement issues are legitimately a part of the \nimmigration debate, and that is what the sanctuary city situation is all about. Isn't border security more than just \nthrowing money at infrastructure? Shouldn't we be discussing how to reform our Nation's laws so that dangerous \ncriminal elements can't inflict harm on innocent families? I am pretty sure--I am actually 100 percent confident--the \nanswer to those questions is yes. Those are important issues to the American people. Those issues used to be \ndiscussed here. I have already mentioned the name of Kate Steinle, who was murdered by one of these people. I \ncould add the names of Sarah Root and Jamel Shaw. These people all had dreams, too, but they had their lives \nended by felons who had been deported but had come back into this country. If my colleagues were actually \nserious about debating this issue, we would be discussing border enforcement. Sadly, it seems as though the plans \nthat I have seen so far from my colleagues fall short of that goal. Legalizing Dreamers--yes, who is going to argue \nwith that? A little bit of money for border security--there is a lot to argue about there. But not doing something about \ncriminal aliens who are a threat to law enforcement in this country and to the safety of our country--it seems to me \nthat ought to be a part of it. So we get all the people in this room who say they want to do something about border \nsecurity by throwing money at it; yet they refuse to actually give our law enforcement the legal tools that they need \nto protect Americans. Just a wall or whatever you want to call it--electric surveillance, more border patrol--it is all \nborder security, but it is more than a wall. It takes more than just those things to protect the American people. I am \nhere to tell you that it is a tragedy that some people in this body just want to legalize some people for 1 year, 2 \nyears, or 3 years and put maybe a little bit of money into border security with no commitment to the future. Then all \nwe have done is kick the can down the road. Worse still, none of my colleagues' proposals are being developed in a \nway that they can actually become law. Maybe for them, simply passing a partisan bill is enough. Leader Schumer \nsaid that this morning, and I was here listening to him. But that is not enough for this Senator. This Senator actually \nwants to see something passed into law that will provide real protection for DACA kids. That is why I have offered \nan amendment that could actually pass the House of Representatives, and we know the President would sign it. \nPolls show that the framework a number of us developed, along with the President's input, is overwhelmingly \npopular. A Harvard Harris poll showed that 65 percent of the voters agreed with our plan, including 64 percent of \nDemocratic voters. So despite the hyperbole we hear from our colleagues, the plan that the President said he would \nsign is not only popular, but, again, it is the only plan that has any chance of becoming law. It is time for all of my \ncolleagues to get serious about fixing DACA. It is time to stop posturing, to stop showboating, and to stop simply \ntrying to pass a bill out of the Senate that will not get considered in the other body and will not be signed by the \nPresident of the United States. The focus ought to be on making actual law. If all of us here in the Senate, \nparticularly those who are in the Democratic Caucus, focus on those things, then the choice for them will be very \nclear. They will vote for the amendment that the seven of us have put before the Senate called the Grassley \namendment, they will back the President, and they will provide real security and real certainty to the DACA \nrecipients and the American people. In fact, it is so simple for some on the other side who have been promising \nDACA certainty for years and some for a few months, but, more importantly, really strongly over the last three or \nfour months. It is an opportunity for everything you have told those kids, including that you are going to get them \nlegal and even give them a path to citizenship that you can deliver. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. \n\n\n\nThe Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the issue that we are dealing with \non the floor, and I am grateful for this opportunity. I wanted to first of all stress the critical urgency that we act to \nprotect America's Dreamers. The United States is a proud Nation of immigrants. Yet in September the \nadministration insulted our values by announcing a decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \nProgram, which we know by the acronym DACA. Dreamers are young people who have lived in our country since \nthey were children. They are law-abiding residents who have learned English. They have paid taxes, and they have \nsecured jobs to support themselves and their families. Our government promised them that they would be protected \nif they came forward, and now the administration, at least so far, has broken that promise. Democrats have been \nfighting for something on the Dream Act since the administration first announced its decision on DACA more than 5 \nmonths ago. We have yet to vote on a single piece of bipartisan legislation to protect Dreamers. I do, however, \ncommend the bipartisan work of a number of my colleagues in both parties who have come to the table to draft \nlegislation that protects Dreamers and secures our border. With hundreds--soon to be thousands--of Dreamers \nlosing protection every day, it is critical that we come together to pass bipartisan legislation that will provide \npermanent protections for these remarkable young people. Dreamers are deeply integrated into communities \nacross Pennsylvania, as well as in a lot of other States and across our country, of course. Dreamers work as \nnurses, caring for our families. They work as teachers, educating our children, and as servicemen and \nservicewomen in our military, working to keep us safe. Take a young Pennsylvania Dreamer whom I met a few \nmonths ago--way back, I guess, in September. She was [[Page S952]] studying to be a nurse. Talking about her \nown life, she said: All I want to do is heal people. All I want to do is be a nurse. Then she became very upset \nthinking about whether or not she might have that opportunity because of what had not happened in Washington-- \nno legislation passed to protect her. Another Dreamer from Lancaster, PA--the Presiding Officer knows that part of \nour State well--is Audrey Lopez. Audrey was brought to the United States from Peru when she was just 11 years \nold. Audrey spent most of her childhood in Pennsylvania, and her parents instilled in her the value of hard work and \neducation. Like so many Dreamers, Audrey only learned that she was undocumented when she was applying to \ncollege and learned that she did not have a Social Security number. Despite not having access to financial aid, \nAudrey worked hard, and she graduated from college. After graduation, she took a job in public service working at \nChurch World Services, assisting refugees with resettlement. This past fall, Audrey accepted a nearly full \nscholarship to American University, where she will obtain a master's degree in international development. Audrey is \nan American in every way but not on paper. She is continuing to work hard, despite not knowing if she will have a \nfuture in the country she calls home. We should be supporting young, hard-working people like Audrey who want to \nwork in the service of others and our Nation. Instead, some, but not all--not all--Republicans are threatening her \nfuture--not only her future, but our Nation's future--by making us less safe and, frankly, damaging our economy. \nProtecting Dreamers is not only the right thing to do, but it is also good for the American economy, and it is in our \nnational security interests. DACA has enabled almost 800,000 young people to grow and thrive in America, \nincluding about 5,900 in Pennsylvania. As part of the fabric of our community, these impressive young people, like \nAudrey, provide an enormous contribution to our society, including paying an estimated $2 billion each year in State \nand local taxes. By contrast, repealing DACA would amount to a loss of $460.3 billion from the national GDP over \nthe next decade. So if you want to do it by year, it is roughly $46 billion a year for each of the 10 years. In \nPennsylvania, ending DACA would result in an annual loss of $357.1 million to the State GDP, according to the \nCenter for American Progress. Currently, about 900 Dreamers are serving in the U.S military and more than one out \nof every seven DACA-eligible immigrants has language skills that are currently in short supply in the U.S military. It \nmakes no sense to remove these Dreamers from a country they call home. I believe it is both wrong and \ndangerous. The American people overwhelmingly support allowing Dreamers to stay in the United States. It is \nabout time Congress listened to the nearly 80 percent of Americans who want to pass protections for Dreamers, \nalong with increased border security so we can prevent this situation in the future. So it is time for action. We need \na real compromise solution that will get 60 votes in the Senate and, of course, 218 votes in the House, and a \nsignature from the President of the United States. While I have advocated in the past for a clean vote on the \nbipartisan Dream Act, which is what I would prefer, compromise will be critical to ensuring we get something done \nand sent to the President's desk. In 2013, I and many others--67 other Senators--voted for a bipartisan \nimmigration bill that would have doubled the number of Border Patrol agents. That bill also would have mandated \n24-hour surveillance of the border using advanced technology, like drones, and it would have provided a pathway to \ncitizenship for law-abiding immigrants. There are a number of bipartisan proposals to pair Dreamer protections with \ndata-driven, sensible border security that focuses on public safety. I look forward to finally voting on these issues, \n\n\n\nand I hope my Republican colleagues will continue to work with us to secure our border and ensure that Dreamers \nlike Audrey Lopez have a future they can count on. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The \nPRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER \n(Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I want to speak about our \nimmigration debate and my amendment in particular, but first let me say we are going to find out just how serious \nour colleagues are about granting not just legal status to the Dreamers--people who came to this country or were \nbrought here illegally when they were children and couldn't and shouldn't be held accountable for that action. The \nproposal that will be available for a vote later this week will not just grant legal status but will actually grant a path to \ncitizenship. It goes well beyond the illegal Executive order President Obama issued, and it will be available to far \nmore people than those who took up President Obama's illegal Executive order. It is really going to be an \nextraordinary moment. I hope we are able to reach an agreement on this because I think this needs to get done. Mr. \nPresident, I want to first address an amendment I have offered that is now up and pending--and I think we will be \nvoting on it at some point this week--which is all about keeping our communities safer by addressing the terrible \nproblem of sanctuary cities. This is a problem that one father in particular knows all too well. On July 1 of 2015, Jim \nSteinle was walking arm in arm with his daughter Kate on a pier in San Francisco. Suddenly, a gunman sprang out \nand opened fire, hitting Kate. She pleaded, ``Help me, Dad,'' as she bled to death in her father's arms. Now, any \nmurder is appalling, but one of the things that makes this even more appalling is that the shooter should never have \nbeen on the pier that day. The fact is, he was an illegal immigrant who had been convicted of seven felonies and \nhad been deported five times, but even more galling is, 3 months before the day he murdered Kate Steinle, this \nmurderer was in the custody of the San Francisco Police Department. They had him. He was in custody. They had \nhim on an old warrant for a previous crime. When the Department of Homeland Security found out that the San \nFrancisco Police Department had this guy in custody, they immediately reached out and said: Hold this guy until we \ncan get someone there to take him into custody. We know he is dangerous, we know he is here illegally, and we \nwant to get him out of this country, but the San Francisco Police couldn't provide that minimal cooperation. Instead, \nthey released this man back onto the streets from which, 3 months later, he murdered young Kate Steinle. Why \nwould the police of San Francisco do a thing like that? Why in the world would they refuse to provide this minimal \ncooperation with immigration authorities with respect to a dangerous individual? The reason is because San \nFrancisco is a sanctuary city. That means it has as its explicit legal policy a prohibition that forbids their police from \ncooperating with Federal immigration officials, even if the police want to. It extends to other law enforcement, like \nsheriffs and deputy sheriffs. This is the case even when local law enforcement authorities believe the person is \ndangerous, and the local law enforcement folks wish to cooperate with the Federal authorities because they know \nthis person is a threat to the security of their community, but local politicians override the police and decide this will \nbe a sanctuary city. Such is the case with San Francisco, and so the San Francisco Police had no choice. They \nwere required by local laws to release this man onto the streets. One of the many ironies about sanctuary cities is if \nFederal officials had called the San Francisco Police about any number of other crimes--robbery, car theft, violating \na trademark, counterfeiting--any number of other Federal crimes, then the San Francisco Police would have been \nallowed to cooperate. They would have been happy [[Page S953]] to cooperate. They would have been able to \ncooperate, but because the crime was committed by an illegal immigrant, the police's hands were tied. The police \nwere forced to release Kate Steinle's killer. It is just unbelievable to me that we have communities across the \ncountry that wish to provide this special privilege--this special protection--for even dangerous criminals because \nthey are here illegally. It is unbelievable, but that is the case. Sadly, the Steinles are not alone. They are not the \nonly family who has been affected this way because, of course, San Francisco is not our Nation's only sanctuary \ncity. Philadelphia--the fifth largest city in America, the largest city in my home State--has an extreme sanctuary city \npolicy, and it has had appalling consequences already. Maybe the most heartbreaking of these is the case of \nRamon Aguirre- Ochoa. Ochoa was a Honduran national in the United States illegally. He was deported in 2009, \nbut he illegally reentered the United States, which is itself a felony. He found his way to Philadelphia, and in 2015 \nthe Philadelphia Police arrested him on charges of aggravated assault and various other crimes. When the \nbackground check went through, the Department of Homeland Security saw that the Philadelphia Police had this \nguy. They knew who this guy was. They knew he was here illegally, they knew he had been deported, and they \nbelieved him to be the dangerous criminal that he was. So they asked the Philadelphia Police: Could you hold this \nguy for 24, 48 hours, until we can get an agent there to take him into custody and begin deportation proceedings? \nWe know he is a bad guy. We want him out of the country. Unfortunately, Philadelphia Police had to refuse. \n\n\n\nInstead, they released him onto the city streets in January 2015. The Philadelphia D.A didn't feel like he had \nenough evidence to prosecute the case. He dropped the charges, and rather than cooperate with the Department of \nHomeland Security, they released Ochoa back onto the streets of Philadelphia. That was January of 2015. In July \nof 2016, Ochoa was arrested for raping a child under the age of 13. This brutal attack on the child was only possible \nbecause Philadelphia is a sanctuary city. It is these appalling cases--like the Steinle case or this case in \nPhiladelphia-- that make it so important that we end these sanctuary cities if it is at all possible to do so. My \namendment is a bipartisan amendment. It is identical to a bill I introduced and the Senate voted to consider in 2016. \nI reintroduced it in 2017. It does two things: It tackles a legal liability for localities that wish to cooperate with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and, with that legal liability problem solved, it imposes penalties on communities \nthat choose nevertheless to be sanctuary cities. We don't have the authority as a Federal Government to dictate the \npolicy that a local community must follow. There is a constitutional separation that gives them the power to do what \nthey will, but we don't have to subsidize their behavior when it endangers all of us, and that is what my legislation \ngoes after. So let me discuss first the legal liability issue. There are now at least two court decisions that have put \npressure on municipalities, localities, to be sanctuary cities. Over a dozen Pennsylvania counties have done so. \nOne is a Third Circuit decision; the second is a Federal district court in Oregon. They have held that if the \nDepartment of Homeland Security makes a mistake and they make a detainer request--let's say it is a case of \nwrongful identity. They ask a local police force to hold someone who, in fact, is an American citizen, should be here \nand is here legally, and so it is therefore an erroneous detention. If that happens and the local law enforcement \nfolks comply with that request, under these court decisions, the local municipality can be held liable for the ensuing \nlitigation on the part of the person who is wrongly detained. My bill addresses this problem by simply saying that \nwhen a local law enforcement officer complies with an immigration detainer request from DHS that is a duly issued \nand bona fide request, then the local officer has the same authority as a DHS official. In a way, the officer would be \nconsidered an agent of the Department of Homeland Security for this purpose, and the entity the person would then \nsue in the event that a person is wrongly detained and their civil rights are violated would be the Federal \nGovernment. The responsibility should be on the Federal Government, since it was, after all, a request that initiated \nwith the Federal Government. My legislation does not in any way curb an individual's ability to file a suit if their civil \nor constitutional rights are violated, whether it is intentional or accidental. There is no curb on an individual's ability \nto redress that if they were wrongfully detained. It simply transfers the liability from the municipality to the origination \nof the detainer request, which is the Department of Homeland Security. So that is the first part: solve the legal \nliability problem which has some municipalities across America--certainly in my State of Pennsylvania--choosing to \nbe sanctuary cities, even though they would rather not be. Now, having addressed that, if our legislation is adopted, \nand we have thereby solved this legal liability problem, if a community nevertheless decides it is going to endanger \nall the rest of us by conferring this special protection on somebody just because they came here illegally--despite \nthe fact that they may well be a dangerous criminal--in that case, under my amendment, that community will be \ndeemed a sanctuary city, and under my amendment several types of Federal funding would be withheld from it. \nSpecifically, we would withhold from the sanctuary cities community development block grants and certain grants \nfrom the Economic Development Administration. I think this is eminently reasonable. Sanctuary cities impose costs \non all of us. They raise the cost to the Federal Government of enforcing immigration law, but by far outweighing \nthat is the cost to the American people of more crime and the unbelievable, staggering cost to families like Jim \nSteinle and his family, who lost their daughter. I think it is extremely reasonable to have as a policy that if a \ncommunity chooses to impose those costs on the rest of us, the Federal Government will not be subsidizing it. Let \nme debunk some of the misinformation that is occasionally disseminated about my amendment. One is that it is \nsomehow anti- immigrant. This is not anti-immigrant at all; this is pro-immigrant. The fact is, the vast, overwhelming \nmajority of immigrants in America, legal and illegal, would never commit these terrible crimes; there is no question \nabout that. It is also obviously the case that any very large number of people will include some criminals among \nthem. There are roughly 11 million people who are here illegally--11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. \nSome of them are certainly violent criminals. It makes no sense to insulate those violent criminals, however few \nthey may be, from capture by law enforcement. It would be absurd to allege that this is somehow anti- immigrant \nwhen quite likely some of their victims will be other immigrants. Immigrants want to live in safe communities too. I \nam positive of that. They don't want dangerous criminals to be able to walk the streets just because they came here \nillegally. The second point I want to stress is that this amendment does not discourage or punish illegal immigrants \nfor coming forward to report a crime. This is important because folks who want to keep sanctuary cities sometimes \ncharge that if my legislation were passed, victims and witnesses to crimes, if they are here illegally, wouldn't come \n\n\n\nforward. That is not so. My amendment in this underlying law explicitly states that a locality will not be labeled a \nsanctuary jurisdiction for this purpose, and therefore will not lose any Federal funds, if it has a policy stating that if a \nperson comes forward as a victim or a witness to a crime, local law enforcement will not share information with \nDHS. Let me be clear and explicit about this. We have an explicit carve- out in the legislation. If a locality chooses \nto provide sanctuary status to a victim of a crime or a witness to a crime, such a community would not lose any \nFederal funds whatsoever. We think that [[Page S954]] makes sense because we do want to encourage victims \nand witnesses of crimes to come forward. We get it. We don't want to create a worry that there would be \ndeportation consequences for them. A third point which some have alleged and which I want to be very clear about \nis that the penalties my amendment has for a community that chooses to be a sanctuary city do not include the loss \nof any funds whatsoever related to law enforcement or security. That is simply not the case. The list of categories \nthat we include in lost funding is economic development in its nature. It is not at all law enforcement. Another point \nthat some on the other side have made is that somehow this legislation, my amendment, would impose an \nunmanageable burden on law enforcement. One simple fact to consider is, if that is the case, then why has it been \nendorsed by law enforcement groups? The National Association of Police Organizations has endorsed my \namendment. The International Union of Police Associations, a division of AFL-CIO, has endorsed my amendment. \nThe Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association has endorsed my amendment. Would these groups endorse a \nbill that imposed an unworkable burden on their own members? I rather doubt it. I think they understand that this \namendment encourages local law enforcement to share information with the Department of Homeland Security and \nin some cases to temporarily and briefly hold people in custody until the Department of Homeland Security can get \nthere. This is a bipartisan amendment. In 2016, when the Senate voted on this very same amendment in the form of \na freestanding bill, it received a majority, and it had bipartisan support. Unfortunately, a minority filibustered it and \nblocked it. But the fact is, it is a bipartisan piece of legislation with majority support. I don't think it should even be \ncontroversial. I think we will have a vote on this relatively soon, in the coming days. I hope it will have very broad \nsupport. This is common sense. It stands for the principle that the safety of the American people matters, that the \nlives of Kate Steinle and other victims of violent crime matter, and that all of our communities should be as safe as \nthey can be. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Parkland, Florida, School Shooting Mr. \nBLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, watching the pictures today as I came to the floor was deeply moving. Even though \nthere is much that we don't know and a lot of information that we lack about what is happening at Marjory \nStoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL, the images of emergency vehicles and emergency responders \nand of young people and children evacuating a school after another tragic incident of gun violence brings back \nmemories that are searing and harrowing. Once again, we feel that churning in our stomach, that sense of gut-\npunch, and a wrenching of hearts that reminds us of how we felt the day of violence in Newtown. Yet another \nschool is victimized by gun violence. We are waiting to learn more of the details, but certainly our hearts and \nprayers go to the victims and their loved ones. Our gratitude goes to the courageous first responders who are on \nthe scene now apprehending the shooter and administering to the victims and survivors. My thoughts and prayers \nare with those students, emergency responders, parents, loved ones, and the community of Parkland. Again, gun \nviolence respects no boundaries. It spares no communities. It victimizes all of us, wherever it happens and \nwhenever, including the gun violence that kills people every day individually, often unpublicized and invisible. My \nheart breaks to hear that one more school is facing this unthinkable horror, that again this harrowing scene plays \nbefore the people of America, literally unfolding in real-time. I know that I and all of the Members of this Chamber \nshare the grief and sympathy and heartbreak that community is experiencing today. Mr. President, I want to talk \nabout the Connecticut Dreamers and share their stories and call for this Chamber to take narrow and focused \naction to prevent their draconian mass deportation and protect them from that kind of very unfortunate outcome. \nThe Dreamers who would be covered under legislation, which I hope will pass in the next 24 hours, came here as \nchildren. They grew up as Americans. This country is the only one they know. English is the only language many of \nthem speak. They go to our schools. They serve in our military. They support our economy. They believe in the \nAmerican dream. All of us believe in the American dream, but so do they. They work hard and give back. Deporting \nthe Dreamers would be cruel, irrational, and inhumane-- unworthy of a great country. It would break our promise to \nthe Dreamers who came forward when they were told they would be given protected status and would be a violation \nnot only of the American dream but of the promise made by a great nation. Gabriela Valdiglesias came to the \nUnited States in 2001 from Lima, Peru. She has lived in Connecticut for 17 years. She works for Connecticut \nStudents for a Dream, advocating for her fellow Dreamers. For those workers, she has been working on securing \ntheir right to safety, to higher education, to healthcare, and to live in a country without fear and discrimination. She \n\n\n\nshared with me some of the difficulties her family had while she was growing up. She and her five siblings are \nsupported by their parents, who work in minimum-wage jobs. She hopes that if the Dream Act passes, she will be \nable to take on some of the economic burden her parents now carry. She hopes she will be able to make enough \nmoney to support herself and her family. She is currently in her first year of college, at a community college, where \nshe has faced many financial challenges. Not being able to get a job at 18 years old is frustrating and sometimes \ndevastating. If the Dream Act is passed, she could finish her 2 years at community college and transfer to a 4-year \ninstitution, and she could pursue her dream of working as a lawyer or in the field of law. There are countless other \nstories of Connecticut Dreamers, some wanting to keep their identities confidential. There is a young man in \nBridgeport who was brought to Connecticut at the age of 5. He was educated in the Bridgeport public schools. He \nmajored in chemistry and now attends Fairfield University. He has excelled there. He finished his first degree and \nwas accepted at the University of California, Berkeley's physical chemistry program. He had to live under the threat \nof deportation because he had no way to apply for permanent lawful status. While he was continuing his studies \nhere, he lived with the threat of deportation. There is a New Britain woman who was born in Mexico and brought to \nAmerica when she was 6 years old. The journey was terrifying. She could barely understand what was happening. \nShe had no idea at 6 years old that she was entering America in a way that would affect her for the rest of her life. It \nwas not her choice to come here or to come here in that way, but it has affected her. In fact, despite her attending \nschool and then going to college out of State at Bay Path University and earning a great many leadership positions \nthere, she remains in the limbo of uncertainty and anguish and anxiety created by the threat of deportation. She \ndreams about helping people, making sure that families with low incomes can have access to occupational therapy. \nShe is pursuing a master's degree in occupational therapy. Finally, there is a woman I know who came here from \nVenezuela. She was brought here when she was 11 years old. She remembers her mother telling her that she was \ngoing to America to learn English. When they settled in Norwalk, CT, her mother also told her that she could be \nsuccessful if she were bilingual. She began to go to school right away. Life was difficult at the beginning, and there \nwas a lot to learn. By the time she was a junior in high school, she stopped trying to get perfect grades because she \nfeared colleges would not accept her, and even if they accepted her, she could not be eligible for financial \nassistance because she was undocumented. But she persevered, and she attended community college. She went \non to Western Connecticut State University, and she overcame obstacles that for many Americans born here \nwould be [[Page S955]] insuperable. Now facing deportation, she fears all of those dreams and all of that work will \nbe for naught. These Dreamers, in fact, have trusted America. They believed in America's promise to them. Coming \nforward, providing facts about their residence, their family, their job, and Social Security number, they believed in \nAmerica. It wasn't a dream. America is to be trusted. America is the land of opportunity. America is the greatest \nNation in the history of the world. They have a dream that is American, which is that they will have the opportunity \nto pursue their full potential as human beings to give back, to educate themselves, and to better their lives. That is \nthe American dream. In Dr. Martin Luther King's ``I Have a Dream'' speech, he said: When the architects of our \nrepublic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a \npromissory note . . . a promise that all men-- And he might have added women-- would be guaranteed the \ninalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The time has long since come for us to help the \nDreamers. The time is today for us to protect them against mass draconian deportation, a violation of a promise that \nwould be unworthy of America. The promissory note of this American dream can be made a reality by this Chamber \ntoday and tomorrow. I understand that some of my colleagues may want to change the immigration system. It is \ntruly a broken system in need of comprehensive reform. That task is for another day. Today, we must make sure \nthat we provide these Dreamers with legal status and a path to citizenship. That is our moral obligation. That is our \njob. Let's get it done. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. LANKFORD. \nMr. President, the Senate is probably interested in the status of the debate on immigration. This debate started in \nSeptember in hallways, committee rooms, and in our offices--opportunities for us to talk about these issues now for \nmonths. Several weeks ago, there was a government shutdown demanding that we actually have a vote on \nimmigration right now or that we don't reopen the government. After 3 days of government shutdown, the \ngovernment was reopened, demanding that we move the immigration debate earlier to make sure we would get \nthis done earlier. Now it is Wednesday of the week that it was supposed to occur, and the proposals are not out on \nthe table. It has been a frustrating journey. I can't even begin to count the number of hours I have spent in \nbipartisan conversations trying to circle around a simple set of issues. How do we resolve a small group of issues \nrelated to immigration? I thought this was resolved in some ways. Back in early January, there was a large \nbipartisan meeting with the House and Senate to discuss what was widely televised as the scope for immigration \n\n\n\nand the key issues we were going to address. It came down to four issues, and there was agreement among the \nleaders, among those in the room, that these are the only four issues we are going to deal with: DACA and those \nDACA-eligible and how we move them toward citizenship, border security and all the things around border security, \ndiversity visa lottery, and family reunification. All of those have been dealt with in legislation before--in fact, for \ndecades, in one version or another-- except for the issue of DACA. That one is new. That is the only one that hasn't \nbeen done with legislation before. The others all have. The Gang of 8 bill in 2013 had border security and all kinds \nof different issues related to both construction of walls, technology, and legal loopholes. It had diversity lottery. It \nhad chain migration in it. If you want to go back to an immigration study during the Clinton administration, in 1995, \nthere was a proposal put out by Barbara Jordan, the Democratic House Member from Texas, who led that particular \nstudy during the Clinton administration dealing with chain migration, dealing with how we transition to merit-based \nimmigration. This has been dealt with literally in hearings for decades, but what I have heard for the past several \nmonths is that there is no time to do any of those things. The only time that we have is to deal with DACA. We can't \neven discuss anything else. Meeting after meeting after meeting since early November, I have heard the same \nthing: There is no time. There is no time. There is no time. Now we are getting down to the day, and there is still a \nconversation about how we deal with these four simple issues that we have talked about for months, that the House \nand Senate have debated for decades, and on which we have had an untold number of hearings for decades to try \nto actually land them, to get legislation ready, and to get this resolved. Let me just focus on a few things, because a \nfew of us have put out a proposal that covers those four areas that was a middle-ground proposal. It is certainly not \neverything that I would like to have in border security, and it is certainly not everything that Democrats would like to \nhave, but it is a middle ground between all of those. It is one the White House has already announced that they will \ncertainly sign. It has 1.8 million people moving into naturalization, or citizenship. These are the individuals whose \nparents brought them illegally, but they were children at the time. Those individuals came into the country. They \nhave now lived here for years. They know no other country, on the whole. Those individuals are offered an \nopportunity to become citizens of the United States 10 years from now. Why 10 years from now? That gives a time \nperiod of 10 years, which is commonly agreed that it will take to be able to secure the border. In that 10-year time \nperiod, the border security could be put in place to make sure we have a secure border. It is not an unreasonable \nthing. In that same 10-year time period, about 2 million people are going to move, actually, into citizenship. How \ndoes that affect the rest of our process? Well, let me tell you first how it affects it. Right now we have a 20-year \nbacklog to be able to come into the United States legally--20 years to be able to come through that process. Once \nwe add another 2 million people in that process and all the family that will be connected to them, in all likelihood, \nthat backlog moves from 20 years to 25 years. It is ridiculous at 20 years, and it is even worse at 25. We all know \nthat this issue of family migration and the broad allowance of people coming in, not based on what skills they have \nbut based on being someone's brother-in-law, is not the best way to do immigration, and we are the only country \nthat does it like this. Seventy percent of the people who come into our country legally come through a family \nconnection--being someone's brother, being someone's sister, being a relative in some way that they are able to \ncome into the country. Canada, just to our north, is exactly the opposite. Sixty-three percent of the people who \ncome into Canada legally through their immigration system come because they are bringing a work skill. Now, I \ndon't want to oppose anyone coming from anywhere in the world. There is a uniqueness to the United States and \nhow we handle immigration, and we allow people from all over the world, from every country, to come. That should \nremain the same, but we should have one simple requirement: They come to bring something to the Nation. I don't \nthink that is too hard of a hill to climb. It is not a matter of who you are related to. You certainly should be able to \nbring in your spouse and your children, but brothers and sisters and other adults and such that would be in your \nfamily, maybe, should come based on their own merit, as well, for them to be able to come and be a part of our \ngreat culture, as well, or they are able to come visit and come stay long periods of time but not necessarily come for \ncitizenship, unless you are coming to bring them. Again, that doesn't seem too difficult. The diversity lottery hasn't \nbeen the challenging issue. Quite frankly, that has been an issue that was in the 2013 Gang of 8 bill, saying: Why \ndo we have 50,000 visas for individuals from anywhere, from around the world, who can come who don't \nnecessarily bring a skill at all? Why don't we just add a skill requirement or an educational requirement? We could \nsay that you are welcome to come from anywhere, but at least we should know that those who [[Page S956]] are \ncoming from anywhere and everywhere bring something to the American economy. Again, that hasn't been \ncontroversial nor partisan in the past, and now, suddenly, it has become that. The border security part of it has been \nthe most confusing part of the debate for me on this thing. Months ago, some of my Democratic colleagues over \nand over said: The wall will do nothing. There is no benefit in the wall. If you put up a 20-foot wall, there will be a 21- \n\n\n\nfoot ladder. It will do absolutely nothing. Now, the conversation is this: Well, we will give citizenship to DACA, and \nwe will give you some money to build a wall, and we will call it even. That has never been the request, and \neveryone knows it. The request has been border security, not just a wall. I am very aware that the President has \ntalked about a big beautiful wall a lot. I get that. But it has always been about border security, not just about putting \nup a wall in certain places. There has never been an emphasis to build 2,000 miles of wall. There isn't a need for a \nwall in certain urban areas, but what is really needed is border security and everyone knows it. I don't understand \nwhy border security has suddenly become a controversial issue. What we have asked for and what we have laid out \nin a proposal seems to be a very middle-ground proposal. It doesn't do interior enforcement. Quite frankly, our \nDemocratic colleagues have said: Absolutely no additional interior enforcement--we are open to border security, but \nnothing that secures the interior of the country. So we have said: OK, that will be a future bill dealing with interior \nenforcement, but we do feel like border security is very important. So they have said: OK, we will give you some \nmoney to build a wall in sections. Can I say what they are trying to exclude? Border security, when you lay it out, is \nalso the legal loopholes. So here are just a few of the things that we have laid out, which I don't think should be that \ncontroversial, that we have included in our language and said: If we are going to do border security, let's be serious \nabout it. For instance, we have asked for additional penalties for people who do human smuggling. Right now, it is a \nslap on the wrist if you do human smuggling into the country. So coyotes and others are able to do human \nsmuggling into the country in transit. There are also people who are individuals in our country watching out for \nBorder Patrol agents, radioing other people saying: Hey, Border Patrol is here. Go a different direction. They are \nactually helping to divert people away. We think we should increase the penalties. Our Democratic colleagues have \npushed back and said no on that. It doesn't seem unreasonable to increase the penalties for human smuggling and \nthe same for drug smuggling. To increase the penalties for those who are spying out and redirecting people who \nare doing drug smuggling doesn't seem too hard to be able to accomplish. We would like to allow an individual \nState and their National Guard to be able to participate with Border Patrol. Now the National Guard is not law \nenforcement. What does the National Guard bring, though? They bring helicopters that have infrared technology. \nThey are able to fly over sections of the border to be able to see the area below and to help direct Border Patrol to \nit. To participate with the National Guard and allow them to bring some of those resources those States already \nhave shouldn't be that difficult. That is just a part of border security, but our Democratic colleagues are pushing \nback on that. We would like to do an initiative to be able to work with Mexico and provide Mexico some additional \nfunding and support and consultation on their border between Guatemala and Mexico, the southern border of \nMexico--what is literally kind of our first border. It is their southern border. We have been pushed back, though, to \nsay that is not border security. It is slowing down people illegally trafficking through Central America into Mexico. \nWe think that is part of it. How about this one? All along the Rio Grande in Texas, there is Carrizo cane that are \nthere--this large cane that grows in the river in that area. In that area, you are able to hide people, drugs--whatever \nit may be--in this tall cane because you just disappear in it. It is on both sides of the border. We think we should do \nan eradication of that cane so that you can actually see through it. It hasn't been controversial in the past, but \nsuddenly it is controversial: No, we don't want to eradicate the cane. That cane is only there because it is hiding \npeople and contraband. We think we should be able to do that. We think we should be able to add an \nelectromagnetic spectrum at our border ports of entry so you can look through a vehicle, looking for chemical parts \nof the spectrum and to be able to see if we can eradicate drugs that are being trafficked into our country. I don't \nthink that should be that controversial. There is getting secure communications so that our individuals and the \nBorder Patrol can talk to each other and can interact with other law enforcement to make sure no one from a \ntransnational criminal organization is listening in. We should have license plate readers at the port of entry to be \nable to help track that and speed it up. Doing biometrics at the entry and exit is something that has been required \nsince the 9/11 Commission. So we can accelerate that process that as people come in and out of our country we \nknow when they come in legally, but we also know when they depart legally. There is dealing with what is \nsometimes called catch and release. Individuals who come into the country and cross illegally into the country are \nheld in detention for a short period of time until they get due process, and every individual gets due process. This is \nnot trying to remove due process from anyone. But as they cross into the country illegally, we are able to pick them \nup, detain them, and make sure they have due process. Some of them make claims for asylum or make claims of \ncredible fear or other things. Instead of doing a hearing on that, we actually give them a piece of paper that is called \na notice to appear and release them into the country and say: We will see you in about 2 years for your hearing \ndate--instead of actually doing the hearing right then. Nothing has changed. No facts have changed. No \ninformation has changed. Nothing has changed during that time of delay. We just release them because we don't \n\n\n\nhave enough judges or enough courts or enough attorneys or enough advocates to be able to accomplish that. So \nthey are released for years in the country. You may be surprised to know that most of the individuals never show up \nfor that hearing. They are just released into the country. There is also a statement saying: Well, what about \nunaccompanied minors? Again, you might be interested to know that three-fourths of the unaccompanied minors \nwho cross into the country are actually 14 years old or up. These are not 6-year-olds who are crossing in and 5- \nyear-olds who are crossing in. Most of them are older teenagers. Two- thirds of the people who are coming in as \nunaccompanied minors are actually teenage boys, and most of them come in to be able to work. So the question is \nthis: How do we handle that? I think we do fair detention. I think we go through the due process and make a \ndecision right then. Again, you will be interested to know that for individuals who actually do show up for their court \nhearing, which is a small group, about 30 percent of those who go to the court hearing do get asylum once they \nfinally get to the court hearing. But we are not getting to the court hearing for most of those individuals. That \nshouldn't be that controversial. We should be able to handle how we go through that process in an equitable and \nfair way. I would like us to be able to deal with the cost, quite frankly, of detention. We have asked for a simple part \nof this process on border security, to honor the taxpayer, to say that we will not spend more than $500 a night on \nhousing individuals whom we have in detention. Now, I think most Americans--certainly most Oklahomans--would \nlike to stay in a hotel that costs $500 a night. Putting a cap on how much we spend on that per person per night, I \nthink, is a reasonable thing to be able to put into it, but we have had pushback. [[Page S957]] We have asked for \nemergency immigration judges. Right now there are almost 700,000 people in a backlog in our immigration \ncourts--almost 700,000. We don't think it is unreasonable to ask for emergency judges to come in to help us with \nthe backlog. We are not talking about untrained judges. We are talking about judges who are in the Federal system \nwho are knowledgeable of these issues and to do a surge of judges to help us get caught up. We should be able to \ndo all of these things. None of these issues should be controversial. This is what it means when you start talking \nabout real border security, not just adding a wall in some places, not just adding a couple of additional agents but \nactually putting the things around them that they need to actually be able to enforce the law. I think people lose \ntrack of the fact that ICE folks and Customs and Border Patrol are not enemies of our State. They are American law \nenforcement. They work for our country to keep us safe and to enforce the laws of our Nation. I am appalled at the \nway they are spoken of on this floor and treated in conversations. They are American law enforcement enforcing \nAmerican laws. If there is a problem with what they are enforcing, this body should vote on it and fix the law, not \nbeat up on the people who are enforcing the law and doing what we have asked them to do as a Congress. I hope \nin the days ahead we can actually get this passed. I hope we can actually move toward citizenship for 1.8 million \npeople, which the President has asked for, and I think it is a reasonable thing to be able to do for those individuals \nwho came into our country as children. But I also hope that this time we don't say that we are going to do \ncitizenship and not do border security. I hope we don't just throw some money and pretend we are doing it. I hope \nwe, as a body, can have a serious conversation and say: Let's actually do border security and help us as a nation to \nestablish a secure border. I hope we actually deal with some of the biggest issues on immigration and can walk \nthrough this debate in a reasonable way without the emotion and heat, but thinking this through because this affects \nthe future of our country for a very long time. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The \nSenator from Delaware. Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about an issue that has occupied this \nfloor, this body, this Congress for some time now: the challenge of how to fix our broken immigration system. As \nmany of us have debated and talked and tried to find common ground and a bipartisan path forward, I wanted to \nspeak about why I have optimism that we can find a bipartisan solution to this challenge. I know I am not alone in \nmy optimism about this. One of my very dearest friends in the Senate, someone I respect and admire deeply, \nsomeone who knows more about sacrifice and patriotism than anyone I have ever met, believes the same thing. \nThis friend of mine is not just any Senator. It is Mr. John McCain, the senior Senator from Arizona, who also \nhappens to be an American hero and someone who has literally fought for this country and its values throughout his \nentire life. He is someone whom our mutual friend, former Vice President Joe Biden, calls a ``man of . . . deep \nconviction, and unmatched character.'' John McCain is exactly the person the Senate and this country needs in \ntimes like this, when the way forward is unclear, when our disagreements seem too wide, when our instincts are to \nargue rather than listen. This Chamber and this country need someone who is able to show us a way forward and \nlead us out of our stubborn, sometimes too partisan fights--someone like Senator McCain. As this debate has \nprogressed in recent days, I have been reminded of something I heard Senator McCain say late last year when he \naccepted the Liberty Medal from the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. When speaking about our country \nand when speaking about the opportunity he has had here, he said: What a privilege it is to serve this big, \n\n\n\nboisterous, brawling, intemperate, striving, daring, beautiful, bountiful, brave, magnificent country. With all our flaws, \nall our mistakes, with all the frailties of human nature as much on display as our virtues, with all the rancor and \nanger of our politics, we are blessed. We are living in the land of the free, the land where anything is possible. The \nland of the immigrants' dream, the land with the storied past forgotten in the rush to an imagined future. What a \ncountry, indeed. Beautiful, brave, and magnificent, as John said, but also challenged by occasional frailty, rancor, \nand anger that we have seen too much of in this sustained debate over immigration. The point Senator McCain \nmade that night in Philadelphia--and the point he has made every day serving our Nation for more than six \ndecades--is that working through our disagreements, our divisions is worth it, not just as Senators but as citizens. \nThe whole point is, we may be boisterous and intemperate, which John has certainly also been accused of being a \ntime or two, but we don't stop striving for our ideals, believing in our future, and respecting one another. That is \noften difficult--especially here in politics--but it is the challenge that comes with the blessings of living and serving \nthis great country. So I was honored when Senator McCain reached out to me a week ago to say: Let's work \ntogether to introduce in the Senate legislation that could help solve our most pressing immigration issues and keep \nour country moving forward. The bipartisan bill we have introduced--the McCain-Coons bill--in the Senate doesn't \nsolve every immigration issue we face, and it doesn't try to. What our bill does is focus on two issues right in front \nof us that I believe we can address and resolve. It is an attempt to break through what have been messy and \ndivisive political debates and to address, through a compromise, legitimate, substantive issues in front of us. Our bill \nwould do two things: secure our border and finally give Dreamers the pathway to citizenship they have long awaited \nfor, and they deserve. First, to address border security, our bill would ensure we gain operational control of the \nborder by 2020 with new technology, new resources for Federal, State, and local law enforcement, and new \ninfrastructure. It would reduce the existing immigration case backlogs by funding new judges and new attorneys, \nwhile also addressing one of the root causes of migration into our country from Central America. Our legislation \nwould give certainty to 1.8 million Dreamers brought here as children through no fault of their own, who are \nAmerican in every way but the paperwork. Dreamers who continue to play by the rules by going to school, serving \nin the military, or being consistently employed can become lawful, permanent residents and, at least 5 years later, \nU.S citizens. Senator McCain and I aren't the only ones who think this bipartisan solution makes sense. In fact, the \nreason we filed it here was because of the strength of its development in the other Chamber, the people's House, \nthe House of Representatives. This bill was crafted by Republican Congressman Will Hurd of El Paso, TX, whose \ndistrict has more than 800 miles of the U.S -Mexico border--more than any district in our country with a U.S -Mexico \nborder--and his partner, Democratic Congressman Pete Aguilar, who is from Southern California. The two of them \nput this bill together after a lot of consultation and meetings with their colleagues in the House. Today, it enjoys 27 \nRepublican cosponsors and 27 Democratic cosponsors. I often hear we shouldn't take up and consider anything \nthat can't pass the House, but a bill that has 54 bipartisan cosponsors in the House is certainly on the right track. \nNow, I am clear-eyed about the fact that this McCain-Coons bill is not perfect, and I understand some of my \ncolleagues may want to make changes to it. Some of my Republican friends I have met with and heard from and \ntalked to in recent days have suggested it needs more investments in border security to win their support, and that \nis fine because our bill is more than just a set of policies. It is a way to provide a framework for us to agree and not \nlet our disagreements prevent us from moving forward. So my message is simple about this bill: We may not be \nable to fix our entire immigration system this week--in fact, I am certain we can't--but we can, over the next few \ndays, perhaps [[Page S958]] even over the next few hours, take important, even historic steps forward. We can lay \nthe groundwork for securing our border with new investments, new technology, and new manpower. We can help \nDreamers succeed in American schools, serve in our American military, and enrich American communities without \nliving in constant fear of imminent deportation. These are tough issues, but the solution can be fairly simple. I think \nour legislation offers a real solution for right now. There have been developments in recent days. I have been proud \nto participate in a large bipartisan effort by the Common Sense Coalition, and as it has, as a group, tried to hammer \nout a bipartisan deal, I have been honored to have started this discussion, this debate, with Senator McCain by \nfiling our bill that we brought over from the House. It is a bipartisan bill that I believe is the most bipartisan bill \ncurrently before this Chamber on this issue. If we can make more progress, if we can attract more bipartisan \nsupport through some amendments or revisions, I welcome that. I believe this week, this day, this opening on our \nSenate floor is not only a challenge but an incredible opportunity to do the right thing. We don't have to agree on \neverything. We just have to agree on some things, and we can find a way forward together. It is an enormous honor \nto have the opportunity to partner with Senator McCain in this legislative effort. While he is not with us today, I know \nhe is with us in spirit and watching our deliberations, and he is someone who has shown not just courage on the \n\n\n\nbattlefield but courage in American politics--a determined willingness to compromise and to work tirelessly to \nadvance the interests of the American people. I can only hope my colleagues, when we get a chance to vote on this \nbill--which I hope we will later today--will join me in supporting it in recognition of his lifetime of service to our Nation \nand his commitment to bipartisanship. It is my hope that as this day and tomorrow unfolds, we will have the open \nand fair process that has been promised, and that all of us, together, can do what we were sent to do: listen to each \nother, trust each other, work together, and find a path through compromise that can solve these two most important \nand pressing issues in the field of immigration. Thank you. I yield the floor. (The Acting President pro tempore \nassumed the Chair.) Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Without objection, it is so ordered. Parkland, Florida, School \nShooting Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, every day in America we face the devastating reminder of the toll of gun \nviolence. Today, we are watching the horrific scenes at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL, \nwhere yet another school shooting has taken place. It is gut-wrenching. We know that so many families have just \nhad their worlds and lives changed forever by senseless gun violence. Ironically, this is the 10th anniversary of a \nsimilar shooting at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, IL. Our prayers go out to the victims, to the families, to the \nfirst responders, and, of course, to the Parkland community. Honoring Commander Paul Bauer Yesterday, Mr. \nPresident, in the city of Chicago, which I am honored to represent, we lost one of our finest, Commander Paul \nBauer of the Chicago Police Department. He was shot and killed by a gunman in the Chicago Loop. Commander \nBauer was a 31-year veteran of the CPD and the commander of the 18th police district in the Near North Side. He \nwas a pillar of that community. He was well-known in his district. He had been commended by the city council last \nyear for a charity holiday party he helped to host for underprivileged kids. He was a husband to his wife Erin and a \nfather to a 13-year-old daughter named Grace. Commander Bauer was at a training session yesterday in the Loop, \nbut he didn't hesitate to help out his fellow officers when they were pursuing a fleeing suspect. Commander Bauer \nwas shot several times by the suspect, and he died from his wounds. Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson \nsaid this was an extremely difficult day for the Chicago police family. Commander Bauer was a hero in life. He \nmade the ultimate sacrifice to help protect the city he served and the city he loved. His loss is a tragedy. Our \nprayers go out to the commander's friends, colleagues, his loved ones, and, of course, his family and daughter. \n10th Anniversary of Northern Illinois University Shooting As I mentioned, Mr. President, today marks the 10th \nanniversary of one of the most devastating shootings ever to occur on a college campus in America. On February \n14, 2008, a gunman with a history of mental instability walked into a lecture hall at Northern Illinois University in \nDeKalb and opened fire. His bullets killed five students and wounded 17 more. It was a horrific mass murder, and it \nshocked the entire Nation. The five young Illinoisans we lost that day all had bright futures ahead of them: Gayle \nDubowski, 20 years old, from Carol Stream, who worked as a camp counselor and was a talented singer in her \nchurch choir; Catalina Garcia, of Cicero, 20 years old, a smiling, outgoing young woman who planned to be a \nteacher; Julianna Gehant, of Mendota, 32 years old, who served our country in the U.S Army and Army Reserve \nand who went to NIU to study to be a teacher; Ryanne Mace, of Carpentersville, a 19-year-old, who was funny and \nfun to be with and who aspired to work as a counselor; and Daniel Parmenter, 20 years old, from Westchester, a \nrugby player, who lost his life because he shielded his girlfriend from the shooter. It is heartbreaking to think what \nthese five young people could have accomplished in the 10 years since that horrible day. We mourn their loss and, \nagain, our hearts go out to their families. We remember and honor the wounded who still bear the scars of that \nterrible day. We renew our thanks over and over to the law enforcement officers and first responders who headed \ntoward the sound of gunfire that day and who treated the victims as they were wounded. We commend the many \nmembers of the NIU community who stepped up in the days that followed, working to persevere through this \ntragedy, with heavy hearts but unbroken spirits and moving ``forward, together forward,'' in the words of that \nNorthern Illinois University Huskie fight song. It is devastating to think that in this great country, students and \neducators could be gunned down in our schools. But it happens so often that I am afraid a numbness is setting in. \nJust in the last few months, we have had fatal shootings of students at Aztec High School in Aztec, NM; Wake \nForest University in North Carolina; Marshall County High School in Benton, KY; and then, today, in Florida. Other \ntragedies have been narrowly averted because of well-trained staff. At Mattoon High School in Illinois, a heroic \nteacher named Angela McQueen stopped a student gunman from causing a massacre there last September. The \nthreat of shootings in our schools is ever present. According to a tally kept by the group Everytown, there have \nbeen at least 18 incidents so far this year where a gun has been fired on a school or college campus. Schools and \ncolleges are doing the best they can to prepare and protect their students. I salute the educators and administrators \nwho are working hard, but is Congress doing all that it can to keep our Nation's students safe from gun violence? \n\n\n\nNot even close. Of course, there is no single reform that could stop every shooting in America, but we know there \nare big gaps in our laws that make it easy for criminals, abusers, and mentally unstable people to get their hands on \nguns that hurt innocent people. Congress has done nothing-- nothing--in recent years to close those gaps and \nmake America safer. Congress hasn't even closed the gun show loophole that the 1999 Columbine, CO, killers \nused to buy their weapons, and we did nothing in response to the murder of 20 first graders and 6 educators at \nSandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. In fact, the only vote taken by the Senate on gun laws in this \ncurrent [[Page S959]] Congress was to weaken gun law safety provisions on the books. That was a vote that \nSenate Republicans brought up last year that prevented the Social Security Administration from alerting the FBI's \ngun background check system about people with mental illness. It is likely that before this year is over, the \nRepublican majority will call up more bills to weaken gun safety laws. That is the wrong response to the epidemic of \ngun violence in America. I am not going to give up on trying to close the loopholes in our gun laws. I am going to \nkeep fighting for universal background checks, tougher straw purchasing laws, and better laws to prevent gun theft. \nI am not going to give up because of people like Patrick Korellis, who was shot in the head 10 years ago at the \ntragedy at Northern Illinois University. Luckily, Patrick survived, and since that day, he has been a leader in Illinois, \nfighting for commonsense gun reform. I have come to know and admire him for his efforts. No one should have to \ngo through what Patrick went through and so many others went through on that day in DeKalb, IL, 10 years ago. \nWe owe it to Patrick, to the other NIU victims and families and community members, and to the hundreds of \nthousands more across America who have been killed and wounded by guns this past decade to keep trying to \nreduce the toll of gun violence. Maybe we can't stop every shooting, but if we do our best to keep guns out of \ndangerous hands, we will save lives. I intend to keep doing my best to achieve that goal. I yield the floor. I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative \nclerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 1958, as \nModified Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I modify my amendment No. 1958 with the text at the desk. The \nPRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment, as modified, is as follows: In lieu of the matter \nproposed to be stricken, insert the following: SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \n``Immigration Security and Opportunity Act''. SEC. 2.
