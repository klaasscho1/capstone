{"title": "Florida lawmakers against Cuba pact", "body": "\nFlorida Republican Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balart have  denounced talk of a possible \nimmigration pact between Cuba and the United  States, and called for a multilateral trade embargo instead.\nWSHCUBA\n\nIn recent months, Cuban leader Fidel Castro has legalized foreign currency  and also said he would allow Cuban \nexiles to visit Cuba in greater numbers.\n\nThe steps have fueled talk of an immigration pact, but Ros-Lehtinen and  Diaz-Balart complain that normalized \nrelations between the two countries would  come at the wrong time.\n\n\"We believe that any conversations which take place will clearly benefit  only the dictator and will not be in the \ninterest of freedom-loving Americans  or freedom-loving patriots anywhere in the world,\" Ros-Lehtinen said at a \n Wednesday news conference.\n\nThose opposed to the pact say if it is implemented, Cubans would lose their  political asylum status, thousands \nresiding in the U.S. would become  deportable and those entering through Guantanamo Naval Base, the sea or \nthird  countries would be returned to Cuba.\n"}
