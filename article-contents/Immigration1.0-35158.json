Spellman's refusal to stay his order, said Tuesday it would \nnot free the refugees until its appeal was decided.\n\nThe Government also asked Judge Spellman to issue a separate ruling that would allow the Immigration and \nNaturalizaion Service to detain refugees who came to Florida in the next 60 days. Government lawyers said today \nthat up to 40,000 Haitians were in the Bahamas, waiting to immigrate to the United States while Federal \n''immigration laws are in a mess.''\n\nJudge Spellman said he would rule on that motion within 10 days.\n"}
