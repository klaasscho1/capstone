{"title": "Trump administration detains highest number of immigrants in over 10 years; President claims harsh immigration policies would deter migrants from attempting to enter", "body": "\nNew federal data shows that the number of migrants arrested on the US-Mexico border in 2019 spiked to its highest \nlevels in over 10 years.\n\nFigures show that around 851,000 people were apprehended and taken into US custody between 1 October 2018 \nand the end of September, marking the highest rate of arrests since 2007, during the administration of president \nGeorge W Bush.\n\nThe new figures, first obtained by theWashington Examiner, come as Donald Trump has imposed strict \nimmigration policies, including strict cuts to the US refugee programme, and amped up levels of workplace raids \nfor undocumented immigrants living in the country already.\n\nIn defending those positions, Mr Trump has frequently claimed that immigrants commit crimes while in the US, and \nmake the country less safe. His administration has also claimed that harsh policies towards immigrants would \nserve to deter others from trying to enter the United States.\n\nAccording to the latest data, more than 450,000 of the people arriving at the US-Mexico border arrived with a family \nmember. That's up from just 80,000 in 2015.\n\nThe new figures do not indicate how many migrants were able to claim asylum once they arrived in the US.\n\nPast data shows that the new arrest numbers represent a spike from what had been seen during the administration \nof Barack Obama and even the first couple of years of the Trump presidency.\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events\n\nBut, with the Trump administration's 2018 \"zero tolerance\" policy, the rate of arrest spiked. Those policies led to \nthe separation of parents from children arriving at the border, resulting in so-called child migrant camps across the \ncountry.\n"}
