{"title": "Are Children of Illegal Immigrants Entitled to a Public Education?", "body": "\nA New York Times editorial, \"Alabama's Shame,\" argues that the Alabama immigration law is cruel and \ncounterproductive:\n\nSchool superintendents and principals across the state confirm that attendance of Hispanic children has dropped \nnoticeably since the word went out that school officials are now required to check the immigration status of newly \nenrolled students and their parents.\n\nThat rule is part of the law's sweeping attempt to curtail the rights and complicate the lives of people without papers, \nmaking them unable to enter contracts, find jobs, rent homes or access government services. In other words, to be \nisolated, unemployable, poor, defenseless and uneducated.\n\nThe education crackdown is particularly senseless and unconstitutional. In 1982, the Supreme Court found that all \nchildren living in the United States have the right to a public education, whatever their immigration status. The \njustices' reasoning was shaped not by compassion but practicality: it does the country no good to perpetuate an \nuneducated underclass.\n\nStudents: Tell us what you think about Alabama's immigration law, including the school registration provision. What \nare the arguments for and against the provision? Which do you most strongly agree and disagree with? Does the \nlaw unfairly keep children from attending school? Or does it ensure that illegal immigrants cannot take advantage \nof services meant for American citizens? \n\nStudents 13 and older are invited to comment below. Please use only your first name.
