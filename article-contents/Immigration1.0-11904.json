The Amendment also rezones \nthe majority of land to Urban Growth Zone Schedule 5 to facilitate the development of the land generally in \naccordance with the Precinct Structure Plan and makes a number of other consequential changes to support the \nimplementation of the Precinct Structure Plan. \n\nSubject land      The Amendment applies to approximately 630 hectares of land generally bound by Deep Creek \nand Ryan Road to the west, Mount Ararat Road to the east and the Princes Freeway to the south. The Proponent      \nThe Victorian Planning Authority Planning Authority      The Victorian Planning Authority Exhibition      15 January \nto 23 February 2018 Submissions      Number of Submissions: 75 Resolved: 19  Panel process       The Panel      \nMichael Ballock (Chair), Tanya Burdett, John Hartigan Directions Hearing      30 April 2018, Victorian Planning \n\n\nAuthority Panel Hearing      30 May 2018, Victorian Planning Authority 31 May to 1 June 2018, Cardinia Shire \noffices 25 June to 3 July 2018, Planning Panels Victoria. Site inspections      Unaccompanied, 25 May 2018 \nAppearances      Refer to Appendix B Citation      Cardinia PSA C234 [2018] PPV Date of this Report      10 \nSeptember 2018  Executive summary  (i) Summary  Cardinia Planning Scheme Amendment C234 seeks to \nincorporate the Pakenham East Precinct Structure Plan and Native Vegetation Precinct Plan into the Cardinia \nPlanning Scheme. In addition, the Amendment proposes to make a number of consequential changes to the \nplanning scheme including:      removing most of the existing zones and overlays affecting the land     applying the \nUrban Growth Zone to most of the area covered by the PSP     replacing the Floodway Overlay with the Land \nSubject to Inundation Overlay.  The area covered by the Pakenham East Precinct Structure Plan includes \napproximately 630 hectares of land located adjacent to the Urban Growth Zone in Melbourne\u2019s south-east.  The \nPakenham East forms the eastern extent of the South-East Growth Corridor, extending along the northern \nboundary of the Princes Freeway east of the main centre of Pakenham. Pakenham East is expected to provide for \nover 7,100 dwellings supporting between 20,000 and 22,200 residents.  The Precinct Structure Plan is a long-term \nplan for the future urban development of the land. It includes a Precinct Infrastructure Plan, which details what is to \nbe included within the Infrastructure Contributions Plan.  Following the exhibition of the Amendment and during the \nPanel Hearing process, the Victorian Planning Authority worked with submitters, landowners, government \nagencies and Cardinia Shire Council to resolve issues raised in submissions. This process resulted in the Victorian \nPlanning Authority proposing a number of changes to the exhibited documents which were detailed in the List of \nChanges \u2013 Precinct Structure Plan 4 July 2018 and List of Changes \u2013 Ordinance and NVPP 4 July 2018. However, \nsome issues remained unresolved.  The key unresolved issues related to:      the items included in the Precinct \nInfrastructure Plan which would be funded through the Infrastructure Contributions Plan     the Future Urban \nStructure Plan in the PSP and the alternative proposed by Parklea which had an interest in substantial land \nholdings in the area     the width of the drainage reserves along Deep Creek and Hancocks Gully     the predicted \ntraffic generated by the development of Pakenham East and the impacts on Ryan Road and the intersections with \nthe Princes Highway.  Other issues related to the application of the Heritage Overlay, the vegetation identified for \nretention by the Native Vegetation Precinct Plan, lot sizes in interface areas, the collector road network, the extent \nof road infrastructure allowable within the gas pipeline easements, a proposed access road through Hilltop Park, \nbushfire management and the acquisition of school sites.  The Panel concludes that the Precinct Infrastructure \nPlan as exhibited, with the correction of an omission, is appropriate and subject to the more detailed \nrecommendations in this report, no further changes are required.  The Panel is satisfied that the exhibited Future \nUrban Structure Plan is consistent with the role for Pakenham East envisaged in policy and with the Precinct \nStructure Planning Guidelines. The Panel does not accept that the alternative proposed by Parklea would deliver a \nbetter outcome.  The Panel considers that the matter of drainage reserve widths is one of detail that is best \nresolved at a later stage. However, the Precinct Structure Plan should provide the flexibility to enable consideration \nof alternative, detailed drainage proposals.  The Panel acknowledges that the development of the Pakenham East \nwill substantially increase traffic volumes on existing roads. While the experts failed to agree on the appropriate \ndesign of the intersections with the Princes Highway, the Panel considers that this is a matter of detail that will \nultimately be determined by VicRoads.  (ii) Recommendations  Based on the reasons set out in this Report, the \nPanel recommends that Cardinia Planning Scheme Amendment C234 be adopted as exhibited subject to the \nfollowing:  In relation to the Ryan Road drainage scheme the width of the waterway/drainage assets east of Deep \nCreek must be a minimum of 50 metres and a maximum of 100 metres from the eastern top bank of Deep Creek.  \nWhere a local access street is determined to be required to cross a waterway, including where shown on Plan 7, \nthe proponent must construct local access street culverts to the satisfaction of the responsible authority.  No more \nthan 2.0 metres in overall height for a staggered retaining wall to avoid unreasonable overshadowing of secluded \nprivate open space and habitable room windows.  1 Introduction  1.1 The Amendment  (i) Amendment description  \nCardinia Planning Scheme Amendment C234 (the Amendment) as exhibited proposes to incorporate the \nPakenham East Precinct Structure Plan (the PSP) and the Pakenham East Native Vegetation Precinct Plan \n(NVPP) into the Cardinia Planning Scheme. The Amendment also rezones the majority of land to Urban Growth \nZone Schedule 5 (UGZ5) to facilitate the development of the land generally in accordance with the PSP and makes \na number of other consequential changes to the Cardinia Planning Scheme to support the implementation of the \nPSP.  More specifically, the Amendment makes the following changes to the Cardinia Planning Scheme:      \nIntroduce Schedule 5 to Clause 37.07 (UGZ5) and rezone the majority of the land within the Pakenham East \nPrecinct Structure Plan area (Pakenham East) to UGZ5. This Schedule includes controls to facilitate land use and \n\n\n\ndevelopment generally in accordance with the PSP. [You have used precinct with capitals elsewhere]     Introduce \nSchedule 8 to Clause 37.01 Special Use Zone (SUZ8) and rezone land within the transmission line easement to \nSUZ8 generally in accordance with the PSP.     Rezone land within the Amendment area and within 50 - 100 \nmetres of the midline of Deep Creek to Rural Conservation Zone Schedule 2 (RCZ2).     Introduce Clause 32.07 \nResidential Growth Zone (RGZ). This will allow the use and development controls in the RGZ to be applied to \nPakenham East via the UGZ5.     Amend the Schedule to Clause 43.01 Heritage Overlay to insert HO275, HO276 \nand HO277 and apply heritage controls to the following heritage places identified in the East Pakenham Precinct \nPost Contact Heritage Assessment, October 2017:         - HO275 - \u2018Carinya\u2019, 32 Mount Ararat South Road, Nar Nar \nGoon         - HO276 - 140 Ryan Rd, Pakenham         - HO277 - Pyrus communis (Pear Tree), 40 Dore Road, \nPakenham     Introduce Schedule 2 to 43.03 Incorporated Plan Overlay (IPO2) and apply the IPO2 to land rezoned \nRCZ2 as part of this Amendment. The IPO2 requires that use and development within the RCZ2 is carried out \ngenerally in accordance with the PSP.     Delete the Environmental Significance Overlay Schedule 1 (ESO1) from \nland within the Amendment area.     Delete the Design and Development Overlay Schedule 1 (DDO1) from land \nwithin the Amendment area.     Delete the Vegetation Protection Overlay Schedule 1 (VPO1) from land within the \nAmendment area.     Amend the Schedule to Clause 52.16 to include reference to the Pakenham East NVPP.     \nAmend the Schedule to 61.03 to update the planning scheme maps.     Amend the Schedule to Clause 66.04 to \nrequire referrals for planning permit applications within the Pakenham East Local Town Centre (LTC) to the \nVictorian Planning Authority.     Amend the Schedule to Clause 66.06 to require notice to be given to the licensee \nfor certain uses within the gas pipeline measurement lengths within the Amendment area.     Amend the Schedule \nto Clause 81.01 to include three new Incorporated documents titled:         - Pakenham East Precinct Structure Plan, \nDecember 2017         - Pakenham East NVPP, December 2017         - Small Lot Housing Code, August 2014.   In \nresponse to submissions the Victorian Planning Authority (VPA) proposed changes to the exhibited documents. \nWhere appropriate, these changes are discussed in detail in this report.  (ii) The subject site  The Amendment \napplies to approximately 630 hectares of land generally bound by Deep Creek and Ryan Road to the west, Mount \nArarat Road to the east and the Princes Freeway to the south, as shown in Figure 1.  2018_9104.png  Figure 1    \nThe subject site (Pakenham East Precinct Structure Plan \u2013 Plan 3 - Future Urban Structure Plan)  1.2 Panel \nprocess  The Amendment was prepared by the VPA as Planning Authority and applies to Pakenham East. As \nexhibited it proposes to:      incorporate the PSP into the Cardinia Planning Scheme     rezone the majority of land \nto UGZ5     make a number of other consequential changes to the planning scheme to support the implementation \nof the PSP.  The Amendment was on public exhibition between 15 January and 23 February 2018, with 74 \nsubmissions received, most requesting changes to the Amendment. The VPA referred submissions raising \nunresolved issues to a Panel. As a result, a Panel to consider the Amendment was appointed under delegation \nfrom the Minister for Planning on 6 April 2018 and comprised Michael Ballock (Chair), Tanya Burdett and John \nHartigan.  A Directions Hearing was held on 30 April 2018. The Panel directed that conclaves of experts on \ndrainage matters and traffic and transport be held before the Hearing.  Following the Directions Hearing, the Panel \nundertook an inspection of the subject site and its surrounds.  The Panel met in the offices of the VPA, Cardinia \nShire Council and Planning Panels Victoria from 30 May to 1 June and 25 June to 3 July 2018 to hear submissions \nabout the Amendment. Those in attendance at the Hearings are listed in Appendix B.  On 4 June 2018 the Panel \nissued the following additional directions:      The Victorian Planning Authority provide a copy of the Marshall Day \nAcoustics report dealing with Noise attenuation measures to be undertaken along Princes Freeway. This report \nmust be circulated to all parties to the Hearing (as per the attached circulation list) no later than close of business \non 2.00pm on Tuesday 12 June 2018     The Victorian Planning Authority should consult with VicRoads to establish \nagreed trip generation assumptions including:         standard density lots trip generation rates         medium density \nlots trip generation rates         the percentage of trips in the AM and PM peaks         the percentage reduction for \ninternal trips.  This information must be circulated to all parties to the Hearing (as per the attached circulation list) no \nlater than close of business on 2.00pm on Monday 18 June 2018      LendLease Communities may call an expert on \ntransport and traffic as part of its submission to the Hearing. The expert\u2019s report must be must be circulated to all \nparties to the Hearing (as per the attached circulation list) no later than close of business on 2.00pm on Tuesday 12 \nJune 2018  On 5 July 2018 the Panel issued the following further directions:  At the conclusion of the Hearing the \nVPA submitted a final list of changes proposed to the PSP. Parklea sought leave to respond to these changes on \nthe basis that matters it thought resolved had changed.  The Panel directed that Parklea could respond to those \nmatters raised in the VPA list of PSP changes which it thought were resolved. The Panel directed that this \nopportunity should be given to all parties.  The only matters to be addresses are those changes in the attached \n\n\n\nVPA list of changes to the PSP and only those matters believed to be resolved by the parties. This is not an \nopportunity to make further submissions but to respond to changes in the attached list.  Responses should be \ndirected to PPV and the VPA and must be received by 4:00pm Monday 9 July 2018.  The VPA will be given the \nopportunity to reply to the responses received by the Panel by 4:00pm Wednesday 11 July 2018  (i) Revisions to \nthe Amendment  The VPA proposed various changes to the Amendment in response to submissions and evidence. \nThe VPA documented its final changes in the List of Changes \u2013 Precinct Structure Plan 4 July 2018 (Document \n137), the List of Changes \u2013 Ordnance and NVPP 4 July 2018 (Document 136) and Summary of Submissions 4 July \n2018 (Document 138). These documents were circulated to all parties after the Hearing.  For the purposes of this \nreport, the Panel refers to the exhibited version of the Amendment as the \u2018exhibited Amendment\u2019 and the VPA\u2019s \nfinal changes to the Amendment contained in the List of Changes \u2013 Precinct Structure Plan 4 July 2018 as the \n\u2018Final List of PSP Changes\u2019 and the List of Changes \u2013 Ordnance and NVPP 4 July 2018 as the \u2018Final Ordinance \nand NVPP\u2019.  The Panel has used the 4 July 2018 version or the final Amendment as its starting point for \nconsidering unresolved submissions. These submissions are discussed in sections 3 and 4 of this report.  (ii) \nStatements of agreed opinions and facts  As part of the Panel process, the Panel directed that two expert \nconclaves be held in relation to:  \u2022 Traffic engineering (report dated 29 May 2018, Document 11)  \u2022 Drainage (report \ndated 24 May 2018, Document 14)  The outcomes of theses conclaves are discussed in the sections dealing with \ntraffic and drainage issues.  1.3 Background to the proposal  The Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) designates the \nlong\u00e2\u20ac term limits of urban development and where non\u00e2\u20ac urban values and land uses should prevail in \nMetropolitan Melbourne, as outlined by Plan Melbourne 2017-2050. The UGB first came into effect in 2002 in \nconjunction with the release of Melbourne 2030. The metropolitan strategy established a long-term plan for land \nwithin the UGB, including the intention to review the boundary at an appropriate time in the future.  In May 2011, \nthe Minister for Planning announced a new process to help address the shortage of metropolitan land supply, \nknown as the Growth Areas Logical Inclusions Review process. This identified land for investigation that had the \npotential to be included within the UGB which included land within Pakenham East.  On 13 September 2012, \nAmendment C190 was gazetted which expanded the UGB, rezoning land in the Cardinia, Casey, Hume, Melton, \nMitchell, Whittlesea and Wyndham Planning Schemes. Amendment C190 sought to implement the high-level \ngovernment policy to facilitate Melbourne\u2019s growth for the following 20 years, particularly through having 20 to 25 \nyears\u2019 worth of land supply in growth areas for Melbourne. Plan Melbourne 2017-2050 and the Plan Melbourne \nImplementation Plan outlines a target of 1.6 million new homes and 1.5 million new jobs over the next 35 years, \nand sets a strategy for supporting jobs, housing and transport, while building on Melbourne's legacy of \ndistinctiveness, livability and sustainability. Melbourne\u2019s Southern Region is anticipated to deliver 105,000 jobs by \n2031 and 125,000 new homes in Greenfields areas up to 2051.  Figure 2: Plan of the Southeast Growth Corridor \nand Pakenham East Precinct  As the Pakenham East township/Precinct? (Figure 2) was included in the UGB after \n2010, it does not benefit from the Melbourne Strategic Assessment that evaluated the impacts of the Victorian \nGovernment\u2019s urban development program for Melbourne on matters of national environmental significance \n(protected under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 - EPBC Act). \nClause 52.16 of the Cardinia Planning Scheme therefore required the development of the NVPP. The NVPP has \nbeen prepared concurrently with the PSP. It identifies:      native vegetation to be protected and the native \nvegetation that can be removed, destroyed or lopped without a planning permit     the offsets that must be provided \nby landowners wishing to commence works prior to removing the native vegetation which can be removed.  The \nNVPP will be incorporated into the Cardinia Planning Scheme under Clause 81.01 (Incorporated documents) and \nis a separate document to the PSP.  The PSP includes a Precinct Infrastructure Plan (PIP), which details what is to \nbe included within the Infrastructure Contributions Plan (ICP) and the essential infrastructure required to support \ndevelopment of Pakenham East. The ICP is a separate document which will be incorporated into the Cardinia \nPlanning Scheme and implemented through Schedule 1 to Clause 45.10 of the Cardinia Planning Scheme. The \nICP applies to the same land as the PSP. Table 8 - Precinct Infrastructure in the PSP identifies which infrastructure \nprojects are to be funded through the ICP. The Ministerial Direction on the Preparation and Content of Infrastructure \nContribution Plans (ICP Direction) establishes the allowable items to be funded through an ICP.  A new public land \ncontribution regime was introduced in Victoria in February 2018 with the passing of the Planning and Environment \nAmendment (Public Land Contributions) Act 2018 (PLC Act) by the Victorian Parliament. The PLC Act came into \neffect in July 2018 with a default commencement date of 1 September 2018 under section 2(2) of the PLC Act. This \nwill replace the existing provisions of Part 3AB of the Planning and Environment Act 1987 (the Act) with a regime \nthat is intended to equally spread the cost of securing public land across an ICP area. The VPA advised that the \n\n\n\nICP would be prepared in accordance with the new PLC Act.  The PSP is a long-term plan for future urban \ndevelopment of the site. It describes how the land is expected to be developed, and how and where services are \nplanned to support development. The Plan provides a high-level structure to guide subsequent detailed planning \nand development and thus will be subject to further refinement through this process.  The PSP provides a guide for \nthe delivery of an urban environment that will be a logical extension of the existing established residential areas \nadjacent to Pakenham East. The PSP and the Amendment to implement it enables the transition of \u2018urban \nidentified\u2019 land to urban land giving effect to necessary applied zone provisions to allow development to occur in \naccordance with the Plan.  The VPA informed the Panel that it would finalise an ICP, based on the items that are \ndetailed in the PIP. If a standard levy is applied the ICP and associated Infrastructure Contribution Overlay will be \nintroduced to the scheme by the Minister via a \u2018section 20A Amendment\u2019 which is exempt from notice requirements \nbut must involve consultation with the local authority.  1.4 Summary of issues raised in submissions  The key issues \nraised in the submissions of the various parties are briefly summarised as follows:      the items included in the PIP \nand the distribution of the levies proposed to be collected by the ICP     the final Future Urban Structure Plan and \nthe appropriateness of the alternative proposed by Parklea Developments Pty Ltd (Parklea)     the proposed width \nand use of the drainage reserves     traffic generation and the design of intersections as well as the designation of \nthe boulevard connector street and other road network matters.  Submissions also raised a number of specific \nAmendment issues related to:      zones and overlays     open space     Hilltop Park     the Native Vegetation \nPrecinct Plan     bushfire management     the timing of acquisition of school sites     Lot 37 access issues     slope \nand topography     gas pipeline easements     lot sizes in Interface Areas     Council\u2019s recommendations     impacts \non Nar Nar Goon.  1.5 Issues dealt with in this report  The Panel considered all written submissions made in \nresponse to the exhibition of the Amendment, as well as further submissions, evidence and other material \npresented to it during the Hearing, and observations from a site visit.  The Panel has reviewed a large volume of \nmaterial. The Panel has had to be selective in referring to the more relevant or determinative material in the report. \nAll submissions and materials have been considered by the Panel in reaching its conclusions, regardless of \nwhether they are specifically mentioned in the report.  1.6 Final view of the Amendment  As with other PSP \namendments, the VPA proposed comprehensive changes to the Amendment following its consideration of \nsubmissions and evidence, including changes that were refined and provided during, as well as, after the Hearing. \nThese changes are documented in the Final List of PSP Changes and Final List of Ordinance and NVPP Changes. \nBoth documents are dated 4 July 2018. A number of the changes, in response to submissions, contained in the \nFinal List of Ordinance and NVPP Changes have been incorporated into the Panel Preferred UGZ5 (Appendix D).  \nThe Panel has considered all the proposed changes to the exhibited Amendment in both lists. The Panel supports \nthe changes where proposed in these lists with the exception of those matters where the Panel makes specific \nrecommendations discussed in detail in this report.  1.7 Recommendation  The Panel makes the following \nrecommendations:      Adopt the changes to the exhibited documents proposed in the List of Changes \u2013 Precinct \nStructure Plan 4 July 2018 submitted as Document 137 and in the List of Changes \u2013 Ordinance and NVPP 4 July \n2018 submitted as Document 136 by the Victorian Planning Authority where matters are not specifically addressed \nby other recommendations of this Report.  2 Planning context  The VPA provided a response to the Strategic \nAssessment Guidelines as part of the Explanatory Report.  The Panel has reviewed Council\u2019s response and the \npolicy context of the Amendment and has made a brief appraisal of the relevant zone and overlay controls and \nother relevant planning strategies.  2.1 Policy framework  The Amendment was based on the planning scheme as \nit was at that time. The Panel notes that Amendment VC148 was gazetted on 31 July 2018 which has generated \nsubstantial change to the structure and content of policy in the scheme. The assessment by the Panel was \nundertaken using the planning scheme as it was before Amendment VC148.  (i) State Planning Policy Framework  \nThe VPA submitted that the Amendment is supported by the following clauses in the SPPF:      Clauses 11.01 \nActivity centres, 11.02 Urban growth, 11.03 Open space \u2013 The Amendment incorporates a PSP to direct how \nPakenham East should accommodate residential growth and the relevant infrastructure to support this growth.     \nClause 12.01 Biodiversity \u2013 The Amendment will incorporate the NVPP into the planning scheme, which identifies \nvegetation to be protected (retained) or removed in the PSP area.     Clause 13.03 Soil degradation, Clause 13.05 \nBushfire \u2013 The Amendment ensures land that has been identified as potentially contaminated will require further \ninvestigation if proposed to be developed for a sensitive use. The response to bushfire risk in Pakenham East will \nbe principally managed through the Building Regulations 2006 at the time of house construction, however, the \nAmendment requires site management during subdivision development to minimise the potential spread of any \nbushfire. This will be implemented via a requirement incorporated into the UGZ5.     Clause 15.01 Urban \n\n\n\nenvironment, Clause 15.02 Sustainable design, Clause 15.03 Heritage \u2013 The Amendment delivers a PSP that \nguides urban development so that it provides for a livable and diverse community that integrates and is well \nconnected to existing and establishing communities.     Clause 16.01 Integrated housing \u2013 New residents will have \naccess to existing services and employment opportunities within the community and in the established Pakenham \nTownship.     Clause 17.01 Commercial \u2013 The Amendment provides for a new Local Town Centre (LTC) and new \nlocal convenience centre (LCC) providing essential services and potential employment opportunities for residents \nwithin Pakenham East.     Clause 18.01 Land use and transport planning, 18.02 Movement networks \u2013 The \nprecinct\u2019s road network will integrate with the existing and planned arterial road network. The proposed road \nnetwork provides a robust structure for traffic and transport movement within and through Pakenham East, while \nbeing responsive to environmental and topographical constraints.     Clause 19.02 Community infrastructure, 19.03 \nDevelopment infrastructure \u2013 A comprehensive ICP will be implemented via a separate, subsequent amendment to \nthe Cardinia Planning Scheme.  (ii) Local Planning Policy Framework  The VPA submitted that the Amendment \nsupports the following local planning objectives:      Clause 21.03 Settlement and Housing: Provides for a diversity \nof housing types and densities, including increased housing density around activity centres.     Clause 21.04 \nEconomic Development: Provides local employment opportunities to meet the needs of the local population.     \nClause 21.05 Infrastructure: Provides for the coordinated provision of infrastructure and the collection of \ninfrastructure contributions.     Clause 21.06 Particular Uses and Development: Provides additional Requirements \nand Guidelines to ensure high quality urban design and a functional built environment.     Clause 22.04 Highway \nDevelopment: Provides for high standard of design associated with development along highways, and does not \nimpede the efficient and safe movement of traffic  The Panel accepts the Council\u2019s analysis and acknowledges that \nthe policy context supports the Amendment.  (iii) Other planning strategies or policies used in formulating the \nAmendment  Plan Melbourne  The Growth Corridor Plans (GCP), produced by the VPA, were released by the \nMinister for Planning in June 2012. The GCP are high-level integrated land use and transport plans that provide a \nstrategy for the development of Melbourne\u2019s growth corridors over the next 30 to 40 years.  These plans guide the \ndelivery of key housing, employment and transport infrastructure and open space in Melbourne\u2019s newest \nmetropolitan suburbs.  The GCP identifies:      the intended long-term pattern of land use and development     \ncommitted transport networks as well as network options for investigation     committed regional open space \nnetworks as well as investigation sites     opportunities for creating green corridors.  The GCP informs the \ndevelopment and review of local planning schemes and the preparation of future strategies, structure plans and \nother planning tools. They also provide a strategic basis for infrastructure and service planning as well as \nsequencing of land release.  The preparation of PSPs is the primary vehicle for the implementation of the GCP.  \nThe South-East Growth Corridor, which includes the municipalities of Casey and Cardinia, is expected to \naccommodate a population of 230,000 people with a capacity to provide 86,000 jobs. The Shire of Cardinia is \nexpected to accommodate up to 42,000 lots and 118,000 people, including the Pakenham East PSP. The Growth \nCorridor Plan does not designate any future land use for the Pakenham East precinct, though the Logical Inclusions \nAdvisory Committee report envisaged that Pakenham East would contribute to residential supply in Cardinia.  2.2 \nPlanning scheme provisions  (i) Zones  The UGZ applies to land that has been identified for future urban \ndevelopment within the UGB. The UGZ sits within the suite of zones within the Victorian Planning Provisions. It has \nbeen specifically designed to implement an incorporated PSP and ensure that future development accords with the \napproved PSP. As Pakenham East was a logical inclusion and is not currently zoned UGZ, this Amendment will \nrezone the land in Pakenham East to UGZ with applied zones to implement the PSP. Land use      Applied zone \nPrimary arterial road      Clause 36.04 \u2013 Road Zone Category 1 Small local enterprise precinct      Clause 34.02 \u2013 \nCommercial 2 Zone Local town centre Local convenience centre      Clause 34.01 \u2013 Commercial 1 Zone Residential \non a lot wholly within walkable residential catchment boundary (once subdivided)      Clause 32.07 \u2013 Residential \nGrowth Zone All other land      Clause 32.08 \u2013 General Residential Zone  Table 1: Table 1 of the Urban Growth \nZone - Applied zone provisions  The UGZ includes zone provisions that seek to provide certainty about the nature \nof future development, streamline the approval process and ensure that any land use and development within a \nprecinct does not prejudice its future growth.  2.3 Ministerial Directions and Practice Notes  (i) Ministerial Directions  \nCouncil submitted that the Amendment meets the relevant requirements of the following Ministerial Directions:  The \nForm and Content of Planning Schemes (s7(5))  The Amendment is consistent with the Ministerial Direction on the \nForm and Content of Planning Schemes under section 7(5) of the Act.  Direction No. 1 Potentially Contaminated \nLand  Ministerial Direction No. 1 does not strictly apply to most of the land affected by the Amendment as the \nAmendment is proposing to rezone land that has typically been used for various agricultural uses rather than \n\n\n\nindustrial uses.  A precautionary desktop environment site assessment has been carried out for all of the land, as to \nwhether or not it meets the definition of \u2018potentially contaminated land\u2019. The assessment identified three areas of \nhigh risk for contamination. The assessment has also identified a number of medium risk sites within Pakenham \nEast.  The Amendment, through the provisions of the UGZ5, will require further investigation, assessment and \nremediation of these sites should it be used and developed for a sensitive land use (e.g. residential, preschool and \nprimary school, child care).  Direction No. 9 - Metropolitan Strategy  Direction 9 has been considered in preparing \nthis Amendment and the Amendment complies with this direction. The Amendment will facilitate the development of \nland within the UGB of Metropolitan Melbourne consistent with the direction of the Metropolitan Planning Strategy.  \nDirection No. 11 - Strategic Assessment of amendments  This direction seeks to ensure a comprehensive strategic \nevaluation of a planning scheme amendment.  Direction No. 12 - Urban Growth Areas  Parts 4, 5, and 6 of \nMinisterial Direction 12 require that when preparing an amendment to introduce or change provisions in a schedule \nto the UGZ, a planning authority must evaluate:      the implementation of any relevant Growth Area Framework \nPlan     the application of the Precinct Structure Planning Guidelines     the intended outcomes of the precinct \nstructure plan     translation of the provisions once development anticipated by the precinct structure plan is \nsubstantially complete.      (ii) Planning Practice Notes  The Panel notes that the following Planning Practice Notes \nare relevant to the Amendment:      PPN30 Potentially Contaminated Land     PPN46: Strategic Assessment \nGuidelines     PPN47: Urban Growth Zone.  The planning authority did not specifically address these Planning \nPractice Notes. However, the Panel has satisfied itself that the Amendment is consistent with the relevant Planning \nPractice Notes.  2.4 Discussion  Amendment VC148 was introduced into the Victoria Planning Provisions and all \nplanning schemes on 31 July 2018. It replaces the State Planning Policy Framework with an integrated Planning \nPolicy Framework, changes clause numbers throughout the planning scheme and makes other changes from the \nSmart Planning program. The assessment for this Amendment was completed before Amendment VC148 was \nintroduced. Any planning scheme clause numbers referred to in this report reflect clauses which existed before \nAmendment VC148 was introduced.  The VPA should review the Amendment against the new planning provisions \nbefore progressing it further.  The basis for the Amendment is well established in the State and Local Planning \nPolicy Frameworks of the day as well as the more detailed strategies associated with Plan Melbourne and the \nrequirements of Ministerial Direction 12.  2.5 Conclusion  The Panel concludes that the Amendment is supported \nby, and implements, the relevant sections of the State and Local Planning Policy Framework and is consistent with \nthe relevant Ministerial Directions and Practice Notes. The Amendment is well founded and strategically justified. It \nshould proceed, subject to addressing the more specific issues raised in submissions as discussed in the following \nchapters.  2.6 Recommendation  The Panel makes the following recommendations:      Review the provisions and \nschedules of the Amendment to ensure they are consistent with the changes to the planning scheme introduced by \nAmendment VC148 prior to the finalisation of the Amendment.  3 Threshold issues  3.1 Traffic and transport  (i) The \nissues  The issues are:      the classification and alignment of the boulevard connector street     the design of the \nconnector street intersections with the Princes Highway (intersections A (IN-02), B (IN-03) and C (IN-04))     traffic \nimpacts on Ryan Road, the cross-section for Ryan Road and its possible truncation north of Canty Lane     the \ndesign of the Ryan Road/Princes Highway intersection (IN-01)     whether a roundabout is required at the Canty \nLane/Ryan Road intersection (IN-05)     the classification and cross-section for the extension of connector street B \nto the north of the Princes Highway     the cross-sections for Dore Road     whether part of connector street A can \nbe constructed within the gas pipeline easement     whether a new interchange to provide direct access to the \nPrinces Freeway from the PSP area is justified.  (ii) Evidence and submission  Classification of boulevard connector \nstreet  The exhibited PSP on Plan 7 \u2013 Road Network Plan shows a boulevard connector street looping though the \nPSP area south of the Princes Highway from intersections A and C with the Highway. Parklea submitted that the \nclassification of this street should be changed from boulevard connector to arterial road and thereby included in the \nICP. The street\u2019s classification is dealt with in this section and its inclusion or not in the ICP is discussed in section \n3.2 below.  Parklea submitted that there is no definition of \u2018connector street \u2013 boulevard\u2019 and the VPA had artificially \ndefined it and then relied upon its own definition to exclude the street from the ICP. Parklea submitted that the \nboulevard (or at least the section between intersections A and B, according to Mr Higgs' evidence) should be \nclassified as a Council arterial road because:      it will provide the main connection between the LTC and the LCC \nto the wider State declared road network within the meaning of a local arterial road under Council's Road \nManagement Plan     it will carry traffic volumes of more than 7,000 vehicles per day, which places it in the category \nof an arterial road for the purposes of Clause 56.06 of the Cardinia Planning Scheme (Table C1), Council's road \nclassification hierarchy under its Road Management Plan and Appendix B of the VPA Engineering Design and \n\n\n\nConstruction Manual (Table 24).  Parklea cited the evidence of Mr Higgs that the boulevard would need to function \nas an arterial road in that the network would fail if it was removed, which Mr Higgs argued was ... a valid test of \nwhat constitutes an arterial network element. Mr Higgs argued that an arterial road is not necessarily an arterial \nbecause it has four or more lanes or because of the volume of traffic it carries. He added that that there are many \n\u201carterial\u201d roads that have two lanes and have very low volumes of traffic using them, for example, Monbulk-Seville \nRoad. Mr Higgs referenced Cardinia Shire Council\u2019s standard cross-sections for Subdivisional Streets \u2013 Minimum \nNon-Urban Road Standards and suggested that Council recognised that a road as he described can be \u2018arterial\u2019.  \nMr Higgs\u2019 evidence, on behalf of Parklea, was that the boulevard connector street between intersections A and B \nwas arterial because:      its closure would result in a failure of the network     the alignment passes through a \nnumber of ownerships     if not completed emergency services would be severely impacted     projected high \nvolumes will require special design solutions     without the road significant areas of the PSP will be more than 1.5 \nkilometres from the Princes Highway.  Mr Higgs concluded that the  ... Boulevard Connector between intersections \nA and B on the Princes Highway should be classified as a Council arterial and thus included in the ICP funding.  \nThe VPA submitted that the boulevard connector street does not have the role of an arterial road within the PSP \nand the pattern of land ownership, its forecast traffic volumes nor the mile grid network factors warrant its \nreclassification to arterial road. The VPA argued that Mr Higgs placed undue weight on volumes compared with \nother documents unrelated to the growth areas and the absence of a traditional one mile grid road network caused \nby the Princes Freeway to the south. In closing submissions, the VPA noted that there is typically no direct access \nfrom abutting properties onto an arterial road and the reclassification of the street from boulevard connector to \narterial would have significant consequences for abutting properties including access and land take.  Council \nargued that submissions made on behalf of Parklea should not be accepted because they confused the test for \ncollector roads abutting fragmented land with tests for arterial roads and Parklea\u2019s arguments regarding what \nconstituted an arterial road relied heavily on extraneous documents.  Council noted that the Council document \nreferred to by Mr Higgs relates to non-urban arterial roads and trucks often travel on small roads that perform an \narterial function, but such roads are not relevant to the classification of a road within the PSP.  Alignment of \nboulevard connector street  In his statement of evidence, Mr Higgs raised concerns over the gradient of the \nboulevard connector street through the central part of the PSP. He stated that on his analysis, gradients on sections \nof the boulevard connector would exceed the desirable gradients for cyclists based on AustRoads Guidelines. He \nrecommended that the boulevard connector street be realigned to achieve grades that meet the desirable criteria in \nthe AustRoads Guidelines.  The VPA cited examples of gradients comparable to those that could occur over parts \nof the boulevard connector street and suggested that such gradients were an acceptable outcome that could be \nrefined through further detailed design of the boulevard.  The VPA submitted that:  ... the PSP is a high-level \ndocument and that the requirement under the UGZ is that development meets the test of general accordance with \nthe PSP. Ultimately it is open to a future subdivider to amend the location of the East\u2013West connector as it \ntraverses north-east direction to maximise the use of contours. Any relocation will be required to facilitate an \nappropriate interface with the exhibited secondary school, indoor recreation and active open space. Consideration \ncould be given to providing a more southerly route on the Future Urban structure however, it is at this time and \nstage of planning unnecessary. At the time land is subdivided and lots created for the secondary school site and \nthe active open space the balancing of these \u2018three masters\u2019, road alignment, active open space and school, would \ndictate the subdivision design.  Council submitted that the alignment and gradient of the boulevard connector would \nbe resolved as a matter of design detail.  In responding to the Final List of PSP Changes, ERM for the Blazevic \nfamily advised that they did not support the Parklea proposal. ERM was not opposed, however, to aligning the \nboulevard connector street through their property provided that the alignment depicted in the final PSP allows \nsufficient room for lot frontages to fit between the boulevard connector street and their property boundary with \nproperty 33 to the west.  Design of connector streets/Princes Highway intersections  At the request of the Panel, a \nconclave of traffic experts was held prior to the commencement of the Hearing. A conclave statement was \nsubmitted at the Hearing (Document 11) which indicted that agreement was not reached on the trip generation \nassumptions or consequently on the exact intersection layouts. It was agreed at the conclave that the best \nmechanism for resolving the intersection layouts would be for the VPA and Transport for Victoria to agree on the \nmodelling assumptions. This was done and subsequently the VPA\u2019s expert, Mr Richardson (Jacobs), and Council\u2019s \nexpert, Mr Abdou, (TrafficWorks) undertook independently further analysis and intersection layout design that \nresulted in two sets of intersection conceptual designs being presented to the Panel.  The VPA submitted that:  \nRyan Road is the only contentious one and the Panel needs to make a call based on safety vs vehicle flow. They \n\n\n\ncould adopt either layout for A and B, but the TrafficWorks Connector C is much too large and the Jacobs layout \nshould be preferred.  The VPA noted the comments from Mr Richardson that the difference in the intersection \nlayouts can be summarised as follows:  Ryan Road - Trafficworks have longer turning lanes on the Princes \nHighway (they could have tried to reduce them), Jacobs has additional capacity on the north approach. Trafficworks \ncan get away with only 50m left slip due to the saturation flow assumption and lower traffic volumes. It is very likely \nthat traffic will redistribute itself to Ryan Road thus requiring a larger footprint.  Connector A - both layouts are very \nsimilar.  Connector B - Jacobs has longer lanes on the south approach, this will be due to the saturation flow \ndifference  Connector C - Trafficworks footprint is much larger in general, probably due to not actively looking to \nreduce the footprint, only increasing capacity as stated in Ali's letter.  In its closing oral submissions, the VPA \nsuggested that the Panel should make a recommendation to the effect that the intersection layout designs including \nthe lane lengths should be resolved through discussions involving the VPA, VicRoads and Council.  Council \nsubmitted that:  The resolution of lane lengths between Mr Richardson and Mr Abdou should not be a cause for too \nmuch concern. Council is content for the Panel to note this issue in its reasons and recommend that it be resolved \nthrough detailed design, to the satisfaction of VicRoads. Council\u2019s position is consistent with the SMEC drawings. \nMr Higgs was comfortable with the modelling carried out by Mr Abdou. It seems that assumptions about when cars \nstart decelerating may be to partly to blame for the discrepancy. It is clearly desirable to ensure there is sufficient \nroom to brake, but at the same time, cars should use the lane to decelerate, rather than braking before they merge \ninto a turn lane.  The design of the Ryan Road/Princes Highway intersection (IN-01) is discussed further below.  \nImpacts on Ryan Road  Several submissions were made by residents of Ryan Road and the surrounding area \nraising concerns over the impacts on Ryan Road of the projected increase in traffic volumes due to development in \nthe PSP area.  Ryan Road is a two-lane local road providing access to the low density residential and farming \nproperties along its length and adjoining streets and to the Ryan Road Childcare Centre located on the corner of the \nPrinces Highway. It currently carries low volumes of traffic.  Traffic analyses forecast that when Pakenham East is \nfully developed by 2046, Ryan Road will carry between 6,600 and 7,300 vehicles per day south of the Princes \nHighway. Ryan Road will be upgraded ultimately to a two-lane connector street north of Canty Lane to cater for the \nprojected traffic volumes.  The VPA submitted that:  The VPA agrees that the PSP will herald a range of changes to \nthe experience of residents in Ryan Road. Perhaps most demonstrably while currently Ryan Road represents the \nend of development after which farming uses exist, a new urban fabric will be created by the PSP. It is part and \nparcel of creating this new PSP area that traffic volumes will increase on Ryan Road to existing residents. Because \nof the nature of development on the west side of Ryan Road these changes will be manageable from a traffic \nperspective. The development to the west is not of a regular urban form and therefore there are setbacks and a less \ndirect interface with the road.  When evaluating the amenity impacts upon those residence in Ryan Road, it is also \nimportant to recognise the improved amenity those residents will enjoy which offsets some of the more negative \nimpacts. These residents will have a sizeable Local Convenience Centre with a supermarket situated only a few \nhundred metres from Ryan Road. There will be new schools and other community facilities available all of which are \nimprovements to amenity. In all the VPA considers the amenity impacts to be acceptable in the context where the \nPSP area was introduced into the UGB via a logical inclusion.  Ryan Road/Princes Highway intersection layout (IN-\n01)  The Panel was presented with two alternative schematic layouts for Ryan Road with its intersection with the \nPrinces Highway. Based on the agreed trip generation rates and traffic analyses, these layouts were modified to \nthe layouts shown in the exhibited PSP.  The layout prepared by Mr Richardson has double left turn lanes from \nRyan Road south onto the Princes Highway. This is the layout preferred by the VPA.  The alternative design \nprepared by Mr Abdou incorporates a left hand slip lane instead of the double left turn lanes. The Abdou design is \npreferred by Council and supported by Mr Higgs. Council tabled an aerial photograph with the Abdou intersection \nlayout superimposed (Document 44).  The VPA submitted in closing that:  There has been much debate concerning \nthe intersection at Ryan Road with the Princes Highway. The VPA does not intend to recount this evidence for the \nPanel but observes that its position regarding the alternative designs remains unchanged. It regards a left slip lane \nadjacent to the childcare centre and on the active transport route is a poorer design outcome in terms of safety. \nAccordingly it does not support the left slip lane design.  Mr Richardson concluded that double left turn lanes are \npreferred over a left hand slip lane to minimise disruption to the Ryan Road Childcare and Swim School and for \npedestrian and bicycle safety.  Council submitted that:  Mr Abdou will give evidence that it is possible to provide for \na slip lane within the existing road reserve of Ryan Road without unacceptable impacts on the child care centre.  Mr \nRichardson admitted that he had not considered the amount of space available in the road reserve in any detail.  \nWhereas Mr Abdou considers the slip lane to be safe and efficient, Mr Richardson has concerns about its safety. Mr \n\n\n\nAbdou\u2019s view is that the safety issue for pedestrians and cyclists is manageable.  TfV, Mr Richardson and Mr Abdou \nall agree that a slip lane is more efficient than double left hand turns without a slip lane.  In closing, Council \nsubmitted that the Panel should support the Abdou design in accordance with his evidence because the layout with \na left hand slip lane:      achieves a superior average delay (20 seconds compared with 80 seconds)     it can be \nachieved within the existing reservations     any land take can be resolved through the ICP process     it is \nsupported by Transport for Victoria and Mr Higgs.  Evidence was also presented to the Panel on the apportionment \nin the ICP between the Pakenham East PSP and the land to the north of the intersection to meet its construction \ncosts. The issue of apportionment is discussed in section 0 below.  Ryan Road cross-section  The VPA circulated \nan alternative typical cross-section for Ryan Road (Document 54) to the one in Appendix C of the exhibited PSP. \nThe VPA stated its intention to adopt the alternative cross-section for the entire length of Ryan Road.  In his \nsupplementary report (Document 81), Mr Higgs stated:  Apart for there being no parking provided this section will \nbe adequate for the areas where on-road cycling lanes are warranted, say AADT above about 3,000, and it will be a \nbus route. The bus route is only nominated north of Canty Lane. Between Canty Lane and the east\u2013west Access \nStreet nominated in the PSP the traffic volume will be above about 3,000 vpd and separate cycling facilities of \nsome sort will be warranted but 2 x 3.5metre wide traffic lanes are not warranted. Parking will be needed regularly \non the eastern side and perhaps minimally to serve the western side of the street. With the wide verge available on \nthe western side a bike path as originally proposed is a better solution than the one now offered.  Where AADT will \nbe less than 3,000 a 7.3 metre carriageway will be adequate to accommodate both traffic and car parking demands. \nFootpath and cycling facilities will need to be in addition.  Mr Higgs included with his statement cross-sections for \nRyan Road north and south of Canty Lane. Parklea submitted that the Higgs cross-sections should be adopted.  \nThe VPA submitted that:  Ryan Road serves an important function in the proposed road network for the PSP. It is \nnecessary for a bike path to operate along the full length of Ryan Road, especially to provide bicycle and pedestrian \npaths to connect to the shared use path to Pakenham Train Station.  The VPA indicated that it proposed to update \nthe cross-sections for the north and south parts of Ryan Road as detailed in the Final List of PSP Changes. This \ndocument states:  Include additional cross-section for Ryan Rd North and South of Canty Lane. The difference \nbetween the north and south, is that north of Canty Lane 3.5m lanes are required, where south of Canty Lane 3m \nlanes are required. The Road reserve will (be) maintain(ed) as 24m for the length. Both cross-sections will maintain \ncar parking on the eastern side.  Truncation of Ryan Road  Several submitters from the Ryan Road area requested \nthat Ryan Road be truncated north of Canty Lane to minimise the increase in traffic on Ryan Road and to protect \nthe amenity of the existing residents. Mr Sartori submitted that if Ryan Road was not truncated, it should be \nconstructed as a boulevard connector street.  In his expert witness statement, Mr Richardson provided an analysis \nof the impacts should Ryan Road be truncated north of Canty Lane. He stated that with truncation, most traffic to \nand from south of Canty Lane would be displaced onto connector street A to access the Princes Highway, \nsignificantly increasing traffic volumes on connector A from 10,000 to 16,000 vehicles per day. This would cause \nfailure of the connector A/Princes Highway intersection and the function of connector A would need to be upgraded \nto an arterial level. He noted that existing residents south of Canty Lane would be significantly disadvantaged by the \nreduction in connectivity and would be required to travel further to access the Prince Highway.  Council submitted \nthat it relies on the evidence of Mr Abdou and others which does not support the truncation of Ryan Road because \nit will put too much pressure on other intersections, resulting in premature failure and capacity problems.  \nRoundabout at Canty Lane/Ryan Road intersection (IN-05)  The VPA submitted that a roundabout was a preferable \nsafety outcome and:  The VPA position is that a roundabout can be fully contained within the PSP as it provides \nbetter transport efficiency and pedestrian safety. The VPA\u2019s internal engineering advice is that a roundabout can be \naccommodated within the PSP and broadly within the existing road network.  Council submitted that:  A roundabout \nwill be funded through the ICP. There is no future chance to plan for a roundabout after houses are built. It is now \nor never. In the event that the land to the west is developed, a roundabout will be a more resilient option into the \nfuture.  Mr Higgs stated in his written evidence that there was no need for a roundabout at the Ryan Road/Canty \nLane intersection. In his opinion, a simple priority T-intersection would provide adequately for the likely traffic \nmovements.  Parklea submitted that it relied upon the opinion of Mr Higgs and noted that a roundabout would need \nto be located entirely within the PSP area and the road reserve as all adjacent land is in multiple ownership.  \nClassification and cross-section for Connector B extension north of Princes Highway  Lendlease Communities \n(Lendlease) noted that there was general agreement among the experts that the extension of connector street B \nnorth of the Princes Highway would operate with volumes well above its exhibited classification (of local access \nstreet level 2) and should be reclassified. Lendlease submitted that the experts also agreed that a connector street \n\n\n\ntrafficable width of 3.5 metres could be accommodated within the existing 20 metres road reserve.  Lendlease \nnoted that a shared path was normally a standard requirement within a connector street cross-section. It submitted, \nhowever, that with a shared path less than 100 metres to the west along the waterway corridor (WI-01), a shared \npath along connector street B (north) should not be required. Lendlease added that the other traffic experts agreed \nwith Mr Walsh that the shared path was not needed but in the spirit of cooperation, it had sought to provide a \nshared path along connector street B (north) which would increase the road reserve from 20 metres to 20.7 metres \n(Document 102). Lendlease noted that Council\u2019s traffic engineer was \u201camendable\u201d to the cross-section but the VPA \nwas not satisfied because it did not provide for safety reasons the usually required 4.5 metre distance between the \nproperty line and a shared path. Lendlease noted that the PSP Guidelines do not require a 4.5 metre buffer. It \nstated that the removal of parking from one side of the road (as shown on the reconfigured VPA cross-section to \nincorporate on-road cycle paths within a 21 metre reserve) was not Lendlease\u2019s preferred option.  Lendlease \nrequested that PSP Plan 7 \u2013 Road Network Plan be amended to illustrate a different cross-section to the PSP \nstandard cross-section for connector street B north of the Princes Highway with the amended cross-section for \nconnector street B having two 3.5 metre lanes within a 20 metre road reserve.  In closing, the VPA submitted that:  \nConnector B has a volume that exceeds the warrant for a connector road and it is by default therefore a connector \nroad. The PSP provides an adequate process for variation of cross-sections to the satisfaction of the Council within \nR70. It is apparent from the discussions to date that the Council will at least entertain an alternate cross-section in \nthis location. It is not necessary or appropriate to determine the issue today. This issue is one of a number of \nimplementation matters which landowners are seeking to have determined in the short term to in effect constrain \nthe discretion of the Council. This is not the purpose of the PSP or a PSP Panel hearing. It is appropriate where the \nPSP includes a mechanism that is acceptable and functional that these matters be deferred until a later time.  On \nthe specifics of the matter the proposed shared path on the alternative does not demonstrate adequate separation \nfrom the lot frontages. The VPA cannot support this reduction on grounds of safety.  Council submitted that:  In \nrelation to the section for Connector B, the Panel should not find that a bicycle path is not required. Mr Walsh did \nnot carry out any analysis of bike volumes along this road to justify any view that the shared path is not warranted.  \nThe location of Connector B, adjoining the signalised intersection, highlights that it is an appropriate location for off-\nroad or on-road bicycle lanes. He accepted that the difference between it and a local access street did not relate to \nthe carriage way widths. But Mr Walsh did not articulate a convincing reason why this road should be treated \ndifferently than the typical connector street section.  The catchment for Connector B is clearly skewed to the north \nand west but Mr Walsh seemed reluctant to admit what was obvious. It is, plainly, undesirable to direct bike riders \nfurther east to the other shared path, given that most of the catchment is further west and would be required to take \nan indirect route and then double back to the signals. An appropriate requirement or guideline can be drafted to \nregulate access to the eastern side of this road, to prevent direct access, to provide an appropriate setting for the \nbike/shared path.  Dore Road cross-section  Lendlease requested that the exhibited PSP Plan 7 \u2013 Road Network \nPlan be amended to illustrate the location of different road cross-sections and additional cross-sections be included \nin PSP Appendix C: Road Cross-sections for Dore Road north and Dore Road south.  Lendlease tabled a cross-\nsection for Dore Road north (of the proposed reserve) which it stated had been agreed with the VPA (Document \n100) and two cross-sections for Dore Road south (Documents 101 and 102). Mr Walsh in oral evidence indicated \nthat Document 101 had come from the VPA and that Lendlease could agree to it.  In the Final List of PSP \nChanges, the VPA states that the Panel version will be amended to include in PSP Appendix C: Road Cross-\nSections additional cross-sections for Dore Road north and south, as agreed with Lendlease and Council.  Council \nacknowledged Lendlease\u2019s desire for a smaller road reservation was being considered by the VPA and Council. It \nnoted that a cross-section of 20.7 metres had been supported between Lendlease, Council and the VPA.  \nConnector street A constructed within gas pipeline easement  Parklea requested that connector street A be \nconstructed in part within the Origin Energy north\u2013south gas pipeline easement. Mr Higgs in his supplementary \nstatement (Document 81) referred to cross-section 4 \u2013 Standard Boulevard in the exhibited PSP in Appendix C: \nRoad Cross-Sections. He noted that while the gas easement was not shown, a service road or park edge street \nparallel with the easement would be needed on the eastern side if the PSP proposal was adopted. He proposed an \nalternative arrangement which would include the gas pipe within the road median with appropriate clearances to the \npipe and adequate maintenance access. In his opinion, the form of the street adjacent to the gas easement should \nnot be locked down pending negotiations with the relevant agency (Origin Energy).  The VPA noted that on PSP \nPlan 8 \u2013 Public Transport and Path Network, the gas easement is utilised for a shared pathway in the southern \nportion of the PSP and that pathway will then sit alongside the boulevard connector A. It was unclear, however, how \n\n\n\nmuch of the road infrastructure could sit within the easement. The VPA provided an extract from the Donnybrook \u2013 \nWoodstock PSP which included a cross-section showing a bikeway and pedestrian path within the APA gas \npipeline easement (Document 129).  The VPA submitted that:  The VPA invites a recommendation that would see it \nwork with Origin Energy and Council to maximise the extent of road infrastructure that can be included within the \nnorth\u2013south gas easement. It is expected that this will include ancillary road items such as shared path, nature \nstrips (which may need to be modified to remove trees) but in any case this will assist with improving the efficiency \nof land use in the area.  Council submitted that:  While the idea of locating the gas easement within a road median \nfor Connector A is appealing, this has been investigated and found not to be feasible, due to the age of the \ninfrastructure within the easement.  Freeway interchange  Several submissions from residents to the west of Ryan \nRoad and community groups questioned why a new interchange with the Princes Freeway was not included in the \nPSP to provide a direct southern connection to the road network in the PSP area. Submitters expressed concern \nover congestion at the Healesville-Koo Wee Rup Road freeway interchange which they argued would worsen with \nthe population growth in the area. The traffic impact on Ryan Road from development within the PSP area was also \nraised as a justification for the construction of a southern connector from the PSP area to provide a direct link to the \nPrinces Freeway. In his supplementary submission (Document 141) on behalf of residents of the Ryan Road area, \nMr Sartori called on the Panel to recommend that a southern connector be constructed direct to the freeway.  In its \nPart A submission, the VPA responded that:  A traffic modelling study was undertaken by Cardinia Shire Council to \ninvestigate options for improving the connectivity of the arterial road network to the Princes Freeway.  ...  The \nresults of the study showed that the provision of the proposed interchange at Pakenham East would have a \nrelatively minor impact on the arterial road network in the Pakenham area. The interchange would only have a \nlocalised impact ... Without the proposed interchange, travel speeds would be on average 3km/hour lower on the \nPrinces Highway. The Princes Freeway, however, would operate at a higher level of service, that is better, with \nhigher speeds and lower traffic demands east of Cardinia Road.  From these results, it was determined that the cost \nof the proposed interchange outweighed the benefits relative to other priorities for the road network in the \nPakenham and Cardinia\u2019s Urban Growth Area.  Council noted that the traffic experts did not support the need for an \nadditional freeway interchange.  (iii) Discussion  Classification of boulevard connector street  The essence of the \nargument put by Mr Higgs for the reclassification of the boulevard connector street to arterial road was that the \nforecast traffic volumes were higher than the standard for a connector street (at 7,000 vehicles per day) and the \nroad would function as an arterial and should be so classified.  The Panel was not persuaded by these arguments. \nThe street will be constructed as a boulevard connector that will have the capacity to accommodate the predicted \ntraffic volumes. The determining factor in its capacity will be the design of its intersection with the Princes Highway \nnot the mid-block capacity provided by one traffic lane in each direction. The Panel notes also that nobody argued \nthat more than one mid-block lane was needed.  Mr Higgs made reference to Council\u2019s standard cross-sections for \nSubdivisional Streets \u2013 Minimum Non-Urban Road Standards and gave the Monbulk-Seville Road as an example of \na low volume arterial road. As noted by Council, this Council standard and the cited example relate to non-urban \nareas and the Panel does not consider them to be relevant to determining the classification of roads within the \ncontent of a PSP.  The Panel concurs with the submissions made by the VPA. It does not support the \nreclassification of the boulevard connector street to arterial road.  Alignment of boulevard connector street  PSPs \nare strategic documents and the road network plans in PSPs are by necessity subject to refinement as the process \nunfolds for the development of PSP areas. The alignment of the boulevard connector street shown in the exhibited \nPSP should therefore be considered as indicative and subject to further assessment at a more detailed design \nstage.  On the analysis presented by Mr Higgs, there may be a need for realignment of the boulevard connector to \ntake into account the topography of the area. The gradients of the bike paths may be an issue for the future but the \nPanel agrees with the VPA and Council that it was unnecessary at this stage to adjust the alignment of the \nconnector boulevard to that shown in the exhibited PSP.  The Panels considers that there is scope within the PSP \nprocess for the alignment of the boulevard connector to be revised prior to its construction and that the appropriate \ntime to do that is at the design stage when the requirements of the adjacent school and other infrastructure can be \nconsidered.  Design of connector streets/Princes Highway intersections  The evidence presented to the Panel was, \nin its view, inconclusive on the preferred intersection layout design of the connector streets A, B and C with the \nPrinces Highway. There were significant variations to the designs of intersections B and C due to different \nassumptions being used by the two traffic experts as inputs into their modelling.  The Panel is not in a position to \ndetermine which of the layouts should be adopted and, in any event, as noted by the VPA, it is not necessary for \nthe Panel to make a determination on this matter.  The appropriate road authority should determine the design \n\n\n\nlayout of these intersections after further analysis and consultation between the VPA, Council and Transport for \nVictoria.  Impacts on Ryan Road  The Panel understands the concerns expressed by residents of Ryan Road and \nother streets to the west. Ryan Road is, however, within the Urban Growth Area and development of Pakenham \nEast will occur over time. As a consequence, there will be a significant increase in traffic using Ryan Road and this \nwill inevitably have an impact on the amenity of existing residents.  The issue is whether any steps can be taken to \nameliorate the impact on Ryan Road residents. As discussed below, closure of Ryan Road is not an option. Ryan \nRoad will be constructed to a connector street standard including the provision of on street parking and bike lanes. \nThe detailed design of the road, including its verges and street planting, will present an opportunity to lessen traffic \nimpacts although the Panel accepts that this opportunity is limited and will not satisfy all the concerns of Ryan Road \nresidents.  The Panel notes that development of Pakenham East will provide Ryan Road residents with access to \nmore community facilities, a convenience centre and schools.  Ryan Road/Princes Highway intersection layout  The \nPanel was presented with alternative designs for the intersection of Ryan Road and the Princess Highway. Two of \nthe three traffic experts argued that it was necessary to incorporate a left hand slip lane from Ryan Road onto the \nHighway because of the volume of traffic expected to make this movement. The VPA\u2019s expert disagreed and \nargued that two left turn lanes controlled by traffic signals would be safer for pedestrians and cyclists and could \nprovide a satisfactory level of service at the intersection.  The Panel considers that the layout with two left turns \nlanes is preferable for safety reasons but it accepts that incorporating a slip lane may be necessary to deal with \nexpected left turn volumes and ensure an acceptable level of service for the intersection.  The Panel is not entirely \nsatisfied that a left slip lane can be constructed without affecting access to the Ryan Road Childcare Centre or \nrequiring land acquisition. It was not clear from the photograph with an overlay of the proposed intersection \npresented to the Panel that there would be no adverse impacts on the childcare centre.  Further analysis and \nintersection design should be done before a final decision is made on the intersection layout.  Ryan Road cross-\nsection  The exhibited cross-section and the alternative circulated by the VPA both have a road reserve of 24 \nmetres. The alternative version replaced the two-way off-road bike path on the western side with on-road bike lanes \non each side and reduced the traffic lanes from 3.5 metres to 3.0 metres.  The VPA subsequently advised that there \nshould be separate cross-sections for Ryan Road with the major difference being 3.5 metre lanes to the north of \nCanty Lane and 3.0 metre wide lanes to the south. The Panel notes that the road bike lanes and parking on the \neastern side will be included along the full length of Ryan Road.  Mr Higgs suggested that a lane width of 3.0 \nmetres would be sufficient to cater for expected traffic volumes over the entire length of Ryan Road. North of Canty \nLane, Ryan Road is designated as \u2018bus capable\u2019 and in the Panel\u2019s view, this justifies a wider lane of 3.5 metres \nwhich can be accommodated within the 24.0 metre road reserve.  The Panel endorses the revised cross-sections \nproposed by the VPA and their addition to a revised PSP.  Truncation of Ryan Road  Closure of Ryan Road to the \nnorth of Canty Lane would obviously limit traffic volumes on Ryan Road and preserve the amenity of residents \nalong the street. Its closure would, however, have significant implications for traffic conditions on the PSP road \nnetwork notably on the operation of connector A and its intersection with the Princes Highway.  Ryan Road will \ncarry significantly more traffic than it does now, but it will be an important link in the overall PSP road network. It \nshould remain open to traffic.  Roundabout at Canty Lane/Ryan Road intersection  The exhibited PSP on Plan 7 \u2013 \nRoad Network Plan shows a roundabout at the intersection of Ryan Road and Canty Lane. Both roads are \nclassified in the PSP as \u2018connector street\u2019. The roundabout is included in the PSP PIP and will therefore be funded \nin the ICP.  The classification for the two roads suggests that the volume of traffic through the intersection would \njustify a roundabout as the appropriate means to control traffic flows. The alternative would be a T-intersection. No \ntraffic analysis was presented to the Panel to demonstrate how a T-intersection would function.  It is normal \npractice in PSPs for a roundabout to be constructed at the intersection of two connector streets to facilitate turning \nmovements and improve safety. The Panel notes that the predominant traffic movements will be to and from Canty \nLane rather than straight through the intersection on Ryan Road.  The Panel notes the advice of the VPA that a \nroundabout could be constructed within the road reserve. The Panel considers that a roundabout is the appropriate \napproach to control traffic through the intersection and should be retained in the PIP for funding in the ICP.  \nClassification and Cross-section for Connector B extension north of Princes Highway  There was agreement by all \nparties that the extension of connector street B north of the Princes Highway should be reclassified as a \u2018connector \nstreet\u2019. The Panel has no difficulties with this change and supports it.  The issue is whether a cross-section for \nconnector street B north which is different to the standard connector street cross-section should be added to the \nPSP. The VPA says that a separate cross-section is not needed as the PSP provides a process for cross-sections \nto be varied subject to the satisfaction of the Council. The Panel agrees with the VPA on this point. It would be \n\n\n\nunworkable for separate cross-sections to be included for every section of road along which a landowner may wish \nto implement a modification to the standard cross-section.  The Panel also agrees with Council that the evidence \npresented did not justify the deletion of the bike path along this section of road. The Panel is not convinced that an \noff-road two-way bike path on connector street B (north) would be a significant duplication of the bike path to the \neast abutting waterway WI-01.  An alternate cross-section was submitted by Lendlease showing a shared path 0.5 \nmetres from the property line. The Panel has serious reservations about locating a shared path so close to the \nproperty line. There would be potential conflicts between pedestrians and cyclists using the shared path and \nvehicles entering and leaving abutting properties and, in the Panel\u2019s view, could compromise the safety of path \nusers and introduce an unacceptable safety risk.  There will be scope for a future developer of the land to put a \ncase to vary the cross-section including removing the bike path at the subdivision stage and the Panel considers \nthat to be the appropriate course.  Dore Road cross-section  The Panel understands that there is agreement on the \ncross-section for Dore Road adjacent to and north of Hilltop Park (LP-01) and this cross-section will be added to the \nPSP.  It less clear to the Panel which cross-section should be adopted for Dore Road south. There is a material \ndifference in the two cross-sections for the southern section presented at the Hearing. Document 101 shows two \non-road bike lanes and parking only on one side whereas Document 102 has parking on both sides and a shared \noff-road path 2.5 metres wide and 0.5 metres from the property line. As discussed above with respect to the cross-\nsection for connector street B (north), the Panel has significant concerns with a separation of only 0.5 metres from \nthe property line. It prefers for safety reasons the cross-section which includes on-road bike lanes.  The Panel \nsupports the inclusion of an agreed cross-section for Dore Road south in the PSP. The VPA, Council and \nLendlease should continue discussions on this matter.  Connector Street A constructed within gas pipeline \neasement  There was agreement among all the parties that as much as possible of connector street A should be \nconstructed within the gas pipeline easement. Council did suggest that the age of the pipeline infrastructure could \nlimit the use of the easement for road purposes.  Use of the easement would have benefits in terms of the efficient \nuse of land. The Panel strongly supports further discussions between the VPA and Origin Energy to determine how \nmuch of the street infrastructure could be constructed within the gas easement.  Freeway interchange  A previous \nstudy undertaken by Council concluded that the cost would outweigh the benefits of constructing an additional \ninterchange with the Princes Freeway to provide direct access into the Pakenham East PSP area. The study also \nconcluded that an additional interchange would have an adverse impact on the level of service on the freeway \nthrough increased travel times. No evidence was presented to the Panel to call into question the findings of the \nprevious study.  (iv) Conclusions  The Panel concludes:      the road looping through the PSP south of the Princes \nHighway classified in the exhibited PSP as a \u2018boulevard connector street\u2019 is not an arterial road and a change to its \nclassification to \u2018arterial road\u2019 is not warranted on the evidence presented to the Panel     the final alignment of the \nboulevard connector road should be determined at the detailed design stage when the requirements with respect to \nthe school, other PSP infrastructure and the road design including gradients can be resolved     the design of the \nintersections of connector streets A, B and C with the Princes Highway should be determined by the responsible \nroad authority after further analysis and consultation between the VPA, Council and Transport for Victoria     the \nforecast increase in traffic on Ryan Road is significant and will have an impact on the current amenity of residents \nof Ryan Road, but this is an inevitable consequence of Ryan Road becoming part of the road network critical to \ndevelopment within an Urban Growth Area     further analysis and intersection design work is needed to determine \nthe optimal layout of the Ryan Road/Princes Highway intersection (IN-01) including the impacts on the Ryan Road \nChildcare Centre regarding safe access and any land acquisition     the cross-sections for Ryan Road north and \nsouth of Canty Lane should be updated as proposed by the VPA in its Final List of PSP Changes to the PSP and \nincorporated in the revised PSP     Ryan Road is a critical part of the PSP road network and should not be \ntruncated north of Canty Lane     a roundabout at the Ryan Road/Canty Lane as shown in the exhibited PSP should \nbe retained and funded through the ICP     the extension of connector street B to the north of the Princes Highway \nshould be reclassified from \u2018local access street level 2\u2019 to \u2018connector street\u2019 and the standard PSP connector street \ncross-section which includes an off-road two-way bike path applied to that section of street subject to further \nconsideration at the subdivision design stage     it is desirable for part of connector street A to be constructed within \nthe gas pipeline easement to minimise the land needed for the street outside the easement     the VPA should have \ndiscussions with Origin Energy to maximise the amount of infrastructure that can be located in the gas easement     \nthe PSP should be updated to include cross-sections for Dore Road north and south as agreed by the VPA, \nCouncil and Lendlease     a new interchange with the Princes Freeway south of the Pakenham East PSP area is \nnot warranted  (v) Recommendations  The Panel makes the following recommendations:      Amend Plan 7 \u2013 Road \n\n\n\nNetwork Plan of the Pakenham East Precinct Structure Plan by changing the classification of the extension of \nconnector street B north of the Princes Highway from local access street level 2 to connector street.  3.2 \nInfrastructure Contributions Plan and Precinct Infrastructure Plan  (i) The issues  The issues are:      whether \nadditional projects are included in the list of ICP funded projects in Table 8 of the exhibited PSP     whether the \nPanel should make recommendations on the adequacy of the community and recreation levy and, if appropriate, \nthe means to address this issue.  (ii) Background  The VPA submitted the:  ... Pakenham East ICP sets out the \nrequirements for development proponents to contribute towards basic and essential infrastructure required to \nsupport development of the precinct. The ICP is a separate document incorporated into the Cardinia Planning \nScheme and implemented through Schedule 1 to Clause 45.10 of the Cardinia Planning Scheme. The ICP applies \nto the same land as the PSP. Table 8 \u2013 Precinct Infrastructure in the PSP, identifies which infrastructure projects \nare to be funded through the ICP. The Ministerial Direction on the Preparation and Content of Infrastructure \nContributions Plans establishes the allowable items to be funded through an ICP.  The Pakenham East ICP will be \nintroduced via a separate amendment and will introduce the associated Infrastructure Contributions Overlay into the \nCardinia Planning Scheme and associated Schedule 1, applying it to land within the Amendment area. The VPA \ninformed the Panel that it did not anticipate that the ICP would include a supplementary levy and on that basis a \nstandard ICP would be prepared and approved by the Minister for Planning under section 20A of the Act.  The VPA \nsubmitted that it had used a standard set of \u201cbenchmark costs\u201d that provided sufficient confidence that the \ninfrastructure to be funded through the ICP can be funded through a standard levy. The benchmark costs have \nbeen established by assessing the background data currently available to the VPA in order to provide baseline \ninfrastructure cost data and therefore to standardise the cost estimation of PSPs.  In addition, the VPA advised the \nPanel that the PLC Act introduced a new public land contribution regime in Victoria with the purpose \u201cto equally \nspread the cost of securing public land across an Infrastructure Contributions Plan area.\u201d The VPA advised the \nPanel that the ICP would be prepared in accordance with the changes introduced by the new PLC Act.  The VPA \nsubmitted that given the land required for infrastructure funded through the ICP will either be transferred, or an in-\nkind payment made as established in the PLC Act and that the community and recreation levy is capped there was \nno need for a supplementary levy.  A number of submissions made reference to the ICP Direction. A revised ICP \nDirection came into effect on 2 July 2018, the second last day of the Hearing. The Panel provided the VPA, Council \nand submitters with the opportunity to make a further submission on the impact of any changes in the ICP \nDirection.  (iii) Evidence and submissions  Funding of community infrastructure  Council submitted that all \ncommunity infrastructure should be fully funded by the ICP. Council added that the VPA agreed that there would be \na surplus in the transport funds collected under the ICP but a shortfall in the community infrastructure funds.  \nCouncil submitted that its key issues in relation to the ICP were:      funding of community and recreational \ninfrastructure identified in the Precinct Infrastructure Plan     the need for the Minister to exercise his discretion to \nallow surplus funds in the transport budget for the ICP to be used to fund the deficit in the community & recreation \nbudget, consistent with the discretion conferred by the Ministerial Direction for Infrastructure Contributions     \nensuring that additional projects advocated by other submitters are not allowed to undermine the ability of Council \nto fund the projects described in the PIP, as exhibited.  Council added that the budget for the community and \nrecreation projects identified in the PIP would contain a \u201csignificant deficit\u201d, while the transport component would \ncontain a significant surplus. The expected surplus in the transport category was not sufficient to fund the expected \nshortfall in the community and recreation budget.  Council argued that Clause 11 of Annexure 1 to the ICP Direction \nprovides the Minister for Planning with the ability to increase the amount of the total standard levy rate that may be \nused for community and recreation infrastructure. Council added that the VPA, as planning authority, by exhibiting \nthe Amendment must be taken to agree that the items in the allowable items in the PIP 'are to be provided' for in \nthe ICP and that \u2018to provide for\u2019 must be interpreted as \u2018funded by\u2019 the ICP.  Mr Shipp, on behalf of Council, gave \nevidence that a number of the proposed ICP items would be classified as supplementary items \u201cincluding three \nbridges (BR-01, BR-02, BR-03), one connector road (RD-01), one intersection (IN-05) and one set of pedestrian \nsignals across the Princes Highway (PS-01).\u201d  He stated that the PSP document clearly sets out the infrastructure \nlist and land budget of the future ICP. However, given supplementary items are not proposed to be funded, it was \nnecessary to establish whether the standard levy was sufficient to fund the infrastructure. If the levy was insufficient \nthen a supplementary levy should be considered. Mr Shipp observed that cost estimates were not included as part \nof the Amendment.  His evidence was that Council and the VPA has prepared indicative cost estimates and the:  ... \ncost estimates prepared by Council and the VPA indicate that the ICP is expected to have a funding shortfall in the \ncommunity and recreation category of between $20.5m and $39.2m and a funding surplus in the transport category \n\n\n\nof between $20.5m and $23.9m.  He added that the community and recreation infrastructure costs could further \nincrease if residential densities exceeded the PSP minimum requirement of a minimum average of 22 dwellings per \nhectare. His evidence was that the three conditions required for the Minister to increase the standard levy rate for \ncommunity and recreation infrastructure had been met and that:  ... it would be appropriate for the Minister to \nincrease the levy, subject to cost estimates for all community and recreation items being finalised and agreed.  Mr \nShipp considered it premature to include any supplementary transport allowable items until the cost estimate for all \ninfrastructure items had been prepared.  Finally, Mr Shipp noted:  ... that Table 8 does not include item CI-04 (land \nfor indoor recreation) which is shown in the Precinct Infrastructure Plan (Plan 11, page 64) - this appears to be an \nomission which should be corrected.  Council submitted that in this regard the Panel should recommend that:  the \nMinster confirm that:      he has or will exercise his discretion to approve the imposition of a full standard levy for the \npurposes of funding all infrastructure listed in the draft PIP exhibited with the PSP     he will not reduce the \n'standard levy' payable to account for a surplus in the transport project category budget     the planning authority \nresponsible for preparing the ICP will ensure that the ICP provides for delivery of all the PIP items in the PSP, as \nrequired by clause 12 of the Ministerial Direction     no changes be made to the draft PIP that would have the result \nthat a supplementary levy would be required, or that would prejudice the ability to fund PIP projects from the \nstandard levy.  The VPA submitted that community items within ICPs are not fully funded despite the Council\u2019s view \nthat all items of community and recreation infrastructure must be fully funded. The VPA argued that the evidence of \nMr Shipp acknowledged that there are occasions under the ICP system where community and recreation \ninfrastructure were not fully funded.  The VPA stated that the ICP system was based on:      An ability for nominated \ntransport items to be funded by a standard levy or supplementary levy if the transport costs exceed the amount \ncollected by the ICP transport construction levy     the inability to fund supplementary community items     An as of \nright ability to transfer excess community infrastructure funds to transport infrastructure but a limitation on the \ncontrary redirection such that it requires Ministerial consent.  The VPA\u2019s position was that new clause 11 in the ICP \nDirection provided that unused community levy funds can be utilised for transport items but the use of transport levy \nfunds for community items requires a separate Ministerial discretion. The VPA concluded:  It is not appropriate that \nthis Panel comment on a matter of Ministerial discretion that is not the subject of any current amendment let alone \nthe Amendment before it.  Council submitted that the revised ICP Direction did not diminish its argument and the \nMinister\u2019s discretion to redirect funds collected by the levies was unchanged.  Boulevard connector street  Parklea \ninformed the Panel that the boulevard connector street was not identified as an item to be funded under the ICP, \nbut Ryan Road north of Canty Lane, a connector street, was to be funded by the ICP. Parklea argued that the \nboulevard connector street, for the purpose of the ICP Direction, was a Council arterial road and should be included \nin the items funded by the ICP.  Whether the boulevard connector street should be reclassified to \u2018arterial\u2019 is \ndiscussed above in section 3.1 Traffic and Transport.  The VPA submitted that the exemptions provided in the ICP \nDirection do not extend to ordinary boulevard connectors and, if the Panel accepts that the boulevard connector \nstreet is not an arterial road, then it can only be included in the ICP where it abuts fragmented land which was not a \nfeature of the Parklea land. This view was supported by the evidence of Mr Shipp who stated:  I do not consider that \nthe connector boulevard traverses areas of fragmented ownership such that its delivery would be compromised if \nnot included in the ICP \u2013 it is therefore my view is that this item should not be included in the ICP.  ERM submitted \nthat the alignment of the boulevard connector street was not on land that was fragmented and the funding of the \nroad through the ICP was not justified. In addition, including the road in the ICP would:  place unnecessary \npressure on the transport component of the fund and would ultimately not benefit the broader community.  With \nrespect to the ICP Direction, Parklea submitted:  The Ministerial Direction does not change the need for a PSP to \nidentify works, services and facilities required for the proper development of land in a PSP area.  Parklea continued \nto prosecute the case that a boulevard connector street was properly classified as a \u2018Council arterial road\u2019 and \nconsequently a standard levy allow item as identified in Table 3 of Annexure 1 of the ICP Direction.  Parklea added:  \nRegardless of the Panel's recommendation in relation to whether the boulevard connector road may be funded by \na standard levy or Supplementary Levy, it is clear that the land which will be used for the boulevard connector road \nwill be part of the \"land component\" of Parklea's contribution pursuant to the ICP.  Parklea added that the ICP \nDirection amendments provided for the inclusion of \u2018minor culverts\u2019 as an allowable item in a supplementary levy. \nParklea noted:  The construction of the boulevard connector road requires the construction of two anticipated \n\"minor culverts\" \u2013 one over the Deep Creek overland flow area, and another over Hancocks Gully.  Parklea \nsubmitted that Table 8 of the PSP should reference these culverts as ICP items funded through the standard levy.  \nIn response the VPA submitted that the argument relied on by Parklea was similar to that put to the Panel during \n\n\n\nthe Hearing. The VPA responded that it relied on its previous submissions and that the:  ... boulevard connector is \nnot such a road (and really bears no relationship to the items listed in Table 5). If anything the new direction makes \nthis clear through the inclusion of what is now a generic category of \u2018arterial road\u2019.  With respect to the land required \nfor the boulevard connector street the VPA stated:  Clearly if the item is not an arterial road it is not appropriate to \ninclude the land. It is observed that Parklea continues to pursue a contribution of all of the land for the road \nnotwithstanding it clearly would ordinarily be required to provide the standard width of a connector road.  With \nrespect to the addition of culverts to Table 8 the VPA submitted these are new items not supported by any clear \nargument about what is or is not \u201ca relevant culvert or which makes the case for inclusion under the new criteria.\u201d  \nDeep Creek Bridge road  XWB Consulting, on behalf of Paul and Penny Carney, submitted that the bridge across \nDeep Creek was an ICP item. However, the road through the southern portion of the Deep Creek Reserve to the \nbridge was not included in the ICP. XWB Consulting argued that the road was not required for access to the land, \nthe Princes Highway provided a suitable alternative and there was not a reasonable nexus to the development of \nthe land. The submission stated that the road should be included in the ICP because the bridge is considered to be \nin fragmented ownership and the same should apply to the local access road to the extent that it is within the \ndrainage reserve associated with Deep Creek. Alternatively, the road should be removed from the PSP.  The VPA \nsubmitted it is yet to finalise ICP funded length of the bridge so that the land owner is \u201cnot unreasonably required to \nundertake bridge works across the drainage corridor to link to the ICP funded item.\u201d  Ryan Road/Princes Highway \nintersection IN-01  Ferati Holdings Pty Ltd (Ferati) submitted that it has an interest in the land on the north side of \nintersection IN-01 and west of Deep Creek. This land was not within the PSP area. Ferati submitted that it \nsupported the construction of a T-intersection designed to accommodate a future northern connection funded by the \nICP. The ICP proposed a 50 per cent funding of this intersection.  Ferati proposed that the northern leg of \nintersection IN-01 and a road connecting it to bridge BR-02 should be included in a supplementary levy and be fully \nfunded by the ICP.  Mr Gnanakone\u2019s evidence, on behalf of Ferati, estimated that 25 per cent of the traffic through \nintersection IN-01 would be generated by development on the north side of the Princes Highway. These estimates \nwere consistent with the assessment of TfV and VicRoads. His evidence was that a signalised intersection was an \nappropriate treatment of the intersection and that the contribution from the land to the north should not exceed 25 \nper cent.  The conclave of traffic experts considered this intersection and concluded:  It was agreed by all experts \nthat the current wording for funding requirements of IN-01 (that is 50 per cent ICP contribution) should be amended. \nSuggestions put forward included:      75 per cent funded by the ICP, 25 per cent funded by other parties outside \nthe ICP for this PSP     ICP funds the initial T-intersection (which would be designed to accommodate a future \naddition of a northern leg)     Jim Higgs agreed that 50 per cent seemed too high for the northern development and \nthat the specifics would need to be the subject of a deal to be made.  (iv) Discussion  Funding of community \ninfrastructure  The Panel acknowledges that it appears there will be a surplus in the transport infrastructure funds \ncollected under the ICP but a shortfall in the community and recreation infrastructure. In this respect, the Panel \naccepts the submission of the VPA that community and recreation items are not fully funded. The imposition of a \ncap on the community and recreation levy will mean that, in some circumstances, this infrastructure will not be fully \nfunded.  Nevertheless, the ICP Direction provides a mechanism that allows surplus funds in the transport levy to be \napplied to the community and recreation levy, subject to a separate Ministerial discretion.  This discretion is dealt \nwith in clause 12 of Annexure 1 in the ICP Direction which states:  The Minister may increase the amount specified \nin clause 10 in relation to a particular Infrastructure Contributions Plan if:  (a) the Minister is satisfied that the \ncommunity and recreation construction to be funded by the increased amount is essential to the orderly \ndevelopment of the land in the ICP area  (b) no supplementary levy is being imposed to fund transport construction  \n(c) the total standard levy rate (comprising the amounts allocated to community and recreation and transport \nconstruction) is not increased.  This clause enables the Minister to increase the levy rate for community and \nrecreation infrastructure provided he is satisfied that all three conditions are met. Mr Shipp\u2019s evidence was that all \nthree conditions had been met and Council invited the Panel to make recommendations that this discretion should \nbe used.  However, it is not the role of the Panel to provide recommendations to the Minister on whether or how he \nshould exercise his discretion with respect to changes to the levy rate for community and recreation. The role of the \nPanel is to consider and make recommendations on the Amendment. If there is a concern with the community and \nrecreation levy then it is up to Council and the planning authority to make the case to the Minister that there is an \nissue with the community and recreation levy that could be addressed by the discretion provided in clause 12.  \nBoulevard connector street  Consideration of the nature of the boulevard connector street is dealt with in section 1 \nabove and concludes that the road in not an arterial road. The Panel notes that the Parklea land ownership plan \n\n\n\nprovided as Document 79 shows that with the exception of three land holdings near the intersection with Ryan \nRoad, the route of the boulevard connector street is entirely within land fully or partly owned by Parklea. While there \nis no qualification of the term fragmented land, the ICP Direction in outlining the criteria for applying a \nsupplementary item provides the following:      the item, normally provided by a developer to develop the land for \nurban purposes, is on or adjoins land in fragmented ownership     the fragmented land ownership makes the \ndelivery of the item by the developer difficult.  Given the Parklea interest in the land around the road (see Figure 4), \nthe Panel supports the evidence of Mr Shipp that the boulevard connector street does not traverse land that is in \nfragmented ownership. On this basis the boulevard connector street is not an ICP supplementary item.  The Panel \nagrees with the submission of the VPA that if the road is not an arterial road then the land component is not an item \nincluded in the ICP. The Panel notes that Parklea have raised the matter of minor culverts which can be included \nas ICP items funded through the standard levy. Parklea\u2019s submission acknowledges that the land required to \nconstruct the culverts may be sufficient to classify then as \u2018major culverts\u2019 which are not able to be funded through \nthe standard levy.  In these circumstances it is apparent to the Panel that the final classification of these culverts \nwill be subject to more detailed design considerations than the Panel has before it. In these circumstances is \npremature for the Panel to recommend whether the culverts required are minor or major and whether they should \nbe included in the ICP. This is a matter that Parklea should address with the VPA before the final PIP is prepared.  \nDeep Creek bridge road  In the Panel\u2019s view the land leading to bridge BR-01 is held in one ownership and \nconsequently not fragmented. While the bridge itself is included in the ICP because of fragmented ownership the \nsame argument does not apply to the road leading to it. The ICP Direction in Table 5 allows the inclusion of local \nroads as a supplementary item if a number of conditions are met. The most relevant of these conditions are outlined \nabove and deal with fragmented land ownership. In the Panel\u2019s view there is no fragmentation of land ownership \nand insufficient justification to include this road in the ICP.  Ryan Road/Princes Highway intersection IN-01  The \nPanel notes the conclusion of the conclave of traffic experts that supported amendment of the wording of the \nfunding requirements of intersection IN-01. The Panel accepts the evidence of Mr Gnanakone that 75 per cent of \nthe traffic volume using this intersection can be attributed to the PSP. This assessment is also supported some of \nthe other members of the conclave. The Panel agrees with this conclusion. In the Panel\u2019s view, which was \nsupported by the evidence of Mr Gnanakone, the most efficient and cost-effective method of addressing this matter \nis to develop the intersection as a T-intersection fully funded by the ICP. This would then allow the northern leg of \nthis intersection to be developed when the land to the north is developed.  The Panel understands that BR-02 is a \npedestrian and cycling bridge and does not support the Ferati submission for a road connection from IN-01 to \nbridge BR-02.  The Panel agrees with Mr Shipp\u2019s observation that Table 8 does not include item CI-04 (land for \nindoor recreation) which is shown in the PIP and appears to be an omission which should be corrected. The Panel \nnotes that the VPA Final List of PSP Changes includes the addition of CI-04 to Table 8.  (v) Conclusions  The Panel \nconcludes:      a deficit in the community and recreation levy and how this may be addressed is not a matter for the \nPanel     there is insufficient justification to include the boulevard connector street in the PIP and Table 8 of the \nPSP     the VPA should consider the two culverts identified by Parklea before the finalisation of the ICP     there is \ninsufficient justification for including the Deep Creek bridge road in the PIP     Table 8 of the PSP should be \namended to include 75 per cent of the land and interim construction of intersection IN-01 as a T-intersection.  (vi) \nRecommendations  The Panel makes the following recommendations:      Amend item IN-01 in Table 8 of the \nPakenham East Precinct Structure Plan to change the description to purchase of land (Ultimate treatment) and \nconstruction of a primary arterial to connector road T-intersection (interim treatment). The figures updated in \ncolumn Ultimate land from 50 per cent to 100 per cent and in column Interim construction from 50 per cent to 100 \nper cent for the construction of a T-intersection.  3.3 The Future Urban Structure plan  (i) The issue  The issues are \nwhether:      the Parklea alternative Future Urban Structure Plan is preferable to the exhibited version     the \nchanges to the Future Urban Structure Plan recommended by the VPA are appropriate.  (ii) Background  The VPA \nprovided the following summary of the PSP  The Pakenham East PSP is a long-term plan for future urban \ndevelopment of the site. It describes how the land is expected to be developed, and how and where services are \nplanned to support development. The Plan provides a high-level structure to guide subsequent detailed planning \nand development and thus will be subject to further refinement through this process.  The PSP provides a guide for \nthe delivery of an urban environment that will be a logical extension of the existing established residential areas \nadjacent to the precinct. The PSP, and Amendment to implement the Plan, enables the transition of \u2018urban \nidentified\u2019 land to urban land giving effect to necessary applied zone provisions to allow development to occur in \naccordance with the Plan.  Prior to the commencement of the Hearing, Parklea submitted an alternative Future \n\n\n\nUrban Structure Plan (FUS). This plan is shown in Figure 3. Parklea invited the Panel to recommend amendment \nof the FUS to accord with this alternative.  The alternative FUS is essentially made up of the following elements:      \nSplitting the sports reserve SR-02     Relocating the government secondary school     Realigning the boulevard \nconnector street.  The alignment of the boulevard connector street is discussed in section 3.1 above.  \n2018_9106.png  Figure 3    Parklea alternative Future Urban Structure Plan  (iii) Evidence and submissions  \nParklea informed the Panel that it had been engaged as project manager for lots 29 to 35, 38, 39, 41, 46, 48 and \n49 (Figure 4). The company has varying degrees of full ownership, part ownership or no ownership interest in these \nlots.  Figure 4    Parklea land ownership (Document 79)  Parklea added that:  Each landowner decision as to the \ndevelopment of its land will be based on the personal circumstances, tax exposure and investment ability of each \nlandowner.  The alternative FUS proposed the relocation of the government secondary school to the east and \nsplitting open space SR-01 which, it was submitted, provided for the efficient siting of open space abutting the gas \ntransmission easement and a second area adjacent to an area of uncredited open space and drainage. It argued \nthat these alternative locations had flatter topography.  Parklea added that the:  ... alternative location enables the \nmore efficient, logical and cost-effective development of the residential areas within the southern half of the \nPrecinct, in circumstances where development in the short term is likely to commence in the west whereas the \nschool is likely to be required over the long-term.  The VPA submitted that the PSP provided sites for two primary \nschools and one secondary school in accordance with the Department of Education and Training (DET) standard \nprovision ratios. It added:  The locations are adjacent to the connector road network, neighbouring higher densities \nwithin the walkable catchment, and co-located with community facilities and open space. Constraints within the \nprecinct such as slope and gas pipeline measurement lengths have affected the location of the proposed sites.  \nRelocating the government secondary school  The VPA submitted that the exhibited location of the school is more \ncentral and provides better access for Pakenham East. Pakenham East will constitute 80 per cent of the student \ncatchment. The exhibited location of the school would be accessible via active and public transport and is \npositioned to encourage these modes over private vehicle access.  The VPA considered that the relocation of the \nschool would decrease the residential catchment of the LTC. Ultimately the preparation of precinct structure plans \nis a balancing exercise. There are more positive attributes to the exhibited location than the alternate location \npresented by Parklea particularly with regard to catchment.  DET submitted that if development proceeds as \nanticipated it will need 8.4 hectares of land to deliver a government secondary school within Pakenham East. DET \nidentified the following advantages of the proposed secondary school site stating that it:      is more central to the \nsurrounding local school catchment that would apply if a future government secondary school were delivered in this \nlocation (Note: approximately 80% of the catchment of this school would be within the Pakenham East PSP area)     \nsupports the principles of colocation with other community assets     has stronger active transport accessibility, due \nto its central location and connections with the active transport network     provides greater community facility \nsharing opportunities if the secondary school is collocated with the entire sporting reserve, rather than only 3.8 \nhectares (as would be the case in the proposed alternative Future Urban Structure).  Parklea submitted that the \nPSP FUS nominated land on lots 33 and 38 as a future government secondary school, adjacent to a large tract of \nopen space on lots 33 and 39. Parklea recommended relocating the secondary school to land on lot 35 and to split \nthe tract of open space in two which it identified as AOS 1 on lot 39 and AOS 2 on lot 37. Lot 37 also included the \nindoor recreation facility. Parklea did not have an interest in lot 37. In addition, the proposal shifted AOS 1 to the \nwest to abut the gas transmission easement.  Parklea added that there were a number of arguments that supported \nthe alternative proposal:      The exhibited school location is located on two lots in different ownership. Parklea \nmanages both lots, but there is no guarantee this arrangement will continue into the future or that the two owners \nwill develop at the same time. The alternative proposal is in single ownership.     The exhibited school site has a fall \nof 11 metres from north to south and the alternative location a fall of 5 metres from northeast to southwest. The \ngreater slope will result in greater construction costs and make access difficult by bicycle.     The key catchment \nrole of the proposed school should be to service both the population of Pakenham East as well as the Pakenham \nNorth-East small area and the alternative location is more accessible to these catchments.     The alternative \nlocation for the school is better served by public transport options, as it is in close proximity to the LTC and the \nPrinces Highway.     The alternative location enables the more efficient, logical and cost-effective development of \nthe residential areas within the southern half of Pakenham East.  Mr Panozzo\u2019s evidence, on behalf of Parklea, was \nthat the primary catchment area for this future Government Secondary College will be both Pakenham East and the \nPakenham North-East small area. In addition, the school would attract a significant number of enrolments from the \nrural and semi-rural communities to the east, north-east and south-east of the PSP area such as Nar Goon and \n\n\n\nGarfield. Mr Panozzo identified this as a key secondary catchment area for the proposed school. From this analysis \nhe concluded that Pakenham East would make up approximately 50 per cent of the school\u2019s entire catchment.  Mr \nPanozzo stated that the eastern rural communities of this catchment would be heavily reliant on both private motor \nvehicle and public transport options to travel to the school. His \u201cstrong belief\u201d was that the alternative location was \nsuperior because it is better served by public transport. He also considered that the alternative location, which is \ncloser to the Princes Highway, provided superior walking and cycling options.  Mr Atkinson\u2019s evidence was that the \nalternative location was better designed to respond to the existing topography and future grading requirements. His \nevidence mainly focused on landscape and planting, however, he added that the proposal would create a second \nopen space area adjacent to the alternative location of the school that would also link to the drainage reserve.  Mr \nLee\u2019s evidence was that his calculations confirmed the LCC would have difficulty achieving the scale of \ndevelopment proposed in the PSP which was 4,100 square metres. He added that the supermarket opportunity \nwould be reduced to a mid-sized store.  He concluded:  Small neighbourhood centres such as this are often difficult \nto develop successfully because of the preference \u2013 especially in outer urban communities \u2013 to direct a larger \nshare of weekly shopping to centres containing a full-line supermarket.  The relocation of the possible future \ngovernment secondary school and part of the designated AOS would enable more residential development to occur \nwithin the catchment likely to be served by the LCC.  My analysis of June 2017, confirmed in revised calculations \nconducted for the exhibited FUS, shows that the retail development potential would be close to the envisaged \n\u2018target\u2019 of 4,100 sqm if the school were relocated, therefore helping to establish a more successful shopping \nprecinct and provide amenity for early residents within the PSP.  The VPA submitted that the exhibited school \nlocation was superior because it provided better active transport options for the primary 80 per cent of students \ncoming from Pakenham East. The VPA informed the Panel that DET had advised that it expected the remaining 20 \nper cent of the catchment to come from the suburban areas west of Pakenham East which was closer to the \nexhibited secondary school location.  The VPA added that it was not appropriate to relocate to school to enable \nland owners to better stage the roll out of their land holding. In addition:  ... PSPs are planned for the ultimate build \nout, and if we planned all of Melbourne around the staging of specific land holdings than we would be creating \nsubstandard places to live for all Victorians well into the future.  Council submitted that the evidence provided to the \nPanel did not demonstrate that there is a \u201cfundamental flaw\u201d in the PSP. In Council\u2019s view the exhibited location of \nthe secondary school and active open space reserve achieved efficiencies in terms of delivery costs and mode shift \nto sustainable modes of transport.  The exhibited school location has a local access street along its eastern and \nsouthern boundary, which provides access to the second car park and more efficient access and egress. The \nalternative location as well as AOS 1 and AOS 2 had a higher risk of congestion because of their direct links to the \nboulevard connector street.  Council added that the topography of the site should not be a significant concern, \nespecially as the distance to the town centre is just over 1200 metres and the slope is a maximum of 10 metres of \nelevation. In Council\u2019s view it is not unreasonable to expect many children to navigate a 10m hill on one way to or \nfrom the secondary school or sports reserve for a distance of up to one kilometre.  ERM informed the Panel that the \nalternative location for the school would result in the proposed AOS 2 being largely located on the Blazevic land. In \naddition, the relocation of the school site did not achieve any strategic advantages and would result in a more \nisolated setting with increased travel distances for the majority of students.  At the conclusion of its submission \nParklea presented a revised alternative FUS (Document 92) which proposed a single open space area co-located \nwith the school and indoor sports facility in a similar location to the exhibited FUS but moved further west to abut \nthe boundary of the gas easement (Figure 5).  2018_9108.png  Figure 5    Revised Parklea alternative Future \nUrban Structure Plan  The VPA responded to this revised alternative FUS as follows:  The VPA observes that this \nlocation was largely considered during agency consultation in April 2017 when DET indicated it did not support the \nacquisition of the school site in a similar layout to that in the FUS3 also abutting the Princess freeway with apparent \nnoise implications and with access to only two frontage roads, rather than three which is inconsistent with the PSP \nGuidelines which support all three roads on the boundary of a school site.. The VPA's recent enquiries with DET on \nthe FUS3 indicate that these concerns remain on the FUS3. It is important that an appropriate school site is \nidentified in a position acceptable to DET. This will encourage rather than hinder land acquisition.  Splitting the \nsports reserve  Mr Panozzo\u2019s evidence was that the two open space areas proposed by the alternative FUS would \nnot adversely impact on the functioning of organised sport. He added:  I believe the proposed AOS 2 reserve is of \nsufficient size to accommodate two soccer playing fields and four outdoor netball courts. I would add, however, that \nAOS 2 will also be able to potentially accommodate another sport during the summer season. For example, if the \ntwo soccer playing fields where overlaid by an oval, then cricket could comfortably be played at the reserve during \n\n\n\nsummer.  Mr Panozzo concluded that providing three locations for active open space in Pakenham East included \nmore of the area in a one kilometre catchment.  Mr Atkinson, on behalf of Parklea, gave evidence that the minor \nrelocation of the proposed AOS 1 would \u201cbenefit from a slighter flatter zone as it moves out of the area with more \nslope.\u201d In addition, this area of open space would be better integrated with the gas easement. He stated that the \nlocation of AOS 2 adjacent to the school would meet the standard of adjoining schools and community facilities.  Mr \nAtkinson concluded:  Given the sensitive approach to recreational design and the strategic integration proposed, it \nis anticipated that there will be no negative impacts to the broader neighbourhood at these locations. Both areas of \nAOS provide flexibility for future uses.  The revised alternative FUS submitted by Parklea at the conclusion of its \nsubmission proposed a single active open space area moved further west from the exhibited location to abut the \ngas transmission line easement.  Council submitted that adoption of the alternative FUS would require a \nfundamental review of the PSP and added that there was not a significant shortcoming in the PSP that would \nwarrant such a review. Council observed that AOS 2 would not meet Standard S13 which requires a minimum of 8 \nhectares. Mr Atkinson acknowledged this point.  Council argued that splitting the open space would result in \nparents having to travel to different venues. However, the exhibited open space provision would provide parents \nwith the opportunity of \u201cwalking from game to game at the same venue to see their kids play, than to make multiple \ncar trips and waste time finding a car park.\u201d  Mr Simon\u2019s evidence, on behalf of Council, was that the exhibited SR-\n02 active open space did not allow for senior sized ovals in accordance with the Council\u2019s Recreation Reserve \nFacility Standards Policy and that the configuration of the sporting facilities was not functional. Mr Simon stated that \nalthough the VPA had agreed to increase the size of this reserve by 0.5 hectares to 14.1 hectares, the only \nworkable solution to achieve proper size, orientation and car parking was to modify the shape of the land and \nincrease the area by a further 0.2 hectares.  Council concluded that:  Mr Simon's statement reflects the need for \n455 car parking spaces, and the preparation of a revised plan by the VPA to provide an additional 0.2 Ha of land to \naccommodate the increased car parking requirement. The car parking shortfall can be seen at regional sports \nfacilities such as Point Cook on a weekend where overflow car parking spills onto the road reserves for significant \ndistances. Mr Simon suggests further 0.2 Ha of land is needed.  The VPA submitted that the location of SR-02 has \nlimited slope with the steepest gradient around 1:17 on the northeast boundary. This grade was not considered \nproblematic in the delivery of a sports reserve. In addition, splitting the open space would not result in the efficient \ndelivery of facilities:  The VPA does not consider Parklea's proposed increase in the number of sports reserves to \nbe beneficial as it reduces the ability for sharing facilities. The relocation of the active open space to the west \nnegatively impacts on the active transport accessibility to the sports reserve. The proposed AOS 2 does not meet \nCouncil's standards. A larger sports reserve, as proposed in the exhibited PSP, allows for greater flexibility of use \nas there is more area to work with. The indoor recreation centre will be retained as located in the exhibited PSP.  \n(iv) Discussion  Relocating the government secondary school  The central elements of the alternative FUS were the \nrelocation of the government secondary school to the east and splitting the abutting open space into two parcels. \nAs discussed above, the realignment of the boulevard connector street is a matter of design detail.  Mr Panozzo\u2019s \nargument was, in effect, that a greater proportion of the catchment coming from the east of Pakenham East was a \njustification for relocating the school closer to that direction. However, he acknowledged that most of the students \nattending the school from the east would travel either by car or public transport.  My Higgs estimated that the travel \ntime difference between the two school sites would be in the order of 2-3 minutes by vehicle. In the Panel\u2019s view \nthis would seem to make very little overall difference to the travel times of those coming from the east.  DET \nsubmitted that 80 per cent of the catchment of the proposed school would be within Pakenham East and it expected \nthat the established urban area to the west would make up most of the remainder of the catchment. Mr Panozzo\u2019s \nevidence was that 50 per cent of the catchment would be within Pakenham East with the remainder coming from \nthe east and northeast.  However, in cross-examination, Mr Panozzo acknowledged that his calculations were \nbased on census data and not the actual population expected within the Pakenham East. He also confirmed that \nthe anticipated population projected in the PSP was the equivalent of 80 per cent of the benchmark of 9,000 \ndwelling requirement for a secondary school. Given the area of developable land within Pakenham East and the \nexpected density of 22 dwellings per hectare, the Panel accepts the position of DET that Pakenham East will form \nmost of the catchment of the new school.  All submitters agreed that the co-location of the school with active space \nwas a practical and desirable outcome. The evidence presented to the Panel supported this view as well.  The \nPanel acknowledges that the topography may present a challenge to cyclists as well as construction. However, in \nthe Panel\u2019s view the slopes and gradients likely to be encountered are not uncommon in metropolitan Melbourne or \nsubstantial enough to warrant relocating the school.  Splitting the sports reserve  In the Panel\u2019s view splitting SR-\n\n\n\n02 appears to have little merit. Mr Simon\u2019s evidence was that the area of SR-02 was inadequate to accommodate \nall the facilities required. The Panel accepts this evidence and notes that the VPA has adopted Mr Simon\u2019s \nrecommendations.  Therefore, it is difficult to see how splitting the sports reserve would provide an improved \noutcome. From the evidence presented to the Panel and the responses in cross-examination it became clear to the \nPanel that the proposed AOS 2, which would be co-located with a relocated school, has substantial design and \nconfiguration issues. Not the least of these was the separation of the AFL ovals from the netball courts. In cross-\nexamination, Mr Panozzo had some difficulty in explaining the additional flexibility provided by AOS 2 as well as the \njustification for the separation of AFL and netball facilities.  The Panel agrees with the Council that there is nothing \nfundamentally wrong with the exhibited FUS to warrant a revision as proposed by Parklea in the alternative FUS. \nTo some extent Parklea acknowledged this position by submitting a further revision to its proposed FUS (Document \n92).  However, in the Panel\u2019s view, the alignment of the active open space along the gas transmission line has \nsome merit. The Panel notes the version 3 alternative FUS (Document 92) proposed this change and \nacknowledges that, from the perspective of more efficient use of valuable urban land, the location of the open space \nabutting the gas easement results in a desirable outcome and warrants furthered consideration. Nevertheless, the \nPanel accepts the submission of the VPA that this option results in a school with two road frontages which is \ninconsistent with PSP Guidelines and exposes the school to potential noise issues from the Princes Freeway.  \nTherefore, the Panel supports the FUS as exhibited with the changes agreed in the Final List of PSP Changes.  (v) \nConclusions  The Panel concludes:      the exhibited location of the government secondary school is appropriate.     \nthe sports reserve SR-02 should be provided in one location     the exhibited FUS is appropriate     further \nconsideration should be given to locating SR-02 next to the gas transmission line easement.  3.4 Drainage  (i) The \nissues  The primary issue is whether the width of the drainage reserves on the east side of Deep Creek and \nHancocks Gully can be reduced from the widths shown on Plan 09 \u2013 Integrated Water Management of the \nexhibited PSP.  Secondary issues relate to:      the size of water assets WI-02 and WI-04 and whether a new water \nasset within the powerline easement at the northern end Hancocks Gully could be added to reduce the size of WI-\n02 within the Hancocks Creek drainage scheme     whether PSP Plans 3 and 9 should delineate the extreme \noverland flood flow path provision as outlined in the Ryan Road drainage scheme to the south of Canty Lane.  (ii) \nEvidence and submissions  Drainage widths  An expert witness statement was prepared by Ms Mag for the VPA. \nMs Mag explained the analysis of three possible drainage strategies for the PSP area and concluded that:  The \nconcept design plans formulated in 2015 were used to set the drainage reserves detailed in the PEPSP. Further \nwork to bring the drainage assets designs to the functional design standards (in 2016 and 2017) confirmed that \nenough space had been allocated in the PEPSP to ensure all drainage elements can meet all authority \nrequirements going forward.  I conclude that Amendment C234 is appropriate having regard to allowing adequate \ndrainage reserves to ensure enough space to develop the waterway, wetland and retarding basin functional designs \nto a detailed design standard, while ensuring all MWC, Council and other authority requirements are met going \nforward.  Three expert witness statements were prepared by Mr Bishop for Auscare Commercial Pty Ltd and \nEarldean Pty Ltd (Auscare & Earldean) (property 28), P and P Carney (properties 10, 11 and 14) and Lendlease \n(properties 7, 8 and 9). In his statements, Mr Bishop concluded with respect to the drainage corridor widths that:      \nThe present waterway corridor (along Deep Creek) appears to be excessive and that there is a reasonable \nopportunity to reduce the corridor to something between 50 metres and 100 metres through a refined design and \nconfirmation of a reduced design flow     There is no clear hydraulic justification for the provision of additional \nwaterway width on the east side of Deep Creek compared to the west side through the subject site and the 1% AEP \ndesign flows can be accommodated through a modified floodway geometry in a corridor less than 100 metres wide \non the east side of Deep Creek     Some marginal reduction in waterway width (over Hancocks Gully) may be \npossible during detailed design if adequate performance and design standards can be demonstrated.  At the \nrequest of the Panel, a conclave of drainage experts including a representative of Melbourne Water was convened. \nThe conclave considered several drainage and flood plain matters including the width of the drainage reserves \nalong Deep Creek and Hancocks Gully. A statement from the conclave was submitted to the Panel (Document 14). \nThe conclave recommended that the PSP (Plan 9) should show:      a 100 metres corridor on the eastern side of \nDeep Creek while indicating that this could be reduced in the reach between Ryan Road and the Princes Highway \nthrough an appropriate design process and agreement with Melbourne Water and Council. The eastern corridor \nwidth should ultimately be no less than 50 metres from the eastern top of bank of Deep Creek     a 100 metres \ncorridor on the eastern side Deep Creek while indicating that this may be reduced marginally (conclave\u2019s emphasis) \nbetween the Princes Highway and the powerline easement through an appropriate design process and agreement \n\n\n\nwith Melbourne Water and Council     A minimum 55 metre reserve width for drainage purposes over Hancocks \nGully     The note on Plan 9 should allow for reduction in reserve areas if all Melbourne Water and Council \nrequirements are met during the design process.  The VPA noted that Melbourne Water is the relevant authority \nwith respect to drainage schemes and designs Development Services Schemes (DSSs) to masterplan the drainage \nand waterway infrastructure required to service urban development within a PSP area. The VPA submitted that:  \nDSSs are a conceptual design and provide for flexibility at functional design, subject to achievement of the DSS \ndesign objectives. In practice this permits a level of flexibility in the delivery of the systems. It is common practice \nthat, notwithstanding the content of a DSS, Melbourne Water will accept at permit application stage, or before, \nproposed variations to a DSS where the alternate scheme still satisfies its functional and cost requirements. \nUltimately the schemes will be approved/amended to ensure consistency between the PSP at gazettal and the final \nscheme design. The VPA acknowledges, as it has done in a number of PSP matters that it is important that the \nPSP provide an adequate level of flexibility to accommodate such changes. Frequently this is achieved through a \nnote on the Plan 9 or its equivalent.  The VPA noted that a conclave of the drainage experts had been held and in \nclosing, submitted that:  The VPA has premised its case upon the inherent flexibility available to development \nproponents to vary the DSS approved designs. The evidence before the Panel from Mr Bishop supports this \napproach and confirms that it is the usual approach. Further the evidence is that the precise setback to Deep Creek \nis unknown.  In these circumstances the VPA is content to adopt the following words at Plan 9 of the PSP at page \n56 in addition to the existing note.  In relation to the Ryan Road drainage scheme the width of the \nwaterway/drainage assets east of Deep Creek must be a minimum of 50 metres and a maximum of 100 metres \nfrom the eastern top bank of Deep Creek.  This largely adopts the requested language.  With respect to the width of \nthe Hancocks Gully drainage reserve, the VPA noted that a 55 metre wide corridor could accommodate the \nrequired constructed waterway but that the extra 10 metres provides for other possible uses around the waterway. \nWhile Melbourne Water would consider a 55 metre wide corridor consistent with its guidelines, it had based the \nwaterway corridor width of 65 metres on the expert opinion of Ms Mag.  The VPA submitted that:  In summary, \nVPA, Melbourne Water and Council recommend a 65m wide corridor to comply with the Melbourne Water \nWaterway Corridor Guidelines 2013, which provide for a holistic approach to waterway design by factoring in the \nbroader community and environmental benefits that waterways provide in urban areas.  Council submitted that, with \nrespect to Hancocks Gully:  To the extent that the conclave statement provided agreement to reduce the waterway \ncorridor to 55 metres, this was only for drainage purposes and did not take into account the shared paths or other \nplanning considerations. The experts agreed that WSUD requirements had not been factored into that assessment  \nCouncil added that Table 4 of the Waterways Corridors, Guidelines for Greenfield Development Areas within the \nPort Phillip and Westernport Region (Document 15) should be used arguing that the proposition that Table 3 be \nused was erroneous and ignored the provision of shared paths on either side of the waterway. It noted the evidence \nof Ms Mag that a 40 metre hydraulic width was required and therefore after allowing for shared paths and potentially \nhigher standards of flood retention, a 65 metre wide corridor was a reasonable starting point for detailed design.  In \nclosing, Council submitted that:  ... the Panel should not be persuaded that there is likely to be major change to the \ndrainage corridor ... the starting point should be to ask whether there is any proper basis to substantially reduce the \narea of land that will be regarded as being encumbered for drainage and flood management purposes.  It added \nthat Council remained of the view that a 65 metre corridor is appropriate for Hancocks Gully.  XWB Consulting for P \nand P Carney noted the conclave recommended that the 100 metres corridor on the eastern side of Deep Creek \ncould be reduced marginally although the term \u201creduced marginally\u201d was not defined in the conclave report. It \nsubmitted that in cross-examination, there was not a consensus in the responses of Ms Mag and Mr Bishop with \nMs Mag suggesting more limited scope and Mr Bishop greater scope.  XWB submitted that:  We say that the 100 \nmetre reserve is not fixed, and that there was agreement at the conclave that the width of the reserve could be \nreduced through an appropriate design process and through agreement with Melbourne Water and Council. The \nVPA has also acknowledged that the Drainage Service Schemes (DSS) are a conceptual design and provide \nflexibility at functional design subject to the achievement of DSS design objectives. As such the VPA acknowledges \nthat it is important that the PSP provide an adequate level of flexibility to accommodate design changes. We urge \nthe Panel to recommend that appropriate flexibility be built into the PSP in relation to the width of the Deep Creek \nReserve.  ...  Finally, we disagree with the last outcome of the conclave of experts to the extent that Council is also \nincluded in the note to Plan 9. We say these matters should be rightly left with Melbourne Water as the drainage \nauthority to approve.  Auscare & Earldean opined that the PSP ought reflect the agreed outcomes of the drainage \nexperts\u2019 conclave and ... To the extent that it continues to refer to a drainage reserve of a 100 metre width, it is \n\n\n\ninconsistent with the agreed findings of the Conclave and furthermore, is likely to lead to unnecessary confusion \nand dispute concerning the area to be set aside for the floodway corridor.  Auscare & Earldean submitted that there \nhas been no compelling case made to substantiate the drainage width of 100 metres and noted that the DSS for \nRyan Road is apparently yet to be finalised and accordingly can be updated to reflect the conclave outcomes.  It \nadded that while detailed design and further modelling is required before the width of the floodway corridor will be \nknown, this does not substantiate the insertion of the 100 metres width on PSP Plan 9.  Auscare & Earldean \nsubmitted further that the current note on Plan 9 does not provide the requisite degree of flexibility and that:  ... the \nmost appropriate course is to remove the designated widths from Plan 9 and instead, include a notation for each of \nthe drainage schemes which identifies the agreed parameters within which the drainage reserve will be located.  \nAuscare & Earldean sought a recommendation from the Panel that the drainage widths be deleted from PSP Plan \n9 and that the note to Plan 9 be augmented with the following words:  In relation to the Ryan Road Drainage \nScheme the width of the drainage reserve east of Deep Creek will be a minimum of 50 metres and a maximum of \n100 metres from the eastern top of the bank of Deep Creek.  Lendlease stated that following agreement at the \nconclave that drainage assets as presented in the PSP could be refined, Mr Bishop was asked (by Lendlease) to \nprepare a further assessment in which he found that the width of WI-01 (Hancocks Gully) could be redesigned to a \nminimum of 45 metres (see Document 108).  Lendlease acknowledged that Mr Bishop had applied Table 4 of the \nWaterways Corridors, Guidelines for Greenfield Development Areas within the Port Phillip and Westernport Region \n(Document 15) resulting in his agreement to a corridor width of 55 metres. It noted that under cross-examination, \nMr Bishop agreed that Table 3 of those guidelines can be used in the context of the constructed waterway on \nHancocks Gully with there being active edges on both sides of the corridor as shown on Appendix D of the \nexhibited PSP waterway cross-section.  Lendlease submitted that it was appropriate for the waterway to provide a \nwidth of 45 metres.  Water assets WI-02 and WI-04  In his written evidence and later additional analysis (Document \n108), Mr Bishop concluded that the size of WI-02 could potentially be reduced through expansion of WI-04 or \nutilisation of a new asset in the powerline easement at the northern end of Hancocks Gully. He noted that the \ncurrent drainage strategy for Hancocks Creek DSS relies on two online wetlands and retarding basins treating \nrunoff from development within the PSP area and the external upstream catchment. His proposed alternative could \ninclude a retrofit of an existing dam to create a retarding basin/wetland within the existing dam footprint which is \nlocated within the powerline easement and straddles the northern boundary of the PSP.  Ms Mag stated in her \nwritten evidence that the proposed strategy deliberately placed all drainage assets within the PSP area. She noted \nthat use of the existing dam was originally considered but that Melbourne Water made it clear that it would not take \nresponsibility for that existing asset (the dam) as part of the DSS. She added that:  In addition, placing retarding \nbasins at the lowest point in the contributing catchments is best practice in regard to optimising asset size etc.  At \nthe experts\u2019 conclave, Ms Mag agreed that additional flood storage could occur in the powerline easement but that \nwould need the agreement of Melbourne Water and Council.  The conclave recommended that:  The note on Plan \n9 should allow for reduction in reserve areas if all Melbourne Water and Council requirements are met during the \ndesign process. This must be proven on a catchment scale to the outfall of Hancocks Gully at the Freeway (that is \nto the WI-04 outfall)  The VPA stated that Melbourne Water had expressed concerns with the proposal put by \nLendlease (as set out by Mr Bishop) to accommodate some of the drainage assets outside the PSP area to the \nnorth. The VPA submitted that:  Melbourne Water does not support the use of drainage assets outside the PSP \nboundary where the natural topography of the catchment is appropriate for the location of stormwater treatment of \nretarding basin assets. A key rationale for this is the capacity of the DSS to control the necessary land and if \nrequired acquire the land.  The VPA also noted that stormwater assets provide multiple benefits for the community \nincluding passive recreation, increased biodiversity and amenity and that there was a question of policy and legality \nwith supporting urban development within UGZ land with assets located on land outside the UGZ.  Council \nsubmitted that:  More broadly, it is apparent that the drainage issues in this catchment need to be mindful of the \npotential for impacts in the Koo Wee Rup Flood Management District.  Urban development should not cause or \nexacerbate flood risks in downstream environments.  Lendlease submitted that the additional modelling by Mr \nBishop had shown that drainage assets can be engineered in various cost-effective ways all of which constituted \nbest practice design. It acknowledged the concerns of the VPA, Council and Melbourne Water with potential issues \nin utilising the existing dam to the north notwithstanding Mr Bishop\u2019s statement that the dam could be used in a \ncost-effective way.  Lendlease therefore proposed the adoption of an option proposed by Mr Bishop to reduce the \nsize of the retarding basin WI-02 on the Lendlease land, ignoring the upstream existing dam. It submitted that:  \nAlthough the ultimate size of drainage assets can be refined during development stage, it is crucial to illustrate the \n\n\n\nmost accurate representation of the asset at the strategic planning stage to ensure the alteration of the ICP public \nequalisation rate is minimised.  In oral submissions at the Hearing, Mr James Taylor stated that he was a property \nowner to the south of the PSP and that Hancocks Gully runs through his property. He expressed strong support for \nthe drainage strategy prepared by Ms Mag which he described as \u201ccomprehensive\u201d and \u201cshould not be tinkered \nwith.\u201d Mr Taylor submitted that modelling to determine the size of drainage assets should have a margin of error.  \nOverland flood flow path  Mr Bishop concluded that the existing hydraulic analysis did not appear to have fully \nresolved the significant break-out of floodplain flow to the south of Canty Lane in the 1 per cent AEP design flood.  \nThe conclave of drainage experts recommended that the extreme flow overland flow path provisions should be \nclearly delineated on PSP Plans 3 and 9 between Deep Creek and water asset WI-07.  The VPA advised that \nMelbourne Water was satisfied for the overland flow path to be shown on PSP Plan 9, noting that the proportion of \noverland flow down the road would depend on the volume of fill placed in the area in and around Canty Lane \n(which would be addressed at the functional design of the subdivision).  Council submitted that:  The experts \nagreed that the PSP should be amended to provide greater detail regarding the need for an overland flow path, in \nthe location described in the plans prepared by Stormy Water Solutions, between Deep Creek and WI-07.  Council \npreferred that the extreme overland flow path provision be shown only on Plan 9. It suggested that this information \ndid not need to be shown on Plan 3.  (iii) Discussion  The exhibited PSP Plan 9 \u2013 Integrated Water Management \nshows a drainage corridor width of 100 metres along Deep Creek, narrowing to 50 metres as the creek approaches \nCanty Lane, and a 65 metres wide waterway corridor along Hancocks Gully. A note to Plan 9 states that these \nwaterway widths are subject to confirmation through detailed design to the satisfaction of Melbourne Water.  The \nPanel notes that as outlined by the VPA, the waterway management plan shown in a PSP is often subject to \nrefinement as a result of detailed design work and modified to reflect the Development Services Scheme ultimately \napproved by Melbourne Water.  Submissions were made that the indicative waterway widths exhibited in the PSP \nshould be reduced. All the drainage experts agreed that there was scope to reduce the waterway widths at the \ndetailed design stage.  The Panels considers that the note to Plan 9 as exhibited already provides flexibility for the \nwaterway widths to be reduced as a result of detailed design. The addition to the Plan 9 note of the words proposed \nby the VPA would emphasise this flexibility with respect to Deep Creek and should, in the view of the Panel, satisfy \nthe parties who made submissions seeking clarity around design flexibility.  The outstanding issue is what, if any, \nindicative waterway widths should be shown on Plan 9. There seemed to be general agreement on 50-100 metres \nfor Deep Creek when read in conjunction with the Plan 9 note, as amended. The conclave recommended 55 \nmetres for Hancocks Gully but the VPA and Council both argued for 65 metres on the basis that in addition to \ndrainage requirements, an allowance should be made for pathways and other amenity aspects of the waterways. A \ndissenting view was put by Auscare & Earldean. It argued no waterway widths at all should be shown on Plan 9.  \nThe Panel agrees that widths shown on Plan 9 are indicative only and should be interpreted that way. In the \nPanel\u2019s view, the note to Plan 9 makes clear that there is flexibility and scope for a reduction in the waterway \nwidths at the detailed design stage.  The Panel considers that the indicative waterway widths should be shown on \nPSP Plan 9. In the case of Hancocks Gully, there was much debate at the Hearing as to whether Table 3 or Table \n4 of the Melbourne Water guidelines should be applied. No consensus was reached but in the Panel\u2019s view, \nnothing much turns on which Table is applied to estimate the width of the constructed waterway corridor. That will \nbe resolved by detailed design after taking into account drainage requirements and providing for other aspects such \nas shared paths along the waterways.  While noting the advice of the conclave of experts that a minimum (Panel \nemphasis) of 55 metres should be used on Plan 9, the Panel agrees with the VPA and Council that a width of 65 \nmetres should be retained at this stage for the reasons put forward by the VPA and Council.  Turning to the issue of \nthe size of the wetlands/retarding basins WI-02 and WI-04, the Panel notes that in submissions at the Hearing, \nLendlease did not pursue the option put by Mr Bishop that the refitting of the existing dam on the northern boundary \ncould be used to reduce the size of WI-02. Putting that aspect to one side, the issue is whether the DSS could be \nredesigned to include an additional wetlands/retarding basin within the powerline easement thereby providing scope \nfor a resizing of WI-02 and potentially WI-04.  It may be the case that a detailed design incorporating an addition \nretarding basin in the powerline easement could be prepared which satisfies the requirements of Melbourne Water \nand presumably with the agreement of the powerline company. The Panel agrees that such an outcome should not \nbe ruled out at this stage. Flexibility is provided for changes at the detailed design stage. The Panel was not \nconvinced, however, that sufficient analysis had been completed at this time to justify a reduction in the size of \nwater asset WI-02 (as sought by Lendlease) to be shown on PSP Plan 9. The Panel was not presented with \nevidence that Melbourne Water had or would agree to such a change. The Panel is also mindful of the need to \n\n\n\nensure that the design of the wetlands/retarding basins in the drainage scheme must be done on a holistic basis to \nmitigate any impacts of urban development on the area to the south of the PSP.  On the question of whether the \noverland flood flow path should be shown on relevant PSP plans, there was consensus that the flow path should be \nmapped. The only issue is whether the flow path should be shown on both plans 3 and 9 as recommended by the \nconclave of drainage experts. Melbourne Water has agreed for it to be mapped on Plan 9. The Panel agrees with \nCouncil that it is unnecessary to show the overland flow path on both Plan 3 \u2013 which is the FUS and Plan 9. The \nPanel considers Plan 9 to be the most relevant plan in this instance.  Conclusions  The Panel concludes:      as \nwith previous PSPs, there is flexibility for the PSP Plan 9 \u2013 Integrated Water Management to be updated to reflect \nthe Development Services Schemes finally approved by Melbourne Water     the note on Plan 9 as exhibited \nprovides the flexibility for drainage assets and waterway widths to be modified at the detailed design stage subject \nto agreement with Melbourne Water     the addition of the words to the note on PSP Plan 9 \u2013 Integrated Water \nManagement proposed by the VPA will add emphasis to this flexibility and should be included in the note to PSP \nPlan 9     the waterway widths shown on the exhibited PSP Plan 9 should be retained noting that the widths shown \nare indicative and can be reduced through detailed design and agreement with Melbourne Water     the size of the \nwater assets WI-02 and WI-04 as shown on the exhibited PSP Plan 9 should not be reduced unless and until there \nis agreement with Melbourne Water following detailed design of the drainage scheme     the overland flood flow \npath should be mapped by Melbourne Water and added to PSP Plan 9.  (iv) Recommendations  The Panel makes \nthe following recommendations:      Amend the Note to Plan 9 \u2013 Integrated Water Management of the Pakenham \nEast Precinct Structure Plan by adding the words:  In relation to the Ryan Road drainage scheme the width of the \nwaterway/drainage assets east of Deep Creek must be a minimum of 50 metres and a maximum of 100 metres \nfrom the eastern top bank of Deep Creek.      Amend Plan 9 \u2013 Integrated Water Management of the Pakenham \nEast Precinct Structure Plan to show the overland flood flow path as determined by Melbourne Water.  4 \nAmendment issues  4.1 Zones and overlays  (i) The issues  The issues are:      whether the zones and overlays \napplied in the vicinity of Deep Creek are appropriate     whether the application of the Heritage Overlay is \nappropriate     should gaming machines be prohibited in the shopping centre complex including Pakenham East \nLTC and LCC Centre?  (ii) Background  The VPA advised that the exhibited Amendment would rezone the land in \nthe electricity transmission line easement to SUZ8, land within 50-100 metres of the midline of Deep Creek to RCZ2 \nand the remainder of Pakenham East to the UGZ5. The applied zones are shown in Table 2 Use?      Applied Zone \nPrimary arterial road      Road Zone Category 1 Small local enterprise precinct      Commercial 2 Zone Local town \ncentre Local convenience centre      Commercial 1 Zone Residential on a lot wholly within walkable residential \ncatchment boundary (once subdivided)      Residential Growth Zone All other land      General Residential Zone  \nTable 2    Applied zones in the exhibited Urban Growth Zone Schedule 5  In its opening submission the VPA \nrecommended that the zoning along Deep Creek be included in the UGZ5 because the primary purpose of the land \nwas a drainage corridor and not a conservation area.  (iii) Evidence and submissions  Deep Creek  The VPA \nsubmitted that the UFZ was too restrictive while the UGZ provided some flexibility for landowners to review the \ndrainage land requirements. The VPA added that it and Melbourne Water agreed that, if the drainage corridor was \nadjusted, there might be \u201cawkward spaces between the UFZ land and the location of active open space.\u201d  The VPA \nobserved that there was a Floodway Overlay along the Deep Creek which extended onto land shown for residential \ndevelopment. The VPA advised that the Floodway Overlay (FO) prohibits subdivision on land within the overlay and \nthat the map deleting the FO had been omitted from the exhibited Amendment.  The VPA noted that while the \ndeletion of this overlay was an omission from the exhibited Amendment its presence serves to prevent the \nresidential development of land as envisaged by the PSP. Consequently, it proposed instead to replace the FO with \nthe Land Subject to Inundation Overlay (LSIO), which would accord with similar other sections of the Deep Creek \narea both north and south of the PSP site.  The VPA submitted that it and Melbourne recognised the issue raised \nby Council and proposed the following additional requirement in response:  Any reduction in waterway corridors / \ndrainage assets shown on Plan 9 must result in additional local park(s) being provided to ensure the ICP public \nland equalisation rate is not altered for the overall PSP area. Waterway corridors / drainage assets must not be \nreduced where it would result in residential land being created between the waterway corridor / drainage asset and \na sports reserve or local park.  Council noted that the exhibited Amendment included a proposal to rezone land \nalong the Deep Creek to the Rural Conservation Zone. It did not propose a change to the existing FO over much of \nDeep Creek, a control which applies to mainstream flooding in both rural and urban areas...[which] convey active \nflood flows or store floodwater in a similar way to the UFZ, but with a lesser flood risk.  Council submitted that it did \nnot support the rezoning of the land covered by the LSIO to the UGZ5. Council tendered a broad scale zoning map \n\n\n\n(Document 59) of the Cardinia Shire to support its submission and argued that the plan showed that the Urban \nFloodway Zone had been applied to watercourses throughout the municipality. It added that:  In the northern part of \nthe precinct the land in the LSIO is wedged between an active sports reserve and the waterway. A residential \noutcome in this area would be isolated and out of place. It would not provide for an appropriate interface between \nthe active open space and the waterway.  Council advised the Panel that, in the absence of a final drainage \nstrategy informed by flood modelling, it was premature to reduce the existing FO and recommended the Public Park \nand Recreation Zone and Urban Floodway Zone as alternates. It submitted the risk was that any reduction in the \nland required for drainage could result in an increase in the UGZ5. If this occurred, Council submitted, it could \ncreate an area of land between the reserve SR-01 and the waterway where the applied zone would be GRZ. \nCouncil added:  If Melbourne Water is subsequently persuaded to reduce the Floodway Overlay, it may provide this \nadvice to the Minister. As the government has a conflict of interest in applying the UGZ, because it will raise GAIC \nfunds, it is important that the Panel scrutinise any change from the Rural Conservation Zone to the Urban Growth \nZone. It should base its decision on the drainage evidence, rather than the 'whole of government position' advanced \nby the VPA.  XWB Consulting submitted that it supports the proposal by VPA to replace the FO along Deep Creek \nwith a LSIO, on the basis that without this change \u201clarge areas of land identified in the PSP for residential \ndevelopment could not be subdivided.\u201d XWB Consulting informed the Panel that the same approach was adopted \nin Amendment C92 to the Cardinia Planning Scheme for the Cardinia Road Precinct Structure Plan and \nAmendment C149 to the Cardinia Planning Scheme for the Officer Precinct Structure Plan.  XWB Consulting \nopposed the application of the RCZ to the Deep Creek Corridor because it provided no flexibility with the boundary \nof the reserve. It submitted that the Deep Creek Reserve should be included in the UGZ5.  Heritage Overlay  The \nAmendment identified three places for inclusion in the Heritage Overlay, all of which were regarded as of local \nheritage significance. These places were:      32 Mount Ararat South Road, Nar Nar Goon (HO275)     140 Ryan \nRoad, Pakenham (HO276)     Pear tree on Dore Road (HO277).  At the Hearing the VPA advised the Panel that it \nproposed to delete 140 Ryan Road, Pakenham (HO276) and 32 Mount Ararat South Road, Nar Nar Goon (HO275) \nfrom the exhibited Amendment. The VPA informed the Panel that 140 Ryan Road, Pakenham been legally \ndemolished and damage to 32 Mount Ararat South Road, Nar Nar Goon was such that the Heritage Overlay was no \nlonger appropriate.  SR Holdings Investment Group Pty Ltd (SR Holdings) sought to have HO275 removed from the \nAmendment because the building no longer represented local heritage significance. Evidence provided by Mr Peter \nBarrett confirmed that damage to the house, Carinya, has compromised its heritage value. In addition, structural \nengineering evidence provided by Mr Shabanpoor found that there were various structural issues including age, \ntermite infestation and moisture as well as partial collapse of the house that would impact retention of the structure. \nSR Holdings advised the Panel that a demolition permit had been sought after the owners had been issued with a \nstop work notice issued by Council.  Council expressed concern that, while the site was nominated for heritage \ncontrol, the present state of the building meant that it could not be retained. Council requested that the site be \nexcised from the UGZ and be made the subject of a note clarifying that the PSP does not apply to that area of land, \nfor the purposes of the UGZ. Council submitted that the Panel make a finding that:  The application of a Heritage \nOverlay would have been justified, but for the damage that occurred to the structure.  In its closing submission \nCouncil went on to suggest:  However, if the Panel does not accept that submission, it should at least consider \nwhether a Design and Development Overlay could be supported on an interim basis to allow a more fulsome \nargument about the merits of re-creating heritage to be had.  SR Holdings recommended that:      Cardinia Shire \nCouncil confirm in writing that it supported the removal of the Heritage Overlay from the site and consequential \nupdates to the PSP and ordinance     the Panel having no objection to the above     no other changes to the \nexhibited Amendment be made that impact on 32 Mount Ararat South Road.  The VPA submitted that it proposed to \ndelete the site 32 Mount Ararat South Road, Nar Nar Goon (HO275) from the exhibited Amendment and the \nHeritage Overlay in its Final List of PSP Changes.  Lendlease submitted that it would be highly problematic to retain \nthe pear tree on Dore Road (HO277), given the steepness of the site and likely impact of earthworks in the area. \nThe VPA in its response to submissions did not support this position.  Ms Chantelle McLachlan requested that a \nnumber of historical references be corrected in the background report Post Contact Heritage Assessment October \n2017 and not added as an addendum to the report, because she felt that the latter would get \u201clost\u201d.  Ms McLachlan \nalso referred to the Lendlease submission and noted the old English Oak Tree located in the north-west of the \nnorthern homestead is identified as of \u201chigh amenity value\u201d in the background reports by Context and John Patrick. \nShe requested that the VPA investigate the tree\u2019s retention at the detailed subdivision stage. While Lendlease \nsought no specific action for the PSP, Ms McLachlan requested the addition of guidelines on how the tree can be \n\n\n\nutilised in development with community amenity value rather than on a private property or in a nature strip.  Council \nconfirmed it supported efforts to protect this tree and suggested that the PSP could potentially create a site-specific \ncontrol.  The VPA accepted Council\u2019s submission and proposed to show the tree location on Plan 2 - Precinct \nFeatures. Lendlease submitted that the placement of the tree in subsequent layout plans could be investigated at \nthe detailed subdivision stage.  (iv) Discussion  Deep Creek  As discussed above, the Panel accepts the view that \nchanges will occur as detailed assessments and applications take place within the framework established by the \nPSP. In the case of waterways, where changes are proposed by landowners they need to be assessed and \napproved by the relevant servicing authority, in this case Melbourne Water.  The Panel acknowledges that the VPA \nand Melbourne Water agree with the outcome sought by Council which is to prevent any potential residential \ndevelopment between sports reserve SR-01 and the Deep Creek drainage corridor. The VPA, with Melbourne \nWater, initially proposed a change to the requirements of the PSP as discussed above. In the Final List of PSP \nChanges the VPA further refined these requirements to state:  Where ultimate drainage design increases the area \navailable for residential development, a proportion of credited open space must be provided, equal to the Public \nLand Equalisation Rate as specified in the Pakenham East ICP to the satisfaction of the responsible authority.  \nWaterway corridors/drainage assets must not be reduced where it would result in residential land being created \nbetween the waterway corridor/drainage asset and a sports reserve or local park.  In the Panel\u2019s view this change \nappropriately addresses the issue identified by Council.  The Panel notes from the Final List of PSP Changes the \nVPA proposal to remove the RCZ2, as well as the IPO2. The land would then be in the UGZ, with LSIO over the \nDeep Creek area. The Panel agrees that the prime purpose of the land is as a drainage corridor. This view is \nsupported by the evidence of a number of experts, in different fields. From this perspective the Panel agrees that \nthe most appropriate zone for the land is the UGZ in combination with the LSIO.  Heritage  The Panel accepts the \nsubmission by the VPA that the property at 140 Ryan Road has been demolished in accordance with the relevant \npermits and, as a consequence, there is no point in proposing the Heritage Overlay on this site.  A similar argument \napplies to the property at 32 Mount Ararat South Road, Nar Nar Goon. The Panel does not support the submission \nof Council to excise the site from the UGZ and PSP. Given that both Council and the VPA have agreed not to \nproceed with the application of the Heritage Overlay to this site, the Panel sees little benefit in making an \nassessment whether the Heritage Overlay would have been justified for the site, as requested by Council.  This \nleaves one remaining Heritage Overlay of the original three proposed, and over a tree rather than a built structure. \nThe Panel notes the inclusion of such sites are now required through the recent VC148 to include a statement of \nsignificance and may also include heritage design guidelines and application requirements, strengthening the need \nfor new permit conditions provisions in Schedule 5 to Clause 37.07, as proposed in Document 146.  The Panel \nnotes that these changes have been included in the Final List of PSP Changes.  (v) Conclusions  The Panel \nconcludes:      the replacement of the FO with the LSIO is appropriate     the deletion of HO275 and HO276 is \nappropriate     the replacement of the RCZ2 in the exhibited Amendment with the UGZ5 is appropriate     the \nremoval of the IPO2 from the exhibited Amendment is appropriate     the proposed changes to deal with land \nbetween sports reserve SR-01 and Deep Creek are appropriate.  (vi) Recommendations  The Panel makes the \nfollowing recommendations:      Replace the Floodway Overlay over Deep Creek with the Land Subject to \nInundation Overlay.     Replace the Rural Conservation Zone Schedule 2 with the Urban Growth Zone Schedule 5.     \nDelete the Incorporated Plan Overlay Schedule 2.  4.2 Open space provision and location  (i) The issues  The \nissues are whether:      the size, layout and location of local sports reserves SR-01 and SR-02 are appropriate     \nthere is a need to provide a potential future sports reserve outside Pakenham East.  (ii) Background  Council, the \nDET, other organisations as well as affected landowners made submissions in relation to open space provision. \nThe VPA advised that it had reached agreement with Council and that Council\u2019s concerns had been largely \nresolved.  Most submissions related to the larger open space areas including local sports reserve and recreation \nsites, particularly SR-01 (northern sports reserve), SR-02 (southern sports reserve) and LP-01 (northern local \nHilltop Park).  Sports reserve SR-02 is dealt with substantively in section 0 with respect to the FUS. Local park LP-\n01 is dealt with in section 4.3, particularly in regards the road proposal running through the site. This section \nfocuses mainly on SR-01.  (iii) Evidence and submissions  SR-01  XWB Consulting proposed that SR-01 should be \nreconfigured to make an allowance for more residential land, with the effect of maximising yield for the landowners. \nXWB submitted that the trees at the northern end of the reserve which were marked for retention under the NVPP \nhad little conservation value. The removal of these trees would then enable the reconfiguration of SR-01 and \nreduce the land take necessary for the reserve.  Mr Simon\u2019s evidence made only passing reference to SR-01. \nHowever, he agreed the concept layout and potential utilisation of the reserve could be further optimised, for \n\n\n\nexample soccer fields are better located side by side, and closer to club rooms. Mr Simon observed that one of the \nconstraints on the land was the native vegetation shown for retention and the gas easement. This matter is \ndiscussed in more detail in section 4.4 below.  XWB Consulting also expressed concern that the retained \nvegetation and gas transmission line easement are treated as exclusive elements rather than integrated into the \nnetwork of parks and facilities.  Council submitted that \u201cthere may be opportunities to maximise the efficiency of the \nuse of the SR-01\u201d and recommended the Panel review yield on a precinct-wide basis. It submitted that the overall \nlevel of credited open space is less than 6 per cent required by the PSP Guidelines.  The VPA expressed similar \nreluctance to reduce active open space, which throughout Pakenham East accounts for 5.49 per cent rather than \nthe recommended 6 per cent. It submitted that \u201cit is not necessary that the concept plans utilise each and every \nsquare metre of the active open space at this time\u201d, recognising the concept stage will be followed by detailed \ndesign and likely variation from what is shown in the PSP.  SR-02  The VPA advised the Panel that it accepted Mr \nSimon\u2019s evidence and agreed to reconfigure and increase the size of SR-02 by an additional 0.7 hectares to \naccommodate the required sports facilities, amend the PIP table and is satisfied of Council\u2019s assessment. Mr Simon \nprovided the Panel with a revised concept plan which included shared car parking with the school and the potential \nopportunity for joint use facilities (Appendix 2 in Document 69).  Potential future sports reserve  Due to the under \nprovision of active open space recommended in the PSP Guidelines, the FUS shows a potential future sports \nreserve outside the PSP area.  Mr Simon submitted that the reference was included:  as the total provision of \n23.68ha for sporting facilities (or 5.42% of the NDA) is less than the VPAs own provided standard of 6% of the NDA \nand validated by the fact that the total provision for sports facilities in the Pakenham East PSP is less than the \nplanning standard referred to in the VPAs own community facilities reference document, the Planning for \nCommunity Infrastructure in Growth Areas (Document 69).  David Young argued that there was a need for more \ncommunity and sporting facilities. Mr Young also asserted that there are not enough facilities for the planned mix of \npopulation especially for soccer and basketball.  Ante Krstulovie, the owner of the land, submitted that the property \nis unsuitable for such a reserve owing to topography.  In response, the VPA stated that the location of this facility is \na \u2018place-marker\u2019 and would be subject to more detailed investigations and analysis. Council agreed with this \nassessment.  (iv) Discussion  SR-01  The Panel is satisfied that the concept demonstrates that the required active \nrecreation facilities can be accommodated within SR-01, noting however, the Council and XWB reservations on \nhow certain facilities are positioned. The Panel agrees with the VPA position that the final configuration of SR-01 \nwill be subject to a detailed design \u2013 PSP Figure 3 is a concept.  Section 4.4 of this Report recommends a review of \nthe vegetation in the NVPP. The outcome of this review may, in turn, permit a substantial reconfiguration of the \nplan for SR-01. Given the slight under provision of sporting facilities and based on the VPA and Council position \nregarding detailed planning to follow the concept plans set out in the PSP, the Panel does not support any \nreduction in the size of SR-01.  SR-02  The Panel accepts the evidence of Mr Simon and acknowledges that while \na reconfiguration of SR-02 as per Council\u2019s suggestion (Appendix 2 of Document 69) may be more optimal, as with \nSR-01, the final plan will be subject to a detailed design. The Panel notes that the VPA has agreed to review the \nconcept and increase the area of the reserve by a total of 0.7 hectares in the Final List of PSP Changes.  Potential \nfuture sports reserve  Based on information presented, the Panel supports the designation of a potential future \nsports reserve in addition to the PSP area. The Panel notes the VPA position that this would need to be subject to \nseparate planning and detailed analysis to determine specific siting and facilities.  (v) Conclusions  The Panel \nconcludes:      the layout and location of specific facilities for SR-01 and SR-02 are appropriate for this concept-level \nstage, and may be altered in the detailed design stage     the size of sports SR-01 is appropriate     SR-02 should \nbe increased in size by 0.7 hectares from the exhibited plan     Plan 3 of the PSP should retain a reference to a \npotential future sports reserve.  4.3 Hilltop Park (LP-01)  (i) The issue  The issue is whether an access road through \nHilltop Park (LP-01) should be shown on the PSP Figure 5 \u2013 Hilltop Park Concept Plan.  (ii) Background  Lendlease \nsubmitted an alternative layout for the Hilltop Park LP-01 that incorporated a local access road through the park \nlocated in the \u201csaddle\u201d between the two ridges within the park area. In a supplementary statement (Document 104), \nMr Walsh stated that:  The purpose of this vehicle link is to provide a convenient connection for local residents to \nthe east of the reserve to access the reserve car park (on the west side of the reserve) without needing to travel via \nDore Road. Similarly, the proposed link will also provide connection to/from the primary school for dwellings located \nto the northwest of the reserve.  (iii) Evidence and submissions  Mr Walsh\u2019s evidence was that he considered the \nlink appropriate given that it would provide local access only, would carry only low volumes and be suitably treated \nto target low speeds and provide for pedestrian priority at identified crossing points.  In oral evidence at the \nHearing, Mr Walsh stated that he considered a vehicle link to be acceptable from a safety perspective with a \n\n\n\nminimum trafficable width and treatment to give pedestrians priority at crossing points. Under cross-examination, he \nagreed that if parking was provided on both sides of the reserve (as shown on the concept plan submitted by \nLendlease as Document 105 \u2013 Figure 6), the link would not be needed to provide easier access to car parking at \nthe reserve. He reiterated his view that the link would still be of benefit to residents to the northwest of the reserve \nby providing a more direct link to the proposed primary school in the northeast of the PSP.  2018_9109.png  Figure \n6: Lendlease Hilltop Schematic Masterplan proposal  Lendlease argued that the commentary of Mr Simon about \u201ca \nroad splitting the park into two\u201d was misleading. Lendlease stated that its intent was to create not a major road but \na connection or access that provided shared space to facilitate access while prioritising pedestrian access. \nLendlease noted that Hilltop Park was not a local park. It was a large park and destination that could divide the \nfuture communities unless a connection was provided through it. Lendlease added that there was nothing unusual \nin having a traffic link through a large park and cited Koornang Park in Elsternwick as an example where a through \nroad \u201cdelineates\u201d the park in half which does not impede the usability of the park but provides a connection.  \nLendlease requested that PSP Figure 5 be replaced by the Hilltop Schematic Masterplan (Document 105 \u2013 Figure 6 \nabove) with the following annotation:  Potential for a vehicle link through Hilltop Park to be designed and approved \nto the satisfaction of the responsible authority  Council argued that the evidence in support of the link was not \nstrong and the matter should be left for the subdivision process. Council submitted that:  Mr Simon has responded \nto the Lendlease proposal to dissect the park with a road. He does not support it.  It is submitted that the Panel \nneed not make any specific ruling about delivery of a road at this location. The open space can be reconfigured by \nagreement through a works in-kind arrangement, if a compelling case is put forward at the subdivision stage.  In the \nFinal List of PSP Changes, the VPA proposed that an additional note be included on PSP Figure 5 \u2013 Hilltop \nConcept Plan saying that there was potential for an access street to cross Hilltop Park to be designed and \napproved to the satisfaction of the responsible authority.  The VPA Final List of PSP Changes also proposed that \nHilltop Park (LP-01) be reduced by one hectare as shown in Lendlease\u2019s concept plan for the park. Council \nsubmitted that:  Despite the submissions advanced for Lendlease, Council has not agreed to reduce the area of the \nHilltop Park by 1 hectare. Council understands that this change affects the area set aside for a local access road \nalong the northern boundary of the park.  (iv) Discussion  Lendlease argued that it was not unusual to have a link \nroad running through a park as large as the proposed Hilltop Park. It was put to the Panel that a link would provide \naccess to the park\u2019s car parking for residents to the northwest of the park and would also improve access for those \nresidents to the proposed primary school in the east of the PSP.  The Panel accepts that an access road could be \ndesigned to address safety concerns for people using the park by slowing traffic and giving priority to pedestrians \nand cyclists. In the Panel\u2019s view, designing a new park with a road running through it would be undesirable and a \npoor outcome unless there were strong arguments in favour of such a road. The Panel was not convinced by the \nsubmissions made or the evidence given that the benefits of the proposed link road would outweigh the impacts of \nhaving a trafficable road through Hilltop Park.  There are examples of parks in Melbourne which have roads running \nthrough them. However, the example given by Lendlease (Koornang Park in Elsternwick) is in an old established \narea, and not of particular relevance in the context of a PSP.  The park masterplan tabled (Document 105) by \nLendlease clearly shows car parking on both sides of the park which negates one of the arguments put forward by \nLendlease. Under cross-examination, Mr Walsh conceded that to be case. The Panel also considers that \nLendlease\u2019s second suggested benefit of the proposed link road of improved access to the primary school for \nresidents in the northwest part of the PSP area to be tenuous at best. With no link road, residents of the northwest \narea could access the school with relative ease and little extra travel by using Dore Road and the east\u2013west \nconnector street. The Panel notes that a purpose of a connector street is just that; to provide access to services \nsuch as schools for people living in the PSP area.  The Panel notes the submission by Council that the matter of a \nlink road should be left to the subdivision stage when a link road could be considered if a compelling case where to \nbe made at that time. The Panel does not consider it necessary to add a note to the PSP Hilltop Park concept plan \nas proposed by the VPA in its Final List of PSP Changes that an access road through the park could be approved \nby the responsible authority.  Other than Council opposing a reduction in the size of Hilltop Park, there is insufficient \nevidence before it for the Panel to determine the merits of reducing the park\u2019s area by one hectare. A reduction in \nthe size of the park may be appropriate after a detailed design is prepared and agreed with Council.  (v) \nConclusions  The Panel concludes:      a compelling case for showing an indicative link road through Hilltop Park \nhas not been made at this stage in the PSP process     replacement of the Hilltop Park Concept Plan (Figure 5 in \nthe exhibited PSP) with the alternative masterplan submitted by Lendlease is not justified     it is unnecessary to \ninclude an additional note to the Hilltop Park Concept Plan indicating that an access road could be approved by the \n\n\n\nresponsible authority     a reduction in the size of Hilltop Park should be determined at the detail design stage.  4.4 \nNative Vegetation Precinct Plan  (i) The issues  The issues are:      the need to update the NVPP to reflect the \nDecember 2017 guidance on Preparing a Native Vegetation Precinct Plan (DELWP, 2017)     the characteristics of \nthe native vegetation in Pakenham East, on certain sites in particular and its appropriateness for inclusion in the \nNVPP     concern over loss of habitat and opportunity for enhanced conservation and habitat links between \nwaterways and open space provision.  (ii) Background  The Pakenham East \u2013 Native Vegetation Precinct Plan \nDecember 2017 prepared by Ecology and Heritage Partners identified some 530 scattered trees, with no nationally \nsignificant flora or fauna species recorded in the PSP area. The NVPP described the study area as:  highly \nmodified within private land and is dominated by introduced pasture grasses for grazing. Good quality patches of \nnative vegetation are located along road side reserves and riparian/creek lines. Remnant native vegetation \ncomprises several poor to good quality patches. Some scattered indigenous trees are also present through the \nstudy area.  The NVPP will be incorporated into the planning scheme and identifies:      native vegetation to be \nprotected and retained including remnant patches and scattered trees     native vegetation that can be removed, \ndestroyed or lopped     offset requirements.  The VPA advised:  Amendment VC 138 was gazetted on 12 December \n2017. The impact of the amendment was to introduce amendments to the management of native vegetation within \nVictoria.  More Specifically VC 138 changed the VPPs as it introduced new incorporated documents into planning \nschemes. These included the replacement of the Permitted clearing of native vegetation \u2013 Biodiversity assessment \nguidelines (Department of Environment and Primary Industries, (2013) with the new guidelines for the removal, \ndestruction or lopping of native vegetation (Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, 2017).  The \nNVPP for Pakenham East was prepared under the old regime. Given that the new guidelines have been introduced \nsubsequent to exhibition it is important that the NVPP be updated to accord with the new guidelines. This is not a \nnew issue it is one that has affected a number of PSPs prepared before VC138 but the carriage of which extends \nbeyond gazettal of that amendment.  (iii) Evidence and submissions  Updating the Native Vegetation Precinct Plan  \nIn its opening submission, the VPA confirmed that the NVPP for Pakenham East was prepared under the \u201cold \nregime\u201d, and thus would need to be updated to accord with the 2017 Guidelines. Following an assessment of \nsubmissions received in relation to the NVPP, the VPA advised that the NVPP would be updated after the Hearing \nto ensure it complies with the current NVPP template and any changes in policy since the NVPP was completed.  It \nwas further noted that this review would require a survey of large trees for patches (required for offset calculations) \nand an updated native vegetation removal (NVR) report (formerly BIOR) from DELWP.  The characteristics of the \nnative vegetation  Chantelle McLachlan submitted that lot 6 contained a north\u2013south double row of mature \neucalypts. She added:  It is the belief of my family, that these trees were planted in the 1920s by brothers Richard \nand Wally Savage who leased the property from the then owner, Mary Dore.  She added that the NVPP failed to \nmention these trees which are over 100 years old and that if nothing else they should be considered for their \nheritage value.  The VPA advised that it undertook a rapid assessment of properties in response to three \nsubmissions in particular and found that there was no case for considering a request for a row of planted trees to \nbe included in the NVPP because they are non-indigenous to the area.  Jeff Latter, giving evidence on behalf of P \nand P Carney, concluded that there were a number of trees on the Carney property marked for retention that had \nfailed. He stated that the NVPP should be amended to take account of tree failures. In addition, he recommended \nthat Swampy Woodland Patch SW2 marked for retention had been extensively grazed and was of little value. \nHowever, patch SW31 was located in uncredited open space and should be retained, even though it was shown to \nbe removed.  Mr Latter also identified issues with large scattered trees within an urban area. His evidence was:  \nTrees should only be considered for retention when a substantial public exclusion area is provided. Substantial \npublic exclusion area is likely to be a minimum of 1.5 times the tree height of trees to be retained in residential or \nhigh use public areas.  The retention of trees within residential areas will affect the number of lots that will be \ncreated in the future subdivision of the land. This will be due to the need for substantial public exclusion zones and \nthe creation of lots or reserves with an area of greater than 4000m2 for the trees to not be deemed lost.  XWB \nConsulting submitted:  There is no analysis in the NVPP, PSP or elsewhere which weighs up the competing \nobjectives of land for residential development and native vegetation protection, and determines what outcome \nfavours net community benefit and sustainable development as required by Clause 10.01 of the State Planning \nPolicy Framework in relation to integrated decision-making.  Auscare & Earldean submitted that the areas allocated \nin the PSP for conservation and drainage reserves have not been substantiated. Auscare & Earldean \nrecommended that:  The PSP documentation ought to be reviewed for consistency and clarity insofar as it \ndescribes reserves relating to conservation, drainage and waterways. Additionally, the Plan ought to be amended \n\n\n\nto make the relationship between the creek and the drainage reserve clear and to specify where the reserve \ncommences.  Brett Lane in giving evidence on behalf of Auscare & Earldean, informed the Panel that under Clause \n52.16 of the Cardinia Planning Scheme \u2013 Native Vegetation Precinct Plan, a permit does not apply to the removal \nof \u2018planted vegetation\u2019 unless it is planted or managed with public funding for the purpose of land protection or \nenhancing biodiversity unless the removal, destruction or lopping of the native vegetation is in accordance with \nwritten permission of the agency (or its successor) that provided the funding.  Mr Lane observed:  It was readily \nevident that the modified reach of Deep Creek within the property had been revegetated via successive plantings \nover the last few decades or more. This vegetation is designated in the draft NVPP for the Pakenham East PSP as \nVegetation Zone SRW6.  The oldest plantings likely comprised eucalypts only but may have also included \nunderstorey trees and shrubs. It was evident that these larger eucalypts were planted as they were all at a similar \ndistance from the creek channel and many of the trees were not indigenous to the region, such as Blue Gum.  \nAuscare & Earldean submitted DELWP guidelines provide an opportunity for stating that a permit is not required for \nremoval, destruction or lopping of native vegetation that does not qualify as a patch or a scattered tree and to set \nthis out in the NVPP. For this reason, Auscare & Earldean requested that:  The NVPP ought to be revised insofar \nas it applies to the Auscare & Earldean land so that it distinguishes between remnant patches and scattered trees \non the one hand and planted native vegetation on the other. To the extent that the land hosts planted vegetation, \nthe NVPP ought reflect the DELWP Guidance and state that the permit is not required for its removal, destruction or \nlopping.  Council submitted that:  The retention of trees to be retained or removed (subject to approval) is better \nassessed in conjunction with a subdivision design response.  The evidence here is that some trees might be \nexempt, but others will need a permit.  In this area [Deep Creek vicinity in particular], where there is shallow \ngroundwater and inundation, integration of water sensitive urban design into road and drainage design will be \nappropriate and may provide opportunities to assess retention of trees or sedges at the subdivision stage.  Council \nmade reference to the recent Wollert PSP as an example of how trees can be retained within reserves in \nsubdivision design.  The VPA advised the Panel that it had sought clarification from DELWP on whether planted \nnative trees need to be retained and agreed to remove them from the updated NVPP, if it is confirmed they are not \nrequired to be retained. Nonetheless the VPA made clear that it did not support the position put forward by Mr Lane, \nand that whether a tree was planted or not was not a determinant of its biodiversity value. The VPA highlighted the \nexemptions under Clauses 52.17 and 52.16 are different and that only Clause 52.17 was relevant to the \nAmendment.  VPA stated that it remained unsatisfied that that the vegetation on the Auscare & Earldean properties \nwas planted and therefore excluded from the NVPP. It added that the subdivision stage would be the more \nappropriate point at which to make decisions about vegetation retention.  Council suggested that regardless of any \npotential exemptions considered at subsequent stages, the area appears to have been planted for conservation \npurposes and Deep Creek Landcare continues to manage Melbourne Water Programs in the area including weed \ncontrol and fire management, as well as maintenance fencing as required.  The VPA in its Final List of PSP \nChanges includes the following:  Removal of the \u2018conservation area\u2019 designation for native vegetation on Plan 3 \u2013 \nFuture Urban Structure, except where native vegetation is to be retained within credited open space and uncredited \nopen space / drainage. The underlying land use will therefore prevail. Instead the trees will be shown on the \nprecinct features plan and in the NVPP. The NVPP will determine when these are needed to be maintained and \nallows for a permit to be granted to remove them where certain tests are met.  The list also proposed to remove \nFigure 6 - Deep Creek Concept Plan.  The VPA Final Ordinance and NVPP Changes also includes the following \nchange:  Update the NVPP with input from the relevant submitters to determine which trees are still remaining. Also \nseek advice from relevant submitters to provide any conclusive evidence on which trees have been planted to \nbetter inform the NVPP prior to approval. Review Parklea tree survey to provide input in the final NVPP.  The \nnature and location of offsets  Council sought support for locally sourced offsets, relying on the evidence of Lincoln \nKern (Practical Ecology) and requesting mapping from his report to be included in the NVPP. This report identified \n\u201csignificant potential\u201d and potentially suitable habitat for offset purposes within the Cardinia Shire boundaries, \nalthough outside of the UGZ. The report also noted possible barriers to creating offsets given private ownership of \nmost of the identified offset sites and areas throughout the municipality.  Council submitted that  The VPA will agree \nto include changes that clarify the availability of locally sourced offsets from the municipal district, to make it easier \nfor developers to source offsets from suitable landholdings.  Mr Kern\u2019s written evidence was provided to the Panel, \nhowever, on the basis that the VPA confirmed that offset mapping would be part of the final NVPP, the expert \nwitness was not called by Council to present his evidence.  The VPA Final Ordinance and NVPP Changes \nprovisions confirm that the proposed changes are as follows:  Will update the NVPP to meet the updated NVPP \n\n\n\ntemplate subject to changes required by DELWP. Will include an offset statement that identifies offsets will be \ncreated in Cardinia Shire except where not agreed to by the Responsible Authority.  Habitat links  The VPA noted \nthat the majority of the proposed conservation areas are along Deep Creek and the Princes Highway, with a patch \nalso located on Canty Lane which is made up of a group of established trees within a property.  The conservation \nareas shown in PSP Plan 3 - Future Urban Structure are shown in a greater level of detail on plans such as Figure \n6 - Deep Creek Concept Plan with a notation that the extent of this area is to be confirmed.  A number of \nsubmitters, including Vivian Clarke, Gloria O\u2019Connor and Gerard Cunningham, expressed concern with the \nvegetation and habitat loss likely to result from the PSP implementation and the lack of wildlife corridors. Others \nwere concerned with loss of trees along Princes Highway to make room for road duplication and four signalised \nintersections.  Other habitat loss issues raised in submissions included:      a 40 metre wide wildlife corridor linking \nthe two wetlands along the north side of the Princes Freeway for movement of wildlife     a 40 metre wide \nconservation area along the entire length of Hancocks Gully (north and south of Princess Freeway), fenced and \nlocked     replanting of road reserves and a biodiversity corridor linking Deep Creek and Hancocks Gully     a wildlife \ncorridor to connect Deep Creek Conservation Area with the wetland along Princes Freeway, abutting the future \nGovernment School     a 10 metre wide wildlife corridor along the electricity transmission lines linking Deep Creek \nConservation Area, Local Park 01 and Hancocks Gully Conservation Area.  The VPA responded to these \nsubmissions by referring to the report Ecological Investigations for the Pakenham East Precinct January 2018 by \nEcology and Heritage Partners Pty Ltd which contained flora and habitat hectare assessments and targeted flora \nand fauna surveys. The VPA also referenced the NVPP, the objectives of which include establishing additional \nhabitat corridors and stepping stones (patches of native vegetation) along Hancocks Gully, newly created wetlands \nand hilltop reserves.  The VPA noted that for additional wildlife corridors between areas of open space to become \nhabitat areas for wildlife and successful linkages, there needed to be some justification as to which species they are \nfor and how these areas will provide that habitat.  Council viewed the issue of wildlife corridors as unresolved, \nnoting the VPA response regarding justification and that if sufficient justification is provided, Council would suggest \nthat the NVPP be amended to provide greater clarity regarding the relationship between offset and wildlife corridors.  \nLocal groups including Back Creek Land Care Group, Cannibal Creek Land Care Group, and Cardinia Ratepayers \n& Residents Association, made submissions relating to widths of creek vegetation and conservation areas, noting \nthe wetlands in the area could provide potential habitat for fauna including growling grass frog and other species. \nMs Mag noted that ecological considerations as a nice \u2018dual use\u2019 of drainage spaces and schemes and are shown \nconceptually for this reason.  (iv) Discussion  Updating the Native Vegetation Precinct Plan and the characteristics \nof the native vegetation  As with most PSP processes, there has been significant discussion between the VPA, \nCouncil and various submitters regarding the identification of native vegetation within Pakenham East for retention \nand removal.  The Panel was invited by Auscare & Earldean to review the site, particularly in the vicinity of Deep \nCreek, to explore some of the above issues. However, the Panel considered that an accompanied site inspection \nwas not necessary given the specialist expertise needed to undertake such a review and the commitment of the \nVPA to work with submitters and Council in reviewing the NVPP.  Given the status of the NVPP and the review \nrequired to bring it into alignment with the December 2017 Guidelines, it is considered appropriate that the review \nbe completed prior to the finalisation of the Amendment to update the mapping, clarify the status of certain \nvegetation and identify the required offsets.  The Panel notes that there was little discussion on the VPA proposal to \nremove the conservation notation, the RCZ2 and the IPO2 over Deep Creek. These proposed amendments were \nincluded in the Final List of PSP Changes which was circulated to all parties.  The nature and location of offsets  \nThe Panel notes section 8.2 of the Pakenham East Background Report (January 2018) by the VPA stated that the \nNVPP should: clearly describe the type and amount of vegetation loss that must be offset, the type and location of \noffsets to be provided and the timeframe for implementing the offsets.  Given the commitment given by the VPA and \nCouncil to work to review and update the NVPP and the evidence provided by Council to indicate that offsets can \nbe found within the municipality, it is considered appropriate that the offsets should be set out in a revised NVPP, \nprior to finalisation.  Loss of habitat  The Panel was not provided with any evidence or detailed submission of the \ndetailed nature sought by the VPA to justify the inclusion of wildlife corridors or linkages.  Nevertheless, the Panel \nsees merit in the proposal from various local landcare and residents\u2019 groups, and individual community members, \nto look for opportunities for connecting the various green spaces, waterways and conservation areas wherever \npossible. This could be worked out at subdivision stage, and as roadside details are designed, and in more detailed \nplans for the gas easement running north\u2013south through the PSP area as well as the transmission line running \neast\u2013west through the northern area of the PSP.  (v) Conclusion  The Panel concludes:      the NVPP should be \n\n\n\nupdated prior to the finalisation of the Amendment     the update of the NVPP should include a review of the status \nand health of trees to be retained     there is merit in developing habitat links wherever possible and this should be \nconsidered in more detail through the review of the NVPP and at more detailed planning stages including drainage \nassessments, subdivision and permit applications.  (vi) Recommendations  The Panel makes the following \nrecommendations:      Update the Native Vegetation Precinct Plan to:         accord with the changes affected by \nVC138         include a requirement that offsets are to be created in Cardinia Shire to the satisfaction of the \nResponsible Authority and subject to the approval of the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning         \nreview the status and health of trees identified to be retained.  4.5 Bushfire management  (i) The issue  The issue is \nwhether the PSP appropriately prioritises the protection of human life as required in Clause 13.05 of the Cardinia \nPlanning Scheme.  (ii) Background  The VPA informed the Panel that Amendment VC140 was gazetted on 12 \nDecember 2017 seeking to improve the planning system's response to bushfire. Among other things, VC140 \ninserted an updated State Planning Policy Framework at Clause 13 with the intent of making policy for bushfire \nclearer and more directive to enable a resilient response to settlement planning for bushfires. In addition, \nAmendment VC145 which made a number of administrative corrections was gazetted on 28 March 2018 and it \nupdated Clause 13.05. The Panel notes that Clause VC148, implemented in July 2018, renumbered the Clause to \n13.02.  (iii) Evidence and submissions  Mr Allan gave evidence that in accordance with the strategies for settlement \nin Clause 13.05 the key purpose of his report was to identify those parts of Pakenham East where the radiant heat \nflux is not expected to exceed 1.5kW/square metre and therefore where dwellings could be constructed to the BAL-\n12.5 standard. Mr Allan informed the Panel that all of Pakenham East is a designated Bushfire Prone Area, but no \npart is affected by the Bushfire Management Overlay.  Mr Allan stated:  It is likely that as development progresses, \nmuch of the land within the PSP area will become eligible to be excised from the BPA. DELWP review and excise \nareas from the BPA approximately every 6 months, particularly in growth areas where the hazard is removed as \nurban development is completed.  Mr Allen informed the Panel that his report addressed the requirements of \nClause 13.05, Planning Practice Note 64 Local planning for bushfire protection, Planning Advisory Note 68 \nBushfire State Planning Policy Amendment VC140 and Ministerial Direction 11 Strategic assessment of \namendments. Mr Allan added that the landscape in one of a low bushfire risk where the risk can be mitigated to an \nacceptable level and development is appropriate.  With respect to the transmission line easement, Mr Allan\u2019s \nevidence was that it was important to ensure that long grass or other hazardous vegetation does not establish on \nthe land. He said this could be achieved by a section 173 agreement that required the maintenance of the land in a \nlow threat state. Alternatively, it could be achieved by the issue of Municipal Fire Prevention Notices.  Mr Allan \nconcluded:  It is considered that development can appropriately prioritise the protection of human life and meet the \nobjectives of Clause 13.05, largely by ensuring future dwellings will not be exposed to RHF above 12.5kW/square \nmetre, which is commensurate with a BAL-12.5 construction standard. This would require a minimum 33 metre \nsetback of buildings from areas of classified Woodland and a minimum 19m defendable space setback from \nclassified Grassland. 20 metre setbacks are recommended from narrow (less than 20 metre wide) patches of \nvegetation e g along the Princes Highway.  In cross-examination Mr Allan agreed that a perimeter road along the \nnorthern boundary of Pakenham East would be an appropriate treatment.  The VPA submitted that Mr Allan\u2019s \nevidence demonstrated that the development could appropriately prioritise the protection of human life. In practice \nmanagement of the required separation distance is likely to occur through modified road cross-sections within the \nrelevant parts of the PSP.  The VPA recommended amending the UGZ5 to include a requirement for a section 173 \nagreement mandating management for land in the northern electricity easement. In addition, the PSP should \ninclude road cross-sections that respond to the achievement of BAL - 12.5.  The Country Fire Authority (CFA) \nsubmitted:  All residential development must be set back from any bushfire hazard the minimum distance as \nspecified in the recently updated Clause 13.05 (December 2017) of the Cardinia Planning Scheme. This is likely to \nimpact the proposed residential areas located between the north boundary of the PSP area and the electricity \neasement running east to west. CFA recommends that this be added as a new objective under Bushfire, \nBiodiversity & Threatened Species (Page 14).  (iv) Discussion  The Panel accepts the submission of the VPA that \nits role is to satisfy itself that the issue of bushfire management and the protection of human life can be prioritised \nover all other policy considerations. In this regard the Panel accepts Mr Allan\u2019s evidence and his conclusions which \nwere largely unchallenged by the parties.  Both Mr Allan and the CFA agreed that a setback or road along the \nnorthern and eastern boundaries of Pakenham East is an appropriate treatment for this interface. The Panel \nsupports this approach and notes that the VPA in the Final List of PSP Changes has proposed an additional section \non Bushfire Management in the PSP to address this matter. The VPA also proposed an additional requirement in \n\n\n\nthe UGZ 5 for a section 173 agreement to deal with the management of the land in the northern electricity \ntransmission line easement. The Panel agrees with these proposed changes.  (v) Conclusions  The Panel \nconcludes:      the PSP appropriately prioritises the protection of human life as required in Clause 13.05     the \nUGZ5 should be updated to include a section 173 requirement mandating management for land in the northern \nelectricity transmission easement     an additional section on Bushfire management should be introduced into the \nPSP     the changes to the PSP proposed by the VPA are appropriate.  4.6 Acquisition of school sites  (i) The issues  \nThe issue is whether it is appropriate to require the acquisition of a government school site within a specified time \nframe, similar to what applies to non-government schools.  (ii) Background  With respect to non-government \nschools, requirement R31 of the PSP states:  Where the responsible authority is satisfied that land shown as a non-\ngovernment school site is unlikely to be used for a non-government primary school, that land may be used for an \nalternative purpose which is generally, consistent with the surrounding land uses and the provisions of the zone \napplied zone:      in order to satisfy the responsible authority that a site is unlikely to be used for a school, it is \nnecessary to demonstrate that:         the application for an alternative use is not premature having regard to the \nextent of development in the surrounding residential area         the school site is no longer strategically justified \nhaving regard to the provision of schools in the locality, including land not within the Precinct Structure Plan, as \nappropriate         the landowner provides the responsible authority with evidence that:             \u2212 genuine \nnegotiations have been had with a range of educational providers, including the Lead Agency nominated in the \nPrecinct Structure Plan, regarding the use of the site as a school and the sale of the site to the educational \nprovider/s; and             \u2212 the educational provider/s, including the Lead Agency nominated in the Precinct Structure \nPlan, do not intend to purchase the site, and use the site as a school.  (iii) Evidence and submissions  Parklea \nsubmitted that requirement R51 should be amended so that it applied to land shown as a school and therefore \nincluded government schools. In addition, it proposed that the wording be amended so that this requirement could \nbe triggered after 12 months from the completed development of 2,000 homes. It added that the reference to the \nLead Agency nominated in the PSP should be removed.  Lendlease submitted that the location of a government \nprimary school on the periphery of Pakenham East presents challenges in the \u201ctiming of the State Government's \ndecision to deliver the school.\u201d The submission supported the position put by Parklea that requirement R51 should \nequally apply to government schools.  In addition, Lendlease proposed that the early development of community \ninfrastructure such as schools were a benefit to the community. It stated that the Growth Area Infrastructure \nContributions \u2013 Works in Kind (GAIC-WIK) is a \u201cwidely accepted mechanism that streamlines the delivery of key \nstate infrastructure items including government schools.\u201d Lendlease submitted that the PSP should encourage \nGAIC-WIK agreements between landholders and the State Government that will benefit the community. It proposed \nthat PSP section 3.7 Infrastructure Delivery and Staging be amended to explicitly reference the early provision of \ngovernment schools.  The VPA submitted that:  Requirement R51 establishes a rigorous process for ensuring all \nefforts are made to deliver non-government schools as strategically justified through the PSP prior to the land use \nreverting to the underlying applied zone  The VPA added that it strongly opposed the changes proposed by Parklea \nand Lendlease. It argued that the private sector is not under any obligation to provide a school. However, the \ngovernment has an obligation to acquire school sites and make schools available.  The VPA agreed that the \ndesignation of schools prevents the early development of the land. However, there is an expectation that the new \npopulation will create the demand for the schools. The VPA added that it is beyond the scope of the PSP to \nestimate with greater accuracy when infrastructure will be required.  (iv) Discussion  The Panel accepts that there is \na fundamental difference between the provision of schools by the government and non-government sector. The \nState Government has a legislated obligation to provide schools. In the Panel\u2019s view government schools are a \nfundamental component of delivering public infrastructure to meet the needs of future communities in any PSP. In \nmany ways schools are one of the essential building blocks of new communities.  For this reason, the Panel does \nnot accept that it is necessary or prudent to attempt to constrain the time available for the development of a \ngovernment school. In this respect the Panel supports the submission of the VPA which stated:  School sites have \nbeen identified to meet the future requirements of residential growth across the Pakenham East PSP and are \nintended to be acquired by DET, and subsequently developed into schools when local demand warrants their \nacquisition.  The Panel notes that requirement R51 applies where a non-government school site is unlikely to be \nused for a non-government primary school. In the Panel\u2019s view there appears to be some confusion in the \nrequirement which applies to a non-government site but only if used for a primary school. In the Panel\u2019s view the \nwording needs to be clarified by either referencing primary school sites or removing the reference to primary \nschools.  (v) Conclusions  The Panel concludes:      the proposed changes requested to the wording of requirement \n\n\n\nR51 are not appropriate     the wording of R51 should be clarified.  (vi) Recommendations  The Panel makes the \nfollowing recommendation:      Clarify the reference to primary school in requirement R51 of the Pakenham East \nPrecinct Structure Plan.  4.7 Lot 37 Mount Ararat Road South (Blazevic family)  (i) The issues  The issues are:      \nwhether relocation of local park LP-01 is appropriate     should a local access street across Hancocks Gully be \nshown on PSP Plan 7.  (ii) Background  Lot 37 is located on the west side of Mount Ararat Road South.  (iii) \nSubmissions  ERM, on behalf of the owners of lot 37, recommended that the following changes should be made to \nthe exhibited PSP with respect to this property:      provision of a local access street across Hancocks Gully to \nensure the west portion of the land is not land locked     the location of local park LP-11 be entirely within lot 37     \nclarification of requirement R91 with respect to the final design     clarification of the lot size requirements for the \ndevelopment interface with Mt Ararat South Road     notification of any supplementary levy.  ERM added that it \nsupported the findings of the Conclave of Drainage Experts to reduce the width of the Hancocks Gully constructed \nwaterway corridor. This matter is discussed in section 4 above.  The VPA advised that it accepted this submission \nand agreed to changes to the relevant provisions of the PSP.  In response to the Final List of PSP Changes, ERM \nnoted that not all of the agreed changes had been included in the document. ERM provided a response from the \nVPA acknowledging this omission and agreeing to amend requirement R79 to read (changes underlined):  Where a \nlocal access street is determined to be required to cross a waterway, including where shown on Plan 7, the \nproponent must construct local access street culverts to the satisfaction of the responsible authority.  In addition, \nthe response from the VPA agreed to include the following diagram (Figure 7) in the Final List of PSP Changes.  \n2018_9110.png  Figure 7: VPA proposed diagram for inclusion in the Final List of PSP Changes  (iv) Discussion  \nThe Panel notes the VPA has accepted the submission and included some of the agreed changes in the Final List \nof PSP Changes. The Panel accepts that the location of LP-11 in one property is a sensible change and ensuring \nthat the western portion of lot 37 is not \u2018land locked\u2019 because of the drainage reserve will enable development of the \nentire lot. The Panel supports the changes as an appropriate response to the submission.  The changes to \nrequirement R79 are appropriate.  (v) Conclusions  The Panel concludes:      The Final List of PSP Changes should \nbe amended to include the changes to requirement R79 and the addition of Figure 7.  (vi) Recommendations  The \nPanel makes the following recommendations:      Replace requirement R79 with the following:  Where a local \naccess street is determined to be required to cross a waterway, including where shown on Plan 7, the proponent \nmust construct local access street culverts to the satisfaction of the responsible authority.      Amend Plan 3 \u2013 \nFuture Urban Structure of the Pakenham East Precinct Structure Plan by adding a diagram as shown in Figure 7 of \nthis report.  4.8 Slope and topography  (i) The issue  The issue is whether Council\u2019s Guidelines for Slope \nManagement in Subdivisions is an appropriate document for inclusion in the PSP.  (ii) Background  Council had \nprepared its Guidelines for Slope Management, Cardinia Shire Council (December 2017) and expressed concern \nthat the lack of slope management guidelines in the PSP will lead to lot by lot slope treatment rather than a \nsubdivision or subprecinct scale treatment.  (iii) Evidence and submissions  Council recommended inclusion of its \nslope management guidelines as an Incorporated document, to ensure a building envelop plan for subdivision or \nsubprecinct scale planning, rather than site-specific retaining walls as permitted in the amended version of UGZ5 \nand requirement R7 of the PSP. Council submitted that an alternative approach could be to incorporate the \nprinciples of the slope management guidelines in the PSP, under Clause 81.01.  In addition, Council sought a \npermit trigger for earthworks in the UGZ which it submitted was consistent with other PSPs.  Council submitted that \nMr Atkinson, in providing evidence for Parklea, provided \u201cclear support for the Slope Management Guidelines to \nachieve site responsive housing\u201d and noted similar support in the submission by XWB Consulting.  The VPA \nsubmitted that in response to the Council\u2019s submission and other submissions by Lendlease that it proposed a \ncompromise between a performance- based approach and key design criteria set out in R7 which would apply to \nthe subdivision of land with a slope of greater than 10 per cent. The compromise was to require a Slope \nManagement Plan in the UGZ5 which would include a response to the Guidelines for Slope Management in \nSubdivisions \u2013 Pakenham East Precinct Structure Plan. The VPA added:  \u2018Guidelines for Slope Management in \nSubdivisions\u2019 is the key document that guides the PSP\u2019s response to the protection of the ridgeline. It seeks to \nensure that the design response in areas with slope greater than 10% allows for the retention of existing landscape \nand amenity values and creates a built environment that is responsive to these conditions. In the PSP, these are \ngenerally addressed through the requirement within the \u2018Topography\u2019 category which requires a set of performance \nmeasures to be met through a Slope Management Plan.  In the Final Ordinance and NVPP Changes and the Final \nList of PSP Changes, the VPA proposed to insert the Council\u2019s slope management guidelines as a reference \ndocument under Clause 21.03-2 Urban Growth Area of the Cardinia Planning Scheme and to:  ...include additional \n\n\n\nrequirements and guidelines that help to implement some of the key information from the background document \nGuidelines for Slope Management \u2013 Cardinia Shire Council December 2017 if agreed with Council, otherwise \ninclude the document as a reference document.  In response to the Final List of PSP Changes Council requested \nthe addition of the words \u2018for a staggered retaining wall\u2019 in relation to R7 and section 3.1.2 of the PSP so that the \nrequirement would read as:  No more than 2.0 metres in overall height for a staggered retaining wall to avoid \nunreasonable overshadowing of secluded private open space and habitable room windows  (iv) Discussion  In the \nPanel\u2019s view this issue has been resolved by the VPA proposed changes included in the Final List of PSP Changes \nand the Final Ordinance and NVPP Changes. The further change recommended by Council is consistent with the \nprovisions of its Guidelines for Slope Management, Cardinia Shire Council (December 2017).  (v) Conclusions  The \nPanel concludes:      the Guidelines for Slope Management, Cardinia Shire Council (December 2017) is an \nappropriate reference document in Clause 21.03-02     the requirements of requirement R7 should be amended to \ninclude the additional text recommended by Council.  (vi) Recommendations  The Panel makes the following \nrecommendations:      Replace the fifth dot point of the Pakenham East Precinct Structure Plan requirement R7 with \nthe following:  No more than 2.0 metres in overall height for a staggered retaining wall to avoid unreasonable \novershadowing of secluded private open space and habitable room windows.  4.9 Gas pipeline easements  (i) The \nissues  The issues are:      the co-location of the gas pipeline easements within road reserves     whether gas \neasements should be credited open space.  (ii) Background  Various submissions made comment on the utilities \neasements passing through much of Pakenham East in both a north\u2013south and east\u2013west direction. The VPA \nadvised the Panel that gas easements or land such as drainage reserves are not credited as an open space \ncontribution and because it is encumbered, is not available for development.  The VPA also drew the Panel\u2019s \nattention to the APA utilities and gas easement set out in Plan 10 of the PSP and that the resources are considered \nto be of \u201chigh quality\u201d, that is relatively new and high standard with less risk. The VPA and APA have agreed \ntherefore to a reduced notification buffer from 700 metres (as shown on exhibited Plan 10) to 50 metres. This \nfollowed safety design workshops involving various stakeholders, and effectively allows, for example, a child care \ncentre in the town centre without having to refer to APA.  (iii) Evidence and submissions  Parklea submitted that the \nnorth\u2013south gas transmission line easement had the potential to contain part of the north\u2013south section of \nConnector A, integrated into design (refer to section 3.4 and discussion on Connector Road A constructed within \ngas pipeline easement).  XWB Consulting submitted that road reserves should be located within the gas \ntransmission easements and not treated as mutually exclusive infrastructure items resulting in an inefficient urban \ndesign outcome.  The VPA Final List of PSP Changes and the UGZ5 include the reductions to the notification \nbuffer. In addition, the changes include an update to PSP Plan 3 \u2013 Future Urban Structure to separate the gas \neasement and road, in the vicinity of SR-01 to accommodate the submission made by XWB Consulting. The Panel \nconsiders the proposed changes by the VPA to be appropriate.  The VPA proposed to amend the UGZ5 table of \nuses for Section 1 uses so that any nominated use and development must not be on land shown within the \u2018gas \npipeline notification zone\u2019 depicted on Plan 10, replacing the words \u201chigh pressure gas transmission pipeline \nmeasurement length\u201d with \u201cgas pipeline notification zone\u201d and reducing the \u2018gas pipeline notification zone\u2018 from 700 \nmetres to 50 metres  In consultation with APA Networks, the VPA proposed to amend the Schedule to Clause \n66.06 and the UGZ5 to require that works within the 50 metre notification buffer require the endorsement of the \nowner or operator of the gas transmission line.  The VPA also proposes to modify guideline G53 of the PSP to \nclarify that the \u201cconsent of the gas transmission pipeline owner or operator\u201d is required where public land within the \nhigh pressure gas transmission pipeline easement contains shared paths and landscaping.  (iv) Discussion and \nconclusions  The Panel considers that the various matters raised by submitters have been clarified through the \nchanges proposed by the VPA.  (v) Conclusions  The Panel concludes that:      the changes proposed by the VPA \ndealing with gas transmission line easements are appropriate.  4.10 Lot size in interface areas  (i) The issue  The \nissue is whether the changes proposed by the VPA to requirements R13, R14 and R15 of the PSP that deal with \nInterface Housing Areas are appropriate.  (ii) Background  Requirements R13, R14 and R15 of the PSP deal with \nInterface Housing Areas 1 to 3. At the commencement of the Hearing the VPA informed the Panel that it intended \nto remove Interface Housing Area 2 from the exhibited PSP. This proposal is discussed in more detail in section \n4.11 below.  (iii) Submissions  Lendlease and Bauernort submitted that the PSP should provide flexibility for the \nInterface Housing Area rather than stipulating minimum lot sizes. The design response for interface areas should \nbe informed by a range of considerations including:      market need and values     balancing overall site constraints \nwith a well-considered design response and viable outcomes     a design response to site-specific features, views \nand topography     landscaping treatments within the edge road and opportunities within lots     dwelling, building \n\n\n\nareas and fencing designs that reflect an appropriate transition style that can be implemented via design guidelines     \nbalancing overall development viability and site constraints.  Both Lendlease and Bauernort recommended the \ndeletion of requirement R15 with an average lot size of 2,000 square metres particularly in relation to the electricity \ntransmission easement of Interface Housing Area 3.  Council submitted that Interface Housing Areas 1 and 2 in \nPlan 5 should achieve an average lot size of 800 square metres with a minimum 6 metre front setback. Council \nrecommended:      providing wider lot frontages when fronting Ryan Road or Mt Ararat Road North and South     \nproviding sufficient setbacks of dwellings within new lots to allow screen planting along the interface or another \nappropriate design     maintaining a sense of spaciousness between dwellings by providing a minimum side \nboundary setback of 1.0 metre.  Council added that requirement R15 for Interface Housing Area 3 should be \nreworded to include the following:      a building envelope to address the ridgeline (slope) and electricity line \neasement with reference to Cardinia Shire Council Guidelines for Slope Management Guidelines and A Guide to \nLiving with Transmission Line Easements Management in Subdivisions and Ausnet Services A Guide to Living with \nTransmission Line Easements     that the application will achieve an average lot size of 4000 square metres     rural \nfencing that is low scale and visually permeable to facilitate the rural lifestyle character of this area     maximise side \nsetbacks and create openness between the dwellings     a road that provides an interface with Green Wedge (rural) \nland to the north.  Council submitted that it was important for Interface Housing Area 2 to remain within the PSP \nand added that the area could be subject to a separate suite of requirements before land is released. Council \nproposed that this outcome could be achieved by a development plan to coordinate site consolidation, cut and fill \narrangements and subdivision design response.  The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) made a \nsubmission in relation to land at 2 Ryan Road, Pakenham (the site). DHHS informed the Panel that the site is one \nof a number of sites that are currently being considered by DHHS and Ambulance Victoria as a possible location for \na future Ambulance Station. The submission recommended:      renaming Interface Housing Areas 2 to Interface \nArea 2     adding the term residential to describe subdivision in requirement R13     amending R13 and R14 to be \nguidelines     amending guideline G35 to explicitly refer to \u2018Emergency Service Facilities\u2019 and acknowledge the \nimportance of operational needs.  A number of residents, particularly those on the west side of Ryan Road including \nMichael and Raffaelina Scuglia, Jason and Dianne Sartori and the Horkings/Keogh family submitted that the \nminimum lot size on the east side or Ryan Road should be increased to 4,000 square metres. These submissions \nargued that it was appropriate to encourage development that reflected the residential development on the west \nside of Ryan Road.  Jean-Louis and Cleonice Sauze submitted that the smaller lot sizes on the east side of Ryan \nRoad should apply equally to the west side.  The VPA submitted that Plan 5 of the PSP identifies three interface \nareas which are located on the west, north and east fringes of Pakenham East. A number of submissions sought to \nachieve larger lot sizes, particularly around Ryan Road, while other submissions sought more flexibility in smaller \nlot sizes.  The VPA submitted that 800 or 2,000 square metre lots would be inconsistent with the proper utilisation of \nthe resource that is land within the UGB. The VPA added that:  The purpose of interface treatment is not to mimic \nan outcome on the external part of the PSP but is rather to encourage development that sufficiently relates to the \noutcome within the adjacent lower density lots.  In response to submissions the VPA initially proposed to remove \nInterface Housing Area 2 from the PSP. However, following further discussions with the affected land owners, the \nVPA proposed to retain Interface Housing Areas 2 as exhibited and:      combine Interface Housing Areas 1 and 3 \nto become Interface Housing Area 1 and amend the requirements of R13     delete requirement R15     introduce a \nperformance based, design requirement with a minimum 8 metre front setback and 1 metre side setback as a \nsatisfactory methodology to achieve an adequate 'rural style' interface  (iv) Discussion  Pakenham East is bound by \nthe UGB to the north, east and south which effectively defines the limits of metropolitan Melbourne. The south \nboundary of the PSP is defined by the Princes Freeway. The land to the northeast is within a Green Wedge Zone. \nThese interface areas within the PSP mark the transition from urban to non-urban uses. In the Panel\u2019s view, it is \nappropriate that the development of this land recognises this change.  The interface areas are intended to provide a \ntransition from the urban residential development of Pakenham East to the rural areas outside of the UGB. The \ninitial proposal by the VPA was to achieve this by a combination of minimum lot sizes and front setbacks. Ryan \nRoad is different because it interfaces with an existing urban area with a Low Density Residential Zone which \nnevertheless, is a lower density than proposed for the bulk of Pakenham East.  The Panel accepts the submissions \nof Lendlease and Bauernort that interface housing requirements should provide the flexibility for the development \nto respond to design criteria and not be limited by a lot size. In this respect the Panel supports the view of the VPA \nthat the front setback of interface housing should be sufficient to accommodate a canopy tree.  The Panel agrees \nthat the changes proposed by the VPA address most of the concerns expressed in submissions. The Panel \n\n\n\naccepts the view expressed by the VPA that land in Pakenham East is a finite and valuable resource and it is \nparticularly inappropriate to lock that land into lot sizes of 2,000 square metres or larger along the interface with \nRyan Road. In the Panel\u2019s view, design criteria can more effectively ensure that an appropriate transition between \nPakenham East and the surrounding area is created.  In the Panel\u2019s view the interface Housing Area is \nappropriately named and that does not prevent the establishment of an emergency services facility. The Panel \naccepts that the VPA\u2019s amendments to R13 and R14 adequately address the concerns of DHHS and the term \u2018or \nsimilar facility\u2019 provides sufficient flexibility to accommodate an emergency services facility.  (v) Conclusion  The \nPanel concludes:      the changes proposed by the VPA to requirements R13, R 14 and R15 of the PSP as outlined \nin the Final List of PSP Changes are appropriate  4.11 Interface Housing Area 2 (land between Ryan Road and \nDeep Creek)  (i) The issues  The issue is whether Interface Housing Area 2 should be retained in the PSP.  (ii) \nBackground  In its opening submissions the VPA advised the Panel it proposed to remove from the PSP the land \nsouth of the Princes Highway between Ryan Road and Deep Creek and north of Canty Lane, identified as Interface \nHousing Area 2. The VPA submitted that these changes were in response to a number of submissions to the \nexhibited Amendment.  The VPA then wrote to all affected landowners to inform them of this decision (Document \n38). In response the VPA received a letter, signed by all the affected landowners (Document 40), opposing this \ndecision as well as individual letters in response from each landowner. In addition, the landowners provided a \nreport by Andrew Batarilo, Civil Engineer dated 18 June 2018 (Document 39) which concluded:  the site can be \nused for the proposed development with some further engineering required.  (iii) Submissions  In its continued \nsubmission, the VPA informed the Panel that while it initially recommended removal of the area, it was open to \nconsidering the submissions of other parties. It informed the Panel that all of the landowners in Interface Housing \nArea 2 had contacted the VPA and supported the area being part of the PSP.  The VPA advised that:  ... other \nparties have raised issues supporting the inclusion of that land including a petition from the landowners themselves.  \nAs a consequence, the VPA submitted that it reverted to the exhibited position subject to new application \nrequirements in the UGZ5 that require:      an outline development plan is submitted to and approved by the \nresponsible authority     that any permit application demonstrate consistency with the approved outline development \nplan     that a fill and drainage plan be submitted with the outline development plan for the whole area     that any \npermit application demonstrate how it is consistent with the implementation of the fill plan over the whole of the \narea.  The VPA proposed to work with Council to finalise the wording of these additional clauses.  Given that a \nnumber of residents, mainly from the west side of Ryan Road, attending the Hearing were advised of the VPA\u2019s \ninitial proposal to remove Interface Housing Area 2 from the PSP, the Panel requested that the VPA address the \nmatter of further notification of owners to the west of Ryan Road with respect to the amended VPA position in its \nclosing submission. In response the VPA submitted that:  ... these parcels and that as early as the opening hearing \nday the VPA indicated an intention to reconsider and potentially amend its position. The VPA considers that \nnotification of the altered VPA position can be satisfactorily achieved by letter notification of a Final List of PSP \nChanges to the PSP to all submitters and to the persons to the west along Ryan Road, with particular reference \ngiven to the changes on Ryan Road. It is not proposed that this would invite submissions, but rather that it would \nprovide information to these residents.  Council submitted that, for a range of reasons, the area should remain \nwithin the PSP and should be subject to a separate requirement before land is released. Council supported the \nVPA\u2019s view that this area should be developed by one developer and argued that this outcome could be achieved \nby a development plan to coordinate site consolidation, cut and fill arrangements and subdivision design response.  \nAt the conclusion of the Hearing, the Panel directed that the final VPA Final List of PSP Changes be circulated to all \nparties and that all parties were able to respond to matters that they thought were resolved but were not shown as \nresolved on the VPA Final List of PSP Changes.  With respect to Interface Housing Area 2, the Panel received \nresponses from Lois and Denis Walker who argued that the proposed change was not in keeping with the area and \nwould result in different residential densities on either side of Ryan Road. Mr and Mrs Walker submitted that the \nchange would result in additional traffic on Ryan Road where the volumes were already projected to be \nunacceptable.  Jason Satori made similar comments and added that Interface Housing Area 2 would increase the \nnumber of residents in Ryan Road by 25 per cent. The inclusion of this area would increase traffic volumes in Ryan \nRoad and may explain some of the variations in predicted traffic volumes. Mr Satori added that the proposed 800 \nsquare metre blocks do not provide an adequate transition to the low density west and will result in a loss of \namenity for these residents. Mr Satori recommended that the Panel conclude that Interface Area 2 should be \nremoved from the PSP.  Andrew and Suzanne Cleary submitted that the timeframe to comment on the revised \ninclusion of Interface Housing Area 2 was inadequate. Mr and Mrs Cleary submitted that the inclusion of the area \n\n\n\nwould impact on the traffic volume predictions and that the rest of Ryan Road had not been properly considered or \nconsulted.  (iv) Discussion  The Panel accepts that a PSP is an evolving document. Most of the changes to the \nPSP occur either in response to submissions to the exhibited Amendment or those made to the Panel during the \nHearing. The proposed changes to the Interface Housing Areas is one example of this process.  The Panel \nacknowledges that Interface Housing Area 2 in the exhibited Amendment was included in the PSP and that a \nnumber of submissions commented on this matter. The Panel had concerns that some of those submitters who \nattended the opening days of the Hearing, which were held in the Cardinia Shire offices, may have concluded that \nmatter had been addressed by the VPA recommending removal of Interface Housing Area 2. Consequently, the \nPanel provided all parties with the opportunity to comment on the Final List of PSP Changes. The Panel \nacknowledges that the timeframe was relatively short but also observes that no new issues were raised.  \nNevertheless, in reaching its conclusions, the Panel has read each of the submissions made to the Amendment \nand considered those made during the Hearing. The Panel is comforted by the fact that the final VPA Final List of \nPSP Changes was circulated to all parties after the conclusion of the Hearing and that all parties were able to \nrespond to matters that they though were resolved but had a different status on the list.  (v) Conclusions  The Panel \nconcludes:      the inclusion of Interface Area 2 in the PSP, as exhibited, is appropriate subject to the additional \nrequirements outlined by the VPA     the UGZ5 should be amended to include the additional new application \nrequirements for Interface Housing Area 2 as contained in section 2.4 (Ryan Road sub-precinct) of the Panel \nPreferred UGZ5.  4.12 Council requests (where not dealt with elsewhere)  (i) Submissions and discussion  Council \nsubmitted that there were a number of issues made in submissions that it recommended that the Panel needed to \naddress. These matters are listed below and exclude any that have been addressed elsewhere in this report. The \nadditional recommendations sought by Council were:  That Amendment C234 not be approved until such time as \nthe relevant development agency is satisfied that the Infrastructure Contribution Plan will provide for the relevant \nitems described in the PIPs have been provided for in the Infrastructure Contribution Plan.  The ICP is dealt with in \nSection 3.1. The Panel\u2019s role is to assess and make recommendations on the appropriateness of the Amendment. \nThe Panel has assessed the Amendment and recommended approval subject to addressing the matters in the \nrecommendations. The Panel does not support recommending that the approval of the Amendment be subject to \nthe satisfaction of the relevant development agency.  That the standard levy be used to fund standard levy \nallowable items before any supplementary levy allowable items are funded, in accordance with clause 12(c) of the \nRevised ICP Direction.  This is a provision in the ICP Direction and not a matter for the Panel.  That the Precinct \nInfrastructure Plan be amended to show that the following projects listed in the draft Precinct Infrastructure Plan be \ndescribed as supplementary allowable items:      RD-01 (Ryan Road)     IN-05 (Canty Lane roundabout)     BR-01, \nBR-02 and BR-03 (bridges)     PS-01 (Pedestrian signals).  The PIP does not categorise any items as either \nstandard or supplementary. Given the definitions in the ICP Direction the Panel sees little benefit in this \ncategorisation.  That the inclusion of any additional supplementary levy allowable items, including those sought by \nParklea, only be considered where this would not reduce the ICP funding available for community and recreational \ninfrastructure items described in the draft Precinct Infrastructure Plan.  The community and recreation infrastructure \nis subject to a cap and, as discussed in section 3.1, the Minister for Planning can exercise his discretion to \nconsider this matter. It is not the role of the Panel to recommend on how that discretion should be exercised.  That, \nwhere the total standard levy rate is fully allocated to the projects described in the draft Precinct Infrastructure Plan, \nICP funding of any collector roads required due to land fragmentation (or other infrastructure usually delivered by \ndevelopers) only be allowed where the Minister for Planning is prepared to exercise his discretion to grant an \nexemption under clause 29 of the Revised ICP Direction.  It is not the role of the Panel to recommend on how that \ndiscretion should be exercised.  That the VPA assist the Cardinia Shire Council with its request for the Minister for \nPlanning to exercise his discretion to address the shortfall in the community & recreation budget, having regard to \nclause 12 of Annexure A of the Revised Ministerial Direction on Infrastructure Contributions Plans.  This is a matter \nfor the VPA.  That any contribution for the Ferati Holdings, should include an appropriate connection to bridges to \nbe funded in the ICP, having regard to:      the existing liability for development contributions in the Pakenham East \nDCP     current standard rates in the Revised ICP Direction.  The Ferati land is outside of the PSP area and any \ndiscussion of the Pakenham East DCP is a matter for the responsible authority.  Council requests the Minister for \nPlanning does not approve the Precinct Structure Plan until the ICP issues are resolved.  The Panel makes \nrecommendations on the Amendment. Approval of the Amendment is a matter for the Minister not the Panel.  (ii) \nConclusions  The Panel concludes:      no further changes to the Amendment are necessary in response to the \nadditional recommendations sought by Council.  4.13 Offsite impacts  (i) The issue  The issue is whether offsite \n\n\n\nimpacts and integration of the PSP area with surrounding settlements including rural areas to the east have been \nconsidered sufficiently in the Amendment.  (ii) Evidence and submissions  A number of submitters, including Rose \nBiddell, made specific points regarding impacts resulting from the development of Pakenham East on the \nsurrounding areas of Nar Nar Goon, Tynong, Garfield and Bunyip. The issues raised included:      the viability of \ntowns east of the PSP     the inability to consider factors outside the PSP through the PSP process, including \nimpact on and of schools and retail services in other areas such as Nar Nar Goon     the future transition between \nurban Pakenham East and more rural Nar Nar Goon region along eastern boundary     the impacts on use of the \nNar Nar Goon railway station and car park, schools and kindergarten     the lack of paths connecting east towards \nthe Nar Nar Goon township.  The VPA responded that these matters were considered to be out of the scope of the \nPSP. In developing the PSP, the VPA stated that it had planned for a scale and infrastructure provision that would \nservice the new community without impacting negatively on existing areas, particularly in relation to community and \nrecreational facilities, commercial and retail services and education facilities.  The VPA submitted that a viability \nassessment was undertaken for a station to serve the Pakenham East precinct, though a number of land use or rail \noperations concerns remained including modest residential population increase within one kilometre of a proposed \ntrain station, limited further catchment to the east, physical restrictions owing to track curves and grades for station \nlocation, proximity to Pakenham Station and accessibility. On the basis of this assessment a high-frequency bus \nservices was proposed rather than a rail station.  (iii) Discussion  The matters referred to are considered by the \nPanel to be as per the VPA response, generally outside the remit of the Panel in the consideration of the \nAmendment. However, Council may wish to consider the future development of the surrounding townships in any \nfuture revisions or updates to its MSS (and subsequent Municipal Planning Strategy, post VC148), as well as other \nstrategic planning undertaken for the growth area corridors and surrounds.  (iv) Conclusions  The Panel \nconcludes:      impacts on localities outside the PSP are valid concerns for the community and should be addressed \nthrough Council strategic planning processes, over and above this specific PSP and Amendment.  4.14 Local \nTown Centre and Local Convenience Centre  (i) The issues  The issues are:      whether the soft cap for the LCC is \nappropriate     whether the changes proposed to the LTC are appropriate  (ii) Background  The PSP sets aside land \nto be developed for two centres within Pakenham East:      a LTC situated south of Princes Highway and west of \nHancocks Gully, positioned to serve the PSP as a whole     a LCC situated on the northern side of the proposed \nextension to Canty Lane, which would become a new connector boulevard through the southern part of the PSP, \nand opposite a proposed government primary school.  The LTC is proposed to provide for 9,100 square metres of \nshop floorspace and is expected to provide retail, services, lifestyle, leisure and commercial needs for the \nsurrounding residential catchment.  The concept plan for the LTC (PSP Figure 2) indicates one large anchor retail \nuse, presumably indicating a supermarket and a smaller one that could accommodate a smaller-format \nsupermarket or a mini-major retail tenant. The background economic report Pakenham East Precinct Structure Plan \n\u2013 Economic Assessment report November 2015 by Tim Nott recommends that the LTC provide for one full-line \nsupermarket and one small or mid-sized supermarket.  (iii) Evidence and submissions  Local Convenience Centre  \nMr Lee\u2019s evidence was that:  The proposed centre hierarchy is a sensible response to deliver retail and other \nservices to residents within the Pakenham East PSP.  He concluded that the designation of the centre near Canty \nLane may downplay its significance in providing a service to new residents, particularly in the early stages of the \ndevelopment of Pakenham East. He recommended elevating the designation of the centre to a small LTC which \nwould be consistent with other PSPs.  The VPA advised the Panel that it accepted Mr Lee\u2019s analysis but not his \nconclusions and added:  The VPA accepts that the level of supportable floor space identified by Mr Lee although it \nis lower than the level identified in the background reports. The VPA would support the amendment of the soft cap \nin the UGZ to reflect a figure of 3500 square metres, which would therefore trigger the requirement of planning \npermit for retail floor space beyond this amount.  Local Town Centre  In response to the Final List of PSP Changes \nParklea responded:  Parklea also acknowledges that the VPA has agreed to update the Town Centre Concept Plan \nproposed at Figure 2 of the PSP, to reflect outcomes agreed at the workshop between the VPA, Cardinia Shire \nCouncil (Council) and Parklea on 16 May 2018.  It is Parklea's submission that there was agreement between \nParklea and the VPA to replace the Town Centre Concept Plan proposed at Figure 2 of the PSP with the Town \nCentre Concept Plan prepared by Mesh Planning, set out at Annexure A to this submission.  In response to the \nFinal List of PSP Changes Council acknowledged the VPA will update the town centre concept plan. Council \nsubmitted that this statement was based on the meeting held on the 22 May 2018 held between the VPA, Parklea, \nMesh Planning and Council.  Council argued that the meeting minutes identified a concept plan would be \ndeveloped by VPA for all to review, test and provide comments back to the VPA prior to the plan being updated in \n\n\n\nthe PSP.  The VPA responded that it did not consider that there was any significant issue about the changes to be \nincorporated into the town centre. The VPA acknowledged it will continue to finalise the town centre in consultation \nwith Parklea and Council. It submitted that it needs to:  ...consult with TfV on the intersection design and locations \nas part of the town centre, and urban designer to ensure there remains consistency with key principles that are \nincorporated into all town centres.  In response to the Parklea submission the VPA noted that the plan is not \nbinding and there was ample opportunity to submit on the initial tabled list of changes (Document 8) which agreed \nto incorporate the agreed principles from the workshop. The VPA added:  On this basis Parklea\u2019s request for a \nfurther Direction Hearing on this matter should be disregarded.  (iv) Discussion  The Panel accepts Mr Lee\u2019s \nevidence with respect to the supportable floorspace for the LCC. The influence this has on the Panel\u2019s view of the \nFUS is dealt with in section 3.3 above. The Panel agrees that the LCC will perform an important function for the \nresidents of Pakenham East in the early stages of its development. As Pakenham East develops the LCC will face \nincreasing competition from the LTC as well as other centres in the Growth Corridor. For this reason the Panel \nagrees with the VPA, that a reduction in the soft cap for the LCC is appropriate. The Panel acknowledges that the \nsoft cap triggers a permit application if it is exceeded which would allow an applicant to justify an increase in \nfloorspace, if required.  The Panel notes that the List of Final PSP Changes includes the following change with \nrespect to the LTC:  Continue to work with Parklea and Council to provide a finalised local town centre plan that \nincorporates the agreed changes at the workshop held 16 May 2017  In the Panel\u2019s view this change represents \nthe improvement and evolution of the text in the list of changes (Document 8) submitted to the Panel on 30 May \n2018 which refers to the workshop held on 16 May 2018. The finalisation of the LTC plan is an ongoing matter. \nCouncil in its submission confirmed that it had not signed off on the plan. The Panel agrees with the VPA \nsubmission that the plan is indicative and not binding and that Parklea had ample opportunity to submit on the \nmatter. If anything, the text referred to above, which commits the VPA to working with Council and Parklea, \nprovides more flexibility than the changes detailed in Document 8 on 30 May 2018.  (v) Conclusions  The Panel \nconcludes:      the soft cap for the LCC should be amended to 3,500 square metres     the proposed changes in the \nList of PSP Changes with respect to the LTC are appropriate     the UGZ5 should be amended to reduce the LCC \nfloor area from 4,100 to 3,500 square metres.  (vi) Recommendations  The Panel makes the following \nrecommendations:      Amend Table 4 of the Pakenham East Precinct Structure Plan to reduce the shop floorspace \nof the Local Convenience Centre from 4,100 square metres to 3,500 square metres.     Amend the reference in the \nPakenham East Precinct Structure Plan requirements R22 and R33 from 4,100 square metres to 3,500 square \nmetres.     Replace the Urban Growth Zone Schedule 5 with the Panel Preferred version shown in Appendix D.  \nAppendix A Submitters to the Amendment No.      Submitter 1      Don & Kath Jackson 2      AusNet Transmission \nGroup 3      Joanna & Mathew Dipnall 4      Tina De Pietro 5      Jean-Louis & Cleonice Sauze 6      South East \nWater 7      Amanda Adshead 8      Don & Kath Jackson 9      Katrina Chatfield 10      Diocese of Sale Catholic \nEducation Limited 11      Bessie Creek/Ararat Creek Landcare Group 12      Christopher McAleer 13      Damon \nLand Pty Ltd c/o Parklea 14      Ante Krstulovie 15      Cardinia Branch Victorian Farmers Federation 16      EPA \nVictoria 17      Cannibal Creek Landcare Group 18      Blazevic family 19      John & Katrina Twist 20      Andrew & \nSuzanne Cleary 21      Earldean Pty Ltd & Auscare Commercial Pty Ltd 22      Back Creek Landcare Group 23      \nDaniel Haynes 24      Toomuc Landcare 25      Nar Goon Progress Association 26      Chantelle McLachlan 27      \nDennis & Lois Walker 28      Paul & Penny Carney c/o XWB Consulting 29      DELWP (Forest, Fire and Regions) \n30      Geoff Leed 31      Elise Sefton 32      APA Networks 33      Rose Biddell 34      Geoff Bramley 35      Gael \nFairweather 36      Azemi Land C/o Plans In Motion (PIM) 37      Department of Education and Training 38      \nPatrick & Jennifer Canty 39      Deep Creek Landcare Group 40      Danielle LeGassick 41      David Young 42      \nJames Naylor 43      Jane Kopecek 44      Lendlease c/o Niche Planning 45      Bauernort c/o Niche Planning 46      \nJoanne Parker 47      Jamie (surname not provided) 48      Aboriginal Victoria 49      Laurack P/L 50      Parklea \nDevelopments 51      Cheryl Edyvane 52      Transport for Victoria 53      Ronald Pearson 54      Bill & Genevieve \nShallard 55      Michael & Raffaelina Scuglia 56      Jason & Dianne Sartori (+ others) 57      Rita & Frank (surname \nnot provided) 58      John & Lourdes Rodda 59      Horkings/Keogh family 60      Graeme & Janice Stokie 61      \nRonald Pearson 62      Adrian & Elizabeth Wood 63      Emmanuel & Maureen Camilleri 64      Paul & Tanya \nHughes 65      Michelle Porobic 66      Bradley, Debra & Lucas Holland 67      SR Holdings Investment Group Pty \nLtd c/o Taylors Development 68      Cardinia Ratepayers & Residents Association 69      Melbourne Water 70      \nCountry Fire Authority 71      Cardinia Shire Council 72      DEDJTR 73      Health and Community services 74      \nIan and Helen Howe 75      Jean-Louis & Cleonice Sauze  Appendix B Parties to the Panel Hearing Submitter      \nRepresented by Victorian Planning Authority      Mr Greg Tobin of Harwood Andrews who called the following \n\n\n\nexpert witnesses:      -
