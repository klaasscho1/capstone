It now takes more pesos to buy \ndollars. That may be a factor.''\n\nThrough June, 171,559 aliens have been arrested in the Chula Vista Sector, which includes San Diego. The arrests \nare down by 28,212, or 14 percent, from the same period last year, and officials said it could mean fewer illegal \naliens were trying to sneak into the United States. A comparable decline has been noted along the Texas border.\n\nBut Mr. Wood cautioned the figures might not reflect a trend.''The decline is fairly recent, and may be a fluke,'' he \nsaid.\n"}
