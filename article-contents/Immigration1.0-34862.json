{"title": "NOTES ON PEOPLE;A Brand-New 99-Year-Old Nephew for Uncle Sam", "body": "\nHe knows only four English phrases and can name only three American Presidents, and that, said the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service, meant that Gabriel Isahar Isaharov could not become an American citizen.\n\nBut Mr. Isaharov, a 99-year-old Russian immigrant who had dreamed of coming to the United States for 65 years \nand finally made it in 1975, is not one to give up.\nGabriel Isahar Isaharov, 99-year old Russian immigrant, is granted US citizenship after being exempted from \nliteracy requirements\n\nSo yesterday, aided by an interpreter, he pleaded his case in United States District Court in Brooklyn, arguing that \nhe should be exempted from the literacy requirement because of his advanced age.\n\nUnfortunately, argued Howard Baum, a Government lawyer, the law makes no such provision.  In this case, ruled \nJudge Henry Bramwell, it does.\n\n''Thank you very much and God bless America,'' said Mr. Isaharov, who was promptly sworn in as a citizen.\n\nAnd why had Mr. Isaharov been so determined to become a citizen?  ''Because I was born free,'' he said, ''and I \nwant to die free as a citizen of this great country.''\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nIllustrations: photo of Gabriel Isahar Isahaov\n"}
