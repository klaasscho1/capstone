{"title": "To be exiled from home no longer", "body": "\nRegarding the Jan. 9 editorial \"Ending immigration cruelty\":\n\nThe proposed policy change that would allow unauthorized immigrants whose spouses or children are U.S. citizens \nto stay in the United States while waiting for decisions on their extreme-hardship waivers would also benefit \nAmerican citizens. They would no longer have to exile themselves from their country to keep their families \ntogether.\n\nI recently met a 10-year-old U.S.-born boy who had returned to this country after spending a year in Mexico with his \nMexican father, who was waiting for his waiver to be approved. This boy, whose mother is an American, was as \nglad to be back in his own country as any other U.S. citizen would be. \n\nThis policy change would not coddle illegal immigrants; it would provide humanity and justice to Americans.\n\nRoger Algase, New York\n\nThe writer is an immigration lawyer.\n"}
