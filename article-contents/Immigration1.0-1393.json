{"title": "On Multi-Cultural Education", "body": "\nThe positive spin of your Feb. 11 article, \"Multi-Cultural Education: Immersion Lesson for Students,\" disguises \nsome very troubling aspects of this movement. For starters, solicitude for immigrant or minority students is nowhere \nnear as new as the article implies. It was present during the last major wave of massive immigration in the early \n20th century, while teaching various perspectives has a long tradition in American education.\n\nThe multi-culturalist proponents tout the importance of learning of differing points of view. No problem there. The \ndanger lies in pretending that all points of view are of equal significance or validity. In particular, the multi-\nculturalists suppress or deny the reality of an American point of view. Their programs presume only a variety of \nperspectives determined by group identity. Consequently, the reality of the American experience, which heretofore \nhas assimilated immigrant populations and Americanized them -- with recognition for variation in degree -- is \nrejected. It is precisely this type of \"group-think\" which has led to the implementation of the ethno-racial quota \nsystem so despised by the majority of Americans.\n\nMost strikingly, none of the various educational and multi-culturalist \"experts\" cited in the article demonstrates any \nconcern to inculcate American history and heritage in immigrant children in order to aid in their assimilation of \nAmerican culture. On the contrary, the multi-culturalist approach encourages immigrants to maintain their foreign \ntraditions rather than adopting to American norms. The local multi-culturalists, and their many allies nationwide, \nhave flipped the traditional assumption that immigrants should adjust to the American condition. In its place they \npropose, implicitly or explicitly, that Americans adjust to them -- a prescription for national suicide unique in world \nhistory.\n\nTotally missing from the quoted statements of Long Island's multi-culturalist advocates, and this seems standard \nwith such people, is any comprehension that such a thing as American culture, or nationhood, exists. The so-called \n\"celebration of diversity\" typically results in a stifling or diminution of the American heritage. The different programs, \nincreasingly mandated, which emphasize multi-cultural/minority interests, reduce or exclude the historical/cultural \nheritage of the majority of American citizens and their children. This is the surest way to generate the resentments \nwhich the multi-culturalist programs purportedly diminish.\n\n \n\nRICHARD F. WELCH\n\nWoodbury\n"}
