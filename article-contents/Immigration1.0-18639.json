The official edition of the 2018 Digest is available exclusively on the Department of State website \nat: https://www.state.gov/digest-of-united-states-practice-in-international-law/. Past Digests covering 1989 through \n2017 are also available online.\n\nThe Digest traces its history back to an 1877 treatise by John Cadwalader, which was followed by multi-volume \nencyclopedias covering selected areas of international law. The Digest later came to be known to many as \n\"Whiteman's\" after Marjorie Whiteman, the editor from 1963-1971. Beginning in 1973, the Office of the Legal \nAdviser published the Digest on an annual basis, changing its focus to developments current to the year. Although \npublication was temporarily suspended after 1988, the Office of the Legal Adviser resumed publication in 2000 and \nhas since produced volumes covering 1989 through 2018.
