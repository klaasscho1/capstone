{"title": "Storm Aftermath: Live Updates", "body": "\nOn Monday morning, commuters returned to work on the city's buses and trains, which were operating on normal \nor modified schedules, and the majority of students were able to return to classrooms.  \n\nOver the weekend, hundreds of would-be marathon runners wearing numbers ran to the cheers of crowds in \nCentral Park and others went to Staten Island and other storm-ravaged areas to help. \n\nPower began to return to the Rockaways, one of the hardest-hit areas, and Manhattan had most of its power back. \nBut much of the region remained without power or heat as the temperature plunged overnight, gas remained scarce \n-- and rationed in New Jersey. And tempers in many places were short. \n\nTracking the storm that has disrupted power and transportation for millions of people in more than a half-dozen \nstates, leaving behind the daunting task of cleaning up.  \n\n 4:26 P.M. | City Approves $85 Million in Emergency Storm Contracts \n\nThe city has approved $85.4 million in emergency contracts to repair damage caused by the storm and buy \nequipment to respond to the disaster, according to the office of City Comptroller John C.Liu. \n\nThe contracts include $30.3 million in work on the city's beaches and money for all manner of equipment -   \nlaptops, sandbags, oxygen, new pumps at sewage treatment plants, \n\nA spokesman for Mr. Liu said the largest contracts had been approved for the parks department, the Department of \nEnvironmental Protection, the Sanitation Department and the Department of Design and Construction.\n\nThe comptroller's office approved  $30,362,965 in parks department contracts to repair damages to various \nbeaches, including Rockaway, Manhattan Beach, Coney Island and along Shore Parkway.\n\nFor the Department of Environmental Protection, $15 million in contracts were approved for pumping equipment \nand work at sewage treatment plants and satellite phones, while the $14 million in Sanitation Department contracts \nwas for heavy equipment and for workers to augment the agency and provide replacement disposal capacity, the \nspokesman said.\n\nThe spokesman said  $12 million in contracts for the Department of Design and Construction was for heavy \nequipment and construction-related services.\n\n\n- William K. Rashbaum \n\n 4:11 P.M. | Signs of Progress in the Financial District  \n\nAt lunchtime along Wall Street on Monday, tourists far outnumbered office workers looking for lunch, but some \nwandered in and out of the boutiques.\n\nThere were signs of progress. The Battery Park Underpass, completely flooded for days after the storm, with a \nsubmerged City Department of Transportation dump truck stuck at the entrance to the westbound lanes, was clear \nand a police officer guarding it said it would be open in a few days.\n\nThe Caf\u00e9 Water, a deli on the corner of Cedar and Water Streets, was getting ready to open, perhaps on Tuesday, \nthe owner said.\n\nBut other businesses faced obstacles. The historic Fraunces Tavern, at the corner of Pearl and Broad Streets, \nwhere George Washington gave his farewell address to officers of the Continental Army, was struggling.\n\n\"If we don't get power, we're in trouble,\" said one of the owners, Eddie Travers, who said he was struggling with the \ncity's Buildings Department to get the power turned on and trying to hold onto his staff.\n\nMinas Polychronakis, a 72-year-old Greek immigrant who runs a shoe repair business at 67 Wall Street, just 40 or \nso yards from where the waters of the East River stopped in their storm-surge-fueled travels up Wall Street, sat \nbehind the counter in his empty shop early Monday morning. \n\nMr. Polychronakis, who has been repairing shoes since 1954, first in Crete and then, after coming to the United \nStates in 1969, in New York, was philosophical. He is no stranger to disaster and loss and the lack of something \nthat has in recent years come to be called \"business continuity.\" He had a shop on the concourse below the World \nTrade Center for 25 years until the attacks in 2001.\n\n\"They say in life we do the best we can,\" he said. \"We start today. I hope we do O.K. It depends on how many \npeople come to work.\"\n\nThis is the busy season in his business, he said. \"Boots,\" he explained. The season in which people get ready for \ncold weather is the shoemaker's friend.\n\nAs for government assistance, he was more cynical. \n\n\"The money goes to the big guys, and who pays the price?\" he asked, his eyebrows rising to answer his own \nquestion.\n\nBut he still has hopes and ambitions.\n\n\"In a year and a half, my lease expires,\" he said. \"I hope by then the trade center is open and I open my store again \nand retire.\"\n\n- William K.

Bloomberg, speaking at a public school in Brooklyn, P.S. 195., said on Monday that school \nattendance throughout the city for the day was about 86 percent, about the same as one year ago.\n\nHe also said that about 94 percent of the city's schools were open and he expected both attendance and the \nnumber of open schools to be higher when classes resumed again on Wednesday, after they close Tuesday for \nElection Day.\n\n\"It was a relatively successful first day,\" Mr. Bloomberg told reporters.\n\nMr. Bloomberg said that most of the 16 schools used as shelters should be ready to accommodate their students on \nWednesday, by moving people elsewhere or separating evacuees from students. Forty-eight buildings were \nstructurally damaged, and 19 schools are without power.\n\nDennis M. Walcott, the New York City schools chancellor, said the city was continuing to work on its schools, and \nthere were 7,400 buses helping students get to their classes. Students were given MetroCards to help those in \nshelters with their transportation needs, the mayor said.\n\nIn a news briefing, the mayor and other city officials also discussed the latest efforts in the recovery.\n\nAbout 115,000 people remained without power in total in the city, he added.\n\nAs for the longterm need for housing, Mr. Bloomberg said more than half of the people who need emergency \nhousing were in city public housing, and most of that housing should have electricity restored this week, perhaps in \ntwo days, with about two-thirds of the residences with heat and hot water a few days later, with more next week.\n\nHe said a worst-case prediction for those who might need temporary housing was 40,000 people, with 20,000 of \nthem from New York City Housing Authority units, but he called that a \"guesstimate,\" with better numbers to come \nafter a survey.\n\nIn public housing, 114 buildings with 21,000 residents still do not have power, and 174 buildings lack heat and hot \nwater.\n\nAs for longer term housing, Mr. Bloomberg announced the appointment of an employee who had also helped the \ncity get back on its feet after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nMr. Bloomberg said many problems were on their way to being solved, and \"those who have much more serious \nneeds, we are not going to walk away from you.\"\n\nDozens of polling places are being moved as well. Asked whether he was confident that people could get to the \nsubstitute polling places, Mr. Bloomberg said: \"I think they can. The question is will they make the effort?\"\n\nHe also said that 21 million gallons of gasoline was unloaded this weekend but it would take time for it to reach gas \nstations. Lines at the pump probably will remain long, he added, saying the city was asking motorists to be patient \nand to use mass transit as long as they can. In the city, the temporary allowance of  multiple passenger and street \npickups by taxis and livery cabs was suspended as of midnight, he added.\n\n- Christine Hauser \n\n 3:37 P.M. | Moratorium on Foreclosures Ordered in Storm-Hit Areas \n\n\n\nThe federal housing secretary directed all mortgage lenders that work with the Federal Housing Administration on \nMonday to stop any foreclosure action for 90 days on any homeowners in the region hit by the storm.\n\n \"We don't want families to be victims twice, once by disaster and once by foreclosure,\" said the secretary, Shaun \nDonovan. HUD had previously announced more limited foreclosure relief for homeowners in the storm area.\n\n- Eric Lipton \n\n 2:48 P.M. | MTV Special to Raise Money to Rebuild 'Jersey Shore' Hometown \n\nTheir house was spared, but much of their stamping grounds, including their beloved Seaside Heights Boardwalk, \nwere not.

The storm, coming in the wake of \nHurricane Sandy, could cause more power failures and minor to moderate flooding along the coastal areas \ndevastated last week, said David Stark, a meteorologist with the Weather Service.\n\nMr. Stark said tidal surges of two and a half feet to four and a half feet at the peak of high tide on Wednesday night \ncould play unpredictably  along the southern shores of Long Island and western Long Island Sound, coastal \nlandscapes altered by last week's storm.\n\n\"Some of the dunes are gone,\" he said, \"so there is some definite uncertainty there on what the impacts will be with \na moderate coastal storm surge.\" \n\nTemperatures along the coast are expected to dip into the high 30s on Wednesday night and climb into the 40s by \nThursday morning and into the 50s later in the day. The storm system is expected to move out by Thursday \nafternoon.\n\nhttp://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2012/HUDNo.12-168\nhttp://remotecontrol.mtv.com/2012/11/02/jersey-shore-seaside-heights-house-hurricane-sandy/\n\nInland areas in the lower Hudson Valley, northeastern New Jersey and southwestern Connecticut could get a mix of \nsleet and snow on Wednesday morning, changing to rain later in the morning.\n\nThe Northeaster and its damage are not expected to approach the hurricane's devastation. But given the damage \nlast week to homes, businesses, coastlines, the electric grid and the spirits of people without power for a week, a \nsecond storm seems certain to compound the damage from the first one.\n\n- Peter Applebome \n\n 2:12 P.M. | U.S. Transportation Dept. to Provide 350 Buses in New Jersey \n\nThe federal Department of Transportation plans to provide 350 buses to help ease what has been a difficult return \nto work for New Jersey commuters. As many people returned to work on Monday for the first time since Hurricane \nSandy, many of the usual commuting routes were still shut down, or overwhelmed. \n\nNew Jersey Transit normally runs 63 trains in and out of New York City during the morning peak hours; on Monday \nit was able to run just 13. New Jersey Transit had added train cars to lines that were running, and began running \nemergency buses between northern New Jersey and Manhattan on Monday to make up for lost service, but trains \nwere crowded anyway. The New Jersey Coast Line and trains from Woodbridge had to be shut down in the middle \nof the morning rush because so many commuters crowded the trains and platforms. Gov. Chris Christie said the \nbuses provided by the federal government could accommodate half of the usual number of cross-Hudson \ncommuters.\n\nTrains in northern New Jersey were expected to remain out of service for several weeks, after sustaining extensive \ndamage during the storm.\n\nThe buses were arranged through private contractors, and the first 70 will arrive today, according to the office of \nSenator Frank Lautenberg, with the rest to follow later in the week.\n\n- Kate Zernike \n\n 1:55 P.M. | Still Housing Evacuees, an S.I. School Isn't Ready for Students \n\nEven as most New York City public schools reopened on Monday for the first time since Hurricane Sandy struck \nthe region, some schools were not ready for students because they were still serving as shelters.\n\nSusan E. Wagner High School on hard-hit Staten Island is one of those schools.\n\nJeff Pedersen, facility manager for the evacuee shelter that was set up at the school, said on Monday that some \npeople were still arriving at the shelter, even as more left. The shelter had about 190 people on Monday, down from \n250 Sunday night.\n\n\"For every two that come in, three leave,\" he said. \"As the coastal areas are inspected and more residences are \ncondemned, those families come to us. But then more people are finding places to stay with relatives, or a hotel \nroom, or they get a FEMA stipend for temporary housing.\"\n\nMr. Pedersen said he didn't know what the plan was for students returning to the school. \"Right now it's unclear,\" \nhe said. \"Our options are either to move the students to another school site, or have school here on a half-day \nbasis, or bring them all day but with modified lunch.\"\n\nHe said modified lunch was when students would be served cold, ready-to-eat food somewhere other than the \ncafeteria.\n\n- Christopher Maag \n\n 01:22 P.M. | Halloween 2012: One Trick Is Just Sorting Out When It Is \n\n\n\nNever mind that it's November, that Christmas decorations went up at malls across the country last week.

(\"No need to decorate your car,\" Brick's mayor, Stephen C. Acropolis, said.) \n\nSome towns that are allowing Halloween to go forward today have recommended it not go late - ending at dusk in \nOradell and 8 p.m. in Wanaque.\n\nAnd in towns that do plan to have Halloween as revised, parents and treat-givers were confused on how to comply \nwith the executive order, which declared Halloween between the hours of noon and 5 p.m. - starting just as many \ntrick or treaters head out in a typical year. \n\nAll this led some people to wonder whether this was worth the fuss.\n\nA Twitter message from The Star-Ledger asking whether Halloween should be canceled got a range of opinions. \nSome argued to move on.\n\n@njdotcom halloween is still delayed for many towns and will be celebrated this weekend. it's honestly not priority \nand should be cancelled\n\n- stella (@stelladorocooki)            November 5, 2012\n\nOthers said doing so would make things only harder for children already suffering from cabin fever after a week \nhome from school and other activities.\n\n@njdotcom nah, the kids need it. mine have been really really looking forward to it, esp. since we still have no \npower.\n\n- Ambrose Little (@ambroselittle)            November 5, 2012\n\n- Kate Zernike \n\n 1:15 P.M. | U.S. Fund for Unicef Continues Work Despite Flooded Office Building \n\nThe United States Fund for Unicef which has not been able to return to its offices at 125 Maiden Lane in Lower \nManhattan due to flooding at the building, said it had continued to function in space it has uptown for just such \nemergencies.\n\nhttp://t.co/MpOmtvnz\n\nThe group, which supports Unicef's work to help vulnerable children around the world, put in motion a business \ncontinuity plan.

The quake did not appear to have ruptured any gas lines but crews from PSE&G were checking the area, \nsaid the utility's president, Ralph LaRossa.\n\nThe storm, which is scheduled to hit the region on Wednesday, posed a bigger threat to the work in progress to \nrestore about 375,000 PSE&G customers still without power, Mr. LaRossa said.  If the storm packs winds up to 55 \nmiles per hour as forecast, he said, it could knock down more overhead wires and halt the restoration effort.\n\n\"When it rains, it certainly does pour,\" Mr. LaRossa said. \"Our organization has been stretched this week like it \nnever has in the past.\"\n\nHe said the company had about 3,000 workers from out of state helping to clear trees and branches and replace \npoles, wires and transformers. The company is still seeking reinforcements including about 120 line workers from \nWest Virginia who were en route to New Jersey on Monday morning, he said.\n\nThe crews would continue working through a rainstorm, but would have to stop using bucket trucks to reach wires \nonce winds get to 40 miles per hour, he said. Winds that strong could send dangling branches down onto wires that \nhave just been repaired or replaced, he said.\n\n\"Many of the repairs that we've made to the system will be challenged,\" Mr. LaRossa said.\n\nHe said the company still hoped to have power back on for almost all of its customers by the end of the week, but \nhe added that the work was going particularly slowly in Montclair, South Orange and Maplewood in Essex County \nbecause many of the wires in those town run through backyards. Crews cannot get trucks into those backyards, so \nthey must carry poles and wire into the yards, he said.\n\n\n\n'There will be pockets of that that I think will go into this weekend,\" Mr. LaRossa said.\n\n- Patrick McGeehan \n\n 11:46 A.M. | BoltBus and Megabus Restore Full Service \n\nIntercity bus operators BoltBus and Megabus, which offer low-cost fares to passengers between Washington, New \nYork and Boston, have restored full service along the heavily traveled Northeast corridor, spokesmen for both \ncompanies said Monday.

Then throw in one vicious storm \nthat blacked out 42 Broadway, the board's command and nerve center, and has thrown the setup of polling sites \ninto chaos.\n\nEven as she spoke on Sunday, the phone lines were still down, as was the voter hotline, and the office's main \ncomputer system, which holds voter lists, polling site information and other vital data. A technology team had been \nworking since Tuesday to try to repair it.\n\nOffice communications have been shifted to staff members' cellphones and personal e-mails, and many staff \nmembers have been sent to other borough offices, including Queens, where a backup server offers limited access: \nworkers can see information, but cannot work with it and or make changes in the system.\n\nStaten Island, for all its devastation, did not pose huge difficulties, Ms. Sandow said, because few sites had to be \nchanged. Same for the Bronx, although a tented location was set up in the Locust Point section, near the base of \nthe Throgs Neck Bridge.\n\nBut there were dozens of sites to be relocated in waterfront areas of Brooklyn and Queens, particularly the \nRockaways, with its major devastation and widespread power losses. Regarding the ruined polling sites for Breezy \nPoint and nearby areas, officials considered setting up a tented voting site at the Aqueduct Racetrack, but this was \nultimately rejected, Ms. Sandow said, partly because of the difficulty in getting voters to travel there.\n\nhttp://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/05/how-n-y-u-stayed-partly-warm-and-lighted/\n\n\n\"If people didn't leave their house in a storm, do you think they are going to get on a shuttle bus to vote?\" she said. \n\"Our concern is that we service everybody.

And stop it did, even though by the time it left Great \nNeck, the fourth on the list, the train's ten cars were already packed to the gills.\n\nAs the train approached each remaining station, knots of hopeful commuters would crowd around, and at first, one \nor two intrepid souls might even manage to shove their way aboard. But soon the people already jammed into the \ntrain were calling out pre-emptively as soon as the doors opened that there was no more room for anyone, \nprompting a mixture of slumped shoulders and dirty looks from the disappointed and frustrated. The train's \nconductor tried announcing on the train's P.A. system that another would be along in 20 or 25 minutes, but her \nvoice did not carry far out onto the platform, and it was anyway small consolation: if a train due in to Penn Station \nbefore 8 o'clock was like this, what would the next train be like?\n\n\"We're leaving a trail of broken hearts,\" one man in the first car said wryly.\n\nWhen the train reached the Murray Hill station in Queens, whose platforms are only four cars long, the conductor's \nusual announcement - \"Passengers in the rear of the train must walk forward to exit at Murray Hill\" - was met with \nderisive laughter in the crowded aisles.\n\n- Pat Lyons \n\n 10:15 A.M. | In Coney Island, the Mundane Joys of a Warm, Bright School \n\nElla Kharmats, 8, a third grader at Public School 100 in Coney Island, walked anxiously to school Monday morning \nwith her father, Alex Kharmats. They passed scores of ruined cars, toppled trees, filthy streets and ribbons of yellow \ncaution tape flapping in a very cold wind.\n\n\"When you go to school, things start to get a little better,\" said Ella, who lived for days without heat or power.\n\nShe said in-class assignments on her first day back would include \"writing papers about what happened to you.\" \n\nMr. Kharmats, 41, an accountant who lost his car to the floods, said the everyday act of walking his daughter to \nschool in such a devastated setting was \"a little surreal.\"\n\nInside P.S. 100, also called The Coney Island School, the lights burned bright and radiators pumped out comforting \nheat. School buses ran around a half-hour late, but breakfast for hungry students was served on time. \n\nJust after 8 a.m., every student faced a flag and recited the Pledge of Allegiance, which a girl led on the public-\naddress system. The principal, Katherine Moloney, said it was too soon to tell whether attendance was normal.\n\nOne parent, Diana Novak, 49, hugged Ms. Moloney in a hallway and said she had prayed for the school during the \nstorm.\n\n\"I prayed you would be open, thank God,\" she said. \"It's more safe here than in our house.\"\n\nMany students who normally are driven arrived by foot or by bus, either because their family cars were destroyed or \nbecause their parents are trying to save gas. Kaitlyn Romero, 9, a fifth grader, usually got a ride to school with her \n\n\n\ngrandparents, but their car was ruined. Her mom's car was too. She said she felt \"tired\" Monday morning because \nshe'd worried through the night.\n\n\"I didn't sleep because I was thinking about school,\" she  said.\n\nKaitlyn's mother, Ella Mandel, 40, a substitute teacher, said she boiled water in the morning  so her daughter could \nbrush her teeth in an apartment still without potable water or heat. \n\nMary Ann Spinner, 47, a music teacher, wept a little as she stood outside the cafeteria door and welcomed back \nalmost every student by name. Every child that got within five feet got a hug.\n\n\"Some of it is tears of joy because I'm happy to see they're O.K.,\" she said.\n\nNatasha Moussa, 10, a fifth grader, rode the bus to school along with her brother, Musa Moussa, 14, a ninth grader \nat Leon M. Goldstein School nearby. Their family car had been destroyed, and they had spent days in a cold, dark, \ndirty apartment in a high-rise along battered Neptune Avenue.\n\n\"Last week was terrible because I live in Coney Island,\" Natasha said. \"But I like school, and it's boring staying \nhome, so I like going back.\"\n\n- Nate Schweber \n\n 9:45 A.M. | Bundled Up and Happy to Return to School \n\nIn front of the Lower East Side building that houses Public Schools 134 and 137, parents led small children bundled \nin extra coats and animal hats through the blue metal doors Monday morning for the first day of school since \nHurricane Sandy hit.\n\nFor many, it was a relief to have someone else take care of the children for the first time in days after a week spent \nplaying Uno by candlelight and listening to the radio.\n\n\"'Mommy, I can't take this!'\" Aura Salcedo, 43, recalled her 8-year-old son saying as he endured a week with no \ncomputer or TV, rolling her eyes. \"I tell him, 'Honey, back in the day this is how people lived!'\"\n\nHer son, too, was happy to return - though the chilly morning and lack of heat in their apartment did not ease the \ntransition.\n\n\"My son gave me a hard time today to get up this morning; it was so cold,\" Ms. Salcedo said. And guessing that the \nschool, on East Broadway, also had no heat, she bundled him in two shirts, a sweater, a coat, a scarf and a hat. \nHer suspicions were confirmed Monday morning.\n\nOther parents, too, had anticipated a cold school building. Christine Chan, had layered three shirts onto her fourth-\ngrade son. Mohamad Obad, 32, led two puffy children by the hands - his 7-year-old daughter, in a black sequin \nvest, boots and purple panda hat, and his 9-year-old son, in a dark vest and alien hat. He said he had spent $500 \noutfitting his three children with new winter clothes. And given that his neighborhood had no heat - forcing the whole \nfamily to sleep in one bed - he had dressed the children warmly in case the school had none, he said.\n\n- Vivian Yee \n\n 9:53 A.M. | On One Subway Line, a Near-Normal Commute \n\nIn with all the commuter chaos, there were patches of near-normalcy. \n\nAt about 7:15 a.m., the Q train leaving from the Seventh Avenue subway station in Brooklyn was crowded, but no \nmore so than most other Monday mornings. Crowds were sparse on the platform, so when the  trains came - two \nwithin 10 minutes - the passengers on the trains were able to inhale deeply enough to let those on the platform \nenter. \n\n\n\nIn at least one car,  a few seats even opened up at Atlantic Avenue and again at Canal Street - where again, as \nusual for that time of the morning, the platforms were busy but not overflowing.  \n\n- Diantha Parker \n\n 9:36 A.M. | In Newark, Long Lines and Alternate Routes \n\nAt Pennsylvania Station in Newark, the line for trains going to Penn Station in New York went down the stairs from \nthe platform deep into the area below - with hundreds  of people waiting for each train that left every 20 to 30 \nminutes. With PATH service between New Jersey and Manhattan still suspended, commuters were struggling to \ndevise alternate routes, which also included buses.\n\nSharon George, 50, who works at New York Life Insurance, was waiting in line with a friend. When her power went \nout, she stayed with her daughter in Brooklyn. She got it back last night, and today is her first day back to work.\n\n\"I felt so displaced,\" Ms. George said of the past week. \"Now I got my power back and I'm going to work,\" she said \nwith a smile as the line began to move.\n\n- Daniel Krieger \n\n 9:40 A.M. | Cold Halls and Thawed Frozen Food, but School is Open \n\nAt Public School 2 in Chinatown, power was on, but there was no hot water. \"We expect to carry on as usual,\" said \nthe acting interim principal, Bessie Ng. She had e-mailed teachers telling them to dress warmly. \"The students \nnormally come with many layers,\" she added.\n\nif they don't, the staff will find something warm for them, Ms. Ng said.\n\nLunch was an issue, too. Because power was out, food in the freezer had to be thrown out. Ms. Ng expected a \ndelivery for student meals shortly. \"A number of teachers brought in food, just in case,\" she said.\n\nA reporter visiting parts of the school Monday found the main hallway fairly comfortable; a classroom with windows \nand basement hallway were cooler, requiring a sweater or coat. The school relies on central city steam for heat and \nhot water, a custodian engineer, Chris Swift said. The system is controlled by Con Ed; the utility had e-mailed him \nto say they were working on the problem. \n\nKids played outside in a chilly breeze as others ate breakfast - cereal with shelf-safe milk - most with their coats still \non in a basement cafeteria. \n\n\"Put on your coat if you're going outside,\" the principal told one student in the basement. \"Where's your coat?,\" she \nasked another.\n\nThe P.T.A. president, Maggie Chin, said that some parents had power interruptions even after lights came on for \nmost the area, and some in nearby buildings still did not have heat. \"But it seems O.K.\" inside the school, she said. \n\nThe school is also a polling place. Workers were delivering cartons stamped \"Emergency Ballot Box\" from the \nBoard of Elections Monday morning. Tomorrow, the city schools will be closed once again, this time for voting.\n\n- Randy Leonard \n\n 9:23 A.M. | Departing From Jamaica: The Sardine Special \n\nThe Long Island Rail Road resumed modified service on most branches for Monday's commute, and at the \nJamaica hub in Queens, where most of the railroad's trains stop on the way into Pennsylvania Station or Atlantic \nTerminal in Brooklyn, the rush-hour crowds were all but impenetrable. \n\nOften, a passenger would watch five trains come and go before being able to get on. \n\nhttp://www.mta.info/status/2\n\n\n\"Doors must close!\" railroad workers yelled as people crammed their way in.\n\n\"It's like in Japan - the attendants push you in and bow at you,\" said Armando Perez, a flight attendant. \n\n Except, of course, no one was bowing.\n\nThanks 4 the heads up, guess where I wont be going #smh RT @           jlbarrow: Jamaica station right now.            \n#commute           #lirr           #sandy           instagr.am/p/RpcckoGiFX/\n\n- Mr. Aye Dee (@MrAyeDee)            November 5, 2012\n\nBut all things considered, commuters remained relatively civil. They bantered quietly about the damage to their \nhomes or their eagerness to get back to work, and tried to help one another.\n\nOne woman got into a screaming match with a train worker and stuck her camera phone in his face. \"Why won't you \nlet us on?\" she demanded. The man held up his badge and told her to go ahead and put the video on YouTube.\n\nMr. Perez, 54, who had just flown from Bogota into Kennedy International Airport and was headed for Atlantic \nTerminal to catch a subway home to Bensonhurst, watched a train depart. \"I'm too tired to push and shove,\" he \nsaid. \n\nDanielle Jelley-Rettman, an English teacher in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, had walked half an hour - \"to save gas\" - \nfrom her home in Sea Cliff, where she still has no power, to the train station there.\n\nTrains went by. Ms. Jelley-Rettman would miss her first-period class.\n\nFor Ms. Jelley-Rettman, 30, her school, the Brooklyn School of Music and Theater, would provide many of the \ncomforts her home still lacks.\n\n\"I am looking forward to work because I will have heat, Internet and a printer,\" she said.\n\n- Isaac Eger \n\n 8:41 A.M. | In New Jersey, Buses Go By, Too Full to Stop \n\nAcross northern New Jersey, oversubscribed buses were the order of the day.\n\nAt a bus stop in Union City, about three dozen people waited as several overcrowded New Jersey Transit buses \npassed by. Even some of the private minibuses that compete with the buses were too full to accommodate any \nmore passengers. \n\nIn Montclair, the private Decamp line commuter buses passed  dozens of potential passengers at corner after \ncorner, leaving folks groaning at the curb.

She and her husband, who is \n46, would go grocery shopping and run errands together.\n\nAll of that changed last Monday, when Sandy left them stranded on the 10th floor. Many thousands in the city are \nwithout elevator service. But their predicament had another fold. Both Mr. Kharak and Ms. Kozlova are in \nwheelchairs. \n\n\"Our decision was 'stay here,'\" Mr. Kharak said. \"Last year, Irene wasn't so bad. We saw our neighbors. They have \nwater, some candles. They help us. Every two days, my cousin comes. He has chargers for cellphones, food.\"\n\nThe situation was bearable, if not pleasant, but things began to grow more dire with the days. First the medical-\nsupply company that delivered their diapers and other vital items failed to come. And then temperatures began to \ndrop. \n\nBut they only grew discouraged when the buildings surrounding theirs began to light up, while they were still sitting \nin the dark. \"Sometimes we feel, we think that everyone forget about us,\" Mr. Kharak said.\n\nThe Coney Island Houses were still shrouded in darkness on Sunday night. Consolidated Edison said that it had no \ntimetable for restoring power to the buildings.\n\nAs the temperatures dipped nearly to freezing, Mr. Kharak had turned on the gas burners of the stove to heat the \napartment. Ms. Kozlova lay under a blanket in the bedroom. A candle illuminated two prints by Gustav Klimt on the \nwalls. \"Sometimes we are upset,\" she said. \"We think, 'We are not getting power because our neighbors are not \nrich?'\" \n\nTheir building, which they had not seen, was a sight to behold. The halls were gritty with sand and lined with black \ngarbage bags. The narrow stairwell, now the only way to get down to the street, was as dark as a cave and reeked \nof urine. Outside, half-buried cars poked their noses out of sand dunes on the street, and workers in hazmat suits \nwent in and out of the first floors, which were completely flooded.\n\nThey had not received any help, other than that of their neighbors and relatives, until Saturday, when someone \nknocked on their door and was surprised to find two wheelchair users there. They were asked what their needs \nwere, and today, \"volunteers came four times,\" Mr. Kharak said.\n\nDespite moments of frustration, Ms. Kozlova said she had no intention of leaving. Her husband had offered to buy \nher a ticket back to Russia, to escape and recuperate for a few weeks, but she had refused. \"I am not going alone, \n\" she said.\n\nThe couple said they had not bickered or taken out their stir-craziness on each other over the last six days. \"It's a \nlittle like a honeymoon,\" Mr. Kharak said. \"Why not?\" \n\n\"If we are not too cold, we will stay five days more,\" he added. \"It's not so bad, but cold.\"\n\n Correction: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated Marina Kozlova's surname as Tozlova.  \n\n- Annie Correal \n\n 8:47 P.M. | Street Where Crane Collapsed Is Reopened  \n\nOn Sunday night, New York City police reopened the segment of West 57th Street in Midtown Manhattan that was \nclosed off after a construction crane collapsed at the top of a high-rise under construction.\n\nhttp://www.nyc.gov/html/nycha/html/developments/bklynconeyisland.shtml\n\n\nThe block, which is home to Carnegie Hall, had been closed to pedestrians and cars since the high winds from the \nstorm that blew through on Monday night left the crane's boom dangling vertically.

Bush \nafter 9/11 and then again after Hurricane Katrina. Under these temporary rules, employers contributed money to \ncharitable organizations in exchange for employees forgoing vacation, sick or personal leave time. \n\nThe American Payroll Association, a nonprofit association representing payroll professionals and payroll service \nproviders, said in a letter sent Sunday evening than such rules create a greater tax incentive for employees to \ndonate. \n\nNormally, donations can be deducted from one's income taxes, but they are still subject to payroll taxes (taxes that \nfund Social Security and Medicare). Under these special rules, donations would be subject to neither income nor \npayroll taxes. Instead, employees would transfer some of their salary back to their employer - which could run its \nown designated Hurricane Sandy relief fund - or to a designated charity like the Red Cross. \n\nUnder this process, employees would never need to take an actual deduction on their income tax return since they \nnever received the income in the first place.  They American Payroll Association also suggested that employees be \nable to donate money from their wages in addition to donating specific leave days, particularly since many workers \ndo not have leave days. \n\nUnder existing tax rules, employees can already give their own sick or vacation days to their coworkers who might \nhave been affected by the hurricane. The employee who is donating does not have to pay income or payroll taxes \non the gift, but the leave is subject to both kinds of taxes when received by the employee being gifted the leave.  \n\nThe American Payroll Association is asking the I.R.S. to change how these kind of donations are treated as well, so \nthat both the donating and receiving employees are not subject to income and payroll taxes for the donation. \n\n- Catherine Rampell  \n\n 6:36 P.M. | New Storm May Threaten Power Restoration \n\n      Just as crews working for Consolidated Edison have reduced the number of the utility's customers without \npower to fewer than 200,000, the company's officials are warning that another storm is threatening to impede the \nrestoration, and possibly undo some of the work.\n\n      The storm, a northeaster due to hit the region on Wednesday with winds of up to 50 miles per hour, could slow \nthe work that crews are doing to repair overhead lines and may even take down more power poles and lines, said \nJohn Miksad, Con Edison's senior vice president for electric operations.\n\n      \"The first concern is slowing the army that we've got down; the second is more outages,\" Mr. Miksad said. \"It \ncertainly does complicate the restoration.\"\n\n     He said that by Sunday evening, the company had restored power to all but 198,000 customers who lost their \nelectricity when Sandy blew through the region on Monday.  Of those, the largest number, 86,000, were in \nWestchester County, he said.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/30/nyregion/storm-service-updates.html\nhttp://www.americanpayroll.org/\n\n\n     For the city, he provided this breakdown of the remaining customers without power:\n\n         Queens: 54,000\n\n         Brooklyn: 23,000\n\n         Staten Island: 19,000\n\n         The Bronx: 11,000\n\n         Manhattan: 5,000\n\n     Most of the customers in Manhattan still without power were in buildings that were too flooded or damaged to \naccept electricity from the company's system, Mr. Miksad said.\n\n       He did, however, say that Con Edison was asking customers in three areas in Lower Manhattan, below the \nBrooklyn Bridge on the east side and the World Trade Center on the west side, to use as little power as possible on \nMonday because the networks there were still \"compromised.\"\n\n        Crews were racing to get electricity flowing again to schools and polling places, Mr. Miksad said. But he said \nthat nine schools in the city and six in Westchester County would still be without power on Monday morning.\n\n- Patrick McGeehan \n\n 6:14 P.M. | N.Y.

Craig Fugate, the FEMA director, said in an interview Sunday that the officials were still assessing how many \npeople altogether will need temporary housing.\n\nBut as of Sunday at 3 p.m., 182,000 residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have applied for disaster \nassistance, and a total of $158 million has been approved. Some share of that total will need a temporary place to \nstay, Mr. Fugate said, adding that he is well aware that there is a shortage of vacant housing in many of the areas \nhit by the storm, particularly on Long Island.\n\n\"This is really going to have to be neighborhood by neighborhood,\" Mr. Fugate said.\n\nTo help, FEMA announced over the weekend that it is offering victims of Hurricane Sandy vouchers good for up to \ntwo weeks in a hotel or motel, with the bills to be paid directly by the federal government.\n\nThe federal subsidy will cover the room only, not meals or other incidentals. In New Jersey, anyone displaced by \nthe storm whose home is uninhabitable and is approved for coverage by FEMA is eligible, a federal official said \nSunday. But in New York, the federal official said, families must apply through an emergency shelter to be eligible \nfor the hotel program, at the request of state officials.\n\nEither way, displaced families must pre-register with FEMA before they check into a hotel, as the agency will use \ncomputer databases to confirm that they live in the zone hit by the storm. \n\nVictims of the storm can register for disaster assistance by calling the agency at 1-800-621-FEMA, visiting one of its \nregistration centers that have been set up in the disaster zones, or by enrolling over the Internet at \nwww.disasterassistance.gov. Mobile phones can also be used to enroll at            m.fema.gov.\n\nIn cases where families move into temporary apartments, which state and local officials are helping them find, \nFEMA will in many cases provide rental assistance directly to the  families, which will then be responsible for \npaying the landlords, a federal official said Sunday. This program will last up to 18 months.\n\n- Eric Lipton \n\n 4:52 P.M. | FEMA Expects Improving Fuel Supply    \n\nThough lines for gasoline remain long in New York and New Jersey,   \"Tomorrow and Tuesday, we will continue to \nsee improvement,\"  W. Craig Fugate, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said on Sunday.\n\nThe Defense Department, which has been authorized to purchase up to 12 million gallons of gasoline and 10 \nmillion gallons of diesel fuel, said it would also supply emergency generators to gas stations that have gas but no \nelectricity to power their pumps.\n\nhttp://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/how-new-yorkers-adjusted-to-sudden-smartphone-withdrawal/\nhttp://www.disasterassistance.gov/\nhttp://m.fema.gov/\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/business/military-to-deliver-fuel-to-storm-region.html\n\n\nIt was unclear how many stations are in that predicament. Industry officials said the lack of power was the biggest \nproblem at many stations. But in a by the federal Energy Department, no stations reported that problem, though 17 \npercent did not respond to the survey, some of them perhaps because they lacked power. \n\nOn Sunday, the federal Department of Energy set up a toll free number that gas station owners can call to help \nthem get temporary generators until power is restored.\n\nMr. Fugate said that with the Port of New York opening late last week to petroleum shipments and various fuel \ndepots and refineries coming back on line, he expects the supply problem to be eliminated soon. But long lines will \nremain a problem in isolated spots, he said, due to the number of gas stations that remain closed, and also \nbecause of excessive purchases by area residents who are filling up tanks even if they are not low.\n\n- Eric Lipton \n\n 4:17 P.M. | 1.85 Million U.S. Homes Still Lack Power After Storm \n\nPower has now been restored to nearly 80 percent of the 8.5 million homes in 16 states that lost power in last \nweek's storm, the federal government said.

For instance, Montclair is listed as having \nall its power back as of yesterday.

Andrew M. Cuomo  said that tankers and barges were on their way to \nNew York area ports carrying fuel to ease the situation. Port Newark-Elizabeth in New Jersey reopened on Sunday. \nThe Inwood terminal and the Northville terminal at Port Jefferson, which funnel fuel to Long Island, are open, and \n1.5 million gallons of gasoline are scheduled to be delivered to the Northville terminal today.\n\n Mr. Cuomo warned against unnecessary driving and gas hoarding, adding that he expected the fuel shortage to \ncontinue for several more days. \"Now is not the time to be using the car if you don't need to,\" Mr. Cuomo said. \"Now \nis not the time to be hoarding fuel.\"\n\n The U.S. Energy Information Administration, which has been surveying gasoline availability in the region \nsurrounding New York, estimated on Saturday that 38 percent of gas stations in the area had no gas to sell, down \nfrom 67 percent on Friday. Three percent had gas, but no power to pump it.\n\n Anecdotally, however, the quest for motor fuel continued to be a frustrating one.\n\nPeople have been in line at this Staten Island Hess since 6am.

Chris Christie's rationing system remains in place, gas lines seemed slightly shorter in \nEssex County, but many stations were still closed. Authorities have set up three fuel depots in New Jersey so that \ndoctors and nurses can get up to 15 gallons of gas to go to work. \n\nIn Park Slope, Brooklyn, Julio Guerrero, 57, a car service driver, waited in line for two hours Sunday to get gas for \nhis brother, who is also a car service driver. The station had a 10-gallon limit, but Mr. Guerrero was planning to fill \nsix 1-gallon containers purchased at Home Depot. His car still had half a tank of gas, which, he said, would see him \nthrough the rest of the day.\n\nIn New Jersey, some residents adjusted by flouting the state's longstanding law against pumping your own gas. \nOthers drove far from home to places where gas was more plentiful or to counties where the odd-even rationing \nregime was not in place, The Associated Press reported.\n\nAt a Lukoil station in Lakewood, in Ocean County, which is outside the rationing zone, there were no lines early \nSunday afternoon, although the station manager, Syed Uddin said customers had waited more than 30 minutes in \nthe morning, according to The A.P.\n\nAt one pump, Lew Thompson of Toms River was pumping his own gas into two plastic canisters so he could power \nhis generator.\n\n\"Makes it a little quicker,\" Thompson said of his self-service. \"Like the governor said, sometimes you've got to cut \nthrough the bureaucracy and get it done.\"\n\n#njgas           twitpic.com/ba4neo\n\n- Valerie Taylor (@RieAnnTaylor)            November 4, 2012\n\n Michael M.

Lows in the upper thirties and highs in the 40s are \nexpected through Thursday. The average low temperature in New York City this time of year is about 45.\n\nIn one slightly encouraging note, any flooding from the northeaster will be mitigated by the fact that there is now in a \nlull in the lunar tidal cycle, between the full and new moons.\n\nOn Sunday night, Mr. Picca said, low temperatures could dip into the 20s on Long Island and the Hudson Valley, \nboth areas where many tens of thousands of homes remain without power.  Wednesday night's storm could be \naccompanied by a few snowflakes in the city's northwestern suburbs, he said.\n\n- Andy Newman \n\n 1:01 P.M. | Video: Cargo Arriving at Port Elizabeth, N.J. \n\nWatch on Youtube.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/10/nyregion/attention-shoppers.html\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/05/nyregion/freezing-temperatures-complicate-storm-recovery.html\nhttp://readynj.posterous.com/message-from-the-nws-11412-100-pm-coastal-sto\nhttp://readynj.posterous.com/message-from-the-nws-11412-100-pm-coastal-sto\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JNJjyjxtuA\n\n\nPort Elizabeth in New Jersey received its first post-storm cargo shipment on Sunday, at Maher Terminal.

But most of the area, an 11-mile-long \npeninsula attached to southeastern Queens, remained shrouded in darkness. \n\nOutside a police station house on Beach 94th Street, a dozen or so people gathered around a police generator that \noffered both street light and a place to charge phones. \n\nAmanda Victoria, 30, stood by it with one of her daughters, age 11. It's better here, said Ms. Victoria, than inside \nher home on Beach 99th Street, where it was even colder. \"They have Manhattan up and running,\" she said. \"Why \ncan't they help us? There's homes here, too.\"\n\nBeside her stood Brian Donohue, 26, who lives on the 16th floor of an apartment building on Beach 8th Street with \nhis 81-year-old grandfather and has been carrying water and food up 16 flights since Monday. \"I know he can go \ndown the stairs,\" said Mr. Donohue. \"But there's no way he's getting back up.\"\n\nShortly after 11 p.m. Zakeem, who gave only his first name, was traveling from Rockaway Beach to Ozone Park, \nQueens, on a bus driven by a police officer. This is public transportation in the absence of the A train. \"See that \nskyline?\" said Zakeem, 22, pointing toward Manhattan. \"They have everything. Come to the Rockaways. We have \nnothing.\"\n\nOne van driver, Lou Luton, took commuters and volunteers from Ozone Park to the Rockaways for $10 each. \"My \nplace is washed out completely,\" he said of his home in Rockaway Beach. \"It looks like sand and dirt.\" He added, \"I \ndon't know where to start, how to build back. But God bless, we still got life.\"\n\nBy the generator, several men boarded a police van bound headed northward, away from the disaster and into \nOzone Park, where there was electricity and heat.

Some asked for donations for the Red Cross as they \njogged by, others noshed Power Bars. It made for a barrage of languages spoken and an assemblage of athletes \nfrom grade schoolers to the older adults. Some at the finish line cried. \n\nBleachers set up at the finish line hosted hundreds of fans, who clanged cowbells and yelled encouragements to \nthe runners.

That's all the fun they can have right now, \nbut I think you have to find the good things.\"\n\n\n\nAcross the street, Patricia Restrepo, 40, a veterinarian, tended to abandoned animals.

Too many pockets of \nthe region were dotted with devastation. Too many lines of the transit network remained quiet.

The police arrested the man and \ncharged him with burglary. \n\nNearby, police arrested three people who were observed \"auto surfing,\" checking car doors to see whether they \nwere unlocked. Police said the two men and a woman were in possession of stolen property, including keys to a \nMercedes Benz that they may have been planning to steal. \n\nBurglary, the police said, is the only type of crime to have risen in the last week, up 3 percent from Monday through \nFriday compared with the same period last year. \n\nThousands of police have been deployed to patrol the areas of the city left darkened and destroyed by the storm. \nMany officers are on extended tours, doing duties outside their normal beats to help with the recovery. They have \nbeen deployed to maintain order at gasoline stations and to distribute portable street lights to areas without power. \nWith traffic lights out across the city, 500 police academy recruits have stepped in to direct cars.

At a news briefing in Bridgeport on Saturday afternoon, Gov. \nDannel P. Malloy said the state was moving to hook up generators at a small number of polling places that \nremained without power. But he said the generators were being installed only as an insurance policy of sorts. \"I \nbelieve that all of the polling places will be open on Tuesday with regular current,\" Mr. Malloy said.\n\n- Thomas Kaplan \n\n 6:53 P.M. | Some Power Restored, but Much Left to Do \n\nOut of the nearly one million Consolidated Edison customers who lost electricity during Hurricane Sandy, 670,000 \nhave had power restored, John Miksad, the company's senior vice president for electric operations, said in a \nteleconference on Saturday evening.\n\nAbout 270,000 customers were still without power, as many as had lost electricity during Hurricane Irene last year, \nhe said. About 40 schools and 70 polling places remained in the dark.\n\n\"We still have in front of us another hurricane's worth to restore,\" Mr. Miksad said. \"We are not done by any stretch \nof the imagination and will be at it for a very long time.\"\n\nHe said the electricity networks for those with restored power were still \"precarious\" given the current lack of \nredundancy in both distribution and transmission.\n\n- Michael Schwirtz \n\n 6:46 | Volunteers Descend on Staten Island Neighborhood \n\nSince Tuesday, residents of storm-ravaged neighborhoods on Staten Island's eastern shore have been hauling \ndebris from their homes and assessing how much Hurricane Sandy had altered their lives. Some families have \nworked alone, others with the help of a few neighbors, friends or relatives.\n\nBut on Saturday, hundreds of people from around the city and region poured into these beleaguered \nneighborhoods, offering a hand to strangers in need.\n\nBy late morning, the narrow lanes of Midland Beach, one of the most affected areas on Staten Island, were buzzing \nwith activity. Groups of volunteers carrying hoes, rakes, brooms and shovels went door to door offering their labor. \nOthers circled the blocks in pickup trucks full of food, blankets, clothes and cleaning supplies. Impromptu \ndistribution centers piled high with food and secondhand clothes sprung up on every other corner.\n\n\"Anybody need anything?\" a man shouted from a truck to a group cleaning out a house on Olympia Boulevard. A \nfew minutes later, two women pulling rolling suitcases paused in front of the same house. \"Need anything?\" one \nsaid. \"Toiletries?\"\n\nThere appeared to be more volunteers offering help than residents who actually needed it.\n\nAt a house on Hunter Avenue, Alfredo Zapata, 60, his wife, Beatriz, 47, were cleaning out the remains of their \nbattered bungalow when a small group of strangers showed up and asked if they needed a hand.\n\nOne of the volunteers, Katie Nguyen, 32, an employee at an investment bank, said they were among about a dozen \nfriends who had traveled together from Manhattan that morning to help out. They had brought food and clothes to \ndonate.\n\n\"I've never been to Staten Island,\" Ms. Nguyen said.\n\nBut they said volunteering their services and making donations had been more difficult than they had anticipated.\n\n\n\nOne of the volunteers, Samuel Palmer, 31, said that earlier in the week he had helped rally a group of friends and \ncolleagues for a mission to Staten Island.\n\n\"I spent two days online trying to figure out where to bring all the people who wanted to help,\" said Mr. Palmer, a \nmanagement consultant. Unable to find a single point of coordination, he said, the group decided to simply go to the \nborough and figure out once they got there how they could be most helpful.\n\nOnce on Staten Island, however, they visited an American Red Cross distribution center near Midland Beach, but \ncoordinators turned the group away, saying they did not need any more donations. The group then stopped by a \nFederal Emergency Management Agency command center but got little guidance from the authorities there, Mr. \nPalmer said.\n\nSo the volunteers decided to break up into small groups and head out into the neighborhood to see how they could \nbe of service.\n\nMr. Zapata had a rental apartment behind his house still crammed with furniture and belongings destroyed by the \nstorm, and the group slipped on rubber gloves, strapped on dust masks and got to work.\n\n- Kirk Semple \n\n 5:47 | Bloomberg Chastises Long Island Power Authority \n\nMayor Michael R.

He added that officials hoped to transfer out the last \ntwo patients as soon as the elevators, which had been flooded, were back in service. But he declined to say \nanything about the patients or their condition.\n\nThe sources also said that after Hurricane Sandy hit, the Bellevue morgue was under water, so the bodies of \npatients who died of their illnesses after the storm had to be kept elsewhere. Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for \nthe city medical examiner, confirmed that the Bellevue morgue had been flooded, but that with the assistance of \nthe medical examiner, the bodies had been put on higher racks to keep them out of the water.\n\nShe did not know how many bodies there were. Ms. Borakove said the medical examiner's morgue, which is \nseparate, remained dry.\n\nOn the night of the storm, Bellevue, which housed 725 patients, lost power and went on backup generators. But \nwithin a short time, the basement flooded, the fuel pumps feeding the generators failed and elevator shafts flooded.\n\n- Anemona Hartocollis \n\n 4:09 | Mayor Bloomberg Addresses the City  \n\nMichael R.

Andrew M. Cuomo announced that four mobile distribution \nstations would be established in four spots around the city. Under the plan, each motorist could receive up to 10 \nfree gallons of gasoline. But not long after that, the location in Queens was swamped by motorists.\n\nAs a result, Mr. Durr said, the decision was made to provide fuel only for emergency workers. He said that with 28 \nmillion gallons of gas on its way to the state, as the governor had announced, there soon will not be a need for the \nemergency fuel.\n\nIt is also a cumbersome process to pump.\n\nThe way it works, Mr. Durr said, is that at each site there are two trucks - one that holds 8,000 gallons and another \nthat holds 2,800. The smaller truck distributes gas to vehicles and when it runs dry, it needs to be refueled by the \nbigger truck.\n\nhttp://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/h/hurricanes_and_tropical_storms/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=GFBy4QGNPBE#!\n\n\n- Marc Santora \n\n 3:01 pm | Christie Not Sure How Long Gas Rationing Will Last \n\nGov. Chris Christie said that he could not estimate how long New Jersey's gas rationing system would have to \nremain in place, adding that the biggest problem for the state's gas stations was power even more than supply at \nthis point.\n\nIn northern New Jersey, Mr. Christie said, many of the stations do not have the ability to be connected to \ngenerators, something the governor said he was unaware of until the storm hit.\n\n\"In New Jersey, no one had a complete list of all the gas stations,\" he said. \"You can bet we are going to have one \nnow.\"\n\nStations that can get power from a generator, Mr. Christie said, have been hooked up by the National Guard.\n\nHe defended the decision to ration gas with the odd-even system.\n\n\"I wanted to see if this could resolve itself without the odd-even system,\" he said. But as he toured the state and \nsaw the lines snaking for miles, he decided that he had to take extraordinary measures.\n\nThe state will also receive 11 million gallons of gas from the military but instead of setting up distribution centers, \nas New York is doing, he said the plan was to deliver gas to the distributors.\n\nMr. Christie also offered an update on the progress restoring power.\n\n\"There are now 1.2 million people without power,\" he said. That is down from 2.7 million immediately after the \nstorm hit.\n\nHe said more workers continue to come into the state and soon there would be 11,000 people working to \"get done \nwhat they need to get done.\"\n\n- Marc Santora \n\n 2:38 | Protecting New York City, Before Next Time \n\nIf, as climate experts say, sea levels in the region have not only gradually increased, but are also likely to get higher \nas time goes by, then the question is: What is the way forward?\n\nIn this week's Metropolitan section are three proposals - some traditional, some fantastic, but all at least \ntheoretically workable - designed to reduce the effects of storms like Hurricane Sandy on three especially \nvulnerable New York neighborhoods: Lower Manhattan, the Red Hook and Gowanus sections of Brooklyn, and the \nnorthern shore of Staten Island.

But I cannot continue to do that on \nan empty gas tank.\n\nSo I'm waiting in line at the Hess station at New Dorp Lane and Hylan Boulevard.\n\nThough Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and other state officials have made assurances that relief is on the way, my needle \nis hovering a hair above a quarter tank now, and the gas station isn't even in my view. According to Google Maps, \nI'm exactly a half mile away.\n\nTensions are high. As I wait, I can see volunteers walking with water to a devastated area a few blocks away. The \npast few days, all you hear are sirens and helicopters, and it makes you feel even more nervous about being \ntrapped without transportation.\n\nLike the guy I heard about who waited for five blocks at a BP station in Grasmere. He was right at the entrance of \nthe station when it ran out of gas - and so did his car.\n\n\"When we sold out at 3 a.m., one guy was screaming because his car died,\" Nori Levy, a mechanic at the BP gas \nstation told me. \"They had to tow it away.\"\n\nThat could have easily been me. Just before midnight on Friday, I received word that a station had just gotten a \ndelivery. I jumped in the car and raced there. Mine was one of the few cars turned away at 3:30 a.m. They had just \nsold out, and I had wasted gas sitting there, waiting.\n\nThese gas lines have become a familiar sight on Staten Island, and the amount of gas left in your car is among the \nfirst questions asked of strangers after, \"Are you O.K.?\"\n\nAt a Getty station in Grant City, just a few blocks from my apartment, people were lined up every day after the \nstorm, snarling traffic along Richmond Road. But I didn't understand why those people were waiting.\n\nOrange tape was strung across the pumps. A cardboard sign read: \"We are closed. Out of gas.\"\n\n\"We're just standing on line with the promise of gas,\" a customer named Greg Ferraioli told me earlier in the week.\n\nHe had arrived at the station at 5 a.m. on Thursday with his Ford F-150.  \"I'm on E, so I'm prepared to wait all \nnight.\"\n\nThe station's owner, Nino Cutillo, said a delivery was expected soon, but hours later, nothing had arrived - not even \nan update on when a fresh supply would come.\n\n\"We will get gas sometime this afternoon,\" is all he could offer. I called the station back at 9 p.m. that day. \"No, no \ngas,\" Mr. Cutillo said.\n\n Amy Padnani is a Web producer for The New York Times. \n\n- Amy Padnani \n\n 12:56 a.m. | As Gas Rationing Begins, Confusion Reigns \n\nAt an Exxon station in Bayonne, N.J., police officers and people waiting in line for gasoline argued over the \nmeaning of Gov. Chris Christie's new policy regarding gas rationing.\n\nThe police had been given an interpretation of the policy that read: \"If your vehicle's license plate ends in a letter \n(A,B,C...), you are only permitted to fuel the vehicle on odd-numbered days.\" \n\nThe problem: All license plates in New Jersey end in letters, except for vanity plates. So on Saturday, most \neveryone in the state could buy gas. Or so it seemed. But according to the actual state policy, the last number on a \nplate is supposed to determine odd or even status, not the letter.\n\n\n\n Correction: A previous version of this post contained a misinterpretation of the New Jersey rationing policy. The \nBayonne police were using a summary of the policy that said the days motorists could get gas was based on the \nlast letter of their license plate.  Actually, the days are determined by the last number on the license plate, not the \nlast letter. A previous correction also referred erroneously to the summary. The police were quoting that, not state \npolicy.  \n\n- Christopher Maag \n\n 12:08 p.m. | Costs of Canceling Marathon Are Unknown but Immense \n\nThe finish line for the 43rd New York City Marathon stood silent in the stillness of Central Park on Friday night, its \nsigns listing the sponsors of a race that had been canceled hours earlier.

As each network came online, they got a bit closer to \ngetting power back to all 220,000 people below 39th Street who lost it.\n\nOutside Manhattan, the challenges were in some ways more difficult, with crews having to contend with thousands \nof lines that were mangled, damaged or ripped down in Monday's hurricane. Con Ed said it could take until mid-\nNovember to bring electricity back to all of its customers. In Westchester County, where 120,000 people have no \npower, the utility said navigating downed trees and dealing with connections cut off by limbs and branches was \nsimply going to take more time. On Long Island, more than 500,000 customers of the Long Island Power Authority \nstill had no power on Friday evening, or any estimate of when it would return.\n\nIn New Jersey, Public Service Electric and Gas had restored power to over a million customers by Friday morning, \nbut nearly 600,000 still had no electricity by night.

But without electricity, water could not be \npumped up to the towers.\n\nMr. Humm had working sinks and toilets in his fourth-floor apartment at London Terrace, the huge, now-fashionable \napartment complex in West Chelsea. But many of his neighbors did not.\n\nSo Mr. Humm, a reporter on gay and civil rights issues and an activist by nature, went on a crusade to open up a \nlower-floor bathroom to be used by higher-floor tenants, particularly the elderly.\n\n\"If you're above the sixth floor, the toilets don't flush,\" Mr. Humm said. \"Yes, people were advised to fill your tubs, \nbut this has been going on for days.\"\n\nBy his own account, he began pestering Ellen Gribben Bornet, general manager of Rose Associates, the \nmanagement company for 1,000 apartments, to provide this public service.\n\n\"I'm still working to see if it's logistically feasible,\" Ms. Bornet said Friday afternoon.  \"It may be a moot point as Con \nEd is advising that we will have power tonight.\"\n\nWhen she did not immediately come through, Mr. Humm called the city's Office of Emergency Management, which \ntold him where he could buy some portable toilets.\n\n\"I said, 'Me?'\" he recalled, noting that he could hardly afford it.\n\nIn desperation, he called the district office for Christine Quinn, the City Council speaker, who represents the area.\n\nAt about 4 p.m. Friday, Mr. Humm got a call to go downstairs and receive 20 Porta Potties, courtesy of Ms. Quinn, \nwho lived in London Terrace until last year.\n\nJamie McShane, a spokesman for Ms. Quinn, reached as he rode his bike home Friday evening from City Hall to \nSunnyside, Queens, said he did not know how the speaker intended to pay for the portable toilets, or whether she \nhad arranged for other constituents to have them as well. \"Listen, I think she was glad to be able to be responsive \nto the concerns and needs of the tenants association,\" he said. (After checking, Mr. McShane said that Ms. Quinn \nhad obtained portable toilets for other locations, including a Chelsea housing project.)\n\nPower was restored to the building around 6 p.m., though the Porta Potties would still come in handy, because it \nwas expected to take a few hours for pumps to replenish the water towers. When that happened, the portable toilets \nwould be moved elsewhere, Mr. McShane said.\n\n- Anemona Hartocollis \n\n 6:17 P.M. | Students at Severely Damaged Schools to Start Class Wednesday \n\n\n\nStudents at 65 \"severely damaged\" public schools will be temporarily reassigned to new schools, and will \nresume classes on Wednesday, Dennis M. Walcott, the schools chancellor, announced late Friday afternoon.\n\nThe rest of the city's schoolchildren will return to class Monday, but the logistical challenges of relocating students \nfrom those hardest-hit schools require an extra two days, Mr. Walcott said. On Tuesday, all city public schools are \nclosed for Election Day.\n\nHigh on the list of those challenges is transportation. \"Especially in severely hit areas, schools may not be next \ndoor,\" the chancellor warned. Younger children will be delivered to the new locations by bus; high school students \nwill get a MetroCard.

Many live in areas that do not yet have electricity. \nMr. Walcott said the schools would be using every resource to reach the affected families, working through parent \ncoordinators and parent associations; broadcasting the news in print, online and over the airwaves; using robocalls \nand text messages; and keeping 311 call takers informed. \n\n\"We understand and feel for those individuals that may not have power, may not be in their homes, but that doesn't \nmean they're totally isolated,\" he said, though he allowed that \"there's going to be some folks who may not get\" the \ninformation in time.\n\nCompounding the difficulties, some students in affected areas are now homeless and may be scattered around the \ncity; some have lost loved ones; many have experienced trauma. The Education Department is working with other \ncity agencies such as the Department of Homeless Services as well as with grief counselors to attend to those \nstudents' needs.\n\nIn addition to the currently inoperable schools, an even greater number were left intact but without power. Mr. \nWalcott said that \"Con Edison has provided a dedicated individual to work solely on powering up our schools.\" He \nexpected that \"a sizable number\" of those schools would be up and running by Monday, especially the large \nnumber that are located in Lower Manhattan, an area that by Friday afternoon was already coming back on line.\n\nMr. Walcott also answered questions about the handful of schools that are currently serving as shelters for people \nleft homeless by the storm. They will be there while school is in session, but will not occupy the same areas as \nstudents.\n\n\"We want to make sure there's isolation between those who are in a building for shelter purposes,\" he said, and \nthose who are there to study. Responding to concerns about possible security risks and unsanitary conditions, he \nsaid all would be addressed by Monday morning: \"If it's not sanitary then it will be sanitary, and the conditions have \nto be met.\"\n\nTeachers citywide showed up for work Friday to make preparations for their students' return. \"I'm pleased to report \nthat based on a survey of 1,300 schools today we had 80 percent attendance,\" Mr. Walcott said, noting that many \nof those teachers overcame their own flood-related challenges to show up. Teachers and staff of the severely \ndamaged schools will report to work Monday, at their new locations, in advance of their transplanted students.\n\nThe list of those 65 schools, which the department intended to release Friday night, includes some with basements \nor even first stories underwater, boilers that are submerged or no longer functioning, and electrical systems that \nwere destroyed by fire. An earlier estimate tallied 79 schools, but in the interim some have been brought up to code.\n\n- Ariel Kaminer \n\n 5:58 P.M. | Metro-North Upper Hudson Line Service to Begin; East River Ferry Service to Resume \n\nFull train service will resume Saturday morning on Metro-North Railroad's Upper Hudson Line from Croton-Harmon \nto Poughkeepsie, Gov.

Once there, Mr. Hunter tried to pay for a 6,000-watt generator, but his credit card company initially \nblocked the transaction.\n\n\"I had to get on the phone with someone who wanted to know why I was purchasing generators all over the place,\" \nMr. Hunter said. \"I had not yet canceled the order I had made in Virginia, so my credit card company thought it was \na case of fraud. It was kind of embarrassing.\"\n\n\"By the time we got back to Aberdeen, many of our neighbors were still searching for generators and some were \nstill on Home Depot's waiting list,\" Mr. Lapinski said. \"So our trip, though it may have been a long one, was well \nworth it.\"\n\n- Vincent M.

The flooding nearly immersed two fire trucks that have already been placed in the museum and it \nsurrounded the symbolic            last column taken from the twin towers.\n\n\"It was shocking,\" said Joseph C. Daniels, the president and chief executive of the            National September 11 \nMemorial and Museum, which is responsible for both the museum and the memorial. He said he had gone to bed \n\nhttp://marthagraham.org/\nhttp://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/martha-graham-sets-and-costumes-damaged-by-hurricane-sandy/#more-292711\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/arts/design/sept-11-memorial-museums-fraught-task-to-tell-the-truth.html\nhttp://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/24/steel-column-a-911-survivor-returns-to-ground-zero/\nhttp://www.911memorial.org/joseph-c-daniels\nhttp://www.911memorial.org/national-september-11-memorial-museum\nhttp://www.911memorial.org/national-september-11-memorial-museum\n\n\nMonday believing the museum was safe. He awakened Tuesday to word that the site had flooded overnight. Later \nthat day, he witnessed it himself from a balcony overlooking the enormous Foundation Hall on the main floor, now \nfilled with thick, black water on which wood planks and other debris floated.\n\nFour days earlier, Mr. Daniels had been standing in the hall with members of the memorial foundation board, \nshowing them renderings and explaining which displays would go where. Construction was finally resuming on the \nmuseum after the resolution of a protracted financing dispute between the foundation, of which Mayor Michael R. \nBloomberg is chairman, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is partly controlled by Gov. \nAndrew M. Cuomo. The authority owns the World Trade Center site and is building the museum on behalf of the \nfoundation.\n\nThe view from the balcony showed water reaching almost to the top of the fire truck used by Engine Company 21 to \nrespond to the attack in 2001, and the truck on which Ladder Company 3 arrived. A Fire Department ambulance \nwas also surrounded with water. All three had been shrink-wrapped in plastic before they were installed in the \nmuseum. With the floodwaters still standing, there was no way on Friday to assess how much additional damage \nthe already battered vehicles had sustained, or whether the plastic enclosure had protected them.\n\nThe archipelago of partly submerged artifacts includes the last column of the original twin towers. This 58-ton piece, \nmore than 36 feet high, was removed with funereal ceremony in May 2002 to symbolize the end of the first phase of \nrecovery, the clearance of the World Trade Center site. It was then stored in a climate-controlled area of Hangar 17 \nat Kennedy International Airport while            undergoing conservation. It is still in a climate-controlled enclosure, so \nits condition has not been assessed. Many of the personal effects that had been taped to the column were removed \nlong ago for safekeeping. But the column is also covered in spray-painted graffiti from first responders, rescuers \nand recovery workers.\n\nThe last column, the steel cross, the damaged vehicles and the so-called survivors' stairway were all hoisted down \ninto the subterranean museum during the early phases of construction. They could not have been moved in after \nthe completion of the memorial plaza, which doubles as the museum rooftop.\n\nMr. Daniels said Friday that the pumping out of the museum was \"fully under way,\" but that it was still far too early \nto say when construction might resume or, for that matter, when the 9/11 memorial might reopen to the public.\n\n- David W.

The union represents the 6,200 workers at the \nDepartment of Sanitation.\n\n\"Many of our workers have similar problems that these other people have,\" Mr. Nespoli said, referring to the New \nYorkers whose homes have been damaged or destroyed by the storm. \"They have no lights, they have water in the \nbasement, but they're coming to work and doing their jobs.\"\n\n\"They just feel, 'Why are they doing the marathon when they can be helping other people?'\" he said. \"They feel we \nshould be focusing on this particular part of the cleanup and not the marathon.\"\n\nMr. Nespoli  said he understood \"it's a tough call,\" but he said that he, like the members of his union, believed that \nthe residents of the Rockaways, Staten Island and other neighborhoods in distress deserved  priority when it came \nto the use of city resources.\n\nCity officials declined to offer a response. \n\n\"I know this administration is looking to show the public that they can perform,\" Mr. Nespoli said. \"The thing is, I've \nbeen out and the mayor's been out there, too, and I see that people are hurting out there.\"\n\nMr. Nespoli said he expected that his union members, who have been working 12-hour shifts since the storm hit, to \nfollow orders and carry out their assignments.\n\n- William K.

That was an easy decision to make.''\n\nHe said he understood Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's desire to remind the world of New York resilience, but said \nallowing the marathon to proceed as scheduled was \"a bad decision for Staten Island\" and other parts of New York \nthat are experiencing much hardship because of  Hurricane Sandy's furious punch.\n\n\"A race is important,'' he said, \"but not as important as if you have three kids that are sick in need of shelter. We \nhave a guy here who is 101 years old and his son said if you didn't take him in he would have died.\"\n\nMr. Nicotra noted that his hotels were also housing Brendan Marrocco, a quadriplegic veteran whose handicapped-\naccessible house flooded in the storm. \"He had nowhere to go.\" \n\n\n\nWith the full backing of Hilton Garden Inn's corporate president in Memphis, Mr. Nicotra's staff has notified runners \naffected by the hotel's decision. They have been offered makeshift accommodations, like cots in the ballroom, or \nbusing to the race from other hotels, but those being bumped were not all taking the news in stride.\n\n\"The word they use is they're very 'disappointed,'\" Mr. Nicotra said. \"I don't know if I'm  going to get sued, but we \nneed to do what we need to do for our neighbors.\"\n\nOn Friday night, the Hilton Garden's 40,000-square-foot ballroom, which can ordinarily seat 1,000, will be doing \ndouble-duty.\n\nOn one side,  Red Cross workers will be trying to sleep on 50 borrowed cots.

Bloomberg offered an extensive and full-throated defense of his decision to hold the New York \nCity Marathon on Sunday. \"We have to have a city going forward,\" the mayor said, adding, \"New York has to show \nthat we are here, that we are going to recover.\"\n\nMr. Bloomberg said the marathon would use \"a relatively small amount of Sanitation Department resources,\" and \nhe added that there were plenty of police officers available \"who work in areas that aren't affected; we don't take all \nof them and move them into areas that are affected.\" The marathon would \"give people something to cheer about,\" \nthe mayor said. \"It's been a dismal week for a lot of people.\"\n\nBut even as Mr. Bloomberg made his remarks, there were signs that the opposition to the marathon plans were \ncontinuing to grow. The city's public advocate, Bill de Blasio, who had originally supported the mayor's decision, e-\nmailed during the mayor's briefing to say he had changed his mind. \"The needs are simply too great to divert any \nresources from the recovery,\" Mr. de Blasio wrote. \"We need to postpone the marathon and keep our focus where it \nbelongs: on public safety and vital relief operations.\"\n\nAnd Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, who had remained silent on the issue until Friday, also decided \nto weigh in against the plan. \"The decision to move forward with the marathon is not a decision I would have \nmade,\" Ms. Quinn said.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Bloomberg said the city had a responsibility to \"help companies that need the business, to still \ngenerate a tax base,\" and he evoked the example of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's decisions in the months \nafter the 9/11 terror attacks.\n\n\"I think Rudy had it right,\" Mr. Bloomberg said. \"You keep going; you have to do things.

But what did dogs \nactually experience?\n\nAlexandra Horowitz has been considering that question. An associate professor of psychology at Barnard College, \nshe runs a dog cognition lab and is the author of the book, \"Inside of a Dog: What Dogs See, Smell, and Know.\" \nAnd, not surprisingly, as the owner of two large dogs - the mutts Finnegan and Upton - her research often starts in \nthe apartment near Columbia where she lives with her husband and their 3-year-old son.\n\nUpton, for example, who is about 4, is startled by sudden sounds.\n\n\"He knew about the storm before we told him,\" Dr. Horowitz said. \"He could have told us about the storm, if we \nhadn't been paying attention to the news.\"\n\nUpton stopped sitting by the window of their sixth-floor apartment because there were a lot of sudden sounds \nbelow, Dr. Horowitz said. \"It took us a little while to pick up on that.\"\n\nHe also probably paid attention to the increase in sudden gusts of wind that seeped into the apartment through a \nclosed window pane, or the sounds of a random piece of scaffolding dropping on the street, she said.\n\nDogs, Dr. Horowitz said, live in a \"kind of sensory parallel universe, noticing and reacting to things that we cannot \neven detect.\" Much of that, she says, is because of a dog's heightened sense of smell; and she notes that the winds \nthat preceded Hurricane Sandy carried odors.\n\n\"Now, do they know it is a storm coming? No, I mean I don't think they're defining things that way,\"  Dr. Horowitz \nsaid. \"That's our world.\" But they do notice a difference, she said.\n\nDogs with anxious owners may have also become stressed and hyper-vigilant. \"One of dogs' great adaptations is \nthat they look to us to determine how they should act,\" Dr. Horowitz said.\n\nHurricane Sandy has offered dogs one silver lining. As Dr. Horowitz walks Finn and Upton near Riverside Park and \non other familiar routes, she navigates carefully around downed trees, broken branches and leaf effluvia.\n\nWhile humans she meets may have an emotional reaction to a fallen tree, the dogs are sniffing what is to them \"like \nthis new mystery object that's appeared from outer space.\"\n\n\"The first dog that passed marks it - then suddenly it's the new bulletin board for the neighborhood,\" she said.\n\n\nShe added: \"And the dogs and the humans are just having a really different experience at that moment, I think.\"\n\n- Benjamin Weiser \n\n 1:35 P.M. | Bloomberg Takes Softer Line Than Cuomo on Utilities \n\nGov. Andrew M. Cuomo has taken a hard line with state utilities, telling them they could lose their licenses if \nelectrical service is not quickly and efficiently restored. Mayor Bloomberg, who has appeared several times this \nweek with the chief executive of Consolidated Edison, sounds a more sympathetic note. \n\n\"From what we've seen, Con Ed is doing as much work as they possibly can safely,\" the mayor said, adding, \"I \nalways stop when I see a Con Ed worker and say, 'Thank you for taking care of us.'\"\n\n- Michael M.

About 460,000 New Yorkers remain without power, with half in Manhattan, according to the \nmayor. He said that power could return to some parts of Lower Manhattan on Friday afternoon, but that utility \nworkers were being careful to avoid any accidental fires at buildings where electrical equipment may be damaged. \nResidents who live in areas served by overhead lines will have to wait \"a lot longer\" for power to return, Mr. \nBloomberg said.\n\n- Michael M.

Bloomberg is speaking at City Hall, after a morning spent in parts of southern Brooklyn that were \nbadly damaged by Hurricane Sandy. He has changed his outfit from a suit and tie into a shawl-collar sweater.\n\nThe mayor is warning New Yorkers that, even after electricity can be restored, there is a risk of fire in certain \nhomes where electrical equipment remains wet, damaged or underwater. \"We have already seen some cases \nwhere electricity was turned on, there were fires, and we lost some other houses,\" Mr. Bloomberg said, although he \ndid not specify in what areas those fires occurred. He said the city would be cautious about turning on electricity at \nsites where a fire risk remained.\n\n- Michael M. Grynbaum \n\n 12:38 P.M. | Wildlife Officials Debate Evacuation at a Flooded Aquarium \n\n It was a scene out of \"Water World\": thousands of gallons of water in the exhibitions of the New York Aquarium at \nConey Island and, just outside the doors, the Lower Bay of New York Harbor.\n\nDuring Hurricane Sandy, the two met. Sea water poured into the aquarium from the storm surge, flooding the 14-\nacre complex, knocking out power and jeopardizing the sea mammals and fish that rely on intricate filtration \nsystems. On Friday, the Wildlife Conservation Society, which runs the aquarium, was debating whether to evacuate \nsome of the animals to other aquariums in the region.\n\n\"Using generator power, we are making progress toward restoring life-support systems to our aquatic exhibts,\" Jim \nBreheny, executive vice president of the society's zoos and aquarium, said in a statement. \"We are facing a critical \nperiod when we will have to decide if we are going to move some of our animals. We are still working around the \nclock to accomplish what we need to do.\"\n\nStaff members continued to pump water out of the areas that house the critical operating systems. In photographs \nreleased by the society on Thursday, several inches of water still covered the floors of the darkened aquarium as \nlarge fish swam in the eerily lighted exhibits.\n\nQuestions have swirled all week about the fate of Mitik, the orphaned baby walrus that the aquarium acquired last \nmonth from Alaska. The walrus was still being bottle fed and required round-the-clock care when the storm swept \nin. According to a statement from the aquarium, Mitik \"weathered the storm without incident and seemed interested \nand amused by all the activity around him.\"\n\nAquarium officials also reported that the adult walruses, sharks, penguins, sea turtles and seal lions all survived the \nstorm. \"Our fish collection is also doing well as we have been able to maintain temporary life support on our tanks \nand exhibits since we lost power,\" Mr. Breheny said.\n\n- Lisa W.

Craig Fugate, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said that in addition to \ntemporarily lifting the so-called Jones Act rule that normally prohibits foreign-flagged ships from transporting goods \nfrom one United States port to another, federal officials are working with Colonial Pipeline, one of the biggest \npipeline companies in the country, to help get a critical fuel pipeline in the Linden, N.J., area operating again.\n\n\"We are working this as a team,\" Mr. Fugate said Friday morning, in a news conference.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency has also lifted air-pollution rules that normally regulate what kind of gasoline \ncan be sold - different mixes are used at different times of the year to reduce smog - to try to rapidly increase the \nsupply. It is also allowing fuel oil to be used as diesel fuel, Mr. Fugate said.\n\nAs of Friday morning, a conference call was underway led by the Department of Energy with major fuel suppliers to \nsee how many additional ships can come to the East Coast to move fuel, how much additional capacity they can \nprovide and how quickly they can get to New York.\n\nSo far, at least one foreign-flagged tanker is on its way to the New York area from the Gulf Coast, one White House \nofficial said.\n\nFEMA is also trying to work with power companies to try to get electricity back on at gasoline stations in critical \nareas, or to providing generators to these spots - as in many cases it is simply a lack of power that is preventing \nthe sale of gasoline.\n\nOn Thursday, the Department of Defense and the National Guard, using military transport planes, moved about 60 \npower company trucks and other equipment from California to Stewart International Airport, west of Newburgh, \nN.Y., so that they can then be deployed across the New York region.  Utilities trucks had already come to the \nmetropolitan area from the Southeast but crews and trucks from the West were flown in to get them here faster.\n\n- Eric Lipton \n\n 12:28 P.M. | Musicians Reunite With Their Instruments, and the Show Goes on \n\nOn one side of the police barricade at West 57th Street and the Avenue of the Americas: an oboe, a flute, a French \nhorn, a bassoon and two clarinets.\n\nOn the other side stood Max Artved and his students from the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen - \nRagnhildur Josefsdottir, Anne Sophie Jensen, Arvid Larsson, Soren-Filip Hansen and Morten S. Jensen - pleading \nin vain to be reunited with the instruments and baggage they left behind on Monday after they'd checked into the \nSalisbury Hotel, 123 West 57th Street.\n\nThey had been dining at a nearby Italian restaurant Monday when a tower crane boom upended near the top of the \n73-story One57 apartment tower at 157 West 57th Street. They heard a tremendous crash. The next thing they \nknew, firefighters were ordering them out of the restaurant. They ran out into the storm as debris rained down on \nthe street. \"It was like an action movie,\" Mr. Artved said. But when a police officer ordered them off the block \naltogether, it dawned on the visitors that this particular movie wouldn't have a happy ending, at least right away.\n\nThey found new lodging quickly enough, though they had to spend the first night together in one room. And they \nwatched suspiciously as the daily rate increased from $200 a night to $400 a night. They canceled a concert of \nDanish music at Flushing Town Hall. They returned time after time to the barricade, seeking admission to the frozen \nzone. \"We know almost every policeman in New York,\" Mr. Artved said. \"Without going to prison.\"\n\nFinally, on Thursday evening, the Office of Emergency Management and the Police Department allowed residents \nand hotel guests from the frozen zone to return briefly to their buildings, though the boom still hung ominously \noverhead. That meant the musicians would be able at least to show up Friday at the Aaron Copland School of \n\nhttp://www.dkdm.dk/\nhttp://flushingtownhall.org/index.php\nhttp://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/music/\n\n\nMusic at Queens College. There was some anxiety in their rejoicing, as they anticipated the difficulty of performing \nMozart's Serenade No. 10 in B flat major, the \"Gran Partita,\" with their counterparts from Queens College.\n\n\"We haven't been able to play one note since Monday,\" said Ms. Josefsdottir, the flutist. To which Mr. Jensen, one \nof the clarinetists, added, \"Now, we're totally out of shape.\"\n\nThis being New York, however, the show went on. Prof. Edward Smaldone, the director of the Queens College \nmusic school, reported Friday morning that the trans-Atlantic ensemble had successfully convened, though the \ncollege was still without power. In deference to the circumstances, what was to have been a concert became an \nopen rehearsal instead.\n\n\"We have all been inspired to persevere,\" Professor Smaldone said, \"and we will finally get to play today, just a few \nhours before they are due at J.F.K. for their flight home.\"\n\n- David W.

Hotel Owners Won't Kick Out Guests to Accommodate Runners \n\nAs anger percolates over the the decision to hold the New York City Marathon, at least two hotel owners on Staten \nIsland, where the race starts, said they would not kick out those displaced by Hurricane Sandy to accommodate \nrunners who have reserved a room.\n\n\"Our main priority here is to help people in the Staten Island community who have lost their homes to the storm, \nsaid Amit Gandhi, the owner of a Holiday Inn Express.\n\nRichard Nicotra, who owns another hotel, the Hilton Garden Inn, told New York 1 on Thursday that he would not \nask storm victims to leave. \"How do I tell people that have no place to go, that have no home, that have no heat, \nthat you have to leave because I need to make room for somebody that wants to run the marathon? I can't do that,\" \nMr. Nicotra, said.\n\nWith many parts of Staten Island decimated by the storm and many residents lacking the basics, many residents \nand local politicians are furious that marathon organizers are continuing with their plans.\n\nMayor Michael R. Bloomberg said he believed holding the marathon was feasible given the scope of the recovery \nand was a sign of a return to a semblance of normal life in the city.\n\nBut Mr. Gandhi said his first priority had to be the people staying in his hotel whose homes have been destroyed or \nare uninhabitable.\n\n\"We have concerns from our in-house desks who were scheduled to check out due to the marathoners,\" Mr. Gandhi \nsaid. \"But they are here because their houses were destroyed, and we're not going to ask them to leave. Any \ndistressed family, we are extending their stays. With marathoners, we do expect a lot of cancellations. If some \nmarathoners come and we don't have availability, we will do our best to find them another hotel, probably \nsomewhere in New Jersey.\"\n\nAt 2:15 pm Friday, Raymond Kozma, a social worker with Integrity Senior Services, arrived in the lobby of the \nHoliday Inn Express on Staten Island. The agency provides services for seniors at Island Shores senior center in \nthe Midland Beach neighborhood of Staten Island. The center's first floor was flooded, and residents were \nevacuated on Sunday. Kozma came to the hotel to check in on Patricia Quinn, 70, one of the evacuees. Standing in \nthe lobby, Mr. Kozma said to Ms. Quinn, \"Oh, you haven't heard? I don't want to alarm you, but we were told that \nthe hotel would be kicking you out to make room for some marathoners.\"\n\n\"Oh, no.

The United States Coast Guard is meanwhile conducting a damage \nassessment of New York Harbor and its surrounding waterways after reports emerged of gasoline and oil spills in \nthe Arthur Kill near Staten Island and of numerous huge shipping containers blown off vessels into the harbor's \nchannels.\n\nAccording to a statement issued Friday morning by the Coast Guard, the harbor is open to fuel barge and tugboat \ntraffic, but other so-called deep-draft vessels will  be allowed into local waterways only on \"a case-by-case basis in \ncoordination with the Captain of the Port.\" The cruise ship terminals in Manhattan and Bayonne, N.J. are also open \nbut the Brooklyn cruise ship is closed.\n\nJim Pelliccio, the president of the Port Newark Container Terminal, said that several containers in his outdoor \nstorage yard had been tossed around by the wind during the storm and that workers there were trying to get them \nback into place. The power is also out, he said. \"We got hit pretty hard,\" Mr. Pelliccio added.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, a huge surge from Newark Bay inundated a 120-acre lot at Port Newark where thousands of \nnew cars were awaiting shipment, destroying many of them, according to a report by Northjersey.com.

Officials there said Friday that they had brought in crews from around the country to help with the \nrecovery process, but that downed trees and washed-out roads made the work extremely challenging. As of \nThursday evening, LIPA said it had restored power to roughly 490,000 customers on Long Island.\n\nWith frustration building and flooded communities growing more desperate by the day, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo \nraised serious questions about the steps LIPA and other power authorities took to prepare for Hurricane Sandy. Mr. \nCuomo sent a scathing letter to utility companies on Thursday threatening to cancel the state certifications of the \nprivate companies and fire the management.\n\n\"New Yorkers should not suffer because electric utilities did not reasonably prepare for this eventuality,\" Mr. Cuomo \nsaid.\n\n\"With respect to the Long Island Power Authority, I will make every change necessary to ensure it lives up to its \npublic responsibility,\" he said. \"It goes without saying that such failures would warrant the removal of the \nmanagement responsible for such colossal misjudgments.\"\n\nhttp://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/restaurants-jump-into-hurricane-relief-effort/\nhttp://www.livestream.com/newyorkstateofficeofthegovernor\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/28/nyregion/hurricane-sandy.html#sha=b7d14b483\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/28/nyregion/hurricane-sandy.html#sha=b7d14b483\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/28/nyregion/hurricane-sandy.html#sha=c5d4b7366\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/111854766/CuomoLettertoPowerCompanyExecutives-pdf\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/111854766/CuomoLettertoPowerCompanyExecutives-pdf\n\n\n- Sam Dolnick \n\n 11:05 A.M. | Decision to Proceed With Marathon Divides New Yorkers \n\nEmotions on the question of whether the New York City Marathon should go ahead on Sunday, in the aftermath of \nHurricane Sandy, continued to run high, as runners, fans and New Yorkers voiced their opinion on the polarizing \nissue.\n\nBy Friday morning, more than 500 readers had weighed in with comments on            Ken Belson's article about the \ncontinued preparations for the event in the wake of the storm.

For \nthe first time all morning, a line that had been short came to a halt and stretched back along Flatbush Avenue. \nThen it turned onto Dean Street, and doubled back onto Sixth Avenue.\n\nStill, it was a vast improvement over Thursday, when people waited more than three hours here, and no one was \nready to complain just yet. Except, that is, when it came to the walk around the stadium, a detour designed to \ndecongest the bus-loading area that added an unexpected quarter-mile to the morning commute.\n\n\"It's horrendous! It's such a long walk around this Barclays Center,\" said Caroline Young Miller, 60, who works at \nthe Bahamas Consulate General. She was huffing around the stadium with her colleague, Clemmy Eneas-Varence, \n41, who took it all in stride. \"Good exercise this morning!\" she said.\n\n- Annie Correal \n\n 8:07 A.M. | Power to Return to Parts of Manhattan by Tonight, Con Ed Says \n\nFor the first time in five days, power will return to a small sliver of Lower Manhattan, including Wall Street, by \nmidnight Friday, Consolidated Edison officials said. \n\nAnd all of the utility's customers in Manhattan who lost power when Hurricane Sandy barreled into the city should \nexpect to have electricity on Saturday.\n\nBefore the end of the day on Friday, power is expected to be restored to the most southeastern tip of Manhattan, \nsaid Alfonso Quiroz, a Con Ed spokesman, an area roughly south of Frankfort Street, which parallels the approach \nto the Brooklyn Bridge. In that area, customers east of Broadway will have electricity, but those west of Broadway \nwill be restored by Saturday, although some customers there already have power, he said.\n\nThe area encompasses customers who had been served by the two networks taken out preemptively by the utility \nduring the storm.\n\nStill, not all customers in Manhattan may get power back on Saturday, said Allan Drury, another Con Ed \nspokesman. Damaged equipment could delay full restoration, he said. \n\n\"Some customers may have had damage to their equipment and cannot accept service,\" Mr. Drury said.\n\nAnd he said customers in the other boroughs will have to wait longer for their power to resume.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/realestate/after-hurricane-sandy-would-you-buy-on-the-waterfront.html#p5\n\n\nManhattan is served by underground lines, which makes the resumption of power easier. About 226,000 customers \ndo not currently have service in Manhattan, from an area roughly south of 40th street on the east side and from \nabout 34th Street on the west side of the island.\n\nA vast majority of customers in the other boroughs will have power again by the weekend of Nov. 10, Mr. Drury \nsaid. Those customers depend on overhead lines that are harder to fix.\n\nWhile the numbers change quickly, customers still without electricity as of Friday morning are as follows:\n\nQueens, 84,000\n\nStaten Island 54,000\n\nBrooklyn: 35,000\n\nBronx 31,000 \n\n- Christine Hauser \n\n 8:08 A.M. | Tell Us About Your Commute \n\nWe are collecting your transit stories this morning.

They were pressed into the zigzag of \nbarricades by police officers and walked at a very quick pace, some of them even breaking into a run as they tried \nto move toward the front of what was suddenly becoming a very long line. \n\nFriends met in line; one man carried a miniature Chihuahua in a pouch hanging from his chest. There were a few \nsmiles, and many a thumbs-up for the police officers. \"Much better than yesterday, \" one man said before he got \nonto the bus.

Transit Rail Service Will Resume on Friday \n\nNew Jersey Transit rail service, which has been suspended since Hurricane Sandy, will resume limited service on \nFriday, Gov. Chris Christie announced Thursday night.

Andrew M. Cuomo said progress was being made on every front to recover from Hurricane Sandy, but he \ncautioned that there were great challenges ahead.\n\nMr. Cuomo warned vendors of critical supplies, including gasoline, not to take advantage of the situation.\n\n\"Do not try and gouge New Yorkers,\" he said at a news conference Thursday evening. \"And don't try and take \nadvantage of New Yorkers.\"\n\nThe governor said that he believed 99.9 percent of businesses and service providers had been acting responsibly, \nas nerves grow more and more frayed with each passing hour for people with no power. But he added that the state \nwould not tolerate anyone exploiting the situation.\n\nThe most visible sign of progress for many New Yorkers will be the lights coming on at the World Trade Center \nconstruction site, where work was to resume Thursday evening.\n\nGiven the extent of the flooding at the site, Mr. Cuomo said that it was rather amazing that construction was up and \nrunning so soon.\n\nHe marveled at \"seeing the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel turn into a flume\" and \"water cascading\" into the site at \"such a \ndecibel level is was disorientating,\" to now, just a few days later, the site once again largely returned to normal.\n\nNew Yorkers \"will see lights at that site again tonight,\" Mr. Cuomo said.\n\n\"New York goes back to work.\"\n\nThere was also incremental progress in restoring the transit system. In addition to the growing services on the train \nand subway systems, the governor said, one tunnel in the Holland Tunnel would be open for buses Friday morning.\n\n\"Leave the car at home,\" he said. \"Take the bus.\"\n\nThe most pressing problem for many New Yorkers remained the power failures.\n\n\n\nMr. Cuomo did not provide new details on when service would be restored, but he said that he believed the utility \ncompanies were \"working very hard to restore the power.\"\n\nStill, he said, best efforts are not enough for most people.\n\nIt is a binary question, he said: \"I have power or I don't have power.\"\n\nTo that end, he reminded the utilities that they rely on the state for licensing and other important matters and if it \nappeared they were not performing, actions could be taken.\n\n\"If the state believed they were not diligent,\" he said, the companies \"could lose money and certification.\"\n\nAs New Yorkers start to seek assistance in rebuilding, the governor said, the state was trying to prevent the process \nfrom becoming a bureaucratic nightmare.\n\nHe also announced a toll-free number - 1-800-NYSANDY (1-800-697-2639) - that would begin fielding questions \nfrom residents Friday morning to help guide them in claiming funds.\n\nFinally, Mr. Cuomo, reflecting on the entire disaster, talked about how water helped make New York City great and \nhow it now had become a weapon that had crippled it.\n\nThis \"little sliver of land,\" he said, is so solid that it allowed people to build \"15, 20, 30 stories below the surface.\"\n\nThat whole honeycomb of construction is what allows the city to prosper, \"until your greatest strength becomes you \ngreatest weakness.\"\n\nHe said he believed that storms like Hurricane Sandy would become more common as the climate changes and \nthat New York needed to prepare.\n\n\"I don't accept, 'Well, don't worry about it; it is never going to happen again,'\" he said.\n\n- Marc Santora \n\n 7:24 P.M. | More Subway Service Restored \n\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced some new additions to its list of returning train service on \nThursday night.\n\nSome M train service was restored earlier on Thursday between Jamaica and 34th Street, the authority said. By \nmidnight, the authority expected No. 7 trains to run from Main Street to 74th Street in Queens. And the authority's \nchairman, Joseph J. Lhota, said at a news briefing Thursday night that once power is restored in Lower Manhattan, \nservice on No. 4 and 5 trains can return between Manhattan and Brooklyn.\n\nRelated: Updates on Subway Service in New York City\n\n- Matt Flegenheimer \n\n 7:09 P.M. | Pumping Water From Subway Tunnels  \n\nAt a briefing on Thursday evening, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the Metropolitan \nTransportation Authority, described the daunting task of pumping water out of transit tunnels before power can be \nturned back on to get the entire subway system back in operation. \n\nThe M.T.A. released video of pumping at the flooded South Ferry station on Thursday.\n\nVideo of water being pumped out of the flooded subway station at South Ferry in Lower Manhattan on Thursday.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/11/01/nyregion/subway-service-in-new-york-city.html\nhttp://youtu.be/xS7x9UGx5n4\nhttp://youtu.be/xS7x9UGx5n4\n\n\nMr. Cuomo also described the scale of the task ahead to restore all transportation links, including clearing out a \nmile of water in the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, known officially as the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel in memory of a former \ngovernor, and about five miles of water in the PATH tubes that connect Manhattan to New Jersey along the Hudson \nriverbed.\n\n- Robert Mackey \n\n 5:57 P.M. | Fuel Shortage Could Make Taxis Even Harder to Come By \n\nWith a gas shortage besetting commuters across the region, even nondrivers could feel the pain on Friday. David \nS. Yassky, the city's taxi commissioner, said the shortage \"will definitely reduce\" the number of cabs on Friday if \nmore fuel does not become available.\n\nGov. Andrew M. Cuomo said that New York Harbor had been reopened, which he expected would help bolster the \nfuel supply.\n\n- Matt Flegenheimer \n\n 5:37 P.M. | Casinos in Atlantic City to Remain Closed for Now \n\nGov. Chris Christie said Thursday that there was no timetable for when the casinos in Atlantic City, which were not \nsignificantly damaged by Hurricane Sandy, might be reopened. \n\nMr. Christie said a number of logistical problems remained: power had not been restored to all of Atlantic City, and \nresidents were still being advised to boil their water because the storm had imperiled the city's water treatment \nsystem. But the governor said once those issues were resolved, he hoped to get the casinos back up and running.\n\n\"I certainly don't want to keep them closed a minute longer than I have to,\" the governor said, \"because that costs \nthem in terms of revenue and it costs the state in terms of revenue.\"\n\nThe casinos have been closed since Sunday, when the governor ordered them to shut down.\n\n- Thomas Kaplan \n\n 4:48 PM | Utility Workers From 12 States Heading to New Jersey \n\nGov. Chris Christie said Thursday afternoon that the governors of 12 other states had agreed to send utility workers \nto New Jersey to help restore power, including 1,500 from Virginia and 700 from Ohio. \n\nAt a news briefing, Mr. Christie said President Obama had offered to provide large transport aircraft to ferry the \nutility workers' equipment to New Jersey if it would take too long to drive to the state. \n\nAbout 1.8 million households in New Jersey remained without power as of midday, Mr. Christie said, down from \njust over 2 million on Wednesday night.\n\n- Thomas Kaplan \n\n 5:05 P.M. | Less Severe Storm Could Arrive Next Week \n\nGiven the frayed nerves of many in the region just raked by Hurricane Sandy, and of political operatives around the \ncountry, 13 words at the top of an extended forecast discussion issued on Thursday by the National Weather \nService's Hydrometeorological Prediction Center in College Park, Md., set off some alarm. Those words were the \nsummary near the top of the preliminary forecast, which read:\n\nNOR'EASTER POSSIBLE FOR MID-ATLANTIC/NEW ENGLAND STATES BY ELECTION DAY INTO NEXT \nTHURSDAY\n\nhttp://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=preepd&version=0&fmt=reg\n\n\nThe forecast suggests that a deep cyclone moving down the west coast of Canada could set the conditions for a \nstorm that would bring rain and wind, though not nearly as severe as the one from the past week to the \nnortheastern United States in the early to middle of next week.\n\nAs Jason Samenow explains on The Washington Post's weather blog,            the European Centre for Medium-\nRange Weather Forecasts model, \"which snuffed out Sandy eight days before it hit, shows an area of low pressure \ndeveloping off the Georgia/South Carolina coast the night of the election (November 6), and then moving up the \ncoast into New England by Wednesday night.\"\n\nDan Hofmann, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said the possible storm appears to be \"at this \npoint, a week out,\" looks like it would arrive \"more like the middle of the week,\" than on Election Day.\n\n- Robert Mackey \n\n 4:58 P.M. | Death Toll in U.S. and Canada Now at 93 \n\nThe total death toll from the storm in the United States and Canada has climbed to 93 as of 3:45 p.m.\n\nHere are the state-by-state totals, reported by Reuters.\n\n\u2022 New York State: 46 (38 in New York City)\n\n\u2022 New Jersey: 12\n\n\u2022 Maryland: 11\n\n\u2022 Pennsylvania: 9\n\n\u2022 West Virginia: 6\n\n\u2022 Connecticut: 4\n\n\u2022 Virginia: 2\n\n\u2022 North Carolina: 2\n\n\u2022 Ontario: 1\n\nHurricane Sandy also killed at least 69 people in the Caribbean, including at least 54 in Haiti and 11 in Cuba.\n\n- The New York Times \n"}
