{"title": "ILLEGAL ALIEN EXPULSIONS SPIKE UP IN 4TH QUARTER", "body": "\nWASHINGTON Immigration authorities said yesterday that 18,988 illegal aliens were deported in formal \nproceedings in the last three months of 1996, a 24% hike over the same period a year earlier.\n\nMore than half the aliens were deported because of criminal records. Immigration and Naturalization Service \nGeneral Counsel David Martin said an expansion of INS detention facilities helped increase the removal of criminal \naliens by 31%.\n\nThe INS said another 20,866 aliens gave up fighting deportation before their cases reached a formal conclusion \nand left voluntarily during the period.\n\nMartin said stepped-up enforcement \"will make a substantial dent in the growth\" of the illegal alien population, \nwhich the INS estimated at 5 million.\n"}
