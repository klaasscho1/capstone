{"title": "HUNDREDS AT NYU FIND GOP 'IMMIG HUNT' AWFUL", "body": "\nMAYBE THEY should have stuck to beer pong.\n\nNYU's College Republicans drew 11 players to their \"Find the Illegal Immigrant\" stunt yesterday - and 300 angry \nprotesters.\n\n\"It's a mock lynching,\" said 20-year-old junior Miranda Siegel, one of the demonstrators at the Greenwich Village \ncampus.\n\nThe protesters showed up with signs including one that read: \"Deport College Republicans.\" They chanted and \nmarched in a circle on Washington Place, calling the game racist.\n\nEven Mayor Bloomberg weighed in.\n\n\"Sometimes, and this is clearly a case, they [college students] do something that is not only distasteful but is just \ndownright stupid,\" he said. \"I think that is the nicest thing you can say about it.\"\n\nThe contestants didn't hunt an actual immigrant, but club secretary Cait Kannal, who wore a sign reading: \"Hello, \nI'm an Illegal Immigrant.\"\n\nThe winner was sophomore Fraser Dachille, 20, of Baltimore, a GOP club member who collected a $50 gift \ncertificate to an unnamed retailer.\n\nThe GOP group defended the event as a way to draw attention to illegal immigration.\n\n\"This is a productive dialogue,\" said club President Sarah Chambers, a 21-year-old political science major from St. \nLouis. \"I guarantee you, if we had a debate about the issue, all of these people would not be here.\"\n\nNora Poiv, the 21-year-old senior who heads NYU's Democratic club, said the Republicans shot down a recent \ninvitation to discuss immigration in a panel format.\n\n\"The way they approached this was dehumanizing,\" Poiv said.\n\nmjaccarino@nydailynews.com\n"}
