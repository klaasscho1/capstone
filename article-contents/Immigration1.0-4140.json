{"title": "Making Mexicans His Mission", "body": "\nTHE security guard stared dully at the Mexican passport and shook his head no. He wasn't letting anyone into the \ndetention center without a local address on his ID. Brother Joel Magallan, a Jesuit and self-appointed defender of \nNew York's Mexicans, smiled at the guard. It was a passive smile, but his eyes conveyed an inner resolve as cool \nas the mountain wind that blows in Zacatecas, his hometown in Mexico.\n\n\"The rules change each week, no?\" said Brother Joel, who had used his passport to get into the detention center \nthree times before. \"What is your name?\" he asked the guard. \"I wish to see a supervisor.\"\n\nThe mood was ugly in the white concrete waiting room of the Elizabeth Detention Facility in Elizabeth, N.J., where \nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service takes illegal aliens who have been arrested. A line of people was waiting \nto see detainees on a raw Saturday in March; they did not appreciate having to wait for Brother Joel's passport to \nbe cleared by a supervisor.\n\nBrother Joel did not know the three young men he was coming to see. Their uncle, an illegal alien who didn't want \nto risk a visit, had called him. The young men had been handcuffed in Newark Airport, straight off a flight from \nCalifornia on an unlucky Friday the 13th. The eldest was barely 21. They were from a Mexican village where the \nonly work is digging salt out of the earth and selling it. Now they were imprisoned.\n\n\"Most of the Mexican people in New York are in the beginning of establishing this life here,\" Brother Joel said, \nfinally walking through the sliding steel doors. \"Right now we say that they are not a Mexican community, they are \njust Mexicans. My goal is to make them be a community.\"\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church sent Brother Joel to New York last July to help the city's Mexican immigrants do just \nthat. The brother, who wears blue jeans and keeps a beeper and cell phone handy, spends his days meeting \nMexicans. He is organizing flower vendors in East Harlem into a cooperative and talking to teen-agers about \navoiding gangs. Above all, he is trying to get Mexicans to join the Asociacion Tepeyac, with 30 branches already in \nchurches around the city. The club's 300 members help Mexicans with everything from immigration problems to \nforming soccer teams.\n\n\nBrother Joel, 40, is a quiet man, yet he has run afoul of some important people. He has offended some priests, who \nresent his presence in their churches. He has accused the I.N.S. of picking on Mexicans and the Mexican \nConsulate of not doing enough to help them; both deny his charges.\n\n\"He is mostly very shy,\" said one of Brother Joel's sisters, Emma Yabira Magallan, speaking in Spanish from her \nhome in Monterrey, Mexico. \"But he can also be very strong when there is a problem. He likes to fight.\"\n\nTo spend time with Brother Joel is to enter the complex world of Mexican New York. Estimates of the number of \nMexican immigrants vary widely. Although one census survey put the number at close to 100,000 in 1996, Robert \nC. Smith, a Barnard professor and the director of the Mexican Migration Project at Columbia University, figures \nthere are some 200,000. About half have arrived since 1990, he said. And about half are illegal aliens.\n\nYet New York doesn't have a single Mexican neighborhood. One reason, Professor Smith said, is that Mexicans \nhave moved into predominantly Hispanic areas. Because many are illegal immigrants, they tend to lie low. Many \nare also young and plan to go home eventually.\n\nAs Brother Joel sees it, the Mexicans need the protection of a united community. \"Right now they are alone,\" he \nsaid. \"If they come together they can use their talents to help each other.\"\n\nThe Rev. Bill Harder, a priest who ministers to Mexicans on Staten Island, said: \"It is essential for the Mexicans to \nhave a friend like Brother Joel. They have to recognize that they have power as a community and don't just have to \nsuffer.\"\n\n \n\nFalling Wages For the Sweat of Their Brows\n\n Inside the Elizabeth detention center, Brother Joel sat across from a young man in a tan prison smock. Separated \nby Plexiglas, they spoke through crackling telephones. The young man was frail, with a wispy mustache. He tried to \npull a brave face, but tears were storming his brown eyes. \"I just want to go back to Mexico,\" he said. \"It's too hard \nhere.\"\n\nMany other Mexicans in New York are also having a tough time, although a middle class is emerging. The men \ntypically do construction work or cut vegetables in grocery stores. Many of the women tend babies or work in \nfactories. The threat of deportation is constant. Advocacy groups say Mexicans often receive what amounts to \nslave wages, as well as beatings and other forms of mistreatment at work.\n\n\"We help the Latino community in general,\" said Monica Santana, the director of the Latino Workers Center in the \nEast Village. \"But 80 percent of the abuse cases that come in are from Mexicans.\"\n\nProfessor Smith said: \"They are having a hard time. And the Mexicans who are coming today are having a harder \ntime than the immigrants who came in before.\"\n\nWeekday mornings at dawn, about 50 Mexican men in dusty sweatshirts and baseball caps appear along Port \nRichmond Avenue on Staten Island, where they wait for contractors to pick them up for day labor. A few years ago \nthey got $10 an hour, they said, but with so many new Mexicans arriving, the going rate is now around $5.\n\n\"The Mexicans are viewed as a commodity,\" said Father Harder, the pastor of St. Mary of the Assumption Church \nin Port Richmond. \"People bargain for their work. It kind of makes you angry.\"\n\nOn a recent rainy morning, some of the men were complaining about falling wages. Most were under 20 and living \nalone without family, sleeping where they could and sending home around $200 a month. Many of the newest \namong them do not even speak Spanish. They speak Mixteco, one of Mexico's 100 or so Indian languages.\n\n\"It is so hard if you don't have Spanish or English,\" said a 17-year-old who gave his name as Margarito and said \nSpanish was his second language. \"The boss can pay you even less. Sometimes they pay as little as $30 for a \nday.\"\n\n\n\nLike Margarito, most of the local Mexicans come from a region of Mexico called the Mixteca. It is a dry, empty \nplace a few hundred miles south of Mexico City that encompasses parts of three Mexican states, Puebla, Oaxaca \nand Guererro.\n\nFather Harder said he had not been aware of the Mixtecos until Brother Joel pointed them out. Now the priest is \ntrying to work with them. \"They keep their problems inside and take whatever the boss gives them,\" the priest said. \n\"They feel helpless.\"\n\nMost Mixtecos who live in New York are from Puebla. Professor Smith attributes this to the arrival in the city of \nFermin and Pedro Simon, two brothers from Mixteca who were driven from Mexico City by a vacationing New \nYorker in 1942. These two, Professor Smith said, paved the way for the Mexican migration to New York.\n\nIn the 1980's, when Mexico experienced a depression, La Mixteca poured into New York. A 1986 law allowed some \nto gain citizenship and bring their families. Many Mexicans now live in the South Bronx; Jackson Heights, Queens; \nEast Harlem, and Sunset Park, Brooklyn, as well as on Staten Island and in northern New Jersey and the Hudson \nValley. But as relative newcomers, many say they often feel unwelcome.\n\nTension filled the rectory of Blessed Sacrament Church in Jackson Heights, Queens, last month. Four Mexican \nwomen sat stiffly around a mahogany table as the Rev. Jesus Cuadros lectured them in Spanish. Brother Joel was \nthere, as was Msgr. Raymond W. Kutner.\n\nFather Cuadros, who is of Colombian descent, was angry at the women because a Dec. 12 Mass in celebration of \nthe Virgin of Guadalupe had been marred when a mariachi band failed to show up. The priest was also irritated that \nthe Mexicans weren't coming to church regularly.\n\nBrother Joel made the women's case to the priests. Despite the problems last year, the Mexicans wanted to \ncontinue to celebrate the Virgin with mariachis. They wanted more freedom to practice Mexican dance at the church \nand they wanted to make official prayer visits to other Mexicans. The priests grumbled but agreed.\n\nA few weeks later, Maria Cortez, who had called the meeting, said that things were better. \"The Mexican people \nhere saw that they weren't working hard enough,\" she said. \"And the priests saw that they would work harder.\"\n\nAbout the same time, Monsignor Kutner said he was surprised to hear that the Mexicans felt unwelcome. His \nparish is about 80 percent Hispanic, he said, and although most members are Dominican, he loves the Mexicans. \n\"The Mexican people are so sweet,\" he said. \"We love working with them.\" It had been his idea to have the \nGuadalupe Mass, he said, and in his opinion, the problem lay not within the parish, but with Brother Joel.\n\n\"I saw him coming in as a rabble-rouser,\" Monsignor Kutner said.\n\nBrother Joel's sister Emma remembers him not as a rabble-rouser, but as a studious fellow. He is the eldest of nine \nchildren raised in an old colonial silver-mining town, some 400 miles northwest of Mexico City, by parents with \nstrong religious and political convictions. Brother Joel's father was a postman. His mother was an organizer for the \nNational Action Party, an opposition party in a country that has had single-party rule for decades. In 1992, his \nmother was running for mayor of a small town when she was killed in a car wreck. Brother Joel suspects her \npolitical opponents of foul play.\n\nAfter attending college on scholarship, Brother Joel became the engineer of a tire factory. He was making good \nmoney, but he was troubled. \"I began to see a lot of injustice,\" he said. \"The minimum wages were so low that \npeople who worked hard couldn't pay their expenses.\" One day, he said, he submitted a report that led his boss to \ndismiss a group of people to save money.\n\nHe decided it was time to change his life, and at 23, committed himself to the Jesuits. He could have become a \npriest, but he decided instead to become a brother, which meant taking the vows of poverty, chastity and obedience \nbut not being able to give the sacraments.\n\n\n\n\"People look to priests to baptize them and give them communion,\" he explained. \"That is not what I wanted to do. I \nlike to be in the process to educate people.\"\n\nIn 1994 the Jesuits sent Brother Joel to Chicago to study English and education. At the same time, priests in New \nYork had formed a group to address the problems they were seeing among the increasing numbers of Mexican \nimmigrants. They asked John Cardinal O'Connor, the Archbishop of New York, to bring in a Mexican cleric to help. \nBrother Joel was chosen by church authorities for the task.\n\nNow he lives in a Jesuit boarding house on 98th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue and works with \nan assistant out of a small office on West 14th Street. A warm but slightly distant man who rarely prays in public, he \nlikes to walk, especially where he can see trees. Sometimes he accepts dinner invitations from Mexicans he has \nmet in New York, but his best friends are religious people back in Mexico. He misses them.\n\n\"I also am missing the mountains,\" he said. \"There are no mountains around here.\"\n\n \n\nA Cold War With the Mexican Consulate\n\n Over a recent lunch of pepperoni pizza in an apartment in Newburgh, N.Y., with a holographic image of the Last \nSupper above their heads, six women were discussing their arrests with Brother Joel. Most were out on bail and will \nhave to leave the country soon. Many vowed to return.\n\n\"I feel discouraged,\" said Lilia Herrera, 40. \"It is the same for all of us. This is so frustrating it kills the will.\"\n\nAs the women recalled, on Feb. 26, about 20 I.N.S. agents burst into a guitar-string factory in Newburgh, 60 miles \nnorth of Manhattan. The agents handcuffed workers, the women said, and took them to the Elizabeth detention \ncenter. One woman was pregnant; a few were supposed to pick up children at day care.\n\n\"We weren't given food all night and all day for 22 hours,\" said Maricela Perfecto, 28. \"Someone called for water, \nand she was told to drink it out of the toilet.\"\n\nLynn Durko, a spokeswoman for the detention center, said that no inmate would be left that long without food and \nthat no one would have spoken to the women that way.\n\nAlthough Brother Joel counsels many people on immigration issues, he isn't in favor of Mexicans moving to the \nUnited States, legally or illegally. \"They are losing their roots,\" he said. But he also maintains that Mexicans who \ncome illegally are not criminals. Rather, he says, they are driven by poverty so extreme that the law does not \nmatter to them, and they should not be mistreated.\n\nBrother Joel maintains that I.N.S. raids often include verbal and physical attacks and unnecessary use of restraints, \nand that the conditions in detention centers are poor. Some experts on immigration say the problems are a result of \nnegative public attitudes toward illegal aliens and the strict 1996 Immigration Reform Act.\n\n\"This is inevitably what will happen when you criminalize these people,\" said James Haggerty, a lawyer for the \nCatholic Immigration Network's office in New York. \"There isn't a policy of abuse, but the goal is to spread fear.\"\n\nBrother Joel also claims that the I.N.S. targets Mexicans, although they make up a relatively small percentage of \nillegal aliens in New York. He and the I.N.S. disagree on the numbers, but many immigrant advocates say the \nagency's methods do, in fact, lead to the arrest of more Hispanic than European aliens.\n\n\"Their efforts are directed toward organizations where they perceive there to be large numbers of undocumented \nworkers,\" said Margie McHugh, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition. \"That has resulted in the \ntargeting of Latinos.\"\n\nBut Mark Thorn, an I.N.S. spokesman, strongly denied that Mexicans are being singled out, and described agency \nraids -- which he calls \"operations\" -- as \"civil\" and \"professional.\"\n\n\n\n\"We have no knowledge of the ethnic makeup of the work force in the businesses where we conduct our \noperations,\" he said. \"We are not targeting any ethnic group. Our focus, by law, is on the management of those \nbusinesses.\"\n\nImmigration issues have also led to a cold war between Brother Joel and the Mexican Consulate. In the fall he sent \nthe consulate a letter accusing it of failing to do all it could to help illegal immigrants. \"We would like to have \narrested people free as soon as possible after the raids,\" he said. \"The Mexican Consulate, sometimes they aren't \nready to help people.\"\n\nJorge Pinto, the Consul General, replied that he has five people working full time on immigration issues. \"We are \nnot aware at this point of any lack of attention from the consulate,\" he said. \"I think it is sad to have blanket \naccusations.\"\n\nAt the detention center in Elizabeth, Brother Joel and the young man in the tan prison smock sat, silently looking at \neach other. Brother Joel needed to get back to the city, to see other people. He was trying to build a community. \nThe young man had nothing to do except cool his heels until he could see a judge. Then, in all likelihood, he would \nbe sent back to the tough life of his village.\n\nFinally, Brother Joel got up and pantomimed a handshake, pretending that there was no Plexiglas between him and \nthe young man. It was a throwaway gesture, but for the first time that morning, the young man smiled.\n\n\"Think back to when the Polish people or the Irish people came here,\" Brother Joel said a few weeks later. \"They \ncame with priests, leaders, and they made the next step in the United States. They were working together. We don't \nhave that. The leaders are still in Mexico. The people here are disorganized. We need to help them help each other, \none person at a time.\"\n\n \n\nVirgin of Guadalupe: A Link to Home\n\n The Virgin of Guadalupe is Mexico's patron saint, and when her feast day is celebrated on Dec. 12, there is \nmariachi music in the country's churches, and people take the day off.\n\nLegend has it that in 1531, the Virgin Mary appeared three times to an Aztec peasant, Juan Diego. It was 10 years \nafter the Spanish had conquered the Aztec empire, and the Virgin, who appeared with dark skin, told Diego that she \nloved native people, not just the Spanish.\n\n\"The importance of the Virgin of Guadalupe is that it managed to combine the European with the non-European and \nbecome a symbol of nationality,\" said Roberto Gonzalez Echevarria, a professor of comparative literature at Yale \nUniversity, who is of Cuban descent.\n\nThe hilltop where the Virgin and Diego met was called Tepeyac, and Brother Joel has used that name for the \nMexican association he is organizing, which he hopes will be a rallying point for Mexicans in the city. Each of its \nbranches is called a \"Guadalupano Association.\"\n\n\"We asked the people to vote on what name they wanted for the clubs,\" Brother Joel said. \"They chose this one.\"\n\nTo celebrate the feast day of the Virgin in New York, Brother Joel and the Archdiocese of New York are planning a \nparade of Mexicans on Dec. 12 that will end at St. Patrick's Cathedral.\n\n\"We would like all Mexicans here to take that day off,\" Brother Joel said.\n\nProfessor Gonzalez said that as important as the Virgin is in Mexico, she may be even more powerful a symbol to \nMexicans living abroad.\n\n\"The Virgin is an important link to their country,\" he said.
