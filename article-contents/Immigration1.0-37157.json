The family will stay \nwith friends at an unknown location, he said.\n\nU.S. immigration officials in Miami could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nValdez said the embassy had no information about Stroessner himself, who flew to Brazil after being overthrown by \nGen. Andres Rodriquez on Feb. 3.\n\n''We don't have anything official'' on Stroessner's plans, he said.\n\nAsked what Stroessner's family plans to do in Florida, Valdez said they would act as tourists and do ''nothing \nspecial.''\n\nStroessner had ruled the tiny, landlocked South American nation of 4.5 million people for more than three decades \nbefore his ouster. He left Paraguay for Brazil on Feb. 6 with one son.\n\nAnother son, Alfredo Stroessner, his wife, Marta Rodriguez de Stroessner, and their daughter apparently did not \narrive with other family members Friday, Valdez said. He said he had no information on their whereabouts.\n"}
