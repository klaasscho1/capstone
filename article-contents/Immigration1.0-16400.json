Patrick J. Leahy (D., Vt.), who along with Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R., Utah) sponsored \nthe bill in the Senate, said it updated the charter of Justice's Office of Special Investigations, which was set up in \n1979 to prosecute and remove Nazi war criminals who sought refuge in this country. The new law will allow \nJustice to investigate other war criminals, as well.\n\n\"Now we can pursue the new generations of war criminals and human-rights abusers,\" Leahy said in a statement.\n\nRep. Mark Foley (R., Fla.), who sponsored the bill in the House with Rep. Gary L. Ackerman (D., N.Y.), said 800 to \n1,000 war criminals and human-rights abusers sought refuge in the United States every year from such countries \nas Haiti, Honduras, North Korea, Rwanda and Cuba.\n\n\"The United States is currently home to many immigrants who fled torture in their home countries,\" Foley said in a \nstatement.\n\n\"What many people don't know is that their torturers also come here to live,\" he said.\n\nThe measure expands the scope of immigrants subject to deportation and denial of entry to those who have \nengaged in torture, genocide and religious persecution.\n"}
