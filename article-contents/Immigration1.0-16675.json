{"title": "Hiding the Refugee Problem Offshore", "body": "\nThe harrowing scenes we've seen recently of desperate African families adrift on rusting boats in the Mediterranean \npoint to the urgent need for Europe to settle on a common policy for handling the asylum seekers, refugees and \nillegal immigrants who risk everything to escape their wretched homelands. This global problem requires more than \nthe old answer of shoving the ones who make it past the borders into a shadowy existence, and warehousing the \nrest.\n\n Germany and Italy have called for setting up processing centers in North African countries like Libya, Tunisia and \nMorocco to screen prospective refugees from Africa, the Middle East and Asia. This troubling proposal is driven in \npart by a rising populist backlash against asylum seekers in these two countries. Without any clear understanding \non how these camps would function -- especially in countries not known for their protection of human rights, and in \nthe absence of a common European policy on refugees -- this is a bad idea. This week, it encountered firm \nresistance from France and Spain, whose new center-left government has been far more welcoming toward all \nforms of immigration than its conservative predecessor. A similar suggestion recently came from the interior \nministers from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria and Slovakia. They expressed concern about Chechen and other \nrefugees and proposed setting up transit camps in Ukraine. Understandably, the Ukrainian government bridled at \nthe suggestion, not least because nobody sought its opinion. \n\n It's obvious that those who enter Europe illegally pose a serious problem, as they do in the United States. Many of \nthem live outside the legal and social framework of the country they're in. But this problem can't be solved by \noutsourcing it.\n\n Refugees who end up in foreign transit camps are likely to face long stretches of what is effectively detention, quite \npossibly in nasty conditions. Libya, in particular, has an appalling record of forcibly sending asylum seekers back to \ncountries like Eritrea and Sudan, where they face certain persecution.\n\n It's possible that properly designed, managed and monitored transit centers could be part of an eventual solution. \nBut the more urgent task is for Europe to agree on a common asylum policy, which should recognize that asylum \nseekers have the right to full protection until their cases have been heard.\n\n The European Union should also streamline legal immigration procedures. That could help offset the looming labor \nshortages and pension crises that are otherwise likely to result from the sharp fall in birthrates in several of \nEurope's largest economies. Until these policies are in place, transit camps are just a place to hide the problem.                                            \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
