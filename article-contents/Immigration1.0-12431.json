{"title": "Conviction in kidnap of debtor;An A.C. man accused of loan-sharking abducted a gambler who didn't pay up, a federal jury decided.", "body": "\nA federal jury yesterday convicted an Atlantic City man of loan-sharking and kidnapping a man who had failed \nto keep up his high-interest payments.\n\nChang Ping Lin, 34, was found guilty of kidnapping, conspiracy to kidnap, making extortionate extensions of \ncredit, and collecting extensions of credit by extortion.\n\nLin, an undocumented immigrant under detention by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, could face life in \nprison and $1 million in fines or deportation back to China. His sentencing was set for Jan. 17.\n\nAfter the verdict, Deputy U.S. Attorney Lee A. Solomon said, \"Obviously, we will seek the appropriate punishment,\" \nmost likely deportation, after Lin's federal prison sentence.\n\nLin, a gambler who also had addresses in New York and Philadelphia, was accused of lending Feng Bin Ho, 24, a \nconstruction worker living in Queens, N.Y., $20,000 at an interest rate of $100 a day for each $1,000 borrowed. The \ntransaction took place in February while Ho was on the losing end of a gambling binge in Atlantic City.\n\nAfter receiving telephone calls and threats, Ho paid back much of the money, but Lin still sought several thousand \ndollars in interest. As a result, according to the government, Lin kidnapped Ho from New York on March 25 and \nheld him in an Atlantic City house for nearly two days. Ho escaped out a third-floor window and contacted police.\n\nLin's defense sought to discredit the government's case and Ho's credibility. Lawyer Lawrence Dubin of New York \ncalled Ho \"a degenerate gambler\" who was heavily in debt, and said he had made up the story.\n\nContact Rita Giordano at 856-779-3841 and rgiordano@phillynews.com.  \n"}
