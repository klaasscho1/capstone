{"title": "29 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE ARRESTED IN AREA", "body": "\nIn arrests that took more than a year to pull off, the Immigration and Naturalization Service in St. Louis \napprehended 29 illegal immigrants from India working at hotels and doughnut shops in the area.\n\nNow, the same INS officials are trying to find who helped smuggle the people into St. Louis, allegedly by escorting \nthem past checkpoints or selling them fraudulent identification.\n\n\"We believe all of them had help,\" Chester Moyer, St. Louis INS officer in charge, said Monday. \"We also believe \nsome of them paid very high prices for this help. We want to know how they got here, how they obtained the \ndocuments and who they were associated with.\"\n\nDuring a two-day period earlier this month, INS officials pulled 15 illegal immigrants from their jobs at three \ndoughnut shops: one on Dorsett Road in Maryland Heights, one on Olive Boulevard in Creve Coeur and one on \nFlorissant Road in Dellwood.\n\nIn addition, officials apprehended a total of 10 people from two hotels in St. Louis and one in Centralia, Ill. Officials \nfound four more illegal immigrants at apartments in Creve Coeur and Maryland Heights.\n\nMoyer said his office had spent more than a year interviewing everyone from landlords and employers to neighbors \nand acquaintances.\n\nSome of the illegal immigrants had been working 10 hours a day, seven days a week. Those cases will be \nreferred to the U.S. Department of Labor to see if the businesses violated any labor laws.\n"}
