{"title": "Before Public Theater, An Immigrant Shelter", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nFurther to \"Papp Proved That Landmarks Law Works\" by Frank B. Gilbert (letter, Nov. 13), on Joseph Papp's 1965 \nnegotiation for the old Astor Library: In 1965, the building's owner was United H.I.A.S. Service (Hebrew Immigrant \nAid Society), which acquired the former library as its world headquarters and temporary shelter for Jewish refugees \nand immigrants to the United States in January 1920.\n\nIn the book \"Visa to Freedom,\" Mark Wischnitzer quotes a message from President Warren G. Harding when \nH.I.A.S. dedicated the building: \"I am informed that the new house was made possible by gifts from persons who \ncame to America as immigrants. It seems to me there could be no more emphatic testimony to the usefulness and \neffectiveness of your society's work for Americanization.\"\n\nFrom 1920 to 1965, thousands of nights of shelter and millions of kosher meals were provided to these future \nUnited States citizens.\n\nJoseph Papp's persistence was an essential element in the highly complicated and successful negotiation that \nenabled him to acquire the building. But Mr. Papp was keenly sensitive to the history of the landmark building that \nbecame his Public Theater in 1965.\n\n \n\nJAMES P.
