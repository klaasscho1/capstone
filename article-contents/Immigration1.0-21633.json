{"title": "Islamic leader seems stuck in Michigan jail", "body": "\nAn Islamic religious leader convicted of concealing ties to terrorist groups remains jailed in Michigan seven \nmonths after he reached a deal with the U.S. government to be deported.\n\nThe agreement called for Fawaz Damra's deportation to Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Sudan, Egypt or the \nPalestinian territories. But so far, no one has been willing to take the former imam of the Islamic Center of \nCleveland, officials said.\n\nThere is no definitive rule on how long Damra can be held in jail, according to his attorney, Robert Birach.\n\n\"If there was progress, he'd be gone by now,\" said Birach. \"We haven't gotten a country yet to say yes.\"\n\nA spokesman with the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately return a call seeking \ncomment Friday.\n\nDamra, 44, was convicted in June 2004 of concealing ties to three groups that the U.S. government classifies as \nterrorist organizations when he applied for U.S. citizenship in 1994.\n\nThat conviction was upheld in March 2005, clearing the way for the U.S. to begin deportation proceedings.\n\nDamra, born a Palestinian, immigrated to the United States in the mid-1980s.\n\nDamra is having a difficult time in jail and misses his wife and three children, who still live in the Cleveland area, \nfriend Haider Alawan said.\n\n\"He's a man without a country,\" Alawan said.\n"}
