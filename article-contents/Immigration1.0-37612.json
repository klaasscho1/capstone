{"title": "Transfer of INS offical assailed", "body": "\nHouston immigration chief Ronald Parra, one of only two Hispanics among 33 district directors in the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service, is being transferred in a move that has him and local Hispanics crying foul.\n\nParra, 42, is fighting reassignment to head the St. Paul, Minn., district, which has 100 fewer staff members than the \n265-person Houston office.\n\nINS Commissioner Gene McNary says Parra's relationship with regional superiors ''had deteriorated.'' He refused \nfurther comment. Parra also declined comment - citing an INS policy established two months ago by McNary \nprohibiting public statements by INS staff.\n\n''He should be promoted, not transferred,'' says Leonel Castillo, a former INS commissioner. More than 50 \nHispanic business leaders and a group of immigration lawyers have written letters asking McNary to reconsider.\n\nThey credit Parra with clearing up backlogs, operating an amnesty program that attracted 50,000 applicants and \neasing long-standing tensions between the INS and immigration interest groups.\n\n''I've seen tremendous improvement in the organization and the functions of the office \u2026 ,'' said Judith Cooper of \nthe American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\nParra was criticized earlier this year for appearing at a news conference with a conservative immigration lobbying \ngroup. And federal judge James DeAnda chastised him for blaming the courts for an 18-month waiting period for \ncitizenship applicants. But the INS says his transfer is not connected to those incidents.\n"}
