{"title": "Brazilian Loses Ohio Clemency Bid", "body": "\nDespite his state parole board's unanimous recommendation in favor of a 22-year-old Ohio man, Gov. Bob Taft (R) \nyesterday refused to grant Joao Herbert the clemency that could have allowed him to avoid deportation to his \nnative Brazil.\n\nHerbert was adopted as a child from South America but was never naturalized as a U.S. citizen.\nIn June, a federal immigration judge ordered him deported because of a drug conviction for selling 7.5 ounces of \nmarijuana to a police informer as a teenager. It was Herbert's only criminal offense--for which he was sentenced to \nprobation and community treatment--but under immigration law it made him an aggravated felon subject to removal.\n\nAlthough Herbert has appealed the judge's order, he has virtually no chance of having it overturned, and his \nattorney, Maura Jaite, described him as \"totally devastated\" yesterday. He has been in INS detention for 17 months.\n\nIn a harshly worded statement, Taft said the case didn't meet his \"high standard for clemency\" and urged Herbert \nto \"consider the gravity of his actions and work hard to rehabilitate himself.\" Taft noted that the immigration case \n\"potentially has serious consequences\" but called that a separate legal matter.\n"}
