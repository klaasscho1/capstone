{"title": "GOV BACKS ED BREAK", "body": "\nALBANY - Immigrants seeking permanent resident status would pay the same CUNY or SUNY tuition as New \nYorkers under legislation touted by Gov. Pataki yesterday.\n\nSeeking re-election to a third term this year, Pataki announced his support for the tuition break at a conference of \nLatino leaders and activists.\n\nAbout 2,800 immigrants without permanent resident status are enrolled at CUNY, and about 200 are enrolled at \nSUNY.\n\nCUNY tuition for New Yorkers is about $3,200 a year; nonresidents pay $6,800.\n\nCUNY had offered immigrants the lower rate but stopped doing so last fall to make its tuition policies consistent with \nfederal immigration law.\n"}
