{"title": "State Certificate Hits the Big Time; Tenn. Document Proves a Magnet To Immigrants and Black Market", "body": "\n Tennessee's driving certificate for illegal immigrants is not supposed to be valid as a form of ID, but the \ndocument is so popular that people are paying hundreds of dollars and traveling hundreds of miles to get one. \n\n  Tennessee has issued more than 51,000 certificates since 2004 when it became the first state  --  since joined \nby Utah  --  to offer them. But not every certificate has gone to someone living in Tennessee. \n\n  Two major federal arrests in recent months exposed black-market shuttles carrying South and Central American \nimmigrants from New Jersey and Georgia to state licensing centers in Knoxville, where immigrants using phony \nresidency papers got certificates. \n\n  A third sweep near Nashville last month uncovered a conspiracy in which prosecutors say state license examiners \nin Murfreesboro accepted bribes from a driving school to provide illegal immigrants with driver's licenses and \ncertificates without testing. \n\n  This comes as Tennessee's certificate system is being studied as a possible model for handling \"non-conforming \ndrivers\" under Congress's recently adopted Real ID Act that will set a national standard for driver's licenses by \n2008. \n\n  \"We have seen individuals coming to Tennessee to take advantage of the driver's certificate program because \nthey are easy to obtain,\" Acting U.S. Attorney Russ Dedrick said. \n\n  Although \"Not Valid for Identification\" appears in bold red letters on the face of the wallet-size certificates, Dedrick \nsaid banks accept them as legal ID and they \"can easily be passed off for other types of identification documents.\" \n\n  Lawyer Mike Whalen, whose client Zeneida Concepcion Rivera faces  as much as four years in prison if convicted \nof bringing as many as 100 immigrants from New Jersey to Knoxville for certificates, said the government is \nmaking too much of the problem. \n\n\n  \"Somebody went through the roof and said, 'Remember 9/11, everyone had driver's licenses,' \" he said. \"Well, \nnone of these Mexican immigrants are in flight school anywhere. There is a difference.\" \n\n  That argument carries little weight in law enforcement circles. \n\n  The certificate law \"just kind of opened up a floodgate of everyone wanting to come here to get some sort of \nidentification,\" said Knox County Sheriff Tim Hutchison, whose officers discovered 58 illegal immigrants used the \nsame Knoxville address to get a certificate. \n\n  Applicants must provide two documents, such as utility bills or a lease, to show they reside in Tennessee, and a \nSocial Security number  --  or a sworn affidavit if there is none. They also must pass an eye exam, a driving rules \ntest and a road test. \n\n  \"What we tried to do in Tennessee was to recognize that there are people who may be legally here but they are \nnot completely documented,\" Gov. Phil Bredesen (D) said. \n\n  Tennessee began licensing illegal immigrants, without a Social Security number requirement, in early 2001. \nMore than 180,000 obtained licenses before post-9/11 fears set in. \n\n  The driving certificates were created in 2004 to satisfy homeland security concerns while giving illegal \nimmigrants the right to drive with certified proficiency. \n\n  Bredesen recalled being shocked three years ago to see an ad in a Spanish-language newspaper in Georgia \npromoting package deals for \"a certain amount of money to get on a bus and go to Tennessee to get a driver's \nlicense.\" \n\n  Since then, he said, \"there is no question we have tightened it up a long way.\" \n\n  Yet the arrests of the New Jersey-based group in July and a Georgia-based group in December suggest the \nunderground express is still rolling  --  with illegal immigrants willing to pay $950 to $1,500 apiece to come to \nKnoxville to get a certificate. \n\n  Some say the problem  is not the law, but the law's enforcement. \n\n  Hutchison's officers searched the Internet to determine that immigrants were using fake residences, and they \nspent months monitoring the suspects' movements before they were arrested. \n\n  \"I would hope that the state would pick up on it sooner,\" the sheriff said. \"But I am not sure that they are actually \ngeared to do that.\" \n\n  Tracy McGill, a supervisor at a Knoxville testing center where dozens of the fake residences were used to get \ncertificates, refused to comment. \n\n   The allure of payoffs to underpaid license examiners may only increase as requirements tighten and certificates \nbecome more precious, said Melissa Savage, a policy analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures. \n"}
