{"title": "Utah's GOP Reaches Out to Latinos; Republicans initiate 'most aggressive' recruitment campaign in state party's history", "body": "\nLooking to expand their political capital beyond the stereotypical white, male establishment, Republican leaders in \nUtah said Monday they have embraced the \"revitalization\" of a state chapter of the National Republican Hispanic \nAssembly.\n\nThe caucus, essentially dormant for the past few years, is generating renewed interest in Utah because of the \nRepublican Party's stand on family values, gun rights and patriotism, said Utah Republican Party Chairman Joe \nCannon. \"These people have a natural inclination to the Republican Party.\"\n\nDuring a news conference Monday inside the state Capitol, the GOP's top brass also unveiled a Spanish-language \nversion of the state party Web site, www.utgop.org, and a recruitment campaign, coordinated by the assembly, that \nthey described as \"the most aggressive campaign in the history of Utah to recruit Hispanics into the Republican \nParty.\"\n\n\"It's important for us to be more active in our Hispanic communities,\" said Senate President Al Mansell, R-Sandy. \n\"We need to reach out to others and bring them in\" to the Republican fold.\n\nThe GOP's Hispanic Assembly has established new headquarters at 117 E. South Temple in Salt Lake City, and \nappointed a chairman, Marco Diaz, a 31-year-old American Express executive who moved from Peru to Utah at age \n17 to study at Brigham Young University.\n\nDiaz outlined three goals for the assembly:\n\nRecruit grass-roots activists from the state's 201,559 Latinos.\n\nInvolve viable Latino candidates in the political process, especially through appointments and elections.\n\nAdvise GOP leaders as the \"eyes and ears\" of the Latino community.\n\n\"We can have a huge impact on the Republican Party,\" Diaz said.\n\nLatinos are a natural fit for the GOP because of a shared pro-life, pro-family agenda, he said.\n\nBut, Diaz said, it will be a challenge to recruit Latinos committed to bedrock Democratic causes such as affirmative \naction and civil rights, issues that have helped make Utah's Hispanic Caucus an influential faction within the state's \nDemocratic Party.\n\n\nDiaz, a lifelong Republican, praised the education initiatives of U.S. Rep. Chris Cannon and U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch \nand exhibited no fear of challenging the sacred cows of some Utah conservatives.\n\nEven though Utah's House GOP caucus crushed all attempts to rewrite Utah's hate crimes law during the 2001 \nLegislature, Diaz said he \"supports the principle\" of perfecting the law.\n\nWhile noting the need to secure the state's airports, he said a recent roundup of workers at Salt Lake City \nInternational Airport, mostly Latinos who had used forged documents for job applications, \"could have been done a \nlittle differently.\"\n\nAnd, Diaz he said he disagrees with Utah's English Only law, an initiative supported by many conservative \nRepublicans.\n\nPraising the Hispanic Assembly's reformation, Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff, in Spanish, said, \"Your vote is \nyour voice.\"\n"}
