{"title": "Metro Briefing  New York: Albany: Trucker License Suspensions To Begin", "body": "\nThe Department of Motor Vehicles plans to suspend within days the licenses of thousands of truck drivers \nsuspected of giving false information to the department. Advocates for illegal immigrants said the action would \ndisproportionately hurt such immigrants, who cannot provide proper documentation but need to drive. The \nadvocates plan a protest rally tomorrow outside Gov. George E. Pataki's Manhattan office. State officials said the \nsuspension was prompted by a concern over public safety. Joseph Picchi, a department spokesman, said \nyesterday that the licenses of 6,000 commercial drivers, one of several groups to be scrutinized, would be \nautomatically suspended beginning Friday, unless the drivers can provide valid Social Security information within \n15 days. Warning letters were sent out this month.   Nina Bernstein (NYT)\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
