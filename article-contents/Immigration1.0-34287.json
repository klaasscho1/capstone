{"title": "IMMIGRATION BILLS AND THE LESSON OF THE HELSTOSKI CASECASE", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nYour editorial on private immigration bills (Oct. 16) reiterates a misconception of the Helstoski case which has \ncontributed to the blasting of an outstanding, 12-year Congressional career and the denial to the people of the Ninth \nCongressional District of New Jersey of the services of a dedicated public figure.\n\nIt is true that the U.S. attorney withdrew the bribery prosecution after the Supreme Court ruled that Helstoski's \nlegislative acts (e.g., the introduction of bills) could not be proved in court. What is overlooked, however, is that the \nSupreme Court plainly permitted the attorney to try to prove that Helstoski had taken money and had promised to \nperform legislative acts (the sort of proof which is at the heart of the Abscam cases).\nAN-A\n\nThe Supreme Court was indubitably correct in its decision. If legislative acts of members of Congress become the \ngrist of Federal prosecutors, grand juries and criminal-trial juries, the underlying concept of a free and independent \nlegislative body uncoerced by the executive or judicial branches of our Government, is gravely threatened. On the \nother hand, the Court in Helstoski, as it had done previously, emphasized that non-legislative acts of members of \nCongress, e.g., taking bribes, were well within the ambit of the Federal prosecutorial process.\n\nSince it had been familiar law that legislative acts could not be proved, it is obvious that the reiteration of that \nprinciple in Helstoski had nothing to do with the U.S. attorney's decision to drop the bribery charges. The reason \nhe did so was that he finally realized that his case, shorn of impermissible evidence, came to rest upon the \ntestimony of two persons who had been caught in flagrant violation of law and who bought their way out (freedom \nfrom prosecution in one case, and a mild sentence in the other) by satisfying the ill-concealed desire of the U.S. \nattorney to add Helstoski's scalp to his prosecutorial belt.\n\nAgainst those two witnesses there would have been an outpouring of testimony from constituents who over the \nyears had been helped by an extraordinarily devoted Congressman with never a hint of anything expected in return. \nThe Supreme Court's decision became an excuse, therefore, to drop what appeared to be a losing prosecution that \nat the time seemed not to matter; Mr. Helstoski's career had already been destroyed by the indictment, which had \nbeen extant for more than three years.\n\nThe lesson of the Helstoski case, therefore, is not that private immigration bills are bad. They provide healthy \nmovement of the joints in what is otherwise a rigid, impersonal and sometimes unjust immigration-law system. The \nlesson of the Helstoski case is rather that Federal prosecutors, some of whom are bent on the use of their offices \nfor career development, can use their inordinate power to destroy decent people.\n\nPerhaps it has escaped the attention of The Times, although it is a matter of record, that it was Henry Helstoski \nhimself who caused the initiation of the F.B.I. investigation which the U.S. attorney turned against him. \nUnfortunately, in this post-Watergate era, any politician who is so much as charged with crime is presumed guilty.\n\n\nThere is no easy remedy, but at least the media ought not exacerbate the problem, as I am afraid you have done in \nyour interpretation of the Helstoski case in your editorial.\n\nMORTON STAVIS, Newark, Oct. 16, 1980\n\nThe writer is Mr. Helstoski's attorney.\n"}
