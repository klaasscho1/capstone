{"title": "An immigration crackdown killed - by conservatives", "body": "\nLast November, Republicans finally took control of the Mississippi House of Representatives, the final victory of the \nparty's long Southern strategy. Not since Reconstruction had the GOP controlled every facet of political life in the \nstate. \n\nIt wasn't just any Republicans, either. Former Gov. Haley Barbour is considered a moderate now. Gov. Phil Bryant \nis a creature of the tea party. Though this is not a border state, every aspect of political life was aligned to follow in \nthe footsteps of Arizona, Alabama, and Georgia with sweeping laws against illegal immigration. \n\nBut something surprising happened in the Magnolia State. While liberals were harboring futile hopes that the \nSupreme Court would invalidate Arizona's anti-immigrant law, Mississippi conservatives quietly shelved theirs. It \nnow appears that Arizona-like laws are more likely to suffer at the hands of politics rather than judges. \n\nStates often learn from the mistakes of their 49 siblings. Draconian immigration laws have been a disaster for \nArizona and Alabama. Those states' economies thrived off of undocumented immigrants; not anymore. And now \nthe laws are reportedly being undercut by lack of enforcement rather than adverse court rulings. \n\nMississippi's politics still tend to be divided along racial lines. The state is 37 percent African American, and its \nblack community has long been organized around progressive causes. In the 1990s, the state's growing casino \nindustry became a lure for Hispanic immigrants. They joined forces with African Americans against rising \nRepublican power. But that seemed only to drive more whites into the GOP. \n\nWhile many of those voters were enraged over illegal immigration, many others were not. The state Senate faced \nstrong opposition to its anti-illegal-immigrant bill from the state chamber of commerce, the farm lobby, and local \ngovernments. \n\nTheir reasons were all different and not very appealing. Clearly, cheap labor with no regulation animated some of \nthe farm and business groups. Farmers couldn't ignore accounts coming out of Georgia and Alabama of crops \nrotting in the fields. Cities and towns didn't want the extra work hunting down undocumented workers. The chamber \nfeared the state would suffer boycotts and a hurt reputation. \n\nThese groups changed the way immigration is discussed in a state that's about as conservative as can be. \nRhetoric about civil rights or racial profiling only goes so far here. Concerns about the business climate, agricultural \ninterests, and government mandates gained traction. With all these 'white\u201d interests aligned to defeat the bill, even \nthe most conservative politicians took note. \n\nIn Mississippi, the lieutenant governor gets to pick the heads of state Senate committees. Conservative \nRepublican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves appointed a Democrat, Bob Armory, head of the Judiciary Committee and then \nsent the bill there. Armory never put it up for a vote. In defending the move that killed the bill, Reeves' \n\n\nspokeswoman said the concerns 'expressed by the Mississippi Economic Council, Farm Bureau, the Mississippi \nPoultry Association, and local cities, counties, police chiefs, and sheriffs\u201d weighed heavily. \n\nMissing from that list is anything related to immigrants or their rights. The opposition spoke the language that would \nwin in a conservative state. The victory may be discomforting, but it is a victory nonetheless. \n\nJuliette Kayyem writes for the Boston Globe.    \n"}
