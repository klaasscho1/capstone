THOSE ON BOTH SIDES< OF A BALLOT ITEM ON ILLEGAL ENTRANTS CLASHED.", "body": "\nSupporters and opponents of a ballot measure that would restrict services for illegal immigrants clashed at a \ndemonstration yesterday, first engaging in verbal taunts then hitting each other with fists, picket signs and filled \nsoda cans.\n\nAt least six people were injured and one person was hospitalized at UCLA Medical Center after the two groups \nclashed about 9:30 a.m., authorities said.\nThe nature of the injuries was not immediately known.\n\n\"I wasn't doing anything. I was just holding my flag,\" said one of the demonstrators, Bob Schwartz, who was left \nwith a gash to the head and a shirt soaked in blood. \"All at once, one of them grabbed my flag and hit me over the \nhead.\"\n\nAbout 150 police officers wearing helmets and wielding batons separated the groups - representing both sides of \nthe volatile debate over Proposition 187 - and the demonstrations were allowed to proceed.\n\nProtesters continued to shout at each other, but no more fights broke out.\n\nAbout 300 people turned out at the federal building near the University of California campus for the rally in support \nof Proposition 187 and a counter-demonstration by immigrant-rights activists.\n\nApproved by voters in 1994, Proposition 187 would deny public education, nonemergency health care and social \nwelfare services to illegal immigrants.\n\nThe measure has not gone into effect because of court challenges.\n"}
