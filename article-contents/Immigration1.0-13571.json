{"title": "Latinos Continue The Immigrant Experience", "body": "\nReading \"South Fork Latinos Flex Political Muscle\" Jan. 5 made me think of my grandparents, who came to this \ncountry at the turn of the 20th century. Their stories of their journey, the wait and trials they went through to become \nAmerican citizens always amazed me.\n\n     This is a country of laws and I admire the people who came here legally . Illegal immigrants' disregard for that \nstandard hurts every person waiting to become legal immigrants. \n\n The Hispanic activist's observation that \"the dearth of affordable housing forces may Latinos to live in cramped, \nsqualid quarters\" led me to wonder what their life was like before coming to this country. I'm sure it was much \nworse.\n\nFLORENCE D. TRIPP\n\nFloral Park\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
