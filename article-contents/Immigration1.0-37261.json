{"title": "COURT ORDERS FIVE DEPORTED TO CUBA", "body": "\nA Federal appeals court here refused today to block the deportation of five Cubans being held in a Federal \nprison. The expulsions, set for Thursday, would be the first since the 1984 immigration treaty between the United \nStates and Cuba was suspended three years ago.\n\nThe decision by the three-judge panel was immediately appealed to the Supreme Court by attorneys for the \ndetainees. But a Justice Department spokeswoman said the Government was confident that the decision would be \nupheld.\n\n''They will be the first five to go back,'' said Deborah Burstion-Wade, the Justice Department spokeswoman. ''We \nexpect that there will be others before the end of the year.''\n\nThe agreement under which they will be returned to Cuba was first negotiated and signed by the United States and \nCuba in 1984. It was suspended the following year, then reinstated in 1987.\n\n \n\nAll Convicted of Crimes\n\nIt named 2,746 Cubans among the 125,000 who came to the United States in the 1980 Mariel boatlift whom United \nStates officials deemed dangerous criminals, mental patients or undesirable and sought to repatriate.\n\nAll five of those whom the United States wants to deport Thursday were convicted of crimes in the United States. \nMs. Burstion-Wade said the five are to leave from the Air National Guard field in Birmingham, Ala., aboard a United \nStates Marshal Service airplane.\n\nThe five are among the 116 Cubans being held at a Federal prison in Talladega, Ala., where the Justice \nDepartment is hearing appeals of deportation orders handed down by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n\nFifteen Cubans have exhausted their appeals and were ordered on Nov. 17 to be returned to Cuba. But their \nattorneys charged that the Government had violated the procedure laid down for such appeals after riots by Cuban \ndetainees last year, and that it had also failed to adequately consider their requests for political asylum.\n\n \n\nMore Hearings Scheduled\n\nAttorneys for the 15 appealed the Nov. 17 decisions to a Federal Court in Birmingham, where on Tuesday they \nwere denied an injunction halting the deportations. They then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe 11th Circuit, which ruled today.\n\n\nThe cases of the other 10 who have exhausted their appeals through hearings before the I.N.S. and Justice \nDepartment are scheduled to be heard in Federal Court in Birmingham on Monday, said Gary LeShaw, an attorney \nwith the Atlanta Legal Aid Society.\n\nHe said that an unfavorable ruling by the Supreme Court in the appeal of those slated to be flown to Cuba on \nThursday could mean the return of the remaining 10 as early as next week.\n\nAmong the five men who are scheduled to be returned to Cuba on Thursday and who had appealed their \ndeportation orders are Onel Calzado Garlobo, 43 years old, convicted of attempted sexual molestation; Rene \nMaurin Oliva, 25, convicted of theft and battery, and Miguel Beitia Socarraz, 28, convicted of burglary. Two others, \nHector Hernandez Quesada and Angel Meneses Hernandez, did not appeal their deportations to the Federal \ncourts.\n\n \n\nSuspended in 1985\n\nIn the first year of the agreement, 201 of those named were returned to Cuba, but the agreement was suspended in \n1985 by the Government of Fidel Castro in retaliation for American support of Radio Marti, a news and information \nprogram broadcast from Miami, financed by the United States Government and staffed by Anti-Castro Cuban \nAmericans.\n\nSince then, many of the Cubans, classified as excludable aliens because they had committed crimes since arriving \nin the United States, were held in Federal prisons, even after serving their sentences for their crimes, while \nGovernment officials sought to re-establish the agreement with Cuba.\n\nLast November, the agreement was re-established. Detainees who did not want to go back to Cuba immediately \nrioted in the Federal penitentiaries in Oakdale, La., and Atlanta.\n\nThose riots ended with an agreement to establish new procedures for paroling detainees into American society and \nan appeal to the Justice Department by those detainees recommended for deportation.\n"}
