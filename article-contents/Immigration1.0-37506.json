{"title": "AIDS DEMONSTRATION \u00a0ACTIVISTS PROTEST IMMIGRATION POLICY", "body": "\nIn the first of many protests planned to disrupt the 6th International AIDS Conference, hundreds of homosexual \nactivists blocked San Francisco's streets at rush hour Tuesday afternoon to demonstrate their opposition to U.S.  \nimmigration policies that discriminate against people infected with the AIDS virus.  Marching through downtown to \nan Immigration and Naturalization Service office, activists began a week of protest that some say could turn \nviolent and that all expect to test the city's reputation as a national symbol of urban civility.  Scientists at the \nconference will hear progress reports on a flood of drugs under study for AIDS (acquired immune deficiency \nsyndrome) and related infections.
