{"title": "A tale of two parts: London and the rest of the UK", "body": "\nAs with so many economic issues in the UK, inward investment has become a tale of two regions: London and the \nrest of the country. The capital sucked up half of inward investment projects in 2012 and continues to increase its \nshare.\n\nThere is also a two-speed economy outside London: as many English regions see their foreign investment decline, \nWales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are capturing more.\n\nEY, the professional services firm, compiles an annual assessment of attractiveness. Its report on 2012 found that, \ndiscounting follow-on projects by companies already in the UK, the regions have seen year-on-year falls since \n2010.\n\nDespite a 2.6 per cent total rise in 2012, the number of investment projects in 2011's most popular regions fell back, \nwith projects in London slipping by 4 per cent, though to a still healthy 311, and those in southeast England \nslumping by more than a third to 55.\n\nScotland, Wales and the north of England had rises of 49 per cent, 244 per cent and 71 per cent respectively. \nScotland recorded 76 projects, its highest total for 16 years. Wales recorded 31 projects, its highest number for five \nyears, and Northern Ireland recorded 29 projects, its highest for 14 years. The English regions as a whole outside \nLondon secured their smallest total of new investment projects on record, only 122.\n\nDavid Buckley, senior partner at EY in Leeds, says there is a simple explanation. In 2010, the incoming coalition \ngovernment scrapped regional development agencies, state-run entities with annual budgets of hundreds of millions \nof pounds that were in charge of inward investment. Scotland, London, Wales and Northern Ireland were allowed to \nkeep theirs, including offices around the world.\n\nThe local enterprise partnerships (Leps) that replaced them have tiny budgets and, while business led, cover \nsmaller areas such as a single city and its hinterland. \"You have to market a region and sell the story. Scotland is \nnot just talking about Edinburgh but different places for different needs,\" Mr Buckley says.\n\nYorkshire won only 21 projects in 2012, with a population and economy of similar size to Scotland, which took home \n76.\n\n\nWhen Leeds, Sheffield and Hull put in separate bids to host the Green Investment Bank, a government institution, \nthey lost to Edinburgh. But when they collaborated on a bid to host the start of the 2014 Tour de France, they won.\n\n\"It is a real wake-up call because, unless the English regions have a more credible approach to international \ninvestment, the UK as a whole will lose its top spot for inward investment in Europe,\" Mr Buckley points out. \"We \nare losing out to Germany.\"\n\nMichael Boyd, managing director of investment at UK Trade & Investment, admits the regions need more help but \ndenies there is a London bias. He points out that projects in the capital tend to be smaller and create fewer jobs.\n\n\"Leps took time to get up and running,\" he says, but they are receiving more money from government and UKTI is \nworking more closely with them. It is more than doubling the number of staff that co-ordinate with them to 21.\n\n\"We recognise that we are working in partnership with Leps,\" he says. \"It is their responsibility to get their offer up to \ndate.\"\n\nHowever, UKTI cannot hit its national targets without the regions performing better. It is helping them to create \nonline showcases of their potential and pursuing specific companies in sectors such as automotive and renewable \nenergy that the UK wishes to develop.\n\nPoliticians have also backed individual projects. George Osborne, the chancellor, lobbied the Chinese heavily to \ninvest in Airport City, an \u00a3800m office park being built near Manchester airport. He is also backing the \u00a310bn \nLiverpool and Wirral Waters development schemes on the Mersey, though no major Chinese investor has yet \ncome forward.\n\nSir Howard Bernstein, chief executive of Manchester City council, says the lack of funding meant cities had to \ncompete on their merits. \"We can demonstrate that the fundamentals are here and investing in Manchester is a \ngood proposition,\" he says.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Road projects, including the proposed upgrading of the A21 near Tonbridge in Kent, were also postponed.\n\nAlthough the government revealed a wishlist of more than 570 projects in the Autumn Statement of 2010, it soon \nemerged that there were few concrete means of delivering them.\n\nGeorge Osborne, the chancellor, had hoped that private investors would stump up 64 per cent of the \u00a3310bn cost \nof the hundreds of new energy, road, rail and water projects.\n\n\n\nBut, although pension funds made an initial show of seeming willing - setting up the \u00a32bn pension fund \ninfrastructure platform - they soon proved averse to construction risk, favouring already built projects with \nguaranteed income streams.\n\nThe government's own willingness to cancel projects at short notice did not help to win investor confidence. Nor \ndid regulatory reforms such as the overhaul of the electricity market. The value of new orders for infrastructure \ndropped by 33 per cent between 2009 and 2012.\n\nBut although investment in infrastructure remained low overall, foreign money continued to pour into water, energy \nand rail projects. According to Infrastructure Journal, a data and specialist information provider, foreign investors \ntook a substantial investment in 19 of 66 projects that received financing in the 21 months since January 2012. This \nincludes some of the biggest deals of the year for the UK market - an offshore wind farm near the Lincolnshire \ncoast, cables for a new offshore wind farm in the Thames Estuary, and new trains on the intercity and Thameslink \nrailway lines.\n\nHitachi, Dong, Vinci, Veolia, Siemens and Itochu all took a stake in projects, while the Japanese banks also \nprovided much of the backing. Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi lent big tickets on 10 of the 66 projects closed. Sumitomo \nMitsui Banking Corp lent on 12 of the 66, according to Infrastructure Journal.\n\nThis shows, says Darryl Murphy, partner in global infrastructure at KPMG, that Britain has \"always been an \nattractive market for foreign investors. The UK remains, on the face of it, very attractive to international investors \nbecause of our financial and regulatory frameworks. If you want a safe home for your capital - outside your home \ncountry - Britain ticks most of the boxes.\"\n\nNevertheless, the problem remains that, despite projects such as Hinkley moving ahead, the spades are unlikely to \nhit the ground for some time yet. Even if the Hinkley deal is approved by the European Commission next year, \nconstruction will not start until 2015. Other projects remain stuck at first base. Crossrail, approved by the last \nLabour government is going ahead, but HS2 is looking increasingly contentious.\n\nRichard Abadie, infrastructure partner at PwC, says: \"The real problem is the dearth of new investable projects. \nThere is a lot of money out there, which people are ready to invest, but there is also real frustration that there are so \nfew new projects ready to get off the ground.\"\n\nMr Murphy agrees. \"The frustration for the Chinese has been that, when they come to the UK, there aren't projects \nto invest in immediately because many of the projects are in varying states of development.\"\n\nComplaints by the CBI, the business lobby group, have spurred the government to take action. In 2011, the \ngovernment tried to push things along by identifying 40 \"nationally significant\" building projects. It also launched a \n\u00a340bn \"UK Guarantee\" aimed at helping important but stalled schemes to raise finance.\n\nCritics say even this has failed to gain traction - it has been used for the Drax power plant (biomass conversion) and \napproved, though not yet closed, for the Northern Line tube extension. But analysts argue that many of the hit list of \n40 priority projects that have been approved are too small. This includes Mersey Gateway, for example, a new \nbridge that has received the goahead.\n\nNevertheless, Mr Murphy remains optimistic that the market is changing.\n\n\"Eighteen months ago, you would have been hard pressed to find institutional investors willing to take construction \nrisk,\" he says.\n\n\"Now they are realising the risk can be managed and they will have to take that risk if they want the yields and \nreturns.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

George Osborne, the chancellor, recently announced plans for Britain \nto become the first non-Muslim country to issue an Islamic bond, or sukuk. He said his goal was for the City of \nLondon \"to be the unrivalled centre for Islamic finance\".\n\nMeanwhile, Britain is easing regulatory requirements to allow Chinese institutions to set up wholesale banking \nbranches rather than having to establish separate subsidiaries. In a parallel move, the government is promoting \nLondon as an overseas centre for trading in renminbi.\n\nNor is the drive to promote Britain as a financial centre confined to the government. In a recent speech, the \ngovernor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, evoked an image of the UK at the centre of a renewed \nglobalisation. His emphasis was on the Bank facilitating this role by ensuring that financial institutions remain \nresilient.\n\nDespite such pronouncements, the UK faces several challenges if it wants to remain a leading centre for global \nfinance. On a macroeconomic level there is concern that it is perpetuating a lopsided economy that is too heavily \ndependent on finance.\n\nA related worry is that the beneficiaries of investment in financial services could be too concentrated in London and \nthe investment banking sector. The City, if defined most broadly as the whole financial services sector, employs \nabout 1m people, of whom about two-thirds work outside London. Throw in professional services - such as \naccounting practices, law firms and property professionals - and almost another 1m could be added.\n\nFinally, there is increasing competition from other financial centres, especially those in Asia.\n\nWhile London is generally maintaining a slight lead over New York, according to a recent report by City think-tank \nZ/Yen, Hong Kong and Singapore are both gaining ground on the established leaders. For Chris Cummings, the \nchief executive of TheCityUK, a financial services industry body, this is \"absolutely a concern\".\n\nMartin Gilbert, the chief executive of Aberdeen Asset Management, is in pole position to witness some of these \ntrends first hand. His company is based in Aberdeen and has an extensive operation in Asia, including a regional \nheadquarters in Singapore. Mr Gilbert has also joined the government's Financial Services, Trade and Investment \nBoard, tasked with promoting UK financial services.\n\nHe specifically defines himself as bringing a \"Scottish view\" to the challenges facing UK financial services. \"There \nare vast numbers of people in financial services employed outside the M25 [London orbital motorway]\", he says. \n\"Especially in places like Glasgow and Edinburgh.\"\n\nMark Gregory, chief economist for the UK and Ireland at EY, accepts that inward investment is flowing into existing \nlocations but says it is not going to new ones. \"Where there is a historic relationship - Yorkshire, Scotland are \nprobably good examples - there is some definite spillover there,\" he says.\n\nSue Langley, the chief executive of the Financial Services Investment Organisation, is pursuing four priorities for \ninvestment in financial services: asset management, insurance, financial technology and mid- and back-office \nfunctions.\n\nAs for international competition, the most formidable threat is seen as coming from Asia.\n\n\"Places like Singapore and Dubai are really very keen to woo people to have their financial centres there as well,\" \nsays Mr Gilbert.\n\nEY's Mr Gregory adds that while Asian centres have the potential to grow stronger, the recent turbulence in \nemerging economies has, at least in the short term, worked to London's advantage. \"Asia probably is the new \nthreat, but London seems to have advantages that are holding up.\"\n\n\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Many factories were left idle in the quiet colder months to bring down capacity well in excess of \ndemand.\n\nBut the resurgence in UK housebuilding, fired by government incentive schemes such as Help to Buy and Funding \nfor Lending, has jolted the industry into action.\n\nIbstock Brick, the UK's largest producer by market share, plans to keep all 20 of its plants open throughout winter \nfor the first time since 2007. It plans to be \"flat-out\" post-Christmas to build stocks, having previously shut down \nmany plants between November and February.\n\nGerman-owned Hanson, the UK's second-biggest brickmaker, has staged two- to three-month shutdowns at about \nhalf its plants since 2009, laying off workers or paying them a nominal sum.\n\nOn December 21, it will relight the kiln in its mothballed Claughton works and keep the rest of its plants going all \nwinter.\n\nNoble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association, said: \"Brickmaking had started to look \nlike a dying industry in Britain but we are hoping that this is a sign that it could be revived for many decades to \ncome. It's important to retain the vital manufacturing skills and infrastructure in Britain.\"\n\nUK manufacturers delivered 2.4bn bricks in 2007. But since 2009, annual sales have been stuck at around 1.5bn \nunits.\n\nThe Home Builders Federation forecasts a market of 1.7bn bricks in 2013 and 1.8bn in 2014. It believes a further \n20,000 housing starts in 2015 would require an extra 120m bricks, meaning a 2bn market by 2016-17 is \"clearly \npossible\".\n\nAmong other UK brickmakers, Aim-quoted Michelmersh will be at full production across all its factories over the \nwinter period, having idled several plants during the colder months of 2011 and 2012. Wienerberger, the world's \nbiggest maker of bricks and the third-largest UK producer by market share, plans to have a brief Christmas \nstoppage before firing up in the new year - its shortest shutdown since 2008.\n\nWhile private homebuilding in the UK is enjoying a resurgence, the wider construction market is still depressed. In \n2012, construction was 14 per cent lower than the pre-recession peak and deteriorated even further in the first \nquarter of this year, though it is starting to show signs of recovery.\n\nJerry McClaughlin, director of the Mineral Products Association, said: \"A brick is not just for Christmas. We would \nstill like to see growth in the 85 per cent of construction which is not private housing.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

What I need you to do is go out and get early, proprietary \ninformation that we can use to make money in these stocks,\" a tense Mr Steinberg allegedly told him, according to \nMr Horvath.\n\n\"You need to talk to your contacts\", at companies, banks, consulting firms and peer network, to \"get me that \ninformation,\" Mr Horvath alleged he was told.\n\nWhen asked by prosecutor Antonia Apps what he understood that directive to mean, Mr Horvath said: \"I thought he \nwanted me to cultivate sources of non-public information . . . I thought there was an emphasis on material non-\npublic information.\"\n\nMr Horvath testified that he knew it was wrong to do at the time, but he thought he would have been fired.\n\nFollowing that meeting, Mr Horvath testified that he tapped into a network of friends, including Jesse Tortora, an \nanalyst with hedge fund Diamondback, who had a \"high level\" source inside Dell.\n\nMr Tortora began providing Mr Horvath multiple updates each quarter about the personal computer maker's \nearnings. Mr Horvath testified that he passed the information on to Mr Steinberg who traded based on the \ninformation.\n\n\"I had told Mike that Jesse had a contact at Dell inside the company,\" Mr Horvath testified.\n\nMr Steinberg has pleaded not guilty and maintains he did nothing wrong. At least two rows of friends and family \nhave sat in the courtroom gallery behind Mr Steinberg since the trial started on November 21, demonstrating \nloyalty.\n\nMr Steinberg's lawyer, Barry Berke, has said Mr Horvath is \"rewriting history\" to try to avoid prison. He also \nmaintains that Mr Steinberg never knew or met Mr Horvath's sources of allegedly inside information.\n\nMr Horvath has pleaded guilty to insider trading and is co-operating with the government. He was fired from SAC \nafter his guilty plea last September. SAC was also charged criminally with insider trading and earlier this month paid \n$1.8bn in penalties and pleaded guilty. The firm is being unwound.\n\nIn questioning by prosecutors, Mr Horvath took the jury through notes he had made from an exchange with Mr \nTortora about Dell's quarterly performance. The notes were entered into a SAC system called \"tamale\", and at \ntimes emailed to a SAC distribution list called \"Steinberg Group.\"\n\nProgressively, Mr Horvath testified, he gained greater confidence with Mr Tortora's information about Dell's \nrevenues and gross margins as it proved accurate from quarter to quarter. Mr Tortora previously testified that he \nreceived information from a friend who had a contact in Dell's investor relations department.\n\nSAC made more than $1m in profits from trading Dell stock using inside information, prosecutors have alleged. Mr \nHorvath's testimony is expected to continue Monday.\n\nMr Steinberg's lawyers are expected to argue that Mr Steinberg received information from a range of sources \nincluding analyst reports.\n\nWhen asked by the prosecutor if Mr Steinberg relied on external analysts, Mr Horvath testified, \"Mike hated sellside \nresearch. He wouldn't trade on that.\"\n\nIFRAME DO NOT REMOVE\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Yet it also hosts some of the poorest boroughs in the \nUK as measured by child poverty or income levels after housing costs.\n\nMr Johnson said it was wrong to attack the rich or try to stamp out inequality, but the wealth gap of today could only \nbe tolerated on two conditions: \"One, that we help those who genuinely cannot compete and, two, that we provide \nthe opportunity for those that can.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Scottish National party leaders said the scheme could raise female labour \nforce participation, boosting tax revenue by hundreds of millions of pounds.\n\nLabour and Conservative members of the Scottish parliament ridiculed the white paper as a long but empty read, \nand the child care promise as a political ruse.\n\n\"The SNP has had full powers to implement childcare reform at any time in the last six years,\" said Ruth Davidson, \nleader of the Scottish Conservative party. \"Now, the SNP is in need of a referendum boost, the policy suddenly \nreappears.\"\n\nBut Alex Salmond, Scottish first minister, insisted that a devolved government could not make such an offer, not \nleast because Edinburgh's budget is set according to UK state spending and any tax revenue benefit would \ndisappear \"into the maw of the London Treasury\".\n\n\"A childcare revolution is the sort of transformation impossible under devolution,\" Mr Salmond said. \"With \nindependence it is one that we can implement.\"\n\nThe SNP plans also came under fire in the UK parliament, with David Cameron, UK prime minister, saying the white \npaper left \"a huge set of questions\" unaddressed.\n\n\n\n\"We have been waiting a long time for this document. We were told that it would answer every question, yet there is \nno answer on the currency, no answer on the issue of EU membership, and no proper answers on Nato,\" Mr \nCameron said.\n\nMr Cameron again waved aside an SNP challenge to debate Mr Salmond during the referendum campaign, \nprompting Pete Wishart, an SNP MP, to accuse the prime minister of being \"a pathetic big feartie\" [fearful].\n\nPro-union politicians poured scorn on the white paper's vision of a smooth retention of EU membership that might \nleave Scotland with its current share of the UK budget rebate.\n\n\"The hokum of the 'seamless' EU membership in 18 months does not stack up,\" said Michael Moore, the Liberal \nDemocrat former Scotland secretary. \"It seems to be very vulnerable to EU processes, and there is no sense of an \nincentive for 28 countries to meet the Scottish timetable. This is a huge gaping hole.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

This year has seen the comeback \nof market confidence, a reduction in volatility and healthy growth in many asset prices.\n\nYet there is still no escaping from the word \"uncertainty\". Six years after the start of the financial crisis, private \nbanks and their clients continue to operate in an environment characterised by low interest rates, lacklustre \neconomic growth and a wave of regulation that increases costs and complexity.\n\nIt is thus no wonder that private bankers continue to be wary.\n\n\"The market trends go against everyone,\" says Jacques de Saussure, senior managing partner of Pictet & Cie, the \nSwiss private bank and fund manager.\n\n\"We have had a low interest rate environment for four to five years, market activity is low, Switzerland is seeing the \nend of bank secrecy and the cost of regulation is impacting everybody,\" he adds.\n\nNotoriously conservative private bankers are not yet convinced that abundant talk about a return to economic \ngrowth, rising equity prices and a renewed search for yield will be enough to change the fundamental issues facing \ntheir sector.\n\nThey say that positive factors such as a prospect of rising interest rates and a shift from bond markets into equities \ncannot counter severe headwinds from tightened regulation, a relentless pressure on costs and clients' cautious \ninvestment patterns.\n\nThese structural issues continue to weigh on profits and are set to trigger an extensive shake-out in the sector.\n\nTim Monger, financial institutions partner at Boston Consulting Group, says: \"The profitability of the industry will not \nreturn to pre-crisis levels, at least for the medium term, as clients tend to invest in lower-margin products and costs \nare continuing to rise.\"\n\n\n\nConsultants at rival Roland Berger estimate that margins have fallen 20 basis points in the past five years, thanks to \nlower client activity, less complex products and a focus on the super-rich - a clientele notorious for demanding low \nfees.\n\nAt the same time, tightened regulation affecting areas from money laundering to investment advice has sent private \nbanks' costs spiralling upwards. In the past five years, private banks globally have gone from spending 61 cents for \neach dollar in revenue to 73 cents, says BCG.\n\nThe global crackdown on tax evasion is another costly issue, particularly in Switzerland, where US fines have \nalready helped force two private banks - Wegelin & Co and Frey & Co - out of business, and where a recently \nstruck agreement between the two countries is set to cause a wave of penalties.\n\nOne banker says: \"The tax issue will have a massive impact on the Swiss private banking sector next year. For \naggressive banks with a high number of US clients, the financial consequences will be substantial.\"\n\nWith banks forced to adapt rapidly to these structural changes, the business of investing rich clients' money is \nundergoing a Darwinian process that will leave only the strongest.\n\n\"The smaller banks in particular realise that they are going through a period where it isn't certain if they can remain \nprofitable,\" Mr de Saussure says.\n\n\"We will see more banks that will either be acquired or decide to close or abandon their banking licence and keep \ntheir client relationships as independent asset managers.\n\n\"There will be a wave of smaller banks consolidating next year and in 2015. There is always a market for domestic \nniche players, but it will be difficult for highly regulated cross-border groups to stay independent,\" Mr de Saussure \nadds.\n\nBankers are also not very hopeful of any respite as a result of an uptick in client activity.\n\nJ\u00fcrg Zeltner, chief executive of UBS's wealth management arm, says there will not be a sudden return to a \"risk-on\" \nenvironment. \"I think we are settling into a new norm. We will see for a long time relatively high liquidity reserves for \nclients,\" the head of the largest private banking business in the world by assets says. Clients have for several years \nbeen sitting on cash levels of about 30 per cent, curbing their own and banks' ability to make higher returns.\n\nThis is one of the reasons banks are set to be forced into a wave of joint ventures, partnerships and outsourcing \nprojects in middle and back office areas.\n\nExamples of this trend abound. A number of large banks are in talks with various providers about outsourcing \nbackground checks on clients, while UBS has recently outsourced a large part of its procurement, and Deutsche \nBank has outsourced its wealth management back office operations in Switzerland to Avaloq Group.\n\nBut beyond those support functions, even highly rewarded relationship managers are no longer sacrosanct as the \nefficiency of banks' client-facing parts is coming into focus.\n\nBanks have inflated their cost structure throughout their activities and functions, says Mr Zeltner.\n\nMany banks are moving to a system where fewer relationship managers are covering more assets.\n\nBCG's Mr Monger says this does not necessarily work to the detriment of the client. \"In the past, banks have often \noverserviced their clients,\" he says.\n\n\"They are now starting to become more sophisticated about the amount of service they provide for different clients. \nThey are moving from a one-size-fits-all to a tailored approach.\"\n\nA rapid move to mobile and online technology plays a crucial role. \"Some clients might get much less face-time but \na much better iPad app,\" he adds.\n\n\n\nWith clients continuing to be risk averse and developed countries mired in slow growth, private banks are also \nforced to look towards Asia.\n\nMr Monger estimates that 70-75 per cent of growth in the next five years will come from emerging markets and \nmostly the Asia-Pacific region, despite the jitters in those markets this year. In five years, the region is set to \novertake the US as a centre for wealth.\n\n\"Everyone is trying to figure out how to get into this market,\" he says, adding that this trend plays into the hands of \nthe larger banks that can afford to invest in those regions.\n\n\"We will see a substantial transformation of our industry and the survivors will come out of this stronger,\" Mr de \nSaussure says. \"There is still money to invest; this is certainly not the end of our business.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

At best, these proved highly \nilliquid, and at worst, blew up.\n\nAs the easy liquidity rolled out of markets, it became clear that many clients had been paying hefty fees for the \nprivilege.\n\nPrivate banks insist they have now turned a corner. In an environment in which markets are dominated by the \nunprecedented easing actions of major central banks and growing political uncertainty around the world, the value \nof good financial advice has perhaps never been higher.\n\nPrivate banks have wised up to the need. Organisations such as UBS now have dedicated chief investment officers \nto provide broad, global advice on asset allocation and strategy.\n\n\"What we are trying to do is show that we're not just salespeople any more,\" says one Zurich-based banker. \"What \nwe want to push are products that make sense for our clients first and us second.\"\n\nPart of that process is that private banks have focused less on high-margin, complex or structured products and \nmore on simple, broad tactical asset allocation.\n\nAlexander Friedman, chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management (see profile below), has advised clients \nto put their money into straightforward equities this year.\n\nHe has been proved right. Developed market equities, in particular, have enjoyed big returns. The S&P 500 is up 26 \nper cent so far this year, while the FTSE 100 has risen 14 per cent.\n\nMr Friedman has also called for investors to slash their holdings of investment-grade bonds - corporate and \nsovereign - from an average of 16 per cent to just 2 per cent.\n\nPrivate bank clients are, nevertheless, conservative by nature. Most still maintain a disproportionate share of their \ninvestments in cash. Private banks report that clients hold, on average, 20-30 per cent of their assets in cash or \ncash-like securities - and in some cases, much more.\n\nAll this exacerbates the conflict between a client's wishes and those of the bank to make a profit.\n\nThe key is for banks to find products that are both suitable for their clients' low or moderate risk appetites but also \noffer decent fee-earning potential.\n\n\n\nAs such, banks have begun to increase the number of alternative investment products they offer clients.\n\nSome, such as Deutsche Bank, have made big investments in hedge fund Ucits - tightly regulated, onshore \nversions of hedge fund products - which they believe are more palatable to risk-averse clients. Flows into these \nfunds have surged in recent years. The sector manages around $250bn of assets, according to Eurekahedge.\n\nBut regular hedge fund and alternative investment products are coming back into vogue. With equity markets \nlooking frothy and bonds plagued by the possibility of tapering, hedge funds have merit as a midway alternative, \noffering equity-like returns with bond-like volatility.\n\n\"We see opportunities in hedge funds, which have performed well in the year to date and benefit from falling \ncorrelations within many asset classes,\" HSBC's private bank told its clients: \"We also believe that select real \nestate and private equity can add value to portfolios for investors who take a longer-term view, as we believe there \nis currently a high premium for somewhat less liquid assets.\"\n\nIt is not just in asset classes that banks are giving advice. Credit Suisse, Julius Baer and UBS have outlined \nambitious targets to expand their private banking business in part by lending more to wealthy clients. Loans to \nbolster investment returns or to allow clients greater flexibility in their finances are seen as profitable areas aligned \nwith client needs.\n\nPrivate banking may have undergone a period of tranquillity and reinvention in the wake of 2008, but practitioners \nsay now is the time for it to make its mark again as a positive and profitable line of business.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nProfile Alexander Friedman, UBS\n\nAlexander Friedman's appointment two years ago to the new role of chief investment officer at UBS Wealth \nManagement was intended to telegraph a clear signal: the Swiss institution was putting its investing missteps and \nscandals behind it.\n\nMr Friedman has an impressive record when it comes to managing the finances of the wealthy. Until March 2010 he \nwas the chief financial officer of the $36bn Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and served on its management \ncommittee - a role he still performs. Mr Friedman oversaw the foundation's finances during a period when it more \nthan doubled in size.\n\nThe foundation hired him after a five-year stint at Lazard as a mergers and acquisitions specialist. He has also held \na supervisory seat on the board of Actis, an emerging-markets focused private equity firm, and set up his own \ninvestment vehicle, Asymmetry.\n\nMr Friedman has amassed an impressive set of business connections. He is chairman of the Seattle Art Museum \ninvestment committee, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former judge for the Financial Times-\nGoldman Sachs Business Book of the Year awards.\n\nMr Friedman has made political connections, too: after gaining a BA from Princeton and a law degree from \nColumbia Law School, he became an adviser to the secretary of defence in the Clinton Administration.\n\nAt UBS, the establishment of the chief investment officer's office has been central to the bank's effort to compete \nwith the likes of BlackRock and Pimco. Mr Friedman's links in the investing world have been valuable, as has his \ninvesting nous.\n\nA dependable, institutional opinion on global financial matters - from Federal Reserve tapering to Abenomics - is \nsomething clients at UBS have until now lacked.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

New wealth will account for about 80 per cent of \ngrowth for private banks until 2017, factoring in moderate asset returns, according to BCG.\n\nThe source of that wealth is also changing, with entrepreneurship becoming the dominant factor.\n\nFor financial advisers, that has brought a big change in the understanding that clients have concerning the \nmanagement of their finances.\n\n\"For a wealthier client, their individual and personal needs often blur with their institutional needs - that's what an \ninvestment banking professional can bring,\" says John Mathews, head of private wealth management at UBS \nWealth Management Americas.\n\nUnderscoring the changing face of clients, technology entrepreneurs have accumulated their money more quickly \nthan those with interests in other sectors, according to analysis from Barclays Wealth and Investment Management.\n\nThe financial crisis has also changed the behaviour of many wealthy clients, bankers say. Such people are keeping \na closer eye on their money, as well as demanding more from their private bankers.\n\n\"Clients are more hands-on in terms of how they think about their wealth. Hence, the rise in family offices in recent \nyears,\" says Citi's Mr Mason.\n\nBank executives also say they have moved further towards a team model for financial advisers, as opposed to \nindividuals serving clients' needs. Having former investment bankers on the team can help.\n\n\"[Wealthy clients] demand so much more, the only way to deliver that is to have different specialists on their teams,\" \nsays Mr Mathews at UBS.\n\n\n\nEmerging competitors such as Wells Fargo are hiring thousands into their brokerage, private banking and \nretirement business, creating a more competitive jobs market.\n\nExecutive search firms say the trend of hiring investment bankers into the private banks has been going on for \nsome time, reaching its height immediately after the financial crisis.\n\n\"Private banks are keen to tap into the products of an investment bank, as customers become more sophisticated,\" \nsays William Foley, partner at Hammond Partners, the executive search firm, in London.\n\n\"Having technical private bankers is also a bonus for the investment bank, as the private bank is an obvious area \nfor them to distribute products to,\" he adds.\n\nBut John Thiel, head of US wealth management and private banking for Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management, \ndoes not think investment bankers always make the best fit for wealth management, as they can be more focused \non transactions than relationships.\n\n\"If you get too focused on transactions, you can destroy the relationship,\" he says.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Mr Batista was undone when his oil company failed to find any of the black stuff, sparking a cash \ncrunch across his network of companies.\n\nBut the wider slowdown in Brazil's economy also hurt him, as it has hundreds of others in the ultra-wealthy bracket - \ngenerally defined as people with net assets of at least $30m.\n\nIt might seem unnecessarily elitist to focus only on the waxing and waning wealth of a global group of just 199,235 \npeople, but this is exactly where the world's private banks put their efforts. Individuals with just $5m or $10m do not \nhave enough cash to play with to cover the costs of the highest level of private service.\n\nBrazil was one of less than a dozen countries that saw the number of its super-rich decline this year, according to \nan annual report by Wealth-X and UBS. More than 600 people dropped out of this league in Brazil, as the total \nassets of this group fell almost $100bn from 2012 to $770bn.\n\nChina, the next biggest loser, lost almost 600 multimillionaires and the group's total assets fell by $65bn to $1.5tn. \nThe other two Bric nations, Russia and India, registered a small rise in ultra-rich numbers and wealth.\n\nAll the other countries that saw their ultra-wealthy populations shrink were also emerging markets, apart from \nCanada and Finland.\n\nChile, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Peru, South Africa, Syria and Tunisia all lost members of their super wealthy clubs, \naccording to Wealth-X.\n\nDeveloped countries by contrast did rather well. Germany saw more than 2,000 people join or re-enter this league, \nwhile Europe as a whole added almost 5,000 and the US gained more than that. These two blocs between them \nadded $1.5tn in assets this year - as much as all Chinese super-rich hold. The total wealth of the US and European \nultra rich is a staggering $16.76tn, out of a global total of $27.77tn.\n\nRecovery in equity markets and other asset prices because of the flood of central bank money is behind most of \nthis growth in wealth rather than fresh entrepreneurial success or economic growth.\n\nFor private banks, however, the emerging markets still merit close attention. Bassam Salem, chief executive of \nCiti's private bank in Asia, says the emerging markets of the Middle East, Latin America and Asia make up roughly \n\n\n\nhalf the global private banking business and will pull ahead of the developed world. \"The emerging economies are \nslowing, but they are still producing better growth than the developed world,\" he says.\n\nWealth among the rich in emerging markets has grown with great rapidity in recent years, even if it is stuttering \nslightly now. The Middle East has continued to boom, adding more than 700 to its super-rich population and $170bn \nin assets.\n\nHowever, it is often harder than people expect to make money out of the wealthy in emerging markets, Mr Salem \nreckons, because much of their wealth is often tied up in their businesses, while the costs of running a private bank \nin terms of property, people and regulatory compliance are high and increasing.\n\nStaff - especially the vital relationship managers - can be very expensive in Asia and other emerging markets, \nbecause they are in very short supply. Barend Janssens, head of emerging markets at RBC Wealth Management, \nsays the talent shortage is a big inhibitor to private banks.\n\n\"Good private bankers who speak local languages and understand local customs are highly sought after, and with \ndemand for their skills higher than supply, costs are going up,\" he says. \"The industry needs to find a way to groom \ntalent in sufficient numbers to keep up with high client demand.\"\n\nThe demand is there and should keep growing - in spite of this year's hiccups. Roland Berger, the strategy \nconsultancy, predicts that global bankable assets will grow to almost EUR40tn by 2017, from EUR29tn at the end of \n2012. The fastest growth, it predicts, will come from Asia-Pacific, which it forecasts will see assets increase by 10 \nper cent annually to reach about EUR14tn by 2017.\n\nUBS for one still sees Asia as the most promising market in the years ahead. Kathryn Shih, head of UBS Wealth \nManagement Asia Pacific, says it will see the fastest growth out of all the emerging markets.\n\n\"Asia-Pacific has been growing faster than other emerging markets because it has had more political stability, which \npromotes economic stability,\" she says.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

First, he says, are the direct costs that \ncome from hiring more compliance staff, producing more documentation and upgrading IT systems.\n\n\n\nThen there are a number of indirect costs, such as the loss of revenue, as wealth managers are more restricted in \nthe types of products they can sell and in the way they treat clients.\n\nIn addition, says Mr Wilson, wealth managers need to be braced for more punitive fines if they are found to have \nbreached the tougher compliance rules.\n\n\"The cost of non-compliance has become very significant, both in terms of fines and costs for putting mistakes right, \nbut also in terms of reputational damage,\" he says.\n\nThere has been a spate of recent big fines on banks, and analysts say the penalties from regulators have harsher.\n\n\"Banks have been fined, not just for actual misconduct but for not being able to give proof they have complied,\" \nsays Christine Ciriani, a partner in the Geneva office of Capco, the financial services consultancy.\n\nShe says the tougher compliance rules require an entire change in culture. \"It used to be the case that as long as \nbanks could show they had done their best to manage risks, they should be OK.\n\n\"Now they have to prove ... they have done controls. That requires huge investment to put systems in place to \ncapture an act they may always have done but couldn't prove,\" says Ms Ciriani.\n\nShe says these developments mean banks are likely to reassess the kinds of operations they do in-house.\n\nWhereas, before the financial crisis, compliance costs would typically account for about 10-20 per cent of the \nmoney set aside each year for internal investment, that has now risen to about 50 per cent, says Capco.\n\nThat expense, as well as increased nervousness about fines, has prompted some big global banks to outsource \nparts of their business to specialist companies.\n\nBanks are also leaving markets.\n\nThis year, Lloyds Banking Group sold its international private banking arm to Swiss wealth management specialist \nUnion Bancaire Priv\u00e9e, for example, while last year Bank of America Merrill Lynch merged part of its wealth arm \nwith Julius Baer.\n\nCapgemini's Mr Wilson says banks will also attempt to combat the higher costs by imposing new demands on \nclients, such as minimum account balances, and limiting face-to-face advice to customers with larger portfolios.\n\n\"Overall, it will be increasingly difficult for firms to offer all services to all clients in all markets,\" he says.\n\n\"Future leaders of the sector are likely to be agile firms with niche offerings and large firms that can ... use the \ncompliance challenge as a catalyst for a more strategic transformation built around tech-nology and process \ninnovation.\"\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nCalled to account: European banks in line of fire\n\nNew regulations will have a particular impact on banks in Europe. KPMG, the accounting firm, identifies 10 key \nregulatory reforms facing the sector in 2013. These include:\n\nCapital\n\nEU directive CRD4, which implements the global Basel III standards for capital reserves, and the Financial Stability \nBoard's capital surcharge rules increase the amount and quality of capital banks must hold against their assets.\n\nLiquidity\n\n\n\nBanks must hold more liquid assets to meet a potential run on funds. KPMG says an extension to the range of \nassets qualifying as high quality liquid assets may ease concerns.\n\nCustomer treatment\n\nA series of new rules - from the European Mifid directive to the UK's Retail Distribution Review - aim to ensure \ncustomers are sold suitable products.\n\nSystemic risk\n\nEuropean banks, particularly, will be affected by new proposals to reduce risks to financial stability, including the \nstructural reforms proposed by the UK's Independent Commission on Banking (ICB) and the EU's Liikanen report.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The other is a Melbourne-\nbased banking group that generates almost 18 per cent of its profits from Asia, outside Australia and New Zealand.\n\nBut on closer inspection, the two banks need each other in the highly competitive world of Asian private banking, \nwhere there are many players - yet few, if any, with a sufficiently established regional brand to attract a critical mass \nof customers.\n\nVontobel will obtain access to ANZ's growing presence - and thus clients - in Asia, while ANZ will be able to use \nVontobel's \"strong global equity asset management capability\", says Stewart Brentnall, chief investment officer of \nANZ Global Wealth. \"Putting the two together will allow a more rapid growth than either bank would achieve on its \nown.\"\n\nWhether other banks will emulate this kind of arrangement - so far rare in the Asian private banking business - \nremains to be seen. But the forces behind it are here to stay.\n\nMcKinsey, the consultancy, said in its 2013 annual global private banking survey that, while assets under \nmanagement grew 17 per cent in Asia last year - which is more than double the rate for North America or western \nEurope - profit margins were just 17 basis points. That compares with 23bps in western Europe and 32bps in North \nAmerica.\n\nIntense competition, a tendency for wealthy Asians to use multiple private bankers, and high staff costs are likely to \nforce consolidation in the wealth management business in Singapore and could push operators out of business, top \nprivate bankers say.\n\nDeepak Sharma, chairman of Citi Private Bank and co-chair of the Singapore Private Banking Industry Group, says \nthe business is \"under tremendous test\".\n\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, the French bank, is looking to sell the rest of its private banking business in Asia, following the \nrecent disposal of its Japanese unit, according to people familiar with the process.\n\nThe move reflects the French group's cost-cutting and disposal programme, but it is also a sign of how intense the \ncompetition is in private banking in Singapore.\n\nIt may not always necessarily be the smallest banks that are forced to cut back, however. \"Smaller specialist shops \nare far more agile than the bigger banks, because of internal inertia, compliance pressures and external \nheadquarters making excessive demands,\" says Tim Gibson-Tullberg, head of southeast Asia at Sheffield Haworth, \na recruitment company.\n\n\n\nWestern banks also face cultural hurdles. Their Asian rivals have been pushing into wealth management in recent \nyears, in some cases making a virtue out of a decades-long presence servicing southeast Asia's ethnic Chinese \ncommunity, which is highly entrepreneurial and accounts for a disproportionate share of the region's wealth.\n\nUnited Overseas Bank, Singapore's third largest by assets, has a long history of serving the commercial banking \nand resulting wealth management needs of the Chinese minority in the region.\n\nIn Malaysia, where the bank opened its first branch 60 years ago, it is especially strong in cities with a higher \nconcentration of Chinese businesses such as Ipoh, Kota Kinabalu and Penang.\n\nThat means it is well positioned to attract business from people who may have relatively modest wealth now, but \nthat is set to grow as their businesses expand.\n\nJean Khong, a UOB spokeswoman, says: \"We don't believe in 'suitcase bankers', because nothing can replace \nlocal knowledge and the spirit of a handshake.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

But for \nmany banks it is now about cost-income ratios and bottom-line service,\" he says.\n\nOne reason for the change. Mr Parden says, is that many larger private banks are tied to the fortunes of their high-\nstreet parent companies, some of which are reducing branch numbers and closing private banking operations.\n\nA recent report from Ledbury, a market research group focused on wealthy individuals worldwide, found that a \nnumber of big banks - including Credit Suisse, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group and Citigroup - had outlined \nplans to pull back from some private banking activities in recent months.\n\nThis withdrawal is driving some clients to more traditional, family-owned wealth managers, which say they offer a \nmore personalised service, as they are too small to need call centres and have fewer customers per manager.\n\nThe Ledbury report supports that view. James Lawson, a director at the company, says client satisfaction tends to \nbe higher at the smaller houses.\n\n\"Our report found that client satisfaction among the smaller financial advisers was about 80 per cent - almost twice \nas high as the typical client of a larger international provider,\" he says.\n\n\n\nRoger Weatherby, chief executive of Weatherbys Bank, a 240-year old family-owned private bank that has its roots \nin the British horseracing industry, says demand for more traditional banking has been amplified by the financial \ncrisis.\n\n\"Clients who thought they had a close relationship with their bank suddenly find their wealth manager has gone - \nthey might have three relationship managers a year and don't feel known any more.\"\n\nMr Weatherby also says the big banks have been under pressure since the crisis to reduce their loan-to-deposit \nratios, meaning many have been forced to cut lending.\n\nBoutique private banks, whose growth is limited to retained earnings because they lack a diverse shareholder base \nto tap for funds, have kept to more conservative lending ratios.\n\nAnother attraction of small family-owned groups is that the family's own wealth is typically managed alongside \nclients' investments, providing an added incentive for vigilance.\n\nJames Hoare, portfolio manager at 350-year-old C. Hoare & Co, says there has been a significant \"flight to quality\" \nsince the financial crisis.\n\n\"A lot of that is based on the unique corporate structure of unlimited liability partner banks, where the family's \nwealth is completely aligned to customers,\" he says. \"During the recent crisis, customers have appreciated that.\"\n\nThere are a number of drawbacks to family-owned private banks, however.\n\nOne pitfall is that they generally cannot compete with the dominant high-street providers on choice.\n\nBanks such as Barclays, Credit Suisse and UBS can offer clients a far more sophisticated range of products, \nincluding access to their investment banking operations.\n\nIndeed, Ledbury's re-search shows that, rather than deserting the big players, some clients are moving in the \nopposite direction, consolidating their holdings with them.\n\nIts report showed that the proportion of wealthy clients that have at least 75 per cent of their investment portfolio \nwith their main bank has risen from 22 per cent to 33 per cent in the past year.\n\n\"The pendulum has swung. Where before, clients wanted to mitigate risks by diversifying their portfolios, some \nclients are now more comfortable with the convenience of one provider,\" says Mr Lawson.\n\n\"Local providers may well have the ability to build and maintain strong relationships, but they won't always have the \nmost suitable offerings.\"\n\nAmong the worst hit by this shift are the wealth operations of some of the UK retail banking brands, which sit in the \nmiddle ground between the biggest international banks and local family-owned banks.\n\nLedbury's report showed this group of banks had suffered a 7 percentage point fall in market share to 18 per cent in \nthe past year.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nProfile: C. Hoare & Co\n\nC. Hoare & Co may have been founded during the reign of Charles II, but the once seemingly antiquated \npartnership structure of the world's oldest family-owned bank is regaining fresh attention, writes Daniel Sch\u00e4fer.\n\nIts owners - seven descendants of the founding family - have unlimited liability for all its actions. As a result, the \nLondon-based private bank likes to play it safe. It hoards a third of customer deposits at the Bank of England and \nhas handed out the equivalent of only 40 per cent of its deposits as loans.\n\n\n\nThe bank also likes to stay small. It has only two branches and caters to fewer than 7,000 families and wealthy \nindividuals.\n\nInstead of grandiose plans, it prefers spending a sizeable amount of its profits on technology such as its mobile and \nonline banking applications.\n\n\"Forty years ago people were wondering if two branches were really enough for us. But the rise of online banking \nshows that if you just wait long enough, then things come back to you,\" says Jeremy Marshall, chief executive.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Regulators around the globe might be debating if banks are too \nbig to fail but in private banking, the giants are becoming ever more dominant.\n\nLast year, the top 20 wealth managers gained market share from smaller operators with an average increase in \nassets under management of 10.9 per cent, according to Scorpio Partnership, a consultancy and research group.\n\n\"In spite of a number of challenges - both economic and regulatory - we have seen the confirmation of a new \nchampions' league of global wealth managers,\" says Sebastian Dovey, managing partner at Scorpio.\n\nThe top 20 command more than three-quarters of total assets under management, as wealthy clients often want a \nsingle bank relationship. Squeezed margins and tougher regulation, meanwhile, are hitting smaller rivals \ndisproportionately.\n\n\"The barriers to entry have become huge,\" says J\u00fcrg Zeltner, head of UBS's wealth management arm, which last \nyear overtook Bank of America as the largest private banking operation in the world measured by assets under \nmanagement.\n\n\"To be able to deal with clients' cross-border demands, with regulatory compliance and to make money in an area \nthat is under margin pressure is quite an agenda,\" he adds. \"This is an annuity business and you need a \nsustainable growing asset base.\"\n\nLarge global banks including Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs have in recent years \nrediscovered wealth management as profits have come under pressure in traditional areas such as investment \nbanking. UBS itself launched a strategy to concentrate on its core wealth management business by drastically \npruning the bond trading business of its investment bank.\n\nLarge and diversified banks have been more successful in containing costs than pure-play private banks. The \nformer spend 75 cents for every dollar they earn in revenues in their wealth-management arms, while banks \nfocused solely on wealth management had a cost-income ratio of 88 per cent in the past year.\n\nDiversified groups can reduce costs by centralising certain administrative, compliance and portfolio management \nfunctions. They can tap into their retail banking network to build a presence in growth markets.\n\nSmaller operators, on the other hand, are struggling to keep costs in check amid myriad regulatory and risk-\nmanagement demands.\n\n\"All the trends in the market are pushing you to be bigger, whether it is regulation, service models or \ninternationalisation,\" says Tim Monger, financial institutions partner at Boston Consulting Group.\n\nEven the largest players have been forced to curb some of their activities amid relentless pressure on costs and \nprofit margins.\n\nRapidly rising expenditure to make sure banks do not break anti-money laundering rules are making it particularly \nuneconomic for all but the leading global wealth managers to remain active in smaller markets.\n\n\n\nBarclays this year announced it would pull out of more than 100 markets and cut staff in its wealth management \nbusiness to boost the unit's feeble profitability.\n\nThe UK bank said it would reduce the number of countries in which it provides wealth and investment management \nservices from about 200 to 70 by the end of 2016.\n\nIts decision followed rival Credit Suisse's announcement this year that its private bank would exit or withdraw from \nabout 50 markets worldwide by 2014 to bolster profitability. HSBC also wound down its Irish private banking arm in \nOctober last year.\n\n\"There was a dash five years ago to open up booking centres across the globe, only for the banks to realise later \nthat they are not profitable,\" Mr Monger says. \"Now this is reversing.\"\n\nA string of other large banks including Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley have sold overseas \noperations. This represents an attempt to concentrate on those core regions where they are among the market \nleaders.\n\n\"Critical mass is becoming more and more important in order to be able to achieve the right economics,\" says \nJeroen Rijpkema, chief executive of ABN Amro Private Banking.\n\n\"Even the bigger players think about which markets they are good in and which smaller ones they won't make a \ndifference in and where it is better to exit.\"\n\nABN Amro Private Banking is an example of this trend. It sold its Swiss private banking operation two years ago \nand bought LGT Bank in Germany, a market in which it already had reasonable scale.\n\nBankers say the consolidation trend will continue. The biggest wealth managers look likely both to spin off regional \nentities and act as buyers of private banking operations.\n\nUBS's Mr Zeltner adds: \"We are a natural consolidator in this industry. We are always looking for very targeted \nacquisitions that either give us further scale or an entry into a new market.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

The smallest bets on its 66 gaming \n\n\n\ntables will be HK$5,000 and shopping at the Graff Diamonds store and other luxury outlets in its mall will be by \nappointment only.\n\nWelcome to the world of Asia's rich.\n\nAsia is producing more new wealth than any other part of the world at any point in history. Over the past five years, \nthe assets of rich individuals have grown at triple the rate of the wealthy elsewhere, while the number of rich people \nhas increased by twice that of other regions, according to the recent annual survey by Capgemini and Royal Bank \nof Canada.\n\nTheir number grew by almost 10 per cent to reach 3.7m last year, according to the survey, while their wealth \nexpanded by 12 per cent to $12tn.\n\nFor \"ultra-high-net-worth\" people, who have more than $30m in net assets, the story is a little different. More people \nfrom the US and Europe entered this club in the past year than from anywhere else - the population in China and \nBrazil actually declined slightly - according to research by Wealth-X and UBS.\n\nThere are only 199,235 such individuals in the whole world, but unsurprisingly they are the main focus of private \nbanks and wealth managers. They will often have $20m tied in a business, with $5m in property and $5m to play \nwith, says Mykolas Rambus, chief executive of Wealth-X.\n\n\"The reason this market is so lucrative is that a lot of the wealth is not very liquid yet,\" he says. \"They are likely to \nhave a monetising event within a couple of years, like a listing, and they tend to spread their wealth around among \na number of banks.\"\n\nThere are many more potential clients among those with $5m or less, but they might only have liquid assets of \n$250,000 or less. \"You cannot make money out of that in today's high cost regimes,\" Mr Rambus adds.\n\nThe newly rich can be much more demanding clients for private banks and other wealth managers, partly because \nthey can take some convincing that a service they have never used or thought about is worth paying for.\n\nOn top of this, as they are normally still tied in with their businesses, their investment expectations are for much \nhigher returns than those who have been wealthier for longer and are more interested in preservation.\n\n\"For the new rich, investments in wealth management compete directly with their businesses for capital, so any \ninvestment needs to generate a higher return than they could get by reinvesting in the company,\" says Kathryn \nShih, head of UBS Wealth Management Asia Pacific. \"Also, they have a home bias; they like to know the \ncompanies they are going to invest in.\"\n\nOf course, those whose wealth is really new are also more interested in flaunting it - or at least buying some of the \ntrappings such as cars, watches, properties and so on.\n\nBut private banking executives say these things are bought early - and often with borrowed money - by the merely \naffluent, rather than the really rich.\n\nFor those with $30m or more, the first thing they want to buy once they hit that bracket is an aircraft, according to \nBassam Salem, chief executive of Citi's private bank in Asia.\n\n\"The newly rich are a bit more exuberant in terms of showing their wealth initially,\" he says. \"But it takes a little while \nto become ultra-wealthy for most. The richer you are, the less you want to show it in many countries.\"\n\nThe exception to this is mainland China, where more people have become vastly rich in a much shorter time \nbecause of the explosive pace of growth in recent years. The average age of Citi's ultra-rich clients in Asia \nexcluding Japan is about 70, according to Mr Salem, whereas in China it is 35.\n\n\n\nMr Rambus makes a similar observation, noting that the average age of millionaires in China is about 33, but that of \nthe world's ultra-wealthy is 52.\n\nIn spite of cathedrals to excess such as the coming Louis XIII resort in Macau, Mr Rambus says the super wealthy \nin Asia, as in other parts of the world, are becoming less visible in terms of splashing the cash.\n\n\"There are many countries where visibility is not good culturally and where it is becoming less advisable if you want \nto keep your wealth,\" he says.\n\nSo, once the Louis XIII opens to its exclusive clientele in 2015, it is more likely that anyone who makes a noise \nabout having stayed there is perhaps either lying, or at the lower end of that casino's clientele.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The surge in postal voting at the last election \nbrought about a rise in the number of complaints about fraud, and electoral experts warn the problem could be \nworse if online voting was allowed.\n\nMr Bercow was presenting his vision for making parliament more accountable via electronic means, including \nthrough e-petitions, putting bills online and getting MPs to interact more through digital media.\n\nThe speaker has established a commission to look into his proposals, which is due to report in 2015.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Some supplies have \narrived at key ports, but damage to roads and lack of operating trucks and gasoline limit their distribution. Recent \nefforts are making progress, particularly due to the arrival of a US Navy carrier and its helicopters, but are \ninsufficient.\n\nA substantial Philippine military presence has been established, which has stopped the looting. This opens the \nopportunity for airdropping supplies for the military to distribute. The US is taking the lead in relief efforts, but these \nare too limited and, for many, too late. We must airdrop supplies to secure drop zones set up by the military away \nfrom existing airports but close to the devastated cities. Then supplies can be distributed in a disciplined manner. It \nis reported that America has started to use airdrops from large transport aircraft, but this is nowhere near enough. \nMany nations that have offered assistance operate large transport aircraft, including Australia, Japan, the US, \nBritain and other European countries. They have not been asked to make them available for airdrops. Food, water, \ntents, medical supplies and so on are available in the Manila area and do not have to be expensively imported.\n\n\n\nThere is adequate capacity for large transport aircraft at the main airports, and in addition the airports at Clark and \nSubic can be used.\n\nThe immediate crucial need is potable water, which Manila has in abundance. It would be preferable to drop large \ncontainers. However, I am not sure if they would survive the landing impact. It may be necessary to use smaller \nstandard units such as five-gallon jerry jugs. That is easy to test locally and quickly.\n\nEven at this late stage, defined drop zones and disciplined distribution would make a big difference. This approach \nwould also lay the groundwork for effective preparation for the next typhoon, starting with placing Filipino troops at \nsafe installations in threatened cities as soon as the course of the next typhoon is clear.\n\nRobert Laidley, President, The Atlantic and Conservation Institute, New York, NY, US\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Inflation has not ended the year close to the 4.5 per cent target since 2009, also a point of concern for \ninvestors who accuse the ruling Workers' party of abusing the inflation-targeting regime that has been a \ncornerstone of Brazil's development.\n\nBrazil's U-turn on monetary policy this year has therefore been welcomed by many who see it as a sign of the \ncentral bank's greater autonomy. Alexandre Tombini, the bank's president, has indicated that neutral real rates (the \ninterest rate, after deducting inflation, which neither stimulates nor contains the economy) are about 5 per cent, \nsuggesting he would prefer to see the Selic closer to 11 per cent to compensate for inflation of nearly 6 per cent..\n\nThe tightening cycle has been a \"step in the right direction\", according to the OECD in a report in October in which it \ncalled for the bank to be given formal independence. However, Luciano Rostagno, chief strategist at Banco Mizuho \nin S\u00e3o Paulo, says the cycle is simply the result of international factors and a change of strategy by the \ngovernment, which continues to call the shots at the central bank.\n\nBy pushing down interest rates to record lows, the government had hoped to attract private investment to boost the \ncountry's dismal investment to gross domestic product ratio of less than 20 per cent. But those billions of dollars of \ninvestment never appeared, partly because of the government's reluctance to reduce state intervention in the \neconomy and wean the country off Brazil's state bank, BNDES, which dominates the domestic market as it lends at \ncheaper rates than private institutions. Expectations the US Federal Reserve would begin reducing its monetary \nstimulus also prompted investors to flee emerging markets worldwide, particularly those like Brazil that suffer from \nboth budget and current account deficits.\n\nWith growth faltering, the government turned once again to higher spending, making the country's low interest rates \nunsustainable, says Mr Rostagno. A sharp depreciation of the real against the dollar also raised the cost of imports, \nadding further inflationary pressure. And when mass protests broke out in June, threatening Ms Rousseff's chances \nof re-election next year, the government knew it had no choice but to change tack, he says.\n\nBut if it continues to dole out vast amounts of subsidised state lending and other fiscal incentives, the effect of the \ntightening cycle on prices will be more limited than it might be in other economies, says Insper's Mr Moura.\n\nIt may also do little at this stage to improve the credibility of the government's economic team, which is facing \ngrowing criticism over its lack of fiscal discipline, he says. \"Credibility is a tricky thing; it takes a long time to build \nbut you can lose it in an instant\".\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

It was much the same in Germany, as I recall.\n\nIn this day and age, however, it is a common occurrence to hear French politicians, industrialists, civil servants and \nacademics expressing themselves with force and clarity in idiomatic English, and it seems a pity to comment \ndisparagingly in your columns on the occasional official lapse into franglais.\n\nMost English individuals of the same rank are, it is said, still resolutely monoglot. And it is still possible to drive from \nFrance and arrive quite naturally in Trafalgar Square where it is still not obvious which exit to take for Birmingham.\n\nRobert Morris, London N2, UK\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by \nemail or post to the web.\n\nFrom Prof Lothar Funk.\n\nSir, It has long been taboo among Germany's pro-market elites to question the country's export strength. The same \nhas held true for domestic stability policies since the sweeping employment-related reforms of a decade ago.\n\nThe position of the former CDU-CSU and Free Democrat coalition was unmistakable: \"The current account balance \nis not a political target for the federal government\" (National Reform Programme 2012). Assuming more or less \nsound monetary policies by the supranational European Central Bank and that Germany does not support or \nprotect its exports more than other important trading nations, everything seems fine if domestic macroeconomic \ngoals are achieved. Economic policy can concentrate on improving supply-side conditions for better growth and \nhigher employment in the medium term. Current account surpluses can be neglected.\n\nHowever, the influential independent council of economic experts (\"wise men\") noted on November 13 that German \nbanks had originally contributed substantially to the European sovereign debt problem (Annual Report 2013/14, no. \n391). Thus German banks' risky loans abroad were part of the problem and, with hindsight, contributed to bad \ninvestments abroad. This was only possible due to a lasting gap between savings and investments.\n\nThus the head of DIW Berlin, Marcel Fratzscher (\"Investment, not the surplus, is Germany's big problem\", \nNovember 19), is right to ask the incoming government to invest in outdated infrastructure and to increase \nincentives for domestic private investment. The new CDU-CSU and Social Democrat coalition will most likely lead \nto additional spending on education, energy transformation, pensioners and higher wages in the low-wage sector. If \nimplemented in a reasonable way, the new approach of the government will reduce German net exports.\n\nThe hope is that the potential damage done to Germany's domestic supply-side will at least be offset by the positive \neffects of these reforms in ensuring greater stability beyond Germany. Nevertheless, a German policy swing cannot \nsubstitute for domestic reform efforts in the countries still in crisis.\n\nIn 2009-10 Germany stimulated its economy more than average for an EU member state. Now it will again \ncontribute to rebalancing. The new policies may improve the cyclical climate and inflation in the short term. Such \ndemand management is played down in public statements since German officials love to respect national economic \nidols such as Walter Eucken, the founder of ordoliberalism, and Ludwig Erhard, the first economics minister - both \ndefinitely non-Keynesians. In practice, however, Keynesian ideas are hardly dead even in Germany. Owing to the \n\n\n\nbad side-effects, very special circumstances are necessary before any rough steering of the demand side - but \nthese include the deep crisis of 2009-10 and today's eurozone problems.\n\nLothar Funk, Professor of International Economic Relations, D\u00fcsseldorf University of Applied Sciences, D\u00fcsseldorf, \nGermany\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Indeed, historically - in Russia's debates on empire and \nnation in the 1910s, in the immediate aftermath of the 1917 upheaval and again following the 1991 Soviet \ndisintegration, as well as in today's discussion of the Eurasian Union - Ukraine has been perceived by Russia's \nrulers as an absolutely pivotal state.\n\nWithout 40m-plus Ukrainians who would associate themselves with Russia-Eurasia (or, in Vladimir Putin's preferred \nterm, Russian \"state-civilisation\") there could be no \"Eurasia\" as a geopolitical reality (a crucial \"Euro\" element will \nbe missing) and no Staatsvolk - the Greater Russian nation comprising also the other eastern Slavs (Ukrainians \nand Belarusians) - to effectively rule these vast expanses. (Note that in his recent speeches President Putin \nreiterated that Russians and Ukrainians are one people.)\n\nAnd yet, although Russian pressure did play an important role in forcing Kiev to suspend talks with Brussels, it's \njust one of the factors in play. For all post-Soviet elites, including the Ukrainian rulers, the paramount interest \nremains the perpetuation of their power. For Viktor Yanukovich, Ukraine's president, this means securing his re-\nelection in 2015. He appears to have decided that both the political demands advanced by the EU (the release of \nYulia Tymoshenko) and the immediate economic consequences of the Association Agreement (clearly \ndisadvantageous for the faltering Ukrainian economy) are too high a price to pay for Ukraine's \"European \norientation\" - precisely because they would diminish his chances to get himself re-elected. Some folks in Brussels \nstill cannot grasp the simple truth that Mr Yanukovich and his ilk don't want to join anything: they want to balance ad \ninfinitum and extract maximum profits from this geopolitical balancing act. In a word, they are balancers, not joiners \n- and this refers to their relations with Moscow too.\n\nIgor Torbakov, Uppsala University, Sweden\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Days later JPMorgan announced its entire physical \ncommodities business was for sale.\n\nUS law generally prohibits mixing banking and commerce, with broad exemptions.\n\nIn letters, emails and phone calls, bank lawyers and Fed officials discussed Henry Bath, the global warehouse \nempire that JPMorgan acquired as part of a $1.6bn push into commodities in 2010. The correspondence, first \nreported by Reuters, shows Henry Bath's future was in question far earlier than previously thought.\n\nIn June 2012, JPMorgan told the Federal Reserve Bank of New York it planned to classify Henry Bath as a \n\"merchant banking\" investment, a legal designation that allows 10 years of ownership. Goldman Sachs owns \nmetals warehouses under the same provision, executives there have said.\n\nIn November 2012, the Fed required JPMorgan to file \"a detailed plan to divest or conform the Henry Bath \ninvestment\" and provide quarterly reports detailing the bank's actions \"in accordance with the divestiture plan\", a \nletter shows.\n\nIn March, JPMorgan filed a quarterly report indicating it had begun sale talks and also taken steps to cut the bank's \nown metals inventories inside Henry Bath's warehouses.\n\n\"Strategic discussions with third parties, including various financial institutions, regarding an outright sale of a \nportion of JPMC's equity interest are continuing,\" Mark Lenczowski, a JPMorgan lawyer, wrote.\n\nJPMorgan declined to comment. The Fed has given it until July 2014 to divest Henry Bath or find a way to bring it in \nline with the rules, according to the most recently dated letter.\n\nThe correspondence does not make clear whether JPMorgan has been required to sell Henry Bath or has decided \nto do so on its own. The value of the business will probably be far less than in 2010, as new rules from the London \nMetal Exchange threaten to cut warehouse profitability.\n\nGoldman is likely to step up discussions over a sale of its metals warehousing business, having received more than \na dozen expressions of interest, the FT reported last week.\n\nFed chair nominee Janet Yellen said at a confirmation hearing that the regulator was considering additional rules \nfor banks that own physical commodity businesses. But the Fed is limited in what it can do for the investment banks \nthat became Fed-regulated bank holding companies, Morgan Stanley and Goldman, in the wake of the financial \ncrisis in 2008.\n\nBecause Congress by statute allowed those banks to have those businesses in a grandfather clause, the Fed \ncannot force them to back out of them. But the Fed can evaluate them based on safety and soundness standards, \nwhich could mean additional capital charges, obtaining special approval for certain activities and other regulatory \nhurdles.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

At the same time, \nthe industry is battling against from satellite TV and phone companies.\n\nSome cable executives say that consolidation also could help television distributors in their battle with programmers \nover fee increases.\n\n\"The fact that Charter plans to finance this deal with debt increases the odds that the coming consolidation will drive \ncost-cutting in service, infrastructure and content,\" said Barry Parr, a media analyst with Outsell.\n\nTime Warner Cable shares have climbed almost 47 per cent since the start of the year as a result of expectations of \na bid.\n\nAll parties involved declined to comment.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

For economists, \nit appeared to be a signal that Brazil's tightening cycle could finally be nearing its end.\n\n\n\n\"It seems like a pretty neutral statement on its own but when you look at it in the sequence of other statements . . . it \ncould be read as the first step to changing the pace of tightening in January,\" said Marcelo Salomon, an economist \nat Barclays.\n\nNext week's gross domestic product data that are expected to show that Brazil's economy contracted in the third \nquarter could lead the bank to increase the Selic rate by only 25 basis points at its next meeting in January, said Mr \nSalomon.\n\nSince April, the central bank has raised interest rates by a total of 275 basis points in what has been seen as a \ndramatic U-turn in the country's monetary policy and a symbolic defeat for President Dilma Rousseff.\n\nWhen Brazil pushed its Selic rate down to a record low of 7.25 per cent in October last year, it raised hopes that the \ncountry could finally rid itself of its traditionally high borrowing costs.\n\nHowever, rising inflation has forced the central bank to change tack, especially as complaints over price rises and \nfrequent protests across the country threaten to damage Ms Rousseff's popularity ahead of presidential elections \nnext year.\n\nAnnual inflation broke through the 6.5 per cent ceiling of the country's tolerance band in both March and June this \nyear, and still stands around 5.8 per cent - far from the country's 4.5 per cent target level.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

It is a trusted healthcare \nretailer, founded, like Cadbury, by philanthropic Victorians. But in its modern incarnation it is a tax-savvy group, \nwhich was purchased for \u00a312bn in 2007 by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and entrepreneur Stefano Pessina.\n\nWar on Want is the latest righter of perceived wrongs attracted by the contrast. The charity alleges that \"entities \napparently controlled by Mr Pessina have achieved exceptionally profitable results\" from offshore transactions.\n\nAB \"categorically refutes\" the claims, which it says are defamatory. Sadly for the group, Britons are now \npredisposed to believe the worst of businesses. The syndrome was illustrated last year by Starbucks, forced to pay \n\u00a320m in tax it did not owe to placate politicians disturbed by its transfer pricing arrangements.\n\nThe bone of contention between AB and WoW is a debt buyback. According to the charity and US affiliate Change \nto Win, businesses linked to Mr Pessina bought \u00a3257m of the pharmacy group's loans in 2009-2012. From 2010, \nAB allegedly started buying hybrid securities from companies associated with Mr Pessina.\n\nThe transactions looked oddly circular to the charities. The market value of equivalent corporate debt had jumped \nby the time AB repurchased one chunk of loans, they say.\n\nPeople close to the company riposte that AB received the bulk of the value of well-timed debt repurchases.

They anticipate the merged airline to be the US's largest by sales.\n\nSean Lane, the judge who has handled AMR's case since it sought bankruptcy protection in November 2011, \ndismissed an effort by Joseph Alioto, attorney for a private group seeking to block the transaction, to delay closing.\n\nThe judge ruled that the merger could go ahead while Mr Alioto's clients pursued their private antitrust claim over \nthe deal. He approved a deal earlier this month between the merging companies and the US Department of Justice \nthat averted a DoJ effort to seek a complete block on the deal.\n\nThe companies agreed to give up take-off and landing slots at Washington's Reagan National Airport and New \nYork's LaGuardia Airport and two gates at each of Boston Logan, Chicago O'Hare, Dallas Love Field, Los Angeles \nInternational and Miami International airports.\n\nMike Trevino, a spokesman for American Airlines, said the judge's rulings were \"another important step\" on the \ncompany's path towards emerging from bankruptcy and merging with US Airways.\n\n\"The new American will compete on a global scale with a network that benefits our people, our customers and the \ncommunities we serve,\" he said.\n\nmailto:jonathan.guthrie@ft.com\n\n\nMr Alioto was seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent the deal going ahead while his clients sought \ndepositions from Doug Parker, chief executive of US Airways, and Tom Horton, AMR's chief executive.

Odebrecht said it was \noffering assistance to the victims' families but gave no reason for the crane's collapse.\n\nBrazil has struggled to deliver the infrastructure needed to host the World Cup next year, as well as the Olympics in \n2016, and construction firms are working around the clock at stadiums and airports to get the country ready in time. \nThe draw for the tournament takes place next Friday in Bahia.\n\nJerome Valcke, Fifa general secretary, said he was \"extremely shocked\" at the incident in a message on Twitter. \n\"The Department of Labour and the local authorities will fully investigate the reasons behind such a tragic accident,\" \nFifa said in a later statement.\n\nBrazil's relationship with the football body is already under strain after violent protests broke out earlier this year \nduring the Confederations Cup, considered to be a dress rehearsal for the World Cup.\n\nWhen Brazil's government won bids to host the World Cup and the Olympics a few years ago, the events were \nseen as a chance to showcase the country's booming economy and recent progress. However, as growth has \nslowed they have instead become a focus of resentment among many Brazilians, who argue the money should be \nspent on improving poor public services.\n\nFurther protests are expected during next year's World Cup, especially as it takes place in the run-up to the \ncountry's presidential elections.\n\n\"Next year is going to be pretty chaotic - with the eyes of the world on us, protesters are going to want to take \nadvantage of that,\" says Marcelo Moura, a professor of macroeconomics and finance at Insper, a Brazilian \neducation and research institute.\n\nTuesday's accident at the stadium, officially called Arena Corinthians but known as \"Itaquer\u00e3o\", prompted an \noutpouring of grief on social media from fans of Corinthians, one of the most popular teams in the football-obsessed \nnationq.\n\n\n\n\"It's a sad day for the victim's families and for Brazilian football,\" tweeted one fan, while others called for a period of \nnational mourning.\n\nThe stadium was also known as being a pet project of former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, one of the team's \nbiggest supporters who is reported to have helped rally funding for the project.\n\nAdditional reporting by Roger Blitz in London\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

However, the US has already challenged the move by flying a pair of B52 bombers \nthrough the area, and the new Chinese rules are now being widely flouted by Japanese airlines. The move has \nalso been criticised by South Korea, Taiwan and Australia.\n\nLast weekend's announcement has opened up a new front in an increasingly bitter territorial dispute between \nAsia's two largest economies over a group of uninhabited islands, known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu \nin China. The controversy is part of a broader contest for influence in the western Pacific between China, which has \ninvested heavily in its navy over the past two decades, and the US and its allies.\n\nA senior US official said on Wednesday Mr Biden, who visits Japan, China and South Korea next week, would not \nbe \"delivering a demarche\" to Beijing and would focus on trying to reduce tensions in North Asia.\n\nHowever, the official added: \"There is an emerging pattern of [Chinese] behaviour that is unsettling to China's own \nneighbours and which raises questions about how China operates in international space and deals with areas of \ndisagreement with its neighbours.\"\n\nIn a sign of mounting tensions, on Tuesday the US  flew the unarmed B52 bombers across the zone without asking \nBeijing's permission in what appeared to be a direct challenge to the Chinese claim.\n\nThe Pentagon said the flights were a long-planned training mission and insisted the US would continue to operate \nin what it considers to be international air space. China on Wednesday said it had monitored the US aircraft.\n\nTensions in the region were raised on Saturday, when China's civil aviation authority put out an order for all flights \nplanning to pass through a new \"air defence identification zone\" (ADIZ) to notify Beijing, or risk unspecified \n\"emergency defensive measures\".\n\nJapan's two largest long-haul carriers, JAL and ANA, instantly complied with the order - a position at odds with the \nJapanese government, which said it refused to recognise the unilateral imposition of a zone that overlapped with its \nown. It was \"extremely regrettable\", the government said, that China's new zone included air space over a \ndisputed chain of islands in the East China Sea.\n\nBut on Wednesday, following instructions from Tokyo, JAL and ANA said they were no longer complying with the \nChinese order, and that dozens of daily flights between Japan and Taiwan, Hong Kong and southeast Asia would \nproceed as normal. About 50 flights by Japanese carriers criss-cross the area every day, according to Japan's \nforeign ministry.\n\nNeither airline reported any problems as the first flights travelled through the ADIZ without notifying China.\n\n\n\n\"As the establishment of the ADIZ is unilateral, we want China to retract it and we don't accept it,\" said Japan's \ndefence minister Itsunori Onodera. \"The US is handling the matter with the same stance as Japan.\"\n\nAirlines in the region are still reviewing what the new rules from China mean for their operations, said Andrew \nHerdman, director-general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines. Still unclear, he said, are how the new zone \nmight affect co-ordination between air traffic controllers and whether it could lead to conflicting instructions on flight \nplans, among other technical issues.\n\n\"Clarification is being sought from the relevant authorities,\" he said.\n\nThe Chinese claim is part of a broader push by Beijing to assert greater control over the seas that surround it and \nto push back against US influence in the western Pacific, where the US Navy has been dominant since the end of \nthe second world war.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;Some Chinese commentators on the country's Twitter-like Weibo social networking site called on Beijing to take \nfirm action against Japan to enforce the flight restrictions but there have been no anti-Japan protests like those \nwitnessed at the end of 2012 which damaged economic relations between the two countries.\n\nCaroline Kennedy, the new US ambassador to Tokyo, described Japan as her country's \"most important ally in \nAsia\". In her first speech in the post in Tokyo on Wednesday, Ms Kennedy said China's move to establish the ADIZ \nwas \"an attempt to change the status quo in the East China Sea\", and thus served only \"to increase tensions in the \nregion\".\n\nA Japanese foreign ministry official suggested that China's recent moves were consistent with the \"cabbage \nstrategy\" adopted in its spat with the Philippines, in which it tries to surround disputed territories with layers of \ndefences, packed tight like a cabbage. The term has been traced to a May TV interview with Zhang Zhaozhong, a \nChinese military scholar.\n\nSeparately, Taiwan said that it is complying with China's order.\n\nAdditional reporting by Mitsuko Matsutani and Nobuko Juji in Tokyo and Sarah Mishkin in Taipei\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Seasonally adjusted, factory exports rose 0.36 per cent from \nSeptember to October, reflecting strengthening US demand, to where Mexico sends nearly 80 per cent of its \nexports. Imports of parts used by factories to make goods also rose 0.66 per cent in compared to the previous \nmonth. However, imports of non-oil consumer goods decreased 0.19 per cent month on month, a sign of weaker \nconsumer demand.\n\nEurope\n\n\n\nSwitzerland: The UBS consumption indicator fell from 1.56 points in September to 1.28 points in October. The \ndecrease was influenced by a lower evaluation of business conditions in the retail sector. Good figures for new car \nregistrations and an improvement in consumer sentiment prevented a steeper drop in the consumption sentiment.\n\nGermany: According to the GfK Consumer Climate study, households were equally optimistic in November \ncompared with October. Although economic and income expectations registered considerable increases, and \nwillingness to buy reached a seven-year high, the indicator remained unchanged from October to November, at 7.1 \npoints in November. The indicator is expected to increase to 7.4 points in December.\n\nFrance: Household confidence decreased slightly in November, with the index at 84 points - one point less than the \n85 registered in October. While households' opinion about their current saving capacity was almost stable, their \nopinion about their future saving capacity decreased. Views about the general economic situation in France, both \nfuture and current, also worsened.\n\nSpain: In October, the seasonally-adjusted general retail trade index rate went down 1.8 per cent compared to \nSeptember and 0.5 per cent year on year, after going up 2.1 per cent in September. Seasonally adjusted, the retail \nsales index went down for almost all products year on year, especially personal equipment, which decreased 3.5 \nper cent.\n\nSweden: The trade balance decreased 24.1 per cent from September to October, from $882m to $669m. Both \nimports and exports increased in October compared to the previous month, 6.9 per cent and 4.9 per cent, \nrespectively.\n\nNorway: Unemployment fell from 3.5 per cent in the second quarter to 3.1 per cent in the third quarter.\n\nUK: The economy grew 0.8 per cent in the third quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics' second \nestimate of gross domestic product. The estimate confirmed the UK's recovery gathered pace in the three months \nto September, following growth of 0.7 per cent in the second quarter and 0.4 per cent in the first three months of the \nyear.\n\nAsia-Pacific\n\nChina: Oil demand rose 0.9 per cent year on year, after an end-September price cut. October inventory adjusted oil \ndemand was driven by petrol demand growth, which rebounded to 14.5 per cent year on year. Year to date oil \ndemand is up 3.6 per cent year on year, marginally higher than September.\n\nThailand: After going up 0.47 per cent in September, trade balance decreased 1.77 per cent in October year on \nyear, registering a $1.77bn deficit. Exports slipped 0.7 per cent from October last year, going down for the second \nmonth in a row. Imports were also lower for the third month in a row, shrinking 5.37 per cent.\n\nAustralia: After a 0.1 per cent rise in the second quarter, real construction rose by 2.7 per cent in the third quarter - \nthe strongest rise since 2012. Although total private residential investment had been responding to lower interest \nrates, it fell 1.2 per cent after a 1.4 per cent rise in the second quarter. The construction of new homes went up 0.3 \nper cent. Meanwhile, private engineering construction increased 6.9 per cent in the third quarter, after sliding over \nthe past three quarters.\n\nWith additional reporting by Robin Harding in Washington and Claire Jones in London\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

But on Wednesday, the Russian \ngovernment banned an exhibit by Louis Vuitton, the brand seen by many as the incarnation of luxury, in Red \nSquare for being too over-the-top.\n\n\n\nThe 34-metre-long pavilion in the trademark form of an LV suitcase had already become a tourist attraction in its \nown right since it was set up 10 days ago in the heart of a city that boasts the second highest number of billionaires \nin the world.\n\nLast weekend, tourists were queuing to have their picture taken in front of it. Just a few steps from Lenin's \nmausoleum - Russian bloggers have joked that LV stands for \"Lenin, Vladimir\" - it had been meant to house an \nexhibition on the history of travel as of next week.\n\nBut following an outcry from politicians and some civic groups, GUM, the luxury department store through which the \nFrench group organised the display, pulled the event, citing objections from the Kremlin. Dmitry Peskov, \nspokesman for President Vladimir Putin, explained the pavilion was seen as \"out of proportion\".\n\nLouis Vuitton said it was not yet in a position to comment. A source close to the group's Russian arm said: \"This is \na bit of an outlandish campaign. And it's a real pity because it's a project linked to charity.\" The proceeds from the \nplanned exhibition had been earmarked for a children's' charity headed by Natalya Vodyanova, the model and \ngirlfriend of the son of Bernard Arnault, head of LVMH.\n\nFor Louis Vuitton, the backlash comes as a surprise as it has held similar shows in other countries. This summer, \nDior, another top French brand, held a fashion show on Red Square without any problem.\n\nBut it is not the first time the bold display of western brands in former, or currently Communist countries has raised \nhackles. In June 2011, a Louis Vuitton-organised exhibition in China's National Museum, normally a venue of \npatriotic education, triggered a wave of criticism and mockery.\n\nThe US coffee shop chain Starbucks was thrown out of the Forbidden City amid complaints that it was desecrating \nChinese traditional culture.\n\nSome Muscovites expressed similar feelings. \"I think it is an ill fit here. I think in general there are far too many \nstalls and stages on Red Square all the time,\" said Nadezhda Semyonova, an elderly woman looking at the \ninstallation on Wednesday night.\n\nBut inside GUM, Russia's own luxury retail palace whose fa\u00e7ade contributes to the splendour of the Unesco \nheritage site on Red Square, many were unimpressed by the fuss. \"Everyone in Moscow loves the good life, even if \nthere are a lot of things wrong with our country,\" said a young woman in a mink jacket at a caf\u00e9 under the \ndepartment store's glass domes.\n\n\"So now you're going to condemn a display of that - how hypocritical can you get?\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

They have held demonstrations attended by hundreds of thousands, and seen a steady rise in \npopular support for independence in the region.\n\nUnlike the national movement in Scotland, however, they have yet to publish a detailed blueprint spelling out what a \nbreakaway state would look like. More importantly, they have also yet to work out how - or when - to hold a \nreferendum on Catalan independence.\n\n\"It seems we have two categories of Europeans here - some who are allowed to vote and some who are not,\" said \nRicard Gen\u00e9, a senior member of the Catalan National Assembly (ANC), the grassroots movement that has led the \npopular push for independence. \"The Scottish path is the one we want to follow. The problem is that Spain will not \nallow a referendum.\"\n\n\n\nThe ANC and other pro-independence forces in Catalonia insist that a referendum, or a more informal consultation, \nshould go ahead next year. In the Catalan parliament, however, the main nationalist parties continue to squabble \nover when exactly to hold a plebiscite, and what precise question to put to voters. On Tuesday, the pro-\nindependence parties in parliament decided to postpone a motion spelling out the referendum timetable.\n\nThe national government in Madrid is fiercely opposed to creating a Catalan state, and argues that even a \nreferendum would violate the Spanish constitution.\n\nThe hope among Catalan activists now is that the build-up to the Scottish referendum on September 18 next year \nwill raise the pressure on the Spanish government to follow the UK example and allow a vote to go ahead. What is \nmore, the Scottish process could help provide answers to some of the deep political and economic challenges that \nwould be faced by a Catalan breakaway from Spain. These include division of the national debt burden, how and \nwhen to re-enter the EU and what currency the new state would use.\n\nBoth Scottish and Catalan nationalists have made clear they want to remain part of the EU, and want to continue \nusing the British pound and the euro as before. But both the European Commission and national governments have \nmade clear repeatedly that any breakaway state will have formally to apply for re-entry and will need the backing \nfrom all national capitals, including Madrid.\n\nFor the moment, the Spanish government is reluctant to spell out publicly what it thinks of the Scottish \nindependence push, describing it as an \"internal\" British affair. But, speaking at a press conference on Wednesday \nnight, Mariano Rajoy offered a note of caution to Scots and Catalans alike.\n\nHe stressed again that any breakaway state would automatically end up outside the EU, and added: \"It does not \nhelp Europeans when they embark on go-it-alone adventures, where the point of departure is clear but the point of \narrival is uncertain.\"\n\nJos\u00e9 Ignacio Torreblanca, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said: \"The Spanish \ngovernment sees this with a bit of fear and apprehension.\"\n\n\"In the case of Scotland, you have a process that is managed with a high degree of consensus and calm and with a \ncompletely open end. Secession is a possible outcome and both actors are willing to accept this as an outcome. \nThat is a big contrast with the Spanish situation,\" Mr Torreblanca said.\n\nGovernment officials insist that the Scottish referendum will not serve as a precedent for Catalonia. They argue that \nSpain's constitution, with its emphasis on the \"indissoluble unity of the Spanish Nation\", allows no flexibility on \nterritorial sovereignty. \"You cannot divide sovereignty within Spain,\" the government official said.\n\nCatalan nationalists, meanwhile, are convinced that their own quest would not be derailed should the Scots decide \nto remain part of Britain, as polls suggest they will. \"Some people argue that it could affect us [negatively],\" said Mr \nGen\u00e9. \"But all the polls suggest that there is stronger backing for independence in Catalonia than in Scotland. I \ndon't think the Scottish referendum will be decisive for Catalonia.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

The CFTC has tentatively marked the same day to vote on Volcker, but that \ncould be delayed depending on whether the rule is finalised by then.\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission had been considering December 18 for a vote on Volcker but that could \nbe moved up by a week. The scheduling shows that despite disagreements among regulators over the substance \nof the rule that has resulted in continued work on the measure, they are moving forward.\n\nTreasury secretary Jack Lew has been putting pressure on  the five regulatory agencies involved in writing the \nmeasure to finish it by the end of the year. The officials, including those at the Federal Reserve and the Office of the \nComptroller of the Currency, are in the process of adding their comments and suggested changes to come up with \na finalised version.\n\nThe Volcker rule is one of the most controversial mandates to come out of the Dodd-Frank financial reform \nlegislation. It must ban proprietary trading but still allow for legitimate banking activities, such as market making and \nhedging, which are often hard to distinguish from proprietary trading.\n\nCFTC chairman Gary Gensler has called the rule the most challenging of the Dodd-Frank issues. Republican \nCFTC commissioner Scott O'Malia has accused Mr Gensler of giving the commissioners a Volcker draft that he is \npitching, instead of the version that the four other regulators are using to make comments.\n\nA person familiar with the matter denied that claim, saying the CFTC is using the same basic draft that other \nregulators have, but has included revisions and comments just as the other agencies are doing.\n\nThe person added that the CFTC was moving forward with the rule and was working with other regulatory agencies \nto help ensure it was resolved by the end of the year. The CFTC is seen as one of the most active in Dodd-Frank \nrulemaking, and has completed 67 proposals since the legislation was passed in 2010.\n\nCriticisms about the Volcker rule and the process for drafting it have also arisen at the SEC. Democratic \ncommissioner Kara Stein said last week that the measure in its present form \"is not the rule I would have written\" \nbut hoped that it could be strengthened before it was finalised.\n\nThe two Republican commissioners on the SEC, Dan Gallagher and Michael Piwowar, plan to vote against the \nproposal. The US Chamber of Commerce has called for a re-proposal of the rule before regulators vote on it.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

But Downing St drew comfort from the fact that Ms Merkel's new coalition agreement proposes \nrestrictions on benefit claims by migrant workers, saying that \"migration due to poverty\" was causing social \nproblems in some cities.\n\n\n\nFran\u00e7ois Hollande's socialist government in Paris said on Wednesday it was taking steps to crackdown on what it \ncalled abuse of EU rules governing the temporary employment of workers from other countries.\n\nThe issue has been picked up France's far right National Front, which polls show could come top in next May's \nEuropean elections; the UK Independence party is also expected to do well in Britain, with its focus on migration.\n\nMr Cameron will explain his plan - including proposals for longer-term curbs on migration by future EU members - at \na meeting of the Eastern Partnership, which aims to foster EU relations with neighbours to the east, including \nUkraine.\n\nThe tone of debate has caused concern in the east. Monica Macovei, a senior Romanian politician and MEP, said: \n\"You cannot have the right to establish your companies in Bucharest or Sofia to benefit from low production costs \nwithout accepting workers from Romania and Bulgaria in your country.\"\n\nJose Manuel Barroso, European Commission president, said after talks with Mr Cameron that \"free movement is a \nfundamental treaty principle that must be upheld\". He acknowledged that migration flows were bringing \"challenges\" \nbut said that European rules already made provision to prevent abuse of welfare systems.\n\nMr Cameron wants EU leaders to discuss changes to the treaty to prevent \"vast migrations\" in future when poorer \ncountries join the 28 member bloc, but that idea has yet to gather support in other capitals.\n\nAdditional reporting by James Fontanella-Khan\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average also looked poised to secure a record finish.\n\nIn Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.5 per cent, but the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo slipped 0.4 per cent.\n\nThe dollar, meanwhile, was up 0.8 per cent against the yen at Y102.23 - the highest since late May.\n\nAlthough some observers regarded the day's host of economic releases as \"second tier\", they assumed greater \nimportance given uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve might start scaling back, or \"tapering\", its economic \nstimulus measures.\n\nThe Chicago purchasing managers' index - regarded by many as having a strong correlation with the closely \nwatched national Institute for Supply Management manufacturing survey - eased to 63.0 this month, after a sharp \nrise to 65.9 in October.\n\nHowever, the November reading was higher than most economists had expected - and there was a further healthy \nimprovement in the employment sub-index.\n\nFurther positive news on the labour market front came from news of a drop in initial jobless claims last week which \nfell to the lowest level since late September - although there were some concerns that the data may have been \ndistorted by the timing of public holidays.\n\nMeanwhile, an upward revision to the final reading of the University of Michigan's November consumer confidence \nindex boded well for the forthcoming holiday shopping season.\n\n\n\nOn a gloomier note, durable goods orders dropped 2 per cent on a headline basis in October, and - worryingly - a \nsecond successive drop in core capital goods orders ex-aircraft suggested business investment had started the \nfourth quarter on a soft note.\n\n\"All in all, labour market conditions are steadily improving but companies remain cautious towards investment due \nto ongoing political uncertainty,\" said Nick Stamenkovic, macro strategist at RIA Capital Markets.\n\n\"We expect Fed tapering in March but another solid payrolls in November would increase the odds of a move as \nearly as December.\"\n\nIndeed, there were some fairly upbeat forecasts for the November payrolls report, due out on December 6. Barclays \nis looking for a 200,000 increase in headline payrolls and for the unemployment rate to fall to a post-crisis low of 7.1 \nper cent.\n\nCapital Economics, meanwhile, expects a 180,000 rise and a jobless rate of 7.2 per cent. \"If jobs growth was \nbroadly in line with our forecast, then the case for tapering in December would strengthen,\" said Capital's Paul \nDales. \"But equally, if the recent improvement proves to be nothing more than a mirage, the Fed would be more \nlikely to hold fire for longer.\"\n\nUS government bond prices fell in the wake of the data releases. The 10-year Treasury yield was up 4 basis points \nat 2.74 per cent.\n\nThe German Bund yield rose a more modest 2bp to 1.71 per cent, as the GfK consumer confidence index rose \nmore than expected in December - suggesting households could offer more support to growth in the last quarter of \nthe year.\n\nThe euro, meanwhile, initially rose above $1.36 after Angela Merkel's CDU/CSU alliance finally concluded an \nagreement with the main opposition SPD on a policy programme for a new 'grand coalition' government in \nGermany.\n\nBut the single currency  subsequently gave back its advance to trade flat at $1.3573, although it held at a four-year \nhigh against the yen at Y138.53.\n\nSterling trimmed an early rise against the dollar but was still up 0.4 per cent at $1.6274 after UK third-quarter GDP \ngrowth was confirmed at 0.8 per cent, following 0.7 per cent growth in the second quarter.\n\nThe moderate rally for the dollar - the US currency was up 0.2 per cent against a weighted basket of counterparts - \nknocked the price of gold from an early high of $1,255 an ounce. The metal was down $3 at $1,239, not far off a \nrecent four-month low.\n\nBrent oil settled 43 cents higher at $111.31 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate fell to its lowest since June. \nCopper eased 0.6 per cent in London to $7,020 a tonne.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

But if Britain wants to stay a \npart of the single market, free movement applies. You cannot have your cake and eat it, Mr Cameron.\"\n\nThe announcement by Berlin of benefit curbs on migrant workers and by Paris of restrictions on temporary cross-\nborder workers has encouraged the view in Downing St that Mr Cameron is working with the grain of European \nopinion.\n\nWith the threat of the UK Independence party looming, Mr Cameron will not mind a high-profile spat with \"eurocrats\" \nand it was noticeable that the European Commission did not immediately brand Britain's benefit curbs illegal.\n\nThe prime minister insisted that \"British people expect fairness\" and said that his move to restrict access to benefits \nfor migrants - backed by his pro-European Liberal Democrat coalition partners - was fully justified.\n\nHe said the message was going out to Romanians, Bulgarians and other EU nationals that they should not come to \nBritain thinking that it was easier to claim benefits.\n\nBut Mr Cameron's plan to restrict benefits - including a three-month qualification period and a time limit of six \nmonths - was dubbed a \"panic measure\" by the Labour opposition.\n\nDowning St admitted that the three-month rule for claiming benefits might not be in place before January 1, but \nsaid that other changes - including plans to deport beggars and rough sleepers - would be in force by that date.\n\nSome Conservative MPs believe that Romanians and Bulgarians should be excluded from the British labour market \nfor a further five years and have urged Mr Cameron to defy Brussels and accept an EU fine if necessary.\n\nAn estimated 121,000 EU nationals from outside the UK claim jobseekers allowance - according to official figures \nfrom August - and all must first pass a habitual residence test to prove that they have had a job and a rental lease.\n\nThe Department of Work and Pensions has no data about how long this typically takes, although it is usually a \nmatter of weeks at least.\n\nLabour claimed that the coalition had stolen its idea, first proposed in the spring by Yvette Cooper, shadow home \nsecretary, to make this test tougher.\n\nThe commission has challenged the UK's use of a \"right to reside\" test as an additional condition for entitlement to \nbenefits.\n\nAdditional reporting by Neil Buckley\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Requests for exceptions, which can only be for \"business-critical use\" will have to be signed off \nby both the executive committee member and the compliance officer for the relevant business.\n\nStaff will still be allowed to use single client chat rooms, but only with \"specific written approval\" from a managing \ndirector or above. However, such chats will have to be permanently moderated by a managing director, according \nto the memo. Staff who fail to comply with the new rules face \"disciplinary action, including dismissal\".\n\nUBS's move comes one week after the Financial Times revealed that Barclays, Citi and Royal Bank of Scotland \nhave banned the use of most chat rooms on trading floors.\n\nBarclays and RBS introduced reforms last year, while Citi two months ago banned chat rooms with multiple banks, \nrestricting instant messages to conversations with traders from one institution at a time.\n\nThe clampdown on traders' favourite communication tools is a reaction to the running global Libor and foreign \nexchange rate-rigging investigations. In both cases, banks are being confronted with potentially problematic \nchatroom conversations.\n\nIn the long-running Libor scandal, investigators have seized on trails of incriminating messages that have \nsubsequently proved a public-relations nightmare for those banks that have agreed to pay fines to authorities in the \nUK and US.\n\nUBS's memo alluded to this, warning staff that \"recent events within our industry serve as a serious reminder to be \nmindful at all times to use appropriate language and behavioural standards in all of our communication, no matter \nthe channel\".\n\nChat rooms are also seen as pivotal in the fledgling global probe into potential manipulation of the $5.3tn a day \ncurrencies markets.\n\nSo far at least a dozen traders at banks that include UBS have been suspended amid suspicions that chat rooms \nwere used to share sensitive client information.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Nigeria's oil industry is facing its worst crisis since 2009 when an insurgency in the delta \nbrought many operations to a standstill, with production dropping below 2m barrels a day this summer because of \ntheft, compared with capacity of about 2.4m b/d.\n\nIndustry executives and bankers said the commodity traders are key to the success of a sale between the Shell-led \nconsortium and local Nigerian oil companies, which in the past have struggled to wrap up deals.\n\n\"Shell wants to see the foundations of a bankable deal, and an offtake agreement [with a commodity trader] is \ncritical for that\", a person familiar with the talks said. Often banks refuse to finance oilfields deals unless a reputable \nfirm in the commodity trading industry provides a guarantee to buy the oil.\n\nBut people close to the situation cautioned that the talks between the traders and the Nigerian domestic oil \ncompanies were \"preliminary\" and noted that dozens of different consortiums were bidding for the assets put on \nsale by Shell.\n\nConocoPhillips last year agreed to sell its Nigerian operations to Oando, a local oil company, for $1.8bn, but the \ndeal has yet to close as the company has struggled to raise enough finance in Nigeria and the international market.\n\nChevron is also in the process of selling three onshore oil blocks in Nigeria to domestic companies.\n\nDomestic Nigerian companies including Seplat and Shoreline Natural Resources have spent more than $5bn in \nrecent years buying onshore fields from the majors.\n\nCommodity traders are targeting west Africa as key area of expansion for their oil exploration and production \nbusinesses. Vitol owns several exploration licences in Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon and Congo \nBrazzaville, while Glencore is producing oil in Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon and Chad.\n\nThe Swiss-based commodity houses are moving from their traditional role as middleman - selling and buying raw \nmaterials in a business of large volumes but razor-thin margins - to become vertically integrated groups, with \ninterest spanning production, logistics, trading and processing.\n\nGlencore and Vitol declined to comment, while Mercuria could not be reached. Mercuria earlier this year bought a 6 \nper cent stake in Seplat, an independent Nigeria company which has bought oilfields in the past from Shell-led \nconsortiums.\n\nAdditional reporting by Ajay Makan in London\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

In a fragile post-crisis economy where ecommerce is booming, retailers such as \nWalmart, Best Buy and Macy's have become so desperate to woo consumers that they are discounting their \nChristmas wares earlier and more aggressively than ever.\n\nSelling a few items at a loss does not mean retailers will plunge into the red overall, but Retail Metrics, a research \ngroup, says earnings at the 120 retailers it follows are forecast by analysts to rise by just 2.2 per cent year on year \nin November, December and January.\n\nThe expected earnings growth has dwindled gradually since July - when analysts were forecasting 10 per cent \ngrowth year on year for those three months - as retailers have made their willingness to sacrifice profits for sales \nincreasingly clear.\n\n\"When you see a precipitous decline like that, it usually is the discounting,\" said Ken Perkins, president of Retail \nMetrics. In the same period last year retailers' earnings increased by 11.8 per cent from the previous year.\n\nThe long weekend that begins with Thanksgiving accounts for about 10 per cent of total retail sales in November \nand December, according to analysts at Cowen & Co.\n\nThe phrase \"Red Thursday\" was coined by Gary Balter, retail analyst at Credit Suisse, who said that by opening \nearly on the evening of Thanksgiving retailers were shifting losses that would have come on Friday into Thursday.\n\nToys R Us, the toy store, is opening at 5pm on Thanksgiving, and Best Buy, the electronics chain, is opening at \n6pm. The department stores Macy's, JC Penney and Sears are opening at 8pm, as is Target, the style-oriented \ndiscount chain.\n\nTarget has come up with one of the season's most eye-catching deals by offering the iPad Air for $479 - $20 below \nits normal price - plus a $100 gift card. Such gift cards enable retailers to circumvent manufacturers' restrictions on \ndiscounting.\n\nMost Walmart stores have been open all day on Thanksgiving for years, but the company is unveiling its holiday \ndiscounts this year at 6pm and 8pm on the day rather than waiting until Friday. On a New Jersey store tour for \njournalists last week, the deals it highlighted included a 32-inch Funai television for $98 and the board game \nMonopoly for $5.\n\nRetailers' \"Red Thursday\" discounts will have been planned carefully, but profitability often takes the biggest hit \nlater in the season when retailers are forced into big unplanned discounts to offload products that have flopped.\n\n\"Someone's going to miscalculate and figure out around December 20 that they've got too much,\" Mr Balter said.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

But investors are definitely rotating \nout of gold into cash, shares, bonds and - perhaps - Bitcoins.\n\nGold was down to $1,245 an ounce on Wednesday afternoon - a loss of a quarter in 12 months and more than a \nthird down from its peak two years ago.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoins - an electronic alternative to gold for those wanting a currency immune to government \ndebasing - have gone parabolic. The price of one Bitcoin on the Mt Gox exchange has passed $1,000 for the first \ntime, having risen fivefold in a month. The total value of all Bitcoins is up from $131m to $12bn in a year.\n\nBut the story is not just of goldbugs abandoning the metal for another overpriced asset. Gold is falling for good \nreason.\n\n\n\nFirst, the world looks a safer place. Washington avoided default, the eurozone has hung together (Italy's senate \neven ejected the troublesome Silvio Berlusconi) and Iran is negotiating.\n\nSecond, the cost of holding gold is rising. Holding a chunk of metal is cheap if the money could do little elsewhere. \nBut the opportunity cost is going up as real yields rise - and the price of gold has long been inversely related to the \nreal yield, as measured by inflation-linked bonds.\n\nFinally, the inflation that gold buyers feared would follow from massive money printing by central banks has failed to \nmaterialise - in fact, quite the opposite. In the US and Europe, inflation has fallen to worryingly low levels. Equities \nare partying in the hope of yet more stimulus and investors seem unconcerned that lower inflation implies lower \nprofit growth. Holding gold in fear of hyperinflation is now ranked with having a bunker of tinned food and 20,000 \nrounds of ammunition.\n\nThere is one hope. Gold moves suspiciously closely with the latest inflation number (both gold and US inflation had \na post-crisis peak in September 2011). The 1970s showed inflation can vary radically in just a few years. Goldbugs \nwill have their fingers crossed.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

As long as companies have \nrefused to invest in new machines, buildings and IT systems, economists have remained nervous about the \nsustainability of the UK's sudden growth spurt.\n\nSo news that business investment rose 1.4 per cent between the second and third quarters, part of an overall 0.8 \nper cent rise in economic output, was greeted enthusiastically by some City economists on Wednesday.\n\nSamuel Tombs at Capital Economics, a consultancy, saw the increase as \"reassurance that the recovery is \nbeginning to broaden out\". Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight consultancy, said it was \"the most \nwelcome development\" in data on gross domestic product.\n\nA closer look at the numbers suggests it is too soon to celebrate. Total investment, of which about half is business \ninvestment, contributed just 0.2 percentage points to the economy's 0.8 per cent growth. The rest came from \nhousehold consumption and a build-up of unsold stocks within companies, offset by a drag from falling net exports.\n\nWhy is investment still so weak? Many assume \"investment\" is about the installation of new machines on factory \nproduction lines but, in fact, less than a fifth of total investment is on machinery and equipment. Moreover, this sort \nof investment spending has been remarkably stable in real terms since the data began in 1997 (though it has been \nfalling as a share of gross domestic product).\n\nThe bulk of investment goes on new and refurbished houses, offices, warehouses and other structures. Statisticians \ncount estate agents fees as a type of investment spending, because they are a necessary part of buying a house. It \nis this sort of investment that boomed before the financial crisis and has plunged in its aftermath.\n\nBut there are reasons to believe total investment should start to pick up soon. The recovery in the housing market, \nboosted by the government's \"Help to Buy\" mortgage guarantees, should boost investment in housing and estate \nagents' fees. In fact, this month's Bank of England Inflation Report said the outlook for housing investment was \nstronger than it had anticipated three months earlier.\n\nEconomists do not expect homebuyers to be the only contributors to an investment recovery. \"Demand is returning \nand paralysing uncertainty is dissipating, which should get companies out investing more, if only to initially replace \nclapped-out equipment rather than expanding,\" says Robert Wood, an economist at Berenberg.\n\nIn a recent BoE survey, the net balance of businesses who said that uncertainty was discouraging investment was \nabout 5 per cent, down from about 50 per cent in a similar survey a year earlier. And while small businesses are still \n\n\n\nstruggling to borrow money on reasonable terms, rebounding demand should make it easier for them to spare some \nof their own money for investment.\n\nBusinesses themselves say they are planning to invest more. The latest forecast from the CBI business lobby \ngroup, informed by the reports of its members, is for business investment to fall 4.9 per cent over this year as a \nwhole, and then grow 6.9 per cent in 2014 and 8.3 per cent in 2015.\n\nGiven the volatility of the official data, and the BoE's doubts about its reliability, it is possible that investment is \nalready recovering more swiftly than it appears. But economic history offers a note of caution about just how much \nto expect from Britain's businesses. Weak business investment is nothing new in the UK: it started to decline as a \nshare of GDP at the turn of the century and has been the second-lowest among advanced economies over the last \ndecade. That suggests there are deeper issues, on top of the downturn, shaping the behaviour of corporate Britain.\n\nAdditional reporting by Brian Groom\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

But after the government sweetened the terms of its Refis \nprogramme this month, the miner agreed to settle in an apparent bid to remove uncertainty over the company.\n\n\"The decision to participate in the Refis is consistent with our goal of eliminating uncertainties and directing \nmanagerial focus on Vale's businesses,\" said chief executive Murilo Ferreira.\n\nShares in the company have slumped about 24 per cent this year and are trading at a discount to fellow miners \nsuch as Rio Tinto.\n\nMr Ferreira said the payments would come from operating cash flow, adding that it would not require the company \nto take on more debt. In a conference call later on Wednesday, the company also said that Vale had accumulated \nenough profit from recent years to allow it to continue paying dividends in spite of its back tax obligations.\n\nAfter disputing tax claims with Vale and some of Brazil's other largest companies, the government moved to settle \nthe cases in a revision to the amnesty programme's rules this month. The government is under pressure to find \nready sources of cash to plug a widening budget shortfall as presidential elections loom next year.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Almost three weeks after the Philippines' most deadly storm struck, Mr Dawat \nand his family are in a temporary government evacuation centre in Manila - 340 miles from home. His is one of \n\n\n\nmore than 2,000 families airlifted to the capital to escape the hunger and chaos in areas hit hard by the storm that \nleft at least 5,500 people dead, thousands more injured and hundreds of thousands without food and shelter.\n\n\"I would have wanted to begin farming again but we have no money to buy seeds and fertilisers. We don't even \nhave anything to eat,\" says Mr Dawat sitting inside a big makeshift open tent near the air force base in Manila.\n\nMr Dawat is not alone. The storm washed away his livelihood and that of many other farmers. The UN Food and \nAgriculture Organisation estimates that Typhoon Haiyan affected a third of the Philippines' rice growing areas, \ndestroying almost a million metric tons of wet-season rice harvests - in a country where more than a quarter of the \n95m population live below the poverty line.\n\nThe FAO scaled back its forecast for Philippine rice production from 18.9m metric tons to 18m, prompting the \ngovernment to increase rice imports this year to rebuild stocks.\n\nThird-quarter GDP data released on Thursday shows that the country continued to see healthy growth in the period \nbefore Haiyan hit - it rose 7 per cent in the three months to September from a year earlier. But Mr Dawat's plight, as \na farmer who cannot feed himself, highlights the multiple challenges facing the Philippines as it seeks to sustain the \nrapid economic growth that has wooed foreign investors in the past 18 months.\n\nGovernment economic planners predict that fourth-quarter GDP growth could slow to 4.1-5.9 per cent because of \nthe damage to the agriculture and fishing grounds. Farming and fisheries account for about 11 per cent of GDP but \ncrucially employ a third of the country's workforce.\n\nHowever, the impact on full-year growth is seen to be minimal because of rapid growth in the first three quarters of \nthe year. Annual GDP growth averaged 7.6 per cent in the first half of 2013.\n\n\"There will be some negative impact on growth this year but it will likely be shortlived and won't be enough to bring \ngrowth below 7 per cent,\" says Euben Paracuelles, southeast Asian economist at Nomura Securities in Singapore.\n\nThe simple truth is that the worst-hit region of Eastern Visayas, which reported 95 per cent of the fatalities from the \nstorm, accounts for just 2.2 per cent of Philippines GDP, he adds. The typhoon spared southern Luzon, the \ncountry's main hub for manufacturing, which accounts for 22 per cent of the economy, as well as Metro Manila, \nhome to the country's business and financial districts.\n\nWhile output losses will likely persist early in to next year - the storm caused infrastructure and agricultural \ndamages worth 24.5bn pesos ($563m) - economists believe this will be partly offset by reconstruction efforts.\n\n\"We think the recovery will be relatively quick, starting early in 2014. This tends to be the case, particularly in more \nrecent episodes,\" says Mr Paracuelles. Rebuilding efforts after destructive floods in Metro Manila and Central \nLuzon in late September and early October 2009 helped propel economic growth to 7.6 per cent the following year, \nthe highest in more than three decades.\n\nThe government is preparing a reconstruction programme, initially estimated at $5bn, that aims to rebuild and \nupgrade damaged houses, buildings and infrastructure to withstand the next natural disaster while helping survivors \nrestart their livelihoods.\n\n\"There is plenty of fiscal space available to fund not only relief operations but also infrastructure spending,\" says Mr \nParacuelles. The government debt as a proportion of GDP dropped from 91 per cent in 2004 to just 56 per cent last \nyear. That almost halved interest payments from 31 per cent of the government budget to 17.6 per cent over the \nsame period.\n\nMoney sent home by overseas Filipinos also tends to rise after a disaster, he adds. Though remittances make up \njust a tenth of the economy, these help boost consumer spending that accounts for 70 per cent of GDP. In the past \ntwo years, faster growth was driven mainly by investments - particularly private construction and public \ninfrastructures projects.\n\n\n\nA bigger challenge, however, facing the government is preventing most of the 4.2m people displaced by the \ntyphoon from sinking further into poverty.\n\n\"It is far easier for GDP growth to subsequently recover than for people who have become poor or poorer as a \nresult of the disaster to get out of poverty,\" says Emmanuel Esguerra, the deputy head of the state planning \nagency. \"The latter is of more urgent concern to the government at the present time.\"\n\nThe government is preparing to hand out cash and supplies to help farmers and fishermen displaced by the \ntyphoon to resume their livelihoods.\n\nBut for Mr Dawat, and other heavily indebted landless farmers like him, the need is for more than fresh working \ncapital for the next production cycle. \"I also have to worry about paying land rent and the loan that financed the \npurchase of seeds and fertilisers last cropping season,\" he says. \"The landlord and the lender are insisting on \ngetting fully paid despite the typhoon.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The SET index \nhas risen almost 90 per cent since January 2010, even though protests that year paralysed parts of the capital for \ntwo months and ended in scores of deaths as the military intervened.\n\nMr Charamporn said the stock exchange would notch up about 40 initial public offerings worth $6bn this year - \ncompared with 24 totalling $3.6bn last year - as a two-pronged international growth strategy paid off.\n\nThe exchange was profiting from companies such as BTS - the operator of Bangkok's elevated rail system - setting \nup listed funds to raise money for big infrastructure projects, he said, adding that he expected government agencies \nto do the same.\n\n\n\nThe bourse has also benefited from listings by companies from neighbouring countries such as Vietnam and Laos, \nechoing a government plan to make Thailand a regional trade hub as southeast Asia integrates economically.\n\nWhile analysts say the twin ambitions make sense, they are also both vulnerable to the long-running Thai domestic \npolitical conflict between supporters and opponents of Thaksin Shinawatra, a fugitive former prime minister who is \nalso Ms Yingluck's older brother.\n\nThe on-off battles in parliament and the streets have hobbled government moves for investment in infrastructure \nand logistics, threatening its plans for the country to become the regional economic focal point that its geography \nallows.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

In some areas we're actually \nahead of our expectations,\" said Mr Ai.\n\nReforms have so far focused on easing the path for foreign investors looking to enter China and Chinese \ncompanies going abroad. Foreign companies are now able to obtain business licenses in four days, down from an \naverage of 29 days outside the zone.\n\nChinese companies investing in projects have won approval within five days, down from the multi-month wait that \nhad previously been the norm in China.\n\nMr Ai emphasised the broader significance of the Shanghai free trade zone, saying it was being used by China's \ntop leaders as a vehicle to experiment with aggressive reforms that are designed to be rolled out on a nationwide \nbasis if  successful.\n\nRather than preferential policies such as lower taxes, the main purpose was to experiment with administrative \ninnovations, Mr Ai said. He expected to see results \"within two or three years, or even less than that,\" he added.\n\nA \"negative list\" for foreign companies had been touted as one of the zone's major innovations, specifying the \nsectors in which they cannot invest, with the rest theoretically left open to them. That approach had been expected \nto give them more freedom than China's existing system of permitting investment in a defined range of sectors.\n\nBut with 190 industries still on the negative list, companies have complained that the free trade zone looks much \nlike the rest of the country. Mr Ai said the negative list was merely its first iteration and that next year's version \nwould be shorter.\n\n\n\nCompanies are also still waiting for more details about financial reforms in the free trade zone. The government has \nsaid it will be used to push forward China's capital account opening and currency convertibility, but the central bank \nhas yet to issue detailed rules governing the zone.\n\nMr Ai said a draft was under discussion and would be published soon. Bankers in Shanghai have said they expect \nthe rules will make it easier for companies to take renminbi out of the country, but that there are likely to be \nextensive controls in place to limit the inbound flow of foreign currencies.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

However, the debate on \nnew restrictions is still active within the government.\n\nDr Penmetsa said he did not believe that KKR's acquisition in Gland would face any major regulatory difficulties \nfrom Indian authorities.\n\nGland, which will remain majority Indian owned, did not reveal the size of KKR's stake.\n\nRavi Penmetsa, the company's vice-chairman and managing director, said that Gland Pharma exported roughly 70 \nper cent of its production, but that it would continue to sell in India after its expansion, in spite of receiving higher \nmargins overseas.\n\n\"We are committed to the Indian market - it is our home market,\" he said. \"Why would we stop supplying our family \nand friends?\"\n\n\n\nWith its investment, KKR is buying a stake in the company previously held by Evolvence India Life Sciences, a fund \noperated by an India and Middle East-focused private equity player. But KKR is also injecting fresh capital that will \nhelp finance construction of Gland's new manufacturing facility.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

In 1999, the Financial Times called it \"the only electronic currency that has \nachieved critical mass on the web\".\n\nAs it kept growing through the next decade, users ultimately opened more than 4 million accounts, with more than \n$60m in deposits, backed by almost 4 million metric tonnes of precious metal, and millions of dollars of transactions \non a typical day.\n\nAnd then it all stopped.\n\nThe founder of e-gold, an oncologist and economic history buff in Florida called Douglas Jackson, had hoped his \ngold-backed electronic currency would become a new base money to rival flawed fiat currencies. Instead, it became \na tool for hackers and drug dealers. The FBI and Secret Service raided his offices in December 2005, and he \nwound up spending three years on probation, including six months under house arrest, after pleading guilty to \nrunning an unlicensed money transmitter business and aiding money laundering.\n\nMr Jackson has spent months tracking down former e-gold customers in order to return cash from their accounts, \neven calling up parish priests to chase down relatives of deceased customers. Under the eye of a court-appointed \nadministrator, users are often getting back far more than they put in, since the gold price has soared over the past \ndecade.\n\nAnd as he has wound down e-gold and consulted for a 2.0 version, he has watched with some irritation as a new \ngeneration of entrepreneurs evangelised Bitcoin, and Ripple, and Litecoin and other innovations.\n\nDespite being one of the pioneers of alternative currencies, Mr Jackson has rarely spoken publicly since his \nconviction and never before on Bitcoin. In an email interview with the Financial Times he had a blunt answer to \nwhether he thought any of the virtual currencies since e-gold hold particular promise: \"No.\"\n\nThe story of e-gold provides a cautionary tale and a slew of lessons for virtual currency entrepreneurs, as they \nwrestle with how to operate legally amid a thicket of financial regulations and regulators.\n\nThe fatal flaw that doomed e-gold, Mr Jackson says, is that it would sign up new users without checking their \nidentities.\n\n\"It had things backwards. Permissions would be restricted or revoked reactively in the event unusual activity was \ndetected. It was great at finding bad guys after they did something.\"\n\nThe US Treasury has been warning Bitcoin businesses since March that they must comply with \"know your \ncustomer\" (KYC) laws that require stringent identity checks, monitoring of accounts and reporting of suspicious \nactivity. They must also register as money transmitters with most of the 50 US states.\n\nThe difficulty and expense of meeting those obligations has led to several Bitcoin US exchanges and brokers \nshutting down, including Tradehill and Bitinstant. Regulators in New York and California are among those to have \nsubpoenaed early Bitcoin companies for investigations into the currency.\n\n\"It appears many digital-currency firms may have underestimated their regulatory obligations, the anti-money \nlaundering risks presented by their business models, and the degree of law-enforcement concern surrounding those \nrisks,\" Adam Shapiro, consultant at Promontory, wrote in a recent client note.\n\n\n\nThe rules have also made banks and other companies wary about dealing with Bitcoin companies. Jaron \nLukasiewicz, whose Bitcoin derivatives trading platform Coinsetter is due to launch around New Year, took many \nmonths to find a bank willing to take his firm as a customer, but he is optimistic that entrepreneurs have absorbed \nthe lessons of e-gold and the pronouncements of regulators.\n\n\"The entrepreneurs have moved. Bitcoin companies are taking steps towards compliance and introducing KYC,\" Mr \nLukasiewicz said.\n\nBitcoin, whose price topped $1,000 for the first time this week, differs from e-gold in that it does not rely on a single \ncompany to manage the system. Transactions are recorded instead on a peer-to-peer network of computers.\n\nMr Jackson believes that currencies and payments systems with central management authorities are more likely to \nsucceed, since regulators and customers demand protections against hacking, fraud and errors.\n\nAnd this, he argues, is the biggest lesson from e-gold: the superior value of an asset-backed currency. His \ncompany has begun paying out what will be more than $20m of claims, after liquidating vaults full of gold that \nbacked the currency, something that will not be happening for users of today's virtual currencies, should anything \ngo wrong.\n\n\"Suppose that someone has 1 Bitcoin in their wallet, which they regard as having the equivalent value of $500 or \n$900 or, give it another day or two, $20,000, and then suppose that some circumstance emerged that effectively \nprevented it from ever circulating again,\" Mr Jackson says.\n\n\"Who, after six years of non-circulation, would pay that $500 or $20,000 or even so much as a nickel?\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Net debt \nstood at \u00a3421m at the end of September, compared with \u00a3788m at the same point in 2012.\n\nThomas Cook said on Thursday it had identified a further \u00a340m of cost cuts, taking the target for the first part of its \nsavings plan to \u00a3440m by the end of 2015. The company also announced a second wave of cost savings, which \nwould end in 2018.\n\nHarriet Green, chief executive, said she could give no details about potential job losses.\n\nRevenues at the tour operator came in about 1 per cent higher at \u00a39.3bn, while earnings before interest and tax \nwere \u00a313m, compared with a loss of \u00a3170m last year.\n\nUnderlying operating profit, which adjusts for exceptional items such as disposals and shop closures, was up 48.6 \nper cent on last year at \u00a3263m - ahead of a company supplied consensus forecast of \u00a3251m.\n\nThere was also good news on cash flow, which in the year to September was \u00a353m, compared with outflow of \n\u00a3103m last year.\n\nOn a reported basis, the pre-tax loss was \u00a3207m, compared with a loss of \u00a3590m last year.\n\nThe company, which operates in 42 countries, said that the political and social upheaval in Egypt had reduced full-\nyear revenues by about \u00a340m, though the country was starting to recover as a tourist destination.\n\n\n\nTurmoil in Egypt and other popular destinations, such as Greece, had caused a collapse in Thomas Cook's sales \nover the past two years, compounding the effects of the eurozone debt crisis and high fuel costs.\n\nThe shares rose 10 per cent in early London trading to 169p, bringing the gains for the year to date to 220 per cent \nthis year.\n\nMs Green said: \"It's been quite a momentous year for the group, moving from the early stages of turnround to full \ntransformation.\"\n\nReiterating their \"buy\" recommendation, analysts at Jefferies said Thomas Cook's results would positively surprise \nthe market. \"Margins are improving, net debt has fallen and the balance sheet considerably strengthened, more \ncost savings are promised and, importantly, trading is robust,\" they said.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Apart from \nconsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of GDP, growth was driven mainly by investments in \ndurable equipment.\n\nMr Balisacan said economic policy makers are reviewing next year's economic growth target of 6.5-7.5 per cent to \ntake into account the impact of the most destructive typhoon to hit the country, adding that the government is keen \nto minimise the economic fallout from the disaster by embarking on a large-scale reconstruction programme in the \ntyphoon-hit areas.\n\n\"How long will the impact linger in the coming months and years will depend on how quickly we can restore \neconomic activity and livelihood in those areas,\" he said.\n\nSome analysts expect next year's GDP growth to be higher because of the government's planned rebuilding \nprogramme. Nomura Securities in Singapore raised its 2014 GDP forecast from 6.2 per cent to 6.7 per cent on \nexpectations that \"reconstruction will spur economic activity in the months ahead\".\n\nWhile the latest GDP numbers were in line with expectations, analysts were surprised by a slump in private \nconstruction activity, an important source of overall output growth in previous quarters, where year-on-year growth \nfell from 17.3 per cent in the second quarter to only 4.7 per cent in the third quarter.\n\n\"I'm not sure what's driven it. Based on high frequency numbers such as cement sales, it's still fairly strong. Maybe \nit's just a temporary slowdown,\" said Euben Paracuelles, southeast Asia economist at Nomura. \"But as we go into \nnext year, with more construction after the typhoon, the growth momentum could bounce back.\"\n\nAnnual growth in regular government spending slowed as well from 18 per cent in the second quarter to only 4.6 \nper cent in the third quarter even as public infrastructure outlays surged during the period.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Now its critics are trying to increase the pressure by \nturning the spotlight on to deals undertaken in the aftermath of the financial crisis.\n\n\n\nThe issue revolves around an attempt to capture an expected uplift in the price of the company's debt, following its \nsharp fall in the wake of the banking crisis.\n\nStarting at the end of 2009, two Irish companies - set up by a Luxembourg finance company owned by Alliance \nBoots' executive chairman Stefano Pessina - acquired \u00a3226m of the group's senior and subordinated facilities \nloans.\n\nThe purchase was largely funded as a result of Alliance Boots acquiring profit participating notes issued by the Irish \ncompanies. These notes were eventually redeemed during the year ended March 2013 and Alliance Boots bought \nback its loans from the Irish companies for \u00a3247m in March 2013.\n\nWar on Want, a campaign group, has raised questions over two issues. Firstly, it asked whether the bulk of the \nprofit from buying back the Alliance Boots debt went to Pessina-controlled entities, rather than the company itself.\n\nSecondly, it asked whether the involvement of Dascoli, Mr Pessina's Luxembourg-based finance company, meant \nthat the UK received less tax revenue on the profits from the deal that it would have done if the transaction had \nbeen structured in a different way.\n\nAccording to War on Want: \"Alliance Boots shifted profits abroad, by using complex financial instruments, shell \nfinancial companies in Luxembourg, and payments from one party to finance the purchase of company debt in a \ncircular manner that may have benefited those connected with the Luxembourg-based finance companies.\"\n\nThe company vigorously rejects the allegations and said it complied with all laws. It said: \"Alliance Boots \ncategorically refutes these allegations, which are inaccurate and we believe defamatory, and it is taking legal advice \non this matter. The group practices strong corporate governance with full transparency in its financial disclosures \nwhich are contained in its annual report.\"\n\nIt is understood that the deal was put together by Alliance Boots because - unlike its regular debt - the terms of its \nbanking facility meant it was not permitted to buy back mezzanine debt.\n\nThe deal was put together with a related party - Dascoli, a Luxembourg-based finance company set up by Mr \nPessina - but in such a way that Alliance Boots was able to benefit from the transaction through the profit \nparticipating loans. KKR, the private equity group, was the other shareholder at the time the transactions were put \ntogether.\n\nAlliance Boots is also understood to reject claims that the deal was designed to minimise its tax obligations. It \nmade a full disclosure of the transactions to HMRC.\n\nWar on Want admits the publicly available information on the transactions is inadequate to draw firm conclusions.\n\nIt said: \"These bare-bones disclosures do not provide the public and stakeholders with enough information to gauge \nthe extent to which a management insider may have profited from self-dealing and tax avoidance through related-\nparty transactions. Nor is it possible from these disclosures to assess whether the company has sufficient corporate \ngovernance measures in place.\"\n\nBut it wants to use a complaint lodged with the Paris-based OECD concerning the company's adherence to its \nguidelines for multinational enterprises to put pressure on it to become more transparent.\n\nAlliance Boots vigorously rejects the criticism, insisting it goes far beyond the required standards. It says its annual \nreport demonstrates \"our desire and commitment to be at the forefront of best practice corporate governance \nreporting\" and goes beyond the minimum standards set out for private equity firms.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

In the first of these \nmoves, Dascoli bought more than \u00a3220m of Alliance Boots' debt when it was trading at deep discounts to its par \nvalue.\n\nThe organisations said that when Alliance Boots repurchased the debt in 2013, most of the benefit of its rise in \nvalue could have gone to entities controlled by Mr Pessina. The transactions \"were structured in such a way that \nthey may have significantly enriched those connected with the entities at the expense of the company and \ntaxpayers\", the organisations said.\n\nAlliance Boots rejected the claims, calling them \"inaccurate and, we believe, defamatory\".\n\nIt said it complied strictly with the law, had strong corporate governance standards and fully transparent financial \ndisclosures in its annual reports. \"We ... always strive to maintain the highest ethical standards.\"\n\nThe group has previously been explicit about buying back debt from distressed sellers when it could do so at a \nsteep discount, in order to reduce its high borrowings.\n\nThis is the second time within two months that Alliance Boots - which opened its first store selling herbal remedies \nin Nottingham in 1849 and is now 45 per cent owned by US pharmacy group Walgreen - has come under fire from \ncampaigners.\n\nUnite, Britain's biggest trade union, said in October that the chain had \"avoided paying more than \u00a31bn in taxes\" \nsince it was taken private by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Mr Pessina in a \u00a312bn deal in 2007. Alliance Boots said \nit observed the highest standards of ethics and had invested more than \u00a32.1bn to build its business and contributed \n\u00a31bn to its pension fund.\n\nPrivate equity groups typically use debt to finance their acquisitions to lower their cost of capital and get the tax \nbenefit associated with debt to maximise their returns.\n\nThe OECD guidelines were strengthened in 2011 and. even though they are voluntary. some non-governmental \norganisations see them as an effective way to hold companies to account.\n\nIn this instance, the organisations said Alliance Boots breached the guidance by providing too little information for \noutside stakeholders to judge whether the transactions were fair and transparent.

Mr Osborne asked the \nFinancial Policy Committee originally to advise the Treasury on whether the scheme should be extended once its \nthree-year life was up.\n\nSoon afterwards, in October, the chancellor said the FPC should examine the scheme every year. It would have to \nassess the impact of Help to Buy on financial stability and whether the price cap of \u00a3600,000 and the fee charged to \nlenders were still appropriate.\n\nThe BoE's involvement is limited to financial stability - and not \"home ownership\" - and it does not have any veto on \nthe scheme, Mr Carney confirmed in his letter.\n\nMr Tyrie said yesterday that the letter from the governor was a \"step forward\", bringing much-needed clarity to Help \nto Buy.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

While the UK remains the second most popular destination for international students after the \nUS, its market share has declined even as other competitors have increased or retained their share.\n\nThe report - which comes out ahead of official net migration statistics - estimates that foreign students contribute \naround \u00a313bn to Britain's economy and generate around 70,000 jobs. But its authors suggest there is a \nfundamental conflict at the heart of government with the Home Office trying to drive down student numbers while \nthe Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is seeking to boost the number of international students in \nhigher education by 15 to 20 per cent over the next five years.\n\nWithin the 29 per cent decline in student visas issued during the course of this government, the greatest falls have \nbeen in the numbers of students from Pakistan, which have dropped by 62 per cent, India, which has dropped by 38 \nper cent and Bangladesh which has dropped by 30 per cent.\n\nAlice Sachrajda, IPPR research fellow, said that although the UK should be hanging out a banner saying \"foreign \nstudents welcome here\", instead it was doing the opposite.\n\n\"We are pursuing policies which could cause lasting damage to a sector of our economy worth \u00a313bn and in which \nthe UK is a world leader,\" Ms Sachrajda said.\n\n\"The reduction in foreign student numbers is being driven by the net migration target, which is designed to meet \nthe public's concern about high immigration,\" she added. \"But foreign students are not the focus of that concern \nbecause, as the report shows, they come for a relatively short time, go home after their studies and contribute much \nmore than they take out while they are here.\"\n\nDavid Cameron has said repeatedly during visits to India that, while bogus students are being flushed out of the \nsystem, there is no limit on the number of genuine foreign students admitted to Britain.\n\nResponding to the IPPR report, the Home Office said that international students made an \"important contribution\" to \nthe UK economy and that Britain's education system was \"one of the best in the world\".\n\n\"To maintain this reputation it is vital we tackle the widespread abuse of the student visa system we saw in the \npast, while making sure Britain remains open for business,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\n\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

This pushed remuneration out of the top slot for the first \ntime in six years.\n\nThe findings follow controversy over low tax bills paid by companies such as Amazon, Google and Starbucks. \nExecutive pay has been less prominent in the media since 2012's \"shareholder spring\".\n\nThe ability of employees to speak out about company wrongdoing was rated the third most significant concern at 22 \nper cent, with business attitudes to the environment and human rights coming in lower at 16 per cent and 15 per \ncent respectively.\n\nPhilippa Foster Back, the IBE's director, said: \"These results could indicate that business has clawed back some of \nthe public trust lost in the wake of the financial crisis. But confidence remains fragile with a year-on-year increase in \nthose saying that business is less ethical than it was 10 years ago.\"\n\nShe added: \"Tax is also now clearly a reputational issue and has risen very rapidly up the scale. Trust cannot be \ntaken for granted.\"\n\nThe IBE was established in 1986 to encourage high standards of business behaviour based on ethical values.\n\nSix years on from the financial crisis, trust remains a leading issue for businesses. Sir Mike Rake, president of the \nCBI employers' group, told the Financial Times in September that companies with enough cash on their balance \nsheets should start investing to help restore business's bruised reputation.\n\nA group of well-known companies this week called for a greater diversity of business ownership structures to win \nback public trust, motivate employees and achieve sustainable growth.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The paper published what \npurports to be video evidence of an international fixer claiming to be able to fix lower league matches for \u00a350,000.\n\nThe NCA statement said: \"Six men have been arrested across the country as part of an NCA investigation into \nalleged football match fixing. The focus of the operation is a suspected international illegal betting syndicate. The \nNCA is working closely with the Gambling Commission and the Football Association. This is an active investigation \nand we are unable to provide further detail at this time.\"\n\nFootball match-fixing is becoming one of the game's most pressing problems, with Asian betting syndicates and \nfixing regarded as the source.

The expansion is a significant part of its growth ambitions and \nhad been expected to cost around $5bn. Iron ore provides the vast majority of Rio's earnings.\n\nThe Anglo-Australian miner said on Thursday that under the scaled back project, mine production capacity would \nincrease by more than 60m tonnes by 2017 and reach more than 330m tonnes in the next two years.\n\nSam Walsh, Rio's chief executive, called the plans a \"breakthrough pathway\" for Pilbara expansion, combining \nbrownfield expansions with low-cost productivity gains. \"We will deliver the expansion at an estimated capital cost \nof more than $3bn below previous expectations,\" he said.\n\nRio and other miners have been at pains this year to stress their cautious approach to investment after huge capital \nspending in the latter stages of the resources boom.\n\nRio had been widely expected to make the commitment to expand its Pilbara operations, where it ramped up from \n240m tonnes of capacity to 290m tonnes and where it enjoys one of the industry's lowest costs of production and \nshipping ore.\n\nDemand for iron ore, as for most commodities, has been driven by China's growth and has been surprisingly strong \nthis year, shoring up the iron ore price and easing the dilemma over spending for Rio.\n\nMr Walsh, who headed up Rio's iron ore operations before he took over as chief executive, said the Pilbara \nexpansion was the \"most attractive investment opportunity in the sector\".\n\nAnalysts at Citi said Rio's guidelines for the so-called \"capital intensity\" of the expansion project, at between $120 \nand $130 per tonne of capacity, was lower than their $145 forecast and would also ramp up faster than they had \nexpected.\n\nLiberum analysts suggested the capital spending from Rio would now likely be about $2bn. \"The faster than \nanticipated ramp up makes us more cautious around iron ore [prices] in 2015,\" they said.\n\n\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

She insisted it was \"one of the most important public health issues we face in the \ncountry\".\n\n\"What the government said in July was that it would look at the emerging evidence from Australia and elsewhere,\" \nshe told the BBC on Thursday. \"We've listened hard to what both houses of parliament have said over recent \nweeks where it's been very clear that members in both houses feel that there's not just emerging evidence in \nAustralia but other studies and I think the time is right to look at this.\"\n\nThe measure was thought to have been killed in the summer when Mr Cameron said there was not enough \nevidence that removing branding from cigarette packages would stop young people from smoking.\n\nThat decision angered Labour and various health groups, who accused the prime minister of having been \ninfluenced by Lynton Crosby, the Conservative strategist whose company has also been employed to represent \ncigarette companies.\n\nMr Crosby had told senior Conservatives to abandon legislation not seen as central to the government's economic \nmessage, which he referred to as the \"barnacles on the boat\", according to party officials. Soon afterwards, a range \nof proposed legislation was dropped, including proposals for plain cigarette packaging.\n\nBut the party was engulfed in a row over a possible conflict of interest, given that Mr Crosby's lobbying company \nhas represented Philip Morris, the US tobacco company. Ed Miliband called Mr Cameron the \"prime minister for \nBenson and Hedge Funds\".\n\nThe move also angered some Conservative backbenchers. Sarah Wollaston - a GP - described the decision to drop \nplans for plain packaging as a \"day of shame for this government\".\n\nMs Ellison told the BBC: \"People do feel strongly and quite rightly. This is fundamentally about children's health - \nwe know that two-thirds of people start smoking when they're children. I don't blame parliament about feeling \nstrongly about this issue, it's one of the most important public health issues we face in this country.\"\n\nThursday's announcement is designed in part to ward off criticism that the Tory party is in hock to big business, \nwhich one coalition adviser called \"ridiculous smears\", according to The Times newspaper.\n\nThe measure has been revisited after an amendment to the children and families bill, currently in the House of \nLords, by a cross-party group of peers.\n\nMinisters will reject that amendment but Earl Howe, the health minister, will bring forward his own, announcing a \nreview into plain packaging in a bid to head off a possible government defeat.\n\nMr Burnham told the BBC that he thought the government had changed its stance simply to avoid a defeat.\n\n\"What else explains the timing?\" he said. \"You know, we had a clear steer in the summer that this was now off the \nagenda and let's remember [former health secretary] Andrew Lansley had said at the beginning to his government \nthat he was very committed to it and I supported him in saying that and today we're no further forward than we were \nwhen he said that, we've got another review.\"\n\n\n\nThe UK is just one of a number of countries pushing through similar measures. Australia has already banned \nbranded cigarette packs, while Ireland and New Zealand are making similar moves. Ministers will study the impact \nof what has happened in Australia and report back in March next year. Coalition advisers said plain packaging \ncould be brought in before the 2015 general election.\n\nBut Labour will push for ministers to move faster still. Luciana Berger, Labour's shadow public health minister, said: \n\"The evidence to support standardised packaging is clear. The consensus is overwhelming. We don't need any \nfurther delay while 570 children are lighting up for the first time every day.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by John Aglionby\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

We report on the most notable findings.\n\nBoards are failing at strategy and becoming increasingly focused on costs, according to a think-tank debate \nattended by chairmen. One said: \"We need the conversation in the boardroom to be two levels 'higher'. Many of our \nlargest companies are sitting on cash and they need to get back to strategy and invest in the future - or there won't \nbe one.\"\n\nIt was suggested that advisory boards, unfettered by concerns of liability and governance, might be better at \ntackling strategy - and might attract creative people who would otherwise be put off joining boards by the burden of \ngovernance.\n\nThe chairmen also asked whether more of a board's work could be handled by committees, as they can be more \nfocused and effective.\n\nThey also questioned whether age and experience should continue to take precedence over training and education \nwhen appointing board members. One view was that boardroom skills are becoming more specialised and need to \nbe learned.\n\nRegulators came under fire from the chairmen. They were accused of not understanding the businesses they are \nregulating and of treating non-executives as executives.\n\nThe meeting also referred to the spread of regulation from the financial services sector. One said: \"We have a two-\ntier corporate world: financial services and the rest. But what starts as regulation of financial services bleeds \nthrough to the rest.\"\n\nThe participants warned that because boards are out of touch with society, there is a danger of a backlash and the \nemergence of an \"anti-business\" movement.\n\nThe relationship between society and business was also raised at a subsequent debate. One view was that the \nfuture of the corporation depends on it being redesigned and finance returned to its proper, subservient role of \nsupporting the wider economy.\n\nAll businesses should demonstrate public benefit - just as charities have to show a public benefit in return for \ncharitable status, businesses should do the same, perhaps in return for limited liability status.\n\nAnother view was that voluntary sector leaders should be encouraged to join corporate boards, because of their \nspecific skills, including in reputation and risk management.\n\nParticipants went on to call for younger, more vibrant boards. \"You should see the faces of the future - not just the \npast,\" said one. The concern that young executives are too busy to join boards was rejected and some chairmen \n\n\n\nwere blamed for claiming to support diversity of age but then not allowing their executives to join someone else's \nboard.\n\nIt was also argued that businesses and boards need permission to fail. \"What business or person can achieve great \nthings without the possibility of failure?\" one asked.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The programme included a \nscene in which she breaks down in tears.\n\nIt might make interesting TV - but why would a business executive put themselves through it? Is it a good career \nmove?\n\n\"I went in to try to achieve two things,\" says Mr Zeidler, who has since left Securitas by mutual consent - nothing to \ndo with his appearance on the programme, he says.\n\n\"After the last Olympics, most people's view of security was poor and I wanted to show that security was actually a \ngood thing, that people do a decent job and should be respected for doing it. The second was to promote the brand \nprofile of Securitas.\"\n\nThe risk of embarrassing either himself or the company was worth taking, he says: \"The format has to find problems \nbut it can't be totally unfair or negative to the company or boss, otherwise no one would want to do it - that was the \npitch.\"\n\nMs Kelly had a similar sector image to restore. \"We wanted to get across the values of the public sector and the \nimpact of the budget cuts,\" she says.\n\nShe felt she could put a human face both on the profession and her own position. \"People can think of senior \nmanagement as being very remote, that executives can't possibly understand what their lives are like or what it's \nlike to do their job,\" she says. Getting involved in such a programme \"makes somebody like me much more human \nto others and much more approachable\".\n\nNeither Mr Zeidler nor Ms Kelly had any editorial control - other than strictly factual - over what was included in the \nprogramme, nor how it was edited. \"The interesting thing about not having any control,\" says Ms Kelly, \"is that \nsequences you film that really moved you or touched you don't always make it into the final edit - but that doesn't \nmean they aren't part of what you learn and gain from the experience.\"\n\nHer PR team managed to \"sneak in a little of 'you can say X, but please don't say Y'\", but there was still \"some of \nthe 'shock-horror' stuff left in\", she says. \"But that's part of the programme.\"\n\n\n\nBecause Securitas personnel work exclusively on client sites, customers were very sensitive. \"And quite rightly,\" \nsays Mr Zeidler. \"The one editing right we had was that if there was anything on the film that could compromise the \nsecurity of a customer, we had to be able to say 'that can't go in'.\"\n\nThe rest, however, is up to the television production company. Given such dangers, is it more suited to executives \nwith egos and a keen sense for self-promotion?\n\nBoth Undercover Boss participants disagree. \"I actually think it's pretty risky,\" says Mr Zeidler. \"The programme isn't \ndesigned to make you look stupid, but you could very easily look out of touch if you were trying to do it for personal \nbenefit and your own brand.\"\n\nThe target audience of reality TV is also less the serious business viewer and more the general public. Mr Zeidler \njokes that his wife, a teacher, received more kudos at school for her 10 seconds of screen time than he did.\n\n\"No woman of a certain age wants to appear on national television looking the way that I looked,\" adds Ms Kelly. \nHer disguise involved stripping back her normally glamorous appearance to become \"Evelyn\", a return-to-work \nmum with greasy hair and no make-up.\n\n\"You don't do that by choice to sell yourself,\" she says, agreeing that ego is necessary for senior managers but \nargues that this is not the medium to massage it. \"It is tough. Don't be fooled that it is all roses and 'lights, cameras, \naction'. There is an element of psychological bullying associated with the programme.\"\n\nFor her, this included a focus on her private life - her past, having been briefly raised in council accommodation for \nhomeless people as a child, and her present, as mother to a daughter with learning disabilities.\n\n\"There was a bit in the programme when I leave home and my daughter says, 'are you coming back?'. When the \ndirector stuck the camera in my face and asked, 'how do you feel?' that's when I broke down.\"\n\nDespite these tribulations, Southwark Council has since run screening sessions for staff, and Securitas has used its \nepisode in induction training. Employees who appear in the programme become local stars, appearing on the front \npages of regional and trade publications.\n\nMs Kelly, a Scot, was featured in a two-page profile in The Sunday Post, a Scottish newspaper. \"We have pushed it \nout there as a real positive,\" she says. \"It got such a good response from people for trying to showcase the really \ntough budget cuts that local authorities face - and internally the staff approach me more, email me, raise things, \nknowing they will get a response, whereas previously they would have thought 'remote, ivory tower, no idea'.\"\n\nMr Zeidler adds: \"In the security profession, the biggest issue that most officers have, after pay, is being recognised \nand respected for what they do. I have had huge positive appreciation from people saying, 'you've done something \nthat actually raised the profile of the profession', that it shows senior management actually doing something to \nrecognise what we do.\"\n\nThere were messages he hoped to convey that languished on the editing room floor and issues he had hoped to \navoid that took centre stage. But he looks back on the experience with no regrets.\n\n\"As a business leader, one of the greatest challenges is how to communicate more broadly what you're doing and \nwhy it's interesting to particular target audiences\", he says.\n\n\"So much of business's engagement with the media is defensive, whereas this was an opportunity to be active.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

He puts himself in the position of someone starting their career again:If I imagine myself \nstarting over, I see myself excitedly making plans about my future career in the media, about my rise to the top, \n\n\n\nmeeting the stars, being invited to parties, working with the very best... and then the reality sinks in that I have a \nlong road ahead, so I had better get started.\n\nThe first thing I would do is recall the time I wasted first time around. Looking back I can see so many dead ends \nthat, at the time, all seemed like promising possibilities, mainly because other people promised they would be.\n\nSo what would I do differently? Should I not trust in other people this time? Should I have contingency plans and not \nsit around waiting? No - I would still trust my intuition.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I can see that some of those dead ends were doomed from the start, and my mistake \nwas ignoring my gut feeling and hoping for the best. Trust was not the problem - what I got wrong was using false \nhope as a way to hide my own fear of failure.\n\nThe lesson I would therefore take back with me is to realise that if a promise sounds empty then it probably is. \nWhen people say: \"I'll try...\" or \"I'll see what I can do...\", I would not hear: \"You're great! I can't wait to tell my boss \nabout you!\"\n\nInstead, I would hear: \"I don't want to say no to your face, but that's what I'm trying to tell you.\"\n\nWhat difference would that have made? It would have saved me countless hours waiting for the phone to ring and \ngiven me the time to focus on finding the people who do say yes.\n\nWhat else do I know now that would have helped me then?\n\nI think that what most people are talking about when they say \"I wish I knew then what I know now\" are lessons \nlearned from their own mistakes. The problem is that without those mistakes there is no learning. Older, wiser \nfriends and colleagues would tell me where I was going wrong, but did I listen? Of course not - I had to learn it \nmyself.\n\nBut the more I think about the benefits of my experience, the more I realise that it has a big downside, too. The \nbiggest problem with experience is experiencing failure and resolving never to go down that road again.\n\nBut if you search the internet for quotes on failure, you'll find the wise words of people such as Edison and \nChurchill, who all said pretty much the same thing: that failure isn't the problem - giving up is the problem.\n\nThe problem I have now is that I am too well aware of all the things that don't and won't work. So in going back to \nbegin my career over again, I would try hard to forget everything I know now and concentrate only on what I \nalready knew back then - that anything is possible.Paul Boross's latest book, Pitch Up!

At one time, the periods from September to December and January to \nApril would see increased recruitment activity from employers.\n\nBut recently, employers have been hiring and firing as the need arises. For example, this year JP Morgan has taken \non 13,000 staff globally for compliance-related roles to prevent a repeat of the heavy regulatory fines it has \nreceived.\n\nEmployers are also taking longer to recruit as they believe they can find a better fit of candidates if they are patient.\n\nhttp://www.thepitchdoctor.tv/\n\n\nOften, the recruitment process can spread over several months. For more senior staff on three or more months' \nnotice periods it can take six months or more between advertising a role or placing it with a recruitment consultant \nor headhunter and the time someone starts work.\n\nWe encourage our jobseeking clients to study the job market at all times of the year, and to approach employers \nspeculatively at any time, except around Christmas.\n\nWe are seeing more opportunistic hiring by businesses who will interview candidates they feel can add immediate \nvalue, and we are seeing examples of employers finding and approaching potential candidates through websites \nsuch as LinkedIn.\n\nMany graduates mistakenly believe there are fixed recruitment times for graduate schemes. But even here you can \ntake the initiative and ask about opportunities by contacting the graduate recruitment team.\n\nMany smaller businesses do not have formal recruitment processes, and your CV landing on the right desk at the \nright time could lead to an interview and job offer. Julia Menaul, executive coach at Spark Coaching and Training, \nsays:\n\nIt does seem like a bad time to be looking for a job - but even a basic search of the internet shows thousands of \nvacancies. Psychologically, you need to move on from the idea that there is a good time to hunt for jobs.\n\nEven during holiday periods businesses have to function and they still need to hire people - so recruitment never \nstops. It might even mean you face less competition and have time to network.\n\nThe first or last interview dilemma relates to the \"primacy/recency\" effect. This is a psychological theory that states \nthat behaviour is influenced by something we have seen and experienced either first (primacy) or last (recency).\n\nIf your interviewer is doing a lot of interviewing then they often leave their decisions to the end of all the interviews \nas there is too much information to assimilate. Therefore, the most recent information seems to be the best, and a \nbias effect occurs toward the most recent candidates interviewed.\n\nIf we only have a few interviews we simply judge quickly, and primacy dominates - so we rely on first impressions \nand tend to choose the applicants we interviewed earlier in the process.\n\nIf you have no influence over a first or last interview, try to concentrate on a strong start and a strong finish in your \ninterview.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

It found 25 banks paying \nmore than the proposed cap.\n\nIf the cap had been in force then these bankers would have received a combined reduction in remuneration of \n\u00a328.9m, or \u00a3253,772 each. Why so coy on pay?Employers advertising a vacancy are quick to highlight the exciting \nopportunities it offers - but can be strangely coy when it comes to pay.\n\nData from Innovantage, a business intelligence company, shows that when employers place job adverts online \nthemselves, fewer than half give salary or wage details.\n\n\n\nThe figures, from the first half of this year, suggest a big rise in the number of adverts placed directly by employers, \nwith 56 per cent of them failing to reveal the pay - four percentage points up on last year.\n\nRecruitment agencies are not quite so shy, with 32 per cent of their job adverts omitting salary details. Innovantage \nsays agencies believe that more information can widen the pool of potential candidates.\n\nSmart Recruit Online, a recruitment platform, has tested the impact by running an advert for the same job with and \nwithout pay details. Mark Stephens, its chief executive, says: \"Those with salary details always resulted in at least \n30 per cent more applicants. Our samples suggest it is likely to be higher quality candidates who choose not to \napply without this visibility - such as those already in work and reluctant to apply when they have no clear indication \nthat the role will meet their salary requirements.\"\n\nMatthew Dewstowe, Innovantage founder, says: \"It astounds me that for all the sophistication that goes into \npushing new opportunities, the one basic piece of information most normal people want to know is so often \nmissing.\"\n\nMeasures of successCompanies that monitor and measure talent acquisition and management outperform their \ncompetitors, says a report from Alexander Mann Solutions, a provider of talent acquisition and management \nservices, and the HRO Today Institute, a global community of senior HR executives.\n\nIt finds 90 per cent of companies collect data about their employees but only half use one or more metrics to \nimprove talent management and almost a third do not use the data at all.\n\nMeasuring some metrics and not others can be meaningless, it concludes. For example, monitoring the time taken \nto fill roles is worthless without data on how long the recruits stay and how quickly they reach full \nperformance.Roles for high-fliersCTC Aviation, the global pilot training company, is looking for recruits. It believes \nthe world needs to find 235,000 new pilots by 2020 to meet demand for air travel and to replace those who retire.\n\nIt is keen on UK candidates, saying  they have been among the best the company has ever trained.\n\nThere are currently about 150,000 pilots in the world, it says.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

This is not the case for Trades Union Congress \nchief, Frances O'Grady, who has never lost sight of her direction.\n\nAn active trade unionist and campaigner all her working life, Ms O'Grady says the appeal of her work lies in its \nfocus on a fair deal for people on pay and decent working conditions, making the UK a better place in which to live \nand work.\n\n\"The great thing is being with people who share your values. It isn't just a theoretical exercise but knowing as a \ntrade unionist that you can make a difference,\" says Ms O'Grady, who stepped up from deputy director to be TUC \ngeneral secretary in January, taking charge of a movement with 54 affiliated unions, and becoming the first woman \nto do so.\n\nA family background in trade unions did much to stimulate her interest. Her  grandfather and great grandfather in \nDublin were among the founders of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union and her father was a shop \nsteward at the Leyland car plant in Cowley, near Oxford, at a time of deep clashes between workers and \nmanagement.\n\nHer background gave her \"a strong sense of justice and understanding that people have to stick together if they are \ngoing to win fairness\", she says.\n\n\n\nBrought up in a working class family of five children in Oxford, Ms O'Grady read for a politics degree at Manchester \nUniversity, followed by an industrial relations diploma.\n\nShe joined the UK Transport and General Workers' Union as a senior researcher in 1989 after several jobs in the \nvoluntary sector, including campaigning to improve workers' conditions in the City of London. Working for the \nTGWU was \"a big thing because it was the family union and it has a great story as a union\".\n\nOne of the people who inspired her was the late Jack Jones, TGWU general secretary at the time, and one of the \nmost powerful 20th-century trade union leaders. Ms O'Grady says she enjoyed cups of tea with him - \"and of course \nwas in awe of him\".\n\nAt the TGWU she campaigned to introduce the minimum wage, adding her weight to the long-running battle to \nconvince the UK government to enshrine it in law. \"In 1989 there were workers in Britain on \u00a31 an hour,\" she \nrecalls.\n\nThe Labour party, then in opposition, pledged to introduce the minimum wage when next in power, and it finally \nbecame law in 1999. Ms O'Grady regards the campaign as one of the milestones in her career.\n\nShe learned early on that dealing with issues that affect people's everyday lives can be extremely stressful, and \nfinding someone in the workplace to \"share a good laugh and relax with\" can be a useful safety valve.\n\nAs campaigns officer at the TUC in 1994, she fought for equal rights for part-time workers, better maternity rights \nand highlighted exploitative pay.\n\nShe also fought for better treatment of pregnant women at work. A mother of two children, she recalls the women \nwho told her they were given a choice of returning to work or losing their job shortly after giving birth. One woman \nwas asked if she \"could do a bit of admin work\", while she was still in hospital, she says.\n\nAlthough much has changed in the workplace, she says the job of fighting for better conditions and fair pay is far \nfrom over.\n\nIn a prolonged period of austerity, job cuts, falling living standards and uncertainty over working hours are leaving \ntheir mark. \"It has been a particularly rough time for working people who have been getting a smaller share of the \nfruits of their labour,\" she says.\n\nIn the summer she and her team took a bus around the UK to see the effects the government's austerity measures \nare having on people's lives. \"It was pretty shocking stuff,\" she says.\n\nShe worries whether decision-makers at the top who are ordering cuts in areas already under strain really \nunderstand the implications and what people's lives are like.\n\nCritics of trade unions question their relevance in today's workplace but Ms O'Grady responds that the reasons for \njoining a union remain unchanged - fairness of work conditions and pay.\n\nTUC membership, at just under 6m, has halved since the end of the 1970s but Ms O'Grady is undaunted. She \nadmits \"some of our traditional strongholds have gone in parts of the private sector\", making it more difficult to \norganise union activity, but says the bigger issue now is \"the way we change trade unionism to match the way \npeople work\".\n\nShe gives an example of supermarkets where people, including young workers, are on many different contracts but \nnever meet to discuss problems at work.\n\nIt is difficult to negotiate on a one-to-one to basis, she argues. \"Unless we find new ways to reset the balance of \npower between employers and workers we will see inequality continue to soar.\"\n\n\n\nThe traditional view of trade union leaders has often been synonymous with an aggressive, combative style but Ms \nO'Grady, although capable of driving her point home, has no time for bullying tactics.\n\nSo how does she describe her leadership style? She hopes she is a democratic leader: \"I try to treat others as I \nwant to be treated.\"\n\nInternally, she likes to discuss matters with her team, trusting them and giving them autonomy and, with a small \nnumber of policy and campaign staff, is proud of the way they \"punch above their weight\".\n\nOver the decades she has learned lessons in the struggle with employers and governments. On the negotiating \nfront, she believes \"being right is not always sufficient\" but has learned the importance of good relations, particularly \nwith private sector employers, in order to sort things out quickly \"without anyone feeling the loser\".

Earlier \nthis month she delivered a speech to the CFA Institute in London, in which she urged fund managers to become far \nmore vocal and visible.\n\nOne of the biggest threats that now hangs over the industry, she declared, is that asset managers are often tarred \nwith the same (negative) brush as bankers. While this may reflect prejudice - or public ignorance - the situation is \npartly the fault of asset managers, since so few of them are willing to talk openly about their business in a proactive, \nhuman fashion.\n\nInstead, asset managers tend to hide \"behind the scenes\", avoiding tough questions about issues such as \ninvestment fees, or even commenting about economic trends. But unless investment managers directly engage with \ncriticism, to explain what their industry does - and why it has a social function - they will be \"sitting ducks\" for a \nfuture backlash about fees and face growing complaints that they are \"milking\" customers.\n\n\"How I think we can improve our social value is that we stop whining and more constructively engage,\" Ms \nMorrissey says. \"I would like to see more fund managers on the radio, on television, in schools. High-profile \nindividuals should take on high-profile issues.\"\n\n\n\nNow these stern admonishments will undoubtedly infuriate some of Ms Morrissey's colleagues, after all, in the \naftermath of the 2008 credit crisis, financiers of all variety have avoided sticking their heads above the parapet, let \nalone jumping into mainstream television. In any case, many asset managers - unlike investment bank salesmen, \nsay - lack the temperament to grab the limelight.\n\nMs Morrissey's comments are nevertheless striking. For behind them lies a much bigger point - or, more accurately \n- a sense of imbalance in the financial world as a whole. In decades past, banks have zealously promoted their \ninterests, via public relations groups and lobbyists. But even as journalists' inboxes were filling up with missives \nfrom sell side lobby groups, particularly during the credit bubble, asset managers generally seemed quiet, if not \ninvisible and passive. Buy-side promotion was limited.\n\nLogic might suggest this imbalance should have corrected itself after the credit bubble: since 2008 the buy side has \nhad a strong reason to demand significant change, given how badly it was burnt. Indeed, it could be argued that the \ncredit bubble would never have become quite so egregious if the buy side had been more outspoken about \nprotecting its interests before 2008, and if it'd had as big an input into regulatory policy as the sell side.\n\nIn practice this rebalancing has not occurred to any degree, or not at least in Europe: though bank lobbyists remain \nhyperactive, the asset management industry has been far quieter (except, perhaps, in the US where there are more \ncharacters like Morrissey). Some asset managers blame that on the fact that the buy side is more fragmented: it is \nmuch harder to create a single, strong voice when you are dealing with hundreds of different investment \nmanagement companies, than a handful of big banks. But another reason may simply be that asset managers have \nfelt less inclined to band together since they have hitherto not been under attack as severely as bankers.\n\nBut that is no reason for complacency, Ms Morrissey observes. Shortly before she issued her admonishments to \nthe CFA managers, Martin Wheatley, the head of the Financial Conduct Authority, issued his own speech that \nwarned that regulators were stepping up scrutiny of issues such as fees, compensation and transparency. That may \nbe simply a shot across the bows of the industry, or it may herald a wider future clampdown. Either way, with \ninvestment returns having shrivelled in recent years, there is clearly potential for a wider public backlash.\n\nOf course, this is not a climate which is conducive to persuading those publicity-shy managers to jump into the fray \nor on to a television screen. It is tough to present a \"human\" face when people fear that they are about to come \nunder attack. But hiding behind public relations officials is no solution in a crisis either - just ask those unloved \nbankers. Either way, British asset managers would do well to heed Ms Morrissey's appeal and act on it, or else \nwork out a system for cloning her.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Due a pullback? Let's look at some market technicals.\n\nEven after the good run the S&P 500's 14-day relative strength index, a measure of momentum, stood at 66.8, still \nshy of the 70 mark above which is considered overbought territory.\n\nThat's because recent daily gains have pretty been hard won. No sharp \"melt up\" yet.\n\nSome investors think another signal of market overstretch is the gap between indices and their daily moving \naverages.\n\nThe S&P 500 is 9.6 per cent above its 200-dma. Quite a spread. But analysts at Strategas looked at the Nasdaq \nComposite's current 13 per cent divergence to its 200-dma and found it was not a very reliable bearish indicator.\n\nSo are investors overly sanguine? The CBOE Vix index is near historic lows, well below the 10-year average of 20, \nand at 13 around the level that contrarians often warn reflects complacency and an imminent equity sell-off.\n\nBut investor sentiment surveys don't yet suggest bullish over-exuberance.\n\n\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

If the \nbusiness is one of the 1.2m QuickBooks customers who have uploaded their back-office data to Intuit's servers, \nthey can give permission for Intuit's algorithms to analyse that information. In exchange, they are likely to receive \npreferential rates from the participating banks.\n\n\"Most small businesses borrow from their family and they've maxed out their credit cards,\" says Intuit chief \nexecutive Brad Smith.\n\n\"We're able to go inside your small business accounting, we can look at how many bills you've paid on time, who \nowes you money, and how your cash flow looks, and we've been able to write algorithms that will predict your credit \nrisk.\"\n\nUS banks currently mostly use credit bureaus, the small business financial exchange, as well as FICO and their \nown proprietary measures to determine credit scores.\n\nRichard Preece, director of the QuickBooks business, says that the product makes Intuit's core software offering \nmore attractive. \"We're using QuickBooks data to reduce the lender's risk and pass those savings back on to the \ncustomer,\" he says. \"It clearly makes QuickBooks more valuable because it's only by using QuickBooks that you \ncan use this service.\"\n\nHe notes that the volume of loans that pass through the system may allow new relationships to emerge from the \ndata. For example, Intuit has found that the number of vendors paid in the preceding six months is a good indicator \nof whether a business can pay down its loans, while the number of customers on its books is not.\n\nIntuit's share price has risen 20 per cent since the end of June, as it has increased its focus on cloud computing \nand mobile applications. Its revenues grew 9.5 per cent year-on-year to the end of July 2013 to $4.17bn, while net \nincome rose 8.3 per cent to $858m.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;The move is the latest sign that financial institutions and software providers are harnessing the power of cloud \ncomputing and data analytics to improve their services and minimise their risk.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year a North American subsidiary of Sage, Intuit's British-based competitor, announced a new tool that \nanalyses multiple data points to help businesses cross-sell to customers.\n\nBut established players such as Sage and Intuit increasingly face competition from start-ups.\n\nKabbage, an Atlanta-based start-up with operations in the UK, takes data from Facebook, Twitter and Yelp pages, \nas well as transaction information from online marketplaces such as Etsy, eBay and Amazon, to help determine a \nbusiness's credit profile. Kabbage worked with Intuit on QuickBooks Financing.\n\nZestFinance, started by a former VP of engineering at Google, Douglas Merrill, says loans made on the basis of its \nnumber-crunching algorithms result in 40 per cent fewer defaults than those made using other industry scores.\n\nIntuit says it has identified around 145 different data points - such as revenue, number of customers and payments \nto vendors over time - that help predict credit risk better than the blunter measure of a personal credit score.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Now, they are doing their own thing.\n\nWeak eurozone inflation data on Friday could fuel expectations of further stimulus measures from the European \nCentral Bank. The Bank of Japan, meanwhile, has dropped heavy hints  that if its aggressive asset purchase, or \n\"quantitative easing\" programmes do not drag the country out of deflation, it will step up action.\n\nBut with the US economy returning to more normal health, the US Federal Reserve is looking to scale back, or \n\"taper\" its QE. At the Bank of England, the talk is about an interest-rate increase, maybe by the end of next year.\n\nThe divergence runs the risk of creating damaging disharmony - especially in currency markets - and with interest \nrates at rock bottom levels it will test further central bankers' skills communicating their intentions to investors \nglobally. With no historical precedent for actions central banks have taken, the risk is of a bumpy ride.\n\n\n\n\"The divergence . . . compounds the uncertainty that inevitably surrounds the aggressive use of unprecedented \npolicies. There are likely to be false starts - as we have seen already in the US,\" says Mark Cliffe, chief economist \nat ING bank, referring to the unexpected Fed decision in September against starting to taper its stimulus. \"There is \nno consensus on how, or even if, these policies work. In a real sense, they are making it up as they go along,\" he \nsaid.\n\nJulian Callow, international economist at Barclays, added: \"There is way more uncertainty attached to the economic \nimpact, and hence calibration, of these non-conventional measures than central banks are generally willing to let \non,\" he said.\n\nAnd in growing signs of concerns over the potential cross-border impact policy change can have on other major \ndeveloped markets, the ECB warned this week that Fed tapering talk posed risks to eurozone financial stability.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;Some central banks in smaller advanced economies could start raising interest rates early next year - New \nZealand is tipped to be the vanguard. \"When that news really starts to hit us, it is going to be very significant for \nforex,\" says Jane Foley, foreign exchange strategist at Rabobank.\n\nHighlighting how central banks have acted in tandem, their balance sheets have all expanded massively since the \ncollapse of Lehman Brothers investment bank late 2008. While the Fed has grabbed the headlines and created \nmarket volatility merely by mentioning the possible tapering of its $85bn-worth of monthly bond buying, its balance \nsheet has expanded by almost $1tn to $3.86tn since the start of the year.\n\nLately the ECB's balance sheet has shrunk by more than a fifth to EUR2.94tn as banks have repaid funds borrowed \nthrough its three-year longer-term refinancing operations. Central banking is not just about printing cash, however. \nIt is also about setting the tone and conditioning expectations. Both the ECB and BoJ are maintaining, in central \nbank speak, a firm \"downward bias\".\n\nECB policy makers have been forced to react to clear divergences in economic performance. Weak eurozone \neconomic growth has been accompanied by high unemployment which, unlike in the US, shows scant sign of falling \nand inflation far below the ECB's target of an annual rate \"below but close\" to 2 per cent.\n\nCentral banks' record this year in effecting shifts in policy smoothly is not great. Initial hints about \"tapering\" by Ben \nBernanke, US Federal Reserve chairman, in May pushed US market interest rates sharply higher and created \nlevels of volatility not seen for two years.\n\n\"Increased volatility will be a feature of the post-Fed QE world,\" says Ken Wattret, European economist at BNP \nParibas. \"But the problem of exiting from exceptional policy measures is probably a bigger concern than the \ncomplications associated with central banks heading in opposite directions when it comes to asset purchases.\"\n\nDespite the US tapering talk, eurozone market interest rates have remained relatively stable. Yields on German \nBunds, which historically have been closely correlated with US Treasury yields, have decoupled. Even when the \nFed does start tapering, policies will remain ultra-accommodative across advanced economies, adds Peter \nOppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at Goldman Sachs. \"The broader message is that policy is going to \nremain very accommodative.\"\n\nThe ECB will be anxious, however, to ensure US Fed action does not prematurely tighten monetary policy \nconditions in the eurozone by pushing up borrowing costs in the region's weakest economies.\n\nDivergence in central bank policies, \"is a good sign to the extent that it tells you that the US economy is getting \nback to something like normal,\" argues Stephene Deo, head of global asset allocation at UBS. \"You always have \n\n\n\nthis phase where the US starts to pick-up and the Europeans are still easing. But there will be a pick-up in instability \nduring the transition.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Rivals \nseeking to close a competitive gap can legally reverse engineer the information. The proposed reforms, unveiled on \nThursday, only target methods for obtaining information that are illegal, such as espionage, bribery or theft.\n\nMr Barnier said: \"Cybercrime and industrial espionage are unfortunately part of the reality that businesses in \nEurope face every day. We have to make sure our laws move with the times and that the strategic assets of our \ncompanies are adequately protected against theft and misuse.\"\n\n\n\nHarmonisation of laws on intellectual property and related areas can be contentious within the EU, since some \nmember states have starkly different perspectives. The proposal also comes at a late stage in the Brussels \nlegislative calendar, with about five months left before the European parliament breaks for elections.\n\nThe European Commission estimates that 20 per cent of European companies were victim to an illegitimate attempt \nto obtain a trade secret over the past decade. Two in five companies think the risk of misappropriation increased \nover that period.\n\nAntonio Tajani, industry commissioner, said such protections were particularly important for smaller companies. \n\"They employ trade secrecy more intensively than larger companies - in part because of the cost of patenting and \nprotection against infringement.\"\n\nA majority of EU member states already cater for the protection of trade secrets in law. However, countries such as \nGermany, Denmark and Spain do not explicitly define what a trade secret entails.\n\nThe UK, Belgium, the Netherlands and France include no specific provisions for trade secrets in civil law and \nprotection against misappropriation often depends on interpretations of common law. The commission sees its \nproposal as broadly aligning Europe with civil law protections in the US and Japan.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

These joysticks would attach to an iPhone and be \nused to control a game on the small screen, replacing the touchscreen controls that are often too fiddly for fast-\npaced games.\n\nLogitech's PowerShell and Moga's Ace Power both cost around $100 and make an iPhone look a little like a \nPlayStation Portable or Game Boy. For now, only a minority of the games available on Apple's App Store are \ncompatible with these controllers but as sales of the peripherals increase, that is likely to change.\n\nGames developers used to complain that Apple was less enthusiastic about promoting them than other kinds of \napps or media but many say that has changed over the past year. Some speculate that gaming could play a more \ncentral role in any living-room push by Apple, with these controllers just one step in that direction.\n\nHowever, other technical advancements are still required, analysts say.\n\n\"What Apple could release in the next six months is probably not competitive with a console,\" says Ben Bajarin, \ntech analyst at Creative Strategies. Apple can already let people show games from their phone on a TV set through \nits Apple TV box's Airplay feature but for now, latency problems - the delay between pressing a \"jump\" button on \nthe phone and the onscreen character leaping into the air - have limited its appeal. Some WiFi equipment makers \nare starting to include the 60 GHz frequency that would allow for much faster transfer speeds and lower latency, \nwhich could solve this problem.\n\nApple would also need to improve Game Center, its social gaming hub, to allow for multiplayer matches, Mr Bajarin \nsays.\n\n\n\n\"This is going to take some time,\" he adds, \"but some of the pieces are starting to show up.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Slowly it dawned on workers at the Swedish retailer that Americans were buying them not to put \nflowers in, but to drink from: the European-style glasses Ikea stocked were just too small for US tastes.\n\nThat cultural misstep - along with others such as mattresses that were too hard and measured in centimetres, not \nking or queen size - was soon corrected. But the tension between the Swedish heart of the world's biggest furniture \nretailer and its far-flung outposts remains.\n\nThe latest demonstration came last week when French prosecutors placed the company and its two top executives \nin the country under formal investigation over spying allegations.\n\nThe probe is focusing on claims that Ikea's managers in France illegally obtained police records of their employees \nto check if they had dodgy pasts. According to people familiar with the investigation, it is less concerned with \nanother alleged spying angle uncovered: that Ikea may have used private detectives to check up on disgruntled \ncustomers.\n\nIkea itself says it is committed to finding out exactly what went wrong and putting it right. But the investigation - and \na number of other controversies involving the flat-pack furniture group around the world - highlights the challenges \nfor Ikea as it aims to double its revenues by 2020 to EUR50bn by growing rapidly into new countries such as India \nand Egypt.\n\nFounded in the small town of \u00c4lmhult in a province known as the Bible belt of Sweden, Ikea has maintained a \nstrong culture rooted in that thrifty and moral background. Co-workers, as Ikea calls its staff, are recruited heavily \non values and beliefs rather than purely skills or experience.\n\nVisitors to \u00c4lmhult are sometimes unnerved by what former Ikea executive Johan Stenebo has described as a cult-\nlike atmosphere: the Ikea hotel in the town has two bedside books, the Bible and an Ikea catalogue.\n\nIkea's founding tract in many ways is the 1976 manifesto of its founder Ingvar Kamprad, \"The Testament of a \nFurniture Dealer\". It contains slogans such as \"Expensive solutions to any kind of problem are usually the work of \nmediocrity\", and \"Only while sleeping one makes no mistakes\".\n\nThe culture has certainly contributed to Ikea becoming one of the most successful retailers globally, avoiding some \nof the severe problems companies such as Walmart, Carrefour and Tesco have experienced in their efforts to \nexpand internationally.\n\nBut both current and former executives question if the Swedish group will be able to keep that culture intact as it \nexpands into ever more countries and ups its number of store openings.\n\nIt is not just in France that Ikea has had problems recently. In Russia it fired two senior executives in 2010 for \ntolerating bribery. More recently, it has faced criticism over its literature by airbrushing women out of its Saudi \nArabian catalogue and excising an article on a lesbian couple from its magazine in Russia.\n\nSenior Ikea executives acknowledge that adapting the company's culture to national norms is a huge challenge. \nControversies such as that in France offer good potential for lessons, they add.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n\n\n&gt;Ikea was rolling out a new global code of conduct at the time and implemented it in France first with exercises \nwith all employees. It also put in a new legal department, risk manager and compliance rules in France.\n\nSimilarly, with its product range Ikea is imposing a slightly less one-size-fits-all approach. Most of its furniture is the \nsame whether in the Dominican Republic or China, but there are a few country-specific products where it makes \nsense. Store managers also have the freedom to arrange the example bedrooms, kitchens and living rooms on the \ntop floor of Ikea shops as they see fit, taking into account local sensitivities.\n\nMr Kamprad and his former assistant, Ikea's new chief executive Peter Agnefj\u00e4ll, seem more aware of the dangers \nthan most. The company still aims to increase the number of store openings from what Mr Agnefj\u00e4ll describes as a \nrecord low last year of five. But it has abandoned a plan to up the pace to 20-25 a year, a speed that worried Mr \nKamprad, who favoured 10-12.\n\nMany older Ikea managers remember the indigestion that followed previous expansion drives such as the one into \nthe US.\n\nThe prize of getting access to the wallets of the growing middle classes in places such as India and China is a big \none for Ikea. But it needs to ensure its southern Swedish values are not compromised to get there.\n\nRichard Milne is the FT's Nordic Correspondent\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, it is more than just a battle of semantics.\n\nBoth sides are keen to see the market legitimised by government regulation but are concerned that providers, \nwhether they be peer-to-peer lenders or crowdfunding marketplaces, will be penalised if the rules are poorly \nframed.\n\nCrowdfunding has become a catch-all term for various funding proposals, ranging from people taking equity stakes \nin new ventures to causes looking for donations to get off the ground.\n\nKickstarter, the world's largest crowdfunding platform, has a stated mission to help bring creative projects to life. \nThose pledging money over the platform tend to be offered free samples or special experiences rather than shares \nin return for their cash.\n\n\n\nThose that call themselves peer-to-peer lenders differentiate themselves from such crowdfunders by focusing \npurely on linking companies and individuals with those willing to lend them money at a certain rate of interest.\n\nThe FCA tried to create a distinction between these different forms of web-based fundraising by announcing plans \nto create separate levels of regulation for debt and equity funding services, Ms Groves noted.\n\nThis, she claimed, was more important than arguing whether debt-based fundraising should be classed as \ncrowdfunding or peer-to-peer lending.\n\n\"The characterisation of peer-to-peer simple loans versus debt-based crowdfunding models as low-risk versus high-\nrisk is, in our view, a mistake,\" she said.\n\n\"Both models allow retail investors to access lower-risk assets, but where there is a debt security or a retail bond \nthe funds are raised by a public limited company with a full offer document and higher standards of disclosure. That \nthese should be treated as higher-risk than a simple loan is counterintuitive.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

The WFE has been notified and a formal letter \nis being prepared, the people said.\n\nThe LSE's withdrawal comes as the WFE prepares to move its headquarters from Paris to the UK capital in coming \nweeks, seeking to forge stronger links between its members and their main users, investment banks and \ninstitutional investors.\n\nThe WFE, founded 53 years ago, counts most of the world's largest exchanges as its members, including CME \nGroup, NYSE Euronext, Deutsche B\u00f6rse, BM & F Bovespa of Brazil and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing.\n\nHowever the LSE's departure illustrates growing tensions between WFE members over key issues such as \ncriticism of banks' off-exchange trading activity. Some of the criticism is not shared by some exchanges that see \ntheir interests increasingly aligned with the banks.\n\nXavier Rolet, chief executive of the LSE and a trading executive at Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs, has \nfocused on improving relations with the LSE's 15 biggest customers, mostly banks, in his four year tenure.

But there is a good chance the other dynamics are going to be very \ndifferent.\n\nFor one, there is still, according to many involved, a strong possibility that the first global trade deal in the 18-year \nlife of the WTO will be secured.\n\n\n\nWhen Roberto Azev\u00eado this week called time on the frenzied Geneva negotiations he launched when he took over \nas the WTO's director-general in September, the temptation was to conclude that the whole exercise had collapsed.\n\nIt has not. In plenty of capitals this weekend officials will be trying to draft a plot with a happy ending for the global \ntrading system.\n\nWith good reason. The cost of failure is higher than it has ever been - there is a broad consensus that if the WTO \ndoesn't deliver something next week it will be a fatal blow to its function as a venue for trade negotiations. Plus, as \nMr Azev\u00eado told WTO members on Tuesday: \"We have made more progress in just the last few weeks than we \nhave over the past five years.\"\n\nThere is also another new dynamic that may say more about the state of the global economy. When they gather in \nBali it will be very hard to separate the camps into the \"north\" and \"south\" division that has dominated in the WTO \nfor most of its life.\n\nIncreasingly caught up in their own slowing economies, the Bric economies are fracturing. Brazil, China and Russia \nhave signalled their backing for a deal. So too have African countries and the influential Afro-Caribbean-Pacific \ngroup of small states. All of them seem satisfied with what has been negotiated in Geneva.\n\nTheir reasoning is clear. The main pillar of a Bali deal would be a new set of rules to remove red tape and ease the \nflow of goods across borders around the world. By some estimates, it would add a $1tn to global commerce. \nEmerging economies would be big beneficiaries.\n\nThe main hurdle now is India's apparent desire to renegotiate a \"peace clause\" related to how WTO rules account \nfor government food security programmes.\n\nThe food security discussion was started by the G33 group of developing nations. Their goal is to recalibrate the \nWTO rules on pricing formulas and subsidies that apply to governments supplying rice and other staples to the \npoor. And their argument has some merit: the rules, they rightly plead, are stricter than those governing the rich \nworld's export subsidies for farmers.\n\nBut in September, at China's urging, the group along with India, the US, EU and others decided negotiating a \npermanent solution was beyond reach in time for Bali. Better, they decided, to agree on a temporary ceasefire. And \nsince then the negotiations have been over the terms of that \"peace clause\".\n\nLast week in Geneva the G33, including India and others signed off on a four-year clause, during which time a \npermanent solution could be found. But by the weekend there were reports in the Indian press that it was unhappy \nwith that and in Geneva it started objecting to issues related to the main \"trade facilitation\" text that it had little \ninterest in before.\n\nIndia still has not announced its intentions publicly - a cabinet meeting to discuss a \"final\" position convened on \nThursday. The fear, however, is that in Bali, Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, will replicate the 2008 \nmanoeuvre that saw one of his predecessors, Kamal Nath, effectively quash a deal on behalf of the developing \nworld.\n\nBut the scenario this time around appears very different. If India kills the deal in Bali it will not be as a champion of \nthe poor world.\n\nBased on this week's carefully calibrated body language in Geneva, India this time has support only from Bolivia, \nCuba, Venezuela, Zimbabwe and South Africa, diplomats there say. Indonesia, the current head of the G33, has \nexpressed frustration with the hold-up. So too, quietly, have other developing nations.\n\nThat means that, deal or no Bali deal, the dynamics in the WTO are changing.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Furthermore, although the \"emergence of a new middle class\" is a common \nstory across emerging markets, what distinguishes Peru is that it has been driven by a sustained investment boom \nrather than the stalled consumption binge of some of its regional peers, such as Brazil.\n\nDespite slower Chinese growth and fears of Fed \"tapering\", Peru's $210bn economy is forecast to grow more than \n5 per cent this year, according to estimates by the International Monetary Fund, versus a regional average of 2.6 \nper cent.\n\n\"What's different about the Peruvian phenomenon has been the speed at which the middle-class has grown,\" says \nRolando Arellano, an eminent local sociologist. \"The latest generations have only seen progress and want to keep \nprogressing.\"\n\nA generalised propensity to invest seems to be one of the main reasons behind Peru's continued growth - and not \njust in cases such as Ms Mamani, or her 35,000 fellow students, who spend an average of $150 a month on tuition \nfees.\n\nLast year, investment was 28 per cent of gross domestic product, much of it in mining, matching Asian-style rates. \nThe country is the world's third-largest producer of copper and silver, and sixth largest gold producer, and Ollanta \nHumala, the president, says there is a pipeline of mining investments estimated at some $60bn.\n\nThat investment-fuelled growth has in turn sliced poverty rates in half to a quarter of the population and created a \nmiddle class now estimated at roughly half the population. Indeed, according to an October survey by Latam \nConfidential, a sister publication of the Financial Times, Peruvians are currently a third more likely to invest in \neducation than their regional peers, and almost twice as likely to buy health services. \"The driver of our growth is, in \nlarge part, sustained by the new middle-class,\" says Carolina Trivelli at the Institute of Peruvian Studies, a think-\ntank.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;Even so, not even Peru has been able to escape the generalised slowdown that hit Latin America this year. \nGrowth slowed in the third quarter to 4.4 per cent from 5.6 per cent in the previous quarter. \"We are not doing \nbadly, but we got used to being a shining star,\" says Oswaldo Molina, an economist in Lima who attended Oxford \nuniversity. \"We have to get used to that shine being tarnished.\"\n\nEconomists warn of the fragility of Peru's new middle-class and the need to push ahead with other reforms to \nsustain the boom in a country that suffers from weak institutions and where much of the economy is informal and \nthus untaxed. That, plus slowing growth and fears of rising crime in the world's largest producer of coca leaf, has \nalso sapped Mr Humala's popularity, which slumped to 26 per cent in October. Two years into his presidency, he is \nalso on his fourth prime minister.\n\nPolitics aside, officials remain upbeat. \"The economy has bottomed out and there is no other way but up,\" says \nJulio Velarde, head of the central bank. Miguel Castilla, the finance minister, says he expects the economy to grow \n6 per cent next year \"or even more\".\n\n\n\nOfficials also brush aside potential risks, such as Peru's current account deficit, which is equivalent to 5 per cent of \nGDP but covered by foreign direct investment, and point to numerous free trade agreements as a sign Peru is \n\"open for business\".\n\nFurthermore, if the economy does slow next year, the country can turn to a stabilisation fund where accumulated \nbudget surpluses have been deposited. Fitch, the rating agency, estimates the fund will have $9bn by this year's \nend.\n\nFor economists such as Mr Molina, though, the central question is for how long will Peru's new middle class \ncontinue to feel buoyant. One worrying sign is a slowdown in the pace of private investment, which is growing at \nonly 2 per cent, its slowest rate in four years. Ms Mamani sees the problem - but has no answer to it. \"By having the \nopportunity to study, I know I can have a prosperous future, and I am thankful,\" she says, rushing to the classroom. \n\"I just want the people in power to find a way to make all of this sustainable.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by John Paul Rathbone in London\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

A Martian landing from outer space and looking for somewhere to live in the UK would \nimmediately realise that government incentives are pumping up Britain's housing sector and house prices.\n\nTake a couple of recent indicators. Nationwide's house price index was up 1 per cent in October and almost 6 per \ncent year-on-year, while the National Institute of Economic and Social Research lifted its 2014 house price inflation \nforecast from 0.5 to 5 per cent-plus. No wonder the authorities are redirecting one of these incentive schemes - \nFunding for Lending, which provides banks with access to low-cost funding in return for commitments to keep \nlending to households and businesses - away from the housing market.\n\nHousebuilders' shares slipped 3 - 5 per cent on the news. That is a very modest adjustment set against the fivefold \nincrease seen in many cases over the past five years. But it looks a wise one. The authorities deny that there are \nimplications for the more targeted \"Help to Buy\" scheme, now expanded from assistance to buyers of newly built \nhomes to wider aid.\n\nBut if price inflation builds, fears of an early winding-back of HTB may persist. And that means the case made by \nhousebuilding bulls - that the highly cyclical sector learnt a hard lesson in the last crisis and that things will be \ndifferent this time round - will be thoroughly tested.\n\nThe argument is not without merit. Land prices are not yet exorbitant and the share of houses built on older, low-\nmargin land is still falling. Executives may, indeed, be more disciplined in the face of rising house prices and deploy \ncash return policies to investors' advantage. But, as economic conditions improve, smaller builders may also return \nto the sector, increasing competition. Above all, valuations are now rich, with the sector's price-to-book value well \nover 1.5, a level rarely sustained for long. Investors should be wary.\n\nEmail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Over 6m Chinese submitted petitions in the legally approved way in the first 10 \nmonths of 2013, according to the bureaucracy set up to receive their complaints.\n\nmailto:lex@ft.com\n\n\nIn the absence of democracy, the ancient system of petitioning is supposed to act as a social safety valve, allowing \nsubjects to complain directly to central government about regional leaders in the provinces.\n\nZhang Enxi, deputy director of the State Bureau for Letters and Calls, pledged \"one-stop reception, co-ordinated \nmanagement, and complete resolution\" as he unveiled a progress report on the new website on Thursday.\n\nBut petitions received through the website are still referred back to local authorities for resolution, a practice that \nputs the supplicants directly back into the hands of the people accused of causing the problem in the first place. Of \nthe 137,000 cases submitted to the new website the bureau set up this summer, 95,000 were passed along to other \nbureaucracies while the rest were declared redundant or otherwise invalid.\n\nA lot of people are quite savvy with the internet but moving it online doesn't solve the problem of how the issues are \naddressed,\" said Maya Wang of Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong, adding that petitioners who persist after initial \ncomplaints are not answered often face punishment.\n\nMany people have been on the petitions trail for years, bouncing back and forth between Beijing and their \nhometowns without redress.\n\n\"I've done everything, I've been through all the procedures, and they still won't resolve my case,\" a weeping woman \nnamed Zhao Min from Xingtai in Hebei Province told the Financial Times while plainclothes policemen filmed an \nimpromptu protest outside Thursday's press conference. She has been petitioning unsuccessfully since 1997 for \npunishment for the crowd of drunks who killed her 16-year old son on the street outside her home.\n\nMost petitions relate to rural land grabs or destruction of houses for urban construction, with labour and pension \nissues the third major category. But the desperate petitioners who flock to Beijing often bear more personal tales of \nunpunished murders, fatal police beatings, deaths due to medical negligence or private mines seized without \ncompensation.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;Mr Zhang said there will be a greater effort to divert legal cases to the judicial system. In China, courts are also \noften directly under the control of the local government but reforms announced during a policy gathering of the \nruling Communist Party earlier in November included pledges for a more independent judiciary.\n\nChinese police vans are regularly stationed at the entrances to Tiananmen Square and other gathering points to \nintercept petitioners. Petitioners gathering outside the UN embassy in Beijing this month - shortly before China won \na seat on the UN Human Rights Council - were so numerous that police buses were dispatched to pick them up.\n\nSome petitioners have suffered so much injury or become so obsessive in their quest that they lose sight of their \noriginal complaint. Xu Dajin of Jiangsu Province began petitioning after thugs hassled him for complaining about \nmining wastewater that destroyed his tea oil trees. He got some compensation, but he thought it was not enough. \nThe damage destroyed his chances of saving up enough money to get married, he said. \"I felt despair because the \ngovernment said it would be resolved but it never was,\" he told the FT\n\n&lt;&gt;By his own admission, Mr Xu has attempted suicide while on the petitions trail. \"I didn't have a cent left, I \nhadn't eaten in a few days, and I was afraid they would send me back to the local government.\" He waded into a \ncanal in Beijing but was fished out by police, who shipped him off to a mental hospital in his home town.\n\nChased down in a Beijing park a few weeks ago, Mr Xu is once again in a mental hospital in Jiangsu, which refuses \nto release him to the care of his mother and sister.\n\nA mental health law that took effect on May 1 2013 requires admissions to be voluntary and under a qualified \nphysician's supervision. But Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a group that tracks activism in China, says \n\n\n\nincarceration in mental health institutions is still often used to get rid of awkward, persistent petitioners and other \ntroublemakers.\n\nMr Zhang declined to give statistics on how many petitioners have been sent to mental institutions. He also denied \nthat \"legal petitioners\" are held in extralegal or 'black' jails, the most notorious of which, Majialou in Beijing, can hold \nhundreds of people at a time to be collected and sent back to their home provinces.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

They remove the batteries from their trucks every night so the \nthousands of migrants who make their way north towards Europe each day cannot steal their cars.\n\nYet this dusty, barren outpost - the nearest real town is a two-hour drive through the desert - is the first line of \ndefence against a booming trade in human trafficking, that is making waves in Europe.\n\n\"We're out here in the middle of nowhere,\" said Aji Lendi, a soldier in the barracks. \"We are unable to do daily \npatrols because we don't have proper resources. We pay for gasoline out of our own pockets. We even have to pay \nto replace our own tyres. The world ought to be paying attention here. But there has been no action taken.\"\n\nEuropean officials and human rights monitors are increasingly alarmed by an apparent spike in illegal arrivals of \nmigrants crossing the Mediterranean. Many of these have made their way from Africa, past the desert tundras that \nsurround al-Wigh, an airstrip and military base considered the last outpost before the Niger and Chad frontiers \nabout 130km to the south.\n\nDrug and alcohol smugglers as well as migrants have long used sparsely populated and porous Libya as a transit \npoint to Europe. But security officials worry the problem has become worse since the country's 2011 revolution, \nwhich toppled Muammer Gaddafi's regime and swept away his security forces.\n\n\"The problem of illegal immigration and smuggling routes has been persistent for years, even before the revolution,\" \nsaid Ali Adam Beli, deputy chief of the Supreme Security Council, a branch of Libya's ministry of interior, in the \nsouthern city of Murzuq, where migrants make their way from Libya's eastern and southern deserts. \"It's completely \nimpossible to secure the borders with the resources we have.\"\n\nWhile Gaddafi had networks of informants among the smugglers, the nascent and inexperienced Libyan security \nforces - based on tribal militias that sprang up after the revolution - are the only line of defence this far south. \n\"Who's going to call us with tips?\" said Mr Lendi. \"We're the ones who report what's happening.\"\n\nLibya's human trafficking business is rooted in centuries-old trade routes. Ethnic Tebu and Tuareg Libyans, many of \nthem used to nomadic desert lifestyles, have longstanding tribal and family ties across the borders to Niger and \nChad.\n\nIn recent years, trucks loaded with Libya's subsidised fuel, flour and sugar have crossed the border towards Niger \nand Chad, and come back loaded with migrants who pay sometimes exorbitant fees to get into Libya to find work or \nmake their way across the Mediterranean to Europe. Over the past few years ethnic Arabs have gotten into the \nlucrative game as well.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;Migrant smugglers can earn up to $1,700 per cross-border run, before bribes to officials and bandits along the \nway. A less risky run from the border to Sebha, the de facto capital of southern Libya, might rake in about $600 per \nrun.\n\n\n\nTransporting an illegal migrant all the way from the border to Tripoli might earn a smuggler $400 per head. Many \nsmugglers say prices have started to decrease as more smugglers have flooded the market. Those in the riskier \nbusiness of sending drugs or alcohol can earn $20,000 per run. By comparison, an average civil servant in Libya \nmakes about $500 per month. Risks are low. Those caught and arrested smuggling are often let off with modest \nfines.\n\nSome local officials in southern Libya estimate that 70 per cent of the young men in their towns and villages make \ntheir living from smuggling. \"The problem is that young people are being lured into this lucrative business,\" said \nMohamed Bady, a 32-year-old activist and student. \"Rather than go to school they may want to get involved in \ntrafficking.\"\n\nThe business hurts Libya in other ways. Competition to control smuggling routes often underlies the clashes \nbetween rival ethnic and tribal groups, such as a violent outbreak between Tebu and Arab tribes last year that left \nmore than 150 dead. And Narcotics smuggled in from abroad have made their way into the hands of unemployed \nyouth.\n\nIn addition to Europe, much of north Africa is also increasingly worried by the situation in Libya. Egyptian officials \nregularly seize weapons and drugs along their 1,115km desert frontier with Libya. In one November 15 bust, \nEgyptian armed forces reportedly seized a cache of sniper rifles with ammunition and 2,500 Tramadol pills. The US, \nUK, UN and Arab League have all provided training to Libyan border guards.\n\nBut Libyan security forces say they're overwhelmed. Mr Lendi said the 300 or so men who work in rotating two or \nthree-week shifts at al-Wigh, under the authority of the ministry of defence, are often outmanned and outgunned. \nJust a few weeks ago, several members of the brigade were killed in a shootout with alleged drug traffickers.\n\nThe tide of people willing to pay huge amounts and take enormous risks to cross borders also dwarfs interdiction \nefforts. Abukar Sadek, a 25-year-old from Burkina Faso being held at al-Wigh, said he spent three weeks in the \ndesert slowly making his way towards Libya.\n\n\"The road was very dangerous,\" said Mohamed See, a 27-year-old who said he sold his failing store and paid the \nequivalent of $1,500 to get himself from his home in Mauritania to Libya, where he was caught by border guards. \n\"But I agreed to go anywhere the smugglers agreed to take me. I left home to find a job.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Such a \npolicy may need legislation to enforce, or at least changes to the powers of Ofcom to push through such policy.\n\nMs Goodman said: \"Having a mobile or a fixed line should not be a luxury item - most people need them in their \neveryday life. It's time the government took action to protect consumers against the great phone rip off.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Digging out 360m tonnes of iron ore per year from \nAustralia's Pilbara desert will be $3bn cheaper than first thought. The mining major says it can find more ore in \nexisting holes in the ground than in digging new holes. Yet Rio still has the pedal to the metal. Production will rise \nfrom 290m tonnes to over 330m tonnes by 2015, two years before the full ramp-up. Each additional tonne of \ncapacity will absorb $120 to $130 per tonne of capital, versus earlier guidance for $140. Less capital intensity is \nwhat investors want from miners these days, isn't it?\n\nInvestors will not mind so long as they own a super low-cost producer which can afford to move first, like Rio. By \nincreasing volumes, Rio can cope with a dip in iron ore prices. Take the extra 40m tonnes for 2015 implied by the \nnew timetable. It may not overwhelm the market, but it is a lot of iron ore: equivalent to half the expected production \ngrowth from China that year, says Liberum. Cash costs for China's domestic producers are likely to be some way \nabove the $23 per tonne which Rio gets in the Pilbara. Even other majors, such as BHP Billiton, do not come out \nwell on this score. Some justification then for the relative outperformance of Rio's shares versus other miners this \nyear (although they are down 8 per cent in the year to date.)\n\nCould Rio return capital to shareholders? Having approved the Pilbara expansion, it could try generating cash next \nyear through selling non-core assets. But as Rio has found this year, it is not so easy to flog off aluminium or \ndiamonds, especially when compared to the buyers BHP could arguably find for its oil assets. One for Wealth of \nNations readers to bring up at Rio's investor days next month, perhaps.\n\nEmail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

That was one of the few targets that chief executive Kazuo Hirai left unchanged when he cut Sony's full \nyear net profit forecast by 40 per cent in October, under pressure from falling sales of TVs and other electronics.\n\n\n\nSony's optimism about its mobile business, however, is not shared by many analysts and observers.\n\n\"The company [Sony] plans to expand market share for its key products, but we see no signs of this happening,\" \nsays Shiro Mikoshiba, analyst at Nomura.\n\nAs the growth of smartphones in more mature western markets slows, Samsung and Apple have established \nthemselves as the dominant players with their strong research and marketing budgets, while a growing number of \ncheaper Chinese makers are carving out their place at the lower end.\n\nThe result was that Sony's global market share position fell from third to seventh in the past year, accord-ing to data \nfrom Canalys, the market research group. As an indication of the tough task facing Sony, Calum MacDougall, head \nof marketing at Xperia, said that \"one of our key tasks is to make people aware that Sony makes smartphones\".\n\nSony's strategy for making themselves stand out in a crowded marketplace, says Mr MacDougall, is \nstraightforward: cramming the technology and entertainment from Sony's other divisions, such as cameras and \ngames consoles, into pocket-sized devices that can also make phone calls.\n\nThe smartphone division has been a primary beneficiary of the sprawling group's attempts to foster more \ncollaboration between its divisions, with recent products including a camera lens that snaps on to the phone and an \noffer of free Sony Pictures movies to Xperia owners.\n\nThat collaboration has potential, says Rachel Lashford, analyst at Canalys, but it has yet to translate into strong \nsales. Sales were up 9 per cent year-on-year last quarter, slower than total market growth of 44 per cent, according \nto Canalys data.\n\nThe vast Chinese market presents a further problem for Sony, according to analysts.  To break into the list of top \nfive vendors globally, says Melissa Chau, analyst at IDC, \"they would pretty much have to crack that China \nproblem.\"\n\nThe issue is not just price competition with domestic Chinese brands. Sony's sales there have also been hurt in the \npast by anti-Japanese sentiment.\n\nLate last year, when China and Japan clashed over claims to islands in the south China Sea, Sony's sales fell \ndramatically, according to data from market researchers IDC. Although they have recently come back, so have \ntensions, as China claimed the airspace over those islands as part of its defence zone, forcing Japanese civilian \ncarriers to notify it of their flight plans there.\n\nAnalysts say that Sony has increased its marketing budget by 50 per cent this year. Recent ads play up its \nconnectivity with other Sony products such as its smartwatch, and some more unusual technical features that its \ncompetitors' phones lack - including the fact that users can take the waterproof phone for a swim.\n\n\"I like where they're going in trying to carve out niches. That's all you can do against a competitor such as \nSamsung,\" says Ms Chau.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Medicaid was expanded under the law, although some Republican governors have chosen \nnot to participate in the larger programme.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

A more \nworrying, and plausible, interpretation is that Beijing has decided to square up to the US in the western Pacific. East \nAsia is looking an ever more dangerous place.\n\nWhen Xi Jinping met Barack Obama in California earlier this year, the Chinese president told his US counterpart the \nPacific Ocean was large enough to accommodate two great powers. The inference was that the US and China \nshould divide the spoils. Also implicit in the remark, though, was that China would not accept a status quo that saw \nthe US remain the Pacific's pre-eminent power. At the summit, Mr Obama sidestepped the issue. Now it seems Mr \nXi has decided it is time for China to start grabbing its share.\n\n\n\nThe Senkaku have been administered by Japan since the late 19th century, apart from a spell of US control after \nthe second world war. China restaked a claim during the early 1970s, but for decades did little to press its case. \nSince the 2008 Olympics, Beijing has adopted a more assertive approach, making regular incursions into the \ndisputed territory's sea and air space. This has prompted a US warning that the area is covered by the US-Japan \nmutual security pact.\n\nThis US commitment is now being tested. The question Beijing seems to be asking is how far will Mr Obama go to \nuphold the existing order. China's strategic objective is to push the US away from its coastline and establish its \nsuzerainty in the East and South China seas. Does an America exhausted by wars in the Middle East have the \npolitical will to risk conflict in Asia in order to defend a few uninhabited rocks? It was probably no accident that \nBeijing's timing coincided with one of the most troubled periods of Mr Obama's presidency.\n\nWashington's decision to send two B52 bombers into the newly designated \"air defence identification zone\" - \nflouting Beijing's demands that flights be notified and thereby risking \"emergency defensive action\" - suggests it \nunderstands the nature of the challenge.\n\nChuck Hagel, the US defence secretary, called the Chinese move \"a destabilising attempt to alter the status quo in \nthe region\". Other US officials were less diplomatic. Beijing, though, is playing a long game. The $64,000 dollar \nquestion in east Asia is whether the US has the staying power to resist a sustained Chinese push for regional \nhegemony?\n\nThe immediate impact of Beijing's new flight rules is to heighten the already significant risk of an armed clash with \nJapan over the islands. The Chinese zone overlaps with Toyko's long-established ADIZ. The danger of \nmiscalculation on both sides is far from negligible. In Shinzo Abe, Japan has a nationalist prime minister determined \nnot to be cowed by his country's more powerful neighbour - nor to be over-influenced by private US warnings that \nTokyo should play its part in lowering the political temperature.\n\nMr Abe is an unabashed revisionist with a dangerous habit of airbrushing the nasty bits from Japanese history. He \nis also looking for an excuse to amend Japan's constitution to provide it with something more than a defensive \nmilitary capability. A clash, accidental or intended, with China around the Senkaku would provide just such a \njustification.\n\nThis leaves Mr Obama in a distinctly uncomfortable position. The US has to make clear to China that it stands \nbehind Japan in the dispute, but at the same time it wants to avoid giving encouragement to Mr Abe to ratchet up \ntensions in the region. Each and every one of China's neighbours is watching closely to see precisely where \nWashington strikes the balance between these two objectives.\n\nFor the US there is much more at stake than its relationship with Japan. Beijing's stand-off with Tokyo over the \nSenkaku is one of many territorial disputes between China and its neighbours. The new airspace restrictions \noverlap with the South Korean zone as well as with Japan's territorial claims. The Philippines is unhappy with \nWashington for what it sees as a US failure to give it sufficient support in its dispute with Beijing over a group of \nislands in the South China Sea. Vietnam has a separate quarrel with China over its maritime borders.\n\nConsciously or otherwise, Beijing has now turned control of the air space around the Senkaku into a litmus test of \nthe US security commitment to east Asia. For Washington to accept the Chinese restrictions would be to send a \nsignal to every other nation in the region that the US cannot be relied on to defend the status quo against Chinese \nexpansionism.\n\nYet to demonstrate its resolve as a resident east Asian power by constantly patrolling the disputed air space is to \naccept a new source of friction with Beijing. My guess is that Mr Obama, accused of presiding over a collapse of \nUS power in the Middle East, cannot afford to back down over the Senkaku.\n\nChinese policy makers are nothing if not assiduous students of history. The rise of Germany at the end of the 19th \ncentury has long featured prominently in the curriculum of Beijing's foreign policy elite. China, these officials tell \nvisitors, will not repeat the Kaiser's miscalculation in uniting Germany's neighbours in opposition to its rise to great \n\n\n\npower status. This attentiveness to the past now seems to be taking second place to China's determination to \nassert its power. History's mistakes are often repeated.\n\nphilip.stephens@ft.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

The government has also banned once-\nlucrative referral fees in an attempt to stymie what it terms a \"compensation culture\".\n\nSlater & Gordon has bought other firms in the UK, including Russell Jones & Walker for \u00a353.8m in 2012. It has \nmade four smaller acquisitions in the UK since August, including that of John Pickering & Partners, a Liverpool firm \nof asbestos-claims specialists, this week.\n\nSlater & Gordon's stock exchange announcement revealed that it has extended its debt facility with Westpac and \nNational Australia Bank from A$67.5m to A$215m both to fund the cash element of the Pannone acquisition but \nalso to provide \"ample funding headroom to drive future growth\".\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Royal Dutch Shell's stake remains \nunchanged at 15 per cent with Iraqi state entities owning the rest.\n\nmailto:philip.stephens@ft.com\n\n\nExxon's relationship with the Iraqi government soured in 2011 when it signed six contracts to explore for oil in Iraqi \nKurdistan without Baghdad's approval. The central government considers such contracts illegal.\n\nThe central Iraqi government has pursued a policy of blacklisting any oil company that did deals in Kurdistan, telling \nthem they had to choose between the north and the south. But, unusually for a big foreign oil company, Exxon has \nmanaged to hang on to its interests in both parts of Iraq.\n\nWest Qurna, which is located about 50km northwest of Basra, is one of the largest oilfields in the world. Exxon \nestimates that West Qurna 1 will produce as much as 600,000 barrels of oil per day by the end of 2013.\n\nPetroChina said in a statement that entering West Qurna would allow it to \"achieve synergies with its other projects \nin Iraq\" and help it develop \"a larger and stronger presence in . . . upstream operations in the Middle East\".\n\nChinese companies already have a big footprint in Iraq. CNPC, PetroChina's state-owned parent, is developing the \nhuge Rumaila field near West Qurna, in a partnership with BP and Iraqi entities. PetroChina also has stakes in the \nIraq's Halfaya and Ahdab fields.\n\nThe contract for West Qurna 1 was one of a number signed by big foreign oil companies in Iraq after the fall of \nSaddam Hussein. They were designed to rehabilitate oilfields that had suffered from years of war, sanctions and \nneglect.\n\nBut the experience has been dispiriting for the majors. Tough fiscal terms have made it hard for them to make \nmoney on the contracts. Infrastructure constraints, especially a shortage of pipelines and storage facilities, have \nhampered production and Iraqi bureaucracy has proved crushing.

Over the next three to five \nyears investors were even more positive, and indicated an allocation increase of 2.2 per cent, representing a flow \nof about $2.75tn.\n\n\"Every crisis shows that only those who move against the consensus will make money,\" said Andreas Utermann, \nchief investment officer for Allianz Global Investors. Emerging markets \"might get cheaper, but unless the global \nfinancial system collapses you will make money in the long run.\"\n\n\n\nThe cautious optimism of institutional investors stands in sharp contrast to the views of retail investors. While \npension funds and insurers have on the whole kept faith with emerging markets despite a bruising year, retail \ninvestors have yanked billions of dollars out since May, when the Federal Reserve announced plans to scale back \nits monetary stimulus.\n\nBut the importance of retail investors is dwarfed by institutional pools of capital like pension funds and \nendowments, and some analysts argue that this money will prove much more \"sticky\" when the Fed eventually \ndoes end its quantitative easing programme.\n\n\"While we remain cautious on the EM asset class as we head into the new year, the evidence from institutional \ninvestors suggests there should be underlying technical support for the market\" at the start of 2014, Morgan \nStanley said in a separate note.\n\nEquities and corporate bonds are the most attractive asset classes in developing markets, according to the survey. \nMexico, China and Brazil emerged as the most attractive countries in which to invest, while Turkey, Brazil, \nArgentina, Venezuela and India were the least popular.\n\nHowever, the Morgan Stanley survey does not indicate an overwhelming desire to allocate more money to \nemerging markets. Almost a third of those polled do not intend to change their allocations in the near future, and a \ntenth intends to reduce their exposure.\n\nEven among those that are planning to allocate more capital to bonds and stocks in the developing world most are \nonly planning an increase of less than 2 percentage points. That underscores the level of uncertainty over next \nyear's outlook for emerging markets.\n\n\"Opinion towards EM is divided and there are different shades even within my own organisation,\" said Alan Wilde, \nhead of fixed income and currencies at Baring Asset Management. \"Some are very bullish while some think it's \ngame over for emerging markets.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Books line the walls, alongside framed coloured \nscrolls from the Koran. Ayatollahs Khomeini and Khamenei stare down grimly at the visitor. On the opposite wall \nhangs a photo-portrait of Hassan Nasrallah, the firebrand cleric and Hizbollah leader.\n\nMy host is Hossein Shariatmadari, the much-feared editor and commentator at Kayhan, mouthpiece of Iran's \nIslamic fundamentalists. (He prefers the term \"principlists\" but I point out the term will not pass FT house style.) He \nis a short, balding man with piercing eyes and a smooth grey beard. His prose is said to be elegant but withering.\n\nIran's foreign minister, the US-educated Javad Zarif, once complained that a Kayhan commentary criticising his \nrole in the nuclear negotiations had triggered such severe backache that he was confined to a wheelchair for \nseveral days. When I mention this to Mr Shariatmadari, he emits a loud chortle.\n\nOur conversation is a reminder that not everyone shares the mild euphoria sweeping Tehran after this week's \ninterim agreement between Iran and world powers on curbing its nuclear programme. Nor should we assume that \nIran's fractious relationship with the rest of the world will end soon.\n\nMr Shariatmadari, who was arrested and tortured in the last days of the Shah, preaches radicalism at home and \nabroad. Radical Islam knows no borders, he says. The Arab revolutions are not an Arab awakening. \"It is an Islamic \nawakening,\" he says.\n\nAs for the US, there are too many sleights, too many injustices to offer any hope of rapprochement. The US-backed \ncoup against Mohammed Mossadeq in 1953; the \"ruinous\" oppression of the Shah; the nest of spies in the US \nembassy in Tehran; Washington's support for Saddam Hussein in the Iran-Iraq war; the 1987 downing of an Iranian \ncivilian airliner over the Gulf; and latterly sanctions that have severely squeezed Iran's economy.\n\n\n\nMr Shariatmadari, a student of history, does not believe Tehran was forced into negotiations by its own weakness. \nHe epitomises how hardliners view the trajectory of the world since the 1979 Islamic revolution: \"Then we did not \nown anything, now we have everything. We are among the top 10 most technologically advanced countries in the \nworld and we are a regional power - and our enemies are in a very weak position.\"\n\nRight now the hardliners are biding their time, having suffered a decisive defeat in June's presidential election. \nPresident Hassan Rouhani - who completed his first 100 days in office this week - is more media-savvy than his \npopulist predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadi-Nejad, who once threatened to wipe Israel off the map.\n\nEducated Iranians look on the eight-year Ahmadi-Nejad regime with a mixture of horror and embarrassment. Horror \nat the self-inflicted damage brought about by wrong-headed economic policies that have quadrupled inflation in \nthree years and wasted $600bn of oil revenues - about $8,000 per person. Embarrassment that a proud nation with \na sophisticated culture should have become so isolated. As one government adviser said: \"Ahmadi-Nejad was \nclever but was not well-read - a dangerous combination.\"\n\nAn artist, desperate to share her optimism about a better future for Iran, says the past three months have been a \nrevelation. \"Even the most ignorant have become philosophers. We have moved from the Middle Ages to the \nRenaissance.\"\n\nThere are so many friendly faces, so many oversized meals and so many good jokes (\"What are you doing in Iran?\" \nasked one security guard. \"Don't you have a job to do?\") that it seems unfair to point out that not all runs smoothly \nin Tehran.\n\nIranians hate being pinned down. Answers to questions either last 20 minutes or are confined to a single enigmatic \nsentence. As one Tehran businessman with close connections to the regime explained: \"You westerners like black \nor white, or yes or no. But this is the Middle East, where everything is grey. We prefer: it depends, perhaps, maybe \n- or simply Inshallah (God willing).\"\n\nTime is also an elastic concept. After being given the runaround ahead of an interview with Mr Rouhani, our Tehran \ncorrespondent finally demanded a 300 per cent guarantee on an 8am encounter. The reply? \"We cannot do 300 per \ncent, we can only offer maximum 90 per cent. Maybe we can offer 100 per cent, but only after the sanctions are \nlifted and we can import it.\"\n\nlionel.barber@ft.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

A camera recognises you and instantly \npersonalises the screen. Ask what is on the Discovery Channel, the voice recognition understands and shows you. \nCall up Breaking Bad, and the device offers a choice of episodes on live TV, Netflix or its own video service.\n\nBut this is not the long-awaited Apple TV that customers - and investors - have been yearning for. It is Microsoft's \nnew Xbox One console, which as well as gaming has received rave reviews for its media-centre capabilities.\n\n\"Using voice to navigate around the TV experience opened my eyes to the potential with this experience. Other \nboxes have tried this and failed,\" said Ben Bajarin, analyst at Creative Strategies, in a review of the console.\n\nA year ago, when Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, began to raise expectations that it was about to launch a new \nTV product, Apple's existing set-top box was par for the course in a market of humdrum streaming devices and \nclunky smart TVs. But now it looks to be in danger of being left behind by the more radical steps taken by its rivals.\n\nAs well as the Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4, which both sold 1m units in their first day on sale this month, \nGoogle has released its $35 Chromecast, which allows smartphone-toting couch potatoes to transmit wirelessly \nwhatever is on their small screen to the big one. It works with most devices that can run Google's Chrome web \n\nmailto:lionel.barber@ft.com\n\n\nbrowser. Apple offers something similar with its Airplay feature, but it is limited to its own devices and its Apple TV \nreceiver is three times as expensive.\n\nAt the same time, Samsung is courting developers to make apps that run on its mobiles and smart TVs, as well as \ntouting integration between them for consumers, such as carrying over a film from a TV to a tablet when you leave \nthe living room.\n\n\"A more advanced living room play is beginning to look like a growing opportunity for Apple,\" says Dan Cryan, \ndigital media analyst at IHS. \"The rest of the market has moved on a lot.\"\n\nGoogle, Microsoft and Samsung all have viable \"ecosystems\" that encompass the biggest screen in the house and \nthe smallest in the pocket, Mr Cryan says, while Apple still sits on the sidelines in TV.\n\n\"It would be strange for a company as involved in entertainment as it is to not try to further its involvement in the \none major screen and point of interaction out there in consumers' homes that it's not already got some kind of story \nfor.\"\n\nThis week, Apple paid about $360m to acquire PrimeSense, an Israeli company that provided some of the \ntechnology behind the previous Xbox's motion-sensing device, Kinect.\n\n\"Some sort of living room appliance is in Apple's future and gesture technology could be critical,\" wrote analysts at \nJefferies in a note to clients this week, calling PrimeSense a \"global pioneer and leader in gesture technologies.\n\n\"Smart TVs and gaming consoles are key recipients of these technologies.\"\n\nHowever, Jefferies analysts also described Apple TV as \"the Unicorn\", as it had been rumoured for so long without \never being seen.\n\nApple executives have been dropping hints about its plans for the TV market for almost two years. After Steve Jobs, \nApple's late co-founder, told his biographer Walter Isaacson that he had \"finally cracked\" the perfect user interface \nfor TV, in 2011, Mr Cook said on several occasions throughout 2012 that it was an \"area of intense interest\".\n\n\"It's a market that we see, that has been left behind,\" he told NBC last December in a rare TV interview. In May, he \nsaid Apple had sold more than 13m TV boxes to date, about 6.5m of which were in the previous 12 months.\n\nSince then, however, Apple's progress in TV has fallen short of the revolutionary. Its existing $100 set-top box has \nacquired new channels such as HBO Go, ESPN, the NFL and Sky News. But while the iPhone and iPad's user \ninterface has seen a complete overhaul, the Apple TV still looks pretty much the same as before software design \nduties were handed to Sir Jonathan Ive late last year.\n\nPeople who own the Apple TV box spend far more on content than those who merely own an iPhone or iPad, \nanalysts say. In June, Apple said it sells more than 800,000 TV episodes and 350,000 movies every day on iTunes, \na large portion of which is through Apple TV, generating upwards of $3m a day in revenue.\n\nA substantial amount of that spending is believed to be from \"cord cutters\" who have used Apple TV to replace their \ncable subscription. But some analysts believe that Apple's future is more likely to be working with the existing \nbroadcasters and service providers than against them.\n\nMr Bajarin says that Apple could take the same partnership approach to TV that it did with AT&T for the iPhone.\n\n\"The Xbox One has convinced me that a very disruptive opportunity exists to become the one box for TV,\" says Mr \nBajarin, \"and you don't become the one box without doing a deal with the service providers\", because they still \ncontrol direct access to their networks.\n\nApple could one-up Microsoft by striking such a deal with the lure of better technology and the opportunity for cable \ncompanies to sell more expensive services, he suggests, citing Apple's recent talks with Time Warner.\n\n\n\nBut striking many of those deals across the patchwork of satellite and cable operators in the US and abroad would \nbe a long-term task. One former Apple employee says the company believed taking that approach was too risky \nbecause it would rely on competitors' networks for quality of service. If Mr Jobs had indeed \"cracked\" how to sell an \nApple TV through such networks, this person said, it would be on sale by now.\n\nPerhaps PrimeSense and other deals can help Apple raise its game in the living room but for now, many watchers \nof the company still doubt its TV unicorn exists.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Karl Marx believed it was material interest in the \nform of class conflict - the latter driven by the state of technology. At the other extreme, John Maynard Keynes \nasserted that it was the ideas of economists and political philosophers that mattered for good or evil.\n\nThe evidence is beginning to pile up on the side of Keynes, although the ideas in question are less elevated than \nthose of the political philosophers. These tentative conclusions are reinforced by the behaviour of the present \nConservative-led British government.\n\nSome purist Conservatives may not believe in any economic intervention - or say they do not. But they always do \nintervene, whatever their leaders say on platforms. And intervention is indeed required when the economy is \nworking below a sustainable level of capacity operation, whether commentators prefer to call such a state of affairs \na double-dip or treble-dip recession - or just plain stagnation.\n\nThe interesting feature is the form the intervention takes. British governments are inhibited from subsidising \nmanufacturing industry or too blatantly depreciating the currency by international agreements and the fear of \nretaliation. So when Conservative-led governments are in power, the intervention overwhelmingly takes the form of \nstimulating housebuilding.\n\nThe economic recovery in the 1930s was led by a rash of suburban development in the London area and the \nsoutheast. Harold Macmillan's rise to the premiership in the late 1950s was facilitated by his earlier role in \ndelivering a Tory conference pledge to build 300,000 houses year. Margaret Thatcher was ostensibly a non-\ninterventionist but she surely despised people who do did not own homes. In the present decade the one form of \nstimulus the Cameron-Osborne regime has seen fit to apply - and that on a large scale - has been to home \nownership.\n\nAll kinds of respectable-sounding reasons are offered for that penchant. For instance, it is said that homeowners \nare more likely to vote Tory because they have \"a stake in the country\". But there is a simpler and, to my mind, \nmore convincing explanation: it is the one form of fiscal stimulus that does not overtly add to the fiscal deficit. \nPresent stimuli take the form mainly of guarantees to lenders, which are indeed noted in the Budget documents but \ndo not add to the red ink unless and until they are called upon to be honoured.\n\nDoes this explanation apply outside the UK? Unravelling the complexities of the US government-sponsored housing \nfinance agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is incompatible with a continued attachment to one's sanity. But \nalthough the older of these two agencies, Fannie Mae, was formed as part of President Franklin Roosevelt's New \nDeal, Republicans have not simply sought abolition.\n\nIt is better that governments stimulate housebuilding than do nothing at all, or leave everything to monetary policy. It \nis good that the governor of the Bank of England is on the watch for housing bubbles. But, despite the \nannouncement on Thursday that the Funding for Lending Scheme would cease to support mortgages in 2014 , the \nmain emphasis of government support is still on house purchases. My preferred solution is that when demand flags, \ncash should be put into the hands of residents to spend as they think fit. Frequently they will not spend it well. But \ndo we really think that politicians and civil servants, jockeying for position, will spend it better?\n\n\n\nThe biggest obstacle to this kind of even-handed approach is the balanced-budget dogma. Not that the latter is \nbeing observed. However, George Osborne, chancellor of the exchequer, hankers after it and now talks of it being \nachieved in the next parliament, should he still be in a position to influence events. The biggest difficulty of those \nwho do not follow him is the lack of alternative. At what level should deficits be permissible? The central \ngovernment, the city or lesser authority? It would hardly make sense to let everyone fix their deficit by choice, so \nthat every schoolboy could pay for his tuck-shop binge by scrawling his name on a piece of paper.\n\nThere is the old examination question about a western traveller who so impresses the inhabitants of a remote island \nwhen he pays for a meal by cheque that the cheque circulates from one person to another without being cashed. \nWho then pays for his dinner? The correct answer used to be: everyone, through slightly higher inflation, when \nthere is full employment; and no one when there are unused resources that can be brought into operation. Hardly a \nsatisfying response when most economies are neither at the extreme of intense slump or full employment. The \ntechnocratic answer, that desirable deficits or surpluses should be gauged from economic forecasts, will hardly \nsatisfy after the complete failure of the profession to anticipate the 2008 Great Recession.

It is this part of the business that \ninvestors are counting on for the fastest growth.\n\nPerform owns some of the world's most popular sport websites, such as Goal.com, and its video player is used by \nhundreds of media groups including The New York Times and Mail Online.\n\nUnlike others such as BSkyB and BT that fight expensive bidding wars over the rights to top sports events such as \nthe Champions League, Perform specialises in less glamorous events.\n\nThis strategy has allowed the company to secure online video rights to more than 17,000 events a year, typically \nthird-tier events in a range of sports including football, tennis and darts, as well as rights to show top-flight national \nmatches outside the home country.\n\nAccording to estimates from Jefferies, Perform will generate net income of \u00a317m and revenues of \u00a3214m in 2013, \nwith 40 per cent of sales coming from its \"watch and bet\" service for online bookmakers.\n\nBy showing live videos, bookmakers seek to boost the appeal of in-play gambling, which allows people to place \nreal-time bets on events such as the identity of the next goal scorer.\n\nhttp://www.samuelbrittan.co.uk/\n\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;During its renegotiations, Perform is offering new contracts that involve a more complicated payment structure \nthan the existing ones. Under the new contracts, licensees will pay a minimum annual fee for a certain amount of \ncontent but must pay extra to use Perform's full repertoire of videos.\n\nOliver Slipper and Simon Denyer, joint chief executive officers of Perform, told the Financial Times that the \nnegotiations were progressing well, though they declined to say how many of the 45 existing licensees had entered \ninto new deals.\n\n\"We're confident of growing the licensee number, if not at day one, certainly over the course of 2014 and to \ncontinue to grow that licensee number into 2015 and 2016,\" says Mr Slipper.\n\nHe predicted that in each of the next three years, Perform would be able to grow both the number of bookmakers \nwho buy \"watch and bet\" as well as the overall revenues from the service.\n\nBut what the executives are particularly excited about is the potential for growth in advertising revenues from their \nconsumer-facing businesses over 2014, especially Goal, which was acquired for $30m in 2011.\n\nIn anticipation of the World Cup, Perform has made big investments to grow Goal. The football news site now has \n36 local editions in 17 languages, employs 530 journalists around the world, and ranks as the world's third biggest \nsports site by unique visitors after ESPN and Yahoo Sports.\n\n\"If you want to reach a global soccer audience through a single buying point, Goal is pretty much the only player in \ntown,\" says Mr Slipper, predicting a surge in advertising revenues in 2014.\n\nBT has bought prominent adverts on Goal's UK edition this year to promote its own sports content. BSkyB has also \nbought ads on the site.\n\nBut 2014 will be \"the first true year of seeing how well Goal performs\", says Mr Denyer. \"We're already at over 40m \n[monthly unique] users and we think the World Cup will drive us well north of the 50m mark.\"\n\nOpta, a sports data company that Perform bought in July for \u00a340m, will also play an important role during the World \nCup. It will be tracking every pass, goal and tackle in the competition, adding to its archive of games going back to \nwhen England won the tournament in 1966.\n\nAnalysts are forecasting that Perform will be able to grow its adjusted earnings at a compound annual rate of 30 per \ncent over the next three years. If successful, that would make Perform one of the fastest-growing companies on the \nLondon Stock Exchange.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Few countries will feel the impact of a possible Iranian reintegration with the world economy more than \nTurkey, whose relations with Tehran had grown more difficult in recent years.\n\nAnkara had been repositioning itself to overcome tension with Tehran even before Sunday's agreement, which \noffered partial sanctions relief in return for curbs on the Iranian nuclear programme. In the aftermath of the deal top \nTurkish officials were quick to issue enthusiastic prognoses on economic and political ties.\n\n\"It is now time for co-operation,\" declared Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, on a trip to Tehran this \nweek. \"The dialogue between Iran and Turkey is the most important in the region.\"\n\n\n\nBut this rhetoric could be racing ahead of reality as Turkey focuses on the economic opportunity in a country that \nhas suffered from an intensive sanctions regime likely to remain in place until a final agreement on Tehran's nuclear \nprogramme is reached.\n\nThe day after the Geneva announcement, Taner Yildiz, Turkey's energy minister, predicted that if sanctions were \ndropped, Turkey would be able to increase oil imports from Iran from 105,000 barrels per day to from 130,000 to \n140,000.\n\nThe deal may have a more immediate impact however. When the US in late 2011 passed sanctions legislation \ntargeting third countries' purchases of Iranian oil, energy-poor Turkey, which that year obtained 51 per cent of its \ncrude from Iran, was in the eye of the storm.\n\nThe sanctions targeted the banks that handled payments for Iranian oil sales rather than the energy groups that \nimported the oil itself.\n\nTo win six-month waivers from the legislation, Turkey had to implement successive reductions in its purchases from \nTehran, bringing Iran's share of its total oil imports down to 39 per cent by last year.\n\nSome executives suggest that in the aftermath of the nuclear deal, Ankara may not have to make further reductions \nto win future waivers.\n\nIn an apparent confirmation of this, Zafer Caglayan, the economy minister, said on Thursday that all Turkish banks \nwould now be able to carry out bank transactions with Iran.\n\nBecause Iranian oil is bought with Turkish lira rather than dollars, a boost in oil imports from Tehran would relieve \npressure on the Turkish currency. Iranian oil that is cheaper than alternative sources could also help reduce \nTurkey's large current account deficit, often identified as its biggest economic weak spot.\n\nMr Caglayan is hoping for an increase in Turkish exports to Iran that would help whittle down the deficit. \"I hope we \nare going to make the most of these next six months,\" he declared, referring to the duration of the interim deal.\n\nTurkey's total exports for the first nine months of this year were worth $3.4bn, compared with $9bn over the same \nperiod in 2012, a drop that the minister blamed on US sanctions. Many economists say, however, that exports were \nparticularly high in 2012 due to an increase in Turkish gold sales to Iran that was both unlikely to be repeated and of \nlittle value to the rest of the Turkish economy.\n\nDespite the economic possibilities the nuclear deal presents, the mutual suspicion that has recently dogged \nAnkara's relations with Tehran will be hard to dispel.\n\nTension between Sunni-majority Turkey and Shia Iran have been mounting since Ankara agreed in 2011 to house a \nNato missile defence radar base alliance officials say is intended to counter threats from Tehran.\n\nThe uprisings in the Arab world - and the Syrian war in particular - have increased sectarian tension in the region. \nTurkey backs the largely Sunni Syrian rebels, many of whom have found refuge on its territory, while Tehran \nprovides the Assad regime with weapons, supplies and military support.\n\nDuring a visit to Tehran this week Mr Davutoglu said he and Mohammad Javad Zarif, his Iranian counterpart, were \n\"of the same mind\" that the region needed \"calm and a relative truce\" ahead of a peace conference on Syria early \nnext year, although Turkey had previously signalled deep scepticism about the conference's prospects.\n\nHassan Rouhani, Iran's president, is due to visit Turkey in mid-December; meanwhile Recep Tayyip Erdogan, \nTurkey's prime minister, is scheduled next month to visit Iraq, the region's other Shia power.\n\nThe visits appear to be part of a new effort by Ankara to insulate relations with its neighbours from the fallout from \nthe war in Syria. It is a drive that gains fresh impetus from the outcome in Geneva.\n\n\n\nSinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat now with Carnegie Europe, highlights the difficulty of reconciliation on this \nissue. \"Turkey is adamant that there cannot be a solution for Syria as long as [President Bashar al-] Assad is in \npower, while Iran continues to support the Assad regime,\" he says. \"The distance between them is still too far to be \nbridged just on account of the nuclear deal.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

This delightfully eccentric event \ncombines dinnertime with showtime, feeding the audience morsels of food and food for thought simultaneously, as \nit explores our complex and often contrary attitude to what we eat.\n\nAfter a slightly nerve-tingling wait in a neon-lit antechamber, testing out curious, fluorescent (and oddly flavoured) \naperitifs, we are ushered into a dining room. Here a meal, conventional in structure (soup, main course, sweet) but \nnot always in content, is served. Meanwhile, the show, a form of cabaret (written by April De Angelis and Nessah \nMuthy), plays out around the diners, switching from mini-dramas at the spare tables, to songs (by Alasdair Macrae) \nand speeches that spin off from the comestibles on the table to the politics of producing them.\n\nThe religious and cultural significance of breaking bread together, for instance, is observed through a playful \nceremony that reminds us how long human beings have been baking bread and that the word \"companion\" means \n\"those with whom we share bread\". But the feelgood factor dissipates slightly when we are advised exactly what \ngoes into a processed loaf.\n\nThere's a course that neatly questions the way we approach what we are about to eat by serving foodstuffs that are \nnot what they seem and another that tests the limits of what we consider edible. Meanwhile, the setting becomes \nincreasingly surreal as a bidding war for a cup of coffee touches on the potential impact of future food shortages.\n\nIt's a genial atmosphere and you can taste or not taste as you wish. But without aggression, it foregrounds the \nprivilege of being able to order as you please. Sugar, supermarkets, mass production, factory farming, exploited \nworkers, food banks, body image, obesity and anorexia are all on the menu.\n\nThe format does restrict it somewhat, meaning it can't investigate any of these lines of inquiry in real depth or detail: \nas with many a dish, it might have been better - and more challenging - with fewer ingredients. And some of the \nmini-dramas work better than others, with characterisation and arguments being rather obvious in places. But \nultimately Gastronauts is an ingenious show that manages to be both fun and sobering, performed with \nmischievous style by the cast (Macrae, Andy Clark, Imogen Doel, Nathaniel Martello-White and Justine Mitchell) \nand whisked together deftly by director Wils Wilson.\n\nroyalcourttheatre.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The setting, ornate and decorative, makes \nno attempt to divine deeper meaning or draw contemporary relevance. Prima la musica: it's the drama and emotion \nwritten into the score that occupies centre ground. Compare that with any number of Verdi bicentenary stagings \nnorth of the Alps during the past 12 months, the Royal Opera's over-interpreted Les V\u00eapres siciliennes  among \nthem.\n\nItalian theatres have remained largely immune to \"director's opera\" - a blessing or curse, depending on taste - but \nthey are heir to a tradition that, in the right circumstances, exudes a grandeur and sense of ownership unmatched \nelsewhere. Such is the case with Rome's new Ernani, the last of four Verdi operas Riccardo Muti has curated in the \nItalian capital since last November. When Muti left La Scala in 2005, no one - least of all the conductor himself - \ncould have predicted he would pick up in Rome the work he left off in Milan. The atmosphere at the Teatro \n\n\n\ndell'Opera, where he now holds the title of \"honorary conductor for life\", may not have the fraught excitement of a \nprima in Milan, but his music-making has gained a warmth, a generosity, a humanity that were seldom evident at La \nScala.\n\nThe old disciplines - the long-term schooling of singers, the popular lectures from the piano, the fidelity to the written \nscore (no interpolated high notes) - are now distilled through age and experience. What comes across most \nstrikingly in this Ernani is how softly and subtly the Rome orchestra plays, how majestically the choral tableaux \nunfold (with an encore for the patriotic hymn in Act Three), and how moderated Muti's once-fierce gestures have \nbecome. All this bespeaks a rare harmony between conductor and ensemble.\n\nVerdi's fifth opera, his first with a libretto by Piave, has been a Muti speciality since he opened the Scala season \nwith it 31 years ago. His Rome cast offers less star quality than in 1982, when he had Domingo, Freni, Ghiaurov \nand Bruson at his disposal - but it is scarcely less accomplished. In the title role, Francesco Meli confirms his \nreputation as one of the most promising younger-generation Italian tenors - secure at the top, stylishly phrased, \nalbeit with a timbre more metallic than melting. Luca Salsi's Carlo has stage presence and a suave baritone, while \nIldar Abdrazakov lends dignity, if little menace, to the villainous bass role of Silva.\n\nThe most personable singing comes from Tatiana Serjan: her delicate, intensely felt Elvira sets Verdi's dramatic \ncoloratura on fire and brings Hugo de Ana's stone-courtyard staging to life. A treat for traditionalists, yes, but above \nall a triumph for Verdi.\n\noperaroma.it\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Richard Rowley's documentary zones in on the alleged rogue \natrocities of America's paramilitary special force JSOC (Joint Special Operations Command), accused of slaying \ninnocent kids and families, from Afghanistan to Somalia, when not taking applause for killing Osama bin Laden. We \nshould be shocked. But the camera is too busy making a hero of reporter-presenter Jeremy Scahill.

Brian De Palma's film of Stephen King's telekinesis chiller said and did it all 37 years \nago: blood, prom night and Sissy Spacek duelling to the death with crazy religious mum Piper Laurie. Chlo\u00eb Grace \nMoretz and Julianne Moore are good without erasing memories of predecessors. (Weirdly they each look like their \nopposite forebears. Moretz replicates Laurie's pixie-featured Medusa gaze while Moore does the Spacek flayed-\nskull look.) More sensitivity of characterisation is offered in this version, directed by Kimberly Boys Don't Cry Peirce. \nBut sensitivity in a horror film, we know, is just the lamb being readied for the designer slaughter.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The \ncamera seems to have declared independence from human agency, romping about lawless and self-willed. Life on \nand around a trawler is observed from every angle, some horrendous. We are on the catchment deck lens-deep in \nslithery seafood; we are underwater with live fish or galaxy-like explosions of flushed-back waste (starfish the stars \nof this show); we bob like a cork between sea and air, gazing up as preying seagull armies darken the sky.\n\nOn board, the beefy tattooed New Bedford trawlermen slice stingrays, knife scallops from shells or sometimes just \nsit in a doze before the TV. Hilariously the main programme, only heard, sounds like a trawler documentary: one of \nthe wordy, intoning, reverencing kind.\n\n\n\nIn Leviathan there are no words at all - save barely audible shouts or murmurs among the working crew - and \nreverence has gone straight to hell. Herman Melville meets Jackson Pollock in a sea hymn gone feral-expressionist. \nThe phrase \"in your face\" does scant justice to the hideous intimacy with which headless or eye-popping fish swirl \naround us, or the graphic unremittingness with which we endure the slappings and buffetings of live sea and live \nseafood. (The sound design is brilliant throughout.) What does this strange, surreal film amount to? What does it \nmean and cinematically portend? Perhaps a new Martian school of documentary: one in which we are offered a \ngaze as if from another planet at the bizarre, grisly, sometimes perversely beautiful doings we take for granted on \nour own planet.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Think of the sheeny glow in which \nthe French director has previously presented tales of love, sex, sin or coming of age. Swimming Pool; 5x2; Angel; In \nthe House.\n\nThe new Ozon has been attacked for prettifying sex work, or glossing over its grimmer features. The beautiful 17-\nyear-old Sorbonne student (Marine Vacth, like a young French Julia Roberts) chucks her virginity away one night on \na beach, then starts selling love-by-appointment to men of all ages. Belle de jour; belle de soir. When the parents \nfind out - \"My own daughter disgusts me!\" mum cries - their ballistic vociferations make little more impression on \nIsabelle than the serenely accepted raids on her sexual innocence that caused them.\n\nOzon has cosmeticised commercial sex, say the film's critics. But the heroine's anomie - her seeming untouchability \neven when being touched all over - is surely the point. She is a shop-window human being in a shop-window \nsociety, or in danger of becoming one. Blame the parents; blame the culture; blame the glossy beatitudes of the \nmedia and the internet, fanning out alternative lifestyles, moral or amoral, like a multicoloured pack of cards. \"Pick a \nlife, any life. Make it yours. Make it a statement of you . . . \" The impassivity of the movie's surface bespeaks the \ndepth of the movie's perception. At the end there is a Charlotte Rampling cameo. (Every Ozon film should have \none.) It is piquant, disconcerting, graceful, enigmatic, implacable - and just a little scary. Exactly like this film.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The film warms \nour hearts and senses without insulting our intelligence. Starrily acted, smartly scripted, astutely funny about \nHollywood and its ways, it is the best Disney film in retrievable memory.\n\nIt's also a tale from Disney's own archives. Tom Hanks presents Walt himself as a master schmoozer and huckster \n- moustache, salesman grin, avuncular Midwest twang - trying to persuade stubborn Anglo-Australian novelist P.L. \nTravers (Emma Thompson) to let Mary Poppins, her medium-dark kiddy bestseller, become, well, what it became. \nDancing cartoon penguins. Dick Van Dyke doing history's weirdest cockney accent. And Julie Andrews trilling those \ncatchable Sherman Brothers songs. \"A Spoonful of Sugar\", \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\" \n\nTravers fought but lost her battle. The film was made, not her way. Perhaps, though, hints the film, she was happy \nto lose. A lovable screen perennial was made from a book that Disney - and/or his psychology experts - sussed out \nas a disguised essay in bruised autobiography. Cue the flashbacks to sun-rinsed Australia, where Travers grew up \nidolising her whimsical, storytelling, drunken father (Colin Farrell), whose ill-fated end came despite the primly \ninterventionist carer role played by the Aunt (Rachel Griffiths) who was, the film and we infer, Poppins's forebear.\n\nFor Mouseco, this is an ingeniously picked project. The home-sourced story is so shaped that everyone comes out \nsmelling medium-rosy or at least freshly picked from a freshly reimagined past: from Uncle Walt himself to the \nprickly pseudo-English author who speaks strictly in posh or insular mantras. \"Pot of tea, please\"; \"Where is the \ngravitas?\"; and more than once, to Disney's over-familiar \"Pamela\", \"Mrs Travers, please\".\n\n\n\nHooray for a role that allows Emma Thompson, crisp, characterful and at the close poignant, to make up for Nanny \nMcPhee. (Thousands loved it, I loathed it.) That the dream-chemistry double act depicted between Walt and P.L. \nactually happened is attested by a sneak voice-recording from the studio archives, played during the film's end \ncredits. (Stay to listen.) It proves what we always suspected. Art and entertainment were born to be at loggerheads. \nBut sometimes the best art and best entertainment come from the battles fought first, with each other, to survive.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Taylor Wimpey dropped 6.2 per cent to 107.4p \nand Redrow lost 5.2 per cent to 273.5p.\n\nMost analysts played down the direct effects, such as higher funding costs pushing up mortgage rates. Wholesale \nfunding costs barely budged and the mortgage market has been improving, with UBS noting that rates have fallen \n1.2 percentage points since the scheme was launched in 2012.\n\nMore surprising to traders was the BoE's hawkish tone, with the statement including suggestions of a cap on loan-\nto-value ratios and extra capital demands on banks writing risky loans.\n\nAnother concern was that the Bank's Financial Policy Committee might limit subsidies available through Help to \nBuy as part of its annual audit of the scheme.\n\nPersimmon, which slid 6.1 per cent to \u00a311.70, has said that 40 per cent of its reservations this year have used Help \nto Buy. Berkeley, whose London bias means it has not been as reliant on the scheme, outperformed with a 3 per \ncent decline to \u00a323.56.\n\nBuilders' merchants were also hit, with Travis Perkins down 2.7 per cent to \u00a317.83 and Howden off 1.5 per cent to \n322.1p. Kingfisher dropped 4.4 per cent to 378.6p after the B&Q owner's quarterly results showed a disappointing \nperformance in France, meaning retail trading profit missed expectations.\n\nWall Street's absence meant the wider market went nowhere, with the FTSE 100 closing 5 points higher at \n6,654.47.\n\nRio Tinto climbed 3.9 per cent to \u00a332.61 after mapping out a cheaper plan to expand production from its Pilbara iron \nore project, in part by deferring decisions on its capital intensive greenfield developments.\n\nAnglo American climbed 2.7 per cent to \u00a313.75 ahead of an investor strategy day on December 10, which raised \nthe question once more about whether new chief executive Mark Cutifani would look to separate the group's South \nAfrican and international operations. Credit Suisse was not hopeful.\n\n\"We expect no changes to previous cost cutting and returns targets and major questions / uncertainties will likely \nremain unanswered,\" it said. \"Could the new CEO finally be the person to restructure Anglo? Quite possible over \nthe medium term but unlikely in 2014 in our view with management focus more on operational turnaround.\"\n\nCairn Energy rose 2.4 per cent to 274.3p on the back of an upgrade from JP Morgan Cazenove. Offshore drilling \nnext year in Africa and Ireland was worth a theoretical maximum of 460p per share while a share buyback limited \ndownside in the event of failure, the broker argued.\n\n\"The current share price means the Moroccan exploration programme is a free option, in our view, and any success \nwould likely invert negative sentiment,\" it said.\n\nMarston's lost 7.4 per cent to 143.7p after announcing the sale of 202 pubs for \u00a390m, with the cash earmarked to \nredeem bonds. While investors welcomed Marston's accelerated strategy to invest in managed and franchised \n\n\n\npubs, there was a hit to near-term earnings as the disposed estate made a \u00a310.4m annual profit against a \u00a36.7m \ninterest payments saving from the bond buyback.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Retail profit fell 5.6 per cent to \u00a3140m, hit by an increase in promotions as the French market \nweakened.\n\n\"There is uncertainty in France. It is not getting better in the way that we think the UK is getting better,\" said Ian \nCheshire, chief executive. \"We can't see the forward indicators being positive [in France] that we can in the UK.\"\n\nThe shares closed down 4.4 per cent at 378.6p on Thursday.\n\nHowever, Mr Cheshire said that longer term, the problems in France could create opportunities for Kingfisher to pick \nup distressed rivals, in the way that it bought 27 stores from Focus DIY in the UK.\n\nThe French business was also hit by the absence of a \u00a34m benefit, which it enjoyed last year from the release of a \nbonus provision and \u00a32m of costs in preparation for store openings.\n\nIn the UK and Ireland, total sales rose 3.7 per cent to \u00a31.1bn, helped by a strong performance by Screwfix, and \nencouraging early signs in the smaller tradesman market, offset by slower retail sales at B&Q.\n\nB&Q's sales rose 0.8 per cent to \u00a3915m, while sales from stores open at least a year rose 0.4 per cent.\n\nSales at Screwfix rose 21.1 per cent to \u00a3180m, or 11.1 per cent on a like-for-like basis.\n\nMr Cheshire said that in the UK, demand from tradesmen was recovering more strongly than retail sales.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;\"The closer you are to the building trade, the stronger it is. I don't think [the retail sectors] are yet seeing a \nconsistent pick up,\" he said.\n\nHowever, there were some early indicators of improvement, such as stronger flooring sales.\n\nSales of outdoor seasonal products fell 8 per cent year on year, as Kingfisher sold more in the second quarter amid \nthe hot weather.\n\nOverall, group sales rose 4.6 per cent to \u00a32.9bn, helped by the performance of Kingfisher's other international \nmarkets.\n\nNevertheless, analysts at Oriel Securities cut their forecast of underlying pre-tax profit in the year to January from \n\u00a3750m to \u00a3740m and from \u00a3845m to \u00a3820m in the year to January 2015.\n\n\"Life is getting worse, not better for Kingfisher in France and with no signs yet of a pick-up in B&Q's trading, we are \ndowngrading again.

The four-month evidence review will \nbe led by Sir Cyril Chantler, an academic, doctor and NHS administrator.\n\nShares in Imperial Tobacco dropped 2 per cent while British American Tobacco lost nearly 1 per cent on the news. \nThe two multinationals only receive a fraction of their profits from the UK.\n\nThe prime minister's spokesman said there would be no similar reversal on minimum alcohol pricing, another public \nhealth policy that was abandoned earlier in the year. \"We have set out our approach on alcohol pricing earlier in the \nyear and there is no change there,\" he said.\n\nThe comments will damp the hopes of health campaigners after Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat Home Office \nminister, said this month that minimum pricing could be \"released from hold\".\n\nThere was speculation in parliament that the policy change on tobacco was a response to the tabling of \namendments by a cross-party group of peers to the children and families bill to introduce plain packaging.\n\n\"When the government said it wasn't ready to make a decision on standardised packaging of cigarettes the tobacco \nindustry thought it had killed it stone dead,\" said Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health.\n\n\"The government is to be congratulated for listening to parliamentarians from across the political spectrum in both \nthe Commons and the Lords and ignoring the industry.\"\n\nAs a result of the move, standardised packaging could be introduced before the end of this parliament in spring \n2015.\n\nThe move followed a similar about-turn on Monday over payday lenders when the government said it would \nintroduce a cap on interest rates charged by companies such as Wonga.\n\nThe coalition had been on track to introduce plain cigarette packaging earlier in the year but the legislation did not \nappear in the Queen's Speech in May which sets out new laws for the coming year.\n\nThat raised questions about the role of Lynton Crosby, the Tory elections supremo, whose lobbying company has \nadvised tobacco giant Philip Morris, in the decision. The government and Mr Crosby have denied any such \ninfluence.\n\nIn July, Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, said the government would wait until firm evidence was produced in \nAustralia, which last December became the first country to introduce standardised packaging.\n\nChris Wickham, an analyst at Oriel Securities, said that so far there appeared to have been \"no impact on market \ntrends\" in Australia, while Kingsley Wheaton, director of corporate affairs at BAT, warned that the Canberra ban had \nled to an \"increase in illicit trade\".\n\nNick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, said the government had an \"open mind\" on the review, but \"personally\" he \nhoped it would show that plain packaging was effective.\n\nMark Littlewood, director-general of the rightwing Institute of Economic Affairs, warned that plain packets would \nhave a \"negligible\" impact on health, but would boost the black market and do \"enormous harm\" to small \nbusinesses.\n\n\"In the words of David Cameron, let's treat adults like adults and give them more responsibility over their own \nlives,\" he said.\n\n\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Tall and \ndapper in a dark sports jacket and bright red tie, he points to a building across the playground: \"That was built for \n400 pupils, now there are 700 pupils in it. There are too many children . . . there are so many people here.\"\n\nThere is a quiet serenity in the school, a jumble of Victorian, 1930s and 1980s buildings. But when lessons are \nover, he says, it will be \"like an ants' nest\".\n\nThe lyc\u00e9e, on a main road busy with thunderous traffic in Kensington, is comparable to a medium-sized business. In \naddition to the 3,000 pupils on this prime piece of land,  another 1,000 students are taught at three primary schools \nin nearby Ealing, Clapham and Fulham, which are under Mr Rauch's control. The schools employ 493 staff, of \nwhich 303 are teachers.\n\nHe is unfazed by the number of people he oversees. In Morocco, where he was head of another French lyc\u00e9e, he \nwas responsible for 7,500. The scale means that he is unable to identify all his charges. \"We know the few who \nhave problems, the ones who are really brilliant but the average [pupil], no.\"\n\nCatering to children aged four to 18, the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Charles de Gaulle de Londres - its full name - was founded \nin 1915 to provide a French education for French and Belgian refugees. Its alumni include Dominic Grieve, the \nConservative attorney-general, and Mika, the pop singer.\n\nThe school follows the prescribed curriculum issued by the French ministry of education. At the Kensington site the \nteaching is entirely in French, although at the age of 14 pupils can choose to follow the English exam system rather \nthan the French.\n\nThe lyc\u00e9e's curriculum is overseen by the French education ministry - the request to interview Mr Rauch had to be \napproved by the French embassy first.\n\nDemand for places is tight. The French community in London is thriving - the consulate estimates the number is \n300,000 and claims the British capital is the sixth-largest French city in the world. Most relocate for work, and bring \ntheir young families.\n\nThere has been a growth in the number of private schools and nurseries catering to French families in the UK. \nPhilippe Fraser, who has set up three French nurseries in London, says that a large number of his clients are \nFrench bankers.\n\nAt the lyc\u00e9e, priority is given to the children of French civil servants and those who have attended French schools \noverseas. Mr Rauch says that his pupils are not the offspring of the affluent fleeing the high taxes set to be imposed \non high-earners by Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the socialist French president, who came to power last year. In fact, he says, \na sizeable proportion are given financial assistance by the government. \"We have 400 families who get grants, \nsingle-parents, many kind of pupils.\"\n\nFees for the lyc\u00e9e are about \u00a36,000 to \u00a311,000 a year - cheaper than the typical UK private school. According to \nthe Independent Schools Council's latest annual census, fees at British private schools increased 3.9 per cent in \n2012-13 to an average of \u00a314,295.\n\nMr Rauch thinks that if parents thought it would be possible to bribe him, some would try. \"In Morocco I had this \nproblem,\" he says. The biggest gift a parent tried to give him was a Rolex. What did he do? \"I refused and phoned \nthe embassy. It's important to be clear,\" he says.\n\nOnly 5 per cent of his pupils are children of British nationals. Once a school popular with Francophile parents \n(\"British people were very keen on French culture - Nouvelle Vague, avant-garde cinema, the French Institute. It \nwas very attractive\"), few apply today because they realise success is remote.\n\n\n\nOver at the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de New York, Sean Lynch, the headteacher, says that the American families who apply \nto his school are \"attracted to the French reputation for academic excellence\". He points out that the \"experience of \nstudying in a bilingual environment is a gateway for our students to learn additional languages more readily\".\n\nMr Rauch disputes the characterisation of French children as impeccably behaved, depicted by foreign authors in \nbooks such as French Children Don't Throw Food  and Why French Children Don't Talk Back.\n\nThe 58-year-old, who took up the post in the London school just over a year ago, is also bemused by the British \n\"obsession\" with school rankings.\n\n\"It is not the French way,\" he smiles. However, he has observed that French parents living in Britain have picked up \nthe national preoccupation.\n\nAccording to Ofsted, the UK education standards regulator, almost all pupils in the French section gain the \nBaccalaur\u00e9at and \"an exceptionally high proportion gain a higher level 'Mention tr\u00e8s bien'\".\n\nHe ponders the value of school rankings. \"What does 'good ranking' mean? You teach well? Maybe. I am very \nsuspicious of these rankings.\"\n\nOn balance, he thinks rankings are meaningless. \"The only important thing is to keep our children and give the best \nwe can. If you keep some children and feel they are suffering you have to help them learn some things and help \nthem find their position in future life. That is our aim, not to get a good ranking.\"\n\nPastoral duty is not typically attributed to French schooling. Peter Gumbel, a British lecturer at Paris's Institute of \nPolitical Science, wrote a critique of the French education system, On ach\u00e8ve bien les \u00e9coliers (\"They Shoot \nSchoolkids, Don't They?\"), published in 2010.  In it he wrote that the French education system focused \"so narrowly \non the transmission of knowledge that it has ignored that other key function of school: to build character and \npersonality\".\n\nMeanwhile, Claudia Senik, professor at the Paris School of Economics and Paris-Sorbonne University , suggested \nthis year that the schooling system was making the French unhappy. She wrote: \"Obviously this system is not \ncreating self-confidence or self-esteem in our children.\"\n\nMr Rauch concedes that there are faults with the centralised French system, primarily that it is \"system-oriented\" \nrather than \"child-oriented\". He says: \"The French system is stricter, it gives less opportunities to children to be \ncreative. It's very academic. We have many exams.\"\n\nIn New York, Mr Lynch says parents like the combination of a \"rigorous French academic programme that \nchallenges their children to think critically and work hard\" and \"American\" elements, \"such as the nurturing of our \nstudents' creativity, inventiveness and sense of self\".\n\nThe Lyon-born Mr Rauch is one of seven teaching staff who live on the premises, thereby saving him from trying to \nfind a home in one of the country's prime property hotspots.\n\n\"It is easy to be at work first and leave work the last,\" he says.\n\nThe job demands a person who is \"not too nervous or anxious\". It is important, the headteacher says, \"to get time to \nthink and have good answers for all the many problems\". There is, he says, the potential \"for many people to get on \nour nerves\".\n\nThe biggest irritant is the problem parents, says Mr Rauch. Every year he expects about 30 to 40 who will be angry \nover their child's academic failings. He shrugs it off, insisting that, largely, parents are a \"real support\".\n\nThe best part of his job, he insists, is the opportunity to \"grow children's minds\".\n\n\n\nMost of the history and geology graduate's career has been spent in schools in French Territories, including \nMorocco and French Polynesia. He enjoys living in London and    has no desire to teach in his homeland, where he \nsays parts of some big cities have become problematic for teachers.\n\nDid he like school as a child? \"Yes.\" He pauses. \"Not too much.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Lafarge, a world leader in the unglamorous \nbusiness of cement, aggregates and concrete, spends EUR120m a year on developing new ways of using these \ngritty materials. It says its R&D centre just outside Lyon is the world's biggest research facility for construction \nmaterials.\n\nFrance has a long tradition in concrete. Modern cement, the essential ingredient, was invented by the French and \nBritish 200 years ago; a pioneer of reinforced concrete was Joseph Monier, a 19th-century French gardener who \nwanted to make stronger flowerpots; Le Corbusier was a trailblazer of \"brutalist\" architecture using concrete.\n\nMany countries - those that suffer from earthquakes, for example - appreciate the robust qualities of concrete. But it \nhas to battle against rival materials. \"We need to compete with wood, steel and brick and show that we can have \ngood results,\" says Mr Lafont.\n\nDeveloping \"ultra high-performance\" concrete - dense, fibre-reinforced and smooth-surfaced - of the type used by \narchitect Rudy Ricciotti for MuCEM is a key task at Lyon.\n\nBut it is only one of a number of projects. In one workshop, engineers test cement-laced mud bricks being \ndeveloped for housebuilding in Malawi, where traditional burnt-clay bricks have been banned because making them \nis detrimental to the local environment.\n\nTests are under way on concrete made with biomass, which is four times lighter than concrete made with traditional \naggregates. Water-permeable road surfacing, self-levelling concrete and pollution-absorbing concrete for tunnels \nand car parks are all being worked on by Lafarge boffins.\n\n\"Concrete is a dumb material but there is lots of science behind it and that's why I love it,\" says Christophe L\u00e9vy, a \ndirector at the Lyon centre.\n\nMuch of the challenge is to reduce the environmental impact of concrete. Mr Lafont says construction overall (not \njust with concrete) accounts for 40 per cent of all carbon dioxide emissions: \"We are part of the problem, but we can \nbe part of the solution.\"\n\n\n\nA core issue is reducing the energy used in making cement by firing limestone and clay at 2000C. Cement remains \nessential to making concrete. \"Nobody has found anything simpler or cheaper to glue stones together,\" says Mr \nLafont.\n\nNew processes, lower quantities of raw materials and recycling are all part of an effort by Lafarge to reduce carbon \nemissions per tonne of concrete by a third by 2020 compared with 1990 levels.\n\nThat way, concrete can compare favourably with other materials, Mr Lafont insists. And it can secure a broader \nreputation for making beautiful buildings, from small houses to soaring tower blocks - and cutting-edge museums.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Equity prices continued their steady grind higher and the yen plumbed fresh lows against the \ndollar and the euro, although the closure of US markets for Thanksgiving left European investors lacking a clear \nfocus.\n\nWall Street's advance on Thursday to record levels, following a broadly well-received batch of economic figures, \nhelped push Tokyo equities sharply higher. The Nikkei 225 rose 1.8 per cent to its highest close in nearly six years.\n\nEurope saw moderate follow-through buying, and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index gained 0.4 per cent. The FTSE All-\nWorld index was poised for its best finish since Christmas 2007.\n\nTokyo's strength was also a reflection of the yen's continued weakness, as carry traders continue to sell the low-\nyielding Japanese currency in order to fund purchases of higher-yielding assets.\n\nThe dollar touched a fresh six-month peak against the yen of Y102.37, while the euro touched Y139.18 - the \nhighest since June 2009. The single currency also climbed to a one-month high against the dollar of $1.3617, \nbefore easing back to trade 0.2 per cent higher at just above $1.36.\n\nThe euro has shown resilience in the wake of the unexpected recent cut in eurozone  interest rates, particularly \ngiven that the European Central Bank has come under pressure to be even more accommodative.\n\nThe ECB is due to hold a policy meeting next week.\n\n\"The cut in rates has not markedly relieved the pressure on the central bank to take additional action to support \nwhat remains a very fragile economic recovery and head off deflation,\" said Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics.\n\n\"[Consumer price inflation] is likely to remain a long way below the ECB's 2 per cent ceiling and there are good \nreasons to expect the downward trend to continue over the coming months. One of those is the disinflationary \ninfluence of the strong euro.\"\n\nAnalysts at Daiwa Capital Markets said that money supply data released on Thursday also illustrated why the \ncentral bank was likely to maintain its easing bias.\n\n\"M3 growth eased in October to 1.4 per cent, the weakest in two years and well below the rates of around 3.5 per \ncent that the ECB considers to be broadly consistent with its price stability objective,\" Daiwa said.\n\nAnalysts also highlighted the credit crunch being faced by companies, with loans to non-financial corporations \nfalling 3.7 per cent in the year to October.\n\n\"While we don't believe a new rate cut is imminent, ideas to take specific measures to boost credit growth - for \nexample a conditional longer-term refinancing operation mimicking the British Funding for Lending Scheme - will \nmost probably pop up again during the next meeting of the [ECB's] governing council.\"\n\n\n\nIndeed, the Funding for Lending Scheme was back in the spotlight on Thursday. The Bank of England said banks \nwould cease to receive subsidised funding to encourage mortgage lending and personal loans next year, in what \nanalysts said was an attempt to cool the UK housing market.\n\n\"While Bank of England governor Mark Carney said that the bank does not see an immediate threat to financial \nstability coming from the housing market, it is concerned about how matters could develop if action is not taken,\" \nsaid Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight.\n\n\"This is a hugely sensible and justifiable move taken by the Bank - even allowing for the fact that mortgage activity \nis still not that elevated compared to long-term average levels.\"\n\nSterling responded by climbing to an 11-month high against the dollar of $1.6380, although it subsequently edged \nback to $1.6340, up 0.3 per cent on the day.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year UK government bond fell 3 basis points to 2.74 per cent.\n\nIn the absence of any action in the US Treasury market, the German Bund yield edged 1bp lower to 1.70 per cent, \nin spite of stronger-than-expected German \"flash\" consumer price data and an improvement in the latest EC \neconomic sentiment survey.\n\nMeanwhile, gold edged up from a four-month low as the dollar suffered against the euro and sterling. The metal \nwas $7 higher at $1,243 an ounce.\n\nAmong industrial commodities, Brent oil slipped 30 cents to $110.01 a barrel, while copper finished unchanged on \nthe London Metal Exchange at $7,020 a tonne.

But \nthe party's efforts to enter government by building a new coalition have since been stymied by problems amid \nallegations that Mr Babis was an informant for Czechoslovakia's repressive StB secret police in the 1980s.\n\nIf true, the charges would exclude him from taking a job as a minister in any new government, and Ano could \nfracture. Czech law forbids former StB agents from government posts, and Milos Zeman, the Czech president, has \nsaid he will not appoint people without a clean record from the communist past. \n\nThe allegations emerged in newspaper reports in neighbouring Slovakia during the election campaign, but still did \nnot prevent Ano - which ran on a pro-business, low-tax platform - from taking 18.5 per cent of the vote. That placed \nit behind the Social Democrats, who garnered 20.5 per cent and whose leader, Bohuslav Sobotka, was last week \ngiven the task of cobbling together a majority coalition.\n\nArchives kept by Slovakia's Nation's Memory Institute allege that Mr Babis, who was a member of the Communist \nparty, met with the StB in the early 1980s and later became an agent, using the code-name \"Bures\", informing for \npolice on his co-workers in the fertiliser business in an operation named Oko, or \"Eye\". However, parts of the secret \npolice files have been shredded.\n\n\n\nMr Babis, 59, denies the reports, and is suing the institute, insisting he was registered by the StB without his \nknowledge.\n\n\"I legally defend myself against the accusation that I co-operated with the communist secret police,\" Mr Babis told \nthe Financial Times in an email exchange. \"The Secret Police (StB) kept a file that I didn't know about and there is \nnot even my signature in this file.\"\n\nMr Babis, an ethnic Slovak who speaks Czech with an accent, admitted that he had met with StB agents because \nhe was working for a foreign trading company importing phosphates to Czechoslovakia, but says he did not inform \non anyone.\n\nThe Institute says it is confident of its records. \"There is generally a low probability that the pieces of evidence were \nfabricated as they exist in three files independent from each other,\" Ondrej Krajnak, the Institute's head, told the \nCTK Czech news agency.\n\nThe allegations haunting Mr Babis add another element of uncertainty to a Czech political landscape that has been \nshaken by the recent collapse of the centre-right government of Petr Necas in a sex, spying and bribery scandal. \nThe political uncertainty is weighing on the country as it struggles to emerge from a record-long recession.\n\nOne of the more surprising elements of the Babis affair may be how little ordinary Czechs seem to care about it. If \nanything, Ano continues to gain in local opinion polls.\n\nJiri Pehe, a Prague-based political scientist, said the allegations \"don't cause strong emotions here\" because there \nwere relatively few dissidents in communist times, with the exception of a tiny but hardy group gathered around \nformer president V\u00e1clav Havel. Most ordinary people accommodated themselves to the system, he added.\n\nCzechs voters seem more animated by the antics of the current political class. Mr Babis built Ano as a response to \nthe frequent corruption scandals swirling through Czech politics, saying that the country's leadership had become \ndominated by \"godfathers\" linked to lobby groups.\n\nThe outcome of the October vote saw no party take an outright majority, in part because established parties lost \nmuch of their credibility. In fact, no government can be created without at least three political parties. Mr Sobotka is \nexpected to tap Ano and the smaller centrist Christian Democrats in his attempt to form a coalition. There are \nalready fissures between the three potential partners over whether the so-called \"lustration\" law preventing former \nspies from serving in government should be scrapped or not.\n\nMr Babis had wanted to be finance minister, which would allow him to push his low-tax policies in a government led \nby the left-leaning Social Democrats. But if the law is not changed he may be content to put in a proxy from his \nparty.\n\n\"If the president insists on my certificate of innocence, I don\u00b4t have to be in the government,\" said Mr Babis. \"I am \nexcluded from the society only because somebody kept a falsified record. There is no evidence about my conscious \nco-operation with StB. And my conscience is clear.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

That bested \nSaputo's last offer of A$9.20 a share.\n\nThat is for a company that last year reported sales of A$497m and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and \namortisation of A$25.5m.\n\nWarrnambool's board, having earlier backed Saputo's offer with enthusiasm, said on Thursday it would consider \nMG's new bid and advise shareholders of its recommendation in future.\n\nMG's latest bid is almost double what the farmer's mutual offered when it kicked off this saga in 2009. Back then, \nWarrnambool issued fresh stock to Bega Cheese, which became a white knight taking 15 per cent of its smaller \nrival and protecting its independence for a time.\n\nBut it was Bega that sparked this year's battle for the whole company by launching a cash and shares offer for the \ngroup valued at A$5.78 a share in September. At an enterprise value of $400m, that bid put Warrnambool on a \nmultiple of 15.7 times last year's earnings, which was already racy by historical standards.\n\nBega has since sat back to watch Saputo and MG battle it out at ever higher prices, but that first bid led \nWarrnambool to commission KPMG for an independent value report, which said it was worth between A$7.00 and \nA$7.50 a share.\n\nChina Mengniu's offer this year for Yashilli, a Chinese company that gets all its milk from New Zealand, was at a \nmultiple of 14 times last year's earnings, according to analysis from Dealogic. Last year, Danone's deal for a 38 per \ncent stake in a Moroccan dairy and the takeover of Robert Wiseman in the UK by Germany's Theo Mueller, were at \nsimilar or lower multiples.\n\nHowever, Lactalis Group of France did pay multiples of more than 20 times for parts of Parmalat of Italy in 2011.\n\nThe comparison for Warrnambool may be slightly unfair - its earnings were lower last year than the financial years \n2012 and 2011, when it reported A$35.5m and A$45.5m, respectively. Next year's earnings are forecast to be as \nhigh as A$50m, which would cut the bid multiple in half.\n\nA banker following the deal says there is some scepticism about that forecast as it rests on punchy assumptions \nabout sales of new products. Warrnambool has signed a technology licensing deal with Tatua of New Zealand that \nwill help it extract lactoferrin, a key ingredient in the production of premium infant milk formula.\n\n\"Don't underestimate the Lactoferrin opportunity,\" the banker says. \"Many companies are looking to diversify their \nsupplies away from Fonterra [New Zealand's mammoth farmer's co-operative].\"\n\nMr Topy questions the value of Warrnambool to MG, which is most interested in creating an Australian champion \nthat can challenge Fonterra. He says MG could build the factory that Warrnambool has for half the cost of its bid.\n\nHowever, Michael Harvey, industry analyst at Rabobank in Sydney, says that is the wrong way to think about it. \n\"Sure, you can build a factory, but it's about getting your hands on the raw material,\" he says. \"This all comes down \n\n\n\nto the growing strategic value of Australian food assets - we are producers of high quality milk in a good place for \nexports into Asia.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Mr Smith quit as chief executive of the insurer's Ireland division, complaining \nhe had been made a \"fall guy\" for difficulties that have since come to light at the now crisis-hit operation.\n\nSince Mr Smith took on the additional responsibilities in September, RSA has warned it discovered \"accounting \nirregularities\" in Ireland and has had to strengthen the subsidiary's finances with an emergency cash injection.\n\nYet Mr Smith's recent appointment as \"group director, global brokers\" suggests RSA had confidence in him until \nrecently.\n\nEven so, officials at Ireland's central bank, which is probing the business, recently said they had flagged up \nconcerns about RSA's Irish unit at the end of August and have conducted eight on-site inspections on the insurer \nover the past two years.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;\"The Central Bank carried out an on-site review of claims cases in RSAII in August 2013. The Central Bank \nidentified an issue with regard to delays in increasing case reserves on large claims in a timely manner and this \ninformed the terms of an internal audit that RSAII had already scheduled in relation to the same area,\" the central \nbank said in a statement.\n\nHowever, RSA's initial statement earlier this month suggested the accounting irregularities in Ireland - the way it \nbooked large losses and recognised premium income - were identified during a routine internal audit by the \ncompany. People close to RSA said the regulator had only identified a potential problem with one claim in August.\n\nThese people said the regulator told the company that subsequently its overall claims review was \"satisfactory\".\n\nThe problems at RSA have also focused attention on the standard of financial regulation in Ireland, which has \nexperienced a banking crisis and the collapse of one of its biggest insurers over the past five years.\n\nOfficial reports on the causes of Ireland's financial crisis have strongly criticised the light touch and unco-ordinated \nnature of regulation by the central bank and the financial regulator in the years before the Irish crash.\n\nThese problems were highlighted in the insurance sector when Quinn Insurance, which was the jewel in the crown \nof businessman Sean Quinn's empire, became insolvent, and is forecast to cost taxpayers up to EUR1.65bn.\n\nSince then the central bank has embarked on a radical overhaul of regulation and hired hundreds of extra staff to \nimprove oversight of the financial services industry.\n\n\n\nThursday's strongly-worded statement from Mr Smith marks another setback for RSA as the insurer seeks to \nrestore investor confidence after discovering the accounting irregularities at its Irish arm.\n\nEamonn Flanagan, analyst at Shore Capital, said: \"RSA want to draw a line under all of this. But this is going to be \nin the public domain for longer than the company would have wanted.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Lord Blackwell, an \nexperienced businessman, banker and political adviser, looks set to replace outgoing chairman Sir Win Bischoff \nearly next year.\n\nLord Blackwell, 61, has been on the Lloyds board since June of last year.\n\nInvestors have been keen to see a heavyweight appointment to the role, communicating as much to senior \nindependent director Tony Watson, who conducted the search.\n\nThe Financial Times revealed in May that Sir Win, 72, was planning to announce his retirement. The bank has been \nconducting a search ever since but has taken its time, looking externally as well as internally, with the aim of finding \na successor by the time of Lloyds' annual shareholder meeting next spring.\n\nThe chairman's appointment comes at a crucial time for Lloyds. Though it is still 33 per cent owned by taxpayers, \nthe government would like to sell down its stake to zero by the time of the 2015 election. The bank's resurgent \nshare price - up 7 per cent over the past three months to 76.87p at Thursday's close - has convinced investment \nbankers that the next phase of the selldown, which could include a sale to retail investors, will happen early in the \nnew year.\n\nLord Blackwell is a former senior independent director of insurer Standard Life and was a non-executive of retailer \nDixons. A former McKinsey partner, he also has executive banking experience, as a development director at \nNatWest. He has a PhD in finance from Wharton University in the US. From 1995 to 1997, Lord Blackwell worked in \ngovernment as head of prime minister Sir John Major's policy unit. He was appointed a Tory life peer in 1997.\n\nLloyds declined to comment and said the process was ongoing.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Some 416 calls were made during the entire period to Mr Lowther-Pinkerton.\n\nCalls from the private wire line were also made to the unique voicemail messages of Neil Wallis, the former deputy \neditor of News of the World, and model Katie Price, prosecutors claimed.\n\n\n\nEarlier Richard Fitzgerald, a police officer, told the court there were a number of methods of hacking voicemail \naccounts in the late 1990s.\n\nJonathan Laidlaw QC, representing former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks, a defendant in the \ncase, showed Mr Fitzgerald newspaper articles dating from 1999 and put it to him that \"essentially there were \nfailures\" in the security systems of mobile phone service providers, which at the time were \"deficient\".\n\nThe jury were also shown a number of white boards with a series of words on them seized from the home and office \npremises of private detective Glenn Mulcaire, including from his shed.\n\nThe jury was read an extract from a statement from publicity agent Max Clifford, which said he had \"fallen out\" with \nAndy Coulson, the former editor of News of the World, in June 2005, about a client of Mr Clifford's.\n\nMr Coulson directed the News of the World to cease commercial arrangements with Mr Clifford, so he gave stories \nto rival publications, Mr Clifford said in his statement, which was read to the jury by prosecutors.\n\nThe eight defendants, including Mr Coulson and Ms Brooks, face a range of charges.

At the beginning of the last \ndecade Brussels waived restrictions on the transfer of sensitive information to US companies, provided that the \nrecipient signed up to privacy principles similar to those enshrined in EU law. But the revelation that much of this \ndata ends up in the hands of the US National Security Agency has led EU authorities to think again. In a report \npublished this week, the European Commission says it might suspend this so-called \"Safe Harbour\" agreement \nunless its concerns are addressed by the middle of next year.\n\nThe commission is right to object to a situation in which communications between American citizens ordinarily stay \nprivate but exchanges between Europeans are intercepted with impunity when they pass through US servers. \nEuropean governments may have received tip-offs as a result of US snooping. But that is no excuse for \nperpetuating a two-tier system that appears to circumvent national laws. If surveillance is necessary to the security \nof European states, it should be sanctioned by legislation. The US does not seem to have been imperilled by laws \nshielding its own citizens from eavesdroppers.\n\nA sense of fair play is not the only reason for the US to heed Brussels' complaints. Another is commercial self-\ninterest. The internet has enlarged the canvas of global commerce and stretched its threads across the frame of US \ninfrastructure. This strengthens American companies as various as Google and Goldman Sachs. Moratoriums on \ndata transfers, which have now been floated in the EU and Brazil, would put this at risk.\n\nTechnology giants such as Google could reshape their legal structures and retool their systems to keep data close \nto users and out of reach of foreign governments. But the additional cost could make marginal services \nunprofitable and choke off nimble start-ups that spur innovation. Businesses that depend on combining data from \nsources in different countries - for example, to facilitate cross-border transactions - would have to untangle complex \ntechnical and legal difficulties.\n\nAmerica's strongest reason for respecting foreigners' privacy is that, in the long term, it has little choice. The \ninternet - like the US financial and legal systems - plays an international role because it commands widespread \nconfidence. If foreigners no longer trust America to keep their secrets, they will take their data elsewhere.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Based on the retail prices index measure of \ninflation, this would have resulted in a 4 per cent increase in bills, according to chief executive Chris Loughlin.\n\nHowever, South West Water has said it will cancel the next price increase and instead seek to recoup lost revenues \nin the next five-year pricing period, which starts in 2015. Mr Loughlin said the decision, agreed with Ofwat, would \nhelp to smooth customer bills at a time of declining household incomes and would not penalise investors in the \nlong run.\n\n\"People want smooth and stable prices,\" he said on Thursday.\n\nCustomers of South West Water can also expect below-inflation increases beyond 2015, Mr Loughlin added. Full \ndetails of the pricing proposals for 2015-20 - from all water suppliers in England and Wales - will emerge in \nsubmissions to Ofwat on Monday.\n\nPennon's two-year price freeze commitment follows calls from Ofwat and the environment minister Owen Paterson \nfor water providers to rein in prices next year and deliver reductions in real terms in the following five years.\n\nSevern Trent has already confirmed that it is sticking to its commitment to keep price increases below inflation next \nyear, while United Utilities has said it will not impose planned price increases averaging 1.2 percentage points \nabove inflation.\n\nPre-tax profits at South West Water rose 7.6 per cent to \u00a387.3m in the six months to September 30. But a 29 per \ncent fall at Pennon's Viridor waste management business following a continuing squeeze on margins led to a more \nmodest 3.5 per cent rise in overall group pre-tax profits, to \u00a3111m.\n\nThe company, which ended the period with net debt of \u00a32.1bn, increased its interim dividend 7.2 per cent to 9.39p.\n\nShares in Pennon closed up 1 per cent, at 644.5p, on Thursday, leaving them up by nearly a tenth on the year.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

That has left only Moldova and Georgia ready \nto \"initial\" the texts of deals in Vilnius.\n\n\n\nThe summit, which opens in a rebuilt replica of the 15th-century Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania, must now \ntry to salvage hopes of a future deal with Ukraine and put a brave face on the limited success of the four-year-old \npartnership programme.\n\nRussia's strong-arm tactics towards ex-Soviet neighbours preparing to do EU deals have raised questions over the \nfuture of the Eastern Partnership - and caused tensions between older and newer EU members over how to \nrespond.\n\nWhen EU ambassadors met to prepare for the summit this week, west European envoys insisted the Vilnius \ndeclaration must contain no explicit promise of future EU membership to ex-Soviet countries such as Ukraine. One \nambassador from an ex-communist country upbraided colleagues for using wording similar to that which Brussels \nuses with north Africa.\n\n\"While we are drafting, Russia is acting,\" the ambassador said, according to two people in the room.\n\nThe Eastern Partnership aimed to implant European democratic values into countries beyond the EU's eastern \nborders, after 10 ex-communist countries from central Europe joined the union in 2004 and 2007. It offered \nagreements to six ex-Soviet republics similar to those given to central European states in the 1990s.\n\nPartner countries are offered tariff-free access to the EU single market - and vice versa - if they adopt large chunks \nof EU legislation.\n\nThat could stimulate big investment inflows, although partnership countries risk economic pain until they complete \nreforms needed to make their products competitive in the EU.\n\nSome critics say the programme made two big mistakes. It offered one-size-fits-all solutions to wildly differing \ncountries. And it assumed these countries' leaderships would embrace EU integration the way central Europe's \nreformist 1990s governments did.\n\n\"We would have eaten grass to rejoin Europe,\" one senior central European politician recalled this week. But many \nex-Soviet authoritarian elites today are mainly interested not in westernising their countries but in preserving their \npower and wealth.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;Other critics say the packages fell short, by omitting - because of western EU members' \"enlargement fatigue\" - \nany promise of eventual membership. Countries that did crave European integration questioned if their painful \nreforms would be adequately rewarded.\n\nEU officials also reckoned without Russia launching a rival integration project, a customs union of ex-Soviet states - \nincompatible with the EU's trade area - set to be deepened by 2015 into a \"Eurasian Economic Union\". Russia has \nused energy, trade and security pressures to deter ex-Soviet countries from EU deals.\n\nRadoslaw Sikorski, foreign minister of Poland, a driving force of the Eastern Partnership, says Moscow \"shifted the \ngoalposts\". In 2008, he suggests, President Vladimir Putin signalled Russia would not allow countries such as \nUkraine or Georgia to join Nato, but EU integration was not a problem.\n\nStefan F\u00fcle, EU commissioner for the partnership project, parried criticisms that the Kremlin had outmanoeuvred \nBrussels.\n\n\"We've worked with Ukraine for years on meeting their European aspirations. We have put forward the most \nambitious [offer] second to enlargement,\" Mr F\u00fcle said, adding the EU deals had \"huge transformative power\".\n\n\n\n\"Looking back I don't see anything we would do differently,\" he said.\n\nSome central European diplomats, however, say the EU should have been more aggressive and creative in offering \nincentives to Ukraine.\n\nThe senior central European politician said the EU approached Ukraine like a normal commercial and political \npartner, holding formal talks. Russia treated it \"like a spy operation\", with operatives in the local media and \nparliament, and special operations targeting individual Ukrainian oligarchs.\n\n&lt;&gt;\"We always had a much weaker hand than Russia. They have a unity of purpose, and a certain brutality,\" he \nsaid. \"This is a crucial operation for them.\"\n\nAnalysts suggest the EU must now find new ways of engaging with ex-Soviet republics and their citizens - offering \nvisa-free travel, reducing reliance on Russian energy, and helping civil society promote political reforms.\n\nPeter Havlik of the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies says the EU should work with Moscow on \nmaking the Eastern Partnership and Russia's customs union compatible.\n\nThat could lead ultimately to what both sides have proclaimed as a long-term goal of a free trade area \"from Lisbon \nto Vladivostok\" - with countries such as Ukraine an integral part, and big beneficiary.\n\nIt would require Brussels to engage with Moscow and Kiev's proposal of three-way talks - although with care. \"What \nhas to be avoided is the impression that the EU and Russia are negotiating over Ukraine's future,\" says Mr Havlik.\n\nSome suggest the EU must mature into a more hard-headed geopolitical player, with a clearer strategic grasp of its \naims in the former Soviet space.\n\n\"Brussels likes to think that because [the Eastern Partnership] is a civilisational project, it's not geopolitical,\" says \nJames Sherr of London's Chatham House think-tank. \"But of course it's geopolitical - and Moscow will always see it \nthat way.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Jan Cienski in Warsaw\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

This week US benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude fell to a five month low of \n$91.77 per barrel, almost $20 per barrel less than the global marker Brent.\n\nBut until recent months infrastructure constraints have made it costly to move oil from inland shale formations to the \ncountry's main refining hubs in Texas and Louisiana, limiting the benefits of low prices to the wider US economy. \nWith more oil now able to flow through pipelines, the Gulf Coast market is also diverging from Brent.\n\nOn Thursday Louisiana Light Sweet, the Gulf Coast benchmark, hit a low for the year of $95.30 per barrel. Its \ndiscount of $16.01 per barrel to Brent, was easily the highest on record in Reuters data going back twenty years. \nTraditionally LLS has traded at a premium to Brent, reflecting its superior quality and the cost of shipping to the US.\n\nThe low prices are a boon to Gulf Coast refiners which can pick up crudes at low local prices, and then sell refined \nproducts such as gasoline and diesel, which can be exported from the US freely, into the international market at \nhigh prices.\n\n\n\nAt around 3m barrels a day, exports of finished petroleum products from the US are running at three times the rate \nof eight years ago, according to US government data.\n\nImports to the Gulf Coast tend to be priced off local benchmarks including LLS and the Argus sour crude index, a \nbasket of four heavier Gulf Coast crudes. With Gulf Coast prices falling, exporters such as Saudi Arabia and \nVenezuela are receiving less revenue for their sales into the US.\n\nThe discounts of US crude show no sign of ebbing with oil inventories continuing to rise as production grows, and \nmany refineries remaining closed for maintenance.\n\n\"There is simply too much crude in the US,\" said Amrita Sen, an analyst at Energy Aspects. \"We keep expecting it \nto be soaked up as refineries return from maintenance, or barges distribute it around the country, but that has just \nnot happened. US prices have to keep falling.\"\n\nThat is causing problems for many oil traders. The spread between WTI and Brent is among the most popular \ntrades in the oil market and just a few months ago the consensus bet was for the two crudes to be trading close to \nparity by the end of the year.\n\nBrokers say many traders have been caught short by the sudden widening of the discount, forcing them to close out \npositions at a loss.\n\n\"Market activity is consistent with a bloodbath,\" said one. \"People are indiscriminately buying TI and selling Brent all \nthe way along the curve.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

BT hopes to further \nexpand the service through licensing deals with other major music labels, said a person familiar with the process.\n\nBT already has a music service on BT Vision that broadcasts individual songs and tracks. This deal will allow a \nlimited catalogue of Universal's albums to be added to the service.\n\nThe music service has been tested for the past two months and is expected to be announced in the next few days. \nIt will join a pay-TV platform already growing rapidly owing to the aggressive acquisition of sports rights such as \nPremier League and Champions League football.\n\nSeparately, BT has also signed up the rights to show NBA basketball on its sports channels. BT will show up to 200 \ngames per season for a sport that has been off air since last year.\n\nThere will be up to seven live games per week, including several magazine shows, weekly highlights and news \nprogrammes. BT did not say how much the multiyear agreement cost.\n\nSimon Green, head of BT Sport, said: \"The NBA is simply the best basketball in the world; it is fast moving, high \nscoring and includes some the world's most recognisable global sporting icons.\"\n\nLicensing music for new digital platforms has become an increasingly important source of revenues for Universal \nMusic and its two biggest rivals, Warner Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment.\n\nBT Music is available for \u00a33 per month for people who have subscribed to BT's TV platform. The service allows \nusers to create their own playlists, search for albums, singalong to karaoke tracks and watch concerts.\n\n\n\nThe catalogue of music licensed by the service includes Robbie Williams' new album Swings Both Ways, and the \nMercury prizewinning album Overgrown by James Blake.\n\nHowever, at present, BT Music has far less music than the 20m-plus tracks that have been licensed by Spotify and \nDeezer, rival digital music services that cost up to \u00a310 a month and can be accessed through mobile devices.\n\nA free version of Spotify includes advertising and can only be used on PCs.\n\nSpotify, which was this month valued at more than $4bn in its latest fundraising round, has more than 24m active \nusers and 6m paying subscribers.\n\nAdditional reporting by Robert Cookson\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Tens of thousands of jobs are being \ncreated this way.\n\n\n\nEconomic growth remains well below levels needed to generate significant numbers of private-sector jobs. The \neconomy shrank by 0.1 per cent in the third quarter and latest indicators have signalled continued low levels of \nconfidence and investment.\n\nThe government and the EU are predicting growth of about 1 per cent next year before reaching 1.7 per cent in \n2015 - a level that economists say is needed for a significant impact to be made on unemployment.\n\n\"France has done more than you read in the media, but certainly not enough,\" said Olli Rehn, the European \nCommission's economic chief, referring to labour reform efforts. \"I can't say whether the cup is half full or half \nempty.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

This battle is a tragic distraction. Because \nRussia's real enemies are growing stronger, more resistant and ever deadlier.\n\nRussia is gripped by an all powerful but grotesquely corrupt bureaucracy. No institution is more criminalised than its \npolice force and prison guards. On the streets, police turn a blind eye to escalating heroin sales for cash kickbacks; \nin the worst prisons, guards sell it themselves.\n\nCorrupt border posts keep Russia open to gigantic drug flows night and day. In the Siberian prison colonies, \nneedles are shared across barracks, much like after dark in the dingy underpasses leading to Moscow's \novercrowded and imperial railway stations.\n\nMr Putin has failed to protect Russia. The nation is gripped by a demonic vicious cycle. Heroin is fuelling it faster \nand faster. The number of needle users in Russia is now more than 1.6m. When Mr Putin first entered the Kremlin \nin 2000, fewer than 100,000 people in Russia were HIV positive. Today there are at least 1.2m, with estimates that \n5 per cent of all young people are now infected.\n\nDriving through the industrial cities of the Urals region into the dying villages of Siberia, you see this catastrophe \neverywhere. Drugs are bought in broad daylight. Homeless teenage junkies are everywhere. You can easily see \nwhy the World Bank estimates that, by 2020, Russia will be losing 20,000 people a month to Aids.\n\nRussia is in great, needless danger. This is a rich country committed to spending $755bn building up its military \nover the next decade. It may cost Moscow more than \u00a320bn alone to pay for its recent power play to stop Ukraine \ndeepening ties with the EU.\n\nBut this will do nothing to stop a new, virulent strain of HIV spreading through Siberia. Nor will it change the fact that \nby 2020 the number of HIV cases in Russia could surpass 5m. The infected population grew by 12 per cent last \nyear alone.\n\nThe country needs a strong leader, one who will fight its real enemies. It needs a leader who will line the roads with \nposters warning the nation, not a president in denial.\n\nMr Putin's war on imaginary enemies makes matters worse. His alliance with the Orthodox Church has shut down \nsex education in Russian schools. His ban on \"homosexual propaganda\" has criminalised even discussing gay sex \nwith teenagers. Anti-NGO laws have dealt a heavy blow to the charities fighting HIV.\n\nRussia needs a leader strong enough to break the cycle of corruption, heroin and HIV. A leader strong enough to \nbreak the criminalisation of the very agencies supposed to enforce the law - no matter the risks that they may pose \nto his power. A democratic leader whose praetorian guard will ruthlessly purge the police, not the opposition.\n\n\n\nMoscow is one of the richest cities in the world. Its ruling elite is an insulated and wealthy plutocracy disconnected \nfrom its empire. Even the bulk of the Russian opposition - hipsters, intellectuals and affluent activists - take no \ninterest in the plagues of the poor.\n\nThe underclass feels frightened and resentful. From the endless slab-like Soviet estates ringing the capital to the \nArctic mining colonies, both the hipsters and oligarchs that make up the Moscow establishment are despised as \ncallous and indifferent.\n\nRacist vigilantes are filling the void. Heroin suppliers like to work through impoverished central Asian migrants. This \nmeans the working-class accuse them of spreading drugs and disease. Race riots in Moscow are only the tip of an \niceberg. Popular vigilante groups clash and harass migrants nightly. Dozens more riots have broken out in the \nregions.\n\nIn the Urals rust belt Evgeny Roizman, the newly elected anti-Putin mayor of Yekaterinburg, runs a vigilante group \nthat attacks dealers, kidnaps addicts and locks them up in makeshift \"cold turkey\" camps.\n\nMr Putin claims not to use the internet. Even in the inner circle, nobody dares mention uncomfortable truths. This \nleader lives a lonely life of morning swims in the Olympic-sized empty pools beneath his palaces and evening ice \nhockey games against teams of bodyguards.\n\nIsolated and in denial, the president is in fact little aware of the heroin epidemic and the depths of criminalisation of \nhis bureaucracy. His henchmen are happy to keep him that way. It makes stealing billions from the Russian budget \na far easier task.\n\nThe writer is the author of 'Fragile Empire: How Russia Fell In And Out Of Love With Vladimir Putin'\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Our portfolio was not as good as it is \ntoday,\" said Mr King.\n\nSome of its toys, such as the robotic puppy Teksta, were added to the UK Toy Retailers Association's annual list of \n\"Christmas Dream Toys\". Mr King said 2014 would provide a \"substantially better result\".\n\nRevenues for the year to August 31 fell 10.4 per cent to \u00a367.2m as last year's Christmas turkeys weighed on the \ngroup.\n\nPre-tax profits fell from \u00a37.1m to \u00a30.7m as families opted for fewer, but better quality gifts at Christmas during the \neconomic downturn.\n\n\"When you go through a bad trading period retail wise, then it is only the best items that do well,\" said Mr King.\n\nInternational sales leapt by a quarter as the British brands such as Peppa Pig, the children's TV character, \nlaunched in new markets. Peppa, who is owned by London-listed distribution group Entertainment One, has \n\n\n\nbecome a global success, with shows in Australia, Spain and Italy. Entertainment One launched the children's \ncartoon character in Russia earlier this year.\n\nDiluted earnings per share fell from 23p to 2.8p. Character kept its dividend for the year flat at 6.6p.\n\nRichard Hickinbotham, analyst at Charles Stanley, said: \"Character finished [the financial year] in far better shape \nthan it entered it.\"\n\n\"The first half of the year was affected by a very difficult retail market over the important Christmas trading period \nand subsequent clearances of excess stock, particularly of third party lines,\" he added.\n\nCharles Stanley expects the toymaker's full-year pre-tax profit to return to \u00a37m next year.\n\nShares in Character Group rose 4.3 per cent to 169p.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Yet the road to the latest alliance of Christian Democrats and Social \nDemocrats has been paved with superlatives: the longest negotiations, the highest number of participants, the \nthickest contract - and the poorest outcome.\n\nThe headline of the grand coalition agreement - Shaping Germany's future - reveals all about the lack of inspiration. \nIt is a buzzword - and a misleading one at that: the deal agreed this week by Angela Merkel, chancellor, and her \nSPD coalition partners is more about the past.\n\nLook beyond the eye-catching headlines of a proposed minimum wage and motorway tolls for foreigners and it is \nclear that the only really winners to emerge out of the 185-page document are the old, who will be served threefold. \nOlder mothers will gain higher pension entitlements for every child. Older workers will be able to retire early at 63 if \nthey have paid in to the state pension system for 45 years. Finally, those who have worked all their adult life but \nmade only small contributions to the system will see their pension payments increased.\n\nYou can see why this happened. Data just released by the German demographic institute show that the country's \npopulation has the highest median age of all EU countries - 45 years, compared with 39.7 for the UK and 35 for \nIreland. No surprise then, that the political parties are willingly following the shifting majorities through the age \nstructure of German society. Both big mainstream parties have become parties of the old. It is this age bracket \nwhere they find most of their voters - and the most reliable ones as well. This is the strongest political message the \nnew coalition sends out, albeit inadvertently. If this message sticks - that the old have won - then Germany will lose \nthe confidence of a young, educated generation, and will in the end lose its future.\n\nYes, they have agreed some measures aimed at younger Germans. For example, there will be some further \ninvestment in childcare for small children - to enhance the opportunity for parents (in reality, mostly mothers) to \nreturn to work earlier. But this was only partly motivated by a wish to encourage young couples considering starting \na family. In truth it is more about fulfilling the SPD's pursuit of female self-determination and also about increasing \nthe workforce at a time when the numbers of retiring skilled employees are due to exceed those of educated \ngraduates entering the labour market.\n\nOther initiatives aimed more directly at unburdening families of the costs of education were part of the CDU's \nelection campaign, but were quickly shelved during the coalition negotiations.\n\nMs Merkel and her negotiating team failed to pursue a promised increase in child benefits and family-related tax \nbreaks because they feared that this would imperil the bigger political goal preventing any tax increases. The \neasiest way for the conservatives to hinder the desire of their new social democrat partners to spend more on \nschools, infrastructure and other social benefits was to abandon their own spending wishes.\n\n\n\nFor Ms Merkel this abstinence bore another, more important consequence. It allows her to maintain the policy of \nausterity Germany has been preaching to the rest of Europe, particularly those ailing members of the eurozone. \nThe consequences of the negotiating process for forming a new German government have enforced Ms Merkel's \napproach to the euro crisis - it is no longer just the strategy pursued by and large by her own party, it is now laid \ndown in a treaty with the SPD.\n\nBut then, this abstinence of tax rises or debt increase was easy to achieve, since both parties agreed to ransack the \nbudget of the state pension system instead. The high contributions German workers pay for their obligatory pension \nschemes were due to come down a little, since the present high level of employment provides the pension funds \nwith higher incomes than necessary to pay out current pensions. The contributors to the funds have now been \ndenied this rebate, which might have proved useful in boosting household spending.\n\nRepresentatives of business and economic think-tanks have commented with dismay on the route the new coalition \nis about to take. The chancellor's response has been curt. The outcome of the September election, which saw the \nCDU just fall short of an absolute majority, could - on paper at least - have resulted in a rival coalition with policies \nfar more damaging to German economic interests.\n\nRecent opinion polls indicate a dwindling of early support for the grand coalition. But at the same time the polls also \nshow that among Germans the preference for social stability over economic freedom remains high and unshaken. \nThis is the foundation on which the new government rests. It is a coalition working for those present, not for those to \ncome. But in the end the future of all Germans will be at stake.The writer is political correspondent of the \nFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

The fight is \nabout more than personality. Mr Thaksin, a deeply flawed politician, has nevertheless come to encapsulate the \naspirations of a majority of poorer Thais. The ensuing ideological confrontation has spiralled into violence. In 2008 \nyellows occupied the international airport in their efforts, eventually successful, to force out an elected pro-Thaksin \ngovernment. In 2010, dozens of Mr Thaksin's supporters were shot after they occupied parts of Bangkok.\n\nMr Thaksin still casts a lengthy shadow even though he now lives in exile. In Thailand he faces a two-year jail \nsentence for corruption after a trial in absentia that he insists was politically motivated. A calm of sorts returned \nwhen his sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, was elected prime minister in 2011. The truce was broken in recent weeks \nwhen her government tried to pass a wide-ranging amnesty that critics said was aimed at exonerating her brother. \nThe resulting protests have not abated even though the amnesty bill - a clumsy piece of legislation - has since been \ndropped.\n\nIt would be tempting to say \"a plague on both your houses\". Three years ago it was Mr Thaksin's supporters who \nwere on the streets. Today it is the yellows. Accusations of corruption and incompetence against the current \ngovernment - including for its poorly conceived rice-subsidy policy - have merit. They were equally applicable to the \nprevious Democrat-led administration.\n\nYet the opposition is more in the wrong than the government. The proposal of Suthep Thaugsuban, the main \nprotest leader, that the government stand down in favour of an unelected \"people's council\" is nonsense. It shows \nthat the Thai establishment has still not learnt to accept the result of elections. Ms Yingluck's government has acted \nwith appropriate restraint. There has been no repetition of the shootings of three years ago. She should ensure it \nstays that way. Yet the onus is now on the protesters to cease their illegal occupation of ministries. They have \nmade their point and should now withdraw. If they want to occupy government buildings in future, they should fulfil \none condition first: win an election.\n\n\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Since prices spiked in the wake of the Australian floods of 2010 it has been all one \nway for thermal coal - down.\n\nBut a rally in several coal benchmarks has brought the market back to life and raised hopes the fossil fuel, which is \nused to generate electricity around the world, might have bottomed. The Australian spot price has risen almost 9 \nper cent since its August low to $82.80 a tonne, while its South African equivalent is nearly 17 per cent higher at \n$83.39.\n\nRising thermal coal prices makes a big difference to the profitability of several large producers, including miners \nGlencore Xstrata, Rio Tinto and Anglo American. They are also important for large traders of thermal coal such as \nVitol and Noble.\n\nYet the outlook for thermal coal remains poor. Supply continues to expand, with producers in Australia and \nIndonesia, the world's biggest exporter, still to curtail output in the face of weaker prices. Merrill Lynch estimates a \nfifth of seaborne thermal coal producers are not covering their cash costs at current prices.\n\n\"There's good demand everywhere - but there is just too much supply,\" says one industry executive.\n\nWhile an unusually cold winter in the northern hemisphere and further disruptions in Colombia, which exports \nalmost 70 per cent of coal to Europe, could help support thermal coal, most analysts expect prices to come under \npressure in 2014, especially if demand from China weakens.\n\n\"On balance the global coal market looks oversupplied in 2014, creating the scope for further price weakness,\" \nanalysts at Merrill Lynch wrote earlier this week.\n\nGiven that backdrop, there was surprise when prices jumped suddenly in October. However, many market \nparticipants are sceptical the spikes signal better times ahead. Instead, they pin the recent moves on an aggressive \ntrading strategy.\n\nThe locus of the move, according to some analysts, was coal exported from South Africa into Europe. An index \nwhich tracks Richards Bay coal has risen as much as 25 per cent since August and has pulled several other \nbenchmarks with it.\n\nBut, far from signalling a change in sentiment, traders reckon the move was caused by supply disruptions in Russia \nand Colombia, and may have been exacerbated by trading house Vitol. The commodities trading house bought \nlarge quantities of Richards Bay coal for sale into Europe, several market participants have told the Financial \nTimes.\n\nSome claim Vitol also has a much larger derivatives position, betting that implied freight - or the price differential \nbetween API4, the benchmark South African swaps contract, and API2, the equivalent for coal imported into \nnorthwest Europe - would shrink.\n\n\"You had a trader with a 'short' implied freight position. Effectively, they were bidding up cargoes in order to support \nthat position,\" suggests Ivan Szpakowski, commodities strategist at Citi, who declined to name the trader.\n\nCoal delivered to the European hub of Rotterdam has traditionally fetched a premium to Richards Bay to reflect the \ncosts of the 8,200-nautical mile voyage. But for long periods since August the roles have been reversed and \nRichards Bay has traded at a premium.\n\nAt least one large thermal coal trader has complained to financial regulators in the UK and Switzerland, where Vitol \nis headquartered, about the price movements, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\n\nVitol said that price movements in API4/API2 in the last six months had not been unusual. It added that comments \non its trading positions were based on speculative and incorrect assumptions. \"Vitol takes its regulatory \nresponsibilities, including those in respect of market behaviour, extremely seriously. Any suggestions to the contrary \nwill be strongly contested,\" it said.\n\nAccording to a recent note from Citi, the ability of any trader to execute such a large move would illustrate an \nimportant market trend. While inventories at Richards Bay and rail deliveries are at record levels, an increasing \namount of coal produced is not at the 6,000 kilocalorie benchmark upon which futures are traded.\n\n\"Similar to iron ore, this decreasing availability of index grade material is making these indices less representative \nof the market as a whole and more vulnerable to influence from factors specific to benchmark grade material: for \nexample, a production disruption, hoarding of cargoes,\" Citi said in the note, adding these influences were \ntemporary and should soon pass.\n\nIf and when they do, thermal coal's weak fundamentals will come back into view. Australia and Indonesia, the \nworld's two largest exporters are continuing to increase supply, while demand growth from China, which has \nsoaked up excess seaborne supply in recent years, could be affected by new environmental regulations.\n\nMacquarie estimates seaborne thermal coal exports from Australia and Indonesia are up 14.2m and 36.5m tonnes \nrespectively in the year to date. There are also question marks about India's appetite for thermal coal imports \nfollowing the depreciation of its currency this year.\n\nIndeed, prices have already pulled back from their recent highs. Richards Bay spot has fallen almost 4 per cent \nover the past month. And prices may have to fall further before King Coal can rise again.\n\n\"The solution to the oversupplied market is to inflict further pain on producers via lower prices, forcing them to \ncurtail output,\" Merrill said in its report.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Russia has banned a range of Ukrainian \nproducts, and severely disrupted trade by stepping up border controls on goods and on Ukrainians working in \nRussia.\n\nFailure to conclude a deal with Ukraine would be a blow to the EU's four-year-old \"Eastern Partnership\" \nprogramme, aimed at projecting European values into six ex-Soviet republics by offering deeper trade and political \nties in return for reforms.\n\n\n\nIn Kiev's central square and other Ukrainian cities, thousands of protesters gathered for a seventh day to call for Mr \nYanukovich to sign the deal, and said more would arrive today and over the weekend if he did not. A protest last \nSunday attracted more than 100,000 people - the biggest such gathering since the 2004 Orange Revolution.\n\nA decision by students this week to go on strike has injected fresh energy into the protests. Some protesters said \nauthorities were trying to prevent supporters from pro-European regions of western Ukraine - which played a big \npart in the 2004 uprising - from flocking to Kiev.\n\nIt is unclear whether protests could reach the numbers seen nine years ago. But the advent of social media has \ngiven organisers a tool they did not have in 2004, with a Facebook page for the protests attracting tens of \nthousands of followers.\n\nThe potential joint EU-Ukraine declaration was discussed by Stefan Fule, EU commissioner responsible for \nUkraine, and Ukraine's deputy premier, Serhiy Arbuzov, in Vilnius on Thursday.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;Brussels was said to have come under pressure from Washington to keep chances of a deal with Ukraine alive. \nExtending talks until March could allow time for the International Monetary Fund to resolve differences with Kiev \nover a bailout to ease Ukraine's worsening financial squeeze.\n\nSome EU officials and senior Ukrainians warned, however, that such a declaration might merely provide a \nsmokescreen for Mr Yanukovich to complete talks on an alternative arrangement with Russia's president Vladimir \nPutin.\n\nSenior EU officials on Thursday called on the Ukrainian president to take responsibility for his country's future \ndirection. \"The offer is still on the table. The association agreement is ready for signature as soon as Ukraine is \nready,\" Mr Fule said in Vilnius.\n\nDalia Grybauskaite, Lithuania's president who is hosting the summit, denied that Russia had outflanked the EU \nover Ukraine. She said Mr Yanukovich had to decide in which direction he wanted to lead his country.\n\n\"We are talking about a decision that Ukraine made,\" she told the Financial Times. \"It is not about pressures, and \ntools of pressure, it is about [whether] a country . . . is willing to accept and react to the pressure.\n\n\"Lithuania for 20 years was receiving such kind of pressures [from Russia],\" she added. \"Even an economic \nblockade at the beginning of the 1990s for eight months, [when] we had no heat, no hot water, during the winter.\"\n\nMustapha Nayem, one of the protest organisers, brought a 20m Ukrainian flag signed protestersors from Kiev and \nunfurled it in Vilnius. \"These protests are historic, because they're the first time that Ukrainians have gone on to the \nstreets not against something, but for something - for Europe,\" she said. \"Even in 2004, it was against the old \nsystem. This is for something - and that makes it more positive.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

This \"role-based pay\" will be paid in the form of cash \nallowances for most employees and therefore will not be counted as bonuses for the purposes of the cap.\n\n\n\nHowever, Barclays is eying a different form of mostly share-based allowances for the top two executives, Mr \nJenkins and Tushar Morzaria, chief financial officer, two people familiar with the plan told the Financial Times.\n\nThe plan is still being discussed at the bank's remuneration committee and will be presented to shareholders early \nnext year.\n\nThe European Union bonus cap, part of the fourth Capital Requirement Directive, comes into force early next year \nand limits bonuses to up to 100 per cent of the level of fixed remuneration or twice that with shareholder approval.\n\n\"Ultimately you want a package that is as similar as possible to pre-CRD IV pay,\" one banker said. Bonuses, which \nwill be smaller in the future thanks to the cap, are typically paid largely in shares.\n\nSeveral other big banks across Europe are thinking about taking similar steps, pay experts said.\n\n\"Most large banks operating in the EU are planning to pay allowances at least partly in shares for the most senior \nexecutives,\" Tom Gosling, head of PwC's reward practice. \"This is to reassure shareholders that executive interests \nwill remain strongly aligned with theirs, despite the increase in fixed pay.\"\n\nInvestors have been wary about banks' plans to use cash allowances as a way to deal with the bonus cap and \nthey have been urging banks to make shares - at least for the top management - a key component in their response \nto the variable pay limit.\n\nAt least one large shareholder is uncomfortable with Barclays' plans to pay most of its affected staff with cash \nallowances and would rather see the bank use shares, an executive from that shareholder told the Financial Times.\n\nThe benefit of both cash and share allowances is that they will be reviewed at the beginning of each year and, like \nbonuses, can be adjusted upwards and downwards. They are paid monthly and also do not count towards an \nemployee's pension.\n\nIt is still unclear how many employees will be captured by the bonus cap as Europe's main banking regulator has \nnot yet finalised the definition of these \"material risk-takers\". In a draft proposal, which will probably be finalised \nbefore Christmas, the European Banking Authority proposed to catch anyone earning more than EUR500,000.\n\nUnder the UK's old definition, Barclays had 393 material risk-takers last year and 1,338 staff earning more than \n\u00a3500,000 (EUR592,000).\n\nMr Jenkins was paid \u00a31.13m in base salary, pension and other benefits last year because he gave up his bonus \nand pledged to \"be aggressive\" on cost and pay levels.\n\nAdditional reporting by Patrick Jenkins\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The Swiss economy expanded in the \nthird quarter on the back of stronger exports, construction and government spending, data that helped bolster the \nfranc against the euro. The Philippines posted robust growth in the third quarter, before the natural disaster struck \nthe country.\n\nEurope\n\nSwitzerland: GDP expanded 0.5 per cent in the third quarter, seasonally adjusted, maintaining the level of growth \nfrom the two previous quarters. While exports of goods went up 0.5 per cent, imports of goods went down 0.3 per \ncent quarter on quarter. Year on year, GDP expanded 1.9 per cent, with exports of goods growing 1.5 per cent and \nimports of goods shrinking 1.2 per cent.\n\n\n\nSpain: Second GDP estimates showed that the economy grew 0.1 per cent in the third quarter compared with the \nprevious one, after decreasing 0.1 per cent in the second quarter. The industrial sector expanded 0.8 per cent \nbetween the second and the third quarter, while construction went down 1.5 per cent. In an annual basis, GDP \ncontracted 1.1 per cent in the third quarter.\n\nItaly: The Istat business confidence climate index increased from 79.9 in October to 83.2 in November. In \nmanufacturing, the confidence index rose, while it fell slightly in construction. Employment expectations also \nworsened, but the retail trade confidence index went up 1.3 points - from 89.4 in October to 90.7 in November.\n\nTurkey: Consumer confidence index rose 2.6 per cent from October to November, reaching 77.5 points. The index \nfrom the Turkish Statistics Institute indicates an optimistic outlook when it is above 100 and a pessimistic outlook \nwhen below 100.\n\nSweden: Retail sales volume increased by 3.8 per cent in October year on year. Both retail sales for consumables \nas for durables increased - by 2.4 per cent and 4.9 per cent - respectively. While retail sales volume remained \nunchanged between September and October, it went up 0.3 per cent in the third quarter compared with the second.\n\nAsia-Pacific\n\nPhilippines: In the third quarter, GDP expanded 7 per cent year on year, as robust growth remained intact in the \nquarter before a typhoon devastated a part of the country. Year to date, the economy grew 7.5 per cent, so that the \ngovernment will probably reach its 6-7 per cent growth target for this year despite the expected moderation in the \nfourth quarter following Typhoon Haiyan.\n\nJapan: Retail sales fell 1 per cent in October compared with September, but after large increases in the previous \ntwo months the upward trend in sales was still left intact. The decline was also smaller than indicated by the recent \nsharp drop in consumer confidence. Year on year car sales rose 15 per cent.\n\nAmericas\n\nBrazil: The producer price index had its first negative reading since February, decreasing 0.37 per cent from \nSeptember to October after an increase of 0.57 per cent in the previous month. The mainly positive changes \nbetween September and October were registered in tobacco and beverages, while transport equipment and \nchemical products went down.\n\nCanada: Seasonally adjusted, the current account deficit decreased $0.5bn from the second to the third quarter, \nreaching $15.5bn. The deficit on trade in goods narrowed $0.3bn to $2.2bn in the third quarter, with exports \nstrengthening more than imports. The trade surplus with the US went up $1.7bn, largely because of exports of \nenergy and automotive products. However, the trade deficit with other countries expanded to $14.5bn. Overall \nexports of goods were up $1.4bn to $120.1bn, led by stronger sales of energy products, especially crude oil.\n\nThe industrial product price index (IPPI) declined 0.3 per cent in October compared with September, after going \ndown 0.2 per cent in September. The drop was mainly influenced by a 2.4 per cent decrease in petroleum and coal \nproducts prices, with petrol prices shrinking 4.5 per cent.\n\nAfrica\n\nSouth Africa: The producer price index reached 6.3 per cent year on year in October, after an annual change of 6.7 \nper cent registered in September. The main contributors to the annual rate in October were the 12 per cent increase \nin wood and paper product prices and the 5 per cent increase in food, beverages and tobacco product prices.\n\nFrom September to October, the PPI increased 0.5 per cent, also mainly influenced by food, beverages and \ntobacco and wood and paper products.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

It is thought several more aspiring SAS men could easily have died; and it does seem clear \nthat there could, for instance, have been more access to water without compromising the standards required.\n\nHowever, the response does make the mind race in strange directions: had it existed, how would the HSE have \nresponded to the first world war? And there is a serious issue here as well: how can the SAS find the soldiers most \nlikely to cope with conditions of the utmost danger if it cannot test them to their limits?\n\nThis conundrum may not have an obvious connection with the allegedly polite sport of cricket, but this week it does. \nJonathan Trott, a linchpin of the England batting line-up for the past four years, left his team's tour of Australia the \nday after they were crushed in the first Ashes Test at Brisbane. Trott himself had a match that was beyond dismal, \ngetting out twice cheaply and horribly to the fast bowler, Mitchell Johnson.\n\nOne of his opponents, David Warner, called Trott scared, and many journalists wrote, in the casual way sports \nwriters do, that he had exhibited mental frailty. The next day came the news that he had \"a stress-related disorder\". \nThis is the third such case involving an England cricketer on tour in the past six years.\n\nAfter this, of course, sympathy for Trott was unanimous. Overtly, anyway. Various former players talked about how \ndepressed they had been on tour. And it is true that cricket has challenges unknown in other sports. There are the \nlong overseas trips, increasingly miserable now that the players spend their time closeted with each other drinking \nbeetroot juice instead of relishing the joy of travel.\n\nThere is also the intense and individual nature of the game, especially for batsmen, for whom each innings mirrors \nlife itself - you bat on until felled by a sudden blow - and for a batsmen out of form, as Trott was, each dismissal is \nindeed a little death.\n\nYet at the same time, unlike a golfer or tennis player, you cannot control your own schedule and opt out at moments \nof mental fragility: voluntary absence makes the selectors' hearts grow harder. And English cricketers are not \nmegamillionaires: they earn good money but not enough to make them stop caring about it. They have the \npressures of the squeezed middle.\n\nBut deep in the minds of some fellow professionals, particularly those from more robust generations, the reaction \nmight have been less generous. Thirty years ago England were being duffed up far more viciously than the current \nteam by the West Indian fast bowlers, who were then world-beating. The England captain, David Gower, rejected \nany notion of mercy: \"It's a Test match. It's not Old Reptonians v Lymeswold, one off the mark and jolly good show. \nYou're not expecting life to be made easy for you.\"\n\nCricket has been ahead of other sports in adapting to modern mores. Steven Davies, the reserve wicketkeeper on \nEngland's last Australian tour, announced he was gay and no one blanched. But there is a difference here. Trott's \nperformance was suffering. This was a man who had previously shown his ability to withstand high-class fast \nbowling, sometimes accompanied by insults from the crowd and the opposition. That is the nature of a Test. Then \nsuddenly he could not, which is what happens to all players eventually. In a sense it does not matter whether that \nchange has been given a medical name or not.\n\nCricket could try to make its tours less frequent and less enclosed - the top players are men who really do need to \ngo out more. But it cannot compromise on the mental and physical demands of the essential challenge, otherwise \nthere is no point. Just as the SAS can refine its methods but should never compromise on what it takes to get \nthrough its own test - or everyone's health and safety would be endangered.\n\nmatthew.engel@ft.com\n\nmailto:matthew.engel@ft.com\n\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Italian newspapers reported that the \nUS bank had already presented a report called \"Chicago Dossier\" to Eon, valuing the utility's assets at EUR2bn to \nEUR3bn. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.\n\nThe German utility started operations in Italy in 2000 and expanded rapidly with its 2008 purchase of most of \nEndesa's operations after Enel, the Italian energy group, bought the Spanish utility. The timing could not have been \nworse as the Italian economy was nosediving into its worst postwar slump. Italy's economic output has contracted \nby 8 per cent since then and industry has shrunk by 25 per cent, leaving many power stations almost idle.\n\nThe fourth largest utility in Italy, Eon has seven power stations with a total generation capacity of over 6 gigawatts, \nsupplying electricity and gas to more than 900,000 residential and business customers. Gas makes up 56 per cent \nof Eon's power generation in Italy, followed by coal with 29 per cent and hydro with 8 per cent.\n\nIndustry sources said Eon had been considering a retreat from Italy for three years, but the continuing slump had \ncomplicated its efforts to cut its losses.\n\nThe sources said Eon had not presented its plan to the market but they understood one option was to sell the bulk \nof the assets - unprofitable power stations and more valuable renewables plus the customer base - in one block. \nPotential buyers include French-owned Edison, Russia's Gazprom and Eni, Italy's state-controlled energy group.\n\nBut Enel, Italy's largest utility, said it was not a bidder. \"Enel is not interested in buying the assets Eon may be \nwilling to sell in Italy,\" a spokeswoman said. Heavily indebted Enel is also going through an asset disposal \nprogramme and is suffering from reduced energy demand in Italy.\n\nSeparately, talks have already started on selling Sardinia's Fiume Santo coal and oil-fired power station, which \nneeds environmental upgrading, to a Chinese investor. The Olt regasification plant might also be sold separately. \nEon also has a 9 per cent share in the Trans Adriatic Pipeline which is planned to link Italy to Albania for the \ntransport of gas from Azerbaijan.\n\nA spokeswoman for Eon in Italy said: \"There have always been rumours about potential sales of Eon's Italian \nactivities. We do continuously review the strategic options with regards to our portfolio, including our business in \nItaly. Such review may or may not result in us deciding, from time to time, the disposal of certain assets.\"\n\nEon's underlying group net income declined by more than half in the first nine months of this year, compared with \nthe same period last year. The decline reflects the impact of Germany's transition to renewable energy and \nplunging wholesale prices. Eon is selling assets to cut costs, with a EUR20bn disposal programme, including the \nsale of its stake in uranium enrichment company Urenco.\n\nNathalie Casali, an equity research analyst for European utilities at JPMorgan, said: \"[The sale] is consistent with \ntheir focus on divesting in geographies where they are subscale. They are clearly constrained from a balance sheet \nperspective in terms of how much investment they can do.\"\n\nLong-term financial commitments, particularly nuclear decommissioning, will restrict Eon's growth, Ms Casali said, \npredicting that the company's debt ratio would rise to four times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and \namortisation. The company's businesses in Brazil and Turkey are expected to grow strongly, but this growth will be \n\"small compared to big declines as seen from a European perspective\", she added.\n\nDavide Tabarelli, head of Nomisma Energia think-tank, said Italy's energy sector suffered from overcapacity and \nlow margins, while investments were complicated by the obstructive powers of local authorities. However, he \ndescribed Eon's hydro assets in Terni, with capacity of about 500MW, as a \"cash cow\".\n\n\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Whether brand new or new versions of old favourites, all would make welcome gifts. This week I \nfocus on devices used mainly at home. Next week: phones, cameras, fitness and miscellaneous.\n\nTablets\n\nOne of the most popular gifts this year is likely to be a tablet. They still look like the cool thing to have and they are \nslimmer, faster and more capable than ever, at least in part because of the huge number of apps now available for \nthem. Although they are portable, many people use them more at home than out and about.\n\nMy own favourite is Apple's new iPad Air. A year ago, rival tablets would have featured on only a few wish lists but \nsome of them have become very acceptable alternatives.\n\nMy suggestion for a rival to match the full-size Air would be Samsung's Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 edition), which has \nthe benefit of a fun electronic stylus.\n\nAmong the smaller, 7-inch tablets, the iPad Mini Retina display version and Google Nexus 7 stand out because of \ntheir features, power and, in the case of the Nexus 7, excellent value.\n\nE-readers\n\nThe gap between e-readers and tablets has all but disappeared but for anyone reading for an extended period of \ntime, dedicated e-readers still have big advantages in terms of screen readability and battery life. Amazon's Kindle \nPaperwhite and Barnes & Noble's Nook Glowlight are both excellent choices because they are small, light and easy \nto read even in low light.\n\nSound systems\n\nOnce upon a time you needed to take out a second mortgage to get a whole-house audio system capable of \ndelivering high-quality music to every room. The latest wireless whole-house systems make great gifts, being \nreasonably affordable and easy to set up as well as performing remarkably well. My top choices are the Sonos Play \n5 system because it is easy to set up and operate and, like other Sonos equipment, delivers very good sound \nquality, and Pure's Jongo T2, which is excellent value for money.\n\nAudiophiles may well appreciate the gift of new speakers for their hi-fi system: my favourites include Kef's LS50s \nand Audience ClairAudient 1+1s, which deliver superb sound from bookshelf-friendly speakers.\n\nTo improve the tinny sound from most HDTVs choose a sound bar such as the  Sonos Playbar, which looks stylish \nas well as sounding good.\n\nFor personal listening, Sennheiser's Momentum is a great headphone set. For a pair you can also use comfortably \nwhile travelling, I like Kef's M500 or Bose's noise-cancelling QuietComfort 15.\n\nGames consoles\n\nMany gamers are looking forward to this holiday season in particular because new consoles are available from both \nSony and Microsoft. The really serious gamers will already have got their machines, but for mere enthusiasts, the \nSony PlayStation 4 is probably the better choice. But the extra TV features and music playing options available with \nMicrosoft's Xbox One make it an interesting alternative.\n\nTelevision\n\nIf you want the TV streaming without the gaming offered by the Xbox, consider one of the latest, affordable set-top \nboxes or streaming video players.  Tivo's Roamio is excellent, although it does require a subscription. Alternatively, \n\n\n\nWestern Digital's WD TV Play and the Roku 3 are both excellent value, with access to a wide range of video \nservices.\n\nWith opportunities for watching serious amounts of TV coming up in the holiday season, some families may want to \ntreat themselves to one of the affordable flat-panel HD TVs that connect to the internet and provide access to web \napps. My first choice would be the 55in version of Samsung's 8000 Series LED TV.\n\nPCs\n\nAn all-in-one desktop PC still makes a great gift as they take up almost no space while being useful and an \nentertainment source. Apple's gorgeous 27in iMac is my top pick. The way Lenovo's Flex 20 folds down flat makes \nit good for family fun and games.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

He and his family had been \"traumatised by recent events\".\n\nDuring his time as chief executive of RSA in Ireland, the business had been lauded for its \"strong regulatory and \ncontrol environment\", he said.\n\nIn a curt statement to the London Stock Exchange in response, the UK's biggest non-life insurer by market \ncapitalisation, said Mr Smith - who has run RSA fast-growing Ireland business since 2007 - would not receive \nseverance pay.\n\nMr Smith led an aggressive expansion strategy in Ireland after he took the job, acquiring several businesses that \nenabled RSA to overtake arch-rival Aviva as the country's biggest non-life insurer, with almost 1m policyholders.\n\nBut earlier this month RSA issued a second profit warning within a week because of the accounting shortcomings - \nboth the booking of big insurance claims and the recognition of premium income - at the division, which stretched \nback at least two years.\n\nThe problems have hit RSA's shares and prompted fresh questions about Simon Lee's future as the group chief \nexecutive.\n\nRSA has appointed PwC to conduct a review and has pledged to make public the conclusions within the month.\n\nIreland's Central Bank said on Thursday it had been made aware of Mr Smith's resignation. \"A multi-stranded \ninvestigation continues,\" it said.\n\n\n\nMr Smith stepped back last week as president of Insurance Ireland pending the outcome of the internal RSA \ninvestigation. \"I have served the company well operating at all times under group direction and policy and to the \nbest of my professional judgment and integrity,\" his statement added on Thursday.\n\nAdrian Brown, who runs RSA's UK operation, will remain the interim chief executive in Ireland until the group finds a \npermanent replacement.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

National insurance registrations increased 45 per cent among Portuguese citizens, 52 per cent among \nItalians, 31 per cent among Greeks, and 40 per cent among Spanish citizens, in the year to September 2013, \naccording to government figures.\n\nNigel Farage, leader of the anti-immigration UK Independence party, leapt on the new figures, saying the \ngovernment's immigration controls were a \"complete failure''.\n\n\"The fact that we still have net migration going up, EU migration going up and immigration into the UK still running \nat over half a million people per year is a damning indictment,\" he said.\n\nUkip's popularity has risen because of intensifying concerns about a feared surge of migrants from Romania and \nBulgaria in January, when \"transitional controls\" on these two EU states are dropped.\n\nMindful of this, Mr Cameron this week unveiled measures that aim to make the UK less attractive to EU citizens, \nincluding restrictions on benefit claims and a 12-month ban from Britain for any migrant caught begging.\n\nDespite these efforts, the government's ability to control net migration is severely restricted by a range of factors \nbeyond its grasp.\n\nOne of these is emigration. ONS figures show emigration at its lowest level since 2001, because fewer Britons are \ngoing overseas and fewer migrants are leaving the UK.\n\nCritics of the Home Office also point out that the immigration-cutting policies are doing damage to important sectors \nsuch as education, where further education colleges have experienced a 30 per cent drop in overseas students \nreceiving visas.\n\nMark Harper, immigration minister, said on Thursday that the data were evidence that Home Office reforms were \nworking.\n\n\n\n\"We have tightened immigration routes where abuse was rife, but are still encouraging the brightest and best to \ncome here to study and work,\" he said. \"Net migration has fallen by nearly a third since its peak in 2010 and across \ngovernment we are working hard to bring it down further.\"\n\nScott Blinder, head of the Oxford-based Migration Observatory, said that given the strength of the British economy \nrelative to the rest of Europe and the expected increase in Romanians and Bulgarians, the government faced a \n\"significant hurdle\" to reach its target by the end of this parliament.\n\nChinese arrivals lead the way\n\nEven if the prime minister was downcast over the dwindling chances of meeting his net migration target, there was \nanother surprise in Thursday's data that could not have been better timed, writes Helen Warrell.\n\nJust one week ahead of David Cameron's trade visit to China, the Office for National Statistics confirmed that, for \nthe first time, Chinese citizens accounted for the largest group of migrants to the UK, with 40,000 coming to Britain \nin 2012, compared with 29,000 in 2010.\n\nChina's rise to top spot is partly because of India's sharp decline - caused by steep falls in the number of Indian \nstudents coming to the UK to study. While Indian arrivals topped 60,000 in 2011 and 65,000 in 2010, the number \nhas now fallen to 37,000 after a clampdown on student visas and Home Office rhetoric about cutting immigration \nfrom outside the EU.\n\nThe latest statistics show the number of visas being granted to Indian students has fallen 24 per cent.\n\nChina's new dominance in the immigration table represents a partial success for the coalition, which has been \nstriving to build links with the country. But critics urged ministers not to pursue new diplomatic ties at the expense of \nexisting friendships.\n\nMark Hilton, head of immigration policy at business lobby London First, said there was a \"worrying decline\" in  \nmarkets such as India. \"While we must engage with new markets like China, we ignore our traditional ones - which \nremain much larger - at our peril,\" he said.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Yet it is a task that often proves too much for the Office for National Statistics. Official \ndata are published by newswires at 9.30am on the day of release but there is often a delay before the same \ninformation appears on the agency's website.\n\nThis week the UK Statistics Authority, which oversees the work of the ONS, rightly insisted that everyone should be \nable to access official data on equal terms. An obvious solution would be to fix the ONS website. Yet the UKSA also \nfloated a more drastic proposal in which the ONS would no longer release reports in full on the morning of \npublication, instead dribbling out the numbers over the course of a day.\n\nIt beggars belief that government statisticians should consider degrading the service they provide to avoid \nconfronting what seems to be an elementary computer problem. Obvious technical fixes, such as uploading the \ndata in advance in encrypted form, have been dismissed on flimsy grounds. The proposal also raises broader \nquestions about the judgment of the UKSA. While the principle of equal access is important, the financial institutions \nto whom a short delay would matter most are certain to have timely access via newswires.\n\nThe debacle sends a worrying signal about the state of Britain's statistics agency. On Tuesday Mark Carney, \ngovernor of the Bank of England, said the bank placed little weight on the official measure of real investment \nactivity, which it thinks has become detached from economic reality. Data on the state of household balance sheets \nare also viewed with suspicion. Mr Carney described himself as \"more comfortable\" with the work of Canadian \n\n\n\ngovernment statisticians, and said it would take hard work to bring the quality of UK data up to international \nstandards.\n\nThe task has been made harder by years of neglect. The ONS lost skilled and knowledgeable staff when the \nLabour government moved its office from London to Newport in Wales, over the bank's objections. Budget cuts are \nforcing the agency to stop collecting some information. It seems to be struggling even with a smaller brief.\n\nSuch skimping is unwise. Official statistics may not be glamorous but they are indispensable to good government. \nCompared with the cost of a monetary policy blunder, for example, the price of accurate data is small change.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Powered by a subterranean generator fuelled by crops from the Co-\nop's farms and heated by air sucked up from the earth, the \u00a3100m 14-storey structure was declared the world's \nmost environmentally friendly building.\n\nFor Co-op executives, the occasion - attended by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh - was a chance to end the \nrelentless stream of negative publicity sparked by its bank's near-collapse in June. But any hopes of drawing a line \nunder a turbulent six months were blown apart three days later when a video showing the Reverend Paul Flowers, \nthe bank's former chairman, trying to buy crystal meth and other drugs was published by The Mail on Sunday.\n\nOne Co-op executive described the group's new headquarters as \"a display of our ethics in practice\". But he admits \nthat this lofty sentiment \"sounds a bit trite now given the last couple of weeks\".\n\nThe revelations about Rev Flowers sparked one of the darkest weeks in the Co-op's 170-year history as a wave of \nlurid allegations emerged about the Methodist minister. They range from overclaiming on expenses from a charity to \nlosing his role as a local Labour councillor for having pornography on his computer.\n\nThe accusations have damaged the reputation of the venerable Co-operative institution, which since 1844 has been \na bastion of British culture and commerce and was a worldwide blueprint for the co-operative movement.\n\nThey have also brought into focus the challenges facing co-ops elsewhere as they grapple with capital and \ngovernance problems in an increasingly tough regulatory environment following the financial crisis.\n\n\"Every twist and turn of this story is just creating the worst possible fallout for the wider movement,\" says an MP \nwho is a member of the Co-operative's own political party, part of the leftwing Labour group. \"I'd be lying if I said I \ncould see much of an upside at the moment.\"\n\nBut for all the damage from the Flowers scandal, it has - at least for now - served as a distraction for the far more \nserious financial problems at the Co-op bank. Years of management incompetence, which culminated in this year's \naborted bid to buy 630 branches from Lloyds Banking Group , the UK's largest high-street lender, means the future \nof the bank now hangs in the balance.\n\nIts creditors have until today to submit first-round votes on a sweeping debt restructuring. If approved, the overhaul \nwill hand a 70 per cent equity stake in the bank to institutional investors - including a group of US hedge funds \nwhose aggressive brand of capitalism is the antithesis of the Co-op's mutual and social heritage. If it is blocked, the \nbank is likely to be plunged into resolution and disappear.\n\nThis state of affairs is a bitter comedown from just last year when George Osborne, the UK chancellor, publicly \nendorsed the Co-op bank's attempt to triple its size by buying the Lloyds business.\n\nOn Wall Street, the hedge funds that piled into the Co-op bank's distressed \"lower tier two\" debt this summer have \nbeen left shocked and bemused at the latest twist in the saga. The scandal has also roiled UK politics. The Labour \n\n\n\nparty has been attacked for taking generous donations and cheap loans from the Co-op Group, while the ruling \nConservatives have come under fire for pushing to relax regulations for its bank.\n\nMeanwhile the UK's Treasury, its chief financial watchdog and police force have launched formal inquiries into the \nmismanagement of the bank.\n\nYet this is not the first time the Co-op Group - or the broader movement - has run into problems.\n\nFrom its roots as a grocery store founded by 28 weavers, joiners and shoemakers in Rochdale, a textile-making \ntown in the northwest of England, the Co-op Group has expanded to a \u00a313.5bn business spanning supermarkets, \npharmacies, funeral parlours and other, smaller divisions.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;The Rochdale Pioneers inspired a global movement. The International Co-operative Alliance, which was set up \nto represent the sector in 1895, says there are now 1,500 co-operatives that generate $100m of revenues annually, \nand tens of thousands of smaller groups. Overall there are 1bn individual co-op members worldwide.\n\nMost of the UK's co-ops sprang up across industrial Britain in the late 19th century to free working people from the \ntyranny of merchants who sold overpriced goods and bread adulterated with chalk. By 1950 co-ops sold a quarter \nof Britain's groceries. But as megastores grew more popular, the co-ops struggled; by 2000 their share fell to 5 per \ncent.\n\nAfter a failed takeover bid for what was then the Co-operative Wholesale Society by London financier Andrew \nRegan in 1997, the fragmented co-op sector decided to consolidate. After a series of mergers in 2008 it bought \nSomerfield, the UK supermarket chain, for \u00a31.5bn.\n\nThe move prompted Peter Marks, the chief executive, to say it had arrived in the \"Premier League\". He was \ndetermined to shake off the Co-op Group's fuddy-duddy image and start competing with its big commercial rivals.\n\n\"It was confident it could do better - the retail business started to improve, profitability increased and the bank was \nstrong. The outlook was really very bright,\" says Lord Monks, who chaired an independent commission set up by \nTony Blair to suggest ways of modernising the co-op movement.\n\nBut in 2009 the Co-op's bank, which had garnered political support after emerging from the financial meltdown in \nbetter shape than many UK lenders, ploughed into a disastrous merger with the Britannia building society, a small \nbut toxic UK mutual. The merger tripled the size of the Co-op bank to 300 branches. But Britannia's exposure to \ncommercial property eventually brought it to its knees.\n\nTo a large degree, the Co-op Group's structure has been its downfall. The lack of outside shareholders - which \nsupporters say removes the constant pressure to generate short-term financial returns - also means the group has \nnot been held to account.\n\n\"Because of how it operated, as a mutual away from public notice, the amount of external scrutiny has been \nextremely limited,\" says a person familiar with the group. \"There has been no effective challenge.\"\n\nThe Co-op's ambitions have also been held back by what it can offer its executives. \"Commercial people want to be \npaid commercially. In the era of top salaries that has been a big problem,\" says Lord Monks.\n\nOther critics say the Co-op openly prioritised ethics, and employees' links to the co-operative movement, over \nbusiness expertise, leaving it with a crop of second-rate executives.\n\n\n\nIt has also faced years of questions about its unique and quirky governance. Until this year the bank board was \nmade up almost entirely of elected Co-op members, including a plasterer and a nurse. One former group board \nmember says Len Wardle, who quit as Co-operative Group chairman this month, and Rev Flowers, his former ally \nat the bank, regarded the executives running their businesses as \"hired help\".\n\nA clutch of former bank executives and board members were cleared out by Euan Sutherland, the new group chief \nexecutive who replaced Mr Marks in May, a month after the Lloyds deal collapsed.\n\nOn his second day, Mr Sutherland contacted Andrew Bailey, head of the Prudential Regulation Authority, to tell him \nthe Co-op bank's finances were in a far weaker position than he had thought. Shortly thereafter, Barry Tootell, Rev \nFlowers and other directors were told to leave. In June, the regulator revealed a \u00a31.5bn hole in the Co-op bank's \nbalance sheet.\n\nMr Sutherland quickly put in place a restructuring plan that would have allowed the Co-op group to keep a majority \nstake in its bank and forced severe losses on its creditors.\n\nBut behind the scenes, US hedge funds, including Aurelius and Silver Point, were amassing a blocking stake in a \ntranche of the Co-op's bonds. As Mr Sutherland insisted there was no Plan B, advisers to the hedge funds \napproached the Bank of Englandwith what they thought was a better solution.\n\nThey worked out that if they blocked the Co-op's offer, the regulator could trigger a resolution process that would \nhand them all the bank equity and wipe out the group. Pressed by regulators, Mr Sutherland started listening to the \nbondholders.\n\nAstring of hostile meetings followed as Co-op executives, and their advisers from UBS and Greenhill on one side, \nand the LT2 group, including Aurelius and adviser Moelis on the other, thrashed out a rescue deal.\n\nAt first dismissive of the bondholders' plan, the Co-op Group soon realised there was an alternative that would \nmean it had to put in less money but keep the biggest equity stake, 30 per cent, although it would have to relinquish \nmajority control.\n\nThe two big stumbling blocks were how to deal with the 10,000-strong army of retail investors that own \u00a3170m of \nlow-ranking Co-op bank bonds; and, somewhat ironically, given the revelations that have since emerged about Rev \nFlowers, how to ensure the hedge funds would not usurp the bank's ethical values.\n\nThe deal was finally struck on November 4. The Co-op Group agreed at the last minute to inject \u00a3129m of cash to \ncompensate retail investors. And the hedge funds agreed to honour a host of ethical values, including restrictions \non which companies the Co-op can do business with.\n\nPeople close to the Co-op say the early submissions for the vote on the bank restructuring are promising, despite \nthe recent damage to its brand. The final outcome, however, will not be known until next month.\n\nEven if the restructuring is approved the Co-op bank still has a long way to go to repair its battered reputation. Its \nnew management team plans to shrink the bank and return it to its roots as a conservative lender to individuals and \nsmall businesses.\n\nThe bank also faces years of distracting and intrusive reviews from UK authorities. One of its biggest immediate \nchallenges will be convincing customers that it is any more ethical than other institutions.\n\nThe fact that the values will be legally embedded in the bank for the first time is enough to convince some.\n\n\"I vary between anger and laughter thinking that when the bank was part of the Co-op Group it was less ethical than \nit will be owned by some of the most aggressive commercial investors in the world,\" says one person involved in \nthe restructuring.\n\nThe blight of sloppy governance\n\n\n\nGiven his six-month battle to save the movement's banking operation, Euan Sutherland might feel like the most \nbruised co-op chief executive in the world . But the head of the UK's Co-operative Group is in good company, writes \nPatrick Jenkins.\n\nAt Dutch co-operative Rabobank, a similar betrayal of the lender's founding principles triggered the resignation last \nmonth of its CEO. Rabo, founded by and for Dutch farmers, was fined $1bn over lending-rate manipulation - the \nlatest bank caught up in scandals surrounding benchmark lending rates, such as Libor.\n\nFrance's mutually owned banks, including the world's biggest - Cr\u00e9dit Agricole - is under investigation by the \nEuropean Commission over involvement in the same affair, although its chief executive is adamant his institution is \ndifferent and is refusing to settle.\n\nFans of the co-operative movement insist there are plenty of beacons of success, such as Canada's  Desjardins \nnetwork. But in the aftermath of the 2008 financial meltdown, much of the movement is in crisis.\n\nAnalysts believe the woes of the world's co-ops have two common causes. \"It all comes down to corporate \ngovernance and capital allocation,\" says Carola Schuler at Moody's, the credit rating agency.\n\nSloppy governance, a contributor to all these scandals, is perpetuated by local community interests overriding \nbetter management structures. As for capital, co-operatives are institutionally constrained in their ability to raise \nfunds, a crucial weakness after losses incurred in the financial crisis.\n\nAdditional reporting by Jim Pickard\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

In April, he and Mike Johanns, \nRepublican senator, wrote to Jack Lew, Treasury secretary, urging the council to set up specific guidance for each \nindustry that is under review.\n\nMr Tester brought up his concerns again this month at the Senate hearing for Janet Yellen, the nominee to be next \nhead of the US Federal Reserve. In that position, Ms Yellen would have a seat on the council.\n\nThe senators' criticisms could delay the council's assessment of asset managers, giving them more time to lobby \nfor the regulation to be watered down.\n\n\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;The Treasury department argues that the FSOC process, set up in statute by the Dodd-Frank bill, is completely \ntransparent. Companies chosen for review are asked to submit all the information they have that could dissuade the \ncouncil from ruling against them.\n\n\"The council has developed a robust process for evaluating whether a non-bank financial company should be \nsubject to board of governors supervision and to enhanced prudential standards,\" according to a fact sheet on \nFSOC.\n\nIf a company is deemed systematically important, it receives a written explanation for the decision. The company \ncan also request a hearing to contest it. It is then up to the Federal Reserve to set up the capital standards and \nother measurements.\n\nIn September, the US Treasury's Office of Financial Research issued a report detailing ways in which the asset \nmanagement industry could create vulnerabilities in the financial system.  This was criticised by market participants.\n\nWhile the asset management industry has fought back against the council's efforts, insurance companies have not \nbeen as united. They were the first to receive the systematically important designations and American International \nGroup and GE Capital accepted them without a struggle.\n\nPrudential Financial, the second-largest life insurer in the US, opposed being designated systematically important in \nSeptember, but the company declined to pursue legal action. Fellow life insurer MetLife is under review by the \ncouncil.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

It now includes 37 countries.\n\nGeorge Osborne, the chancellor, said that such sharing would provide HM Revenue & Customs with vital \ninformation to fight evasion and reflected a recognition by financial centres that prosperity depended on \ntransparency.\n\nHe said: \"This government has been leading the way in pushing for greater tax transparency and information-\nsharing - putting it at the heart of our G8 agenda.\"\n\nThe announcement coincided with the conclusion of new tax agreements between Britain and many UK Overseas \nTerritories, in another sign of the growing momentum behind the international crackdown on evasion.\n\nThe agreements follow groundbreaking US legislation that has been pivotal in forcing tax havens to become more \ntransparent.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view.

Few have done so with \ntiming quite so dangerous to their boss as Philip Smith. In a statement, the rugby-loving head of RSA in Ireland \nalleged he was the \"fall guy\" for difficulties there. A fortnight ago these forced the UK-based general insurer, led by \nSimon Lee, to pump EUR100m into the Irish unit.\n\nThe resignation of Mr Smith will intensify City worries that the Irish problem is worse than first imagined. That would \nincrease pressure on RSA to bolster its regulatory capital, seen as low by analysts at just over \u00a3700m. A \nfundraising of several hundred million pounds would make it harder for Mr Lee to hang on to his job. A \ntroubleshooter outgunned by his troubles, Mr Lee issued two profits warnings in a week in early November.\n\nRising Irish motor claims were one reason. But future profits also looked weaker than expected because of doubts \nover the quality of bookkeeping, according to an internal investigation. One apparent difficulty was that some \npremiums may have been recognised too early. Seemingly, insurance claims may meanwhile have been \nunderreported.\n\nMr Smith reputedly refused to participate in the investigation or to attend subsequent disciplinary meetings set up \nby RSA. Now he is outside the tent, chucking rocks in. That is unusual. When accounting irregularities are alleged, \nexecutives generally keep their heads down and keep quiet. Mr Smith's refusal to do either further reduces Mr \nLee's control of events in Ireland, whose central bank is investigating RSA.\n\n\"The stock of goodwill enjoyed by the chief executive has run very low,\" says Eamonn Flanagan of Shore Capital.\n\nA public row with Mr Smith - who plans to \"seek justice\" - would deplete it even further. No matter how blame for \nRSA's Irish misadventure is assigned, it will be hard for Mr Lee to duck accusations that the fast-growing Irish unit \nshould have been better controlled.\n\nWaving not drowning\n\nHarriet Green, chief executive of Thomas Cook, is the human antithesis of a cosmic black hole. She roams the \nstock market, devouring and neutralising negativity. When she took charge of the venerable travel agent last \nsummer, it had already been rescued from financial collapse by predecessor Sam Weihagen. But the market value \nwas a shrunken \u00a3146m and Thomas Cook was hopelessly outclassed by Tui Travel. On Thursday, better than \nexpected annual results and higher savings targets lifted the shares 14 per cent, leaving the group capitalised at \n\u00a32.5bn.\n\nMs Green, a jargon-spouting travel tyro, has begun to look like respectable competition for Peter Long, the industry \nveteran who leads Tui.\n\nA company that has suffered a near-death experience is ripe for reform. Ms Green has swapped Thomas Cook's \ndated blue logo for a \"sunny heart\" and slashed the number of sub-brands from 85 to 30. Delivering sincere flattery \nto Tui, she has increased the number of exclusive hotels on offer and driven the business online, though at 36 per \ncent of sales, penetration is surely lower than she would like.\n\nHurricane Harriet has beaten a savings goal of \u00a3170m for 2013, designated \"Wave One\", by \u00a324m. She has \nincreased the target for 2015 (\"Wave Two\") by \u00a340m to \u00a3440m. Thomas Cook claims to have made an operating \n\n\n\nprofit for the first time since 2010, although that involves adjustments without which a statutory loss of \u00a3158m was \nrealised.\n\nNever mind. Sales and margins are improving. Investors are suitably grateful. Ms Green's staff, who have fallen in \nnumbers, must just be exhausted trying to keep up. They could probably do with a holiday.\n\nFeat of clay\n\nProspects for brick makers look weaker following the Bank of England's decision to stop subsidising housebuilding \nvia Funding for Lending. One hopes the renaissance of this ancient industry will continue, even so. It would be \ntragic if the UK lost irreplaceable expertise in digging up clay and cooking it in big ovens.\n\nCritics would say there is very little to know about a brick. Certainly, the product is simpler than, say, an iPad. The \nclassic model has five flat sides and a dimple in the top, called \"the frog\". But regional varieties are as distinctive as \napples. To enthusiasts (who typically smoke roll-ups and belt their trousers with string), an orange-red \"Eldon\" from \nDurham is poles apart from a blue-grey \"Hamblet\" from Walsall. Collectors pay thousands for the finest specimens. \nWell, fivers at least.\n\nAs one construction executive poignantly told an FT reporter this week: \"A brick is not just for Christmas, it is for \nlife.\"\n\njonathan.guthrie@ft.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

UK ministers have accused the \nSNP of naivety for refusing to draw up a Plan B for if it cannot gain UK agreement to a currency union allowing \ncontinued use of the pound.\n\nThe Scottish government's claim that it would be able to retain EU membership smoothly after independence has \nalso come under attack abroad. \n\nMariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, said this week: \"I am very clear, as everyone is, that a country that \nobtained independence from the EU would end up outside of it, and it's right that Scottish citizens and all the \ncitizens of the union know that.\"\n\nScottish nationalists waved aside Mr Rajoy's comments as an effort to weaken support for Catalan nationalists \nseeking independence from Spain. \n\nEnergy bills could prove a powerful weapon for UK pro-union campaigners to attack the Scottish independence \ncampaign, with rising energy prices already causing a political controversy.\n\nLast year, the UK spent about a third of its renewables support in Scotland, because of the large numbers of wind \nfarms there, even though it is home to less than 8.5 per cent of the British population.\n\nMr Greatrex said: \"Were this support to be removed, Scottish bill-payers or taxpayers would have to fill the gap, or \nthe support would have to be reduced.\"\n\nThat financial support is set to rise sharply this decade from a current \u00a32bn a year to nearly \u00a38bn a year by 2020, \nwhen the current system of Renewables Obligation Certificates and feed-in tariffs is largely replaced by a new \nsystem of \"contracts for difference\".\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Unfortunately it can sometimes be fatal,\" says James \nMcGregor, chairman for greater China at Apco Worldwide and author of the book No Ancient Wisdom, No \nFollowers.\n\n\"In China you need to do due diligence on investors.\"\n\nPeel executives have made frequent trips to China, often with British local government officials in tow, and Ms Shiu \nhas visited Liverpool many times.\n\nOn a visit in October, she helped Lindsey Ashworth, Peel Group development director, to open Peel's latest office \nproject. He joked that he picked Ms Shiu as a partner because of her ability to drink him under the table.\n\nOn May 28 2012, Peel signed a joint venture with Ms Shiu at a ceremony in a Beijing hotel, attended by Lord \nGreen, UK minister of state for trade and investment, and Phil Davies, Wirral council leader.\n\nPeel's proposed International Trade Centre would be built on desolate former docks on the Wirral peninsula, near \nLiverpool, one of the most deprived cities in the UK. Once the second biggest port in the world, many of the \nwharves along the Mersey are crumbling.\n\nDemolition of existing buildings on the site has not yet begun. Ms Shiu is supposed to help attract up to 1,000 \ncompanies from across Asia to move into 2.5m sq ft of self-contained units where they can exhibit, sell and \ndistribute goods into the European market.\n\nDuring his China visit, Mr Cameron plans to highlight the Merseyside scheme as an example of regeneration \nprojects in the UK that are ready to be marketed to Chinese investors.\n\nCouncil-owned investment agencies in Liverpool and the Wirral have maintained that Ms Shiu is a \"high-ranking \nmember of the Chinese government\" who has put \u00a325m into the project, echoing claims made in the local press. \nTheir publicity talks of Chinese government approval and the multibillion-dollar size of Ms Shiu's group.\n\nLiverpool Vision said it made the claims in \"good faith\" while Invest in Wirral declined to comment.\n\nRichard Kemp, leader of the opposition Liberal Democrats on Liverpool city council, said local authorities should \n\"remove their rose-tinted spectacles.

The \ndepartment stores Macy's, JC Penney and Sears were to open at 8pm, as will Target, the style-oriented discount \nchain.\n\nThe pressure to capture sales has been intensified this year by the fact Thanksgiving falls late in November, which \nmeans six fewer days to Christmas than last year and a compressed shopping season.\n\nThe National Retail Federation has forecast that holiday sales will rise by 3.9 per cent from a year ago and the \nInternational Council of Shopping Centers has predicted a 3.4 per cent increase.\n\nBut analysts have warned that retailers' big discounts mean they will be sacrificing profits at the expense of sales.\n\nAccording to Retail Metrics, a research group, analysts expect the earnings at 120 retailers it follows to rise by just \n2.2 per cent year on year in November, December and January.\n\nNovember and December are make-or-break months for most retailers, which generate 20-40 per cent of their \nannual revenue in the period, according to the National Retail Federation.\n\nBut the Thanksgiving weekend is not always a good indicator of how spending will ultimately pan out. Some years \nhave got off to a strong start but had a weak shopping reason overall. In other years the pattern has been reversed.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

They will appear before magistrates on Friday.\n\nThe investigation follows an undercover operation by The Daily Telegraph newspaper.\n\nEuropol, the EU law enforcement agency, revealed in February that an international network of fixers had targeted \n380 matches across Europe in the past five years.\n\nSingapore has been on the radar of investigators as a centre of match-fixing activity.\n\nAt least three footballers are believed to be among those detained in the Midlands by the National Crime Agency. \nOne of them, believed to be Delroy Facey, had a brief spell in the Premier League a decade ago, after which he \ndropped down the football pyramid and plied his trade in non-league football.\n\n\n\nChris Eaton, Fifa's former head of security, said progress was being made in tackling match-fixing networks in \nsome parts of the world. But he warned that the problem remained \"endemic\" across the globe.\n\nThe Europol investigation spanned 13 European countries. But the problem has been prevalent in Africa, and four \nBritish players were arrested and charged over alleged match fixing in Australia earlier this year.\n\nMatch-fixing experts have long warned an attempt to manipulate matches in England was inevitable.\n\nThe Football Association, like governing bodies in other sports, has an integrity unit working with the police, \nlicensed betting operators and the Gambling Commission.\n\nBut resources are limited and sports bodies say they have none of the investigatory powers required to take \nenforcement action. They are limited to education and awareness programmes for players and officials.\n\nAsking such bodies to lead the fight against match fixing is difficult, but not completely impossible, said Mr Eaton.\n\n\"But the solution is to look at betting fraud and sports gambling organisations, not to over-regulate the sport,\" he \nadded.\n\nEven with more resources at their disposal, the national boundaries in which these bodies operate restrict their \nability to tackle what is an international phenomenon.\n\n\"The risk is clearly coming from illegal operators who are not regulated by the UK licensing system,\" said the \nAssociation of British Bookmakers.\n\nMr Eaton said football was facing a critical time in the battle against match-fixing and called for a united \ninternational response.\n\n\"Sports betting organisations roam globally, sports roam globally, organised crime roams globally,\" he said. \"[A \nnational response] doesn't make sense.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Prime Minister David \nCameron visited the proposed \u00a310bn Wirral Waters and Liverpool Waters schemes. John Whittaker, chairman of \nproperty giant Peel Holdings, which conceived it, visited China with Mr Cameron.\n\nLiverpool was a twin city of Shanghai. Squint at the Chinese city's famous waterfront Bund and you could be on the \nMersey: its European architects modelled it on the second-largest seaport of the day. Liverpool now wanted to ape \nShanghai's modern-day skyscrapers.\n\nLiverpool Vision, the city investment agency, says local businesses have won \u00a326m of contracts and orders since \nthe 2010 Shanghai Expo, where it was the only British city to exhibit.\n\n\n\nBut Richard Kemp, Liberal Democrat leader on Liverpool council, admits to doubts over Peel's venture with Stella \nShiu, a Chinese entrepreneur. \"Manchester dealt with a state-owned bank.

He was filmed apparently \nbuying crystal meth, cocaine and other illegal drugs and is under investigation by the police.\n\nThe Co-op admitted on Thursday that recent events \"may have caused some brand and reputational damage\" to \nthe bank and may also have contributed to a recent loss of current account customers.\n\nAurelius snapped up the Co-op Bank's bonds after a severe capital shortage emerged at the lender in the summer. \nAlong with several other hedge funds, including Silverpoint Capital and Beach Point Capital, it built a blocking stake \nin the bonds, which it used to secure a far better deal for creditors than had originally been offered by the bank.\n\nPeople familiar with Aurelius's decision to sell said it had offloaded the bonds because they had performed strongly \nafter the restructuring deal was announced.\n\nThe Co-op agreed last month to hand the investors in the lower tier two bonds a 70 per cent equity stake in the \nbank as part of a sweeping restructuring aimed at plugging a \u00a31.5bn capital hole.\n\nPerry Capital is locked into the terms of the restructuring, and will also have to support a legally binding agreement \nto support the bank's ethical policies.\n\nNews of the sale comes as thousands of the Co-op's creditors are preparing to meet Friday's first-round deadline to \nvote on the bank's restructuring.\n\nPeople involved in the process said the mutual had secured early support for the debt exchange, with the small \nnumber of votes that had been received so far coming in strongly in favour.\n\nSecuring support from creditors is vital to avoid the collapse of the bank.\n\nThe biggest hurdle for the Co-op has been mobilising its 10,000 or so retail investors, who own about \u00a3170m of \nlow-ranking bonds, to vote. Many of these investors are pensioners, who have had to decipher complex legal \ndocuments. The Co-op needs two-thirds of these retail investors to take part in the vote, and requires the support \nof three-quarters of those that do vote.\n\nLT2, a group of hedge funds and other investors, on Thursday pledged its support for the restructuring, after \nasking the Co-op to make a last-minute amendment to the terms.\n\n\n\nThe change is intended to close a loophole that was providing an opportunity for brokers and traders to undermine \nthe new equity issuance by submitting claims for larger numbers of shares than they were entitled to. This could \nhave meant that the LT2 group ended up with a smaller equity stake than they expected.\n\n\"The LT2 Group confirms its support for the recapitalisation of the Co-op Bank and . . . is fully supportive of the new \nmanagement team for the bank,\" it said.\n\nAurelius could not be reached for comment while the Co-op Bank declined to do so .\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The BoE and Treasury are ending the incentives for household lending in the \nFunding for Lending Scheme that provides cheap liquidity to banks. It is keeping them for businesses.\n\nThey are also ending a waiver on bank capital requirements for household lending.\n\nThese steps to rein in a stimulus to consumer borrowing mean the BoE is reducing the need for \"larger \ninterventions\" down the line, Mr Carney told a news conference.\n\nThey also mark the first policy reaction by the authorities to a rising tide of warnings about a property price bubble, \nafter more than four years of ultra-low interest rates.\n\nHouse prices nationally may be below their 2007 levels, Mr Carney said, but they are rising at an annual rate of \nnearly 7 per cent and are unlikely to slow soon.\n\nHousehold indebtedness is close to historic highs, the BoE said in its twice-yearly Financial Stability Report. Its \nFinancial Policy Committee is watching a growing \"tail\" of particularly indebted borrowers who would be acutely \nvulnerable to a sharp rise in interest rates.\n\nHouseholds with debts more than five times their income accounted for nearly 20 per cent of mortgage debt, \naccording to information published by the BoE.\n\nWhile shares in housebuilders took a knock on Thursday, lenders played down the significance of the FLS changes \nfor the mortgage market.\n\nBanks' use of the scheme, which was launched last year, has slowed significantly in recent quarters. The latest \nfigures showed \u00a317.6bn of FLS lending in mortgages and SME loans, compared with total expected mortgage \nlending next year of more than \u00a3200bn.\n\nThe cost of financing in wholesale funding markets has fallen sharply for banks in the past year or two as investor \nfaith has been restored, in part thanks to interventions such as FLS in Britain and a broad suite of measures \nintroduced by central banks in Europe and the US.\n\n\"This won't be a big change in terms of pricing,\" said Stephen Pegge, a director of Lloyds who has been closely \ninvolved in FLS. \"There are still going to be very attractive mortgage deals out there.\"\n\nKevin Daly, UK economist at Goldman Sachs, said the announcement is more important for its signals, rather than \nits practical implications. The BoE was sending a clear message that it will not sit idly by if a bubble develops, laying \nout extensive analysis of the resurgent property market in its Financial Stability Report.\n\nThe publication pointed out that property has played a starring role in previous financial crises. It cited research \nfrom the International Monetary Fund showing that recessions accompanied by property busts were two or three \ntimes more severe than other types of downturn.\n\n\n\nAccordingly the BoE was at pains to emphasise its range of weapons, in case it needs to respond to further rises in \nhouse prices. For example, the FPC may in future order lenders to test borrowers' ability to withstand much sharper \nincreases in interest rates.\n\nThe FPC can also make recommendations on maximum mortgage loan-to-value ratios, loan-to-income ratios, debt-\nto-income ratios, or mortgage terms, the stability report said.\n\nThe Bank's stern words on mortgages jar with a Treasury that has just launched its Help to Buy mortgage subsidy \nscheme.\n\nMr Carney played down the seeming contradiction, saying that Help to Buy is a policy targeting would-be \nhomeowners who are struggling to raise a deposit.\n\nHe also reiterated that the BoE could advise changes to the Help to Buy scheme at any time \"if we deem it's \nappropriate to help with financial stability\".\n\nAnalysts were not entirely convinced. As Jens Larsen, chief European economist at RBC Capital, said: \"There is an \nelement of putting your foot on the pedal while also holding down the brake, which doesn't always work very well.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

This is good for families, good for \nbusiness and good for our economy.\"\n\nLib Dem officials said Mr Clegg had conceded ground on the idea that parents returning to work after more than 26 \nweeks should have the right to return to exactly the same job: instead they might be offered a \"similar\" position.\n\n\n\nOther concessions limit to three the number of requests for leave or changes to previously agreed patterns.\n\nThey also encourage staff to give early notification of leave plans and allow employers to ask for leave to be taken \nin a continuous block.\n\nThe British Chambers of Commerce said it thought members would be satisfied, while the CBI and Federation of \nSmall Businesses said they were pleased the government had listened to companies' concerns. But the IoD said \nthe proposed system was \"considerably more complex and unwieldy than the current laws\".\n\nThe EEF manufacturers' organisation was supportive, but said it was \"still concerned by proposals about the right to \nreturn to the same job, as employees' roles can change frequently when companies need to make significant \nchanges to their business.\"\n\nThe question of employment rights has been one of the most divisive issues in the coalition.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Ericsson said it would fully \nco-operate with the CCI \"to reach a fair and reasonable conclusion\".\n\nEricsson's legal battle with Micromax has some similarities to one of Samsung's patent lawsuits against Apple. \nSamsung had sued Apple in Europe for allegedly infringing its 3G wireless technology. In that case, the European \nCommission probed Samsung's use of its patents and concluded that the South Korean company abused its \ndominant position in its deployment of patent injunctions.\n\nSamsung reached a provisional antitrust deal with the commission in September that includes legally binding \npromises on how it will treat licensees that have no choice but to use essential patents, including a clearer definition \nof when that licensee should be seen as willing to negotiate fair payment terms.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

He is \nespecially interested in hiring ethnically Chinese Londoners for his new HQ.\n\n\"Chinese are genetically diligent and hard-working but if they have been given a complete European education then \nthey also have good breeding and manners,\" he said.\n\nFor the docks rejuvenation project, Mr Xu plans to borrow about two-thirds of the \u00a31bn investment from UK and \nChinese banks and says he will tap investors or use his own money for the rest.\n\nHe intends to sell about half the units in Royal Docks to Chinese companies and says he has already signed letters \nof intent with 13, with expressions of interest from 50 or so others. When asked what he will do if he cannot \nconvince enough Chinese companies to fill the development, he says the word \"if\" is not in his vocabulary.\n\nIn stark contrast to Mr Xu, the Chinese tycoon behind a plan to redevelop London's Crystal Palace is more elusive. \nAfter repeated requests for interviews, a spokesperson for Ni Zhaoxing, founder of ZhongRong Holdings, said he \ncould not be reached for comment because he was inspecting a mine outside China and had no mobile phone \nreception.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The sale is the latest sign that \ninvestor demand for high-yielding assets is helping banks and insurance companies unwind previous real estate \nlosses.\n\nThe Aviva portfolio is comprised largely of commercial and retail-related property and covers about 135 assets. It is \ntwice as big as the set of industrial property assets that Royal Bank of Scotland brought to market last month.\n\nA deal would mark the second big transaction between Aviva and Apollo in recent months. The private equity group \ncontrols Athene Holding, which last month completed the purchase of the UK insurer's US arm for \u00a31.7bn.\n\nNew York-based Apollo looks to have fought off competition from other prospective buyers, including other private-\nequity houses, after being named the preferred bidder this week in what was a relatively speedy six-week sales \nprocess.\n\nApollo's real estate group has assets under management of about $9.3bn. The private equity group, which \nspecialises in distressed debt, was founded by Leon Black in 1990.\n\n\n\nHowever, the people familiar with the matter said that no final deal had been sealed and the transaction was subject \nto due diligence.\n\nAviva appointed Jones Lang LaSalle to advise on the sale, known as Project Moon. It is the first time since the \nfinancial crisis that the insurer has brought such assets to market.\n\nThe sale by the insurer comes after several lenders - including RBS, Lloyds Banking Group and Co-operative Bank \n- have disposed of parts of their distressed property portfolios over the past couple of years.\n\nAbout \u00a34bn of Aviva's total \u00a38.4bn UK property portfolio is underperforming. The insurer has set aside \u00a31.5bn of \nprovisions for losses on it.\n\nThe group disclosed in the summer that \u00a33.1bn of loans had loan-to-value ratios of more than 100 per cent and \n\u00a3493m of them were in arrears.\n\n\"There has been a rise in impairments, restructuring of loans and requests for forbearance,\" Aviva said in its half-\nyear accounts in August.\n\n\"These relate to loans made before the current financial downturn, with particular exposure to the retail sector in the \nnorth of England.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Anne-Sylvaine Chassany\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Although he was declared a fugitive from \njustice by the US courts in 2009, he had been working openly as chief executive of Reuss Private Group, which \nhandles assets of SFr4bn ($4.4bn). Reuss is based in the Swiss canton of Schwyz.\n\nA 2009 US indictment accused Mr Weil and other bankers of aiding the tax evasion between 2002 and 2007, \nhelping UBS gain EUR200m in revenues from 17,000 US clients.\n\nAlso in 2009, UBS paid a $780m settlement for its role in abetting tax evasion and handed over the names of 4,450 \nUS clients in a deal that presaged a wider European and US crackdown on the country's bank secrecy.\n\nUBS declined to comment.\n\nMr Weil's lawyer, Aaron R Marcu of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in New York, said: \"Mr Weil agreed to \nextradition to the US because he has always been prepared to confront these charges.\n\n\"He lives and works in his native Switzerland, where he was when he was indicted in 2008, and he has never run or \ntried to hide. We expect him to be fully vindicated when we have the opportunity to present our case to a fair and \nimpartial jury.\" Mr Weil has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nUnder Swiss laws, a suspect has to consent to an extradition.

The investment has been championed by UK Trade and Industry.\n\nStella Shiu, Sam Wa's chairman, was declared bankrupt by a Hong Kong court in 2008, after which she changed \nher name, it has emerged. Several companies registered on the Chinese mainland under her previous name have \nsince been dissolved.\n\nRichard Ottaway, chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, told the FT: \"UKTI has got to justify its actions, it \nhas got to explain why it recommended investment from this group.\"\n\nThe deal between Peel Holdings, the company leading the Wirral redevelopment, and Ms Shiu's company was \noriginally signed in the presence of senior UKTI officials, including Lord Green, who was then the trade minister. It \nwas touted as an example of the kind of deal that is being promoted by Mr Cameron as he focuses Britain's \nrelationship with China firmly on securing trade between the two countries.\n\nThe prime minister will travel to China next week for the first time since the new Chinese leadership took over, \nending a year-long diplomatic stand-off over his decision to meet the Dalai Lama in 2012.\n\nHe will take a large trade delegation with him, including dozens of executives from blue-chip companies and others \nfrom small and medium-sized businesses.\n\n&lt;\n\nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience \ncaused.\n\n&gt;But the trip comes amid mounting concern that Britain is so keen to sign new deals that it is failing to carry out \nenough due diligence on prospective investors.\n\nOne of the biggest projects to have attracted Chinese backing is a \u00a31bn property development in London's \ndocklands. But Advanced Business Park, a Chinese company planning an office complex on the site, has only one \ncompleted project to its name: a development located on the far outskirts of Beijing in the city's least affluent \ndistrict.\n\nJohn Spellar, a Labour member of the all party group on China, told the FT: \"UKTI and the Foreign Office have to \nbe careful and undertake due diligence to make sure of the bona fides and assets of any potential investors.\"\n\nSenior diplomats in China believe Britain may be going too far in trying to encourage inward investment into the \ncountry.\n\n\"Total capitulation\" was the way one senior Beijing-based Asian diplomat described Britain's climbdown over the \nDalai Lama debacle.\n\n\"The whole situation has been poorly handled - 18 months ago Mr Cameron was the great defender of human \nrights speaking truth to China and saying the UK will act on principle but now it seems to be about business and \nnothing else,\" said Kerry Brown, an associate fellow at Chatham House and a former British diplomat.\n\n&lt;&gt;\"There's a strong case to engage with serious Chinese companies and to welcome their investment but \nsome of the companies people like Boris Johnson are talking to have no record abroad at all. It all seems extremely \nunsophisticated.\"\n\n\n\nOne senior European diplomat said it was clear from internal European meetings that Britain had downgraded \nhuman rights as an issue when dealing with China, a move which has made it harder for other countries to talk \ntough on the subject.\n\nMost of the dozen or so senior diplomats who spoke to the FT on the matter said Britain's willingness to downgrade \nhuman rights was unlikely to help it in dealing with Beijing, which would only sense weakness in London's about-\nface.\n\nAnother European diplomat said that by agreeing to allow more Chinese investment in its telecoms, nuclear and \nbanking sectors as a way of getting back in Beijing's good graces, the UK had given far more than any other \nEuropean country would consider.\n\n\"It certainly appears that they have sold the store and what are they actually getting in return?\" asked one senior \ndiplomat in Asia.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Around 15 new \ndistilleries are planned, under construction or in the early stages of production, said Gavin Hewitt, chief executive of \nthe Scotch Whisky Association.\n\nThe value of Scottish whisky exports increased by 11 per cent to almost \u00a32bn in the first six months of this year \ncompared with the same period in 2012, SWA data shows.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Financial Times, Ian Curle, Edrington chief executive, said whisky demand would \ncontinue to be driven by the twin engine of growing populations and expanding wealth in Asia, Latin America and \nAfrica.\n\n\"There are millions of new consumers, with higher income levels, emerging.

An error equally shared by Alex Salmond, \nleader of the Scottish National party. In modern history there are many examples, such as Czechoslovakia, Poland, \nthe post-second world war exodus, Bosnia, Chechnya and Slovenia, where peoples have sought an independent \nnation that would encompass their national or religious identities, regardless of the negative economic \nconsequences. Importantly, all these peoples were aware of the possible consequences of achieving their desires. \nThe same should hold true for Scotland and its people.\n\nTherein lies the fundamental flaw in the SNP's argument: the unnecessary linking of independence with a better \neconomic future - not that the SNP's white paper adequately explains how a better post-independence prosperity \nshall be accomplished. Instead of issuing a white paper that is more intended to build castles in Spain than industry \non the Clyde, Mr Salmond should simply state that \"as Scots, we want to be independent, come what may\" and let \nhis fellow Scots decide. If independence is that important to them, they will vote Yes, even if it means giving up the \npound and other financial benefits that the Union brings. If independence is not that important to them, they will vote \nNo.\n\nStan Trybulski, Branford, CT, US\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

First, from economists (to sound of air \nsucked through teeth): the US will grow less than thought, at 2.6 per cent, down from a prediction of 2.8 per cent in \nJanuary, according to Consensus Economics' survey.\n\nSecond, from the stock market (with the Flying Lizards' hit \"Money\" playing loudly in the background): all's good! \nThe S&P 500 is up 26 per cent, the Russell 2000 index of smaller company shares is up 34 per cent and the \noutlook for the economy has improved.\n\nThird, what Dr Copper says (cue Darth Vader theme): Copper is known as the only metal with a PhD thanks to the \ntight link between its price and the state of the world economy, and its latest prognosis is grim. Copper has dropped \n11 per cent this year and is down almost a third from its 2011 peak. Other base metals have seen similar moves, as \nindustrial demand weakened and mines expanded.\n\nThose of a bullish persuasion will dismiss copper and other base metals as a useless guide. Prices are being driven \ndown by a glut after over-investment by the miners. Equities, meanwhile, lead the economy and - while admittedly \n\n\n\nnot perfect - are a better guide to what will happen than a bunch of econometric models projecting current \nconditions into the future.\n\nBears can point to the close ties between world shares and copper up until late last year. This year's divergence is \nthe most significant since 2006-07, when copper fell by a third in nine months while world shares carried on up. \nCopper rebounded, but the plunge offered a glimpse of the chaotic markets soon to come.\n\nAlternatively, metals may merely have repriced to reflect slower growth in China, the biggest user of industrial \nmetals. Equities might be floating on a sea of liquidity injected by central banks and tell us next to nothing about the \noutlook for profits or the wider economy. In this case, both tell us as little as the economists' models.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

GrainCorp owns 280 grain \nstorage facilities and seven of the eight ports that ship grain in bulk from the nation's east coast.\n\nMr Hockey's decision to block the deal is a blow to ADM. Although it is one of the world's biggest traders of \nagricultural commodities the company is looking to diversify its assets beyond the US. After an unprecedented \n\n\n\nwave of consolidation in the agricultural trading sector, GrainCorp was one of the few remaining assets of size and \nclose to fast-growing markets in Asia.\n\nADM agreed to pay GrainCorp shareholders A$12.20 per share in cash, plus a one-time A$1.00-per-share special \ndividend.\n\nMr Hockey said he had decided not to cap ADM's investment in GrainCorp, which currently stands at 19.85 per \ncent.\n\n\"In fact, to encourage ADM to demonstrate its commitment to the Australian grains industry through its continued \ninvestment in GrainCorp, I am inclined, based on current circumstances, to approve any proposals from ADM to \nincrease its shareholding in GrainCorp up to an interest of 24.9 per cent.\"\n\nIn a statement ADM said it would look to work with GrainCorp to \"maximise returns on our investment and create \nvalue for both companies\".\n\nPatrica Woertz, chairman and chief executive, said: \"Throughout this process, we worked constructively to create \nan arrangement that would be in Australia's best interests and made substantial commitments to address issues \nthat were important to stakeholders.\"\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Such lower costs are caused in part by a lower \nwelfare net in many such countries, and the profits from such investments flow chiefly back to the investor: in other \nwords, the British company. The dividends are then presumably taxed in the UK and flow back to the Treasury. Yet \nat the same time David Cameron, the British prime minister, wishes to curtail the freedom of the citizens of those \ncountries to travel to, and work in, the UK (\"Free movement within Europe needs to be less free\", November 27).\n\nIn other words, it appears to be acceptable to exploit and profit from their lower wages on Bulgarian and Romanian \nsoil but not to allow those people to improve their wages on UK soil.\n\nDoes the word \"imperialism\" spring to the mind of anyone other than me?\n\nLorenz Jorgensen, Saffron Walden, Essex, UK\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

This may sound counter-intuitive, but it is true.\n\nThe practice of so-called dark trading is not new to equity markets, but the phenomenon has certainly flourished as \nmarkets have embraced electronic trading. Originally, dark pools were set up to meet a demand from large \ninstitutions to trade in large blocs and avoid the disproportionate market impact of their trading activities in the \"lit \nmarkets\", ie traditional stock exchanges.\n\nIt is true that the majority of dark pools that exist today offer no value above and beyond what can be found on \nexchanges. And they should be regulated as they have been very effectively in other countries without harming the \nend investors. But not all dark pools are the same, and to cap the activity of other trading venues, irrespective of \n\n\n\nthe value they provide for long-term investors, is irresponsible and goes against the stated objective of the \nregulation, which is to protect the end investor.\n\nPolicy makers in Europe could do worse than look to Australia and Canada for a solution. These jurisdictions have \nintroduced a price improvement condition for dark-pool trading. This has proved sufficient to return enough trading \nactivity to the lit equity markets while at the same time ensuring that large pension-fund investors can continue to \nexecute on their investment decisions and generate performance for end investors without being targeted by \npredatory traders that operate on the lit markets.\n\nThe irony that policy makers in Europe are looking to restrict trading activity at a time when long-term investors are \nreturning to Europe's equity markets is not lost on everyone. Europe's listed companies, the engine of the economic \nrecovery, stand to lose the most.\n\nSeth Merrin, Founder and CEO, Liquidnet, New York, NY, US\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Some Americans may still be too full later today to think about chicken, pork and beef - and don't even \nmention turkey. But US poultry producers are clucking, and for good reason. Last year, they endured a severe \ndrought in the Midwestern part of the country. The price of corn - a key component of feed - spiked above $8 a \nbushel in 2012. It has since fallen back to half that, and the US will harvest a record crop this autumn.\n\nLower grain costs factored into the positive outlook at Hormel Foods, which this week said it expects earnings per \nshare in 2014 to rise by as much as 16 per cent. Hormel processes turkey and pork and manufactures packaged \nfoods such as Spam and Dinty Moore stew. Now is a good time to be in the turkey business. As input costs have \nfallen, so have production levels (242m birds in 2013 versus 254m, according to the USDA). That bodes well for \npricing. But it is not all good news down on the farm. The outlook for hogs is less clear - a virus has created \nuncertainty. Still, in 2013, Hormel also bought Skippy brand peanut butter, which it expects will bump up earnings \nper share by a mid-single digit percentage next year.\n\nInvestors are already reaping gains. Shares of Hormel have risen 50 per cent over the past year as prospects \nimproved. At $45, the stock trades at 20 times next year's earnings. Fellow meat producers Tyson Foods (chicken, \nbeef and pork) and Pilgrim's Pride (chicken), which have also rallied sharply, trade at 12 and 9 times, respectively. \nThe latter two are more pure commodity plays versus Hormel, which is a diversified seller of branded products. That \njustifies some premium. Hormel's earnings multiple was also higher than the median (17x) over the past 10 years. \nHere, too, expansion is warranted given growth expectations and the addition of Skippy.\n\nBut at these prices, Hormel, is starting to look a bit stuffed, too.\n\nEmail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

So implies the country's treasurer, Joe Hockey, after some \nheavy lobbying by the kangaroo itself, Qantas. The flag carrier's shares bounced on Mr Hockey's musings about \nQantas's ownership. Yet a debate about the airline is a political slugfest that does little to ease its path right now.\n\nQantas's problems are a perennial topic for national debate. Ownership is one of the issues. The state does not \nown any of the airline but under the 1992 Qantas Sale Act, foreigners cannot own more than 49 per cent of it and \nforeign airlines, in total, cannot hold more than 35 per cent. Overseas capital is thus deterred. Its outrage, then, is \nunderstandable as it watches three foreign state-backed airlines plan to raise their stakes in Virgin Australia, its \ndomestic rival, to 70 per cent via a A$350m cash call. Add to that Virgin's aggressive capacity expansion which is \nhurting Qantas's yields, and anyone would be hopping.\n\nmailto:lex@ft.com\n\n\nQantas's domestic unit produced 30 per cent more pre-tax profits than the group did over the past two years, \nunderlining its key role in patching over heavy international losses. It must hurt watching Virgin burn through cash - \nA$425m in the in the 12 months to June - and turn to Etihad, Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand, all Qantas \nrivals overseas, for a top-up. The fight makes it harder for Qantas to rely on home profits to support its overseas \nrestructuring and it will divert management attention. Regulators have been called on to examine issues ranging \nfrom how Qantas uses its home heft - it has about two-thirds of the market - to whether Virgin's cash call is a \nforeign takeover in disguise. Mr Hockey said Qantas's \"regulatory handcuffs\" mean Aussies should either step up \nand fund the airline, or allow overseas investors to do so. It is hard to see either wanting to stump up until this \nbattle is resolved.\n\nEmail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Neither \ncountry notified Beijing of the surveillance operations which took place in recent days.\n\n\"They [the Japanese jets] are carrying out surveillance activity as before in the East China Sea, including the zone,\" \nJapan's chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Thursday.\n\n\"We are not going to change this out of consideration to China,\" he added, without saying how often Japanese \nmilitary aircraft had entered the air defence zone since it was unilaterally announced by Beijing on Saturday. Under \nthe restrictions China had insisted that any aircraft travelling through the zone - covering an area including a chain \nof islands in the East China Sea controlled by Japan but claimed by Beijing - had to inform China.\n\nThe South Korean flight on Tuesday was a regular surveillance mission over a submerged rock where Seoul has a \nscientific research centre, but to which China also lays claim, the defence ministry in Seoul said.\n\nChina has said the creation of the zone - which overlaps with the corresponding Japanese and South Korean zones \n- was a \"legitimate action\" and not targeted at any one country, although it has stirred up opposition across the \nregion and drawn sharp criticism from the US.\n\nAt a meeting in Seoul on Thursday, Chinese military officials rejected calls from South Korean officials to reconsider \nthe defence zone, according to Seoul's defence ministry.\n\n\"Japan and the US should carefully reflect upon and immediately correct their mistakes,\" a Chinese foreign \nministry spokesman said on Thursday. \"They should stop their irresponsible accusations against China and refrain \nfrom remarks and actions that harm regional stability.\"\n\nThe Japanese and South Korean surveillance missions came after the US sent a pair of B-52 bombers through the \nair defence zone on Tuesday. On Wednesday Japanese airlines also began flouting the rules laid down by Beijing, \nwhich demand that aircraft notify it before passing through the area.\n\nWilliam Fallon, a former head of US Pacific Command, warned on Wednesday that the Chinese zone would raise \nthe potential for an accidental conflict.\n\n\"It is another stick on the fire, and absolutely unnecessary,\" said Mr Fallon. \"If you send up fighters, it is another \nopportunity for people to screw up.\"\n\nUS vice-president Joe Biden will tell Chinese leaders on a trip to Beijing next week that the establishment of an air \ndefence zone is \"unsettling\" to its neighbours and raises questions about its broader international behaviour.\n\nAdditional reporting by Mitsuko Matsutani in Tokyo, Geoff Dyer in Washington, Demetri Sevastopulo in Hong Kong \nand Tom Mitchell in Beijing\n\nmailto:lex@ft.com\n\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

A transaction last week - Devon Energy's $6bn \nacquisition of high quality energy assets in the Eagle Ford area of Texas - has sparked hopes of a dealmaking \nrevival. Yet persistently low natural gas prices and years of excessive investment have forced more disciplined \ncapital allocation among onshore-focused energy producers. So despite the pricey terms Devon agreed to in this \ndeal, it is hard to imagine more tie-ups at such valuations being struck in such a conservative climate.\n\nOne approach to developing energy resources is to bet on exploring in unproven areas and hope that it works out. \nDevon took the opposite tack in the deal, buying $6bn of mostly oil assets from private equity-backed GeoSouthern \nEnergy. The assets include 83,000 acres in the Eagle Ford shale deposit. Those assets currently produce just \n53,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, but 400m barrels are estimated to be recoverable. And most of that \nqualifies as proved reserves. Output is to ramp quickly.\n\nAs such, Devon's purchase price is just 2.5 times estimated 2015 operating cash flow. But as certain as the oil \nbeneath the earth may be, it is not cheap to get to it. Credit Suisse estimates that Devon will need $6bn in capital \nexpenditure over six years. The deal boosts Devon's net asset value by about 5 per cent, around how much its \nshares rose after the announcement.\n\nAnother measure of the high price paid is the value put on the undeveloped acreage acquired. Morningstar \ncalculates that the price per acre is $50,000, exceeding previous highs of around $30,000.\n\nApart from the Devon deal, US oil and gas transaction volume has slowed considerably. And while the \nGeoSouthern terms are not quite the home run that management has depicted, Devon's bosses have run their \nbusiness well enough to pull off an aggressive if modestly profitable acquisition.\n\nThe dearth of other landmark transactions confirms that this is quite an accomplishment.\n\nEmail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The fee on the \nFLS scheme for corporate lending has also been cut.\n\nThe BoE's Financial Policy Committee welcomed the changes to the FLS scheme while the Monetary Policy \nCommittee judged that the move did not constitute a tightening of monetary policy.\n\nmailto:lex@ft.com\n\n\nIn his letter to Mr Osborne, the BoE governor said: \"We should refocus the FLS so that it continues to support \nlending to the business sector, without adding further broad support to household lending at a time when that is no \nlonger necessary\".\n\nThe chancellor responded that because lending to small companies remained muted, it was \"very important\" the \njoint Treasury/BoE scheme \"continues to support lending to businesses and provides strong incentives to small and \nmedium sized lending in particular\".\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

The anti-tobacco lobby will \nproduce data proving why it is an effective way to cut smoking. And tobacco companies will produce data proving \nwhy it is not. Expect both to be in evidence over the next four months as the UK considers whether to introduce the \nmeasure.\n\nAustralia is the only market which has enforced plain packaging so far. It has been in place for about a year. \nSupporters will point to a study by Cancer Council Victoria, published in the British Medical Journal. It shows that \npeople smoking from plain packs were more likely to think about quitting that those smoking from branded packs. \nOpponents say the measure has done nothing to affect smoking overall, other than driving trade to the black \nmarket. They will point to a study from KPMG - commissioned by tobacco companies - which says that illicit \ntobacco has grown from 11.8 per cent of the Australian market in 2012 to 13.3 per cent in the first half of 2013.\n\nAside from potentially driving volumes to the black market, one of the biggest concerns for the tobacco companies \nwould be prices and margins. The absence of branding could convince smokers of premium cigarettes to trade \ndown. Imperial Tobacco, which has a 45 per cent UK market share, would be most exposed. According to \nBerenberg, a fifth of its profits come from the UK. At Japan Tobacco the proportion is half of that.\n\nPlain packaging in the UK would be bad news for the industry, but it could cope with the consequences. A bigger \nthreat would be the chance that regulators elsewhere consider making the same move. Volumes in developed \nmarkets have been falling for some time, but emerging markets have compensated for that. If Asia were to start to \nthink about plain packaging, there would be very good reason for the industry to worry.\n\nEmail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.

Putting further firepower behind the banks \nthrough FLS to make more finance available and at a lower cost should provide a further spur to lending, which is \nstill challenging for many SMEs despite recent improvements.\"\n\nShe added: \"With the recovery in business investment still weak, getting credit flowing to business is critical to \nturning this round.\"\n\nJohn Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said it was \"a surprising yet refreshing \nannouncement, which will make a difference to lending to thousands of our members and millions of small firms. It \nis something the FSB has raised with the governor of the Bank of England and he is clearly listening\".\n\nMr Allan said it was encouraging that Mark Carney, Bank of England governor, had recognised the contribution \nsmall firms make to job creation and that the real economy had been given priority over the housing market, which \nis receiving assistance in other areas such as Help to Buy.\n\nmailto:lex@ft.com\n\n\n\"FLS has already helped reduce the cost of finance for businesses. What we now need is to see a focus on \nincreasing the number of firms getting access to the finance they need to grow,\" he added.\n\nJohn Longworth, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the move showed that the \ngovernment and the BoE recognised the difficulties faced by businesses in accessing finance.\n\n\"The real test for Funding for Lending has always been whether it is able to get credit flowing to young and fast-\ngrowing firms and unfortunately any improvement in credit availability is only being felt by 'safe bets', while young, \nfast-growing firms continue to struggle to find the finance they need to expand,\" he said.\n\nMr Longworth added: \"Policy makers need to go further to help new and growing companies by delivering a British \nBusiness Bank with far more scale than under the government's current proposals.\"\n\nThe Treasury and the BoE increased the incentives to lend to SMEs under the scheme earlier this year, by \nincreasing the amount of cheap finance banks could access. The fee banks pay will now be cut to the lowest point \non the FLS scale.\n\nLending volumes to small and medium-sized enterprises have fallen by nearly a quarter to \u00a3170bn since their 2009 \npeak, according to a report for Royal Bank of Scotland by Sir Andrew Large, former BoE deputy governor.\n\nThe Bank's latest data showed that net lending to businesses fell by \u00a32.3bn in the three months to August and \ncontracted across all sizes of company.\n\nAccording to an EEF survey, more manufacturing companies are seeking finance to invest, but at a price. \nBusinesses, especially smaller ones, reported that the cost of finance was going up.\n\nMichael Saunders, an economist at Citi, said: \"We suspect the government will do more to encourage SME lending \nin the Autumn Statement.\"\n\nSir Andrew's report drew attention to structural problems in the business lending market.\n\nAndrew Bailey, head of the Prudential Regulatory Authority, said there had been a substantial change in the \nmechanics and capacity of mortgage lending, but the capacity and mechanics of lending to small and medium-sized \nbusinesses may have fallen behind.\n\nAndy Haldane, the BoE's executive director for financial stability, said the Financial Policy Committee, the new \nstability regulator, would examine Sir Andrew's suggestion of a credit registry to pool information on SMEs.\n\n\"It's a difficult market to get into because all of the credit history and information on the SMEs is stored in the \nincumbent, it's not generally available,\" Mr Haldane said.\n\nA registry could be used to \"bundle SME loans, and package them for onward sale, in other words to create \nsecuritisation market for SMEs. Which I think would be really positive as a second channel for SME bank financing,\" \nhe said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Claire Jones\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Regulators \nand monetary authorities have so far been content to allow such currencies, but have pressured exchanges and \nbrokers to introduce the same money-laundering checks as traditional financial institutions.\n\nA European Central Bank study last year conlcuded virtual currencies were too small to worry about yet, but their \ngrowth should be monitored lest they start to threaten financial stability.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Ltd.
