{"title": "Kennedy Airport Should Beckon Foreign Visitors", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nSerious consideration should be given to your editorial ''Traveler's Raid'' (July 20), about the proposal by the \nImmigration Service to provide more inspections at Kennedy Airport by taxing foreign visitors and immigrants. \nWhy should they have to pay for that service?\n\nAll this is reminiscent of how travelers at J.F.K. once had to pay 50 cents to ride the frequently overcrowded airline \nconnection buses. Imagine the frustration of foreign visitors who did not have the exact fare required even though \nthey had already exchanged some of their own currency for dollars.\n\nThose same buses also used to waste much travel time by waiting at each of the terminals to fill before proceeding. \nBecause of this, passengers could miss a connecting flight, as once happened to me, even though I had an hour to \nmake my connection. Consequently, I wrote a letter to the Port Authority about this matter (as I imagine many other \npeople also did), and soon after bus service was free and more efficient (although the airport needs a more \nmodern system for moving people).\n\nWe may not realize it, but J.F.K. could be a symbol of welcome and hope to those who arrive from abroad, just as \nthe Statue of Liberty was to the many people who came to this country by ship. It is the main aerial gateway to our \ncountry, just as New York Harbor was the gateway for ships. Surely, many foreign visitors who come here for the \nfirst time base their impressions of both New York and the United States on the kind of reception they get at the \nairport. Surely, they deserve to be treated with the same kind of courtesy, respect and understanding that we \nAmericans demand when we travel abroad. Rather than looking for ways to take their money, we should try to \nmake them feel welcome.\n\n \n\nT. J. KLEIN\n\nGroton, Conn., Aug. 8, 1986\n"}
