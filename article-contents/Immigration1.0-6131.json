{"title": "Smuggling Death Toll May Drop", "body": "\nThe death toll in last weekend's Haitian immigrant smuggling disaster may be far lower than the 40 originally \nfeared to have drowned, U.S. authorities said today.\n\nDan Geoghegan, assistant chief in the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami Sector headquarters, said survivors of the \ndisaster had changed their stories and reported that one boat, not two, had sunk during a smuggling run on \nSaturday.\n\nOriginally, survivors had told the Border Patrol that two boats traveled together from the western Bahamas to \nFlorida, carrying a total of more than 40 people. A death toll of 40 would have made this smuggling disaster the \nworst known to have occurred off Florida, U.S. Coast Guard and Customs officials said.\n\n\"The good news would be that actually there was only one boat and fewer people died,\" said Geoghegan.\n\nThe Coast Guard rescued three Haitians from the Atlantic Ocean between the Bahamas and Florida on Saturday, \nand found the bodies of two others.\n\nBut officials said it was too early to know for sure whether fewer people had died. Smugglers usually order the \nimmigrants they carry to tell conflicting stories if they are caught, authorities cautioned.\n\nGeoghegan said another interview was scheduled with a survivor who has been hospitalized since the accident. \nAuthorities hope to know more after that discussion.\n"}
