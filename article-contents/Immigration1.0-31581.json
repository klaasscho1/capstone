{"title": "MetroILLEGAL IMMIGRATION; Sharpton leads rally against new law", "body": "\nOpponents of Georgia's tough illegal immigration law descended on the state Capitol on Saturday afternoon for a \nrally headlined by the Rev. Al Sharpton.\n\nMore than five charter buses emptied out several hundred people for the nearly one-hour downtown Atlanta rally, \nwhere Sharpton and other speakers said House Bill 87 violates civil and human rights and will lead to racial \nprofiling.\n\n\"America's got to work for everybody or it doesn't work for anybody,\" Sharpton said. \"Immigration is a federal \npolicy and it must remain on a federal level with federal enforcement.\"\n\nThe law's supporters say Georgia is just upholding federal immigration laws. The new rules will prevent illegal \nimmigrants from burdening the state's taxpayer-funded public schools, hospitals and jails, proponents say.\n\nWhile a federal judge has blocked two provisions of the law, other parts went into effect July 1.\n\nAmong those in effect are rules saying people who use false information or documentation to get a job could face \nup to 15 years in prison and up to $250,000 in fines. The law also creates a panel to investigate complaints about \nlocal and state government officials who fail to enforce the new rules.\n\nJust as the legal battles will continue, so will the rallies. Sharpton and others told the crowd they must return and \ncontinue the protests. Saturday's rally included members of the American Federation of State County and \nMunicipal Employees.\n\nGeorgia's Hispanic population has almost doubled over the past decade to 865,689 people, according to 2010 \ncensus figures.\n\nEstimates of the state's illegal immigration population vary, with the respected Pew Hispanic Center putting the \nfigure last year at about 425,000.\n\n"}
