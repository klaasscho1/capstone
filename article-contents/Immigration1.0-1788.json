{"title": "Immigration Rider Touches Nerve", "body": "\nNearly half the members of the Senate yesterday urged congressional negotiators to oppose an immigration bill \nprovision allowing states to expel illegal immigrant children from school.\n\nThe 47 senators, nearly all Democrats, said that inclusion of the provision could jeopardize enactment of major \nlegislation dealing with illegal immigration.\nIn a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), the senators called the provision ill-\nadvised and said it would do nothing to reduce illegal immigration.\n\nSeparately, Senate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.) said in letters to Majority Leader Robert J. Dole \n(R-Kan.) and his deputy and likely successor, Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.), that the opposition of the senators and the \nadministration made clear the Senate would not pass a bill with the school provision. The votes of 60 of the 100 \nsenators are needed to cut off a filibuster.\n\nBoth the House and Senate have passed bills to clamp down on illegal immigration but only the House version \nwould permit expulsion of illegal immigrant children from school. The two bills have to be reconciled by a House-\nSenate conference committee.\n\n\"Aliens do not come to this country illegally to educate their children in U.S. public schools,\" the 47 senators, led by \nSen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), said in the letter to Hatch.\n\n\"Giving authority to states to expel children from public schools will not deter illegal immigration, but it will lead to a \nrange of other problems if these innocent children are out of school and on the streets.\"\n"}
