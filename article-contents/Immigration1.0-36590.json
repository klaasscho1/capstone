{"title": "Even Citizens Can Need Immigration Counseling;Out of the Frying Pan", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nAs an attorney specializing in immigration law, I can attest that ''A Hotel Hell for Refugees,'' Arthur C. Helton's \narticle (Op-Ed, Sept. 23) about a hotel at Kennedy International Airport used as a detention facility by the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, is completely accurate. I should like, however, to add one further point.\n\nThe aliens who are being detained in these appalling conditions are the least likely to complain to authorities. This \nis because, if their cases are not meritorious, they will be shipped out of the country. On the other hand, if, as with a \nclient of mine, the case is meritorious, there is a great reluctance by the alien or his family to make waves and \ncomplain when they are seeking affirmative relief from the Government.\n\nIn our case, it was only with the utmost reluctance that the family agreed to approach the Government about the \nsubhuman conditions under which their relative was being held.\n\nThis situation is particularly ironic because many of these people are seeking political asylum. Their treatment in \nthis facility, however, is not much better than in any oppressive regime from which they are escaping. My client is a \nfree man today in this land that has finally agreed to give him refuge, but what a nightmarish and truly un-American \nintroduction he has had to our coun-try.\n\n \n\nJOANNA MILLER BUKSZPAN\n\n  New York, Sept. 25, 1987\n"}
