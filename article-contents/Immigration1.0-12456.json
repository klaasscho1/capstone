Despite suggestions that the end\n\n of Schengen is nigh or arguments that there is a need to get \u2018back to Schengen\u2019,\n\n the research demonstrates that Schengen is alive and well and that border controls\n\n have, at least formally, complied with the legal framework.

Some EU Member States (MS) reacted to the increase in entries by\n\n asylum seekers by re-introducing internal border controls. On 12 May 2016 the Council\n\n adopted a decision allowing five Member States - Germany, Austria, Denmark, Norway and\n\n Sweden - to continue internal border checks on the basis of structural and \u201cserious\n\n deficiencies\u201d in the external border management system in Greece, which \u201cput at risk the\n\n overall functioning of the area without internal border control\u201d. These developments have\n\n fuelled discussions about Schengen being \u2018in crisis\u2019, with some voices even referring to \u2018the\n\n end of Schengen\u2019 or calling for the scrapping of the border-free area.\n\n Against this backdrop, the current study examines the following questions:\n\n \u2022 Is this rhetoric justified? Is the current Schengen governance system crisis-proof?\n\n \u2022 Is Schengen\u2019s legal framework being effectively implemented and how could it be\n\n improved?\n\n \u2022 Is legislative reform needed?\n\n \u2022 How can we ensure more effective supervision, evaluation and democratic\n\n accountability of Schengen standards?\n\n\n\n The study focuses on the implementation dynamics and challenges experienced in the\n\n operability of the post-2013 Schengen governance framework in the light of the abovementioned\n\n developments. The study provides a legal assessment of its implementation and\n\n sets out concrete policy recommendations to improve Schengen governance.\n\n How did the 2013 Schengen governance reform come about?\n\n It was a 2011 dispute between France and Italy that demonstrated the need for a\n\n strengthened Community method in the Schengen evaluation and monitoring mechanism\n\n and the use of exceptions. The previous intergovernmental governance framework had\n\n proved ineffective in addressing the 2011 Franco-Italian affair and guaranteeing the\n\n protection of \u2018the spirit of Schengen\u2019. After the reform of 2013, the European Commission\n\n gained more scrutiny powers in assessing MS\u2019 compliance with the Schengen Borders Code\n\n as well as in assessing the proportionality, necessity and impact of the reintroduction of\n\n internal borders on fundamental rights and freedom of movement. The European Parliament\n\n acquired access to the results of Schengen evaluations and some scrutiny powers in both\n\n Schengen evaluations and the reintroduction of internal border checks procedures. (See\n\n Section 2 of this Study)\n\n What were the main innovations of the Schengen governance framework?\n\n The Schengen Borders Code (SBC) procedures under Articles 26-29, which permit the reintroduction\n\n of internal border controls in exceptional circumstances, had been carefully\n\n crafted to delineate their application. With the 2013 reform, the SBC acquired more detailed\n\n rules on the criteria and time limits for temporary border checks (Articles 25 and 26). In\n\n addition, the new SBC increased accountability by including ex-post reporting obligations and\n\n the bi-annual reports from the Commission to the Council and Parliament. However, the main\n\n\n\n innovation of the new SBC was Article 29, which allowed the reintroduction of internal border\n\n controls for up to two years where \u2018serious deficiencies\u2019 at the external borders are detected.\n\n 1 The authors of this study are critical about the widely used term \u201crefugee crisis\u201d as it does not indicate the roots\n\n of the crisis, though this discussion is out of the scope of the current study.\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 9\n\n The Schengen evaluation and monitoring (SEM) mechanism shifted from being very\n\n intergovernmental towards being more European. Now, the Commission (namely, DG HOME)\n\n is in the driving seat of for the SEM mechanism, and not the Council. Members of the\n\n European Parliament (MEPs) can access the findings of evaluations under the new\n\n confidentiality rules, though practical arrangements limit parliamentary scrutiny. In addition,\n\n there is a lack of transparency on how individual MS influence the final output of the Schengen\n\n evaluations. The new SEM entered into force only in 2015. (See Section 3)\n\n When and how was the Schengen governance reform applied in 2015/2016?\n\n The European refugee crisis has put the 2013 Schengen Governance reform to the test. In\n\n March 2016, the Commission outlined its \u201cBack to Schengen\u201c plan, which referred to the\n\n possibility of using Article 29 of the SBC for prolonging internal border controls. The proposal\n\n came about at a time of huge political pressure, with the maximum eight-month period\n\n provided for under the combined procedures of Articles 28 and 27 of the SBC about to expire\n\n in the five MS applying temporary internal border controls (Austria, Germany, Denmark,\n\n Norway and Sweden), and with a set of new Commission legislative and policy iniatives in\n\n response to the asylum challenge entering inter-institutional negitiations or being applied on\n\n\n\n the ground. (See Section 1)\n\n Schengen Borders Code: formally respected, but not respected \u2018in spirit\u2019\n\n All the MS have reintroduced internal border controls within the scope of the SBC rules.\n\n However, if assessed carefully, none of the notifications satisfy the simple criterion in Article\n\n 26 of making an assessment \u201cregarding likely impacts of any threats to public policy and\n\n internal security\u201d. The European Commission has shied away from consistently applying the\n\n proportionality assessment to MS justifications, and checking their arguments against\n\n evidence. Member States, in their official notifications, cited two main reasons or sources of\n\n threat justifying derogations from the border-free area - \u2018mass migration\u2019/\u2018refugee\n\n movements\u2019 and the \u2018risk of terrorism\u2019. As regards these grounds, this study demonstrates\n\n that there has been a noticeable lack of detail and evidence given by the concerned EU\n\n Member States. For example, there have been no statistics on the numbers of people crossing\n\n borders and seeking asylum, or assessment of the extent to which reintroducting border\n\n checks complies with the principles of proportionality and necessity.\n\n Furthermore, it is striking that the main complaint in the MS notifications was, in essenece,\n\n that Greece had not prevented refugees from arriving in the first instance, and subsequently\n\n that Greece had failed to keep them within its territory. The majority of refugees who arrived\n\n in 2015/16 were entitled to asylum, and could not be \u2018Dublinised\u2019 to Greece due to serious\n\n deficiencies in the asylum system following the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR)\n\n decision in MSS v. Belgium and Greece. Given these refugee arrivals, the MS opted to apply\n\n the Schengen governance framework instead of the Common European Asylum System\n\n (CEAS). The current application of the SBC leaves open the question of how the reintroduction\n\n of internal borders addresses the shortcomings of national asylum and reception systems in\n\n\n\n the EU. (See Sub-Section 4.2)\n\n If we look at the threat of \u2018terrorism\u2019 justification put forward by Malta and France, it remains\n\n unclear whether and how the reintroduction of border controls at internal EU borders would\n\n help in dismantling terrorist networks. (See Sub-Section 4.3)\n\n What is the role of Schengen Evaluation and Monitoring mechanism?\n\n The SEM evaluation was the main source of information triggering Article 29 of the SBC. The\n\n Council Implementing Decision of 12 May 2016 mainly relied on the findings of the\n\n unannounced on-site visit by the Schengen Evaluation Team of Experts on the 10-13\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 10\n\n November 2015. In mid-May 2016, however, the situation was different from the one at the\n\n peak of the crisis - the EU-Turkey Statement had been concluded and the so-called \u2018Balkan\n\n route\u2018blocked. Thus, very few refugees were in fact reaching the five MS that wanted to\n\n continue their internal border controls. For these MS, the main reason for the prolongation\n\n of internal border controls was the \u2018fear\u2019 of \u2018secondary movements\u2019 of refugees from Greece\n\n and the unclear destiny of the EU-Turkey Statement. This study argues that if the \u2018fears\u2019 of\n\n \u2018secondary movements\u2018, without any factual basis, were to be accepted as proportionate and\n\n legitimate reasons, it would undermine the very legal foundations of Schengen. (See Subsection\n\n 4.7. and Section 5)\n\n Where is the line between \u2018border controls\u2019 and legitimate \u2018police checks\u2019?\n\n In addition to the above, several EU Member States have used internal police checks in border\n\n areas for \u2018migration control\u2019 purposes, which seems to be contrary to Article 23 of the SBC\n\n\n\n and recital 26 of the SBC. This study demonstrates that the line between \u2018police checks\u2019 and\n\n \u2018border controls\u2019 is often unclear both in law and in practice. Youth organisations have raised\n\n concerns that reinforced police checks in the border areas are becoming systematic and\n\n discriminatory. (See Sub-Sections 4.8., 4.9. and Annex 4).\n\n In addition, police \u2018function creep\u2019 is seen in the classification of \u2018asylum seekers\u2019 as \u2018irregular\n\n immigrants\u2019 and the fact that they are subsequently subjected to policing measures, such\n\n registration in the Schengen Information System (SIS). Asylum seekers are instead to be\n\n registered to EURODAC and subject to the CEAS, the UN 1951 Geneva Convention and the\n\n Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The study shows that, with a growing\n\n tendency to use internal police checks by some EU MS, these actions should be subject to\n\n greater scrutiny and evaluation to ensure that they are not tantamount to border checks.\n\n The study concludes that, despite the developments of 2015-2016, Schengen is \u2018fit for\n\n purpose\u2019 and here to stay, though many gaps and open questions still need to be addressed.\n\n The following recommendations are made with the aim of addressing them:\n\n \u2022 The Schengen acquis was applied throughout the crisis. Thus, we do not really need\n\n to get \u201cback to Schengen\u201c as we never abandoned it.\n\n \u2022 Recent developments do not justify new legislative reforms of the SBC or the SEM, as\n\n both instruments are too recent. This would negatively affect legal certainty.\n\n \u2022 The Commission should better verify and scrutinise Member States\u2019 justifications\n\n against the proportionality and free movement/fundamental rights test. The\n\n Commission should play its role as guardian of EU law and the treaties and not\n\n mediate among the competing interests of Member States \u2013 this is the role of the\n\n Council.\n\n \u2022 The European Parliament and national parliaments should have better access to\n\n\n\n information and play their role in scrutinising Member State actions, in particular those\n\n affecting fundamental rights.\n\n \u2022 The SEM should not creep into the area of the CEAS. A separate evaluation and\n\n monitoring mechanism on asylum issues should thus be established in accordance\n\n with Article 70 TFEU.\n\n \u2022 Member States should inform the Commission and the Parliament about internal police\n\n checks in border areas. There should be clear guidelines from the Commission in this\n\n area.\n\n \u2022 Upcoming SIS II amendments should include the possibility for an independent\n\n Commission assessment, checking against databases used at internal border areas to\n\n detect \u2018systematic police checks\u2019 at internal borders.\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 11\n\n \u2022 The relationship between the current Frontex risk analysis, the European Border and\n\n Coast Guard vulnerability assessment and the SEM should be better clarified;\n\n \u2022 To ensure fundamental rights compliance and further reporting to the Parliament, as\n\n provided for in recital 14 of the SEM, the FRA should be become a permanent observer\n\n to all SEM missions, including on intenral borders.\n\n \u2022 The role of civil society should be strengthened in the SEM, by allowing independent\n\n shadow reporting.\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 12\n\n 1. INTRODUCTION\n\n 1.1. Background: Refugee crisis in 2015/16\n\n The large number of asylum seekers and the lack of European solidarity at the EU\u2019s external\n\n borders have been said to put the Schengen Area at risk.2 The continuation of the regional\n\n wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and particularly in Syria - where the conflict in in its sixth year and\n\n has seen the devastation of whole cities - has resulted in a bulge in the number of people\n\n seeking asylum in the EU. Against this backdrop, EUROSTAT3 reports that, in 2015, 1.2\n\n million people applied for asylum in the EU, which is about double the 2014 number (see\n\n Figure 1).\n\n Figure 1: Asylum Applications EU-28 1998-2015\n\n Source: Authors.4\n\n The top three nationalities to seek asylum were Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis.5 The distribution\n\n of asylum seekers across the Member States was a matter of some political salience, resulting\n\n in two Council decisions on the relocation of 160,000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece.6\n\n However, these decisions concerned only those asylum seekers with a nationality with a\n\n recognition rate of 75% or over, basically Syria, Eritrea and Iraq. These two decisionshave\n\n not resulted in particularly successful shifts of state responsibility. Indeed, the Commission\n\n indicates that less than 1,600 asylum seekers had been relocated by April 2016 (see Figure\n\n 2 below).\n\n 2 Guild, E., Brouwer, E., Groenendijk, K. and Carrera, S.

Eurostat\n\n data indicates that over the 12-month period, there were 1,256,000 first-time asylum\n\n applications in the EU 28. As Eurostat data indicates, Germany received 441,800 asylum\n\n applications, Hungary 174,435 and Sweden a total of 156,110. During the period between\n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Asylum_statistics\n\n\n October and December 2015 (Q4) alone Germany received 162,540 applications,\n\n corresponding to 38% of the total across EU Member States. There were surprisingly low\n\n numbers of asylum applications among the bigger Member States. For instance, France only\n\n received 70,570 applications, Italy 83,245 and the UK 38,370. According to Eurostat, five\n\n Member States accounted for 75% of all applications \u2013 Germany, Sweden, Austria, Italy and\n\n France.\n\n With the EU offering no legal avenues for protection seekers to reach the EU and access the\n\n Common European Asylum System (CEAS), refugees arrived by and large irregularly on\n\n unseaworthy little boats from Turkey to Greece, instead of arriving in an orderly way in the\n\n EU to seek asylum. Then, although these people were within the Schengen area, on account\n\n of a lack of documentation, they were unable to move on rapidly to seek asylum in Member\n\n States with properly-functioning asylum systems. Instead, an extraordinary series of ad hoc\n\n responses came into place, resulting in the opening of a fairly safe route, known as the\n\n \u2018Balkan route\u2019 from Greece to northern Europe, from about September onwards until it was\n\n firmly shut in January 2016. By the end of December 2015, the numbers of applicants had\n\n already started to decrease (see Figure 3).\n\n 7 Guild, E.and Carrera S.

According to the\n\n design of the Schengen border-control-free area, asylum seekers arriving in Greece should\n\n have been able to purchase cheap flights to anywhere in Schengen and go there without any\n\n further identity control.\n\n As an area without internal controls on the movement of persons, Schengen did not deliver\n\n for these asylum seekers. Refugees coming were unable to catch cheap flights to and within\n\n the EU because of the application of identity checks and the threats of carrier sanctions\n\n against airlines carrying people.8 Airlines and other transport companies feared boarding\n\n people who had no valid travel documentation or had not been subject to checks from Greece\n\n or from elsewhere coming into the Schengen area. This incoherence within the Schengen\n\n system became even more noticeable when the Greek authorities began to issue certificates\n\n of registration to asylum seekers in order to facilitate their movement across the Balkan\n\n route, which permitted asylum seekers to move from Greece by land into Macedonia and\n\n then northwards, but were not sufficient for these same people to catch a (much cheaper)\n\n flight to their end destination. These developments were later compared to shutting down\n\n the Balkan route.9\n\n Thus the intersection of the arrival of refugees in larger numbers than anticipated and the\n\n perception of unreasonable pressure on the intra-Schengen borders is evident. The most\n\n substantial issue was the reaction to refugee arrivals not via the CEAS, but by the\n\n reintroduction of internal borders, a move designed to regulate movements of third country\n\n nationals, but one which should not be applied to refugees.\n\n 8 Peers, S.

Subsequently, however, Slovenia followed the Hungarian authorities in\n\n building a fence with Croatia.17 (See Sub-sections 4.5. and 4.8.3.).\n\n Belgium was the last country to re-introduce internal borders (23 February 2016) under\n\n Article 28, fearing the arrival of refugees from the Calais refugee camp. After April 2016,\n\n Belgium did not prolong its internal border controls.\n\n Germany, Austria, Sweden, Denmark and Norway subsequently invoked the Article 27\n\n of the SBC, which allows a Member State to prevent foreseeable threats.\n\n In addition, two other Member States \u2013 France and Malta - reintroduced internal border\n\n controls in line with the procedure under Article 27 of the SBC, which can be used to\n\n prevent a foreseeable \u201cserious threat to public policy or internal security\u201d. Both Member\n\n States initiated border controls due to important international events (COP 21 \u2013 Paris Climate\n\n Conference and the Valletta Summit, respectively) and associated these events with a\n\n\n\n terrorist threat. Nevertheless, France, from January 1 2016, has continued its border\n\n controls after the Paris attacks due to the subsequent \u2018state of emergency\u2019 and big sporting\n\n events, such as the Tour de France and the European Football Championship (see Section 4\n\n for further discussion).\n\n Following the unannounced on-site Schengen evaluation on Greek external borders in\n\n November 2015, the Council Implementing Decision of 12 February found \u2018serious\n\n deficiencies at external borders\u2019.18 Subsequent rounds of recommendations to address the\n\n deficiencies followed (see Annex 5).

Political context\n\n As regards the political context, the decision to apply Article 29 came in a highly politicised\n\n environment. According to the Commission\u2019s Proposal underpinning the Council\n\n Recommendation (emphasis added):20\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3286365/Slovenia-latest-country-resort-building-fences-borders-47-\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3286365/Slovenia-latest-country-resort-building-fences-borders-47-\n\n\n \u201cBorder control should only take place during the time necessary to remedy all the serious\n\n deficiencies in the management of the Union's external border. Several legislative initiatives\n\n and actions undertaken by the Union in order to reinforce its external border management\n\n (European Coast and Border Guard, return to a full application of EU asylum law\n\n provisions by the Hellenic Republic, stepping up of the implementation of the emergency\n\n relocation scheme, the EU-Turkey Statement) should also be in place and fully operational\n\n without delay and thus further contribute to a substantial reduction in the secondary\n\n movements of irregular migrants.\u201d\n\n As indicated above, these policy and legislative initiatives had been presented by the\n\n Commission in response to the so-called European refugee crisis. The key target of these\n\n initiatives seems to be a \u201csubstantial reduction in the secondary movements of irregular\n\n migrants\u201d. As previously identified in this study, the actual extent of these \u2018movements\u2019 is\n\n unclear, as is the extent to which these may be putting \u2018internal security\u2019 and \u2018public policy\u2019\n\n at risk. Secondly, it is neither clear how initiatives such as the European Border and Coast\n\n Guard (EBCG), the temporary relocation scheme (including in its new guise under the\n\n \u2018corrective mechanism\u2019 in the latest Dublin system re-cast proposal) or the EU-Turkey\n\n Statement would be capable of preventing people from moving within the Schengen Area, in\n\n particular if they have the legitimate aim to do so. Thirdly, if we speak about numbers of\n\n asylum seekers, Eurostat shows that the numbers of first-time asylum applicants have\n\n dropped significantly since December 2016 (see Figure 3). This has been especially so since\n\n April when the EU-Turkey Statement came into effect and the \u2018Balkans route\u2019 was closed off\n\n completely. Despite such evidence of a \u2018substantial reduction\u2019 in the numbers of people\n\n arriving, MS have acknowledged in their own notifications that they continued internal border\n\n controls due to \u2018fears of secondary movements\u2019. Such unsubstantiated fears have so far gone\n\n\n\n unchallenged by the Commission\u2019s proportionality assessment. Thus, it is not clear whether\n\n and how \u201cBack to Schengen\u201d agenda, that made its success conditional on the adoption and\n\n implementation of these EU plans, is capable of addressing the \u2018fears of the MS\u2019.\n\n 1.4. Methodology\n\n This study assesses whether the 2016 Schengen governance area is crisis-proof. It aims to\n\n provide a comprehensive understanding of the implementation dynamics and challenges\n\n affecting the current Schengen governance framework in light of recent developments and\n\n in response to the European refugee crisis.\n\n The legal analysis focuses on appropriate, proportionate and effective implementation of the\n\n SBC provisions on the temporary reintroduction of internal border controls by Member States\n\n and the proper functioning of the Schengen evaluation and monitoring mechanism. The study\n\n aims to:\n\n 1.

Suggest concrete policy recommendations to improve and amend the legal, policy and\n\n political methods of Schengen governance.\n\n In order to meet these objectives, this study has adopted a legal and policy analysis approach\n\n that comprises desk research of relevant primary and secondary sources. This analysis has\n\n been combined with a set of semi-structured interviews with a selection of EU policymakers\n\n in Brussels, comprising representatives from all relevant European institutions, a selection of\n\n EU Member State representatives and EU agencies. The interviews were of particular\n\n importance in the context of the rapid development of related policies. Moreover, the findings\n\n of the study were verified in a stakeholders\u2019 discussion organised by the European Citizens\n\n Action Service (ECAS). The discussion added additional dimensions on EU citizens\u2019 concern,\n\n mainly youth concerns, on free movement guarantees when border controls are reintroduced\n\n at internal borders (see Annex 4).\n\n 1.5. Structure of the study\n\n This study sets out to provide a better understanding of the legal implications of the\n\n reintroduction of internal borders in the EU and explores the policy processes underlying\n\n Member States\u2019 and EU institutions\u2019 actions in this context, and the legality of them. It aims\n\n to explore the options for strengthening the role of the European Parliament (EP) in ensuring\n\n\n\n democratic accountability at a time when the application of the SBC is in question.\n\n Section 2 aims to explain how The Franco-Italian affair in 2011 opened up important\n\n discussions for ensuring \u2018more Europe\u2019 in Schengen governance.21 This led to the Schengen\n\n governance reform in 2013, which was tested in the 2015/16 European refugee crisis.\n\n Section 3 maps the main innovations introduced in the 2013 Schengen governance reform.\n\n The 2013 legislative reform positioned the European Commission at the centre of the\n\n Schengen evaluation system and included \u2018more EU\u2019 in the monitoring and scrutiny powers.\n\n The Schengen Evaluation Mechanism (SEM) moved beyond the previous inter-governmental\n\n system. For example, the new SBC included amendments concerning the conditions for\n\n reintroducing internal border checks and deterrence mechanism \u2013 Article 29.22 A new\n\n consolidated version of the SBC was recently published on 23 March 2016.23 Finally, the\n\n section points out that, whereas greater parliamentary scrutiny is to be regarded an\n\n achievement and, under the new confidentiality rules MEPs can access relevant evaluation\n\n documents, practical arrangements still limit parliamentary scrutiny.24\n\n 21 Peers, S.

SCHENGEN AND \u2018CRISES\u2019: A BRIEF BACKGROUND\n\n KEY FINDINGS\n\n \u2022 The temporary reintroduction of internal border checks has been used on several\n\n occasions by EU Member States in the past.\n\n \u2022 During the 2010-2011 Arab Spring and the 2015-2016 European refugee crisis, the\n\n reintroduction of internal border controls was related to the arrival of asylum seekers,\n\n on both occasions raising concerns about the future of Schengen\n\n \u2022 Following the Franco-Italian affair in 2011, the Schengen Governance Package was\n\n adopted in order to move beyond the previous inter-governmental methods and\n\n ensure a more Community-based approach in the implementation and evaluation of\n\n Schengen rules by EU Member States.\n\n \u2022 The European Parliament gained important scrutiny powers over the results of\n\n Schengen evaluations as a result of the so-called \u201cSchengen freeze\u201d.\n\n This Section provides a brief overview of the development of the Schengen Area, followed by\n\n an overview of earlier reintroductions of internal Schengen border checks. Finally, the section\n\n provides the background to the 2013 legislative reform of the Schengen Borders Code (SBC).\n\n Particular attention is paid to the Franco-Italian Affair in 2011 that related to the arrival of\n\n Tunisian migrants in the wake of the so-called \u2018Arab Spring\u2019. The 2013 Schengen Governance\n\n\n\n Package was the main EU policy response to settle the Franco-Italian controversy by injecting\n\n \u2018more EU\u2019 into the evaluation of the Schengen system and the monitoring of the\n\n reintroduction of internal border checks by national governments. The corresponding\n\n legislation was adopted in October 2013, but not until a dispute over the role of the European\n\n Parliament in the adoption and monitoring of the Schengen evaluation mechanism had been\n\n settled. 25\n\n 2.1. Brief overview of the Schengen Area\n\n The free movement of persons is one of the four fundamental freedoms of the European\n\n Union, part of the original treaties and enhanced in the 1987 Single European Act. The\n\n abolition of border controls on the movement of persons among the Member States of the EU\n\n was determined to be an integral part of the completion of the internal market, a part of\n\n Jacques Delors\u2019 1992 project. However, a number of Member States have been reluctant to\n\n abolish intra-EU Member State controls and, from the adoption of the Single European Act it\n\n was clear that there would be difficulties with implementation. Two Member States in\n\n particular - Ireland and the UK - stood in opposition to the abolition of intra-Member State\n\n border controls.\n\n Five of the six original Member States of the EU (the outlier was Italy) addressed the issue of\n\n intra-Member State border controls in a bold move outside the EU framework - the 1985\n\n Schengen Agreement. This agreement laid the foundations for the abolition of border controls\n\n on persons moving among those five states, independently of the EU internal market. The\n\n Schengen Agreement was primarily a response to industrial action by lorry drivers on the\n\n Franco-German border, but the security implications were quickly picked up by the Ministries\n\n of the Interior (MoI). The latter became centrally involved.

These included\n\n common rules on the external border, common rules on visas and the countries to which they\n\n applied, a wide range of measures in policing and a database.\n\n The Schengen Agreement was supplemented by the Schengen Implementing Convention\n\n in 1990, which set out the nuts and bolts of the system and paved the way for the lifting\n\n of intra-participating state border controls on persons on 25 March 1995 (with an\n\n exception for France which was still concerned about the Dutch soft drugs policy). In the\n\n meantime, the completion of the internal market and the abolition of border controls\n\n among Member States for the free movement of persons was stalled, not least as a result\n\n of a conflict between the UK and Spain over the status of Gibraltar. However, all the\n\n Member States, other than the UK and Ireland, ultimately joined the Schengen system,\n\n creating a complicated and uncertain legal system between the EU and an agreement\n\n among many Member States covering the same territory as the EU treaties.\n\n This was resolved by the Amsterdam Treaty in 1999 when the Schengen acquis was\n\n incorporated into the EU treaties and a lengthy procedure of transition took place to bring\n\n Schengen into the core of EU law. One of the issues that would trouble the system was\n\n\n\n the status of CISA - did this agreement have a continuing legal life after the incorporation\n\n of 'Schengen' into EU law or had its value been exhausted? This uncertainty would give\n\n rise to conflict between France and Italy in 2011, which will be discussed below. That\n\n source of friction was resolved by the 2013 changes to the Schengen rules on intra-\n\n Member State controls on persons, which is discussed later in this study.\n\n The close connection of intra-Member State border controls on persons and security has\n\n always been a major concern of the interior ministries of a number of Member States.\n\n The apparent loss of control over the movement of persons has often been presented as\n\n a source of instability for some Member States, hampering the proper operation of their\n\n activities to protect the state and its citizens. This has not been the position of all Member\n\n States by any means but it does represent a current in the Schengen debate, which must\n\n be acknowledged. The refugee crisis in 2015-16 and the decision of some Member States\n\n to reintroduce internal border controls in response, is part of that long tale of security\n\n concerns about the border-control-free area. This study seeks to examine those moves\n\n and practices in light of the relevant legal requirements and place them in context for\n\n critical appreciation.\n\n Table 1: Categories of the Countries in the Schengen Area\n\n Schengen\n\n Area (26)\n\n EU Schengen States (22) Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark,\n\n Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,\n\n Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg,\n\n Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia,\n\n\n\n Slovenia, Spain and Sweden\n\n Non-EU Schengen states (4) Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein\n\n Non-\n\n Schengen,\n\n but EU (6)\n\n Schengen candidate countries\n\n (4)\n\n Croatia*, Romania, Bulgaria and Cyprus**\n\n Non-Schengen EU States (2) UK and Ireland\n\n * Croatia \u2013 is still considered as a newcomer thus not fully integrated, for example, in the SIS II system;\n\n **Cyprus applies Schengen aquis with the exceptions of SIS and absence of internal border controls and visas.\n\n Source: Authors based on the Commissions\u2019 official information.26\n\n 26 See European Commission Website, \u201cSchengen Area\u201d at            http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-\nwedo/\n\n policies/borders-and-visas/schengen/index_en.htm.\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 22\n\n The Schengen Area is now composed of 26 EU and non-EU Schengen States, while some of\n\n the EU states have either opted out intentionally or are in the process of accession to the\n\n Schengen Area (see Table 1 above).\n\n The Schengen Are countries are bound by the rules of the SBC.

The reintroduction of internal border checks\n\n The list of Member State notifications based on Article 25 (formerly 23) of Schengen31, up to\n\n 2006, shows that the reintroduction of internal border controls was used among the Member\n\n States on various occasions, from important high-level meetings (e.g. G7, World Economic\n\n Forum, NATO Summit, Nobel Prize ceremonies, visits of the Pope), to celebrations of\n\n controversial groups (e.g. the 50th anniversary of ETA, Youth days of radical young Basques)\n\n\n\n to responses to terror acts (e.g. the Breivik attacks in Norway on 22 July 2011).\n\n The reintroduction of internal border controls due to large numbers of people in need of\n\n humanitarian protection arriving in the EU in 2011 and 2015 provoked starkly different\n\n reactions. Prior to this, there was only one instance in 2001 where migration had been linked\n\n with reintroducing internal border checks: i.e. when Belgium reintroduced border controls for\n\n two weeks due to \u201cthe risk of a sudden temporary increase in asylum seekers.\u201d32 The two\n\n cases have revealed the \u201climits and unfinished elements of the EU\u2019s immigration policy\u201d and\n\n the need to subject EU Member States\u2019 decisions to derogate the border control-free area to\n\n more EU scrutiny.33 Thus, the explanatory memorandum for the 2011 Commission Proposal\n\n for new common rules on the temporary reintroduction of border control at internal borders\n\n in the exceptional circumstances of September 201134 included Article 26 (former Article\n\n 23a), which clarified the criteria for Member States reintroduction of internal border control\n\n in compliance with EU law.35\n\n 2.3. The 2011 Franco-Italian affair: Was there a breach of the Schengen Borders\n\n Code?\n\n In April 2011, following the Arab Spring revolutions, in total around 50,000 North African\n\n refugees from Tunisia, Libya and Egypt arrived in Italy.36 On the basis of a 5 April decree,\n\n Italian authorities issued six-month temporary residence permits on humanitarian grounds,\n\n mainly to Tunisians who arrived in the period between 1 January and 5 April 2011.37 The\n\n Italian government later estimated that 24,85438 such permits were issued. The residence\n\n permits gave an automatic right to move freely in the Schengen zone, thus many Tunisians\n\n started to head towards France, where they had some family links or at least knew the\n\n\n\n language.\n\n France responded to the Italian act by introducing border checks on Tunisian migrants and\n\n blocking a train that carried hundreds of migrants at the border.39 Austria, Belgium and\n\n Germany expressed their concerns, but refrained from re-introducing border checks. In\n\n addition, the Netherlands threatened to deport all Tunisians arriving from Italy. Whereas Italy\n\n claimed that it was being left alone to deal with asylum-seekers,40 the main argument put\n\n 31 The list of Member States\u2019 notifications compiled by European Commission can be accessed here:\n\n            http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/schengen/reintroduction-\nbordercontrol/\n\n docs/ms_notifications_-_reintroduction_of_border_control_en.pdf.\n\n 32 Statewatch (2003), Statewatch European Monitor, Vol. 3.

The substance of the 2013 Schengen governance reform\n\n After the Franco-Italian affair the European Commission aimed to halt previous \u2018unilateral\u2019\n\n decisions to re-instate internal borders by Member States and to insist on more Europe. The\n\n Commission proposal was based on the presumption that the security of external borders is\n\n a precondition for the freedom of circulation in the EU.47 In its communication accompanying\n\n the proposal to revise the SBC, the European Commission stressed the need to ensure that\n\n the Schengen area can cope effectively with strains which may be placed on it by weaknesses\n\n at its external borders or by external factors beyond its control\u201d.48\n\n The Commission proposal was echoed by the call from the 23-24 June 2011 European Council\n\n to consider the introduction of a \u201cmechanism [&hellip;] to respond to exceptional circumstances\n\n putting the overall functioning of Schengen cooperation at risk\u201d that would enable support\n\n to, as well as monitoring of, \u201ca Member State facing heavy pressure at the external borders\u201d\n\n and a \u201csafeguard clause [&hellip;] to allow the exceptional reintroduction of internal border controls\n\n in a truly critical situation where a Member State is no longer able to comply with its\n\n obligations under the Schengen rules\u201d.49 The proposal provided that the suspension of free\n\n movement should be automatic, should the Member States at the external borders fail in\n\n carrying out their obligations. Already at that time, the confidential risk analyses carried out\n\n by Frontex and Europol framed migration and asylum as sources of insecurity.50\n\n\n\n By contrast, the European Parliament resolution of 7 July 2011 stressed that \u201cthe necessary\n\n conditions for the temporary reintroduction of internal border controls in exceptional\n\n circumstances are already clearly set out\u201d in the SBC and stated that any initiative from the\n\n Commission would first be \u201caimed at defining the strict application\u201d of existing provisions,\n\n without introducing \u201cany new additional exemptions\u201d.51 In addition, in the same resolution,\n\n the European Parliament argued that \u201cthe crossing of external borders by non-nationals\n\n should not be framed as a \u2018threat\u2019 to public policy and internal security.\u201d 52 Thus, in the end,\n\n recital 26 of the SBC stated that \u201cmigration and the crossing of external borders by a large\n\n number of third country nationals should not, per se, be considered to be a threat to public\n\n policy or internal security.\u201c\n\n Frontieres website (           http://ceriscope.sciences-po.fr/content/part2/la-remise-en-cause-desaccords-de-\nschengen)\n\n and Wastl-Walter, D., Borders, Fences and Walls: State of Insecurity?, Ashgate Publishing Ltd., 2014.\n\n 45 S.Carrera, E.Guild, M.Merlino and J.Parkin (2011), \u201cA Race against Solidarity: The Schengen Regime and the\n\n Franco-Italian Affair\u201d, CEPS paper in Liberty and Security in Europe, April 2011, p. 18.\n\n 46 Ibid., p. 19.\n\n 47 S.Carrera (2012), \u201eAn Assessment of the Commission\u2019s 2011 Schengen Governance Package: Preventing \nabuse\n\n by EU member states of freedom of movement ?\u201d, CEPS paper in Liberty and Security in Europe, No.47, March\n\n 2012.\n\n 48 European Commission (2011), Schengen governance \u2013 strengthening the area without internal border control,\n\n COM(2011) 561 final, Brussels,16.9.2011, p. 2.\n\n 49 European Council (2011), European Council 23/24 June 2011 \u2013 Conclusions, EUCO 23/1/11, Brussels \n29.9.2011,\n\n p. 8.\n\nhttp://ceriscope.sciences-po.fr/content/part2/la-remise-en-cause-desaccords-de-schengen\nhttp://ceriscope.sciences-po.fr/content/part2/la-remise-en-cause-desaccords-de-schengen\n\n\n 50 S.Carrera (2012), \u201cAn Assessment of the Commission\u2019s 2011 Schengen Governance Package: Preventing \nabuse\n\n by EU member states of freedom of movement ?\u201d, CEPS paper in Liberty and Security in Europe, No.47, March \n2012.\n\n 51 European Parliament (2011) Resolution of 7 July 2011 on changes to Schengen, P7_TA(2011)0336, \nStrasbourg\n\n 7.7.2011.\n\n 52 S.Carrera (2012), \u201cAn Assessment of the Commission\u2019s 2011 Schengen Governance Package: Preventing \nabuse\n\n by EU member states of freedom of movement ?\u201d, CEPS paper in Liberty and Security in Europe, No.47, March \n2012.\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 26\n\n 2.5. \u2018The Schengen Freeze\u2019 and the European Parliament\u2019s Role\n\n \u2018The Schengen Freeze\u2019 controversy arose during the negotiations on the 2013 Schengen\n\n Governance Package and related to the role played by the European Parliament in the\n\n Schengen evaluation and monitoring mechanism. After the entry into force of the Treaty of\n\n Lisbon in 2009, the European Parliament acquired new powers and the role of co-legislator\n\n of the EU\u2018s Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ). Thus, when the Schengen\n\n governance reform was negotiated, the European Parliament fought hard for co-legislator\n\n competences in the SEM mechanism.53\n\n After two years of negotiations regarding the Parliaments role in the SEM,54 the Danish\n\n Presidency of the Council decided to reclassify the legal basis of a proposal amending the\n\n SEM from Article 77 TFEU to Article 70 TFEU.55 Article 77 of the TFEU provides that, in the\n\n area of border checks, asylum and immigration (Chapter 2 of the TFEU), the \u201cEuropean\n\n Parliament shall act in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure\u201d\u201d as co-legislator\n\n\n\n with the Council. Article 70, on the other hand, provides that, for ASFJ issues, the \u201cCouncil\n\n may, on a proposal from the Commission, adopt measures laying down the arrangements\n\n whereby Member States, in collaboration with the Commission, conduct objective and\n\n impartial evaluation of the implementation of the Union policies\u201d. Under this article the\n\n European Parliament and national parliaments are only \u201cinformed of the content and results\n\n of the evaluation\u201c. Thus, whereas Article 77 of the TFEU sees the European Parliament as the\n\n co-legislator (as is the case with the SBC), Article 70 does not provide any formal role for the\n\n Parliament.\n\n The EP reacted in an unprecedented way, freezing relevant Justice and Home Affairs files and\n\n threatening to bring an action before the CJEU.56 This controversy, known as the Schengen\n\n Freeze, \u201crevealed a pre-Lisbon mind-set among member states in the Council, as did the\n\n Council\u2019s legislative amendments that significantly watered down the \u2018Union-focused\u2019 nature\n\n of the Schengen Governance Package\u201d.57 The \u2018freeze\u2019, however, proved to be a successful\n\n factor in subsequent negotiations. While Article 70 of the TFEU remained the legal basis, the\n\n European Parliament achieved some practical co-decision powers, such as that any change\n\n to the Schengen Evaluation Mechanism should be subject to consultation with the EP.58\n\n Nevertheless, the new powers of the Parliament still remain under strain in the light of the\n\n latest developments in the European refugee crisis, despite the earlier Statement which\n\n explicitly stipulates that \u201cany future proposal from the Commission for amending this\n\n evaluation system would be submitted to the consultation of the European Parliament in\n\n order to take into consideration its opinion, to the fullest extent possible, before the adoption\n\n of a final text.\u201d59\n\n 53 Carrera, S., Hernanz, N. and Parkin, J.

It is run primarily by the Commission, with ample opportunities\n\n for Member States to influence the actual application of the mechanism.\n\n \u2022 The new evaluation system began to operate de facto only in 2015, the year of the\n\n peak in Syrian refugees coming to the EU from Turkey via the Greek islands in the\n\n Aegean. It is too early to draw definite conclusions on the working of the new system\n\n since this case cannot be considered typical.\n\n \u2022 The new Schengen evaluation mechanism is proactive, allowing for deficiencies and\n\n non-compliance with EU law to be detected at an earlier stage and remedied at shorter\n\n notice than on the basis of often very lengthy, reactive and adversarial infringement\n\n procedures.\n\n \u2022 Most documents produced in the evaluation process are classified or restricted, mostly\n\n on reasonable grounds. This situation, however, severely restricts the possibilities for\n\n serious monitoring of the working of the process by the European Parliament and by\n\n national parliaments.\n\n This section provides a legal analysis of the Schengen governance framework, before and\n\n after the 2013 regulations. Thus Section refers to the relevant CJEU case law and political\n\n negotiations that led to the increased role of the Commission and the EP and elaborates on\n\n\n\n the main innovations in the revised Schengen Borders Code (Sub-Section 3.1.) and the\n\n Schengen evaluation and monitoring mechanism (Sub-Section 3.2.). Finally, the section\n\n explores the new powers of the Commission, European Parliament and national parliaments\n\n (section 3.3.).\n\n 3.1. Innovations in the revised the Schengen Borders Code\n\n The Schengen Borders Code (hereafter SBC) sets out the main rules governing a) the\n\n abolition of internal border controls, including the conditions and procedures for their\n\n reintroduction, and b) the uniform control of external borders. In September 2011, the\n\n European Commission proposed the first major revision to the SBC rules, particularly with\n\n regard to Title III on the temporary reintroduction of controls at the internal borders.60\n\n The revision builds on developments after the Franco-Italian crisis of 2011 (see Section 2\n\n above).\n\n Prior to the revisions adopted in October 2013, rules concerning internal border controls\n\n and their re-imposition were organised as follows61:\n\n Schengen acquis and repealing the Decision of the Executive Committee of 16 September 1998 setting up a \nStanding\n\n Committee on the evaluation and implementation of Schengen, OJ L 295/27, 6.11.2013.\n\n 60 European Commission (2011), Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council \namending\n\n Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 in order to provide for common rules on the temporary reintroduction of border \ncontrol\n\n at internal borders in exceptional circumstances, COM(2011) 560 final, Brussels, 16.9.2011.\n\n 61 Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 establishing a\n\n\n\n Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code), OJ \nL\n\n 105, 13.4.2006.\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 28\n\n \u2022 The basic rule on the re-imposition of internal border checks appeared in Article 25(1)\n\n (former Article 23 (1)) SBC, stating that Member States \u2018may exceptionally reintroduce\u2019\n\n border controls at their internal borders on grounds of a \u2018serious threat to public policy\n\n or internal security\u2019, for a period of no more than 30 days or \u2018the foreseeable duration of\n\n the serious threat if its duration exceeds the period of 30 days\u2019.\n\n \u2022 The procedure had two variants depending on whether a Member State was dealing with\n\n \u2018foreseeable events\u2019 under Article 27 SBC (former Article 24) or \u2018urgent cases\u2019 under\n\n Article 28 SBC (former Article 25). For foreseeable events, a Member State had to notify\n\n the Commission and other Member States of its plans and provide, \u2018as soon as possible\u2019,\n\n information on reasons, including details of the events considered to constitute a \u2018serious\n\n threat\u2019, the scope, dates and duration of the controls. The Commission could issue an\n\n opinion (i.e. non-binding), and the procedure further involved a \u2018consultation\u2019 between\n\n the Member State considering the re-imposition of controls, the other Member States and\n\n the Commission. In cases of \u2018urgent action\u2019, the reintroduction of controls could be\n\n immediate, other Member States and the Commission would be informed \u2018without delay\u2019,\n\n and provided with reasons for the use of the urgent procedure. The Commission\n\n envisaged these articles as separate procedures allowing MS to respond to different\n\n needs.62 Thus, it is interesting to note that, in the current Schengen crisis, the majority\n\n of MS have switched from \u2018unforeseen threat\u2019 to \u2018foreseen\u2019 and have started to apply\n\n\n\n these articles in sequence, which allows them to maintain internal border controls for 8\n\n months in total.\n\n \u2022 Articles 31 and 33 (former Articles 27 and 29 respectively) covered the obligation for\n\n the Member State concerned to inform the European Parliament of the measures taken\n\n to re-impose or prolong internal border controls, and to submit a report to the European\n\n Parliament, the European Commission and the Council at the time of or after the lifting\n\n of controls. Article 32 (former Article 28) established that, in the event that internal\n\n border controls were re-imposed, the rules of the SBC concerning external border checks\n\n would apply.\n\n \u2022 Article 34 (former Article 30) established the obligation to inform the public about the\n\n re-imposition of internal border controls, unless security reasons prevented it, while\n\n Article 35 (former Article 31) specified that, if the concerned Member State requests it,\n\n the European Parliament, Commission and other Member States should keep any\n\n information supplied on the re-imposition of border checks confidential.\n\n In October 2010, the European Commission published a report on the application of Title III,\n\n as required by the former Article 38 SBC (not in the new version).63 Based on the 22 cases\n\n where Member States had re-imposed internal border controls since the entry into force of\n\n the SBC Regulation, the report found that Member States had not made use of rules on the\n\n prolongation of border controls beyond the initial 30-day period. The Commission\u2019s criticism\n\n was mostly procedural, noting that the \u2018timeframe [&hellip;] for issuing its opinion for the purpose\n\n of formal consultation between the Member States and the Commission is too short\u201964 as far\n\n as foreseeable events (Article 27 SBC) are concerned. The information submitted was also\n\n\n\n deemed not substantial enough. No Member State except Finland had activated the\n\n confidentiality clause under Article 35 SBC (former Article 31). The Commission noted \u2018that\n\n in general the current legal framework governing the temporary reintroduction of border\n\n control at internal borders is sufficient\u2019.65\n\n 62 Interview with Commission, DG HOME, 17.05.2016.\n\n 63 European Commission (2010), Report on the application of Title III (Internal Borders) of Regulation (EC) No\n\n 562/2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders\n\n (Schengen Borders Code), COM(2010) 554 final, Brussels, 13.10.2010.\n\n 64 Ibid, p. 8\n\n 65 Ibid, p. 10\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 29\n\n The conclusions of the 2010 report suggest that subsequent controversies leading to the\n\n 2013 revision of the SBC are first and foremost related to a shift in the political\n\n context, exemplified by the Franco-Italian affair in 2011. This shift enabled the\n\n different actors involved in the revision to push specific agendas in relation to the SBC. Any\n\n effort to determine whether the post-2013 SBC rules on the re-imposition of internal border\n\n controls constitute an innovation in this respect should take stock of the priorities placed in\n\n the foreground by the different actors in the legislative process.\n\n The position of the European Commission can be found in the legislative proposal of\n\n October 2011, the key aspects of which are the following:\n\n \u2022 It wanted a replacement of most of the rules found in Title III, concerning in\n\n\n\n particular the re-imposition of internal border controls, which would have shifted most of\n\n the power to decide from the Member States to the European Commission.66\n\n \u2022 This involved strengthening the necessity criteria for the re-imposition of internal border\n\n controls, by means of a new Article 26 (former Article 23a) SBC, taking into account \u2018in\n\n particular\u2019 (not exclusively) threats at the \u2018Union or national level\u2019, the existence and\n\n availability of \u2018support measures\u2019 at the national or Union level, as well as \u2018the likely\n\n impact of such a measure\u2019 on free movement within the Schengen area.\n\n \u2022 The new Articles 27 and 28 would have required that Member States make a request\n\n to the European Commission for the purpose of re-imposing controls, six weeks prior to\n\n the planned reintroduction in the case of \u2018foreseeable events\u2019 under Article 27. The\n\n request would have included \u2018all relevant data\u2019, echoing the findings of the 2010\n\n Commission report on the application of Title III SBC, and this information would also\n\n have been submitted to the European Parliament. In cases falling under Article 27 SBC,\n\n the proposed legislation provided that the decision to re-impose border controls\n\n would be taken by the European Commission through \u2018implementing acts\u2019 in\n\n combination with a new Article 38 SBC (former Article 33a). For Article 28 requests, the\n\n European Commission would have held sole power to decide on the prolongation of\n\n controls.\n\n \u2022 The proposal put forward a new Article 29 addressing \u2018cases of persistent serious\n\n deficiencies\u2019 in the way a Member State controls its segment of EU external borders or\n\n handled its return procedures. Where, through procedures detailed in the regulation on\n\n Schengen evaluation, deficiencies were detected and these deficiencies constituted \u2018a\n\n serious threat to public policy or internal security at the Union or national level\u2019, internal\n\n\n\n border controls were to be reintroduced for six months, to be extended for up to three\n\n further consecutive periods of six months if the Member State concerned did not take\n\n remedial action. The exclusive power to make decisions would rest with the European\n\n Commission. Interviews revealed that initially it was envisaged that Member States\n\n geographically located just inside the one with the \u2018persistent deficiencies\u2019 would act as a\n\n new \u2018external border\u2019 for the period until the deficiencies were solved.\n\n By contrast, the Council\u2019s position67 consisted in locating most of the decision powers on\n\n the re-imposition of internal border controls with the Member States. Three points are\n\n noteworthy:\n\n \u2022 A new Article 21 (now Article 19a) giving the European Commission power to issue\n\n recommendations to a Member State if a Schengen evaluation found \u2018serious difficulties\n\n or deficiencies\u2019 associated with external border controls. The recommendations could be\n\n blocked by the Council, and their implementation would have been monitored by the\n\n Commission reporting to a committee of Member State officials.\n\n 66 Peers, S.

The rules\n\nhttp://www.statewatch.org/analyses/no-180-schengen-border-code.pdf\nhttp://www.statewatch.org/analyses/no-180-schengen-border-code.pdf\n\n\n adopted under the initial SBC for the Commission to issue an opinion would have\n\n remained, as they were under Article 27, and in Article 28 the general rules for\n\n Commission opinions and Member State consultations would have applied.\n\n \u2022 Article 29: the Council supported the principle of an entirely new provision in the SBC\n\n that would have applied \u2018in cases of persistent serious difficulties or deficiencies\u2019 in a\n\n Member State\u2019s external border control or return policy. In contrast with the European\n\n Commission\u2019s initial proposal, Member States would have retained sole power for deciding\n\n on the reintroduction of border controls. The Council\u2019s version of the new Article 29 SBC\n\n also provided that the Council itself would \u2018as a last resort and as a measure to protect\n\n the common interests\u2019 of the Schengen area, and if all other measures failed to have an\n\n effect, have the power to recommend that a Member State (or several of them) re-impose\n\n internal border controls.\n\n Finally, the European Parliament\u2019s position on the revision68 largely aligned with that of\n\n the Council insofar as it aimed to limit the scope of the Commission\u2019s powers to decide on or\n\n prolong the reintroduction of border controls.69 Nevertheless, the position of both institutions\n\n diverged significantly over whether the Commission or the Council should have the upper\n\n hand in the context of the new procedure for reintroducing internal border controls on the\n\n \u2018serious deficiencies\u2019 ground.\n\n Given the expectations and controversies, then, to what extent is the post-2013 version of\n\n the SBC new or innovative? The following key changes can be flagged:\n\n \u2022 A new Article 21 (former Article 19a), to which the European Parliament agreed without\n\n amending the Council text. The article empowers the European Commission to make\n\n recommendations to Member States addressing serious deficiencies in carrying out\n\n\n\n external border controls identified in a SEM on-site mission.\n\n \u2022 The re-imposition of border controls has been reaffirmed as a measure of \u2018last\n\n resort\u2019 following amendments from the European Parliament.\n\n \u2022 A new \u2018serious deficiencies\u2019 ground: The key amendment here to the Council\u2019s\n\n version of the legislation was the requirement for it to act on a proposal from the\n\n Commission when making a recommendation to Member States. The Commission can no\n\n longer make a decision on its own in this area, as provided for in its original proposal.\n\n Article 29 also provides for a procedure whereby a Member State may decide not to go\n\n along with the Council\u2019s recommendation, requiring the concerned Member State to\n\n communicate its reasons for not doing so in writing to the European Commission, which\n\n is then tasked with providing an assessment report examining the decision against the\n\n \u2018common interest\u2019 of the Schengen area.\n\n The extent to which these changes constitute an innovation, however, is unclear. As other\n\n analyses have noted, the procedures that Member States must follow to re-impose internal\n\n border controls on grounds that had already been specified in the 2006 SBC have not been\n\n impacted significantly, although the 2013 revision introduces \u2018more detailed rules on\n\n 68 European Parliament (2012), Report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the \nCouncil\n\n amending Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 in order to provide for common rules on the temporary reintroduction of\n\n border control at internal borders in exceptional circumstances (COM(2011)0560 \u2013 C7-0248/2011 \u2013\n\n 2011/0242(COD))\n\n Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Rapporteur: Renate Weber, P7_TA(2013)0259, Brussels,\n\n 14.06.2012.\n\n 69 Peers (2013), The future of Schengen, op.cit., p. 41.\n\n\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 31\n\n criteria and time limits\u2019.70 Likewise, while there is the new ground of \u2018serious deficiencies\u2019 for\n\n re-imposing border controls, it cannot be construed as a unilateral power for Member States,\n\n as any reintroduction of internal border controls still requires a recommendation from the\n\n Council, and a proposal from the European Commission. In the meantime, the 2013 revision\n\n increased the accountability of the Member States ex post factum, by establishing more\n\n detailed criteria for their reports on the re-imposition of border controls, affirming the\n\n possibility of a Commission opinion on those reports and a requirement for the Commission\n\n to produce yearly reports on the Schengen system. In this regard, it is important to take\n\n stock of the changes made to the Schengen evaluation and monitoring system, which are\n\n detailed in the next section.\n\n 3.2. Changes in the Schengen Evaluation and Monitoring Mechanism\n\n This sub-section provides a historical overview of developments in the Schengen Evaluation\n\n Mechanism from 1999 until its entry into force in 2015.\n\n 3.2.1. Schengen evaluation 1999-2014\n\n Three years after the Schengen Implementing Agreement (CISA) became operational and\n\n controls at internal borders had to be abolished in the first seven Member States in 1995,\n\n the Schengen Executive Committee in 1998 adopted a Decision establishing a Standing\n\n Committee. The committee was composed of high-ranking officials of the Schengen States.\n\n They were entrusted with evaluating the implementation of the Schengen rules in the States\n\n where the CISA entered in force. According to that decision, the sole responsibility for\n\n checking the proper application of the CISA \u201cshall continue to remain with the Schengen\n\n\n\n States\u201d.71 After the integration of the Schengen acquis into Union law in 1999 this mechanism\n\n continued to operate for fifteen years (1999-2014). The Council took over the role of the\n\n Schengen Executive Committee. The Commission participated as an observer in the Council\u2019s\n\n working group on Schengen evaluation and in the expert teams that made the on-site visits.72\n\n In the Hague Programme of 2005, the Commission was invited to present a proposal\n\n supplementing the existing Schengen evaluation mechanism. The long battles between the\n\n Commission and the Member States on the division of competences in the new evaluation\n\n system and, after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, with respect to the role of the\n\n Parliament, are reflected in three subsequent proposals on this issue presented by the\n\n Commission in 2009, 2010 and 2011 and in the final text of the Regulation.73\n\n 3.2.2. Main elements of Regulation 1053/2013\n\n The Regulation codified and developed many of the elements from the previous evaluation\n\n system. It provides for annual (or more frequent) planning of the evaluation of the situation\n\n in Member States on the basis of visits by teams of representatives from the Commission\n\n and experts from the Member States and Frontex. Each Member State is evaluated at least\n\n once in five years.74 These visits are to be prepared on the basis of risk analyses by Frontex\n\n and of information produced by Member States in response to a standard questionnaire. The\n\n visits result in evaluation reports that are discussed with the Member State concerned.

The Commission makes an assessment of the adequacy of the plan and its\n\n implementation. In case of serious deficiencies, the Commission may schedule\n\n (un)announced on-site visits to check up on the implementation of the action plan (see Figure\n\n 6 below).\n\n Figure 6. Schengen evaluation mechanism evaluation in relation to Article 29\n\n Source: European Commission website (2016).76\n\n It is worth noting, however, that the current scheme will be changed by incorporating the\n\n new EBCG vulnerability assessment (see Sub-section 5.2.2.). The evaluation mechanism\n\n\n\n covers all areas of the Schengen acquis, such as borders, visa policy, the Schengen\n\n Information System (SIS II), data protection, police cooperation, judicial cooperation in\n\n criminal matters and drugs policies. It covers both the efficiency of controls at external\n\n borders and the absence of controls at internal borders.77 The repeated references in the\n\n Schengen Border Code to Regulation 1053/2013 illustrate the close link between the two\n\n instruments.78\n\n 75 None of these proposals was accessible to the public:\n\n            \n dateFrom=&dateTo=&serviceId=&documentType=&title=1053%2F2013&titleLanguage=&titleSearch=EXACT&sort\n\n By=NUMBER&sortOrder=DESC, accessed on 13 June 2016.

They need to\n\n draft ex post reports - the lack of systematic follow-up was a weak point in the old system;\n\n \u2022 The Commission\u2019s role has changed from observer to overall organiser and coordinator\n\n of the evaluations;\n\n \u2022 Expertise of other EU institutions and bodies, such Frontex, Europol, Eurojust, EASO and\n\n EDPS may be used. They can participate as observers in the on-site missions;\n\n \u2022 The Commission is now entitled to schedule unannounced on-site visits in Member States;\n\n \u2022 The evaluation and on-site-visits may also cover the absence of border control at internal\n\n borders;\n\n \u2022 The European Parliament is now entitled to receive the relevant information (draft and\n\n final evaluation reports, recommendations that are classified as \u201cEU restricted\u201d) and may\n\n influence the practice of the evaluation system;\n\n \u2022 More information on the application of the Schengen evaluation is in the public domain.79\n\n The main achievement is that the new Regulation replaced a fully intergovernmental\n\n evaluation system with a system that clearly functions within the EU, supplementing existing\n\n mechanisms for detecting non-compliance with Union law and providing for action to ensure\n\n compliance by Member States. The earlier \u201cinter pares\u201d system lacked \u201cteeth\u201d as Member\n\n States were reluctant to openly criticise each other.80 The current system has been criticised,\n\n mainly, by Member States, stating that the Commission is taking too much of a \u201ctop-down\u201d\n\n\n\n approach.81\n\n 3.2.4. Regulation\u2019s entry into force in 2015\n\n The Regulation was adopted in October 2013. It provided for the first annual and multiannual\n\n evaluation programme to be established by the Commission in May 2014 and for the\n\n first annual plan to cover the last five weeks of 2014 only.82 During 2014 the evaluations\n\n were still conducted on the basis of the 1998 Decision.83 The focus was on preparation of the\n\n evaluation cycle and developing training for the evaluation experts.84 The annual evaluation\n\n programme for 2015 was established by the Commission in November 2014, which included\n\n both announced and unannounced (in the unpublished part of the programme) on-site\n\n visits.85 The first evaluations under the Regulation (in Austria, Belgium and Sweden) were\n\n 79 E.g.

A few months later,\n\n unprecedented numbers of refugees, fleeing the war situation in the Middle East, crossed the\n\n external borders of the Schengen area. The refugee crisis gave rise to a prolonged and\n\n intensive evaluation and monitoring of controls following the findings of unannounced on-site\n\n visit at the external borders of Greece in November 2015.\n\n 3.3. Role of the Commission, the Parliament and national parliaments\n\n 3.3.1. Role of the European Commission\n\n The Regulation provides that the Member States and the Commission are jointly responsible\n\n for the implementation of the SEM. But the Commission is also entrusted with an overall\n\n coordination role in relation to establishing annual and multi-annual evaluation programmes,\n\n drafting questionnaires and setting schedules of visits, conducting announced and\n\n unannounced visits and drafting, together with the team of experts performing the visit, the\n\n\n\n evaluation reports and draft recommendations. The Commission also ensures the follow-up\n\n and monitoring of the evaluation reports and the Council\u2019s recommendations.86\n\n The power to adopt recommendations remained with the Council. The Regulation\u2019s preamble\n\n gives four reasons: 1. To strengthen mutual trust between Member States, 2. To reinforce\n\n peer pressure amongst them, e.g. through political discussions at ministerial level, 3. To\n\n reflect that the evaluation system fulfils a complementary function in parallel to the normal\n\n control procedure, such as the infringement procedure and 4. To take into account \u201cthe\n\n potential politically-sensitive nature of recommendations, often touching on national\n\n executive and enforcement powers\u201d.87 If the evaluation team during a visit identifies serious\n\n deficiencies in the management of external borders, the Commission, on the basis of the\n\n SBC, may in addition recommend that the Member State evaluated take certain specific\n\n measures with a view to ensuring compliance with the Recommendation adopted under\n\n Article 15 of the Regulation.88 The proactive evaluation and monitoring mechanism of the\n\n Regulation creates the possibility that deficiencies and non-compliance with EU law are\n\n detected at an earlier stage and can be remedied at shorter notice than the often very lengthy\n\n and adversarial infringement procedures.\n\n In order to allow Member States to be informed at an early stage about the Commission\u2019s\n\n activities, to influence and potentially block measures considered undesirable, certain\n\n activities first have to be discussed in a committee of Member States\u2019 representatives that\n\n \u201cassists\u201d the Commission. This form of preventive control applies with respect to the drafts\n\n of the annual and multi-annual programmes, of the standard questionnaire, and of the draft\n\n evaluation reports after a visit to a Member State.89 The Member State concerned has\n\n opportunity to challenge or explain the findings during the \u2018drafting meeting\u2019. This report is\n\n transferred to other MS for consideration. In addition, the Commission is acting collegially,\n\n meaning that, while the Directorate General for Migration and Home Affairs (DG HOME) is in\n\n\n\n the driving seat, other Commissioners and also the President of the Commission can influence\n\n the final result.\n\n was established in European Commission (2015) Commission Implementing Decision of 9.12.2015 establishing \nthe\n\n first section of the annual evaluation programme for 2016 in accordance with Article 6 of Council Regulation (EU)\n\n No 1053/2013 of 7 October 2013 establishing an evaluation and monitoring mechanism to verify the application of\n\n the Schengen acquis, C(2015) 8537 final, Brussels, 9.12.2015.\n\n 86 Article 3 of the SEM.\n\n 87 Recital 11 of the SEM.\n\n 88 Article 21 of the SBC.\n\n 89 Article 5(2), Article 6(9), Article 9(1), Article 14(5) and Article 21 of the SEM.\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 35\n\n 3.3.2. Role of the European Parliament\n\n According to Article 70 TFEU, the European Parliament and national Parliaments shall be\n\n informed of the content and results of the evaluations of the implementation of EU policies\n\n in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. Accordingly, the Regulation stipulates that most\n\n of the key documents produced during the evaluation mechanism be transmitted by the\n\n Commission to the Parliament under the confidentiality rules.90 This applies to the multiannual\n\n evaluation programme, the annual evaluation programme, the Frontex risk analyses,\n\n the evaluation reports on each Member State, the recommendations to Member States, the\n\n action plans and their implementation, the annual reports on the evaluations carried out and\n\n the review report.91\n\n The content of Member States\u2019 replies to the standard questionnaire is only available to\n\n\n\n Parliament upon request in \u201cserious matters\u201d, on a case-by-case basis. But the Commission\n\n has to inform the Parliament of the replies.92 If an on-site visit reveals a serious deficiency\n\n deemed to constitute a serious threat to public policy or internal security, the Parliament may\n\n ask the Commission for more information.93 It is unclear how the Parliament would be aware,\n\n unless it first has received the draft report from the Commission, about such serious\n\n deficiencies in a Member State.\n\n Most documents transmitted by the Commission under the Regulation are classified as \u2018EU\n\n RESTRICTED\u201994, meaning that disclosure of this information \u201ccould be disadvantageous to the\n\n interests of the Union or of one or more of the Member States.\u201c95\n\n According to the SBC, the Commission has to inform the Parliament of notifications by\n\n Member States of their plans to temporarily reintroduce controls at their internal Schengen\n\n borders, of the actual reintroduction and the Member States\u2019 reports on those reintroductions\n\n and of the reasons which might trigger the application of Article 21 and Articles 25 to 30\n\n SBC.96 If the Member State decides to classify part of the information, this does not preclude\n\n the Commission from making the information available to the Parliament. The transmission\n\n and handling of information and documents transmitted to the Parliament must comply with\n\n the rules concerning the forwarding and handling of classified information between the\n\n European Parliament and the Commission.97 The same applies to classified SEM documents.\n\n The rules on transmission and handling of classified documents are to be found in the interinstitutional\n\n agreement and in the Parliament\u2019s rules of procedure on handling of classified\n\n information apply.98 In practice, very few MEPs actually have access to these documents.\n\n While MEPs and Political Group Advisors have access, MEPs\u2019 assistants are not able to read\n\n the \u201cEU RESTRICTED\u201d documents in the Secret Room of the European Parliament.99 MEPs\n\n are not allowed to take any notes. In addition, the blanket nature of making whole documents\n\n confidential, not only its sensitive parts, discourages MEPs, as it takes time to find the key\n\n\n\n 90 European Parliament and Council (2014), Interinstitutional agreement of 12 March 2014, OJ C 95, Op. cit.\n\n 91 Article 5(1), Article 6(2), Article 7(1), Article 14(5), Article 15(3), Article 16(1) and (6), Article 20 and Article 22\n\n of the SEM.\n\n 92 Article 9(2) of the SEM\n\n 93 Article 16(7) of the SEM.\n\n 94 Interview with LIBE Secretariat, 03.06.2016.\n\n 95 Article 2(d) of the European Parliament (2015), Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, 8th \nparliamentary\n\n term - September 2015, ANNEX VII : Confidential and sensitive documents and information.\n\n 96 Articles 27 to 29 and Article 31 of the SBC.\n\n 97 Article 27(3) of the SBC.\n\n 98 Article 17 of the SEM and European Parliament and European Commission (2010), ANNEX II, Framework\n\n Agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission, OJ L 304/47, Brussels,\n\n 20.11.2010 and European Parliament (2015), Annex VII of the Parliament\u2019s Rules of Procedure.\n\n 99 Interview with LIBE Secretariat, 03.06.2016.\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 36\n\n information.100 And finally, whereas the final documents are transmitted by General\n\n Secretariat of the Commission to the Secret Room of the European Parliament, the drafts are\n\n transmitted by DG HOME to the LIBE Secretariat.101 There is anecdotal evidence that MEPs\n\n are running between both places in order to get the full overview from draft and final\n\n documents.102\n\n On the Parliament\u2019s website, before February 2016 and the debate on the evaluation of the\n\n controls at the external borders of Greece in Strasbourg,103 no trace of a motion, a\n\n\n\n parliamentary question, a written declaration or a debate on the new Schengen evaluation\n\n mechanism or on any of the documents transmitted to the Parliament on the basis of the\n\n new Regulation could be found.\n\n According to recital 14, during the evaluation and monitoring, special attention should be\n\n paid to respect for fundamental rights. According to Article 12 the training of the evaluation\n\n team experts should cover respect for fundamental rights. These provisions were inserted\n\n under pressure from the Parliament and increased the role of the EU Fundamental Rights\n\n Agency (FRA). If the Commission or Member States violated these or other provisions in the\n\n Regulation, the Parliament could start an action before the Court of Justice, e.g. for\n\n annulment of an implementing act establishing a questionnaire or evaluation report failing to\n\n properly address fundamental rights. At the moment, however, FRA experts are invited as\n\n observers in on-site evaluation missions related to returns and SIS II, but not on borders\n\n issues.104\n\n Finally, according to recital 20, the Parliament has to be consulted in advance if the\n\n Commission is considering submitting a proposal to amend the Regulation. The SBC goes\n\n less far, demanding only, in Article 43(5) (former Article 37a), that the Parliament is\n\n \u201cimmediately and fully informed of any proposal to amend\u201d the Regulation.\n\n 3.3.3. Role of national parliaments\n\n Both the TFEU and the Regulation provide for the transmission of information to national\n\n parliaments and, hence, give them a potential role. The Commission has to inform the\n\n parliaments of the content and results of the evaluations and transmit the annual reports and\n\n the Council should transmit its recommendation to the national parliaments.105 This\n\n information should allow those parliaments to supplement the check provided by the\n\n European Parliament. Whether national parliaments have indeed received the relevant\n\n\n\n information could not be established. For example, interviewees in the Permanent\n\n Representations could not recall any involvement of the National Parliaments. In addition, in\n\n the Dutch and German parliamentary document registers from 2015, there is no trace of\n\n these documents. The (unpublished) proposal adopted by the Commission in late 2015 for a\n\n Council recommendation on the management of the external border by Sweden, apparently,\n\n was transmitted to the German Bundestag in January 2016.106\n\n 100 Interview with MEP, 01.06.2016.\n\n 101 Interview with LIBE Secretariat, 03.06.2016.\n\n 102 Interview with MEP, 01.06.2016.\n\n 103 European Parliament Newsletter on \u201c1-4 February 2016 - Strasbourg plenary session\u201d,\n\n            http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/plenary/2016-02-01/1.\n\n 104 Interview with FRA, 04.05.2016.\n\n 105 Articles 15(3), 19 and 20 of the SEM.\n\n 106 See Bundestag Dru cksache 18/7612, listing under point A.5: European Commission (2015), Proposal for a\n\n Council Recommendation in accordance with Article 15(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013 of 7 October 2013,\n\n COM(2015)672, Brussels, 11.12.2015; Council (2016), Proposal for a Council recommendation addressing the\n\n deficiencies identified in the 2015 evaluation of Sweden's application of the Schengen acquis in the field of\n\n management of the external border (Arlanda Airport), Council document 5240/16, Brussels, 02.02.2016.\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 37\n\n In discussions with offcials of both Chambers of the Dutch Parliament for the purposes of the\n\n study, it emerged that they did spot unpublished Commission action plans and proposals for\n\nhttp://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/plenary/2016-02-01/1\n\n\n recommendations and action plans on the basis of Article 15 in \u2018Extranet\u2019, a database from\n\n the Council including classified or other non-published EU documents accessible to Member\n\n States\u2019 governments. They were not, however, aware that the Commission had transmitted\n\n the non-public documents to the Dutch Parliament. The latter was not notified that\n\n Commission had produced new documents under the Regulation and that those documents,\n\n which the Commission is obliged to transmit to the national parliaments, are available via\n\n Extranet.\n\n This appears to be a rather minimalistic interpretation of the Commission\u2019s obligation to\n\n transmit these documents to the national parliaments. According to these officials, only\n\n publicly available Commission documents are sent directly to national parliaments. Most\n\n Schengen evaluation documents on the basis of the Regulation are confidential and not\n\n available to the public. This may explain why these documents are not mentioned in national\n\n parliamentary documents and why there has been no recorded parliamentary discussion on\n\n such documents in these two Member States. The confidential nature of the documents\n\n severely restricts the possibilities for MPs to consult experts other than government officials\n\n on the meaning of these documents or to have a public discussion on these documents.107\n\n 107 For example, Maurer A.

STATE OF PLAY: WHAT DOES THE SCHENGEN BORDERS\n\n CODE MEAN IN PRACTICE?\n\n KEY FINDINGS\n\n\n\n \u2022 The Member States\u2019 justifications for the reintroduction of intra-Schengen state\n\n borders controls under Articles 25 \u2013 26 SBC, in particular on and after 13 September\n\n 2015 are inadequate.\n\n \u2022 The proportionality assessment for the reintroduction of intra-Schengen border\n\n controls needs to be thorough and complete given the fundamental nature of the right\n\n to intra-Schengen free movement of persons.\n\n \u2022 Member States should provide serious and compelling reasons, with supporting\n\n documentation regarding the genuine existence of a threat, if seeking to curtail the\n\n free movement of persons across the area since the border-cotrol-free free movement\n\n of persons is one of the main objectives of the internal market and a core benefit of\n\n it.\n\n \u2022 Where Member States invoke the threat of terrorism as a reason for the reintroduction\n\n of intra-Schengen border controls, sufficient detail as to the nature of the threat must\n\n be provided to the EU institutions so that they can ensure that the proportionality\n\n assessment is correctly carried out.\n\n \u2022 The EU institutions and the Member States must respect their duty under the Refugee\n\n Convention (Article 31) and so may not initiate criminal prosecutions or apply any\n\n other penalties to refugees for their irregular entry onto their territory (including that\n\n which results from intra-Schengen movement).\n\n \u2022 Whereas Article 23(a) of the SBC stipulates that the exercise of police powers on\n\n internal borders may not have the objective of border controls and must be based on\n\n general police information and experience \u2018regarding possible threats to public\n\n\n\n security and aim, in particular, to combat cross-border crime\u2019, several Member States\n\n use police checks in border areas for immigration control purposes, making a direct\n\n connection between irregular immigration and possible threats to public security. This\n\n practice is contrary to the purpose of Article 23(a) and recital 26 of the SBC.\n\n \u2022 National practices of mobile police checks at the internal borders illustrate that the\n\n line between border controls and border checks, prohibited in Article 22 of the SBC\n\n on the one hand, and police checks allowed in Article 23 SBC, on the other, is unclear.\n\n \u2022 The classification of \u2018asylum seekers\u2019 as \u2018illegal immigrants\u2019 to justify border controls\n\n or police checks in border areas runs counter to the SBC and CEAS. It allows the\n\n extended use of internal border checks, contrary to the purposes of the SBC and\n\n means that asylum seekers crossing internal borders can be detained on the basis of\n\n regular migration rules, disregarding applicable EU laws on the reception of asylum\n\n seekers.\n\n This section identifies challenges in relation to the rule of law standards in the 2013 Schengen\n\n governance reform package as mapped out in Section 3. The question that arises in light of\n\n the refugee and security crises of 2015-2016 is whether the new framework is sufficiently\n\n robust for the successful operation of the Schengen border-control-free area.\n\n As mentioned in the Introduction, a majority of people arriving in the EU in 2015/16 seeking\n\n asylum were from countries torn apart by recent or ongoing conflicts and wars, such as Syria,\n\n Afghanistan, and Iraq \u2013 countries with high refugee recognition rates. Thus, the intersection\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n 39\n\n of the arrival of refugees in larger numbers than anticipated and the perception of\n\n unreasonable pressure on the intra-Schengen borders is evident. Some of the Member States\n\n claimed they asked the Commission how to properly apply the CEAS and SBC in this case,\n\n and subsequently, where to register people coming \u2013 in EURODAC or SIS II.\n\n The most substantial issue that concentrated the minds of officials in Ministries of Interior\n\n (MoI) over this period was finding reception facilities for the arrivals.108 Member States\n\n tended not to keep significant reception facilities available for asylum seekers, but rather to\n\n try to expand and contract these facilities depending on the ebbs and flows of arrivals. This\n\n has many unfortunate consequences, not least endless investment in recruitment and\n\n training. Well-trained and experienced officers are let go because of a drop in numbers one\n\n year, only to be replaced a year or two later with new inexperienced officers when the\n\n numbers go up again.\n\n Similarly, Member States do not keep substantial housing stock available in case of an\n\n increase in asylum arrivals. But when people do arrive, they need to find housing rapidly.\n\n The impact of successful efforts to maximise flexibility in asylum reception systems was\n\n revealed when the numbers of people using the system increased substantially and Member\n\n States were left scrambling to catch up with reception needs. The temptation to make this\n\n reception need a problem for the neighbouring Member States must have been substantial.\n\n In addition, some MS on the \u2018Balkan route\u2019 have requested and received emergency funding\n\n to deal with the issues. However, there were also expectations among Member States\n\n affected that the EU agencies and/or other MS would extend their hand to provide substantial\n\n help in terms of human resources for border guards or police functions, though not that much\n\n in terms of asylum support services and caseworkers. This led to creative solutions; the\n\n Slovenian authorities, for example, established common police patrols under the Pr&uuml;m\n\n\n\n decision.109\n\n The actual responses to the refugee and security crises varied from reintroducing intra-\n\n Schengen border controls under the SBC to informal responses such as using police checks\n\n at internal borders and even setting up fences. This placed renewed strain on the new\n\n governance system put in place in the aftermath of the Franco-Italian affair (See Section 2).\n\n This section further sets out the legal and practical issues, which arose when implementing\n\n the Schengen Borders Code in the light of the refugee crisis.\n\n 4.1. A legal assessment of the justifications provided by Member States on the\n\n reintroduction of intra Schengen border controls 2015-16\n\n The criteria against which any justification by a Schengen state to reintroduce border controls\n\n with another Schengen state must be assessed are now set out in Regulation 2016/399. The\n\n Regulation, in Articles 21 and 25\u201330, sets out the conditions under which the reintroduction\n\n of intra-Schengen state border controls can (lawfully) be applied.\n\n The first requirement of Article 25, setting the general framework, is that there must be a\n\n \u201cserious threat to public policy or internal security\u201d in a Member State. There is no definition\n\n of \u2018public policy\u2019 in the Regulation. There may be a presumption that the meaning is\n\n consistent with the use of the same words in other EU instruments (including the Treaties,\n\n which use the same words).\n\n In 2011 the European Parliament published a detailed study on the meaning of public policy\n\n 108 Interview with German Permanent Representation, 27.05.2016; Slovenian Permanent Representation,\n\n 30.05.2016.\n\n 109 Interview with Slovenian Permanent Representation, 30.05.2016.\n\n\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 40\n\n in the context of EU instruments of private international and procedural law.110 The public\n\n policy exception is consistently narrowly interpreted by the CJEU as a restriction on a right.\n\n This is likely to be the case here as well, as the subject matter is a core principle of the\n\n internal market, i.e. the free movement of persons.111 This principle is set out in recital 27\n\n of the SBC (emphasis added):\n\n \u201cIn accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, a derogation\n\n from the fundamental principle of free movement of persons must be interpreted strictly\n\n and the concept of public policy presupposes the existence of a genuine, present and\n\n sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society.\u201d\n\n As the legal base of the SBC is Article 77(2)(b) of the TFEU, which sets out the procedure to\n\n ensure the absence of controls on persons, whatever their nationality, when crossing internal\n\n borders, a narrow meaning of the exception on the grounds of public policy consistent with\n\n the meaning of the term as used elsewhere in the free movement of persons context is\n\n justified. The CJEU considered the compatibility of public policy with police checks inside the\n\n border in its Adil ruling112. The court found that police controls inside the border area which\n\n are selective and do not resemble border controls but are police measures aimed at\n\n combating illegal residence, whether they fall under the concept of public order or public\n\n security, are compatible with the Regulation. But it did not clarify the scope of the test of the\n\n use on the grounds of public policy (see the Case Summary in Annex 1).\n\n Internal security is similarly not defined in the Regulation. The term is less frequently used\n\n in EU law, though it exists in the TFEU, notably in Article 72.113 The EU has an internal security\n\n\n\n strategy that includes tackling serious and organised crime, terrorism and radicalisation,\n\n cybercrime, threats from new technologies, new and emerging threats and crises, natural\n\n and man-made disasters.114 A link could be inferred regarding the meaning of internal\n\n security from the choice of subjects included in the strategy of that name. In any event,\n\n when a Schengen state seeks to use the internal security ground for the reintroduction of\n\n intra-Schengen border controls, reasons and justifications must be provided and explained.\n\n Whether the threat is one of organised crime or radicalisation, definitions, the nature and\n\n extent of the threat, the weight of the evidence of the threat and any relevant statistics would\n\n need to be provided.\n\n The reintroduction of intra-Schengen border controls must be exceptional and introduced as\n\n a last resort (Article 25(1) and (2)). Recital 23 of the SBC Preamble provides more clarity,\n\n stating (emphasis added):\n\n \u201cAs free movement of persons is affected by the temporary reintroduction of\n\n internal border control, any decision to reintroduce such control should be taken in\n\n accordance with commonly agreed criteria and should be duly notified to the\n\n 110 Hess, B., and Pfeiffer, T.

In any case, the\n\n reintroduction of internal border control should remain an exception and should only\n\n be effected as a measure of last resort, for a strictly limited scope and period of\n\n time, based on specific objective criteria and on an assessment of its necessity\n\n which should be monitored at Union level.\u201d\n\n This confirms the status of intra-Schengen border controls as an exception to a fundamental\n\n right \u2013 the free movement of persons. It further indicates that the interpretation of any\n\n exception should be narrow and that the monitoring of the use of the exception must not rest\n\n with the Member State that is applying it, but with the Union.\n\n It is worth noting that, according to recital 26 of the SBC (emphasis added):\n\n\n\n \u201cMigration and the crossing of external borders by a large number of third-country\n\n nationals should not, per se, be considered to be a threat to public policy or\n\n internal security.\u201d\n\n Thus, where a Schengen state seeks to rely on the movement of persons across a Schengen\n\n border as a ground for reintroduction of controls, a justification well beyond the mere\n\n movement of persons must be involved. As Frontex reports in its 2016 Risk Analysis, at least\n\n 222,931,394 people entered the EU in 2015.115 These almost 223 million persons will have\n\n the possibility of crossing Schengen internal borders once inside the EU. Thus the movement\n\n of persons as a ground for the reintroduction of intra-Schengen border controls clearly must\n\n have a much more substantial content than numbers. Numbers over time and the purpose\n\n for which people come to the EU can have a differential impact on some Member States, in\n\n comparison with others, of course. People in need of international protection may need more\n\n assistance at the beginning of their stay if they have not been able to arrive with their goods\n\n and belongings like tourists. Yet, the scale of the numbers of persons in need of protection\n\n is dwarfed by those of travellers in general. There is a difference between the justifications\n\n offered by Sweden, which hosts quite a lot of beneficiaries of international protection, and\n\n Denmark and Norway, who host far fewer. But the argument that border controls are an\n\n appropriate way to engage with the different destinations of refugees is suspect. On the\n\n contrary, some of the proponents arguing for maintaining open borders are doing it not out\n\n of solidarity, but in the hope that they are just transit countries for asylum seekers (See Subsection\n\n 4.5 on Visegrad states). This reveals the tensions between the fairly well-functioning\n\n SBC and Dublin III, which has never functioned properly.\n\n\n\n The criteria for the temporary reintroduction of border controls (and their prolongation) are\n\n set out in Article 26. The main question that the Member State must assess is the extent to\n\n which the measure is likely to adequately remedy the threat to public policy or internal\n\n security and the proportionality of the measure in relation to the threat. Criteria that must\n\n be taken into account are:\n\n (a) The likely impact of any threats to public policy or internal security including following\n\n terrorist incidents or threats and including those posed by organised crime;\n\n (b) The likely impact of such a measure on the free movement of persons within the\n\n area without internal border controls.\n\n This means that Schengen states must provide exact details of the nature of the threat and\n\n its impact, which must be so substantial and immediate that it justifies the use of exceptional\n\n border control measures. Furthermore, the consequences of blocking EU citizens and their\n\n 115 Frontex (2016), Risk analysis for 2016.

The Commission is charged with\n\n ensuring that the justifications pass the proportionality test and fulfil the heavy evidential\n\n requirements of the Regulation and that Member States do not take these measures, which\n\n are profoundly negative in respect of the fundamental rights of the Treaties, lightly or on the\n\n basis of inadequate information.\n\n The procedural requirements also include substantive elements that must be satisfied by any\n\n Member State seeking to reintroduce such border controls. The Regulation requires evidence\n\n of the threat, including data, to be submitted to the Member States and the Commission. The\n\n Member States are obliged to provide very specific data as to the time and place so that the\n\n other Member States and the Commission can fully assess the proportionality of the measure\n\n against the threat that the Member State has specified and justified under Article 26.\n\n 4.2. Third country national movements or refugee movements?\n\n On an examination of the notifications made by the Member States which have reintroduced\n\n intra-Schengen border controls on the basis of the movement of third country nationals since\n\n 13 September 2015, there seems to be a noticeable shortage of detail on the reasons for the\n\n reintroduction of border controls.\n\n The German notifications116 seem to be motivated by exasperation with the Italian and Greek\n\n\n\n authorities\u2019 management of their external borders. The references, necessary according to\n\n the Regulation, to public order and internal security are without any specific detail.\n\n The same is true for the Austrian notifications117, which seem to have been based on the\n\n German ones. The Austrian authorities sought to bolster their public security argument in\n\n their 18 November 2015 notification118 by mentioning security deficits, but again there is no\n\n detail. However, the burden on the police is put forward as a reason in the 15 October\n\n notification.119 This is an interesting ground as it suggests that the public security threat is\n\n due to the shortage of Austrian law and order personnel available for deployment. In the\n\n notification of 14 March 2016120 the Austrian authorities continued their attack on Greek\n\n border controls: \u201cAustria, due to ascertained and still prevailing serious flaws in external\n\n border controls in Greece, will continue to conduct internal border controls for a further two\n\n months [&hellip;] This is the only way within the scope of legal and actual opportunities to avoid\n\n 116 German delegation (2015), Council Document, 11986/15.\n\n 117 Austrian delegation (2015), Council Document 12110/15.\n\n 118 Austrian delegation (2015),Council Document 14211/15.\n\n 119 Austrian delegation (2015), Council Document 13127/15.\n\n 120 Austrian delegation (2016), Council Document 7136/16.\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 43\n\n security deficits in the future for the benefit of all citizens within the Schengen area\u201d (see\n\n Annex 3 for more analysis).\n\n The claim that border controls within the Schengen area are of benefit for EU citizens is a\n\n rather hollow inversion of the obligation in Article 26 SBC to assess the impact of the controls\n\n\n\n on the free movement of persons. Instead of providing details of the obstacles that the border\n\n controls may constitute for EU citizens, the Austrian authorities seek to justify the controls\n\n (without any further data or arguments) on the basis of securing those citizens (see Annex\n\n 3 for more analysis).\n\n Slovenia was in and out very quickly, though it is clear that their authorities did not examine\n\n too carefully the requirements as regards the grounds for a reintroduction of border\n\n controls121 (see Annex 3 for more analysis).\n\n Hungary allegedly took some internal border measures from 17 to 26 October 2015, though\n\n no notifications are available in the Council Registry. The Hungarian authorities started\n\n building a fence along the internal border with Slovenia, though the measures were\n\n abandoned and it was then claimed that roadworks had been going on.122\n\n The Nordic Union countries appear to have their own specificities regarding the public\n\n security threat. The Swedish notifications provide a very interesting argument regarding the\n\n \u2018functioning of Swedish society\u2019 as one of three goals of Swedish security.123 This probably\n\n makes sense in a Swedish context but it is difficult to unpick from a distance. Norway is\n\n concerned about the unpredictability of arrivals as a security threat. In its notification of 14\n\n April 2016,124 the Norwegian authorities stated that \u201cthe number of asylum seekers arriving\n\n in Norway continues to be low. However, we still fear that this might change if the controls\n\n are lifted as the migratory pressure at the external border continues to be significant.\u201d On\n\n this basis there will never be a time when the controls should be lifted as their presence is\n\n based on nebulous fears. Denmark\u2019s public security threat appears to be that people might\n\n not move on as quickly as the Danish authorities would like because its neighbours have\n\n\n\n imposed carrier sanctions requiring travel companies to check ID documents (for more\n\n analysis, see Annex 3).\n\n None of these notifications fulfils the simple criterion in Article 26, i.e. the\n\n requirement to make a reasonable claim regarding the likely impacts of any threats to public\n\n policy or internal security, including following terrorist incidents or threats and including those\n\n posed by organised crime. The justifications amount to no more than bare assertions without\n\n any evidence, explanation or other material that might substantiate the claim.\n\n The objective of Article 26 is to require Schengen states to provide real information and\n\n credible claims on threats to public policy or internal security. Not one of the states has done\n\n this in any credible manner. The mere repetition of the words \u201cpublic policy\u201d and \u201cinternal\n\n security\u201d is not the equivalent of real grounds for the reintroduction of border controls as\n\n required by Article 26. Vague references to worries about over-burdened police, with no\n\n indication as to why the authorities are unable to transfer police from other regions to assist\n\n or to engage temporary officers to fill the gaps, are inadequate. Claims that other Member\n\n States (Greece and Italy) are not doing their job on border controls will be addressed further\n\n below in the context of the right to seek asylum under the Charter of Fundamental Rights\n\n 121 Slovenian delegation (2015), Council Document 12111/15.\n\n 122 Interview with Slovenian Permanent Representation, 30.05.2016.\n\n 123 Swedish delegation (2015), Council Document 14047/15.\n\n 124 Norwegian delegation (2016), Council Document 7948/16.\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 44\n\n (EUCFR). The threat to the functioning of Swedish society caused by the arrival of refugees\n\n\n\n would need much more explanation and development to satisfy the requirements of Article\n\n 26. The claim that the functioning of Swedish society is under stress is not substantiated by\n\n any statistics or data on the actual situation on the ground.\n\n The Belgian authorities reintroduced border controls with France on 24 February 2016 in the\n\n Province of West-Flanders. According to the notification125, the reason was the serious impact\n\n on public policy and internal security because of the situation in the North of France and the\n\n fact that the Port of Zeebrugge \u201ccreates a major pull effect to migrants trying to reach the\n\n UK\u201d.\n\n According to the notification, the Belgian police are faced with criminal organisations involved\n\n in the trafficking and smuggling of human beings, the visual presence of significantly\n\n increased numbers of irregular and homeless migrants has a negative effect on public\n\n security, and illegal intrusions into the port of Zeebrugge create unacceptable safety and\n\n security risks. Finally, the notification states that \u201cthe expected and announced closures of\n\n illegal settlements of migrants around the main port areas of Calais and Dunkirk&hellip;will most\n\n likely generate a further significant growth of the number of irregular migrants towards West-\n\n Flanders.\u201d In the second notification, the Belgian authorities126 accepted that \u201ctransmigrant\u201d\n\n numbers had dropped significantly but claimed that the security impact remained high. In\n\n particular the Belgian authorities sought to prevent the emergence of tent camps and noted\n\n the material damage, which \u201chas an impact on the general feeling of insecurity of the\n\n inhabitants of the region.\u201d The authorities stress the success of the measure to achieve a\n\n better level of security. In the next notification of 29 March127, 2016 the Belgian authorities\n\n noted that \u201cwith improved weather conditions ahead, the chances are that more people will\n\n want to attempt to cross over to the UK\u201d as a reason for the continuation of the border control\n\n with France. This weather argument was repeated in the notification of 13 April128 2016 \u201cthe\n\n\n\n risk is real that this rise [in numbers of migrants] will continue because of the start of the\n\n summer season and the better weather conditions.\u201d (See Annex 3 for more analysis).\n\n Noticeable in this Belgian series of notifications is the argument that border controls with\n\n France are necessary to prevent migrants from getting to the UK. The centrality of weather\n\n conditions is also interesting.\n\n In any event, nowhere are the requirements of Article 26 met. The likely impacts are not\n\n supported by any data other than the numbers of people seeking asylum in West Flanders,\n\n which rose from 133 in January 2015 to 783 in December 2015 but with no indication of\n\n where they came from. The assumption that these are arrivals from France is nowhere even\n\n mentioned in the notification. How border controls impact on port safety is a matter of some\n\n debate and the argument that the local inhabitants do not like to see homeless people on the\n\n streets should galvanise the authorities to provide shelter, as they are required to under the\n\n European Social Charter.129 The suggestion that predictions about the weather determine the\n\n movement of people is particularly surprising. While it is certainly the case that those best\n\n 125 Belgian delegation (2016), Council Document 6490/1/16.\n\n 126 Belgian delegation (2016), Council Document 7351/16.\n\n 127 Belgian delegation (2016), Council Document 7351/1/16.\n\n 128 Belgian delegation (2016), Council Document 7873/16.\n\n 129 European Committee of Social Rights (2009), Defence for Children International (DCI) v. the\n\n Netherlands, Complaint No. 47/2008, Council of Europe: European Committee of Social Rights, 20 October 2009.\n\n URL:            http://www.refworld.org/docid/4b9e37ea2.html [accessed 4 May 2016]; European Committee of Social \nRights\n\n (2013), Conference of European Churches (CEC) v.

How well do borders work as a response to terrorism?\n\n Two Member States reintroduced border controls on the basis of a terrorism threat \u2013 namely\n\n Malta and France. Malta suggested that the global terrorist threat was sufficient, which if\n\n accepted would mean that Malta might never lift intra-Schengen border controls again as the\n\n global terrorist threat is something so nebulous that it is unquantifiable.130 In the event,\n\n Malta lifted its border controls on 31 December 2015 (according to the European Commission)\n\n just in time for the New Year (see Annex 3).\n\n France justified its reintroduction of border controls on the basis of a national state of\n\n emergency. As the object of all three substantial terrorist attacks in the EU in 2015 (January,\n\n July and November) one can understand the view of the French authorities that they have a\n\n problem. Whether border controls are the solution is another question. However, for the\n\n moment, the Commission does not appear likely to challenge the French choice of border\n\n controls as a counter-terrorism measure. In the prolongation notification of 29 March,131 the\n\n French authorities noted that the three-month state of emergency in France from 13\n\n November 2015 until 13 February had been renewed for a further three months and so the\n\nhttp://www.refworld.org/docid/513d96582.html\n\n\n French authorities were extending their reintroduction of border controls for a similar period.\n\n A further notification on 25 April132 stated that, \u201cin light of the major ongoing terrorist threat,\n\n illustrated by the attack on Brussels on 22 March 2016, the French Government has decided\n\n to extend these border controls until 26 May 2016 inclusive\u201d (see Annex 3).\n\n It may well be that there is evidence of a terrorist threat on the border between Belgium and\n\n France but the question which must be answered with details and specific material according\n\n to Article 26 is how the reintroduction of border controls between them (and France has\n\n purported to introduce border controls with all neighbouring Member States) contributes to\n\n the task of dismantling terrorist network(s). All passengers who take the Thalys train from\n\n Paris to Brussels are acutely aware of the negative impact on travel these controls have for\n\n people seeking to leave France. But what is unclear is the positive impact there may be in\n\n counter-terrorism terms. The proportionality of the border control response to the terrorist\n\n threat needs a more thorough justification.\n\n 4.4. The scope of the controls\n\n There are three types of controls that may be invoked. The first are exceptional controls\n\n where an unforeseen event (or series of events) justifies the immediate reintroduction of\n\n border controls as there is not time to inform the other Member States and institutions. This\n\n type of border control can be extended for ten-day periods for up to two months. As soon as\n\n the threat is foreseeable, the second type of control must be used where advanced notice to\n\n the other Member States and institutions is required before the introduction of the controls.\n\n This form of control can be used for up to six months with regular updates regarding the\n\n continuing existence of the threat. The third type of control is one that must be based on\n\n\n\n exceptional circumstances where the overall functioning of the Schengen area is put at risk.\n\n This requires a decision of the Council on the basis of a proposal by the Commission specifying\n\n the nature of the risk and why it constitutes a threat to the overall functioning of the system.\n\n What happened in the period from 13 September 2015, when the first reintroduction of\n\n controls was announced by Germany on the first exception basis, is that all the Member\n\n 130 Maltese delegation (2015), Council Document 14731/15.\n\n 131 French delegation (2016), Council Document 7360/1/16.\n\n 132 French delegation (2016), Council Document 8217/16.\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 46\n\n States that reintroduced controls used the maximum period of two months on the exceptional\n\n un-notified basis, then the full period of the notified reintroduction of controls \u2013 a further six\n\n months. This seems rather calculated in order to maximise the available period for controls\n\n before a decision on exceptional circumstances putting at risk the overall functioning of the\n\n system would need to be taken.\n\n Turning to the scope of the border controls, here the notifications are more precise. All\n\n Member States (except Malta) provide some details of where they plan to carry out the border\n\n controls, as required by Article 27 of the SBC (former Article 24). In some cases the details\n\n about the exact border crossing points at which these will be conducted are fairly complete\n\n (for instance, as regards Austria) but in other cases are very imprecise, such as in the cases\n\n of Denmark and Norway. These include, for the most part, the names of the affected crossing\n\n points. There are fewer specifics on the date and duration of the reintroduction of border\n\n\n\n controls. The need to re-notify the institutions every 10/20/30 days or for the foreseeable\n\n duration means that there are quite a lot of notifications in the Council Registry, though it\n\n would seem that some are missing.\n\n An assessment of the impact of the border controls on public policy is generally missing.\n\n While there are standard statements in the notifications of the importance of public security,\n\n there are no specifics on why there is a threat that reaches the threshold of public security.\n\n Furthermore, there is little clarification on why border controls are a solution to any threat at\n\n all. No state seems willing to indicate how border controls at a small number of border\n\n crossing points with a few neighbours is going to solve security deficits. It is also worth\n\n remembering that these controls only apply to those border crossing points that Member\n\n States themselves have notified to the Commission under the SBC as places where the Code\n\n applies. So they do not automatically apply to green field border crossings (a matter of\n\n national law). As regards the grounds of internal security, here too there is a lack of precision.\n\n The need to make a proportionality assessment of the need for intra-Schengen border\n\n controls in light of the threat to internal security is entirely missing.\n\n None of the notifications address the impact on the free movement of persons within the\n\n Schengen area, though this is something that the Commission addresses in its assessment\n\n of the Austrian/German reintroduction of border controls (it notes that no EU citizens have\n\n complained to them, so apparently the controls are not annoying EU citizens).133 The 14\n\n March 2016 Austrian notification suggests that its reintroduction of border controls is, in\n\n fact, for the benefit of all citizens of the Union though there is no justification given for this\n\n statement.134\n\n\n\n 4.5. The Visegrad States\n\n The Visegrad states\u2019 position looks like something of a puzzle. In the statement of December\n\n 2015, they urged common, resolute and united action by Member States to preserve\n\n freedom of movement within Schengen, but, on the other hand, the same countries opposed\n\n a plan for the relocation of asylum seekers in order to address the arrival of high numbers of\n\n migrants at the external borders of the EU and they even started to build fences.\n\n 133 European Commission (2015), Commission Opinion of 23.10.2015 on the necessity and proportionality of the\n\n controls at internal borders reintroduced by Germany and Austria pursuant to Article 24(4) of Regulation No\n\n 562/2006 (Schengen Borders Code), C(2015) 7100 final, Brussels, 23.10.2015.\n\n 134 Austrian delegation (2016), Council document 7136/16.\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 47\n\n The only 2004-accession Member State to introduce border controls under Article 28 SBC\n\n was Slovenia135, and it dropped the controls quickly. In reaction to the Proposal for Council\n\n Implementing Decision, Slovenia questioned the proportionality of the measures maintained\n\n by Germany, Austria and the Nordic countries. Nevertheless, Slovenia was also among the\n\n countries that responded by building a fence on the border with Croatia, which is a Schengen\n\n candidate country.136\n\n On 17 December, in the margins of the European Council meeting, the Visegrad states (the\n\n Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and the Slovak Republic) issued a statement regarding the\n\n emergency introduction of intra-Schengen border controls.\n\n\n\n The statement is something of a warning to those states that have reintroduced border\n\n controls: \u201cA common resolute and united action is needed to improve, support and preserve\n\n Schengen as one of the cornerstones of the European integration project. We call on all true\n\n friends of Schengen to join this effort towards a conclusive debate on the key proposals\n\n tabled by the European Commission in this respect.\u201d137 Clearly, among the strongest\n\n supporters of a border-control-free Europe are those who arrived last at the table.\n\n For these states there has been a very sharp distinction drawn between the operation of the\n\n Schengen area and the arrival of refugees in unexpected numbers in the EU. While the\n\n Visegrad states were very solicitous of the correct application of the Schengen border control\n\n free system, they were highly resistant to the asylum re-location plan to distribute\n\n responsibility for the reception of asylum seekers, and the sorting of their claims, more evenly\n\n across the Member States. Because the relocation proposals shifted asylum seekers towards\n\n Visegrad states, they insisted that the relocation system had to be \u2018voluntary\u2019 for states, the\n\n very aspect which has hampered the implementation of the relocation system. The Czech\n\n Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia voted against the relocation scheme, adopted by\n\n the Council in September 2015, for the relocation of asylum seekers from Italy and Greece\n\n (and initially Hungary) to other Member States.138 Hungary has brought an action before the\n\n CJEU seeking annulment of the Council Decision, essentially arguing that this decision lacks\n\n a legal basis in EU law.139\n\n 135 The situation of Hungary is not available in the Council Registry, though the Commission states that it \nreintroduced\n\n intra-Schengen controls for a short period before lifting them.

The right to asylum, in light of the reintroduction of intra-Schengen border\n\n controls\n\n As noted above, the Schengen crisis is inherently linked to the arrival of unexpectedly\n\n substantial numbers of asylum seekers in the EU. Also, as pointed out above, among the\n\n main nationalities of origin, these asylum seekers have been recognised as refugees or have\n\n received subsidiary protection in very large percentages. So the crisis could well be framed\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/\nhttp://www.visegradgroup.eu/calendar/2015/joint-statement-of-the-151221-1\n\n\n as not so much one of border controls but rather of reception facilities and the duties of\n\n Member States. Border controls became a surrogate for the proper reception of asylum\n\n seekers and the correct operation of the CEAS. Instead, the language of \u2018crisis\u2019 transformed\n\n the appellation of people from \u201crefugees\u201d (which would soon be recognised) into \u201cillegal\n\n immigrants\u201d who were committing criminal acts by travelling through the Schengen bordercontrol-\n\n free area. The first consequence was to avoid responsibilities for reception and\n\n determination of refugee status under the CEAS. The second consequence has been to place\n\n refugees and people who should be receiving international protection and reception while\n\n their claims are being considered in danger of being criminalised for unauthorised border\n\n crossing, even though the borders are intra-Schengen ones where there should be no controls\n\n applied.\n\n Several Member States, in particular in their first notifications, refer exclusively to migrant\n\n flows and thus pre-suppose the entry of \u2018illegal\u2019 migrants and not refugees, which is striking.\n\n For example, Belgium mentioned \u201cvery large numbers of illegal immigrants.\u201d140 Slovenia\n\n referred firstly to \u201cuncontrollable migration flows\u201d and then to \u201cillegal migration\u201d.141 Austrian\n\n authorities, in their first notification, refer to \u201cthe huge migration flows\u201d and, in their\n\n subsequent notification, to \u201cenormous migration flows\u201d.142 German authorities claim to face\n\n an \u201cuncontrolled and unmanageable influx of third-country nationals into German territory\u201d\n\n and, in their subsequent notification, report an ongoing \u201cmassive influx of third country\n\n nationals\u201d.143 Danish authorities refer to mixed migration: \u201cmigrants and\n\n refugees\u201c.144 Similarly, Norwegian authorities referred to \u201can unpredictable migratory flow,\n\n containing a mix of asylum seekers, economic migrants, potential criminals [&hellip;], victims of\n\n crime.\u2019\u2019145 Finally, Swedish authorities, like their Nowegian and Danish counterparts,,\n\n referred to mixed migration and an \u201cunprecedented migratory flow\u201c, which \u201cmay include\n\n\n\n i.a. asylum seekers, economic migrants, potential criminals such as smugglers or traffickers\n\n of human beings, but also potential victims of crime\u201c.146\n\n The fact is, however, that the majority of third country nationals who have entered the EU\n\n irregularly since the summer of 2015 are in search of international protection.147 Of them,\n\n the majority are Syrian, Iraqi and Afghan, all nationalities with very high recognition rates\n\n as persons in need of international protection. As persons seeking international protection,\n\n they are entitled to the full application of the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol,\n\n the EUCFR and the CEAS. Only if third-country nationals arrive irregularly and do not seek\n\n international protection can they be treated as irregularly present and subject to sanctions.\n\n This is the consequence of Article 31 of the Refugee Convention, which states:\n\n 140 Belgian delegation (2016), Council document 6490/16.\n\n 141 Slovenian delegation (2015), Council documents 12111/15 and 12418/15.\n\n 142 Austrian delegation (2015), Council documents 12110/15 and 12435/15.\n\n 143 German delegation (2015), Council documents 11986/15 and 12984/15.\n\n 144 Danish delegation (2016), Council document 5021/16.\n\n 145 Norwegian delegation (2015), Council document 14633/15.\n\n 146 Swedish delegation (2015), Council document 14047/15.\n\n 147 EUROSTAT (2016), Asylum Statistics, at\n\n            http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Asylum_statistics..\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 49\n\n 1. The Contracting States shall not impose penalties, on account of their illegal entry\n\n or presence, on refugees who, coming directly from a territory where their life or\n\n freedom was threatened in the sense of article 1, enter or are present in their territory\n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Asylum_statistics\n\n\n without authorization, provided they present themselves without delay to the\n\n authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence.\n\n 2. The Contracting States shall not apply to the movements of such refugees\n\n restrictions other than those which are necessary and such restrictions shall only be\n\n applied until their status in the country is regularized or they obtain admission into\n\n another country. The Contracting States shall allow such refugees a reasonable period\n\n and all the necessary facilities to obtain admission into another country.\u201d\n\n There is a very lively debate in the international community about the meaning of \u201ccoming\n\n directly\u201d from a country of persecution. Courts in different EU states have interpreted the\n\n provision according to national law. For instance, in the UK, the term cannot be interpreted\n\n restrictively. In other words, a stop-off along the way should not exclude the refugee from\n\n protection. UK legislation states that the main considerations are the length of stay in the\n\n intermediate country, the reasons for the delay there, and whether or not the person sought\n\n protection there.148 The operation of the Dublin III Regulation, which sets out the\n\n responsibility of Member States for determining asylum applications made in the EU, is only\n\n one of the mechanisms at work.149\n\n Article 3 SBC states:\n\n \u201cThis Regulation shall apply to any person crossing the internal or external borders of\n\n Member States, without prejudice to:\n\n (a) the rights of persons enjoying the right to free movement under Union law;\n\n (b) the rights of refugees and persons requesting international protection, in\n\n particular as regards non-refoulement.\u201d\n\n This means that the rules of the SBC do not apply to those seeking international protection,\n\n as the Refugee Convention and the CEAS already apply to them and their arrival in and\n\n\n\n movement around the EU. Yet, the argument of the Member States is that asylum seekers\n\n should remain in the first Member State through which they enter the EU and seek asylum\n\n there (unless very specific special circumstances apply).150 In theory, if an asylum seeker\n\n continues his/her journey onwards to a more hospitable Member State to make the asylum\n\n application, he/she should be sent back to the first one. The Dublin III rule is ostensibly\n\n applicable irrespective of the failure of Member States to provide reception conditions as\n\n required under the CEAS, though both the CJEU and the ECtHR have effectively modified the\n\n rules in their judgments concerning Greece and Italy that vulnerable asylum applicants (and\n\n all asylum seekers for Greece) should not be returned to Greece and Italy (where they are\n\n families with children) because of the inadequacy of reception conditions there.151\n\n 148 UK Magistrate (1999) INLR 490 at 497A-C, case of Adimi.\n\n 149 Moreno-Lax, V.(2012), \"Dismantling the Dublin system: MSS v.

Instead, and in spite of Article 31 of the Refugee Convention, Member States insist\n\n that these people are irregularly present and have crossed the Schengen borders illegally\n\n (and therefore should be punished). The language of penalties is constantly present and the\n\n practice of criminalising asylum seekers is growing. According to the FRA, almost a third of\n\n people arriving irregularly in Hungary are prosecuted for the offence of unauthorised borderfence\n\n crossing.152 It would seem evident that Article 31 of the Refugee Convention ought to\n\n protect these asylum seekers from this kind of prosecution and yet there is a problem. The\n\n CJEU in a decision of 17 July 2014 held that it did not have jurisdiction to interpret Article\n\n 31.153 This was a somewhat surprising decision, not least in light of the pressing need for a\n\n consistent EU-wide interpretation of the application of penalties to those seeking asylum who\n\n have irregularly crossed EU internal frontiers. The facts of the case resemble those for so\n\n many of people moving across the continent in 2015-16. Mr Qurbani was an Afghan national\n\n who, having used the services of a people smuggler, entered Greece after passing through\n\n Iran and Turkey. He left Greece to travel, by plane, to Munich (Germany), with a forged\n\n Pakistani passport obtained from another people smuggler. He was arrested at Munich\n\n airport, after the authorities responsible for carrying out checks recognised that his passport\n\n was forged and he immediately applied for asylum. He was charged and convicted of\n\nhttp://www.refworld.org/docid/5458abfd4.html\n\n\n unauthorised entry, unauthorised stay and forgery of documents, notwithstanding Article 31.\n\n He appealed and eventually the matter was referred to the CJEU. Regardless of the fact that\n\n the TFEU requires the CEAS to be in conformity with the Refugee Convention and regardless\n\n of the fact that the CJEU had on other occasions interpreted the Refugee Convention in the\n\n context of the CEAS, in this case it found it had no jurisdiction to decide on the case. This\n\n refusal to deal with an important issue of EU law was exacerbated by the fact that the\n\n Qualification Directive154 specifically refers to Article 31 of the Refugee Convention (in Article\n\n 14).\n\n From the notifications that those Member States who reintroduced intra-Schengen border\n\n controls have submitted on grounds of migration, the failure of Greece either to prevent\n\n refugees from arriving in the first instance or to keep all those arriving in Greece is the main\n\n complaint (except in respect of Belgium where it is the failure of France to keep people who\n\n want to go to the UK in France). The Austrian authorities are particularly clear about this\n\n issue. The problem is that refugees arriving in Greece are entitled to seek asylum. As the\n\n reception conditions are appalling and the refugee sorting system is sclerotic in Greece, they\n\n are entitled to move on to other Member States (as the German chancellor acknowledged in\n\n August 2015). That onward movement should not turn them into \u2018illegal migrants\u2019 either in\n\n law or rhetoric. They are still in need of international protection, whether they be in Greece,\n\n Germany, Sweden or Belgium. The only question at issue is whether their successful attempt\n\n at \u2018self-relocation\u2019 should be recognised.\n\n 152 See FRA\u2019s website for regular overviews on borders and migration            \nhttp://fra.europa.eu/en/theme/asylummigration-\n\n borders/overviews/march-2016. A worrying development considered elsewhere in this study is the\n\n decision of the Dutch Raad van State that a person can be considered an irregularly arriving \u2018migrant\u2019 until such\n\n time as he or she makes an asylum claim: ABRS 24 December 2016, ECLI:NL:RVS:2015:4064\n\nhttp://fra.europa.eu/en/theme/asylummigration-\n\n\n 153 CJEU (2014), C- 481/13 Qurbani 17 July 2014, not yet reported.\n\n 154 European Union (2011), Directive 2011/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December\n\n 2011 on standards for the qualification of third-country nationals or stateless persons as beneficiaries of \ninternational\n\n protection, for a uniform status for refugees or for persons eligible for subsidiary protection, and for the content of\n\n the protection granted (recast), Brussels, 20.12.2011 OJ L 337 (Qualification Directive).\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 51\n\n 4.7. Exceptional circumstances and the overall functioning of the Schengen area\n\n Until 12 May 2016, the reintroduction of intra-Schengen border controls was notified on the\n\n basis of Article 28 (immediate action) \u2013 valid for two months, then Article 27, possible for six\n\n months. After this eight-month period the Member States were required to lift their intra-\n\n Schengen border controls unless Article 29 was invoked.\n\n This article provides for exceptional circumstances where the overall functioning of the\n\n Schengen area is put at risk as a result of persistent serious deficiencies relating to external\n\n border controls. Where those circumstances constitute a serious threat to public policy or\n\n internal security within the area, border controls may be reintroduced for six months.\n\n Thereafter they may be renewed three times (to a total of two years). This procedure is a\n\n last resort measure to protect the common interests of the area and can be used only where\n\n all other measures are ineffective in mitigating the serious threat identified. Under this\n\n provision the Council may recommend that one (or more) Member State(s) decide to\n\n reintroduce border control at all or at specific parts of their internal borders.\n\n\n\n This provision can be triggered only after an Article 21 support option has been exhausted.\n\n Under this measure, where serious deficiencies at the external border are identified in an\n\n evaluation prepared by the Commission with a view to ensuring compliance with the SBC,\n\n the Commission can recommend that the offending Member State take specific actions. These\n\n are:\n\n \u2022 Deploy Frontex Rapid Border Intervention Teams (RABITs) to manage the offending\n\n borders;\n\n \u2022 Submit a strategic plan based on a risk assessment to Frontex for its opinion (on\n\n effectiveness).\n\n As 2016 moved towards the summer, the triggering of Article 29 became increasingly likely\n\n as some of the Member States applying intra-Schengen border controls considered it\n\n necessary to continue them. Consequently, the Commission carried out its assessment of\n\n Greek border controls, as Greece was most closely connected with the arrival of refugees in\n\n the EU (mainly from Turkey) and the movement of these people northwards out of Schengen\n\n into Macedonia and then back into Schengen in Hungary or Austria. The Commission found\n\n the Greek controls in need of substantial change.155 The Commission identified the following\n\n timeline in its March 2016 Schengen Roadmap:156\n\n \u2022 12 May 2016 at the latest: Greece reports on the implementation of the Council\n\n recommendations.\n\n \u2022 12 May 2016: If the serious deficiencies in external border control persist, the\n\n Commission will present a proposal under Article 29(2) of the Schengen Borders Code.\n\n \u2022 13 May 2016: If the serious deficiencies in external border control persist, the Council\n\n\n\n should adopt a recommendation under Article 29(2) of the Schengen Borders Code\n\n for a coherent Union approach to temporary internal border controls.\n\n \u2022 16 May 2016: The Commission presents its Third Report on Relocation and\n\n Resettlement.\n\n \u2022 June 2016 at the latest: The co-legislators reach political agreement on the European\n\n Border and Coast Guard and adopt the legal act.\n\n 155 European Commission (2016), Assessment of Greece's Action Plan to remedy the serious deficiencies \nidentified\n\n in the 2015 evaluation on the application of the Schengen acquis in the field of management of the external \nborder,\n\n COM(2016) 220, Op. cit.\n\n 156 European Commission (2016), Back to Schengen - A roadmap, COM(2016) 120, Op. cit.\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 52\n\n \u2022 June 2016: The Commission presents its assessment of the possibility of resuming\n\n Dublin transfers to Greece.\n\n \u2022 August 2016 at the latest: The European Border and Coast Guard is operational.\n\n \u2022 September 2016 at the latest: The European Border and Coast Guard has delivered\n\n the first vulnerability tests so that any necessary preventive measures can be taken.\n\n \u2022 December 2016: If the overall situation allows, the target date for bringing to an end\n\n the exceptional safeguard measures taken.\n\n One of the key questions is: what is the nature of the persistent serious deficiencies in the\n\n Greek external border control? From the reasons given by the Schengen states for reintroducing\n\n\n\n border controls, the arrival of \u2018migrants\u2019, by which they appear to mean refugees,\n\n is the most consistent. Greece cannot refuse to admit refugees without potentially placing\n\n itself in breach of the Refugee Convention, the EUCFR and the CEAS. The Greek assessment\n\n affair is discussed in chapter 5, suffice it here only to note that the Greek authorities sent\n\n their action plan to the Commission on time and provided extensive information on their\n\n external border controls and measures to be taken to enhance them.\n\n Following the Greek response, on 4 May 2016, the Commission, in application of Article 29\n\n of the SBC, published a proposal for a Council Implementing Decision setting out a\n\n recommendation for temporary internal border controls in exceptional circumstances putting\n\n the overall functioning of the Schengen area at risk.157 This Decision, adopted on 12 May\n\n 2016, allows the maintenance of temporary border controls for a maximum of six months by\n\n Austria, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, as follows:\n\n \u2022 Austria at the Austrian-Hungarian border and Austrian-Slovenian border;\n\n \u2022 Germany at the German-Austrian border;\n\n \u2022 Denmark at the Danish ports with ferry connections to Germany and at the Danish-\n\n German land border;\n\n \u2022 Sweden in the Swedish harbours in the Police Region South and West and at the\n\n &Ouml;resund Bridge;\n\n \u2022 Norway in the Norwegian ports with ferry connections to Denmark, Germany, and\n\n Sweden.158\n\n The proposal was adopted by the Council159 with only minor amendments (see below). On\n\n 13 May Germany notified the Council and Commission that it would continue its border\n\n\n\n controls with Austria under the new legal basis160 and Austria followed suit the same day,\n\n concerning its border controls with Hungary and Slovenia.161 Both the Commission\u2019s proposal\n\n and the Council\u2019s recommendation confirm the intersection of intra-Schengen border controls\n\n and asylum reception capacity. The first paragraph of both preambles commences: \u201cThe EU\n\n is facing an unprecedented migratory and refugee crisis following a sharp increase of mixed\n\n migratory flows since 2015. This has led to severe difficulties in ensuring efficient external\n\n border control in accordance with the Schengen acquis and in the reception and processing\n\n of migrants arriving.\u201d\n\n 157 European Commission (2016), Proposal for a Council Implementing Decision setting out a recommendation for\n\n temporary internal border control in exceptional circumstances, COM (2016) 275, Op.

But the Commission accepted without question the justifications\n\n used by the Member States for the use of exceptional measures. Referring to the \u2018important\n\n secondary movements\u2019 of asylum seekers (though in the proposal they are designated as\n\n \u2018migrants\u2019), the Commission focused on questions of proper documentation and/or\n\n registration not taking place in Greece. The proposed recommendation specifically states, in\n\n paragraph 14 of the preamble, that \u201cthis risk of secondary movements is particularly high for\n\n those irregular migrants [sic] who are not accommodated in adequate reception facilities\u201d.\n\n The Commission merely found that serious deficiencies in external border control permitted\n\n the use of the new legal basis for intra-Schengen controls. However, for the purposes of\n\n triggering Article 29 SBC, the Commission makes two important choices. First, it excludes\n\n the application of intra-Schengen controls at air or sea borders, thus placing what one might\n\n call a travel mode limitation on the use of Article 29 SBC. The only source of serious threat\n\n is the movement of persons across land borders. This will ensure that the Greek economy is\n\n not hindered over the summer months by the application of intra-Schengen border controls\n\n on the flights and ferries so vital to its tourism industry. Secondly, the Commission specified\n\n carefully exactly which borders could be subject to controls (see above). By extension, this\n\n means that other borders cannot be subject to intra-Schengen controls under this proposal.\n\n The Commission appears to anticipate that there will be a gradual lifting of these exceptional\n\n\n\n border controls and that the application of the Article 29 SBC procedure will terminate at the\n\n end of 2016.\n\n The Council\u2019s recommendation made a few changes to the text proposed by the Commission.\n\n First, in paragraph 11 of the preamble regarding the appropriateness of using intra-Schengen\n\n border controls to displace asylum reception obligations, it added that that \u201cthese measures\n\n are necessary and are considered proportionate.\u201d Further, to address the complaint of some\n\n Member States that their neighbouring states introducing the controls had failed to consult\n\n or notify them, the Council added in Article 1 \u201cBefore introducing such controls the Member\n\n State concerned should exchange views with the relevant neighbouring Member State(s) with\n\n a view to ensuring that internal border controls are proportionate, in accordance with the\n\n [SBC]\u201d.\n\n Finally, the commitment of the Council and the Commission to ending the intra-Schengen\n\n controls is made clear in Article 3 of the recommendation, which states that the controls\n\n permitted under it should be targeted and limited in scope, frequency, location and time, to\n\n what is strictly necessary to respond to the serious threat and to safeguard public policy and\n\n internal security. Further, the Member States are required to carry out regular reviews and\n\n adjust controls to the level of threat addressed, including phasing them out wherever\n\n appropriate.\n\n The policy adopted by the Commission and the Council as regards the reintroduction of intra-\n\n Schengen border controls appears to be to allow the Member States a wide latitude as regards\n\n the grounds for the introduction of controls. No systematic or comprehensive assessment of\n\n the grounds provided by the Member States using the powers was undertaken. Indeed, there\n\n is little to indicate that the Commission used its power to request additional information,\n\n except in one or possibly two cases. On the other hand, both the Commission and the Council\n\n\n\n are seeking to manage the situation by limiting the types of controls that can be carried out\n\n 162 Those aspects of the Proposal which relate to the Greek assessment are addressed in Sub-Section 5.1.\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 54\n\n and the places where this can be done. There seems to be a containment policy at work,\n\n which will gradually squeeze the space for controls down to nothing. The notification\n\n obligations on Member States using the Article 29 SBC exception are likely to be applied\n\n intensively under the Commission\u2019s supervision. This will concentrate the minds of the civil\n\n servants who are charged with justifying the continued use of Article 29 of the SBC.\n\n 4.8. Informal borders and fences\n\n Instead of the formal temporary reintroduction of internal border controls on the basis of\n\n Article 25 of the SBC, Member States such as the Netherlands have used Article 23 of the\n\n SBC (formerly Article 21) as a legal basis to enhance police checks in response to the\n\n increasing numbers of migrants. Other Member States, such as Hungary and Austria, opted\n\n for even farther-reaching measures, such as building fences. Though all these measures\n\n indicates that the line between border control and other internal security measures is\n\n increasingly blurring.\n\n 4.8.1. Border control as a contribution to EU internal security\n\n Current controversies over the governance of the Schengen area need also to be understood\n\n in the context of a transformation of how border control relates to EU policy in the field of\n\n internal security. Internal and external border control measures are increasingly associated\n\n with, and embedded within, the concerns and priorities of EU internal security, rather than\n\n\n\n simply involving the issue of controlling access to the territory of the Member States of the\n\n European Union.\n\n The association between access control and internal security is clearly shown in the April\n\n 2016 communication of the European Commission on \u201cStronger and Smarter Information\n\n Systems for Borders and Security\u201d163 accompanying the proposal for the establishment of an\n\n Entry/Exit System.164 The communication argues for \u201cthe need to join up and strengthen the\n\n EU\u2019s border management, migration and security cooperation frameworks and information\n\n tools in a comprehensive manner\u201d, pointing out that \u201c[b]order management, law\n\n enforcement, and migration control are dynamically interconnected\u201d.165 The argument\n\n concerns in particular counter-terrorism policy, but also touches upon EU measures related\n\n to organised crime, and is framed in terms of \u201cgaps\u201d in \u201cthe very broad spectrum of data\u201d166\n\n already accessible and available to border control and law enforcement authorities in the EU,\n\n including to EU JHA agencies.167 The \u201cjoining up\u201d of border control and internal security, then,\n\n is operationalised in particular through an extensive discussion of interoperability. The\n\n Commission recommends considering four steps, including the development of a single\n\n search interface \u201cto query several [border control and law enforcement] information systems\n\n simultaneously and to produce combined results on one single screen\u201d, interconnectivity of\n\n information systems that would allow systems to automatically consult the data they\n\n respectively contain, the sharing of a single biometric matching service, and a common\n\n repository of data for information systems.168 Beyond this specific communication and\n\n proposals, the joining up of border control and policing also informs other initiatives. This\n\n concerns in particular the new ECBG, where, according to the interviews conducted for the\n\n\n\n 163 European Commission (2016), Stronger and Smarter Information Systems for Borders and Security, \nCOM(2016)\n\n 205 final, Brussels, 6.4.2016.\n\n 164 European Commission (2016), Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council \namending\n\n Regulation (EU) 2016/399 as regards the use of the Entry/Exit System, COM(2016) 196 final.\n\n 165 European Commission (2016), Stronger and Smarter Information Systems for Borders and Security, \nCOM(2016)\n\n 205 final, Brussels, 6.4.2016, p. 2.\n\n 166 Ibid, p. 12.\n\n 167See Annex 2 for further analysis.\n\n 168 European Commission (2016), Stronger and Smarter Information Systems for Borders and Security, Op. cit., \np.\n\n 14.\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 55\n\n study, the new body would have access to SIS II, in addition to having use of Eurodac for\n\n return operations169.\n\n In many ways, these proposals echo earlier measures called for by the European Commission\n\n and by the Council in the context of information management for the area of freedom,\n\n security and justice.170 How they meet current concerns with EU internal and external borders\n\n is therefore unclear. In the meantime, the closer association advocated between access\n\n control and internal security should raise questions. Access/border control is a specific\n\n concern, which involves dealing with, at times, particularly vulnerable individuals who should\n\n\n\n benefit from specific rights and protections. Making border control an integral part of internal\n\n security measures, in this respect, may well undermine the specific challenges and priorities\n\n associated with this subject matter, and further weaken the status of already vulnerable\n\n persons (see Annex 2 for further analysis).\n\n 4.8.2. Police checks at internal borders \u2013 the line remains unclear\n\n Police checks within the territory, including border areas, are allowed insofar as the exercise\n\n of these police powers does not have an effect equivalent to border checks. \u2018Border checks\u2019\n\n are defined in Article 2 of Regulation 2016/399 as \u2018checks carried out at border crossing\n\n points, to ensure that persons, including their means of transport and the objects in their\n\n possession, may be authorised to enter the territory of the member states or authorised to\n\n leave it\u2019. Article 23(a) of the SBC clarifies that the exercise of police powers shall not have\n\n the objective of border controls; they must be based on general police information and\n\n experience \u2018regarding possible threats to public security and aim, in particular, to combat\n\n cross-border crime\u2019. Furthermore they must be devised and executed in a manner clearly\n\n distinct from systematic checks on persons at the external borders, and carried out on the\n\n basis of \u2018spot checks\u2019.\n\n In its case law, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has provided further criteria\n\n on this use of police checks to ensure these checks would not have an effect equivalent to\n\n \u2018border checks\u2019 as prohibited in Article 22 of the SBC.171 In Melki and Abdeli, the CJEU\n\n affirmed that Articles 22 and 23 (former 20 and 21) of the SBC also apply to border areas\n\n within 20km of the internal borders and prohibit national legislation granting national police\n\n authorities the power to check the identity of any person, \u2018irrespective of his behaviour and\n\n\n\n of specific circumstances giving rise to a risk of breach of public order\u2019.172 Based on this\n\n criterion, Schengen States are obliged to specify, in their national rules, the criteria for using,\n\n and the frequency of, the internal borders controls to be applied. From the wording of\n\n 23(a)(ii) (former 21) of the SBC, one can deduce that police checks in border areas should\n\n specifically address public security threats, such as cross-border crimes. In the Adil\n\n judgment, the CJEU, responding to a question of a Dutch court assessing the lawfulness of\n\n mobile police checks, held that police checks within the border areas with the objective of\n\n combating illegal residence would not be prohibited under Article 23(a)(ii) (former 21) of the\n\n SBC.173 However, these checks must be based on \u2018general information and experience\n\n 169 See Articles 6a and 43 of Regulation (EU) 2016/&hellip; of the European Parliament and of the Council of \n&hellip; on the\n\n European Border [and Coast] Guard and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004, Regulation (EC) No 863/2007\n\n and Council Decision 2005/267/EC, and amending Regulation (EU) 2016/399 of the European Parliament and of\n\n the Council (not yet published in the OJ, agreed in LIBE committee on 27.06.2016)\n\n 170 European Commission (2010), Overview of information management in the area of freedom, security and \njustice,\n\n COM(2010) 385 final, Brussels, 20.7.2010; Council (2014), Draft Council Conclusons on an updated Information\n\n Management Strategy (IMS) for EU internal security, 15701/1/14 REV1, Brussels, 24.11.2014.\n\n 171 Article 22 of the SBC reads: \u201cInternal borders may be crossed at any point without a border check on \npersons,\n\n irrespective of their nationality, being carried out\u201d.\n\n 172 CJEU (2010), C-188/10 and C-189/10, Melki and Abdeli, 22 June 2010.\n\n 173 CJEU (2011), C-278/12 PPU, 19 July 2012, Adil, para 65-67.\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 56\n\n regarding the illegal residence of persons at the places where the checks are to be made\u2019\n\n and the carrying out of those checks must be subject \u2018to certain limitations concerning, inter\n\n alia, their intensity and frequency.\u2019 With this conclusion, allowing the use of police checks in\n\n border areas for immigration control purposes on the basis of Article 23(a), the CJEU made\n\n a direct connection between irregular immigration and possible threats to public security.\n\n Taking into account this CJEU case law, the Dutch rules on internal border controls were\n\n amended in 2014 to intensify the frequency and duration of mobile border checks in the\n\n border areas (\u2018MTV\u2019 checks\u2019 or \u2018Mobiel Toezicht Veiligheid\u2019).174 At the same time, a new rule\n\n was added according to which, on a temporary basis, the controls at both land, sea, and air\n\n borders could be intensified in the case of \u2018a sudden or expected increase of irregular migrants\n\n crossing at the borders\u2019. In this situation, which requires a decision of the State Secretary of\n\n Security and Justice, the maximum number of border checks is doubled.175 This power of\n\n intensified police checks was used for the first time in September 2015, in response to the\n\n increasing number of refugees arriving in the Netherlands. The decision to use this power\n\n was amongst other things, based on the justification to \u2018prevent human smugglers from\n\n misusing the vulnerable position of asylum seekers\u2019. Since September 2015, the Dutch\n\n government has extended the use of this exceptional power for border checks several\n\n times.176 In this latter decision, also referring to the terrorist attacks in Paris on 13 November,\n\n the Secretary of State mentioned three goals of these intensified border checks:\n\n \u2022 fighting irregular migration and human smuggling;\n\n\n\n \u2022 preventing humanly degrading incidents (such as people dying in trucks), and;\n\n \u2022 preventing substantial public order and national security incidents in the Netherlands.\n\n In looking at case law assessing the legitimacy of these intensified border checks, which was\n\n necessary to decide on the lawfulness of the detention of migrants caught during these\n\n checks, two Dutch courts reached opposite decisions in 2015.177 Whereas the Groningen\n\n court found that the decision of 16 October 2015 on the use of intensified border checks did\n\n not violate the conditions included in the SBC, the Rotterdam court held the Dutch reasons\n\n for deploying this measure invalid. The latter court decision was annulled by the highest\n\n administrative court in December 2015.178 According to this court in the Netherlands, the\n\n Dutch government legitimately considered the influx of asylum seekers as a specific\n\n indication of an expected increase of irregular migration in the near future, which justified\n\n the use of intensified border controls. The main argument of the Dutch court in coming to\n\n this conclusion was that asylum seekers are irregular migrants at the time they cross the\n\n internal borders of the EU and before they apply for asylum. This classification of asylum\n\n seekers as illegal immigrants is problematic for two reasons. First, it allows the extended use\n\n of internal border checks, contrary to the purposes of the SBC. Second, based on this\n\n 174 Decision of 2 July 2014, published in the Dutch Official Journal (Staatsblad) 2014, no. 250. Generally, these \nrules\n\n provide that on a daily basis, twenty trains may be checked, of which only three trains for each \u2018connection/line\u2019. In\n\n each train only one part may be examined, of which a maximum of four wagons. Dealing with the prevention of\n\n irregular immigration, the Dutch rules provide that border checks may be performed for a maximum of 90 hours\n\n per month, of which six hours a day.\n\n\n\n 175 In practice this means that, for border checks on motorways, the maximum time of border checks is 180 \nhours\n\n a month, of which 12 hours a day.\n\n 176 16 October 2015, 23 November 2015, 1 February 2016 and most recently 2 March 2016.

Contrary to the application of Article 25 of the SBC for the temporary reintroduction\n\n of border controls, the use of border checks, according to Article 23, is more ambiguous,\n\n both concerning the purpose for which they are used (public security or immigration control?)\n\n and the conditions under which these controls may take place. What is the point of prohibiting\n\n checks to ensure that people are allowed to enter or to leave the territory at the internal\n\n borders between Schengen states, if exactly the same objective can be achieved by Member\n\n\n\n States allowing police checks within 20km of the internal borders to prevent irregular\n\n immigration? With regard to the conditions for police checks, it is important to note that the\n\n use of intensified border checks as performed by the Dutch authorities does not require the\n\n prior notification of the Commission or other Member States. Furthermore, the criteria\n\n included in Article 25 of the SBC do not apply, such as the presence of a serious threat to\n\n public policy or internal security and the condition that border controls may only be\n\n reintroduced as measure of \u2018last resort\u2019.180 Thus, questions remain not only on the intensity\n\n and the circumstances under which border checks may be applied in order to ensure that\n\n these checks are not equivalent to border controls, but also with regard to the implied\n\n purposes of border checks and controls.181\n\n In January 2016, a German lower court (the Amtsgericht Kehl), dealing with a person\n\n suspected of the illegal import of drugs, submitted a preliminary question to the CJEU on\n\n whether the police checks, on which the prosecution was based, were allowed under Articles\n\n 23 and 24 (former 20 and 21) of the SBC, if these police checks had been applied irrespective\n\n of the individual behaviour of the person at stake and the specific circumstances, and in the\n\n absence of any temporary reintroduction of border controls at the relevant internal border.182\n\n Although the questions of the German court did not specifically address the the use of border\n\n checks for the purpose of immigration control, the answers of the CJEU might provide further\n\n clarification on the legitimacy of border checks within the internal border areas under Article\n\n 23 (former 21) of the SBC.\n\n 4.8.3. Fences: a solution permitted only for external borders?\n\n The increasing number of asylum seekers arriving in Europe in 2015 resulted in several\n\n\n\n unilateral actions by Member States, including the setting up of physical barriers at both\n\n internal and external borders of the Schengen area. The first MS to build fences at internal\n\n borders was Hungary, as Hungarian authorities reportedly started building a fence with\n\n Slovenia to re-direct the flow of refugees.183 Subsequently the fence with Slovenia was\n\n demolished and Hungary continued to build fences on its external borders with Croatia and\n\n Serbia. In February 2016, Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced his intention to develop a\n\n 179 See the annotation of Evelien Brouwer to this judgment, JV 2016, no. 54 (in Dutch).\n\n 180 In the Netherlands, the government promised only following the advice of the Dutch Advisory Committee on\n\n Migration Affairs, to inform the European Commission on a \u2018confidential basis\u2019 about the use of intensified border\n\n checks, Explanatory memorandum to the Decision of 2 July 2014, Staatsblad 2014, no. 250 p. 9.\n\n 181 Cornelisse, G.

After severe criticism by the European Commission in April\n\n 2016 of the plans for fences at the borders with Italy at the Brenner Pass, the Austrian\n\n government announced, on 13 May 2016, that it would withdraw this plan.\n\n 4.9. No complaint \u2013 No Impact on free movement of persons?\n\n The above legal analysis indicates the weight attributed to the free movement of persons\n\n across the EU, as one of the greatest achievements of Schengen. Nevertheless, none of the\n\n notifications have elaborated on how the measures will be applied in a way that least\n\n impinges upon free movement. The Commission seemed to be satisfied with the formula\n\n used by the Member States that the measures would be used if \u201cstrictly necessary\u201d.186 In\n\n addition, Commission officials explained that no official complaints had been received\n\n regarding the internal borders impinging upon the free movement of the EU citizens.187\n\n Nevertheless, there is a noticeable growing concern among EU citizens and in particular\n\n among youth organisations who actively advocate the free movement of persons within the\n\n Schengen area.188 The campaigns such as \u201cDon\u2018t Touch My Schengen\u201c or \u201cSchengen Watch\u201c\n\n show the increasing concern about the lack of legal certainty as regards free movement\n\n rights. Youth organisations mentioned their personal experiences of being stopped by police\n\n at internal borders and subjected to what looked like a border control.189\n\n The lack of transparency and legal certainty is raising more questions among EU citizens. For\n\n example, the European Citizens Action Service (ECAS), which runs \u201cYour Europe Advice\u201c\n\n providing legal advice for mobile EU citizens, has experienced a 9.4% increase in enquiries\n\n in 2015 compared to 2014, which is indicative of an increasing sentiment of uncertainty\n\n\n\n among citizens about the practical implementation of free movement.\n\n 184 Nick Gutteridge, \u201cThe Great Wall of Europe: Hungary splits continent in two with huge fence to stop migrants,\u201d\n\n February 29, 2016 in Express.co.uk at            http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/648269/Hungary-plan-fence-\nborder-\n\n Romania-migrants-refugees-crisis-Viktor-Orban-Schengen.\n\n 185 Barbara Surknov, \u201cSlovenia Builds Border Fence to Stem Flow of Migrants,\u201d November 11, 2015 in New York\n\n Times.

This hampers democratic\n\n debate on the necessity and proportionality of the reintroduction of border controls or\n\n police checks at the border areas.\n\n 5.1. Results of the Schengen Evaluation and Monitoring Mechanism\n\n The SEM contains assessments of both external and internal borders, with the latter one of\n\n the innovations of the Schengen governance reform.190 The evaluation involves\n\n questionnaires sent to MS, as well as announced and unannounced visits.\n\n 5.1.1. Evaluation of external borders\n\n The SEM Regulation states that a team of experts from the Member States and the\n\n Commission - with relevant EU agencies as observers - can carry out an evaluation of the\n\n application of the Schengen acquis. The SEM provides a range pf evaluations, from the\n\n management of external and internal borders to returns, the SIS, the VIS, and judicial and\n\n police cooperation. Article 10 of the SEM provides for the composition of teams for both\n\n\n\n announced and unannounced on-site visits. Article 11 of the SEM provides the basis\n\n thequestionnaire to be sent to MS. This sub-section further analyses the outcomes of regular\n\n SEM external border evaluations conducted in Greece, Austria, Sweden, Belgium and Poland.\n\n 5.1.1.1. Greece\n\n An external borders evaluation team visited Greece from 10 to 13 November 2015, during\n\n the very peak of the refugee crisis, to conductn unannounced on-site evaluation visit. Experts\n\n went to Greek sea border sites (Chios and Samos Islands) and land border crossings with\n\n Turkey (Orestiada, Fylakio, Kastanies, Nea Vyssa).\n\n In the annual evaluation programme for 2016, the announced on-site visits to Greece were\n\n planned for April 2016 as one of six or seven MS to be evaluated in that year. Apparently, in\n\n the second section (non-published part) of the annual evaluation programme for 2015, an\n\n unannounced visit to Greece was planned for November 2015.\n\n When making decisions, the Commission applies Article 38 of the SBC, using \u2018the committee\n\n procedure\u2019 within the scope of Regulation No 182/2011 meaning that the decision-making\n\n remains secret and is led by DG HOME, with consultation with all the relevant Commissioners\n\n 190 Interview with an MEP, 01.06.2016.\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 60\n\n and the President. This comitology procedure explicitly excludes MEPs and thus lacks\n\n democratic accountability.\n\n Following such a procedure, on 2 February 2016, the Commission adopted a report detailing\n\n the findings and assessments, and listing best practices and deficiencies identified during this\n\n evaluation.191 There were suggestions that this draft report was modified on its way up the\n\n\n\n Commission hierarchy. Allegedly, the political context and pressure from MS eager to\n\n maintain border controls were also important for reaching these conclusions.192 According to\n\n this report, the on-site visit revealed serious deficiencies in the carrying out of external border\n\n control by Greece, in particular due to the lack of appropriate identification and registration\n\n of irregular migrants on the islands, of sufficient staff, and of sufficient equipment for\n\n verifying identity documents. However, during the 21 March 2016 LIBE Committee meeting,\n\n the Greek authorities admitted to a lack of EURODAC machines on the small islands, though\n\n not SIS II machines.193\n\n According to the Commission, under the current circumstances, situational awareness and\n\n reaction capability are not sufficient for effective border surveillance. The Commission\u2019s\n\n choice of words is severe: the serious deficiencies relating to external border control in Greece\n\n \u2018constitute a serious threat to public policy and internal security and put at risk the overall\n\n functioning of the area without internal border control\u2019. The Commission report, which\n\n focuses solely on Greece, emphasises failures in Greek border management without taking\n\n so much into account that other Member States may not have fulfilled their obligations in\n\n assisting Greece. Thus, the Commission sent a subliminal message that any country alone\n\n would not be able to manage border controls under such pressure, but then found Greece\n\n guilty for not managing them.\n\n In a decision of 12 February 2015, the Council adopted a recommendation addressing \u2018serious\n\n deficiencies\u2019 identified in the 2015 evaluation on the application of the Schengen acquis in\n\n the field of external border management by Greece, including during the un-announced onsite\n\n visit in November 2015 to the external borders.194 In this recommendation, 49 points\n\n\n\n were listed, covering the registration procedure, border surveillance, risk analysis,\n\n international cooperation, human resources and training, border checks procedure, and\n\n infrastructure and equipment. In accordance with Article 15(3) of the SEM, this\n\n recommendation was sent to the European Parliament and the national parliaments.\n\n This Council Decision was followed by a Commission Implementing Decision of 24 February\n\n 2016, setting out recommendations on specific measures to be taken by Greece.195 The\n\n Commission\u2019s recommendation was based on Article 29 SBC and the Council\u2019s\n\n recommendation on Article 15 (3) of the SEM. The Decision of the Commission included 14\n\n measures. These measures partly covered the same fields as the Council recommendation\n\n (border surveillance and border checks, registration, and identification), with the exception\n\n of international cooperation, and including measures dealing with the reception and return of\n\n 191 European Commission (2016), Commission Implementing Decision in accordance with Article 14(5) of \nRegulation\n\n (EU) No 1053/2013 of 7 October 2013, Brussels, 02.02.2016.\n\n 192 Interviews with Council, 19.05.2016, German Permanent Representation, 27.05.2016 and Slovenian \nPermanent\n\n Representation, 30.05.2016.\n\n 193 LIBE Committee (2016), LIBE hearing on 21.03.2016, Discussion on the situation of the Schengen area.\n\n 194 Council (2016), Council Implementing Decision setting out a Recommendation on ddressing the serious\n\n deficiencies identified in the 2015 evaluation of the application of the Schengen acquis in the field of management\n\n of the external borders by Greece, Council document 5985/16, Brussels, 12.02.2016.\n\n 195 European Commission (2016), Commission Implementing Decision of 24.2.2016 setting out a \nrecommendation\n\n on specific measures to be taken by the Hellenic Republic following the evaluation report of 2 February 2016, \nC(2016)\n\n\n\n 1219 final, Brussels, 24.2.2016.\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 61\n\n irregular migrants and funding. The Greek authorities were requested to report to the\n\n Commission no later than 12 March 2016 on the measures taken to implement the\n\n recommendations. In the meantime, the Commission published its \u201cBack to Schengen\u201d\n\n Communication, setting a deadline of 12 May for taking a decision under Article 29, the date\n\n coinciding with the end of German and Austrian internal border controls.196\n\n Based on the assessment of the Action Plan presented by the Greek government, the\n\n Commission published an adequacy assessment on 12 April 2016.197 Meanwhile, another\n\n announced visit to Greece took place between 10 and 16 April 2016. In the adequacy\n\n assessment, the Commission found that \u2018significant progress\u2019 had been made by Greece, but\n\n that, for many actions, more clarity was needed in terms of timing, responsibility and financial\n\n planning. Whereas some actions could not be adequately addressed or completed, for other\n\n actions additional information was needed. To provide this further information, the Greek\n\n authorities were given until 26 April 2016. According to the Commission, the Hellenic\n\n government provided the requested additional elements and clarifications on its Action Plan\n\n by the deadline, though the Commission gave no further details on the actual measures or\n\n actions adopted.198\n\n 5.1.1.2. Austria\n\n In November 2015, the Council adopted a recommendation with remedial actions for Austria\n\n to address the deficiencies identified during the Schengen evaluation in the field of\n\n management of the external border carried out in 2015.199 The 18 recommendations covered\n\n\n\n the integrated border management strategy, inter-agency cooperation, risk analysis system,\n\n training of border guards, border checks (including the recommendation to pay particular\n\n attention to minors and stamping of documents of family members of Union citizens), and\n\n procedures at the Salzburg and Vienna airports. The evaluation team assessed how privacy\n\n is ensured during the performance of interviews in the \u2018second line checks\u2019, when the person\n\n is brought to a separate location for further investigation on whether he/she meets all entry\n\n conditions for third-country nationals. Furthermore, based on the 2015 Schengen evaluation\n\n on Austria addressing deficiencies in the return policy, the Council adopted a decision\n\n including recommendations dealing with this field.200 In February 2016, the Council adopted\n\n recommendations addressing deficiencies identified in the 2015 evaluation in the field of the\n\n SIS.201 In response to the recommendations on the external borders and return, Austria\n\n submitted action plans which were not published in the Council Registry.202\n\n 196 European Commission (2016), Back to Schengen - A roadmap, COM(2016) 120 final, Op.cit.\n\n 197 European Commission (2016), Assessment of Greece's Action Plan, COM (2016) 220 final, Op.cit.\n\n 198 European Commission (2016), Commission proposal for a Council Implementation Decision setting out a\n\n recommendation for temporary internal border control in exceptional circumstances, COM (2016) 275, p. 5.\n\n 199 Council (2015) Schengen evaluation of Austria - Council Recommendation on addressing the deficiencies\n\n identified in the 2015 evaluation on the application of the Schengen acquis in the field of management of the \nexternal\n\n border, Council doc. 14067/15, Brussels, 17.11.2015; Based on the European Commission (2015) Commission\n\n Implementing Decision, C(2015)6144 (not public).\n\n 200 Council (2015) Schengen evaluation of Austria - Council Recommendation on addressing the deficiencies\n\n identified in the 2015 evaluation of the application of the Schengen acquis in the field of Return, Council document\n\n 15435/15, Brussels, 17.12.2015; based on the European Commission (2015) Evaluation report of the Commission,\n\n\n\n C(2015) 6341 of 05.10.2015 (not public).\n\n 201 Council (2016) Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation \nNo\n\n 562/2006 (EC) as regards the reinforcement of checks against relevant databases at external borders, Council\n\n document 6390/16, Brussels, 24.02.2016.\n\n 202 For the Action plan dealing with the recommendations on external air borders, see: Austrian delegation (2015)\n\n Council document 6761/16, 03.03.2015; with regard to recommendations on return, see: Austrian delegation\n\n (2016), Action Plan of Austria of 16 March 2016, Council document 7258/16, 31 March 2016.

Sweden\n\n On 15 March 2016, the Council adopted 15 recommendations addressing the deficiencies\n\n identified in the 2015 evaluation of Sweden's application of the Schengen acquis in the field\n\n of management of the external borders.203 These recommendations included the preparation\n\n by Sweden of a concrete multi-annual action plan for the implementation of the national plan\n\n for integrated border management.\n\n Furthermore, it was recommended that Sweden take further measures in the field of human\n\n resources, training of officers performing border checks, the infrastructure at airports\n\n (including the optimising of the location of control booths to ensure the possibility of\n\n profiling), and border checks (including the improvement of the application of border checks\n\nhttp://www.statewatch.org/\n\n\n procedures). It was also recommended that Sweden provide border guards with risk analysis\n\n products concerning the fight against terrorism and instructions to regularly use the technical\n\n means available for detecting false/falsified documents when performing checks on all\n\n categories of persons).\n\n 5.1.1.4. Belgium\n\n In the 2015 evaluation on the implementation of the Schengen acquis by Belgium, the\n\n European Commission found deficiencies in the field of police cooperation, common visa\n\n policy, the SIS, and return. These recommendations were adopted in the period February -\n\n April 2016 by the Council.204\n\n 5.1.1.5. Poland\n\n In December 2015, the Council adopted recommendations dealing with the deficiencies in\n\n the implementation of the Schengen acquis in the field of the SIS in Poland based on the\n\n Schengen evaluation by the Commission in 2015.205\n\n With respect to the the deficiencies identified in the 2015 evaluation on the application of the\n\n Schengen acquis by Poland in the field of management of the external land border with\n\n Ukraine, the Commission drafted a (not publicly accessible) proposal for a Council\n\n recommendation in May 2016.206\n\n 5.1.2. Bi-annual reports on the functioning of the Schengen area\n\n Since 2012, the European Commission has submitted bi-annual reports to the European\n\n Parliament and the Council on the functioning of the Schengen area. In its seventh bi-annual\n\n report on the functioning of the Schengen area, covering the period between 1 November\n\n 2014 and 30 April 2015, the Commission addresses in particular the different measures taken\n\n 203 Council (2016), Council Implementing Decision setting out a Recommendation on addressing the deficiencies\n\n identified in the 2015 evaluation of Sweden's application of the Schengen acquis in the field of management of the\n\n external borders, Council Document 7124/16, Brussels, 15.03.2016.\n\n\n\n 204 In the following Council Implementing Decisions: of 27 February 2016 with regard to the deficiencies in the \nfield\n\n of the Schengen Information System, Council (2016), Council document 6200/16; of 8 March 2016 dealing with the\n\n deficiencies in police cooperation, Council (2016) Council document 6846/16; and two decisions of 5 April 2016,\n\n dealing with return and the common visa policy, respectively Council (2016), Council document 7533/16 and \nCouncil\n\n (2016), Council document 7536/16.\n\n 205 See Council (2015), Schengen evaluation of Poland - Council Recommendation on addressing the \ndeficiencies\n\n identified in the 2015 evaluation of the application of the Schengen acquis in the field of the Schengen Information\n\n System, Council document 15108/15, Brussels, 07.12.2015, based on the evaluation in European Commission\n\n (2015), COM (2015) 457 (not public).\n\n 206 Council document 9691/16, 31.05.2016 (not public).\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 63\n\n by the Member States in response to the increasing numbers of asylum seekers and irregular\n\n border crossings.207 The Commission addressed other alleged violations of the Schengen\n\n acquis, including alleged push-back practices at the external borders by Greece and Bulgaria,\n\n summary removals from Spain (Ceuta and Melilla), and excessive waiting times caused by\n\n checks by Spanish authorities in Gibraltar. The Commission asked Polish authorities to take\n\n necessary measures to amend the bilateral agreement with Ukraine to ensure that the shared\n\n border crossing points meet relevant safeguards included in the SEM.\n\n In the seventh bi-annual report, the Commission emphasises the added value of on-site visits\n\n under the new Schengen evaluation mechanism and the fact that all aspects of the Schengen\n\n\n\n acquis are evaluated over two months. The first two evaluations under this new regime took\n\n place in Austria (February-March 2015) and Belgium (April-May 2015). The new Schengen\n\n evaluation mechanism allows for unannounced visits: the first of which took place in Sweden\n\n early March 2015. In Poland a revisit took place on 25-27 March 2015, dealing with the\n\n evaluation of the use of SIS/Sirene.208 At the time of the publication of the seventh bi-annual\n\n report (May 2015), the reports of these visits were still to be finalised.\n\n In December 2015, the Commission published its eight bi-annual report.209 In this report,\n\n the Commission refers to the terrorist attacks in Paris of 13 November 2015, but also to the\n\n unprecedented number of migrants arriving in the Schengen area, taking into account\n\n different measures adopted by the MS at their internal borders in response to these\n\n developments. Addressing the temporary reintroduction of internal border controls by\n\n different MS in order to better manage secondary movements, the Commission finds that it\n\n must remain a temporary measure \u2018helping to bring the situation back to normal\u2019. Dealing\n\n with the Schengen evaluation mechanism, the Commission reports that two announced visits\n\n were carried out in the Netherlands and Germany, covering all the policy areas and that\n\n results of the earlier visits to Austria and Belgium have become available. During the\n\n reporting period, unannounced visits took place in Spain and Hungary addressing the\n\n management of external border controls.\n\n 5.1.3. Infringement procedures initiated by the Commission\n\n Only a few procedures have been initiated by the European Commission dealing with alleged\n\n infringements of the SBC in accordance with Article 258 TFEU:210\n\n \u2022 19 February 2009: reasoned opinion against France based on the Schengen Borders\n\n Code, procedure closed 26 January 2012 (2008/2024).\n\n\n\n \u2022 24 October 2012: formal notice against Austria for alleged infringement of Article 22\n\n of the Schengen Borders Code, procedure closed 28 March 2014 (2012/2121).\n\n \u2022 24 October 2012: formal notice against Slovakia for alleged infringement of Article 22\n\n the Schengen Borders Code, procedure closed 28 March 2014 (2012/2123).\n\n \u2022 16 October 2014, formal notice against Germany for non-compliance of the German\n\n \u2018Bundespolizei Gesetz\u2019 with Art 20 and 21(a) SBC, still pending (2014/4130).\n\n Furthermore, in its sixth report on the evaluation of Schengen, the Commission mentioned\n\n an infringement procedure dealing with Czech law obliging carriers to carry out systematic\n\n 207 European Commission (2015), Seventh bi-annual report on the functioning of the Schengen area 1 November\n\n 2014 - 30 April 2015, COM(2015)236, Brussels, 29.5.2015.\n\n 208 SIRENE stands for Supplementary Information Request at the National Entries.\n\n 209 European Commission (2015), Eighth biannual report on the functioning of the Schengen area 1 May - 10\n\n December 2015, COM(2015) 675, Strasbourg, 15.12.2015.\n\n 210 See European Commission, DG HOME website (2016), \u201cBrowse infringements of EU Home Affairs law\u201d, EU \nlaw\n\n monitoring.

The procedure was closed in 2014. According\n\n to the Commission, the Czech Republic had modified its legislation to make it compatible with\n\n EU law.211\n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-is-new/eu-law-andmonitoring/\n\n\n Thus, based on this information, only the procedure against Germany is still pending. In\n\n 2014, members of the German parliament (Bundestag) submitted questions on this\n\n procedure, asking for information about the specific criticisms of the Commission with regard\n\n to non-compliance with the SBC and the conclusions the Federal German government drew\n\n from this procedure.212 The Federal Government replied that the European Commission raised\n\n legal concerns regarding Section 23 paragraph 1 number 3 of the Federal Police Act (BPolG),\n\n asking Germany to specify restrictions with respect to the intensity and frequency of checks.\n\n According to the German government the national legislation is compatible with the SBC and\n\n was to be discussed with the Commission at the beginning of 2015, after which the Federal\n\n Government would give its opinion. In 2015, the Federal government, despite repeated\n\n enquiries by members of the German parliament, refused to submit the letter of formal notice\n\n of the Commission in this infringement procedure.213 The Federal government based this\n\n refusal on a German act on the cooperation between government and parliament on EU\n\n matters, obliging it to submit information on infringement procedures dealing with directives,\n\n but not regulations. Due to this lack of specific information, it is unclear whether the\n\n infringement procedure initiated by the Commission deals with the same issues as submitted\n\n by the court of Kehl (Amtsgericht) in the preliminary questions to the CJEU of January 2016\n\n (see above). Nevertheless, it seems that the Commission is not planning to go further on this\n\n question.214\n\n The interviews carried out during this study revealed that there is a lack of knowledge about\n\n the infringement procedures due to issues of information handling, in particular in the\n\n provision of information to the national and the European Parliaments (see Sub-section 3.2.\n\n for more information).\n\n 5.2. Role of EU agencies in the evaluation of external borders management and\n\n capacities\n\n\n\n This sub-section provides an assessment of the role given to EU agencies such as Frontex,\n\n EASO and the FRA in the Schengen monitoring and evaluation system.\n\n 5.2.1. Role of Frontex\n\n 5.2.1.1. Frontex risk analysis\n\n The tasks of Frontex (the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation\n\n at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union) are regulated in Council\n\n Regulation 2007/2004, amended by Regulation 1168/2011.215 Article 2 of the Frontex\n\n Regulation provides for an assisting and coordinating role for Frontex, for example, in\n\n providing assistance to Member States in training their border guards and in the\n\n establishment of common training standards.\n\n 211 European Commission (2014), Sixth bi-annual report on the functioning of the Schengen area 1 May - 31 \nOctober\n\n 2014, COM(2014)711, Brussels, 27.11.2014, p. 5.\n\n 212 Bundestag Drucksache 18/3464, 22 December 2014.\n\n 213 Bundestag Drucksache 18/4149, 27 February 2015, p. 2.\n\n 214 Interview with German Permanent Representation, 27.05.2016.\n\n 215 European Communities (2004), Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 of 26 October 2004 establishing a\n\n European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States \nof\n\n the European Union, OJ L 349, Brussels, 25.11.2004, amended by the European Union (2011), Regulation\n\n 1168/2011, OJ L 304, Brussels, 22.11.2011.\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 65\n\n\n\n Frontex plays a role in carrying out risk analyses, including the assessment of the capacity\n\n of Member States to face threats and pressure at external borders, and the conducting of\n\n research relevant for the control and surveillance of external borders. For the purposes of its\n\n risk analyses, the Agency may assess, on the basis of Article 4 of the Frontex Regulation,\n\n after prior consultation with the Member States concerned, \u2018their capacity to face upcoming\n\n challenges, including present and future threats and pressures at the external borders of the\n\n Member States\u2019. This is expected to be of particular relevance for those Member States facing\n\n specific and disproportionate pressures. To that end, Frontex may assess the border control\n\n equipment and resources of the Member States. The assessment shall be based on\n\n information given by the Member States concerned, and on the reports and results of joint\n\n operations, pilot projects, rapid interventions and other activities of the Agency. Article 4\n\n explicitly mentions that these assessments by Frontex are without prejudice to the SEM.\n\n However, as indicated in Section 3.2, the risk analyses prepared by Frontex are used for the\n\n preparation of the visits to Member States for the five-yearly evaluations on the basis of\n\n Article 43 of the SBC. Furthermore, Article 7 of SEM requires Frontex to carry out yearly risk\n\n analyses for all Member States as a basis for the preparation of the annual evaluation\n\n programme for announced and unannounced on-site visits by expert teams. Article 7(2)\n\n includes the sentence: \u201cThe Commission may at any time request Frontex to submit to it a\n\n risk analysis making recommendations for evaluations to be implemented in the form of\n\n unannounced on-site visits.\u201d Thus, it seems that the Commission has more leverage in terms\n\n of timing to arrange unannounced visits without waiting for the annual Risk Analysis.\n\n Although not (directly) related to its tasks in evaluation, it is worth noting that, with the 2011\n\n amendment, Frontex has been granted more operational tasks, including the coordination or\n\n organisation of joint return operations, the setting up of European Border Guard Teams to\n\n\n\n be deployed during joint operations, pilot projects and rapid interventions, and the\n\n development and operation of information systems enabling \u2018swift and reliable exchanges of\n\n information regarding emerging risks at the external borders\u2019.216\n\n During the interviews conducted for the purposes of this study, the overall views on Frontex\n\n risk analyses were positive.217 The respondents mentioned coherent and thorough analysis\n\n as a strength. However, there were a number of concerns raised. One of the issues is timing,\n\n as Frontex is obliged to prepare the risk analyses by August 31 of the next year, which means\n\n that the risk analysis for 2016 is prepared on the data gathered by August 2015. Such a long\n\n time lapse means that the information might not be relevant any more. Some respondents\n\n raised concerns on whether such analysis should be public, as it loses the depth and details.\n\n Some wanted to see more concrete indicators being used on what is actually happening at\n\n the borders, whereas others called for a greater focus on more predictive intelligence, rather\n\n than risk assessment.\n\n 5.2.1.2. Proposal for the European Border and Coast Guard: \u2018vulnerability assessment\u2019\n\n In the so-called \u2018Borders Package\u2019, presented on 15 December 2015, the Commission\n\n launched the proposal for the establishment of a European Border and Coast Guard\n\n (EBCG).218 The establishment of the EBCG would mean that the current Frontex would obtain\n\n 216 See Article 8a on rapid interventions and Article 11c on the processing of personal data of the European\n\n Communities (2007), Regulation (EC) No 863/2007.\n\n 217 Interviews with German Permanent Representation, 27.05.2016; Slovenian Permanent Representation,\n\n 30.05.2016; Council secretariat, 19.05.2016.\n\n 218 European Commission (2015), Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the\n\n\n\n European Border and Coast Guard and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004, Regulation (EC) No 863/2007 \nand\n\n Council Decision 2005/267/EC, COM(2015) 671 final, Strasbourg, 15.12.2015.\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 66\n\n extended powers.219 Whereas Frontex currently only has a coordinating role, supporting\n\n Member States in controlling their external borders, the EBCG is due to gain more resources\n\n and executive powers. The final text on the EBCG was agreed between the EP and the Council\n\n in late June 2016.220 In operational terms, the new EBCG will have a rapid intervention pool\n\n of 1,500 officers. Various officers, ranging from police to border guards, would be deployed\n\n from a reserve of the EBCG, depending on the type of emergency. In addition, the EBCG\n\n would have its own technical pool for a more efficient response to manage a given situation.\n\n In addition, the EBCG proposal aims to improve the coordination of information exchange\n\n and operational cooperation between border authorities and other \u2018authorities with coast\n\n guard functions\u2019. To this end, it is expected that EBCG will gain access to the SIS II database\n\n and will take a more active role on returns. As was discussed earlier in this study, this\n\n indicates the blurring lines between functions of border guards and policing (see Sub-Section\n\n 4.8.1.).\n\n The EBCG text also strengthens the monitoring and supervisory competences of the new\n\n Agency in Article 7.1.b of the Regulation. The Commission proposes to strengthen the new\n\n Agency's role by adding a \u2018common vulnerability assessment methodology\u2019 in Article 12(1),\n\n which aims at identifying operational weakenesses and assess \u201cthe capacity and readiness\u201d\n\n of EU Members States to control the common EU external borders. It is envisaged that the\n\n\n\n vulnerability assessment would be based on \u201cobjective criteria\u201d. Article 12(2)states that \u201cthe\n\n Agency shall monitor and assess at least once a year unless the Executive Director, based\n\n on risk assessments or a previous vulnerability assessment, decides otherwise, the\n\n availability of the technical equipment, systems, capabilities, resources, infrastructure,\n\n adequately skilled and trained staff of Member States necessary for border control. .\u201d221 In\n\n Article 12 (3) it is stressed that particular attention will be paid to the capacity \u201cto carry out\n\n all border management tasks including the capacity to deal with the potential arrival of large\n\n numbers of persons shall be taken into account.\u201d\n\n The information necessary for carrying out this vulnerability assessment would be submitted\n\n by liaison officers posted in specific Member States, monitoring external border management\n\n in that state.222 The results of the vulnerability assessment will be sent to the concerned\n\n Member State, which will have the chance to provide comments.

Recital 17 states that224:\n\n \u201cIn cases where a Member State does not take the necessary measures in line with the\n\n vulnerability assessment or in the event of disproportionate pressure at the external borders\n\n\n\n where a Member State has not requested the Agency for sufficient support or is not taking\n\n the necessary actions for the implementation of these measures, rendering the control at the\n\n external border ineffective to an extent which risks putting in jeopardy the functioning of the\n\n Schengen area, a unified, rapid and effective response should be delivered at Union level.\n\n For the purpose of mitigating these risks, and to ensure better coordination at Union level,\n\n the Commission should identify and propose to the Council the measures to be implemented\n\n by the Agency and require the Member State concerned to cooperate with the Agency in the\n\n implementation of those measures. The implementing power to adopt such a decision should\n\n be conferred on the Council because of the potential politically-sensitive nature of the\n\n measures to be decided, often touching on national executive and enforcement powers. The\n\n European Border and Coast Guard Agency should then determine the actions to be taken for\n\n the practical execution of the measures indicated in the Council decision, and an operational\n\n plan should be drawn up with the Member State concerned. In case where a Member State\n\n does not comply within 30 days with this Council decision and does not cooperate with the\n\n Agency in the implementation of the measures contained in this decision, the Commission\n\n may trigger the application of the specific procedure where exceptional circumstances put\n\n the overall functioning of the area without internal border control at risk provided for in Article\n\n 29 of Regulation (EU) 2016/399.\u201d\n\n Thus, the relationship between the EBCG vulnerability assessment and the SEM and the\n\n consequences of non-compliance are not yet clear in practice.225 According to the\n\n Commission, while the Schengen evaluation mechanism is meant to maintain mutual trust\n\n among the Member States, the vulnerability assessment would be more focused on\n\n prevention, so as to avoid \u201ccrisis situations\u201d.226 It is expected that the vulnerability\n\n assessment, in comparison with the SEM, would provide ongoing monitoring and would allow\n\n\n\n the new agency to respond more quickly. Nevertheless, the newly agreed text provides that\n\n \u2018vulnerability assessment\u2019 could trigger Article 29 SBC as a separate track. Indeed, while the\n\n Regulation states that this will be without prejudice to the SEM, the new procedure entails\n\n an amendment of Regulation (EU) 2016/399. The new article 78a (in conjunction with article\n\n 18) amends article 29 of the SBC (as follows) 227:\n\n \" Article 78a\n\n 1.

If a situation requiring urgent action arises, the European Parliament shall be\n\n informed of that situation without delay and shall be informed of all subsequent\n\n measures and decisions taken in response.\u201d\n\n A regular monitoring of compliance with EU standards by EU Member States holding the\n\n common EU external border is a welcome step forward in this initiative. It is, however,\n\n unclear how the vulnerability assessment procedure will address the challenges identified in\n\n this study with regard to the SEM in light of the recent experience in Greece and the use of\n\n Article 29 SBC. Envisaging a formal role in the assessment for the EBCG in trigerring Article\n\n 29 SBC will mean that the process is no longer exclusively in the hands of the European\n\n Commission. It is not to be forgotten that, according to Article 62 of the proposal, the\n\n Management Board of the new Agency will be composed of \u201cone representative of each\n\n Member State and two representatives of the Commission, all with voting rights.\u201d This can\n\n be expected to grant EU Member States a high degree of influence over the decisions taken\n\n by the Executive Director. However, the European Commission will still remain in the main\n\n driving seat in the running of the SEM and in activating Article 29 SBC. That notwithstanding,\n\n the involvement of the EBCG will certainly lead to a higher degree of \u2018politicisation\u2019\n\n surrounding the operability of the Article 29 SBC procedure. Moreover, unlike the SEM, the\n\n\n\n EBCG vulnerability assessment will not cover the monitoring of internal border checks. It is,\n\n therefore, necessary to better operationalise, and ensure the effectiveness of, the SEM\n\n irrespective of the new vulnerability assessment.\n\n 228 European Union (2016), Regulation (EU) 2016/&hellip; of the European Parliament and of the Council of \n&hellip; on the\n\n European Border [and Coast] Guard and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004, Regulation (EC) No 863/2007\n\n and Council Decision 2005/267/EC, and amending Regulation (EU) 2016/399 of the European Parliament and of\n\n the Council (not yet published in the OJ, agreed in LIBE committee on 27.06.2016).\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 69\n\n In addition, a question can be raised as regards the kind of checks and balances that will be\n\n in place to scrutinise the \u2018objectivity\u2019, impartiality and evidence-based nature of the\n\n assessement to be conducted by the new EBCG. So far, Article 1a provides that the EP should\n\n remain informed. As previously identifieid in this study, there are, however, fundamental\n\n obstacles and practical barriers in the current procedures, which prevent effective and\n\n meaningful access to documents and transparency by the European Parliament. Article 70.5\n\n states that \u201cthe Consultative Forum shall have effective access to all information concerning\n\n the respect for fundamental rights, including by carrying out on spot visits to joint operations,\n\n or rapid border interventions subject to the agreement of the host Member State, hotspot\n\n areas, return operations and return interventions.\u201d It is therefore essential that this Article\n\n be fully implemented and that the Consultative Forum annual reports include fundamental\n\n rights considerations/challenges in Member States\u2019 implementation practices in the context\n\n of Article 18 of the Regulation. Furthermore, the objectivity of the vulnerability assessment\n\n\n\n would be further ensured if the European Parliament called upon the new Fundamental Rights\n\n Officer to report back key issues in relation to the annual vulnerability assessment drawn up\n\n by the Agency. This would be in line with the new Article 71.2, which states that: \u201cThe\n\n Fundamental Rights Officer shall report on a regular basis and as such contribute to the\n\n mechanism for monitoring fundamental rights.\u201d\n\n 5.2.2. The European Asylum Support Office: evaluation of the CEAS and needs of\n\n Member States \u2018subject to particular pressure\u2019\n\n For the moment EASO does not play an observer role in the SEM on-site missions. Since,\n\n anecdotally, one of the main issues that MS faced during the refugee crisis was a lack of\n\n capacity and preparedness to receive asylum seekers, to register them in the EURODAC and\n\n to assess their asylum claims in a timely fashion and in line with CEAS and EUFRC, the\n\n absence of EASO seems strange. According to Article 10(5) of Regulation 1053/2013, the\n\n Commission may invite Frontex, Europol or other Union bodies, offices or agencies involved\n\n in the implementation of the Schengen acquis to designate a representative to take part as\n\n an observer in an on-site visit concerning an area covered by their mandate. This provides a\n\n basis for an EASO observer in on-site visits in addition to the information that EASO may\n\n provide during the preparation of questionnaires and on-site visits.\n\n Nevertheless, EASO draws up its own reports on the functioning of the CEAS. According to\n\n Article 12 of the EASO Regulation 439/2010, EASO shall draw up an annual report on the\n\n situation of asylum in the Union, on the basis of information \u2018already available from other\n\n relevant sources\u2019. As part of that report, the EASO shall evaluate the results of activities\n\n carried out under this Regulation and make a comprehensive comparative analysis of them\n\n with the aim of improving the quality, consistency and effectiveness of the CEAS.229\n\n Furthermore, to be able to assess the needs of Member States \u2018subject to particular pressure\u2019,\n\n Article 9 of the EASO Regulation states that this Agency will gather, on the basis of\n\n\n\n information provided by Member States, the UNHCR and, where appropriate, other relevant\n\n organisations, relevant information for the identification, preparation and formulation of\n\n emergency measures referred to in Article 10 to cope with such pressure.\n\n The task of EASO to gather information includes the systematic identification, collection and\n\n analysis of \u2018information relating to the structures and staff available, especially for translation\n\n and interpretation, information on countries of origin and on assistance in the handling and\n\n management of asylum cases and the asylum capacity in those Member States subject to\n\n 229 European Union (2010), Regulation (EU) No 439/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 \nMay\n\n 2010 establishing a European Asylum Support Office, OJ L 132, Brussels, 29.5.2010.\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 70\n\n particular pressure, with a view to fostering quick and reliable mutual information to the\n\n various Member States' asylum authorities\u2019 (Article 9(2)).\n\n 5.2.3. Fundamental Rights Agency: ensuring fundamental rights compliance\n\n Fundamental rights are an integral part of the Schengen aquis. Thus, FRA plays an important\n\n role in supporting Schengen evaluators with fundamental rights expertise. FRA\u2019s work has\n\n focused mainly on the following areas of the Schengen acquis: border management, return,\n\n visa policy, police cooperation and SIS II.\n\n It should also be noted that Recital 14 of the SBC stresses the importance of fundamental\n\n rights, stating that fundamental rights violations shall give rise to the intervention of the\n\n European Parliament (see Sub-section 3.2.).\n\n\n\n FRA is involved in Schengen evaluation at three levels:\n\n \u2022 Providing risk analysis;\n\n \u2022 Training evaluators;\n\n \u2022 Participation in the on-site mission;\n\n 5.2.3.1. FRA risk analysis\n\n Under Article 8 of the SEM, the Commission may request relevant EU agencies to submit a\n\n risk analysis. Pursuant to this provision, the Commission requests yearly a risk analysis to\n\n FRA. FRA has to present its analysis to the Standing Committee on the evaluation and\n\n implementation of Schengen (Schengen evaluation committee). After the evaluation cycle is\n\n finished, the Commission makes such a report public. For example, in 2014, the FRA\n\n published its risk analysis.230 In its analysis, FRA provides an overview of the relevant\n\n fundamental rights issues in the EU Member States subject to regular evaluations. Due to\n\n mandate limitations, FRA does not cover Schengen Associated Countries in its analysis. The\n\n focus of the analysis is border management and return/re-admission, although other policy\n\n areas can also be covered. The risk analysis is based on:\n\n \u2022 Information and data gathered from the FRA research;\n\n \u2022 Publicly available official information from the UN, Council of Europe, national\n\n human rights institutions (e.g. ombudspersons), national authorities and civil society\n\n organisations (press reports are only exceptionally used, primarly for very recent\n\n events not yet covered elsewhere).\n\n The FRA risk analysis complements fundamental rights-related questions in the standard\n\n Schengen evaluation questionnaire.231 FRA follows its own institutional guidelines that cover\n\n methodological and procedural steps to prepare the risk analysis. The FRA methodology\n\n ensures that information provided is solid and cross-checked.\n\n\n\n 230 European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (2014), 2014 Schengen evaluations: Risk analysis submitted \nby\n\n FRA under Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No. 1053/2013, Annex to MIGRAPOL CC Return Dir 54, Vienna, \n09.08.2014.\n\n URL :           \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetailDoc&id=16015&no=4.\n\n 231 European Commission (2014), ANNEX 1 to the Commission Implementing Desicion establishing a standard\n\n questionnaire in accordance with Article 9 of the Council Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013 of 7 October 2013\n\n establishing an evaluation and monitoring mechanism to verify the application of the Schengen acquis, C(2014)\n\n 4657 final, Brussels, 11.7.2014.

Training of future evaluators\n\n FRA is involved in the training of future evaluators, who will participate to announced or\n\n unannounced on-site missions. Training of Schengen evaluators is organised by Frontex\n\n (covering border management and return) or by CEPOL (covering police cooperation, SIS\n\n and visa policies). FRA contributes to such training sessions.\n\n Evaluators usually come from national governments or agencies. The training covers those\n\n fundamental rights issues that could be at stake when evaluating a particular area of the\n\n Schengen acquis. There is no mechanism ensuring that the people who have received the\n\n training are actually deployed232, though the FRA respondent confirmed that many of them\n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetailDoc&id=16015&no=4\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/elibrary/\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/elibrary/\n\n\n do indeed get deployed.233\n\n 5.2.3.3. Participation in the on-site missions\n\n On the basis of Article 10(5) of the SEM, FRA is invited by the Commission to participate in\n\n the on-site missions as an observer. The agency is invited to the evaluation missions in the\n\n fields of return and readmission, but not on borders issues. FRA representatives cover\n\n relevant questions on returns and readmissions, safegards concerning protection from\n\n unlawful or arbitrary detention, forced return monitorin, etc. During the mission, FRA officials\n\n act as advisors/experts on fundamental rights-related issues. The missions are led by DG\n\n HOME in the Commission, which distributes the relevant information among the experts.\n\n 5.2.3.4. Questionnaires\n\n The Schengen evaluation mainly relies on the information produced by the MS, as is\n\n enshrined in SEM (Regulation 1053/2013). MS complete a questionnaire with a set of\n\n fundamental rights-related questions, such as on the return aquis, detention conditions,\n\n detention of children, external borders, the respect of non-refoulement principle, and access\n\n to international protection. The questionnaire also includes the issue of how freedom of\n\n movement is respected when exercising border controls. Only questions 34 and 35 of the\n\n questionnaire234 relate to internal controls \u2013 i.e. whether or not police checks are tantamount\n\n to border checks. The questionnaires are not used for the FRA risk analysis, as they come in\n\n later than the FRA assessment.\n\n 232 Interview with the Commission, DG Home, 17.05.2016.\n\n 233 Interview with the FRA, 04.05.2016.\n\n 234 European Commission (2014), SEM Questionnaire, Op.cit.\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 72\n\n 6. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n This study has examined the Schengen governance system in the wake of the recent events\n\n of 2015 and early 2016, often referred to as the European refugee crisis. The analysis\n\n concludes that no legislative reform is necessary in light of these developments. While the\n\n Commission has referred to the need to get \u2018back to Schengen\u2019 before the end of 2016, the\n\n developments since the summer of 2015 show that we have never left it. The Schengen\n\n governance system adopted in 2013 is \u2018fit for purpose\u2019 and Schengen is here to stay. The\n\n few EU Member States that have reintroduced internal border checks have done so (at least\n\n formally) in compliance with the Schengen rules. Notwithstanding that, as this study shows,\n\n the grounds or justifications given by these States to continue with the reintroduction of\n\n internal border controls are not sufficient. The controls are disproportionate and beyond what\n\n is necessary in light of the predominantly asylum-based nature of the European refugee crisis\n\n and the lack of solidarity shown.\n\n The latest developments do not therefore justify any new legislative reform of the Schengen\n\n system and its governance framework. The Schengen system was reformed in 2013 and the\n\n new system has been only implemented in practice since 2015. It would therefore be\n\n premature to bring in a new legislative reform package. It is, however, imperative that each\n\n EU institutional actor play its role more effectively in the evaluation of EU Member States\u2019\n\n compliance with the Schengen Borders Code (SBC) and the lawfulness of internal border\n\n checks. The European Commission cannot be a mediator among EU Member States - this is\n\n a role for the Council to play. The Commission must rather act as guarantor of the Treaties,\n\n and thoroughly and objectively evaluate Member States\u2019 compliance with Schengen principles\n\n\n\n and rules. The European Parliament needs to be better equipped to ensure that the\n\n Commission is duly carrying out its role in evaluating Member States\u2019 compliance with the\n\n rules, and to perform a greater democratic scrutiny over EU Member States\u2019 compliance, in\n\n particular when their actions affect the fundamental rights of individuals.\n\n The analysis shows that the Member States\u2019 justifications for the reintroduction of intra-\n\n Schengen state borders controls under Articles 26\u201329 since 13 September 2015 have been\n\n woefully inadequate. They lack substantiation and detail and fail to substantively fulfil the\n\n requirements of the SBC. Justifications made by Member States for the reintroduction of\n\n intra-Schengen Border controls should be fully and properly communicated to the public and\n\n explained on the basis of the criteria set out in the SBC; rote repetition of the wording of the\n\n Articles in the SBC should not be considered sufficient. The proportionality assessment for\n\n the reintroduction of intra-Schengen border controls that any Member State seeking to use\n\n these provisions must undertake needs to be thorough and complete in light of the\n\n fundamental nature of the right to the intra-Schengen free movement of persons without\n\n border checks as a part of the internal market.\n\n Moreover, continuing internal border checks on the basis of fears of future/potential\n\n secondary movements of asylum seekers, or the instability of the EU-Turkey Statement,\n\n cannot be accepted. This justification is not based on independent and thorough evidence\n\n and is therefore disproportionate and could jeopardise the sustainability of the entire\n\n Schengen machinery. The fact that the European Commission is now in the driving seat of\n\n Schengen evaluations constitutes a positive step forward in comparison to the previous intergovernmental\n\n (peer-to-peer) evaluation system. Still, recent developments have showed the\n\n\n\n need for the Commission to act more firmly in enforcing EU standards and to be better\n\n equipped. It must ensure that Member States\u2019 actions are evidence- and needs- based, and\n\n are not just driven by irrational, fear-based national political games. The intersection of the\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 73\n\n arrival of refugees in larger numbers than anticipated and the perception of unreasonable\n\n pressure on the intra-Schengen borders has been evident. The most substantial issue is the\n\n reaction to refugee arrivals, not via the Common European Asylum System (CEAS), but by\n\n the reintroduction of internal borders. These may be used to regulate the movement of third\n\n country nationals, but should not be applied to refugees.\n\n Where Member States invoke \u2018secondary movements\u2019 of asylum seekers within the Schengen\n\n area as a reason for the reintroduction of intra-Schengen border controls, very serious and\n\n compelling reasons should be provided with supporting documentation that shows the\n\n genuine existence of a threat. The free movement of persons without impediment by border\n\n controls is one of the main objectives of the internal market and a core benefit of it. Moreover,\n\n re-instating border checks can do little to ensure the requisite reception conditions for asylum\n\n seekers and refugees. Where Member States invoke the threat of terrorism as a reason for\n\n the reintroduction of intra-Schengen border controls, sufficient detail as to the nature of the\n\n threat, and how precisely internal border controls would address it, must be provided to the\n\n EU institutions so that they can ensure that the proportionality assessment is correctly carried\n\n out.\n\n\n\n All the EU Member States that continue to apply internal border checks have failed to pass\n\n the necessity and proportionality test required by the EU Schengen governance framework.\n\n The Commission proposal and subsequent Council Decision of 12 May, setting out a\n\n Recommendation for temporary internal border controls in exceptional circumstances that\n\n put the overall functioning of the Schengen area at risk, was based on evaluations conducted\n\n back in November 2015. These focused solely on Greece\u2019s capacity to deliver on SBC\n\n standards. However, the situation both in Greece and the five EU Member States that have\n\n been allowed to continue with border controls has profoundly changed during the last six\n\n months and the Schengen evaluation procedure does not always ensure an up-to-date\n\n account of the situation on the ground. Moreover, those Schengen evaluations did not focus\n\n on compliance and delivery of CEAS asylum standards by Greece, nor by the other EU\n\n Member States re-instating internal border checks. It is regrettable that the Commission has\n\n accepted the non-evidence-based justifications from the five Member States and has focused\n\n its assessment purely on border control standards in Greece. However, the Study shows that\n\n the Council Decision of 12 May 2016 set very specific conditions, geographical locations and\n\n a specific timeframe (as well as obligations to report back to the Commission) for these five\n\n Member States conducting internal border checks. The Council Decision also clearly shows\n\n that this is a rather small group of concerned states, who are clearly a minority in the wider\n\n EU Schengen membership picture.\n\n People moving across Schengen borders in search of international protection must not be\n\n classified as \u2018irregular migrants\u2019. People in need of international protection should never be\n\n referred to as \u2018illegal\u2019. The Member States and the EU institutions must recognise that they\n\n are asylum seekers and refugees in accordance with the United Nations High Commissioner\n\n\n\n for Refugees (UNHCR) definition of a refugee and effectively apply EU asylum law and the EU\n\n Charter of Fundamental Rights. The EU institutions and Member States must respect their\n\n duty under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention (Article 31) not to commence criminal\n\n prosecutions or apply other penalties to refugees for their irregular entry onto their territory,\n\n including entry as a result of intra-Schengen movement. The classification of asylum seekers\n\n as irregular immigrants to justify borders controls or police checks in border areas is\n\n problematic for three reasons. First, it allows the extended use of internal border checks,\n\n contrary to the purposes of the SBC. Second, based on this classification, asylum seekers\n\n crossing internal borders can be detained on the basis of regular migration rules, disregarding\n\n applicable EU laws on the reception of asylum seekers. And third, it displaces the focus of\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 74\n\n attention from a challenge that is predominantly one of asylum, to one of border containment\n\n and control as \u2018the solution\u2019.\n\n According to Article 23 of the SBC, the exercise of police powers and checks at the internal\n\n borders may not have the objective (or be equivalent to) border controls and must be based\n\n on general police information and experience \u2018regarding possible threats to public security\n\n and aim, in particular, to combat cross-border crime\u2019. Furthermore, they must be devised\n\n and executed in a manner clearly distinct from systematic checks on persons at the external\n\n borders (and rather be carried out on the basis of \u2018spot checks\u2019). Several Member States use\n\n police checks in border areas for migration control purposes, making a direct connection\n\n\n\n between irregular immigration and possible threats to public security. These police practices\n\n fall within the scope of the SBC and are therefore subject to European scrutiny. They are\n\n contrary to the purpose of Article 23 and recital 26 of the SBC stating that \u201cmigration and\n\n the crossing of external borders by a large number of third-country nationals should not, per\n\n se, be considered to be a threat to public policy or internal security\u201d. National practices of\n\n mobile police checks at the internal borders illustrate that the line between \u2018border controls\u2019\n\n and \u2018border checks\u2019, prohibited in 22 SBC on the one hand, and police checks allowed in\n\n Article 23 SBC, remains unclear. While the 2013 Schengen governance reform allowed the\n\n European Commission to conduct on-site evaluations of internal police checks practices, the\n\n effectiveness of this scrutiny is largely undermined by a high degree of legal uncertainty and\n\n the lack of transparency of Member State law enforcement authorities\u2019 actions when checking\n\n people on the move. On the basis of the above, we put forward the following\n\n recommendations:\n\n Recommendations\n\n First, the 2013 Schengen Governance Package is fit for purpose and recent developments\n\n do not justify new legislative amendments or reforms to the Schengen Borders Code. The\n\n new rules have only recently been put into effect and there should be at least a five-year\n\n settling-in period before more amendments are considered. Instead, the Commission should\n\n take a much more robust and evidence-based approach to the legal assessment of Member\n\n States\u2019 notifications for the reintroduction of intra-Schengen border controls and subject\n\n them to a comprehensive proportionality test. The test should centre on the impact of the\n\n abolition of intra-Schengen state border controls on the movement of persons and the\n\n internal market.\n\n\n\n Second, the Commission should prepare, in consultation with the UNHCR, guidelines for the\n\n Member States on the correct application of Article 31 of the Refugee Convention in the EU\n\n area without internal border controls. Where there is evidence that Member States are\n\n starting criminal proceedings against refugees for irregular entry onto their territory, either\n\n from outside the Schengen area or within it, it should commence infringement proceedings\n\n for failure to correctly apply the CEAS. The EU should equip itself with an \u2018asylum evaluation\n\n mechanism\u2019 similar to the one in Schengen based on Article 70 of the TFEU.\n\n Third, the results of Schengen evaluations of external and internal borders should meet a\n\n higher degree of public scrutiny and transparency. There should be a clear obligation to\n\n communicate publicly about developments such as those of the last 10 months, including the\n\n kind of measures adopted by some EU Member States and the exact scope of internal border\n\n checks and their justifications. The European Parliament\u2019s role should be better implemented\n\n and fine-tuned.\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 75\n\n The European Parliament should be better equipped to require the Commission to fulfil its\n\n obligations under the Treaties and be a real guardian of the treaties, not a facilitator of the\n\n whims of the Member States. Specific procedures should be developed as regards the ways\n\n in which the Commission classifies and sends information resulting from these evaluations to\n\n the European Parliament.\n\n The European Parliament and national parliaments should be more accurately informed on of\n\n the state of play with respect to infringement procedures initiated by the Commission against\n\n\n\n Member States based on alleged violations of the SBC. This information should include the\n\n content of the letter of formal notice and reasoned opinion of the Commission and the\n\n subsequent answers of the Member States.\n\n Fourth, Member States that extend the use of police checks at the internal borders within\n\n the meaning of Article 23 SBC (former Article 21) should be obliged to inform the Commission\n\n and other Member States more thoroughly. Article 23 SBC (former Article 21) must be\n\n amended accordingly. The Commission should prepare guidelines on the use of police checks\n\n in border areas that can be allowed within the scope of Article 23(a) SBC (former 21(a)).\n\n There are currently no effective ways to assess and monitor checks by national police\n\n authorities that basically amount to border controls. Any future revision of the SIS II should\n\n include an obligation for national police and other law enforcement authorities to report the\n\n reason, scope and location of checks when using the SIS II. The over-use of SIS II by national\n\n authorities could be an indicator that domestic practices are jeopardising the SBC and the\n\n spirit of Schengen.\n\n Fifth, the current practical application of the Article 29 mechanism could be improved. Its\n\n current operability undermines the EU principles of solidarity between Member States and\n\n adherence to the Schengen acquis, by only punishing Member States who are unable or\n\n unwilling to cope with large numbers of asylum seekers and allowing others to close their\n\n internal borders without due foundation. It should instead ensure that the latter assist the\n\n border Member States in dealing with and receiving asylum seekers and migrants. The\n\n relationship between the risk analysis of Frontex, the proposed \u2018vulnerability assessment\u2019 of\n\n the European Border and Coast Guard, and the existing Schengen evaluation mechanism (as\n\n well as the consequences of non-compliance) should be clarified in the applicable EU law.\n\n\n\n Frontex (or the future European Border and Coast Guard) should not be able to trigger or\n\n justify the use of Article 29 SBC on its own.\n\n Sixth, a key weakness in the current Schengen evaluation and monitoring mechanism, and\n\n the evaluations performed by the Commission, is that they lack on-the-ground and objective\n\n knowledge of the actual challenges faced in the practical delivery of EU Schengen and asylum\n\n standards by relevant EU Member States. The role of civil society organisations should be\n\n explored and better utilised so as to ensure a more independent and substantiated\n\n assessment of Member States\u2019 actions on the ground. The European Parliament should\n\n support the setting up of a \u2018Shadow Evaluation Mechanism\u2019, focused on Member States\u2019\n\n compliance with Schengen and CEAS rules. This should be further elaborated on by civil\n\n society organisations, in close cooperation with the European Union Agency for Fundamental\n\n Rights (FRA). This mechanism would ensure an independent and on-the-ground assessment\n\n of the effective implementation of Schengen and asylum rules at domestic levels.\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 76\n\n REFERENCES\n\n \u2022 Austrian delegation (2015), Schengen evaluation of AUSTRIA - Action Plan to remedy any\n\n deficiencies identified in the 2015 evaluation report in the field of air borders, Council\n\n document, 6761/16, Brussels, 03.03.2016.\n\n \u2022 Austrian delegation (2016) Prolongation of the temporary reintroduction of border controls\n\n at the Austrian internal borders in accordance with Article 29(2) of [&hellip;] the SBC, Brussels,\n\n Council Document 8947/16, 13.05.2016.\n\n \u2022 Austrian delegation (2016), Schengen evaluation of AUSTRIA - Action Plan to remedy any\n\n\n\n deficiencies identified in the 2015 evaluation report in the field of Return, Council Document\n\n 7258/16, Brussels, 31.03.2016.\n\n \u2022 Basilien-Gainche, M.L.

SUMMARIES OF CJEU CASE LAW ON THE\n\n SCHENGEN BORDERS CODE\n\n Up to May 2016 nine cases with respect to the rules on borders in the Schengen Borders\n\n Code (SBC) have reached the Court of Justice of the EU. The Court has handed down six\n\n judgments, four concerning rules on external borders and two with respect to rules on\n\n internal borders. Two more cases are pending before the Court: one on grounds for refusal\n\nhttp://www.visegradgroup.eu/calendar/2015/joint-statement-of-the-\n\n\n at the external borders and one on police controls behind internal borders. One reference on\n\n controls behind internal borders was withdrawn after the judgment of the Court in a similar\n\n case. We will first discuss the judgments with respect to rules on external border and then\n\n those on internal borders. Finally, two other judgments of the Court with general observations\n\n on the Schengen Borders Code are mentioned in points 10 and 11 below.\n\n All judgments relate to the 2006 version of the Code. For the sake of clarity and uniformity,\n\n we use hereunder the new numbers of the corresponding Articles in the re-codified version\n\n of the SBC (Regulation 2016/399).\n\n So far no cases with respect to Regulation 1053/2013 have reached the Court.\n\n CJEU case law on external borders\n\n 1. In its first judgment on the Schengen Borders Code in Carcia & Cabrera, the Court, in reply\n\n to a question referred by a Spanish court in two cases, held that Article 12 SBC does not\n\n imply that a Member State is obliged to expel a third-country national unlawfully present on\n\n its territory because he or she does not fulfil, or no longer fulfils, the conditions of duration\n\n of stay applicable there. Moreover, the Court held that Article 6 SBC establishing the entry\n\n conditions for third-country nationals when they cross an external border for stays not\n\n exceeding three months per six-month period, and Article 14 SBC concerning the refusal of\n\n entry to the territory of the Member States, both do not apply to third-country nationals who\n\n were unlawfully on the territory of the Member State and did not fulfil the conditions for\n\n entry, when the expulsion order was made against them (CJEU 22 October 2009 C-261/08\n\n Garcia & Cabrera, ECLI:C:2009:468, points 44, 45 and 66).\n\n 2. The reference by the French Conseil d\u2019Etat raised the question of whether a circular from\n\n the Minister of Interior introducing mandatory refusal of re-entry without a visa into French\n\n\n\n territory to third-country nationals holding acknowledgements of receipt of an asylum\n\n application was compatible with the Schengen Borders Code. Before that circular these thirdcountry\n\n nationals could leave France and return via the Schengen area external borders\n\n provided that that document had not expired. The circular put an end to that administrative\n\n practice without providing for a transitional period.\n\n The Court held that the rules governing refusal of entry laid down in Article 14 SBC apply to\n\n any third-country national who wishes to enter a Member State by crossing an external\n\n border of the Schengen area. These rules are also applicable to third-country nationals who\n\n are subject to the requirement to obtain a visa and wish to return via the Schengen area\n\n external borders to the Member State which issued them with a temporary residence permit\n\n pending examination of an application for asylum. That permit does not entitle the thirdcountry\n\n national to enter for that purpose the territory of another Member State. Further,\n\n the Court decided that the principles of legal certainty and protection of legitimate\n\n expectations did not require the provision of transitional measures in the SBC for the benefit\n\n of third-country nationals who had left the territory of a Member State when they were\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 86\n\n holders of this type of temporary residence permit and wanted to return to that territory after\n\n the entry into force of the SBC. Finally, it was held that a Member State which issues to a\n\n third-country national a re-entry visa within the meaning of that provision cannot restrict\n\n entry into the Schengen area solely to points of entry to its national territory (CJEU 12 June\n\n 2012 C-606/10 ANAFE, ECLI:C:2012:348).\n\n\n\n 3. Another judgment was given in the case of Mr Zakaria who had permanent residence rights\n\n in Sweden and flew from Beirut to Copenhagen via Riga, using as an identification document\n\n his Palestinian refugee travel document issued by Lebanon. At Riga airport, the border guards\n\n inspected his documents and finally allowed him to enter Latvia and thus the Schengen area.\n\n Mr Zakaria considered that his documents were inspected in an offensive and provocative\n\n manner, which violated his human dignity. On account of the time taken by that inspection\n\n he missed his flight to Copenhagen. He lodged a complaint with the Head of the State border\n\n control and sought compensation before Latvian courts. In answer to questions from the\n\n Latvian Supreme Court, the Court of Justice held that Article 14(3) SBC obliges Member\n\n States to establish a means of obtaining redress only against decisions to refuse entry. But\n\n the national court should establish whether the treatment of Mr Zakaria at Riga airport was\n\n in conformity with Article 7 SBC, requiring border guards in the performance of their duties\n\n to fully respect human dignity and not to discriminate against persons. Member States should\n\n in their national law provide for the appropriate legal remedies to ensure, in compliance with\n\n Article 47 EU Charter, the protection of persons claiming the rights derived from Article 7\n\n SBC (CJEU 17 January 2013 C-23/12 Zakaria, points 35 and 40).\n\n 4. Air Baltic in 2010 transported, on a flight from Moscow to Riga, an Indian citizen who, at\n\n border control at Riga airport, produced a valid Indian passport without a uniform Schengen\n\n visa and a cancelled Indian passport, to which a valid multiple entry uniform visa was affixed,\n\n issued by Italy. The cancelled passport contained the annotation: \u2018Passport cancelled. Valid\n\n visas in the passport are not cancelled.\u2019 The Indian citizen was refused entry into Latvian\n\n territory on the ground that he did not have a visa in a valid passport. The Latvian\n\n immigration authorities imposed an administrative fine on Air Baltic, on the grounds that Air\n\n\n\n Baltic had transported to Latvia a person without the required travel documents. Both the\n\n complaint made by Air Baltic with the administrative authorities and its action against the\n\n fine in the administrative court were dismissed. In reply to a the referral by the Riga\n\n Administrative Court, the Court of Justice held that Article 6(1) and Article 14(1) Schengen\n\n Borders Code, read together, provide that the entry of third-country nationals into the\n\n territory of Member States is not subject to the condition that, at the border check, the valid\n\n visa presented must necessarily be affixed to a valid travel document. The Court, more\n\n generally, held that a Member State does not have discretion to refuse a third-country\n\n national entry to its territory by applying a condition that is not laid down in the Schengen\n\n Borders Code (CJEU 4 September 2014 C-575/12 Air Baltic, ECLI:C:2013:2155, points 69\n\n and 70).\n\n 5. In an action brought by the Parliament, the Court, in 2012, annulled Council Decision\n\n 2010/252 supplementing the Schengen Borders Code as regards the surveillance of the sea\n\n external borders in the context of operational cooperation coordinated by Frontex because\n\n the Decision contained essential elements of the surveillance of the sea external borders of\n\n the Member States which go beyond the scope of the additional measures within the meaning\n\n of Article 12(5) of the 2006 SBC, and only the Parliament and the Council, acting together,\n\n were entitled to adopt such a decision (CJEU 5 September 2012 C-355/10 Parliament v\n\n Council, ECLI:C:2012:519).\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 87\n\n\n\n 6. Pending before the Court is the question of whether Article 3(1) of Regulation 1889/2005\n\n on controls of cash entering or leaving the Community and Article 5(1) SBC must be\n\n interpreted as meaning that a national of a third State who is in the international transit area\n\n of an airport is not subject to the obligation to make a declaration about carrying cash of a\n\n value of EUR 10 000 or more under Article 3(1) of Regulation 1889/2005, or, on the contrary,\n\n whether those provisions must be interpreted as meaning that that national is subject to that\n\n obligation by virtue of having crossed an external border of the Community at one of the\n\n border crossing points referred to in Article 5(1) Schengen Borders Code. (Case El Dakkak\n\n C-17/16)\n\n CJEU case law on internal borders\n\n All three cases relate to the limits of the powers of national authorities to conduct police\n\n controls in a zone directly behind the internal land borders with other Schengen states.\n\n 7. In the Melki case the French Cour de Cassation asked whether Article 67 TFEU precludes\n\n national legislation which permits police authorities, within an area of 20 kilometres from the\n\n internal land border with another Schengen state, to check the identity of any person in order\n\n to ascertain whether he fulfils the obligations laid down by law to hold, carry and produce\n\n papers and documents. The Court of Justice held that Article 67(2) TFEU and Articles 22 and\n\n 23 SBC precludes national legislation which grants national police authorities the power to\n\n check, solely within an area of 20 kilometres from the land border with another Schengen\n\n state, the identity of any person, irrespective of his behaviour and of specific circumstances\n\n giving rise to a risk of breach of public order, in order to ascertain whether the obligations\n\n laid down by law to hold, carry and produce papers and documents are fulfilled, where that\n\n legislation does not provide the necessary framework for that power to guarantee that its\n\n\n\n practical exercise cannot have an effect equivalent to border checks. (CJEU 22 June 2010 C-\n\n 188/10 Melki & Abdeli, ECLI:C:2101:363).\n\n 8. Mr Adil, an Afghan national was stopped by the Dutch border police when he was a\n\n passenger in a bus driving on a motorway within an area 20 kilometres from the land border\n\n with Germany. After he was stopped, Mr. Adil applied for asylum. He was put in immigration\n\n detention on the grounds of unlawful residence in Netherlands. Before the District Court and\n\n the Council of State, Mr Adil contested the lawfulness of the stop and the decision to detain\n\n him, on the grounds that the check amounted to a border check prohibited by the Schengen\n\n Borders Code. The Council of State referred the question on the limits of Member States\u2019\n\n power to conduct controls in the zone behind the internal land border to the Court of Justice.\n\n In the Adil judgment in 2012 the Court, as in the Melki judgment, observed that the checks\n\n were not carried out at the internal border as such. Hence, the checks were not prohibited\n\n by Article 22 SBC. Since they were carried out in the territory, the checks fell within the scope\n\n of Article 23 SBC. The Court held that Articles 22 and 23 SBC do not preclude national\n\n legislation which enables officials responsible for border surveillance and the monitoring of\n\n foreign nationals to carry out checks, in a geographical area 20 kilometres from the internal\n\n land border between two Schengen States with a view to establishing whether the persons\n\n stopped satisfy the requirements for lawful residence applicable in the Member State\n\n concerned provided that three conditions are met: (1) those checks are based on general\n\n information and experience regarding the illegal residence of persons at the places where the\n\n checks are to be made, (2) they may also be carried out to a limited extent in order to obtain\n\n such general information and experience-based data in that regard, and (3) the carrying out\n\n\n\n of those checks is subject to certain limitations concerning, inter alia, their intensity and\n\n frequency. (CJEU 19 July 2012 C-278/12 Adil, ECLI:C:2012:508).\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 88\n\n From these two judgments it appears that police checks applied uniformly throughout the\n\n territory will rarely be forbidden by Article 23 SBC. Specific rules on police checks in the\n\n border zone are permitted but should be accompanied by detailed safeguards to ensure that\n\n the checks are selective and targeted. In the Court\u2019s words: \u201cthe more extensive the evidence\n\n of the existence of a possible equivalent effect, within the meaning of [Article 23 Schengen\n\n Border Code] apparent from the objective pursued by the checks carried out in a border area,\n\n from the territorial scope of those checks and from the existence of a distinction between the\n\n basis of those checks and that of those carried out in the remainder of the territory of the\n\n Member State concerned, the greater the need for strict detailed rules and limitations laying\n\n down the conditions for the exercise by the Member States of their police powers in a border\n\n area and for strict application of those detailed rules and limitations, in order not to imperil\n\n the attainment of the objective of the abolition of internal border controls\u201d (Adil point 75).\n\n The earlier referral of a similar question to the Court by a Dutch District Court was withdrawn\n\n shortly after the Court\u2019s judgment in Adil (see case C-88/12 (Jaoo)).\n\n 9. The Amtsgericht Kehl (Germany), in a criminal case, referred two questions on police\n\n controls behind the internal land borders of the Schengen area to the Court in January 2016.\n\n Firstly, it asked whether Article 67(2) TFEU and Articles 22 and 23 SBC or any other rules of\n\n EU law preclude national legislation which grants the police authorities the power to check,\n\n\n\n within an area of up to 30 km from the internal (Schengen) land border, the identity of any\n\n person, irrespective of his behaviour and of specific circumstances, with a view to impeding\n\n or stopping unlawful entry into the territory of that Member State or to preventing certain\n\n criminal acts directed against the security or protection of the border or committed in\n\n connection with the crossing of the border, in the absence of any temporary reintroduction\n\n of border controls at the relevant internal border.\n\n Secondly, it asked whether Article 67(2) TFEU and Articles 22 and 23 SBC or any other rules\n\n of EU law preclude a rule of national law which grants the police authorities the power briefly\n\n to stop and question any person on a train or on the premises of the railways of that Member\n\n State, with a view to impeding or stopping unlawful entry into the territory of that Member\n\n State, and to request that person to produce for the purposes of checking the identity\n\n documents or border crossing papers he is carrying and visually inspect the articles he is\n\n carrying, if, on the basis of known facts or border police experience, it may be presumed that\n\n such trains or railway premises are used for unlawful entry and that entry is effected from a\n\n Schengen State in the absence of any temporary reintroduction of border controls at the\n\n relevant internal border. (Case A, C-9/16).\n\n 10. In the Shomodi judgment, the Court of Justice held that the spirit of Regulation No\n\n 1931/2006 on local border traffic demands that its provisions be given an autonomous\n\n interpretation where the need arises. Both the objectives of that regulation and its provisions\n\n indicate that the EU legislature intended to put rules in place for local border traffic which\n\n derogate from the Schengen Borders Code. (CJEU 21 March 2013, C-254/11 Shomodi,\n\n ECLI:C:2013:182, point 24).\n\n\n\n 11. The Court held in Gaydarov that it cannot be either the purpose or the effect of the\n\n Schengen Borders Code, as is clear from recital 5 and Article 3(a) thereof, to restrict the\n\n freedom of movement of Union citizens as provided for by the TFEU. (CJEU 17 November\n\n 2011, C-430/10 Gaydarov, ECLI:C:2011:749, point 28).\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 89\n\n ANNEX 2. EU LARGE-SCALE INFORMATION SYSTEMS: WHO\n\n HAS ACCESS TO WHAT?\n\n To date, Europol and Eurojust are the only EU security agencies that are authorised to\n\n connect to the three EU databases of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice whose\n\n structure is primarily based on a central system: the Schengen Information System second\n\n generation (SIS II), the Visa Information Schengen (VIS) and EURODAC. However, officials\n\n of the Commission and JHA Counsellors of the Council are pondering the possibility of\n\n granting access to SIS II to the future European Coast and Border Guard. Below we first lay\n\n out the access rights of Europol and Eurojust as EU law currently defines them. We then\n\n move on to locating the positions of both agencies in the wider security landscape, as they\n\n are defined by these access rights.\n\n Access to SIS II\n\n According to Article 41 of Decision 2007/533/JHA on the establishment, operation and use of\n\n the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II)235, Europol can access and\n\n search directly alerts on persons wanted for arrest or extradition,236 alerts on persons and\n\n objects wanted for discreet surveillance,237 and alerts on objects wanted for seizure in\n\n\n\n criminal proceedings.238\n\n If a search retrieves a hit, Europol informs the requesting Member State via a secure\n\n information exchange network application and Europol National Units. Europol may also\n\n request further information through the same channels.\n\n Europol is prohibited from recording or copying any parts of SIS II in any computer system\n\n such as the Analytical Work Files and the Europol Information System. Only specifically\n\n authorised Europol staff can handle SIS II requests. The Europol Joint Supervisory Body\n\n supervises the rights and practice of access to SIS II data.\n\n According to Article 42 of the SIS II Decision 2007/533/JHA, Eurojust can access and search\n\n directly alerts on persons wanted for arrest of extradition,239 alerts on missing persons, 240\n\n alerts to persons sought for participation in criminal procedures,241 alerts on objects wanted\n\n for seizure in criminal proceedings. 242\n\n In case of a hit, the members of Eurojust inform the issuing member states. No parts of SIS\n\n II can be copied onto Eurojust Computer System. According to Article 43 of SIS II\n\n Decision 2007/533/JHA Europol and Eurojust Staff may only access data that are necessary\n\n for the performance of their tasks.\n\n Finally, discussions are currently being held within the Commission regarding the possibility\n\n to grant the European Border and Coast Guard access to SIS II in order to improve and\n\n increase the operational involvement of this agency in return operations.\n\n 235 Council Decision 2007/533/JHA of 12 June 2007 on the establishment, operation and use of the second \ngeneration\n\n Schengen Information System (SIS II) OJ L 205, 7.8.2007, p. 63\u201384 (           http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legalcontent/\n\n EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32007D0533).\n\n 236 Council Decision 2007/533/JHA, Article 26.\n\nhttp://eur-lex.europa.eu/legalcontent\n\n\n 237 Ibid., Article 36.\n\n 238 Ibid., Article 38.\n\n 239 Ibid., Article 26.\n\n 240 Ibid., Article 32.\n\n 241 Ibid., Article 34.\n\n 242 Ibid., Article 38.\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 90\n\n Access to EURODAC\n\n According to Article 1.2 of EURODAC Regulation (EU) No 603/2013,243 Europol can access\n\n the database for law enforcement purposes. Article 7 of EURODAC Regulation (EU)\n\n No 603/2013 makes provision for the creation of a verifying authority, operating\n\n independently from the operating unit of Europol, which is authorised to request comparisons\n\n with EURODAC data. This unit is competent to \u201ccollect, store, process, analyse and exchange\n\n information to support and strengthen action by Member States in preventing, detecting or\n\n investigating terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences falling within Europol's\n\n mandate.\u201d\n\n According to Article 21 of EURODAC Regulation (EU) No 603/2013, the Europol operating unit\n\n can electronically request comparison with fingerprint data in cases where there is an\n\n overriding public security concern, where the comparison is necessary and case-specific and\n\n where there are serious grounds to suspect that a person who is registered on EURODAC\n\n might be involved in a serious crime or terrorism-related offence. Eurojust is not granted\n\n access to EURODAC.\n\n Access to the Visa Information System\n\n\n\n According to Article 1 of Decision 2008/633/JHA,244 Europol may access VIS for the purposes\n\n of combating terrorist and serious offences. Article 7 of Decision 2008/633/JHA makes\n\n provision for the creation of a specialised unit authorised to consult VIS data. Europol is\n\n authorised to retain VIS data for strategic purposes as long as the data has been anonymised.\n\n Eurojust is not granted access to VIS.\n\n EU agencies in the network of databases\n\n 243 Regulation (EU) No 603/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the \nestablishment\n\n of 'Eurodac' for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013\n\n establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an \napplication\n\n for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person \nand\n\n on requests for the comparison with Eurodac data by Member States' law enforcement authorities and Europol for\n\n law enforcement purposes, and amending Regulation (EU) No 1077/2011 establishing a European Agency for the\n\n operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice, OJ L 180, \n29.6.2013,\n\n p. 1\u201330.\n\n 244 Council Decision 2008/633/JHA of 23 June 2008 concerning access for consultation of the Visa Information\n\n System (VIS) by designated authorities of Member States and by Europol for the purposes of the prevention,\n\n detection and investigation of terrorist offences and of other serious criminal offences, OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. \n129\u2013\n\n 136.\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 91\n\n Graph X.Y. EU agencies in the network databases\n\n\n\n Source: Authors, 2016.\n\n These access rights locate Eurojust, Europol and the future EBCG in different parts of the\n\n network of institutions that are authorised to connect to these three databases. These\n\n institutions are of different nature. For the sake of clarity, the graph below distinguishes nine\n\n categories of end-users. These categories are based on an examination of the lists of\n\n authorities that are authorised to connect to the three databases, and which are published\n\n by EU-LISA245. Where necessary, we explain what these categories refer to:\n\n \u2022 Data Protection Authorities,\n\n \u2022 Justice (courts, judges and prosecutors),\n\n \u2022 Military police,\n\n \u2022 General administration,\n\n 245 List of designated authorities which have access to data recorded in the Central System of Eurodac pursuant \nto\n\n Article 27(2) of Regulation (EU) No 603/2013, for the purpose laid down in Article 1(1) of the same Regulation, \nEULISA,\n\n 2015; List of competent authorities which are authorised to search directly the data contained in the second\n\n generation Schengen Information System pursuant to Article 31(8) of Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 of the\n\n European Parliament and of the Council and Article 46(8) of Council Decision 2007/533/JHA on the establishment,\n\n operation and use of the second generation Schengen Information System, EU-LISA, 2015; Report on the \ntechnical\n\n functioning of VIS, including the security thereof, pursuant to Article 50(3) of the VIS Regulation, EU-LISA, 2015.\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 92\n\n \u2022 Asylum and Migration Services (departments in charge of policing foreigners and\n\n services in charge of granting asylum),\n\n\n\n \u2022 Police & Interior (general police services as well as forensic police services managing\n\n biometrics),\n\n \u2022 Transport (vehicle registration, port authorities and other competent agencies),\n\n \u2022 Security & Intelligence\n\n Visa and Consulates.\n\n The size of the nodes corresponding to end-users is proportional to the overall number of\n\n agencies in this category. For EU systems and agencies, nodes have a fixed size.\n\n Furthermore, the edges are weighted according to the degree of access that a category has\n\n with regard to one particular system. The thicker the edge, the closer the node of the agency\n\n is to one of the databases. Edges connecting EU agencies to EU databases have fixed\n\n thickness.\n\n Three clusters appear in this network. On the left side, one finds institutions that are\n\n connected solely to SIS II. These are transport authorities, military police (only three\n\n agencies and approximately 350 end-users institutions) and Eurojust. It is to be noted that\n\n the future EBCG, if it were to be granted access to SIS II, would also probably sit in this\n\n region of the network. In the upper left-hand side, between the SIS II and the VIS nodes,\n\n one finds a second cluster composed of institutions that can access both databases. This\n\n cluster comprises customs and judicial authorities, which nonetheless remain overwhelmingly\n\n drawn towards SIS II where most of their access lies. It also contains data protection\n\n authorities, which, by contrast, are drawn towards VIS where most of their access is.\n\n The third cluster corresponds to institutions that are granted access to the three databases:\n\n VIS, SIS II and EURODAC. This cluster is, first and foremost, clearly dominated by police and\n\n ministries of the interior, which enjoy the highest degree of access to the three databases,\n\n although they are closer to SIS II. Intelligence and national security services occupy a similar\n\n position, and it is to be noted that at least one national security service is granted access to\n\n\n\n EURODAC. Border guards, as well as migration and asylum departments, occupy a balanced\n\n position, located right in the middle of the three databases, since they have roughly equal\n\n access to all three.\n\n Europol is located in this node of the network. As it stands, however, the access rights of\n\n Europol to SIS II are limited to alerts that do no directly pertain to border control purposes.\n\n In particular, Europol is excluded from the scope of art. 24 of Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006\n\n dealing with third country nationals to be refused entry or stay into the Schengen Area. The\n\n same applies, mutatis mutandis, to Eurojust, whose access rights are limited to alerts\n\n covering criminal matters. If EBCG were granted access to SIS II, this regulation might be\n\n modified to open access rights of this article to the new agency.\n\n Access rights to EURODAC and VIS would remain virtually the main vehicle of Europol\u2019s\n\n involvement in EU border control. On31 December 2015 however, Europol was not connected\n\n to EURODAC (EU-LISA 2016). The impact of Europol\u2019s law enforcement checks in VIS on the\n\n issuing or refusal of visas remains unclear given the limited information published by eu-LISA\n\n to date. The technical reports on the operation of VIS (the 2016 version is still pending)\n\n makes no mention of checks by law enforcement authorities. Similarly, the conditions under\n\n which Europol staff anonymise VIS data before retention by Europol remain unclear. So are\n\n the strategic purposes that such retention supposedly serves.\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 93\n\n The image that nonetheless emerges from these observations is one where the inter-relations\n\n\n\n across data systems that are designed to deal with criminal and violent practices (mainly SIS\n\n II) on the one hand, and the data systems that are designed to manage the movement of\n\n EU citizens and third country nationals allows for a logic of suspicion to override a logic of\n\n rights, especially when those are the rights of third country nationals. Furthermore, there\n\n seems to be an inherent contradiction between the original exclusion of Europol from the\n\n scope of Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 on border control cooperation in the SIS II, and the\n\n access rights that were subsequently granted to Europol in VIS and EURODAC for the\n\n purposes of combating serious crimes and terrorism.\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 94\n\n ANNEX 3.

REPORT ON STAKEHOLDER DISCUSSION\n\n Report on Stakeholder discussion\n\n Venue: European Citizen Action Service\n\n Avenue de la Toison d\u2019or 77, 1060 Brussels, 1st floor\n\n\n\n Date: 7 June 2016\n\n Introduction and background:\n\n The meeting started with a welcome speech by Assya Kavrakova, ECAS Director and Sergio\n\n Carrera, senior researcher at CEPS.\n\n It was followed by a presentation of the preliminary results of the study by Lina Vosyli\u016bt\u0117,\n\n researcher at CEPS. The study provides a policy and legal analysis of two main documents:\n\n the Schengen Borders Code and the Schengen Evaluation and Monitoring mechanism and is\n\n based on a number of interviews conducted with experts of EU institutions and Permanent\n\n Representations of Member States. The stakeholder discussion was organised to verify if civil\n\n society organisations could play a role in these issues.\n\n The final study will include recommendations for decision-makers and will be presented to\n\n the LIBE Committee of the European Parliament on 12 July 2016.\n\n Part 1: Civil Society experience and positions in relation to free movement of\n\n persons, Schengen evaluation and monitoring mechanisms (SEM) and\n\n reintroduction of internal borders\n\n The stakeholder discussion was moderated by Kenan Had\u017eimusi\u0107, Senior Manager at ECAS.\n\n The organisations presented their position on the Schengen agreement in the context of the\n\n current political developments and reintroduction of internal borders:\n\n Young European Federalists (JEF Europe):\n\n \u2022 JEF Europe is an organisation with 30,000 members promoting a federal Europe.\n\n \u2022 JEF works on Schengen on a policy level by issuing resolutions both on Schengen and\n\n free movement.\n\n\n\n \u2022 JEF is against the reintroduction of borders, unless needed for specific reasons.\n\n \u2022 Main campaign \u201cDon\u2019t touch my Schengen\u201d:\n\n The key goal was to reach out to young people and involve them around the topic.\n\n The online campaign was implemented through \u2018thunderclap\u2019 and reached out to 1.5\n\n million people while the offline campaign took place in 25 cities.\n\n \u2022 JEF sent a letter to the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, and received\n\n an email of support for the campaign. The President of the European Parliament,\n\n Martin Schulz, and President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, have\n\n also reacted positively to the initiative.\n\n Milieu:\n\n \u2022 Milieu is a multi-disciplinary consultancy based in Brussels.\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 114\n\n \u2022 Milieu has published several studies: Study on free movement of workers, FRA studies\n\n on border management, study on obstacles of free movement for families, etc.\n\n \u2022 Milieu has been also analysing Schengen from the point of view of consumer law. [The\n\n European Commission has been highlighting the importance of the shared economy\n\n and encouraging deregulation in order to foster more peer-to-peer transactions.\n\n Schengen is necessary for this shared economy so it is important to take into\n\n consideration the consumers perspectives.]\n\n \u2022 Regarding the migration crisis, it is important to reinforce the external borders in\n\n\n\n order to enjoy fully free movement internally.\n\n AEGEE:\n\n \u2022 AEGEE is a student organisation, striving for a democratic, diverse and borderless\n\n Europe. It has been working on free movement of persons since its launch.\n\n \u2022 AEGEE was amongst the first promoters of the creation of the Erasmus project.\n\n \u2022 AEGEE was the first to open up to Eastern Europe and has been addressing issues\n\n regarding visas.\n\n \u2022 AEGEE has issued policy papers regarding migration and the freedom of movement,\n\n mainly on how these issues have impacted the lives of young Europeans.\n\n \u2022 AEGEE also does advocacy work and implements projects around these topics.\n\n \u2022 AEGEE notices that the problems arising from this subject are mainly related to the\n\n lack of information and of knowledge on Schengen and on citizens (and human) rights.\n\n ESN:\n\n \u2022 ESN is a non-profit international student organisation, which works on international\n\n mobility of students.\n\n \u2022 The recent issues regarding Schengen have not had an impact on Erasmus students.\n\n ECAS:\n\n \u2022 ECAS is a European association which helps citizens exercise their rights in the EU\n\n and has been actively supporting the free movement of citizens for more than 20\n\n years.\n\n \u2022 ECAS runs Your Europe Advice (YEA) - a service which provides tailor-made legal\n\n advice to more than 22,000 EU citizens annually who exercise their right of free\n\n\n\n movement in the EU and encounter difficulties. YEA has experienced a 9.4% increase\n\n in enquiries in 2015 compared to 2014, which is indicative of the growing number of\n\n problems associated with the practical implementation of the most cherished right by\n\n EU citizens. YEA is not a complaints mechanism, however, and does not register\n\n fundamental rights\u2019 violations.\n\n \u2022 ECAS carries out advocacy activities at the EU level to support a better environment\n\n for EU citizenship rights.\n\n \u2022 ECAS strongly feels a need for more campaigns which focus on preserving the balance\n\n between fundamental rights, freedom and security. (eg. The Passenger Name Records\n\n (PNR), issue shows how data can today be widely shared for the sake of \u2018security\n\n threats\u2019). There is no clear definition of public security threats and this could lead to\n\n dangerous situations which Europe has already had to deal with in the past.\n\n \u2022 ECAS has noticed how Member States are becoming more \u2018inventive\u2019 when\n\n jeopardising EU rights.\n\n Personal experiences:\n\n The participants took the opportunity to share their personal experiences regarding the\n\n Schengen situation. Some of them have noticed clear violations of human rights and privacy\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 115\n\n in border controls while travelling. For example, it is unacceptable to see how people with a\n\n\n\n more \u2018southern\u2019 physical appearance are heavily interrogated by authorities at borders.\n\n Furthermore, the question is on how efficient the controls are, as in some countries it is\n\n relatively easy to avoid controls by simply taking side roads.\n\n One participant highlighted that the main problem of the Schengen situation is the\n\n reinterpretation of certain articles of the legal framework which provide opportunities for\n\n political manoeuvres.\n\n Several policy-makers stated that people in Europe are increasingly buying into nationalist\n\n agendas. However, the youth organisations at the stakeholder discussion are challenging this\n\n statement. The campaign \u2018Don\u2019t touch our Schengen\u2019 is a good example.\n\n Communication and information are key factors. There is common concern on what kind of\n\n information citizens receive on the Schengen situation and the migration situation. Hence,\n\n the focus should be on ways to increase citizens\u2019 understanding of Schengen and of their\n\n rights as EU citizens (people do not understand their rights are being violated at border\n\n controls.)\n\n Further analysis should focus on who is targeted by these border controls under the current\n\n situation. ECAS mentioned how the questions from citizens have increased in the last year\n\n under YEA. It could be interesting to examine the questions/cases and examine what has\n\n changed.\n\n Part 2: Schengen Borders Code versus Dublin II Regulation\n\n This session was on relations and distinctions between the Schengen Border Code and the\n\n\n\n Dublin II regulation. Specific remarks include:\n\n \u2022 ECAS and ESN declared no position on this topic. They both deal with EU mobility\n\n rights more than migration issues.\n\n \u2022 AEGEE explained how the Dublin framework does not help the migration situation\n\n since it is just a way to \u2018trap\u2019 refugees in some Member States to keep the problem\n\n away.\n\n \u2022 JEF Europe is pushing EU institutions to reach a common asylum and migration policy\n\n in the EU.\n\n General remarks:\n\n \u2022 Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) agree that one big problem is the lack of\n\n information on the migration situation. Migration is badly perceived by the public\n\n because of the media, speeches by politicians with extremist views etc. Not only is it\n\n important for decision-makers to inform citizens in the right way about these people,\n\n but also one of the main duties of CSOs is to support the change of narrative on\n\n migration and counterbalance negative stereotypes.\n\n \u2022 CSOs are concerned about the integration of migrants in our societies and highlighted\n\n the need to foster education and awareness-raising in particular. The challenge is twofold:\n\n how to allow refugees to have access to the education system in Europe and, at\n\n the same time, how to educate European societies about refugees, tolerance etc.\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 116\n\n\n\n \u2022 CSOs have highlighted that there is indirect support for refugees by the EU institutions\n\n more than direct support. For example, organisations working for refugees are being\n\n heavily funded by the EU, especially projects which involve the education of refugees\n\n on soft skills or hard skills.\n\n Part 3: Role of CSOs in the evaluation of the implementation of the Schengen\n\n agreement \u2013 should civil society take a more active role in the institutional\n\n framework of the SEM or play an independent watchdog role?\n\n CSOs think they should be both having a more active role in the SEM framework and having\n\n more of a watchdog and monitoring role. They proposed different ways to have a more active\n\n role on the Schengen agreement:\n\n \u2022 CSOs could work on a joint request to access documents in order to understand why\n\n Schengen-related documents are treated under the confidentiality rules and to get\n\n access to the information concerning the fundamental rights of citizens.\n\n \u2022 CSOs can request to participate in the Frontex Consultative Committee.\n\n \u2022 CSOs could enhance collaboration with the European Union Agency for Fundamental\n\n Rights (FRA)\n\n \u2022 Media campaigns to inform citizens about Schengen.\n\n \u2022 Creation of an online repository of relevant documents. This would facilitate access to\n\n information on the topic.\n\n \u2022 Collaboration with the organisers of the Schengen Watch, created by Jon Worth and\n\n supported by EMI, which is a collection of opinions/experiences by people at the\n\n borders.\n\n\n\n \u2022 Project on free legal aid to migrants in a language they understand. Access to\n\n information is the second important need after humanitarian aid. There are a lot of\n\n legal clinics around Europe who could collaborate.\n\n \u2022 CSOs could take part in monitoring the application of the Schengen acquis\n\n [One of the participants referred to a good example of a civic monitoring project\n\n implemented in the period 2010-2011. The project consisted in assessing the progress\n\n of Bulgaria and Romania\u2019s preparation for joining the Schengen area, specifically on\n\n the implementation of the action plans of the two governments. The main objective\n\n was to push the governments to implement quality measures and inform citizens of\n\n both countries about the implementation of the acquis. Shadow civic reports were\n\n developed because the Minister of Interior in Bulgaria had agreed to be subject to\n\n monitoring and had granted CSOs access to information. Six independent CSO teams\n\n could assemble independent information with the primary goal of measuring\n\n implementation according to timeframe and objectives. More information: Progress\n\n Reports on the Accession of Bulgaria and Romania towards the Schengen Area.\n\n Concluding remarks\n\n From the stakeholder discussion, the two main effects of the Schengen situation on citizens\u2019\n\n mobility are:\n\n 1. The uncertainty of the impact on citizens\u2019 rights, in particular free movement.\n\n 2. The impact of the sharing of personal data as a tool to allegedly increase security (e.g.\n\n the impact of Passenger Name Records).\n\n Policy Department C: Citizens\u2019 rights and Constitutional Affairs\n\n\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 117\n\n ANNEX: Stakeholder Discussion \u2013 List of Participants\n\n Surname Name Position Organisation\n\n Apert Jeremy Project Coordinator Erasmus Student Network\n\n (ESN)\n\n Carrera Sergio Senior Researcher Centre for European Policy\n\n Studies (CEPS)\n\n Erdelyiova Katarina\n\n Project and\n\n Communication\n\n Assistant\n\n Young European Federalists\n\n (JEF Europe)\n\n Had\u017eimusi\u0107 Kenan Senior Manager European Citizen Action Service\n\n (ECAS)\n\n Kavrakova Assya Director European Citizen Action Service\n\n (ECAS)\n\n Lironi Elisa Coordinator European Citizen Action Service\n\n (ECAS)\n\n Perez-Seoane Alvaro\n\n Oleart PhD Candidate\n\n\n\n Centre d'\u00e9tude de la vie\n\n politique, Institut d'\u00e9tudes\n\n europ\u00e9ennes (ULB)\n\n Semenyak Maryana Network and Human\n\n Resources Director AEGEE Europe\n\n Silva Marta Legal Adviser Milieu\n\n Triantafyllakis Antonis Member AEGEE Europe\n\n Vosyli\u016bt\u0117 Lina Researcher Centre for European Policy\n\n Studies (CEPS)\n\n Internal borders in the Schengen area: is Schengen crisis-proof?\n\n ___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 118\n\n ANNEX 5.
