{"title": "The Harm of Illegal Immigrants", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\n In Aaron W. Godfrey's June 13 Soapbox essay, ''Island's Necessary, Invisible People,'' he tells us that many \nimmigrants, whom he euphemistically calls undocumented but who are in reality illegal immigrants, ''do the work \nthat we will no longer do.'' That is nonsense.\n\n If every illegal immigrant were gone, the jobs would still exist. Employers would be forced to pay more to have \nthem done. But the savings to the American public in the costs of the education, medical care and welfare we give \nto illegal immigrants would be dramatic. \n\n  For example, a recent report by the Federation for American Immigration Reform shows that New York alone \nspends $756 million a year to educate the children of illegal immigrants. This is money that should be helping \neducate American children.\n\n Higher wages would encourage American citizens now on welfare to work, saving us even more. Allowing illegal \nimmigrants to work rewards two classes of people, the illegal immigrants and the employers who illegally hire \nthem. One group of people is harmed: the American public. \n\nROBERT F. LAPORTA\n\nDix Hills\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
