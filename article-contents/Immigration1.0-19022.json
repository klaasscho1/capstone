{"title": "Mexico rails against U.S. border plan", "body": "\nThe Mexican government, angered by a U.S. proposal to extend a wall along the border to keep out migrants, has \nstruck back with radio ads urging Mexican workers to denounce rights violations in the United States.\n\nFacing a growing tide of U.S. anti-immigrant sentiment, the Mexican government is also hiring an American public \nrelations firm to improve its image.\n\nPresident Vicente Fox denounced the U.S. measures, passed by the House of Representatives on Friday, as \n\"shameful\" and his foreign secretary, Luis Ernesto Derbez, Monday called the wall \"stupid.\"\n\nIt's hard to underestimate the ill-feeling the proposal has generated in Mexico, where editorial pages feature \ncartoons of Uncle Sam putting up walls bearing anti-Mexican messages.\n\nThe government is scrambling to fight on two fronts. On Monday, it announced it had hired Allyn & Co., a Dallas-\nbased public relations company to help improve Mexico's image and stem the immigration backlash.\n\nThe government also has stepped up its defense of migrants, airing radio spots aimed at migrants returning home \nfor the holidays.\n\n\"Had a labor accident in the United State? You have rights... Call,\" reads the ad, sponsored by Mexico's Foreign \nRelations Department, which has helped migrants bring compensation suits in the United States.\n"}
