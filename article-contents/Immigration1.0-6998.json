The smuggling came to light in May 1997, when 23 Chinese men were found wandering \nthe streets of Bay Head, south of Asbury Park, after a powerboat ferrying them to shore from Mr. Cho's ship ran \naground on a foggy night.\n\nAcknowledging Mr. Cho's cooperation with investigators, a federal judge gave him about half the maximum term \nand waived a fine. Mr. Cho, who operated a fishing business before he ran into financial trouble, could still face \ndeportation, his lawyer said.\n\nMr. Cho said through an interpreter that he intends to work honestly and do volunteer service when freed. \"I must \nhave been out of my mind to do what I have done,\" he said.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
