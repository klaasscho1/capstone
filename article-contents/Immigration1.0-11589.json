{"title": "INS tracking of students is due in July", "body": "\nA new system that will allow the Immigration and Naturalization Service to track an estimated one million foreign \nstudents will be up and running in the next several months, Justice Department sources said yesterday.\n\nThe start-up of the Internet-based system is seen by officials as a significant step toward monitoring foreign \nstudents and beefing up the country's antiterror safeguards.\nThe system is scheduled to be operational by July 1.\n\nThe system is designed to provide up-to-date computerized information on nonimmigrant foreign students, such as \nname changes and new dropouts, an official said. Each school will have 24 hours to input changes.\n\nSchools now maintain paper records on foreign students; the records are not kept in a central location and are not \nprovided to the INS unless the agency requests them.\n\n\"It is the single best step the federal government can take to keep closer tabs on international students studying in \nthe United States,\" said Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education, a trade \nassociation that represents 1,800 public and private colleges and universities.\n\nA 1996 immigration-reform law required the INS to upgrade the system by which it keeps track of the foreign \nstudents studying in the United States at any time. The system must be in place by January.\n\nPressure to get the system up and running has increased since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York and \nWashington. Hani Hanjour, one of the 19 hijackers, used a student visa to enter the United States, saying he \nwanted to study English. He never showed up for class.\n"}
