{"title": "FEDS HEM IN 230 ILLEGAL WORKERS", "body": "\nFederal authorities have busted more than 230 illegal aliens working in 14 Manhattan garment factories as part of \na major crackdown on unauthorized workers and the firms that employ them.\n\nThe arrests, which began in the middle of last month, were made at small factories in the Garment District near \nPenn Station in a wide-ranging operation by the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n\nMost of those nabbed were immigrants who arrived here illegally from Latin America, said Mark Thorn, an INS \nspokesman.\n\n\"These latest arrests are part of a special project we've been working on since October '95,\" he said. \"We targeted \nthe garment industry because it's very large and very well-known, but mostly because it has been historically a \ngateway for immigrants to find employment.\"\n\nThe INS hopes that by making it tougher for companies to hire unauthorized workers, it can cut the flow of illegal \nimmigration.\n"}
