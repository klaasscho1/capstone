Some 7,000 people have been killed in drug wars in Mexico in the past two \nyears, with 960 people killed so far this year in Sinaloa alone. When the Government drafted in the Army to help \nthe police, human rights organisations accused them of using excessive force. During his seven days embedded \nwith the local police, Williams drives from the scene of one cartel-style execution to the next in a country where the \nrule of law is stretched to breaking point.\n\n Gardeners' World Special BBC Two, 8pm  \n\nThere is something delightfully old-fashioned about Gardeners' World. As Christmas becomes ever more \ncommercialised, it strives to conjure up a magic that isn't dependent on AA batteries. In tonight's programme, an old \ncar jack is used to squash apples. This apple juice, delicious on its own, can be heated up and laced with brandy \nand cinnamon and given to granny. The garden has been planted with willow, reflecting the low winter sunlight in \nvivid shades of red and orange. Bottles of English sparkling wine are cracked open, and tree and table decorations \nare made. Just thinking about it is curiously restful.\n\n Oceans BBC Two, 9pm  \n\nIt is appropriate that the last ocean in this series is the Arctic. Although the smallest and shallowest of the big five, it \nplays a vital role in the regulation of the climate - and is heating up twice as fast as anywhere else on Earth. Some \n90 per cent of the sunlight that hits the ice is reflected back into space. As the reflective ice disappears, the water \nwarms up. More ice melts and the entire process speeds up, accelerating global warming. Within five years, two \nmillion square miles of permanent sea ice will be gone. But amid the anxiety, there is fabulous footage of huge \nbearded seals, Atlantic walruses and Beluga whales.\n\n Peter Kay's Britain's Got An Extra Pop Factor and Then Some 2+1 Channel 4, 9pm  \n\nPeter Kay's spoof of reality shows clearly struck a nerve with talent show-obsessed Britain a few weeks back. With \n5.5 million viewers, it got the highest ratings of the year for Channel 4. In an exceptional evening for comedy on TV \n- which includes Frankie Boyle Live at the Apollo and a repeat of Eddie Izzard's classic stand-up routine in New \nYork - this could be the highlight. Being a spin-off from the previous show, it features \"exclusive\" interviews with this \n\n\nyear's winner, Geraldine McQueen, and the chance to hear her new single, Once Upon a Christmas Song. /S \n897007617 /SO The Times /PD 19 December 2008 /PG 1 /SCT Home news /HD Rachel Nickell's killer is linked to \n109 sex crimes /BY Sean O'Neill, Adam Fresco /TX /PA Police admit they did not do their job properly /PA   A litany \nof serious mistakes by the Metropolitan Police left Robert Napper, a psychotic killer, free to take the lives of two \nyoung mothers and a four-year old girl. /PA   One of Scotland Yard's most senior officers admitted yesterday that \nthe killings of Rachel Nickell on Wimbledon Common in July 1992 and of Samantha and Jazmine Bissett in their \nhome a year later could have been prevented had police done their jobs properly. Assistant Commissioner John \nYates said that \"more could and should have been done\" by the Met. /PA   Napper, 42, who suffers from paranoid \nschizophrenia, waged a five-year campaign of sexual violence, claiming almost 90 victims before he was finally \ncaught. /PA   An Old Bailey judge ordered him to be detained indefinitely at Broadmoor high security hospital for the \nmanslaughter of Ms Nickell. He has been an inmate of the hospital since 1995, when he admitted the Bissett \nkillings. It has taken 16 years for him to be brought to justice for the death of Ms Nickell because police believed \nthat Colin Stagg was guilty. Detectives will now interview Napper about other unsolved cases. He has been linked \nto 109 offences and 86 potential victims. /PA   Napper's mother had reported him to police as a rapist in 1989, but \nhe was not investigated at the time and he went on to kill Ms Nickell, stabbing her 49 times and mutilating her body \nin front of her two-year-old son, Alex. /PA   Ms Nickell was found dead with the child holding her arm. His face was \ncovered in blood and he was crying and pleading: \"Get up, Mummy.\" /PA   Detectives made Mr Stagg the prime \nsuspect in the Nickell case, setting up a \"honeytrap\" operation to entice him into a confession. /PA   Their \ncolleagues, meanwhile, questioned Napper on four occasions as a potential sex attacker but he went on to kill \nagain - murdering Ms Bissett, 27, and Jazmine in a brutal, sexually motivated attack. Natalie Pyszora, a Broadmoor \npsychiatrist, said that the police's failure to catch him made Napper feel untouchable. /PA   Mr Yates said that the \nMet had to acknowledge the mistakes made in focusing on Mr Stagg and missing a series of opportunities to \napprehend Napper. He added: \"Had more been done, we would have been in a position to have prevented this (Ms \nNickell's death) and other very serious attacks by Napper. I particularly here refer to the dreadful murders of \nSamantha and Jazmine Bissett.\" /PA   Mr Yates offered an apology to the families of Mr Napper's victims and to Mr \nStagg. Only a week ago the Met publicly apologised for the bungled operation that led to the death of Jean Charles \nde Menezes. The force's embarrassment is compounded today by forthright criticism from Sir Harry Ognall, the \njudge who threw out the prosecution of Mr Stagg in 1994. /PA   Writing in The Times, Sir Harry says: \"The police \nclosed their minds to any other possibility than that of his (Mr Stagg's) guilt. That cardinal error corrupted the whole \nof their investigation. They were wrong.\" /PA   Ms Nickell's parents were in court to see Napper admit manslaughter \non the ground of diminished responsibility. Andrew and Monica Nickell sat two rows behind their daughter's former \npartner, Alex Hanscombe, the father of their grandson. As the court heard details of Napper's ferocious three-\nminute attack, Mrs Nickell bowed her head and her husband placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. /PA   In a \nvictim impact statement, Mr Nickell said: \"The greatest loss is your future. All the things that any family hopes for \nand expects are completely smashed. There will be no daughter to talk to in our old age, no grandchildren to love \nand admire. At a stroke all this has been removed.\" /PA   Mr Nickell revealed a bitter rift with Mr Hanscombe, who \nhe said had retreated \"into pain and blame\". He added that he and his wife no longer saw their grandson, who is \nnow 19. /PA   Mr Justice Griffith Williams said that he hoped that Napper's guilty plea might enable him \"to draw to \na close a long chapter in his life\". /PA   The judge said that the evidence of injuries to the boy's face suggested that \nNapper had dragged him face down along the ground. /PA   Napper was told that he was un- likely ever to be \nreleased from Broadmoor. The judge said: \"You are on any view a very dangerous man. You suffer from two \nserious mental disorders, paranoid schizophrenia and Asperger syndrome. Although treated over the years, you still \npresent a very high risk of sexual homicide which can only be managed in a high-security hospital to reduce the risk \ntowards women.\" /PA   {   /S 897007618 /SO The Times /PD 19 December 2008 /PG 2 /SCT Features /HD Number \nCrunch;Leading article;Comment;Opinion /BY   /TX /PA Intelligent public debate in Britain is made more difficult by \nthe low trust in the Government's data. An independent statistical authority is the only solution /PA   There have \nbeen many methods mooted for telling the future before the fact: water divination, the stars, legible tea leaves and \nnumerology. None offers any foresight but they are no less blind than our modern soothsayers, the economic \nforecasters. In the Budget, the Treasury forecast that borrowing for this year would be Pounds 43 billion. Then, in \nthe Pre-Budget Report, it said Pounds 78 billion. Alastair Darling, the Chancellor, has already given warning that net \nborrowing next year might hit Pounds 118 billion. Retail sales this November rose 1.5 per cent when economists \nhad been forecasting a fall of 0.4 per cent. /PA   This complete failure to see round corners is exacerbated by the \ntendency of governments to use statistics not as performance measures but as political mantras. Last week, 10 \n\n\n\nDowning Street and the Home Office were upbraided by Sir Michael Scholar, the head of the UK Statistics \nAuthority, for releasing data on knife crime that was, as he put it, \"premature, irregular and selective\". The Home \nOffice had already been criticised in August by the head of the Royal Statistical Society for playing fast and loose \nwith the release of immigration figures. These incidents cast doubt on all the data in the public domain. No sooner \ndoes the Government claim an improvement to a service than the integrity of its statistics is impugned. The Institute \nof Directors recently decried the data on maths and English performance by 11-year-olds. On all the available data, \ncrime is falling but hardly anyone believes the numbers. It is widely assumed that the Government is lying about the \nnumber of un- employed people, the numbers on incapcity benefit, the number of immigrants. /PA   A survey by \nthe Office for National Statistics (ONS) found that fewer than one in five Britons believe ministers do not meddle \nwith official figures. Improving public trust was one of the issues that Gordon Brown said would define his \npremiership. And, indeed, a reform Bill was introduced in April this year. It created the UK Statistics Authority, to \noperate purportedly at arm's length from government. The new regime introduced an independent governing board \nfor the ONS, a regular report to Parliament and a session before the Treasury Select Committee. It was all very \nsensible-sounding and none of it has made any great difference at all. /PA   The current system will never inspire \nconfidence. The basic problem is that the Government is still involved at every stage. Government departments \nactually compile four fifths of all data that are released. Initial drafts of National Audit Office reports go through a \nnegotiated clearance with departments during which contentious findings are usually removed. /PA   The basic \nprinciple to follow is that the people who gather interesting facts should themselves be disinterested. Full \nindependence to the UK Statistics Authority is the only way to increase public confidence. That move should be \ncoupled with the removal of the right of politicians to see data before release. The current rules permit a select \ngroup of ministers to see market sensitive information 40 hours before it is made available to the public. France \nallows just an hour and the United States no more than 30 minutes. /PA   It would also make sense if the range of \nadvice available to politicians were widened. No institution has a monopoly of wisdom about the present, let alone \nthe future, and the Treasury has no claim to either title. Twenty days into Mr Brown's chancellorship in May 1997, a \nlittle- noticed Treasury press release noted that competitive tendering for its forecasting had been rejected. It is time \nthat a wider range of numer- ologists was brought in. A richer conversation and an independent body is the only \nway to make us believe the statistics are not just damned lies. /PA   {   /S 897007619 /SO The Times /PD 19 \nDecember 2008 /PG 2 /SCT Features /HD Draining the Poison;Leading article;Comment;Opinion /BY   /TX /PA A \nformal verdict on the Rwandan genocide is essential for reconciliation /PA   The systematic slaughter of more than \n800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda in 1994 was one of the most horrific crimes perpetrated since the \nHolocaust, and one of the few that can genuinely be called genocide. The verdict yesterday by the UN Tribunal that \nColonel Theoneste Bagosora, the chief instigator of the massacres, was guilty of crimes against humanity is entirely \nappropriate (see page 43). /PA   Life imprisonment will seem to many a mild sentence, and will do little to assuage \nyears of grief. But it sends a powerful message to tyrants across Africa and beyond. Whatever the attempts to \nexplain away barbarism with the cliche of only obeying orders, those who carry out, as well as those who order, \nmass killings will be held responsible and prosecuted - by the United Nations, if not by their own compatriots. It is a \nmessage that needs to be clearly understood in Zimbabwe as well as in Sudan. /PA   The verdict is also vital in the \nattempt to promote reconciliation. Societies torn apart by violence cannot be healed if no one is held accountable. \nUnless blame is formally established, a victim community will hold all their oppressors collectively responsible. If \nMuslims were not to see all Serbs as murderers, it was important to set up trials for the main instigators of the \nmassacres in former Yugoslavia. The same is true of Rwanda. /PA   The two tribunals have proved ponderous \ninstruments for delivering justice. The opulence and grandeur of a European court system seems out of touch with \nthe experience of the victims. The legal process in Arusha, the Tanzanian town where the Rwandan accused are \nbeing tried, has already taken 14 years, as defence lawyers have been able to manipulate the trial procedures. So \nfar, the tribunal has already convicted thirty-four people and acquitted six others. The Bagosora case, by far the \nmost important, began in 2002 and was expected to last two years. In the end, it lasted six, covering 409 trial days, \nhearing 242 witnesses and producing 30,000 pages of transcripts. /PA   If this was the price for draining Rwanda of \nits poisonous legacy, it was worth paying. The country has, however, already done much to promote healing. Since \nmany of the 63,000 perpetrators are still living among the relatives of the men, women and children they killed with \nmachetes, iron bars or primitive clubs of planks and nails, it was vital to promote a national catharsis. Rwanda has \ndone so through community courts, or gacaca, where suspects are encouraged to confess and seek forgiveness in \nexchange for lighter sentences. It has been remarkably successful. /PA   The wider evil of the genocide has not yet \nbeen overcome, however. The Hutu militias fled into refugee camps inside Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of \n\n\n\nCongo. They have since regrouped and are planning an armed return to Rwanda to avenge their defeat. Rwanda's \nTutsi-dominated Government will never rest easy while they remain as an armed threat, and is supporting the \nrebellion against the Congolese Government. Some five million people have already died in the resulting confused \nregional conflicts. /PA   The Arusha tribunal has only a year to run but has not finished its work. A further twenty-\nthree accused remain on trial and eight trials are yet to begin. The doors of justice must stay open until all those \nwho perpetrated these atrocities have been brought to court. /PA   {   /S 897007620 /SO The Times /PD 19 \nDecember 2008 /PG 2 /SCT Features /HD Maestro;Leading article;Comment;Opinion /BY   /TX /PA Alfred Brendel \nhas advanced and enriched the universal language of high art /PA   Alfred Brendel, among the greatest musicians \nof the age, and now suffering from mild arthritis, took his leave of the concert stage last night. Appropriately for a \npianist whose repertoire is especially associated with Mozart and Schubert, his final performance took place in \nVienna, with a rendition of Mozart's Ninth Piano Concerto. Brendel's concert career has spanned 60 years. In \naddition to his live concert performances, he has recorded the 32 piano sonatas of Beethoven, twice, and the 27 \npiano concertos of Mozart. He is also an accomplished essayist. /PA   Brendel's contribution to music is immense. \nBut two aspects of his life and work are parti- cularly noteworthy. First, his performances of musical masterpieces \nare spare and unadorned. He has eschewed the flamboyance that characterised Romantic interpretations, such as \nthose of Jorge Bolet, a maestro of great popularity in the 1970s and 1980s. Brendel has allowed the music to speak \nfor itself, and make sense in its own terms. As he has written of the quandries of playing Mozart: \"'Poetic' players \nmay find themselves sitting in a hothouse in which no fresh air can enter; you want to come and open the windows.\" \n/PA   Second, Brendel - born in what is now the Czech Republic, growing up in Yugoslavia and Austria, and long \nsettled in London - epi- tomises the remarkable cultural contribution of Central European polymaths in the past \ncentury. Belonging to the generation after the flight of European intellectuals from Nazism, he has continued a great \ntradition. Few artists exemplify more exactly the universal character and language of Western art. /PA   {   /S \n897007621 /SO The Times /PD 19 December 2008 /PG 3 /SCT Overseas news /HD Corruption claims engulf \nNobel prize;Factbox /BY David Charter /TX /PA The integrity of the Nobel prize was called into question last night \nafter it emerged that a member of the jury also sat on the board of a pharmaceuticals giant that benefited from the \naward of this year's prize for medicine. /PA   Prosecutors were studying whether AstraZeneca, the London-based \nmultinational pharmaceutical company, could have exerted undue influence on the award. /PA   The joint winner of \nthis year's Nobel Prize for Medicine, Harald zur Hausen, was recognised for his work on the human papilloma virus \n(HPV), which can lead to cervical cancer. AstraZeneca has a stake in two lucrative vaccines against the virus. /PA   \nTwo senior figures in the process that chose Mr zur Hausen have strong links with the pharmaceutical company, \nwhich has also recently begun sponsoring the Nobel website and promotional subsidiary. The company strongly \ndenies any wrongdoing. /PA   It is not the only question mark hanging over the probity of the Stockholm based \nfoundation. The Swedish prosecutor yesterday opened a parallel investigation into bribery allegations after several \nmembers of Nobel committees admitted enjoying expenses-paid trips to China to tell officials how candidates are \nselected for prizes. /PA   Other members of the Nobel Foundation are said to be gravely concerned that the \nreputation of an organisation that honours the highest achievements in human endeavour is under threat from \ncompanies and nations hungry for Nobel glory. /PA   Questions began to be asked about AstraZeneca's role after it \nagreed to sponsor Nobel Media and Nobel Web. Neither the company nor the foundation will say how much the \ncontracts are worth, although they are estimated to run into hundreds of thousands of dollars over the next three \nyears. /PA   Further concerns were raised by Swedish radio, which revealed that Bertil Fredholm, the chairman of \nthe five-strong committee that assesses Nobel candidates, was a paid consultant for AstraZeneca in 2006. Bo \nAngelin, a member of the 50-strong committee that votes for the winner, also sits on the board. /PA   Last year, \nAstraZeneca acquired a company that developed a key component licensed for the production of two HPV vaccines \nmade by other companies. /PA   Christer van der Kwast, the director of the Swedish police anti-corruption unit, \nordered a preliminary investigation. His actions have been dismissed by Michael Sohlman, executive director of the \nNobel Foundation, who told Scientific American magazine: \"How should I put this?

I have ordered the prosecutor-in-charge to look into this.\" /PA   A spokesman for AstraZeneca \nrejected any suggestion that its influence over the Nobel Foundation was improper. He said: \"We have no influence \nover the prizewinners nor would we ever seek to. AstraZeneca as a company is not involved in the process of \nNobel prize selection.

The world of literature, for example, is a comparatively small one. A book prize judge is quite likely to \nknow at least some of the people nominated for the prize, or their agents, or their publishers.

There is even an Awards and Recognition Association in the US, \nwhich hands out awards for the best awards. /PA   But far from devaluing the currency of prizes by flooding the \nmarket, prizes matter more than ever. They are the accepted measure of cultural value, self generating publicity, far \nmore important than critical acclaim and, in many instances, the key to commercial success and career \nenhancement. /PA   In the vast sea of prizes, none is more coveted than the great Nobel prize, founded by the \ninventor of dynamite 25 centuries after the Greeks began awarding prizes for art.

They escalated, as he became more deranged, from indecent \nexposure to the rape of a mother pushing a pram. /PA   When the police attention on his \"hunting ground\" came too \nclose, he crossed London to kill Ms Nickell as she walked on Wimbledon Common with her son, Alex, aged 2. \nWhile the hysterical child looked on, Napper stabbed his mother 49 times and mutilated her body. /PA   In \nNovember 1993 he broke into the flat of Samantha Bissett and stabbed her to death before sexually assaulting and \nsmothering her four-year-old daughter Jazmine. He then returned to Ms Bissett's body, which he mutilated with \nmacabre precision. /PA   To date only seven crimes can be firmly attributed to Napper - three killings, two rapes and \ntwo attempted rapes. He refuses to discuss any further cases unless police can produce scientific proof of his guilt. \n/PA   His trademark was attacking young mothers with children. Psychologists put the trait down to a childhood \nscarred by abuse and violence, but detectives say that Napper regarded women with children as more compliant \nvictims. /PA   Everyone agrees that there were numerous missed chances to stop him before he became a killer. \n/PA   He left a trail of fingerprints, footprints, DNA and other traces that it took police years to identify. He was \nrepeatedly stopped, questioned, arrested and even charged and jailed. One uniformed constable even noted that \nhe seemed likely to be a rapist, but no detective seemed able to join the dots. /PA   He was textbook material for \nforensic psychology, but when Paul Britton, the profiler working with the police, was asked if one man had killed Ms \nNickell and Ms Bissett he dismissed the idea. \"It was a completely different scenario,\" he said. /PA   The reluctance \nto investigate Napper for the Nickell murder can be explained only by a belief, shared by the police, the \npsychologist and Crown Prosecution Service lawyers, that they already had their man. In their view Colin Stagg was \nguilty, so they ignored the material on Napper. /PA   Robert Clive Napper was born on February 25, 1966, in a \nhospital in Erith, southeast London, the first son of Brian Napper, a driving instructor, and his wife Pauline. His \nchildhood was spent in a violent home until his mother sued for divorce when he was 10. Her health deteriorated \nand her children spent periods in foster homes. At 12, Robert was sexually assaulted by a family friend on a \ncamping trip. /PA   As a teenager he was reticent and obsessive, characteristics now thought to be signs of \nAsperger syndrome. /PA   After school he worked in manual jobs, leaving home aged 21 to live in a bedsit. In \nNovember 1989, Pauline Napper phoned Plumstead police station to say that her son was claiming to have raped a \nwoman on Plumstead Common. Police told Mrs Napper that they could not trace the crime. Had they looked a little \nharder they would have discovered the unsolved case of a 30-year-old woman raped in her home by a masked man \nwho tied her up and put a Stanley knife to her neck. Her children were downstairs. /PA   Psychiatrists who have \nexamined Napper believe that the beginning of his series of attacks coincided with the onset of paranoid \nschizophrenia. Natalie Pyszora, who supervises his treatment, says that Napper is delusional, believing grandiose \nthings about his life while convinced that he is being persecuted. Napper believes that he has an MA in \nmathematics, a Nobel prize, medals for fighting in Angola and millions of pounds in a bank in Sidcup. He claims that \nhis family is in Who's Who, that he could transmit thoughts telepathically and was kneecapped by the IRA. His \nfingers, he says, were blown off by a parcel bomb but grew back when he inhaled \"sparkle fumes\". /PA   Professor \nDon Grubin, a forensic psychiatrist, said that the combination of schizophrenia with Asperger syndrome was a \n\n\n\n\"particularly toxic\" mix. /PA   The ferocity of his attacks on women began to build. In March 1992 he attempted two \nknifepoint rapes then, on a Bank Holiday weekend that May, came an assault that stood out. A woman pushing her \ntwo-year-old daughter in her buggy had a rope thrown round her neck and was pulled to the ground, beaten, kicked \nand raped. /PA   Less than two months later, Ms Nickell was killed. Police in that case drew no link to the Green \nChain rapes. Their killer was felt to be someone who knew Wimbledon Common and attention focused on Mr \nStagg, a loner who lived nearby. Under the guidance of Mr Britton, an attractive policewoman tried to seduce him \ninto confessing with the promise of sex. Mr Stagg's eagerness to please Lizzie James, as the officer called herself, \nled to him being charged in August 1993. /PA   A month after the killing Napper was interviewed over the Green \nChain rapes. Police asked him to give a DNA sample but Napper twice failed to keep appointments. Police \neliminated him from the inquiry because, at 6ft 2ins, he was taller than the man they thought they were looking for. \n/PA   In October 1992 Napper was arrested when a search of his flat uncovered firearms, ammunition, knives and a \ncrossbow. He was jailed for eight weeks. Officers did not note the significance of other material in his flat - diaries, \nhand-drawn maps and a London A-Z on which he had marked dots at points on the Green Chain walk and inside of \nwhich was a young woman's gym membership card. Her address had been circled on the map. The next April, \nchildren playing near Napper's flat dug up a tin inside which was a Mauser handgun. Napper's fingerprints were on \nthe tin. /PA   Napper was stopped by police in July 1993 after he was seen peering through the windows of a 24-\nyear-old woman's flat. He told officers that he was \"going for a walk\" and was let go. One policeman wrote in his \nnotebook: \"Subject strange, abnormal, should be considered as a possible rapist, indecency type suspect.\" Instead \nof stepping up inquiries into Napper, however, police were considering Mr Stagg as a suspect for the Green Chain \nattacks. /PA   Jim Sturman, QC, then Mr Stagg's junior defence counsel, recalled: \"Colin was going to be pulled out \nof interview to go off for an ID parade for the Green Chain rapes because he was a close match to the photofit of \nthe man suspected of committing those rapes. But almost as he was on his way the news came back that the DNA \nwasn't a match.\" /PA   Then, on November 4, 1993, with Mr Stagg in custody, there was an attack with appalling \nsimilarities to the Nickell murder. Ms Bissett, a single mother, and her daughter were killed in their flat near \nNapper's home. /PA   Ms Bissett's body was so badly mutilated that it put Mr Britton, the profiler, in mind of Jack the \nRipper's murder of Mary Jane Kelly in 1888. But he remained adamant that despite the similarities between the \nNickell and Bissett killings - attractive blonde women stabbed with their young children present - they were not the \nwork of the same man. /PA   Although his bloody finger and palm prints were all over the victims' flat, Napper was \nnot arrested for the Bissett murders until May 1994. /PA   A search of his home found a footprint made by an adidas \nPhantom basketball shoe (few of which had been sold in Britain) which matched a bloody mark in Ms Bissett's \nkitchen. More than a decade later, forensic scientists discovered that a similar shoeprint had been left at the scene \nof the Wimbledon Common killing. /PA   A padlocked red toolbox was recovered but a decade would pass before \nthe discovery that paint flecks from it had been left in Ms Nickell's son's hair when Napper flung him to the ground. \nInside the box was another A-Z directory with potential attack locations marked. /PA   For four months, from May to \nSeptember 1994, Napper and Mr Stagg were both in custody. Sources say that there was unease among some \nprosecutors and police officers who felt the case against Mr Stagg was weak and wanted Napper examined as a \nsuspect for the Nickell murder. /PA   In Wimbledon a lock knife was found buried on the common. In southeast \nLondon, it was known that Napper liked to bury his weapons and had bought a knife of the same make. /PA   But \nthe threads were not examined together. The case against Stagg seemed unstoppable until it reached the Old \nBailey, where Mr Justice Ognall condemned it as a gross attempt to incriminate.

The \ncase against Colin Stagg was based on a single rotten plank;Commentary;Opinion;Factbox;Rachel Nickell /BY Sir \nHarry Ognall /TX /PA Robert Napper's guilty plea yesterday to the manslaughter of Rachel Nickell completes a \nremarkable legal circle. When Colin Stagg was charged with that same brutal killing I was the judge appointed to try \na case that excited enormous media coverage. Before the trial in 1994 three things were apparent. /PA   First, the \npolice were faced with overwhelming pressure to identify the killer and establish a compelling case. Second, they \nwere faced with a desperate lack of evidence of any quality against Mr Stagg - their exclusive candidate for the \nmurder - let alone evidence sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, it was obvious that the \njudge would need to be especially wary of the real risk that the jury might be swept along by the tide of widespread \nhostility to the accused and return a guilty verdict notwithstanding the absence of effective proof. /PA   The second \nof those features led the police to set up the so-called honey trap, using an undercover policewoman to seduce Mr \nStagg into a confession. It proved to be a fruitless initiative. The high-water mark of the material thereby obtained \nwas a single comment by him that might, on one view, have been construed as betraying an awareness of details of \nthe attack that could only have been known to the perpetrator. There was nothing else in the prosecution's locker. \nThere was no identification, no scientific evidence, no circumstantial evidence and no subsequent incriminating \nbehaviour. Neither was there DNA available either to implicate or to exonerate him. In the event, I ruled that the \nevidence derived from the entrapment should not go before the jury. It is a graphic measure of the frailty of the \nprosecution case that, bereft of the foothold offered to them by that rotten plank, they elected to drop their case, and \nMr Stagg was acquitted. /PA   Since then a campaign of innuendo has been mounted in sections of the press that \nhas repeatedly invited the public to conclude that Mr Stagg had literally \"got away with murder\". The truth, of \ncourse, was that he had not got away with anything. He had been singled out because he was a soft target. His \nappearance, his lifestyle and the libidinous exchanges with the policewoman painted him in singularly unattractive \ncolours. /PA   The police closed their minds to any other possibility than that of his guilt. That cardinal error \ncorrupted the whole of their investigation. They were wrong. I claim no special credit for ruling as I did. I am certain \nthat any other judge in my position would have recognised that proof of guilt was simply not there. To leave the \nentrapment evidence to the jury would be to open the door to the wholly unacceptable risk that prejudice would \nreplace proof. /PA   There will no doubt be suggestions that there are obvious lessons to be learned from this 14-\nyear saga. I am not so sure. Media hysteria, an embattled police force and the duty of a criminal trial judge to \nensure inherent fairness of the process are not novel dimensions in the history of criminal justice. What is novel (or \ncertainly extremely rare) is the emergence of conclusive proof that Mr Stagg was not exonerated on what has been \nrepeatedly characterised as a \"technicality\", but on the uncontestable foundation of truth and innocence. /PA   I \nconclude with two personal reflections. First and foremost, I profoundly hope that the final disposal of this case will \nhelp to bring a kind of closure to those who loved and cherished the vivacious young woman who was Rachel \nNickell, and who have been denied justice for so many years. And I hope that I can now be confident that the \nvendetta pursued against me by certain newspapers in the aftermath of the trial in 1994 is now put to rest. /PA   It is \n\n\n\ntoo much to expect an apology: arrogance is rarely supplanted by decency.

A British \nwhite Christmas, though, is a rare event, having occurred only ten times since 1900. /PA   A sustained dry spell is \nforecast over the next week because of high pressure. A strong high-pressure system blocks depressions, forcing \nthe accompanying wet and windy weather to make a \"detour\", so there could be clear skies over much of Britain on \nChristmas Day. Temperatures will depend on where the centre of the anti- cyclone is anchored - indications are that \nit might drift northwards and sweep in cold, dry air from Europe. /PA   With clear skies, it is possible that frost and \nfog may follow a freezing Christmas Eve night and, first thing in the morning on December 25, it could almost \n\n\n\nresemble snowfall. /PA   But all is not lost. The bookmakers' definition of a white Christmas is for a single snowflake \nto fall anytime within the 24-hour Christmas Day period at a specific location. This year, in London, it will be \nBuckingham Palace. /PA   In rare circumstances, snow can fall from a clear blue sky. This is most likely to happen \nin the Arctic or Antarctic, where moisture in the air is frozen into fine crystals of ice that resemble tiny diamonds, or \nsnowflakes, known as \"diamond dust\". The phenomenon occurred this February during bitterly cold weather in \nvarious parts of England. /PA   For those interested in more outlandish weather phenomena, William Hill is offering \nodds of 100/1 for the River Thames to freeze over between Westminster Bridge and Tower Bridge in London, \nalthough this has not happened since 1814. /PA   In the future, it seems that a white Christmas will become even \nmore of a dream. According to climate predictions, the chances of snowfall at Christmas in Britain will drop by up to \n65 per cent by 2050, as the winters become milder. /PA   {   /S 897007640 /SO The Times /PD 19 December 2008 \n/PG 11 /SCT Home news /HD Thousands prepare for their longest break in years /BY Alexi Mostrous /TX /PA The \nlongest Christmas break for 16 years begins in earnest today as the recession forces tens of thousands of workers \nto take a holiday lasting up to a month. /PA   Many will not return to work until January 19 after their employers shut \ndown for an extended break.

As Christmas Day falls on a \nThursday this year, people also have the option of travelling early next week as well as over the weekend. /PA   The \ndeepening economic gloom will also alleviate traffic with thousands expected to stay at home to save money.

The AA said that it expects possible delays on the M1, A1, M6, M23 and M42, adding \nthat Monday is expected to be the busiest day for drivers. /PA   Train travellers - some 22 million rail journeys are \nforecast for this weekend - are likely to face fewer problems than last Christmas when engineering work on the \nWest Coast Main Line caused havoc to journeys. The Association of Train Operating Companies said that delays \nthis Christmas are expected to be minimal. \"Overall, engineering work is much, much less than last year and \ntherefore fewer people will be disrupted,\" an official said. /PA   \"Passenger numbers are slightly up but demand \nbetween Christmas and new year will be very low.\" /PA   About 1.3 million Britons are leaving the country this \nweekend, with more than 600,000 flying out from Heathrow.

Mr Darling also raised his borrowing \nexpectations for 2009-10 further, to Pounds 118billion, or 8 per cent of national income. /PA   Yesterday's worse-\nthan-expected figures for November led economists to suggest that the Chancellor may be forced to raise his \nborrowing to a level not seen in modern times. \"While alarmingly high, the Government deficit projections in \nNovember's Pre-Budget Report are already looking too low as the recession looks certain to be significantly deeper \nand longer than the Government has forecast,\" Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, a \nconsultancy, said. /PA   Mr Darling has conceded that the economy will shrink next year by up to 1.25 per cent, but \nis pinning his hopes on a robust recovery in 2010, with predicted growth of between 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent. \nMany analysts fear that the economy will contract by 2 per cent or more next year, followed by a weak revival in \n2010, with growth of less than 1 per cent. /PA   John Hawksworth, of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting \ngroup, predicted yesterday that the Chan- cellor would have to borrow Pounds 82billion - 5.6 per cent of GDP - in \n\n\n\n2009-10. This would climb to Pounds 130billion in 20010 11, equivalent to 8.9 per cent of GDP, taking borrowing \nabove the 8.1 per cent reached in 1974-75, when Denis Healey was Chancellor. /PA   The scale of the mounting \nstresses on government finances was evident in the detail of yesterday's dire figures. /PA   Tax receipts from \ncompanies and individuals last month fell 5.2 per cent compared with the same time last year. That compares with \nMr Darling's forecast for tax revenues to drop by only 0.6 per cent in 2008-09 as a whole, and by 3 per cent in the \nsecond half of the financial year. /PA   VAT payments fell 5.1 per cent compared with November last year. Even \nafter last month's cut in VAT to 15 per cent, Mr Darling is predicting a fall of only 0.4 per cent in VAT revenues for \nthe period from last month to March. /PA   While Mr Darling's tax revenues wilt, government spending continues to \ngrow, driven by rising welfare bills. Total spending, excluding capital projects such as building roads, hospitals and \nschools, rose 6.2 per cent last month, while social security spending was up 7.1 per cent. /PA   \"The public finances \nlook pretty awful,\" said Vicky Redwood, of Capital Economics. \"It's just worrying that they are that bad this early on \nin the recession.\" /PA   The Government's financial state is aggravating a sharp sell-off of the pound as market \nconcern grows over Britain's worsening economic predicament. Yesterday the pound dropped by another 2 euro \ncents from its closing value on Wednesday to hit Euro 1.0541, leaving the euro worth a record 94.86p at one point. \n/PA   The pound also surrendered some of its gains registered against the dollar this week, shedding 0.9 cents to \nclose in London at $1.5339, leaving the trade-weighted index of sterling's overall value close to a record low at \n76.7. /PA   {   /S 897007655 /SO The Times /PD 19 December 2008 /PG 19 /SCT Home news /HD Repossessions \nwill reach 75,000 next year, lenders warn;Factbox;The Economy /BY Francesca Steele /TX /PA Mortgage lenders \nsaid yesterday that 75,000 people could lose their homes next year, despite government measures intended to \nprevent the number of repossessions. /PA   The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) has forecast that \nrepossessions will reach 45,000 this year and rise by 67 per cent in 2009.

It was the first time since \n2003 that tax receipts have been down, year on year, for two consecutive months. /PA   That will only get worse as \nthe recession - already set to be the nastiest since 1980-81 - deepens. Receipts from stamp duty have all but \nvanished because of the collapse in the housing market, while income and corporation tax receipts will carry on \nfalling. /PA   VAT receipts, meanwhile, are also likely to fall sharply after Alistair Darling's decision to cut rates in the \nPre-Budget Report. That only came into effect on December 1 and so, of course, had no bearing on the November \nfigures. These, by the way, were down 15 per cent, year on year, contradicting yesterday's scarcely believable \nclaim from the Office for National Statistics that retail sales actually rose during the month. At the same time, \ngovernment spending is going in completely the wrong direction, with rising unemployment pushing up welfare \npayments. /PA   Second, while not altogether a surprise, it is still a shock to learn that public sector borrowing hit \nPounds 16billion last month. That is a new all time high for a single month and suggests the Treasury's target of \nborrowing a total of Pounds 78billion this financial year - made, remember, less than four weeks ago - is already \nhopelessly out of date. With four months of the financial year still to go, borrowing already stands at Pounds \n56.1billion. At least one City economist now suggests that total borrowing will hit Pounds 90billion this year. /PA   \nThird, the public sector net debt now stands at Pounds 650billion, equivalent to 44.2 per cent of Britain's annual \neconomic output. Had Mr Darling not so publicly repudiated his predecessor's \"golden rule\", that this measure \nshould not top 40 per cent, he would certainly be having to now - although, in fairness to the Chancellor, the limit \nhas only been busted by virtue of having to rescue Northern Rock. /PA   With this unpromising backdrop, and \nCharlie Bean, the Bank of England deputy governor, hinting at zero interest rates here, it was scarcely surprising \nthat sterling fell for a ninth consecutive day against the euro yesterday.

Speaking to reporters after the \nscreening, he said: \"Don't spoil it, all of you.

He and a team led by Jamie Thomson, of the University of Wisconsin, then \nrepeated the feat with human tissue. /PA   The cellular reprogamming involves wiping out a cell's developmental \n\"memory\" by tweaking up to four genes, which causes it to revert to an embryo-like state from which it should be \nable to form any of the body's 200 or so specialised cell types. /PA   This year several groups around the world \nhave created IPS cells that model real diseases. Other scientists have made progress in ironing out some of the \nsafety problems - the first IPS cells were made by manipulating genes with viruses, in ways that could promote \ncancer. Science cautioned, however, that considerable work is still required before IPS cell technology is ready for \nclinical trials. /PA   The runner-up on the breakthrough list was the direct observation of planets orbiting stars. While \nmore than 300 of these \"exoplanets\" are now known, the vast majority were detected by measuring wobbles in the \nlight from a star, or by other indirect means. This year, scientists have obtained direct images of several planets, \nsuch as three objects that orbit a star called HR8799, 128 light years from Earth. The achievement required \nsophisticated methods for blotting out the light from the planets' parent stars, which normally makes them invisible. \n/PA   The development of new genome sequencing technology, which promises to bring the cost of reading the \nhuman genetic code down to about $5,000 (Pounds 3,200), also made the list. These methods have also let \nscientists map the genomes of extinct animals, such as the woolly mammoth. /PA   Other advances to be honoured \ninclude the most detailed video taken of a developing embryo, new calculations of the weight of the world, and the \ndiscovery of new genes that influence cancer. European big science was named as the phenomenon of the year, \nchiefly for the switch-on of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, but also because of the start of \nconstruction work on the ITER experimental fusion reactor in France.

In Lockerbie's case it was 7.03pm, when Pan Am Flight 103 dropped from the sky. /PA   You cannot walk \nthe streets today without the reminders: Sherwood Crescent, where the wing and fuel tank ploughed into the \nhouses and evaporated them, leaving a massive crater, reeking of aviation fuel; Rosebank Crescent, where the \nfuselage came down and scattered bodies across gardens, on the rooftops and the hillsides around. /PA   \nTundergarth, four miles outside the town, is where the nose cone came to rest, its name, Maid of the Seas, written \nplainly on the side, to become the unforgettable memorial to the 270 who died: pilots, stewards, passengers and the \n11 Lockerbie people who perished with them. /PA   These things are remembered in the town, but the memories \nare not oppressive. Most people I spoke to preferred to talk about the way that Lockerbie has moved on, its new \nhouses, the jobs created, its hopes for the future. The neat memorial garden at the Dryfesdale Cemetery, with its \ngranite monument bearing the names of all who died - \"their ages range from 2 months to 82 years and they came \nfrom 21 nations\" - is an intensely moving place, not because it is imposing, but because it is so ordinary, with its \nneat paths and newly planted trees. /PA   Many of the relatives who have come here, and drawn comfort from the \nlong views out to the Southern Uplands, have commissioned plaques that try to encapsulate the lives lost: \"An old-\nfashioned gentleman\", \"Killed in the line of duty\", \"Goodnight, sweet Kate\" are among the inscriptions. /PA   At \nTundergarth, a tiny new chapel has a vellum book with the name of each victim carefully inscribed, and another, \ntelling the story of who they were and what they had achieved. /PA   The links between the town and the families \nwho come back year after year to remember those they lost have grown, and most of them record their gratitude for \nthe support they have received. One mother used to come every year to Tundergarth, cross a fence and walk 33 \npaces to the spot where her daughter died, and stand there, silently remembering. Two years ago she died. But this \nyear her second daughter came over to do the same: the chain remains unbroken. In the Tundergarth chapel, a \nnote in the visitors' book, written only ten days ago, records: \"Alexia, you fell here, sheltered by the people of \nLockerbie. God made the Scots a wee bit better.\" /PA   George Stobbs, now 74, was the police inspector in charge \nof the Lockerbie sub-division that night. He has told his story many times, because he feels he owes it to \nsuccessive generations to remind them of the enormity of what happened; but it still has the capacity to shock. He \nremembers the first body he came across, a woman lying in the street, her clothes torn off. \"I thought she must \nhave been killed by debris; I had no idea she had fallen out of the sky.\" He saw hedges on fire, the flames from a \n\n\n\nruptured gas main shooting up through the paving stones, an iron gate in Sherwood Crescent melting in front of his \neyes, the crater, like a volcano, belching fire, the tyres blazing at Townfoot garage right on top of the petrol tanks, \nwhich miraculously never went up, a fireman holding a useless hose because by sheer bad luck a piece of the \naircraft had severed the main water supply. /PA   When word came in from Prestwick that the radar had recorded \nfive blips showing the disintegration of Pan Am 103 at 35,000ft, Stobbs knew that it must be sabotage. \"By 8pm it \nhad become a murder inquiry,\" he says. That meant, among other things, marking each body where it lay. Many \nwere naked, stripped of their clothes as they fell through the sky, and each had to be examined and documented. At \na case conference next day Mr Stobbs asked his men if they needed any support. \"There was no counselling in \nthose days, and most of them seemed OK,\" he said. \"But I noticed one young chap, who was very silent. He said \nhe was fine, but then he broke down. He'd never seen a girl naked before, and now he had, and she was dead.\" \n/PA   Today, Lockerbie has not only been rebuilt, but is growing, its population about 4,500. In Sherwood Crescent, \nthe only reminder of the past is a gap along one side, where five houses were destroyed. The families of those who \ndied asked that it be left open rather than rebuilt, so a memorial garden stands in their place. /PA   Meanwhile, the \nlegacy of that December night remains in the links built between Lockerbie Academy and the University of Syracuse \nin New York, which lost 35 students in the disaster. Each year two pupils from Lockerbie go out to Syracuse to \nspend a year there. At the same time Syracuse has established 35 scholarships for its own students. Three years \nago, Erin McLaughlin, from Lockerbie, not only won the opportunity of going out to Syracuse, but won one of the \nthirty-five scholarships. She went on to gain a PhD at New York University. \"Not bad for a wee girl from southwest \nScotland,\" says Lockerbie's headmaster, Graham Herbert. /PA   Interest in the Syracuse programme has never \nbeen greater, with more than twenty applicants for the two places this year. I spoke to two of them, Dora Lewis and \nCraig Stoddart, both 17, born three years after the Lockerbie disaster. \"It's never been forgotten,\" Craig said. \"We \nare such a small community that everyone knows someone who was there.\" But it has also left a legacy. Dora \nexplained: \"It gives our school this link with America, something very special that not many others have. It was a \ntragedy, but it has left something good.

Two Libyans were eventually charged, and one imprisoned. But \ndoubts remain over whether they were the sole instigators of the attack, and if so, whether some of the evidence \nagainst them was manufactured. /PA   Who was in charge of the case? /PA   Last week Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, \nthe former Lord Advocate, who was in charge of the investigation, spoke candidly to The Times about his role in the \naffair, the reliability of the Crown's case, and whether, looking back, the Scottish police had been right to target the \ntwo Libyan accused, Al-Amin Khalifa Fhimah and Abdul Baset Ali al-Megrahi. He addressed the key criticisms \nmade by those who say the case was flawed. /PA   Were Iran and Syria involved? /PA   For the first 18 months of \nthe inquiry, the Scottish police were convinced that the Palestinian terror group the PFLP-GC were the perpetrators, \nperhaps sponsored by the Iranians in revenge for the shooting down of an Iranian airliner earlier in 1988. Only \nweeks before the Pan Am explosion, German police had seized a Palestinian gang after a bomb attack in Berlin, \nand found Toshiba cassettes adapted as bombs, which were identical to the one whose fragments had been found \nnear Lockerbie. /PA   Lord Fraser does not discount the involvement of other states, but he points out that no \ndefinitive evidence has been produced to link them to the attack. The Libyans, on the other hand, were traced \nthrough the diligence of Scottish detectives, who managed to identify the manufacturers of clothing found in the \nsuspect suitcase that had held the bomb. By proving that the clothing had been bought in Malta, and then \nestablishing that the purchaser was al-Megrahi, they laid the foundations of the Crown case. \"For me that was the \nmost significant breakthrough,\" Lord Fraser says now. /PA   Could the CIA have planted the timer fragment that \npointed to Libya? /PA   The discovery of a fragment of circuit board from a timer made by a Swiss company with \nlinks to Libya was critical to the prosecution. But accounts of how, where and by whom it was found varied. The \noriginal fragment was found several miles from the wreckage, and some weeks after the disaster. /PA   It was not \nuntil very much later that the CIA claimed to have identified it and matched it with a circuit board manufactured by \nMebo of Zurich, a company run by Edwin Bollier, who had supplied timers to the Libyan Government. Some experts \nhave argued that the find was just a bit too convenient to the US investigators, since, by targeting the Libyans, they \ncould avoid falling out with Iran and Syria, important allies at the time of the Gulf War. So could the CIA have \nplanted the evidence? \"I don't know,\" says Lord Fraser. \"No one ever came to me and said, 'Now we can go for the \nLibyans', it was never as straightforward as that. The CIA was extremely subtle. For me the significant evidence \n\n\n\ncame when the Scottish police made the connection with Malta.\" Pressed for his own view, he cites a Scottish \nmurder case, that of Patrick Meehan, in which, it was alleged, the prosecution case had been \"improved\" by the \nplanting of evidence. Was there a similarity? \"I don't know,\" he said again, \"but if there was one witness I was not \nhappy about, it was Mr Bollier, who was deeply unreliable.\" /PA   Was Tony Gauci, the Maltese shop owner, a \nreliable witness? Controversy has always surrounded Mr Gauci, the owner of Mary's House in Sliema, Malta, who \nidentified al-Megrahi as the man who bought the clothes found in the wreckage. Over the years his accounts of that \ncritical purchase have varied, and claims have been made, not only that he first identified a different shopper, but \nthat he had been prompted by being shown photographs of al-Megrahi. Lord Fraser was quoted in newspaper \narticles in 2005 as saying that Mr Gauci was \"not the full shilling\". But Mr Gauci also remembered something that no \none had mentioned: that he persuaded the Arab to buy an umbrella. Checks revealed that one umbrella in the \nwreckage was bomb-scarred. /PA   Was there a conspiracy? /PA   Tam Dalyell, the former MP, has argued that the \nCIA may have known about the attack beforehand. Lord Fraser rejects that. \"I told Tam Dalyell: if there was a \nconspiracy, then I am in it up to the neck. I have to be involved. The only other possibility is that I have been so \nnaive that bits of evidence have been planted, and I have swallowed it hook, line and sinker.

Almost 50 years on, it has finally been repeated \nby scientists - showing that people today are still willing to hurt others when prompted by an authority figure. /PA   In \na controversial series of studies that started in 1961, Stanley Milgram demonstrated the horrifying extent to which \npeople will follow orders, even when their actions seem to be inflicting serious harm on others. /PA   In the \nexperiments, which participants were told were to investigate learning, people were asked to administer electric \nshocks of increasing voltage to a \"learner\" in the next room whenever he answered a question incorrectly. The \nlearner, in reality an actor, reacted first with squeals of discomfort, then with cries of pain, and then by imploring the \nexperi- menter to stop. He eventually fell silent, as if he had passed out. /PA   An overwhelming majority of the \nsubjects, however, kept on delivering shocks: 82.5 per cent kept going after the first cries of pain at 150 volts, and \n79 per cent continued until the shock generator had been turned to 450 volts, a lethal dose. /PA   The Milgram \nexperiment, as it is known to social psychologists, has since been invoked to explain outrages such as the \nHolocaust, the Rwandan and Bosnian genocides and the Abu Ghraib torture in Iraq. /PA   It prompted Professor \nMilgram, of Yale University, to remark that he had once thought it would be impossible to find sufficient people in \nAmerica to commit atrocities on the scale of the Nazis, yet his research convinced him that there were enough in \nhis local city of New Haven, Connecticut. /PA   His conclusion, however, remains controversial because his results \nhave never been replicated. \"People learning about Milgram's work often wonder whether results would be any \ndifferent today,\" Jerry Burger, of Santa Clara University in California, said. \"Many point to the lessons of the \nHolocaust and argue that there is greater societal awareness of the dangers of blind obedience.\" /PA   While \nprevious attempts to restage the experiment have been rebuffed by ethics boards, Dr Berger obtained permission \nby slightly altering its design. The new research, published in the journal American Psychologist, suggests that little \nhas changed since Professor Milgram's work. /PA   Dr Berger found that 70 per cent of participants were willing to \ncontinue delivering electric shocks once the learner had cried out in pain at 150 volts. That proportion was not \nstatistically different from the 82.5 per cent who did so in the Milgram study. /PA   \"My partial replication of \nMilgram's procedure suggests that average Americans react to this laboratory situation today much the way they \ndid 45 years ago,\" Dr Berger said. \"Although changes in societal attitudes can affect behaviour, my findings indicate \nthat the same situational factors that affected obedience in Milgram's participants still operate today.\" /PA   Dr \nBerger's study differed from Professor Milgram's in several respects. Participants were stopped from going farther \nafter the learner cried out at 150 volts. This was to prevent psychological harm that might affect participants who \ndiscovered that they could potentially have killed somebody. /PA   Volunteers were also screened to exclude \nanybody who might react badly, or anybody familiar with the original Milgram work. Before the experiment began, \nthey were told that they could withdraw at any point and still receive their $50 (Pounds 33) fee. /PA   Participants \nwere also told afterwards that the learner was an actor and that nobody had been hurt. /PA   These differences may \nlimit the parallels between this study and the original, according to Arthur Miller, of Miami University in Ohio. \"There \nare simply too many differences ... to permit conceptually precise and useful comparisons,\" he wrote in American \nPsychologist. /PA   Other psychologists, however,thought that the work useful. Richard Wiseman, of the University \nof Hertfordshire, said: \"It does suggest that obedience to authority is alive and well ... Everyone thinks that they \nwouldn't do it, but the majority of people do. This ties in with other work suggesting that we overestimate the degree \nto which we are different from one another, and think that we would be far more willing to stand out from the crowd \nthan we actually are. /PA   \"It would be nice to think that Milgram's results were somehow a product of the 1960s \npostwar culture, but the effects seem far more embedded in our brains and society than we think.\" /PA   Dr Berger \nsaid: \"Milgram's studies have maintained a place in psycho- logy classes and textbooks largely because of their \nimplications for understanding the worst of human behaviours, such as atrocities, massacres and genocide. Indeed, \nMilgram frequently drew inferences from his studies to account for the behaviour of people who went along with the \nHolocaust. /PA   \"Although one must be cautious when making the leap from laboratory studies to complex social \nbehaviours such as genocide, understanding the social psychological factors that contribute to people acting in \nunexpected and unsettling ways is important.\" /PA   {   /S 897007672 /SO The Times /PD 19 December 2008 /PG \n32 /SCT Features /HD Iraq inquiry is inevitable, even if it is fraught with risks /BY Peter Riddell, Political Briefing /TX \n/PA Gordon Brown has only put off the inevitable day of reckoning over Iraq.

Thirsty and hungry, they are ready for \nbreakfast. /PA   Women from the village of Chamadinga have been busy since daybreak preparing for their arrival, \ncollecting water from the well and heating porridge on an open fire behind the collection of little huts. /PA   In \nMalawi, HIV/Aids is the biggest cause of death of parents, though that is rarely mentioned in this deeply \nconservative, Christian country. Others die in childbirth, but cholera and diarrhoeal disease remain major killers. As \na result, half a million children in Malawi are orphans. /PA   In keeping with African custom, the orphans spend their \nnights in the village with their extended families or in households headed by children. But this is a poor village. \nThere is no spare food or clothing for orphans. Most are dressed in torn and ragged clothes, and there are certainly \nno shoes or toys. /PA   The Bright Vision orphanage was set up by village elders to make sure that the children can \nat least have two good meals a day. That means a back-breaking 200 litres of water must be collected from the well \nand carried back to the huts - a laborious task given that the tiny can has to be lowered into the well an endless \nnumber of times to fill 20-litre containers. The whole process takes about two hours. It is repeated for lunch. /PA   \nBut news of the Elephant Pump, cheap and more reliable than traditional African piston pumps, is spreading across \nMalawi. The outbreak of cholera in nearby Zimbabwe is a frightening reminder of what happens when pumps break \ndown. /PA   So when Stanley Chapota and Hosiah Malemba, founders of Bright Vision, heard that Pump Aid was \nlooking for demonstration sites, they jumped at the chance. /PA   When The Times arrives to see the newly installed \npump, the ancient open well has already been lined with new bricks and the cylindrical well-head is taking shape. \n/PA   Stanley and Hosiah hope that it will cut the time spent collecting water by more than half. The simple \nconstruction means that children will be able to help because all they need to do is turn the handles. /PA   Most \nimportantly, it means that the water supply is clean and fresh so diarrhoeal diseases will be eradicated. It takes just \nfour hours for the new pump to be installed by pump builders from Zimbabweand men from the village who get paid \nfor their labour. The villagers have also provided the bricks. /PA   The well will not be ready in time for today's lunch, \nso Fonida, Fatuma and Modesta, in charge of catering for the 300 orphans, come in early to draw enough water for \nthe children. /PA   They spend the morning making nsima, the staple meal of Malawi made of maize, in a huge \ncooking pot. Nsima needs to be \"paddled\", rather than stirred, to make a thick paste, and it is hot work in the \nmidday sun. A vat of boiling water is then moved on to the fire and the beans prepared. /PA   The children, who \nhave spent much of the morning crowded around the partially constructed well, gather in the classroom for singing \nbefore lunch. They then file out by age in groups of 10 or 12, queueing patiently to have their hands washed by the \nvillage women, then queueing again for food. /PA   The first hundred children are served lunch and a drink from the \nsame bowl. The orphanage cannot afford separate cups for drinksand has only enough dishes for 100 children, so \nthey are all washed before the next group of children arrive for lunch. /PA   \"You have no idea what a difference this \npump will make,\" says Modesta Banda, as she helps to wash the hands of Daniel, aged 4. \"It will be so much \neasier to draw, but the most important thing is that we know it's clean.\" /PA   She plans to plant tomatoes and \ncabbages by the pump overflow to add variety to the children's food. \"We have already said we want the Elephant \ntoilet too,\" she says. /PA   While Pump Aid is using expert pump builders from Zimbabwe to get the project going in \nMalawi, local men and women will be trained to do the task as soon as funds allow. /PA   \"It is very important for us \nto empower the community by training them to build the pumps and maintain them,\" says Elizabeth Maneya, Pump \nAid's acting director in Malawi. \"We do not have funding in place for that yet so we can only use locals on a casual \nbasis, but we hope to start proper training when we raise the money.\" /PA   Pump Aid is one of three charities being \n\n\n\nsupported by The Times this year.

But when they make serious misjudgments people can \nget killed. So it is not surprising that profound errors in the initial investigation into the murder of Rachel Nickell, who \n\n\n\nwas stabbed on Wimbledon Common in June 1992, have been sending shock waves through the system since it \nwas realised that the prime suspect, Colin Stagg, was innocent. The impact of this debacle will resound for many \nyears now that Robert Napper has admitted the killing. /PA   In almost all big police investigations of which I have \nexperience, a likely suspect emerges who turns out to have had nothing to do with the crime. Every now and then \nthe senior investigating officer, like Detective Inspector Keith Pedder in the Nickell murder inquiry, is seduced by \nwhat psychologists call a \"confirmation bias\". All the indicators that Mr Stagg was innocent were reinterpreted to \npoint to his guilt. /PA   Mr Pedder was so convinced that Mr Stagg was the murderer that he was determined to get \nevidence to convict him. This might have gone no farther had he not formed an alliance with Paul Britton, an \noffender profiler, who confidently promised that he could guide an undercover honeytrap that would lead to Mr \nStagg confessing or revealing enough for a conviction. /PA   The police tend to see expert advice as mainly an \nopportunity to obtain a conviction of someone already in their sights in the absence of other evidence. The first time \nI spoke to the police about the possibilities of scientific psychological contributions to investigations, more than 25 \nyears ago, the first question was: \"How soon can we use this in court?\" Detectives are often frustrated by the \nconviction that they know the villain's identity but do not have evidence to bring him to court. So scientific \ndiscoveries are raided for assistance, rather than being used more cautiously to build an objective account of what \nhappened; the science is rarely used to test or to disprove a hypothesis. /PA   Often the potential of science is \nsquandered before it is fully understood. This is particularly true of the \"softer sciences\", such as psychology. \nExamples run from forensic hypnosis, through the use of \"lie detectors\" and, in the case of Mr Stagg, the \nuninformed belief that someone calling himself a \"profiler\" could identify the fantasies of an unknown killer and set \nup a trap in which Mr Stagg would reveal them. /PA   I have seen internal memos from a senior police officer who \nheard of the honeytrap while it was in progress that said \"when a judge hears of this he will be spitting feathers\". \nWhat made this officer so prescient was that he had a doctorate in psychology and could recognise the \nweaknesses in what Mr Britton was claiming. When Mr Stagg was brought to court, Mr Justice Ognall expressed \nhimself rather more urbanely. He said that the investigation \"betrays not merely an excess of zeal but a substantial \nattempt to incriminate a suspect by positive and deceptive conduct of the grossest kind\". /PA   Detectives and the \nCrown Prosecution Service can be bowled over by the enthusiasm and arrogance of any expert, especially when \nthey provide answers that fit the suspect. If it is a new area of expertise of which detectives do not have even the \nmost elementary understanding, they are even more vulnerable. The serious mistakes made in the Yorkshire \nRipper inquiry in the 1980s had a significant impact on subsequent murder investigations. But one reason why the \nhoax taped messages were taken so seriously by detectives was that a phonetics expert could, with some validity, \nlocate the accent to a small geographical area. The apparent magic of this distracted from the fact that surviving \nvictims did not say that their attacker's accent was anything like that on the tape. /PA   The weakness of the Ripper \ninquiry is usually said to be that Peter Sutcliffe was present in police records in different places, but the system did \nnot allow them to recognise that. Napper, too, was on the list of potential suspects for Rachel Nickell's murder but \nwas not followed up because of the police obsession with Mr Stagg. /PA   After Sutcliffe's conviction, the need for a \nscientific perspective on large inquiries was identified in a wideranging review by Lawrence Byford, an inspector of \nconstabulary. One point he made was that complex investigations would benefit from a scientific perspective. He \nsuggested that a scientist be assigned to each inquiry, a role that came to be known as the \"Byford scientist\". /PA   \nBut police forces interpreted this as needing an officer to liaise with forensic scientists and for better computer \nsystems to store information. What was proposed as a change in thinking became just another piece of technology. \nSo it is not surprising that, 20 years later, Sir William Macpherson identified similar weaknesses in the Stephen \nLawrence inquiry. The police and CPS increasingly rely on scientific developments that they simply do not have the \nbasic training to understand. /PA   Any officer trained in psychology as a science would have known that inferring \nthe fantasies of an unknown killer was a fool's errand, but that it was reasonable to assume that the vicious killer of \na woman on an open common was probably known to police for previous violent or sexual crimes. With that basic \ntraining, detectives would not need to rely on an \"expert\" to help to shape a honeytrap, but would have made sure \nthat Napper was carefully interviewed before resources were focused on Mr Stagg. /PA   We still expect senior \npolice officers to be generalists, turning their hand to crowd control one day and murder inquiries the next. Their \nexpertise is seen as being police officers rather than in specialist knowledge of a particular field. /PA   In many \ncases this is valuable, as has been shown by the remarkable success in foiling terrorist attacks. /PA   But there are \ncases in which good old-fashioned policing is not enough. Officers need a proper academic grounding to use \neffectively the science that is available to them. In many forces around the world senior officers must have a degree \nand there are steps towards that in Britain. We could go farther. Why shouldn't thirty or fortysomethings who have \n\n\n\nenjoyed a career in science join the police at a senior level? The skills they have would be invaluable to modern \npolice investigations that are now so reliant on forensic science. /PA   We should not have to wait for another \ntragedy like the attempt to incriminate Colin Stagg before there are enough senior police officers well educated \nenough to recognise when a judge may \"spit feathers\". /PA   David Canter is Professor of Psychology at the \nUniversity of Liverpool and Director of the Centre for Investigative Psychology /PA   {   /S 897007680 /SO The \nTimes /PD 19 December 2008 /PG 37 /SCT Features /HD It's dramatic!

It is the monetary policy equivalent of Martin Luther's Ninety-Five Theses, the Gettysburg Address or the D-\nDay landings. And this week, the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, the most powerful financial institution on \nthe face of the planet, in characteristically understated fashion, decided to do it. /PA   If you doubted that we are \nliving in truly turbulent times, if you are one of those people out there who still thinks that this whole economic crisis \nbusiness has been overdone by the media, then the US central bank's action this week should lift the scales from \nyour eyes. /PA   Quantitative easing is, in essence, what you do as a central bank when you have run out of things \nto do to avert catastrophe. It is that moment in the horror movie when you are backed up into the kitchen by the \nintruder and you start pulling out the kitchen sink as your last weapon. /PA   This week, in an historic first, the Fed \ncut US market interest rates for overnight loans to zero, give or take a few hundredths of a percentage point. The \nreason, of course, is that the economic and financial crisis is getting worse. The US economy is plunging into its \ndeepest recession in 50 years or more, with a strong possibility that total output will contract in the current quarter at \nan annual rate of 7 per cent. Banks won't lend, customers won't borrow. /PA   But worse still is the possibility that \nthe economy might begin to suffer deflation, a period of generalised price declines. Deflation sometimes puzzles \npeople. Isn't it a good thing when prices fall? Can't we all afford to buy more things? Weren't we panicking six \nmonths ago that prices were rising too fast? /PA   The problem is that a general fall in the price level can be \ncatastrophic for a country for three main reasons. First, it encourages people to defer purchases. If you can get \nsomething cheaper in six months' time, you're going to wait. For an economy in or near a depression that is a \ndisaster. /PA   Second, it increases the real value of debt. If you have a $300,000 mortgage and prices - and wages \n- fall, that means the actual value of that debt in terms of your spending power is rising. /PA   Third, it reduces the \neffectiveness of monetary policy. You can't have negative interest rates (though there have been some very strange \nintimations of such in the past few weeks). As a general rule, people will not pay banks to hold their money; they'll \njust keep it in cash. So the central bank's usual tool for saving the world from recession - lower interest rates - is \nuseless when rates cannot go any lower. /PA   The last resort in these circumstances is quantitative easing. The \ncentral bank essentially prints money, unrelated to the level of interest in the economy. Specifically, what the Fed is \nproposing to do is to use the printed cash to buy up all sorts of long-term debt - mortgage securities and \ngovernment bonds. That will lower the interest rates on those assets (these are not the overnight interest rates \nalready set at zero, but longer-maturity rates). So mortgages and other loans will become cheaper, and money will \nslosh around the economy. /PA   At the same time the new administration of Barack Obama is going to spend a \nfortune on everything from roads to railways to computers and solar panels. This will not be paid for by taxes but by \nthe same printed money pouring out of the Fed. /PA   The result of all this, you will remember from those heady \ndays of the 1970s, should be inflation: usually a bad thing, but now, given the threat of deflation, a good thing, a \nnecessary corrective to the disastrous alternative. /PA   There are, of course, risks in this dramatic new move by the \nFed. With the US printing dollars willy-nilly, the value of the US dollar should decline. This could cause international \n\n\n\ninvestors to shun the currency, precipitating further disastrous falls in the value of US assets. /PA   It's also not \nnecessarily the case that higher inflation will get the US out of its near-depression. Japan is the only other leading \ncountry that has tried quantitative easing in the past 50 years. It's been at it for seven years and is still in a slump \n(though it has at least stopped deflation) The biggest risk is in storing up trouble for the future. When inflation gets \ngoing, the central bank will have to be very quick to reverse course: mop up all that excess money and push \ninterest rates much higher. That won't be a pleasant policy for an economy just starting to recover. But it's a \nproblem that the Fed would love to have right now. Not that those central bankers would put it quite that colourfully. \n/PA   {   /S 897007681 /SO The Times /PD 19 December 2008 /PG 38 /SCT Features /HD Reading between \nPresident Karzai's lines;Comment;Opinion /BY Anthony Loyd /TX /PA Behind the Afghan leader's stomach-churning \nplatitudes lies a history of mistrust and rancour /PA   Someone has been having a quiet word in Hamid Karzai's ear. \nTo judge by the schmaltzy, idiosyncrasy- strewn vernacular used by Afghanistan's President in his Christmas thank-\nyou letter to Britain, published in The Times on Monday, it was Borat. The cliched evocations of seasonal religious \nsymbolism, merged with gushing congratulation, were so unwittingly patronising that they could easily have been \nwritten by the fictional Kazakh TV journalist. /PA   But on closer inspection, after reading Mr Karzai's expressions of \ngratitude at how British soldiers die so readily in Helmand, his plea to remember that they do so to save us all from \nterrorist attack, and his warning that the situation could worsen without Britain's support, it becomes clear that \ndiplomatic advice lies behind the letter. /PA   Either a diplomat, or some other mollifying figure close enough to \npenetrate the opaque walls of Mr Karzai's court, has tactfully told the President that the British public, its Army and \ndiplomats have grown sick of his record of criticising their efforts while so many soldiers get blown up or shot in \nHelmand. /PA   Footage of the smiling President taken on any of his visits to the UK, togged out in his Karakul \nlambskin hat and Chapan cloak, suggest him to be a cheery Anglophile. In truth his relations with the British have \nseldom been more than strained and have dramatically soured recently. /PA   The rot began in 2006 when Britain \ndemanded that Mr Karzai replace the Governor of Helmand, Sher Mohammed Akhunzada, as a condition for \ndeploying troops there. The Governor and Mr Karzai had been old friends since they fought the Soviet occupation \ntogether. /PA   Alhough an influential and courageous warlord, Mr Akhunzada was accused by the British, among \nmany things, of being a drug lord. Mr Karzai reluctantly removed him and made him a senator. Mr Akhunzada has \nlobbied to be reinstated ever since and is regarded as central to the growing mistrust between Mr Karzai and the \nBritish. /PA   Acrimony worsened during 16 Air Assault Brigade's first tour of Helmand that year when Mr Karzai \nintervened directly with the tactical deployment of British troops in a series of telephone calls to annoyed senior \nBritish commanders that were described as \"hysterical\" by witnesses. /PA   A new low occurred in December 2007 \nwhen Mr Karzai expelled two diplomats, a British and Irish citizen, after denouncing them for funding the Taleban. \nCentral to a British project to facilitate the defection of Taleban fighters near Musa Qala, the pair were widely \nrespected throughout Afghanistan and were on a mission that had been cleared by the Afghan authorities. /PA   \nTheir expulsions poleaxed British efforts to reconcile biddable insurgents; diplomats privately accused Mr Karzai of \nhaving expelled the pair for no other reason than pique at his own lack of power in influencing events. (In a little-\nknown footnote to the story one of the Afghans working with the diplomats was thrown into a dungeon on Mr \nKarzai's orders.) In January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr Karzai ridiculed Britain's efforts in Helmand, \nclaiming that heeding its advice had made the situation there worse. \"Before (the British Forces arrived) we were \nfully in charge of Helmand... the British Forces guaranteed to me they knew what they were doing and I made the \nmistake of listening to them. And when they came in, the Taleban came.\" /PA   The British were furious. False \nrumours began to circulate among embassy staff that Mr Karzai was \"mentally ill\", and in a series of counterclaims \nWestern diplomats pointed out that most of Afghanistan's problems originated from the endemic incompetence of \nthe Karzai Government. /PA   That same month, Mr Karzai blocked Paddy Ashdown's nomination as super-envoy - \neven though it had been supported by the United Nations and the US State Department. That was interpreted by \ndiplomats as designed to limit Britain's influence in Afghanistan. /PA   So why the sudden expression of fawning \ngratitude? Has Mr Karzai forgotten that only two months ago, the French satirical magazine Le Canard Enchaine \nreported an alleged conversation in which Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, Britain's Ambassador to Kabul, called for a \ndictator to replace Mr Karzai if any hope for Afghanistan were to be salvaged. /PA   Sadly, Mr Karzai's Christmas \nletter is likely to reflect realpolitik rather than a genuine change of heart. /PA   With 134 British soldiers having been \nkilled in Afghanistan, and the war worsening, Mr Karzai's previous public rancour toward British policy in \nAfghanistan now threatens a serious erosion of public backing for the campaign. /PA   If you want - he has \ndoubtless been advised - to enjoy Britain's continued support in the run-up to next year's presidential elections in \nAfghanistan, if you want to carry on having billions of pounds of British taxpayers' money filtered through your \n\n\n\nGovernment, or hobnob with the Prince of Wales at Balmoral and have the Foreign Office and Commonwealth keep \nquiet as to how utterly useless it truly believes you are, then try to say something nice for once. /PA   The saddest \nreality of all is that this gut-churning missive will probably be all that it takes - for a while at least - to fulfil that aim. \nFor although there is no lack of antipathy on either side, both parties will be far happier to hide their discord and \nmaintain a charade of unity in the absence of any better clue where to take Afghanistan. /PA   So happy Christmas, \nMr President.

It might be giving financial advice to a charity, walking dogs, mentoring young offenders, \ngardening for the elderly. People could choose; but they must make a commitment. /PA   Everyone, from those on \ninvalidity benefit to, er, the Archbishop, would have to participate. There could be none of this carbon-offset \nnonsense for the rich, no exemptions, no excuses. This would be National Service meets jury service, with harsh \npunishment - months of community service, or raised taxes - for those who try to avoid it. AmeriCorps on \ntestosterone. /PA   Vital to its success would be forcing employers to facilitate it. We would require legislation to \nring-fence those 12 days off - maybe on half-pay - to work for others. Radical, but simple. /PA   Compulsory \nvolunteering is win-win and a recession is a perfect time for it. Lots of new jobs administering it; much-needed \ncohesion for society; and the chance - the first for many - to experience the heady glow of a reward that is not \nmoney.

Everybody living in poverty in \nretirement might be democratic and fair but it is not a sensible policy for a country with an ageing population and an \nalleged commitment to enabling pensioners to live with dignity. The truth is that we all pay for everyone else's \npension. The price of goods and services includes an element that goes towards the pension savings of everyone \ninvolved in the manufacture and sale of that item - public services are no different. The real question is why is the \ntaxpayer paying for inadequate occupational pension provision in the private sector? /PA   In local government the \nmembers of this scheme include those providing care services for the elderly. If those intent on abolishing any \ngood-quality pension scheme in the country get their way, the additional pressure on these services will be \noverwhelming. /PA   Poor-quality pensions mean more poverty in retirement. Poverty doesn't just affect the \npensioner forced to choose between heating and eating, it affects everyone. These services are all funded by the \ntaxpayer and the increased demand for these and for state benefits will cost the taxpayer dear. Wouldn't it be better \nto ensure that everyone had a good-quality pension scheme and a chance of self-sufficiency and security in \nretirement rather than a one-way ticket to penury? Worsening public sector pensions won't achieve this; improving \nprivate sector schemes would. /PA   NAOMI COOKE National Pensions Officer, GMB union /PA   {   /S 897007687 \n/SO The Times /PD 19 December 2008 /PG 39 /SCT Features /HD Public sector pensions are hardly gold-\nplated;Letter /BY   /TX /PA Sir, The NHS has a pension scheme to which employees and employers contribute. \nAfter 40 years of service an employee who has paid into the superannuation scheme is entitled to a full pension.

When I started nurse training, at age 18, we earned \nvery little (Pounds 9 a month) and yet still had superannuation deducted from our salary; it was a compulsory \nscheme.

It then charged the RN with blockading the port of Beira to oil tankers. This \ndramatic commitment to enforce sanctions began in early 1966 with the high-profile use of the carriers HMS Eagle \nand Ark Royal. Their airborne early-warning squadrons flew thousands of sorties over vast areas to compile the \nwidest surface picture and to locate and identify tankers heading for Beira. Fixed-wing jets also took part. \nDestroyers and frigates patrolled two lines offshore and thus was born \"the Beira patrol\". /PA   The message \nregarding maritime air power was the same then as it is now. First, both carriers were at sea for periods comparable \nwith Pacific carrier operations in 1944 - 45 being replenished under way by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.

These formed on a tropical beach 55 \nmillion years ago: Hertfordshire-by-the-Sea. /PA   Above the field stands a copse. The farmer has not sought to \nbring it under the plough, and there is a good reason. The wood is pitted with Roman and Stone Age excavations. \nOur ancestors quarried hard patches of the beachrock, cemented by silica, at a time of exceptional global warming \n55 million years ago. The Hertfordshire puddingstone was used to grind corn. /PA   Grinding corn with puddingstone \nquerns was more important to the survival in that area of our Stone Age and Roman ancestors than oil is to us \ntoday. You have to eat: you don't really have to consume hydrocarbons by driving up the A10 and flying from \nStansted to Lanzarote - although that can be fun in the right company. /PA   The former head of Opec, Sheikh \nYamani, once said that the Stone Age did not end because they ran out of rock, and there is indeed unshaped \npuddingstone to be found. The Stone Age ended because people with brains as good as ours developed new \ntechnology and adapted to it. /PA   We shall never know their names, but those of our present-day leaders who \nhave the conviction and courage to act on the message written in those 55 million year-old rocks will never be \nforgotten. /PA   What is that message? While the flint pebbles were being rounded on the hot shores of \nHertfordshire, an episode of dramatic global climate change was being recorded in deep-sea sediments on the \nocean floor. We can now read that record 55 million years later, using the recently established division of that part \nof the geological timescale into thousands rather than millions of years. This brings the story on to a human \ntimescale: we are thereby led to some uncomfortable and implacable conclusions about our current use of the \nplanet. /PA   It is commonly said that our present-day release of carbon into the Earth's atmosphere is an \nuncontrolled experiment with an unknown outcome. That is not really true. Fifty-five million years ago there was a \nrelease of fossil carbon comparable with that on which we have now embarked. This was long before we were \naround to light so much as a camp fire - so we didn't do it, but now we know about it. Although we cannot predict \nwith complete confidence the outcome of our own experiment, the main effects of the 55 million-year release of \nfossil carbon provide hefty clues to what is likely to happen. This observational science requires no computer- \ngenerated models to carry conviction. /PA   Earth became a lot warmer 55million years ago. Even on the deep \nocean floor, temperatures increased by several degrees centigrade. The boundary between the Palaeocene and \nEocene epochs is defined by the resulting extinctions in the fossil record. /PA   Warming of the oceans caused their \nadvance on the land, and they became notably more acidic and received large volumes of carbon as the released \ngases were recycled. It was well over 100,000 years before the planet returned to something approaching its \nprevious state. /PA   The trigger for the 55-million-year- old event remains a matter of active research. Nonetheless \nwe know enough to assert that the whole episode may plausibly be regarded as an earlier and complete version of \nour own present day dumping of CO2 into the atmosphere. A global event that is a threat to the survival of a highly \nspecialised species such as Homo sapiens is not something we would wish to provoke through our own agency. \n/PA   The oil industry is widely perceived to be a significant part of the problem. The rapture of those who \ndiscovered, and recovered, the spectacular wealth from the North Sea must now be tempered by the realisation \nthat they are responsible for starting a piece of unfinished business with the Earth's carbon cycle. Petroleum \ngeologists and engineers may not feel particularly in need of redemption, despite the obloquy dished out by many \nenvironmentalists. But if they are abashed, help lies close at hand, in their very own reservoirs - and elsewhere \nunderground. /PA   We can put the fossil carbon back - at a price. As well as considering the future price of a barrel \nof oil, the prospective value of a tonne of carbon put safely back underground becomes crucial. At least some of the \n\n\n\ntechnical and commercial skills required to produce oil and gas are comparable with those needed to inject and \nstore CO2. /PA   We do not have the luxury of choosing between consuming less fossil fuel on the one hand, or \ncarbon capture and storage on the other. We need to do lots of both, to have any hope of holding the level of \ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere at (say) 550 parts per million (ppm) by the middle of this century. At present oil \nproduction stands at about 80 million barrels a day. Depending on how much you compress the CO2 before \ninjecting it, you could achieve some 20 per cent of that 550ppm target by pumping 80 million barrels of CO2 \nunderground each day. /PA   Those of us who buy the oil industry's most useful product do so to feed the engines \nof aircraft, ships and cars - which do not lend themselves to easy CO2 capture. However, capturing fossil carbon at \ncoal-fired power stations is simpler. The storage of their CO2 probably provides the best prospect for using the oil \nindustry's skills to help to meet our stringent targets. /PA   And why should the oil industry not seize this opportunity \nto develop existing technology? True, pumping waste into long-term storage is not what we veteran frontier \nexplorers are used to, with our techno-gambler culture of high risk and high reward. This would be a future service \nindustry, with a price per tonne for all the carbon safely stored. The dull psalm of duty would appear to replace the \ntrill of pleasure - but that is to set the technical challenges too low. The geology and engineering involved are \ninteresting enough to quicken the blood of skilled young people. The task could be tackled properly between now \nand 2050, with every prospect of technical and commercial opportunity for the UK. /PA   One thing is missing, \nwhich only the most determined action by our leaders can provide. That is the establishment of policy and \nregulation that puts an appropriate and fungible value on a tonne of carbon. Simply that: there need be no officious \ndictation of choices of action within such a global framework. This is one area where the market really can do its \nwork. /PA   Which of our leaders will have the guts to establish restraint in per-capita output of carbon as a social \ngood, on a par with the provision of health services and education? Could it be a combination of President Obama \nand Prime Minister Brown, working with China, India and others? We have received an important 55 million-year-\nold message from a warm planet.

Water pipits in winter are conspicuously white underneath, and have a \npale eyestripe, whereas rock pipits are dark and spotty. Rock pipits are also birds of coastal cliffs, or promenades in \nseaside towns, while the wintering water pipits stay mainly inland. In summer water pipits are found remarkably far \nfrom water, on mountainsides in such places as the Tyrol. In summer too they have pale, pink-flushed breasts, quite \nunlike the streaky breasts of other pipits.

All three were given life sentences. /PA   The \nthree organised, armed and trained the notorious Interahamwe militia, which carried out much of the slaughter. \nMost of the killings took place with machetes and thick wooden sticks covered with nails. /PA   The court found \nBagosora guilty of chairing a committee that drew up lists of those to be massacred, rejecting his defence that the \nkillings were not organised and therefore not genocide. It ruled that he planned the murders as early as 1990 and \nhad drafted a paper circulated within the army describing Tutsis as \"the principal enemy\". /PA   He later stormed out \nof peace talks, accusing government delegates of being too soft on Tutsi-led rebels and said that he was returning \nto Kigali to \"prepare the apocalypse\". /PA   Bagosora's lawyer said that his client would appeal against the verdict. \nA fourth man, Brigadier Gratien Kabiligi, the former head of military operations, was cleared and ordered to be \nreleased from custody immediately. /PA   Rwanda, which has had a fraught relationship with the UN court, \nimmediately welcomed the verdict. \"Justice has been delivered.

The \ncourt ruled that Bagosora had the authority over the killers.

Cases had to be prepared in several languages. Proceedings were painfully \nslow and the court was attacked frequently for its inefficiency, cost and even corruption. Defence lawyers went on \nstrike complaining that their salaries were much lower than those of internationally appointed prosecutors. /PA   \nBecause this is a United Nations court, the accused are housed in a specially built prison under international \nstandards. That means, with three meals a day and access to proper healthcare, they are much better treated and \ncared for than many of their victims, who eke out an existence in impoverished Rwandan villages. /PA   HIV-positive \ndetainees receive proper treatment in sharp contrast to those whom they infected.

In a statement slipped out quietly to \nan otherwise distracted Parliament, the Department for International Development said that the Treasury could not \nfund the project. \"As a result, there will be a pause in negotiations over the St Helena airport contract,\" Douglas \nAlexander, the Secretary of State for International Development, wrote. The longed-for airport had fallen victim to \nthe credit crunch. /PA   With a per-capita income of only Pounds 4,500, St Helena depends on the British taxpayer \nfor Pounds 17 million a year for its survival. The one-off investment in the airport could have reversed all that, the \nislanders insist. /PA   On the wild, windy and beautiful shores of St Helena a revolution is brewing. Whether this is a \nhiccough or a permanent end to the project nobody knows. The councillors of the island wrote to Mr Alexander of \ntheir \"bitter disappointment from the repeated raising of expectation that have subsequently been dashed\". /PA   \nThey added: \"Our electorate of Saints is renowned for loyalty to Britain, but if this current statement is hiding an \nindefinite delay in an airport, then we are certain there will be a very negative backlash.\" /PA   But how? Marching \non Downing Street is barely an option. The journey to London takes two weeks by ship, or one to Cape Town from \nwhere they could fly. The lifeline of the island is the ageing RMS St Helena, the last working Royal Mail ship, which \nsails twice yearly from Portland. /PA   Storms can cut the island off and when the ship does reach it, motor launches \nare needed to bring people and supplies to shore. The few cruise ships that visit bring little economic benefit to the \nisland. They cannot moor there so passengers spend little time on shore. /PA   The airport was meant to change all \nthat. The project, which was scheduled for 2012, galvanised islanders to plan for a future with tourism as their main \nincome. Industry experts trained hospitality personnel; tenders were taken to build upmarket boutique \naccommodation. Plans were hatched to lure back hundreds of young islanders who had left St Helena in search of \nopportunity. /PA   \"All our plans for the future were based on the airport project,\" Eric Benjamin, one of the \ncouncillors, told The Times by telephone. \"We are devastated.\" /PA   Before the island came under Crown control in \n1834, as many as 100 ships a week called at it.

It needs it for its own people. That is a measure of how the plunge in oil prices from $140 a \nbarrel to $40 is hurting the world's fourth-largest oil exporter. /PA   Is this the shock that might nudge Iran's leaders \nto think again about their nuclear ambitions? To be blunt, probably not. Nothing so far has made them budge from \nthe goal of enriching uranium in a way that would put a nuclear weapon within reach. /PA   All the same, the sharp \nfall in the oil price, coming at a crucial stage in Iran's nuclear work, does strengthen diplomatic efforts to dissuade \nthe Tehran Government. It may even topple that Government. Those who have been trying - and failing - to \npersuade Iran to change direction now wonder whether the sudden shock of plunging national income might \npersuade Iranians to pick a new president in the June elections. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's promise to put oil money \non the tables of Iran's poorest people - a slogan that people were delighted to interpret entirely literally - won him \nthe presidency in a shock result in August 2005. But by last summer, many were grumbling that he had failed. Now, \nthe oil money has run short as well. /PA   Last week the President acknowledged for the first time, through the \nofficial IRNA news agency, that the Government will have to cut spending and subsidies for food and fuel, as well \nas raise taxes. He added that the budget would have to cope with oil at between $30 and $35 a barrel. Analysts \nreckon the budget last year was based on oil at about $90 and even this year a balanced budget appeared to \nrequire oil at around $60 a barrel. A new president in Iran - as well as one in the US - would allow a new attempt to \nsee whether Iran is open to a deal. The best that can be said of the incoherent and constantly changing mix of \n\n\n\nsanctions, vague military threats and trade inducements that the US and Europe have lobbed at Tehran for six \nyears is that they have left the Iranian leadership unclear about what those countries are prepared to do to stop the \nnuclear work and so, arguably, more cautious. /PA   Barack Obama tied himself in knots early in his campaign \nabout whether he would talk to Iran. His first answer - broadly, yes - was his best. For the US not to have relations \nof any sort with Iran is self-defeating. /PA   One of the least productive reflexes of US foreign policy has been to \nregard the granting of contact with American officials as a prize in itself, not a means to an end.

Much of the current analysis of how to deal with Iran's nuclear work (such as an excellent \nreport by Mark Fitzpatrick, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London) focuses on how to persuade \nit not to make enriched uranium into a bomb.

The corridors of parliament are thick with rumours of \nparty rebellions, breakaway factions and of a fundamental realignment of Japanese politics: few believe that Mr Aso \nhas the skills, strategy or support to navigate his party through the next few months intact. /PA   While Mr Aso, a \ndivisive nationalist, has scrambled ever closer to the pinnacle of Japanese power, he has played down or ignored \nawkward questions about the murky history of the company that his father, Takakichi, ran during the war. Although \nthe allegations of slave labour have been a constant thorn in the side of Mr Aso in recent years, a supposed lack of \nhard evidence has allowed him to limit the damage to his reputation. /PA   Before taking over as leader in \nSeptember, Mr Aso was challenged directly over the history of the family business. Once again he refused to \nconfirm any details about the business, whose offshoot, Aso Cement, he ran in the 1970s. \"I was only five years old \nwhen the war ended, and have no memory of that time,\" he said. /PA   The refusal to acknowledge that side of the \nAso company history has become more controversial as more evidence has emerged to confirm the allegations. \nDocuments from the United States National Archive, submitted by the Aso Mining company to the Supreme \nCommander for the Allied Forces in 1946, include a letter from the head of the company's Yoshikuma Coal Mine in \nFukuoka to General Gen Sugiyama, the Minister of War. The letter, dated February 22, 1945, politely requests \npermission to use 300 prisoners in the mines to undertake 12-hour working days for a year. /PA   The typed \ndocument, produced on company paper, asserts that the prisoners of war were suitably fed and clothed and treated \ndecently. Survivors of the ordeal have given very different versions of 15-hour days of forced labour in primitive \nconditions, with remorseless and exhausting work, starvation and beatings. /PA   Arthur Titherington, of the \nJapanese Labour Camp Survivors' Association, told The Times that he was aware of the use of prisoners of war in \nthe coalmine. \"I was also forced to work in a mine as part of Japan's slave labour programme, although not the \ncoalmine linked to the present Japanese Prime Minister. I had to work in a copper mine in Taiwan and I'm sure we \nwere all treated in the same way, which was very badly,\" he said. /PA   The report was not accepted by the \nJapanese Government as absolute proof of the allegations, leading to a quest by opposition MPs for any shred of \nmaterial archived in Japan that might authenticate the documents discovered in Washington. That quest ended in a \nstoreroom yards below the political heart of Tokyo with the discovery of a 43-page record. It detailed how Allied \nprisoners of war were deployed throughout a network of camps used to service the mines.

Its Tier 1 capital ratio at the end \nof September was a meaty 8.9 per cent - at the top of its target range of 7.5 to 9 per cent. Its core Tier 1 capital was \n7.9 per cent - still higher than several of its rivals. /PA   In normal times, being too strongly capitalised is folly. \nExisting shareholders can be diluted by unnecessary rights issues and the balance sheet inefficiently run. But there \nare times when a balance sheet simply cannot be too bomb-proof. With every fresh writedown and lending boob, a \nbank's capital cushion is eroded and HSBC is no exception. Only this week it waved goodbye to a probable $1 \nbillion after lending to investors in Bernie Madoff's fairytale hedge fund. With a large chunk of its assets in the \nnations worst hit by the housing downturn and credit crunch, Britain and America, HSBC is now finding that its \nAsian roots are no protection against shareholder anxiety. /PA   HSBC had seemed immune to the sell-off afflicting \nrival banks. But the past few days have seen its shares under pressure, down another 463/4p to 6251/4p yesterday. \nThey are now approaching a low last plumbed in 1999. The shares now yield close to 10 per cent - this at a \ncompany that can't remember the last time the dividend was cut. But the market now says that the payout will \nprobably have to be cut. For the HSBC board, this is a tough call. /PA   There is no longer much disgrace in \nsuccumbing. Even Standard Chartered, the darling of the UK banks, opted for it, yesterday reporting a 97 per cent \ntake up for its $2.7 billion capital top-up. /PA   Nobody knows how bad the global economy could get.

Is it more talks with Iberia, or a resumption of \nthe endless legal wrangle over anti-trust clearance for an American affair? /PA   Rumour has it that the BA board \nleft a message with Mr Walsh: do a deal, any deal. BA's failure to find a partner is becoming embarrassing. For \nyears, the British carrier said it wanted to be at the heart of airline consolidation. There were three attempts to get \nhitched with KLM but BA gave up in 2000, complaining that it couldn't agree a merger structure with the Dutch. Four \nyears later, Air France did the job and in the meantime Lufthansa has gobbled up every spare carrier in the room. \nSoftly, softly, Lufthansa is building a dominant market position in the heart of Europe. It has won Swiss and over the \npast year has announced plans to get control of British Midland, Austrian Airlines and Brussels Airlines. /PA   Of \ncourse, BA in the past talked to Swiss and it talked to Alitalia (Air France looks like it might do a deal with a \nresurrected version of the Italian carrier) but nothing came of it. /PA   Willie's loyal mates are quick to point out that \nit was Qantas that first made eyes at BA, not the other way round. But it seems that Alan Joyce, the new Qantas \nchief, is less enamoured with BA than his predecessor Geoff Dixon, who started the talks in August. And then there \nis small matter of BA's Pounds 1.7billion pension fund deficit, which is a turn-off for any suitor. /PA   BA was \nyesterday blaming Australian nationalism for the collapse of the talks. The companies were orginally talking about a \n50-50 deal but the leaking of the discussions provoked a media and political outcry at the idea that Australia might \nlose majority control of its national flag carrier. /PA   Qantas then started demanding a majority stake and a \nheadquarters in Sydney. Of course, some bright spark may have leaked the talks to put pressure on BA to \ncompromise rather than face being jilted again. But BA braced itself for the inevitable snickering and said no. /PA   \nThe truth is that BA stood to gain much more from this deal than Qantas, notably access to Asia. If there is to be \nany traffic growth over the next five years, it will be there, not America. /PA   The end of the Qantas talks makes it \nmore likely that BA will now do a deal with Iberia, which would offer more potential cost savings. But the talks have \nbeen grinding on for months. If the Spanish walk away Mr Walsh will be under intense pressure to find something \nelse. /PA   Aer Lingus is spoken for but what about Icelandair?

This was despite the fact that, as of Wednesday night, the \nmarket capitalisations of the two airlines were almost identical. /PA   Qantas had argued that, despite BA's \nrevenues being larger than its own, its shareholders deserved a larger slice because of the size of BA's pension \ndeficit. The Australian airline was also uneasy, as The Times reported last week, about BA's planned merger with \nIberia, the Spanish carrier. /PA   Iberia declined to comment on the breakdown of the negotiations, but it is \nunderstood that executives of the Spanish airline were pleased by the surprise development.

Suzy Jagger and Christine Seib report /PA   Barack Obama launched a withering attack on American \nfinancial regulators yesterday for being \"asleep at the switch\" as he laid the blame for the credit crisis and the \nworld's biggest scam at their door. /PA   The US President-elect said that the Bernard Madoff scandal, which is \nbelieved to have triggered losses of about $50billion (Pounds 33billion), has \"reminded us yet again of how badly \n(regulatory) reform is needed\". /PA   As Mr Obama fleshed out his financial team, he indicated that both Wall Street \nregulators and congressional committees had failed the American people, who were frustrated that \"there's not a lot \nof adult supervision out there\". /PA   Mr Obama's comments constitute the latest attack on the US Securities and \nExchange Commission (SEC), which allowed what appears to be the biggest fraud in history to take place under its \nnose. Last week, Mr Madoff, a New York financier, apparently confessed to his sons that he had created a vast \nPonzi scheme. /PA   The subsequent liquidation of his businesses has left banks, pension funds, charities and \nprivate investors nursing billions of dollars of losses and has triggered a witch-hunt at the SEC. /PA   As Mr Madoff \nspent his first day in Manhattan under virtual house arrest and wearing a security tag on his ankle after being \ncharged with securities fraud, a string of new allegations emerged against both the financier and the SEC. /PA   In \ndocuments written by Harry Markopolos, a derivatives expert who formerly worked for a fund that rivalled that of Mr \nMadoff and who has spent ten years urging the SEC to investigate Mr Madoff, the bust investor is accused of using \nthe names of UBS and Merrill Lynch, the investment banks, to lend credibility to his schemes. /PA   According to the \ndocuments, which were written in November 2005, Mr Madoff is alleged to have told potential investors that all of \nhis options trading business was channelled through UBS and Merrill. However, Mr Markopolos asserted: \"The \ncounter-party credit exposures for UBS and Merrill would be too large for these firms' credit departments to \napprove. The SEC should ask BM for trade tickets showing he has traded OTC options thru (sic) these two firms.\" \n/PA   It is understood that neither UBS nor Merrill Lynch has any material exposure to Mr Madoff's businesses and \nalso that neither had had a sufficiently substantial relationship with Mr Madoff to have conducted these types of \ntrades. Such a discrepancy raises serious questions about the truthfulness of Mr Madoff's sales pitch to new \ninvestors, such as hedge funds, and also whether Mr Madoff sought to exploit the long-standing reputations of UBS \nand Merrill Lynch to legitimise his own operations. /PA   Ira Lee Sorkin, a lawyer representing Mr Madoff, did not \nreturn calls yesterday. /PA   It also emerged yesterday that the SEC was within a whisker of uncovering Mr Madoff's \nalleged Ponzi scheme when it discovered in 2006 that the financier had misled the regulator about how he \nmanaged customer money. The SEC had recommended that Mr Madoff instead register with the agency as an \ninvestment adviser. /PA   This week Christopher Cox, the SEC chairman, acknowledged that the regulator had \nfailed to follow up numerous and specific tip-offs about the way that Mr Madoff was running his businesses. /PA   \nBoth the SEC and the FBI have begun inquiries into Mr Madoff's funds as they scramble to construct a legal case to \nsecure a criminal conviction against the financier.

Ms Schapiro, at present the chief executive of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority \n(Finra), employed Mark Madoff in 2001 to serve on the board of the National Adjudicatory Council, which reviews \ndisciplinary decisions made by Finra. /PA   Mark Madoff and his brother, Andrew, were understood to have \napproached the authorities last week after their father apparently confessed to orchestrating a $50billion securities \nfraud. /PA   Although both sons have denied any involvement in the alleged scam, the development comes at a \nsensitive time for the SEC, which is under fire for failing to spot such a colossal fraud, despite tip-offs over ten \nyears. /PA   Pending confirmation by the Senate, Ms Schapiro, 53, will next month replace Christopher Cox, who is \nscrambling to construct a case against Bernard Madoff and to launch an inquiry into why the regulator failed to spot \nsuch a huge scheme. /PA   The appointment of Ms Schapiro has triggered speculation that a merger of the SEC \nand the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the commodities regulator, which she led during the \n\n\n\nClinton Administration, is being considered. She will be under intense pressure to help to rewrite the Wall Street \nrule book, which, by and large, is 70 years old. New rules are expected to address sensitive issues, such as short-\nselling and and the scrutiny of hedge funds. /PA   Since the eruption of the credit crisis 18 months ago and the \ncollapse of Lehman Brothers in September, Washington has been aghast at how useless much of the Wall Street \nregulatory structure has proved to be. Mortgage lenders have been allowed to extend loans to borrowers who were \nunlikely to be able to repay them and unregulated markets, such as the credit default swaps industry, have \nballooned without oversight. /PA   An SEC-CFTC merger would bring under one roof all American regulation for \ncapital markets, such as shares and bonds trading, and commodities markets, such as oil trading. It would make Ms \nSchapiro one of the most powerful financial regulators in Washington since the SEC was created in 1934 by \nFranklin Roosevelt to inject confidence into stock markets. /PA   In a speech in October last year, Ms Schapiro said: \n\"Investors can understand and accept a tech bubble or a recession - they go with the territory of a free market. \nWhat they won't accept is a system they can't trust. That's why it's so important for all of us to work together to \nsafeguard that sense of trust and foster confidence among investors. /PA   \"There's no question the future can be \nintimidating, but as a famous scientist once said: 'The best way to predict the future is to invent it.' Right now we \nhave an unprecedented opportunity to invent the most effective and efficient regulatory approach, one that will \nbetter protect investors and allow you to do what you do best - help investors to realise their dreams and give them \nthe tools to invent their own financial futures.\" /PA   Ms Schapiro may prove to be a canny appointment by Mr \nObama. Having trained as a lawyer, she worked as an attorney within the futures industry and helped to write \ngovernment policy and regulations on the derivatives market in the wake of the 1987 stock market crash. /PA   With \na deep understanding of both financial futures and the commodities markets, she is well placed to merge the SEC \nand the CFTC to streamline regulations in those sectors. /PA   Last year Congress granted the SEC an annual \nbudget of $906million, and the regulator had a full-time workforce of 3,500. /PA   GOING INTO THE \nADMINISTRATION /PA   Barack Obama yesterday named Gary Gensler, a veteran banker and regulator, as \nchairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the organisation that oversees trades worth \n$5,000 billion. /PA   The CFTC found itself in the spotlight during the summer when oil and agricultural commodity \nprices hit record highs, pushing up the cost of petrol and food. Some Democratic politicians criticised the agency for \nfailing to prevent excessive speculation in its market. /PA   Mr Gensler spent 18 years at Goldman Sachs before \njoining the Clinton Administration, where he served as Assistant Treasury Secretary, focusing on financial markets. \nHe later acted as a senior adviser on the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the controversial corporate governance legislation \nintroduced after the Enron and WorldCom scandals, and advised on Hillary Clinton's campaign to become the \nDemocratic presidential candidate. /PA   The new commission chairman joins the hand-picked team that will \nsurround the President-elect.

When they hauled Sanyo back from the precipice of failure \ntwo years ago, they were left with preferred shares that, when converted into ordinary shares, would represent a \ncombined 70percent stake in Sanyo. /PA   Just a fortnight ago, when it appeared that Sumitomo Mitsui and Daiwa \nSecurities were prepared to accept Panasonic's raised offer of Y130 a share, Goldman Sachs left the negotiating \ntable, slamming Panasonic's offer as \"unfair\" on shareholders. /PA   Those objections now appear to have \nevaporated in the face of the offer of Y131 a share tabled by Panasonic on Wednesday, an offer that was accepted \n\n\n\nwithin days of Goldman Sachs announcing its first quarterly loss, of more than $2billion (Pounds 1.32billion), since \ngoing public nine years ago. /PA   Goldman Sachs's original 2006 investment in the Sanyo bailout deal was worth \nabout Y125billion. Under the revised terms, Panasonic will pay Y234billion for that stake. /PA   Although, during \nnegotiations, the Wall Street bank did not publicly specify an offer price that it thought might represent fair value for \nSanyo, sources close to the discussions said that Goldman Sachs may have entertained visions of squeezing about \nY170 a share from Panasonic. /PA   The new offer is below Sanyo's current market price and the decision to accept \nit at those levels hints at Goldman Sachs's weakening hand at the negotiating table as Sanyo's growth prospects \ndiminish in the slump. /PA   The timing and suddenness of Goldman's capitulation also highlights the severe \ndeterioration in Japanese export strength and the financial damage that electronics companies are suffering from \nthe soaring yen, Tokyo brokers said. /PA   With only slim prospects of the yen going back to its former levels in the \nnear future, many Japanese exporters have begun issuing dire warnings of losses in the first half of next year. /PA   \nPanasonic is one of a number of groups forced to issue a profit warning as US, European and Asian consumers \nlose their appetite for white goods, widescreen TVs and gadgetry. /PA   {   /S 897007788 /SO The Times /PD 19 \nDecember 2008 /PG 69 /SCT Business /HD The Japanese Government is planning to resurrect one of the most \nawesome weapons in its financial arsenal /BY Leo Lewis /TX /PA The Japanese Government is planning to \nresurrect one of the most awesome weapons in its financial arsenal - a state-backed share-buying machine with a \nY20trillion budget (Leo Lewis writes). /PA   It could rumble into action early next year to \"stabilise\" falling markets by \nbuying the worst-hit stocks held in the portfolios of Japan's biggest banks. /PA   The gambit has been tried before - \nit was known as the Banks' Shareholdings Acquisition Corporation (BSAC) - but never on anything approaching the \nscale now proposed.

Much of the crisis arose from the huge portfolios of stocks held by \nJapan's major banks, which meant that every time the market fell, the capital adequacy ratios of the banks were \nbadly dented. /PA   {   /S 897007789 /SO The Times /PD 19 December 2008 /PG 69 /SCT Business /HD Sign of \ngrowing relationship as Apple takes Pounds 3m stake in Imagination /BY Dan Sabbagh /TX /PA Shares in \nImagination Technologies (IMG) soared yesterday after Apple reported that it had taken a 3.6percent stake in the \nHertfordshire-based digital radio maker. /PA   The shares rose 28percent to 50p in the minutes after it emerged that \nApple had picked up 8.2million shares for about Pounds 3million.

Johnston Press has already tapped investors for \ncash, while, in America, Sam Zell's ridiculously over-leveraged Tribune Group is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy \n\n\n\nprotection. /PA   It is easy to make all sorts of assertions - a few numbers, though, might help to explain how tough \nit might become. /PA   There are three parts to the newspaper revenue model: readers, advertisers and the digital \nbit. For upmarket titles, such as, The Times, The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph, something over half of \nrevenue comes from advertising. For tabloids, a similar level of revenue comes from the cover price. /PA   Cover \nprices are rising and circulations are falling; add it all up, and the expectation is that revenue from copy sales will be \nroughly unchanged. /PA   In a way, this makes amateur forecasting easy: take the advertising revenue forecast for \n2009 and halve it to find the total impact on a title's turnover. The hard part is working out how bad 2009 will be. \nPublishers generally talk about a fall in advertising of about 15 per cent (although the past fortnight has been \nbetter), roughly the level of decline since the summer - although, helped by retailers' spending, The Sun, at least, \nseems to be doing better. /PA   Digital, meanwhile, is not big enough to compensate to any great extent. \nNewspaper owners do not release digital advertising figures, but those who are doing well with digital, are likely to \nreceive about 7 to 8 per cent of total revenues, meaning that print advertising is more than 40 per cent. Translate \nthat into a figure and it might be Pounds 20 million per title; increasing that by 25 per cent to Pounds 25million does \nnot offset a big fall in print advertising revenues of five times that size. More generally, companies hoping for lots of \ndigital advertising revenue have usually been over-optimistic - with the exception of the global winners. Google \nalone is forecast to take 55percent of the Pounds 2.9 billion online advertising market in the UK, leaving everyone \nelse to fight over what's left. /PA   As for trading, that's not likely to change in January, what with ITV, the best lead \nindicator for the whole advertising market, predicting a fall of anywhere between 12 and 18 per cent. The question, \nthough, is what will happen throughout the year and whether credit and consumer confidence will pick up by \nsummer. /PA   ZenithOptimedia, the industry forecaster, estimates that newspaper advertising will be down by 3.6 \nper cent in 2009, which, if true, would have proprietors singing Hallelujah in harmony with Alexandra Burke. /PA   \nThat thinking rests essentially on next year's second half not being as bad as this one. That is a possibility, of \ncourse, but there is no obvious summer catalyst - no World Cup or Olympic Games around which advertisers like to \nspend. What is certain is that fairly small percentage differences add up to big numbers. /PA   To illustrate, last year \nThe Guardian and Observer had turnover of Pounds 261 million; the Telegraph titles, Pounds 356 million; Mirror \nGroup Newspapers, Pounds 488million; Associated Newspapers, home of the Daily Mail, Pounds 859 million, and \nNews International, owner of The Times and The Sun, Pounds 1.08 billion. If Zenith is right, turnover will fall by \nbetween Pounds 4 million and Pounds 20 million - assuming all publishers are affected equally. Not much \nimagination is required to see what would happen if advertising fell by 7 per cent, twice the Zenith prediction. /PA   \nThat would be more easily bearable if costs could be controlled, but that is not so simple - not least because of the \nsoaring cost of newsprint. It is set to increase by 16 per cent next year, and paper costs for newspapers represent \nabout a fifth of total turnover. Even allowing for recent redundancies, it is proving tough to reduce costs in 2009. \nExpect profits, then, to fall by about as much as advertising comes down, with soaring newsprint costs absorbing \nthe savings achieved. /PA   None of this is welcome news for the newspaper industry, but it is still far from time to \nargue, as the American chat show Jon Stewart did recently, that newspapers are black and white and completely all \nover. /PA   Having a pile of cash helps. With Pounds 367million in the bank, and profits from Auto Trader \nelsewhere, Guardian Media Group can afford to run a Pounds 26.4 million loss on its national newspapers for a \nwhile. /PA   Those with higher levels of debt and a smaller business have less room for manoeuvre. Such \npublishers will look forward to economic recovery - whether it is Trinity Mirror, with Pounds 450 million of debt \nagainst Pounds 135 million of forecast operating profits in 2008; Daily Mail and General Trust, with Pounds 1billion \nof debt against Pounds 317million of operating profits in its year end of September 28, 2008; or Telegraph Media \nGroup, with Pounds 218million of borrowings on Pounds 38.5million of operating profits in 2007. /PA   By next \nsummer, we will know what the economy is delivering. /PA   dan.sabbagh@thetimes.co.uk /PA   {   /S 897007791 \n/SO The Times /PD 19 December 2008 /PG 71 /SCT Business /HD Controversial Phorm is out to alter world of \nonline advertising;Media /BY Dan Sabbagh, Media Editor /TX /PA In its short life, Phorm has managed to create \nmore controversy than should be possible for a company worth Pounds 40million. Kent Ertugul, its founder, \nmodestly promises to revolutionise online advertising through software that monitors where people surf. /PA   \nPhorm has been investigated by the City of London Police, who decided that its technology did not warrant further \ninvestigation; it has won approval to operate after a separate inquiry by the Department for Business; and it has \nbeen forced to revise its privacy policies. It has allayed the official concerns, but Phorm's share price crashed, dot-\ncom style, from Pounds 35 in February to 200p on Monday. /PA   Working with the internet providers BT, Virgin \nMedia and Carphone Warehouse, Phorm aims to show you advertisements that you want to watch based on the \nsites you visit online. Not everybody wants to be monitored, but after a 10,000-person trial, BT said this week that it \n\nmailto:dan.sabbagh@thetimes.co.uk\n\n\nwould go ahead, on the proviso that its internet subscribers would be able to opt out. Phorm's shares rose \naccordingly, closing yesterday at 287p. /PA   Mr Ertugul, a native of London who has an American accent, founded \nPhorm in 2004 with the help of Russian programmers whom he had recruited soon after the Cold War and who \nworked with him on a range of software businesses in the 1990s. His enthusiasm for Russia was such that he also \nran MiGs Etc, a tour company \"that put tourists in military jets\". /PA   The softly spoken Mr Ertugul, a 20per cent \nshareholder, is at pains to explain Phorm's approach to privacy. He said: \"We sit in the middle, between the internet \nprovider and the network, see what websites people visit, and if we think it is relevant to an advertiser, generate a \ntag - like cars or cameras - that remains associated with that person\". The key, he says, is that although Phorm's \nsoftware may conclude that you are interested in buying a car after a visit to the Auto Trader website, \"we do not \nstore any of the reasoning\", meaning that Phorm maintains no repository of where you have gone. /PA   He said: \n\"Even if somebody comes and demands we give up information about where people have visited, we can't tell \nthem, because we don't keep it.\" /PA   What Phorm does do is associate surfers with a bundle of tags, and when it \nruns into a participating advertiser, it will offer up a relevant advert. Those who are tagged with \"car\" might see Ford \nadvert; those on the \"camera\" list will get a Canon clip instead. \"We don't aim to show anybody more than one \ntargeted advert a day,\" Mr Ertugul said, although that may depend on how much time is spent online. /PA   \"What it \nmeans is that it could be worthwhile for somebody who runs a site on a subject like social policy to sell adverts, \nbecause the adverts will be relevant to the visitors and valuable to the advertisers,\" he said. Phorm's income is \nintended to come from taking a cut from advertisers to use its system, with the bounty shared with its partner \ninternet provider. /PA   What all that is worth is anybody's guess. Landsbanki reckons that Phorm can generate \nPounds 14.9million turnover in 2009; Canaccord Adams suggests Pounds 60million. However, Phorm's prospects \nof going global, which Canaccord's figure implies, have been hindered by a series of management changes. \nStephen Heyer, the previous chairman, a former Coca-Cola executive, lasted four months, and three other \nAmerican executives left as the group has failed to get into the US. \"We had a board of a Fortune 10 company, \nwhen we were AIM listed,\" Mr Ertugul said, although there is talk that the entrepreneur is tough to work with. Hugo \nDrayton, the UK chief executive, stepped down yesterday, but will continue as an adviser. /PA   It is far from clear \nthat Phorm's concept will take off outside the UK, or that there is enough interest in its targeted advertising to make \nserious money.

Its shares surged 15 per cent to a three-month high. Not \n\n\n\nthat Morgan's communique was wholly free of caveats.

Elsewhere, trading in the \ncompany's urban regeneration division remains subdued, notwithstanding last month's award of a Pounds 350 \nmillion contract to revamp Swindon's town centre. But there was much to reassure. About 70 per cent of turnover in \nMorgan's construction arm is government related, which should benefit from the Chancellor's plan to pull forward \nspending on public works. In infrastructure, the company's expertise in tunnelling makes it well placed to capitalise \non the wave of excavation work due to be put out for tender, including the Pounds 1 billion-plus Thames Tideway \nand Pounds 5 billion Crossrail schemes. The more immediate comfort is that Morgan has net cash of more than \nPounds 100million and that its dividend, which even after yesterday's rally still provides a yield of 6.8 per cent, is \nmore than twice covered by next year's forecast earnings. /PA   But at 5891/2p, up 75p, or a forward multiple of \nnearly seven times, it is hard not to feel that the shares have run their course for now.

Yesterday's year-end update reveals that group like-for-like sales were up 1 per cent over the past 15 \nweeks, a clear advance on the 7 per cent decline recorded for the full year. At Mecca, sales are flat, having been \ndown 15.8 per cent at the half-year. /PA   If there is a disappointment, it is that trading at Grosvenor Casinos has \nslowed - reflecting weakness in the provinces rather than in London, where sales remain buoyant - as has business \nas its Blue Square sports betting division. In Spain, poor trading at the Top Rank bingo operation was partly offset \nby the translation effects of a stronger euro. /PA   But tax matters are finally moving in Rank's favour. Last month, \nthe company received back from HM Revenue #38; Customs the Pounds 59 million it had overpaid in VAT in its \nbingo division and yesterday it confirmed that ongoing non payment of that tax will boost this year's operating profits \nby about Pounds 6 million.

The caveat is that Petrofac expects \"some pressure on discretionary spending\" from its \noil and gas clients. /PA   Apart from the slide in oil prices, to which Petrofac is exposed through its North Sea oil \nexploration division, nervousness lies with the potential of oil majors to cancel planned capital expenditure or, at the \nleast, to renegotiate contractual terms in the face of falling raw material costs (largely steel and cement). /PA   That \nis a headache for Petrofac, which is unusual in building onshore petrochemical plants under fixed-price deals. By its \nown admission, such tweaking of terms is under way. /PA   But Petrofac has several key strengths. It operates \nmostly in the Middle East, where the marginal cost of oil and, hence, the risk of cancellations is low. Onshore \nfacilities, unlike drill rigs, are usually among the last to feel the pinch, if only because they are closer to the point at \nwhich oil companies start to generate cash from their investment. /PA   A strong balance sheet (net cash of about \n$300million if client prepayments are ignored) is also persuasive.

Such concerns sent the price of copper to a four-year low. /PA   The \nmetal, used widely in the construction industry, sank to $2,871 a tonne, its lowest since December 2004, which \nproved bad news for Antofagasta, down 253/4p at 4211/4p, which mines copper in Chile. /PA   Worse still for the \ncompany, analysts are predicting that copper prices, which have fallen about 65 per cent since a record high of \n$8,940 in July, could drop even lower, possibly to $2,500 a tonne. /PA   The idea that a copper recovery could still \nbe some way off is exactly why Societe Generale, the French investment bank, decided yesterday to advise its \nclients to sell Antofagasta's shares.

Is he correct? /PA   YES /PA   John Welsh \n/PA   Headteacher, /PA   Bexley Grammar School /PA   We are a grammar school in a South London suburb and \ntake the top 25 per cent of students in terms of ability - we're not super selective. Our students are bright, but \nthey're typical. /PA   With our brightest students, we find there is quite a gap between GCSEs and A levels, or the \nInternational Baccalaureate (IB), which we offer. If students want to go on to university to study science, for \nexample, we find that GCSEs don't stretch them enough and don't develop the skills necessary for a university \ndegree. /PA   We are looking for something with a little bit more rigour and the international GCSE (iGCSE) seems \nto have that. They were developed from the old O levels and command greater attention to detail. They are more \ntechnical and academic than normal GCSEs. At the moment you can take iGCSEs abroad and in independent \nschools. Lots of independent schools are putting their students in for iGCSE courses and other alternatives to \nGCSEs such as the Middle Years Programme, which leads to the IB. /PA   GCSE science in particular is not \ndemanding enough for our brightest students. I believe that there's been an attempt to make the GCSE science \ncourse more accessible for a broader range of students. In doing so, it has removed some of the detail and made it \nless academic. This has made it more difficult to jump from that to A level. The Government should revisit the \nscience GCSE syllabus and assess its suitability for the full range of abilities. I understand that they are trying to \nmake science appeal to a wider audience. However, the problem is that it doesn't develop academic rigour. It's not \ngoing to develop scientists, but only people who are aware of the general principles of science. /PA   Other subjects \ndon't have such a wide gulf between GCSE and A level. In maths, there are qualifications you can take to \nsupplement the GCSEs. Some of our students will take Additional Maths. Really, though, GCSEs should be \nstretching enough for all students. The exams need to be looked at with regard to the full spread of ability. It seems \n\n\n\nto me that it's the most able students who are not being given the proper academic diet - not enough challenge, \ncontent or depth of understanding. We want to run the iGCSEs, but we have been told by the Education Secretary \nthat because we are a state school we're not allowed, as they are not accredited by the Qualifications and \nCurriculum Authority. /PA   I hope that the Goverment will approve iGCSEs so that we can offer the same \nadvantages and courses as independent schools. I fear that if state school students are not offered more stretching \ncourses, they are going to find it more difficult to compete with students from the independent sector. I believe they \nwill go on to take their A levels from a better basis and thus gain the highest grades and the best university places. \nThe danger is we will end up with a two-tier system. /PA   NO /PA   John Dunford /PA   General secretary, the \nAssociation of School and College Leaders /PA   The purpose of the GCSE is, and always has been, to provide an \nexamination for the whole ability range, replacing the separate O level and CSE examinations. We must not return \nto educational apartheid at age 16, or the needs of modern society will not be served. So GCSE papers have to be \nset in a way that provides a challenge for the most able students who aim to obtain a top grade, while being \naccessible for young people of lower academic ability who must have the opportunity to demonstrate their \nknowledge and skills without being put off by inaccessible questions. /PA   The criticism of the GCSE that it does \nnot stretch the brightest pupils is aiming at the wrong target. Good teachers do not regard an exam syllabus as a \nlimitation on the education of their pupils. Teachers of bright pupils have always gone beyond the syllabus to stretch \nthe intellect of their pupils. Good English teachers will introduce the brightest pupils to a wider range of texts, good \nmaths teachers will explore more abstract concepts, good geography teachers will bring into their lessons parts of \nthe world that are not on the syllabus, and good history teachers will encourage bright students to read widely and \ngain greater depth in their understanding of historical interpretation. The ages of 14 and 15, when children generally \ndo GCSE courses, is exactly the right age to stimulate their intellects in this way. Good teachers help them to \nachieve top grades, but they must also bring to them the excitement of learning and it is expecting too much of any \nsyllabus that it should do this for all students. The International GCSE (iGCSE) certainly won't. /PA   It is not true, \neither, that the GCSE examinations are getting easier. I understand that there is a fear that the modular approach to \nGCSE assessment will lead to a \"bite-sized chunks\" approach on the part of pupils. But this is not a foregone \nconclusion; rather, it is one that depends on the way in which the teacher approaches the subject. /PA   To create a \nsituation in which independent schools do one kind of exam and state schools do another would be extremely \ndamaging to the education service as a whole. The iGCSE is a throwback to an earlier era and it is backward to \nmove in that direction. It is an O level-type paper, and its syllabus and examination style will not necessarily be \nmore challenging than the GCSE, even in the hands of good teachers. I think there is a false optimism around the \nidea of the iGCSE and the Middle Years Programme of the International Baccalaureate, which Anthony Seldon, the \nMaster of Wellington College, favours. /PA   It would be far better if independent schools worked within the system \nto improve the GCSE. What I would like to see these schools do is join the debate from the inside, rather than the \noutside. The whole education sector - independent and state-funded - must come together to discuss what's next \nfor the GCSE examination. /PA   {   /S 897007808 /SO The Times /PD 19 December 2008 /PG 76 /SCT Business \n/HD Global aid in crisis as cash supply dries up;Factbox;Public sector /BY Parminder Bahra /TX /PA The credit \ncrunch has hit philanthropists and the public is more sceptical, according to a UN adviser, reports Parminder Bahra \n/PA   International aid programmes are in crisis, with governments around the world failing to honour funding \npromises, individual donors sceptical about aid policies and wealthy philanthropists losing money in the economic \nturmoil. /PA   Jeffrey Sachs, special adviser to the United Nations, told The Times: \"We have a terrible situation \nbecause the overall aid system is on its knees and that was true even before this global economic crisis.\" /PA   \nProfessor Sachs said that the commitments made in 2005 as part of the Gleneagles agreement, when the G8 group \nof the world's richest nations agreed to substantial debt relief and a commitment to increase aid to Africa, have not \nbeen fulfilled. /PA   \"Promises that were made in 2005 are our benchmark with very specific time bound \ncommitments,\" he said. \"Europe is not meeting them, the United States is not really at the table properly, Japan has \nbeen cutting aid relentlessly and this is a very serious problem.\" /PA   He added that the economic downturn will \nhave dire consequences for the poorest nations. \"It has recently been reported that the number of deeply hungry \npeople has risen to nearly a billion,\" he said. \"There is an energy crisis, a continuing food crisis, a global economic \ncrisis and aid efforts that are definitely flagging at best.\" /PA   Professor Sachs's work as adviser to Ban Ki Moon, \nthe UN Secretary- General, has led him to argue strongly the case for aid as the key to economic development. \n\"There are a tremendous number of things that can be done and aren't being done,\" he said. \"And we are really \nemphasising the need to step up aid in magnitude and intensity but also to improve the quality of aid.\" /PA   \nProfessor Sachs is critical of suggestions that it is more important for developing countries to secure a trade \n\n\n\nagreement in the World Trade Organisation talks than to be given more aid.

In the three \nyears we have been going, we have been turned down for more than 50 grant applications.

It was really inspiring. He \nsaid that charities needed to be businesses, and that they could no longer rely on getting grants without proving \nfirst that they were successful. /PA   Initially, the idea of being a business stuck in our throats. It seemed to be \nopposed to our ethics and felt like we were making profit out of young people's misery. /PA   Then we started selling \nplaces on a BTEC course in peer education for marginalised young people.

But this is the amount required to lift each person in the Earth Institute's Millennium \nInitiative projects in Africa out of poverty, according to Jeffrey Sachs. /PA   Professor Sachs promotes the use of \nofficial development aid, and lots of it, to tackle the core problems faced by Africa - disease, physical isolation, \nclimate stress, environmental degradation and extreme poverty. /PA   The Millennium Cities Initiative (MCI) and its \nrural counterpart, the Millennium Villages Initiative (MVI) are both designed to help regions in Africa to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals (including the end of poverty and hunger; universal education; sex equality; \ncombating HIV and Aids; environmental sustainability and improved maternal and child health) and increase \neconomic growth through targeted investments. /PA   Professor Sachs says: \"Each of the cities has its own \nopportunities. Agriculture is obviously part of every one.\" He also thinks that tourism has great potential and that \nthere is also scope for businesses in light manufacturing, pharmaceuticals for the domestic market, minerals and \nmining. /PA   The point of the MCI is to \"exploit these opportunities\" by bringing together public and private entities. \nHis organisation hosts events where possible investors can meet and identify business potential so that they can \n\"close the gaps in knowledge and get the markets to do a lot of the job\". /PA   Professor Sachs argues that it is \ncritical that economic aid is focused and targeted and that it engages the private, as well as the public, sector. /PA   \nThe MCI has been set up in nine cities in seven African countries - Mali, Malawi, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, Ethiopia \nand Ghana.
