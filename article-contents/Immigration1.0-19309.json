{"title": "SF activists on hunger strike for undocumented immigrants", "body": "\nFriday night's rain did not stop more than 50 activists from continuing a hunger strike in front of the San Francisco \nFederal Building.\n\nThe hunger strike, in its fifth day today, is part of a weeklong protest against U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter's bill, which \nactivists say unfairly targets undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe House of Representatives passed the `Border Protection Anti-Terrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act,'' \nalso known as HR 4437 on Dec. 16, 2005.\n\nThe senate plans to review the bill this month.\n\nOn Friday afternoon activists delivered 8,000 postcards signed by Bay Area residents to Sen. Diane Feinstein's \nSan Francisco office. The postcards urged Feinstein to support comprehensive immigration reform. They stated, \n`we need you to demonstrate leadership by opposing mean-spirited attempts at 'immigration reform' that only \ncriminalize immigrants and threaten caring individuals that help those in need.`\n\n`We are hoping that Feinstein will take a leadership role in opposing Specter's bill. We want to know her stance on \nindoctrinated immigrants,` said activist Sheila Chung, daughter of immigrant parents from Korea and Argentina.\n\nA candlelight vigil is scheduled for 6 p.m. today in front of the Federal Building located at 450 Golden Gate Ave.\n\nThose participating in the hunger strike are journaling their daily activities in an online blog, which can be found at \nhttp://immigrantrights.blogspot.com.\n"}
