Ten Commissioners - five \nRepublicans and five Democrats chosen by elected leaders from our nation's capital at a time of great partisan \ndivision - have come together to present this report without dissent.\n\nWe have come together with a unity of purpose because our nation demands it. September 11, 2001, was a day of \nunprecedented shock and suffering in the history of the United States. The nation was unprepared. How did this \nhappen, and how can we avoid such tragedy again?\n\nTo answer these questions, the Congress and the President created the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks \nUpon the United States (Public Law 107-306, November 27, 2002).\n\nOur mandate was sweeping. The law directed us to investigate \"facts and circumstances relating to the terrorist \nattacks of September 11, 2001, \" including those relating to intelligence agencies, law enforcement agencies, \ndiplomacy, immigration issues and border control, the flow of assets to terrorist organizations, commercial aviation, \nthe role of congressional oversight and resource allocation, and other areas determined relevant by the \nCommission.\n\nIn pursuing our mandate, we have reviewed more than 2. 5 million pages of documents and interviewed more than \n1, 200 individuals in ten countries. This included nearly every senior official from the current and previous \nadministrations who had responsibility for topics covered in our mandate.\n\nWe have sought to be independent, impartial, thorough, and nonpartisan. From the outset, we have been \ncommitted to share as much of our investigation as we can with the American people. To that end, we held 19 days \nof hearings and took public testimony from 160 witnesses. page xvi\n\nOur aim has not been to assign individual blame. Our aim has been to provide the fullest possible account of the \nevents surrounding 9/11 and to identify lessons learned.\n\nWe learned about an enemy who is sophisticated, patient, disciplined, and lethal. The enemy rallies broad support \nin the Arab and Muslim world by demanding redress of political grievances, but its hostility toward us and our values \nis limitless. Its purpose is to rid the world of religious and political pluralism, the plebiscite, and equal rights for \nwomen. It makes no distinction between military and civilian targets. Collateral damage is not in its lexicon.\n\nWe learned that the institutions charged with protecting our borders, civil aviation, and national security did not \nunderstand how grave this threat could be, and did not adjust their policies, plans, and practices to deter or defeat \nit. We learned of fault lines within our government - between foreign and domestic intelligence, and between and \nwithin agencies. We learned of the pervasive problems of managing and sharing information across a large and \nunwieldy government that had been built in a different era to confront different dangers.\n\nAt the outset of our work, we said we were looking backward in order to look forward. We hope that the terrible \nlosses chronicled in this report can create something positive - an America that is safer, stronger, and wiser. That \nSeptember day, we came together as a nation. The test before us is to sustain that unity of purpose and meet the \nchallenges now confronting us.\n\nWe need to design a balanced strategy for the long haul, to attack terrorists and prevent their ranks from swelling \nwhile at the same time protecting our country against future attacks. We have been forced to think about the way \nour government is organized. The massive departments and agencies that prevailed in the great struggles of the \ntwentieth century must work together in new ways, so that all the instruments of national power can be combined. \nCongress needs dramatic change as well to strengthen oversight and focus accountability.\n\nAs we complete our final report, we want to begin by thanking our fellow Commissioners, whose dedication to this \ntask has been profound. We have reasoned together over every page, and the report has benefited from this \nremarkable dialogue. We want to express our considerable respect for the intellect and judgment of our colleagues, \nas well as our great affection for them.\n\nWe want to thank the Commission staff. The dedicated professional staff, headed by Philip Zelikow, has contributed \ninnumerable hours to the completion of this report, setting aside other important endeavors to take on this page xvii\n\n\n\nall-consuming assignment. They have conducted the exacting investigative work upon which the Commission has \nbuilt. They have given good advice, and faithfully carried out our guidance. They have been superb.\n\nWe thank the Congress and the President. Executive branch agencies have searched records and produced a \nmultitude of documents for us. We thank officials, past and present, who were generous with their time and \nprovided us with insight. The PENTTBOM team at the FBI, the Director's Review Group at the CIA, and Inspectors \nGeneral at the Department of Justice and the CIA provided great assistance. We owe a huge debt to their \ninvestigative labors, painstaking attention to detail, and readiness to share what they have learned. We have built \non the work of several previous Commissions, and we thank the Congressional Joint Inquiry, whose fine work \nhelped us get started. We thank the City of New York for assistance with documents and witnesses, and the \nGovernment Printing Office and W. W. Norton & Company for helping to get this report to the broad public.\n\nWe conclude this list of thanks by coming full circle:We thank the families of 9/11, whose persistence and \ndedication helped create the Commission. They have been with us each step of the way, as partners and \nwitnesses. They know better than any of us the importance of the work we have undertaken.\n\nWe want to note what we have done, and not done. We have endeavored to provide the most complete account we \ncan of the events of September 11, what happened and why. This final report is only a summary of what we have \ndone, citing only a fraction of the sources we have consulted. But in an event of this scale, touching so many issues \nand organizations, we are conscious of our limits. We have not interviewed every knowledgeable person or found \nevery relevant piece of paper. New information inevitably will come to light. We present this report as a foundation \nfor a better understanding of a landmark in the history of our nation.\n\nWe have listened to scores of overwhelming personal tragedies and astounding acts of heroism and bravery. We \nhave examined the staggering impact of the events of 9/11 on the American people and their amazing resilience \nand courage as they fought back. We have admired their determination to do their best to prevent another tragedy \nwhile preparing to respond if it becomes necessary. We emerge from this investigation with enormous sympathy for \nthe victims and their loved ones, and with enhanced respect for the American people. We recognize the formidable \nchallenges that lie ahead.\n\nWe also approach the task of recommendations with humility. We have page xviii\n\nmade a limited number of them. We decided consciously to focus on recommendations we believe to be most \nimportant, whose implementation can make the greatest difference. We came into this process with strong opinions \nabout what would work. All of us have had to pause, reflect, and sometimes change our minds as we studied these \nproblems and considered the views of others. We hope our report will encourage our fellow citizens to study, reflect \n- and act.\n\nThomas H. Kean  chair\n\nLee H. Hamilton  vice chair\n\n1 \"WE HAVE SOME PLANES\" \n\nTuesday, September 11, 2001, dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern United States. Millions of \nmen and women readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures \nof the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across \nthe Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, \npeople began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early \nmorning run.\n\nFor those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. \nAmong the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine.\n\n\n\n1. 1 INSIDE THE FOUR FLIGHTS \n\nBoarding the Flights \n\nBoston:American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A. M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan \nInternational Airport.  \n\nWhen he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as \nCAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be \nsubject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's \nselection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded \nthe aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans.  \n\nAtta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a \nlongtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes.   It would be their \nfinal conversation.\n\nBetween 6:45 and 7:40, Atta and Omari, along with Satam al Suqami, Wail al Shehri, and Waleed al Shehri, \nchecked in and boarded American Airlines Flight 11, bound for Los Angeles. The flight was scheduled to depart at \n7:45.  \n\nIn another Logan terminal, Shehhi, joined by Fayez Banihammad, Mohand al Shehri, Ahmed al Ghamdi, and \nHamza al Ghamdi, checked in for United Airlines Flight 175, also bound for Los Angeles. A couple of Shehhi's \ncolleagues were obviously unused to travel; according to the United ticket agent, they had trouble understanding \nthe standard security questions, and she had to go over them slowly until they gave the routine, reassuring \nanswers.   Their flight was scheduled to depart at 8:00.\n\nThe security checkpoints through which passengers, including Atta and his colleagues, gained access to the \nAmerican 11 gate were operated by Globe Security under a contract with American Airlines. In a different terminal, \nthe single checkpoint through which passengers for United 175 passed was controlled by United Airlines, which had \ncontracted with Huntleigh USA to perform the screening.  \n\nIn passing through these checkpoints, each of the hijackers would have been screened by a walk-through metal \ndetector calibrated to detect items with at least the metal content of a . 22-caliber handgun. Anyone who might have \nset off that detector would have been screened with a hand wand - a procedure requiring the screener to identify \nthe metal item or items that caused the alarm. In addition, an X-ray machine would have screened the hijackers' \ncarry-on belongings. The screening was in place to identify and confiscate weapons and other items prohibited from \nbeing carried onto a commercial flight.   None of the checkpoint supervisors recalled the hijackers or reported \nanything suspicious regarding their screening.  \n\nWhile Atta had been selected by CAPPS in Portland, three members of his hijacking team - Suqami, Wail al Shehri, \nand Waleed al Shehri - were selected in Boston. Their selection affected only the handling of their checked bags, \nnot their screening at the checkpoint. All five men cleared the checkpoint and made their way to the gate for \nAmerican 11. Atta, Omari, and Suqami took their seats in business class (seats 8D, 8G, and 10B, respectively). The \nShehri brothers had adjacent seats in row 2 (Wail in 2A, Waleed in 2B), in the firstclass cabin. They boarded \nAmerican 11 between 7:31 and 7:40. The aircraft pushed back from the gate at 7:40.  \n\nShehhi and his team, none of whom had been selected by CAPPS, boarded United 175 between 7:23 and 7:28 \n(Banihammad in 2A, Shehri in 2B, Shehhi in 6C, Hamza al Ghamdi in 9C, and Ahmed al Ghamdi in 9D). Their \naircraft pushed back from the gate just before 8:00.  \n\nWashington Dulles:American 77. Hundreds of miles southwest of Boston, at Dulles International Airport in the \n\n\n\nVirginia suburbs of Washington, D. C. , five more men were preparing to take their early morning flight. At 7:15, a \npair\n\nof them, Khalid al Mihdhar and Majed Moqed, checked in at the American Airlines ticket counter for Flight 77, bound \nfor Los Angeles. Within the next 20 minutes, they would be followed by Hani Hanjour and two brothers, Nawaf al \nHazmi and Salem al Hazmi.  \n\nHani Hanjour, Khalid al Mihdhar, and Majed Moqed were flagged by CAPPS. The Hazmi brothers were also \nselected for extra scrutiny by the airline's customer service representative at the check-in counter. He did so \nbecause one of the brothers did not have photo identification nor could he understand English, and because the \nagent found both of the passengers to be suspicious. The only consequence of their selection was that their \nchecked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that they had boarded the aircraft.  \n\nAll five hijackers passed through the Main Terminal's west security screening checkpoint; United Airlines, which \nwas the responsible air carrier, had contracted out the work to Argenbright Security.   The checkpoint featured \nclosed-circuit television that recorded all passengers, including the hijackers, as they were screened. At 7:18, \nMihdhar and Moqed entered the security checkpoint.\n\nMihdhar and Moqed placed their carry-on bags on the belt of the X-ray machine and proceeded through the first \nmetal detector. Both set off the alarm, and they were directed to a second metal detector. Mihdhar did not trigger \nthe alarm and was permitted through the checkpoint. After Moqed set it off, a screener wanded him. He passed this \ninspection.  \n\nAbout 20 minutes later, at 7:35, another passenger for Flight 77, Hani Hanjour, placed two carry-on bags on the X-\nray belt in the Main Terminal's west checkpoint, and proceeded, without alarm, through the metal detector. A short \ntime later, Nawaf and Salem al Hazmi entered the same checkpoint. Salem al Hazmi cleared the metal detector and \nwas permitted through;Nawaf al Hazmi set off the alarms for both the first and second metal detectors and was then \nhand-wanded before being passed. In addition, his over-the-shoulder carry-on bag was swiped by an explosive \ntrace detector and then passed. The video footage indicates that he was carrying an unidentified item in his back \npocket, clipped to its rim.  \n\nWhen the local civil aviation security office of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) later investigated these \nsecurity screening operations, the screeners recalled nothing out of the ordinary. They could not recall that any of \nthe passengers they screened were CAPPS selectees. We asked a screening expert to review the videotape of the \nhand-wanding, and he found the quality of the screener's work to have been \"marginal at best. \"The screener \nshould have \"resolved\" what set off the alarm; and in the case of both Moqed and Hazmi, it was clear that he did \nnot.  \n\nAt 7:50, Majed Moqed and Khalid al Mihdhar boarded the flight and were seated in 12A and 12B in coach. Hani \nHanjour, assigned to seat 1B (first class),\n\nsoon followed. The Hazmi brothers, sitting in 5E and 5F, joined Hanjour in the first-class cabin.  \n\nNewark: United 93. Between 7:03 and 7:39, Saeed al Ghamdi, Ahmed al Nami, Ahmad al Haznawi, and Ziad \nJarrah checked in at the United Airlines ticket counter for Flight 93, going to Los Angeles. Two checked bags; two \ndid not. Haznawi was selected by CAPPS. His checked bag was screened for explosives and then loaded on the \nplane.  \n\nThe four men passed through the security checkpoint, owned by United Airlines and operated under contract by \nArgenbright Security. Like the checkpoints in Boston, it lacked closed-circuit television surveillance so there is no \ndocumentary evidence to indicate when the hijackers passed through the checkpoint, what alarms may have been \ntriggered, or what security procedures were administered. The FAA interviewed the screeners later; none recalled \nanything unusual or suspicious.  \n\nThe four men boarded the plane between 7:39 and 7:48. All four had seats in the first-class cabin; their plane had \nno business-class section. Jarrah was in seat 1B, closest to the cockpit; Nami was in 3C, Ghamdi in 3D, and \nHaznawi in 6B.  \n\n\n\nThe 19 men were aboard four transcontinental flights.   They were planning to hijack these planes and turn them \ninto large guided missiles, loaded with up to 11, 400 gallons of jet fuel. By 8:00 A. M. on the morning of Tuesday, \nSeptember 11, 2001, they had defeated all the security layers that America's civil aviation security system then had \nin place to prevent a hijacking.\n\nThe Hijacking of American 11 \n\nAmerican Airlines Flight 11 provided nonstop service from Boston to Los Angeles. On September 11, Captain John \nOgonowski and First Officer Thomas McGuinness piloted the Boeing 767. It carried its full capacity of nine flight \nattendants. Eighty-one passengers boarded the flight with them (including the five terrorists).  \n\nThe plane took off at 7:59. Just before 8:14, it had climbed to 26, 000 feet, not quite its initial assigned cruising \naltitude of 29, 000 feet. All communications and flight profile data were normal. About this time the \"Fasten \nSeatbelt\" sign would usually have been turned off and the flight attendants would have begun preparing for cabin \nservice.  \n\nAt that same time, American 11 had its last routine communication with the ground when it acknowledged \nnavigational instructions from the FAA's air traffic control (ATC) center in Boston. Sixteen seconds after that \ntransmission, ATC instructed the aircraft's pilots to climb to 35, 000 feet. That message and all subsequent attempts \nto contact the flight were not acknowledged. From this and other evidence, we believe the hijacking began at 8:14 \nor shortly thereafter.  \n\nReports from two flight attendants in the coach cabin, Betty Ong and Madeline \"Amy\" Sweeney, tell us most of what \nwe know about how the hijacking happened. As it began, some of the hijackers - most likely Wail al Shehri and \nWaleed al Shehri, who were seated in row 2 in first class - stabbed the two unarmed flight attendants who would \nhave been preparing for cabin service.  \n\nWe do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain \nclosed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had \"jammed their way\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed \nthe flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first \nofficer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way.  \n\nAt the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta - the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet - would have moved to the \ncockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel \nLewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers - probably \nSatam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli \nmilitary. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting \nbehind him.  \n\nThe hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, \nin order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb.  \n\nAbout five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations \nOffice in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of \nseveral occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized \nthat in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 \nminutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to \nauthorities on the ground.  \n\nAt 8:19, Ong reported:\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class - and I think there's \nMace - that we can't breathe - I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked. \" She then told of the stabbings of the two \nflight attendants.  \n\nAt 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the \nAmerican Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis \nsoon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the \ncockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft. Six minutes later, the air traffic control \n\n\n\nspecialist in American's operations center contacted the FAA's Boston Air Traffic Control Center about the flight. \nThe center was already aware of the problem.  \n\nBoston Center knew of a problem on the flight in part because just before 8:25 the hijackers had attempted to \ncommunicate with the passengers. The microphone was keyed, and immediately one of the hijackers said, \"Nobody \nmove. Everything will be okay. If you try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay \nquiet. \"Air traffic controllers heard the transmission; Ong did not. The hijackers probably did not know how to \noperate the cockpit radio communication system correctly, and thus inadvertently broadcast their message over the \nair traffic control channel instead of the cabin public-address channel. Also at 8:25, and again at 8:29, Amy \nSweeney got through to the American Flight Services Office in Boston but was cut off after she reported someone \nwas hurt aboard the flight. Three minutes later, Sweeney was reconnected to the office and began relaying updates \nto the manager, Michael Woodward.  \n\nAt 8:26, Ong reported that the plane was \"flying erratically. \"A minute later, Flight 11 turned south. American also \nbegan getting identifications of the hijackers, as Ong and then Sweeney passed on some of the seat numbers of \nthose who had gained unauthorized access to the cockpit.  \n\nSweeney calmly reported on her line that the plane had been hijacked; a man in first class had his throat slashed; \ntwo flight attendants had been stabbed - one was seriously hurt and was on oxygen while the other's wounds \nseemed minor; a doctor had been requested; the flight attendants were unable to contact the cockpit; and there was \na bomb in the cockpit. Sweeney told Woodward that she and Ong were trying to relay as much information as they \ncould to people on the ground.  \n\nAt 8:38, Ong told Gonzalez that the plane was flying erratically again. Around this time Sweeney told Woodward \nthat the hijackers were Middle Easterners, naming three of their seat numbers. One spoke very little English and \none spoke excellent English. The hijackers had gained entry to the cockpit, and she did not know how. The aircraft \nwas in a rapid descent.  \n\nAt 8:41, Sweeney told Woodward that passengers in coach were under the impression that there was a routine \nmedical emergency in first class. Other flight attendants were busy at duties such as getting medical supplies while \nOng and Sweeney were reporting the events.  \n\nAt 8:41, in American's operations center, a colleague told Marquis that the air traffic controllers declared Flight 11 a \nhijacking and \"think he's [American 11] headed toward Kennedy [airport in New York City]. They're moving \neverybody out of the way. They seem to have him on a primary radar. They seem to think that he is descending. \"  \n\nAt 8:44, Gonzalez reported losing phone contact with Ong. About this same time Sweeney reported to Woodward, \n\"Something is wrong. We are in a rapid descent . . . we are all over the place. \"Woodward asked Sweeney to look \nout the window to see if she could determine where they were. Sweeney responded:\"We are flying low. We are \nflying very, very low. We are flying way\n\ntoo low. \" Seconds later she said, \"Oh my God we are way too low. \" The phone call ended.  \n\nAt 8:46:40, American 11 crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City.   All on board, \nalong with an unknown number of people in the tower, were killed instantly.\n\nThe Hijacking of United 175 \n\nUnited Airlines Flight 175 was scheduled to depart for Los Angeles at 8:00. Captain Victor Saracini and First Officer \nMichael Horrocks piloted the Boeing 767, which had seven flight attendants. Fifty-six passengers boarded the flight.  \n\nUnited 175 pushed back from its gate at 7:58 and departed Logan Airport at 8:14. By 8:33, it had reached its \nassigned cruising altitude of 31, 000 feet. The flight attendants would have begun their cabin service.  \n\nThe flight had taken off just as American 11 was being hijacked, and at 8:42 the United 175 flight crew completed \ntheir report on a \"suspicious transmission\" overheard from another plane (which turned out to have been Flight 11) \njust after takeoff. This was United 175's last communication with the ground.  \n\n\n\nThe hijackers attacked sometime between 8:42 and 8:46. They used knives (as reported by two passengers and a \nflight attendant), Mace (reported by one passenger), and the threat of a bomb (reported by the same passenger). \nThey stabbed members of the flight crew (reported by a flight attendant and one passenger). Both pilots had been \nkilled (reported by one flight attendant). The eyewitness accounts came from calls made from the rear of the plane, \nfrom passengers originally seated further forward in the cabin, a sign that passengers and perhaps crew had been \nmoved to the back of the aircraft. Given similarities to American 11 in hijacker seating and in eyewitness reports of \ntactics and weapons, as well as the contact between the presumed team leaders, Atta and Shehhi, we believe the \ntactics were similar on both flights.  \n\nThe first operational evidence that something was abnormal on United 175 came at 8:47, when the aircraft changed \nbeacon codes twice within a minute. At 8:51, the flight deviated from its assigned altitude, and a minute later New \nYork air traffic controllers began repeatedly and unsuccessfully trying to contact it.  \n\nAt 8:52, in Easton, Connecticut, a man named Lee Hanson received a phone call from his son Peter, a passenger \non United 175. His son told him: \"I think they've taken over the cockpit - An attendant has been stabbed - and \nsomeone else up front may have been killed. The plane is making strange moves. Call United Airlines - Tell them \nit's Flight 175, Boston to LA. \" Lee Hanson then called the Easton Police Department and relayed what he had \nheard.  \n\nAlso at 8:52, a male flight attendant called a United office in San Francisco, reaching Marc Policastro. The flight \nattendant reported that the flight had been hijacked, both pilots had been killed, a flight attendant had been \nstabbed, and\n\nthe hijackers were probably flying the plane. The call lasted about two minutes, after which Policastro and a \ncolleague tried unsuccessfully to contact the flight.  \n\nAt 8:58, the flight took a heading toward New York City.  \n\nAt 8:59, Flight 175 passenger Brian David Sweeney tried to call his wife, Julie. He left a message on their home \nanswering machine that the plane had been hijacked. He then called his mother, Louise Sweeney, told her the flight \nhad been hijacked, and added that the passengers were thinking about storming the cockpit to take control of the \nplane away from the hijackers.  \n\nAt 9:00, Lee Hanson received a second call from his son Peter:\n\n        It's getting bad, Dad - A stewardess was stabbed - They seem to\n\n        have knives and Mace - They said they have a bomb - It's getting\n\n        very bad on the plane - Passengers are throwing up and getting sick\n\n        - The plane is making jerky movements - I don't think the pilot is\n\n        flying the plane - I think we are going down - I think they intend\n\n        to go to Chicago or someplace and fly into a building - Don't\n\n        worry, Dad - If it happens, it'll be very fast - My God, my God.\n\n        \n\n        \n\nThe call ended abruptly. Lee Hanson had heard a woman scream just before it cut off. He turned on a television, \nand in her home so did Louise Sweeney. Both then saw the second aircraft hit the World Trade Center.  \n\nAt 9:03:11, United Airlines Flight 175 struck the South Tower of the World Trade Center.   All on board, along with \nan unknown number of people in the tower, were killed instantly.\n\nThe Hijacking of American 77 \n\n\n\nAmerican Airlines Flight 77 was scheduled to depart from Washington Dulles for Los Angeles at 8:10. The aircraft \nwas a Boeing 757 piloted by Captain Charles F. Burlingame and First Officer David Charlebois. There were four \nflight attendants. On September 11, the flight carried 58 passengers.  \n\nAmerican 77 pushed back from its gate at 8:09 and took off at 8:20. At 8:46, the flight reached its assigned cruising \naltitude of 35, 000 feet. Cabin service would have begun. At 8:51, American 77 transmitted its last routine radio \ncommunication. The hijacking began between 8:51 and 8:54. As on American 11 and United 175, the hijackers \nused knives (reported by one passenger) and moved all the passengers (and possibly crew) to the rear of the \naircraft (reported by one flight attendant and one passenger). Unlike the earlier flights, the Flight 77 hijackers were \nreported by a passenger to have box cutters. Finally, a passenger reported that an announcement had been made \nby the \"pilot\" that the plane had been hijacked. Neither of the firsthand accounts mentioned any stabbings or the \nthreat or use of either a bomb or Mace, though both witnesses began the flight in the first-class cabin.  \n\nAt 8:54, the aircraft deviated from its assigned course, turning south. Two minutes later the transponder was turned \noff and even primary radar contact with the aircraft was lost. The Indianapolis Air Traffic Control Center repeatedly \ntried and failed to contact the aircraft. American Airlines dispatchers also tried, without success.  \n\nAt 9:00, American Airlines Executive Vice President Gerard Arpey learned that communications had been lost with \nAmerican 77. This was now the second American aircraft in trouble. He ordered all American Airlines flights in the \nNortheast that had not taken off to remain on the ground. Shortly before 9:10, suspecting that American 77 had \nbeen hijacked, American headquarters concluded that the second aircraft to hit the World Trade Center might have \nbeen Flight 77. After learning that United Airlines was missing a plane, American Airlines headquarters extended \nthe ground stop nationwide.  \n\nAt 9:12, Renee May called her mother, Nancy May, in Las Vegas. She said her flight was being hijacked by six \nindividuals who had moved them to the rear of the plane. She asked her mother to alert American Airlines. Nancy \nMay and her husband promptly did so.  \n\nAt some point between 9:16 and 9:26, Barbara Olson called her husband, Ted Olson, the solicitor general of the \nUnited States. She reported that the flight had been hijacked, and the hijackers had knives and box cutters. She \nfurther indicated that the hijackers were not aware of her phone call, and that they had put all the passengers in the \nback of the plane. About a minute into the conversation, the call was cut off. Solicitor General Olson tried \nunsuccessfully to reach Attorney General John Ashcroft.  \n\nShortly after the first call, Barbara Olson reached her husband again. She reported that the pilot had announced \nthat the flight had been hijacked, and she asked her husband what she should tell the captain to do. Ted Olson \nasked for her location and she replied that the aircraft was then flying over houses. Another passenger told her they \nwere traveling northeast. The Solicitor General then informed his wife of the two previous hijackings and crashes. \nShe did not display signs of panic and did not indicate any awareness of an impending crash. At that point, the \nsecond call was cut off.  \n\nAt 9:29, the autopilot on American 77 was disengaged; the aircraft was at 7, 000 feet and approximately 38 miles \nwest of the Pentagon.   At 9:32, controllers at the Dulles Terminal Radar Approach Control \"observed a primary \nradar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed. \" This was later determined to have been Flight 77.\n\nAt 9:34, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport advised the Secret Service of an unknown aircraft heading in \nthe direction of the White House. American 77 was then 5 miles west-southwest of the Pentagon and began a 330-\ndegree turn. At the end of the turn, it was descending through 2, 200 feet, pointed toward the Pentagon and \ndowntown Washington. The hijacker pilot then advanced the throttles to maximum power and dove toward the \nPentagon.  \n\nAt 9:37:46, American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon, traveling at approximately 530 miles per hour.   \nAll on board, as well as many civilian and military personnel in the building, were killed.\n\nThe Battle for United 93 \n\n\n\nAt 8:42, United Airlines Flight 93 took off from Newark (New Jersey) Liberty International Airport bound for San \nFrancisco. The aircraft was piloted by Captain Jason Dahl and First Officer Leroy Homer, and there were five flight \nattendants. Thirty-seven passengers, including the hijackers, boarded the plane. Scheduled to depart the gate at \n8:00, the Boeing 757's takeoff was delayed because of the airport's typically heavy morning traffic.  \n\nThe hijackers had planned to take flights scheduled to depart at 7:45 (American 11), 8:00 (United 175 and United \n93), and 8:10 (American 77). Three of the flights had actually taken off within 10 to 15 minutes of their planned \ndeparture times. United 93 would ordinarily have taken off about 15 minutes after pulling away from the gate. When \nit left the ground at 8:42, the flight was running more than 25 minutes late.  \n\nAs United 93 left Newark, the flight's crew members were unaware of the hijacking of American 11. Around 9:00, \nthe FAA, American, and United were facing the staggering realization of apparent multiple hijackings. At 9:03, they \nwould see another aircraft strike the World Trade Center. Crisis managers at the FAA and the airlines did not yet \nact to warn other aircraft.   At the same time, Boston Center realized that a message transmitted just before 8:25 by \nthe hijacker pilot of American 11 included the phrase, \"We have some planes. \"  \n\nNo one at the FAA or the airlines that day had ever dealt with multiple hijackings. Such a plot had not been carried \nout anywhere in the world in more than 30 years, and never in the United States. As news of the hijackings filtered \nthrough the FAA and the airlines, it does not seem to have occurred to their leadership that they needed to alert \nother aircraft in the air that they too might be at risk.  \n\nUnited 175 was hijacked between 8:42 and 8:46, and awareness of that hijacking began to spread after 8:51. \nAmerican 77 was hijacked between 8:51 and 8:54. By 9:00, FAA and airline officials began to comprehend that \nattackers were going after multiple aircraft. American Airlines' nationwide ground stop between 9:05 and 9:10 was \nfollowed by a United Airlines ground stop. FAA controllers at Boston Center, which had tracked the first two \nhijackings, requested at 9:07 that Herndon Command Center \"get messages to airborne aircraft to increase security \nfor the cockpit. \"There is no evidence that Herndon took such action. Boston Center immediately began speculating \nabout other aircraft that might be in danger, leading them to worry about a transcontinental flight - Delta 1989 - that \nin fact was not hijacked. At 9:19, the FAA's New England regional office called Herndon and asked that Cleveland \nCenter advise Delta 1989 to use extra cockpit security.  \n\nSeveral FAA air traffic control officials told us it was the air carriers' responsibility to notify their planes of security \nproblems. One senior FAA air traffic control manager said that it was simply not the FAA's place to order the airlines \nwhat to tell their pilots.   We believe such statements do not reflect an adequate appreciation of the FAA's \nresponsibility for the safety and security of civil aviation.\n\nThe airlines bore responsibility, too. They were facing an escalating number of conflicting and, for the most part, \nerroneous reports about other flights, as well as a continuing lack of vital information from the FAA about the \nhijacked flights. We found no evidence, however, that American Airlines sent any cockpit warnings to its aircraft on \n9/11. United's first decisive action to notify its airborne aircraft to take defensive action did not come until 9:19, \nwhen a United flight dispatcher, Ed Ballinger, took the initiative to begin transmitting warnings to his 16 \ntranscontinental flights: \"Beware any cockpit intrusion - Two a/c [aircraft] hit World Trade Center. \" One of the flights \nthat received the warning was United 93. Because Ballinger was still responsible for his other flights as well as \nFlight 175, his warning message was not transmitted to Flight 93 until 9:23.  \n\nBy all accounts, the first 46 minutes of Flight 93's cross-country trip proceeded routinely. Radio communications \nfrom the plane were normal. Heading, speed, and altitude ran according to plan. At 9:24, Ballinger's warning to \nUnited 93 was received in the cockpit. Within two minutes, at 9:26, the pilot, Jason Dahl, responded with a note of \npuzzlement: \"Ed, confirm latest mssg plz - Jason. \"  \n\nThe hijackers attacked at 9:28. While traveling 35, 000 feet above eastern Ohio, United 93 suddenly dropped 700 \nfeet. Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio \ntransmissions from the aircraft. During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \n\"Mayday\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit. The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, \nindicated that the fight was continuing. The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\" Hey get out of here - \nget out of here - get out of here. \"  \n\n\n\nOn the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93 - 33 in addition to the 4 hijackers. This was \nbelow the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001. But there is no evidence that the hijackers \nmanipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation.  \n\nThe terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams. They initiated their \ncockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff. On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after \ntakeoff and there were only four hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, \nMohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando \nInternational Airport in August.  \n\nBecause several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered \nwhether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight. FAA rules \nallow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel. We have \nfound no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight. All the hijackers had \nassigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them. We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial \npilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once \ninside, he would not have been visible to the passengers.  \n\nAt 9:32, a hijacker, probably Jarrah, made or attempted to make the following announcement to the passengers of \nFlight 93:\"Ladies and Gentlemen:Here the captain, please sit down keep remaining sitting. We have a bomb on \nboard. So, sit. \" The flight data recorder (also recovered) indicates that Jarrah then instructed the plane's autopilot \nto turn the aircraft around and head east.  \n\nThe cockpit voice recorder data indicate that a woman, most likely a flight attendant, was being held captive in the \ncockpit. She struggled with one of the hijackers who killed or otherwise silenced her.  \n\nShortly thereafter, the passengers and flight crew began a series of calls from GTE airphones and cellular phones. \nThese calls between family, friends, and colleagues took place until the end of the flight and provided those on the \nground with firsthand accounts. They enabled the passengers to gain critical information, including the news that \ntwo aircraft had slammed into the World Trade Center.  \n\nAt 9:39, the FAA's Cleveland Air Route Traffic Control Center overheard a second announcement indicating that \nthere was a bomb on board, that the plane was returning to the airport, and that they should remain seated.   While \nit apparently was not heard by the passengers, this announcement, like those on Flight 11 and Flight 77, was \nintended to deceive them. Jarrah, like Atta earlier, may have inadvertently broadcast the message because he did \nnot know how to operate the radio and the intercom. To our knowledge none of them had ever flown an actual \nairliner before.\n\nAt least two callers from the flight reported that the hijackers knew that passengers were making calls but did not \nseem to care. It is quite possible Jarrah knew of the success of the assault on the World Trade Center. He could \nhave learned of this from messages being sent by United Airlines to the cockpits of its transcontinental flights, \nincluding Flight 93, warning of cockpit intrusion and telling of the New York attacks. But even without them, he \nwould certainly have understood that the attacks on the World Trade Center would already have unfolded, given \nFlight 93's tardy departure from Newark. If Jarrah did know that the passengers were making calls, it might not \nhave occurred to him that they were certain to learn what had happened in New York, thereby defeating his \nattempts at deception.  \n\nAt least ten passengers and two crew members shared vital information with family, friends, colleagues, or others \non the ground. All understood the plane had been hijacked. They said the hijackers wielded knives and claimed to \nhave a bomb. The hijackers were wearing red bandanas, and they forced the passengers to the back of the aircraft.  \n\nCallers reported that a passenger had been stabbed and that two people were lying on the floor of the cabin, \ninjured or dead - possibly the captain and first officer. One caller reported that a flight attendant had been killed.  \n\nOne of the callers from United 93 also reported that he thought the hijackers might possess a gun. But none of the \nother callers reported the presence of a firearm. One recipient of a call from the aircraft recounted specifically \nasking her caller whether the hijackers had guns. The passenger replied that he did not see one. No evidence of \nfirearms or of their identifiable remains was found at the aircraft's crash site, and the cockpit voice recorder gives no \n\n\n\nindication of a gun being fired or mentioned at any time. We believe that if the hijackers had possessed a gun, they \nwould have used it in the flight's last minutes as the passengers fought back.  \n\nPassengers on three flights reported the hijackers' claim of having a bomb. The FBI told us they found no trace of \nexplosives at the crash sites. One of the passengers who mentioned a bomb expressed his belief that it was not \nreal. Lacking any evidence that the hijackers attempted to smuggle such illegal items past the security screening \ncheckpoints, we believe the bombs were probably fake.  \n\nDuring at least five of the passengers' phone calls, information was shared about the attacks that had occurred \nearlier that morning at the World Trade Center. Five calls described the intent of passengers and surviving crew \nmembers to revolt against the hijackers. According to one call, they voted on whether to rush the terrorists in an \nattempt to retake the plane. They decided, and acted.  \n\nAt 9:57, the passenger assault began. Several passengers had terminated phone calls with loved ones in order to \njoin the revolt. One of the callers ended her message as follows:\"Everyone's running up to first class. I've got to go. \nBye. \"  \n\nThe cockpit voice recorder captured the sounds of the passenger assault muffled by the intervening cockpit door. \nSome family members who listened to the recording report that they can hear the voice of a loved one among the \ndin. We cannot identify whose voices can be heard. But the assault was sustained.  \n\nIn response, Jarrah immediately began to roll the airplane to the left and right, attempting to knock the passengers \noff balance. At 9:58:57, Jarrah told another hijacker in the cockpit to block the door. Jarrah continued to roll the \nairplane sharply left and right, but the assault continued. At 9:59:52, Jarrah changed tactics and pitched the nose of \nthe airplane up and down to disrupt\n\nthe assault. The recorder captured the sounds of loud thumps, crashes, shouts, and breaking glasses and plates. \nAt 10:00:03, Jarrah stabilized the airplane.  \n\nFive seconds later, Jarrah asked, \"Is that it? Shall we finish it off? \"A hijacker responded, \"No. Not yet. When they \nall come, we finish it off. \" The sounds of fighting continued outside the cockpit. Again, Jarrah pitched the nose of \nthe aircraft up and down. At 10:00:26, a passenger in the background said, \"In the cockpit. If we don't we'll die! \" \nSixteen seconds later, a passenger yelled, \"Roll it! \" Jarrah stopped the violent maneuvers at about 10:01:00 and \nsaid, \"Allah is the greatest! Allah is the greatest! \" He then asked another hijacker in the cockpit, \" Is that it? I mean, \nshall we put it down? \" to which the other replied, \"Yes, put it in it, and pull it down. \"  \n\nThe passengers continued their assault and at 10:02:23, a hijacker said, \"Pull it down! Pull it down! \"The hijackers \nremained at the controls but must have judged that the passengers were only seconds from overcoming them. The \nairplane headed down; the control wheel was turned hard to the right. The airplane rolled onto its back, and one of \nthe hijackers began shouting \"Allah is the greatest. Allah is the greatest. \"With the sounds of the passenger \ncounterattack continuing, the aircraft plowed into an empty field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, at 580 miles per hour, \nabout 20 minutes' flying time from Washington, D. C.  \n\nJarrah's objective was to crash his airliner into symbols of the American Republic, the Capitol or the White House. \nHe was defeated by the alerted, unarmed passengers of United 93.\n\n1. 2 IMPROVISING A HOMELAND DEFENSE \n\nThe FAA and NORAD \n\nOn 9/11, the defense of U. S. airspace depended on close interaction between two federal agencies: the FAA and \nthe North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). The most recent hijacking that involved U. S. air \ntraffic controllers, FAA management, and military coordination had occurred in 1993.   In order to understand how \nthe two agencies interacted eight years later, we will review their missions, command and control structures, and \nworking relationship on the morning of 9/11.\n\n\n\nFAA Mission and Structure. As of September 11, 2001, the FAA was mandated by law to regulate the safety and \nsecurity of civil aviation. From an air traffic controller's perspective, that meant maintaining a safe distance between \nairborne aircraft.  \n\nMany controllers work at the FAA's 22 Air Route Traffic Control Centers . They are grouped under regional offices \nand coordinate closely with the national Air Traffic Control System Command Center , located in Herndon, FAA Air \nTraffic Control Centers \n\n  \u2022 \n\n Reporting structure, Northeast Air Defense Sector \n\n  \u2022 \n\nGraphics courtesy of ESRI\n\nVirginia, which oversees daily traffic flow within the entire airspace system. FAA headquarters is ultimately \nresponsible for the management of the National Airspace System. The Operations Center located at FAA \nheadquarters receives notifications of incidents, including accidents and hijackings.  \n\nFAA Control Centers often receive information and make operational decisions independently of one another. On \n9/11, the four hijacked aircraft were monitored mainly by the centers in Boston, New York, Cleveland, and \nIndianapolis. Each center thus had part of the knowledge of what was going on across the system. What Boston \nknew was not necessarily known by centers in New York, Cleveland, or Indianapolis, or for that matter by the \nCommand Center in Herndon or by FAA headquarters in Washington.\n\nControllers track airliners such as the four aircraft hijacked on 9/11 primarily by watching the data from a signal \nemitted by each aircraft's transponder equipment. Those four planes, like all aircraft traveling above 10, 000 feet, \nwere required to emit a unique transponder signal while in flight.  \n\nOn 9/11, the terrorists turned off the transponders on three of the four hijacked aircraft. With its transponder off, it is \npossible, though more difficult, to track an aircraft by its primary radar returns. But unlike transponder data, primary \nradar returns do not show the aircraft's identity and altitude. Controllers at centers rely so heavily on transponder \nsignals that they usually do not display primary radar returns on their radar scopes. But they can change the \nconfiguration of their scopes so they can see primary radar returns. They did this on 9/11 when the transponder \nsignals for three of the aircraft disappeared.  \n\nBefore 9/11, it was not unheard of for a commercial aircraft to deviate slightly from its course, or for an FAA \ncontroller to lose radio contact with a pilot for a short period of time. A controller could also briefly lose a commercial \naircraft's transponder signal, although this happened much less frequently. However, the simultaneous loss of radio \nand transponder signal would be a rare and alarming occurrence, and would normally indicate a catastrophic \nsystem failure or an aircraft crash. In all of these instances, the job of the controller was to reach out to the aircraft, \nthe parent company of the aircraft, and other planes in the vicinity in an attempt to reestablish communications and \nset the aircraft back on course. Alarm bells would not start ringing until these efforts - which could take five minutes \nor more - were tried and had failed.  \n\nNORAD Mission and Structure. NORAD is a binational command established in 1958 between the United States \nand Canada. Its mission was, and is, to defend the airspace of North America and protect the continent. That \nmission does not distinguish between internal and external threats; but because NORAD was created to counter the \nSoviet threat, it came to define its job as defending against external attacks.  \n\nThe threat of Soviet bombers diminished significantly as the Cold War ended, and the number of NORAD alert sites \nwas reduced from its Cold War high of 26. Some within the Pentagon argued in the 1990s that the alert sites\n\nshould be eliminated entirely. In an effort to preserve their mission, members of the air defense community \nadvocated the importance of air sovereignty against emerging \"asymmetric threats\" to the United States: drug \n\n\n\nsmuggling, \"non-state and state-sponsored terrorists, \" and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \nballistic missile technology.  \n\nNORAD perceived the dominant threat to be from cruise missiles. Other threats were identified during the late \n1990s, including terrorists' use of aircraft as weapons. Exercises were conducted to counter this threat, but they \nwere not based on actual intelligence. In most instances, the main concern was the use of such aircraft to deliver \nweapons of mass destruction.\n\nPrior to 9/11, it was understood that an order to shoot down a commercial aircraft would have to be issued by the \nNational Command Authority (a phrase used to describe the president and secretary of defense). Exercise planners \nalso assumed that the aircraft would originate from outside the United States, allowing time to identify the target and \nscramble interceptors. The threat of terrorists hijacking commercial airliners within the United States - and using \nthem as guided missiles - was not recognized by NORAD before 9/11.  \n\nNotwithstanding the identification of these emerging threats, by 9/11 there were only seven alert sites left in the \nUnited States, each with two fighter aircraft on alert. This led some NORAD commanders to worry that NORAD was \nnot postured adequately to protect the United States.  \n\nIn the United States, NORAD is divided into three sectors. On 9/11, all the hijacked aircraft were in NORAD's \nNortheast Air Defense Sector (also known as NEADS), which is based in Rome, New York. That morning NEADS \ncould call on two alert sites, each with one pair of ready fighters: Otis Air National Guard Base in Cape Cod, \nMassachusetts, and Langley Air Force Base in Hampton, Virginia.   Other facilities, not on \"alert, \"would need time \nto arm the fighters and organize crews.\n\nNEADS reported to the Continental U. S. NORAD Region (CONR) headquarters, in Panama City, Florida, which in \nturn reported to NORAD headquarters, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.\n\nInteragency Collaboration. The FAA and NORAD had developed protocols for working together in the event of a \nhijacking. As they existed on 9/11, the protocols for the FAA to obtain military assistance from NORAD required \nmultiple levels of notification and approval at the highest levels of government.  \n\nFAA guidance to controllers on hijack procedures assumed that the aircraft pilot would notify the controller via radio \nor by \"squawking\"a transponder code of \"7500\" - the universal code for a hijack in progress. Controllers would notify \ntheir supervisors, who in turn would inform management all the way up to FAA headquarters in Washington. \nHeadquarters had a hijack coordinator, who was the director of the FAA Office of Civil Aviation Security or his or her \ndesignate.  \n\nIf a hijack was confirmed, procedures called for the hijack coordinator on\n\nduty to contact the Pentagon's National Military Command Center (NMCC) and to ask for a military escort aircraft to \nfollow the flight, report anything unusual, and aid search and rescue in the event of an emergency. The NMCC \nwould then seek approval from the Office of the Secretary of Defense to provide military assistance. If approval was \ngiven, the orders would be transmitted down NORAD's chain of command.  \n\nThe NMCC would keep the FAA hijack coordinator up to date and help the FAA centers coordinate directly with the \nmilitary. NORAD would receive tracking information for the hijacked aircraft either from joint use radar or from the \nrelevant FAA air traffic control facility. Every attempt would be made to have the hijacked aircraft squawk 7500 to \nhelp NORAD track it.  \n\nThe protocols did not contemplate an intercept. They assumed the fighter escort would be discreet, \"vectored to a \nposition five miles directly behind the hijacked aircraft, \" where it could perform its mission to monitor the aircraft's \nflight path.  \n\nIn sum, the protocols in place on 9/11 for the FAA and NORAD to respond to a hijacking presumed that\n\n     *  the hijacked aircraft would be readily identifiable and would not\n\n        attempt to disappear;\n\n\n\n     *  there would be time to address the problem through the appropriate\n\n        FAA and NORAD chains of command; and\n\n     *  the hijacking would take the traditional form: that is, it would\n\n        not be a suicide hijacking designed to convert the aircraft into a\n\n        guided missile.\n\nOn the morning of 9/11, the existing protocol was unsuited in every respect for what was about to happen.\n\nAmerican Airlines Flight 11 \n\nFAA Awareness. Although the Boston Center air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was \nsomething wrong with American 11, he did not immediately interpret the plane's failure to respond as a sign that it \nhad been hijacked. At 8:14, when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to 35, 000 feet, the controller \nrepeatedly tried to raise the flight. He reached out to the pilot on the emergency frequency. Though there was no \nresponse, he kept trying to contact the aircraft.  \n\nAt 8:21, American 11 turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft. \nThe controller told his supervisor that he thought something was seriously wrong with the plane, although neither \nsuspected a hijacking. The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a \"no \nradio\" aircraft.  \n\nThe controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11. He became \neven more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace. Controllers immediately began \nto move aircraft out of its path, and asked other aircraft in the vicinity to look for American 11.  \n\nAt 8:24:38, the following transmission came from American 11:\n\n        American 11: We have some planes. Just stay quiet, and you'll\n\n        be okay. We are returning to the airport.\n\nThe controller only heard something unintelligible; he did not hear the specific words \"we have some planes. \" The \nnext transmission came seconds later:\n\n        American 11: Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If you\n\n        try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane.\n\n        Just stay quiet. \n\n        \n\nThe controller told us that he then knew it was a hijacking. He alerted his supervisor, who assigned another \ncontroller to assist him. He redoubled his efforts to ascertain the flight's altitude. Because the controller didn't \nunderstand the initial transmission, the manager of Boston Center instructed his quality assurance specialist to \"pull \nthe tape\" of the radio transmission, listen to it closely, and report back.  \n\nBetween 8:25 and 8:32, in accordance with the FAA protocol, Boston Center managers started notifying their chain \nof command that American 11 had been hijacked. At 8:28, Boston Center called the Command Center in Herndon \nto advise that it believed American 11 had been hijacked and was heading toward New York Center's airspace.\n\nBy this time, American 11 had taken a dramatic turn to the south. At 8:32, the Command Center passed word of a \npossible hijacking to the Operations Center at FAA headquarters. The duty officer replied that security personnel at \nheadquarters had just begun discussing the apparent hijack on a conference call with the New England regional \noffice. FAA headquarters began to follow the hijack protocol but did not contact the NMCC to request a fighter \nescort.  \n\n\n\nThe Herndon Command Center immediately established a teleconference between Boston, New York, and \nCleveland Centers so that Boston Center could help the others understand what was happening.  \n\nAt 8:34, the Boston Center controller received a third transmission from American 11:\n\n        American 11: Nobody move please. We are going back to the\n\n        airport. Don't try to make any stupid moves.\n\n        \n\n        \n\nIn the succeeding minutes, controllers were attempting to ascertain the altitude of the southbound flight.  \n\nMilitary Notification and Response. Boston Center did not follow the protocol in seeking military assistance \nthrough the prescribed chain of command. In addition to notifications within the FAA, Boston Center took the \ninitiative, at 8:34, to contact the military through the FAA's Cape Cod facility. The center also tried to contact a \nformer alert site in Atlantic City, unaware it had been phased out. At 8:37:52, Boston Center reached NEADS. This \nwas the first notification received by the military - at any level - that American 11 had been hijacked:  \n\n        FAA: Hi. Boston Center TMU [Traffic Management Unit], we\n\n        have a problem here. We have a hijacked aircraft headed towards New\n\n        York, and we need you guys to, we need someone to scramble some\n\n        F-16s or something up there, help us out.\n\n        NEADS: Is this real-world or exercise?\n\n        FAA: No, this is not an exercise, not a test.\n\n        \n\n        \n\nNEADS ordered to battle stations the two F-15 alert aircraft at Otis Air Force Base in Falmouth, Massachusetts, 153 \nmiles away from New York City. The air defense of America began with this call.  \n\nAt NEADS, the report of the hijacking was relayed immediately to Battle Commander Colonel Robert Marr. After \nordering the Otis fighters to battle stations, Colonel Marr phoned Major General Larry Arnold, commanding general \nof the First Air Force and NORAD's Continental Region. Marr sought authorization to scramble the Otis fighters. \nGeneral Arnold later recalled instructing Marr to \"go ahead and scramble them, and we'll get authorities later. \" \nGeneral Arnold then called NORAD headquarters to report.  \n\nF-15 fighters were scrambled at 8:46 from Otis Air Force Base. But NEADS did not know where to send the alert \nfighter aircraft, and the officer directing the fighters pressed for more information:\"I don't know where I'm scrambling \nthese guys to. I need a direction, a destination. \" Because the hijackers had turned off the plane's transponder, \nNEADS personnel spent the next minutes searching their radar scopes for the primary radar return. American 11 \nstruck the North Tower at 8:46. Shortly after 8:50, while NEADS personnel were still trying to locate the flight, word \nreached them that a plane had hit the World Trade Center.  \n\nRadar data show the Otis fighters were airborne at 8:53. Lacking a target, they were vectored toward military-\ncontrolled airspace off the Long Island coast. To avoid New York area air traffic and uncertain about what to do, the \nfighters were brought down to military airspace to \"hold as needed. \"From 9:09 to 9:13, the Otis fighters stayed in \nthis holding pattern.  \n\nIn summary, NEADS received notice of the hijacking nine minutes before it struck the North Tower. That nine \nminutes' notice before impact was the most the military would receive of any of the four hijackings.  \n\n\n\nUnited Airlines Flight 175 \n\nFAA Awareness. One of the last transmissions from United Airlines Flight 175 is, in retrospect, chilling. By 8:40, \ncontrollers at the FAA's New York Center were seeking information on American 11. At approximately 8:42, shortly \nafter entering New York Center's airspace, the pilot of United 175 broke in with the following transmission:\n\n        UAL 175: New York UAL 175 heavy.\n\n        FAA: UAL 175 go ahead.\n\n        UAL 175: Yeah. We figured we'd wait to go to your center. Ah,\n\n        we heard a suspicious transmission on our departure out of Boston,\n\n        ah, with someone, ah, it sounded like someone keyed the mikes and\n\n        said ah everyone ah stay in your seats.\n\n        FAA: Oh, okay. I'll pass that along over here.\n\n        \n\n        \n\nMinutes later, United 175 turned southwest without clearance from air traffic control. At 8:47, seconds after the \nimpact of American 11, United 175's transponder code changed, and then changed again. These changes were not \nnoticed for several minutes, however, because the same New York Center controller was assigned to both \nAmerican 11 and United 175. The controller knew American 11 was hijacked; he was focused on searching for it \nafter the aircraft disappeared at 8:46.  \n\nAt 8:48, while the controller was still trying to locate American 11, a New York Center manager provided the \nfollowing report on a Command Center teleconference about American 11:\n\n        Manager, New York Center: Okay. This is New York Center.\n\n        We're watching the airplane. I also had conversation with American\n\n        Airlines, and they've told us that they believe that one of their\n\n        stewardesses was stabbed and that there are people in the cockpit\n\n        that have control of the aircraft, and that's all the information\n\n        they have right now. \n\n        \n\nThe New York Center controller and manager were unaware that American 11 had already crashed.\n\nAt 8:51, the controller noticed the transponder change from United 175 and tried to contact the aircraft. There was \nno response. Beginning at 8:52, the controller made repeated attempts to reach the crew of United 175. Still no \nresponse. The controller checked his radio equipment and contacted another\n\ncontroller at 8:53, saying that \"we may have a hijack\" and that he could not find the aircraft.  \n\nAnother commercial aircraft in the vicinity then radioed in with \"reports over the radio of a commuter plane hitting \nthe World Trade Center. \"The controller spent the next several minutes handing off the other flights on his scope to \nother controllers and moving aircraft out of the way of the unidentified aircraft (believed to be United 175) as it \nmoved southwest and then turned northeast toward New York City.  \n\nAt about 8:55, the controller in charge notified a New York Center manager that she believed United 175 had also \nbeen hijacked. The manager tried to notify the regional managers and was told that they were discussing a hijacked \n\n\n\naircraft (presumably American 11) and refused to be disturbed. At 8:58, the New York Center controller searching \nfor United 175 told another New York controller \"we might have a hijack over here, two of them. \"  \n\nBetween 9:01 and 9:02, a manager from New York Center told the Command Center in Herndon:\n\n        Manager, New York Center: We have several situations going on\n\n        here. It's escalating big, big time. We need to get the military\n\n        involved with us. . . . We're, we're involved with something else,\n\n        we have other aircraft that may have a similar situation going on\n\n        here. \n\n        \n\nThe \"other aircraft\" referred to by New York Center was United 175. Evidence indicates that this conversation was \nthe only notice received by either FAA headquarters or the Herndon Command Center prior to the second crash \nthat there had been a second hijacking.\n\nWhile the Command Center was told about this \"other aircraft\" at 9:01, New York Center contacted New York \nterminal approach control and asked for help in locating United 175.\n\n        Terminal: I got somebody who keeps coasting but it looks\n\n        like he's going into one of the small airports down there.\n\n        Center: Hold on a second. I'm trying to bring him up here\n\n        and get you - There he is right there. Hold on.\n\n        Terminal: Got him just out of 9, 500 - 9, 000 now.\n\n        Center: Do you know who he is?\n\n        Terminal: We're just, we just we don't know who he is. We're\n\n        just picking him up now.\n\n        Center (at 9:02): Alright. Heads up man, it looks like\n\n        another one coming in.\n\n        \n\n        \n\nThe controllers observed the plane in a rapid descent; the radar data terminated over Lower Manhattan. At 9:03, \nUnited 175 crashed into the South Tower.  \n\nMeanwhile, a manager from Boston Center reported that they had deciphered what they had heard in one of the \nfirst hijacker transmissions from American 11:\n\n        Boston Center: Hey . . . you still there?\n\n        New England Region: Yes, I am.\n\n        Boston Center: . . . as far as the tape, Bobby seemed to\n\n        think the guy said that \"we have planes. \"Now, I don't know if it\n\n        was because it was the accent, or if there's more than one, but I'm\n\n        gonna, I'm gonna reconfirm that for you, and I'll get back to you\n\n        real quick. Okay?\n\n        New England Region: Appreciate it.\n\n\n\n        Unidentified Female Voice: They have what?\n\n        Boston Center: Planes, as in plural.\n\n        Boston Center: It sounds like, we're talking to New York,\n\n        that there's another one aimed at the World Trade Center.\n\n        New England Region: There's another aircraft?\n\n        Boston Center: A second one just hit the Trade Center.\n\n        New England Region: Okay. Yeah, we gotta get - we gotta\n\n        alert the military real quick on this.\n\n        \n\n        \n\nBoston Center immediately advised the New England Region that it was going to stop all departures at airports \nunder its control. At 9:05, Boston Center confirmed for both the FAA Command Center and the New England \nRegion that the hijackers aboard American 11 said \"we have planes . \" At the same time, New York Center \ndeclared \"ATC zero\" - meaning that aircraft were not permitted to depart from, arrive at, or travel through New York \nCenter's airspace until further notice.  \n\nWithin minutes of the second impact, Boston Center instructed its controllers to inform all aircraft in its airspace of \nthe events in New York and to advise aircraft to heighten cockpit security. Boston Center asked the Herndon \nCommand Center to issue a similar cockpit security alert nationwide. We have found no evidence to suggest that \nthe Command Center acted on this request or issued any type of cockpit security alert.  \n\nMilitary Notification and Response. The first indication that the NORAD air defenders had of the second hijacked \naircraft, United 175, came in a phone call from New York Center to NEADS at 9:03. The notice came at about the \ntime the plane was hitting the South Tower.  \n\nBy 9:08, the mission crew commander at NEADS learned of the second explosion at the World Trade Center and \ndecided against holding the fighters in military airspace away from Manhattan:\n\n        Mission Crew Commander, NEADS: This is what I foresee that\n\n        we probably need to do. We need to talk to FAA. We need to tell 'em\n\n        if\n\n        this stuff is gonna keep on going, we need to take those fighters,\n\n        put 'em over Manhattan. That's best thing, that's the best play\n\n        right now. So coordinate with the FAA. Tell 'em if there's more out\n\n        there, which we don't know, let's get 'em over Manhattan. At least\n\n        we got some kind of play.\n\n        \n\n        \n\nThe FAA cleared the airspace. Radar data show that at 9:13, when the Otis fighters were about 115 miles away \nfrom the city, the fighters exited their holding pattern and set a course direct for Manhattan. They arrived at 9:25 \nand established a combat air patrol (CAP) over the city.  \n\nBecause the Otis fighters had expended a great deal of fuel in flying first to military airspace and then to New York, \nthe battle commanders were concerned about refueling. NEADS considered scrambling alert fighters from Langley \n\n\n\nAir Force Base in Virginia to New York, to provide backup. The Langley fighters were placed on battle stations at \n9:09.   NORAD had no indication that any other plane had been hijacked.\n\nAmerican Airlines Flight 77 \n\nFAA Awareness. American 77 began deviating from its flight plan at 8:54, with a slight turn toward the south. Two \nminutes later, it disappeared completely from radar at Indianapolis Center, which was controlling the flight.  \n\nThe controller tracking American 77 told us he noticed the aircraft turning to the southwest, and then saw the data \ndisappear. The controller looked for primary radar returns. He searched along the plane's projected flight path and \nthe airspace to the southwest where it had started to turn. No primary targets appeared. He tried the radios, first \ncalling the aircraft directly, then the airline. Again there was nothing. At this point, the Indianapolis controller had no \nknowledge of the situation in New York. He did not know that other aircraft had been hijacked. He believed \nAmerican 77 had experienced serious electrical or mechanical failure, or both, and was gone.  \n\nShortly after 9:00, Indianapolis Center started notifying other agencies that American 77 was missing and had \npossibly crashed. At 9:08, Indianapolis Center asked Air Force Search and Rescue at Langley Air Force Base to \nlook for a downed aircraft. The center also contacted the West Virginia State Police and asked whether any reports \nof a downed aircraft had been received. At 9:09, it reported the loss of contact to the FAA regional center, which \npassed this information to FAA headquarters at 9:24.  \n\nBy 9:20, Indianapolis Center learned that there were other hijacked aircraft, and began to doubt its initial \nassumption that American 77 had crashed. A discussion of this concern between the manager at Indianapolis and \nthe Command Center in Herndon prompted it to notify some FAA field facilities that American 77 was lost. By 9:21, \nthe Command Center, some FAA field facilities, and American Airlines had started to search for American 77. They \nfeared\n\nit had been hijacked. At 9:25, the Command Center advised FAA headquarters of the situation.  \n\nThe failure to find a primary radar return for American 77 led us to investigate this issue further. Radar \nreconstructions performed after 9/11 reveal that FAA radar equipment tracked the flight from the moment its \ntransponder was turned off at 8:56. But for 8 minutes and 13 seconds, between 8:56 and 9:05, this primary radar \ninformation on American 77 was not displayed to controllers at Indianapolis Center.   The reasons are technical, \narising from the way the software processed radar information, as well as from poor primary radar coverage where \nAmerican 77 was flying.\n\nAccording to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar \nscopes at 9:05, east of its last known position. The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six \nminutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center \ncontinued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the \nwest and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east - where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did \nnot instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for \nAmerican 77.  \n\nIn sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, \ncontrollers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward \nthe west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an \nall points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 \nminutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D. C.  \n\nBy 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World \nTrade Center. They knew American 77 was lost. At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England \nRegion knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said \"we have some planes. \" Concerns over the safety of \nother aircraft began to mount. A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted \n\n\n\nto order a \"nationwide ground stop. \" While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters, the \nCommand Center ordered one at 9:25.  \n\nThe Command Center kept looking for American 77. At 9:21, it advised the Dulles terminal control facility, and \nDulles urged its controllers to look for primary targets. At 9:32, they found one. Several of the Dulles controllers \n\"observed a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed\"and notified Reagan National Airport. \nFAA personnel at both Reagan National and Dulles airports notified the Secret Service. The aircraft's identity or \ntype was unknown.  \n\nReagan National controllers then vectored an unarmed National Guard C- 130H cargo aircraft, which had just taken \noff en route to Minnesota, to iden-\n\ntify and follow the suspicious aircraft. The C-130H pilot spotted it, identified it as a Boeing 757, attempted to follow \nits path, and at 9:38, seconds after impact, reported to the control tower:\"looks like that aircraft crashed into the \nPentagon sir. \"  \n\nMilitary Notification and Response. NORAD heard nothing about the search for American 77. Instead, the \nNEADS air defenders heard renewed reports about a plane that no longer existed:American 11.\n\nAt 9:21, NEADS received a report from the FAA:\n\n        FAA: Military, Boston Center. I just had a report that\n\n        American 11 is still in the air, and it's on its way towards -\n\n        heading towards Washington.\n\n        NEADS: Okay. American 11 is still in the air?\n\n        FAA: Yes.\n\n        NEADS: On its way towards Washington?\n\n        FAA: That was another - it was evidently another aircraft\n\n        that hit the tower. That's the latest report we have.\n\n        NEADS: Okay.\n\n        FAA: I'm going to try to confirm an ID for you, but I would\n\n        assume he's somewhere over, uh, either New Jersey or somewhere\n\n        further south.\n\n        NEADS: Okay. So American 11 isn't the hijack at all then,\n\n        right?\n\n        FAA: No, he is a hijack.\n\n        NEADS: He - American 11 is a hijack?\n\n        FAA: Yes.\n\n        NEADS: And he's heading into Washington?\n\n        FAA: Yes. This could be a third aircraft.\n\n        \n\n        \n\nThe mention of a \"third aircraft\"was not a reference to American 77. There was confusion at that moment in the \nFAA. Two planes had struck the World Trade Center, and Boston Center had heard from FAA headquarters in \n\n\n\nWashington that American 11 was still airborne. We have been unable to identify the source of this mistaken FAA \ninformation.\n\nThe NEADS technician who took this call from the FAA immediately passed the word to the mission crew \ncommander, who reported to the NEADS battle commander:\n\n        Mission Crew Commander, NEADS: Okay, uh, American Airlines\n\n        is still airborne. Eleven, the first guy, he's heading towards\n\n        Washington. Okay? I think we need to scramble Langley right now.\n\n        And I'm gonna take the fighters from Otis, try to chase this guy\n\n        down if I can find him.\n\n        \n\n        \n\nAfter consulting with NEADS command, the crew commander issued the order at 9:23:\"Okay . . . scramble Langley. \nHead them towards the Washington area. . . . [I]f they're there then we'll run on them. . . . These guys are smart. \" \nThat order was processed and transmitted to Langley Air Force Base at 9:24. Radar data show the Langley fighters \nairborne at 9:30. NEADS decided to keep the Otis fighters over New York. The heading of the Langley fighters was \nadjusted to send them to the Baltimore area. The mission crew commander explained to us that the purpose was to \nposition the Langley fighters between the reported southbound American 11 and the nation's capital.  \n\nAt the suggestion of the Boston Center's military liaison, NEADS contacted the FAA's Washington Center to ask \nabout American 11. In the course of the conversation, a Washington Center manager informed NEADS:\"We're \nlooking - we also lost American 77. \"The time was 9:34.   This was the first notice to the military that American 77 \nwas missing, and it had come by chance. If NEADS had not placed that call, the NEADS air defenders would have \nreceived no information whatsoever that the flight was even missing, although the FAA had been searching for it. \nNo one at FAA headquarters ever asked for military assistance with American 77.\n\nAt 9:36, the FAA's Boston Center called NEADS and relayed the discovery about an unidentified aircraft closing in \non Washington:\"Latest report. Aircraft VFR [visual flight rules] six miles southeast of the White House. . . . Six, \nsouthwest. Six, southwest of the White House, deviating away. \" This startling news prompted the mission crew \ncommander at NEADS to take immediate control of the airspace to clear a flight path for the Langley fighters:\"Okay, \nwe're going to turn it . . . crank it up. . . . Run them to the White House. \" He then discovered, to his surprise, that \nthe Langley fighters were not headed north toward the Baltimore area as instructed, but east over the ocean. \"I \ndon't care how many windows you break, \" he said. \"Damn it. . . . Okay. Push them back. \"  \n\nThe Langley fighters were heading east, not north, for three reasons. First, unlike a normal scramble order, this \norder did not include a distance to the target or the target's location. Second, a \"generic\" flight plan - prepared to get \nthe aircraft airborne and out of local airspace quickly - incorrectly led the Langley fighters to believe they were \nordered to fly due east (090) for 60 miles. Third, the lead pilot and local FAA controller incorrectly assumed the flight \nplan instruction to go \"090 for 60\" superseded the original scramble order.  \n\nAfter the 9:36 call to NEADS about the unidentified aircraft a few miles from the White House, the Langley fighters \nwere ordered to Washington, D. C. Controllers at NEADS located an unknown primary radar track, but \"it kind of \nfaded\" over Washington. The time was 9:38. The Pentagon had been struck by American 77 at 9:37:46. The \nLangley fighters were about 150 miles away.  \n\nRight after the Pentagon was hit, NEADS learned of another possible hijacked aircraft. It was an aircraft that in fact \nhad not been hijacked at all. After the second World Trade Center crash, Boston Center managers recognized that\n\nboth aircraft were transcontinental 767 jetliners that had departed Logan Airport. Remembering the \"we have some \nplanes\" remark, Boston Center guessed that Delta 1989 might also be hijacked. Boston Center called NEADS at \n9:41 and identified Delta 1989, a 767 jet that had left Logan Airport for Las Vegas, as a possible hijack. NEADS \nwarned the FAA's Cleveland Center to watch Delta 1989. The Command Center and FAA headquarters watched it \n\n\n\ntoo. During the course of the morning, there were multiple erroneous reports of hijacked aircraft. The report of \nAmerican 11 heading south was the first; Delta 1989 was the second.  \n\nNEADS never lost track of Delta 1989, and even ordered fighter aircraft from Ohio and Michigan to intercept it. The \nflight never turned off its transponder. NEADS soon learned that the aircraft was not hijacked, and tracked Delta \n1989 as it reversed course over Toledo, headed east, and landed in Cleveland.   But another aircraft was heading \ntoward Washington, an aircraft about which NORAD had heard nothing: United 93.\n\nUnited Airlines Flight 93 \n\nFAA Awareness. At 9:27, after having been in the air for 45 minutes, United 93 acknowledged a transmission from \nthe Cleveland Center controller. This was the last normal contact the FAA had with the flight.  \n\nLess than a minute later, the Cleveland controller and the pilots of aircraft in the vicinity heard \"a radio transmission \nof unintelligible sounds of possible screaming or a struggle from an unknown origin. \"  \n\nThe controller responded, seconds later: \"Somebody call Cleveland? \"This was followed by a second radio \ntransmission, with sounds of screaming. The Cleveland Center controllers began to try to identify the possible \nsource of the transmissions, and noticed that United 93 had descended some 700 feet. The controller attempted \nagain to raise United 93 several times, with no response. At 9:30, the controller began to poll the other flights on his \nfrequency to determine if they had heard the screaming; several said they had.  \n\nAt 9:32, a third radio transmission came over the frequency:\"Keep remaining sitting. We have a bomb on board. \n\"The controller understood, but chose to respond: \"Calling Cleveland Center, you're unreadable. Say again, slowly. \n\" He notified his supervisor, who passed the notice up the chain of command. By 9:34, word of the hijacking had \nreached FAA headquarters.  \n\nFAA headquarters had by this time established an open line of communication with the Command Center at \nHerndon and instructed it to poll all its centers about suspect aircraft. The Command Center executed the request \nand, a minute later, Cleveland Center reported that \"United 93 may have a bomb on board. \"At 9:34, the Command \nCenter relayed the information concerning United 93 to FAA headquarters. At approximately 9:36, Cleveland \nadvised the Command Center that it was still tracking United 93 and specifically inquired whether someone had \nrequested the military to launch fighter aircraft to intercept the aircraft. Cleveland even told the Command Center it \nwas prepared to\n\ncontact a nearby military base to make the request. The Command Center told Cleveland that FAA personnel well \nabove them in the chain of command had to make the decision to seek military assistance and were working on the \nissue.  \n\nBetween 9:34 and 9:38, the Cleveland controller observed United 93 climbing to 40, 700 feet and immediately \nmoved several aircraft out its way. The controller continued to try to contact United 93, and asked whether the pilot \ncould confirm that he had been hijacked.   There was no response.\n\nThen, at 9:39, a fourth radio transmission was heard from United 93:\n\n        Ziad Jarrah: Uh, this is the captain. Would like you all to\n\n        remain seated. There is a bomb on board and are going back to the\n\n        airport, and to have our demands [unintelligible]. Please remain\n\n        quiet.\n\nThe controller responded: \"United 93, understand you have a bomb on board. Go ahead. \"The flight did not \nrespond.  \n\nFrom 9:34 to 10:08, a Command Center facility manager provided frequent updates to Acting Deputy Administrator \nMonte Belger and other executives at FAA headquarters as United 93 headed toward Washington, D. C. At 9:41, \n\n\n\nCleveland Center lost United 93's transponder signal. The controller located it on primary radar, matched its \nposition with visual sightings from other aircraft, and tracked the flight as it turned east, then south.  \n\nAt 9:42, the Command Center learned from news reports that a plane had struck the Pentagon. The Command \nCenter's national operations manager, Ben Sliney, ordered all FAA facilities to instruct all aircraft to land at the \nnearest airport. This was an unprecedented order. The air traffic control system handled it with great skill, as about \n4, 500 commercial and general aviation aircraft soon landed without incident.  \n\nAt 9:46 the Command Center updated FAA headquarters that United 93 was now \"twenty-nine minutes out of \nWashington, D. C. \"\n\nAt 9:49, 13 minutes after Cleveland Center had asked about getting military help, the Command Center suggested \nthat someone at headquarters should decide whether to request military assistance:\n\n        FAA Headquarters: They're pulling Jeff away to go talk about\n\n        United 93.\n\n        Command Center: Uh, do we want to think, uh, about\n\n        scrambling aircraft?\n\n        FAA Headquarters: Oh, God, I don't know.\n\n        Command Center: Uh, that's a decision somebody's gonna have\n\n        to make probably in the next ten minutes.\n\n        FAA Headquarters: Uh, ya know everybody just left the room.\n\n         \n\n        \n\nAt 9:53, FAA headquarters informed the Command Center that the deputy director for air traffic services was talking \nto Monte Belger about scrambling\n\naircraft. Then the Command Center informed headquarters that controllers had lost track of United 93 over the \nPittsburgh area. Within seconds, the Command Center received a visual report from another aircraft, and informed \nheadquarters that the aircraft was 20 miles northwest of Johnstown. United 93 was spotted by another aircraft, and, \nat 10:01, the Command Center advised FAA headquarters that one of the aircraft had seen United 93 \"waving his \nwings. \" The aircraft had witnessed the hijackers' efforts to defeat the passengers' counterattack.  \n\nUnited 93 crashed in Pennsylvania at 10:03:11, 125 miles from Washington, D. C. The precise crash time has been \nthe subject of some dispute. The 10:03:11 impact time is supported by previous National Transportation Safety \nBoard analysis and by evidence from the Commission staff 's analysis of radar, the flight data recorder, the cockpit \nvoice recorder, infrared satellite data, and air traffic control transmissions.  \n\nFive minutes later, the Command Center forwarded this update to headquarters:\n\n        Command Center: O. K. Uh, there is now on that United 93.\n\n        FAA Headquarters: Yes.\n\n        Command Center: There is a report of black smoke in the last\n\n        position I gave you, fifteen miles south of Johnstown.\n\n        FAA Headquarters: From the airplane or from the ground?\n\n        Command Center: Uh, they're speculating it's from the\n\n        aircraft.\n\n        FAA Headquarters: Okay.\n\n        Command Center: Uh, who, it hit the ground. That's what\n\n\n\n        they're speculating, that's speculation only.\n\n        \n\n        \n\nThe aircraft that spotted the \"black smoke\" was the same unarmed Air National Guard cargo plane that had seen \nAmerican 77 crash into the Pentagon 27 minutes earlier. It had resumed its flight to Minnesota and saw the smoke \nfrom the crash of United 93, less than two minutes after the plane went down. At 10:17, the Command Center \nadvised headquarters of its conclusion that United 93 had indeed crashed.  \n\nDespite the discussions about military assistance, no one from FAA headquarters requested military assistance \nregarding United 93. Nor did any manager at FAA headquarters pass any of the information it had about United 93 \nto the military.\n\nMilitary Notification and Response. NEADS first received a call about United 93 from the military liaison at \nCleveland Center at 10:07. Unaware that the aircraft had already crashed, Cleveland passed to NEADS the \naircraft's last known latitude and longitude. NEADS was never able to locate United 93 on radar because it was \nalready in the ground.  \n\nAt the same time, the NEADS mission crew commander was dealing with the arrival of the Langley fighters over \nWashington, D. C. , sorting out what their orders were with respect to potential targets. Shortly after 10:10, and \nhaving no knowledge either that United 93 had been heading toward Washington or that it had crashed, he explicitly \ninstructed the Langley fighters: \"negative - negative clearance to shoot\" aircraft over the nation's capital.  \n\nThe news of a reported bomb on board United 93 spread quickly at NEADS. The air defenders searched for United \n93's primary radar return and tried to locate other fighters to scramble. NEADS called Washington Center to report:\n\n        NEADS: I also want to give you a heads-up, Washington.\n\n        FAA (DC): Go ahead.\n\n        NEADS: United nine three, have you got information on that\n\n        yet?\n\n        FAA: Yeah, he's down.\n\n        NEADS: He's down?\n\n        FAA: Yes.\n\n        NEADS: When did he land? 'Cause we have got confirmation -\n\n        FAA: He did not land.\n\n        NEADS: Oh, he's down? Down?\n\n        FAA: Yes. Somewhere up northeast of Camp David.\n\n        NEADS: Northeast of Camp David.\n\n        FAA: That's the last report. They don't know exactly where.\n\n         \n\n        \n\n        The time of notification of the crash of United 93 was 10:15.\n\n        \n\n         The NEADS air\n\n        defenders never located the flight or followed it on their radar\n\n\n\n        scopes. The flight had already crashed by the time they learned it\n\n        was hijacked.\n\nClarifying the Record \n\nThe defense of U. S. airspace on 9/11 was not conducted in accord with preexisting training and protocols. It was \nimprovised by civilians who had never handled a hijacked aircraft that attempted to disappear, and by a military \nunprepared for the transformation of commercial aircraft into weapons of mass destruction. As it turned out, the \nNEADS air defenders had nine minutes' notice on the first hijacked plane, no advance notice on the second, no \nadvance notice on the third, and no advance notice on the fourth.\n\nWe do not believe that the true picture of that morning reflects discredit on the operational personnel at NEADS or \nFAA facilities. NEADS commanders and officers actively sought out information, and made the best judgments they \ncould on the basis of what they knew. Individual FAA controllers, facility managers, and Command Center \nmanagers thought outside the box in recommending a nationwide alert, in ground-stopping local traffic, and, \nultimately, in deciding to land all aircraft and executing that unprecedented order flawlessly. American Airlines \nFlight 11 (AA 11)  Boston to Los Angeles\n\n  \u2022 \n\n United Airlines Flight 175 (UA 175)  Boston to Los Angeles\n\n  \u2022 \n\n American Airlines Flight 77 (AA 77)  W ashington, D. C. , to Los Angeles\n\n  \u2022 \n\n United Airlines Flight 93 (UA 93)  Newark to San Francisco\n\n  \u2022 \n\nMore than the actual events, inaccurate government accounts of those events made it appear that the military was \nnotified in time to respond to two of the hijackings, raising questions about the adequacy of the response. Those \naccounts had the effect of deflecting questions about the military's capacity to obtain timely and accurate \ninformation from its own sources. In addition, they overstated the FAA's ability to provide the military with timely and \nuseful information that morning.\n\nIn public testimony before this Commission in May 2003, NORAD officials stated that at 9:16, NEADS received \nhijack notification of United 93 from the FAA.   This statement was incorrect. There was no hijack to report at 9:16. \nUnited 93 was proceeding normally at that time.\n\nIn this same public testimony, NORAD officials stated that at 9:24, NEADS received notification of the hijacking of \nAmerican 77.   This statement was also incorrect. The notice NEADS received at 9:24 was that American 11 had \nnot hit the World Trade Center and was heading for Washington, D. C.  \n\nIn their testimony and in other public accounts, NORAD officials also stated that the Langley fighters were \nscrambled to respond to the notifications about American 77,   United 93, or both. These statements were incorrect \nas well. The fighters were scrambled because of the report that American 11 was heading south, as is clear not just \nfrom taped conversations at NEADS but also from taped conversations at FAA centers; contemporaneous logs \ncompiled at NEADS, Continental Region headquarters, and NORAD; and other records. Yet this response to a \nphantom aircraft was not recounted in a single public timeline or statement issued by the FAA or Department of \nDefense. The inaccurate accounts created the impression that the Langley scramble was a logical response to an \nactual hijacked aircraft.\n\nIn fact, not only was the scramble prompted by the mistaken information about American 11, but NEADS never \nreceived notice that American 77 was hijacked. It was notified at 9:34 that American 77 was lost. Then, minutes \nlater, NEADS was told that an unknown plane was 6 miles southwest of the White House. Only then did the already \nscrambled airplanes start moving directly toward Washington, D. C.\n\n\n\nThus the military did not have 14 minutes to respond to American 77, as testimony to the Commission in May 2003 \nsuggested. It had at most one or two minutes to react to the unidentified plane approaching Washington, and the \nfighters were in the wrong place to be able to help. They had been responding to a report about an aircraft that did \nnot exist.\n\nNor did the military have 47 minutes to respond to United 93, as would be implied by the account that it received \nnotice of the flight's hijacking at 9:16. By the time the military learned about the flight, it had crashed.\n\nWe now turn to the role of national leadership in the events that morning.\n\n1. 3 NATIONAL CRISIS MANAGEMENT \n\nWhen American 11 struck the World Trade Center at 8:46, no one in the White House or traveling with the \nPresident knew that it had been hijacked. While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence \nthat the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46.  \n\nMost federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN.   Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane \nGarvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from \ntelevision that a plane had crashed.   Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter.\n\nInside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying \nsenior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA \noperations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling \nof jets was not discussed.  \n\nIn Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where \nPresident Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he \nwas standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first \ninformed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction \nwas that the incident must have been caused by pilot error.  \n\nAt 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who \nwas at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft - and then a commercial \naircraft - that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \"that's all we know right now, Mr. President. \"  \n\nAt the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn \non his television because a plane had struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was \nwondering \"how the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South \nTower.  \n\nElsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the \ncrash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their \nregular schedules.  \n\nThe Agencies Confer \n\nWhen they learned a second plane had struck the World Trade Center, nearly everyone in the White House told us, \nthey immediately knew it was not an accident. The Secret Service initiated a number of security enhancements\n\naround the White House complex. The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional \nhijacked aircraft, or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington. These measures were precautionary steps \ntaken because of the strikes in New York.  \n\nThe FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each \ninitiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences - at least before 10:00 - \n\n\n\nincluded the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully \ncoordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings.\n\nAt about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, \nincluding the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only \nperiodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The \nFAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon \nwas hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of \n9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been \non the call.  \n\nAt the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special \nassistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the \nCIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and \nCIA joined at 9:40. The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference - at about 9:40 - was the \nphysical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies. Immediately thereafter it was reported \nthat a plane had hit the Pentagon. We found no evidence that video teleconference participants had any prior \ninformation that American 77 had been hijacked and was heading directly toward Washington. Indeed, it is not clear \nto us that the video teleconference was fully under way before 9:37, when the Pentagon was struck.  \n\nGarvey, Belger, and other senior officials from FAA headquarters participated in this video teleconference at various \ntimes. We do not know who from Defense participated, but we know that in the first hour none of the personnel \ninvolved in managing the crisis did. And none of the information conveyed in the White House video teleconference, \nat least in the first hour, was being passed to the NMCC. As one witness recalled, \"[It] was almost like there were \nparallel decisionmaking processes going on; one was a voice conference orchestrated by the NMCC . . . and then \nthere was the [White House video teleconference]. . . . [I]n my mind they were competing venues for command and \ncontrol and decisionmaking. \"  \n\nAt 10:03, the conference received reports of more missing aircraft, \"2 pos-\n\nsibly 3 aloft, \" and learned of a combat air patrol over Washington. There was discussion of the need for rules of \nengagement. Clarke reported that they were asking the President for authority to shoot down aircraft. Confirmation \nof that authority came at 10:25, but the commands were already being conveyed in more direct contacts with the \nPentagon.  \n\nThe Pentagon Teleconferences. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director for operations \nimmediately thought the second strike was a terrorist attack. The job of the NMCC in such an emergency is to \ngather the relevant parties and establish the chain of command between the National Command Authority - the \npresident and the secretary of defense - and those who need to carry out their orders.  \n\nOn the morning of September 11, Secretary Rumsfeld was having breakfast at the Pentagon with a group of \nmembers of Congress. He then returned to his office for his daily intelligence briefing. The Secretary was informed \nof the second strike in New York during the briefing; he resumed the briefing while awaiting more information. After \nthe Pentagon was struck, Secretary Rumsfeld went to the parking lot to assist with rescue efforts.  \n\nInside the NMCC, the deputy director for operations called for an allpurpose \"significant event\" conference. It began \nat 9:29, with a brief recap: two aircraft had struck the World Trade Center, there was a confirmed hijacking of \nAmerican 11, and Otis fighters had been scrambled. The FAA was asked to provide an update, but the line was \nsilent because the FAA had not been added to the call. A minute later, the deputy director stated that it had just \nbeen confirmed that American 11 was still airborne and heading toward D. C. He directed the transition to an air \nthreat conference call. NORAD confirmed that American 11 was airborne and heading toward Washington, relaying \nthe erroneous FAA information already mentioned. The call then ended, at about 9:34.  \n\nIt resumed at 9:37 as an air threat conference call, [Note: * All times given for this conference call are estimates, \nwhich we and the Department of Defense believe to be accurate within a +- 3 minute margin of error. ] which lasted \nmore than eight hours. The President, Vice President, Secretary of Defense, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n\n\n\nStaff, and Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley all participated in this teleconference at various times, \nas did military personnel from the White House underground shelter and the President's military aide on Air Force \nOne.  \n\nOperators worked feverishly to include the FAA, but they had equipment problems and difficulty finding secure \nphone numbers. NORAD asked three times before 10:03 to confirm the presence of the FAA in the teleconference. \nThe FAA representative who finally joined the call at 10:17 had no familiarity with or responsibility for hijackings, no \naccess to decisionmakers, and none of the information available to senior FAA officials.  \n\nWe found no evidence that, at this critical time, NORAD's top commanders, in Florida or Cheyenne Mountain, \ncoordinated with their counterparts at FAA headquarters to improve awareness and organize a common response. \nLower-level officials improvised - for example, the FAA's Boston Center bypassed the chain of command and \ndirectly contacted NEADS after the first hijacking. But the highest-level Defense Department officials relied on the \nNMCC's air threat conference, in which the FAA did not participate for the first 48 minutes.  \n\nAt 9:39, the NMCC's deputy director for operations, a military officer, opened the call from the Pentagon, which had \njust been hit. He began:\"An air attack against North America may be in progress. NORAD, what's the situation? \" \nNORAD said it had conflicting reports. Its latest information was \"of a possible hijacked aircraft taking off out of JFK \nen route to Washington D. C. \" The NMCC reported a crash into the mall side of the Pentagon and requested that \nthe Secretary of Defense be added to the conference.  \n\nAt 9:44, NORAD briefed the conference on the possible hijacking of Delta 1989. Two minutes later, staff reported \nthat they were still trying to locate Secretary Rumsfeld and Vice Chairman Myers. The Vice Chairman joined the \nconference shortly before 10:00; the Secretary, shortly before 10:30. The Chairman was out of the country.  \n\nAt 9:48, a representative from the White House shelter asked if there were any indications of another hijacked \naircraft. The deputy director for operations mentioned the Delta flight and concluded that \"that would be the fourth \npossible hijack. \"At 9:49, the commander of NORAD directed all air sovereignty aircraft to battle stations, fully \narmed.  \n\nAt 9:59, an Air Force lieutenant colonel working in the White House Military Office joined the conference and stated \nhe had just talked to Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley. The White House requested (1) the \nimplementation of continuity of government measures, (2) fighter escorts for Air Force One, and (3) a fighter combat \nair patrol over Washington, D. C.  \n\nBy 10:03, when United 93 crashed in Pennsylvania, there had been no mention of its hijacking and the FAA had not \nyet been added to the teleconference.  \n\nThe President and the Vice President \n\nThe President was seated in a classroom when, at 9:05, Andrew Card whispered to him: \"A second plane hit the \nsecond tower. America is under attack. \"The President told us his instinct was to project calm, not to have the \ncountry see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis. The press was standing behind the children; he saw their \nphones and pagers start to ring. The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better \nunderstand what was happening.  \n\nThe President remained in the classroom for another five to seven minutes,\n\nwhile the children continued reading. He then returned to a holding room shortly before 9:15, where he was briefed \nby staff and saw television coverage. He next spoke to Vice President Cheney, Dr. Rice, New York Governor \nGeorge Pataki, and FBI Director Robert Mueller. He decided to make a brief statement from the school before \nleaving for the airport. The Secret Service told us they were anxious to move the President to a safer location, but \ndid not think it imperative for him to run out the door.  \n\nBetween 9:15 and 9:30, the staff was busy arranging a return to Washington, while the President consulted his \nsenior advisers about his remarks. No one in the traveling party had any information during this time that other \naircraft were hijacked or missing. Staff was in contact with the White House Situation Room, but as far as we could \n\n\n\ndetermine, no one with the President was in contact with the Pentagon. The focus was on the President's statement \nto the nation. The only decision made during this time was to return to Washington.  \n\nThe President's motorcade departed at 9:35, and arrived at the airport between 9:42 and 9:45. During the ride the \nPresident learned about the attack on the Pentagon. He boarded the aircraft, asked the Secret Service about the \nsafety of his family, and called the Vice President. According to notes of the call, at about 9:45 the President told \nthe Vice President:\"Sounds like we have a minor war going on here, I heard about the Pentagon. We're at war . . . \nsomebody's going to pay. \"  \n\nAbout this time, Card, the lead Secret Service agent, the President's military aide, and the pilot were conferring on a \npossible destination for Air Force One. The Secret Service agent felt strongly that the situation in Washington was \ntoo unstable for the President to return there, and Card agreed. The President strongly wanted to return to \nWashington and only grudgingly agreed to go elsewhere. The issue was still undecided when the President \nconferred with the Vice President at about the time Air Force One was taking off. The Vice President recalled urging \nthe President not to return to Washington. Air Force One departed at about 9:54 without any fixed destination. The \nobjective was to get up in the air - as fast and as high as possible - and then decide where to go.  \n\nAt 9:33, the tower supervisor at Reagan National Airport picked up a hotline to the Secret Service and told the \nService's operations center that \"an aircraft [is] coming at you and not talking with us. \" This was the first specific \nreport to the Secret Service of a direct threat to the White House. No move was made to evacuate the Vice \nPresident at this time. As the officer who took the call explained, \"[I was] about to push the alert button when the \ntower advised that the aircraft was turning south and approaching Reagan National Airport. \"  \n\nAmerican 77 began turning south, away from the White House, at 9:34. It continued heading south for roughly a \nminute, before turning west and beginning to circle back. This news prompted the Secret Service to order the \nimmediate evacuation of the Vice President just before 9:36. Agents propelled him\n\nout of his chair and told him he had to get to the bunker. The Vice President entered the underground tunnel \nleading to the shelter at 9:37.  \n\nOnce inside, Vice President Cheney and the agents paused in an area of the tunnel that had a secure phone, a \nbench, and television. The Vice President asked to speak to the President, but it took time for the call to be \nconnected. He learned in the tunnel that the Pentagon had been hit, and he saw television coverage of smoke \ncoming from the building.  \n\nThe Secret Service logged Mrs. Cheney's arrival at the White House at 9:52, and she joined her husband in the \ntunnel. According to contemporaneous notes, at 9:55 the Vice President was still on the phone with the President \nadvising that three planes were missing and one had hit the Pentagon. We believe this is the same call in which the \nVice President urged the President not to return to Washington. After the call ended, Mrs. Cheney and the Vice \nPresident moved from the tunnel to the shelter conference room.  \n\nUnited 93 and the Shootdown Order \n\nOn the morning of 9/11, the President and Vice President stayed in contact not by an open line of communication \nbut through a series of calls. The President told us he was frustrated with the poor communications that morning. \nHe could not reach key officials, including Secretary Rumsfeld, for a period of time. The line to the White House \nshelter conference room - and the Vice President - kept cutting off.  \n\nThe Vice President remembered placing a call to the President just after entering the shelter conference room. \nThere is conflicting evidence about when the Vice President arrived in the shelter conference room. We have \nconcluded, from the available evidence, that the Vice President arrived in the room shortly before 10:00, perhaps at \n9:58. The Vice President recalled being told, just after his arrival, that the Air Force was trying to establish a combat \nair patrol over Washington.  \n\nThe Vice President stated that he called the President to discuss the rules of engagement for the CAP. He recalled \nfeeling that it did no good to establish the CAP unless the pilots had instructions on whether they were authorized to \nshoot if the plane would not divert. He said the President signed off on that concept. The President said he \n\n\n\nremembered such a conversation, and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor pilot. The President \nemphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft.  \n\nThe Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering \nthe conference room, but he did not hear what they said. Rice, who entered the room shortly after the Vice \nPresident and sat next to him, remembered hearing him inform the President, \"Sir, the CAPs are up. Sir, they're \ngoing to want to know what to do. \" Then she recalled hearing him say, \"Yes sir. \" She believed this conversation \noccurred a few minutes, perhaps five, after they entered the conference room.  \n\nWe believe this call would have taken place sometime before 10:10 to 10:15.\n\nAmong the sources that reflect other important events of that morning, there is no documentary evidence for this \ncall, but the relevant sources are incomplete. Others nearby who were taking notes, such as the Vice President's \nchief of staff, Scooter Libby, who sat next to him, and Mrs. Cheney, did not note a call between the President and \nVice President immediately after the Vice President entered the conference room.  \n\nAt 10:02, the communicators in the shelter began receiving reports from the Secret Service of an inbound aircraft - \npresumably hijacked - heading toward Washington. That aircraft was United 93. The Secret Service was getting this \ninformation directly from the FAA. The FAA may have been tracking the progress of United 93 on a display that \nshowed its projected path to Washington, not its actual radar return. Thus, the Secret Service was relying on \nprojections and was not aware the plane was already down in Pennsylvania.  \n\nAt some time between 10:10 and 10:15, a military aide told the Vice President and others that the aircraft was 80 \nmiles out. Vice President Cheney was asked for authority to engage the aircraft.   His reaction was described by \nScooter Libby as quick and decisive, \"in about the time it takes a batter to decide to swing. \" The Vice President \nauthorized fighter aircraft to engage the inbound plane. He told us he based this authorization on his earlier \nconversation with the President. The military aide returned a few minutes later, probably between 10:12 and 10:18, \nand said the aircraft was 60 miles out. He again asked for authorization to engage. The Vice President again said \nyes.  \n\nAt the conference room table was White House Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten. Bolten watched the exchanges \nand, after what he called \"a quiet moment, \"suggested that the Vice President get in touch with the President and \nconfirm the engage order. Bolten told us he wanted to make sure the President was told that the Vice President \nhad executed the order. He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the President.  \n\nThe Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the \nconfirmation. On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at \n10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary.  \n\nMinutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft \nhad been shot down pursuant to this authorization.  \n\nAt approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles \nout. Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to \"engage \nor \"take out\" the aircraft. At 10:33, Hadley told the air threat conference call: \"I need to get word to Dick Myers that \nour reports are there's an inbound aircraft flying low 5 miles out. The Vice President's guidance was we need to \ntake them out. \"  \n\nOnce again, there was no immediate information about the fate of the\n\ninbound aircraft. In the apt description of one witness, \"It drops below the radar screen and it's just continually \nhovering in your imagination; you don't know where it is or what happens to it. \" Eventually, the shelter received \nword that the alleged hijacker 5 miles away had been a medevac helicopter.  \n\nTransmission of the Authorization from the White House to the Pilots \n\n\n\nThe NMCC learned of United 93's hijacking at about 10:03. At this time the FAA had no contact with the military at \nthe level of national command. The NMCC learned about United 93 from the White House. It, in turn, was informed \nby the Secret Service's contacts with the FAA.  \n\nNORAD had no information either. At 10:07, its representative on the air threat conference call stated that NORAD \nhad \"no indication of a hijack heading to DC at this time. \"  \n\nRepeatedly between 10:14 and 10:19, a lieutenant colonel at the White House relayed to the NMCC that the Vice \nPresident had confirmed fighters were cleared to engage inbound aircraft if they could verify that the aircraft was \nhijacked.  \n\nThe commander of NORAD, General Ralph Eberhart, was en route to the NORAD operations center in Cheyenne \nMountain, Colorado, when the shootdown order was communicated on the air threat conference call. He told us that \nby the time he arrived, the order had already been passed down NORAD's chain of command.  \n\nIt is not clear how the shootdown order was communicated within NORAD. But we know that at 10:31, General \nLarry Arnold instructed his staff to broadcast the following over a NORAD instant messaging system:\"10:31 Vice \npresident has cleared to us to intercept tracks of interest and shoot them down if they do not respond per [General \nArnold]. \"  \n\nIn upstate New York, NEADS personnel first learned of the shootdown order from this message:\n\n        Controllers: Copy that, sir.\n\n        Floor Leadership: So if you're trying to divert somebody and\n\n        he won't divert -\n\n        Controllers: DO [Director of Operations] is saying no.\n\nFloor Leadership: No? It came over the chat. . . . You got a conflict on that direction?\n\nControllers: Right now no, but -\n\nFloor Leadership: Okay? Okay, you read that from the Vice President, right? Vice President has cleared. Vice \nPresident has cleared us to\n\n        intercept traffic and shoot them down if they do not respond per\n\n        [General Arnold]. \n\n        \n\nIn interviews with us, NEADS personnel expressed considerable confusion over the nature and effect of the order.\n\nThe NEADS commander told us he did not pass along the order because he was unaware of its ramifications. Both \nthe mission commander and the senior weapons director indicated they did not pass the order to the fighters \ncircling Washington and New York because they were unsure how the pilots would, or should, proceed with this \nguidance. In short, while leaders in Washington believed that the fighters above them had been instructed to \"take \nout\" hostile aircraft, the only orders actually conveyed to the pilots were to \"ID type and tail. \"  \n\nIn most cases, the chain of command authorizing the use of force runs from the president to the secretary of \ndefense and from the secretary to the combatant commander. The President apparently spoke to Secretary \nRumsfeld for the first time that morning shortly after 10:00. No one can recall the content of this conversation, but it \nwas a brief call in which the subject of shootdown authority was not discussed.  \n\nAt 10:39, the Vice President updated the Secretary on the air threat conference:\n\n        Vice President: There's been at least three instances here\n\n\n\n        where we've had reports of aircraft approaching Washington - a\n\n        couple were confirmed hijack. And, pursuant to the President's\n\n        instructions I gave authorization for them to be taken out. Hello?\n\nSecDef: Yes, I understand. Who did you give that direction to?\n\nVice President: It was passed from here through the [operations] center at the White House, from the [shelter].\n\nSecDef: OK, let me ask the question here. Has that directive been transmitted to the aircraft?\n\nVice President: Yes, it has.\n\nSecDef: So we've got a couple of aircraft up there that have those\n\nVice President: That is correct. And it's my understanding they've already taken a couple of aircraft out.\n\n        SecDef: We can't confirm that. We're told that one aircraft\n\n        is down but we do not have a pilot report that did it.\n\n        \n\n        \n\nAs this exchange shows, Secretary Rumsfeld was not in the NMCC when the shootdown order was first conveyed. \nHe went from the parking lot to his office (where he spoke to the President), then to the Executive Support Center, \nwhere he participated in the White House video teleconference. He moved\n\nto the NMCC shortly before 10:30, in order to join Vice Chairman Myers. Secretary Rumsfeld told us he was just \ngaining situational awareness when he spoke with the Vice President at 10:39. His primary concern was ensuring \nthat the pilots had a clear understanding of their rules of engagement.  \n\nThe Vice President was mistaken in his belief that shootdown authorization had been passed to the pilots flying at \nNORAD's direction. By 10:45 there was, however, another set of fighters circling Washington that had entirely \ndifferent rules of engagement. These fighters, part of the 113th Wing of the District of Columbia Air National Guard, \nlaunched out of Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland in response to information passed to them by the Secret \nService. The first of the Andrews fighters was airborne at 10:38.  \n\nGeneral David Wherley - the commander of the 113th Wing - reached out to the Secret Service after hearing \nsecondhand reports that it wanted fighters airborne. A Secret Service agent had a phone in each ear, one \nconnected to Wherley and the other to a fellow agent at the White House, relaying instructions that the White House \nagent said he was getting from the Vice President. The guidance for Wherley was to send up the aircraft, with \norders to protect the White House and take out any aircraft that threatened the Capitol. General Wherley translated \nthis in military terms to flying \"weapons free\" - that is, the decision to shoot rests in the cockpit, or in this case in the \ncockpit of the lead pilot. He passed these instructions to the pilots that launched at 10:42 and afterward.  \n\nThus, while the fighter pilots under NORAD direction who had scrambled out of Langley never received any type of \nengagement order, the Andrews pilots were operating weapons free - a permissive rule of engagement. The \nPresident and the Vice President indicated to us they had not been aware that fighters had been scrambled out of \nAndrews, at the request of the Secret Service and outside the military chain of command.   There is no evidence \n\n\n\nthat NORAD headquarters or military officials in the NMCC knew - during the morning of September 11 - that the \nAndrews planes were airborne and operating under different rules of engagement.\n\nWhat If? \n\nNORAD officials have maintained consistently that had the passengers not caused United 93 to crash, the military \nwould have prevented it from reaching Washington, D. C. That conclusion is based on a version of events that we \nnow know is incorrect. The Langley fighters were not scrambled in response to United 93; NORAD did not have 47 \nminutes to intercept the flight; NORAD did not even know the plane was hijacked until after it had crashed. It is \nappropriate, therefore, to reconsider whether United 93 would have been intercepted.\n\nHad it not crashed in Pennsylvania at 10:03, we estimate that United 93\n\ncould not have reached Washington any earlier than 10:13, and probably would have arrived before 10:23. There \nwas only one set of fighters circling Washington during that time frame - the Langley F-16s. They were armed and \nunder NORAD's control. After NEADS learned of the hijacking at 10:07, NORAD would have had from 6 to 16 \nminutes to locate the flight, receive authorization to shoot it down, and communicate the order to the pilots, who (in \nthe same span) would have had to authenticate the order, intercept the flight, and execute the order.  \n\nAt that point in time, the Langley pilots did not know the threat they were facing, did not know where United 93 was \nlocated, and did not have shootdown authorization.\n\nFirst, the Langley pilots were never briefed about the reason they were scrambled. As the lead pilot explained, \"I \nreverted to the Russian threat. . . . I'm thinking cruise missile threat from the sea. You know you look down and see \nthe Pentagon burning and I thought the bastards snuck one by us. . . . [Y]ou couldn't see any airplanes, and no one \ntold us anything. \"The pilots knew their mission was to divert aircraft, but did not know that the threat came from \nhijacked airliners.  \n\nSecond, NEADS did not have accurate information on the location of United 93. Presumably FAA would have \nprovided such information, but we do not know how long that would have taken, nor how long it would have taken \nNEADS to locate the target.\n\nThird, NEADS needed orders to pass to the pilots. At 10:10, the pilots over Washington were emphatically told, \n\"negative clearance to shoot. \" Shootdown authority was first communicated to NEADS at 10:31. It is possible that \nNORAD commanders would have ordered a shootdown in the absence of the authorization communicated by the \nVice President, but given the gravity of the decision to shoot down a commercial airliner, and NORAD's caution that \na mistake not be made, we view this possibility as unlikely.  \n\nNORAD officials have maintained that they would have intercepted and shot down United 93. We are not so sure. \nWe are sure that the nation owes a debt to the passengers of United 93. Their actions saved the lives of countless \nothers, and may have saved either the Capitol or the White House from destruction.\n\nThe details of what happened on the morning of September 11 are complex, but they play out a simple theme. \nNORAD and the FAA were unprepared for the type of attacks launched against the United States on September 11, \n2001. They struggled, under difficult circumstances, to improvise a homeland defense against an unprecedented \nchallenge they had never before encountered and had never trained to meet.\n\nAt 10:02 that morning, an assistant to the mission crew commander at NORAD's Northeast Air Defense Sector in \nRome, New York, was working\n\nwith his colleagues on the floor of the command center. In a brief moment of reflection, he was recorded remarking \nthat \"This is a new type of war. \"  \n\nHe was, and is, right. But the conflict did not begin on 9/11. It had been publicly declared years earlier, most notably \nin a declaration faxed early in 1998 to an Arabic-language newspaper in London. Few Americans had noticed it. \nThe fax had been sent from thousands of miles away by the followers of a Saudi exile gathered in one of the most \nremote and impoverished countries on earth.\n\n\n\n2 THE FOUNDATION OF THE NEW TERRORISM \n\n2. 1 A DECLARATION OF WAR \n\nIn February 1998, the 40-year-old Saudi exile Usama Bin Ladin and a fugitive Egyptian physician, Ayman al \nZawahiri, arranged from their Afghan headquarters for an Arabic newspaper in London to publish what they termed \na fatwa issued in the name of a \"World Islamic Front. \"A fatwa is normally an interpretation of Islamic law by a \nrespected Islamic authority, but neither Bin Ladin, Zawahiri, nor the three others who signed this statement were \nscholars of Islamic law. Claiming that America had declared war against God and his messenger, they called for the \nmurder of any American, anywhere on earth, as the \"individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in \nwhich it is possible to do it. \"  \n\nThree months later, when interviewed in Afghanistan by ABC-TV, Bin Ladin enlarged on these themes.   He \nclaimed it was more important for Muslims to kill Americans than to kill other infidels. \"It is far better for anyone to \nkill a single American soldier than to squander his efforts on other activities, \" he said. Asked whether he approved \nof terrorism and of attacks on civilians, he replied:\"We believe that the worst thieves in the world today and the \nworst terrorists are the Americans. Nothing could stop you except perhaps retaliation in kind. We do not have to \ndifferentiate between military or civilian. As far as we are concerned, they are all targets. \"\n\nNote: Islamic names often do not follow the Western practice of the consistent use of surnames. Given the variety \nof names we mention, we chose to refer to individuals by the last word in the names by which they are known: \nNawaf al Hazmi as Hazmi, for instance, omitting the article \"al\" that would be part of their name in their own \nsocieties. We generally make an exception for the more familiar English usage of \"Bin\" as part of a last name, as in \nBin Ladin. Further, there is no universally accepted way to transliterate Arabic words and names into English. We \nhave relied on a mix of common sense, the sound of the name in Arabic, and common usage in source materials, \nthe press, or government documents. When we quote from a source document, we use its transliteration, e. g. , \"al \nQida\" instead of al Qaeda. \n\nThough novel for its open endorsement of indiscriminate killing, Bin Ladin's 1998 declaration was only the latest in \nthe long series of his public and private calls since 1992 that singled out the United States for attack.\n\nIn August 1996, Bin Ladin had issued his own self-styled fatwa calling on Muslims to drive American soldiers out of \nSaudi Arabia. The long, disjointed document condemned the Saudi monarchy for allowing the presence of an army \nof infidels in a land with the sites most sacred to Islam, and celebrated recent suicide bombings of American military \nfacilities in the Kingdom. It praised the 1983 suicide bombing in Beirut that killed 241 U. S. Marines, the 1992 \nbombing in Aden, and especially the 1993 firefight in Somalia after which the United States \"left the area carrying \ndisappointment, humiliation, defeat and your dead with you. \"  \n\nBin Ladin said in his ABC interview that he and his followers had been preparing in Somalia for another long \nstruggle, like that against the Soviets in Afghanistan, but \"the United States rushed out of Somalia in shame and \ndisgrace. \" Citing the Soviet army's withdrawal from Afghanistan as proof that a ragged army of dedicated Muslims \ncould overcome a superpower, he told the interviewer:\"We are certain that we shall - with the grace of Allah - \nprevail over the Americans. \"He went on to warn that \"If the present injustice continues . . . , it will inevitably move \nthe battle to American soil. \"  \n\nPlans to attack the United States were developed with unwavering singlemindedness throughout the 1990s. Bin \nLadin saw himself as called \"to follow in the footsteps of the Messenger and to communicate his message to all \nnations, \"   and to serve as the rallying point and organizer of a new kind of war to destroy America and bring the \nworld to Islam.\n\n2. 2 BIN LADIN'S APPEAL IN THE ISLAMIC WORLD \n\n\n\nIt is the story of eccentric and violent ideas sprouting in the fertile ground of political and social turmoil. It is the story \nof an organization poised to seize its historical moment. How did Bin Ladin - with his call for the indiscriminate killing \nof Americans - win thousands of followers and some degree of approval from millions more?\n\nThe history, culture, and body of beliefs from which Bin Ladin has shaped and spread his message are largely \nunknown to many Americans. Seizing on symbols of Islam's past greatness, he promises to restore pride to people \nwho consider themselves the victims of successive foreign masters. He uses cultural and religious allusions to the \nholy Qur'an and some of its interpreters. He appeals to people disoriented by cyclonic change as they confront \nmodernity and globalization. His rhetoric selectively draws from multiple sources - Islam, history, and the region's \npolitical and economic malaise. He also stresses grievances against the United States widely shared in the Muslim \nworld. He Usama Bin Ladin at a news conference in Afghanistan in 1998 \n\n  \u2022 \n\ninveighed against the presence of U. S. troops in Saudi Arabia, the home of Islam's holiest sites. He spoke of the \nsuffering of the Iraqi people as a result of sanctions imposed after the Gulf War, and he protested U. S. support of \nIsrael.\n\nIslam \n\nIslam (a word that literally means \"surrender to the will of God\") arose in Arabia with what Muslims believe are a \nseries of revelations to the Prophet Mohammed from the one and only God, the God of Abraham and of Jesus. \nThese revelations, conveyed by the angel Gabriel, are recorded in the Qur'an. Muslims believe that these \nrevelations, given to the greatest and last of a chain of prophets stretching from Abraham through Jesus, complete \nGod's message to humanity. The Hadith, which recount Mohammed's sayings and deeds as recorded by his \ncontemporaries, are another fundamental source. A third key element is the Sharia, the code of law derived from \nthe Qur'an and the Hadith.\n\nIslam is divided into two main branches, Sunni and Shia. Soon after the\n\nProphet's death, the question of choosing a new leader, or caliph , for the Muslim community, or Ummah , arose. \nInitially, his successors could be drawn from the Prophet's contemporaries, but with time, this was no longer \npossible. Those who became the Shia held that any leader of the Ummah must be a direct descendant of the \nProphet; those who became the Sunni argued that lineal descent was not required if the candidate met other \nstandards of faith and knowledge. After bloody struggles, the Sunni became (and remain) the majority sect. (The \nShia are dominant in Iran. ) The Caliphate - the institutionalized leadership of the Ummah - thus was a Sunni \ninstitution that continued until 1924, first under Arab and eventually under Ottoman Turkish control.\n\nMany Muslims look back at the century after the revelations to the Prophet Mohammed as a golden age. Its \nmemory is strongest among the Arabs. What happened then - the spread of Islam from the Arabian Peninsula \nthroughout the Middle East, North Africa, and even into Europe within less than a century - seemed, and seems, \nmiraculous.   Nostalgia for Islam's past glory remains a powerful force.\n\nIslam is both a faith and a code of conduct for all aspects of life. For many Muslims, a good government would be \none guided by the moral principles of their faith. This does not necessarily translate into a desire for clerical rule and \nthe abolition of a secular state. It does mean that some Muslims tend to be uncomfortable with distinctions between \nreligion and state, though Muslim rulers throughout history have readily separated the two.\n\nTo extremists, however, such divisions, as well as the existence of parliaments and legislation, only prove these \nrulers to be false Muslims usurping God's authority over all aspects of life. Periodically, the Islamic world has seen \nsurges of what, for want of a better term, is often labeled \"fundamentalism. \"   Denouncing waywardness among the \nfaithful, some clerics have appealed for a return to observance of the literal teachings of the Qur'an and Hadith. \nOne scholar from the fourteenth century from whom Bin Ladin selectively quotes, Ibn Taimiyyah, condemned both \ncorrupt rulers and the clerics who failed to criticize them. He urged Muslims to read the Qur'an and the Hadith for \nthemselves, not to depend solely on learned interpreters like himself but to hold one another to account for the \nquality of their observance.  \n\n\n\nThe extreme Islamist version of history blames the decline from Islam's golden age on the rulers and people who \nturned away from the true path of their religion, thereby leaving Islam vulnerable to encroaching foreign powers \neager to steal their land, wealth, and even their souls.\n\nBin Ladin's Worldview \n\nDespite his claims to universal leadership, Bin Ladin offers an extreme view of Islamic history designed to appeal \nmainly to Arabs and Sunnis. He draws on fundamentalists who blame the eventual destruction of the Caliphate on \nleaders who abandoned the pure path of religious devotion.   He repeatedly calls on his followers to embrace \nmartyrdom since \"the walls of oppression and\n\nhumiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets. \"   For those yearning for a lost sense of order in an \nolder, more tranquil world, he offers his \"Caliphate\" as an imagined alternative to today's uncertainty. For others, he \noffers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world.\n\nBin Ladin also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood   executed in \n1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial \nacquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in \nthe late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western \nachievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \"nothing that will satisfy its own \nconscience and justify its existence. \"  \n\nThree basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, \nlicentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya , the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to \nthe revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and \njahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material \ncomforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in \nwhat Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims - as he defined them - therefore must take \nup arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.  \n\nBin Ladin shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder \nas righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \"Why do 'they' hate us? \" Some also \nask, \"What can we do to stop these attacks? \"\n\nBin Ladin and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions. To the first, they say that America had \nattacked Islam; America is responsible for all conflicts involving Muslims. Thus Americans are blamed when Israelis \nfight with Palestinians, when Russians fight with Chechens, when Indians fight with Kashmiri Muslims, and when \nthe Philippine government fights ethnic Muslims in its southern islands. America is also held responsible for the \ngovernments of Muslim countries, derided by al Qaeda as \"your agents. \"Bin Ladin has stated flatly, \"Our fight \nagainst these governments is not separate from our fight against you. \"   These charges found a ready audience \namong millions of Arabs and Muslims angry at the United States because of issues ranging from Iraq to Palestine to \nAmerica's support for their countries' repressive rulers.\n\nBin Ladin's grievance with the United States may have started in reaction to specific U. S. policies but it quickly \nbecame far deeper. To the second question, what America could do, al Qaeda's answer was that America should \nabandon the Middle East, convert to Islam, and end the immorality and godlessness of its society and culture:\"It is \nsaddening to tell you that you are the worst civilization witnessed by the history of mankind. \" If the United States \ndid not\n\ncomply, it would be at war with the Islamic nation, a nation that al Qaeda's leaders said \"desires death more than \nyou desire life. \"  \n\nHistory and Political Context \n\nFew fundamentalist movements in the Islamic world gained lasting political power. In the nineteenth and twentieth \ncenturies, fundamentalists helped articulate anticolonial grievances but played little role in the overwhelmingly \n\n\n\nsecular struggles for independence after World War I. Western-educated lawyers, soldiers, and officials led most \nindependence movements, and clerical influence and traditional culture were seen as obstacles to national \nprogress.\n\nAfter gaining independence from Western powers following World War II, the Arab Middle East followed an arc from \ninitial pride and optimism to today's mix of indifference, cynicism, and despair. In several countries, a dynastic state \nalready existed or was quickly established under a paramount tribal family. Monarchies in countries such as Saudi \nArabia, Morocco, and Jordan still survive today. Those in Egypt, Libya, Iraq, and Yemen were eventually \noverthrown by secular nationalist revolutionaries.\n\nThe secular regimes promised a glowing future, often tied to sweeping ideologies (such as those promoted by \nEgyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser's Arab Socialism or the Ba'ath Party of Syria and Iraq) that called for a \nsingle, secular Arab state. However, what emerged were almost invariably autocratic regimes that were usually \nunwilling to tolerate any opposition - even in countries, such as Egypt, that had a parliamentary tradition. Over time, \ntheir policies - repression, rewards, emigration, and the displacement of popular anger onto scapegoats (generally \nforeign) - were shaped by the desire to cling to power.\n\nThe bankruptcy of secular, autocratic nationalism was evident across the Muslim world by the late 1970s. At the \nsame time, these regimes had closed off nearly all paths for peaceful opposition, forcing their critics to choose \nsilence, exile, or violent opposition. Iran's 1979 revolution swept a Shia theocracy into power. Its success \nencouraged Sunni fundamentalists elsewhere.\n\nIn the 1980s, awash in sudden oil wealth, Saudi Arabia competed with Shia Iran to promote its Sunni \nfundamentalist interpretation of Islam, Wahhabism. The Saudi government, always conscious of its duties as the \ncustodian of Islam's holiest places, joined with wealthy Arabs from the Kingdom and other states bordering the \nPersian Gulf in donating money to build mosques and religious schools that could preach and teach their \ninterpretation of Islamic doctrine.\n\nIn this competition for legitimacy, secular regimes had no alternative to offer. Instead, in a number of cases their \nrulers sought to buy off local Islamist movements by ceding control of many social and educational issues. \nEmboldened rather than satisfied, the Islamists continued to push for power - a trend especially clear in Egypt. \nConfronted with a violent Islamist movement that killed President Anwar Sadat in 1981, the Egyptian government \ncombined\n\nharsh repression of Islamic militants with harassment of moderate Islamic scholars and authors, driving many into \nexile. In Pakistan, a military regime sought to justify its seizure of power by a pious public stance and an embrace of \nunprecedented Islamist influence on education and society.\n\nThese experiments in political Islam faltered during the 1990s: the Iranian revolution lost momentum, prestige, and \npublic support, and Pakistan's rulers found that most of its population had little enthusiasm for fundamentalist Islam. \nIslamist revival movements gained followers across the Muslim world, but failed to secure political power except in \nIran and Sudan. In Algeria, where in 1991 Islamists seemed almost certain to win power through the ballot box, the \nmilitary preempted their victory, triggering a brutal civil war that continues today. Opponents of today's rulers have \nfew, if any, ways to participate in the existing political system. They are thus a ready audience for calls to Muslims \nto purify their society, reject unwelcome modernization, and adhere strictly to the Sharia.\n\nSocial and Economic Malaise \n\nIn the 1970s and early 1980s, an unprecedented flood of wealth led the then largely unmodernized oil states to \nattempt to shortcut decades of development. They funded huge infrastructure projects, vastly expanded education, \nand created subsidized social welfare programs. These programs established a widespread feeling of entitlement \nwithout a corresponding sense of social obligations. By the late 1980s, diminishing oil revenues, the economic drain \nfrom many unprofitable development projects, and population growth made these entitlement programs \nunsustainable. The resulting cutbacks created enormous resentment among recipients who had come to see \ngovernment largesse as their right. This resentment was further stoked by public understanding of how much oil \nincome had gone straight into the pockets of the rulers, their friends, and their helpers.\n\n\n\nUnlike the oil states (or Afghanistan, where real economic development has barely begun), the other Arab nations \nand Pakistan once had seemed headed toward balanced modernization. The established commercial, financial, \nand industrial sectors in these states, supported by an entrepreneurial spirit and widespread understanding of free \nenterprise, augured well. But unprofitable heavy industry, state monopolies, and opaque bureaucracies slowly \nstifled growth. More importantly, these state-centered regimes placed their highest priority on preserving the elite's \ngrip on national wealth. Unwilling to foster dynamic economies that could create jobs attractive to educated young \nmen, the countries became economically stagnant and reliant on the safety valve of worker emigration either to the \nArab oil states or to the West. Furthermore, the repression and isolation of women in many Muslim countries have \nnot only seriously limited individual opportunity but also crippled overall economic productivity.  \n\nBy the 1990s, high birthrates and declining rates of infant mortality had\n\nproduced a common problem throughout the Muslim world: a large, steadily increasing population of young men \nwithout any reasonable expectation of suitable or steady employment - a sure prescription for social turbulence. \nMany of these young men, such as the enormous number trained only in religious schools, lacked the skills needed \nby their societies. Far more acquired valuable skills but lived in stagnant economies that could not generate \nsatisfying jobs.\n\nMillions, pursuing secular as well as religious studies, were products of educational systems that generally devoted \nlittle if any attention to the rest of the world's thought, history, and culture. The secular education reflected a strong \ncultural preference for technical fields over the humanities and social sciences. Many of these young men, even if \nable to study abroad, lacked the perspective and skills needed to understand a different culture.\n\nFrustrated in their search for a decent living, unable to benefit from an education often obtained at the cost of great \nfamily sacrifice, and blocked from starting families of their own, some of these young men were easy targets for \nradicalization.\n\nBin Ladin's Historical Opportunity \n\nMost Muslims prefer a peaceful and inclusive vision of their faith, not the violent sectarianism of Bin Ladin. Among \nArabs, Bin Ladin's followers are commonly nicknamed takfiri , or \"those who define other Muslims as unbelievers, \" \nbecause of their readiness to demonize and murder those with whom they disagree. Beyond the theology lies the \nsimple human fact that most Muslims, like most other human beings, are repelled by mass murder and barbarism \nwhatever their justification.\n\n\"All Americans must recognize that the face of terror is not the true face of Islam, \" President Bush observed. \"Islam \nis a faith that brings comfort to a billion people around the world. It's a faith that has made brothers and sisters of \nevery race. It's a faith based upon love, not hate. \"   Yet as political, social, and economic problems created \nflammable societies, Bin Ladin used Islam's most extreme, fundamentalist traditions as his match. All these \nelements - including religion - combined in an explosive compound.\n\nOther extremists had, and have, followings of their own. But in appealing to societies full of discontent, Bin Ladin \nremained credible as other leaders and symbols faded. He could stand as a symbol of resistance - above all, \nresistance to the West and to America. He could present himself and his allies as victorious warriors in the one \ngreat successful experience for Islamic militancy in the 1980s: the Afghan jihad against the Soviet occupation.\n\nBy 1998, Bin Ladin had a distinctive appeal, as he focused on attacking America. He argued that other extremists, \nwho aimed at local rulers or Israel, did not go far enough. They had not taken on what he called \"the head of the \nsnake. \"  \n\nFinally, Bin Ladin had another advantage: a substantial, worldwide organization. By the time he issued his February \n1998 declaration of war, Bin Ladin had nurtured that organization for nearly ten years. He could attract, train, and \nuse recruits for ever more ambitious attacks, rallying new adherents with each demonstration that his was the \nmovement of the future.\n\n2. 3 THE RISE OF BIN LADIN AND AL QAEDA (1988-1992) \n\n\n\nA decade of conflict in Afghanistan, from 1979 to 1989, gave Islamist extremists a rallying point and training field. A \nCommunist government in Afghanistan gained power in 1978 but was unable to establish enduring control. At the \nend of 1979, the Soviet government sent in military units to ensure that the country would remain securely under \nMoscow's influence. The response was an Afghan national resistance movement that defeated Soviet forces.  \n\nYoung Muslims from around the world flocked to Afghanistan to join as volunteers in what was seen as a \"holy war\" \n- jihad  - against an invader. The largest numbers came from the Middle East. Some were Saudis, and among them \nwas Usama Bin Ladin.\n\nTwenty-three when he arrived in Afghanistan in 1980, Bin Ladin was the seventeenth of 57 children of a Saudi \nconstruction magnate. Six feet five and thin, Bin Ladin appeared to be ungainly but was in fact quite athletic, skilled \nas a horseman, runner, climber, and soccer player. He had attended Abdul Aziz University in Saudi Arabia. By \nsome accounts, he had been interested there in religious studies, inspired by tape recordings of fiery sermons by \nAbdullah Azzam, a Palestinian and a disciple of Qutb. Bin Ladin was conspicuous among the volunteers not \nbecause he showed evidence of religious learning but because he had access to some of his family's huge fortune. \nThough he took part in at least one actual battle, he became known chiefly as a person who generously helped fund \nthe anti-Soviet jihad.  \n\nBin Ladin understood better than most of the volunteers the extent to which the continuation and eventual success \nof the jihad in Afghanistan depended on an increasingly complex, almost worldwide organization. This organization \nincluded a financial support network that came to be known as the \"Golden Chain, \" put together mainly by \nfinanciers in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf states. Donations flowed through charities or other \nnongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Bin Ladin and the \"Afghan Arabs\" drew largely on funds raised by this \nnetwork, whose agents roamed world markets to buy arms and supplies for the mujahideen, or \"holy warriors. \"  \n\nMosques, schools, and boardinghouses served as recruiting stations in many parts of the world, including the \nUnited States. Some were set up by Islamic extremists or their financial backers. Bin Ladin had an important part in \nthis\n\nactivity. He and the cleric Azzam had joined in creating a \"Bureau of Services\" (Mektab al Khidmat, or MAK), which \nchanneled recruits into Afghanistan.  \n\nThe international environment for Bin Ladin's efforts was ideal. Saudi Arabia and the United States supplied billions \nof dollars worth of secret assistance to rebel groups in Afghanistan fighting the Soviet occupation. This assistance \nwas funneled through Pakistan:the Pakistani military intelligence service (Inter- Services Intelligence Directorate, or \nISID), helped train the rebels and distribute the arms. But Bin Ladin and his comrades had their own sources of \nsupport and training, and they received little or no assistance from the United States.  \n\nApril 1988 brought victory for the Afghan jihad. Moscow declared it would pull its military forces out of Afghanistan \nwithin the next nine months. As the Soviets began their withdrawal, the jihad's leaders debated what to do next.\n\nBin Ladin and Azzam agreed that the organization successfully created for Afghanistan should not be allowed to \ndissolve. They established what they called a base or foundation (al Qaeda) as a potential general headquarters for \nfuture jihad.   Though Azzam had been considered number one in the MAK, by August 1988 Bin Ladin was clearly \nthe leader ( emir ) of al Qaeda. This organization's structure included as its operating arms an intelligence \ncomponent, a military committee, a financial committee, a political committee, and a committee in charge of media \naffairs and propaganda. It also had an Advisory Council (Shura) made up of Bin Ladin's inner circle.  \n\nBin Ladin's assumption of the helm of al Qaeda was evidence of his growing self-confidence and ambition. He soon \nmade clear his desire for unchallenged control and for preparing the mujahideen to fight anywhere in the world. \nAzzam, by contrast, favored continuing to fight in Afghanistan until it had a true Islamist government. And, as a \nPalestinian, he saw Israel as the top priority for the next stage.  \n\nWhether the dispute was about power, personal differences, or strategy, it ended on November 24, 1989, when a \nremotely controlled car bomb killed Azzam and both of his sons. The killers were assumed to be rival Egyptians. \nThe outcome left Bin Ladin indisputably in charge of what remained of the MAK and al Qaeda.  \n\nThrough writers like Qutb, and the presence of Egyptian Islamist teachers in the Saudi educational system, \nIslamists already had a strong intellectual influence on Bin Ladin and his al Qaeda colleagues. By the late 1980s, \n\n\n\nthe Egyptian Islamist movement - badly battered in the government crackdown following President Sadat's \nassassination - was centered in two major organizations: the Islamic Group and the Egyptian Islamic Jihad. A \nspiritual guide for both, but especially the Islamic Group, was the so-called Blind Sheikh, Omar Abdel Rahman. His \npreaching had inspired the assassination of Sadat. After being in and out of Egyptian prisons during the 1980s, \nAbdel Rahman found\n\nrefuge in the United States. From his headquarters in Jersey City, he distributed messages calling for the murder of \nunbelievers.  \n\nThe most important Egyptian in Bin Ladin's circle was a surgeon, Ayman al Zawahiri, who led a strong faction of the \nEgyptian Islamic Jihad. Many of his followers became important members in the new organization, and his own \nclose ties with Bin Ladin led many to think of him as the deputy head of al Qaeda. He would in fact become Bin \nLadin's deputy some years later, when they merged their organizations.  \n\nBin Ladin Moves to Sudan \n\nBy the fall of 1989, Bin Ladin had sufficient stature among Islamic extremists that a Sudanese political leader, \nHassan al Turabi, urged him to transplant his whole organization to Sudan. Turabi headed the National Islamic \nFront in a coalition that had recently seized power in Khartoum.   Bin Ladin agreed to help Turabi in an ongoing war \nagainst African Christian separatists in southern Sudan and also to do some road building. Turabi in return would let \nBin Ladin use Sudan as a base for worldwide business operations and for preparations for jihad.   While agents of \nBin Ladin began to buy property in Sudan in 1990,   Bin Ladin himself moved from Afghanistan back to Saudi \nArabia.\n\nIn August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. Bin Ladin, whose efforts in Afghanistan had earned him celebrity and respect, \nproposed to the Saudi monarchy that he summon mujahideen for a jihad to retake Kuwait. He was rebuffed, and the \nSaudis joined the U. S. -led coalition. After the Saudis agreed to allow U. S. armed forces to be based in the \nKingdom, Bin Ladin and a number of Islamic clerics began to publicly denounce the arrangement. The Saudi \ngovernment exiled the clerics and undertook to silence Bin Ladin by, among other things, taking away his passport. \nWith help from a dissident member of the royal family, he managed to get out of the country under the pretext of \nattending an Islamic gathering in Pakistan in April 1991.   By 1994, the Saudi government would freeze his financial \nassets and revoke his citizenship.   He no longer had a country he could call his own.\n\nBin Ladin moved to Sudan in 1991 and set up a large and complex set of intertwined business and terrorist \nenterprises. In time, the former would encompass numerous companies and a global network of bank accounts and \nnongovernmental institutions. Fulfilling his bargain with Turabi, Bin Ladin used his construction company to build a \nnew highway from Khartoum to Port Sudan on the Red Sea coast. Meanwhile, al Qaeda finance officers and top \noperatives used their positions in Bin Ladin's businesses to acquire weapons, explosives, and technical equipment \nfor terrorist purposes. One founding member, Abu Hajer al Iraqi, used his position as head of a Bin Ladin \ninvestment company to carry out procurement trips from western Europe to the Far East. Two others, Wadi al Hage \nand Mubarak Douri, who had become acquainted in Tuc-\n\nson, Arizona, in the late 1980s, went as far afield as China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and the former Soviet states \nof Ukraine and Belarus.  \n\nBin Ladin's impressive array of offices covertly provided financial and other support for terrorist activities. The \nnetwork included a major business enterprise in Cyprus; a \"services\" branch in Zagreb; an office of the \nBenevolence International Foundation in Sarajevo, which supported the Bosnian Muslims in their conflict with \nSerbia and Croatia; and an NGO in Baku, Azerbaijan, that was employed as well by Egyptian Islamic Jihad both as \na source and conduit for finances and as a support center for the Muslim rebels in Chechnya. He also made use of \nthe already-established Third World Relief Agency (TWRA) headquartered in Vienna, whose branch office locations \nincluded Zagreb and Budapest. (Bin Ladin later set up an NGO in Nairobi as a cover for operatives there. )  \n\nBin Ladin now had a vision of himself as head of an international jihad confederation. In Sudan, he established an \n\"Islamic Army Shura\" that was to serve as the coordinating body for the consortium of terrorist groups with which he \nwas forging alliances. It was composed of his own al Qaeda Shura together with leaders or representatives of \n\n\n\nterrorist organizations that were still independent. In building this Islamic army, he enlisted groups from Saudi \nArabia, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Oman, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, Morocco, Somalia, and Eritrea. Al Qaeda also \nestablished cooperative but less formal relationships with other extremist groups from these same countries; from \nthe African states of Chad, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Uganda; and from the Southeast Asian states of Burma, \nThailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Bin Ladin maintained connections in the Bosnian conflict as well.   The \ngroundwork for a true global terrorist network was being laid.\n\nBin Ladin also provided equipment and training assistance to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in the Philippines \nand also to a newly forming Philippine group that called itself the Abu Sayyaf Brigade, after one of the major Afghan \njihadist commanders.   Al Qaeda helped Jemaah Islamiya (JI), a nascent organization headed by Indonesian \nIslamists with cells scattered across Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It also aided a Pakistani \ngroup engaged in insurrectionist attacks in Kashmir. In mid-1991, Bin Ladin dispatched a band of supporters to the \nnorthern Afghanistan border to assist the Tajikistan Islamists in the ethnic conflicts that had been boiling there even \nbefore the Central Asian departments of the Soviet Union became independent states.  \n\nThis pattern of expansion through building alliances extended to the United States. A Muslim organization called al \nKhifa had numerous branch offices, the largest of which was in the Farouq mosque in Brooklyn. In the mid- 1980s, \nit had been set up as one of the first outposts of Azzam and Bin Ladin's MAK.   Other cities with branches of al \nKhifa included Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Tucson.   Al Khifa recruited American Muslims to\n\nfight in Afghanistan; some of them would participate in terrorist actions in the United States in the early 1990s and \nin al Qaeda operations elsewhere, including the 1998 attacks on U. S. embassies in East Africa.\n\n2. 4 BUILDING AN ORGANIZATION, DECLARING WAR ON THE UNITED STATES (1992-1996) \n\nBin Ladin began delivering diatribes against the United States before he left Saudi Arabia. He continued to do so \nafter he arrived in Sudan. In early 1992, the al Qaeda leadership issued a fatwa calling for jihad against the \nWestern \"occupation\" of Islamic lands. Specifically singling out U. S. forces for attack, the language resembled that \nwhich would appear in Bin Ladin's public fatwa in August 1996. In ensuing weeks, Bin Ladin delivered an often-\nrepeated lecture on the need to cut off \"the head of the snake. \"  \n\nBy this time, Bin Ladin was well-known and a senior figure among Islamist extremists, especially those in Egypt, the \nArabian Peninsula, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. Still, he was just one among many diverse terrorist \nbarons. Some of Bin Ladin's close comrades were more peers than subordinates. For example, Usama Asmurai, \nalso known as Wali Khan, worked with Bin Ladin in the early 1980s and helped him in the Philippines and in \nTajikistan. The Egyptian spiritual guide based in New Jersey, the Blind Sheikh, whom Bin Ladin admired, was also \nin the network. Among sympathetic peers in Afghanistan were a few of the warlords still fighting for power and Abu \nZubaydah, who helped operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border with Pakistan. There were also \nrootless but experienced operatives, such as Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who - though not \nnecessarily formal members of someone else's organization - were traveling around the world and joining in \nprojects that were supported by or linked to Bin Ladin, the Blind Sheikh, or their associates.  \n\nIn now analyzing the terrorist programs carried out by members of this network, it would be misleading to apply the \nlabel \"al Qaeda operations\" too often in these early years. Yet it would also be misleading to ignore the significance \nof these connections. And in this network, Bin Ladin's agenda stood out. While his allied Islamist groups were \nfocused on local battles, such as those in Egypt, Algeria, Bosnia, or Chechnya, Bin Ladin concentrated on attacking \nthe \"far enemy\" - the United States.\n\nAttacks Known and Suspected \n\nAfter U. S. troops deployed to Somalia in late 1992, al Qaeda leaders formulated a fatwa demanding their eviction. \nIn December, bombs exploded at two hotels in Aden where U. S. troops routinely stopped en route to Somalia, \nkilling two, but no Americans. The perpetrators are reported to have belonged to a\n\n\n\ngroup from southern Yemen headed by a Yemeni member of Bin Ladin's Islamic Army Shura; some in the group \nhad trained at an al Qaeda camp in Sudan.  \n\nAl Qaeda leaders set up a Nairobi cell and used it to send weapons and trainers to the Somali warlords battling U. \nS. forces, an operation directly supervised by al Qaeda's military leader.   Scores of trainers flowed to Somalia over \nthe ensuing months, including most of the senior members and weapons training experts of al Qaeda's military \ncommittee. These trainers were later heard boasting that their assistance led to the October 1993 shootdown of \ntwo U. S. Black Hawk helicopters by members of a Somali militia group and to the subsequent withdrawal of U. S. \nforces in early 1994.  \n\nIn November 1995, a car bomb exploded outside a Saudi-U. S. joint facility in Riyadh for training the Saudi National \nGuard. Five Americans and two officials from India were killed. The Saudi government arrested four perpetrators, \nwho admitted being inspired by Bin Ladin. They were promptly executed. Though nothing proves that Bin Ladin \nordered this attack, U. S. intelligence subsequently learned that al Qaeda leaders had decided a year earlier to \nattack a U. S. target in Saudi Arabia, and had shipped explosives to the peninsula for this purpose. Some of Bin \nLadin's associates later took credit.  \n\nIn June 1996, an enormous truck bomb detonated in the Khobar Towers residential complex in Dhahran, Saudi \nArabia, that housed U. S. Air Force personnel. Nineteen Americans were killed, and 372 were wounded. The \noperation was carried out principally, perhaps exclusively, by Saudi Hezbollah, an organization that had received \nsupport from the government of Iran. While the evidence of Iranian involvement is strong, there are also signs that \nal Qaeda played some role, as yet unknown.  \n\nIn this period, other prominent attacks in which Bin Ladin's involvement is at best cloudy are the 1993 bombing of \nthe World Trade Center, a plot that same year to destroy landmarks in New York, and the 1995 Manila air plot to \nblow up a dozen U. S. airliners over the Pacific. Details on these plots appear in chapter 3.\n\nAnother scheme revealed that Bin Ladin sought the capability to kill on a mass scale. His business aides received \nword that a Sudanese military officer who had been a member of the previous government cabinet was offering to \nsell weapons-grade uranium. After a number of contacts were made through intermediaries, the officer set the price \nat $1. 5 million, which did not deter Bin Ladin. Al Qaeda representatives asked to inspect the uranium and were \nshown a cylinder about 3 feet long, and one thought he could pronounce it genuine. Al Qaeda apparently \npurchased the cylinder, then discovered it to be bogus.   But while the effort failed, it shows what Bin Ladin and his \nassociates hoped to do. One of the al Qaeda representatives explained his mission: \"it's easy to kill more people \nwith uranium. \"  \n\nBin Ladin seemed willing to include in the confederation terrorists from\n\nalmost every corner of the Muslim world. His vision mirrored that of Sudan's Islamist leader, Turabi, who convened \na series of meetings under the label Popular Arab and Islamic Conference around the time of Bin Ladin's arrival in \nthat country. Delegations of violent Islamist extremists came from all the groups represented in Bin Ladin's Islamic \nArmy Shura. Representatives also came from organizations such as the Palestine Liberation Organization, Hamas, \nand Hezbollah.  \n\nTurabi sought to persuade Shiites and Sunnis to put aside their divisions and join against the common enemy. In \nlate 1991 or 1992, discussions in Sudan between al Qaeda and Iranian operatives led to an informal agreement to \ncooperate in providing support - even if only training - for actions carried out primarily against Israel and the United \nStates. Not long afterward, senior al Qaeda operatives and trainers traveled to Iran to receive training in explosives. \nIn the fall of 1993, another such delegation went to the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon for further training in explosives as \nwell as in intelligence and security. Bin Ladin reportedly showed particular interest in learning how to use truck \nbombs such as the one that had killed 241 U. S. Marines in Lebanon in 1983. The relationship between al Qaeda \nand Iran demonstrated that Sunni-Shia divisions did not necessarily pose an insurmountable barrier to cooperation \nin terrorist operations. As will be described in chapter 7, al Qaeda contacts with Iran continued in ensuing years.  \n\nBin Ladin was also willing to explore possibilities for cooperation with Iraq, even though Iraq's dictator, Saddam \nHussein, had never had an Islamist agenda - save for his opportunistic pose as a defender of the faithful against \n\"Crusaders\" during the Gulf War of 1991. Moreover, Bin Ladin had in fact been sponsoring anti-Saddam Islamists in \nIraqi Kurdistan, and sought to attract them into his Islamic army.  \n\n\n\nTo protect his own ties with Iraq, Turabi reportedly brokered an agreement that Bin Ladin would stop supporting \nactivities against Saddam. Bin Ladin apparently honored this pledge, at least for a time, although he continued to \naid a group of Islamist extremists operating in part of Iraq (Kurdistan) outside of Baghdad's control. In the late \n1990s, these extremist groups suffered major defeats by Kurdish forces. In 2001, with Bin Ladin's help they re-\nformed into an organization called Ansar al Islam. There are indications that by then the Iraqi regime tolerated and \nmay even have helped Ansar al Islam against the common Kurdish enemy.  \n\nWith the Sudanese regime acting as intermediary, Bin Ladin himself met with a senior Iraqi intelligence officer in \nKhartoum in late 1994 or early 1995. Bin Ladin is said to have asked for space to establish training camps, as well \nas assistance in procuring weapons, but there is no evidence that Iraq responded to this request.   As described \nbelow, the ensuing years saw additional efforts to establish connections.\n\nSudan Becomes a Doubtful Haven \n\nNot until 1998 did al Qaeda undertake a major terrorist operation of its own, in large part because Bin Ladin lost his \nbase in Sudan. Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western \ngovernments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, \nsuch as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their \nown pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational \nleader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside \npressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi.\n\nThe attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been \na tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and \nhelped by Bin Ladin.   When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the \nassassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned \nKhartoum in April 1996.  \n\nA clear signal to Bin Ladin that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it \nintended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Ladin had to tell the Libyans who \nhad been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. \nOutraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him.  \n\nBin Ladin also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the \nworld economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Ladin's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities \nbecame less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Ladin family also \nprobably took some toll. In any case, Bin Ladin found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his \noutlays more closely. He appointed a new financial manager, whom his followers saw as miserly.  \n\nMoney problems proved costly to Bin Ladin in other ways. Jamal Ahmed al Fadl, a Sudanese-born Arab, had spent \ntime in the United States and had been recruited for the Afghan war through the Farouq mosque in Brooklyn. He \nhad joined al Qaeda and taken the oath of fealty to Bin Ladin, serving as one of his business agents. Then Bin \nLadin discovered that Fadl had skimmed about $110, 000, and he asked for restitution. Fadl resented receiving a \nsalary of only $500 a month while some of the Egyptians in al Qaeda were given $1, 200 a month. He defected and \nbecame a star informant for the United States. Also testifying about al Qaeda in a U. S. court was L'Houssaine \nKherchtou, who told of breaking with Bin Ladin because of Bin Ladin's professed inability to provide him with money \nwhen his wife needed a caesarian section.  \n\nIn February 1996, Sudanese officials began approaching officials from the\n\nUnited States and other governments, asking what actions of theirs might ease foreign pressure. In secret meetings \nwith Saudi officials, Sudan offered to expel Bin Ladin to Saudi Arabia and asked the Saudis to pardon him. U. S. \nofficials became aware of these secret discussions, certainly by March. Saudi officials apparently wanted Bin Ladin \nexpelled from Sudan. They had already revoked his citizenship, however, and would not tolerate his presence in \ntheir country. And Bin Ladin may have no longer felt safe in Sudan, where he had already escaped at least one \nassassination attempt that he believed to have been the work of the Egyptian or Saudi regimes, or both. In any \n\n\n\ncase, on May 19, 1996, Bin Ladin left Sudan - significantly weakened, despite his ambitions and organizational \nskills. He returned to Afghanistan.  \n\n2. 5 AL QAEDA'S RENEWAL IN AFGHANISTAN (1996-1998) \n\nBin Ladin flew on a leased aircraft from Khartoum to Jalalabad, with a refueling stopover in the United Arab \nEmirates.   He was accompanied by family members and bodyguards, as well as by al Qaeda members who had \nbeen close associates since his organization's 1988 founding in Afghanistan. Dozens of additional militants arrived \non later flights.  \n\nThough Bin Ladin's destination was Afghanistan, Pakistan was the nation that held the key to his ability to use \nAfghanistan as a base from which to revive his ambitious enterprise for war against the United States.\n\nFor the first quarter century of its existence as a nation, Pakistan's identity had derived from Islam, but its politics \nhad been decidedly secular. The army was - and remains - the country's strongest and most respected institution, \nand the army had been and continues to be preoccupied with its rivalry with India, especially over the disputed \nterritory of Kashmir.\n\nFrom the 1970s onward, religion had become an increasingly powerful force in Pakistani politics. After a coup in \n1977, military leaders turned to Islamist groups for support, and fundamentalists became more prominent. South \nAsia had an indigenous form of Islamic fundamentalism, which had developed in the nineteenth century at a school \nin the Indian village of Deoband.   The influence of the Wahhabi school of Islam had also grown, nurtured by \nSaudifunded institutions. Moreover, the fighting in Afghanistan made Pakistan home to an enormous - and \ngenerally unwelcome - population of Afghan refugees; and since the badly strained Pakistani education system \ncould not accommodate the refugees, the government increasingly let privately funded religious schools serve as a \ncost-free alternative. Over time, these schools produced large numbers of half-educated young men with no \nmarketable skills but with deeply held Islamic views.  \n\nPakistan's rulers found these multitudes of ardent young Afghans a source Afghanistan\n\n  \u2022 \n\nof potential trouble at home but potentially useful abroad. Those who joined the Taliban movement, espousing a \nruthless version of Islamic law, perhaps could bring order in chaotic Afghanistan and make it a cooperative ally. \nThey thus might give Pakistan greater security on one of the several borders where Pakistani military officers hoped \nfor what they called \"strategic depth. \"  \n\nIt is unlikely that Bin Ladin could have returned to Afghanistan had Pakistan disapproved. The Pakistani military \nintelligence service probably had advance knowledge of his coming, and its officers may have facilitated his travel. \nDuring his entire time in Sudan, he had maintained guesthouses and training camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan. \nThese were part of a larger network used by diverse organizations for recruiting and training fighters for Islamic \ninsurgencies in such places as Tajikistan, Kashmir, and Chechnya. Pakistani intelligence officers reportedly \nintroduced Bin Ladin to Taliban leaders in Kandahar, their main base of power, to aid his reassertion of control over \ncamps near\n\nKhowst, out of an apparent hope that he would now expand the camps and make them available for training \nKashmiri militants.  \n\nYet Bin Ladin was in his weakest position since his early days in the war against the Soviet Union. The Sudanese \ngovernment had canceled the registration of the main business enterprises he had set up there and then put some \nof them up for public sale. According to a senior al Qaeda detainee, the government of Sudan seized everything Bin \nLadin had possessed there.  \n\nHe also lost the head of his military committee, Abu Ubaidah al Banshiri, one of the most capable and popular \nleaders of al Qaeda. While most of the group's key figures had accompanied Bin Ladin to Afghanistan, Banshiri had \nremained in Kenya to oversee the training and weapons shipments of the cell set up some four years earlier. He \ndied in a ferryboat accident on Lake Victoria just a few days after Bin Ladin arrived in Jalalabad, leaving Bin Ladin \nwith a need to replace him not only in the Shura but also as supervisor of the cells and prospective operations in \n\n\n\nEast Africa.   He had to make other adjustments as well, for some al Qaeda members viewed Bin Ladin's return to \nAfghanistan as occasion to go off in their own directions. Some maintained collaborative relationships with al \nQaeda, but many disengaged entirely.  \n\nFor a time, it may not have been clear to Bin Ladin that the Taliban would be his best bet as an ally. When he \narrived in Afghanistan, they controlled much of the country, but key centers, including Kabul, were still held by rival \nwarlords. Bin Ladin went initially to Jalalabad, probably because it was in an area controlled by a provincial council \nof Islamic leaders who were not major contenders for national power. He found lodgings with Younis Khalis, the \nhead of one of the main mujahideen factions. Bin Ladin apparently kept his options open, maintaining contacts with \nGulbuddin Hekmatyar, who, though an Islamic extremist, was also one of the Taliban's most militant opponents. But \nafter September 1996, when first Jalalabad and then Kabul fell to the Taliban, Bin Ladin cemented his ties with \nthem.  \n\nThat process did not always go smoothly. Bin Ladin, no longer constrained by the Sudanese, clearly thought that he \nhad new freedom to publish his appeals for jihad. At about the time when the Taliban were making their final drive \ntoward Jalalabad and Kabul, Bin Ladin issued his August 1996 fatwa, saying that \"We . . . have been prevented \nfrom addressing the Muslims, \" but expressing relief that \"by the grace of Allah, a safe base here is now available in \nthe high Hindu Kush mountains in Khurasan. \"But the Taliban, like the Sudanese, would eventually hear warnings, \nincluding from the Saudi monarchy.  \n\nThough Bin Ladin had promised Taliban leaders that he would be circumspect, he broke this promise almost \nimmediately, giving an inflammatory interview to CNN in March 1997. The Taliban leader Mullah Omar promptly \n\"invited\" Bin Ladin to move to Kandahar, ostensibly in the interests of Bin Ladin's own security but more likely to \nsituate him where he might be easier to control.  \n\nThere is also evidence that around this time Bin Ladin sent out a number of feelers to the Iraqi regime, offering \nsome cooperation. None are reported to have received a significant response. According to one report, Saddam \nHussein's efforts at this time to rebuild relations with the Saudis and other Middle Eastern regimes led him to stay \nclear of Bin Ladin.  \n\nIn mid-1998, the situation reversed; it was Iraq that reportedly took the initiative. In March 1998, after Bin Ladin's \npublic fatwa against the United States, two al Qaeda members reportedly went to Iraq to meet with Iraqi \nintelligence. In July, an Iraqi delegation traveled to Afghanistan to meet first with the Taliban and then with Bin \nLadin. Sources reported that one, or perhaps both, of these meetings was apparently arranged through Bin Ladin's \nEgyptian deputy, Zawahiri, who had ties of his own to the Iraqis. In 1998, Iraq was under intensifying U. S. \npressure, which culminated in a series of large air attacks in December.  \n\nSimilar meetings between Iraqi officials and Bin Ladin or his aides may have occurred in 1999 during a period of \nsome reported strains with the Taliban. According to the reporting, Iraqi officials offered Bin Ladin a safe haven in \nIraq. Bin Ladin declined, apparently judging that his circumstances in Afghanistan remained more favorable than \nthe Iraqi alternative. The reports describe friendly contacts and indicate some common themes in both sides' hatred \nof the United States. But to date we have seen no evidence that these or the earlier contacts ever developed into a \ncollaborative operational relationship. Nor have we seen evidence indicating that Iraq cooperated with al Qaeda in \ndeveloping or carrying out any attacks against the United States.  \n\nBin Ladin eventually enjoyed a strong financial position in Afghanistan, thanks to Saudi and other financiers \nassociated with the Golden Chain. Through his relationship with Mullah Omar - and the monetary and other benefits \nthat it brought the Taliban - Bin Ladin was able to circumvent restrictions; Mullah Omar would stand by him even \nwhen other Taliban leaders raised objections. Bin Ladin appeared to have in Afghanistan a freedom of movement \nthat he had lacked in Sudan. Al Qaeda members could travel freely within the country, enter and exit it without visas \nor any immigration procedures, purchase and import vehicles and weapons, and enjoy the use of official Afghan \nMinistry of Defense license plates. Al Qaeda also used the Afghan state-owned Ariana Airlines to courier money \ninto the country.  \n\nThe Taliban seemed to open the doors to all who wanted to come to Afghanistan to train in the camps. The alliance \nwith the Taliban provided al Qaeda a sanctuary in which to train and indoctrinate fighters and terrorists, import \nweapons, forge ties with other jihad groups and leaders, and plot and staff terrorist schemes. While Bin Ladin \n\n\n\nmaintained his own al Qaeda guesthouses and camps for vetting and training recruits, he also provided support to \nand bene-\n\nfited from the broad infrastructure of such facilities in Afghanistan made available to the global network of Islamist \nmovements. U. S. intelligence estimates put the total number of fighters who underwent instruction in Bin Ladin-\nsupported camps in Afghanistan from 1996 through 9/11 at 10, 000 to 20, 000.  \n\nIn addition to training fighters and special operators, this larger network of guesthouses and camps provided a \nmechanism by which al Qaeda could screen and vet candidates for induction into its own organization. Thousands \nflowed through the camps, but no more than a few hundred seem to have become al Qaeda members. From the \ntime of its founding, al Qaeda had employed training and indoctrination to identify \"worthy\" candidates.  \n\nAl Qaeda continued meanwhile to collaborate closely with the many Middle Eastern groups - in Egypt, Algeria, \nYemen, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia, Somalia, and elsewhere - with which it had been linked when Bin Ladin was in \nSudan. It also reinforced its London base and its other offices around Europe, the Balkans, and the Caucasus. Bin \nLadin bolstered his links to extremists in South and Southeast Asia, including the Malaysian-Indonesian JI and \nseveral Pakistani groups engaged in the Kashmir conflict.  \n\nThe February 1998 fatwa thus seems to have been a kind of public launch of a renewed and stronger al Qaeda, \nafter a year and a half of work. Having rebuilt his fund-raising network, Bin Ladin had again become the rich man of \nthe jihad movement. He had maintained or restored many of his links with terrorists elsewhere in the world. And he \nhad strengthened the internal ties in his own organization.\n\nThe inner core of al Qaeda continued to be a hierarchical top-down group with defined positions, tasks, and \nsalaries. Most but not all in this core swore fealty (or bayat ) to Bin Ladin. Other operatives were committed to Bin \nLadin or to his goals and would take assignments for him, but they did not swear bayat and maintained, or tried to \nmaintain, some autonomy. A looser circle of adherents might give money to al Qaeda or train in its camps but \nremained essentially independent. Nevertheless, they constituted a potential resource for al Qaeda.  \n\nNow effectively merged with Zawahiri's Egyptian Islamic Jihad,   al Qaeda promised to become the general \nheadquarters for international terrorism, without the need for the Islamic Army Shura. Bin Ladin was prepared to \npick up where he had left off in Sudan. He was ready to strike at \"the head of the snake. \"\n\nAl Qaeda's role in organizing terrorist operations had also changed. Before the move to Afghanistan, it had \nconcentrated on providing funds, training, and weapons for actions carried out by members of allied groups. The \nattacks on the U. S. embassies in East Africa in the summer of 1998 would take a different form - planned, directed, \nand executed by al Qaeda, under the direct supervision of Bin Ladin and his chief aides.\n\nThe Embassy Bombings \n\nAs early as December 1993, a team of al Qaeda operatives had begun casing targets in Nairobi for future attacks. It \nwas led by Ali Mohamed, a former Egyptian army officer who had moved to the United States in the mid-1980s, \nenlisted in the U. S. Army, and became an instructor at Fort Bragg. He had provided guidance and training to \nextremists at the Farouq mosque in Brooklyn, including some who were subsequently convicted in the February \n1993 attack on the World Trade Center. The casing team also included a computer expert whose write-ups were \nreviewed by al Qaeda leaders.  \n\nThe team set up a makeshift laboratory for developing their surveillance photographs in an apartment in Nairobi \nwhere the various al Qaeda operatives and leaders based in or traveling to the Kenya cell sometimes met. Banshiri, \nal Qaeda's military committee chief, continued to be the operational commander of the cell; but because he was \nconstantly on the move, Bin Ladin had dispatched another operative, Khaled al Fawwaz, to serve as the on-site \nmanager. The technical surveillance and communications equipment employed for these casing missions included \nstate-of-the-art video cameras obtained from China and from dealers in Germany. The casing team also \nreconnoitered targets in Djibouti.  \n\nAs early as January 1994, Bin Ladin received the surveillance reports, complete with diagrams prepared by the \nteam's computer specialist. He, his top military committee members - Banshiri and his deputy, Abu Hafs al Masri \n\n\n\n(also known as Mohammed Atef) - and a number of other al Qaeda leaders reviewed the reports. Agreeing that the \nU. S. embassy in Nairobi was an easy target because a car bomb could be parked close by, they began to form a \nplan. Al Qaeda had begun developing the tactical expertise for such attacks months earlier, when some of its \noperatives - top military committee members and several operatives who were involved with the Kenya cell among \nthem - were sent to Hezbollah training camps in Lebanon.  \n\nThe cell in Kenya experienced a series of disruptions that may in part account for the relatively long delay before \nthe attack was actually carried out. The difficulties Bin Ladin began to encounter in Sudan in 1995, his move to \nAfghanistan in 1996, and the months spent establishing ties with the Taliban may also have played a role, as did \nBanshiri's accidental drowning.\n\nIn August 1997, the Kenya cell panicked. The London Daily Telegraph reported that Madani al Tayyib, formerly \nhead of al Qaeda's finance committee, had turned himself over to the Saudi government. The article said \n(incorrectly) that the Saudis were sharing Tayyib's information with the U. S. and British authorities.   At almost the \nsame time, cell members learned that U. S. and Kenyan agents had searched the Kenya residence of Wadi al \nHage, who had become the new on-site manager in Nairobi, and that Hage's telephone was being tapped. Hage \nwas a U. S. citizen who had worked with Bin Ladin in Afgha-\n\nnistan in the 1980s, and in 1992 he went to Sudan to become one of al Qaeda's major financial operatives. When \nHage returned to the United States to appear before a grand jury investigating Bin Ladin, the job of cell manager \nwas taken over by Harun Fazul, a Kenyan citizen who had been in Bin Ladin's advance team to Sudan back in \n1990. Harun faxed a report on the \"security situation\" to several sites, warning that \"the crew members in East \nAfrica is [ sic ] in grave danger\" in part because \"America knows . . . that the followers of [Bin Ladin] . . . carried out \nthe operations to hit Americans in Somalia. \" The report provided instructions for avoiding further exposure.  \n\nOn February 23, 1998, Bin Ladin issued his public fatwa. The language had been in negotiation for some time, as \npart of the merger under way between Bin Ladin's organization and Zawahiri's Egyptian Islamic Jihad. Less than a \nmonth after the publication of the fatwa, the teams that were to carry out the embassy attacks were being pulled \ntogether in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. The timing and content of their instructions indicate that the decision to \nlaunch the attacks had been made by the time the fatwa was issued.  \n\nThe next four months were spent setting up the teams in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. Members of the cells rented \nresidences, and purchased bomb-making materials and transport vehicles. At least one additional explosives \nexpert was brought in to assist in putting the weapons together. In Nairobi, a hotel room was rented to put up some \nof the operatives. The suicide trucks were purchased shortly before the attack date.  \n\nWhile this was taking place, Bin Ladin continued to push his public message. On May 7, the deputy head of al \nQaeda's military committee, Mohammed Atef, faxed to Bin Ladin's London office a new fatwa issued by a group of \nsheikhs located in Afghanistan. A week later, it appeared in Al Quds al Arabi , the same Arabic-language \nnewspaper in London that had first published Bin Ladin's February fatwa, and it conveyed the same message - the \nduty of Muslims to carry out holy war against the enemies of Islam and to expel the Americans from the Gulf region. \nTwo weeks after that, Bin Ladin gave a videotaped interview to ABC News with the same slogans, adding that \"we \ndo not differentiate between those dressed in military uniforms and civilians; they are all targets in this fatwa . \"  \n\nBy August 1, members of the cells not directly involved in the attacks had mostly departed from East Africa. The \nremaining operatives prepared and assembled the bombs, and acquired the delivery vehicles. On August 4, they \nmade one last casing run at the embassy in Nairobi. By the evening of August 6, all but the delivery teams and one \nor two persons assigned to remove the evidence trail had left East Africa. Back in Afghanistan, Bin Ladin and the al \nQaeda leadership had left Kandahar for the countryside, expecting U. S. retaliation. Declarations taking credit for \nthe attacks had already been faxed to the joint al Qaeda-Egyptian Islamic Jihad office in Baku, with instructions to \nstand by\n\nfor orders to \"instantly\" transmit them to Al Quds al Arabi . One proclaimed \"the formation of the Islamic Army for \nthe Liberation of the Holy Places, \" and two others - one for each embassy - announced that the attack had been \ncarried out by a \"company\" of a \"battalion\" of this \"Islamic Army. \"  \n\n\n\nOn the morning of August 7, the bomb-laden trucks drove into the embassies roughly five minutes apart - about \n10:35 A. M. in Nairobi and 10:39 A. M. in Dar es Salaam. Shortly afterward, a phone call was placed from Baku to \nLondon. The previously prepared messages were then faxed to London.  \n\nThe attack on the U. S. embassy in Nairobi destroyed the embassy and killed 12 Americans and 201 others, almost \nall Kenyans. About 5, 000 people were injured. The attack on the U. S. embassy in Dar es Salaam killed 11 more \npeople, none of them Americans. Interviewed later about the deaths of the Africans, Bin Ladin answered that \"when \nit becomes apparent that it would be impossible to repel these Americans without assaulting them, even if this \ninvolved the killing of Muslims, this is permissible under Islam. \"Asked if he had indeed masterminded these \nbombings, Bin Ladin said that the World Islamic Front for jihad against \"Jews and Crusaders\" had issued a \"crystal \nclear\" fatwa. If the instigation for jihad against the Jews and the Americans to liberate the holy places \"is considered \na crime, \"he said, \"let history be a witness that I am a criminal. \"  \n\n3 COUNTERTERRORISM EVOLVES \n\nIn chapter 2, we described the growth of a new kind of terrorism, and a new terrorist organization - especially from \n1988 to 1998, when Usama Bin Ladin declared war and organized the bombing of two U. S. embassies. In this \nchapter, we trace the parallel evolution of government efforts to counter terrorism by Islamic extremists against the \nUnited States.\n\nWe mention many personalities in this report. As in any study of the U. S. government, some of the most important \ncharacters are institutions. We will introduce various agencies, and how they adapted to a new kind of terrorism.\n\n3. 1 FROM THE OLD TERRORISM TO THE NEW: THE FIRST WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING \n\nAt 18 minutes after noon on February 26, 1993, a huge bomb went off beneath the two towers of the World Trade \nCenter. This was not a suicide attack. The terrorists parked a truck bomb with a timing device on Level B-2 of the \nunderground garage, then departed. The ensuing explosion opened a hole seven stories up. Six people died. More \nthan a thousand were injured. An FBI agent at the scene described the relatively low number of fatalities as a \nmiracle.  \n\nPresident Bill Clinton ordered his National Security Council to coordinate the response. Government agencies \nswung into action to find the culprits. The Counterterrorist Center located at the CIA combed its files and queried \nsources around the world. The National Security Agency (NSA), the huge Defense Department signals collection \nagency, ramped up its communications intercept network and searched its databases for clues.   The New York \nField Office of the FBI took control of the local investigation and, in the end, set a pattern for future management of \nterrorist incidents.\n\nFour features of this episode have significance for the story of 9/11.\n\nFirst, the bombing signaled a new terrorist challenge, one whose rage and malice had no limit. Ramzi Yousef, the \nSunni extremist who planted the bomb, said later that he had hoped to kill 250, 000 people.  \n\nSecond, the FBI and the Justice Department did excellent work investigating the bombing. Within days, the FBI \nidentified a truck remnant as part of a Ryder rental van reported stolen in Jersey City the day before the bombing.  \n\nMohammed Salameh, who had rented the truck and reported it stolen, kept calling the rental office to get back his \n$400 deposit. The FBI arrested him there on March 4, 1993. In short order, the Bureau had several plotters in \ncustody, including Nidal Ayyad, an engineer who had acquired chemicals for the bomb, and Mahmoud Abouhalima, \nwho had helped mix the chemicals.  \n\nThe FBI identified another conspirator, Ahmad Ajaj, who had been arrested by immigration authorities at John F. \nKennedy International Airport in September 1992 and charged with document fraud. His traveling companion was \nRamzi Yousef, who had also entered with fraudulent documents but claimed political asylum and was admitted. It \nquickly became clear that Yousef had been a central player in the attack. He had fled to Pakistan immediately after \nthe bombing and would remain at large for nearly two years.  \n\n\n\nThe arrests of Salameh, Abouhalima, and Ayyad led the FBI to the Farouq mosque in Brooklyn, where a central \nfigure was Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, an extremist Sunni Muslim cleric who had moved to the United States from \nEgypt in 1990. In speeches and writings, the sightless Rahman, often called the \"Blind Sheikh, \" preached the \nmessage of Sayyid Qutb's Milestones , characterizing the United States as the oppressor of Muslims worldwide and \nasserting that it was their religious duty to fight against God's enemies. An FBI informant learned of a plan to bomb \nmajor New York landmarks, including the Holland and Lincoln tunnels. Disrupting this \"landmarks plot, \" the FBI in \nJune 1993 arrested Rahman and various confederates.  \n\nAs a result of the investigations and arrests, the U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York prosecuted \nand convicted multiple individuals, including Ajaj, Salameh, Ayyad, Abouhalima, the Blind Sheikh, and Ramzi \nYousef, for crimes related to the World Trade Center bombing and other plots.\n\nAn unfortunate consequence of this superb investigative and prosecutorial effort was that it created an impression \nthat the law enforcement system was well-equipped to cope with terrorism. Neither President Clinton, his principal \nadvisers, the Congress, nor the news media felt prompted, until later, to press the question of whether the \nprocedures that put the Blind Sheikh and Ramzi Yousef behind bars would really protect Americans against the \nnew virus of which these individuals were just the first symptoms.  \n\nThird, the successful use of the legal system to address the first World Trade Center bombing had the side effect of \nobscuring the need to examine the character and extent of the new threat facing the United States. The trials did \nnot bring the Bin Ladin network to the attention of the public and policymakers.\n\nThe FBI assembled, and the U. S. Attorney's office put forward, some evidence showing that the men in the dock \nwere not the only plotters. Materials taken from Ajaj indicated that the plot or plots were hatched at or near the \nKhaldan camp, a terrorist training camp on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Ajaj had left Texas in April 1992 to go \nthere to learn how to construct bombs. He had met Ramzi Yousef in Pakistan, where they discussed bombing \ntargets in the United States and assembled a \"terrorist kit\" that included bomb-making manuals, operations \nguidance, videotapes advocating terrorist action against the United States, and false identification documents.  \n\nYousef was captured in Pakistan following the discovery by police in the Philippines in January 1995 of the Manila \nair plot, which envisioned placing bombs on board a dozen trans-Pacific airliners and setting them off \nsimultaneously. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed - Yousef 's uncle, then located in Qatar - was a fellow plotter of Yousef 's \nin the Manila air plot and had also wired him some money prior to the Trade Center bombing. The U. S. Attorney \nobtained an indictment against KSM in January 1996, but an official in the government of Qatar probably warned \nhim about it. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed evaded capture (and stayed at large to play a central part in the 9/11 \nattacks).  \n\nThe law enforcement process is concerned with proving the guilt of persons apprehended and charged. \nInvestigators and prosecutors could not present all the evidence of possible involvement of individuals other than \nthose charged, although they continued to pursue such investigations, planning or hoping for later prosecutions. \nThe process was meant, by its nature, to mark for the public the events as finished - case solved, justice done. It \nwas not designed to ask if the events might be harbingers of worse to come. Nor did it allow for aggregating and \nanalyzing facts to see if they could provide clues to terrorist tactics more generally - methods of entry and finance, \nand mode of operation inside the United States.\n\nFourth, although the bombing heightened awareness of a new terrorist danger, successful prosecutions contributed \nto widespread underestimation of the threat. The government's attorneys stressed the seriousness of the crimes, \nand put forward evidence of Yousef 's technical ingenuity. Yet the public image that persisted was not of clever \nYousef but of stupid Salameh going back again and again to reclaim his $400 truck rental deposit.\n\n3. 2 ADAPTATION - AND NONADAPTATION - IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY \n\nLegal processes were the primary method for responding to these early manifestations of a new type of terrorism. \nOur overview of U. S. capabilities for dealing with it thus begins with the nation's vast complex of law enforcement \nagencies.\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department and the FBI \n\nAt the federal level, much law enforcement activity is concentrated in the Department of Justice. For countering \nterrorism, the dominant agency under Justice is the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The FBI does not have a \ngeneral grant of authority but instead works under specific statutory authorizations. Most of its work is done in local \noffices called field offices. There are 56 of them, each covering a specified geographic area, and each quite \nseparate from all others. Prior to 9/11, the special agent in charge was in general free to set his or her office's \npriorities and assign personnel accordingly.  \n\nThe office's priorities were driven by two primary concerns. First, performance in the Bureau was generally \nmeasured against statistics such as numbers of arrests, indictments, prosecutions, and convictions. \nCounterterrorism and counterintelligence work, often involving lengthy intelligence investigations that might never \nhave positive or quantifiable results, was not career-enhancing. Most agents who reached management ranks had \nlittle counterterrorism experience. Second, priorities were driven at the local level by the field offices, whose \nconcerns centered on traditional crimes such as white-collar offenses and those pertaining to drugs and gangs. \nIndividual field offices made choices to serve local priorities, not national priorities.  \n\nThe Bureau also operates under an \"office of origin\" system. To avoid duplication and possible conflicts, the FBI \ndesignates a single office to be in charge of an entire investigation. Because the New York Field Office indicted Bin \nLadin prior to the East Africa bombings, it became the office of origin for all Bin Ladin cases, including the East \nAfrica bombings and later the attack on the USS Cole . Most of the FBI's institutional knowledge on Bin Ladin and al \nQaeda resided there. This office worked closely with the U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York to \nidentify, arrest, prosecute, and convict many of the perpetrators of the attacks and plots. Field offices other than the \nspecified office of origin were often reluctant to spend much energy on matters over which they had no control and \nfor which they received no credit.  \n\nThe FBI's domestic intelligence gathering dates from the 1930s. With World War II looming, President Franklin D. \nRoosevelt ordered FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to investigate foreign and foreign-inspired subversion - \nCommunist, Nazi, and Japanese. Hoover added investigation of possible espionage, sabotage, or subversion to the \nduties of field offices. After the war, foreign intelligence duties were assigned to the newly established Central \nIntelligence Agency. Hoover jealously guarded the FBI's domestic portfolio against all rivals. Hoover felt he was \naccountable only to the president, and the FBI's domestic intelligence activities kept growing. In the 1960s, the FBI \nwas receiving significant assistance within the United States from the CIA and from Army Intelligence. The legal \nbasis for some of this assistance was dubious.\n\nDecades of encouragement to perform as a domestic intelligence agency abruptly ended in the 1970s. Two years \nafter Hoover's death in 1972, congres-\n\nsional and news media investigations of the Watergate scandals of the Nixon administration expanded into general \ninvestigations of foreign and domestic intelligence by the Church and Pike committees.   They disclosed domestic \nintelligence efforts, which included a covert action program that operated from 1956 to 1971 against domestic \norganizations and, eventually, domestic dissidents. The FBI had spied on a wide range of political figures, \nespecially individuals whom Hoover wanted to discredit (notably the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. ), and had \nauthorized unlawful wiretaps and surveillance. The shock registered in public opinion polls, where the percentage of \nAmericans declaring a \"highly favorable\" view of the FBI dropped from 84 percent to 37 percent. The FBI's \nDomestic Intelligence Division was dissolved.  \n\nIn 1976, Attorney General Edward Levi adopted domestic security guidelines to regulate intelligence collection in \nthe United States and to deflect calls for even stronger regulation. In 1983, Attorney General William French Smith \nrevised the Levi guidelines to encourage closer investigation of potential terrorism. He also loosened the rules \ngoverning authorization for investigations and their duration. Still, his guidelines, like Levi's, took account of the \nreality that suspicion of \"terrorism, \" like suspicion of \"subversion, \" could lead to making individuals targets for \ninvestigation more because of their beliefs than because of their acts. Smith's guidelines also took account of the \nreality that potential terrorists were often members of extremist religious organizations and that investigation of \nterrorism could cross the line separating state and church.  \n\n\n\nIn 1986, Congress authorized the FBI to investigate terrorist attacks against Americans that occur outside the \nUnited States. Three years later, it added authority for the FBI to make arrests abroad without consent from the \nhost country. Meanwhile, a task force headed by Vice President George H. W. Bush had endorsed a concept \nalready urged by Director of Central Intelligence William Casey - a Counterterrorist Center, where the FBI, the CIA, \nand other organizations could work together on international terrorism. While it was distinctly a CIA entity, the FBI \ndetailed officials to work at the Center and obtained leads that helped in the capture of persons wanted for trial in \nthe United States.\n\nThe strengths that the FBI brought to counterterrorism were nowhere more brilliantly on display than in the case of \nPan American Flight 103, bound from London to New York, which blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December \n1988, killing 270 people. Initial evidence pointed to the government of Syria and, later, Iran. The Counterterrorist \nCenter reserved judgment on the perpetrators of the attack. Meanwhile, FBI technicians, working with U. K. security \nservices, gathered and analyzed the widely scattered fragments of the airliner. In 1991, with the help of the \nCounterterrorist Center, they identified one small fragment as part of a timing device - to the technicians, as \ndistinctive as DNA. It was a Libyan device. Together with other evidence, the FBI put together a\n\ncase pointing conclusively to the Libyan government. Eventually Libya acknowledged its responsibility.   Pan Am \n103 became a cautionary tale against rushing to judgment in attributing responsibility for a terrorist act. It also \nshowed again how - given a case to solve - the FBI remained capable of extraordinary investigative success.\n\nFBI Organization and Priorities \n\nIn 1993, President Clinton chose Louis Freeh as the Director of the Bureau. Freeh, who would remain Director until \nJune 2001, believed that the FBI's work should be done primarily by the field offices. To emphasize this view he cut \nheadquarters staff and decentralized operations. The special agents in charge gained power, influence, and \nindependence.  \n\nFreeh recognized terrorism as a major threat. He increased the number of legal attache offices abroad, focusing in \nparticular on the Middle East. He also urged agents not to wait for terrorist acts to occur before taking action. In his \nfirst budget request to Congress after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, he stated that \"merely solving this \ntype of crime is not enough; it is equally important that the FBI thwart terrorism before such acts can be perpetrated. \n\" Within headquarters, he created a Counterterrorism Division that would complement the Counterterrorist Center at \nthe CIA and arranged for exchanges of senior FBI and CIA counterterrorism officials. He pressed for more \ncooperation between legal attaches and CIA stations abroad.  \n\nFreeh's efforts did not, however, translate into a significant shift of resources to counterterrorism. FBI, Justice, and \nOffice of Management and Budget officials said that FBI leadership seemed unwilling to shift resources to terrorism \nfrom other areas such as violent crime and drug enforcement; other FBI officials blamed Congress and the OMB for \na lack of political will and failure to understand the FBI's counterterrorism resource needs. In addition, Freeh did not \nimpose his views on the field offices. With a few notable exceptions, the field offices did not apply significant \nresources to terrorism and often reprogrammed funds for other priorities.  \n\nIn 1998, the FBI issued a five-year strategic plan led by its deputy director, Robert \"Bear\" Bryant. For the first time, \nthe FBI designated national and economic security, including counterterrorism, as its top priority. Dale Watson, who \nwould later become the head of the new Counterterrorism Division, said that after the East Africa bombings, \"the \nlight came on\" that cultural change had to occur within the FBI. The plan mandated a stronger intelligence collection \neffort. It called for a nationwide automated system to facilitate information collection, analysis, and dissemination. It \nenvisioned the creation of a professional intelligence cadre of experienced and trained agents and analysts. If \nsuccessfully implemented, this would have been a major step toward addressing terrorism systematically, rather \nthan as individual unrelated cases. But the plan did not succeed.  \n\nFirst, the plan did not obtain the necessary human resources. Despite des-\n\nignating \"national and economic security\" as its top priority in 1998, the FBI did not shift human resources \naccordingly. Although the FBI's counterterrorism budget tripled during the mid-1990s, FBI counterterrorism \n\n\n\nspending remained fairly constant between fiscal years 1998 and 2001. In 2000, there were still twice as many \nagents devoted to drug enforcement as to counterterrorism.  \n\nSecond, the new division intended to strengthen the FBI's strategic analysis capability faltered. It received \ninsufficient resources and faced resistance from senior managers in the FBI's operational divisions. The new \ndivision was supposed to identify trends in terrorist activity, determine what the FBI did not know, and ultimately \ndrive collection efforts. However, the FBI had little appreciation for the role of analysis. Analysts continued to be \nused primarily in a tactical fashion - providing support for existing cases. Compounding the problem was the FBI's \ntradition of hiring analysts from within instead of recruiting individuals with the relevant educational background and \nexpertise.  \n\nMoreover, analysts had difficulty getting access to the FBI and intelligence community information they were \nexpected to analyze. The poor state of the FBI's information systems meant that such access depended in large \npart on an analyst's personal relationships with individuals in the operational units or squads where the information \nresided. For all of these reasons, prior to 9/11 relatively few strategic analytic reports about counterterrorism had \nbeen completed. Indeed, the FBI had never completed an assessment of the overall terrorist threat to the U. S. \nhomeland.  \n\nThird, the FBI did not have an effective intelligence collection effort. Collection of intelligence from human sources \nwas limited, and agents were inadequately trained. Only three days of a 16-week agents' course were devoted to \ncounterintelligence and counterterrorism, and most subsequent training was received on the job. The FBI did not \nhave an adequate mechanism for validating source reporting, nor did it have a system for adequately tracking and \nsharing source reporting, either internally or externally. The FBI did not dedicate sufficient resources to the \nsurveillance and translation needs of counterterrorism agents. It lacked sufficient translators proficient in Arabic and \nother key languages, resulting in a significant backlog of untranslated intercepts.  \n\nFinally, the FBI's information systems were woefully inadequate. The FBI lacked the ability to know what it knew: \nthere was no effective mechanism for capturing or sharing its institutional knowledge. FBI agents did create records \nof interviews and other investigative efforts, but there were no reports officers to condense the information into \nmeaningful intelligence that could be retrieved and disseminated.  \n\nIn 1999, the FBI created separate Counterterrorism and Counterintelligence divisions. Dale Watson, the first head \nof the new Counterterrorism Division, recognized the urgent need to increase the FBI's counterterrorism capability. \nHis plan, called MAXCAP 05, was unveiled in 2000: it set the goal\n\nof bringing the Bureau to its \"maximum feasible capacity\" in counterterrorism by 2005. Field executives told Watson \nthat they did not have the analysts, linguists, or technically trained experts to carry out the strategy. In a report \nprovided to Director Robert Mueller in September 2001, one year after Watson presented his plan to field \nexecutives, almost every FBI field office was assessed to be operating below \"maximum capacity. \"The report \nstated that \"the goal to 'prevent terrorism' requires a dramatic shift in emphasis from a reactive capability to highly \nfunctioning intelligence capability which provides not only leads and operational support, but clear strategic analysis \nand direction. \"  \n\nLegal Constraints on the FBI and \"the Wall\" \n\nThe FBI had different tools for law enforcement and intelligence.   For criminal matters, it could apply for and use \ntraditional criminal warrants. For intelligence matters involving international terrorism, however, the rules were \ndifferent. For many years the attorney general could authorize surveillance of foreign powers and agents of foreign \npowers without any court review, but in 1978 Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.   This law \nregulated intelligence collection directed at foreign powers and agents of foreign powers in the United States. In \naddition to requiring court review of proposed surveillance (and later, physical searches), the 1978 act was \ninterpreted by the courts to require that a search be approved only if its \"primary purpose\" was to obtain foreign \nintelligence information. In other words, the authorities of the FISA law could not be used to circumvent traditional \ncriminal warrant requirements. The Justice Department interpreted these rulings as saying that criminal prosecutors \ncould be briefed on FISA information but could not direct or control its collection.  \n\n\n\nThroughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Justice prosecutors had informal arrangements for obtaining information \ngathered in the FISA process, the understanding being that they would not improperly exploit that process for their \ncriminal cases. Whether the FBI shared with prosecutors information pertinent to possible criminal investigations \nwas left solely to the judgment of the FBI.  \n\nBut the prosecution of Aldrich Ames for espionage in 1994 revived concerns about the prosecutors' role in \nintelligence investigations. The Department of Justice's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review (OIPR) is \nresponsible for reviewing and presenting all FISA applications to the FISA Court. It worried that because of the \nnumerous prior consultations between FBI agents and prosecutors, the judge might rule that the FISA warrants had \nbeen misused. If that had happened, Ames might have escaped conviction. Richard Scruggs, the acting head of \nOIPR, complained to Attorney General Janet Reno about the lack of information-sharing controls. On his own, he \nbegan imposing informationsharing procedures for FISA material. The Office of Intelligence Policy and Review \nbecame the gatekeeper for the flow of FISA information to criminal prosecutors.  \n\nIn July 1995, Attorney General Reno issued formal procedures aimed at managing information sharing between \nJustice Department prosecutors and the FBI. They were developed in a working group led by the Justice \nDepartment's Executive Office of National Security, overseen by Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick.   These \nprocedures - while requiring the sharing of intelligence information with prosecutors - regulated the manner in which \nsuch information could be shared from the intelligence side of the house to the criminal side.\n\nThese procedures were almost immediately misunderstood and misapplied. As a result, there was far less \ninformation sharing and coordination between the FBI and the Criminal Division in practice than was allowed under \nthe department's procedures. Over time the procedures came to be referred to as \"the wall. \" The term \"the wall\" is \nmisleading, however, because several factors led to a series of barriers to information sharing that developed.  \n\nThe Office of Intelligence Policy and Review became the sole gatekeeper for passing information to the Criminal \nDivision. Though Attorney General Reno's procedures did not include such a provision, the Office assumed the role \nanyway, arguing that its position reflected the concerns of Judge Royce Lamberth, then chief judge of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court. The Office threatened that if it could not regulate the flow of information to criminal \nprosecutors, it would no longer present the FBI's warrant requests to the FISA Court. The information flow withered.  \n\nThe 1995 procedures dealt only with sharing between agents and criminal prosecutors, not between two kinds of \nFBI agents, those working on intelligence matters and those working on criminal matters. But pressure from the \nOffice of Intelligence Policy Review, FBI leadership, and the FISA Court built barriers between agents - even agents \nserving on the same squads. FBI Deputy Director Bryant reinforced the Office's caution by informing agents that too \nmuch information sharing could be a career stopper. Agents in the field began to believe - incorrectly - that no FISA \ninformation could be shared with agents working on criminal investigations.  \n\nThis perception evolved into the still more exaggerated belief that the FBI could not share any intelligence \ninformation with criminal investigators, even if no FISA procedures had been used. Thus, relevant information from \nthe National Security Agency and the CIA often failed to make its way to criminal investigators. Separate reviews in \n1999, 2000, and 2001 concluded independently that information sharing was not occurring, and that the intent of \nthe 1995 procedures was ignored routinely.   We will describe some of the unfortunate consequences of these \naccumulated institutional beliefs and practices in chapter 8.\n\nThere were other legal limitations. Both prosecutors and FBI agents argued that they were barred by court rules \nfrom sharing grand jury information, even though the prohibition applied only to that small fraction that had been \npresented to a grand jury, and even that prohibition had exceptions. But as inter-\n\npreted by FBI field offices, this prohibition could conceivably apply to much of the information unearthed in an \ninvestigation. There were also restrictions, arising from executive order, on the commingling of domestic information \nwith foreign intelligence. Finally the NSA began putting caveats on its Bin Ladin-related reports that required prior \napproval before sharing their contents with criminal investigators and prosecutors. These developments further \nblocked the arteries of information sharing.  \n\nOther Law Enforcement Agencies \n\n\n\nThe Justice Department is much more than the FBI. It also has a U. S. Marshals Service, almost 4, 000 strong on \n9/11 and especially expert in tracking fugitives, with much local police knowledge. The department's Drug \nEnforcement Administration had, as of 2001, more than 4, 500 agents.   There were a number of occasions when \nDEA agents were able to introduce sources to the FBI or CIA for counterterrorism use.\n\nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), with its 9, 000 Border Patrol agents, 4, 500 inspectors, and 2, \n000 immigration special agents, had perhaps the greatest potential to develop an expanded role in \ncounterterrorism. However, the INS was focused on the formidable challenges posed by illegal entry over the \nsouthwest border, criminal aliens, and a growing backlog in the applications for naturalizing immigrants. The White \nHouse, the Justice Department, and above all the Congress reinforced these concerns. In addition, when Doris \nMeissner became INS Commissioner in 1993, she found an agency seriously hampered by outdated technology \nand insufficient human resources. Border Patrol agents were still using manual typewriters; inspectors at ports of \nentry were using a paper watchlist; the asylum and other benefits systems did not effectively deter fraudulent \napplicants.  \n\nCommissioner Meissner responded in 1993 to the World Trade Center bombing by providing seed money to the \nState Department's Consular Affairs Bureau to automate its terrorist watchlist, used by consular officers and border \ninspectors. The INS assigned an individual in a new \"lookout\" unit to work with the State Department in watchlisting \nsuspected terrorists and with the intelligence community and the FBI in determining how to deal with them when \nthey appeared at ports of entry. By 1998, 97 suspected terrorists had been denied admission at U. S. ports of entry \nbecause of the watchlist.  \n\nHow to conduct deportation cases against aliens who were suspected terrorists caused significant debate. The INS \nhad immigration law expertise and authority to bring the cases, but the FBI possessed the classified information \nsometimes needed as evidence, and information-sharing conflicts resulted. New laws in 1996 authorized the use of \nclassified evidence in removal hearings, but the INS removed only a handful of the aliens with links to terrorist \nactivity (none identified as associated with al Qaeda) using classified evidence.  \n\nMidlevel INS employees proposed comprehensive counterterrorism pro-\n\nposals to management in 1986, 1995, and 1997. No action was taken on them. In 1997, a National Security Unit \nwas set up to handle alerts, track potential terrorist cases for possible immigration enforcement action, and work \nwith the rest of the Justice Department. It focused on the FBI's priorities of Hezbollah and Hamas, and began to \nexamine how immigration laws could be brought to bear on terrorism. For instance, it sought unsuccessfully to \nrequire that CIA security checks be completed before naturalization applications were approved.   Policy questions, \nsuch as whether resident alien status should be revoked upon the person's conviction of a terrorist crime, were not \naddressed.\n\nCongress, with the support of the Clinton administration, doubled the number of Border Patrol agents required \nalong the border with Mexico to one agent every quarter mile by 1999. It rejected efforts to bring additional \nresources to bear in the north. The border with Canada had one agent for every 13. 25 miles. Despite examples of \nterrorists entering from Canada, awareness of terrorist activity in Canada and its more lenient immigration laws, and \nan inspector general's report recommending that the Border Patrol develop a northern border strategy, the only \npositive step was that the number of Border Patrol agents was not cut any further.  \n\nInspectors at the ports of entry were not asked to focus on terrorists. Inspectors told us they were not even aware \nthat when they checked the names of incoming passengers against the automated watchlist, they were checking in \npart for terrorists. In general, border inspectors also did not have the information they needed to make fact-based \ndeterminations of admissibility. The INS initiated but failed to bring to completion two efforts that would have \nprovided inspectors with information relevant to counterterrorism - a proposed system to track foreign student visa \ncompliance and a program to establish a way of tracking travelers' entry to and exit from the United States.  \n\nIn 1996, a new law enabled the INS to enter into agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies \nthrough which the INS provided training and the local agencies exercised immigration enforcement authority. \nTerrorist watchlists were not available to them. Mayors in cities with large immigrant populations sometimes \nimposed limits on city employee cooperation with federal immigration agents. A large population lives outside the \n\n\n\nlegal framework. Fraudulent documents could be easily obtained. Congress kept the number of INS agents static in \nthe face of the overwhelming problem.  \n\nThe chief vehicle for INS and for state and local participation in law enforcement was the Joint Terrorism Task \nForce (JTTF), first tried out in New York City in 1980 in response to a spate of incidents involving domestic terrorist \norganizations. This task force was managed by the New York Field Office of the FBI, and its existence provided an \nopportunity to exchange information and, as happened after the first World Trade Center bombing, to enlist local \nofficers, as well as other agency representatives, as partners in the FBI investigation. The FBI expanded the \nnumber of JTTFs throughout the 1990s, and by\n\n9/11 there were 34. While useful, the JTTFs had limitations. They set priorities in accordance with regional and field \noffice concerns, and most were not fully staffed. Many state and local entities believed they had little to gain from \nhaving a full-time representative on a JTTF.  \n\nOther federal law enforcement resources, also not seriously enlisted for counterterrorism, were to be found in the \nTreasury Department.\n\nTreasury housed the Secret Service, the Customs Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. \nGiven the Secret Service's mission to protect the president and other high officials, its agents did become involved \nwith those of the FBI whenever terrorist assassination plots were rumored.\n\nThe Customs Service deployed agents at all points of entry into the United States. Its agents worked alongside INS \nagents, and the two groups sometimes cooperated. In the winter of 1999-2000, as will be detailed in chapter 6, \nquestioning by an especially alert Customs inspector led to the arrest of an al Qaeda terrorist whose apparent \nmission was to bomb Los Angeles International Airport.\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms was used on occasion by the FBI as a resource. The ATF's \nlaboratories and analysis were critical to the investigation of the February 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center \nand the April 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.  \n\nBefore 9/11, with the exception of one portion of the FBI, very little of the sprawling U. S. law enforcement \ncommunity was engaged in countering terrorism. Moreover, law enforcement could be effective only after specific \nindividuals were identified, a plot had formed, or an attack had already occurred. Responsible individuals had to be \nlocated, apprehended, and transported back to a U. S. court for prosecution. As FBI agents emphasized to us, the \nFBI and the Justice Department do not have cruise missiles. They declare war by indicting someone. They took on \nthe lead role in addressing terrorism because they were asked to do so.  \n\n3. 3 . . . AND IN THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION \n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) within the Department of Transportation had been vested by Congress \nwith the sometimes conflicting mandate of regulating the safety and security of U. S. civil aviation while also \npromoting the civil aviation industry. The FAA had a security mission to protect the users of commercial air \ntransportation against terrorism and other criminal acts. In the years before 9/11, the FAA perceived sabotage as a \ngreater threat to aviation than hijacking. First, no domestic hijacking had occurred in a decade. Second, the \ncommercial aviation system was perceived as more vulnerable to explosives than to weapons such as firearms. \nFinally, explosives were\n\nperceived as deadlier than hijacking and therefore of greater consequence. In 1996, a presidential commission on \naviation safety and security chaired by Vice President Al Gore reinforced the prevailing concern about sabotage \nand explosives on aircraft. The Gore Commission also flagged, as a new danger, the possibility of attack by \nsurface-to-air missiles. Its 1997 final report did not discuss the possibility of suicide hijackings.  \n\nThe FAA set and enforced aviation security rules, which airlines and airports were required to implement. The rules \nwere supposed to produce a \"layered\" system of defense. This meant that the failure of any one layer of security \nwould not be fatal, because additional layers would provide backup security. But each layer relevant to hijackings - \nintelligence, passenger prescreening, checkpoint screening, and onboard security - was seriously flawed prior to \n\n\n\n9/11. Taken together, they did not stop any of the 9/11 hijackers from getting on board four different aircraft at three \ndifferent airports.  \n\nThe FAA's policy was to use intelligence to identify both specific plots and general threats to civil aviation security, \nso that the agency could develop and deploy appropriate countermeasures. The FAA's 40-person intelligence unit \nwas supposed to receive a broad range of intelligence data from the FBI, CIA, and other agencies so that it could \nmake assessments about the threat to aviation. But the large volume of data contained little pertaining to the \npresence and activities of terrorists in the United States. For example, information on the FBI's effort in 1998 to \nassess the potential use of flight training by terrorists and the Phoenix electronic communication of 2001 warning of \nradical Middle Easterners attending flight school were not passed to FAA headquarters. Several top FAA \nintelligence officials called the domestic threat picture a serious blind spot.  \n\nMoreover, the FAA's intelligence unit did not receive much attention from the agency's leadership. Neither \nAdministrator Jane Garvey nor her deputy routinely reviewed daily intelligence, and what they did see was \nscreened for them. She was unaware of a great amount of hijacking threat information from her own intelligence \nunit, which, in turn, was not deeply involved in the agency's policymaking process. Historically, decisive security \naction took place only after a disaster had occurred or a specific plot had been discovered.  \n\nThe next aviation security layer was passenger prescreening. The FAA directed air carriers not to fly individuals \nknown to pose a \"direct\" threat to civil aviation. But as of 9/11, the FAA's \"no-fly\" list contained the names of just 12 \nterrorist suspects (including 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed), even though government watchlists \ncontained the names of many thousands of known and suspected terrorists. This astonishing mismatch existed \ndespite the Gore Commission's having called on the FBI and CIA four years earlier to provide terrorist watchlists to \nimprove prescreening. The longtime chief of the FAA's civil aviation security division testified that he was not even \naware of the State Department's TIPOFF list of known and suspected ter-\n\nrorists (some 60, 000 before 9/11) until he heard it mentioned during the Commission's January 26, 2004, public \nhearing. The FAA had access to some TIPOFF data, but apparently found it too difficult to use.  \n\nThe second part of prescreening called on the air carriers to implement an FAA-approved computerized algorithm \n(known as CAPPS, for Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System) designed to identify passengers \nwhose profile suggested they might pose more than a minimal risk to aircraft. Although the algorithm included \nhijacker profile data, at that time only passengers checking bags were eligible to be selected by CAPPS for \nadditional scrutiny. Selection entailed only having one's checked baggage screened for explosives or held off the \nairplane until one had boarded. Primarily because of concern regarding potential discrimination and the impact on \npassenger throughput, \"selectees\" were no longer required to undergo extraordinary screening of their carry-on \nbaggage as had been the case before the system was computerized in 1997.   This policy change also reflected the \nperception that nonsuicide sabotage was the primary threat to civil aviation.\n\nCheckpoint screening was considered the most important and obvious layer of security. Walk-through metal \ndetectors and X-ray machines operated by trained screeners were employed to stop prohibited items. Numerous \ngovernment reports indicated that checkpoints performed poorly, often failing to detect even obvious FAA test \nitems. Many deadly and dangerous items did not set off metal detectors, or were hard to distinguish in an X-ray \nmachine from innocent everyday items.  \n\nWhile FAA rules did not expressly prohibit knives with blades under 4 inches long, the airlines' checkpoint \noperations guide (which was developed in cooperation with the FAA), explicitly permitted them. The FAA's basis for \nthis policy was (1) the agency did not consider such items to be menacing, (2) most local laws did not prohibit \nindividuals from carrying such knives, and (3) such knives would have been difficult to detect unless the sensitivity \nof metal detectors had been greatly increased. A proposal to ban knives altogether in 1993 had been rejected \nbecause small cutting implements were difficult to detect and the number of innocent \"alarms\" would have \nincreased significantly, exacerbating congestion problems at checkpoints.  \n\nSeveral years prior to 9/11, an FAA requirement for screeners to conduct \"continuous\" and \"random\" hand \nsearches of carry-on luggage at checkpoints had been replaced by explosive trace detection or had simply become \nignored by the air carriers. Therefore, secondary screening of individuals and their carry-on bags to identify \nweapons (other than bombs) was nonexistent, except for passengers who triggered the metal detectors. Even when \n\n\n\nsmall knives were detected by secondary screening, they were usually returned to the traveler. Reportedly, the 9/11 \nhijackers were instructed to use items that would be undetectable by airport checkpoints.  \n\nIn the pre-9/11 security system, the air carriers played a major role. As the\n\nInspector General of the Department of Transportation told us, there were great pressures from the air carriers to \ncontrol security costs and to \"limit the impact of security requirements on aviation operations, so that the industry \ncould concentrate on its primary mission of moving passengers and aircraft. . . . [T]hose counterpressures in turn \nmanifested themselves as significant weaknesses in security. \"A longtime FAA security official described the air \ncarriers' approach to security regulation as \"decry, deny and delay\" and told us that while \"the air carriers had seen \nthe enlightened hand of self-interest with respect to safety, they hadn't seen it in the security arena. \"  \n\nThe final layer, security on board commercial aircraft, was not designed to counter suicide hijackings. The FAA-\napproved \"Common Strategy\" had been elaborated over decades of experience with scores of hijackings, beginning \nin the 1960s. It taught flight crews that the best way to deal with hijackers was to accommodate their demands, get \nthe plane to land safely, and then let law enforcement or the military handle the situation. According to the FAA, the \nrecord had shown that the longer a hijacking persisted, the more likely it was to end peacefully. The strategy \noperated on the fundamental assumption that hijackers issue negotiable demands (most often for asylum or the \nrelease of prisoners) and that, as one FAA official put it, \"suicide wasn't in the game plan\" of hijackers. FAA training \nmaterial provided no guidance for flight crews should violence occur.  \n\nThis prevailing Common Strategy of cooperation and nonconfrontation meant that even a hardened cockpit door \nwould have made little difference in a hijacking. As the chairman of the Security Committee of the Air Line Pilots \nAssociation observed when proposals were made in early 2001 to install reinforced cockpit doors in commercial \naircraft, \"Even if you make a vault out of the door, if they have a noose around my flight attendant's neck, I'm going \nto open the door. \" Prior to 9/11, FAA regulations mandated that cockpit doors permit ready access into and out of \nthe cockpit in the event of an emergency. Even so, rules implemented in the 1960s required air crews to keep the \ncockpit door closed and locked in flight. This requirement was not always observed or vigorously enforced.  \n\nAs for law enforcement, there were only 33 armed and trained federal air marshals as of 9/11. They were not \ndeployed on U. S. domestic flights, except when in transit to provide security on international departures. This policy \nreflected the FAA's view that domestic hijacking was in check - a view held confidently as no terrorist had hijacked a \nU. S. commercial aircraft anywhere in the world since 1986.  \n\nIn the absence of any recent aviation security incident and without \"specific and credible\" evidence of a plot directed \nat civil aviation, the FAA's leadership focused elsewhere, including on operational concerns and the ever-present \nissue of safety. FAA Administrator Garvey recalled that \"every day in 2001 was like the day before Thanksgiving. \" \nHeeding calls for improved air\n\nservice, Congress concentrated its efforts on a \"passenger bill of rights, \" to improve capacity, efficiency, and \ncustomer satisfaction in the aviation system. There was no focus on terrorism.  \n\n3. 4 . . . AND IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY \n\nThe National Security Act of 1947 created the position of Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). Independent from \nthe departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U. S. intelligence \ncommunity and provides intelligence to federal entities.\n\nThe sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA. As an independent \nagency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources. The CIA's number one customer is the \npresident of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations.   Although covert \nactions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been \ncontroversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA.\n\nThe DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet. The director's power \nunder federal law over the loose, confederated \"intelligence community\" is limited.   He or she states the \n\n\n\ncommunity's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to \nCongress.\n\nThis responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies \nand has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the DCI's real \nauthority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned \nover the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense.\n\nIntelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U. S. spending \nfor intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense \nDepartment or military service needs.   As they are housed in the Defense Department, these agencies are keenly \nattentive to the military's strategic and tactical requirements.\n\nOne of the intelligence agencies in Defense with a national customer base is the National Security Agency, which \nintercepts and analyzes foreign communications and breaks codes. The NSA also creates codes and ciphers to \nprotect government information. Another is the recently renamed National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), \nwhich provides and analyzes imagery and produces a wide array of products, including maps, navigation tools, and \nsurveillance intelligence. A third such agency in Defense is the National Reconnaissance Office. It develops, \nprocures, launches, and maintains in orbit\n\ninformation-gathering satellites that serve other government agencies.\n\nThe Defense Intelligence Agency supports the secretary of defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and military field \ncommanders. It does some collection through human sources as well as some technical intelligence collection. The \nArmy, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps have their own intelligence components that collect information, help \nthem decide what weapons to acquire, and serve the tactical intelligence needs of their respective services.\n\nIn addition to those from the Department of Defense, other elements in the intelligence community include the \nnational security parts of the FBI; the Bureau of Intelligence and Research in the State Department; the intelligence \ncomponent of the Treasury Department; the Energy Department's Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, the \nformer of which, through leveraging the expertise of the national laboratory system, has special competence in \nnuclear weapons; the Office of Intelligence of the Coast Guard; and, today, the Directorate of Intelligence Analysis \nand Infrastructure Protection in the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe National Security Agency \n\nThe National Security Agency's intercepts of terrorist communications often set off alarms elsewhere in the \ngovernment. Often, too, its intercepts are conclusive elements in the analyst's jigsaw puzzle. NSA engineers build \ntechnical systems to break ciphers and to make sense of today's complex signals environment. Its analysts listen to \nconversations between foreigners not meant for them. They also perform \"traffic analysis\" - studying technical \ncommunications systems and codes as well as foreign organizational structures, including those of terrorist \norganizations.\n\nCold War adversaries used very hierarchical, familiar, and predictable military command and control methods. With \nglobalization and the telecommunications revolution, and with loosely affiliated but networked adversaries using \ncommercial devices and encryption, the technical impediments to signals collection grew at a geometric rate. At the \nsame time, the end of the Cold War and the resultant cuts in national security funding forced intelligence agencies \nto cut systems and seek economies of scale. Modern adversaries are skilled users of communications \ntechnologies. The NSA's challenges, and its opportunities, increased exponentially in \"volume, variety, and velocity. \n\"  \n\nThe law requires the NSA to not deliberately collect data on U. S. citizens or on persons in the United States \nwithout a warrant based on foreign intelligence requirements. Also, the NSA was supposed to let the FBI know of \nany indication of crime, espionage, or \"terrorist enterprise\" so that the FBI could obtain the appropriate warrant. \nLater in this story, we will learn that while the NSA had the technical capability to report on communications with \nsuspected terrorist facilities in the Middle East, the NSA did not seek FISA Court warrants to collect \ncommunications between individuals in the United States and\n\n\n\nforeign countries, because it believed that this was an FBI role. It also did not want to be viewed as targeting \npersons in the United States and possibly violating laws that governed NSA's collection of foreign intelligence.  \n\nAn almost obsessive protection of sources and methods by the NSA, and its focus on foreign intelligence, and its \navoidance of anything domestic would, as will be seen, be important elements in the story of 9/11.\n\nTechnology as an Intelligence Asset and Liability \n\nThe application of newly developed scientific technology to the mission of U. S. war fighters and national security \ndecisionmakers is one of the great success stories of the twentieth century. It did not happen by accident. Recent \nwars have been waged and won decisively by brave men and women using advanced technology that was \ndeveloped, authorized, and paid for by conscientious and diligent executive and legislative branch leaders many \nyears earlier.\n\nThe challenge of technology, however, is a daunting one. It is expensive, sometimes fails, and often can create \nproblems as well as solve them. Some of the advanced technologies that gave us insight into the closed-off \nterritories of the Soviet Union during the Cold War are of limited use in identifying and tracking individual terrorists.\n\nTerrorists, in turn, have benefited from this same rapid development of communication technologies. They simply \ncould buy off the shelf and harvest the products of a $3 trillion a year telecommunications industry. They could \nacquire without great expense communication devices that were varied, global, instantaneous, complex, and \nencrypted.\n\nThe emergence of the World Wide Web has given terrorists a much easier means of acquiring information and \nexercising command and control over their operations. The operational leader of the 9/11 conspiracy, Mohamed \nAtta, went online from Hamburg, Germany, to research U. S. flight schools. Targets of intelligence collection have \nbecome more sophisticated. These changes have made surveillance and threat warning more difficult.\n\nDespite the problems that technology creates, Americans' love affair with it leads them to also regard it as the \nsolution. But technology produces its best results when an organization has the doctrine, structure, and incentives \nto exploit it. For example, even the best information technology will not improve information sharing so long as the \nintelligence agencies' personnel and security systems reward protecting information rather than disseminating it.\n\nThe CIA \n\nThe CIA is a descendant of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which President Roosevelt created early in \nWorld War II after having first thought the FBI might take that role. The father of the OSS was William J. \"Wild Bill\" \nDonovan, a Wall Street lawyer. He recruited into the OSS others like himself - well traveled, well connected, well-to-\ndo professional men and women.  \n\nAn innovation of Donovan's, whose legacy remains part of U. S. intelligence today, was the establishment of a \nResearch and Analysis Branch. There large numbers of scholars from U. S. universities pored over accounts from \nspies, communications intercepted by the armed forces, transcripts of radio broadcasts, and publications of all \ntypes, and prepared reports on economic, political, and social conditions in foreign theaters of operation.\n\nAt the end of World War II, to Donovan's disappointment, President Harry Truman dissolved the Office of Strategic \nServices. Four months later, the President directed that \"all Federal foreign intelligence activities be planned, \ndeveloped and coordinated so as to assure the most effective accomplishment of the intelligence mission related to \nthe national security, \" under a National Intelligence Authority consisting of the secretaries of State, War, and the \nNavy, and a personal representative of the president. This body was to be assisted by a Central Intelligence Group, \nmade up of persons detailed from the departments of each of the members and headed by a Director of Central \nIntelligence.  \n\nSubsequently, President Truman agreed to the National Security Act of 1947, which, among other things, \nestablished the Central Intelligence Agency, under the Director of Central Intelligence. Lobbying by the FBI, \ncombined with fears of creating a U. S. Gestapo,   led to the FBI's being assigned responsibility for internal security \n\n\n\nfunctions and counterespionage. The CIA was specifically accorded \"no police, subpoena, or law enforcement \npowers or internal security functions. \"   This structure built in tensions between the CIA and the Defense \nDepartment's intelligence agencies, and between the CIA and the FBI.\n\nClandestine and Covert Action. With this history, the CIA brought to the era of 9/11 many attributes of an elite \norganization, viewing itself as serving on the nation's front lines to engage America's enemies. Officers in its \nClandestine Service, under what became the Directorate of Operations, fanned out into stations abroad. Each chief \nof station was a very important person in the organization, given the additional title of the DCI's representative in \nthat country. He (occasionally she) was governed by an operating directive that listed operational priorities issued \nby the relevant regional division of the Directorate, constrained by centrally determined allocations of resources.\n\nBecause the conduct of espionage was a high-risk activity, decisions on the clandestine targeting, recruitment, \nhandling, and termination of secret sources and the dissemination of collected information required Washington's \napproval and action. But in this decentralized system, analogous in some ways to the culture of the FBI field offices \nin the United States, everyone in the Directorate of Operations presumed that it was the job of headquarters to \nsupport the field, rather than manage field activities.\n\nIn the 1960s, the CIA suffered exposure of its botched effort to land Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs. The Vietnam \nWar brought on more criticism. A promi-\n\nnent feature of the Watergate era was investigations of the CIA by committees headed by Frank Church in the \nSenate and Otis Pike in the House. They published evidence that the CIA had secretly planned to assassinate Fidel \nCastro and other foreign leaders. The President had not taken plain responsibility for these judgments. CIA officials \nhad taken most of the blame, saying they had done so in order to preserve the President's \"plausible deniability. \"  \n\nAfter the Watergate era, Congress established oversight committees to ensure that the CIA did not undertake \ncovert action contrary to basic American law. Case officers in the CIA's Clandestine Service interpreted legislation, \nsuch as the Hughes-Ryan Amendment requiring that the president approve and report to Congress any covert \naction, as sending a message to them that covert action often leads to trouble and can severely damage one's \ncareer. Controversies surrounding Central American covert action programs in the mid-1980s led to the indictment \nof several senior officers of the Clandestine Service. During the 1990s, tension sometimes arose, as it did in the \neffort against al Qaeda, between policymakers who wanted the CIA to undertake more aggressive covert action and \nwary CIA leaders who counseled prudence and making sure that the legal basis and presidential authorization for \ntheir actions were undeniably clear.\n\nThe Clandestine Service felt the impact of the post-Cold War peace dividend, with cuts beginning in 1992. As the \nnumber of officers declined and overseas facilities were closed, the DCI and his managers responded to developing \ncrises in the Balkans or in Africa by \"surging, \" or taking officers from across the service to use on the immediate \nproblem. In many cases the surge officers had little familiarity with the new issues. Inevitably, some parts of the \nworld and some collection targets were not fully covered, or not covered at all. This strategy also placed great \nemphasis on close relations with foreign liaison services, whose help was needed to gain information that the \nUnited States itself did not have the capacity to collect.\n\nThe nadir for the Clandestine Service was in 1995, when only 25 trainees became new officers.   In 1998, the DCI \nwas able to persuade the administration and the Congress to endorse a long-range rebuilding program. It takes five \nto seven years of training, language study, and experience to bring a recruit up to full performance.  \n\nAnalysis. The CIA's Directorate of Intelligence retained some of its original character of a university gone to war. Its \nmen and women tended to judge one another by the quantity and quality of their publications (in this case, \nclassified publications). Apart from their own peers, they looked for approval and guidance to policymakers. During \nthe 1990s and today, particular value is attached to having a contribution included in one of the classified daily \n\"newspapers\" - the Senior Executive Intelligence Brief - or, better still, selected for inclusion in the President's Daily \nBrief.  \n\n\n\nThe CIA had been created to wage the Cold War. Its steady focus on one or two primary adversaries, decade after \ndecade, had at least one positive effect: it created an environment in which managers and analysts could safely \ninvest time and resources in basic research, detailed and reflective. Payoffs might not be immediate. But when they \nwrote their estimates, even in brief papers, they could draw on a deep base of knowledge.\n\nWhen the Cold War ended, those investments could not easily be reallocated to new enemies. The cultural effects \nran even deeper. In a more fluid international environment with uncertain, changing goals and interests, intelligence \nmanagers no longer felt they could afford such a patient, strategic approach to long-term accumulation of \nintellectual capital. A university culture with its versions of books and articles was giving way to the culture of the \nnewsroom.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the rise of round-the-clock news shows and the Internet reinforced pressure on analysts to pass \nalong fresh reports to policymakers at an ever-faster pace, trying to add context or supplement what their \ncustomers were receiving from the media. Weaknesses in all-source and strategic analysis were highlighted by a \npanel, chaired by Admiral David Jeremiah, that critiqued the intelligence community's failure to foresee the nuclear \nweapons tests by India and Pakistan in 1998, as well as by a 1999 panel, chaired by Donald Rumsfeld, that \ndiscussed the community's limited ability to assess the ballistic missile threat to the United States. Both reports \ncalled attention to the dispersal of effort on too many priorities, the declining attention to the craft of strategic \nanalysis, and security rules that prevented adequate sharing of information. Another Cold War craft had been an \nelaborate set of methods for warning against surprise attack, but that too had faded in analyzing new dangers like \nterrorism.  \n\nSecurity. Another set of experiences that would affect the capacity of the CIA to cope with the new terrorism traced \nback to the early Cold War, when the Agency developed a concern, bordering on paranoia, about penetration by \nthe Soviet KGB. James Jesus Angleton, who headed counterintelligence in the CIA until the early 1970s, became \nobsessed with the belief that the Agency harbored one or more Soviet \"moles. \"Although the pendulum swung back \nafter Angleton's forced retirement, it did not go very far. Instances of actual Soviet penetration kept apprehensions \nhigh.   Then, in the early 1990s, came the Aldrich Ames espionage case, which intensely embarrassed the CIA. \nThough obviously unreliable, Ames had been protected and promoted by fellow officers while he paid his bills by \nselling to the Soviet Union the names of U. S. operatives and agents, a number of whom died as a result.\n\nThe concern about security vastly complicated information sharing. Information was compartmented in order to \nprotect it against exposure to skilled and technologically sophisticated adversaries. There were therefore numerous \nrestrictions on handling information and a deep suspicion about sending infor-\n\nmation over newfangled electronic systems, like email, to other agencies of the U. S. government.  \n\nSecurity concerns also increased the difficulty of recruiting officers qualified for counterterrorism. Very few American \ncolleges or universities offered programs in Middle Eastern languages or Islamic studies. The total number of \nundergraduate degrees granted in Arabic in all U. S. colleges and universities in 2002 was six.   Many who had \ntraveled much outside the United States could expect a very long wait for initial clearance. Anyone who was \nforeign-born or had numerous relatives abroad was well-advised not even to apply. With budgets for the CIA \nshrinking after the end of the Cold War, it was not surprising that, with some notable exceptions, new hires in the \nClandestine Service tended to have qualifications similar to those of serving officers: that is, they were suited for \ntraditional agent recruitment or for exploiting liaison relationships with foreign services but were not equipped to \nseek or use assets inside the terrorist network.\n\nEarly Counterterrorism Efforts \n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, terrorism had been tied to regional conflicts, mainly in the Middle East. The majority of \nterrorist groups either were sponsored by governments or, like the Palestine Liberation Organization, were militants \ntrying to create governments.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, on the basis of a report from a task force headed by Vice President George Bush and after \nterrorist attacks at airports in Rome and Athens, the DCI created a Counterterrorist Center to unify activities across \n\n\n\nthe Directorate of Operations and the Directorate of Intelligence. The Counterterrorist Center had representation \nfrom the FBI and other agencies. In the formal table of organization it reported to the DCI, but in fact most of the \nCenter's chiefs belonged to the Clandestine Service and usually looked for guidance to the head of the Directorate \nof Operations.  \n\nThe Center stimulated and coordinated collection of information by CIA stations, compiled the results, and passed \nselected reports to appropriate stations, the Directorate of Intelligence analysts, other parts of the intelligence \ncommunity, or to policymakers. The Center protected its bureaucratic turf. The Director of Central Intelligence had \nonce had a national intelligence officer for terrorism to coordinate analysis; that office was abolished in the late \n1980s and its duties absorbed in part by the Counterterrorist Center. Though analysts assigned to the Center \nproduced a large number of papers, the focus was support to operations. A CIA inspector general's report in 1994 \ncriticized the Center's capacity to provide warning of terrorist attacks.  \n\nSubsequent chapters will raise the issue of whether, despite tremendous talent, energy, and dedication, the \nintelligence community failed to do enough in coping with the challenge from Bin Ladin and al Qaeda. Confronted \nwith such questions, managers in the intelligence community often responded that they had meager resources with \nwhich to work.  \n\nCuts in national security expenditures at the end of the Cold War led to budget cuts in the national foreign \nintelligence program from fiscal years 1990 to 1996 and essentially flat budgets from fiscal years 1996 to 2000 \n(except for the so-called Gingrich supplemental to the FY1999 budget and two later, smaller supplementals). These \ncuts compounded the difficulties of the intelligence agencies. Policymakers were asking them to move into the \ndigitized future to fight against computer-to-computer communications and modern communication systems, while \nmaintaining capability against older systems, such as high-frequency radios and ultra-high- and very-high-frequency \n(line of sight) systems that work like old-style television antennas. Also, demand for imagery increased dramatically \nfollowing the success of the 1991 Gulf War. Both these developments, in turn, placed a premium on planning the \nnext generation of satellite systems, the cost of which put great pressure on the rest of the intelligence budget. As a \nresult, intelligence agencies experienced staff reductions, affecting both operators and analysts.  \n\nYet at least for the CIA, part of the burden in tackling terrorism arose from the background we have described: an \norganization capable of attracting extraordinarily motivated people but institutionally averse to risk, with its capacity \nfor covert action atrophied, predisposed to restrict the distribution of information, having difficulty assimilating new \ntypes of personnel, and accustomed to presenting descriptive reportage of the latest intelligence. The CIA, to put it \nanother way, needed significant change in order to get maximum effect in counterterrorism. President Clinton \nappointed George Tenet as DCI in 1997, and by all accounts terrorism was a priority for him. But Tenet's own \nassessment, when questioned by the Commission, was that in 2004, the CIA's clandestine service was still at least \nfive years away from being fully ready to play its counterterrorism role.   And while Tenet was clearly the leader of \nthe CIA, the intelligence community's confederated structure left open the question of who really was in charge of \nthe entire U. S. intelligence effort.\n\n3. 5 . . . AND IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT \n\nThe State Department \n\nThe Commission asked Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage in 2004 why the State Department had so long \npursued what seemed, and ultimately proved, to be a hopeless effort to persuade the Taliban regime in Afghanistan \nto deport Bin Ladin. Armitage replied:\"We do what the State Department does, we don't go out and fly bombers, we \ndon't do things like that[;] . . . we do our part in these things. \"  \n\nFifty years earlier, the person in Armitage's position would not have spoken of the Department of State as having \nsuch a limited role. Until the late 1950s, the department dominated the processes of advising the president and \nCon-\n\n\n\ngress on U. S. relations with the rest of the world. The National Security Council was created in 1947 largely as a \nresult of lobbying from the Pentagon for a forum where the military could object if they thought the State \nDepartment was setting national objectives that the United States did not have the wherewithal to pursue.\n\nThe State Department retained primacy until the 1960s, when the Kennedy and Johnson administrations turned \ninstead to Robert McNamara's Defense Department, where a mini-state department was created to analyze foreign \npolicy issues. President Richard Nixon then concentrated policy planning and policy coordination in a powerful \nNational Security Council staff, overseen by Henry Kissinger.\n\nIn later years, individual secretaries of state were important figures, but the department's role continued to erode. \nState came into the 1990s overmatched by the resources of other departments and with little support for its budget \neither in the Congress or in the president's Office of Management and Budget.\n\nLike the FBI and the CIA's Directorate of Operations, the State Department had a tradition of emphasizing service \nin the field over service in Washington. Even ambassadors, however, often found host governments not only \nmaking connections with the U. S. government through their own missions in Washington, but working through the \nCIA station or a Defense attache. Increasingly, the embassies themselves were overshadowed by powerful regional \ncommanders in chief reporting to the Pentagon.  \n\nCounterterrorism \n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the State Department managed counterterrorism policy. It was the official channel for \ncommunication with the governments presumed to be behind the terrorists. Moreover, since terrorist incidents of \nthis period usually ended in negotiations, an ambassador or other embassy official was the logical person to \nrepresent U. S. interests.\n\nKeeping U. S. diplomatic efforts against terrorism coherent was a recurring challenge. In 1976, at the direction of \nCongress, the department elevated its coordinator for combating terrorism to the rank equivalent to an assistant \nsecretary of state. As an \"ambassador at large, \" this official sought to increase the visibility of counterterrorism \nmatters within the department and to help integrate U. S. policy implementation among government agencies. The \nprolonged crisis of 1979-1981, when 53 Americans were held hostage at the U. S. embassy in Tehran, ended the \nState Department leadership in counterterrorism. President Carter's assertive national security advisor, Zbigniew \nBrzezinski, took charge, and the coordination function remained thereafter in the White House.\n\nPresident Reagan's second secretary of state, George Shultz, advocated active U. S. efforts to combat terrorism, \noften recommending the use of military force. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger opposed Shultz, who made \nlittle head-\n\nway against Weinberger, or even within his own department. Though Shultz elevated the status and visibility of \ncounterterrorism coordination by appointing as coordinator first L. Paul Bremer and then Robert Oakley, both senior \ncareer ambassadors of high standing in the Foreign Service, the department continued to be dominated by regional \nbureaus for which terrorism was not a first-order concern.\n\nSecretaries of state after Shultz took less personal interest in the problem. Only congressional opposition prevented \nPresident Clinton's first secretary of state, Warren Christopher, from merging terrorism into a new bureau that would \nhave also dealt with narcotics and crime. The coordinator under Secretary Madeleine Albright told the Commission \nthat his job was seen as a minor one within the department.   Although the description of his status has been \ndisputed, and Secretary Albright strongly supported the August 1998 strikes against Bin Ladin, the role played by \nthe Department of State in counterterrorism was often cautionary before 9/11. This was a reflection of the reality \nthat counterterrorism priorities nested within broader foreign policy aims of the U. S. government.\n\nState Department consular officers around the world, it should not be forgotten, were constantly challenged by the \nproblem of terrorism, for they handled visas for travel to the United States. After it was discovered that Abdel \nRahman, the Blind Sheikh, had come and gone almost at will, State initiated significant reforms to its watchlist and \nvisa-processing policies. In 1993, Congress passed legislation allowing State to retain visa-processing fees for \nborder security; those fees were then used by the department to fully automate the terrorist watchlist. By the late \n1990s, State had created a worldwide, real-time electronic database of visa, law enforcement, and watchlist \n\n\n\ninformation, the core of the post-9/11 border screening systems. Still, as will be seen later, the system had many \nholes.  \n\nThe Department of Defense \n\nThe Department of Defense is the behemoth among federal agencies. With an annual budget larger than the gross \ndomestic product of Russia, it is an empire. The Defense Department is part civilian, part military. The civilian \nsecretary of defense has ultimate control, under the president. Among the uniformed military, the top official is the \nchairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is supported by a Joint Staff divided into standard military staff \ncompartments - J-2 (intelligence), J-3 (operations), and so on.\n\nBecause of the necessary and demanding focus on the differing mission of each service, and their long and proud \ntraditions, the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps have often fought ferociously over roles and missions in \nwar fighting and over budgets and posts of leadership. Two developments diminished this competition.\n\nThe first was the passage by Congress in 1986 of the Goldwater-Nichols\n\nAct, which, among other things, mandated that promotion to high rank required some period of duty with a different \nservice or with a joint (i. e. , multiservice) command. This had strong and immediate effects, loosening the loyalties \nof senior officers to their separate services and causing them to think more broadly about the military establishment \nas a whole.   However, it also may have lessened the diversity of military advice and options presented to the \npresident. The Goldwater-Nichols example is seen by some as having lessons applicable to lessening competition \nand increasing cooperation in other parts of the federal bureaucracy, particularly the law enforcement and \nintelligence communities.\n\nThe second, related development was a significant transfer of planning and command responsibilities from the \nservice chiefs and their staffs to the joint and unified commands outside of Washington, especially those for \nStrategic Forces and for four regions:Europe, the Pacific, the Center, and the South. Posts in these commands \nbecame prized assignments for ambitious officers, and the voices of their five commanders in chief became as \ninfluential as those of the service chiefs.\n\nCounterterrorism \n\nThe Pentagon first became concerned about terrorism as a result of hostage taking in the 1970s. In June 1976, \nPalestinian terrorists seized an Air France plane and landed it at Entebbe in Uganda, holding 105 Israelis and other \nJews as hostages. A special Israeli commando force stormed the plane, killed all the terrorists, and rescued all but \none of the hostages. In October 1977, a West German special force dealt similarly with a Lufthansa plane sitting on \na tarmac in Mogadishu: every terrorist was killed, and every hostage brought back safely. The White House, \nmembers of Congress, and the news media asked the Pentagon whether the United States was prepared for \nsimilar action. The answer was no. The Army immediately set about creating the Delta Force, one of whose \nmissions was hostage rescue.\n\nThe first test for the new force did not go well. It came in April 1980 during the Iranian hostage crisis, when Navy \nhelicopters with Marine pilots flew to a site known as Desert One, some 200 miles southeast of Tehran, to \nrendezvous with Air Force planes carrying Delta Force commandos and fresh fuel. Mild sandstorms disabled three \nof the helicopters, and the commander ordered the mission aborted. But foul-ups on the ground resulted in the loss \nof eight aircraft, five airmen, and three marines. Remembered as \"Desert One, \"this failure remained vivid for \nmembers of the armed forces. It also contributed to the later Goldwater-Nichols reforms.\n\nIn 1983 came Hezbollah's massacre of the Marines in Beirut. President Reagan quickly withdrew U. S. forces from \nLebanon - a reversal later routinely cited by jihadists as evidence of U. S. weakness. A detailed investigation \nproduced a list of new procedures that would become customary for forces\n\ndeployed abroad. They involved a number of defensive measures, including caution not only about strange cars \nand trucks but also about unknown aircraft overhead. \"Force protection\" became a significant claim on the time and \nresources of the Department of Defense.\n\n\n\nA decade later, the military establishment had another experience that evoked both Desert One and the withdrawal \nfrom Beirut. The first President Bush had authorized the use of U. S. military forces to ensure humanitarian relief in \nwar-torn Somalia. Tribal factions interfered with the supply missions. By the autumn of 1993, U. S. commanders \nconcluded that the main source of trouble was a warlord, Mohammed Farrah Aidid. An Army special force launched \na raid on Mogadishu to capture him. In the course of a long night, two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down, 73 \nAmericans were wounded, 18 were killed, and the world's television screens showed images of an American corpse \ndragged through the streets by exultant Somalis. Under pressure from Congress, President Clinton soon ordered \nthe withdrawal of U. S. forces. \"Black Hawk down\" joined \"Desert One\" as a symbol among Americans in uniform, \ncode phrases used to evoke the risks of daring exploits without maximum preparation, overwhelming force, and a \nwell-defined mission.\n\nIn 1995-1996, the Defense Department began to invest effort in planning how to handle the possibility of a domestic \nterrorist incident involving weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The idea of a domestic command for homeland \ndefense began to be discussed in 1997, and in 1999 the Joint Chiefs developed a concept for the establishment of \na domestic Unified Command. Congress killed the idea. Instead, the Department established the Joint Forces \nCommand, located at Norfolk, Virginia, making it responsible for military response to domestic emergencies, both \nnatural and man-made.  \n\nPursuant to the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Domestic Preparedness Program, the Defense Department began in 1997 to \ntrain first responders in 120 of the nation's largest cities. As a key part of its efforts, Defense created National Guard \nWMD Civil Support Teams to respond in the event of a WMD terrorist incident. A total of 32 such National Guard \nteams were authorized by fiscal year 2001. Under the command of state governors, they provided support to civilian \nagencies to assess the nature of the attack, offer medical and technical advice, and coordinate state and local \nresponses.  \n\nThe Department of Defense, like the Department of State, had a coordinator who represented the department on \nthe interagency committee concerned with counterterrorism. By the end of President Clinton's first term, this official \nhad become the assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict.  \n\nThe experience of the 1980s had suggested to the military establishment that if it were to have a role in \ncounterterrorism, it would be a traditional military role - to act against state sponsors of terrorism. And the military \nhad what seemed an excellent example of how to do it. In 1986, a bomb went off at a\n\ndisco in Berlin, killing two American soldiers. Intelligence clearly linked the bombing to Libya's Colonel Muammar \nQadhafi. President Reagan ordered air strikes against Libya. The operation was not cost free: the United States \nlost two planes. Evidence accumulated later, including the 1988 bombing of Pan Am 103, clearly showed that the \noperation did not curb Qadhafi's interest in terrorism. However, it was seen at the time as a success. The lesson \nthen taken from Libya was that terrorism could be stopped by the use of U. S. air power that inflicted pain on the \nauthors or sponsors of terrorist acts.\n\nThis lesson was applied, using Tomahawk missiles, early in the Clinton administration. George H. W. Bush was \nscheduled to visit Kuwait to be honored for his rescue of that country in the Gulf War of 1991. Kuwaiti security \nservices warned Washington that Iraqi agents were planning to assassinate the former president. President Clinton \nnot only ordered precautions to protect Bush but asked about options for a reprisal against Iraq. The Pentagon \nproposed 12 targets for Tomahawk missiles. Debate in the White House and at the CIA about possible collateral \ndamage pared the list down to three, then to one - Iraqi intelligence headquarters in central Baghdad. The attack \nwas made at night, to minimize civilian casualties. Twenty-three missiles were fired. Other than one civilian \ncasualty, the operation seemed completely successful: the intelligence headquarters was demolished. No further \nintelligence came in about terrorist acts planned by Iraq.  \n\nThe 1986 attack in Libya and the 1993 attack on Iraq symbolized for the military establishment effective use of \nmilitary power for counterterrorism - limited retaliation with air power, aimed at deterrence. What remained was the \nhard question of how deterrence could be effective when the adversary was a loose transnational network.\n\n3. 6 . . . AND IN THE WHITE HOUSE \n\n\n\nBecause coping with terrorism was not (and is not) the sole province of any component of the U. S. government, \nsome coordinating mechanism is necessary. When terrorism was not a prominent issue, the State Department \ncould perform this role. When the Iranian hostage crisis developed, this procedure went by the board: National \nSecurity Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski took charge of crisis management.\n\nThe Reagan administration continued and formalized the practice of having presidential staff coordinate \ncounterterrorism. After the killing of the marines in Beirut, President Reagan signed National Security Directive 138, \ncalling for a \"shift . . . from passive to active defense measures\" and reprogramming or adding new resources to \neffect the shift. It directed the State Department \"to intensify efforts to achieve cooperation of other governments\" \nand the CIA to \"intensify use of liaison and other intelligence capabilities and also\n\nto develop plans and capability to preempt groups and individuals planning strikes against U. S. interests. \"  \n\nSpeaking to the American Bar Association in July 1985, the President characterized terrorism as \"an act of war\" \nand declared:\"There can be no place on earth left where it is safe for these monsters to rest, to train, or practice \ntheir cruel and deadly skills. We must act together, or unilaterally, if necessary to ensure that terrorists have no \nsanctuary - anywhere. \"   The air strikes against Libya were one manifestation of this strategy.\n\nThrough most of President Reagan's second term, the coordination of counterterrorism was overseen by a high-\nlevel interagency committee chaired by the deputy national security adviser. But the Reagan administration closed \nwith a major scandal that cast a cloud over the notion that the White House should guide counterterrorism.\n\nPresident Reagan was concerned because Hezbollah was taking Americans hostage and periodically killing them. \nHe was also constrained by a bill he signed into law that made it illegal to ship military aid to anticommunist Contra \nguerrillas in Nicaragua, whom he strongly supported. His national security adviser, Robert McFarlane, and \nMcFarlane's deputy, Admiral John Poindexter, thought the hostage problem might be solved and the U. S. position \nin the Middle East improved if the United States quietly negotiated with Iran about exchanging hostages for modest \nquantities of arms. Shultz and Weinberger, united for once, opposed McFarlane and Poindexter.\n\nA staffer for McFarlane and Poindexter, Marine Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, developed a scheme to trade U. S. \narms for hostages and divert the proceeds to the Contras to get around U. S. law. He may have had \nencouragement from Director of Central Intelligence William Casey.  \n\nWhen the facts were revealed in 1986 and 1987, it appeared to be the 1970s all over again: a massive abuse of \ncovert action. Now, instead of stories about poisoned cigars and Mafia hit men, Americans heard testimony about a \nsecret visit to Tehran by McFarlane, using an assumed name and bearing a chocolate cake decorated with icing \ndepicting a key. An investigation by a special counsel resulted in the indictment of McFarlane, Poindexter, North, \nand ten others, including several high-ranking officers from the CIA's Clandestine Service. The investigations \nspotlighted the importance of accountability and official responsibility for faithful execution of laws. For the story of \n9/11, the significance of the Iran-Contra affair was that it made parts of the bureaucracy reflexively skeptical about \nany operating directive from the White House.  \n\nAs the national security advisor's function expanded, the procedures and structure of the advisor's staff, \nconventionally called the National Security Council staff, became more formal. The advisor developed \nrecommendations for presidential directives, differently labeled by each president. For President Clinton, they were \nto be Presidential Decision Directives; for President George W. Bush, National Security Policy Directives. These \ndocuments and many oth-\n\ners requiring approval by the president worked their way through interagency committees usually composed of \ndepartmental representatives at the assistant secretary level or just below it. The NSC staff had senior directors \nwho would sit on these interagency committees, often as chair, to facilitate agreement and to represent the wider \ninterests of the national security advisor.\n\nWhen President Clinton took office, he decided right away to coordinate counterterrorism from the White House. On \nJanuary 25, 1993, Mir Amal Kansi, an Islamic extremist from Pakistan, shot and killed two CIA employees at the \nmain highway entrance to CIA headquarters in Virginia. (Kansi drove away and was captured abroad much later. ) \nOnly a month afterward came the World Trade Center bombing and, a few weeks after that, the Iraqi plot against \nformer President Bush.\n\n\n\nPresident Clinton's first national security advisor, Anthony Lake, had retained from the Bush administration the \nstaffer who dealt with crime, narcotics, and terrorism (a portfolio often known as \"drugs and thugs\"), the veteran civil \nservant Richard Clarke. President Clinton and Lake turned to Clarke to do the staff work for them in coordinating \ncounterterrorism. Before long, he would chair a midlevel interagency committee eventually titled the \nCounterterrorism Security Group (CSG). We will later tell of Clarke's evolution as adviser on and, in time, manager \nof the U. S. counterterrorist effort.\n\nWhen explaining the missile strike against Iraq provoked by the plot to kill President Bush, President Clinton \nstated:\"From the first days of our Revolution, America's security has depended on the clarity of the message:Don't \ntread on us. A firm and commensurate response was essential to protect our sovereignty, to send a message to \nthose who engage in state-sponsored terrorism, to deter further violence against our people, and to affirm the \nexpectation of civilized behavior among nations. \"  \n\nIn his State of the Union message in January 1995, President Clinton promised \"comprehensive legislation to \nstrengthen our hand in combating terrorists, whether they strike at home or abroad. \" In February, he sent Congress \nproposals to extend federal criminal jurisdiction, to make it easier to deport terrorists, and to act against terrorist \nfund-raising. In early May, he submitted a bundle of strong amendments. The interval had seen the news from \nTokyo in March that a doomsday cult, Aum Shinrikyo, had released sarin nerve gas in a subway, killing 12 and \ninjuring thousands. The sect had extensive properties and laboratories in Japan and offices worldwide, including \none in New York. Neither the FBI nor the CIA had ever heard of it. In April had come the bombing of the Murrah \nfederal building in Oklahoma City; immediate suspicions that it had been the work of Islamists turned out to be \nwrong, and the bombers proved to be American antigovernment extremists named Timothy McVeigh and Terry \nNichols. President Clinton proposed to amend his earlier proposals by increasing wiretap and electronic \nsurveillance authority for the FBI, requiring that explosives carry traceable taggants, and providing substantial new \nmoney not only for the FBI and CIA but also for local police.  \n\nPresident Clinton issued a classified directive in June 1995, Presidential Decision Directive 39, which said that the \nUnited States should \"deter, defeat and respond vigorously to all terrorist attacks on our territory and against our \ncitizens. \"The directive called terrorism both a matter of national security and a crime, and it assigned \nresponsibilities to various agencies. Alarmed by the incident in Tokyo, President Clinton made it the very highest \npriority for his own staff and for all agencies to prepare to detect and respond to terrorism that involved chemical, \nbiological, or nuclear weapons.  \n\nDuring 1995 and 1996, President Clinton devoted considerable time to seeking cooperation from other nations in \ndenying sanctuary to terrorists. He proposed significantly larger budgets for the FBI, with much of the increase \ndesignated for counterterrorism. For the CIA, he essentially stopped cutting allocations and supported requests for \nsupplemental funds for counterterrorism.  \n\nWhen announcing his new national security team after being reelected in 1996, President Clinton mentioned \nterrorism first in a list of several challenges facing the country.   In 1998, after Bin Ladin's fatwa and other alarms, \nPresident Clinton accepted a proposal from his national security advisor, Samuel \"Sandy\" Berger, and gave Clarke \na new position as national coordinator for security, infrastructure protection, and counterterrorism. He issued two \nPresidential Decision Directives, numbers 62 and 63, that built on the assignments to agencies that had been made \nin Presidential Decision Directive 39; laid out ten program areas for counterterrorism; and enhanced, at least on \npaper, Clarke's authority to police these assignments. Because of concerns especially on the part of Attorney \nGeneral Reno, this new authority was defined in precise and limiting language. Clarke was only to \"provide advice\" \nregarding budgets and to \"coordinate the development of interagency agreed guidelines\" for action.  \n\nClarke also was awarded a seat on the cabinet-level Principals Committee when it met on his issues - a highly \nunusual step for a White House staffer. His interagency body, the CSG, ordinarily reported to the Deputies \nCommittee of subcabinet officials, unless Berger asked them to report directly to the principals. The complementary \ndirective, number 63, defined the elements of the nation's critical infrastructure and considered ways to protect it. \nTaken together, the two directives basically left the Justice Department and the FBI in charge at home and left \nterrorism abroad to the CIA, the State Department, and other agencies, under Clarke's and Berger's coordinating \nhands.\n\n\n\nExplaining the new arrangement and his concerns in another commencement speech, this time at the Naval \nAcademy, in May 1998, the President said:\n\n        First, we will use our new integrated approach to intensify the\n\n        fight against all forms of terrorism: to capture terrorists, no\n\n        matter where they hide; to work with other nations to eliminate\n\n        terrorist sanctuaries overseas; to respond rapidly and effectively\n\n        to protect Americans from terrorism at\n\n        home and abroad. Second, we will launch a comprehensive plan to\n\n        detect, deter, and defend against attacks on our critical\n\n        infrastructures, our power systems, water supplies, police, fire,\n\n        and medical services, air traffic control, financial services,\n\n        telephone systems, and computer networks. . . . Third, we will\n\n        undertake a concerted effort to prevent the spread and use of\n\n        biological weapons and to protect our people in the event these\n\n        terrible weapons are ever unleashed by a rogue state, a terrorist\n\n        group, or an international criminal organization. . . . Finally, we\n\n        must do more to protect our civilian population from biological\n\n        weapons. \n\n        \n\nClearly, the President's concern about terrorism had steadily risen. That heightened worry would become even \nmore obvious early in 1999, when he addressed the National Academy of Sciences and presented his most somber \naccount yet of what could happen if the United States were hit, unprepared, by terrorists wielding either weapons of \nmass destruction or potent cyberweapons.\n\n3. 7 . . . AND IN THE CONGRESS \n\nSince the beginning of the Republic, few debates have been as hotly contested as the one over executive versus \nlegislative powers. At the Constitutional Convention, the founders sought to create a strong executive but check its \npowers. They left those powers sufficiently ambiguous so that room was left for Congress and the president to \nstruggle over the direction of the nation's security and foreign policies.\n\nThe most serious question has centered on whether or not the president needs congressional authorization to wage \nwar. The current status of that debate seems to have settled into a recognition that a president can deploy military \nforces for small and limited operations, but needs at least congressional support if not explicit authorization for large \nand more open-ended military operations.\n\nThis calculus becomes important in this story as both President Clinton and President Bush chose not to seek a \ndeclaration of war on Bin Ladin after he had declared and begun to wage war on us, a declaration that they did not \nacknowledge publicly. Not until after 9/11 was a congressional authorization sought.\n\nThe most substantial change in national security oversight in Congress took place following World War II. The \nCongressional Reorganization Act of 1946 created the modern Armed Services committees that have become so \npowerful today. One especially noteworthy innovation was the creation of the Joint House-Senate Atomic Energy \nCommittee, which is credited by many with the development of our nuclear deterrent capability and was also \ncriticized for wielding too much power relative to the executive branch.\n\n\n\nIronically, this committee was eliminated in the 1970s as Congress was undertaking the next most important reform \nof oversight in response to the Church and Pike investigations into abuses of power. In 1977, the House and \nSenate created select committees to exercise oversight of the executive branch's conduct of intelligence \noperations.\n\nThe Intelligence Committees \n\nThe House and Senate select committees on intelligence share some important characteristics. They have limited \nauthorities. They do not have exclusive authority over intelligence agencies. Appropriations are ultimately \ndetermined by the Appropriations committees. The Armed Services committees exercise jurisdiction over the \nintelligence agencies within the Department of Defense (and, in the case of the Senate, over the Central \nIntelligence Agency). One consequence is that the rise and fall of intelligence budgets are tied directly to trends in \ndefense spending.\n\nThe president is required by law to ensure the congressional Intelligence committees are kept fully and currently \ninformed of the intelligence activities of the United States. The committees allow the CIA to some extent to withhold \ninformation in order to protect sources, methods, and operations. The CIA must bring presidentially authorized \ncovert action Findings and Memoranda of Notification to the Intelligence committees, and it must detail its failures. \nThe committees conduct their most important work in closed hearings or briefings in which security over classified \nmaterial can be maintained.\n\nMembers of the Intelligence committees serve for a limited time, a restriction imposed by each chamber. Many \nmembers believe these limits prevent committee members from developing the necessary expertise to conduct \neffective oversight.\n\nSecrecy, while necessary, can also harm oversight. The overall budget of the intelligence community is classified, \nas are most of its activities. Thus, the Intelligence committees cannot take advantage of democracy's best oversight \nmechanism: public disclosure. This makes them significantly different from other congressional oversight \ncommittees, which are often spurred into action by the work of investigative journalists and watchdog organizations.\n\nAdjusting to the Post-Cold War Era \n\nThe unexpected and rapid end of the Cold War in 1991 created trauma in the foreign policy and national security \ncommunity both in and out of government. While some criticized the intelligence community for failing to forecast \nthe collapse of the Soviet Union (and used this argument to propose drastic cuts in intelligence agencies), most \nrecognized that the good news of being relieved of the substantial burden of maintaining a security structure to \nmeet the Soviet challenge was accompanied by the bad news of increased insecurity. In many directions, the \ncommunity faced threats and intelligence challenges that it was largely unprepared to meet.\n\nSo did the intelligence oversight committees. New digitized technologies, and the demand for imagery and \ncontinued capability against older systems, meant the need to spend more on satellite systems at the expense of \nhuman efforts. In addition, denial and deception became more effective as targets learned from public sources what \nour intelligence agencies were doing. There were comprehensive reform proposals of the intelligence community, \nsuch as those offered by Senators Boren and McCurdy. That said, Congress still took too little action to address \ninstitutional weaknesses.  \n\nWith the Cold War over, and the intelligence community roiled by the Ames spy scandal, a presidential commission \nchaired first by former secretary of defense Les Aspin and later by former secretary of defense Harold Brown \nexamined the intelligence community's future. After it issued recommendations addressing the DCI's lack of \npersonnel and budget authority over the intelligence community, the Intelligence committees in 1996 introduced \nimplementing legislation to remedy these problems.\n\nThe Department of Defense and its congressional authorizing committees rose in opposition to the proposed \nchanges. The President and DCI did not actively support these changes. Relatively small changes made in 1996 \ngave the DCI consultative authority and created a new deputy for management and assistant DCIs for collection \n\n\n\nand analysis. These reforms occurred only after the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence took the \nunprecedented step of threatening to bring down the defense authorization bill. Indeed, rather than increasing the \nDCI's authorities over national intelligence, the 1990s witnessed movement in the opposite direction through, for \nexample, the transfer of the CIA's imaging analysis capability to the new imagery and mapping agency created \nwithin the Department of Defense.\n\nCongress Adjusts \n\nCongress as a whole, like the executive branch, adjusted slowly to the rise of transnational terrorism as a threat to \nnational security. In particular, the growing threat and capabilities of Bin Ladin were not understood in Congress. As \nthe most representative branch of the federal government, Congress closely tracks trends in what public opinion \nand the electorate identify as key issues. In the years before September 11, terrorism seldom registered as \nimportant. To the extent that terrorism did break through and engage the attention of the Congress as a whole, it \nwould briefly command attention after a specific incident, and then return to a lower rung on the public policy \nagenda.\n\nSeveral points about Congress are worth noting. First, Congress always has a strong orientation toward domestic \naffairs. It usually takes on foreign policy and national security issues after threats are identified and articulated by \nthe administration. In the absence of such a detailed - and repeated - articulation, national security tends not to rise \nvery high on the list of congressional priorities. Presidents are selective in their use of political capital for \ninternational issues.\n\nIn the decade before 9/11, presidential discussion of and congressional and public attention to foreign affairs and \nnational security were dominated by other issues - among them, Haiti, Bosnia, Russia, China, Somalia, Kosovo, \nNATO enlargement, the Middle East peace process, missile defense, and globalization. Terrorism infrequently took \ncenter stage; and when it did, the context was often terrorists' tactics - a chemical, biological, nuclear, or computer \nthreat - not terrorist organizations.  \n\nSecond, Congress tends to follow the overall lead of the president on budget issues with respect to national security \nmatters. There are often sharp arguments about individual programs and internal priorities, but by and large the \noverall funding authorized and appropriated by the Congress comes out close to the president's request. This \ntendency was certainly illustrated by the downward trends in spending on defense, intelligence, and foreign affairs \nin the first part of the 1990s. The White House, to be sure, read the political signals coming from Capitol Hill, but the \nCongress largely acceded to the executive branch's funding requests. In the second half of the decade, Congress \nappropriated some 98 percent of what the administration requested for intelligence programs. Apart from the \nGingrich supplemental of $1. 5 billion for overall intelligence programs in fiscal year 1999, the key decisions on \noverall allocation of resources for national security issues in the decade before 9/11 - including counterterrorism \nfunding - were made in the president's Office of Management and Budget.  \n\nThird, Congress did not reorganize itself after the end of the Cold War to address new threats. Recommendations \nby the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress were implemented, in part, in the House of \nRepresentatives after the 1994 elections, but there was no reorganization of national security functions. The Senate \nundertook no appreciable changes. Traditional issues - foreign policy, defense, intelligence - continued to be \nhandled by committees whose structure remained largely unaltered, while issues such as transnational terrorism fell \nbetween the cracks. Terrorism came under the jurisdiction of at least 14 different committees in the House alone, \nand budget and oversight functions in the House and Senate concerning terrorism were also splintered badly \namong committees. Little effort was made to consider an integrated policy toward terrorism, which might range from \nidentifying the threat to addressing vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure; and the piecemeal approach in the \nCongress contributed to the problems of the executive branch in formulating such a policy.  \n\nFourth, the oversight function of Congress has diminished over time. In recent years, traditional review of the \nadministration of programs and the implementation of laws has been replaced by \"a focus on personal \ninvestigations, possible scandals, and issues designed to generate media attention. \"The unglamorous but \nessential work of oversight has been neglected, and few members past or present believe it is performed well. DCI \nTenet told us:\"We ran\n\n\n\nfrom threat to threat to threat. . . . [T]here was not a system in place to say, 'You got to go back and do this and this \nand this. '\" Not just the DCI but the entire executive branch needed help from Congress in addressing the questions \nof counterterrorism strategy and policy, looking past day-to-day concerns. Members of Congress, however, also \nfound their time spent on such everyday matters, or in looking back to investigate mistakes, and often missed the \nbig questions - as did the executive branch. Staff tended as well to focus on parochial considerations, seeking to \nadd or cut funding for individual (often small) programs, instead of emphasizing comprehensive oversight projects.  \n\nFifth, on certain issues, other priorities pointed Congress in a direction that was unhelpful in meeting the threats that \nwere emerging in the months leading up to 9/11. Committees with oversight responsibility for aviation focused \noverwhelmingly on airport congestion and the economic health of the airlines, not aviation security. Committees \nwith responsibility for the INS focused on the Southwest border, not on terrorists. Justice Department officials told \nus that committees with responsibility for the FBI tightly restricted appropriations for improvements in information \ntechnology, in part because of concerns about the FBI's ability to manage such projects. Committees responsible \nfor South Asia spent the decade of the 1990s imposing sanctions on Pakistan, leaving presidents with little leverage \nto alter Pakistan's policies before 9/11. Committees with responsibility for the Defense Department paid little heed \nto developing military responses to terrorism and stymied intelligence reform. All committees found themselves \nswamped in the minutiae of the budget process, with little time for consideration of longer-term questions, or what \nmany members past and present told us was the proper conduct of oversight.  \n\nEach of these trends contributed to what can only be described as Congress's slowness and inadequacy in treating \nthe issue of terrorism in the years before 9/11. The legislative branch adjusted little and did not restructure itself to \naddress changing threats.   Its attention to terrorism was episodic and splintered across several committees. \nCongress gave little guidance to executive branch agencies, did not reform them in any significant way, and did not \nsystematically perform oversight to identify, address, and attempt to resolve the many problems in national security \nand domestic agencies that became apparent in the aftermath of 9/11.\n\nAlthough individual representatives and senators took significant steps, the overall level of attention in the Congress \nto the terrorist threat was low. We examined the number of hearings on terrorism from January 1998 to September \n2001. The Senate Armed Services Committee held nine - four related to the attack on the USS Cole. The House \nArmed Services Committee also held nine, six of them by a special oversight panel on terrorism. The Senate \nForeign Relations Committee and its House counterpart both held four. The Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, in addition to its annual worldwide threat hearing, held eight; its House counterpart held perhaps two \nexclusively\n\ndevoted to counterterrorism, plus the briefings by its terrorist working group. The Senate and House intelligence \npanels did not raise public and congressional attention on Bin Ladin and al Qaeda prior to the joint inquiry into the \nattacks of September 11, perhaps in part because of the classified nature of their work. Yet in the context of \ncommittees that each hold scores of hearings every year on issues in their jurisdiction, this list is not impressive. \nTerrorism was a second- or third-order priority within the committees of Congress responsible for national security.  \n\nIn fact, Congress had a distinct tendency to push questions of emerging national security threats off its own plate, \nleaving them for others to consider. Congress asked outside commissions to do the work that arguably was at the \nheart of its own oversight responsibilities.   Beginning in 1999, the reports of these commissions made scores of \nrecommendations to address terrorism and homeland security but drew little attention from Congress. Most of their \nimpact came after 9/11.\n\n4 RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA'S INITIAL ASSAULTS \n\n4. 1 BEFORE THE BOMBINGS IN KENYA AND TANZANIA \n\nAlthough the 1995 National Intelligence Estimate had warned of a new type of terrorism, many officials continued to \nthink of terrorists as agents of states (Saudi Hezbollah acting for Iran against Khobar Towers) or as domestic \ncriminals (Timothy McVeigh in Oklahoma City). As we pointed out in chapter 3, the White House is not a natural \n\n\n\nlocus for program management. Hence, government efforts to cope with terrorism were essentially the work of \nindividual agencies.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton's counterterrorism Presidential Decision Directives in 1995 (no. 39) and May 1998 (no. 62) \nreiterated that terrorism was a national security problem, not just a law enforcement issue. They reinforced the \nauthority of the National Security Council (NSC) to coordinate domestic as well as foreign counterterrorism efforts, \nthrough Richard Clarke and his interagency Counterterrorism Security Group (CSG). Spotlighting new concerns \nabout unconventional attacks, these directives assigned tasks to lead agencies but did not differentiate types of \nterrorist threats. Thus, while Clarke might prod or push agencies to act, what actually happened was usually \ndecided at the State Department, the Pentagon, the CIA, or the Justice Department. The efforts of these agencies \nwere sometimes energetic and sometimes effective. Terrorist plots were disrupted and individual terrorists were \ncaptured. But the United States did not, before 9/11, adopt as a clear strategic objective the elimination of al Qaeda.\n\nEarly Efforts against Bin Ladin \n\nUntil 1996, hardly anyone in the U. S. government understood that Usama Bin Ladin was an inspirer and organizer \nof the new terrorism. In 1993, the CIA noted that he had paid for the training of some Egyptian terrorists in Sudan. \nThe State Department detected his money in aid to the Yemeni terrorists who\n\nset a bomb in an attempt to kill U. S. troops in Aden in 1992. State Department sources even saw suspicious links \nwith Omar Abdel Rahman, the \"Blind Sheikh\" in the New York area, commenting that Bin Ladin seemed \"committed \nto financing 'Jihads' against 'anti Islamic' regimes worldwide. \" After the department designated Sudan a state \nsponsor of terrorism in 1993, it put Bin Ladin on its TIPOFF watchlist, a move that might have prevented his getting \na visa had he tried to enter the United States. As late as 1997, however, even the CIA's Counterterrorist Center \ncontinued to describe him as an \"extremist financier. \"  \n\nIn 1996, the CIA set up a special unit of a dozen officers to analyze intelligence on and plan operations against Bin \nLadin. David Cohen, the head of the CIA's Directorate of Operations, wanted to test the idea of having a \"virtual \nstation\" - a station based at headquarters but collecting and operating against a subject much as stations in the field \nfocus on a country. Taking his cue from National Security Advisor Anthony Lake, who expressed special interest in \nterrorist finance, Cohen formed his virtual station as a terrorist financial links unit. He had trouble getting any \nDirectorate of Operations officer to run it; he finally recruited a former analyst who was then running the Islamic \nExtremist Branch of the Counterterrorist Center. This officer, who was especially knowledgeable about Afghanistan, \nhad noticed a recent stream of reports about Bin Ladin and something called al Qaeda, and suggested to Cohen \nthat the station focus on this one individual. Cohen agreed. Thus was born the Bin Ladin unit.  \n\nIn May 1996, Bin Ladin left Sudan for Afghanistan. A few months later, as the Bin Ladin unit was gearing up, Jamal \nAhmed al Fadl walked into a U. S. embassy in Africa, established his bona fides as a former senior employee of Bin \nLadin, and provided a major breakthrough of intelligence on the creation, character, direction, and intentions of al \nQaeda. Corroborating evidence came from another walk-in source at a different U. S. embassy. More confirmation \nwas supplied later that year by intelligence and other sources, including material gathered by FBI agents and \nKenyan police from an al Qaeda cell in Nairobi.  \n\nBy 1997, officers in the Bin Ladin unit recognized that Bin Ladin was more than just a financier. They learned that al \nQaeda had a military committee that was planning operations against U. S. interests worldwide and was actively \ntrying to obtain nuclear material. Analysts assigned to the station looked at the information it had gathered and \n\"found connections everywhere, \" including links to the attacks on U. S. troops in Aden and Somalia in 1992 and \n1993 and to the Manila air plot in the Philippines in 1994-1995.  \n\nThe Bin Ladin station was already working on plans for offensive operations against Bin Ladin. These plans were \ndirected at both physical assets and sources of finance. In the end, plans to identify and attack Bin Ladin's money \nsources did not go forward.  \n\nIn late 1995, when Bin Ladin was still in Sudan, the State Department and the CIA learned that Sudanese officials \nwere discussing with the Saudi gov-\n\n\n\nernment the possibility of expelling Bin Ladin. U. S. Ambassador Timothy Carney encouraged the Sudanese to \npursue this course. The Saudis, however, did not want Bin Ladin, giving as their reason their revocation of his \ncitizenship.  \n\nSudan's minister of defense, Fatih Erwa, has claimed that Sudan offered to hand Bin Ladin over to the United \nStates. The Commission has found no credible evidence that this was so. Ambassador Carney had instructions \nonly to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Ladin. Ambassador Carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the \nSudanese since, at the time, there was no indictment outstanding.  \n\nThe chief of the Bin Ladin station, whom we will call \"Mike, \" saw Bin Ladin's move to Afghanistan as a stroke of \nluck. Though the CIA had virtually abandoned Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal, case officers had \nreestablished old contacts while tracking down Mir Amal Kansi, the Pakistani gunman who had murdered two CIA \nemployees in January 1993. These contacts contributed to intelligence about Bin Ladin's local movements, \nbusiness activities, and security and living arrangements, and helped provide evidence that he was spending large \namounts of money to help the Taliban. The chief of the Counterterrorist Center, whom we will call \"Jeff, \" told \nDirector George Tenet that the CIA's intelligence assets were \"near to providing real-time information about Bin \nLadin's activities and travels in Afghanistan. \" One of the contacts was a group associated with particular tribes \namong Afghanistan's ethnic Pashtun community.  \n\nBy the fall of 1997, the Bin Ladin unit had roughed out a plan for these Afghan tribals to capture Bin Ladin and hand \nhim over for trial either in the United States or in an Arab country. In early 1998, the cabinet-level Principals \nCommittee apparently gave the concept its blessing.  \n\nOn their own separate track, getting information but not direction from the CIA, the FBI's New York Field Office and \nthe U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York were preparing to ask a grand jury to indict Bin Ladin. The \nCounterterrorist Center knew that this was happening.   The eventual charge, conspiring to attack U. S. defense \ninstallations, was finally issued from the grand jury in June 1998 - as a sealed indictment. The indictment was \npublicly disclosed in November of that year.\n\nWhen Bin Ladin moved to Afghanistan in May 1996, he became a subject of interest to the State Department's \nSouth Asia bureau. At the time, as one diplomat told us, South Asia was seen in the department and the \ngovernment generally as a low priority. In 1997, as Madeleine Albright was beginning her tenure as secretary of \nstate, an NSC policy review concluded that the United States should pay more attention not just to India but also to \nPakistan and Afghanistan.   With regard to Afghanistan, another diplomat said, the United States at the time had \n\"no policy. \"  \n\nIn the State Department, concerns about India-Pakistan tensions often crowded out attention to Afghanistan or Bin \nLadin. Aware of instability and\n\ngrowing Islamic extremism in Pakistan, State Department officials worried most about an arms race and possible \nwar between Pakistan and India. After May 1998, when both countries surprised the United States by testing \nnuclear weapons, these dangers became daily first-order concerns of the State Department.  \n\nIn Afghanistan, the State Department tried to end the civil war that had continued since the Soviets' withdrawal. The \nSouth Asia bureau believed it might have a carrot for Afghanistan's warring factions in a project by the Union Oil \nCompany of California (UNOCAL) to build a pipeline across the country. While there was probably never much \nchance of the pipeline actually being built, the Afghan desk hoped that the prospect of shared pipeline profits might \nlure faction leaders to a conference table. U. S. diplomats did not favor the Taliban over the rival factions. Despite \ngrowing concerns, U. S. diplomats were willing at the time, as one official said, to \"give the Taliban a chance. \"  \n\nThough Secretary Albright made no secret of thinking the Taliban \"despicable, \" the U. S. ambassador to the United \nNations, Bill Richardson, led a delegation to South Asia - including Afghanistan - in April 1998. No U. S. official of \nsuch rank had been to Kabul in decades. Ambassador Richardson went primarily to urge negotiations to end the \ncivil war. In view of Bin Ladin's recent public call for all Muslims to kill Americans, Richardson asked the Taliban to \nexpel Bin Ladin. They answered that they did not know his whereabouts. In any case, the Taliban said, Bin Ladin \nwas not a threat to the United States.  \n\n\n\nIn sum, in late 1997 and the spring of 1998, the lead U. S. agencies each pursued their own efforts against Bin \nLadin. The CIA's Counterterrorist Center was developing a plan to capture and remove him from Afghanistan. Parts \nof the Justice Department were moving toward indicting Bin Ladin, making possible a criminal trial in a New York \ncourt. Meanwhile, the State Department was focused more on lessening Indo-Pakistani nuclear tensions, ending \nthe Afghan civil war, and ameliorating the Taliban's human rights abuses than on driving out Bin Ladin. Another key \nactor, Marine General Anthony Zinni, the commander in chief of the U. S. Central Command, shared the State \nDepartment's view.  \n\nThe CIA Develops a Capture Plan \n\nInitially, the DCI's Counterterrorist Center and its Bin Ladin unit considered a plan to ambush Bin Ladin when he \ntraveled between Kandahar, the Taliban capital where he sometimes stayed the night, and his primary residence at \nthe time, Tarnak Farms. After the Afghan tribals reported that they had tried such an ambush and failed, the Center \ngave up on it, despite suspicions that the tribals' story might be fiction. Thereafter, the capture plan focused on a \nnighttime raid on Tarnak Farms.  \n\nA compound of about 80 concrete or mud-brick buildings surrounded by a 10-foot wall, Tarnak Farms was located \nin an isolated desert area on the outskirts of the Kandahar airport. CIA officers were able to map the entire site, \nidentifying the houses that belonged to Bin Ladin's wives and the one where\n\nBin Ladin himself was most likely to sleep. Working with the tribals, they drew up plans for the raid. They ran two \ncomplete rehearsals in the United States during the fall of 1997.  \n\nBy early 1998, planners at the Counterterrorist Center were ready to come back to the White House to seek formal \napproval. Tenet apparently walked National Security Advisor Sandy Berger through the basic plan on February 13. \nOne group of tribals would subdue the guards, enter Tarnak Farms stealthily, grab Bin Ladin, take him to a desert \nsite outside Kandahar, and turn him over to a second group. This second group of tribals would take him to a desert \nlanding zone already tested in the 1997 Kansi capture. From there, a CIA plane would take him to New York, an \nArab capital, or wherever he was to be arraigned. Briefing papers prepared by the Counterterrorist Center \nacknowledged that hitches might develop. People might be killed, and Bin Ladin's supporters might retaliate, \nperhaps taking U. S. citizens in Kandahar hostage. But the briefing papers also noted that there was risk in not \nacting. \"Sooner or later, \" they said, \"Bin Ladin will attack U. S. interests, perhaps using WMD [weapons of mass \ndestruction]. \"  \n\nClarke's Counterterrorism Security Group reviewed the capture plan for Berger. Noting that the plan was in a \"very \nearly stage of development, \" the NSC staff then told the CIA planners to go ahead and, among other things, start \ndrafting any legal documents that might be required to authorize the covert action. The CSG apparently stressed \nthat the raid should target Bin Ladin himself, not the whole compound.  \n\nThe CIA planners conducted their third complete rehearsal in March, and they again briefed the CSG. Clarke wrote \nBerger on March 7 that he saw the operation as \"somewhat embryonic\" and the CIA as \"months away from doing \nanything. \"  \n\n\"Mike\" thought the capture plan was \"the perfect operation. \" It required minimum infrastructure. The plan had now \nbeen modified so that the tribals would keep Bin Ladin in a hiding place for up to a month before turning him over to \nthe United States - thereby increasing the chances of keeping the U. S. hand out of sight. \"Mike\" trusted the \ninformation from the Afghan network; it had been corroborated by other means, he told us. The lead CIA officer in \nthe field, Gary Schroen, also had confidence in the tribals. In a May 6 cable to CIA headquarters, he pronounced \ntheir planning \"almost as professional and detailed . . . as would be done by any U. S. military special operations \nelement. \" He and the other officers who had worked through the plan with the tribals judged it \"about as good as it \ncan be. \" (By that, Schroen explained, he meant that the chance of capturing or killing Bin Ladin was about 40 \npercent. ) Although the tribals thought they could pull off the raid, if the operation were approved by headquarters \nand the policymakers, Schroen wrote there was going to be a point when \"we step back and keep our fingers \ncrossed that the [tribals] prove as good (and as lucky) as they think they will be. \"  \n\n\n\nMilitary officers reviewed the capture plan and, according to \"Mike, \" \"found no showstoppers. \"The commander of \nDelta Force felt \"uncomfortable\" with having the tribals hold Bin Ladin captive for so long, and the commander of \nJoint Special Operations Forces, Lieutenant General Michael Canavan, was worried about the safety of the tribals \ninside Tarnak Farms. General Canavan said he had actually thought the operation too complicated for the CIA - \n\"out of their league\" - and an effort to get results \"on the cheap. \" But a senior Joint Staff officer described the plan \nas \"generally, not too much different than we might have come up with ourselves. \" No one in the Pentagon, so far \nas we know, advised the CIA or the White House not to proceed.  \n\nIn Washington, Berger expressed doubt about the dependability of the tribals. In his meeting with Tenet, Berger \nfocused most, however, on the question of what was to be done with Bin Ladin if he were actually captured. He \nworried that the hard evidence against Bin Ladin was still skimpy and that there was a danger of snatching him and \nbringing him to the United States only to see him acquitted.  \n\nOn May 18, CIA's managers reviewed a draft Memorandum of Notification (MON), a legal document authorizing the \ncapture operation. A 1986 presidential finding had authorized worldwide covert action against terrorism and \nprobably provided adequate authority. But mindful of the old \"rogue elephant\" charge, senior CIA managers may \nhave wanted something on paper to show that they were not acting on their own.\n\nDiscussion of this memorandum brought to the surface an unease about paramilitary covert action that had become \ningrained, at least among some CIA senior managers. James Pavitt, the assistant head of the Directorate of \nOperations, expressed concern that people might get killed; it appears he thought the operation had at least a slight \nflavor of a plan for an assassination. Moreover, he calculated that it would cost several million dollars. He was not \nprepared to take that money \"out of hide, \" and he did not want to go to all the necessary congressional committees \nto get special money. Despite Pavitt's misgivings, the CIA leadership cleared the draft memorandum and sent it on \nto the National Security Council.  \n\nCounterterrorist Center officers briefed Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh, telling them that \nthe operation had about a 30 percent chance of success. The Center's chief, \"Jeff, \" joined John O'Neill, the head of \nthe FBI's New York Field Office, in briefing Mary Jo White, the U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, \nand her staff. Though \"Jeff \" also used the 30 percent success figure, he warned that someone would surely be \nkilled in the operation. White's impression from the New York briefing was that the chances of capturing Bin Ladin \nalive were nil.  \n\nFrom May 20 to 24, the CIA ran a final, graded rehearsal of the operation, spread over three time zones, even \nbringing in personnel from the region. The FBI also participated. The rehearsal went well. The Counterterrorist \nCenter\n\nplanned to brief cabinet-level principals and their deputies the following week, giving June 23 as the date for the \nraid, with Bin Ladin to be brought out of Afghanistan no later than July 23.  \n\nOn May 20, Director Tenet discussed the high risk of the operation with Berger and his deputies, warning that \npeople might be killed, including Bin Ladin. Success was to be defined as the exfiltration of Bin Ladin out of \nAfghanistan.   A meeting of principals was scheduled for May 29 to decide whether the operation should go ahead.\n\nThe principals did not meet. On May 29, \"Jeff \" informed \"Mike\" that he had just met with Tenet, Pavitt, and the chief \nof the Directorate's Near Eastern Division. The decision was made not to go ahead with the operation. \"Mike\" \ncabled the field that he had been directed to \"stand down on the operation for the time being. \"He had been told, he \nwrote, that cabinet-level officials thought the risk of civilian casualties - \"collateral damage\" - was too high. They \nwere concerned about the tribals' safety, and had worried that \"the purpose and nature of the operation would be \nsubject to unavoidable misinterpretation and misrepresentation - and probably recriminations - in the event that Bin \nLadin, despite our best intentions and efforts, did not survive. \"  \n\nImpressions vary as to who actually decided not to proceed with the operation. Clarke told us that the CSG saw the \nplan as flawed. He was said to have described it to a colleague on the NSC staff as \"half-assed\" and predicted that \nthe principals would not approve it. \"Jeff \" thought the decision had been made at the cabinet level. Pavitt thought \nthat it was Berger's doing, though perhaps on Tenet's advice. Tenet told us that given the recommendation of his \nchief operations officers, he alone had decided to \"turn off \" the operation. He had simply informed Berger, who had \n\n\n\nnot pushed back. Berger's recollection was similar. He said the plan was never presented to the White House for a \ndecision.  \n\nThe CIA's senior management clearly did not think the plan would work. Tenet's deputy director of operations wrote \nto Berger a few weeks later that the CIA assessed the tribals' ability to capture Bin Ladin and deliver him to U. S. \nofficials as low. But working-level CIA officers were disappointed. Before it was canceled, Schroen described it as \nthe \"best plan we are going to come up with to capture [Bin Ladin] while he is in Afghanistan and bring him to \njustice. \"   No capture plan before 9/11 ever again attained the same level of detail and preparation. The tribals' \nreported readiness to act diminished. And Bin Ladin's security precautions and defenses became more elaborate \nand formidable.\n\nAt this time, 9/11 was more than three years away. It was the duty of Tenet and the CIA leadership to balance the \nrisks of inaction against jeopardizing the lives of their operatives and agents. And they had reason to worry about \nfailure: millions of dollars down the drain; a shoot-out that could be seen as an assassination; and, if there were \nrepercussions in Pakistan, perhaps a coup. The decisions of the U. S. government in May 1998 were made, as \nBerger has put\n\nit, from the vantage point of the driver looking through a muddy windshield moving forward, not through a clean \nrearview mirror.  \n\nLooking for Other Options \n\nThe Counterterrorist Center continued to track Bin Ladin and to contemplate covert action. The most hopeful \npossibility seemed now to lie in diplomacy - but not diplomacy managed by the Department of State, which focused \nprimarily on India-Pakistan nuclear tensions during the summer of 1998. The CIA learned in the spring of 1998 that \nthe Saudi government had quietly disrupted Bin Ladin cells in its country that were planning to attack U. S. forces \nwith shoulder-fired missiles. They had arrested scores of individuals, with no publicity. When thanking the Saudis, \nDirector Tenet took advantage of the opening to ask them to help against Bin Ladin. The response was \nencouraging enough that President Clinton made Tenet his informal personal representative to work with the \nSaudis on terrorism, and Tenet visited Riyadh in May and again in early June.  \n\nSaudi Crown Prince Abdullah, who had taken charge from the ailing King Fahd, promised Tenet an all-out secret \neffort to persuade the Taliban to expel Bin Ladin so that he could be sent to the United States or to another country \nfor trial. The Kingdom's emissary would be its intelligence chief, Prince Turki bin Faisal. Vice President Al Gore later \nadded his thanks to those of Tenet, both making clear that they spoke with President Clinton's blessing. Tenet \nreported that it was imperative to get an indictment against Bin Ladin. The New York grand jury issued its sealed \nindictment a few days later, on June 10. Tenet also recommended that no action be taken on other U. S. options, \nsuch as the covert action plan.  \n\nPrince Turki followed up in meetings during the summer with Mullah Omar and other Taliban leaders. Apparently \nemploying a mixture of possible incentives and threats, Turki received a commitment that Bin Ladin would be \nexpelled, but Mullah Omar did not make good on this promise.  \n\nOn August 5, Clarke chaired a CSG meeting on Bin Ladin. In the discussion of what might be done, the note taker \nwrote, \"there was a dearth of bright ideas around the table, despite a consensus that the [government] ought to \npursue every avenue it can to address the problem. \"  \n\n4. 2 CRISIS:AUGUST 1998 \n\nOn August 7, 1998, National Security Advisor Berger woke President Clinton with a phone call at 5:35 A. M. to tell \nhim of the almost simultaneous bombings of the U. S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. \nSuspicion quickly focused on Bin Ladin. Unusually good intelligence, chiefly from\n\nthe yearlong monitoring of al Qaeda's cell in Nairobi, soon firmly fixed responsibility on him and his associates.  \n\n\n\nDebate about what to do settled very soon on one option:Tomahawk cruise missiles. Months earlier, after \ncancellation of the covert capture operation, Clarke had prodded the Pentagon to explore possibilities for military \naction. On June 2, General Hugh Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had directed General Zinni at \nCentral Command to develop a plan, which he had submitted during the first week of July. Zinni's planners surely \nconsidered the two previous times the United States had used force to respond to terrorism, the 1986 strike on \nLibya and the 1993 strike against Iraq. They proposed firing Tomahawks against eight terrorist camps in \nAfghanistan, including Bin Ladin's compound at Tarnak Farms.   After the embassy attacks, the Pentagon offered \nthis plan to the White House.\n\nThe day after the embassy bombings, Tenet brought to a principals meeting intelligence that terrorist leaders were \nexpected to gather at a camp near Khowst, Afghanistan, to plan future attacks. According to Berger, Tenet said that \nseveral hundred would attend, including Bin Ladin. The CIA described the area as effectively a military cantonment, \naway from civilian population centers and overwhelmingly populated by jihadists. Clarke remembered sitting next to \nTenet in a White House meeting, asking Tenet \"You thinking what I'm thinking? \" and his nodding \"yes. \"   The \nprincipals quickly reached a consensus on attacking the gathering. The strike's purpose was to kill Bin Ladin and \nhis chief lieutenants.  \n\nBerger put in place a tightly compartmented process designed to keep all planning secret. On August 11, General \nZinni received orders to prepare detailed plans for strikes against the sites in Afghanistan. The Pentagon briefed \nPresident Clinton about these plans on August 12 and 14. Though the principals hoped that the missiles would hit \nBin Ladin, NSC staff recommended the strike whether or not there was firm evidence that the commanders were at \nthe facilities.  \n\nConsiderable debate went to the question of whether to strike targets outside of Afghanistan, including two facilities \nin Sudan. One was a tannery believed to belong to Bin Ladin. The other was al Shifa, a Khartoum pharmaceutical \nplant, which intelligence reports said was manufacturing a precursor ingredient for nerve gas with Bin Ladin's \nfinancial support. The argument for hitting the tannery was that it could hurt Bin Ladin financially. The argument for \nhitting al Shifa was that it would lessen the chance of Bin Ladin's having nerve gas for a later attack.  \n\nEver since March 1995, American officials had had in the backs of their minds Aum Shinrikyo's release of sarin \nnerve gas in the Tokyo subway. President Clinton himself had expressed great concern about chemical and \nbiological terrorism in the United States. Bin Ladin had reportedly been heard to speak of wanting a \"Hiroshima\"and \nat least 10, 000 casualties. The CIA reported\n\nthat a soil sample from the vicinity of the al Shifa plant had tested positive for EMPTA, a precursor chemical for VX, \na nerve gas whose lone use was for mass killing. Two days before the embassy bombings, Clarke's staff wrote that \nBin Ladin \"has invested in and almost certainly has access to VX produced at a plant in Sudan. \"   Senior State \nDepartment officials believed that they had received a similar verdict independently, though they and Clarke's staff \nwere probably relying on the same report. Mary McCarthy, the NSC senior director responsible for intelligence \nprograms, initially cautioned Berger that the \"bottom line\" was that \"we will need much better intelligence on this \nfacility before we seriously consider any options. \" She added that the link between Bin Ladin and al Shifa was \n\"rather uncertain at this point. \" Berger has told us that he thought about what might happen if the decision went \nagainst hitting al Shifa, and nerve gas was used in a New York subway two weeks later.  \n\nBy the early hours of the morning of August 20, President Clinton and all his principal advisers had agreed to strike \nBin Ladin camps in Afghanistan near Khowst, as well as hitting al Shifa. The President took the Sudanese tannery \noff the target list because he saw little point in killing uninvolved people without doing significant harm to Bin Ladin. \nThe principal with the most qualms regarding al Shifa was Attorney General Reno. She expressed concern about \nattacking two Muslim countries at the same time. Looking back, she said that she felt the \"premise kept shifting. \"  \n\nLater on August 20, Navy vessels in the Arabian Sea fired their cruise missiles. Though most of them hit their \nintended targets, neither Bin Ladin nor any other terrorist leader was killed. Berger told us that an after-action \nreview by Director Tenet concluded that the strikes had killed 20-30 people in the camps but probably missed Bin \nLadin by a few hours. Since the missiles headed for Afghanistan had had to cross Pakistan, the Vice Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs was sent to meet with Pakistan's army chief of staff to assure him the missiles were not coming \nfrom India. Officials in Washington speculated that one or another Pakistani official might have sent a warning to the \nTaliban or Bin Ladin.  \n\n\n\nThe air strikes marked the climax of an intense 48-hour period in which Berger notified congressional leaders, the \nprincipals called their foreign counterparts, and President Clinton flew back from his vacation on Martha's Vineyard \nto address the nation from the Oval Office. The President spoke to the congressional leadership from Air Force \nOne, and he called British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, and Egyptian \nPresident Hosni Mubarak from the White House.   House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent \nLott initially supported the President. The next month, Gingrich's office dismissed the cruise missile attacks as \n\"pinpricks. \"  \n\nAt the time, President Clinton was embroiled in the Lewinsky scandal, which continued to consume public attention \nfor the rest of that year and the first months of 1999. As it happened, a popular 1997 movie, Wag the Dog , features \na\n\npresident who fakes a war to distract public attention from a domestic scandal. Some Republicans in Congress \nraised questions about the timing of the strikes. Berger was particularly rankled by an editorial in the Economist \nthat said that only the future would tell whether the U. S. missile strikes had \"created 10, 000 new fanatics where \nthere would have been none. \"  \n\nMuch public commentary turned immediately to scalding criticism that the action was too aggressive. The \nSudanese denied that al Shifa produced nerve gas, and they allowed journalists to visit what was left of a seemingly \nharmless facility. President Clinton, Vice President Gore, Berger, Tenet, and Clarke insisted to us that their \njudgment was right, pointing to the soil sample evidence. No independent evidence has emerged to corroborate the \nCIA's assessment.  \n\nEveryone involved in the decision had, of course, been aware of President Clinton's problems. He told them to \nignore them. Berger recalled the President saying to him \"that they were going to get crap either way, so they \nshould do the right thing. \"   All his aides testified to us that they based their advice solely on national security \nconsiderations. We have found no reason to question their statements.\n\nThe failure of the strikes, the \"wag the dog\" slur, the intense partisanship of the period, and the nature of the al \nShifa evidence likely had a cumulative effect on future decisions about the use of force against Bin Ladin. Berger \ntold us that he did not feel any sense of constraint.  \n\nThe period after the August 1998 embassy bombings was critical in shaping U. S. policy toward Bin Ladin. Although \nmore Americans had been killed in the 1996 Khobar Towers attack, and many more in Beirut in 1983, the overall \nloss of life rivaled the worst attacks in memory. More ominous, perhaps, was the demonstration of an operational \ncapability to coordinate two nearly simultaneous attacks on U. S. embassies in different countries.\n\nDespite the availability of information that al Qaeda was a global network, in 1998 policymakers knew little about \nthe organization. The reams of new information that the CIA's Bin Ladin unit had been developing since 1996 had \nnot been pulled together and synthesized for the rest of the government. Indeed, analysts in the unit felt that they \nwere viewed as alarmists even within the CIA. A National Intelligence Estimate on terrorism in 1997 had only briefly \nmentioned Bin Ladin, and no subsequent national estimate would authoritatively evaluate the terrorism danger until \nafter 9/11. Policymakers knew there was a dangerous individual, Usama Bin Ladin, whom they had been trying to \ncapture and bring to trial. Documents at the time referred to Bin Ladin \"and his associates\" or Bin Ladin and his \n\"network. \"They did not emphasize the existence of a structured worldwide organization gearing up to train \nthousands of potential terrorists.  \n\nIn the critical days and weeks after the August 1998 attacks, senior policymakers in the Clinton administration had \nto reevaluate the threat posed by Bin\n\nLadin. Was this just a new and especially venomous version of the ordinary terrorist threat America had lived with \nfor decades, or was it radically new, posing a danger beyond any yet experienced?\n\nEven after the embassy attacks, Bin Ladin had been responsible for the deaths of fewer than 50 Americans, most of \nthem overseas. An NSC staffer working for Richard Clarke told us the threat was seen as one that could cause \nhundreds of casualties, not thousands.   Even officials who acknowledge a vital threat intellectually may not be \nready to act on such beliefs at great cost or at high risk.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the government experts who believed that Bin Ladin and his network posed such a novel danger needed \na way to win broad support for their views, or at least spotlight the areas of dispute. The Presidential Daily Brief and \nthe similar, more widely circulated daily reports for high officials - consisting mainly of brief reports of intelligence \n\"news\" without much analysis or context - did not provide such a vehicle. The national intelligence estimate has \noften played this role, and is sometimes controversial for this very reason. It played no role in judging the threat \nposed by al Qaeda, either in 1998 or later.\n\nIn the late summer and fall of 1998, the U. S. government also was worrying about the deployment of military power \nin two other ongoing conflicts. After years of war in the Balkans, the United States had finally committed itself to \nsignificant military intervention in 1995-1996. Already maintaining a NATO-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia, U. S. \nofficials were beginning to consider major combat operations against Serbia to protect Muslim civilians in Kosovo \nfrom ethnic cleansing. Air strikes were threatened in October 1998;a full-scale NATO bombing campaign against \nSerbia was launched in March 1999.  \n\nIn addition, the Clinton administration was facing the possibility of major combat operations against Iraq. Since \n1996, the UN inspections regime had been increasingly obstructed by Saddam Hussein. The United States was \nthreatening to attack unless unfettered inspections could resume. The Clinton administration eventually launched a \nlarge-scale set of air strikes against Iraq, Operation Desert Fox, in December 1998. These military commitments \nbecame the context in which the Clinton administration had to consider opening another front of military \nengagement against a new terrorist threat based in Afghanistan.\n\nA Follow-On Campaign? \n\nClarke hoped the August 1998 missile strikes would mark the beginning of a sustained campaign against Bin Ladin. \nClarke was, as he later admitted, \"obsessed\" with Bin Ladin, and the embassy bombings gave him new scope for \npursuing his obsession. Terrorism had moved high up among the President's concerns, and Clarke's position had \nelevated accordingly. The CSG, unlike most standing interagency committees, did not have to report through the \nDeputies Committee. Although such a reporting relationship had been prescribed in\n\nthe May 1998 presidential directive (after expressions of concern by Attorney General Reno, among others), that \ndirective contained an exception that permitted the CSG to report directly to the principals if Berger so elected. In \npractice, the CSG often reported not even to the full Principals Committee but instead to the so-called Small Group \nformed by Berger, consisting only of those principals cleared to know about the most sensitive issues connected \nwith counterterrorism activities concerning Bin Ladin or the Khobar Towers investigation.  \n\nFor this inner cabinet, Clarke drew up what he called \"Political-Military Plan Delenda. \"The Latin delenda , meaning \nthat something \"must be destroyed, \" evoked the famous Roman vow to destroy its rival, Carthage. The overall goal \nof Clarke's paper was to \"immediately eliminate any significant threat to Americans\" from the \"Bin Ladin network. \"   \nThe paper called for diplomacy to deny Bin Ladin sanctuary; covert action to disrupt terrorist activities, but above all \nto capture Bin Ladin and his deputies and bring them to trial; efforts to dry up Bin Ladin's money supply; and \npreparation for follow-on military action. The status of the document was and remained uncertain. It was never \nformally adopted by the principals, and participants in the Small Group now have little or no recollection of it. It did, \nhowever, guide Clarke's efforts.\n\nThe military component of Clarke's plan was its most fully articulated element. He envisioned an ongoing campaign \nof strikes against Bin Ladin's bases in Afghanistan or elsewhere, whenever target information was ripe. \nAcknowledging that individual targets might not have much value, he cautioned Berger not to expect ever again to \nhave an assembly of terrorist leaders in his sights. But he argued that rolling attacks might persuade the Taliban to \nhand over Bin Ladin and, in any case, would show that the action in August was not a \"oneoff \" event. It would show \nthat the United States was committed to a relentless effort to take down Bin Ladin's network.  \n\nMembers of the Small Group found themselves unpersuaded of the merits of rolling attacks. Defense Secretary \nWilliam Cohen told us Bin Ladin's training camps were primitive, built with \"rope ladders\"; General Shelton called \nthem \"jungle gym\" camps. Neither thought them worthwhile targets for very expensive missiles. President Clinton \nand Berger also worried about the Economist 's point - that attacks that missed Bin Ladin could enhance his stature \nand win him new recruits. After the United States launched air attacks against Iraq at the end of 1998 and against \n\n\n\nSerbia in 1999, in each case provoking worldwide criticism, Deputy National Security Advisor James Steinberg \nadded the argument that attacks in Afghanistan offered \"little benefit, lots of blowback against [a] bomb-happy U. S. \n\"  \n\nDuring the last week of August 1998, officials began considering possible follow-on strikes. According to Clarke, \nPresident Clinton was inclined to launch further strikes sooner rather than later. On August 27, Under Secretary of \nDefense for Policy Walter Slocombe advised Secretary Cohen that the avail-\n\nable targets were not promising. The experience of the previous week, he wrote, \"has only confirmed the \nimportance of defining a clearly articulated rationale for military action\" that was effective as well as justified. But \nSlocombe worried that simply striking some of these available targets did not add up to an effective strategy.  \n\nDefense officials at a lower level, in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Special Operations and Low-Intensity \nConflict, tried to meet Slocombe's objections. They developed a plan that, unlike Clarke's, called not for particular \nstrikes but instead for a broad change in national strategy and in the institutional approach of the Department of \nDefense, implying a possible need for large-scale operations across the whole spectrum of U. S. military \ncapabilities. It urged the department to become a lead agency in driving a national counterterrorism strategy \nforward, to \"champion a national effort to take up the gauntlet that international terrorists have thrown at our feet. \" \nThe authors expressed concern that \"we have not fundamentally altered our philosophy or our approach\" even \nthough the terrorist threat had grown. They outlined an eight-part strategy \"to be more proactive and aggressive. \" \nThe future, they warned, might bring \"horrific attacks, \" in which case \"we will have no choice nor, unfortunately, will \nwe have a plan. \"The assistant secretary, Allen Holmes, took the paper to Slocombe's chief deputy, Jan Lodal, but it \nwent no further. Its lead author recalls being told by Holmes that Lodal thought it was too aggressive. Holmes \ncannot recall what was said, and Lodal cannot remember the episode or the paper at all.  \n\n4. 3 DIPLOMACY \n\nAfter the August missile strikes, diplomatic options to press the Taliban seemed no more promising than military \noptions. The United States had issued a formal warning to the Taliban, and also to Sudan, that they would be held \ndirectly responsible for any attacks on Americans, wherever they occurred, carried out by the Bin Ladin network as \nlong as they continued to provide sanctuary to it.  \n\nFor a brief moment, it had seemed as if the August strikes might have shocked the Taliban into thinking of giving up \nBin Ladin. On August 22, the reclusive Mullah Omar told a working-level State Department official that the strikes \nwere counterproductive but added that he would be open to a dialogue with the United States on Bin Ladin's \npresence in Afghanistan.   Meeting in Islamabad with William Milam, the U. S. ambassador to Pakistan, Taliban \ndelegates said it was against their culture to expel someone seeking sanctuary but asked what would happen to Bin \nLadin should he be sent to Saudi Arabia.  \n\nYet in September 1998, when the Saudi emissary, Prince Turki, asked Mullah Omar whether he would keep his \nearlier promise to expel Bin Ladin, the\n\nTaliban leader said no. Both sides shouted at each other, with Mullah Omar denouncing the Saudi government. \nRiyadh then suspended its diplomatic relations with the Taliban regime. (Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the United \nArab Emirates were the only countries that recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. ) \nCrown Prince Abdullah told President Clinton and Vice President Gore about this when he visited Washington in \nlate September. His account confirmed reports that the U. S. government had received independently.  \n\nOther efforts with the Saudi government centered on improving intelligence sharing and permitting U. S. agents to \ninterrogate prisoners in Saudi custody. The history of such cooperation in 1997 and 1998 had been strained.   \nSeveral officials told us, in particular, that the United States could not get direct access to an important al Qaeda \nfinancial official, Madani al Tayyib, who had been detained by the Saudi government in 1997.   Though U. S. \nofficials repeatedly raised the issue, the Saudis provided limited information. In his September 1998 meeting with \nCrown Prince Abdullah, Vice President Gore, while thanking the Saudi government for their responsiveness, \nrenewed the request for direct U. S. access to Tayyib.   The United States never obtained this access.\n\n\n\nAn NSC staff-led working group on terrorist finances asked the CIA in November 1998 to push again for access to \nTayyib and to see \"if it is possible to elaborate further on the ties between Usama bin Ladin and prominent \nindividuals in Saudi Arabia, including especially the Bin Ladin family. \"   One result was two NSC-led interagency \ntrips to Persian Gulf states in 1999 and 2000. During these trips the NSC, Treasury, and intelligence \nrepresentatives spoke with Saudi officials, and later interviewed members of the Bin Ladin family, about Usama's \ninheritance. The Saudis and the Bin Ladin family eventually helped in this particular effort and U. S. officials \nultimately learned that Bin Ladin was not financing al Qaeda out of a personal inheritance.   But Clarke was \nfrustrated about how little the Agency knew, complaining to Berger that four years fafter \"we first asked CIA to track \ndown [Bin Ladin]'s finances\" and two years after the creation of the CIA's Bin Ladin unit, the Agency said it could \nonly guess at how much aid Bin Ladin gave to terrorist groups, what were the main sources of his budget, or how \nhe moved his money.  \n\nThe other diplomatic route to get at Bin Ladin in Afghanistan ran through Islamabad. In the summer before the \nembassy bombings, the State Department had been heavily focused on rising tensions between India and Pakistan \nand did not aggressively challenge Pakistan on Afghanistan and Bin Ladin. But State Department counterterrorism \nofficials wanted a stronger position; the department's acting counterterrorism coordinator advised Secretary Albright \nto designate Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism, noting that despite high-level Pakistani assurances, the \ncountry's military intelligence service continued \"activities in support of international terrorism\"by supporting attacks \non civilian targets in Kashmir. This recommendation was opposed by the State Department's South Asia bureau, \nwhich was concerned that it would damage already\n\nsensitive relations with Pakistan in the wake of the May 1998 nuclear tests by both Pakistan and India. Secretary \nAlbright rejected the recommendation on August 5, 1998, just two days before the embassy bombings.   She told us \nthat, in general, putting the Pakistanis on the terrorist list would eliminate any influence the United States had over \nthem.   In October, an NSC counterterrorism official noted that Pakistan's pro-Taliban military intelligence service \nhad been training Kashmiri jihadists in one of the camps hit by U. S. missiles, leading to the death of Pakistanis.  \n\nAfter flying to Nairobi and bringing home the coffins of the American dead, Secretary Albright increased the \ndepartment's focus on counterterrorism. According to Ambassador Milam, the bombings were a \"wake-up call, \" \nand he soon found himself spending 45 to 50 percent of his time working the Taliban -Bin Ladin portfolio.   But \nPakistan's military intelligence service, known as the ISID (Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate), was the \nTaliban's primary patron, which made progress difficult.\n\nAdditional pressure on the Pakistanis - beyond demands to press the Taliban on Bin Ladin - seemed unattractive to \nmost officials of the State Department. Congressional sanctions punishing Pakistan for possessing nuclear arms \nprevented the administration from offering incentives to Islamabad.   In the words of Deputy Secretary of State \nStrobe Talbott, Washington's Pakistan policy was \"stick-heavy. \"Talbott felt that the only remaining sticks were \nadditional sanctions that would have bankrupted the Pakistanis, a dangerous move that could have brought \"total \nchaos\" to a nuclear-armed country with a significant number of Islamic radicals.  \n\nThe Saudi government, which had a long and close relationship with Pakistan and provided it oil on generous \nterms, was already pressing Sharif with regard to the Taliban and Bin Ladin. A senior State Department official \nconcluded that Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah put \"a tremendous amount of heat\" on the Pakistani prime minister \nduring the prince's October 1998 visit to Pakistan.  \n\nThe State Department urged President Clinton to engage the Pakistanis. Accepting this advice, President Clinton \ninvited Sharif to Washington, where they talked mostly about India but also discussed Bin Ladin. After Sharif went \nhome, the President called him and raised the Bin Ladin subject again. This effort elicited from Sharif a promise to \ntalk with the Taliban.  \n\nMullah Omar's position showed no sign of softening. One intelligence report passed to Berger by the NSC staff \nquoted Bin Ladin as saying that Mullah Omar had given him a completely free hand to act in any country, though \nasking that he not claim responsibility for attacks in Pakistan or Saudi Arabia. Bin Ladin was described as grabbing \nhis beard and saying emotionally, \"By Allah, by God, the Americans will still be amazed. The so-called United \nStates will suffer the same fate as the Russians. Their state will collapse, too. \"  \n\n\n\nDebate in the State Department intensified after December 1998, when Michael Sheehan became counterterrorism \ncoordinator. A onetime special\n\nforces officer, he had worked with Albright when she was ambassador to the United Nations and had served on the \nNSC staff with Clarke. He shared Clarke's obsession with terrorism, and had little hesitation about locking horns \nwith the regional bureaus. Through every available channel, he repeated the earlier warning to the Taliban of the \npossible dire consequences - including military strikes - if Bin Ladin remained their guest and conducted additional \nattacks. Within the department, he argued for designating the Taliban regime a state sponsor of terrorism. This was \ntechnically difficult to do, for calling it a state would be tantamount to diplomatic recognition, which the United States \nhad thus far withheld. But Sheehan urged the use of any available weapon against the Taliban. He told us that he \nthought he was regarded in the department as \"a one-note Johnny nutcase. \"  \n\nIn early 1999, the State Department's counterterrorism office proposed a comprehensive diplomatic strategy for all \nstates involved in the Afghanistan problem, including Pakistan. It specified both carrots and hard-hitting sticks - \namong them, certifying Pakistan as uncooperative on terrorism. Albright said the original carrots and sticks listed in \na decision paper for principals may not have been used as \"described on paper\" but added that they were used in \nother ways or in varying degrees. But the paper's author, Ambassador Sheehan, was frustrated and complained to \nus that the original plan \"had been watered down to the point that nothing was then done with it. \"  \n\nThe cautiousness of the South Asia bureau was reinforced when, in May 1999, Pakistani troops were discovered to \nhave infiltrated into an especially mountainous area of Kashmir. A limited war began between India and Pakistan, \neuphemistically called the \"Kargil crisis, \" as India tried to drive the Pakistani forces out. Patience with Pakistan was \nwearing thin, inside both the State Department and the NSC. Bruce Riedel, the NSC staff member responsible for \nPakistan, wrote Berger that Islamabad was \"behaving as a rogue state in two areas - backing Taliban/UBL terror \nand provoking war with India. \"  \n\nDiscussion within the Clinton administration on Afghanistan then concentrated on two main alternatives. The first, \nchampioned by Riedel and Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth, was to undertake a major diplomatic effort \nto end the Afghan civil war and install a national unity government. The second, favored by Sheehan, Clarke, and \nthe CIA, called for labeling the Taliban a terrorist group and ultimately funneling secret aid to its chief foe, the \nNorthern Alliance. This dispute would go back and forth throughout 1999 and ultimately become entangled with \ndebate about enlisting the Northern Alliance as an ally for covert action.  \n\nAnother diplomatic option may have been available:nurturing Afghan exile groups as a possible moderate \ngoverning alternative to the Taliban. In late 1999, Washington provided some support for talks among the leaders of \nexile Afghan groups, including the ousted Rome-based King Zahir Shah and Hamid Karzai, about bolstering anti-\nTaliban forces inside Afghanistan and linking the\n\nNorthern Alliance with Pashtun groups. One U. S. diplomat later told us that the exile groups were not ready to \nmove forward and that coordinating fractious groups residing in Bonn, Rome, and Cyprus proved extremely difficult.  \n\nFrustrated by the Taliban's resistance, two senior State Department officials suggested asking the Saudis to offer \nthe Taliban $250 million for Bin Ladin. Clarke opposed having the United States facilitate a \"huge grant to a regime \nas heinous as the Taliban\" and suggested that the idea might not seem attractive to either Secretary Albright or \nFirst Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton - both critics of the Taliban's record on women's rights.   The proposal seems to \nhave quietly died.\n\nWithin the State Department, some officials delayed Sheehan and Clarke's push either to designate Taliban-\ncontrolled Afghanistan as a state sponsor of terrorism or to designate the regime as a foreign terrorist organization \n(thereby avoiding the issue of whether to recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan's government). Sheehan and Clarke \nprevailed in July 1999, when President Clinton issued an executive order effectively declaring the Taliban regime a \nstate sponsor of terrorism.   In October, a UN Security Council Resolution championed by the United States added \neconomic and travel sanctions.  \n\nWith UN sanctions set to come into effect in November, Clarke wrote Berger that \"the Taliban appear to be up to \nsomething. \"   Mullah Omar had shuffled his \"cabinet\" and hinted at Bin Ladin's possible departure. Clarke's staff \nthought his most likely destination would be Somalia; Chechnya seemed less appealing with Russia on the \noffensive. Clarke commented that Iraq and Libya had previously discussed hosting Bin Ladin, though he and his \n\n\n\nstaff had their doubts that Bin Ladin would trust secular Arab dictators such as Saddam Hussein or Muammar \nQadhafi. Clarke also raised the \"remote possibility\" of Yemen, which offered vast uncontrolled spaces. In \nNovember, the CSG discussed whether the sanctions had rattled the Taliban, who seemed \"to be looking for a \nface-saving way out of the Bin Ladin issue. \"  \n\nIn fact none of the outside pressure had any visible effect on Mullah Omar, who was unconcerned about commerce \nwith the outside world. Omar had virtually no diplomatic contact with the West, since he refused to meet with non- \nMuslims. The United States learned that at the end of 1999, the Taliban Council of Ministers unanimously \nreaffirmed that their regime would stick by Bin Ladin. Relations between Bin Ladin and the Taliban leadership were \nsometimes tense, but the foundation was deep and personal.   Indeed, Mullah Omar had executed at least one \nsubordinate who opposed his pro-Bin Ladin policy.  \n\nThe United States would try tougher sanctions in 2000. Working with Russia (a country involved in an ongoing \ncampaign against Chechen separatists, some of whom received support from Bin Ladin), the United States \npersuaded the United Nations to adopt Security Council Resolution 1333, which included an embargo on arms \nshipments to the Taliban, in December 2000.   The aim of the resolution was to hit the Taliban where it was most \nsensitive -\n\non the battlefield against the Northern Alliance - and criminalize giving them arms and providing military \"advisers, \" \nwhich Pakistan had been doing.   Yet the passage of the resolution had no visible effect on Omar, nor did it halt the \nflow of Pakistani military assistance to the Taliban.  \n\nU. S. authorities had continued to try to get cooperation from Pakistan in pressing the Taliban to stop sheltering Bin \nLadin. President Clinton contacted Sharif again in June 1999, partly to discuss the crisis with India but also to urge \nSharif, \"in the strongest way I can, \" to persuade the Taliban to expel Bin Ladin.   The President suggested that \nPakistan use its control over oil supplies to the Taliban and over Afghan imports through Karachi. Sharif suggested \ninstead that Pakistani forces might try to capture Bin Ladin themselves. Though no one in Washington thought this \nwas likely to happen, President Clinton gave the idea his blessing.  \n\nThe President met with Sharif in Washington in early July. Though the meeting's main purpose was to seal the \nPakistani prime minister's decision to withdraw from the Kargil confrontation in Kashmir, President Clinton \ncomplained about Pakistan's failure to take effective action with respect to the Taliban and Bin Ladin. Sharif came \nback to his earlier proposal and won approval for U. S. assistance in training a Pakistani special forces team for an \noperation against Bin Ladin. Then, in October 1999, Sharif was deposed by General Pervez Musharraf, and the \nplan was terminated.  \n\nAt first, the Clinton administration hoped that Musharraf 's coup might create an opening for action on Bin Ladin. A \ncareer military officer, Musharraf was thought to have the political strength to confront and influence the Pakistani \nmilitary intelligence service, which supported the Taliban. Berger speculated that the new government might use \nBin Ladin to buy concessions from Washington, but neither side ever developed such an initiative.  \n\nBy late 1999, more than a year after the embassy bombings, diplomacy with Pakistan, like the efforts with the \nTaliban, had, according to Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering, \"borne little fruit. \"  \n\n4. 4 COVERT ACTION \n\nAs part of the response to the embassy bombings, President Clinton signed a Memorandum of Notification \nauthorizing the CIA to let its tribal assets use force to capture Bin Ladin and his associates. CIA officers told the \ntribals that the plan to capture Bin Ladin, which had been \"turned off \" three months earlier, was back on. The \nmemorandum also authorized the CIA to attack Bin Ladin in other ways. Also, an executive order froze financial \nholdings that could be linked to Bin Ladin.  \n\nThe counterterrorism staff at CIA thought it was gaining a better understanding of Bin Ladin and his network. In \npreparation for briefing the Senate\n\nSelect Committee on Intelligence on September 2, Tenet was told that the intelligence community knew more about \nBin Ladin's network \"than about any other top tier terrorist organization. \"  \n\n\n\nThe CIA was using this knowledge to disrupt a number of Bin Ladin-associated cells. Working with Albanian \nauthorities, CIA operatives had raided an al Qaeda forgery operation and another terrorist cell in Tirana. These \noperations may have disrupted a planned attack on the U. S. embassy in Tirana, and did lead to the rendition of a \nnumber of al Qaeda-related terrorist operatives. After the embassy bombings, there were arrests in Azerbaijan, \nItaly, and Britain. Several terrorists were sent to an Arab country. The CIA described working with FBI operatives to \nprevent a planned attack on the U. S. embassy in Uganda, and a number of suspects were arrested. On \nSeptember 16, Abu Hajer, one of Bin Ladin's deputies in Sudan and the head of his computer operations and \nweapons procurement, was arrested in Germany. He was the most important Bin Ladin lieutenant captured thus far. \nClarke commented to Berger with satisfaction that August and September had brought the \"greatest number of \nterrorist arrests in a short period of time that we have ever arranged/facilitated. \"  \n\nGiven the President's August Memorandum of Notification, the CIA had already been working on new plans for \nusing the Afghan tribals to capture Bin Ladin. During September and October, the tribals claimed to have tried at \nleast four times to ambush Bin Ladin. Senior CIA officials doubted whether any of these ambush attempts had \nactually occurred. But the tribals did seem to have success in reporting where Bin Ladin was.  \n\nThis information was more useful than it had been in the past; since the August missile strikes, Bin Ladin had taken \nto moving his sleeping place frequently and unpredictably and had added new bodyguards. Worst of all, al Qaeda's \nsenior leadership had stopped using a particular means of communication almost immediately after a leak to the \nWashington Times .   This made it much more difficult for the National Security Agency to intercept his \nconversations. But since the tribals seemed to know where Bin Ladin was or would be, an alternative to capturing \nBin Ladin would be to mark his location and call in another round of missile strikes.\n\nOn November 3, the Small Group met to discuss these problems, among other topics. Preparing Director Tenet for \na Small Group meeting in mid- November, the Counterterrorist Center stressed, \"At this point we cannot predict \nwhen or if a capture operation will be executed by our assets. \"  \n\nU. S. counterterrorism officials also worried about possible domestic attacks. Several intelligence reports, some of \ndubious sourcing, mentioned Washington as a possible target. On October 26, Clarke's CSG took the unusual step \nof holding a meeting dedicated to trying \"to evaluate the threat of a terrorist attack in the United States by the \nUsama bin Ladin network. \"   The CSG members were \"urged to be as creative as possible in their thinking\" about \npreventing a Bin Ladin attack on U. S. territory. Participants noted that while the FBI had\n\nbeen given additional resources for such efforts, both it and the CIA were having problems exploiting leads by \ntracing U. S. telephone numbers and translating documents obtained in cell disruptions abroad. The Justice \nDepartment reported that the current guidelines from the Attorney General gave sufficient legal authority for \ndomestic investigation and surveillance.  \n\nThough intelligence gave no clear indication of what might be afoot, some intelligence reports mentioned chemical \nweapons, pointing toward work at a camp in southern Afghanistan called Derunta. On November 4, 1998, the U. S. \nAttorney's Office for the Southern District of New York unsealed its indictment of Bin Ladin, charging him with \nconspiracy to attack U. S. defense installations. The indictment also charged that al Qaeda had allied itself with \nSudan, Iran, and Hezbollah. The original sealed indictment had added that al Qaeda had \"reached an \nunderstanding with the government of Iraq that al Qaeda would not work against that government and that on \nparticular projects, specifically including weapons development, al Qaeda would work cooperatively with the \nGovernment of Iraq. \"   This passage led Clarke, who for years had read intelligence reports on Iraqi-Sudanese \ncooperation on chemical weapons, to speculate to Berger that a large Iraqi presence at chemical facilities in \nKhartoum was \"probably a direct result of the Iraq-Al Qida agreement. \" Clarke added that VX precursor traces \nfound near al Shifa were the \"exact formula used by Iraq. \"   This language about al Qaeda's \"understanding\" with \nIraq had been dropped, however, when a superseding indictment was filed in November 1998.  \n\nOn Friday, December 4, 1998, the CIA included an article in the Presidential Daily Brief describing intelligence, \nreceived from a friendly government, about a threatened hijacking in the United States. This article was declassified \nat our request.\n\nThe same day, Clarke convened a meeting of his CSG to discuss both the\n\n\n\nSidebar 1: \n\nhijacking concern and the antiaircraft missile threat. To address the hijacking warning, the group agreed that New \nYork airports should go to maximum security starting that weekend. They agreed to boost security at other East \ncoast airports. The CIA agreed to distribute versions of the report to the FBI and FAA to pass to the New York \nPolice Department and the airlines. The FAA issued a security directive on December 8, with specific requirements \nfor more intensive air carrier screening of passengers and more oversight of the screening process, at all three New \nYork City area airports.  \n\nThe intelligence community could learn little about the source of the information. Later in December and again in \nearly January 1999, more information arrived from the same source, reporting that the planned hijacking had been \nstalled because two of the operatives, who were sketchily described, had been arrested near Washington, D. C. or \nNew York. After investigation, the FBI could find no information to support the hijack threat; nor could it verify any \narrests like those described in the report. The FAA alert at the New York area airports ended on January 31, 1999.  \n\nOn December 17, the day after the United States and Britain began their Desert Fox bombing campaign against \nIraq, the Small Group convened to discuss intelligence suggesting imminent Bin Ladin attacks on the U. S. \nembassies in Qatar and Ethiopia. The next day, Director Tenet sent a memo to the President, the cabinet, and \nsenior officials throughout the government describing reports that Bin Ladin planned to attack U. S. targets very \nsoon, possibly over the next few days, before Ramadan celebrations began. Tenet said he was \"greatly concerned. \n\"  \n\nWith alarms sounding, members of the Small Group considered ideas about how to respond to or prevent such \nattacks. Generals Shelton and Zinni came up with militaryoptions. Special Operations Forces were later told that \nthey might be ordered to attempt very high-risk in-and-out raids either in Khartoum, to capture a senior Bin Ladin \noperative known as Abu Hafs the Mauritanian - who appeared to be engineering some of the plots - or in Kandahar, \nto capture Bin Ladin himself. Shelton told us that such operations are not risk free, invoking the memory of the 1993 \n\"Black Hawk down\" fiasco in Mogadishu.  \n\nThe CIA reported on December 18 that Bin Ladin might be traveling to Kandahar and could be targeted there with \ncruise missiles. Vessels with Tomahawk cruise missiles were on station in the Arabian Sea, and could fire within a \nfew hours of receiving target data.  \n\nOn December 20, intelligence indicated Bin Ladin would be spending the night at the Haji Habash house, part of the \ngovernor's residence in Kandahar. The chief of the Bin Ladin unit, \"Mike, \" told us that he promptly briefed Tenet \nand his deputy, John Gordon. From the field, the CIA's Gary Schroen advised:\"Hit him tonight - we may not get \nanother chance. \"An urgent teleconference of principals was arranged.  \n\nThe principals considered a cruise missile strike to try to kill Bin Ladin. One issue they discussed was the potential \ncollateral damage - the number of innocent bystanders who would be killed or wounded. General Zinni predicted a \nnumber well over 200 and was concerned about damage to a nearby mosque. The senior intelligence officer on the \nJoint Staff apparently made a different calculation, estimating half as much collateral damage and not predicting \ndamage to the mosque. By the end of the meeting, the principals decided against recommending to the President \nthat he order a strike. A few weeks later, in January 1999, Clarke wrote that the principals had thought the \nintelligence only half reliable and had worried about killing or injuring perhaps 300 people. Tenet said he \nremembered doubts about the reliability of the source and concern about hitting the nearby mosque. \"Mike\" \nremembered Tenet telling him that the military was concerned that a few hours had passed since the last sighting of \nBin Ladin and that this persuaded everyone that the chance of failure was too great.  \n\nSome lower-level officials were angry. \"Mike\" reported to Schroen that he had been unable to sleep after this \ndecision. \"I'm sure we'll regret not acting last night, \" he wrote, criticizing the principals for \"worrying that some stray \nshrapnel might hit the Habash mosque and 'offend' Muslims. \" He commented that they had not shown comparable \nsensitivity when deciding to bomb Muslims in Iraq. The principals, he said, were \"obsessed\" with trying to get others \n- Saudis, Pakistanis, Afghan tribals - to \"do what we won't do. \"Schroen was disappointed too. \"We should have \ndone it last night, \" he wrote. \"We may well come to regret the decision not to go ahead. \"   The Joint Staff 's deputy \ndirector for operations agreed, even though he told us that later intelligence appeared to show that Bin Ladin had \n\n\n\nleft his quarters before the strike would have occurred. Missing Bin Ladin, he said, \"would have caused us a hell of \na problem, but it was a shot we should have taken, and we would have had to pay the price. \"  \n\nThe principals began considering other, more aggressive covert alternatives using the tribals. CIA officers \nsuggested that the tribals would prefer to try a raid rather than a roadside ambush because they would have better \ncontrol, it would be less dangerous, and it played more to their skills and experience. But everyone knew that if the \ntribals were to conduct such a raid, guns would be blazing. The current Memorandum of Notification instructed the \nCIA to capture Bin Ladin and to use lethal force only in self-defense. Work now began on a new memorandum that \nwould give the tribals more latitude. The intention was to say that they could use lethal force if the attempted \ncapture seemed impossible to complete successfully.  \n\nEarly drafts of this highly sensitive document emphasized that it authorized only a capture operation. The tribals \nwere to be paid only if they captured Bin Ladin, not if they killed him. Officials throughout the government approved \nthis draft. But on December 21, the day after principals decided not to launch\n\nthe cruise missile strike against Kandahar, the CIA's leaders urged strengthening the language to allow the tribals \nto be paid whether Bin Ladin was captured or killed. Berger and Tenet then worked together to take this line of \nthought even further.  \n\nThey finally agreed, as Berger reported to President Clinton, that an extraordinary step was necessary. The new \nmemorandum would allow the killing of Bin Ladin if the CIA and the tribals judged that capture was not feasible (a \njudgment it already seemed clear they had reached). The Justice Department lawyer who worked on the draft told \nus that what was envisioned was a group of tribals assaulting a location, leading to a shoot-out. Bin Ladin and \nothers would be captured if possible, but probably would be killed. The administration's position was that under the \nlaw of armed conflict, killing a person who posed an imminent threat to the United States would be an act of self-\ndefense, not an assassination. On Christmas Eve 1998, Berger sent a final draft to President Clinton, with an \nexplanatory memo. The President approved the document.  \n\nBecause the White House considered this operation highly sensitive, only a tiny number of people knew about this \nMemorandum of Notification. Berger arranged for the NSC's legal adviser to inform Albright, Cohen, Shelton, and \nReno. None was allowed to keep a copy. Congressional leaders were briefed, as required by law. Attorney General \nReno had sent a letter to the President expressing her concern: she warned of possible retaliation, including the \ntargeting of U. S. officials. She did not pose any legal objection. A copy of the final document, along with the \ncarefully crafted instructions that were to be sent to the tribals, was given to Tenet.  \n\nA message from Tenet to CIA field agents directed them to communicate to the tribals the instructions authorized \nby the President: the United States preferred that Bin Ladin and his lieutenants be captured, but if a successful \ncapture operation was not feasible, the tribals were permitted to kill them. The instructions added that the tribals \nmust avoid killing others unnecessarily and must not kill or abuse Bin Ladin or his lieutenants if they surrendered. \nFinally, the tribals would not be paid if this set of requirements was not met.  \n\nThe field officer passed these instructions to the tribals word for word. But he prefaced the directions with a \nmessage:\"From the American President down to the average man in the street, we want him [Bin Ladin] stopped. \" \nIf the tribals captured Bin Ladin, the officer assured them that he would receive a fair trial under U. S. law and be \ntreated humanely. The CIA officer reported that the tribals said they \"fully understand the contents, implications and \nthe spirit of the message\" and that that their response was, \"We will try our best to capture Bin Ladin alive and will \nhave no intention of killing or harming him on purpose. \"The tribals explained that they wanted to prove that their \nstandards of behavior were more civilized than those of Bin Ladin and his band of terrorists. In an additional note \naddressed to Schroen, the tribals noted that if they were to adopt Bin Ladin's ethics, \"we would have finished the \njob long before, \"\n\nbut they had been limited by their abilities and \"by our beliefs and laws we have to respect. \"  \n\nSchroen and \"Mike\"were impressed by the tribals' reaction. Schroen cabled that the tribals were not in it for the \nmoney but as an investment in the future of Afghanistan. \"Mike\" agreed that the tribals' reluctance to kill was not a \n\"showstopper. \" \"From our view, \" he wrote, \"that seems in character and fair enough. \"  \n\n\n\nPolicymakers in the Clinton administration, including the President and his national security advisor, told us that the \nPresident's intent regarding covert action against Bin Ladin was clear: he wanted him dead. This intent was never \nwell communicated or understood within the CIA. Tenet told the Commission that except in one specific case \n(discussed later), the CIA was authorized to kill Bin Ladin only in the context of a capture operation. CIA senior \nmanagers, operators, and lawyers confirmed this understanding. \"We always talked about how much easier it \nwould have been to kill him, \" a former chief of the Bin Ladin unit said.  \n\nIn February 1999, another draft Memorandum of Notification went to President Clinton. It asked him to allow the \nCIA to give exactly the same guidance to the Northern Alliance as had just been given to the tribals: they could kill \nBin Ladin if a successful capture operation was not feasible. On this occasion, however, President Clinton crossed \nout key language he had approved in December and inserted more ambiguous language. No one we interviewed \ncould shed light on why the President did this. President Clinton told the Commission that he had no recollection of \nwhy he rewrote the language.  \n\nLater in 1999, when legal authority was needed for enlisting still other collaborators and for covering a wider set of \ncontingencies, the lawyers returned to the language used in August 1998, which authorized force only in the context \nof a capture operation. Given the closely held character of the document approved in December 1998, and the \nsubsequent return to the earlier language, it is possible to understand how the former White House officials and the \nCIA officials might disagree as to whether the CIA was ever authorized by the President to kill Bin Ladin.  \n\nThe dispute turned out to be somewhat academic, as the limits of available legal authority were not tested. Clarke \ncommented to Berger that \"despite 'expanded' authority for CIA's sources to engage in direct action, they have \nshown no inclination to do so. \" He added that it was his impression that the CIA thought the tribals unlikely to act \nagainst Bin Ladin and hence relying on them was \"unrealistic. \"   Events seemed to bear him out, since the tribals \ndid not stage an attack on Bin Ladin or his associates during 1999.\n\nThe tribals remained active collectors of intelligence, however, providing good but not predictive information about \nBin Ladin's whereabouts. The CIA also tried to improve its intelligence reporting on Bin Ladin by what Tenet's \nassistant director for collection, the indefatigable Charles Allen, called an \"allout, all-agency, seven-days-a-week\" \neffort.   The effort might have had an\n\neffect. On January 12, 1999, Clarke wrote Berger that the CIA's confidence in the tribals' reporting had increased. It \nwas now higher than it had been on December 20.  \n\nIn February 1999, Allen proposed flying a U-2 mission over Afghanistan to build a baseline of intelligence outside \nthe areas where the tribals had coverage. Clarke was nervous about such a mission because he continued to fear \nthat Bin Ladin might leave for someplace less accessible. He wrote Deputy National Security Advisor Donald \nKerrick that one reliable source reported Bin Ladin's having met with Iraqi officials, who \"may have offered him \nasylum. \" Other intelligence sources said that some Taliban leaders, though not Mullah Omar, had urged Bin Ladin \nto go to Iraq. If Bin Ladin actually moved to Iraq, wrote Clarke, his network would be at Saddam Hussein's service, \nand it would be \"virtually impossible\" to find him. Better to get Bin Ladin in Afghanistan, Clarke declared.   Berger \nsuggested sending one U-2 flight, but Clarke opposed even this. It would require Pakistani approval, he wrote; and \n\"Pak[istan's] intel[ligence service] is in bed with\" Bin Ladin and would warn him that the United States was getting \nready for a bombing campaign: \"Armed with that knowledge, old wily Usama will likely boogie to Baghdad. \"   \nThough told also by Bruce Riedel of the NSC staff that Saddam Hussein wanted Bin Ladin in Baghdad, Berger \nconditionally authorized a single U-2 flight. Allen meanwhile had found other ways of getting the information he \nwanted. So the U-2 flight never occurred.  \n\n4. 5 SEARCHING FOR FRESH OPTIONS \n\n\"Boots on the Ground? \" \n\nStarting on the day the August 1998 strikes were launched, General Shelton had issued a planning order to prepare \nfollow-on strikes and think beyond just using cruise missiles.   The initial strikes had been called Operation Infinite \nReach. The follow-on plans were given the code name Operation Infinite Resolve.\n\n\n\nAt the time, any actual military action in Afghanistan would have been carried out by General Zinni's Central \nCommand. This command was therefore the locus for most military planning. Zinni was even less enthusiastic than \nCohen and Shelton about follow-on cruise missile strikes. He knew that the Tomahawks did not always hit their \ntargets. After the August 20 strikes, President Clinton had had to call Pakistani Prime Minister Sharif to apologize \nfor a wayward missile that had killed several people in a Pakistani village. Sharif had been understanding, while \ncommenting on American \"overkill. \"  \n\nZinni feared that Bin Ladin would in the future locate himself in cities, where U. S. missiles could kill thousands of \nAfghans. He worried also lest Pakistani authorities not get adequate warning, think the missiles came from India,\n\nand do something that everyone would later regret. Discussing potential repercussions in the region of his military \nresponsibility, Zinni said, \"It was easy to take the shot from Washington and walk away from it. We had to live there. \n\"  \n\nZinni's distinct preference would have been to build up counterterrorism capabilities in neighboring countries such \nas Uzbekistan. But he told us that he could not drum up much interest in or money for such a purpose from \nWashington, partly, he thought, because these countries had dictatorial governments.  \n\nAfter the decision - in which fear of collateral damage was an important factor - not to use cruise missiles against \nKandahar in December 1998, Shelton and officers in the Pentagon developed plans for using an AC-130 gunship \ninstead of cruise missile strikes. Designed specifically for the special forces, the version of the AC-130 known as \n\"Spooky\"can fly in fast or from high altitude, undetected by radar; guided to its zone by extraordinarily complex \nelectronics, it is capable of rapidly firing precision-guided 25, 40, and 105 mm projectiles. Because this system \ncould target more precisely than a salvo of cruise missiles, it had a much lower risk of causing collateral damage. \nAfter giving Clarke a briefing and being encouraged to proceed, Shelton formally directed Zinni and General Peter \nSchoomaker, who headed the Special Operations Command, to develop plans for an AC-130 mission against Bin \nLadin's headquarters and infrastructure in Afghanistan. The Joint Staff prepared a decision paper for deployment of \nthe Special Operations aircraft.  \n\nThough Berger and Clarke continued to indicate interest in this option, the AC-130s were never deployed. Clarke \nwrote at the time that Zinni opposed their use, and John Maher, the Joint Staff 's deputy director of operations, \nagreed that this was Zinni's position. Zinni himself does not recall blocking the option. He told us that he understood \nthe Special Operations Command had never thought the intelligence good enough to justify actually moving AC-\n130s into position. Schoomaker says, on the contrary, that he thought the AC-130 option feasible.  \n\nThe most likely explanation for the two generals' differing recollections is that both of them thought serious \npreparation for any such operations would require a long-term redeployment of Special Operations forces to the \nMiddle East or South Asia. The AC-130s would need bases because the aircraft's unrefueled range was only a little \nover 2, 000 miles. They needed search-and-rescue backup, which would have still less range. Thus an AC-130 \ndeployment had to be embedded in a wider political and military concept involving Pakistan or other neighboring \ncountries to address issues relating to basing and overflight. No one ever put such an initiative on the table. Zinni \ntherefore cautioned about simply ordering up AC-130 deployments for a quick strike; Schoomaker planned for what \nhe saw as a practical strike option; and the underlying issues were not fully engaged. The Joint Staff decision paper \nwas never turned into an interagency policy paper.\n\nThe same was true for the option of using ground units from the Special Operations Command. Within the \ncommand, some officers - such as Schoomaker - wanted the mission of \"putting boots on the ground\" to get at Bin \nLadin and al Qaeda. At the time, Special Operations was designated as a \"supporting command, \" not a \"supported \ncommand\": that is, it supported a theater commander and did not prepare its own plans for dealing with al Qaeda. \nSchoomaker proposed to Shelton and Cohen that Special Operations become a supported command, but the \nproposal was not adopted. Had it been accepted, he says, he would have taken on the al Qaeda mission instead of \ndeferring to Zinni. Lieutenant General William Boykin, the current deputy under secretary of defense for intelligence \nand a founding member of Delta Force, told us that \"opportunities were missed because of an unwillingness to take \nrisks and a lack of vision and understanding. \"  \n\nPresident Clinton relied on the advice of General Shelton, who informed him that without intelligence on Bin Ladin's \nlocation, a commando raid's chance of failure was high. Shelton told President Clinton he would go forward with \n\n\n\n\"boots on the ground\" if the President ordered him to do so; however, he had to ensure that the President was \ncompletely aware of the large logistical problems inherent in a military operation.  \n\nThe Special Operations plans were apparently conceived as another quick strike option - an option to insert forces \nafter the United States received actionable intelligence. President Clinton told the Commission that \"if we had had \nreally good intelligence about . . . where [Usama Bin Ladin] was, I would have done it. \" Zinni and Schoomaker did \nmake preparations for possible very high risk in-and-out operations to capture or kill terrorists. Cohen told the \nCommission that the notion of putting military personnel on the ground without some reasonable certitude that Bin \nLadin was in a particular location would have resulted in the mission's failure and the loss of life in a fruitless effort.   \nNone of these officials was aware of the ambitious plan developed months earlier by lower-level Defense officials.\n\nIn our interviews, some military officers repeatedly invoked the analogy of Desert One and the failed 1980 hostage \nrescue mission in Iran.   They were dubious about a quick strike approach to using Special Operations Forces, \nwhich they thought complicated and risky. Such efforts would have required bases in the region, but all the options \nwere unappealing. Pro-Taliban elements of Pakistan's military might warn Bin Ladin or his associates of pending \noperations. With nearby basing options limited, an alternative was to fly from ships in the Arabian Sea or from land \nbases in the Persian Gulf, as was done after 9/11. Such operations would then have to be supported from long \ndistances, overflying the airspace of nations that might not have been supportive or aware of U. S. efforts.  \n\nHowever, if these hurdles were addressed, and if the military could then operate regularly in the region for a long \nperiod, perhaps clandestinely, it might\n\nattempt to gather intelligence and wait for an opportunity. One Special Operations commander said his view of \nactionable intelligence was that if you \"give me the action, I will give you the intelligence. \"   But this course would \nstill be risky, in light both of the difficulties already mentioned and of the danger that U. S. operations might fail \ndisastrously. We have found no evidence that such a long-term political-military approach for using Special \nOperations Forces in the region was proposed to or analyzed by the Small Group, even though such capability had \nbeen honed for at least a decade within the Defense Department.\n\nTherefore the debate looked to some like bold proposals from civilians meeting hypercaution from the military. \nClarke saw it this way. Of the military, he said to us, \"They were very, very, very reluctant. \"   But from another \nperspective, poorly informed proposals for bold action were pitted against experienced professional judgment. That \nwas how Secretary of Defense Cohen viewed it. He said to us:\"I would have to place my judgment call in terms of, \ndo I believe that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, former commander of Special Forces command, is in a better \nposition to make a judgment on the feasibility of this than, perhaps, Mr. Clarke? \"  \n\nBeyond a large-scale political-military commitment to build up a covert or clandestine capability using American \npersonnel on the ground, either military or CIA, there was a still larger option that could have been considered - \ninvading Afghanistan itself. Every official we questioned about the possibility of an invasion of Afghanistan said that \nit was almost unthinkable, absent a provocation such as 9/11, because of poor prospects for cooperation from \nPakistan and other nations and because they believed the public would not support it. Cruise missiles were and \nwould remain the only military option on the table.\n\nThe Desert Camp, February 1999 \n\nEarly in 1999, the CIA received reporting that Bin Ladin was spending much of his time at one of several camps in \nthe Afghan desert south of Kandahar. At the beginning of February, Bin Ladin was reportedly located in the vicinity \nof the Sheikh Ali camp, a desert hunting camp being used by visitors from a Gulf state. Public sources have stated \nthat these visitors were from the United Arab Emirates.  \n\nReporting from the CIA's assets provided a detailed description of the hunting camp, including its size, location, \nresources, and security, as well as of Bin Ladin's smaller, adjacent camp.   Because this was not in an urban area, \nmissiles launched against it would have less risk of causing collateral damage. On February 8, the military began to \nready itself for a possible strike.   The next day, national technical intelligence confirmed the location and \ndescription of the larger camp and showed the nearby presence of an official aircraft of the United Arab Emirates. \n\n\n\nBut the location of Bin Ladin's quarters could not be pinned down so precisely.   The CIA did its best to answer a \nhost of questions\n\nabout the larger camp and its residents and about Bin Ladin's daily schedule and routines to support military \ncontingency planning. According to reporting from the tribals, Bin Ladin regularly went from his adjacent camp to \nthe larger camp where he visited the Emiratis; the tribals expected him to be at the hunting camp for such a visit at \nleast until midmorning on February 11.   Clarke wrote to Berger's deputy on February 10 that the military was then \ndoing targeting work to hit the main camp with cruise missiles and should be in position to strike the following \nmorning.   Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert appears to have been briefed on the situation.  \n\nNo strike was launched. By February 12 Bin Ladin had apparently moved on, and the immediate strike plans \nbecame moot.   According to CIA and Defense officials, policymakers were concerned about the danger that a \nstrike would kill an Emirati prince or other senior officials who might be with Bin Ladin or close by. Clarke told us the \nstrike was called off after consultations with Director Tenet because the intelligence was dubious, and it seemed to \nClarke as if the CIA was presenting an option to attack America's best counterterrorism ally in the Gulf. The lead \nCIA official in the field, Gary Schroen, felt that the intelligence reporting in this case was very reliable; the Bin Ladin \nunit chief, \"Mike, \" agreed. Schroen believes today that this was a lost opportunity to kill Bin Ladin before 9/11.  \n\nEven after Bin Ladin's departure from the area, CIA officers hoped he might return, seeing the camp as a magnet \nthat could draw him for as long as it was still set up. The military maintained readiness for another strike \nopportunity.   On March 7, 1999, Clarke called a UAE official to express his concerns about possible associations \nbetween Emirati officials and Bin Ladin. Clarke later wrote in a memorandum of this conversation that the call had \nbeen approved at an interagency meeting and cleared with the CIA.   When the former Bin Ladin unit chief found \nout about Clarke's call, he questioned CIA officials, who denied having given such a clearance.   Imagery confirmed \nthat less than a week after Clarke's phone call the camp was hurriedly dismantled, and the site was deserted.   CIA \nofficers, including Deputy Director for Operations Pavitt, were irate. \"Mike\" thought the dismantling of the camp \nerased a possible site for targeting Bin Ladin.  \n\nThe United Arab Emirates was becoming both a valued counterterrorism ally of the United States and a persistent \ncounterterrorism problem. From 1999 through early 2001, the United States, and President Clinton personally, \npressed the UAE, one of the Taliban's only travel and financial outlets to the outside world, to break off its ties and \nenforce sanctions, especially those relating to flights to and from Afghanistan.   These efforts achieved little before \n9/11.\n\nIn July 1999, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hamdan bin Zayid threatened to break relations with the \nTaliban over Bin Ladin.   The Taliban did not take him seriously, however. Bin Zayid later told an American diplo-\n\nmat that the UAE valued its relations with the Taliban because the Afghan radicals offered a counterbalance to \n\"Iranian dangers\" in the region, but he also noted that the UAE did not want to upset the United States.  \n\nLooking for New Partners \n\nAlthough not all CIA officers had lost faith in the tribals' capabilities - many judged them to be good reporters - few \nbelieved they would carry out an ambush of Bin Ladin. The chief of the Counterterrorist Center compared relying on \nthe tribals to playing the lottery.   He and his associates, supported by Clarke, pressed for developing a partnership \nwith the Northern Alliance, even though doing so might bring the United States squarely behind one side in \nAfghanistan's long-running civil war.\n\nThe Northern Alliance was dominated by Tajiks and drew its strength mainly from the northern and eastern parts of \nAfghanistan. In contrast, Taliban members came principally from Afghanistan's most numerous ethnic group, the \nPashtuns, who are concentrated in the southern part of the country, extending into the North-West Frontier and \nBaluchistan provinces of Pakistan.  \n\nBecause of the Taliban's behavior and its association with Pakistan, the Northern Alliance had been able at various \ntimes to obtain assistance from Russia, Iran, and India. The alliance's leader was Afghanistan's most renowned \nmilitary commander, Ahmed Shah Massoud. Reflective and charismatic, he had been one of the true heroes of the \nwar against the Soviets. But his bands had been charged with more than one massacre, and the Northern Alliance \n\n\n\nwas widely thought to finance itself in part through trade in heroin. Nor had Massoud shown much aptitude for \ngoverning except as a ruthless warlord. Nevertheless, Tenet told us Massoud seemed the most interesting possible \nnew ally against Bin Ladin.  \n\nIn February 1999, Tenet sought President Clinton's authorization to enlist Massoud and his forces as partners. In \nresponse to this request, the President signed the Memorandum of Notification whose language he personally \naltered. Tenet says he saw no significance in the President's changes. So far as he was concerned, it was the \nlanguage of August 1998, expressing a preference for capture but accepting the possibility that Bin Ladin could not \nbe brought out alive. \"We were plowing the same ground, \"Tenet said.  \n\nCIA officers described Massoud's reaction when he heard that the United States wanted him to capture and not kill \nBin Ladin. One characterized Massoud's body language as \"a wince. \"Schroen recalled Massoud's response as \n\"You guys are crazy - you haven't changed a bit. \" In Schroen's opinion, the capture proviso inhibited Massoud and \nhis forces from going after Bin Ladin but did not completely stop them.   The idea, however, was a long shot. Bin \nLadin's usual base of activity was near Kandahar, far from the front lines of Taliban operations against the Northern \nAlliance.\n\nKandahar, May 1999 \n\nIt was in Kandahar that perhaps the last, and most likely the best, opportunity arose for targeting Bin Ladin with \ncruise missiles before 9/11. In May 1999, CIA assets in Afghanistan reported on Bin Ladin's location in and around \nKandahar over the course of five days and nights. The reporting was very detailed and came from several sources. \nIf this intelligence was not \"actionable, \" working-level officials said at the time and today, it was hard for them to \nimagine how any intelligence on Bin Ladin in Afghanistan would meet the standard. Communications were good, \nand the cruise missiles were ready. \"This was in our strike zone, \" a senior military officer said. \"It was a fat pitch, a \nhome run. \" He expected the missiles to fly. When the decision came back that they should stand down, not shoot, \nthe officer said, \"we all just slumped. \" He told us he knew of no one at the Pentagon or the CIA who thought it was \na bad gamble. Bin Ladin \"should have been a dead man\" that night, he said.  \n\nWorking-level CIA officials agreed. While there was a conflicting intelligence report about Bin Ladin's whereabouts, \nthe experts discounted it. At the time, CIA working-level officials were told by their managers that the strikes were \nnot ordered because the military doubted the intelligence and worried about collateral damage. Replying to a \nfrustrated colleague in the field, the Bin Ladin unit chief wrote:\"having a chance to get [Bin Ladin] three times in 36 \nhours and foregoing the chance each time has made me a bit angry. . . . [T]he DCI finds himself alone at the table, \nwith the other princip[als] basically saying 'we'll go along with your decision Mr. Director, ' and implicitly saying that \nthe Agency will hang alone if the attack doesn't get Bin Ladin. \"   But the military officer quoted earlier recalled that \nthe Pentagon had been willing to act. He told us that Clarke informed him and others that Tenet assessed the \nchance of the intelligence being accurate as 50-50. This officer believed that Tenet's assessment was the key to the \ndecision.  \n\nTenet told us he does not remember any details about this episode, except that the intelligence came from a single \nuncorroborated source and that there was a risk of collateral damage. The story is further complicated by Tenet's \nabsence from the critical principals meeting on this strike (he was apparently out of town); his deputy, John Gordon, \nwas representing the CIA. Gordon recalled having presented the intelligence in a positive light, with appropriate \ncaveats, but stating that this intelligence was about as good as it could get.  \n\nBerger remembered only that in all such cases, the call had been Tenet's. Berger felt sure that Tenet was eager to \nget Bin Ladin. In his view, Tenet did his job responsibly. \"George would call and say, 'We just don't have it, '\" Berger \nsaid.  \n\nThe decision not to strike in May 1999 may now seem hard to understand. In fairness, we note two points: First, in \nDecember 1998, the principals'wariness about ordering a strike appears to have been vindicated: Bin Ladin left his \nroom unexpectedly, and if a strike had been ordered he would not have been\n\nhit. Second, the administration, and the CIA in particular, was in the midst of intense scrutiny and criticism in May \n1999 because faulty intelligence had just led the United States to mistakenly bomb the Chinese embassy in \n\n\n\nBelgrade during the NATO war against Serbia. This episode may have made officials more cautious than might \notherwise have been the case.  \n\nFrom May 1999 until September 2001, policymakers did not again actively consider a missile strike against Bin \nLadin.   The principals did give some further consideration in 1999 to more general strikes, reviving Clarke's \n\"Delenda\" notion of hitting camps and infrastructure to disrupt al Qaeda's organization. In the first months of 1999, \nthe Joint Staff had developed broader target lists to undertake a \"focused campaign\" against the infrastructure of \nBin Ladin's network and to hit Taliban government sites as well. General Shelton told us that the Taliban targets \nwere \"easier\" to hit and more substantial.  \n\nPart of the context for considering broader strikes in the summer of 1999 was renewed worry about Bin Ladin's \nambitions to acquire weapons of mass destruction. In May and June, the U. S. government received a flurry of \nominous reports, including more information about chemical weapons training or development at the Derunta camp \nand possible attempts to amass nuclear material at Herat.  \n\nBy late June, U. S. and other intelligence services had concluded that al Qaeda was in pre-attack mode, perhaps \nagain involving Abu Hafs the Mauritanian. On June 25, at Clarke's request, Berger convened the Small Group in his \noffice to discuss the alert, Bin Ladin's WMD programs, and his location. \"Should we pre-empt by attacking UBL \nfacilities? \" Clarke urged Berger to ask his colleagues.  \n\nIn his handwritten notes on the meeting paper, Berger jotted down the presence of 7 to 11 families in the Tarnak \nFarms facility, which could mean 60-65 casualties. Berger noted the possible \"slight impact\" on Bin Ladin and \nadded, \"if he responds, we're blamed. \"   The NSC staff raised the option of waiting until after a terrorist attack, and \nthen retaliating, including possible strikes on the Taliban. But Clarke observed that Bin Ladin would probably empty \nhis camps after an attack.  \n\nThe military route seemed to have reached a dead end. In December 1999, Clarke urged Berger to ask the \nprincipals to ask themselves:\"Why have there been no real options lately for direct US military action? \"   There are \nno notes recording whether the question was discussed or, if it was, how it was answered.\n\nReports of possible attacks by Bin Ladin kept coming in throughout 1999. They included a threat to blow up the FBI \nbuilding in Washington, D. C. In September, the CSG reviewed a possible threat to a flight out of Los Angeles or \nNew York.   These warnings came amid dozens of others that flooded in.\n\nWith military and diplomatic options practically exhausted by the summer of 1999, the U. S. government seemed to \nbe back where it had been in the summer of 1998 - relying on the CIA to find some other option. That\n\npicture also seemed discouraging. Several disruptions and renditions aimed against the broader al Qaeda network \nhad succeeded.   But covert action efforts in Afghanistan had not been fruitful.\n\nIn mid-1999, new leaders arrived at the Counterterrorist Center and the Bin Ladin unit. The new director of CTC, \nreplacing \"Jeff, \" was Cofer Black. The new head of the section that included the Bin Ladin unit was \"Richard. \" \nBlack, \"Richard, \" and their colleagues began working on a new operational strategy for attacking al Qaeda; their \nstarting point was to get better intelligence, relying more on the CIA's own sources and less on the tribals.  \n\nIn July 1999, President Clinton authorized the CIA to work with several governments to capture Bin Ladin, and \nextended the scope of efforts to Bin Ladin's principal lieutenants. The President reportedly also authorized a covert \naction under carefully limited circumstances which, if successful, would have resulted in Bin Ladin's death.   \nAttorney General Reno again expressed concerns on policy grounds. She was worried about the danger of \nretaliation. The CIA also developed the short-lived effort to work with a Pakistani team that we discussed earlier, \nand an initiative to work with Uzbekistan. The Uzbeks needed basic equipment and training. No action could be \nexpected before March 2000, at the earliest.  \n\nIn fall 1999, DCI Tenet unveiled the CIA's new Bin Ladin strategy. It was called, simply, \"the Plan. \"The Plan \nproposed continuing disruption and rendition operations worldwide. It announced a program for hiring and training \nbetter officers with counterterrorism skills, recruiting more assets, and trying to penetrate al Qaeda's ranks. The \nPlan aimed to close gaps in technical intelligence collection (signal and imagery) as well. In addition, the CIA would \nincrease contacts with the Northern Alliance rebels fighting the Taliban.  \n\n\n\nWith a new operational strategy, the CIA evaluated its capture options. None scored high marks. The CIA had no \nconfidence in the Pakistani effort. In the event that Bin Ladin traveled to the Kandahar region in southern \nAfghanistan, the tribal network there was unlikely to attack a heavily guarded Bin Ladin; the Counterterrorist Center \nrated the chance of success at less than 10 percent. To the northwest, the Uzbeks might be ready for a cross-\nborder sortie in six months; their chance of success was also rated at less than 10 percent.  \n\nIn the northeast were Massoud's Northern Alliance forces - perhaps the CIA's best option. In late October, a group \nof officers from the Counterterrorist Center flew into the Panjshir Valley to meet up with Massoud, a hazardous \njourney in rickety helicopters that would be repeated several times in the future. Massoud appeared committed to \nhelping the United States collect intelligence on Bin Ladin's activities and whereabouts and agreed to try to capture \nhim if the opportunity arose. The Bin Ladin unit was satisfied that its reporting on Bin Ladin would now have a \nsecond source. But it also knew that Massoud would act against Bin Ladin only if his own interests and those of the\n\nUnited States intersected. By early December, the CIA rated this possibility at less than 15 percent.  \n\nFinally, the CIA considered the possibility of putting U. S. personnel on the ground in Afghanistan. The CIA had \nbeen discussing this option with Special Operations Command and found enthusiasm on the working level but \nreluctance at higher levels. CIA saw a 95 percent chance of Special Operations Command forces capturing Bin \nLadin if deployed - but less than a 5 percent chance of such a deployment. Sending CIA officers into Afghanistan \nwas to be considered \"if the gain clearly outweighs the risk\" - but at this time no such gains presented themselves \nto warrant the risk.  \n\nAs mentioned earlier, such a protracted deployment of U. S. Special Operations Forces into Afghanistan, perhaps \nas part of a team joined to a deployment of the CIA's own officers, would have required a major policy initiative \n(probably combined with efforts to secure the support of at least one or two neighboring countries) to make a long-\nterm commitment, establish a durable presence on the ground, and be prepared to accept the associated risks and \ncosts. Such a military plan was never developed for interagency consideration before 9/11. As 1999 came to a \nclose, the CIA had a new strategic plan in place for capturing Bin Ladin, but no option was rated as having more \nthan a 15 percent chance of achieving that objective.\n\n5 AL QAEDA AIMS AT THE AMERICAN HOMELAND \n\n5. 1 TERRORIST ENTREPRENEURS \n\nBy early 1999, al Qaeda was already a potent adversary of the United States. Bin Ladin and his chief of operations, \nAbu Hafs al Masri, also known as Mohammed Atef, occupied undisputed leadership positions atop al Qaeda's \norganizational structure. Within this structure, al Qaeda's worldwide terrorist operations relied heavily on the ideas \nand work of enterprising and strongwilled field commanders who enjoyed considerable autonomy. To understand \nhow the organization actually worked and to introduce the origins of the 9/11 plot, we briefly examine three of these \nsubordinate commanders:Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM), Riduan Isamuddin (better known as Hambali), and Abd \nal Rahim al Nashiri. We will devote the most attention to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the chief manager of the \n\"planes operation. \"\n\nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed \n\nNo one exemplifies the model of the terrorist entrepreneur more clearly than Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the \nprincipal architect of the 9/11 attacks. KSM followed a rather tortuous path to his eventual membership in al Qaeda.   \nHighly educated and equally comfortable in a government office or a terrorist safehouse, KSM applied his \nimagination, technical aptitude, and managerial skills to hatching and planning an extraordinary array of terrorist \nschemes. These ideas included conventional car bombing, political assassination, aircraft bombing, hijacking, \nreservoir poisoning, and, ultimately, the use of aircraft as missiles guided by suicide operatives.\n\nLike his nephew Ramzi Yousef (three years KSM's junior), KSM grew up in Kuwait but traces his ethnic lineage to \nthe Baluchistan region straddling Iran and Pakistan. Raised in a religious family, KSM claims to have joined the \n\n\n\nMuslim Brotherhood at age 16 and to have become enamored of violent jihad at youth camps in the desert. In 1983, \nfollowing his graduation from secondary\n\nSidebar 2: \n\nschool, KSM left Kuwait to enroll at Chowan College, a small Baptist school in Murfreesboro, North Carolina. After a \nsemester at Chowan, KSM transferred to North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro, \nwhich he attended with Yousef 's brother, another future al Qaeda member. KSM earned a degree in mechanical \nengineering in December 1986.  \n\nAlthough he apparently did not attract attention for extreme Islamist beliefs or activities while in the United States, \nKSM plunged into the anti-Soviet Afghan jihad soon after graduating from college. Visiting Pakistan for the first time \nin early 1987, he traveled to Peshawar, where his brother Zahid introduced him to the famous Afghan mujahid \nAbdul Rasul Sayyaf, head of the Hizbul- Ittihad El-Islami (Islamic Union Party). Sayyaf became KSM's mentor and \nprovided KSM with military training at Sayyaf 's Sada camp. KSM claims he then fought the Soviets and remained \nat the front for three months before being summoned to perform administrative duties for Abdullah Azzam. KSM \nnext took a job working for an electronics firm that catered to the communications needs of Afghan groups, where \nhe learned about drills used to excavate caves in Afghanistan.  \n\nBetween 1988 and 1992, KSM helped run a nongovernmental organization\n\n(NGO) in Peshawar and Jalalabad; sponsored by Sayyaf, it was designed to aid young Afghan mujahideen. In \n1992, KSM spent some time fighting alongside the mujahideen in Bosnia and supporting that effort with financial \ndonations. After returning briefly to Pakistan, he moved his family to Qatar at the suggestion of the former minister \nof Islamic affairs of Qatar, Sheikh Abdallah bin Khalid bin Hamad al Thani. KSM took a position in Qatar as project \nengineer with the Qatari Ministry of Electricity and Water. Although he engaged in extensive international travel \nduring his tenure at the ministry - much of it in furtherance of terrorist activity - KSM would hold his position there \nuntil early 1996, when he fled to Pakistan to avoid capture by U. S. authorities.  \n\nKSM first came to the attention of U. S. law enforcement as a result of his cameo role in the first World Trade \nCenter bombing. According to KSM, he learned of Ramzi Yousef 's intention to launch an attack inside the United \nStates in 1991 or 1992, when Yousef was receiving explosives training in Afghanistan. During the fall of 1992, while \nYousef was building the bomb he would use in that attack, KSM and Yousef had numerous telephone \nconversations during which Yousef discussed his progress and sought additional funding. On November 3, 1992, \nKSM wired $660 from Qatar to the bank account of Yousef 's co-conspirator, Mohammed Salameh. KSM does not \nappear to have contributed any more substantially to this operation.  \n\nYousef 's instant notoriety as the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing inspired KSM to become \ninvolved in planning attacks against the United States. By his own account, KSM's animus toward the United States \nstemmed not from his experiences there as a student, but rather from his violent disagreement with U. S. foreign \npolicy favoring Israel. In 1994, KSM accompanied Yousef to the Philippines, and the two of them began planning \nwhat is now known as the Manila air or \"Bojinka\" plot - the intended bombing of 12 U. S. commercial jumbo jets \nover the Pacific during a two-day span. This marked the first time KSM took part in the actual planning of a terrorist \noperation. While sharing an apartment in Manila during the summer of 1994, he and Yousef acquired chemicals \nand other materials necessary to construct bombs and timers. They also cased target flights to Hong Kong and \nSeoul that would have onward legs to the United States. During this same period, KSM and Yousef also developed \nplans to assassinate President Clinton during his November 1994 trip to Manila, and to bomb U. S. -bound cargo \ncarriers by smuggling jackets containing nitrocellulose on board.  \n\nKSM left the Philippines in September 1994 and met up with Yousef in Karachi following their casing flights. There \nthey enlisted Wali Khan Amin Shah, also known as Usama Asmurai, in the Manila air plot. During the fall of 1994, \nYousef returned to Manila and successfully tested the digital watch timer he had invented, bombing a movie theater \nand a Philippine Airlines flight en route to Tokyo. The plot unraveled after the Philippine authorities discovered \nYousef 's bomb-making operation in Manila; but by that time, KSM was safely\n\n  \u2022 \n\n\n\nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed, mastermind of the 9/11 plot, at the time of his capture in 2003 \n\nback at his government job in Qatar. Yousef attempted to follow through on the cargo carriers plan, but he was \narrested in Islamabad by Pakistani authorities on February 7, 1995, after an accomplice turned him in.  \n\nKSM continued to travel among the worldwide jihadist community after Yousef 's arrest, visiting the Sudan, Yemen, \nMalaysia, and Brazil in 1995. No clear evidence connects him to terrorist activities in those locations. While in \nSudan, he reportedly failed in his attempt to meet with Bin Ladin. But KSM did see Atef, who gave him a contact in \nBrazil. In January 1996, well aware that U. S. authorities were chasing him, he left Qatar for good and fled to \nAfghanistan, where he renewed his relationship with Rasul Sayyaf.  \n\nJust as KSM was reestablishing himself in Afghanistan in mid-1996, Bin Ladin and his colleagues were also \ncompleting their migration from Sudan. Through Atef, KSM arranged a meeting with Bin Ladin in Tora Bora, a \nmountainous redoubt from the Afghan war days. At the meeting, KSM presented the al Qaeda leader with a menu \nof ideas for terrorist operations. According to KSM, this meeting was the first time he had seen Bin Ladin since \n1989. Although they had fought together in 1987, Bin Ladin and KSM did not yet enjoy an especially close working \nrelationship. Indeed, KSM has acknowledged\n\nthat Bin Ladin likely agreed to meet with him because of the renown of his nephew, Yousef.  \n\nAt the meeting, KSM briefed Bin Ladin and Atef on the first World Trade Center bombing, the Manila air plot, the \ncargo carriers plan, and other activities pursued by KSM and his colleagues in the Philippines. KSM also presented \na proposal for an operation that would involve training pilots who would crash planes into buildings in the United \nStates. This proposal eventually would become the 9/11 operation.  \n\nKSM knew that the successful staging of such an attack would require personnel, money, and logistical support that \nonly an extensive and well-funded organization like al Qaeda could provide. He thought the operation might appeal \nto Bin Ladin, who had a long record of denouncing the United States.  \n\nFrom KSM's perspective, Bin Ladin was in the process of consolidating his new position in Afghanistan while \nhearing out others' ideas, and had not yet settled on an agenda for future anti-U. S. operations. At the meeting, Bin \nLadin listened to KSM's ideas without much comment, but did ask KSM formally to join al Qaeda and move his \nfamily to Afghanistan.  \n\nKSM declined. He preferred to remain independent and retain the option of working with other mujahideen groups \nstill operating in Afghanistan, including the group led by his old mentor, Sayyaf. Sayyaf was close to Ahmed Shah \nMassoud, the leader of the Northern Alliance. Therefore working with him might be a problem for KSM because Bin \nLadin was building ties to the rival Taliban.\n\nAfter meeting with Bin Ladin, KSM says he journeyed onward to India, Indonesia, and Malaysia, where he met with \nJemaah Islamiah's Hambali. Hambali was an Indonesian veteran of the Afghan war looking to expand the jihad into \nSoutheast Asia. In Iran, KSM rejoined his family and arranged to move them to Karachi; he claims to have \nrelocated by January 1997.  \n\nAfter settling his family in Karachi, KSM tried to join the mujahid leader Ibn al Khattab in Chechnya. Unable to \ntravel through Azerbaijan, KSM returned to Karachi and then to Afghanistan to renew contacts with Bin Ladin and \nhis colleagues. Though KSM may not have been a member of al Qaeda at this time, he admits traveling frequently \nbetween Pakistan and Afghanistan in 1997 and the first half of 1998, visiting Bin Ladin and cultivating relationships \nwith his lieutenants, Atef and Sayf al Adl, by assisting them with computer and media projects.  \n\nAccording to KSM, the 1998 bombings of the U. S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam marked a watershed in \nthe evolution of the 9/11 plot. KSM claims these bombings convinced him that Bin Ladin was truly committed to \nattacking the United States. He continued to make himself useful, collecting news articles and helping other al \nQaeda members with their outdated computer equipment. Bin Ladin, apparently at Atef 's urging, finally decided to \ngive KSM the green light for the 9/11 operation sometime in late 1998 or early 1999.  \n\nKSM then accepted Bin Ladin's standing invitation to move to Kandahar and work directly with al Qaeda. In addition \nto supervising the planning and preparations for the 9/11 operation, KSM worked with and eventually led al Qaeda's \n\n\n\nmedia committee. But KSM states he refused to swear a formal oath of allegiance to Bin Ladin, thereby retaining a \nlast vestige of his cherished autonomy.  \n\nAt this point, late 1998 to early 1999, planning for the 9/11 operation began in earnest. Yet while the 9/11 project \noccupied the bulk of KSM's attention, he continued to consider other possibilities for terrorist attacks. For example, \nhe sent al Qaeda operative Issa al Britani to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to learn about the jihad in Southeast Asia \nfrom Hambali. Thereafter, KSM claims, at Bin Ladin's direction in early 2001, he sent Britani to the United States to \ncase potential economic and \"Jewish\" targets in New York City. Furthermore, during the summer of 2001, KSM \napproached Bin Ladin with the idea of recruiting a Saudi Arabian air force pilot to commandeer a Saudi fighter jet \nand attack the Israeli city of Eilat. Bin Ladin reportedly liked this proposal, but he instructed KSM to concentrate on \nthe 9/11 operation first. Similarly, KSM's proposals to Atef around this same time for attacks in Thailand, Singapore, \nIndonesia, and the Maldives were never executed, although Hambali's Jemaah Islamiah operatives did some \ncasing of possible targets.  \n\nKSM appears to have been popular among the al Qaeda rank and file. He was reportedly regarded as an effective \nleader, especially after the 9/11 attacks. Co-workers describe him as an intelligent, efficient, and even-tempered \nmanager who approached his projects with a single-minded dedication that he expected his colleagues to share. Al \nQaeda associate Abu Zubaydah has expressed more qualified admiration for KSM's innate creativity, emphasizing \ninstead his ability to incorporate the improvements suggested by others. Nashiri has been similarly measured, \nobserving that although KSM floated many general ideas for attacks, he rarely conceived a specific operation \nhimself.   Perhaps these estimates reflect a touch of jealousy; in any case, KSM was plainly a capable coordinator, \nhaving had years to hone his skills and build relationships.\n\nHambali \n\nAl Qaeda's success in fostering terrorism in Southeast Asia stems largely from its close relationship with Jemaah \nIslamiah (JI). In that relationship, Hambali became the key coordinator. Born and educated in Indonesia, Hambali \nmoved to Malaysia in the early 1980s to find work. There he claims to have become a follower of the Islamist \nextremist teachings of various clerics, including one named Abdullah Sungkar. Sungkar first inspired Hambali to \nshare the vision of establishing a radical Islamist regime in Southeast Asia, then furthered Hambali's instruction in \njihad by sending him to Afghanistan in 1986. After undergoing training at Rasul Sayyaf 's Sada camp (where KSM \nwould later train), Hambali fought against the Soviets; he eventually returned to Malaysia after 18\n\nmonths in Afghanistan. By 1998, Hambali would assume responsibility for the Malaysia/Singapore region within \nSungkar's newly formed terrorist organization, the JI.  \n\nAlso by 1998, Sungkar and JI spiritual leader Abu Bakar Bashir had accepted Bin Ladin's offer to ally JI with al \nQaeda in waging war against Christians and Jews.   Hambali met with KSM in Karachi to arrange for JI members to \nreceive training in Afghanistan at al Qaeda's camps. In addition to his close working relationship with KSM, Hambali \nsoon began dealing with Atef as well. Al Qaeda began funding JI's increasingly ambitious terrorist plans, which Atef \nand KSM sought to expand. Under this arrangement, JI would perform the necessary casing activities and locate \nbomb-making materials and other supplies. Al Qaeda would underwrite operations, provide bomb-making \nexpertise, and deliver suicide operatives.  \n\nThe al Qaeda-JI partnership yielded a number of proposals that would marry al Qaeda's financial and technical \nstrengths with JI's access to materials and local operatives. Here, Hambali played the critical role of coordinator, as \nhe distributed al Qaeda funds earmarked for the joint operations. In one especially notable example, Atef turned to \nHambali when al Qaeda needed a scientist to take over its biological weapons program. Hambali obliged by \nintroducing a U. S. - educated JI member, Yazid Sufaat, to Ayman al Zawahiri in Kandahar. In 2001, Sufaat would \nspend several months attempting to cultivate anthrax for al Qaeda in a laboratory he helped set up near the \nKandahar airport.  \n\nHambali did not originally orient JI's operations toward attacking the United States, but his involvement with al \nQaeda appears to have inspired him to pursue American targets. KSM, in his post-capture interrogations, has taken \ncredit for this shift, claiming to have urged the JI operations chief to concentrate on attacks designed to hurt the U. \n\n\n\nS. economy.   Hambali's newfound interest in striking against the United States manifested itself in a spate of \nterrorist plans. Fortunately, none came to fruition.\n\nIn addition to staging actual terrorist attacks in partnership with al Qaeda, Hambali and JI assisted al Qaeda \noperatives passing through Kuala Lumpur. One important occasion was in December 1999-January 2000. Hambali \naccommodated KSM's requests to help several veterans whom KSM had just finished training in Karachi. They \nincluded Tawfiq bin Attash, also known as Khallad, who later would help bomb the USS Cole , and future 9/11 \nhijackers Nawaf al Hazmi and Khalid al Mihdhar. Hambali arranged lodging for them and helped them purchase \nairline tickets for their onward travel. Later that year, Hambali and his crew would provide accommodations and \nother assistance (including information on flight schools and help in acquiring ammonium nitrate) for Zacarias \nMoussaoui, an al Qaeda operative sent to Malaysia by Atef and KSM.  \n\nHambali used Bin Ladin's Afghan facilities as a training ground for JI recruits. Though he had a close relationship \nwith Atef and KSM, he maintained JI's institutional independence from al Qaeda. Hambali insists that he did not\n\ndiscuss operations with Bin Ladin or swear allegiance to him, having already given such a pledge of loyalty to \nBashir, Sungkar's successor as JI leader. Thus, like any powerful bureaucrat defending his domain, Hambali \nobjected when al Qaeda leadership tried to assign JI members to terrorist projects without notifying him.  \n\nAbd al Rahim al Nashiri \n\nKSM and Hambali both decided to join forces with al Qaeda because their terrorist aspirations required the money \nand manpower that only a robust organization like al Qaeda could supply. On the other hand, Abd al Rahim al \nNashiri - the mastermind of the Cole bombing and the eventual head of al Qaeda operations in the Arabian \nPeninsula - appears to have originally been recruited to his career as a terrorist by Bin Ladin himself.\n\nHaving already participated in the Afghan jihad, Nashiri accompanied a group of some 30 mujahideen in pursuit of \njihad in Tajikistan in 1996. When serious fighting failed to materialize, the group traveled to Jalalabad and \nencountered Bin Ladin, who had recently returned from Sudan. Bin Ladin addressed them at length, urging the \ngroup to join him in a \"jihad against the Americans. \" Although all were urged to swear loyalty to Bin Ladin, many, \nincluding Nashiri, found the notion distasteful and refused. After several days of indoctrination that included a \nbarrage of news clippings and television documentaries, Nashiri left Afghanistan, first returning to his native Saudi \nArabia and then visiting his home in Yemen. There, he says, the idea for his first terrorist operation took shape as \nhe noticed many U. S. and other foreign ships plying the waters along the southwest coast of Yemen.  \n\nNashiri returned to Afghanistan, probably in 1997, primarily to check on relatives fighting there and also to learn \nabout the Taliban. He again encountered Bin Ladin, still recruiting for \"the coming battle with the United States. \n\"Nashiri pursued a more conventional military jihad, joining the Taliban forces in their fight against Ahmed \nMassoud's Northern Alliance and shuttling back and forth between the front and Kandahar, where he would see Bin \nLadin and meet with other mujahideen. During this period, Nashiri also led a plot to smuggle four Russian-made \nantitank missiles into Saudi Arabia from Yemen in early 1998 and helped an embassy bombing operative obtain a \nYemeni passport.  \n\nAt some point, Nashiri joined al Qaeda. His cousin, Jihad Mohammad Ali al Makki, also known as Azzam, was a \nsuicide bomber for the Nairobi attack. Nashiri traveled between Yemen and Afghanistan. In late 1998, Nashiri \nproposed mounting an attack against a U. S. vessel. Bin Ladin approved. He directed Nashiri to start the planning \nand send operatives to Yemen, and he later provided money.  \n\nNashiri reported directly to Bin Ladin, the only other person who, according to Nashiri, knew all the details of the \noperation. When Nashiri had difficulty finding U. S. naval vessels to attack along the western coast of Yemen, Bin\n\nLadin reportedly instructed him to case the Port of Aden, on the southern coast, instead.   The eventual result was \nan attempted attack on the USS The Sullivans in January 2000 and the successful attack, in October 2000, on the \nUSS Cole .\n\nNashiri's success brought him instant status within al Qaeda. He later was recognized as the chief of al Qaeda \noperations in and around the Arabian Peninsula. While Nashiri continued to consult Bin Ladin on the planning of \n\n\n\nsubsequent terrorist projects, he retained discretion in selecting operatives and devising attacks. In the two years \nbetween the Cole bombing and Nashiri's capture, he would supervise several more proposed operations for al \nQaeda. The October 6, 2002, bombing of the French tanker Limburg in the Gulf of Aden also was Nashiri's \nhandiwork. Although Bin Ladin urged Nashiri to continue plotting strikes against U. S. interests in the Persian Gulf, \nNashiri maintains that he actually delayed one of these projects because of security concerns.   Those concerns, it \nseems, were well placed, as Nashiri's November 2002 capture in the United Arab Emirates finally ended his career \nas a terrorist.\n\n5. 2 THE \"PLANES OPERATION\" \n\nAccording to KSM, he started to think about attacking the United States after Yousef returned to Pakistan following \nthe 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Like Yousef, KSM reasoned he could best influence U. S. policy by \ntargeting the country's economy. KSM and Yousef reportedly brainstormed together about what drove the U. S. \neconomy. New York, which KSM considered the economic capital of the United States, therefore became the \nprimary target. For similar reasons, California also became a target for KSM.  \n\nKSM claims that the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center taught him that bombs and explosives could be \nproblematic, and that he needed to graduate to a more novel form of attack. He maintains that he and Yousef \nbegan thinking about using aircraft as weapons while working on the Manila air/Bojinka plot, and speculated about \nstriking the World Trade Center and CIA headquarters as early as 1995.  \n\nCertainly KSM was not alone in contemplating new kinds of terrorist operations. A study reportedly conducted by \nAtef, while he and Bin Ladin were still in Sudan, concluded that traditional terrorist hijacking operations did not fit \nthe needs of al Qaeda, because such hijackings were used to negotiate the release of prisoners rather than to inflict \nmass casualties. The study is said to have considered the feasibility of hijacking planes and blowing them up in \nflight, paralleling the Bojinka concept. Such a study, if it actually existed, yields significant insight into the thinking of \nal Qaeda's leaders: (1) they rejected hijackings aimed at gaining the release of imprisoned comrades as too \ncomplex, because al Qaeda had no friendly countries in which to land a plane and\n\nthen negotiate; (2) they considered the bombing of commercial flights in midair - as carried out against Pan Am \nFlight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland - a promising means to inflict massive casualties; and (3) they did not yet \nconsider using hijacked aircraft as weapons against other targets.  \n\nKSM has insisted to his interrogators that he always contemplated hijacking and crashing large commercial aircraft. \nIndeed, KSM describes a grandiose original plan: a total of ten aircraft to be hijacked, nine of which would crash \ninto targets on both coasts - they included those eventually hit on September 11 plus CIA and FBI headquarters, \nnuclear power plants, and the tallest buildings in California and the state of Washington. KSM himself was to land \nthe tenth plane at a U. S. airport and, after killing all adult male passengers on board and alerting the media, deliver \na speech excoriating U. S. support for Israel, the Philippines, and repressive governments in the Arab world. \nBeyond KSM's rationalizations about targeting the U. S. economy, this vision gives a better glimpse of his true \nambitions. This is theater, a spectacle of destruction with KSM as the self-cast star - the superterrorist.  \n\nKSM concedes that this proposal received a lukewarm response from al Qaeda leaders skeptical of its scale and \ncomplexity. Although Bin Ladin listened to KSM's proposal, he was not convinced that it was practical. As \nmentioned earlier, Bin Ladin was receiving numerous ideas for potential operations - KSM's proposal to attack U. S. \ntargets with commercial airplanes was only one of many.  \n\nKSM presents himself as an entrepreneur seeking venture capital and people. He simply wanted al Qaeda to \nsupply the money and operatives needed for the attack while retaining his independence. It is easy to question such \na statement. Money is one thing; supplying a cadre of trained operatives willing to die is much more. Thus, although \nKSM contends he would have been just as likely to consider working with any comparable terrorist organization, he \ngives no indication of what other groups he thought could supply such exceptional commodities.  \n\nKSM acknowledges formally joining al Qaeda, in late 1998 or 1999, and states that soon afterward, Bin Ladin also \nmade the decision to support his proposal to attack the United States using commercial airplanes as weapons. \nThough KSM speculates about how Bin Ladin came to share his preoccupation with attacking America, Bin Ladin in \n\n\n\nfact had long been an opponent of the United States. KSM thinks that Atef may have persuaded Bin Ladin to \napprove this specific proposal. Atef 's role in the entire operation is unquestionably very significant but tends to fade \ninto the background, in part because Atef himself is not available to describe it. He was killed in November 2001 by \nan American air strike in Afghanistan.  \n\nBin Ladin summoned KSM to Kandahar in March or April 1999 to tell him that al Qaeda would support his proposal. \nThe plot was now referred to within al Qaeda as the \"planes operation. \"  \n\nThe Plan Evolves \n\nBin Ladin reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 \nat the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a \nmedia statement was scrapped, but Bin Ladin considered the basic idea feasible. Bin Ladin, Atef, and KSM \ndeveloped an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U. S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World \nTrade Center. According to KSM, Bin Ladin wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to \nstrike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial \nselection of targets.  \n\nBin Ladin also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, \nKhallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings, Bin Ladin told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were \nso eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U. S. visas. KSM \nstates that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out \nthe Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from Bin Ladin was that the two should eventually \ngo to the United States for pilot training.  \n\nHazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were \nalready experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the \nBalkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had \nvisited Afghanistan on several occasions.  \n\nKhallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because \nof his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew Bin Ladin, Abdullah Azzam, \nand Omar Abdel Rahman (the \"Blind Sheikh\"). Khallad departed for Afghanistan in 1994 at the age of 15. Three \nyears later, he lost his lower right leg in a battle with the Northern Alliance, a battle in which one of his brothers \ndied. After this experience, he pledged allegiance to Bin Ladin - whom he had first met as a child in Jeddah - and \nvolunteered to become a suicide operative.  \n\nWhen Khallad applied for a U. S. visa, however, his application was denied. Earlier in 1999, Bin Ladin had sent \nKhallad to Yemen to help Nashiri obtain explosives for the planned ship-bombing and to obtain a visa to visit the \nUnited States, so that he could participate in an operation there. Khallad applied under another name, using the \ncover story that he would be visiting a medical clinic to obtain a new prosthesis for his leg. Another al Qaeda \noperative gave Khallad the name of a person living in the United States whom Khallad could use as a point of \ncontact on a visa application. Khallad contacted this individual to help him get an appointment at a U. S. clinic. \nWhile Khallad was waiting for the letter from the clinic confirming the appointment, however, he was arrested by \nYemeni authorities. The arrest resulted from mistaken identity:Khallad was driving the car of another conspirator in \nthe ship-bombing plot who was wanted by the Yemeni authorities.  \n\nKhallad was released sometime during the summer of 1999, after his father and Bin Ladin intervened on his behalf. \nKhallad learned later that the al Qaeda leader, apparently concerned that Khallad might reveal Nashiri's operation \nwhile under interrogation, had contacted a Yemeni official to demand Khallad's release, suggesting that Bin Ladin \nwould not confront the Yemenis if they did not confront him. This account has been corroborated by others. Giving \nup on acquiring a U. S. visa and concerned that the United States might learn of his ties to al Qaeda, Khallad \nreturned to Afghanistan.  \n\nTravel issues thus played a part in al Qaeda's operational planning from the very start. During the spring and \nsummer of 1999, KSM realized that Khallad and Abu Bara, both of whom were Yemenis, would not be able to \n\n\n\nobtain U. S. visas as easily as Saudi operatives like Mihdhar and Hazmi. Although Khallad had been unable to \nacquire a U. S. visa, KSM still wanted him and Abu Bara, as well as another Yemeni operative from Bin Ladin's \nsecurity detail, to participate in the planes operation. Yet because individuals with Saudi passports could travel \nmuch more easily than Yemeni, particularly to the United States, there were fewer martyrdom opportunities for \nYemenis. To overcome this problem, KSM decided to split the planes operation into two components.  \n\nThe first part of the planes operation - crashing hijacked aircraft into U. S. targets - would remain as planned, with \nMihdhar and Hazmi playing key roles. The second part, however, would now embrace the idea of using suicide \noperatives to blow up planes, a refinement of KSM's old Manila air plot. The operatives would hijack U. S. -flagged \ncommercial planes flying Pacific routes across East Asia and destroy them in midair, possibly with shoe bombs, \ninstead of flying them into targets. (An alternate scenario apparently involved flying planes into U. S. targets in \nJapan, Singapore, or Korea. ) This part of the operation has been confirmed by Khallad, who said that they \ncontemplated hijacking several planes, probably originating in Thailand, South Korea, Hong Kong, or Malaysia, and \nusing Yemenis who would not need pilot training because they would simply down the planes. All the planes \nhijacked in the United States and East Asia were to be crashed or exploded at about the same time to maximize the \nattack's psychological impact.  \n\nTraining and Deployment to Kuala Lumpur \n\nIn the fall of 1999, the four operatives selected by Bin Ladin for the planes operation were chosen to attend an elite \ntraining course at al Qaeda's Mes Aynak camp in Afghanistan. Bin Ladin personally selected the veteran fighters \nwho received this training, and several of them were destined for important operations. One example is Ibrahim al \nThawar, or Nibras, who would participate in the October 12, 2000, suicide attack on the USS Cole . According to \nKSM, this training was not given specifically in preparation for the planes operation or any other particular al Qaeda \nventure. Although KSM claims not to have been involved with the training or to have met with the future 9/11 \nhijackers at Mes\n\nAynak, he says he did visit the camp while traveling from Kandahar to Kabul with Bin Ladin and others.  \n\nThe Mes Aynak training camp was located in an abandoned Russian copper mine near Kabul. The camp opened in \n1999, after the United States had destroyed the training camp near Khowst with cruise missiles in August 1998, and \nbefore the Taliban granted al Qaeda permission to open the al Faruq camp in Kandahar. Thus, for a brief period in \n1999, Mes Aynak was the only al Qaeda camp operating in Afghanistan. It offered a full range of instruction, \nincluding an advanced commando course taught by senior al Qaeda member Sayf al Adl. Bin Ladin paid particular \nattention to the 1999 training session. When Salah al Din, the trainer for the session, complained about the number \nof trainees and said that no more than 20 could be handled at once, Bin Ladin insisted that everyone he had \nselected receive the training.  \n\nThe special training session at Mes Aynak was rigorous and spared no expense. The course focused on physical \nfitness, firearms, close quarters combat, shooting from a motorcycle, and night operations. Although the subjects \ntaught differed little from those offered at other camps, the course placed extraordinary physical and mental \ndemands on its participants, who received the best food and other amenities to enhance their strength and morale.  \n\nUpon completing the advanced training at Mes Aynak, Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara went to Karachi, Pakistan. \nThere KSM instructed them on Western culture and travel. Much of his activity in mid-1999 had revolved around the \ncollection of training and informational materials for the participants in the planes operation. For instance, he \ncollected Western aviation magazines; telephone directories for American cities such as San Diego and Long \nBeach, California; brochures for schools; and airline timetables, and he conducted Internet searches on U. S. flight \nschools. He also purchased flight simulator software and a few movies depicting hijackings. To house his students, \nKSM rented a safehouse in Karachi with money provided by Bin Ladin.  \n\nIn early December 1999, Khallad and Abu Bara arrived in Karachi. Hazmi joined them there a few days later. On his \nway to Karachi, Hazmi spent a night in Quetta at a safehouse where, according to KSM, an Egyptian named \nMohamed Atta simultaneously stayed on his way to Afghanistan for jihad training.  \n\n\n\nMihdhar did not attend the training in Karachi with the others. KSM says that he never met with Mihdhar in 1999 but \nassumed that Bin Ladin and Atef had briefed Mihdhar on the planes operation and had excused him from the \nKarachi training.  \n\nThe course in Karachi apparently lasted about one or two weeks. According to KSM, he taught the three operatives \nbasic English words and phrases. He showed them how to read phone books, interpret airline timetables, use the \nInternet, use code words in communications, make travel reservations, and rent an apartment. Khallad adds that \nthe training involved using flight simulator com-\n\nputer games, viewing movies that featured hijackings, and reading flight schedules to determine which flights would \nbe in the air at the same time in different parts of the world. They used the game software to increase their \nfamiliarity with aircraft models and functions, and to highlight gaps in cabin security. While in Karachi, they also \ndiscussed how to case flights in Southeast Asia. KSM told them to watch the cabin doors at takeoff and landing, to \nobserve whether the captain went to the lavatory during the flight, and to note whether the flight attendants brought \nfood into the cockpit. KSM, Khallad, and Hazmi also visited travel agencies to learn the visa requirements for Asian \ncountries.  \n\nThe four trainees traveled to Kuala Lumpur: Khallad, Abu Bara, and Hazmi came from Karachi; Mihdhar traveled \nfrom Yemen. As discussed in chapter 6, U. S. intelligence would analyze communications associated with Mihdhar, \nwhom they identified during this travel, and Hazmi, whom they could have identified but did not.  \n\nAccording to KSM, the four operatives were aware that they had volunteered for a suicide operation, either in the \nUnited States or in Asia. With different roles, they had different tasks. Hazmi and Mihdhar were sent to Kuala \nLumpur before proceeding to their final destination - the United States. According to KSM, they were to use Yemeni \ndocuments to fly to Malaysia, then proceed to the United States using their Saudi passports to conceal their prior \ntravels to and from Pakistan. KSM had doctored Hazmi's Saudi passport so it would appear as if Hazmi had \ntraveled to Kuala Lumpur from Saudi Arabia via Dubai. Khallad and Abu Bara went to Kuala Lumpur to study airport \nsecurity and conduct casing flights. According to Khallad, he and Abu Bara departed for Malaysia in mid-December \n1999. Hazmi joined them about ten days later after briefly returning to Afghanistan to attend to some passport \nissues.  \n\nKhallad had originally scheduled his trip in order to receive a new prosthesis at a Kuala Lumpur clinic called \nEndolite, and Bin Ladin suggested that he use the opportunity to case flights as well. According to Khallad, \nMalaysia was an ideal destination because its government did not require citizens of Saudi Arabia or other Gulf \nstates to have a visa. Malaysian security was reputed to be lax when it came to Islamist jihadists. Also, other \nmujahideen wounded in combat had reportedly received treatment at the Endolite clinic and successfully concealed \nthe origins of their injuries. Khallad said he got the money for the prosthesis from his father, Bin Ladin, and another \nal Qaeda colleague.  \n\nAccording to Khallad, when he and Abu Bara arrived in Kuala Lumpur they contacted Hambali to let him know \nwhere they were staying, since he was to be kept informed of al Qaeda activities in Southeast Asia. Hambali picked \nup Khallad and Abu Bara and brought them to his home, enlisting the help of a colleague who spoke better Arabic. \nHambali then took them to the clinic.  \n\nOn December 31, Khallad flew from Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok; the next day, he flew to Hong Kong aboard a U. S. \nairliner. He flew in first class, which he realized was a mistake because this seating assignment on that flight did not \nafford him a view of the cockpit. He claims to have done what he could to case\n\nthe flight, testing security by carrying a box cutter in his toiletries kit onto the flight to Hong Kong. Khallad returned \nto Bangkok the following day. At the airport, the security officials searched his carry-on bag and even opened the \ntoiletries kit, but just glanced at the contents and let him pass. On this flight, Khallad waited until most of the first-\nclass passengers were dozing, then got up and removed the kit from his carry-on. None of the flight attendants took \nnotice.  \n\nAfter completing his casing mission, Khallad returned to Kuala Lumpur. Hazmi arrived in Kuala Lumpur soon \nthereafter and may even have stayed briefly with Khallad and Abu Bara at Endolite. Mihdhar arrived on January 5, \nprobably one day after Hazmi. All four operatives stayed at the apartment of Yazid Sufaat, the Malaysian JI member \nwho made his home available at Hambali's request. According to Khallad, he and Hazmi spoke about the possibility \n\n\n\nof hijacking planes and crashing them or holding passengers as hostages, but only speculatively. Khallad admits \nbeing aware at the time that Hazmi and Mihdhar were involved in an operation involving planes in the United States \nbut denies knowing details of the plan.  \n\nWhile in Kuala Lumpur, Khallad wanted to go to Singapore to meet Nibras and Fahd al Quso, two of the operatives \nin Nashiri's ship-bombing operation. An attempt to execute that plan by attacking the USS The Sullivans had failed \njust a few days earlier. Nibras and Quso were bringing Khallad money from Yemen, but were stopped in Bangkok \nbecause they lacked visas to continue on to Singapore. Also unable to enter Singapore, Khallad moved the meeting \nto Bangkok. Hazmi and Mihdhar decided to go there as well, reportedly because they thought it would enhance \ntheir cover as tourists to have passport stamps from a popular tourist destination such as Thailand. With Hambali's \nhelp, the three obtained tickets for a flight to Bangkok and left Kuala Lumpur together. Abu Bara did not have a visa \npermitting him to return to Pakistan, so he traveled to Yemen instead.  \n\nIn Bangkok, Khallad took Hazmi and Mihdhar to one hotel, then went to another hotel for his meeting on the \nmaritime attack plan. Hazmi and Mihdhar soon moved to that same hotel, but Khallad insists that the two sets of \noperatives never met with each other or anyone else. After conferring with the ship-bombing operatives, Khallad \nreturned to Karachi and then to Kandahar, where he reported on his casing mission to Bin Ladin.  \n\nBin Ladin canceled the East Asia part of the planes operation in the spring of 2000. He evidently decided it would \nbe too difficult to coordinate this attack with the operation in the United States. As for Hazmi and Mihdhar, they had \nleft Bangkok a few days before Khallad and arrived in Los Angeles on January 15, 2000.  \n\nMeanwhile, the next group of al Qaeda operatives destined for the planes operation had just surfaced in \nAfghanistan. As Hazmi and Mihdhar were deploying from Asia to the United States, al Qaeda's leadership was \nrecruiting and training four Western-educated men who had recently arrived in Kandahar. Though they hailed from \nfour different countries - Egypt, the United Arab\n\nEmirates, Lebanon, and Yemen - they had formed a close-knit group as students in Hamburg, Germany. The new \nrecruits had come to Afghanistan aspiring to wage jihad in Chechnya. But al Qaeda quickly recognized their \npotential and enlisted them in its anti-U. S. jihad.\n\n5. 3 THE HAMBURG CONTINGENT \n\nAlthough Bin Ladin, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the \nplanes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a \nmore attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U. S. fervor of the other candidates for the \noperation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on \nyears that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi \nBinalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy.\n\nMohamed Atta \n\nMohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his \nfather, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta \nworked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had \nmet in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him \nto live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first \ntime in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host \nfamily. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning \ncourse at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall \nof 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist \nfriends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as \nvery intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language.   When Atta arrived \nin Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert \nleadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a \n\n\n\nMuslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in \nHamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, \nhowever, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But\n\namong those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker. Atta's friends during this period remember \nhim as charismatic, intelligent, and persuasive, albeit intolerant of dissent.  \n\nIn his interactions with other students, Atta voiced virulently anti-Semitic and anti-American opinions, ranging from \ncondemnations of what he described as a global Jewish movement centered in New York City that supposedly \ncontrolled the financial world and the media, to polemics against governments of the Arab world. To him, Saddam \nHussein was an American stooge set up to give Washington an excuse to intervene in the Middle East. Within his \ncircle, Atta advocated violent jihad. He reportedly asked one individual close to the group if he was \"ready to fight \nfor [his] belief \" and dismissed him as too weak for jihad when the person declined. On a visit home to Egypt in \n1998, Atta met one of his college friends. According to this friend, Atta had changed a great deal, had grown a \nbeard, and had \"obviously adopted fundamentalism\" by that time.  \n\nRamzi Binalshibh \n\nRamzi Binalshibh was born on May 1, 1972, in Ghayl Bawazir, Yemen. There does not seem to be anything \nremarkable about his family or early background. A friend who knew Binalshibh in Yemen remembers him as \n\"religious, but not too religious. \" From 1987 to 1995, Binalshibh worked as a clerk for the International Bank \nofYemen. He first attempted to leave Yemen in 1995, when he applied for a U. S. visa. After his application was \nrejected, he went to Germany and applied for asylum under the name Ramzi Omar, claiming to be a Sudanese \ncitizen seeking asylum. While his asylum petition was pending, Binalshibh lived in Hamburg and associated with \nindividuals from several mosques there. In 1997, after his asylum application was denied, Binalshibh went home to \nYemen but returned to Germany shortly thereafter under his true name, this time registering as a student in \nHamburg. Binalshibh continually had academic problems, failing tests and cutting classes; he was expelled from \none school in September 1998.  \n\nAccording to Binalshibh, he and Atta first met at a mosque in Hamburg in 1995. The two men became close friends \nand became identified with their shared extremist outlook. Like Atta, by the late 1990s Binalshibh was decrying \nwhat he perceived to be a \"Jewish world conspiracy. \" He proclaimed that the highest duty of every Muslim was to \npursue jihad, and that the highest honor was to die during the jihad. Despite his rhetoric, however, Binalshibh \npresented a more amiable figure than the austere Atta, and was known within the community as being sociable, \nextroverted, polite, and adventuresome.  \n\nIn 1998, Binalshibh and Atta began sharing an apartment in the Harburg section of Hamburg, together with a young \nstudent from the United Arab Emirates named Marwan al Shehhi.  \n\nMarwan al Shehhi \n\nMarwan al Shehhi was born on May 9, 1978, in Ras al Khaimah, the United Arab Emirates. His father, who died in \n1997, was a prayer leader at the local mosque. After graduating from high school in 1995, Shehhi joined the Emirati \nmilitary and received half a year of basic training before gaining admission to a military scholarship program that \nwould fund his continued study in Germany.  \n\nShehhi first entered Germany in April 1996. After sharing an apartment in Bonn for two months with three other \nscholarship students, Shehhi moved in with a German family, with whom he resided for several months before \nmoving into his own apartment. During this period, he came across as very religious, praying five times a day. \nFriends also remember him as convivial and \"a regular guy, \"wearing Western clothes and occasionally renting \ncars for trips to Berlin, France, and the Netherlands.  \n\nAs a student, Shehhi was less than a success. Upon completing a course in German, he enrolled at the University \nof Bonn in a program for technical, mathematical, and scientific studies. In June 1997, he requested a leave from \nhis studies, citing the need to attend to unspecified \"problems\" in his home country. Although the university denied \n\n\n\nhis request, Shehhi left anyway, and consequently was compelled to repeat the first semester of his studies. In \naddition to having academic difficulties at this time, Shehhi appeared to become more extreme in the practice of his \nfaith; for example, he specifically avoided restaurants that cooked with or served alcohol. In late 1997, he applied \nfor permission to complete his course work in Hamburg, a request apparently motivated by his desire to join Atta \nand Binalshibh. Just how and when the three of them first met remains unclear, although they seemed to know \neach other already when Shehhi relocated to Hamburg in early 1998. Atta and Binalshibh moved into his apartment \nin April.  \n\nThe transfer to Hamburg did not help Shehhi's academic progress; he was directed by the scholarship program \nadministrators at the Emirati embassy to repeat his second semester starting in August 1998, but back in Bonn. \nShehhi initially flouted this directive, however, and did not reenroll at the University of Bonn until the following \nJanuary, barely passing his course there. By the end of July 1999, he had returned to Hamburg, applying to study \nshipbuilding at the Technical University and, more significantly, residing once again with Atta and Binalshibh, in an \napartment at 54 Marienstrasse.  \n\nAfter Shehhi moved in with Atta and Binalshibh, his evolution toward Islamic fundamentalism became more \npronounced. A fellow Emirati student who came to Hamburg to visit Shehhi noticed he no longer lived as \ncomfortably as before. Shehhi now occupied an old apartment with a roommate, had no television, and wore \ninexpensive clothes. When asked why he was living so frugally, Shehhi responded that he was living the way the \nProphet had lived.   Similarly, when someone asked why he and Atta never laughed, Shehhi retorted, \"How can you \nlaugh when people are dying in Palestine? \"  \n\nZiad Jarrah \n\nBorn on May 11, 1975, in Mazraa, Lebanon, Ziad Jarrah came from an affluent family and attended private, \nChristian schools. Like Atta, Binalshibh, and Shehhi, Jarrah aspired to pursue higher education in Germany. In April \n1996, he and a cousin enrolled at a junior college in Greifswald, in northeastern Germany. There Jarrah met and \nbecame intimate with Aysel Senguen, the daughter of Turkish immigrants, who was preparing to study dentistry.  \n\nEven with the benefit of hindsight, Jarrah hardly seems a likely candidate for becoming an Islamic extremist. Far \nfrom displaying radical beliefs when he first moved to Germany, he arrived with a reputation for knowing where to \nfind the best discos and beaches in Beirut, and in Greifswald was known to enjoy student parties and drinking beer. \nAlthough he continued to share an apartment in Greifswald with his cousin, Jarrah was mostly at Senguen's \napartment. Witnesses interviewed by German authorities after 9/11, however, recall that Jarrah started showing \nsigns of radicalization as early as the end of 1996. After returning from a trip home to Lebanon, Jarrah started living \nmore strictly according to the Koran. He read brochures in Arabic about jihad, held forth to friends on the subject of \nholy war, and professed disaffection with his previous life and a desire not to leave the world \"in a natural way. \"  \n\nIn September 1997, Jarrah abruptly switched his intended course of study from dentistry to aircraft engineering - at \nthe Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg. His motivation for this decision remains unclear. The rationale he \nexpressed to Senguen - that he had been interested in aviation since playing with toy airplanes as a child - rings \nsomewhat hollow. In any event, Jarrah appears already to have had Hamburg contacts by this time, some of whom \nmay have played a role in steering him toward Islamic extremism.  \n\nFollowing his move to Hamburg that fall, he began visiting Senguen in Greifswald on weekends, until she moved to \nthe German city of Bochum one year later to enroll in dental school. Around the same time, he began speaking \nincreasingly about religion, and his visits to Senguen became less and less frequent. He began criticizing her for not \nbeing religious enough and for dressing too provocatively. He grew a full beard and started praying regularly. He \nrefused to introduce her to his Hamburg friends because, he told her, they were religious Muslims and her refusal \nto become more observant embarrassed him. At some point in 1999, Jarrah told Senguen that he was planning to \nwage a jihad because there was no greater honor than to die for Allah. Although Jarrah's transformation generated \nnumerous quarrels, their breakups invariably were followed by reconciliation.  \n\nForming a Cell \n\n\n\nIn Hamburg, Jarrah had a succession of living accommodations, but he apparently never resided with his future co-\nconspirators. It is not clear how and when he became part of Atta's circle. He became particularly friendly with \nBinalshibh after meeting him at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, which Jarrah\n\nbegan attending regularly in late 1997. The worshippers at this mosque featured an outspoken, flamboyant Islamist \nnamed Mohammed Haydar Zammar. A well-known figure in the Muslim community (and to German and U. S. \nintelligence agencies by the late 1990s), Zammar had fought in Afghanistan and relished any opportunity to extol \nthe virtues of violent jihad. Indeed, a witness has reported hearing Zammar press Binalshibh to fulfill his duty to \nwage jihad. Moreover, after 9/11, Zammar reportedly took credit for influencing not just Binalshibh but the rest of the \nHamburg group. In 1998, Zammar encouraged them to participate in jihad and even convinced them to go to \nAfghanistan.  \n\nOwing to Zammar's persuasion or some other source of inspiration, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah eventually \nprepared themselves to translate their extremist beliefs into action. By late 1999, they were ready to abandon their \nstudent lives in Germany in favor of violent jihad. This final stage in their evolution toward embracing Islamist \nextremism did not entirely escape the notice of the people around them. The foursome became core members of a \ngroup of radical Muslims, often hosting sessions at their Marienstrasse apartment that involved extremely anti-\nAmerican discussions. Meeting three to four times a week, the group became something of a \"sect\" whose \nmembers, according to one participant in the meetings, tended to deal only with each other.   Atta's rent checks for \nthe apartment provide evidence of the importance that the apartment assumed as a center for the group, as he \nwould write on them the notation \"Dar el Ansar, \" or \"house of the followers. \"  \n\nIn addition to Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah, the group included other extremists, some of whom also would \nattend al Qaeda training camps and, in some instances, would help the 9/11 hijackers as they executed the plot:\n\n     *  Said Bahaji, son of a Moroccan immigrant, was the only German\n\n        citizen in the group. Educated in Morocco, Bahaji returned to\n\n        Germany to study electrical engineering at the Technical University\n\n        of Hamburg-Harburg. He spent five months in the German army before\n\n        obtaining a medical discharge, and lived with Atta and Binalshibh\n\n        at 54 Marienstrasse for eight months between November 1998 and July\n\n        1999. Described as an insecure follower with no personality and\n\n        with limited knowledge of Islam, Bahaji nonetheless professed his\n\n        readiness to engage in violence. Atta and Binalshibh used Bahaji's\n\n        computer for Internet research, as evidenced by documents and\n\n        diskettes seized by German authorities after 9/11.\n\n     *  Zakariya Essabar, a Moroccan citizen, moved to Germany in February\n\n        1997 and to Hamburg in 1998, where he studied medical technology.\n\n        Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others\n\n        through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly,\n\n        probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with\n\n        physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and\n\n     *  compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to\n\n        have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this\n\n        lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to\n\n        Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda\n\n\n\n        leadership.\n\n     *  Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993,\n\n        moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering\n\n        at the Technical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq\n\n        saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious\n\n        beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him\n\n        referring to Hitler as a \"good man\" and organizing film sessions\n\n        that included speeches by Bin Ladin. Motassadeq would help conceal\n\n        the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999.\n\n     *  Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the\n\n        summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and\n\n        chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before\n\n        moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak\n\n        Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he\n\n        was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed\n\n        the execution of Atta's will.\n\nDuring the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to \nconceal the content of their conversations.   When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to \njourney to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no \nevidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their \npronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States.   In short, \nthey fit the bill for Bin Ladin, Atef, and KSM.\n\nGoing to Afghanistan \n\nThe available evidence indicates that in 1999, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah decided to fight in Chechnya \nagainst the Russians. According to Binalshibh, a chance meeting on a train in Germany caused the group to travel \nto Afghanistan instead. An individual named Khalid al Masri approached Binalshibh and Shehhi (because they were \nArabs with beards, Binalshibh thinks) and struck up a conversation about jihad in Chechnya. When they later called \nMasri and expressed interest in going to Chechnya, he told them to contact Abu Musab in Duisburg, Germany. Abu \nMusab turned out to be Mohamedou Ould Slahi, a significant al Qaeda operative who, even then, was well known \nto U. S. and German intelligence, though neither government apparently knew he was operating in Germany in late \n1999. When telephoned by Binalshibh and Shehhi, Slahi reportedly invited these promising recruits to come see \nhim in Duisburg.  \n\nBinalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah made the trip. When they arrived, Slahi\n\nexplained that it was difficult to get to Chechnya at that time because many travelers were being detained in \nGeorgia. He recommended they go to Afghanistan instead, where they could train for jihad before traveling onward \nto Chechnya. Slahi instructed them to obtain Pakistani visas and then return to him for further directions on how to \nreach Afghanistan. Although Atta did not attend the meeting, he joined in the plan with the other three. After \nobtaining the necessary visas, they received Slahi's final instructions on how to travel to Karachi and then Quetta, \nwhere they were to contact someone named Umar al Masri at the Taliban office.  \n\nFollowing Slahi's advice, Atta and Jarrah left Hamburg during the last week of November 1999, bound for Karachi. \nShehhi left for Afghanistan around the same time; Binalshibh, about two weeks later. Binalshibh remembers that \nwhen he arrived at the Taliban office in Quetta, there was no one named Umar al Masri. The name, apparently, was \n\n\n\nsimply a code; a group of Afghans from the office promptly escorted him to Kandahar. There Binalshibh rejoined \nAtta and Jarrah, who said they already had pledged loyalty to Bin Ladin and urged him to do the same. They also \ninformed him that Shehhi had pledged as well and had already left for the United Arab Emirates to prepare for the \nmission. Binalshibh soon met privately with Bin Ladin, accepted the al Qaeda leader's invitation to work under him, \nand added his own pledge to those of his Hamburg colleagues. By this time, Binalshibh claims, he assumed he was \nvolunteering for a martyrdom operation.  \n\nAtta, Jarrah, and Binalshibh then met with Atef, who told them they were about to undertake a highly secret \nmission. As Binalshibh tells it, Atef instructed the three to return to Germany and enroll in flight training. Atta - whom \nBin Ladin chose to lead the group - met with Bin Ladin several times to receive additional instructions, including a \npreliminary list of approved targets: the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and the U. S. Capitol.   The new recruits \nalso learned that an individual named Rabia al Makki (Nawaf al Hazmi) would be part of the operation.  \n\nIn retrospect, the speed with which Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh became core members of the 9/11 plot - \nwith Atta designated its operational leader - is remarkable. They had not yet met with KSM when all this occurred. It \nis clear, then, that Bin Ladin and Atef were very much in charge of the operation. That these candidates were \nselected so quickly - before comprehensive testing in the training camps or in operations - demonstrates that Bin \nLadin and Atef probably already understood the deficiencies of their initial team, Hazmi and Mihdhar. The new \nrecruits from Germany possessed an ideal combination of technical skill and knowledge that the original 9/11 \noperatives, veteran fighters though they were, lacked. Bin Ladin and Atef wasted no time in assigning the Hamburg \ngroup to the most ambitious operation yet planned by al Qaeda.\n\nBin Ladin and Atef also plainly judged that Atta was best suited to be the\n\ntactical commander of the operation. Such a quick and critical judgment invites speculation about whether they had \nalready taken Atta's measure at some earlier meeting. To be sure, some gaps do appear in the record of Atta's \nknown whereabouts during the preceding years. One such gap is February-March 1998, a period for which there is \nno evidence of his presence in Germany and when he conceivably could have been in Afghanistan.   Yet to date, \nneither KSM, Binalshibh, nor any other al Qaeda figure interrogated about the 9/11 plot has claimed that Atta or any \nother member of the Hamburg group traveled to Afghanistan before the trip in late 1999.\n\nWhile the four core Hamburg cell members were in Afghanistan, their associates back in Hamburg handled their \naffairs so that their trip could be kept secret. Motassadeq appears to have done the most. He terminated Shehhi's \napartment lease, telling the landlord that Shehhi had returned to the UAE for family reasons, and used a power of \nattorney to pay bills from Shehhi's bank account.   Motassadeq also assisted Jarrah, offering to look after Aysel \nSenguen in Jarrah's absence. Said Bahaji attended to similar routine matters for Atta and Binalshibh, thereby \nhelping them remain abroad without drawing attention to their absence.  \n\nPreparing for the Operation \n\nIn early 2000, Atta, Jarrah, and Binalshibh returned to Hamburg. Jarrah arrived first, on January 31, 2000.   \nAccording to Binalshibh, he and Atta left Kandahar together and proceeded first to Karachi, where they met KSM \nand were instructed by him on security and on living in the United States. Shehhi apparently had already met with \nKSM before returning to the UAE. Atta returned to Hamburg in late February, and Binalshibh arrived shortly \nthereafter. Shehhi's travels took him to the UAE (where he acquired a new passport and a U. S. visa), Saudi Arabia, \nBahrain, and one or more other destinations. Shehhi also returned to Germany, possibly sometime in March.  \n\nAfter leaving Afghanistan, the hijackers made clear efforts to avoid appearing radical. Once back in Hamburg, they \ndistanced themselves from conspicuous extremists like Zammar, whom they knew attracted unwanted attention \nfrom the authorities.   They also changed their appearance and behavior. Atta wore Western clothing, shaved his \nbeard, and no longer attended extremist mosques. Jarrah also no longer wore a full beard and, according to \nSenguen, acted much more the way he had when she first met him. And when Shehhi, while still in the UAE in \nJanuary 2000, held a belated wedding celebration (he actually had been married in 1999), a friend of his was \nsurprised to see that he had shaved off his beard and was acting like his old self again.  \n\n\n\nBut Jarrah's apparent efforts to appear less radical did not completely conceal his transformation from his Lebanese \nfamily, which grew increasingly concerned about his fanaticism. Soon after Jarrah returned to Germany, his father \nasked Jarrah's cousin - a close companion from boyhood - to intercede. The\n\ncousin's ensuing effort to persuade Jarrah to depart from \"the path he was taking\" proved unavailing.   Yet Jarrah \nclearly differed from the other hijackers in that he maintained much closer contact with his family and continued his \nintimate relationship with Senguen. These ties may well have caused him to harbor some doubts about going \nthrough with the plot, even as late as the summer of 2001, as discussed in chapter 7.\n\nAfter leaving Afghanistan, the four began researching flight schools and aviation training. In early January 2000, Ali \nAbdul Aziz Ali - a nephew of KSM living in the UAE who would become an important facilitator in the plot - used \nShehhi's credit card to order a Boeing 747-400 flight simulator program and a Boeing 767 flight deck video, together \nwith attendant literature;Ali had all these items shipped to his employer's address. Jarrah soon decided that the \nschools in Germany were not acceptable and that he would have to learn to fly in the United States. Binalshibh also \nresearched flight schools in Europe, and in the Netherlands he met a flight school director who recommended flight \nschools in the United States because they were less expensive and required shorter training periods.  \n\nIn March 2000, Atta emailed 31 different U. S. flight schools on behalf of a small group of men from various Arab \ncountries studying in Germany who, while lacking prior training, were interested in learning to fly in the United \nStates. Atta requested information about the cost of the training, potential financing, and accommodations.  \n\nBefore seeking visas to enter the United States, Atta, Shehhi, and Jarrah obtained new passports, each claiming \nthat his old passport had been lost. Presumably they were concerned that the Pakistani visas in their old passports \nwould raise suspicions about possible travel to Afghanistan. Shehhi obtained his visa on January 18, 2000; Atta, on \nMay 18; and Jarrah, on May 25.   Binalshibh's visa request was rejected, however, as were his three subsequent \napplications.   Binalshibh proved unable to obtain a visa, a victim of the generalized suspicion that visa applicants \nfrom Yemen - especially young men applying in another country (Binalshibh first applied in Berlin) - might join the \nranks of undocumented aliens seeking work in the United States. Before 9/11, security concerns were not a major \nfactor in visa issuance unless the applicant already was on a terrorist watchlist, and none of these four men was. \nConcerns that Binalshibh intended to immigrate to the United States doomed his chances to participate firsthand in \nthe 9/11 attacks. Although Binalshibh had to remain behind, he would provide critical assistance from abroad to his \nco-conspirators.\n\nOnce again, the need for travel documents dictated al Qaeda's plans.\n\nTravel \n\nIt should by now be apparent how significant travel was in the planning undertaken by a terrorist organization as far-\nflung as al Qaeda. The story of the plot includes references to dozens of international trips. Operations required \ntravel,\n\nas did basic communications and the movement of money. Where electronic communications were regarded as \ninsecure, al Qaeda relied even more heavily on couriers.\n\nKSM and Abu Zubaydah each played key roles in facilitating travel for al Qaeda operatives. In addition, al Qaeda \nhad an office of passports and host country issues under its security committee. The office was located at the \nKandahar airport and was managed by Atef. The committee altered papers, including passports, visas, and \nidentification cards.  \n\nMoreover, certain al Qaeda members were charged with organizing passport collection schemes to keep the \npipeline of fraudulent documents flowing. To this end, al Qaeda required jihadists to turn in their passports before \ngoing to the front lines in Afghanistan. If they were killed, their passports were recycled for use.   The operational \nmission training course taught operatives how to forge documents. Certain passport alteration methods, which \nincluded substituting photos and erasing and adding travel cachets, were also taught. Manuals demonstrating the \ntechnique for \"cleaning\" visas were reportedly circulated among operatives. Mohamed Atta and Zakariya Essabar \nwere reported to have been trained in passport alteration.  \n\n\n\nThe purpose of all this training was twofold: to develop an institutional capacity for document forgery and to enable \noperatives to make necessary adjustments in the field. It was well-known, for example, that if a Saudi traveled to \nAfghanistan via Pakistan, then on his return to Saudi Arabia his passport, bearing a Pakistani stamp, would be \nconfiscated. So operatives either erased the Pakistani visas from their passports or traveled through Iran, which did \nnot stamp visas directly into passports.  \n\n5. 4 A MONEY TRAIL? \n\nBin Ladin and his aides did not need a very large sum to finance their planned attack on America. The 9/11 plotters \neventually spent somewhere between $400, 000 and $500, 000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with \nthe importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money \nthey needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, \nbut it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection \nmechanisms in place at the time.   The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of \nhow al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11.\n\nGeneral Financing \n\nAs we explained in chapter 2, Bin Ladin did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of \nbusinesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA\n\nnow estimates that it cost al Qaeda about $30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this \nmoney was raised almost entirely through donations.  \n\nFor many years, the United States thought Bin Ladin financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal \ninheritance. Bin Ladin purportedly inherited approximately $300 million when his father died, and was rumored to \nhave had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position \nin al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U. S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994, Bin \nLadin received about $1 million per year - a significant sum, to be sure, but not a $300 million fortune that could be \nused to fund jihad.   Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the Bin Ladin family was \nforced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze \nthe proceeds of the sale. This action had the effect of divesting Bin Ladin of what otherwise might indeed have been \na large fortune.  \n\nNor were Bin Ladin's assets in Sudan a source of money for al Qaeda. When Bin Ladin lived in Sudan from 1991 to \n1996, he owned a number of businesses and other assets. These could not have provided significant income, as \nmost were small or not economically viable. When Bin Ladin left in 1996, it appears that the Sudanese government \nexpropriated all his assets: he left Sudan with practically nothing. When Bin Ladin arrived in Afghanistan, he relied \non the Taliban until he was able to reinvigorate his fund-raising efforts by drawing on ties to wealthy Saudi \nindividuals that he had established during the Afghan war in the 1980s.  \n\nAl Qaeda appears to have relied on a core group of financial facilitators who raised money from a variety of donors \nand other fund-raisers, primarily in the Gulf countries and particularly in Saudi Arabia.   Some individual donors \nsurely knew, and others did not, the ultimate destination of their donations. Al Qaeda and its friends took \nadvantage of Islam's strong calls for charitable giving, zakat . These financial facilitators also appeared to rely \nheavily on certain imams at mosques who were willing to divert zakat donations to al Qaeda's cause.  \n\nAl Qaeda also collected money from employees of corrupt charities.   It took two approaches to using charities for \nfund-raising. One was to rely on al Qaeda sympathizers in specific foreign branch offices of large, international \ncharities - particularly those with lax external oversight and ineffective internal controls, such as the Saudi-based al \nHaramain Islamic Foundation.   Smaller charities in various parts of the globe were funded by these large Gulf \ncharities and had employees who would siphon the money to al Qaeda.  \n\nIn addition, entire charities, such as the al Wafa organization, may have wittingly participated in funneling money to \nal Qaeda. In those cases, al Qaeda operatives controlled the entire organization, including access to bank\n\n\n\naccounts.   Charities were a source of money and also provided significant cover, which enabled operatives to \ntravel undetected under the guise of working for a humanitarian organization.\n\nIt does not appear that any government other than the Taliban financially supported al Qaeda before 9/11, although \nsome governments may have contained al Qaeda sympathizers who turned a blind eye to al Qaeda's fundraising \nactivities.   Saudi Arabia has long been considered the primary source of al Qaeda funding, but we have found no \nevidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded the organization. \n(This conclusion does not exclude the likelihood that charities with significant Saudi government sponsorship \ndiverted funds to al Qaeda. )  \n\nStill, al Qaeda found fertile fund-raising ground in Saudi Arabia, where extreme religious views are common and \ncharitable giving was both essential to the culture and subject to very limited oversight.   Al Qaeda also sought \nmoney from wealthy donors in other Gulf states.\n\nAl Qaeda frequently moved the money it raised by hawala , an informal and ancient trust-based system for \ntransferring funds.   In some ways, al Qaeda had no choice after its move to Afghanistan in 1996: first, the banking \nsystem there was antiquated and undependable; and second, formal banking was risky due to the scrutiny that al \nQaeda received after the August 1998 East Africa embassy bombings, including UN resolutions against it and the \nTaliban.   Bin Ladin relied on the established hawala networks operating in Pakistan, in Dubai, and throughout the \nMiddle East to transfer funds efficiently. Hawaladars associated with al Qaeda may have used banks to move and \nstore money, as did various al Qaeda fund-raisers and operatives outside of Afghanistan, but there is little evidence \nthat Bin Ladin or core al Qaeda members used banks while in Afghanistan.  \n\nBefore 9/11, al Qaeda spent funds as quickly as it received them. Actual terrorist operations represented a relatively \nsmall part of al Qaeda's estimated $30 million annual operating budget. Al Qaeda funded salaries for jihadists, \ntraining camps, airfields, vehicles, arms, and the development of training manuals. Bin Ladin provided \napproximately $10-$20 million per year to the Taliban in return for safe haven. Bin Ladin also may have used \nmoney to create alliances with other terrorist organizations, although it is unlikely that al Qaeda was funding an \noverall jihad program. Rather, Bin Ladin selectively provided startup funds to new groups or money for specific \nterrorist operations.  \n\nAl Qaeda has been alleged to have used a variety of illegitimate means, particularly drug trafficking and conflict \ndiamonds, to finance itself. While the drug trade was a source of income for the Taliban, it did not serve the same \npurpose for al Qaeda, and there is no reliable evidence that Bin Ladin was involved in or made his money through \ndrug trafficking.   Similarly, we have seen no persuasive evidence that al Qaeda funded itself by trading in African \nconflict diamonds.   There also have been claims that al Qaeda financed itself through\n\nmanipulation of the stock market based on its advance knowledge of the 9/11 attacks. Exhaustive investigations by \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, FBI, and other agencies have uncovered no evidence that anyone with \nadvance knowledge of the attacks profited through securities transactions.  \n\nTo date, the U. S. government has not been able to determine the origin of the money used for the 9/11 attacks. \nUltimately the question is of little practical significance. Al Qaeda had many avenues of funding. If a particular \nfunding source had dried up, al Qaeda could have easily tapped a different source or diverted funds from another \nproject to fund an operation that cost $400, 000-$500, 000 over nearly two years.\n\nThe Funding of the 9/11 Plot \n\nAs noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between $400, 000 and $500, 000 to plan and conduct their \nattack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire \ntransfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and \naccessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United \nStates gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign \ngovernment - or foreign government official - supplied any funding.  \n\nWe have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds \nfrom al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot \n\n\n\nfacilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as $10, 000, to perform \ntheir roles in the plot.  \n\nAfter the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the \nfunding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the \nHamburg cell members each received $5, 000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had \nbeen selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. \nFinancial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7.\n\nRequirements for a Successful Attack \n\nAs some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on \nwhat they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to \ninflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included\n\n     *  leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and\n\n        direction of the operation;\n\n     *  communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the\n\n        operatives and those who would be helping them;\n\n     *  a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them,\n\n        indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training;\n\n     *  an intelligence effort to gather required information and form\n\n        assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses;\n\n     *  the ability to move people; and\n\n     *  the ability to raise and move the necessary money.\n\nThe information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and \nsummer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements.\n\nBy late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the \nfour Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.\n\n6 FROM THREAT TO THREAT \n\nIn chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U. S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to \naddress the emerging threat from Usama Bin Ladin and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the \nAmerican embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting Bin \nLadin expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the \nworld had achieved some successes, the core of Bin Ladin's organization remained intact.\n\nPresident Clinton was deeply concerned about Bin Ladin. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \"Sandy\" \nBerger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on Bin Ladin's reported \nlocation.   In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training \ncamps but saying little about Bin Ladin and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate - \nintended to avoid enhancing Bin Ladin's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused \nespecially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons.  \n\nAs the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer \nbreakdowns - the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of \nsuch breakdowns.  \n\n\n\n6. 1 THE MILLENNIUM CRISIS\n\n\"Bodies Will Pile Up in Sacks\"\n\nOn November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally \nof Bin Ladin, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \"The time for training is over. \" \nSuspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist\n\noperation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington.  \n\nOne of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the \nMiddle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his \nway to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He \nand his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American \ntargets in Jordan.  \n\nAfter late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a \ncabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between \nBoston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited in Turkey and Syria as well as \nJordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training.  \n\nIn late 1998, Hijazi and Abu Hoshar had settled on a plan. They would first attack four targets: the SAS Radisson \nHotel in downtown Amman, the border crossings from Jordan into Israel, and two Christian holy sites, at a time \nwhen all these locations were likely to be thronged with American and other tourists. Next, they would target a local \nairport and other religious and cultural sites. Hijazi and Abu Hoshar cased the intended targets and sent reports to \nAbu Zubaydah, who approved their plan. Finally, back in Amman from Boston, Hijazi gradually accumulated bomb-\nmaking materials, including sulfuric acid and 5, 200 pounds of nitric acid, which were then stored in an enormous \nsubbasement dug by the plotters over a period of two months underneath a rented house.  \n\nIn early 1999, Hijazi and Abu Hoshar contacted Khalil Deek, an American citizen and an associate of Abu \nZubaydah who lived in Peshawar, Pakistan, and who, with Afghanistan-based extremists, had created an electronic \nversion of a terrorist manual, the Encyclopedia of Jihad . They obtained a CD-ROM of this encyclopedia from Deek.   \nIn June, with help from Deek, Abu Hoshar arranged with Abu Zubaydah for Hijazi and three others to go to \nAfghanistan for added training in handling explosives. In late November 1999, Hijazi reportedly swore before Abu \nZubaydah the bayat to Bin Ladin, committing himself to do anything Bin Ladin ordered. He then departed for Jordan \nand was at a waypoint in Syria when Abu Zubaydah sent Abu Hoshar the message that prompted Jordanian \nauthorities to roll up the whole cell.  \n\nAfter the arrests of Abu Hoshar and 15 others, the Jordanians tracked Deek to Peshawar, persuaded Pakistan to \nextradite him, and added him to their catch. Searches in Amman found the rented house and, among other things, \n71 drums of acids, several forged Saudi passports, detonators, and Deek's Encyclopedia . Six of the accomplices \nwere sentenced to death. In custody, Hijazi's younger brother said that the group's motto had been \"The season is \ncoming, and bodies will pile up in sacks. \"  \n\nDiplomacy and Disruption \n\nOn December 4, as news came in about the discoveries in Jordan, National Security Council (NSC) \nCounterterrorism Coordinator Richard Clarke wrote Berger, \"If George's [Tenet's] story about a planned series of \nUBL attacks at the Millennium is true, we will need to make some decisions NOW. \" He told us he held several \nconversations with President Clinton during the crisis. He suggested threatening reprisals against the Taliban in \nAfghanistan in the event of any attacks on U. S. interests, anywhere, by Bin Ladin. He further proposed to Berger \nthat a strike be made during the last week of 1999 against al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan - a proposal not adopted.  \n\nWarned by the CIA that the disrupted Jordanian plot was probably part of a larger series of attacks intended for the \nmillennium, some possibly involving chemical weapons, the Principals Committee met on the night of December 8 \n\n\n\nand decided to task Clarke's Counterterrorism Security Group (CSG) to develop plans to deter and disrupt al Qaeda \nplots.  \n\nMichael Sheehan, the State Department member of the CSG, communicated warnings to the Taliban that they \nwould be held responsible for future al Qaeda attacks. \"Mike was not diplomatic, \" Clarke reported to Berger. With \nvirtually no evidence of a Taliban response, a new approach was made to Pakistan.   General Anthony Zinni, the \ncommander of Central Command (CENTCOM), was designated as the President's special envoy and sent to ask \nGeneral Musharraf to \"take whatever action you deem necessary to resolve the Bin Laden problem at the earliest \npossible time. \" But Zinni came back emptyhanded. As Ambassador William Milam reported from Islamabad, \nMusharraf was \"unwilling to take the political heat at home. \"  \n\nThe CIA worked hard with foreign security services to detain or at least keep an eye on suspected Bin Ladin \nassociates. Tenet spoke to 20 of his foreign counterparts. Disruption and arrest operations were mounted against \nterrorists in eight countries.   In mid-December, President Clinton signed a Memorandum of Notification (MON) \ngiving the CIA broader authority to use foreign proxies to detain Bin Ladin lieutenants, without having to transfer \nthem to U. S. custody. The authority was to capture, not kill, though lethal force might be used if necessary.   Tenet \nwould later send a message to all CIA personnel overseas, saying, \"The threat could not be more real. . . . Do \nwhatever is necessary to disrupt UBL's plans. . . . The American people are counting on you and me to take every \nappropriate step to protect them during this period. \"The State Department issued a worldwide threat advisory to its \nposts overseas.  \n\nThen, on December 14, an Algerian jihadist was caught bringing a load of explosives into the United States.\n\nRessam's Arrest \n\nAhmed Ressam, 23, had illegally immigrated to Canada in 1994. Using a falsified passport and a bogus story about \npersecution in Algeria, Ressam entered\n\nMontreal and claimed political asylum. For the next few years he supported himself with petty crime. Recruited by \nan alumnus of Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp, Ressam trained in Afghanistan in 1998, learning, among other \nthings, how to place cyanide near the air intake of a building to achieve maximum lethality at minimum personal \nrisk. Having joined other Algerians in planning a possible attack on a U. S. airport or consulate, Ressam left \nAfghanistan in early 1999 carrying precursor chemicals for explosives disguised in toiletry bottles, a notebook \ncontaining bomb assembly instructions, and $12, 000. Back in Canada, he went about procuring weapons, \nchemicals, and false papers.  \n\nIn early summer 1999, having learned that not all of his colleagues could get the travel documents to enter Canada, \nRessam decided to carry out the plan alone. By the end of the summer he had chosen three Los Angeles-area \nairports as potential targets, ultimately fixing on Los Angeles International (LAX) as the largest and easiest to \noperate in surreptitiously. He bought or stole chemicals and equipment for his bomb, obtaining advice from three \nAlgerian friends, all of whom were wanted by authorities in France for their roles in past terrorist attacks there. \nRessam also acquired new confederates. He promised to help a New York-based partner, Abdelghani Meskini, get \ntraining in Afghanistan if Meskini would help him maneuver in the United States.  \n\nIn December 1999, Ressam began his final preparations. He called an Afghanistan-based facilitator to inquire into \nwhether Bin Ladin wanted to take credit for the attack, but he did not get a reply. He spent a week in Vancouver \npreparing the explosive components with a close friend. The chemicals were so caustic that the men kept their \nwindows open, despite the freezing temperatures outside, and sucked on cough drops to soothe their irritated \nthroats.   While in Vancouver, Ressam also rented a Chrysler sedan for his travel into the United States, and \npacked the explosives in the trunk's spare tire well.  \n\nOn December 14, 1999, Ressam drove his rental car onto the ferry from Victoria, Canada, to Port Angeles, \nWashington. Ressam planned to drive to Seattle and meet Meskini, with whom he would travel to Los Angeles and \ncase\n\nLAX. They planned to detonate the bomb on or around January 1, 2000. At the Immigration and Naturalization \nService (INS) preinspection station in Victoria, Ressam presented officials with his genuine but fraudulently \n\n\n\nobtained Canadian passport, from which he had torn the Afghanistan entry and exit stamps. The INS agent on duty \nran the passport through a variety of databases but, since it was not in Ressam's name, he did not pick up the \npending Canadian arrest warrants. After a cursory examination of Ressam's car, the INS agents allowed Ressam \nto board the ferry.  \n\nLa, Ressam arrived in Port Angeles. He waited for all the other cars to depart the ferry, assuming (incorrectly) that \nthe last car off would draw less scrutiny. Customs officers assigned to the port, noticing Ressam's nervousness, \nreferred him to secondary inspection. When asked for additional identification, Ressam handed the Customs agent \na Price Costco membership card in the same false name as his passport. As that agent began an initial pat-down, \nRessam panicked and tried to run away.  \n\nInspectors examining Ressam's rental car found the explosives concealed in the spare tire well, but at first they \nassumed the white powder and viscous liquid were drug-related - until an inspector pried apart and identified one of \nthe four timing devices concealed within black boxes. Ressam was placed under arrest. Investigators guessed his \ntarget was in Seattle. They did not learn about the Los Angeles airport planning until they reexamined evidence \nseized in Montreal in 2000; they obtained further details when Ressam began cooperating in May 2001.  \n\nEmergency Cooperation \n\nAfter the disruption of the plot in Amman, it had not escaped notice in Washington that Hijazi had lived in California \nand driven a cab in Boston and that Deek was a naturalized U. S. citizen who, as Berger reminded President \nClinton, had been in touch with extremists in the United States as well as abroad.   Before Ressam's arrest, Berger \nsaw no need to raise a public alarm at home - although the FBI put all field offices on alert.  \n\nNow, following Ressam's arrest, the FBI asked for an unprecedented number of special wiretaps. Both Berger and \nTenet told us that their impression was that more Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) wiretap requests \nwere processed during the millennium alert than ever before.  \n\nThe next day, writing about Ressam's arrest and links to a cell in Montreal, Berger informed the President that the \nFBI would advise police in the United States to step up activities but would still try to avoid undue public alarm by \nstressing that the government had no specific information about planned attacks.  \n\nAt a December 22 meeting of the Small Group of principals, FBI Director Louis Freeh briefed officials from the NSC \nstaff, CIA, and Justice on wiretaps and investigations inside the United States, including a Brooklyn entity tied to the \nRessam arrest, a seemingly unreliable foreign report of possible attacks on seven U. S. cities, two Algerians \ndetained on the Canadian border, and searches in Montreal related to a jihadist cell. The Justice Department \nreleased a statement on the alert the same day.  \n\nClarke's staff warned, \" Foreign terrorist sleeper cells are present in the US and attacks in the US are likely . \"   \nClarke asked Berger to try to make sure that the domestic agencies remained alert. \"Is there a threat to civilian \naircraft? \"he wrote. Clarke also asked the principals in late December to discuss a foreign security service report \nabout a Bin Ladin plan to put bombs on transatlantic flights.  \n\nThe CSG met daily. Berger said that the principals met constantly.   Later, when asked what made her decide to \nask Ressam to step out of his vehicle, Diana Dean, a Customs inspector who referred Ressam to secondary \ninspection, testified that it was her \"training and experience. \"   It appears that the heightened sense of alert at the \nnational level played no role in Ressam's detention.\n\nThere was a mounting sense of public alarm. The earlier Jordanian arrests had been covered in the press, and \nRessam's arrest was featured on network evening news broadcasts throughout the Christmas season.  \n\nThe FBI was more communicative during the millennium crisis than it had ever been. The senior FBI official for \ncounterterrorism, Dale Watson, was a regular member of the CSG, and Clarke had good relations both with him \nand with some of the FBI agents handling al Qaeda-related investigations, including John O'Neill in New York. As a \nrule, however, neither Watson nor these agents brought much information to the group. The FBI simply did not \nproduce the kind of intelligence reports that other agencies routinely wrote and disseminated. As law enforcement \n\n\n\nofficers, Bureau agents tended to write up only witness interviews. Written case analysis usually occurred only in \nmemoranda to supervisors requesting authority to initiate or expand an investigation.  \n\nBut during the millennium alert, with its direct links into the United States from Hijazi, Deek, and Ressam, FBI \nofficials were briefing in person about ongoing investigations, not relying on the dissemination of written reports. \nBerger told us that it was hard for FBI officials to hold back information in front of a cabinet-rank group. After the \nalert, according to Berger and members of the NSC staff, the FBI returned to its normal practice of withholding \nwritten reports and saying little about investigations or witness interviews, taking the position that any information \nrelated to pending investigations might be presented to a grand jury and hence could not be disclosed under \nthenprevailing federal law.  \n\nThe terrorist plots that were broken up at the end of 1999 display the variety of operations that might be attributed, \nhowever indirectly, to al Qaeda. The Jordanian cell was a loose affiliate; we now know that it sought approval and \ntraining from Afghanistan, and at least one key member swore loyalty to Bin Ladin. But the cell's plans and \npreparations were autonomous. Ressam's ties to al Qaeda were even looser. Though he had been recruited, \ntrained, and prepared in a network affiliated with the organization and its allies, Ressam's own plans were, \nnonetheless, essentially independent.\n\nAl Qaeda, and Bin Ladin himself, did have at least one operation of their very own in mind for the millennium period. \nIn chapter 5 we introduced an al Qaeda operative named Nashiri. Working with Bin Ladin, he was developing a plan \nto attack a ship near Yemen. On January 3, an attempt was made to attack a U. S. warship in Aden, the USS The \nSullivans . The attempt failed when the small boat, overloaded with explosives, sank. The operatives salvaged their \nequipment without the attempt becoming known, and they put off their plans for another day.\n\nAl Qaeda's \"planes operation\"was also coming along. In January 2000, the United States caught a glimpse of its \npreparations.\n\nA Lost Trail in Southeast Asia \n\nIn late 1999, the National Security Agency (NSA) analyzed communications associated with a suspected terrorist \nfacility in the Middle East, indicating that several members of \"an operational cadre\" were planning to travel to Kuala \nLumpur in early January 2000. Initially, only the first names of three were known - \"Nawaf, \"\"Salem, \"and \"Khalid. \n\"NSA analysts surmised correctly that Salem was Nawaf 's younger brother. Seeing links not only with al Qaeda but \nspecifically with the 1998 embassy bombings, a CIA desk officer guessed that \"something more nefarious [was] \nafoot. \"  \n\nIn chapter 5, we discussed the dispatch of two operatives to the United States for their part in the planes operation - \nNawaf al Hazmi and Khalid al Mihdhar. Two more, Khallad and Abu Bara, went to Southeast Asia to case flights for \nthe part of the operation that was supposed to unfold there.   All made their way to Southeast Asia from Afghanistan \nand Pakistan, except for Mihdhar, who traveled from Yemen.  \n\nThough Nawaf 's trail was temporarily lost, the CIA soon identified \"Khalid\" as Khalid al Mihdhar.   He was located \nleaving Yemen and tracked until he arrived in Kuala Lumpur on January 5, 2000.   Other Arabs, unidentified at the \ntime, were watched as they gathered with him in the Malaysian capital.  \n\nOn January 8, the surveillance teams reported that three of the Arabs had suddenly left Kuala Lumpur on a short \nflight to Bangkok.   They identified one as Mihdhar. They later learned that one of his companions was named \nAlhazmi, although it was not yet known that he was \"Nawaf. \"The only identifier available for the third person was \npart of a name - Salahsae.   In Bangkok, CIA officers received the information too late to track the three men as \nthey came in, and the travelers disappeared into the streets of Bangkok.  \n\nThe Counterterrorist Center (CTC) had briefed the CIA leadership on the gathering in Kuala Lumpur, and the \ninformation had been passed on to Berger and the NSC staff and to Director Freeh and others at the FBI (though \nthe FBI noted that the CIA had the lead and would let the FBI know if a domestic angle arose). The head of the Bin \nLadin unit kept providing updates, unaware at first even that the Arabs had left Kuala Lumpur, let alone that their \ntrail had been lost in Bangkok.   When this bad news arrived, the names were put on a Thai watchlist so that Thai \nauthorities could inform the United States if any of them departed from Thailand.  \n\n\n\nSeveral weeks later, CIA officers in Kuala Lumpur prodded colleagues in Bangkok for additional information \nregarding the three travelers.   In early March 2000, Bangkok reported that Nawaf al Hazmi, now identified for the \nfirst time with his full name, had departed on January 15 on a United Airlines flight to Los Angeles. As for Khalid al \nMihdhar, there was no report of his departure even though he had accompanied Hazmi on the United flight to Los \nAngeles.   No one outside of the Counterterrorist Center was told any of this. The CIA did not try to register Mihdhar \nor Hazmi with the State Department's\n\nTIPOFF watchlist - either in January, when word arrived of Mihdhar's visa, or in March, when word came that \nHazmi, too, had had a U. S. visa and a ticket to Los Angeles.  \n\nNone of this information - about Mihdhar's U. S. visa or Hazmi's travel to the United States - went to the FBI, and \nnothing more was done to track any of the three until January 2001, when the investigation of another bombing, that \nof the USS Cole , reignited interest in Khallad. We will return to that story in chapter 8.\n\n6. 2 POST-CRISIS REFLECTION:AGENDA FOR 2000 \n\nAfter the millennium alert, elements of the U. S. government reviewed their performance. The CIA's leadership was \ntold that while a number of plots had been disrupted, the millennium might be only the \"kick-off \" for a period of \nextended attacks.   Clarke wrote Berger on January 11, 2000, that the CIA, the FBI, Justice, and the NSC staff had \ncome to two main conclusions. First, U. S. disruption efforts thus far had \"not put too much of a dent\" in Bin Ladin's \nnetwork. If the United States wanted to \"roll back\" the threat, disruption would have to proceed at \"a markedly \ndifferent tempo. \" Second, \"sleeper cells\" and \"a variety of terrorist groups\" had turned up at home.   As one of \nClarke's staff noted, only a \"chance discovery\" by U. S. Customs had prevented a possible attack.   Berger gave his \napproval for the NSC staff to commence an \"afteraction review, \" anticipating new budget requests. He also asked \nDCI Tenet to review the CIA's counterterrorism strategy and come up with a plan for \"where we go from here. \"  \n\nThe NSC staff advised Berger that the United States had only been \"nibbling at the edges\" of Bin Ladin's network \nand that more terror attacks were a question not of \"if \"but rather of \"when\"and \"where. \"   The Principals Committee \nmet on March 10, 2000, to review possible new moves. The principals ended up agreeing that the government \nshould take three major steps. First, more money should go to the CIA to accelerate its efforts to \"seriously attrit\" al \nQaeda. Second, there should be a crackdown on foreign terrorist organizations in the United States. Third, \nimmigration law enforcement should be strengthened, and the INS should tighten controls on the Canadian border \n(including stepping up U. S. -Canada cooperation). The principals endorsed the proposed programs; some, like \nexpanding the number of Joint Terrorism Task Forces, moved forward, and others, like creating a centralized \ntranslation unit for domestic intelligence intercepts in Arabic and other languages, did not.  \n\nPressing Pakistan \n\nWhile this process moved along, diplomacy continued its rounds. Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved \nunsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it,\n\n\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists. \"   \nIn early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban.\n\nIn January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism \ncoordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a \npresidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a \nsign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on \nBin Ladin. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything, \" given \nwhat it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan. \"  \n\nPresident Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without \nalso visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting \nPakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to \nmerit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South \n\n\n\nAsia.   His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U. S. president had been there since 1969. At \nhis meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and \nthe dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed Bin Ladin. President Clinton told us that when he pulled \nMusharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding Bin Ladin. \"I offered \nhim the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get Bin \nLadin and deal with another issue or two. \"  \n\nThe U. S. effort continued. Early in May, President Clinton urged Musharraf to carry through on his promise to visit \nAfghanistan and press Mullah Omar to expel Bin Ladin.   At the end of the month, Under Secretary of State Thomas \nPickering followed up with a trip to the region.   In June, DCI Tenet traveled to Pakistan with the same general \nmessage.   By September, the United States was becoming openly critical of Pakistan for supporting a Taliban \nmilitary offensive aimed at completing the conquest of Afghanistan.  \n\nIn December, taking a step proposed by the State Department some months earlier, the United States led a \ncampaign for new UN sanctions, which resulted in UN Security Council Resolution 1333, again calling for Bin \nLadin's expulsion and forbidding any country to provide the Taliban with arms or military assistance.   This, too, had \nlittle if any effect. The Taliban did not expel Bin Ladin. Pakistani arms continued to flow across the border.\n\nSecretary of State Madeleine Albright told us, \"We did not have a strong hand to play with the Pakistanis. Because \nof the sanctions required by U. S. law, we had few carrots to offer. \"   Congress had blocked most economic and \nmilitary aid to Pakistan because of that country's nuclear arms program and Musharraf 's coup. Sheehan was \ncritical of Musharraf, telling us that the Pakistani leader \"blew a chance to remake Pakistan. \"  \n\nBuilding New Capabilities:The CIA \n\nThe after-action review had treated the CIA as the lead agency for any offensive against al Qaeda, and the \nprincipals, at their March 10 meeting, had endorsed strengthening the CIA's capability for that role. To the CTC, that \nmeant proceeding with \"the Plan, \" which it had put forward half a year earlier - hiring and training more case \nofficers and building up the capabilities of foreign security services that provided intelligence via liaison. On \noccasion, as in Jordan in December 1999, these liaison services took direct action against al Qaeda cells.  \n\nIn the CTC and higher up, the CIA's managers believed that they desperately needed funds just to continue their \ncurrent counterterrorism effort, for they reckoned that the millennium alert had already used up all of the Center's \nfunds for the current fiscal year; the Bin Ladin unit had spent 140 percent of its allocation. Tenet told us he met with \nBerger to discuss funding for counterterrorism just two days after the principals' meeting.  \n\nWhile Clarke strongly favored giving the CIA more money for counterterrorism, he differed sharply with the CIA's \nmanagers about where it should come from. They insisted that the CIA had been shortchanged ever since the end \nof the Cold War. Their ability to perform any mission, counterterrorism included, they argued, depended on \npreserving what they had, restoring what they had lost since the beginning of the 1990s, and building from there - \nwith across-the-board recruitment and training of new case officers, and the reopening of closed stations. To \nfinance the counterterrorism effort, Tenet had gone to congressional leaders after the 1998 embassy bombings and \npersuaded them to give the CIA a special supplemental appropriation. Now, in the aftermath of the millennium alert, \nTenet wanted a boost in overall funds for the CIA and another supplemental appropriation specifically for \ncounterterrorism.  \n\nTo Clarke, this seemed evidence that the CIA's leadership did not give sufficient priority to the battle against Bin \nLadin and al Qaeda. He told us that James Pavitt, the head of the CIA's Directorate of Operations, \"said if there's \ngoing to be money spent on going after Bin Ladin, it should be given to him. . . . My view was that he had had a lot \nof money to do it and a long time to do it, and I didn't want to put more good money after bad. \"   The CIA had a \nvery different attitude:Pavitt told us that while the CIA's Bin Ladin unit did \"extraordinary and commendable work, \" \nhis chief of station in London \"was just as much part of the al Qaeda struggle as an officer sitting in [the Bin Ladin \nunit]. \"  \n\n\n\nThe dispute had large managerial implications, for Clarke had found allies in the Office of Management and Budget \n(OMB). They had supplied him with the figures he used to argue that CIA spending on counterterrorism from its \nbaseline budget had shown almost no increase.  \n\nBerger met twice with Tenet in April to try to resolve the dispute. The Deputies Committee met later in the month to \nreview fiscal year 2000 and 2001 budget priorities and offsets for the CIA and other agencies. In the end,\n\nTenet obtained a modest supplemental appropriation, which funded counterterrorism without requiring much \nreprogramming of baseline funds. But the CIA still believed that it remained underfunded for counterterrorism.  \n\nTerrorist Financing \n\nThe second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist \norganizations and curtail their fund-raising.\n\nThe embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of \nan NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated Bin \nLadin and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave \nthe Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any Bin \nLadin or al Qaeda assets that reached the U. S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, \nfew funds were frozen.  \n\nIn July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring Bin Ladin. Here, OFAC had \nmore success. It blocked more than $34 million in Taliban assets held in U. S. banks. Another $215 million in gold \nand $2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank \nof New York, were also frozen.   After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \n\"foreign terrorist organization, \" it became the duty of U. S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds.   \nNeither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily \ncircumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not \nused as conduits for terrorist funding.  \n\nAttacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a \nclandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's Bin Ladin unit had originally been inspired by \nthe idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial \ninvestigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of \ngathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not \nbelieve that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and \nintentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing.  \n\nNevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money. It knew relatively early, for \nexample, about the loose affiliation of financial institutions, businesses, and wealthy individuals who supported \nextremist Islamic activities.   Much of the early reporting on al Qaeda's financial situation and its structure came \nfrom Jamal Ahmed al Fadl, whom we have mentioned earlier in the report.   After the 1998 embassy bombings, the \nU. S. government tried to develop a clearer picture of Bin Ladin's finances. A U. S.\n\ninteragency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their \nunderstanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Ladin was \nfunding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true.\n\nThe officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to \nfocus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although \nthe intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence,   it \nremained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international \nfinancial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows.  \n\n\n\nThe NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create \nan all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at \nTreasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources.  \n\nWithin the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising \nfunds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations \noperating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al \nQaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant \ninvestigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a \nnational level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the \nnature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising.  \n\nTreasury regulators, as well as U. S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or \ndisrupting the vast flows of U. S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-\nscale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars \nout of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress.   Before 9/11, Treasury \ndid not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.  \n\nBorder Security \n\nThe third point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need for attention to America's porous \nborders and the weak enforcement of immigration laws. Drawing on ideas from government officials, Clarke's \nworking group developed a menu of proposals to bolster border security. Some reworked or reiterated previous \npresidential directives.   They included\n\n     *  creating an interagency center to target illegal entry and human\n\n        traffickers;\n\n     *  imposing tighter controls on student visas;\n\n     *  taking legal action to prevent terrorists from coming into the\n\n        United States and to remove those already here, detaining them\n\n        while awaiting removal proceedings;\n\n     *  further increasing the number of immigration agents to FBI Joint\n\n        Terrorism Task Forces to help investigate immigration charges\n\n        against individuals suspected of terrorism;\n\n     *  activating a special court to enable the use of classified evidence\n\n        in immigration-related national security cases; and\n\n     *  both implementing new security measures for U. S. passports and\n\n        working with the United Nations and foreign governments to raise\n\n        global security standards for travel documents.\n\nClarke's working group compiled new proposals as well, such as\n\n     *  undertaking a Joint Perimeter Defense program with Canada to\n\n        establish cooperative intelligence and law enforcement programs,\n\n        leading to joint operations based on shared visa and immigration\n\n        data and joint border patrols;\n\n     *  staffing land border crossings 24/7 and equipping them with video\n\n\n\n        cameras, physical barriers, and means to detect weapons of mass\n\n        destruction (WMD); and\n\n     *  addressing the problem of migrants - possibly including terrorists\n\n        - who destroy their travel documents so they cannot be returned to\n\n        their countries of origin.\n\nThese proposals were praiseworthy in principle. In practice, however, they required action by weak, chronically \nunderfunded executive agencies and powerful congressional committees, which were more responsive to well-\norganized interest groups than to executive branch interagency committees. The changes sought by the principals \nin March 2000 were only beginning to occur before 9/11.\n\n\"Afghan Eyes\" \n\nIn early March 2000, when President Clinton received an update on U. S. covert action efforts against Bin Ladin, he \nwrote in the memo's margin that the United States could surely do better. Military officers in the Joint Staff told us \nthat they shared this sense of frustration. Clarke used the President's comment to push the CSG to brainstorm new \nideas, including aid to the Northern Alliance.  \n\nBack in December 1999, Northern Alliance leader Ahmed Shah Massoud had offered to stage a rocket attack \nagainst Bin Ladin's Derunta training complex. Officers at the CIA had worried that giving him a green light might \ncross the line into violation of the assassination ban. Hence, Massoud was told not\n\nto take any such action without explicit U. S. authorization.   In the spring of 2000, after the CIA had sent out officers \nto explore possible closer relationships with both the Uzbeks and the Northern Alliance, discussions took place in \nWashington between U. S. officials and delegates sent by Massoud.  \n\nThe Americans agreed that Massoud should get some modest technical help so he could work on U. S. priorities - \ncollecting intelligence on and possibly acting against al Qaeda. But Massoud wanted the United States both to \nbecome his ally in trying to overthrow the Taliban and to recognize that they were fighting common enemies. Clarke \nand Cofer Black, the head of the Counterterrorist Center, wanted to take this next step. Proposals to help the \nNorthern Alliance had been debated in the U. S. government since 1999 and, as we mentioned in chapter 4, the U. \nS. government as a whole had been wary of endorsing them, largely because of the Northern Alliance's checkered \nhistory, its limited base of popular support in Afghanistan, and Pakistan's objections.  \n\nCIA officials also began pressing proposals to use their ties with the Northern Alliance to get American agents on \nthe ground in Afghanistan for an extended period, setting up their own base for covert intelligence collection and \nactivity in the Panjshir Valley and lessening reliance on foreign proxies. \"There's no substitute for face-to-face, \" one \nofficer told us.   But the CIA's institutional capacity for such direct action was weak, especially if it was not working \njointly with the U. S. military. The idea was turned down as too risky.  \n\nIn the meantime, the CIA continued to work with its tribal assets in southern Afghanistan. In early August, the tribals \nreported an attempt to ambush Bin Ladin's convoy as he traveled on the road between Kabul and Kandahar city - \ntheir first such reported interdiction attempt in more than a year and a half. But it was not a success. According to \nthe tribals' own account, when they approached one of the vehicles, they quickly determined that women and \nchildren were inside and called off the ambush. Conveying this information to the NSC staff, the CIA noted that they \nhad no independent corroboration for this incident, but that the tribals had acted within the terms of the CIA's \nauthorities in Afghanistan.  \n\nIn 2000, plans continued to be developed for potential military operations in Afghanistan. Navy vessels that could \nlaunch missiles into Afghanistan were still on call in the north Arabian Sea.   In the summer, the military refined its \nlist of strikes and Special Operations possibilities to a set of 13 options within the Operation Infinite Resolve plan.   \nYet planning efforts continued to be limited by the same operational and policy concerns encountered in 1998 and \n1999. Although the intelligence community sometimes knew where Bin Ladin was, it had been unable to provide \nintelligence considered sufficiently reliable to launch a strike. Above all, the United States did not have American \n\n\n\neyes on the target. As one military officer put it, we had our hand on the door, but we couldn't open the door and \nwalk in.  \n\nAt some point during this period, President Clinton expressed his frustration with the lack of military options to take \nout Bin Ladin and the al Qaeda leadership, remarking to General Hugh Shelton, \"You know, it would scare the shit \nout of al-Qaeda if suddenly a bunch of black ninjas rappelled out of helicopters into the middle of their camp. \"   \nAlthough Shelton told the Commission he did not remember the statement, President Clinton recalled this remark \nas \"one of the many things I said. \" The President added, however, that he realized nothing would be accomplished \nif he lashed out in anger. Secretary of Defense William Cohen thought that the President might have been making \na hypothetical statement. Regardless, he said, the question remained how to get the \"ninjas\" into and out of the \ntheater of operations.   As discussed in chapter 4, plans of this kind were never carried out before 9/11.\n\nIn late 1999 or early 2000, the Joint Staff 's director of operations, Vice Admiral Scott Fry, directed his chief \ninformation operations officer, Brigadier General Scott Gration, to develop innovative ways to get better intelligence \non Bin Ladin's whereabouts. Gration and his team worked on a number of different ideas aimed at getting reliable \nAmerican eyes on Bin Ladin in a way that would reduce the lag time between sighting and striking.  \n\nOne option was to use a small, unmanned U. S. Air Force drone called the Predator, which could survey the \nterritory below and send back video footage. Another option - eventually dismissed as impractical - was to place a \npowerful long-range telescope on a mountain within range of one of Bin Ladin's training camps. Both proposals \nwere discussed with General Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and then briefed to Clarke's office at \nthe White House as the CSG was searching for new ideas. In the spring of 2000, Clarke brought in the CIA's \nassistant director for collection, Charles Allen, to work together with Fry on a joint CIA-Pentagon effort that Clarke \ndubbed \"Afghan Eyes. \"   After much argument between the CIA and the Defense Department about who should \npay for the program, the White House eventually imposed a cost-sharing agreement. The CIA agreed to pay for \nPredator operations as a 60-day \"proof of concept\" trial run.  \n\nThe Small Group backed Afghan Eyes at the end of June 2000. By mid-July, testing was completed and the \nequipment was ready, but legal issues were still being ironed out.   By August 11, the principals had agreed to \ndeploy the Predator.   The NSC staff considered how to use the information the drones would be relaying from \nAfghanistan. Clarke's deputy, Roger Cressey, wrote to Berger that emergency CSG and Principals Committee \nmeetings might be needed to act on video coming in from the Predator if it proved able to lock in Bin Ladin's \nlocation. In the memo's margin, Berger wrote that before considering action, \"I will want more than verified \nlocation:we will need, at least, data on pattern of movements to provide some assurance he will remain in place. \" \nPresident Clinton was kept up to date.  \n\nOn September 7, the Predator flew for the first time over Afghanistan. When\n\nClarke saw video taken during the trial flight, he described the imagery to Berger as \"truly astonishing, \" and he \nargued immediately for more flights seeking to find Bin Ladin and target him for cruise missile or air attack. Even if \nBin Ladin were not found, Clarke said, Predator missions might identify additional worthwhile targets, such as other \nal Qaeda leaders or stocks of chemical or biological weapons.  \n\nClarke was not alone in his enthusiasm. He had backing from Cofer Black and Charles Allen at the CIA. Ten out of \n15 trial missions of the Predator over Afghanistan were rated successful. On the first flight, a Predator saw a \nsecurity detail around a tall man in a white robe at Bin Ladin's Tarnak Farms compound outside Kandahar. After a \nsecond sighting of the \"man in white\" at the compound on September 28, intelligence community analysts \ndetermined that he was probably Bin Ladin.  \n\nDuring at least one trial mission, the Taliban spotted the Predator and scrambled MiG fighters to try, without \nsuccess, to intercept it. Berger worried that a Predator might be shot down, and warned Clarke that a shootdown \nwould be a \"bonanza\" for Bin Ladin and the Taliban.  \n\nStill, Clarke was optimistic about Predator - as well as progress with disruptions of al Qaeda cells elsewhere. Berger \nwas more cautious, praising the NSC staff 's performance but observing that this was no time for complacency. \n\"Unfortunately, \" he wrote, \"the light at the end of the tunnel is another tunnel. \"  \n\n\n\n6. 3 THE ATTACK ON THE USS COLE  \n\nEarly in chapter 5 we introduced, along with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, two other men who became operational \ncoordinators for al Qaeda: Khallad and Nashiri. As we explained, both were involved during 1998 and 1999 in \npreparing to attack a ship off the coast of Yemen with a boatload of explosives. They had originally targeted a \ncommercial vessel, specifically an oil tanker, but Bin Ladin urged them to look for a U. S. warship instead. In \nJanuary 2000, their team had attempted to attack a warship in the port of Aden, but the attempt failed when the \nsuicide boat sank. More than nine months later, on October 12, 2000, al Qaeda operatives in a small boat laden \nwith explosives attacked a U. S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole . The blast ripped a hole in the side of the Cole , \nkilling 17 members of the ship's crew and wounding at least 40.  \n\nThe plot, we now know, was a full-fledged al Qaeda operation, supervised directly by Bin Ladin. He chose the target \nand location of the attack, selected the suicide operatives, and provided the money needed to purchase explosives \nand equipment. Nashiri was the field commander and managed the operation in Yemen. Khallad helped in Yemen \nuntil he was arrested in a case of mistaken\n\nidentity and freed with Bin Ladin's help, as we also mentioned earlier. Local al Qaeda coordinators included Jamal \nal Badawi and Fahd al Quso, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby apartment. The two suicide \noperatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras. Nibras and Quso \ndelivered money to Khallad in Bangkok during Khallad's January 2000 trip to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok.  \n\nIn September 2000, Bin Ladin reportedly told Nashiri that he wanted to replace Khamri and Nibras. Nashiri was \nangry and disagreed, telling others he would go to Afghanistan and explain to Bin Ladin that the new operatives \nwere already trained and ready to conduct the attack. Prior to departing, Nashiri gave Nibras and Khamri \ninstructions to execute the attack on the next U. S. warship that entered the port of Aden.  \n\nWhile Nashiri was in Afghanistan, Nibras and Khamri saw their chance. They piloted the explosives-laden boat \nalongside the USS Cole , made friendly gestures to crew members, and detonated the bomb. Quso did not arrive at \nthe apartment in time to film the attack.  \n\nBack in Afghanistan, Bin Ladin anticipated U. S. military retaliation. He ordered the evacuation of al Qaeda's \nKandahar airport compound and fled - first to the desert area near Kabul, then to Khowst and Jalalabad, and \neventually back to Kandahar. In Kandahar, he rotated between five to six residences, spending one night at each \nresidence. In addition, he sent his senior advisor, Mohammed Atef, to a different part of Kandahar and his deputy, \nAyman al Zawahiri, to Kabul so that all three could not be killed in one attack.  \n\nThere was no American strike. In February 2001, a source reported that an individual whom he identified as the big \ninstructor (probably a reference to Bin Ladin) complained frequently that the United States had not yet attacked. \nAccording to the source, Bin Ladin wanted the United States to attack, and if it did not he would launch something \nbigger.  \n\nThe attack on the USS Cole galvanized al Qaeda's recruitment efforts. Following the attack, Bin Ladin instructed \nthe media committee, then headed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, to produce a propaganda video that included a \nreenactment of the attack along with images of the al Qaeda training camps and training methods; it also \nhighlighted Muslim suffering in Palestine, Kashmir, Indonesia, and Chechnya. Al Qaeda's image was very important \nto Bin Ladin, and the video was widely disseminated. Portions were aired on Al Jazeera, CNN, and other television \noutlets. It was also disseminated among many young men in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and caused many \nextremists to travel to Afghanistan for training and jihad. Al Qaeda members considered the video an effective tool \nin their struggle for preeminence among other Islamist and jihadist movements.  \n\nInvestigating the Attack \n\nTeams from the FBI, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, and the CIA were immediately sent to Yemen to \ninvestigate the attack. With difficulty, Barbara Bodine, the U. S. ambassador to Yemen, tried to persuade the \nYemeni government to accept these visitors and allow them to carry arms, though the Yemenis balked at letting \nAmericans openly carry long guns (rifles, shotguns, automatic weapons). Meanwhile, Bodine and the leader of the \n\n\n\nFBI team, John O'Neill, clashed repeatedly - to the point that after O'Neill had been rotated out of Yemen but \nwanted to return, Bodine refused the request. Despite the initial tension, theYemeni and American investigations \nproceeded. Within a few weeks, the outline of the story began to emerge.  \n\nOn the day of the Cole attack, a list of suspects was assembled that included al Qaeda's affiliate Egyptian Islamic \nJihad. U. S. counterterrorism officials told us they immediately assumed that al Qaeda was responsible. But as \nDeputy DCI John McLaughlin explained to us, it was not enough for the attack to smell, look, and taste like an al \nQaeda operation. To make a case, the CIA needed not just a guess but a link to someone known to be an al Qaeda \noperative.  \n\nWithin the first weeks after the attack, the Yemenis found and arrested both Badawi and Quso, but did not let the \nFBI team participate in the interrogations. The CIA described initial Yemeni support after the Cole as \"slow and \ninadequate. \" President Clinton, Secretary Albright, and DCI Tenet all intervened to help. Because the information \nwas secondhand, the U. S. team could not make its own assessment of its reliability.  \n\nOn November 11, the Yemenis provided the FBI with new information from the interrogations of Badawi and Quso, \nincluding descriptions of individuals from whom the detainees had received operational direction. One of them was \nKhallad, who was described as having lost his leg. The detainees said that Khallad helped direct the Cole operation \nfrom Afghanistan or Pakistan. The Yemenis (correctly) judged that the man described as Khallad was Tawfiq bin \nAttash.  \n\nAn FBI special agent recognized the name Khallad and connected this news with information from an important al \nQaeda source who had been meeting regularly with CIA and FBI officers. The source had called Khallad Bin \nLadin's \"run boy, \" and described him as having lost one leg in an explosives accident at a training camp a few \nyears earlier. To confirm the identification, the FBI agent asked the Yemenis for their photo of Khallad. The \nYemenis provided the photo on November 22, reaffirming their view that Khallad had been an intermediary between \nthe plotters and Bin Ladin. (In a meeting with U. S. officials a few weeks later, on December 16, the source \nidentified Khallad from the Yemeni photograph. )  \n\nU. S. intelligence agencies had already connected Khallad to al Qaeda terrorist operations, including the 1998 \nembassy bombings. By this time the Yeme-\n\nnis also had identified Nashiri, whose links to al Qaeda and the 1998 embassy bombings were even more well-\nknown.  \n\nIn other words, the Yemenis provided strong evidence connecting the Cole attack to al Qaeda during the second \nhalf of November, identifying individual operatives whom the United States knew were part of al Qaeda. During \nDecember the United States was able to corroborate this evidence. But the United States did not have evidence \nabout Bin Ladin's personal involvement in the attacks until Nashiri and Khallad were captured in 2002 and 2003.\n\nConsidering a Response \n\nThe Cole attack prompted renewed consideration of what could be done about al Qaeda. According to Clarke, \nBerger upbraided DCITenet so sharply after the Cole attack - repeatedly demanding to know why the United States \nhad to put up with such attacks - that Tenet walked out of a meeting of the principals.  \n\nThe CIA got some additional covert action authorities, adding several other individuals to the coverage of the July \n1999 Memorandum of Notification that allowed the United States to develop capture operations against al Qaeda \nleaders in a variety of places and circumstances. Tenet developed additional options, such as strengthening \nrelationships with the Northern Alliance and the Uzbeks and slowing recent al Qaeda-related activities in Lebanon.  \n\nOn the diplomatic track, Berger agreed on October 30, 2000, to let the State Department make another approach to \nTaliban Deputy Foreign Minister Abdul Jalil about expelling Bin Ladin. The national security advisor ordered that the \nU. S. message \"be stern and foreboding. \" This warning was similar to those issued in 1998 and 1999. Meanwhile, \nthe administration was working with Russia on new UN sanctions against Mullah Omar's regime.  \n\nPresident Clinton told us that before he could launch further attacks on al Qaeda in Afghanistan, or deliver an \nultimatum to the Taliban threatening strikes if they did not immediately expel Bin Ladin, the CIA or the FBI had to be \n\n\n\nsure enough that they would \"be willing to stand up in public and say, we believe that he [Bin Ladin] did this. \" He \nsaid he was very frustrated that he could not get a definitive enough answer to do something about the Cole attack.   \nSimilarly, Berger recalled that to go to war, a president needs to be able to say that his senior intelligence and law \nenforcement officers have concluded who is responsible. He recalled that the intelligence agencies had strong \nsuspicions, but had reached \"no conclusion by the time we left office that it was al Qaeda. \"  \n\nOur only sources for what intelligence officials thought at the time are what they said in informal briefings. Soon \nafter the Cole attack and for the remainder of the Clinton administration, analysts stopped distributing written \nreports about who was responsible. The topic was obviously sensitive, and both Ambassador Bodine in Yemen and \nCIA analysts in Washington presumed that the government did not want reports circulating around the agencies \nthat\n\nmight become public, impeding law enforcement actions or backing the President into a corner.  \n\nInstead the White House and other principals relied on informal updates as more evidence came in. Though Clarke \nworried that the CIA might be equivocating in assigning responsibility to al Qaeda, he wrote Berger on November 7 \nthat the analysts had described their case by saying that \"it has web feet, flies, and quacks. \"On November 10, CIA \nanalysts briefed the Small Group of principals on their preliminary findings that the attack was carried out by a cell \nof Yemeni residents with some ties to the transnational mujahideen network. According to the briefing, these \nresidents likely had some support from al Qaeda. But the information on outside sponsorship, support, and direction \nof the operation was inconclusive. The next day, Berger and Clarke told President Clinton that while the \ninvestigation was continuing, it was becoming increasingly clear that al Qaeda had planned and directed the \nbombing.  \n\nIn mid-November, as the evidence of al Qaeda involvement mounted, Berger asked General Shelton to reevaluate \nmilitary plans to act quickly against Bin Ladin. General Shelton tasked General Tommy Franks, the new \ncommander of CENTCOM, to look again at the options. Shelton wanted to demonstrate that the military was \nimaginative and knowledgeable enough to move on an array of options, and to show the complexity of the \noperations. He briefed Berger on the \"Infinite Resolve\" strike options developed since 1998, which the Joint Staff \nand CENTCOM had refined during the summer into a list of 13 possibilities or combinations. CENTCOM added a \nnew \"phased campaign\"concept for wider-ranging strikes, including attacks against the Taliban. For the first time, \nthese strikes envisioned an air campaign against Afghanistan of indefinite duration. Military planners did not include \ncontingency planning for an invasion of Afghanistan. The concept was briefed to Deputy National Security Advisor \nDonald Kerrick on December 20, and to other officials.  \n\nOn November 25, Berger and Clarke wrote President Clinton that although the FBI and CIA investigations had not \nreached a formal conclusion, they believed the investigations would soon conclude that the attack had been carried \nout by a large cell whose senior members belonged to al Qaeda. Most of those involved had trained in Bin Ladin-\noperated camps in Afghanistan, Berger continued. So far, Bin Ladin had not been tied personally to the attack and \nnobody had heard him directly order it, but two intelligence reports suggested that he was involved. When \ndiscussing possible responses, though, Berger referred to the premise - al Qaeda responsibility - as an \"unproven \nassumption. \"  \n\nIn the same November 25 memo, Berger informed President Clinton about a closely held idea: a last-chance \nultimatum for the Taliban. Clarke was developing the idea with specific demands: immediate extradition of Bin Ladin \nand his lieutenants to a legitimate government for trial, observable closure of all ter-\n\nrorist facilities in Afghanistan, and expulsion of all terrorists from Afghanistan within 90 days. Noncompliance would \nmean U. S. \"force directed at the Taliban itself \" and U. S. efforts to ensure that the Taliban would never defeat the \nNorthern Alliance. No such ultimatum was issued.  \n\nNearly a month later, on December 21, the CIA made another presentation to the Small Group of principals on the \ninvestigative team's findings. The CIA's briefing slides said that their \"preliminary judgment\" was that Bin Ladin's al \nQaeda group \"supported the attack\" on the Cole , based on strong circumstantial evidence tying key perpetrators of \nthe attack to al Qaeda. The CIA listed the key suspects, including Nashiri. In addition, the CIA detailed the timeline \nof the operation, from the mid-1999 preparations, to the failed attack on the USS The Sullivans on January 3, 2000, \nthrough a meeting held by the operatives the day before the attack.  \n\n\n\nThe slides said that so far the CIA had \"no definitive answer on [the] crucial question of outside direction of the \nattack - how and by whom. \"The CIA noted that the Yemenis claimed that Khallad helped direct the operation from \nAfghanistan or Pakistan, possibly as Bin Ladin's intermediary, but that it had not seen the Yemeni evidence. \nHowever, the CIA knew from both human sources and signals intelligence that Khallad was tied to al Qaeda. The \nprepared briefing concluded that while some reporting about al Qaeda's role might have merit, those reports offered \nfew specifics. Intelligence gave some ambiguous indicators of al Qaeda direction of the attack.\n\nThis, President Clinton and Berger told us, was not the conclusion they needed in order to go to war or deliver an \nultimatum to the Taliban threatening war. The election and change of power was not the issue, President Clinton \nadded. There was enough time. If the agencies had given him a definitive answer, he said, he would have sought a \nUN Security Council ultimatum and given the Taliban one, two, or three days before taking further action against \nboth al Qaeda and the Taliban. But he did not think it would be responsible for a president to launch an invasion of \nanother country just based on a \"preliminary judgment. \"  \n\nOther advisers have echoed this concern. Some of Secretary Albright's advisers warned her at the time to be sure \nthe evidence conclusively linked Bin Ladin to the Cole before considering any response, especially a military one, \nbecause such action might inflame the Islamic world and increase support for the Taliban. Defense Secretary \nCohen told us it would not have been prudent to risk killing civilians based only on an assumption that al Qaeda \nwas responsible. General Shelton added that there was an outstanding question as to who was responsible and \nwhat the targets were.  \n\nClarke recalled that while the Pentagon and the State Department had reservations about retaliation, the issue \nnever came to a head because the FBI and the CIA never reached a firm conclusion. He thought they were \"holding \nback. \" He said he did not know why, but his impression was that Tenet and\n\nReno possibly thought the White House \"didn't really want to know, \" since the principals' discussions by November \nsuggested that there was not much White House interest in conducting further military operations against \nAfghanistan in the administration's last weeks. He thought that, instead, President Clinton, Berger, and Secretary \nAlbright were concentrating on a lastminute push for a peace agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis.  \n\nSome of Clarke's fellow counterterrorism officials, such as the State Department's Sheehan and the FBI's Watson, \nshared his disappointment that no military response occurred at the time. Clarke recently recalled that an angry \nSheehan asked rhetorically of Defense officials:\"Does al Qaeda have to attack the Pentagon to get their attention? \"  \n\nOn the question of evidence, Tenet told us he was surprised to hear that the White House was awaiting a \nconclusion from him on responsibility for the Cole attack before taking action against al Qaeda. He did not recall \nBerger or anyone else telling him that they were waiting for the magic words from the CIA and the FBI. Nor did he \nremember having any discussions with Berger or the President about retaliation. Tenet told us he believed that it \nwas up to him to present the case. Then it was up to the principals to decide if the case was good enough to justify \nusing force. He believed he laid out what was knowable relatively early in the investigation, and that this evidence \nnever really changed until after 9/11.  \n\nA CIA official told us that the CIA's analysts chose the term \"preliminary judgment\" because of their notion of how \nan intelligence standard of proof differed from a legal standard. Because the attack was the subject of a criminal \ninvestigation, they told us, the term preliminary was used to avoid locking the government in with statements that \nmight later be obtained by defense lawyers in a future court case. At the time, Clarke was aware of the problem of \ndistinguishing between an intelligence case and a law enforcement case. Asking U. S. law enforcement officials to \nconcur with an intelligence-based case before their investigation had been concluded \"could give rise to charges \nthat the administration had acted before final culpability had been determined. \"  \n\nThere was no interagency consideration of just what military action might have looked like in practice - either the \nPentagon's new \"phased campaign\" concept or a prolonged air campaign in Afghanistan. Defense officials, such as \nUnder Secretary Walter Slocombe and Vice Admiral Fry, told us the military response options were still limited. Bin \nLadin continued to be elusive. They felt, just as they had for the past two years, that hitting inexpensive and \nrudimentary training camps with costly missiles would not do much good and might even help al Qaeda if the strikes \nfailed to kill Bin Ladin.  \n\n\n\nIn late 2000, the CIA and the NSC staff began thinking about the counterterrorism policy agenda they would present \nto the new administration. The Counterterrorist Center put down its best ideas for the future, assuming it was free of \nany prior policy or financial constraints. The paper was therefore infor-\n\nmally referred to as the \"Blue Sky\" memo; it was sent to Clarke on December 29. The memo proposed\n\n     *  A major effort to support the Northern Alliance through\n\n        intelligence sharing and increased funding so that it could stave\n\n        off the Taliban army and tie down al Qaeda fighters. This effort\n\n        was not intended to remove the Taliban from power, a goal that was\n\n        judged impractical and too expensive for the CIA alone to attain.\n\n     *  Increased support to the Uzbeks to strengthen their ability to\n\n        fight terrorism and assist the United States in doing so.\n\n     *  Assistance to anti-Taliban groups and proxies who might be\n\n        encouraged to passively resist the Taliban.\n\nThe CIA memo noted that there was \"no single 'silver bullet' available to deal with the growing problems in \nAfghanistan. \"A multifaceted strategy would be needed to produce change.  \n\nNo action was taken on these ideas in the few remaining weeks of the Clinton administration. Berger did not recall \nseeing or being briefed on the Blue Sky memo. Nor was the memo discussed during the transition with incoming \ntop Bush administration officials. Tenet and his deputy told us they pressed these ideas as options after the new \nteam took office.  \n\nAs the Clinton administration drew to a close, Clarke and his staff developed a policy paper of their own, the first \nsuch comprehensive effort since the Delenda plan of 1998. The resulting paper, entitled \"Strategy for Eliminating \nthe Threat from the Jihadist Networks of al Qida: Status and Prospects, \" reviewed the threat and the record to \ndate, incorporated the CIA's new ideas from the Blue Sky memo, and posed several near-term policy options.\n\nClarke and his staff proposed a goal to \"roll back\" al Qaeda over a period of three to five years. Over time, the \npolicy should try to weaken and eliminate the network's infrastructure in order to reduce it to a \"rump group\" like \nother formerly feared but now largely defunct terrorist organizations of the 1980s. \"Continued anti-al Qida \noperations at the current level will prevent some attacks, \" Clarke's office wrote, \"but will not seriously attrit their \nability to plan and conduct attacks. \" The paper backed covert aid to the Northern Alliance, covert aid to Uzbekistan, \nand renewed Predator flights in March 2001. A sentence called for military action to destroy al Qaeda command-\nandcontrol targets and infrastructure and Taliban military and command assets. The paper also expressed concern \nabout the presence of al Qaeda operatives in the United States.  \n\n6. 4 CHANGE AND CONTINUITY \n\nOn November 7, 2000, American voters went to the polls in what turned out to be one of the closest presidential \ncontests in U. S. history - an election campaign during which there was a notable absence of serious discussion of \nthe al Qaeda threat or terrorism. Election night became a 36-day legal fight. Until the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling on \nDecember 12 and Vice President Al Gore's concession, no one knew whether Gore or his Republican opponent, \nTexas Governor George W. Bush, would become president in 2001.\n\nThe dispute over the election and the 36-day delay cut in half the normal transition period. Given that a presidential \nelection in the United States brings wholesale change in personnel, this loss of time hampered the new \nadministration in identifying, recruiting, clearing, and obtaining Senate confirmation of key appointees.\n\nFrom the Old to the New \n\n\n\nThe principal figures on Bush's White House staff would be National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who had \nbeen a member of the NSC staff in the administration of George H. W. Bush; Rice's deputy, Stephen Hadley, who \nhad been an assistant secretary of defense under the first Bush; and Chief of Staff Andrew Card, who had served \nthat same administration as deputy chief of staff, then secretary of transportation. For secretary of state, Bush \nchose General Colin Powell, who had been national security advisor for President Ronald Reagan and then \nchairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. For secretary of defense he selected Donald Rumsfeld, a former member of \nCongress, White House chief of staff, and, under President Gerald Ford, already once secretary of defense. Bush \ndecided fairly soon to keep Tenet as Director of Central Intelligence. Louis Freeh, who had statutory ten-year \ntenure, would remain director of the FBI until his voluntary retirement in the summer of 2001.\n\nBush and his principal advisers had all received briefings on terrorism, including Bin Ladin. In early September \n2000, Acting Deputy Director of Central Intelligence John McLaughlin led a team to Bush's ranch in Crawford, \nTexas, and gave him a wide-ranging, four-hour review of sensitive information. Ben Bonk, deputy chief of the CIA's \nCounterterrorist Center, used one of the four hours to deal with terrorism. To highlight the danger of terrorists \nobtaining chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons, Bonk brought along a mock-up suitcase to evoke \nthe way the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult had spread deadly sarin nerve agent on the Tokyo subway in 1995. Bonk \ntold Bush that Americans would die from terrorism during the next four years.   During the long contest after election \nday, the CIA set up an office in Crawford to pass intelligence to Bush and some of his key advisers.   Tenet, \naccompanied by his deputy director for operations, James Pavitt, briefed President-elect Bush at Blair House during \nthe transition. President Bush told\n\nus he asked Tenet whether the CIA could kill Bin Ladin, and Tenet replied that killing Bin Ladin would have an effect \nbut would not end the threat. President Bush told us Tenet said to him that the CIA had all the authority it needed.  \n\nIn December, Bush met with Clinton for a two-hour, one-on-one discussion of national security and foreign policy \nchallenges. Clinton recalled saying to Bush, \"I think you will find that by far your biggest threat is Bin Ladin and the \nal Qaeda. \" Clinton told us that he also said, \"One of the great regrets of my presidency is that I didn't get him [Bin \nLadin] for you, because I tried to. \"   Bush told the Commission that he felt sure President Clinton had mentioned \nterrorism, but did not remember much being said about al Qaeda. Bush recalled that Clinton had emphasized other \nissues such as North Korea and the Israeli- Palestinian peace process.  \n\nIn early January, Clarke briefed Rice on terrorism. He gave similar presentations - describing al Qaeda as both an \nadaptable global network of jihadist organizations and a lethal core terrorist organization - to Vice President-elect \nCheney, Hadley, and Secretary of State-designate Powell. One line in the briefing slides said that al Qaeda had \nsleeper cells in more than 40 countries, including the United States.   Berger told us that he made a point of \ndropping in on Clarke's briefing of Rice to emphasize the importance of the issue. Later the same day, Berger met \nwith Rice. He says that he told her the Bush administration would spend more time on terrorism in general and al \nQaeda in particular than on anything else. Rice's recollection was that Berger told her she would be surprised at \nhow much more time she was going to spend on terrorism than she expected, but that the bulk of their conversation \ndealt with the faltering Middle East peace process and North Korea. Clarke said that the new team, having been out \nof government for eight years, had a steep learning curve to understand al Qaeda and the new transnational \nterrorist threat.  \n\nOrganizing a New Administration \n\nDuring the short transition, Rice and Hadley concentrated on staffing and organizing the NSC.   Their policy \npriorities differed from those of the Clinton administration. Those priorities included China, missile defense, the \ncollapse of the Middle East peace process, and the Persian Gulf.   Generally aware that terrorism had changed \nsince the first Bush administration, they paid particular attention to the question of how counterterrorism policy \nshould be coordinated. Rice had asked University of Virginia history professor Philip Zelikow to advise her on the \ntransition.   Hadley and Zelikow asked Clarke and his deputy, Roger Cressey, for a special briefing on the terrorist \nthreat and how Clarke's Transnational Threats Directorate and Counterterrorism Security Group functioned.  \n\n\n\nIn the NSC during the first Bush administration, many tough issues were addressed at the level of the Deputies \nCommittee. Issues did not go to the principals unless the deputies had been unable to resolve them. Presidential \nDeci-\n\nsion Directive 62 of the Clinton administration had said specifically that Clarke's Counterterrorism Security Group \nshould report through the Deputies Committee or, at Berger's discretion, directly to the principals. Berger had in \npractice allowed Clarke's group to function as a parallel deputies committee, reporting directly to those members of \nthe Principals Committee who sat on the special Small Group. There, Clarke himself sat as a de facto principal.\n\nRice decided to change the special structure that had been built to coordinate counterterrorism policy. It was \nimportant to sound policymaking, she felt, that Clarke's interagency committee - like all others - report to the \nprincipals through the deputies.  \n\nRice made an initial decision to hold over both Clarke and his entire counterterrorism staff, a decision that she \ncalled rare for a new administration. She decided also that Clarke should retain the title of national counterterrorism \ncoordinator, although he would no longer be a de facto member of the Principals Committee on his issues. The \ndecision to keep Clarke, Rice said, was \"not uncontroversial, \" since he was known as someone who \"broke china, \" \nbut she and Hadley wanted an experienced crisis manager. No one else from Berger's staff had Clarke's detailed \nknowledge of the levers of government.  \n\nClarke was disappointed at what he perceived as a demotion. He also worried that reporting through the Deputies \nCommittee would slow decisionmaking on counterterrorism.  \n\nThe result, amid all the changes accompanying the transition, was significant continuity in counterterrorism policy. \nClarke and his Counterterrorism Security Group would continue to manage coordination. Tenet remained Director \nof Central Intelligence and kept the same chief subordinates, including Black and his staff at the Counterterrorist \nCenter. Shelton remained chairman of the Joint Chiefs, with the Joint Staff largely the same. At the FBI, Director \nFreeh and Assistant Director for Counterterrorism Dale Watson remained. Working-level counterterrorism officials \nat the State Department and the Pentagon stayed on, as is typically the case. The changes were at the cabinet and \nsubcabinet level and in the CSG's reporting arrangements. At the subcabinet level, there were significant delays in \nthe confirmation of key officials, particularly at the Defense Department.\n\nThe procedures of the Bush administration were to be at once more formal and less formal than its predecessor's. \nPresident Clinton, a voracious reader, received his daily intelligence briefings in writing. He often scrawled \nquestions and comments in the margins, eliciting written responses. The new president, by contrast, reinstated the \npractice of face-to-face briefings from the DCI. President Bush and Tenet met in the Oval Office at 8:00 A. M. , with \nVice President Cheney, Rice, and Card usually also present. The President and the DCI both told us that these \ndaily sessions provided a useful opportunity for exchanges on intelligence issues.  \n\nThe President talked with Rice every day, and she in turn talked by phone at least daily with Powell and Rumsfeld. \nAs a result, the President often felt less\n\nneed for formal meetings. If, however, he decided that an event or an issue called for action, Rice would typically \ncall on Hadley to have the Deputies Committee develop and review options. The President said that this process \noften tried his patience but that he understood the necessity for coordination.  \n\nEarly Decisions \n\nWithin the first few days after Bush's inauguration, Clarke approached Rice in an effort to get her - and the new \nPresident - to give terrorism very high priority and to act on the agenda that he had pushed during the last few \nmonths of the previous administration. After Rice requested that all senior staff identify desirable major policy \nreviews or initiatives, Clarke submitted an elaborate memorandum on January 25, 2001. He attached to it his 1998 \nDelenda Plan and the December 2000 strategy paper. \"We urgently need . . . a Principals level review on the al \nQida network, \" Clarke wrote.  \n\nHe wanted the Principals Committee to decide whether al Qaeda was \"a first order threat\" or a more modest worry \nbeing overblown by \"chicken little\" alarmists. Alluding to the transition briefing that he had prepared for Rice, Clarke \n\n\n\nwrote that al Qaeda \"is not some narrow, little terrorist issue that needs to be included in broader regional policy. \n\"Two key decisions that had been deferred, he noted, concerned covert aid to keep the Northern Alliance alive \nwhen fighting began again in Afghanistan in the spring, and covert aid to the Uzbeks. Clarke also suggested that \ndecisions should be made soon on messages to the Taliban and Pakistan over the al Qaeda sanctuary in \nAfghanistan, on possible new money for CIA operations, and on \"when and how . . . to respond to the attack on the \nUSS Cole. \"  \n\nThe national security advisor did not respond directly to Clarke's memorandum. No Principals Committee meeting \non al Qaeda was held until September 4, 2001 (although the Principals Committee met frequently on other subjects, \nsuch as the Middle East peace process, Russia, and the Persian Gulf ).   But Rice and Hadley began to address the \nissues Clarke had listed. What to do or say about the Cole had been an obvious question since inauguration day. \nWhen the attack occurred, 25 days before the election, candidate Bush had said to CNN, \"I hope that we can \ngather enough intelligence to figure out who did the act and take the necessary action. There must be a \nconsequence. \"   Since the Clinton administration had not responded militarily, what was the Bush administration to \ndo?\n\nOn January 25, Tenet briefed the President on the Cole investigation. The written briefing repeated for top officials \nof the new administration what the CIA had told the Clinton White House in November. This included the \n\"preliminary judgment\" that al Qaeda was responsible, with the caveat that no evidence had yet been found that Bin \nLadin himself ordered the attack. Tenet told us he had no recollection of a conversation with the President about \nthis briefing.  \n\nIn his January 25 memo, Clarke had advised Rice that the government should respond to the Cole attack, but \n\"should take advantage of the policy that\n\n'we will respond at a time, place and manner of our own choosing' and not be forced into knee-jerk responses. \"   \nBefore Vice President Cheney visited the CIA in mid-February, Clarke sent him a memo - outside the usual White \nHouse document-management system - suggesting that he ask CIA officials \"what additional information is needed \nbefore CIA can definitively conclude that al-Qida was responsible\" for the Cole .   In March 2001, the CIA's briefing \nslides for Rice were still describing the CIA's \"preliminary judgment\" that a \"strong circumstantial case\" could be \nmade against al Qaeda but noting that the CIA continued to lack \"conclusive information on external command and \ncontrol\" of the attack.   Clarke and his aides continued to provide Rice and Hadley with evidence reinforcing the \ncase against al Qaeda and urging action.  \n\nThe President explained to us that he had been concerned lest an ineffectual air strike just serve to give Bin Ladin a \npropaganda advantage. He said he had not been told about Clinton administration warnings to the Taliban. The \nPresident told us that he had concluded that the United States must use ground forces for a job like this.  \n\nRice told us that there was never a formal, recorded decision not to retaliate specifically for the Cole attack. \nExchanges with the President, between the President and Tenet, and between herself and Powell and Rumsfeld \nhad produced a consensus that \"tit-for-tat\" responses were likely to be counterproductive. This had been the case, \nshe thought, with the cruise missile strikes of August 1998. The new team at the Pentagon did not push for action. \nOn the contrary, Rumsfeld thought that too much time had passed and his deputy, Paul Wolfowitz, thought that the \nCole attack was \"stale. \"Hadley said that in the end, the administration's real response to the Cole would be a new, \nmore aggressive strategy against al Qaeda.  \n\nThe administration decided to propose to Congress a substantial increase in counterterrorism funding for national \nsecurity agencies, including the CIA and the FBI. This included a 27 percent increase in counterterrorism funding \nfor the CIA.  \n\nStarting a Review \n\nIn early March, the administration postponed action on proposals for increasing aid to the Northern Alliance and the \nUzbeks. Rice noted at the time that a more wide-ranging examination of policy toward Afghanistan was needed \nfirst. She wanted the review very soon.  \n\n\n\nRice and others recalled the President saying, \"I'm tired of swatting at flies. \"   The President reportedly also said, \n\"I'm tired of playing defense. I want to play offense. I want to take the fight to the terrorists. \"   President Bush \nexplained to us that he had become impatient. He apparently had heard proposals for rolling back al Qaeda but felt \nthat catching terrorists one by one or even cell by cell was not an approach likely to succeed in the long run. At the \nsame time, he said, he understood that policy had to be developed slowly so that diplomacy and financial and \nmilitary measures could mesh with one another.  \n\nHadley convened an informal Deputies Committee meeting on March 7, when some of the deputies had not yet \nbeen confirmed. For the first time, Clarke's various proposals - for aid to the Northern Alliance and the Uzbeks and \nfor Predator missions - went before the group that, in the Bush NSC, would do most of the policy work. Though they \nmade no decisions on these specific proposals, Hadley apparently concluded that there should be a presidential \nnational security policy directive (NSPD) on terrorism.  \n\nClarke would later express irritation about the deputies' insistence that a strategy for coping with al Qaeda be \nframed within the context of a regional policy. He doubted that the benefits would compensate for the time lost. The \nadministration had in fact proceeded with Principals Committee meetings on topics including Iraq and Sudan \nwithout prior contextual review, and Clarke favored moving ahead similarly with a narrow counterterrorism agenda.   \nBut the President's senior advisers saw the al Qaeda problem as part of a puzzle that could not be assembled \nwithout filling in the pieces for Afghanistan and Pakistan. Rice deferred a Principals Committee meeting on al \nQaeda until the deputies had developed a new policy for their consideration.\n\nThe full Deputies Committee discussed al Qaeda on April 30. CIA briefing slides described al Qaeda as the \"most \ndangerous group we face, \" citing its \"leadership, experience, resources, safe haven in Afghanistan, [and] focus on \nattacking U. S. \"The slides warned, \"There will be more attacks. \"  \n\nAt the meeting, the deputies endorsed covert aid to Uzbekistan. Regarding the Northern Alliance, they \"agreed to \nmake no major commitment at this time. \"Washington would first consider options for aiding other anti- Taliban \ngroups.   Meanwhile, the administration would \"initiate a comprehensive review of U. S. policy on Pakistan\" and \nexplore policy options on Afghanistan, \"including the option of supporting regime change. \"   Working-level officials \nwere also to consider new steps on terrorist financing and America's perennially troubled public diplomacy efforts in \nthe Muslim world, where NSC staff warned that \"we have by and large ceded the court of public opinion\" to al \nQaeda.\n\nWhile Clarke remained concerned about the pace of the policy review, he now saw a greater possibility of \npersuading the deputies to recognize the changed nature of terrorism.   The process of fleshing out that strategy \nwas under way.\n\n6. 5 THE NEW ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH \n\nThe Bush administration in its first months faced many problems other than terrorism. They included the collapse of \nthe Middle East peace process and, in April, a crisis over a U. S. \"spy plane\" brought down in Chinese territory. The \nnew administration also focused heavily on Russia, a new nuclear strategy that allowed missile defenses, Europe, \nMexico, and the Persian Gulf.\n\nIn the spring, reporting on terrorism surged dramatically. In chapter 8, we will explore this reporting and the ways \nagencies responded. These increasingly alarming reports, briefed to the President and top officials, became part of \nthe context in which the new administration weighed its options for policy on al Qaeda.\n\nExcept for a few reports that the CSG considered and apparently judged to be unreliable, none of these pointed \nspecifically to possible al Qaeda action inside the United States - although the CSG continued to be concerned \nabout the domestic threat. The mosaic of threat intelligence came from the Counterterrorist Center, which collected \nonly abroad. Its reports were not supplemented by reports from the FBI. Clarke had expressed concern about an al \nQaeda presence in the United States, and he worried about an attack on the White House by \"Hizbollah, Hamas, al \nQida and other terrorist organizations. \"  \n\nIn May, President Bush announced that Vice President Cheney would himself lead an effort looking at preparations \nfor managing a possible attack by weapons of mass destruction and at more general problems of national \n\n\n\npreparedness. The next few months were mainly spent organizing the effort and bringing an admiral from the Sixth \nFleet back to Washington to manage it. The Vice President's task force was just getting under way when the 9/11 \nattack occurred.  \n\nOn May 29, at Tenet's request, Rice and Tenet converted their usual weekly meeting into a broader discussion on \nal Qaeda; participants included Clarke, CTC chief Cofer Black, and \"Richard, \" a group chief with authority over the \nBin Ladin unit. Rice asked about \"taking the offensive\" and whether any approach could be made to influence Bin \nLadin or the Taliban. Clarke and Black replied that the CIA's ongoing disruption activities were \"taking the offensive\" \nand that Bin Ladin could not be deterred. A wide-ranging discussion then ensued about \"breaking the back\" of Bin \nLadin's organization.  \n\nTenet emphasized the ambitious plans for covert action that the CIA had developed in December 2000. In \ndiscussing the draft authorities for this program in March, CIA officials had pointed out that the spending level \nenvisioned for these plans was larger than the CIA's entire current budget for counterterrorism covert action. It \nwould be a multiyear program, requiring such levels of spending for about five years.  \n\nThe CIA official, \"Richard, \" told us that Rice \"got it. \" He said she agreed with his conclusions about what needed to \nbe done, although he complained to us that the policy process did not follow through quickly enough.   Clarke and \nBlack were asked to develop a range of options for attacking Bin Ladin's organization, from the least to most \nambitious.  \n\nRice and Hadley asked Clarke and his staff to draw up the new presidential directive. On June 7, Hadley circulated \nthe first draft, describing it as \"an admittedly ambitious\" program for confronting al Qaeda.   The draft NSPD's goal \nwas to \"eliminate the al Qida network of terrorist groups as a\n\nthreat to the United States and to friendly governments. \" It called for a multiyear effort involving diplomacy, covert \naction, economic measures, law enforcement, public diplomacy, and if necessary military efforts. The State \nDepartment was to work with other governments to end all al Qaeda sanctuaries, and also to work with the \nTreasury Department to disrupt terrorist financing. The CIA was to develop an expanded covert action program \nincluding significant additional funding and aid to anti-Taliban groups. The draft also tasked OMB with ensuring that \nsufficient funds to support this program were found in U. S. budgets from fiscal years 2002 to 2006.  \n\nRice viewed this draft directive as the embodiment of a comprehensive new strategy employing all instruments of \nnational power to eliminate the al Qaeda threat. Clarke, however, regarded the new draft as essentially similar to \nthe proposal he had developed in December 2000 and put forward to the new administration in January 2001.   In \nMay or June, Clarke asked to be moved from his counterterrorism portfolio to a new set of responsibilities for \ncybersecurity. He told us that he was frustrated with his role and with an administration that he considered not \n\"serious about al Qaeda. \"   If Clarke was frustrated, he never expressed it to her, Rice told us.  \n\nDiplomacy in Blind Alleys \n\nAfghanistan. The new administration had already begun exploring possible diplomatic options, retracing many of \nthe paths traveled by its predecessors. U. S. envoys again pressed the Taliban to turn Bin Ladin \"over to a country \nwhere he could face justice\" and repeated, yet again, the warning that the Taliban would be held responsible for \nany al Qaeda attacks on U. S. interests.   The Taliban's representatives repeated their old arguments. Deputy \nSecretary of State Richard Armitage told us that while U. S. diplomats were becoming more active on Afghanistan \nthrough the spring and summer of 2001, \"it would be wrong for anyone to characterize this as a dramatic shift from \nthe previous administration. \"  \n\nIn deputies meetings at the end of June, Tenet was tasked to assess the prospects for Taliban cooperation with the \nUnited States on al Qaeda. The NSC staff was tasked to flesh out options for dealing with the Taliban. Revisiting \nthese issues tried the patience of some of the officials who felt they had already been down these roads and who \nfound the NSC's procedures slow. \"We weren't going fast enough, \"Armitage told us. Clarke kept arguing that \nmoves against the Taliban and al Qaeda should not have to wait months for a larger review of U. S. policy in South \nAsia. \"For the government, \" Hadley said to us, \"we moved it along as fast as we could move it along. \"  \n\n\n\nAs all hope in moving the Taliban faded, debate revived about giving covert assistance to the regime's opponents. \nClarke and the CIA's Cofer Black renewed the push to aid the Northern Alliance. Clarke suggested starting with \nmodest aid, just enough to keep the Northern Alliance in the fight and tie down al Qaeda terrorists, without aiming to \noverthrow the Taliban.  \n\nRice, Hadley, and the NSC staff member for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, told us they opposed giving aid to the \nNorthern Alliance alone. They argued that the program needed to have a big part for Pashtun opponents of the \nTaliban. They also thought the program should be conducted on a larger scale than had been suggested. Clarke \nconcurred with the idea of a larger program, but he warned that delay risked the Northern Alliance's final defeat at \nthe hands of the Taliban.  \n\nDuring the spring, the CIA, at the NSC's request, had developed draft legal authorities - a presidential finding - to \nundertake a large-scale program of covert assistance to the Taliban's foes. The draft authorities expressly stated \nthat the goal of the assistance was not to overthrow the Taliban. But even this program would be very costly. This \nwas the context for earlier conversations, when in March Tenet stressed the need to consider the impact of such a \nlarge program on the political situation in the region and in May Tenet talked to Rice about the need for a multiyear \nfinancial commitment.  \n\nBy July, the deputies were moving toward agreement that some last effort should be made to convince the Taliban \nto shift position and then, if that failed, the administration would move on the significantly enlarged covert action \nprogram. As the draft presidential directive was circulated in July, the State Department sent the deputies a lengthy \nhistorical review of U. S. efforts to engage the Taliban about Bin Ladin from 1996 on. \"These talks have been \nfruitless, \" the State Department concluded.  \n\nArguments in the summer brought to the surface the more fundamental issue of whether the U. S. covert action \nprogram should seek to overthrow the regime, intervening decisively in the civil war in order to change \nAfghanistan's government. By the end of a deputies meeting on September 10, officials formally agreed on a three-\nphase strategy. First an envoy would give the Taliban a last chance. If this failed, continuing diplomatic pressure \nwould be combined with the planned covert action program encouraging anti-Taliban Afghans of all major ethnic \ngroups to stalemate the Taliban in the civil war and attack al Qaeda bases, while the United States developed an \ninternational coalition to undermine the regime. In phase three, if the Taliban's policy still did not change, the \ndeputies agreed that the United States would try covert action to topple the Taliban's leadership from within.  \n\nThe deputies agreed to revise the al Qaeda presidential directive, then being finalized for presidential approval, in \norder to add this strategy to it. Armitage explained to us that after months of continuing the previous administration's \npolicy, he and Powell were bringing the State Department to a policy of overthrowing the Taliban. From his point of \nview, once the United States made the commitment to arm the Northern Alliance, even covertly, it was taking action \nto initiate regime change, and it should give those opponents the strength to achieve complete victory.  \n\nPakistan. The Bush administration immediately encountered the dilemmas that arose from the varied objectives the \nUnited States was trying to accom-\n\nplish in its relationship with Pakistan. In February 2001, President Bush wrote General Musharraf on a number of \nmatters. He emphasized that Bin Ladin and al Qaeda were \"a direct threat to the United States and its interests that \nmust be addressed. \" He urged Musharraf to use his influence with the Taliban on Bin Ladin and al Qaeda.   Powell \nand Armitage reviewed the possibility of acquiring more carrots to dangle in front of Pakistan. Given the generally \nnegative view of Pakistan on Capitol Hill, the idea of lifting sanctions may have seemed far-fetched, but perhaps no \nmore so than the idea of persuading Musharraf to antagonize the Islamists in his own government and nation.  \n\nOn June 18, Rice met with the visiting Pakistani foreign minister, Abdul Sattar. She \"really let him have it\" about al \nQaeda, she told us.   Other evidence corroborates her account. But, as she was upbraiding Sattar, Rice recalled \nthinking that the Pakistani diplomat seemed to have heard it all before. Sattar urged senior U. S. policymakers to \nengage the Taliban, arguing that such a course would take time but would produce results. In late June, the \ndeputies agreed to review U. S. objectives. Clarke urged Hadley to split off all other issues in U. S. -Pakistani \nrelations and just focus on demanding that Pakistan move vigorously against terrorism - to push the Pakistanis to \n\n\n\ndo before an al Qaeda attack what Washington would demand that they do after. He had made similar requests in \nthe Clinton administration; he had no more success with Rice than he had with Berger.  \n\nOn August 4, President Bush wrote President Musharraf to request his support in dealing with terrorism and to urge \nPakistan to engage actively against al Qaeda. The new administration was again registering its concerns, just as its \npredecessor had, but it was still searching for new incentives to open up diplomatic possibilities. For its part, \nPakistan had done little. Assistant Secretary of State Christina Rocca described the administration's plan to break \nthis logjam as a move from \"half engagement\" to \"enhanced engagement. \"The administration was not ready to \nconfront Islamabad and threaten to rupture relations. Deputy Secretary Armitage told us that before 9/11, the \nenvisioned new approach to Pakistan had not yet been attempted.  \n\nSaudi Arabia. The Bush administration did not develop new diplomatic initiatives on al Qaeda with the Saudi \ngovernment before 9/11. Vice President Cheney called Crown Prince Abdullah on July 5, 2001, to seek Saudi help \nin preventing threatened attacks on American facilities in the Kingdom. Secretary of State Powell met with the \ncrown prince twice before 9/11. They discussed topics like Iraq, not al Qaeda. U. S. -Saudi relations in the summer \nof 2001 were marked by sometimes heated disagreements about ongoing Israeli- Palestinian violence, not about \nBin Ladin.  \n\nMilitary Plans \n\nThe confirmation of the Pentagon's new leadership was a lengthy process. Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz was \nconfirmed in March 2001 and Under Secre-\n\ntary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith in July. Though the new officials were briefed about terrorism and some of \nthe earlier planning, including that for Operation Infinite Resolve, they were focused, as Secretary Rumsfeld told us, \non creating a twenty-first-century military.  \n\nAt the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton did not recall much interest by the new administration in military options \nagainst al Qaeda in Afghanistan. He could not recall any specific guidance on the topic from the secretary. Brian \nSheridan - the outgoing assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict (SOLIC), the \nkey counterterrorism policy office in the Pentagon - never briefed Rumsfeld. He departed on January 20; he had not \nbeen replaced by 9/11.  \n\nRumsfeld noted to us his own interest in terrorism, which came up often in his regular meetings with Tenet. He \nthought that the Defense Department, before 9/11, was not organized adequately or prepared to deal with new \nthreats like terrorism. But his time was consumed with getting new officials in place and working on the foundation \ndocuments of a new defense policy, the quadrennial defense review, the defense planning guidance, and the \nexisting contingency plans. He did not recall any particular counterterrorism issue that engaged his attention before \n9/11, other than the development of the Predator unmanned aircraft system.  \n\nThe commander of Central Command, General Franks, told us that he did not regard the existing plans as serious. \nTo him a real military plan to address al Qaeda would need to go all the way, following through the details of a full \ncampaign (including the political-military issues of where operations would be based) and securing the rights to fly \nover neighboring countries.  \n\nThe draft presidential directive circulated in June 2001 began its discussion of the military by reiterating the Defense \nDepartment's lead role in protecting its forces abroad. The draft included a section directing Secretary Rumsfeld to \n\"develop contingency plans\" to attack both al Qaeda and Taliban targets in Afghanistan. The new section did not \nspecifically order planning for the use of ground troops, or clarify how this guidance differed from the existing Infinite \nResolve plans.  \n\nHadley told us that by circulating this section, a draft Annex B to the directive, the White House was putting the \nPentagon on notice that it would need to produce new military plans to address this problem.   \"The military didn't \nparticularly want this mission, \" Rice told us.  \n\n\n\nWith this directive still awaiting President Bush's signature, Secretary Rumsfeld did not order his subordinates to \nbegin preparing any new military plans against either al Qaeda or the Taliban before 9/11.\n\nPresident Bush told us that before 9/11, he had not seen good options for special military operations against Bin \nLadin. Suitable bases in neighboring countries were not available and, even if the U. S. forces were sent in, it was \nnot clear where they would go to find Bin Ladin.  \n\nPresident Bush told us that before 9/11 there was an appetite in the government for killing Bin Ladin, not for war. \nLooking back in 2004, he equated the presidential directive with a readiness to invade Afghanistan. The problem, \nhe said, would have been how to do that if there had not been another attack on America. To many people, he said, \nit would have seemed like an ultimate act of unilateralism. But he said that he was prepared to take that on.  \n\nDomestic Change and Continuity \n\nDuring the transition, Bush had chosen John Ashcroft, a former senator from Missouri, as his attorney general. On \nhis arrival at the Justice Department, Ashcroft told us, he faced a number of problems spotlighting the need for \nreform at the FBI.  \n\nIn February, Clarke briefed Attorney General Ashcroft on his directorate's issues. He reported that at the time, the \nattorney general acknowledged a \"steep learning curve, \" and asked about the progress of the Cole investigation.   \nNeither Ashcroft nor his predecessors received the President's Daily Brief. His office did receive the daily \nintelligence report for senior officials that, during the spring and summer of 2001, was carrying much of the same \nthreat information.\n\nThe FBI was struggling to build up its institutional capabilities to do more against terrorism, relying on a strategy \ncalled MAXCAP 05 that had been unveiled in the summer of 2000. The FBI's assistant director for counterterrorism, \nDale Watson, told us that he felt the new Justice Department leadership was not supportive of the strategy. Watson \nhad the sense that the Justice Department wanted the FBI to get back to the investigative basics: guns, drugs, and \ncivil rights. The new administration did seek an 8 percent increase in overall FBI funding in its initial budget proposal \nfor fiscal year 2002, including the largest proposed percentage increase in the FBI's counterterrorism program since \nfiscal year 1997. The additional funds included the FBI's support of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, \nUtah (a onetime increase), enhanced security at FBI facilities, and improvements to the FBI's WMD incident \nresponse capability.  \n\nIn May, the Justice Department began shaping plans for building a budget for fiscal year 2003, the process that \nwould usually culminate in an administration proposal at the beginning of 2002. On May 9, the attorney general \ntestified at a congressional hearing concerning federal efforts to combat terrorism. He said that \"one of the nation's \nmost fundamental responsibilities is to protect its citizens . . . from terrorist attacks. \" The budget guidance issued \nthe next day, however, highlighted gun crimes, narcotics trafficking, and civil rights as priorities. Watson told us that \nhe almost fell out of his chair when he saw this memo, because it did not mention counterterrorism. Longtime FBI \nDirector Louis Freeh left in June 2001, after announcing the indictment in the Khobar Towers case that he had \nworked so long to obtain. Thomas Pickard was the act-\n\ning director during the summer. Freeh's successor, Robert Mueller, took office just before 9/11.  \n\nThe Justice Department prepared a draft fiscal year 2003 budget that maintained but did not increase the funding \nlevel for counterterrorism in its pending fiscal year 2002 proposal. Pickard appealed for more counterterrorism \nenhancements, an appeal the attorney general denied on September 10.  \n\nAshcroft had also inherited an ongoing debate on whether and how to modify the 1995 procedures governing \nintelligence sharing between the FBI and the Justice Department's Criminal Division. But in August 2001, Ashcroft's \ndeputy, Larry Thompson, issued a memorandum reaffirming the 1995 procedures with the clarification that \nevidence of \"any federal felony\" was to be immediately reported by the FBI to the Criminal Division. The 1995 \nprocedures remained in effect until after 9/11.  \n\nCovert Action and the Predator \n\n\n\nIn March 2001, Rice asked the CIA to prepare a new series of authorities for covert action in Afghanistan. Rice's \nrecollection was that the idea had come from Clarke and the NSC senior director for intelligence, Mary McCarthy, \nand had been linked to the proposal for aid to the Northern Alliance and the Uzbeks. Rice described the draft \ndocument as providing for \"consolidation plus, \" superseding the various Clinton administration documents. In fact, \nthe CIA drafted two documents. One was a finding that did concern aid to opponents of the Taliban regime; the \nother was a draft Memorandum of Notification, which included more open-ended language authorizing possible \nlethal action in a variety of situations. Tenet delivered both to Hadley on March 28. The CIA's notes for Tenet \nadvised him that \"in response to the NSC request for drafts that will help the policymakers review their options, \neach of the documents has been crafted to provide the Agency with the broadest possible discretion permissible \nunder the law. \"At the meeting, Tenet argued for deciding on a policy before deciding on the legal authorities to \nimplement it. Hadley accepted this argument, and the draft MON was put on hold.  \n\nAs the policy review moved forward, the planned covert action program for Afghanistan was included in the draft \npresidential directive, as part of an \"Annex A\" on intelligence activities to \"eliminate the al Qaeda threat. \"   The \nmain debate during the summer of 2001 concentrated on the one new mechanism for a lethal attack on Bin Ladin - \nan armed version of the Predator drone.\n\nIn the first months of the new administration, questions concerning the Predator became more and more a central \nfocus of dispute. Clarke favored resuming Predator flights over Afghanistan as soon as weather permitted, hoping \nthat they still might provide the elusive \"actionable intelligence\" to target Bin Ladin with cruise missiles. Learning \nthat the Air Force was thinking of\n\nequipping Predators with warheads, Clarke became even more enthusiastic about redeployment.  \n\nThe CTC chief, Cofer Black, argued against deploying the Predator for reconnaissance purposes. He recalled that \nthe Taliban had spotted a Predator in the fall of 2000 and scrambled their MiG fighters. Black wanted to wait until \nthe armed version was ready. \"I do not believe the possible recon value outweighs the risk of possible program \ntermination when the stakes are raised by the Taliban parading a charred Predator in front of CNN, \" he wrote. \nMilitary officers in the Joint Staff shared this concern.   There is some dispute as to whether or not the Deputies \nCommittee endorsed resuming reconnaissance flights at its April 30, 2001, meeting. In any event, Rice and Hadley \nultimately went along with the CIA and the Pentagon, holding off on reconnaissance flights until the armed Predator \nwas ready.  \n\nThe CIA's senior management saw problems with the armed Predator as well, problems that Clarke and even Black \nand Allen were inclined to minimize. One (which also applied to reconnaissance flights) was money. A Predator \ncost about $3 million. If the CIA flew Predators for its own reconnaissance or covert action purposes, it might be \nable to borrow them from the Air Force, but it was not clear that the Air Force would bear the cost if a vehicle went \ndown. Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz took the position that the CIA should have to pay for it; the CIA \ndisagreed.  \n\nSecond, Tenet in particular questioned whether he, as Director of Central Intelligence, should operate an armed \nPredator. \"This was new ground, \"he told us. Tenet ticked off key questions:What is the chain of command? Who \ntakes the shot? Are America's leaders comfortable with the CIA doing this, going outside of normal military \ncommand and control? Charlie Allen told us that when these questions were discussed at the CIA, he and the \nAgency's executive director, A. B. \"Buzzy\" Krongard, had said that either one of them would be happy to pull the \ntrigger, but Tenet was appalled, telling them that they had no authority to do it, nor did he.  \n\nThird, the Hellfire warhead carried by the Predator needed work. It had been built to hit tanks, not people. It needed \nto be designed to explode in a different way, and even then had to be targeted with extreme precision. In the \nconfiguration planned by the Air Force through mid-2001, the Predator's missile would not be able to hit a moving \nvehicle.  \n\nWhite House officials had seen the Predator video of the \"man in white. \" On July 11, Hadley tried to hurry along \npreparation of the armed system. He directed McLaughlin, Wolfowitz, and Joint Chiefs Vice Chairman Richard \nMyers to deploy Predators capable of being armed no later than September 1. He also directed that they have cost-\nsharing arrangements in place by August 1. Rice told us that this attempt by Hadley to dictate a solution had failed \nand that she eventually had to intervene herself.  \n\n\n\nOn August 1, the Deputies Committee met again to discuss the armed\n\nPredator. They concluded that it was legal for the CIA to kill Bin Ladin or one of his deputies with the Predator. Such \nstrikes would be acts of self-defense that would not violate the ban on assassinations in Executive Order 12333. \nThe big issues - who would pay for what, who would authorize strikes, and who would pull the trigger - were left for \nthe principals to settle. The Defense Department representatives did not take positions on these issues.  \n\nThe CIA's McLaughlin had also been reticent. When Hadley circulated a memorandum attempting to prod the \ndeputies to reach agreement, McLaughlin sent it back with a handwritten comment on the cost-sharing:\"we \nquestion whether it is advisable to make such an investment before the decision is taken on flying an armed \nPredator. \" For Clarke, this came close to being a final straw. He angrily asked Rice to call Tenet. \"Either al Qida is \na threat worth acting against or it is not, \" Clarke wrote. \"CIA leadership has to decide which it is and cease these \nbi-polar mood swings. \"  \n\nThese debates, though, had little impact in advancing or delaying efforts to make the Predator ready for combat. \nThose were in the hands of military officers and engineers. General John Jumper had commanded U. S. air forces \nin Europe and seen Predators used for reconnaissance in the Balkans. He started the program to develop an \narmed version and, after returning in 2000 to head the Air Combat Command, took direct charge of it.\n\nThere were numerous technical problems, especially with the Hellfire missiles. The Air Force tests conducted \nduring the spring were inadequate, so missile testing needed to continue and modifications needed to be made \nduring the summer. Even then, Jumper told us, problems with the equipment persisted. Nevertheless, the Air Force \nwas moving at an extraordinary pace. \"In the modern era, since the 1980s, \" Jumper said to us, \"I would be \nshocked if you found anything that went faster than this. \"  \n\nSeptember 2001 \n\nThe Principals Committee had its first meeting on al Qaeda on September 4. On the day of the meeting, Clarke sent \nRice an impassioned personal note. He criticized U. S. counterterrorism efforts past and present. The \"real \nquestion\" before the principals, he wrote, was \"are we serious about dealing with the al Qida threat? . . . Is al Qida a \nbig deal? . . . Decision makers should imagine themselves on a future day when the CSG has not succeeded in \nstopping al Qida attacks and hundreds of Americans lay dead in several countries, including the US, \" Clarke wrote. \n\"What would those decision makers wish that they had done earlier? That future day could happen at any time. \"  \n\nClarke then turned to the Cole . \" The fact that the USS Cole was attacked during the last Administration does not \nabsolve us of responding for the attack , \" he wrote. \"Many in al Qida and the Taliban may have drawn the wrong \nlesson from the Cole: that they can kill Americans without there being a US response, without there being a price. . . \n. One might have thought that with a $250m hole\n\nin a destroyer and 17 dead sailors, the Pentagon might have wanted to respond. Instead, they have often talked \nabout the fact that there is 'nothing worth hitting in Afghanistan' and said 'the cruise missiles cost more than the \njungle gyms and mud huts' at terrorist camps. \" Clarke could not understand \" why we continue to allow the \nexistence of large scale al Qida bases where we know people are being trained to kill Americans . \"  \n\nTurning to the CIA, Clarke warned that its bureaucracy, which was \"masterful at passive aggressive behavior, \" \nwould resist funding the new national security presidential directive, leaving it a \"hollow shell of words without \ndeeds. \"The CIA would insist its other priorities were more important. Invoking President Bush's own language, \nClarke wrote, \" You are left with a modest effort to swat flies , to try to prevent specific al Qida attacks by using \n[intelligence] to detect them and friendly governments' police and intelligence officers to stop them. You are left \nwaiting for the big attack , with lots of casualties, after which some major US retaliation will be in order[. ]\"  \n\nRice told us she took Clarke's memo as a warning not to get dragged down by bureaucratic inertia.   While his \narguments have force, we also take Clarke's jeremiad as something more. After nine years on the NSC staff and \nmore than three years as the president's national coordinator, he had often failed to persuade these agencies to \nadopt his views, or to persuade his superiors to set an agenda of the sort he wanted or that the whole government \ncould support.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, another counterterrorism veteran, Cofer Black, was preparing his boss for the principals meeting. He \nadvised Tenet that the draft presidential directive envisioned an ambitious covert action program, but that the \nauthorities for it had not yet been approved and the funding still had not been found. If the CIA was reluctant to use \nthe Predator, Black did not mention it. He wanted \"a timely decision from the Principals, \" adding that the window for \nmissions within 2001 was a short one. The principals would have to decide whether Rice, Tenet, Rumsfeld, or \nsomeone else would give the order to fire.  \n\nAt the September 4 meeting, the principals approved the draft presidential directive with little discussion.   Rice told \nus that she had, at some point, told President Bush that she and his other advisers thought it would take three \nyears or so for their al Qaeda strategy to work.   They then discussed the armed Predator.\n\nHadley portrayed the Predator as a useful tool, although perhaps not for immediate use. Rice, who had been \nadvised by her staff that the armed Predator was not ready for deployment, commented about the potential for \nusing the armed Predator in the spring of 2002.  \n\nThe State Department supported the armed Predator, although Secretary Powell was not convinced that Bin Ladin \nwas as easy to target as had been suggested. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill was skittish, cautioning about the \nimplications of trying to kill an individual.  \n\nThe Defense Department favored strong action. Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz questioned the United States' ability to \ndeliver Bin Ladin and bring him to justice. He favored going after Bin Ladin as part of a larger air strike, similar to \nwhat had been done in the 1986 U. S. strike against Libya. General Myers emphasized the Predator's value for \nsurveillance, perhaps enabling broader air strikes that would go beyond Bin Ladin to attack al Qaeda's training \ninfrastructure.  \n\nThe principals also discussed which agency - CIA or Defense - should have the authority to fire a missile from the \narmed Predator.  \n\nAt the end, Rice summarized the meeting's conclusions. The armed Predator capability was needed but not ready. \nThe Predator would be available for the military to consider along with its other options. The CIA should consider \nflying reconnaissance-only missions. The principals - including the previously reluctant Tenet - thought that such \nreconnaissance flights were a good idea, combined with other efforts to get actionable intelligence. Tenet deferred \nan answer on the additional reconnaissance flights, conferred with his staff after the meeting, and then directed the \nCIA to press ahead with them.  \n\nA few days later, a final version of the draft presidential directive was circulated, incorporating two minor changes \nmade by the principals.  \n\nOn September 9, dramatic news arrived from Afghanistan. The leader of the Northern Alliance, Ahmed Shah \nMassoud, had granted an interview in his bungalow near the Tajikistan border with two men whom the Northern \nAlliance leader had been told were Arab journalists. The supposed reporter and cameraman - actually al Qaeda \nassassins - then set off a bomb, riddling Massoud's chest with shrapnel. He died minutes later.\n\nOn September 10, Hadley gathered the deputies to finalize their threephase, multiyear plan to pressure and \nperhaps ultimately topple the Taliban leadership.  \n\nThat same day, Hadley instructed DCI Tenet to have the CIA prepare new draft legal authorities for the \"broad \ncovert action program\" envisioned by the draft presidential directive. Hadley also directed Tenet to prepare a \nseparate section \"authorizing a broad range of other covert activities, including authority to capture or to use lethal \nforce\" against al Qaeda command-and-control elements. This section would supersede the Clinton-era documents. \nHadley wanted the authorities to be flexible and broad enough \"to cover any additional UBL-related covert actions \ncontemplated. \"  \n\nFunding still needed to be located. The military component remained unclear. Pakistan remained uncooperative. \nThe domestic policy institutions were largely uninvolved. But the pieces were coming together for an integrated \npolicy dealing with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and Pakistan.\n\n7 THE ATTACK LOOMS \n\n\n\n7. 1 FIRST ARRIVALS IN CALIFORNIA \n\nIn chapter 5 we described the Southeast Asia travels of Nawaf al Hazmi, Khalid al Mihdhar, and others in January \n2000 on the first part of the \"planes operation. \" In that chapter we also described how Mihdhar was spotted in \nKuala Lumpur early in January 2000, along with associates who were not identified, and then was lost to sight when \nthe group passed through Bangkok. On January 15, Hazmi and Mihdhar arrived in Los Angeles. They spent about \ntwo weeks there before moving on to San Diego.  \n\nTwo Weeks in Los Angeles \n\nWhy Hazmi and Mihdhar came to California, we do not know for certain. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM), the \norganizer of the planes operation, explains that California was a convenient point of entry from Asia and had the \nadded benefit of being far away from the intended target area.  \n\nHazmi and Mihdhar were ill-prepared for a mission in the United States. Their only qualifications for this plot were \ntheir devotion to Usama Bin Ladin, their veteran service, and their ability to get valid U. S. visas. Neither had spent \nany substantial time in the West, and neither spoke much, if any, English.  \n\nIt would therefore be plausible that they or KSM would have tried to identify, in advance, a friendly contact for them \nin the United States. In detention, KSM denies that al Qaeda had any agents in Southern California. We do not \ncredit this denial.   We believe it is unlikely that Hazmi and Mihdhar - neither of whom, in contrast to the Hamburg \ngroup, had any prior exposure to life in the West - would have come to the United States without arranging to \nreceive assistance from one or more individuals informed in advance of their arrival.  \n\nKSM says that though he told others involved in the conspiracy to stay away from mosques and to avoid \nestablishing personal contacts, he made an exception in this case and instructed Hazmi and Mihdhar to pose as \nnewly arrived\n\nSaudi students and seek assistance at local mosques. He counted on their breaking off any such relationships once \nthey moved to the East Coast.   Our inability to ascertain the activities of Hazmi and Mihdhar during their first two \nweeks in the United States may reflect al Qaeda tradecraft designed to protect the identity of anyone who may have \nassisted them during that period.\n\nHazmi and Mihdhar were directed to enroll in English-language classes upon arriving in Southern California, so that \nthey could begin pilot training as soon as possible. KSM claims to have steered the two to San Diego on the basis \nof his own research, which supposedly included thumbing through a San Diego phone book acquired at a Karachi \nflea market. Contradicting himself, he also says that, as instructed, they attempted to enroll in three language \nschools in Los Angeles.  \n\nAfter the pair cleared Immigration and Customs at Los Angeles International Airport, we do not know where they \nwent.   They appear to have obtained assistance from the Muslim community, specifically the community \nsurrounding the King Fahd mosque in Culver City, one of the most prominent mosques in Southern California.\n\nIt is fairly certain that Hazmi and Mihdhar spent time at the King Fahd mosque and made some acquaintances \nthere. One witness interviewed by the FBI after the September 11 attacks has said he first met the hijackers at the \nmosque in early 2000. Furthermore, one of the people who would befriend them - a man named Mohdar Abdullah - \nrecalled a trip with Hazmi and Mihdhar to Los Angeles in June when, on their arrival, the three went to the King \nFahd mosque. There Hazmi and Mihdhar greeted various individuals whom they appeared to have met previously, \nincluding a man named \"Khallam. \" In Abdullah's telling, when Khallam visited the al Qaeda operatives at their \nmotel that evening, Abdullah was asked to leave the room so that Hazmi, Mihdhar, and Khallam could meet in \nprivate. The identity of Khallam and his purpose in meeting with Hazmi and Mihdhar remain unknown.  \n\nTo understand what Hazmi and Mihdhar did in their first weeks in the United States, evidently staying in Los \nAngeles, we have investigated whether anyone associated with the King Fahd mosque assisted them. This subject \nhas received substantial attention in the media. Some have speculated that Fahad al Thumairy - an imam at the \nmosque and an accredited diplomat at the Saudi Arabian consulate from 1996 until 2003 - may have played a role \n\n\n\nin helping the hijackers establish themselves on their arrival in Los Angeles. This speculation is based, at least in \npart, on Thumairy's reported leadership of an extremist faction at the mosque.  \n\nA well-known figure at the King Fahd mosque and within the Los Angeles Muslim community, Thumairy was \nreputed to be an Islamic fundamentalist and a strict adherent to orthodox Wahhabi doctrine. Some Muslims \nconcerned about his preaching have said he \"injected non-Islamic themes into his guidance/prayers at the [King \nFahd] Mosque\" and had followers \"supportive of the events of September 11, 2001. \"   Thumairy appears to have \nassoci-\n\nated with a particularly radical faction within the community of local worshippers, and had a network of contacts in \nother cities in the United States. After 9/11, Thumairy's conduct was a subject of internal debate among some Saudi \nofficials. He apparently lost his position at the King Fahd mosque, possibly because of his immoderate reputation. \nOn May 6, 2003, Thumairy attempted to reenter the United States from Saudi Arabia but was refused entry, based \non a determination by the State Department that he might be connected with terrorist activity.  \n\nWhen interviewed by both the FBI and the Commission staff, Thumairy has denied preaching anti-Western \nsermons, much less promoting violent jihad. More to the point, he claimed not to recognize either Hazmi or \nMihdhar. Both denials are somewhat suspect. (He likewise denied knowing Omar al Bayoumi - a man from San \nDiego we will discuss shortly - even though witnesses and telephone records establish that the two men had \ncontact with each other. Similarly, Thumairy's claim not to know Mohdar Abdullah is belied by Abdullah's contrary \nassertion. ) On the other hand, Thumairy undoubtedly met with and provided religious counseling to countless \nindividuals during his tenure at the King Fahd mosque, so he might not remember two transients like Hazmi and \nMihdhar several years later.  \n\nThe circumstantial evidence makes Thumairy a logical person to consider as a possible contact for Hazmi and \nMihdhar. Yet, after exploring the available leads, we have not found evidence that Thumairy provided assistance to \nthe two operatives.  \n\nWe do not pick up their trail until February 1, 2000, when they encountered Omar al Bayoumi and Caysan Bin Don \nat a halal food restaurant on Venice Boulevard in Culver City, a few blocks away from the King Fahd mosque. \nBayoumi and Bin Don have both told us that they had driven up from San Diego earlier that day so that Bayoumi \ncould address a visa issue and collect some papers from the Saudi consulate. Bayoumi heard Hazmi and Mihdhar \nspeaking in what he recognized to be Gulf Arabic and struck up a conversation. Since Bin Don knew only a little \nArabic, he had to rely heavily on Bayoumi to translate for him.  \n\nMihdhar and Hazmi said they were students from Saudi Arabia who had just arrived in the United States to study \nEnglish. They said they were living in an apartment near the restaurant but did not specify the address. They did not \nlike Los Angeles and were having a hard time, especially because they did not know anyone. Bayoumi told them \nhow pleasant San Diego was and offered to help them settle there. The two pairs then left the restaurant and went \ntheir separate ways.  \n\nBayoumi and Bin Don have been interviewed many times about the February 1, 2000, lunch. For the most part, \ntheir respective accounts corroborate each other. However, Bayoumi has said that he and Bin Don attempted to \nvisit the King Fahd mosque after lunch but could not find it. Bin Don, on the other\n\nhand, recalls visiting the mosque twice that day for prayers, both before and after the meal. Bin Don's recollection is \nspotty and inconsistent. Bayoumi's version can be challenged as well, since the mosque is close to the restaurant \nand Bayoumi had visited it, and the surrounding area, on multiple occasions, including twice within six weeks of \nFebruary 1. We do not know whether the lunch encounter occurred by chance or design. We know about it because \nBayoumi told law enforcement that it happened.  \n\nBayoumi, then 42 years old, was in the United States as a business student, supported by a private contractor for \nthe Saudi Civil Aviation Authority, where Bayoumi had worked for over 20 years.   The object of considerable media \nspeculation following 9/11, he lives now in Saudi Arabia, well aware of his notoriety. Both we and the FBI have \ninterviewed him and investigated evidence about him.\n\nBayoumi is a devout Muslim, obliging and gregarious. He spent much of his spare time involved in religious study \nand helping run a mosque in El Cajon, about 15 miles from San Diego. It is certainly possible that he has \n\n\n\ndissembled about some aspects of his story, perhaps to counter suspicion. On the other hand, we have seen no \ncredible evidence that he believed in violent extremism or knowingly aided extremist groups.   Our investigators \nwho have dealt directly with him and studied his background find him to be an unlikely candidate for clandestine \ninvolvement with Islamist extremists.\n\nThe Move to San Diego \n\nBy February 4, Hazmi and Mihdhar had come to San Diego from Los Angeles, possibly driven by Mohdar Abdullah. \nAbdullah, a Yemeni university student in his early 20s, is fluent in both Arabic and English, and was perfectly suited \nto assist the hijackers in pursuing their mission.  \n\nAfter 9/11, Abdullah was interviewed many times by the FBI. He admitted knowing of Hazmi and Mihdhar's \nextremist leanings and Mihdhar's involvement with the Islamic Army of Aden (a group with ties to al Qaeda) back in \nYemen. Abdullah clearly was sympathetic to those extremist views. During a post-9/11 search of his possessions, \nthe FBI found a notebook (belonging to someone else) with references to planes falling from the sky, mass killing, \nand hijacking. Further, when detained as a material witness following the 9/11 attacks, Abdullah expressed hatred \nfor the U. S. government and \"stated that the U. S. brought 'this' on themselves. \"  \n\nWhen interviewed by the FBI after 9/11, Abdullah denied having advance knowledge of attacks. In May 2004, \nhowever, we learned of reports about Abdullah bragging to fellow inmates at a California prison in September- \nOctober 2003 that he had known Hazmi and Mihdhar were planning a terrorist attack. The stories attributed to \nAbdullah are not entirely consistent with each other. Specifically, according to one inmate, Abdullah claimed an \nunnamed individual had notified him that Hazmi and Mihdhar would be arriv-\n\ning in Los Angeles with plans to carry out an attack. Abdullah allegedly told the same inmate that he had driven the \ntwo al Qaeda operatives from Los Angeles to San Diego, but did not say when this occurred. We have been unable \nto corroborate this account.  \n\nAnother inmate has recalled Abdullah claiming he first heard about the hijackers' terrorist plans after they arrived in \nSan Diego, when they told him they planned to fly an airplane into a building and invited him to join them on the \nplane. According to this inmate, Abdullah also claimed to have found out about the 9/11 attacks three weeks in \nadvance, a claim that appears to dovetail with evidence that Abdullah may have received a phone call from Hazmi \naround that time, that he stopped making calls from his telephone after August 25, 2001, and that, according to his \nfriends, he started acting strangely.  \n\nAlthough boasts among prison inmates often tend to be unreliable, this evidence is obviously important. To date, \nneither we nor the FBI have been able to verify Abdullah's alleged jailhouse statements, despite investigative \nefforts.\n\nWe thus do not know when or how Hazmi and Mihdhar first came to San Diego. We do know that on February 4, \nthey went to the Islamic Center of San Diego to find Omar al Bayoumi and take him up on his offer of help. Bayoumi \nobliged by not only locating an apartment but also helping them fill out the lease application, co-signing the lease \nand, when the real estate agent refused to take cash for a deposit, helping them open a bank account (which they \ndid with a $9, 900 deposit); he then provided a certified check from his own account for which the al Qaeda \noperatives reimbursed him on the spot for the deposit. Neither then nor later did Bayoumi give money to either \nHazmi or Mihdhar, who had received money from KSM.  \n\nHazmi and Mihdhar moved in with no furniture and practically no possessions. Soon after the move, Bayoumi used \ntheir apartment for a party attended by some 20 male members of the Muslim community. At Bayoumi's request, \nBin Don videotaped the gathering with Bayoumi's video camera. Hazmi and Mihdhar did not mingle with the other \nguests and reportedly spent most of the party by themselves off camera, in a back room.  \n\nHazmi and Mihdhar immediately started looking for a different place to stay. Based on their comment to Bayoumi \nabout the first apartment being expensive, one might infer that they wanted to save money. They may also have \nbeen reconsidering the wisdom of living so close to the video camera-wielding Bayoumi, who Hazmi seemed to \nthink was some sort of Saudi spy. Just over a week after moving in, Hazmi and Mihdhar filed a 30-day notice of \n\n\n\nintention to vacate. Bayoumi apparently loaned them his cell phone to help them check out possibilities for new \naccommodations.  \n\nTheir initial effort to move turned out poorly. An acquaintance arranged with his landlord to have Mihdhar take over \nhis apartment. Mihdhar put down a $650 deposit and signed a lease for the apartment effective March 1. Several \nweeks later, Mihdhar sought a refund of his deposit, claiming he no longer\n\nintended to move in because the apartment was too messy. When the landlord refused to refund the deposit, \nMihdhar became belligerent. The landlord remembers him \"ranting and raving\" as if he were \"psychotic. \"  \n\nHazmi and Mihdhar finally found a room to rent in the home of an individual they had met at a mosque in San \nDiego. According to the homeowner, the future hijackers moved in on May 10, 2000. Mihdhar moved out after only \nabout a month. On June 9, he left San Diego to return to Yemen. Hazmi, on the other hand, stayed at this house for \nthe rest of his time in California, until mid-December; he would then leave for Arizona with a newly arrived 9/11 \nhijacker-pilot, Hani Hanjour.  \n\nWhile in San Diego, Hazmi and Mihdhar played the part of recently arrived foreign students. They continued to \nreach out to members of the Muslim community for help. At least initially, they found well-meaning new \nacquaintances at the Islamic Center of San Diego, which was only a stone's throw from the apartment where they \nfirst lived. For example, when they purchased a used car (with cash), they bought it from a man who lived across \nthe street from the Islamic Center and who let them use his address in registering the vehicle, an accommodation \n\"to help a fellow Muslim brother. \" Similarly, in April, when their cash supply may have been dwindling, Hazmi \npersuaded the administrator of the Islamic Center to let him use the administrator's bank account to receive a $5, \n000 wire transfer from someone in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates (this was KSM's nephew, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali).  \n\nHazmi and Mihdhar visited other mosques as well, mixing comfortably as devout worshippers. During the \noperatives' critical first weeks in San Diego, Mohdar Abdullah helped them. Translating between English and \nArabic, he assisted them in obtaining California driver's licenses and with applying to language and flight schools. \nAbdullah also introduced them to his circle of friends; he shared an apartment with some of those friends near the \nRabat mosque in La Mesa, a few miles from the hijackers' residence.  \n\nAbdullah has emerged as a key associate of Hazmi and Mihdhar in San Diego. Detained after 9/11 (first as a \nmaterial witness, then on immigration charges), he was deported to Yemen on May 21, 2004, after the U. S. \nAttorney for the Southern District of California declined to prosecute him on charges arising out of his alleged \njailhouse admissions concerning the 9/11 operatives. The Department of Justice declined to delay his removal \npending further investigation of this new information.  \n\nOther friends of Abdullah also translated for Hazmi and Mihdhar and helped them adjust to life in San Diego. Some \nheld extremist beliefs or were well acquainted with known extremists. For example, immediately after 9/11, Osama \nAwadallah, a Yemeni whose telephone number was found in Hazmi's Toyota at Washington Dulles International \nAirport, was found to possess photos, videos, and articles relating to Bin Ladin. Awadallah also had lived in a house \nwhere copies of Bin Ladin's fatwas and other similar materials were distributed\n\nto the residents. Omar Bakarbashat, a Saudi, also met Hazmi and Mihdhar at the Rabat mosque. He admitted \nhelping Hazmi to learn English and taking over the operatives' first apartment in San Diego after they moved out. \nBakarbashat apparently had downloaded stridently anti-American Web pages to his computer's hard drive.  \n\nAnother potentially significant San Diego contact for Hazmi and Mihdhar was Anwar Aulaqi, an imam at the Rabat \nmosque. Born in New Mexico and thus a U. S. citizen, Aulaqi grew up in Yemen and studied in the United States on \na Yemeni government scholarship. We do not know how or when Hazmi and Mihdhar first met Aulaqi. The \noperatives may even have met or at least talked to him the same day they first moved to San Diego. Hazmi and \nMihdhar reportedly respected Aulaqi as a religious figure and developed a close relationship with him.  \n\nWhen interviewed after 9/11, Aulaqi said he did not recognize Hazmi's name but did identify his picture. Although \nAulaqi admitted meeting with Hazmi several times, he claimed not to remember any specifics of what they \ndiscussed. He described Hazmi as a soft-spoken Saudi student who used to appear at the mosque with a \ncompanion but who did not have a large circle of friends.  \n\n\n\nAulaqi left San Diego in mid-2000, and by early 2001 had relocated to Virginia. As we will discuss later, Hazmi \neventually showed up at Aulaqi's mosque in Virginia, an appearance that may not have been coincidental. We have \nbeen unable to learn enough about Aulaqi's relationship with Hazmi and Mihdhar to reach a conclusion.  \n\nIn sum, although the evidence is thin as to specific motivations, our overall impression is that soon after arriving in \nCalifornia, Hazmi and Mihdhar sought out and found a group of young and ideologically like-minded Muslims with \nroots in Yemen and Saudi Arabia, individuals mainly associated with Mohdar Abdullah and the Rabat mosque. The \nal Qaeda operatives lived openly in San Diego under their true names, listing Hazmi in the telephone directory. \nThey managed to avoid attracting much attention.\n\nFlight Training Fails; Mihdhar Bails Out \n\nHazmi and Mihdhar came to the United States to learn English, take flying lessons, and become pilots as quickly as \npossible. They turned out, however, to have no aptitude for English. Even with help and tutoring from Mohdar \nAbdullah and other bilingual friends, Hazmi and Mihdhar's efforts to learn proved futile. This lack of language skills \nin turn became an insurmountable barrier to learning how to fly.  \n\nA pilot they consulted at one school, the Sorbi Flying Club in San Diego, spoke Arabic. He explained to them that \ntheir flight instruction would begin with small planes. Hazmi and Mihdhar emphasized their interest in learning to fly \njets, Boeing aircraft in particular, and asked where they might enroll to train\n\non jets right away. Convinced that the two were either joking or dreaming, the pilot responded that no such school \nexisted. Other instructors who worked with Hazmi and Mihdhar remember them as poor students who focused on \nlearning to control the aircraft in flight but took no interest in takeoffs or landings. By the end of May 2000, Hazmi \nand Mihdhar had given up on learning how to fly.  \n\nMihdhar's mind seems to have been with his family back in Yemen, as evidenced by calls he made from the \napartment telephone. When news of the birth of his first child arrived, he could stand life in California no longer. In \nlate May and early June of 2000, he closed his bank account, transferred the car registration to Hazmi, and \narranged his return to Yemen. According to KSM, Mihdhar was bored in San Diego and foresaw no problem in \ncoming back to the United States since he had not overstayed his visa. Hazmi and Mohdar Abdullah accompanied \nhim to Los Angeles on June 9. After visiting the King Fahd mosque one last time with his friends, Mihdhar left the \ncountry the following day.  \n\nKSM kept in fairly close touch with his operatives, using a variety of methods. When Bin Ladin called KSM back \nfrom Pakistan to Afghanistan in the spring of 2000, KSM asked Khallad (whom we introduced in chapter 5) to \nmaintain email contact with Hazmi in the United States. Mihdhar's decision to strand Hazmi in San Diego enraged \nKSM, who had not authorized the departure and feared it would compromise the plan. KSM attempted to drop \nMihdhar from the planes operation and would have done so, he says, had he not been overruled by Bin Ladin.  \n\nFollowing Mihdhar's departure, Hazmi grew lonely and worried that he would have trouble managing by himself. He \nprayed with his housemate each morning at 5:00 A. M. and attended services at the Islamic Center. He borrowed \nhis housemate's computer for Internet access, following news coverage of fighting in Chechnya and Bosnia. With \nhis housemate's help, Hazmi also used the Internet to search for a wife (after obtaining KSM's approval to marry). \nThis search did not succeed. Although he developed a close relationship with his housemate, Hazmi preferred not \nto use the house telephone, continuing the practice he and Mihdhar had adopted of going outside to make phone \ncalls.  \n\nAfter Mihdhar left, other students moved into the house. One of these, Yazeed al Salmi, stands out. In July 2000, \nSalmi purchased $4, 000 in traveler's checks at a bank in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. On September 5, Hazmi deposited \n$1, 900 of the traveler's checks into his bank account, after withdrawing the same amount in cash. It is possible that \nHazmi was simply cashing the traveler's checks for a friend. We do not know; Salmi claims not to remember the \ntransaction. After 9/11, Salmi reportedly confided to Mohdar Abdullah that he had previously known terrorist pilot \nHani Hanjour. After living in the same house with Hazmi for about a month, Salmi moved to the La Mesa apartment \nshared by Abdullah and others.  \n\n\n\nBy the fall of 2000, Hazmi no longer even pretended to study English or take flying lessons. Aware that his co-\nconspirators in Afghanistan and Pakistan would be sending him a new colleague shortly, he bided his time and \nworked for a few weeks at a gas station in La Mesa where some of his friends, including Abdullah, were employed. \nOn one occasion, Hazmi told a fellow employee that he was planning to find a better job, and let slip a prediction \nthat he would become famous.  \n\nOn December 8, 2000, Hani Hanjour arrived in San Diego, having traveled from Dubai via Paris and Cincinnati. \nHazmi likely picked up Hanjour at the airport. We do not know where Hanjour stayed; a few days later, both men left \nSan Diego. Before departing, they visited the gas station in La Mesa, where Hazmi reportedly introduced Hanjour \nas a \"long time friend from Saudi Arabia. \" Hazmi told his housemate that he and his friend \"Hani\"were headed for \nSan Jose to take flying lessons and told his friends that he would stay in touch. Hazmi promised to return to San \nDiego soon, and he and Hanjour drove off.  \n\nHazmi did not sever all contact with his friends in San Diego. According to Abdullah, after Hazmi left San Diego in \nDecember 2000, he telephoned Abdullah twice: in December 2000 or January 2001, Hazmi said he was in San \nFrancisco and would be attending flight school there; about two weeks later, he said he was attending flight school \nin Arizona. Some evidence, which we will discuss later, indicates that Hazmi contacted Abdullah again, in August \n2001. In addition, during the month following Hazmi's departure from San Diego, he emailed his housemate three \ntimes, including a January 2001 email that Hazmi signed \"Smer, \" an apparent attempt to conceal his identity that \nstruck the housemate as strange at the time. Hazmi also telephoned his housemate that he and his friend had \ndecided to take flight lessons in Arizona, and that Mihdhar was now back in Yemen. That was their last contact. \nWhen the housemate emailed Hazmi in February and March of 2001 to find out how he was faring, Hazmi did not \nreply.  \n\nThe housemate who rented the room to Hazmi and Mihdhar during 2000 is an apparently law-abiding citizen with \nlong-standing, friendly contacts among local police and FBI personnel. He did not see anything unusual enough in \nthe behavior of Hazmi or Mihdhar to prompt him to report to his law enforcement contacts. Nor did those contacts \nask him for information about his tenants/housemates.\n\n7. 2 THE 9/11 PILOTS IN THE UNITED STATES \n\nThe Hamburg Pilots Arrive in the United States \n\nIn the early summer of 2000, the Hamburg group arrived in the United States to begin flight training. Marwan al \nShehhi came on May 29, arriving in Newark on a flight from Brussels. He went to New York City and waited there \nfor\n\nMohamed Atta to join him. On June 2, Atta traveled to the Czech Republic by bus from Germany and then flew from \nPrague to Newark the next day. According to Ramzi Binalshibh, Atta did not meet with anyone in Prague; he simply \nbelieved it would contribute to operational security to fly out of Prague rather than Hamburg, the departure point for \nmuch of his previous international travel.  \n\nAtta and Shehhi had not settled on where they would obtain their flight training. In contrast, Ziad Jarrah had already \narranged to attend the Florida Flight Training Center (FFTC) in Venice, Florida. Jarrah arrived in Newark on June \n27 and then flew to Venice. He immediately began the private pilot program at FFTC, intending to get a multi-\nengine license. Jarrah moved in with some of the flight instructors affiliated with his school and bought a car.  \n\nWhile Jarrah quickly settled into training in Florida, Atta and Shehhi kept searching for a flight school. After visiting \nthe Airman Flight School in Norman, Oklahoma (where Zacarias Moussaoui would enroll several months later and \nwhere another al Qaeda operative, Ihab Ali, had taken lessons in the mid- 1990s), Atta started flight instruction at \nHuffman Aviation in Venice, Florida, and both Atta and Shehhi subsequently enrolled in the Accelerated Pilot \nProgram at that school. By the end of July, both of them took solo flights, and by mid-August they passed the \nprivate pilot airman test. They trained through the summer at Huffman, while Jarrah continued his training at FFTC.  \n\n\n\nThe Hamburg operatives paid for their flight training primarily with funds wired from Dubai by KSM's nephew, Ali \nAbdul Aziz Ali. Between June 29 and September 17, 2000, Ali sent Shehhi and Atta a total of $114, 500 in five \ntransfers ranging from $5, 000 to $70, 000. Ali relied on the unremarkable nature of his transactions, which were \nessentially invisible amid the billions of dollars flowing daily across the globe.   Ali was not required to provide \nidentification in sending this money and the aliases he used were not questioned.  \n\nIn mid-September, Atta and Shehhi applied to change their immigration status from tourist to student, stating their \nintention to study at Huffman until September 1, 2001. In late September, they decided to enroll at Jones Aviation in \nSarasota, Florida, about 20 miles north of Venice. According to the instructor at Jones, the two were aggressive, \nrude, and sometimes even fought with him to take over the controls during their training flights. In early October, \nthey took the Stage I exam for instruments rating at Jones Aviation and failed. Very upset, they said they were in a \nhurry because jobs awaited them at home. Atta and Shehhi then returned to Huffman.  \n\nIn the meantime, Jarrah obtained a single-engine private pilot certificate in early August. Having reached that \nmilestone, he departed on the first of five foreign trips he would take after first entering the United States. In \nOctober, he flew back to Germany to visit his girlfriend, Aysel Senguen. The two traveled to Paris before Jarrah \nreturned to Florida on October 29. His relationship with her remained close throughout his time in the United States. \nIn addition\n\nto his trips, Jarrah made hundreds of phone calls to her and communicated frequently by email.  \n\nJarrah was supposed to be joined at FFTC by Ramzi Binalshibh, who even sent the school a deposit. But \nBinalshibh could not obtain a U. S. visa. His first applications in May and June 2000 were denied because he \nlacked established ties in Germany ensuring his return from a trip to the United States. In September, he went \nhome to Yemen to apply for a visa from there, but was denied on grounds that he also lacked sufficient ties to \nYemen. In October, he tried one last time, in Berlin, applying for a student visa to attend \"aviation language school, \n\" but the prior denials were noted and this application was denied as well, as incomplete.  \n\nUnable to participate directly in the operation, Binalshibh instead took on the role of coordinating between KSM and \nthe operatives in the United States. Apart from sending a total of about $10, 000 in wire transfers to Atta and Shehhi \nduring the summer of 2000, one of Binalshibh's first tasks in his new role as plot coordinator was to assist another \npossible pilot, Zacarias Moussaoui.  \n\nIn the fall of 2000, KSM had sent Moussaoui to Malaysia for flight training, but Moussaoui did not find a school he \nliked. He worked instead on other terrorist schemes, such as buying four tons of ammonium nitrate for bombs to be \nplanted on cargo planes flying to the United States. When KSM found out, he recalled Moussaoui back to Pakistan \nand directed him to go to the United States for flight training. In early October, Moussaoui went to London. When \nBinalshibh visited London in December, he stayed at the same 16-room dormitory where Moussaoui was still \nresiding. From London, Moussaoui sent inquiries to the Airman Flight School in Norman, Oklahoma.  \n\nConfronting training or travel problems with Hazmi, Mihdhar, Binalshibh, and Moussaoui, al Qaeda was looking for \nanother possible pilot candidate. A new recruit with just the right background conveniently presented himself in \nAfghanistan.\n\nThe Fourth Pilot: Hani Hanjour \n\nHani Hanjour, from Ta'if, Saudi Arabia, first came to the United States in 1991 to study at the Center for English as \na Second Language at the University of Arizona. He seems to have been a rigorously observant Muslim. According \nto his older brother, Hani Hanjour went to Afghanistan for the first time in the late 1980s, as a teenager, to \nparticipate in the jihad and, because the Soviets had already withdrawn, worked for a relief agency there.  \n\nIn 1996, Hanjour returned to the United States to pursue flight training, after being rejected by a Saudi flight school. \nHe checked out flight schools in Florida, California, and Arizona; and he briefly started at a couple of them before \nreturning to Saudi Arabia. In 1997, he returned to Florida and then, along with two friends, went back to Arizona \nand began his flight training there in earnest. After about three months, Hanjour was able to obtain his private\n\n\n\npilot's license. Several more months of training yielded him a commercial pilot certificate, issued by the Federal \nAviation Administration (FAA) in April 1999. He then returned to Saudi Arabia.  \n\nHanjour reportedly applied to the civil aviation school in Jeddah after returning home, but was rejected. He stayed \nhome for a while and then told his family he was going to the United Arab Emirates to work for an airline. Where \nHanjour actually traveled during this time period is unknown. It is possible he went to the training camps in \nAfghanistan.  \n\nThe fact that Hanjour spent so much time in Arizona may be significant. A number of important al Qaeda figures \nattended the University of Arizona in Tucson or lived in Tucson in the 1980s and early 1990s.   Some of Hanjour's \nknown Arizona associates from the time of his flight training in the late 1990s have also raised suspicion.   FBI \ninvestigators have speculated that al Qaeda may have directed other extremist Muslims in the Phoenix area to \nenroll in aviation training. It is clear that when Hanjour lived in Arizona in the 1990s, he associated with several \nindividuals holding extremist beliefs who have been the subject of counterterrorism investigations. Some of them \ntrained with Hanjour to be pilots. Others had apparent connections to al Qaeda, including training in Afghanistan.  \n\nBy the spring of 2000, Hanjour was back in Afghanistan. According to KSM, Hanjour was sent to him in Karachi for \ninclusion in the plot after Hanjour was identified in al Qaeda's al Faruq camp as a trained pilot, on the basis of \nbackground information he had provided. Hanjour had been at a camp in Afghanistan for a few weeks when Bin \nLadin or Atef apparently realized that he was a trained pilot; he was told to report to KSM, who then trained Hanjour \nfor a few days in the use of code words.  \n\nOn June 20, Hanjour returned home to Saudi Arabia. He obtained a U. S. student visa on September 25 and told \nhis family he was returning to his job in the UAE. Hanjour did go to the UAE, but to meet facilitator Ali Abdul Aziz \nAli.  \n\nAli opened a bank account in Dubai for Hanjour and providing the initial funds for his trip. On December 8, Hanjour \ntraveled to San Diego. His supposed destination was an English as a second language program in Oakland, \nCalifornia, which he had scheduled before leaving Saudi Arabia but never attended. Instead, as mentioned earlier, \nhe joined Nawaf al Hazmi in San Diego.  \n\nHazmi and Hanjour left San Diego almost immediately and drove to Arizona. Settling in Mesa, Hanjour began \nrefresher training at his old school, Arizona Aviation. He wanted to train on multi-engine planes, but had difficulties \nbecause his English was not good enough. The instructor advised him to discontinue but Hanjour said he could not \ngo home without completing the training. In early 2001, he started training on a Boeing 737 simulator at Pan Am \nInternational Flight Academy in Mesa. An instructor there found his work well below standard and discouraged him \nfrom continuing. Again, Hanjour per-\n\nsevered; he completed the initial training by the end of March 2001. At that point, Hanjour and Hazmi vacated their \napartment and started driving east, anticipating the arrival of the \"muscle hijackers\" - the operatives who would \nstorm the cockpits and control the passengers. By as early as April 4, Hanjour and Hazmi had arrived in Falls \nChurch, Virginia.  \n\nThe three pilots in Florida continued with their training. Atta and Shehhi finished up at Huffman and earned their \ninstrument certificates from the FAA in November. In mid-December 2000, they passed their commercial pilot tests \nand received their licenses. They then began training to fly large jets on a flight simulator. At about the same time, \nJarrah began simulator training, also in Florida but at a different center. By the end of 2000, less than six months \nafter their arrival, the three pilots on the East Coast were simulating flights on large jets.  \n\nTravels in Early 2001 \n\nJarrah, Atta, and Shehhi, having progressed in their training, all took foreign trips during the holiday period of 2000-\n2001. Jarrah flew through Germany to get home to Beirut. A few weeks later, he returned to Florida via Germany, \nwith Aysel Senguen. She stayed with him in Florida for ten days, even accompanying him to a flight training \nsession. We do not know whether Atta or al Qaeda leaders knew about Jarrah's trips and Senguen's visit. The other \noperatives had broken off regular contact with their families. At the end of January 2001, Jarrah again flew to \n\n\n\nBeirut, to visit his sick father. After staying there for several weeks, Jarrah visited Senguen in Germany for a few \ndays before returning to the United States at the end of February.  \n\nWhile Jarrah took his personal trips, Atta traveled to Germany in early January 2001 for a progress meeting with \nRamzi Binalshibh. Binalshibh says Atta told him to report to the al Qaeda leadership in Afghanistan that the three \nHamburg pilots had completed their flight training and were awaiting orders. Atta also disclosed that a fourth pilot, \nHanjour, had joined Hazmi. Upon returning to Florida, Atta wired Binalshibh travel money. Binalshibh proceeded to \nAfghanistan, made his report, and spent the next several months there and in Pakistan.  \n\nWhen Atta returned to Florida, Shehhi left for Morocco, traveling to Casablanca in mid-January. Shehhi's family, \nconcerned about not having heard from him, reported him missing to the UAE government. The UAE embassy in \nturn contacted the Hamburg police and a UAE representative tried to find him in Germany, visiting mosques and \nShehhi's last address in Hamburg. After learning that his family was looking for him, Shehhi telephoned them on \nJanuary 20 and said he was still living and studying in Hamburg. The UAE government then told the Hamburg \npolice they could call off the search.  \n\nAtta and Shehhi both encountered some difficulty reentering the United States, on January 10 and January 18, \nrespectively. Because neither presented a\n\nSidebar 4: \n\nstudent visa, both of them had to persuade INS inspectors that they should be admitted so that they could continue \ntheir flight training. Neither operative had any problem clearing Customs.  \n\nAfter returning to Florida from their trips, Atta and Shehhi visited Georgia, staying briefly in Norcross and Decatur, \nand renting a single-engine plane to fly with an instructor in Lawrenceville. By February 19, Atta and Shehhi were in \nVirginia. They rented a mailbox in Virginia Beach, cashed a check, and then promptly returned to Georgia, staying \nin Stone Mountain. We have found no explanation for these travels. In mid-March, Jarrah was in Georgia as well, \nstaying in Decatur. There is no evidence that the three pilots met, although Jarrah and Atta apparently spoke on the \nphone. At the end of the month, Jarrah left the United States again and visited Senguen in Germany for two weeks. \nIn early April, Atta and Shehhi returned to Virginia Beach and closed the mailbox they had opened in February.  \n\nBy the time Atta and Shehhi returned to Virginia Beach from their travels in Georgia, Hazmi and Hanjour had also \narrived in Virginia, in Falls Church. They made their way to a large mosque there, the Dar al Hijra mosque, \nsometime in early April.  \n\nAs we mentioned earlier, one of the imams at this mosque was the same Anwar Aulaqi with whom Hazmi had spent \ntime at the Rabat mosque in San Diego. Aulaqi had moved to Virginia in January 2001. He remembers Hazmi\n\nfrom San Diego but has denied having any contact with Hazmi or Hanjour in Virginia.  \n\nAt the Dar al Hijra mosque, Hazmi and Hanjour met a Jordanian named Eyad al Rababah. Rababah says he had \ngone to the mosque to speak to the imam, Aulaqi, about finding work. At the conclusion of services, which normally \nhad 400 to 500 attendees, Rababah says he happened to meet Hazmi and Hanjour. They were looking for an \napartment; Rababah referred them to a friend who had one to rent. Hazmi and Hanjour moved into the apartment, \nwhich was in Alexandria.  \n\nSome FBI investigators doubt Rababah's story. Some agents suspect that Aulaqi may have tasked Rababah to \nhelp Hazmi and Hanjour. We share that suspicion, given the remarkable coincidence of Aulaqi's prior relationship \nwith Hazmi. As noted above, the Commission was unable to locate and interview Aulaqi. Rababah has been \ndeported to Jordan, having been convicted after 9/11 in a fraudulent driver's license scheme.  \n\nRababah, who had lived in Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey, told investigators that he had recommended \nPaterson, New Jersey, as a place with an Arabic-speaking community where Hazmi and Hanjour might want to \nsettle. They asked for his help in getting them an apartment in Paterson. Rababah tried without success. He says \nhe then suggested that Hazmi and Hanjour travel with him to Connecticut where they could look for a place to live.  \n\n\n\nOn May 8, Rababah went to Hazmi and Hanjour's apartment to pick them up for the trip to Connecticut. There he \nsays he found them with new roommates - Ahmed al Ghamdi and Majed Moqed. These two men had been sent to \nAmerica to serve as muscle hijackers and had arrived at Dulles Airport on May 2. Rababah drove Hanjour to \nFairfield, Connecticut, followed by Hazmi, who had Moqed and Ghamdi in his car. After a short stay in Connecticut, \nwhere they apparently called area flight schools and real estate agents, Rababah drove the four to Paterson to \nhave dinner and show them around. He says that they returned with him to Fairfield that night, and that he never \nsaw them again.  \n\nWithin a few weeks, Hanjour, Hazmi, and several other operatives moved to Paterson and rented a one-room \napartment. When their landlord later paid a visit, he found six men living there - Nawaf al Hazmi, now joined by his \nyounger brother Salem, Hanjour, Moqed, probably Ahmed al Ghamdi, and Abdul Aziz al Omari; Hazmi's old friend \nKhalid al Mihdhar would soon join them.  \n\nAtta and Shehhi had already returned to Florida. On April 11, they moved into an apartment in Coral Springs. Atta \nstayed in Florida, awaiting the arrival of the first muscle hijackers.  \n\nShehhi, on the other hand, bought a ticket to Cairo and flew there from Miami on April 18. We do not know much \nmore about Shehhi's reason for traveling to Egypt in April than we know about his January trip to Morocco.\n\nShehhi did meet with Atta's father, who stated in a post-9/11 interview that Shehhi just wanted to pick up Atta's \ninternational driver's license and some money. This story is not credible. Atta already had the license with him and \npresented it during a traffic stop on April 26 while Shehhi was still abroad. Shehhi spent about two weeks in Egypt, \nobviously more time than would have been needed just to meet with Atta's father. Shehhi could have traveled \nelsewhere during this time, but no records indicating additional travel have been discovered.  \n\nShehhi returned to Miami on May 2. That day, Atta and Jarrah were together, about 30 miles to the north, visiting a \nDepartment of Motor Vehicles office in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida, to get Florida driver's licenses. Back in Virginia, \nHazmi and Hanjour were about to leave for Connecticut and New Jersey. As the summer approached, the lead \noperatives were settled in Florida and New Jersey, waiting for the rest of their contingent to join them.  \n\n7. 3 ASSEMBLING THE TEAMS \n\nDuring the summer and early autumn of 2000, Bin Ladin and senior al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan started \nselecting the muscle hijackers - the operatives who would storm the cockpits and control the passengers. Despite \nthe phrase widely used to describe them, the so-called muscle hijackers were not at all physically imposing; most \nwere between 5' 5\" and 5' 7\" in height.  \n\nRecruitment and Selection for 9/11 \n\nTwelve of the 13 muscle hijackers (excluding Nawaf al Hazmi and Mihdhar) came from Saudi Arabia: Satam al \nSuqami, Wail al Shehri, Waleed al Shehri, Abdul Aziz al Omari, Ahmed al Ghamdi, Hamza al Ghamdi, Mohand al \nShehri, Majed Moqed, Salem al Hazmi, Saeed al Ghamdi, Ahmad al Haznawi, and Ahmed al Nami. The remaining \nrecruit, Fayez Banihammad, came from the UAE. He appears to have played a unique role among the muscle \nhijackers because of his work with one of the plot's financial facilitators, Mustafa al Hawsawi.  \n\nSaudi authorities interviewed the relatives of these men and have briefed us on what they found. The muscle \nhijackers came from a variety of educational and societal backgrounds. All were between 20 and 28 years old; most \nwere unemployed with no more than a high school education and were unmarried.  \n\nFour of them - Ahmed al Ghamdi, Saeed al Ghamdi, Hamza al Ghamdi, and Ahmad al Haznawi - came from a \ncluster of three towns in the al Bahah region, an isolated and underdeveloped area of Saudi Arabia, and shared the \nsame tribal affiliation. None had a university degree. Their travel patterns and information from family members \nsuggest that the four may have been in contact with each other as early as the fall of 1999.  \n\nFive more - Wail al Shehri, Waleed al Shehri, Abdul Aziz al Omari, Mohand al Shehri, and Ahmed al Nami - came \nfrom Asir Province, a poor region in southwestern Saudi Arabia that borders Yemen; this weakly policed area is \n\n\n\nsometimes called \"the wild frontier. \"Wail and Waleed al Shehri were brothers. All five in this group had begun \nuniversity studies. Omari had graduated with honors from high school, had attained a degree from the Imam \nMuhammad Ibn Saud Islamic University, was married, and had a daughter.  \n\nThe three remaining muscle hijackers from Saudi Arabia were Satam al Suqami, Majed Moqed, and Salem al \nHazmi. Suqami came from Riyadh. Moqed hailed from a small town called Annakhil, west of Medina. Suqami had \nvery little education, and Moqed had dropped out of university. Neither Suqami nor Moqed appears to have had ties \nto the other, or to any of the other operatives, before getting involved with extremists, probably by 1999.  \n\nSalem al Hazmi, a younger brother of Nawaf, was born in Mecca. Salem's family recalled him as a quarrelsome \nteenager. His brother Nawaf probably recommended him for recruitment into al Qaeda. One al Qaeda member who \nknew them says that Nawaf pleaded with Bin Ladin to allow Salem to participate in the 9/11 operation.  \n\nDetainees have offered varying reasons for the use of so many Saudi operatives. Binalshibh argues that al Qaeda \nwanted to send a message to the government of Saudi Arabia about its relationship with the United States. Several \nother al Qaeda figures, however, have stated that ethnicity generally was not a factor in the selection of operatives \nunless it was important for security or operational reasons.  \n\nKSM, for instance, denies that Saudis were chosen for the 9/11 plot to drive a wedge between the United States \nand Saudi Arabia, and stresses practical reasons for considering ethnic background when selecting operatives. He \nsays that so many were Saudi because Saudis comprised the largest portion of the pool of recruits in the al Qaeda \ntraining camps. KSM estimates that in any given camp, 70 percent of the mujahideen were Saudi, 20 percent were \nYemeni, and 10 percent were from elsewhere. Although Saudi and Yemeni trainees were most often willing to \nvolunteer for suicide operations, prior to 9/11 it was easier for Saudi operatives to get into the United States.  \n\nMost of the Saudi muscle hijackers developed their ties to extremists two or three years before the attacks. Their \nfamilies often did not consider these young men religious zealots. Some were perceived as devout, others as \nlacking in faith. For instance, although Ahmed al Ghamdi, Hamza al Ghamdi, and Saeed al Ghamdi attended prayer \nservices regularly and Omari often served as an imam at his mosque in Saudi Arabia, Suqami and Salem al Hazmi \nappeared unconcerned with religion and, contrary to Islamic law, were known to drink alcohol.  \n\nLike many other al Qaeda operatives, the Saudis who eventually became the muscle hijackers were targeted for \nrecruitment outside Afghanistan - probably in Saudi Arabia itself. Al Qaeda recruiters, certain clerics, and - in a\n\nfew cases - family members probably all played a role in spotting potential candidates. Several of the muscle \nhijackers seem to have been recruited through contacts at local universities and mosques.  \n\nAccording to the head of one of the training camps in Afghanistan, some were chosen by unnamed Saudi sheikhs \nwho had contacts with al Qaeda. Omari, for example, is believed to have been a student of a radical Saudi cleric \nnamed Sulayman al Alwan. His mosque, which is located in al Qassim Province, is known among more moderate \nclerics as a \"terrorist factory. \"The province is at the very heart of the strict Wahhabi movement in Saudi Arabia. \nSaeed al Ghamdi and Mohand al Shehri also spent time in al Qassim, both breaking with their families. According \nto his father, Mohand al Shehri's frequent visits to this area resulted in his failing exams at his university in Riyadh. \nSaeed al Ghamdi transferred to a university in al Qassim, but he soon stopped talking to his family and dropped \nout of school without informing them.  \n\nThe majority of these Saudi recruits began to break with their families in late 1999 and early 2000. According to \nrelatives, some recruits began to make arrangements for extended absences. Others exhibited marked changes in \nbehavior before disappearing. Salem al Hazmi's father recounted that Salem - who had had problems with alcohol \nand petty theft - stopped drinking and started attending mosque regularly three months before he disappeared.  \n\nSeveral family members remembered that their relatives had expressed a desire to participate in jihad, particularly \nin Chechnya. None had mentioned going to Afghanistan. These statements might be true or cover stories. The four \nrecruits from the al Ghamdi tribe, for example, all told their families that they were going to Chechnya. Only two - \nAhmed al Ghamdi and Saeed al Ghamdi - had documentation suggesting travel to a Russian republic.  \n\nSome aspiring Saudi mujahideen, intending to go to Chechnya, encountered difficulties along the way and diverted \nto Afghanistan. In 1999, Ibn al Khattab - the primary commander of Arab nationals in Chechnya - reportedly had \nstarted turning away most foreign mujahideen because of their inexperience and inability to adjust to the local \n\n\n\nconditions. KSM states that several of the 9/11 muscle hijackers faced problems traveling to Chechnya and so went \nto Afghanistan, where they were drawn into al Qaeda.  \n\nKhallad has offered a more detailed story of how such diversions occurred. According to him, a number of Saudi \nmujahideen who tried to go to Chechnya in 1999 to fight the Russians were stopped at the Turkish-Georgian \nborder. Upon arriving in Turkey, they received phone calls at guesthouses in places such as Istanbul and Ankara, \ninforming them that the route to Chechnya via Georgia had been closed. These Saudis then decided to travel to \nAfghanistan, where they could train and wait to make another attempt to enter Chechnya during the summer of \n2000. While training at al Qaeda camps, a dozen of them heard Bin Ladin's speeches, volunteered to become \nsuicide operatives, and eventually were selected as muscle hijackers for the planes operation. Khallad says he met \na number of them at the Kandahar airport, where they were help-\n\ning to provide extra security. He encouraged Bin Ladin to use them. Khallad claims to have been closest with \nSaeed al Ghamdi, whom he convinced to become a martyr and whom he asked to recruit a friend, Ahmed al \nGhamdi, to the same cause. Although Khallad claims not to recall everyone from this group who was later chosen \nfor the 9/11 operation, he says they also included Suqami, Waleed and Wail al Shehri, Omari, Nami, Hamza al \nGhamdi, Salem al Hazmi, and Moqed.  \n\nAccording to KSM, operatives volunteered for suicide operations and, for the most part, were not pressured to \nmartyr themselves. Upon arriving in Afghanistan, a recruit would fill out an application with standard questions, such \nas, What brought you to Afghanistan? How did you travel here? How did you hear about us? What attracted you to \nthe cause? What is your educational background? Where have you worked before? Applications were valuable for \ndetermining the potential of new arrivals, for filtering out potential spies from among them, and for identifying \nrecruits with special skills. For instance, as pointed out earlier, Hani Hanjour noted his pilot training. Prospective \noperatives also were asked whether they were prepared to serve as suicide operatives; those who answered in the \naffirmative were interviewed by senior al Qaeda lieutenant Muhammad Atef.  \n\nKSM claims that the most important quality for any al Qaeda operative was willingness to martyr himself. Khallad \nagrees, and claims that this criterion had preeminence in selecting the planes operation participants. The second \nmost important criterion was demonstrable patience, Khallad says, because the planning for such attacks could \ntake years.  \n\nKhallad claims it did not matter whether the hijackers had fought in jihad previously, since he believes that U. S. \nauthorities were not looking for such operatives before 9/11. But KSM asserts that young mujahideen with clean \nrecords were chosen to avoid raising alerts during travel. The al Qaeda training camp head mentioned above adds \nthat operatives with no prior involvement in activities likely to be known to international security agencies were \npurposefully selected for the 9/11 attacks.  \n\nMost of the muscle hijackers first underwent basic training similar to that given other al Qaeda recruits. This \nincluded training in firearms, heavy weapons, explosives, and topography. Recruits learned discipline and military \nlife. They were subjected to artificial stresses to measure their psychological fitness and commitment to jihad. At \nleast seven of the Saudi muscle hijackers took this basic training regime at the al Faruq camp near Kandahar. This \nparticular camp appears to have been the preferred location for vetting and training the potential muscle hijackers \nbecause of its proximity to Bin Ladin and senior al Qaeda leadership. Two others - Suqami and Moqed - trained at \nKhaldan, another large basic training facility located near Kabul, where Mihdhar had trained in the mid-1990s.  \n\nBy the time operatives for the planes operation were picked in mid-2000, some of them had been training in \nAfghanistan for months, others were just\n\narriving for the first time, and still others may have been returning after prior visits to the camps. According to KSM, \nBin Ladin would travel to the camps to deliver lectures and meet the trainees personally. If Bin Ladin believed a \ntrainee held promise for a special operation, that trainee would be invited to the al Qaeda leader's compound at \nTarnak Farms for further meetings.  \n\nKSM claims that Bin Ladin could assess new trainees very quickly, in about ten minutes, and that many of the 9/11 \nhijackers were selected in this manner. Bin Ladin, assisted by Atef, personally chose all the future muscle hijackers \nfor the planes operation, primarily between the summer of 2000 and April 2001. Upon choosing a trainee, Bin Ladin \nwould ask him to swear loyalty for a suicide operation. After the selection and oath-swearing, the operative would \n\n\n\nbe sent to KSM for training and the filming of a martyrdom video, a function KSM supervised as head of al Qaeda's \nmedia committee.  \n\nKSM sent the muscle hijacker recruits on to Saudi Arabia to obtain U. S. visas. He gave them money (about $2, 000 \neach) and instructed them to return to Afghanistan for more training after obtaining the visas. At this early stage, the \noperatives were not told details about the operation. The majority of the Saudi muscle hijackers obtained U. S. visas \nin Jeddah or Riyadh between September and November of 2000.  \n\nKSM told potential hijackers to acquire new \"clean\" passports in their home countries before applying for a U. S. \nvisa. This was to avoid raising suspicion about previous travel to countries where al Qaeda operated. Fourteen of \nthe 19 hijackers, including nine Saudi muscle hijackers, obtained new passports. Some of these passports were \nthen likely doctored by the al Qaeda passport division in Kandahar, which would add or erase entry and exit stamps \nto create \"false trails\" in the passports.  \n\nIn addition to the operatives who eventually participated in the 9/11 attacks as muscle hijackers, Bin Ladin \napparently selected at least nine other Saudis who, for various reasons, did not end up taking part in the operation: \nMohamed Mani Ahmad al Kahtani, Khalid Saeed Ahmad al Zahrani, Ali Abd al Rahman al Faqasi al Ghamdi, Saeed \nal Baluchi, Qutaybah al Najdi, Zuhair al Thubaiti, Saeed Abdullah Saeed al Ghamdi, Saud al Rashid, and Mushabib \nal Hamlan. A tenth individual, a Tunisian with Canadian citizenship named Abderraouf Jdey, may have been a \ncandidate to participate in 9/11, or he may have been a candidate for a later attack. These candidate hijackers \neither backed out, had trouble obtaining needed travel documents, or were removed from the operation by the al \nQaeda leadership. Khallad believes KSM wanted between four and six operatives per plane. KSM states that al \nQaeda had originally planned to use 25 or 26 hijackers but ended up with only the 19.  \n\nFinal Training and Deployment to the United States \n\nHaving acquired U. S. visas in Saudi Arabia, the muscle hijackers returned to Afghanistan for special training in late \n2000 to early 2001. The training\n\nonly a handful of al Qaeda operatives who, according to KSM, was aware of the full details of the planned planes \noperation. Abu Turab taught the operatives how to conduct hijackings, disarm air marshals, and handle explosives. \nHe also trained them in bodybuilding and provided them with a few basic English words and phrases.  \n\nAccording to KSM, Abu Turab even had the trainees butcher a sheep and a camel with a knife to prepare to use \nknives during the hijackings. The recruits learned to focus on storming the cockpit at the earliest opportunity when \nthe doors first opened, and to worry about seizing control over the rest of the plane later. The operatives were \ntaught about other kinds of attack as well, such as truck bombing, so that they would not be able to disclose the \nexact nature of their operation if they were caught. According to KSM, the muscle did not learn the full details - \nincluding the plan to hijack planes and fly them into buildings - before reaching the United States.  \n\nAfter training in Afghanistan, the operatives went to a safehouse maintained by KSM in Karachi and stayed there \ntemporarily before being deployed to the United States via the UAE. The safehouse was run by al Qaeda operative \nAbd al Rahim Ghulum Rabbani, also known as Abu Rahmah, a close associate of KSM who assisted him for three \nyears by finding apartments and lending logistical support to operatives KSM would send.\n\nAccording to an al Qaeda facilitator, operatives were brought to the safehouse by a trusted Pakistani al Qaeda \ncourier named Abdullah Sindhi, who also worked for KSM. The future hijackers usually arrived in groups of two or \nthree, staying at the safe house for as long as two weeks. The facilitator has identified each operative whom he \nassisted at KSM's direction in the spring of 2001. Before the operatives left Pakistan, each of them received $10, \n000 from KSM for future expenses.  \n\nFrom Pakistan, the operatives transited through the UAE en route to the United States. In the Emirates they were \nassisted primarily by al Qaeda operatives Ali Abdul Aziz Ali and Mustafa al Hawsawi. Ali apparently assisted nine \nfuture hijackers between April and June 2001 as they came through Dubai. He helped them with plane tickets, \ntraveler's checks, and hotel reservations; he also taught them about everyday aspects of life in the West, such as \npurchasing clothes and ordering food. Dubai, a modern city with easy access to a major airport, travel agencies, \nhotels, and Western commercial establishments, was an ideal transit point.  \n\n\n\nAli reportedly assumed the operatives he was helping were involved in a big operation in the United States, he did \nnot know the details.   When he asked KSM to send him an assistant, KSM dispatched Hawsawi, who had worked \non al Qaeda's media committee in Kandahar. Hawsawi helped send the last four operatives (other than Mihdhar) to \nthe United States from the UAE. Hawsawi would consult with Atta about the hijackers' travel schedules to the \nUnited States and later check with Atta to confirm that each had arrived. Hawsawi told\n\nthe muscle hijackers that they would be met by Atta at the airport. Hawsawi also facilitated some of the operation's \nfinancing.  \n\nThe muscle hijackers began arriving in the United States in late April 2001. In most cases, they traveled in pairs on \ntourist visas and entered the United States in Orlando or Miami, Florida;Washington, D. C. ; or New York. Those \narriving in Florida were assisted by Atta and Shehhi, while Hazmi and Hanjour took care of the rest. By the end of \nJune, 14 of the 15 muscle hijackers had crossed the Atlantic.  \n\nThe muscle hijackers supplied an infusion of funds, which they carried as a mixture of cash and traveler's checks \npurchased in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Seven muscle hijackers are known to have purchased a total of nearly \n$50, 000 in traveler's checks that were used in the United States. Moreover, substantial deposits into operatives'U. \nS. bank accounts immediately followed the entry of other muscle hijackers, indicating that those newcomers \nbrought money with them as well. In addition, muscle hijacker Banihammad came to the United States after \nopening bank accounts in the UAE into which were deposited the equivalent of approximately $30, 000 on June 25, \n2001. After his June 27 arrival in the United States, Banihammad made Visa and ATM withdrawals from his UAE \naccounts.  \n\nThe hijackers made extensive use of banks in the United States, choosing both branches of major international \nbanks and smaller regional banks. All of the hijackers opened accounts in their own name, and used passports and \nother identification documents that appeared valid on their face. Contrary to numerous published reports, there is \nno evidence the hijackers ever used false Social Security numbers to open any bank accounts. While the hijackers \nwere not experts on the use of the U. S. financial system, nothing they did would have led the banks to suspect \ncriminal behavior, let alone a terrorist plot to commit mass murder.  \n\nThe last muscle hijacker to arrive was Khalid al Mihdhar. As mentioned earlier, he had abandoned Hazmi in San \nDiego in June 2000 and returned to his family in Yemen. Mihdhar reportedly stayed in Yemen for about a month \nbefore Khallad persuaded him to return to Afghanistan. Mihdhar complained about life in the United States. He met \nwith KSM, who remained annoyed at his decision to go AWOL. But KSM's desire to drop him from the operation \nyielded to Bin Ladin's insistence to keep him.  \n\nBy late 2000, Mihdhar was in Mecca, staying with a cousin until February 2001, when he went home to visit his \nfamily before returning to Afghanistan. In June 2001, Mihdhar returned once more to Mecca to stay with his cousin \nfor another month. Mihdhar said that Bin Ladin was planning five attacks on the United States. Before leaving, \nMihdhar asked his cousin to watch over his home and family because of a job he had to do.  \n\nOn July 4, 2001, Mihdhar left Saudi Arabia to return to the United States, arriving at John F. Kennedy International \nAirport in New York. Mihdhar gave American Airlines Flight 11 \n\n  \u2022 \n\n United Airlines Flight 175 \n\n  \u2022 \n\n American Airlines Flight 77 \n\n  \u2022 \n\n United Airlines Flight 93 \n\n  \u2022 \n\nhis intended address as the Marriott Hotel, New York City, but instead spent one night at another New York hotel. \nHe then joined the group of hijackers in Paterson, reuniting with Nawaf al Hazmi after more than a year. With two \n\n\n\nmonths remaining, all 19 hijackers were in the United States and ready to take the final steps toward carrying out \nthe attacks.  \n\nAssistance from Hezbollah and Iran to al Qaeda \n\nAs we mentioned in chapter 2, while in Sudan, senior managers in al Qaeda maintained contacts with Iran and the \nIranian-supported worldwide terrorist organization Hezbollah, which is based mainly in southern Lebanon and \nBeirut. Al Qaeda members received advice and training from Hezbollah.\n\nIntelligence indicates the persistence of contacts between Iranian security officials and senior al Qaeda figures after \nBin Ladin's return to Afghanistan. Khallad has said that Iran made a concerted effort to strengthen relations with al \nQaeda after the October 2000 attack on the USS Cole , but was rebuffed because Bin Ladin did not want to \nalienate his supporters in Saudi Arabia. Khallad and other detainees have described the willingness of Iranian \nofficials to facilitate the travel of al Qaeda members through Iran, on their way to and from Afghanistan. For \nexample, Iranian border inspectors would be told not to place telltale stamps in the passports of these travelers. \nSuch arrangements were particularly beneficial to Saudi members of al Qaeda.  \n\nOur knowledge of the international travels of the al Qaeda operatives selected for the 9/11 operation remains \nfragmentary. But we now have evidence suggesting that 8 to 10 of the 14 Saudi \"muscle\" operatives traveled into or \nout of Iran between October 2000 and February 2001.  \n\nIn October 2000, a senior operative of Hezbollah visited Saudi Arabia to coordinate activities there. He also planned \nto assist individuals in Saudi Arabia in traveling to Iran during November. A top Hezbollah commander and Saudi \nHezbollah contacts were involved.  \n\nAlso in October 2000, two future muscle hijackers, Mohand al Shehri and Hamza al Ghamdi, flew from Iran to \nKuwait. In November, Ahmed al Ghamdi apparently flew to Beirut, traveling - perhaps by coincidence - on the same \nflight as a senior Hezbollah operative. Also in November, Salem al Hazmi apparently flew from Saudi Arabia to \nBeirut.  \n\nIn mid-November, we believe, three of the future muscle hijackers, Wail al Shehri, Waleed al Shehri, and Ahmed al \nNami, all of whom had obtained their U. S. visas in late October, traveled in a group from Saudi Arabia to Beirut and \nthen onward to Iran. An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative was on the same flight that took the future \nhijackers to Iran. Hezbollah officials in Beirut and Iran were expecting the arrival of a group during the same time \nperiod. The travel of this group was important enough to merit the attention of senior figures in Hezbollah.  \n\nLater in November, two future muscle hijackers, Satam al Suqami and Majed\n\nMoqed, flew into Iran from Bahrain. In February 2001, Khalid al Mihdhar may have taken a flight from Syria to Iran, \nand then traveled further within Iran to a point near the Afghan border.  \n\nKSM and Binalshibh have confirmed that several of the 9/11 hijackers (at least eight, according to Binalshibh) \ntransited Iran on their way to or from Afghanistan, taking advantage of the Iranian practice of not stamping Saudi \npassports. They deny any other reason for the hijackers' travel to Iran. They also deny any relationship between the \nhijackers and Hezbollah.  \n\nIn sum, there is strong evidence that Iran facilitated the transit of al Qaeda members into and out of Afghanistan \nbefore 9/11, and that some of these were future 9/11 hijackers. There also is circumstantial evidence that senior \nHezbollah operatives were closely tracking the travel of some of these future muscle hijackers into Iran in \nNovember 2000. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of a remarkable coincidence - that is, that Hezbollah \nwas actually focusing on some other group of individuals traveling from Saudi Arabia during this same time frame, \nrather than the future hijackers.  \n\nWe have found no evidence that Iran or Hezbollah was aware of the planning for what later became the 9/11 attack. \nAt the time of their travel through Iran, the al Qaeda operatives themselves were probably not aware of the specific \ndetails of their future operation.\n\n\n\nAfter 9/11, Iran and Hezbollah wished to conceal any past evidence of cooperation with Sunni terrorists associated \nwith al Qaeda. A senior Hezbollah official disclaimed any Hezbollah involvement in 9/11.  \n\nWe believe this topic requires further investigation by the U. S. government.\n\n7. 4 FINAL STRATEGIES AND TACTICS \n\nFinal Preparations in the United States \n\nDuring the early summer of 2001, Atta, assisted by Shehhi, was busy coordinating the arrival of most of the muscle \nhijackers in southern Florida - picking them up at the airport, finding them places to stay, and helping them settle in \nthe United States.  \n\nThe majority settled in Florida. Some opened bank accounts, acquired mailboxes, and rented cars. Several also \njoined local gyms, presumably to stay fit for the operation. Upon first arriving, most stayed in hotels and motels;but \nby mid- June, they settled in shared apartments relatively close to one another and Atta.   Though these muscle \nhijackers did not travel much after arriving in the United States, two of them, Waleed al Shehri and Satam al \nSuqami, took unusual trips.\n\nOn May 19, Shehri and Suqami flew from Fort Lauderdale to Freeport, the Bahamas, where they had reservations \nat the Bahamas Princess Resort. The two were turned away by Bahamian officials on arrival, however, because \nthey\n\nlacked visas; they returned to Florida that same day. They likely took this trip to renew Suqami's immigration status, \nas Suqami's legal stay in the United States ended May 21.  \n\nOn July 30, Shehri traveled alone from Fort Lauderdale to Boston. He flew to San Francisco the next day, where he \nstayed one night before returning via Las Vegas. While this travel may have been a casing flight - Shehri traveled in \nfirst class on the same type of aircraft he would help hijack on September 11 (a Boeing 767) and the trip included a \nlayover in Las Vegas - Shehri was neither a pilot nor a plot leader, as were the other hijackers who took \nsurveillance flights.  \n\nThe three Hamburg pilots - Atta, Shehhi, and Jarrah - took the first of their cross-country surveillance flights early in \nthe summer. Shehhi flew from New York to Las Vegas via San Francisco in late May. Jarrah flew from Baltimore to \nLas Vegas via Los Angeles in early June. Atta flew from Boston to Las Vegas via San Francisco at the end of June. \nEach traveled in first class, on United Airlines. For the east-west transcontinental leg, each operative flew on the \nsame type of aircraft he would pilot on September 11 (Atta and Shehhi, a Boeing 767; Jarrah, a Boeing 757).   \nHanjour and Hazmi, as noted below, took similar crosscountry surveillance flights in August.\n\nJarrah and Hanjour also received additional training and practice flights in the early summer. A few days before \ndeparting on his cross-country test flight, Jarrah flew from Fort Lauderdale to Philadelphia, where he trained at \nHortman Aviation and asked to fly the Hudson Corridor, a low-altitude \"hallway\" along the Hudson River that passes \nNew York landmarks like the World Trade Center. Heavy traffic in the area can make the corridor a dangerous \nroute for an inexperienced pilot. Because Hortman deemed Jarrah unfit to fly solo, he could fly this route only with \nan instructor.  \n\nHanjour, too, requested to fly the Hudson Corridor about this same time, at Air Fleet Training Systems in Teterboro, \nNew Jersey, where he started receiving ground instruction soon after settling in the area with Hazmi. Hanjour flew \nthe Hudson Corridor, but his instructor declined a second request because of what he considered Hanjour's poor \npiloting skills. Shortly thereafter, Hanjour switched to Caldwell Flight Academy in Fairfield, New Jersey, where he \nrented small aircraft on several occasions during June and July. In one such instance on July 20, Hanjour - likely \naccompanied by Hazmi - rented a plane from Caldwell and took a practice flight from Fairfield to Gaithersburg, \nMaryland, a route that would have allowed them to fly near Washington, D. C. Other evidence suggests that \nHanjour may even have returned to Arizona for flight simulator training earlier in June.  \n\n\n\nThere is no indication that Atta or Shehhi received any additional flight training in June. Both were likely too busy \norganizing the newly arrived muscle hijackers and taking their cross-country surveillance flights. Atta, moreover, \nneeded to coordinate with his second-in-command, Nawaf al Hazmi.  \n\nAlthough Atta and Hazmi appear to have been in Virginia at about the same time in early April, they probably did \nnot meet then. Analysis of late April communications associated with KSM indicates that they had wanted to get \ntogether in April but could not coordinate the meeting.   Atta and Hazmi probably first met in the United States only \nwhen Hazmi traveled round-trip from Newark to Miami between June 19 and June 25.\n\nAfter he returned to New Jersey, Hazmi's behavior began to closely parallel that of the other hijackers. He and \nHanjour, for instance, soon established new bank accounts, acquired a mailbox, rented cars, and started visiting a \ngym. So did the four other hijackers who evidently were staying with them in New Jersey. Several also obtained \nnew photo identification, first in New Jersey and then at the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, where Hazmi \nand Hanjour had obtained such documents months earlier, likely with help from their Jordanian friend, Rababah.  \n\nAtta probably met again with Hazmi in early July. Returning from his initial cross-country surveillance flight, Atta flew \ninto New York. Rather than return immediately to Florida, he checked into a New Jersey hotel. He picked up tickets \nto travel to Spain at a travel agency in Paterson on July 4 before departing for Fort Lauderdale. Now that the \nmuscle hijackers had arrived, he was ready to meet with Ramzi Binalshibh for the last time.  \n\nThe Meeting in Spain \n\nAfter meeting with Atta in Berlin in January 2001, Binalshibh had spent much of the spring of 2001 in Afghanistan \nand Pakistan, helping move the muscle hijackers as they passed through Karachi. During the Berlin meeting, the \ntwo had agreed to meet later in the year in Kuala Lumpur to discuss the operation in person again. In late May, \nBinalshibh reported directly to Bin Ladin at an al Qaeda facility known as \"Compound Six\" near Kandahar.  \n\nBin Ladin told Binalshibh to instruct Atta and the others to focus on their security and that of the operation, and to \nadvise Atta to proceed as planned with the targets discussed before Atta left Afghanistan in early 2000 - the World \nTrade Center, the Pentagon, the White House, and the Capitol. According to Binalshibh, Bin Ladin said he preferred \nthe White House over the Capitol, asking Binalshibh to confirm that Atta understood this preference. Binalshibh \nsays Bin Ladin had given the same message to Waleed al Shehri for conveyance to Atta earlier that spring. \nBinalshibh also received permission to meet Atta in Malaysia. Atef provided money for the trip, which KSM would \nhelp Binalshibh arrange in Karachi.  \n\nIn early June, Binalshibh traveled by taxi from Kandahar to Quetta, Pakistan, where al Qaeda courier Abu Rahmah \ntook him to KSM. According to Binalshibh, KSM provided a plane ticket to Malaysia and a fraudulent Saudi passport \nto use for the trip. KSM told him to ask Atta to select a date for the attacks. Binalshibh was to return to Germany \nand then inform KSM of the date. KSM\n\nalso gave Binalshibh the email address of Zacarias Moussaoui for future contact. Binalshibh then left for Kuala \nLumpur.  \n\nBinalshibh contacted Atta upon arriving in Malaysia and found a change in plan. Atta could not travel because he \nwas too busy helping the new arrivals settle in the United States. After remaining in Malaysia for approximately \nthree weeks, Binalshibh went to Bangkok for a few days before returning to Germany. He and Atta agreed to meet \nlater at a location to be determined.  \n\nIn early July, Atta called Binalshibh to suggest meeting in Madrid, for reasons Binalshibh claims not to know. He \nsays he preferred Berlin, but that he and Atta knew too many people in Germany and feared being spotted together. \nUnable to buy a ticket to Madrid at the height of the tourist season, Binalshibh booked a seat on a flight to Reus, \nnear Barcelona, the next day. Atta was already en route to Madrid, so Binalshibh phoned Shehhi in the United \nStates to inform him of the change in itinerary.  \n\nAtta arrived in Madrid on July 8. He spent the night in a hotel and made three calls from his room, most likely to \ncoordinate with Binalshibh. The next day, Atta rented a car and drove to Reus to pick up Binalshibh; the two then \ndrove to the nearby town of Cambrils. Hotel records show Atta renting rooms in the same area until July 19, when \n\n\n\nhe returned his rental car in Madrid and flew back to Fort Lauderdale. On July 16, Binalshibh returned to Hamburg, \nusing a ticket Atta had purchased for him earlier that day. According to Binalshibh, they did not meet with anyone \nelse while in Spain.  \n\nBinalshibh says he told Atta that Bin Ladin wanted the attacks carried out as soon as possible. Bin Ladin, \nBinalshibh conveyed, was worried about having so many operatives in the United States. Atta replied that he could \nnot yet provide a date because he was too busy organizing the arriving hijackers and still needed to coordinate the \ntiming of the flights so that the crashes would occur simultaneously. Atta said he required about five to six weeks \nbefore he could provide an attack date. Binalshibh advised Atta that Bin Ladin had directed that the other \noperatives not be informed of the date until the last minute. Atta was to provide Binalshibh with advance notice of at \nleast a week or two so that Binalshibh could travel to Afghanistan and report the date personally to Bin Ladin.  \n\nAs to targets, Atta understood Bin Ladin's interest in striking the White House. Atta said he thought this target too \ndifficult, but had tasked Hazmi and Hanjour to evaluate its feasibility and was awaiting their answer. Atta said that \nthose two operatives had rented small aircraft and flown reconnaissance flights near the Pentagon. Atta explained \nthat Hanjour was assigned to attack the Pentagon, Jarrah the Capitol, and that both Atta and Shehhi would hit the \nWorld Trade Center. If any pilot could not reach his intended target, he was to crash the plane. If Atta could not \nstrike the World Trade Center, he planned to crash his aircraft directly into the streets of New York. Atta told \nBinalshibh that each pilot had volunteered for his assigned target, and that the assignments were subject to \nchange.  \n\nDuring the Spain meeting, Atta also mentioned that he had considered targeting a nuclear facility he had seen \nduring familiarization flights near New York - a target they referred to as \"electrical engineering. \"According to \nBinalshibh, the other pilots did not like the idea. They thought a nuclear target would be difficult because the \nairspace around it was restricted, making reconnaissance flights impossible and increasing the likelihood that any \nplane would be shot down before impact. Moreover, unlike the approved targets, this alternative had not been \ndiscussed with senior al Qaeda leaders and therefore did not have the requisite blessing. Nor would a nuclear \nfacility have particular symbolic value. Atta did not ask Binalshibh to pass this idea on to Bin Ladin, Atef, or KSM, \nand Binalshibh says he did not mention it to them until after September 11.  \n\nBinalshibh claims that during their time in Spain, he and Atta also discussed how the hijackings would be executed. \nAtta said he, Shehhi, and Jarrah had encountered no problems carrying box cutters on cross-country surveillance \nflights. The best time to storm the cockpit would be about 10-15 minutes after takeoff, when the cockpit doors \ntypically were opened for the first time. Atta did not believe they would need any other weapons. He had no firm \ncontingency plan in case the cockpit door was locked. While he mentioned general ideas such as using a hostage \nor claiming to have a bomb, he was confident the cockpit doors would be opened and did not consider breaking \nthem down a viable idea. Atta told Binalshibh he wanted to select planes departing on long flights because they \nwould be full of fuel, and that he wanted to hijack Boeing aircraft because he believed them easier to fly than Airbus \naircraft, which he understood had an autopilot feature that did not allow them to be crashed into the ground.  \n\nFinally, Atta confirmed that the muscle hijackers had arrived in the United States without incident. They would be \ndivided into teams according to their English-speaking ability. That way they could assist each other before the \noperation and each team would be able to command the passengers in English. According to Binalshibh, Atta \ncomplained that some of the hijackers wanted to contact their families to say goodbye, something he had \nforbidden. Atta, moreover, was nervous about his future communications with Binalshibh, whom he instructed to \nobtain new telephones upon returning to Germany. Before Binalshibh left Spain, he gave Atta eight necklaces and \neight bracelets that Atta had asked him to buy when he was recently in Bangkok, believing that if the hijackers were \nclean shaven and well dressed, others would think them wealthy Saudis and give them less notice.  \n\nAs directed, upon returning from Spain, Binalshibh obtained two new phones, one to communicate with Atta and \nanother to communicate with KSM and others, such as Zacarias Moussaoui. Binalshibh soon contacted KSM and, \nusing code words, reported the results of his meeting with Atta. This important exchange occurred in mid-July.  \n\nThe conversation covered various topics. For example, Jarrah was to send Binalshibh certain personal materials \nfrom the hijackers, including copies of their\n\n\n\npassports, which Binalshibh in turn would pass along to KSM, probably for subsequent use in al Qaeda \npropaganda.  \n\nThe most significant part of the mid-July conversation concerned Jarrah's troubled relationship with Atta. KSM and \nBinalshibh both acknowledge that Jarrah chafed under Atta's authority over him. Binalshibh believes the \ndisagreement arose in part from Jarrah's family visits. Moreover, Jarrah had been on his own for most of his time in \nthe United States because Binalshibh's visa difficulty had prevented the two of them from training together. Jarrah \nthus felt excluded from the decisionmaking. Binalshibh had to act as a broker between Jarrah and Atta.  \n\nConcerned that Jarrah might withdraw from the operation at this late stage, KSM emphasized the importance of \nAtta and Jarrah's resolving their differences. Binalshibh claims that such concern was unwarranted, and in their \nmid- July discussion reassured KSM that Atta and Jarrah would reconcile and be ready to move forward in about a \nmonth, after Jarrah visited his family. Noting his concern and the potential for delay, KSM at one point instructed \nBinalshibh to send \"the skirts\" to \"Sally\" - a coded instruction to Binalshibh to send funds to Zacarias Moussaoui. \nWhile Binalshibh admits KSM did direct him to send Moussaoui money during the mid-July conversation, he denies \nknowing exactly why he received this instruction - though he thought the money was being provided \"within the \nframework\" of the 9/11 operation.  \n\nKSM may have instructed Binalshibh to send money to Moussaoui in order to help prepare Moussaoui as a \npotential substitute pilot for Jarrah. On July 20, 2001, Aysel Senguen, Jarrah's girlfriend, purchased a one-way \nticket for Jarrah from Miami to Dusseldorf. On Jarrah's previous four trips from the United States to see Senguen \nand his family in Lebanon, he had always traveled with a round-trip ticket. When Jarrah departed Miami on July 25, \nAtta appears to have driven him to the airport, another unique circumstance.  \n\nBinalshibh picked up Jarrah at the airport in Dusseldorf on July 25. Jarrah wanted to see Senguen as soon as \npossible, so he and Binalshibh arranged to meet a few days later. When they did, they had an emotional \nconversation during which Binalshibh encouraged Jarrah to see the plan through.  \n\nWhile Jarrah was in Germany, Binalshibh and Moussaoui were in contact to arrange for the transfer of funds. \nBinalshibh received two wire transfers from Hawsawi in the UAE totaling $15, 000 and, within days, relayed almost \nall of this money to Moussaoui in two installments.  \n\nMoussaoui had been taking flight lessons at the Airman Flight School in Norman, Oklahoma, since February but \nstopped in late May. Although at that point he had only about 50 hours of flight time and no solo flights to his credit, \nMoussaoui began making inquiries about flight materials and simulator training for Boeing 747s. On July 10, he put \ndown a $1, 500 deposit for flight simulator training at Pan Am International Flight Academy in Eagan, Minnesota, \nand by the end of the month, he had received a simulator schedule to train from\n\nAugust 13 through August 20. Moussaoui also purchased two knives and inquired of two manufacturers of GPS \nequipment whether their products could be converted for aeronautical use - activities that closely resembled those \nof the 9/11 hijackers during their final preparations for the attacks.  \n\nOn August 10, shortly after getting the money from Binalshibh, Moussaoui left Oklahoma with a friend and drove to \nMinnesota. Three days later, Moussaoui paid the $6, 800 balance owed for his flight simulator training at Pan Am in \ncash and began his training. His conduct, however, raised the suspicions of his flight instructor. It was unusual for a \nstudent with so little training to be learning to fly large jets without any intention of obtaining a pilot's license or other \ngoal. On August 16, once the instructor reported his suspicion to the authorities, Moussaoui was arrested by the \nINS on immigration charges.  \n\nKSM denies ever considering Moussaoui for the planes operation. Instead he claims that Moussaoui was slated to \nparticipate in a \"second wave\" of attacks. KSM also states that Moussaoui had no contact with Atta, and we are \nunaware of evidence contradicting this assertion.  \n\nYet KSM has also stated that by the summer of 2001, he was too busy with the planes operation to continue \nplanning for any second-wave attacks. Moreover, he admits that only three potential pilots were ever recruited for \nthe alleged second wave, Moussaoui plus two others who, by midsummer of 2001, had backed out of the plot.   We \ntherefore believe that the effort to push Moussaoui forward in August 2001 lends credence to the suspicion that he \nwas being primed as a possible pilot in the immediate planes operation.\n\n\n\nBinalshibh says he assumed Moussaoui was to take his place as another pilot in the 9/11 operation. Recounting a \npost-9/11 discussion with KSM in Kandahar, Binalshibh claims KSM mentioned Moussaoui as being part of the 9/11 \noperation. Although KSM never referred to Moussaoui by name, Binalshibh understood he was speaking of the \noperative to whom Binalshibh had wired money. Binalshibh says KSM did not approve of Moussaoui but believes \nKSM did not remove him from the operation only because Moussaoui had been selected and assigned by Bin Ladin \nhimself.  \n\nKSM did not hear about Moussaoui's arrest until after September 11. According to Binalshibh, had Bin Ladin and \nKSM learned prior to 9/11 that Moussaoui had been detained, they might have canceled the operation. When \nBinalshibh discussed Moussaoui's arrest with KSM after September 11, KSM congratulated himself on not having \nMoussaoui contact the other operatives, which would have compromised the operation. Moussaoui had been in \ncontact with Binalshibh, of course, but this was not discovered until after 9/11.  \n\nAs it turned out, Moussaoui was not needed to replace Jarrah. By the time Moussaoui was arrested in mid-August, \nJarrah had returned to the United States from his final trip to Germany, his disagreement with Atta apparently \nresolved. The operatives began their final preparations for the attacks.  \n\nReadying the Attacks \n\nA week after he returned from meeting Binalshibh in Spain, Atta traveled to Newark, probably to coordinate with \nHazmi and give him additional funds. Atta spent a few days in the area before returning to Florida on July 30. The \nmonth of August was busy, as revealed by a set of contemporaneous Atta- Binalshibh communications that were \nrecovered after September 11.  \n\nOn August 3, for example, Atta and Binalshibh discussed several matters, such as the best way for the operatives \nto purchase plane tickets and the assignment of muscle hijackers to individual teams. Atta and Binalshibh also \nrevisited the question of whether to target the White House. They discussed targets in coded language, pretending \nto be students discussing various fields of study: \"architecture\" referred to the World Trade Center, \"arts\" the \nPentagon, \"law\" the Capitol, and \"politics\" the White House.  \n\nBinalshibh reminded Atta that Bin Ladin wanted to target the White House. Atta again cautioned that this would be \ndifficult. When Binalshibh persisted, Atta agreed to include the White House but suggested they keep the Capitol as \nan alternate target in case the White House proved too difficult. Atta also suggested that the attacks would not \nhappen until after the first week in September, when Congress reconvened.  \n\nAtta and Binalshibh also discussed \"the friend who is coming as a tourist\" - a cryptic reference to candidate \nhijacker Mohamed al Kahtani (mentioned above), whom Hawsawi was sending the next day as \"the last one\" to \n\"complete the group. \"On August 4, Atta drove to the Orlando airport to meet Kahtani. Upon arrival, however, \nKahtani was denied entry by immigration officials because he had a one-way ticket and little money, could not \nspeak English, and could not adequately explain what he intended to do in the United States. He was sent back to \nDubai. Hawsawi contacted KSM, who told him to help Kahtani return to Pakistan.  \n\nOn August 7, Atta flew from Fort Lauderdale to Newark, probably to coordinate with Hazmi. Two days later, Ahmed \nal Ghamdi and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who had been living in New Jersey with Hazmi and Hanjour, flew to Miami - \nprobably signifying that the four hijacking teams had finally been assigned. While Atta was in New Jersey, he, \nHazmi, and Hanjour all purchased tickets for another set of surveillance flights. Like Shehhi, Jarrah, Atta, and \nWaleed al Shehri before them, Hazmi and Hanjour each flew in first class on the same type of aircraft they would \nhijack on 9/11 (a Boeing 757), and on transcontinental flights that connected to Las Vegas. This time, however, Atta \nhimself also flew directly to Las Vegas, where all three stayed on August 13-14. Beyond Las Vegas's reputation for \nwelcoming tourists, we have seen no credible evidence explaining why, on this occasion and others, the operatives \nflew to or met in Las Vegas.  \n\nThrough August, the hijackers kept busy with their gym training and the pilots took frequent practice flights on small \nrented aircraft. The operatives also\n\nbegan to make purchases suggesting that the planning was coming to an end. In mid-August, for example, they \nbought small knives that may actually have been used in the attacks. On August 22, moreover, Jarrah attempted to \n\n\n\npurchase four GPS units from a pilot shop in Miami. He was able to buy only one unit, which he picked up a few \ndays later when he also purchased three aeronautical charts.  \n\nPerhaps most significant, however, was the purchase of plane tickets for September 11. On August 23, Atta again \nflew to Newark, probably to meet with Hazmi and select flights. All 19 tickets were booked and purchased between \nAugust 25 and September 5.  \n\nIt therefore appears that the attack date was selected by the third week of August. This timing is confirmed by \nBinalshibh, who claims Atta called him with the date in mid-August. According to Binalshibh, Atta used a riddle to \nconvey the date in code - a message of two branches, a slash, and a lollipop (to non-Americans, 11/9 would be \ninterpreted as September 11). Binalshibh says he called Atta back to confirm the date before passing it to KSM.  \n\nKSM apparently received the date from Binalshibh in a message sent through Binalshibh's old Hamburg associate, \nZakariya Essabar. Both Binalshibh and KSM claim that Essabar was not privy to the meaning of the message and \nhad no foreknowledge of the attacks. According to Binalshibh, shortly after the date was chosen, he advised \nEssabar and another Hamburg associate, Said Bahaji, that if they wanted to go to Afghanistan, now was the time \nbecause it would soon become more difficult. Essabar made reservations on August 22 and departed Hamburg for \nKarachi on August 30; Bahaji purchased his tickets on August 20 and departed Hamburg for Karachi on September \n3.  \n\nBinalshibh also made arrangements to leave for Pakistan during early September, before the attacks, as did Ali and \nHawsawi, the plot facilitators in the UAE. During these final days, Binalshibh and Atta kept in contact by phone, \nemail, and instant messaging. Although Atta had forbidden the hijackers to contact their families, he apparently \nplaced one last call to his own father on September 9. Atta also asked Binalshibh to contact the family of one \nhijacker, pass along goodbyes from others, and give regards to KSM. Jarrah alone appears to have left a written \nfarewell - a sentimental letter to Aysel Senguen.  \n\nHazmi, however, may not have been so discreet. He may have telephoned his former San Diego companion, \nMohdar Abdullah, in late August. Several bits of evidence indicate that others in Abdullah's circle may have \nreceived word that something big would soon happen. As noted earlier, Abdullah's behavior reportedly changed \nnoticeably. Prior to September 11, both he and Yazeed al Salmi suddenly became intent on proceeding with their \nplanned marriages. One witness quotes Salmi as commenting after the 9/11 attacks, \"I knew they were going to do \nsomething, that is why I got married. \"Moreover, as of August 2001, Iyad Kreiwesh and other employees at the \nTexaco station where Hazmi had worked suddenly were anticipating attention from law enforcement\n\nauthorities in the near future. Finally, according to an uncorroborated witness account, early on the morning of \nSeptember 10, Abdullah, Osama Awadallah, Omar Bakarbashat, and others behaved suspiciously at the gas \nstation. According to the witness, after the group met, Awadallah said \"it is finally going to happen\" as the others \ncelebrated by giving each other high fives.  \n\nDissent within the al Qaeda Leadership \n\nWhile tactical preparations for the attack were nearing completion, the entire operation was being questioned at the \ntop, as al Qaeda and the Taliban argued over strategy for 2001. Our focus has naturally been on the specifics of the \nplanes operation. But from the perspective of Bin Ladin and Atef, this operation was only one, admittedly key, \nelement of their unfolding plans for the year. Living in Afghanistan, interacting constantly with the Taliban, the al \nQaeda leaders would never lose sight of the situation in that country.\n\nBin Ladin's consistent priority was to launch a major attack directly against the United States. He wanted the planes \noperation to proceed as soon as possible. Mihdhar reportedly told his cousin during the summer of 2001 that Bin \nLadin was reputed to have remarked, \"I will make it happen even if I do it by myself. \"  \n\nAccording to KSM, Bin Ladin had been urging him to advance the date of the attacks. In 2000, for instance, KSM \nremembers Bin Ladin pushing him to launch the attacks amid the controversy after then-Israeli opposition party \nleader Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. KSM claims Bin Ladin told him it would be enough for \nthe hijackers simply to down planes rather than crash them into specific targets. KSM says he resisted the \npressure.  \n\n\n\nKSM claims to have faced similar pressure twice more in 2001. According to him, Bin Ladin wanted the operation \ncarried out on May 12, 2001, seven months to the day after the Cole bombing. KSM adds that the 9/11 attacks had \noriginally been envisioned for May 2001. The second time he was urged to launch the attacks early was in June or \nJuly 2001, supposedly after Bin Ladin learned from the media that Sharon would be visiting the White House. On \nboth occasions KSM resisted, asserting that the hijacking teams were not ready. Bin Ladin pressed particularly \nstrongly for the latter date in two letters stressing the need to attack early. The second letter reportedly was \ndelivered by Bin Ladin's son-in-law, Aws al Madani.  \n\nOther evidence corroborates KSM's account. For instance, Mihdhar told his cousin that the attacks were to happen \nin May, but were postponed twice, first to July, then to September. Moreover, one candidate hijacker remembers a \ngeneral warning being issued in the al Qaeda camps in July or early August, just like the warnings issued two \nweeks before the Cole bombing and ten days before the eventual 9/11 attacks. During the midsummer alert, al \nQaeda members dispersed with their families, security was increased, and Bin Ladin disappeared for about 30 \ndays, until the alert was canceled.  \n\nWhile the details of the operation were strictly compartmented, by the time\n\nof the alert, word had begun to spread that an attack against the United States was coming. KSM notes that it was \ngenerally well known by the summer of 2001 that he was planning some kind of operation against the United \nStates. Many were even aware that he had been preparing operatives to go to the United States, leading some to \nconclude that al Qaeda was planning a nearterm attack on U. S. soil. Moreover, Bin Ladin had made several \nremarks that summer hinting at an upcoming attack and generating rumors throughout the worldwide jihadist \ncommunity. Bin Ladin routinely told important visitors to expect significant attacks against U. S. interests soon and, \nduring a speech at the al Faruq camp, exhorted trainees to pray for the success of an attack involving 20 martyrs. \nOthers have confirmed hearing indications of an impending attack and have verified that such news, albeit without \nspecific details, had spread across al Qaeda.  \n\nAlthough Bin Ladin's top priority apparently was to attack the United States, others had a different view. The Taliban \nleaders put their main emphasis on the year's military offensive against the Northern Alliance, an offensive that \nordinarily would begin in the late spring or summer. They certainly hoped that this year's offensive would finally \nfinish off their old enemies, driving them from Afghanistan. From the Taliban's perspective, an attack against the \nUnited States might be counterproductive. It might draw the Americans into the war against them, just when final \nvictory seemed within their grasp.  \n\nThere is evidence that Mullah Omar initially opposed a major al Qaeda operation directly against the United States \nin 2001. Furthermore, by July, with word spreading of a coming attack, a schism emerged among the senior \nleadership of al Qaeda. Several senior members reportedly agreed with Mullah Omar. Those who reportedly sided \nwith Bin Ladin included Atef, Sulayman Abu Ghayth, and KSM. But those said to have opposed him were weighty \nfigures in the organization - including Abu Hafs the Mauritanian, Sheikh Saeed al Masri, and Sayf al Adl. One senior \nal Qaeda operative claims to recall Bin Ladin arguing that attacks against the United States needed to be carried \nout immediately to support insurgency in the Israeli-occupied territories and protest the presence of U. S. forces in \nSaudi Arabia. Beyond these rhetorical appeals, Bin Ladin also reportedly thought an attack against the United \nStates would benefit al Qaeda by attracting more suicide operatives, eliciting greater donations, and increasing the \nnumber of sympathizers willing to provide logistical assistance.  \n\nMullah Omar is reported to have opposed this course of action for ideological reasons rather than out of fear of U. \nS. retaliation. He is said to have preferred for al Qaeda to attack Jews, not necessarily the United States. KSM \ncontends that Omar faced pressure from the Pakistani government to keep al Qaeda from engaging in operations \noutside Afghanistan. Al Qaeda's chief financial manager, Sheikh Saeed, argued that al Qaeda should defer to the \nTaliban's wishes. Another source says that Sheikh Saeed opposed the operation, both out of deference to Omar \nand because he feared the U. S. response to an\n\nattack. Abu Hafs the Mauritanian reportedly even wrote Bin Ladin a message basing opposition to the attacks on \nthe Qur'an.  \n\nAccording to KSM, in late August, when the operation was fully planned, Bin Ladin formally notified the al Qaeda \nShura Council that a major attack against the United States would take place in the coming weeks. When some \n\n\n\ncouncil members objected, Bin Ladin countered that Mullah Omar lacked authority to prevent al Qaeda from \nconducting jihad outside Afghanistan. Though most of the Shura Council reportedly disagreed, Bin Ladin persisted. \nThe attacks went forward.  \n\nThe story of dissension within al Qaeda regarding the 9/11 attacks is probably incomplete. The information on \nwhich the account is based comes from sources who were not privy to the full scope of al Qaeda and Taliban \nplanning. Bin Ladin and Atef, however, probably would have known, at least, that\n\n     *  The general Taliban offensive against the Northern Alliance would\n\n        rely on al Qaeda military support.\n\n     *  Another significant al Qaeda operation was making progress during\n\n        the summer - a plot to assassinate the Northern Alliance leader,\n\n        Ahmed Shah Massoud. The operatives, disguised as journalists, were\n\n        in Massoud's camp and prepared to kill him sometime in August.\n\n        Their appointment to see him was delayed.\n\nBut on September 9, the Massoud assassination took place. The delayed Taliban offensive against the Northern \nAlliance was apparently coordinated to begin as soon as he was killed, and it got under way on September 10.  \n\nAs they deliberated earlier in the year, Bin Ladin and Atef would likely have remembered that Mullah Omar was \ndependent on them for the Massoud assassination and for vital support in the Taliban military operations. KSM \nremembers Atef telling him that al Qaeda had an agreement with the Taliban to eliminate Massoud, after which the \nTaliban would begin an offensive to take over Afghanistan. Atef hoped Massoud's death would also appease the \nTaliban when the 9/11 attacks happened. There are also some scant indications that Omar may have been \nreconciled to the 9/11 attacks by the time they occurred.  \n\nMoving to Departure Positions \n\nIn the days just before 9/11, the hijackers returned leftover funds to al Qaeda and assembled in their departure \ncities. They sent the excess funds by wire transfer to Hawsawi in the UAE, about $26, 000 altogether.  \n\nThe hijackers targeting American Airlines Flight 77, to depart from Dulles, migrated from New Jersey to Laurel, \nMaryland, about 20 miles from Washington, D. C. They stayed in a motel during the first week in September and \nspent\n\ntime working out at a gym. On the final night before the attacks, they lodged at a hotel in Herndon, Virginia, close to \nthe airport.  \n\nFurther north, the hijackers targeting United Airlines Flight 93, to depart from Newark, gathered in that city from their \nbase in Florida on September 7. Just after midnight on September 8-9, Jarrah received a speeding ticket in \nMaryland as he headed north on I-95. He joined the rest of his team at their hotel.  \n\nAtta was still busy coordinating the teams. On September 7, he flew from Fort Lauderdale to Baltimore, presumably \nto meet with the Flight 77 team in Laurel. On September 9, he flew from Baltimore to Boston. By then, Shehhi had \narrived there, and Atta was seen with him at his hotel. The next day, Atta picked up Omari at another hotel, and the \ntwo drove to Portland, Maine, for reasons that remain unknown. In the early morning hours of September 11, they \nboarded a commuter flight to Boston to connect to American Airlines Flight 11. The two spent their last night \npursuing ordinary activities: making ATM withdrawals, eating pizza, and shopping at a convenience store. Their \nthree fellow hijackers for Flight 11 stayed together in a hotel in Newton, Massachusetts, just outside of Boston.  \n\nShehhi and his team targeting United Airlines Flight 175 from Logan Airport spent their last hours at two Boston \nhotels.   The plan that started with a proposal by KSM in 1996 had evolved to overcome numerous obstacles. Now \n19 men waited in nondescript hotel rooms to board four flights the next morning.\n\n\n\n8 \"THE SYSTEM WAS BLINKING RED\" \n\n8. 1 THE SUMMER OF THREAT \n\nAs 2001 began, counterterrorism officials were receiving frequent but fragmentary reports about threats. Indeed, \nthere appeared to be possible threats almost everywhere the United States had interests - including at home.\n\nTo understand how the escalation in threat reporting was handled in the summer of 2001, it is useful to understand \nhow threat information in general is collected and conveyed. Information is collected through several methods, \nincluding signals intelligence and interviews of human sources, and gathered into intelligence reports. Depending \non the source and nature of the reporting, these reports may be highly classified - and therefore tightly held - or less \nsensitive and widely disseminated to state and local law enforcement agencies. Threat reporting must be \ndisseminated, either through individual reports or through threat advisories. Such advisories, intended to alert their \nrecipients, may address a specific threat or be a general warning.\n\nBecause the amount of reporting is so voluminous, only a select fraction can be chosen for briefing the president \nand senior officials. During 2001, Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet was briefed regularly regarding \nthreats and other operational information relating to Usama Bin Ladin.   He in turn met daily with President Bush, \nwho was briefed by the CIA through what is known as the President's Daily Brief (PDB). Each PDB consists of a \nseries of six to eight relatively short articles or briefs covering a broad array of topics; CIA staff decides which \nsubjects are the most important on any given day. There were more than 40 intelligence articles in the PDBs from \nJanuary 20 to September 10, 2001, that related to Bin Ladin. The PDB is considered highly sensitive and is \ndistributed to only a handful of high-level officials.  \n\nThe Senior Executive Intelligence Brief (SEIB), distributed to a broader group of officials, has a similar format and \ngenerally covers the same subjects as the PDB. It usually contains less information so as to protect sources and\n\nmethods. Like their predecessors, the Attorney General, the FBI Director, and Richard Clarke, the National Security \nCouncil (NSC) counterterrorism coordinator, all received the SEIB, not the PDB.   Clarke and his staff had extensive \naccess to terrorism reporting, but they did not have access to internal, nondisseminated information at the National \nSecurity Agency (NSA), CIA, or FBI.\n\nThe Drumbeat Begins \n\nIn the spring of 2001, the level of reporting on terrorist threats and planned attacks increased dramatically to its \nhighest level since the millennium alert. At the end of March, the intelligence community disseminated a terrorist \nthreat advisory, indicating a heightened threat of Sunni extremist terrorist attacks against U. S. facilities, personnel, \nand other interests.  \n\nOn March 23, in connection with discussions about possibly reopening Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White \nHouse, Clarke warned National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice that domestic or foreign terrorists might use a \ntruck bomb - their \"weapon of choice\" - on Pennsylvania Avenue. That would result, he said, in the destruction of \nthe West Wing and parts of the residence.   He also told her that he thought there were terrorist cells within the \nUnited States, including al Qaeda.\n\nThe next week, Rice was briefed on the activities of Abu Zubaydah and on CIA efforts to locate him. As pointed out \nin chapter 6, Abu Zubaydah had been a major figure in the millennium plots. Over the next few weeks, the CIA \nrepeatedly issued warnings - including calls from DCI Tenet to Clarke - that Abu Zubaydah was planning an \noperation in the near future. One report cited a source indicating that Abu Zubaydah was planning an attack in a \ncountry that CIA analysts thought might be Israel, or perhaps Saudi Arabia or India. Clarke relayed these reports to \nRice.  \n\nIn response to these threats, the FBI sent a message to all its field offices on April 13, summarizing reporting to \ndate. It asked the offices to task all resources, including human sources and electronic databases, for any \n\n\n\ninformation pertaining to \"current operational activities relating to Sunni extremism. \" It did not suggest that there \nwas a domestic threat.  \n\nThe interagency Counterterrorism Security Group (CSG) that Clarke chaired discussed the Abu Zubaydah reports \non April 19. The next day, a briefing to top officials reported \"Bin Ladin planning multiple operations. \" When the \ndeputies discussed al Qaeda policy on April 30, they began with a briefing on the threat.  \n\nIn May 2001, the drumbeat of reporting grew louder with reports to top officials that \"Bin Ladin public profile may \npresage attack\" and \"Bin Ladin network's plans advancing. \" In early May, a walk-in to the FBI claimed there was a \nplan to launch attacks on London, Boston, and New York. Attorney General John Ashcroft was briefed by the CIA \non May 15 regarding al Qaeda generally and the current threat reporting specifically. The next day brought a report\n\nthat a phone call to a U. S. embassy had warned that Bin Ladin supporters were planning an attack in the United \nStates using \"high explosives. \" On May 17, based on the previous day's report, the first item on the CSG's agenda \nwas \"UBL: Operation Planned in U. S. \"   The anonymous caller's tip could not be corroborated.\n\nLate May brought reports of a possible hostage plot against Americans abroad to force the release of prisoners, \nincluding Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, the \"Blind Sheikh, \" who was serving a life sentence for his role in the 1993 \nplot to blow up sites in New York City. The reporting noted that operatives might opt to hijack an aircraft or storm a \nU. S. embassy. This report led to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) information circular to airlines noting the \npotential for \"an airline hijacking to free terrorists incarcerated in the United States. \" Other reporting mentioned that \nAbu Zubaydah was planning an attack, possibly against Israel, and expected to carry out several more if things \nwent well. On May 24 alone, counterterrorism officials grappled with reports alleging plots in Yemen and Italy, as \nwell as a report about a cell in Canada that an anonymous caller had claimed might be planning an attack against \nthe United States.  \n\nReports similar to many of these were made available to President Bush in morning intelligence briefings with DCI \nTenet, usually attended by Vice President Dick Cheney and National Security Advisor Rice. While these briefings \ndiscussed general threats to attack America and American interests, the specific threats mentioned in these \nbriefings were all overseas.\n\nOn May 29, Clarke suggested that Rice ask DCI Tenet what more the United States could do to stop Abu Zubaydah \nfrom launching \"a series of major terrorist attacks, \" probably on Israeli targets, but possibly on U. S. facilities. \nClarke wrote to Rice and her deputy, Stephen Hadley, \"When these attacks occur, as they likely will, we will wonder \nwhat more we could have done to stop them. \" In May, CIA Counterterrorist Center (CTC) Chief Cofer Black told \nRice that the current threat level was a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10, as compared to an 8 during the millennium.  \n\nHigh Probability of Near-Term \"Spectacular\" Attacks \n\nThreat reports surged in June and July, reaching an even higher peak of urgency. The summer threats seemed to \nbe focused on Saudi Arabia, Israel, Bahrain, Kuwait, Yemen, and possibly Rome, but the danger could be \nanywhere - including a possible attack on the G-8 summit in Genoa. A June 12 CIA report passing along \nbiographical background information on several terrorists mentioned, in commenting on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, \nthat he was recruiting people to travel to the United States to meet with colleagues already there so that they might \nconduct terrorist attacks on Bin Ladin's behalf. On June 22, the CIA notified all its station chiefs about intelligence \nsuggesting a possible al Qaeda suicide attack on a U. S. target over the next few days. DCI Tenet asked that all U. \nS. ambassadors be briefed.  \n\nThat same day, the State Department notified all embassies of the terrorist threat and updated its worldwide public \nwarning. In June, the State Department initiated the Visa Express program in Saudi Arabia as a security measure, \nin order to keep long lines of foreigners away from vulnerable embassy spaces. The program permitted visa \napplications to be made through travel agencies, instead of directly at the embassy or consulate.  \n\nA terrorist threat advisory distributed in late June indicated a high probability of near-term \"spectacular\" terrorist \nattacks resulting in numerous casualties. Other reports' titles warned, \"Bin Ladin Attacks May be Imminent\" and \n\"Bin Ladin and Associates Making Near-Term Threats. \" The latter reported multiple attacks planned over the \ncoming days, including a \"severe blow\" against U. S. and Israeli \"interests\" during the next two weeks.  \n\n\n\nOn June 21, near the height of the threat reporting, U. S. Central Command raised the force protection condition \nlevel for U. S. troops in six countries to the highest possible level, Delta. The U. S. Fifth Fleet moved out of its port \nin Bahrain, and a U. S. Marine Corps exercise in Jordan was halted. U. S. embassies in the Persian Gulf conducted \nan emergency security review, and the embassy in Yemen was closed. The CSG had foreign emergency response \nteams, known as FESTs, ready to move on four hours' notice and kept up the terrorism alert posture on a \"rolling 24 \nhour basis. \"  \n\nOn June 25, Clarke warned Rice and Hadley that six separate intelligence reports showed al Qaeda personnel \nwarning of a pending attack. An Arabic television station reported Bin Ladin's pleasure with al Qaeda leaders who \nwere saying that the next weeks \"will witness important surprises\" and that U. S. and Israeli interests will be \ntargeted. Al Qaeda also released a new recruitment and fund-raising tape. Clarke wrote that this was all too \nsophisticated to be merely a psychological operation to keep the United States on edge, and the CIA agreed. The \nintelligence reporting consistently described the upcoming attacks as occurring on a calamitous level, indicating that \nthey would cause the world to be in turmoil and that they would consist of possible multiple - but not necessarily \nsimultaneous - attacks.  \n\nOn June 28, Clarke wrote Rice that the pattern of al Qaeda activity indicating attack planning over the past six \nweeks \"had reached a crescendo. \"\"A series of new reports continue to convince me and analysts at State, CIA, \nDIA [Defense Intelligence Agency], and NSA that a major terrorist attack or series of attacks is likely in July, \" he \nnoted. One al Qaeda intelligence report warned that something \"very, very, very, very\" big was about to happen, \nand most of Bin Ladin's network was reportedly anticipating the attack. In late June, the CIA ordered all its station \nchiefs to share information on al Qaeda with their host governments and to push for immediate disruptions of cells.  \n\nThe headline of a June 30 briefing to top officials was stark:\"Bin Ladin Planning High-Profile Attacks. \" The report \nstated that Bin Ladin operatives expected near-term attacks to have dramatic consequences of catastrophic pro-\n\nportions. That same day, Saudi Arabia declared its highest level of terror alert. Despite evidence of delays possibly \ncaused by heightened U. S. security, the planning for attacks was continuing.  \n\nOn July 2, the FBI Counterterrorism Division sent a message to federal agencies and state and local law \nenforcement agencies summarizing information regarding threats from Bin Ladin. It warned that there was an \nincreased volume of threat reporting, indicating a potential for attacks against U. S. targets abroad from groups \n\"aligned with or sympathetic to Usama Bin Ladin. \" Despite the general warnings, the message further stated, \"The \nFBI has no information indicating a credible threat of terrorist attack in the United States. \" However, it went on to \nemphasize that the possibility of attack in the United States could not be discounted. It also noted that the July 4 \nholiday might heighten the threats. The report asked recipients to \"exercise extreme vigilance\" and \"report \nsuspicious activities\" to the FBI. It did not suggest specific actions that they should take to prevent attacks.  \n\nDisruption operations against al Qaeda-affiliated cells were launched involving 20 countries. Several terrorist \noperatives were detained by foreign governments, possibly disrupting operations in the Gulf and Italy and perhaps \naverting attacks against two or three U. S. embassies. Clarke and others told us of a particular concern about \npossible attacks on the Fourth of July. After it passed uneventfully, the CSG decided to maintain the alert.  \n\nTo enlist more international help, Vice President Cheney contacted Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah on July 5. Hadley \napparently called European counterparts, while Clarke worked with senior officials in the Gulf. In late July, because \nof threats, Italy closed the airspace over Genoa and mounted antiaircraft batteries at the Genoa airport during the \nG-8 summit, which President Bush attended.  \n\nAt home, the CSG arranged for the CIA to brief intelligence and security officials from several domestic agencies. \nOn July 5, representatives from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), the FAA, the Coast Guard, the \nSecret Service, Customs, the CIA, and the FBI met with Clarke to discuss the current threat. Attendees report that \nthey were told not to disseminate the threat information they received at the meeting. They interpreted this direction \nto mean that although they could brief their superiors, they could not send out advisories to the field. An NSC official \nrecalls a somewhat different emphasis, saying that attendees were asked to take the information back to their home \nagencies and \"do what you can\" with it, subject to classification and distribution restrictions. A representative from \nthe INS asked for a summary of the information that she could share with field offices. She never received one.  \n\n\n\nThat same day, the CIA briefed Attorney General Ashcroft on the al Qaeda threat, warning that a significant terrorist \nattack was imminent. Ashcroft was told that preparations for multiple attacks were in late stages or already com-\n\nplete and that little additional warning could be expected. The briefing addressed only threats outside the United \nStates.  \n\nThe next day, the CIA representative told the CSG that al Qaeda members believed the upcoming attack would be \n\"spectacular, \" qualitatively different from anything they had done to date.  \n\nApparently as a result of the July 5 meeting with Clarke, the interagency committee on federal building security was \ntasked to examine security measures. This committee met on July 9, when 37 officials from 27 agencies and \norganizations were briefed on the \"current threat level\" in the United States. They were told that not only the threat \nreports from abroad but also the recent convictions in the East Africa bombings trial, the conviction of Ahmed \nRessam, and the just-returned Khobar Towers indictments reinforced the need to \"exercise extreme vigilance. \" \nAttendees were expected to determine whether their respective agencies needed enhanced security measures.  \n\nOn July 18, 2001, the State Department provided a warning to the public regarding possible terrorist attacks in the \nArabian Peninsula.  \n\nActing FBI Director Thomas Pickard told us he had one of his periodic conference calls with all special agents in \ncharge on July 19. He said one of the items he mentioned was the need, in light of increased threat reporting, to \nhave evidence response teams ready to move at a moment's notice, in case of an attack.   He did not task field \noffices to try to determine whether any plots were being considered within the United States or to take any action to \ndisrupt any such plots.\n\nIn mid-July, reporting started to indicate that Bin Ladin's plans had been delayed, maybe for as long as two months, \nbut not abandoned. On July 23, the lead item for CSG discussion was still the al Qaeda threat, and it included \nmention of suspected terrorist travel to the United States.  \n\nOn July 31, an FAA circular appeared alerting the aviation community to \"reports of possible near-term terrorist \noperations . . . particularly on the Arabian Peninsula and/or Israel. \" It stated that the FAA had no credible evidence \nof specific plans to attack U. S. civil aviation, though it noted that some of the \"currently active\" terrorist groups were \nknown to \"plan and train for hijackings\" and were able to build and conceal sophisticated explosive devices in \nluggage and consumer products.  \n\nTenet told us that in his world \"the system was blinking red. \" By late July, Tenet said, it could not\"get any worse. \"   \nNot everyone was convinced. Some asked whether all these threats might just be deception. On June 30, the SEIB \ncontained an article titled \"Bin Ladin Threats Are Real. \"Yet Hadley told Tenet in July that Deputy Secretary of \nDefense Paul Wolfowitz questioned the reporting. Perhaps Bin Ladin was trying to study U. S. reactions. Tenet \nreplied that he had already addressed the Defense Department's questions on this point; the reporting was \nconvincing. To give a sense of his anxiety at the time, one senior\n\nofficial in the Counterterrorist Center told us that he and a colleague were considering resigning in order to go public \nwith their concerns.  \n\nThe Calm Before the Storm \n\nOn July 27, Clarke informed Rice and Hadley that the spike in intelligence about a near-term al Qaeda attack had \nstopped. He urged keeping readiness high during the August vacation period, warning that another report \nsuggested an attack had just been postponed for a few months \"but will still happen. \"  \n\nOn August 1, the FBI issued an advisory that in light of the increased volume of threat reporting and the upcoming \nanniversary of the East Africa embassy bombings, increased attention should be paid to security planning. It noted \nthat although most of the reporting indicated a potential for attacks on U. S. interests abroad, the possibility of an \nattack in the United States could not be discounted.  \n\nOn August 3, the intelligence community issued an advisory concluding that the threat of impending al Qaeda \nattacks would likely continue indefinitely. Citing threats in the Arabian Peninsula, Jordan, Israel, and Europe, the \n\n\n\nadvisory suggested that al Qaeda was lying in wait and searching for gaps in security before moving forward with \nthe planned attacks.  \n\nDuring the spring and summer of 2001, President Bush had on several occasions asked his briefers whether any of \nthe threats pointed to the United States. Reflecting on these questions, the CIA decided to write a briefing article \nsummarizing its understanding of this danger. Two CIA analysts involved in preparing this briefing article believed it \nrepresented an opportunity to communicate their view that the threat of a Bin Ladin attack in the United States \nremained both current and serious.   The result was an article in the August 6 Presidential Daily Brief titled \"Bin \nLadin Determined to Strike in US. \" It was the 36th PDB item briefed so far that year that related to Bin Ladin or al \nQaeda, and the first devoted to the possibility of an attack in the United States.\n\nThe President told us the August 6 report was historical in nature. President Bush said the article told him that al \nQaeda was dangerous, which he said he had known since he had become President. The President said Bin Ladin \nhad long been talking about his desire to attack America. He recalled some operational data on the FBI, and \nremembered thinking it was heartening that 70 investigations were under way. As best he could recollect, Rice had \nmentioned that the Yemenis' surveillance of a federal building in New York had been looked into in May and June, \nbut there was no actionable intelligence.\n\nHe did not recall discussing the August 6 report with the Attorney General or whether Rice had done so. He said \nthat if his advisers had told him there was a cell in the United States, they would have moved to take care of it. That \nnever happened.  \n\nAlthough the following day's SEIB repeated the title of this PDB, it did not contain the reference to hijackings, the \nalert in New York, the alleged casing\n\nSidebar 5: \n\nof buildings in New York, the threat phoned in to the embassy, or the fact that the FBI had approximately 70 \nongoing bin Ladin-related investigations.   No CSG or other NSC meeting was held to discuss the possible threat of \na strike in the United States as a result of this report.\n\nLate in the month, a foreign service reported that Abu Zubaydah was considering mounting terrorist attacks in the \nUnited States, after postponing possible operations in Europe. No targets, timing, or method of attack were \nprovided.  \n\nWe have found no indication of any further discussion before September 11 among the President and his top \nadvisers of the possibility of a threat of an al Qaeda attack in the United States. DCI Tenet visited President Bush in \nCrawford, Texas, on August 17 and participated in PDB briefings of the President between August 31 (after the \nPresident had returned to Washington) and September 10. But Tenet does not recall any discussions with the \nPresident of the domestic threat during this period.  \n\nMost of the intelligence community recognized in the summer of 2001 that the number and severity of threat reports \nwere unprecedented. Many officials told us that they knew something terrible was planned, and they were \ndesperate to stop it. Despite their large number, the threats received contained few\n\nspecifics regarding time, place, method, or target. Most suggested that attacks were planned against targets \noverseas; others indicated threats against unspecified \"U. S. interests. \"We cannot say for certain whether these \nreports, as dramatic as they were, related to the 9/11 attacks.\n\nGovernment Response to the Threats \n\nNational Security Advisor Rice told us that the CSG was the \"nerve center\" for running the crisis, although other \nsenior officials were involved over the course of the summer. In addition to his daily meetings with President Bush, \nand weekly meetings to go over other issues with Rice, Tenet was speaking regularly with Secretary of State Colin \nPowell and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. The foreign policy principals routinely talked on the telephone \nevery day on a variety of topics.  \n\n\n\nHadley told us that before 9/11, he and Rice did not feel they had the job of coordinating domestic agencies. They \nfelt that Clarke and the CSG (part of the NSC) were the NSC's bridge between foreign and domestic threats.  \n\nThere was a clear disparity in the levels of response to foreign versus domestic threats. Numerous actions were \ntaken overseas to disrupt possible attacks - enlisting foreign partners to upset terrorist plans, closing embassies, \nmoving military assets out of the way of possible harm. Far less was done domestically - in part, surely, because to \nthe extent that specifics did exist, they pertained to threats overseas. As noted earlier, a threat against the embassy \nin Yemen quickly resulted in its closing. Possible domestic threats were more vague. When reports did not specify \nwhere the attacks were to take place, officials presumed that they would again be overseas, though they did not \nrule out a target in the United States. Each of the FBI threat advisories made this point.  \n\nClarke mentioned to National Security Advisor Rice at least twice that al Qaeda sleeper cells were likely in the \nUnited States. In January 2001, Clarke forwarded a strategy paper to Rice warning that al Qaeda had a presence in \nthe United States. He noted that two key al Qaeda members in the Jordanian cell involved in the millennium plot \nwere naturalized U. S. citizens and that one jihadist suspected in the East Africa bombings had \"informed the FBI \nthat an extensive network of al Qida 'sleeper agents' currently exists in the US. \" He added that Ressam's abortive \nDecember 1999 attack revealed al Qaeda supporters in the United States.   His analysis, however, was based not \non new threat reporting but on past experience.\n\nThe September 11 attacks fell into the void between the foreign and domestic threats. The foreign intelligence \nagencies were watching overseas, alert to foreign threats to U. S. interests there. The domestic agencies were \nwaiting for evidence of a domestic threat from sleeper cells within the United States. No one was looking for a \nforeign threat to domestic targets. The threat that was coming was not from sleeper cells. It was foreign - but from \nforeigners who had infiltrated into the United States.\n\nA second cause of this disparity in response is that domestic agencies did not know what to do, and no one gave \nthem direction. Cressey told us that the CSG did not tell the agencies how to respond to the threats. He noted that \nthe agencies that were operating overseas did not need direction on how to respond; they had experience with such \nthreats and had a \"playbook. \" In contrast, the domestic agencies did not have a game plan. Neither the NSC \n(including the CSG) nor anyone else instructed them to create one.  \n\nThis lack of direction was evident in the July 5 meeting with representatives from the domestic agencies. The \nbriefing focused on overseas threats. The domestic agencies were not questioned about how they planned to \naddress the threat and were not told what was expected of them. Indeed, as noted earlier, they were specifically \ntold they could not issue advisories based on the briefing.   The domestic agencies' limited response indicates that \nthey did not perceive a call to action.\n\nClarke reflected a different perspective in an email to Rice on September 15, 2001. He summarized the steps taken \nby the CSG to alert domestic agencies to the possibility of an attack in the United States. Clarke concluded that \ndomestic agencies, including the FAA, knew that the CSG believed a major al Qaeda attack was coming and could \nbe in the United States.\n\nAlthough the FAA had authority to issue security directives mandating new security procedures, none of the few \nthat were released during the summer of 2001 increased security at checkpoints or on board aircraft. The \ninformation circulars mostly urged air carriers to \"exercise prudence\" and be alert. Prior to 9/11, the FAA did present \na CD-ROM to air carriers and airport authorities describing the increased threat to civil aviation. The presentation \nmentioned the possibility of suicide hijackings but said that \"fortunately, we have no indication that any group is \ncurrently thinking in that direction. \"   The FAA conducted 27 special security briefings for specific air carriers \nbetween May 1, 2001, and September 11, 2001. Two of these briefings discussed the hijacking threat overseas. \nNone discussed the possibility of suicide hijackings or the use of aircraft as weapons. No new security measures \nwere instituted.  \n\nRice told us she understood that the FBI had tasked its 56 U. S. field offices to increase surveillance of suspected \nterrorists and to reach out to informants who might have information about terrorist plots. An NSC staff document at \nthe time describes such a tasking as having occurred in late June but does not indicate whether it was generated by \nthe NSC or the FBI. Other than the previously described April 13 communication sent to all FBI field offices, \nhowever, the FBI could not find any record of having received such a directive. The April 13 document asking field \n\n\n\noffices to gather information on Sunni extremism did not mention any possible threat within the United States and \ndid not order surveillance of suspected operatives. The NSC did not specify what the FBI's directives should \ncontain and did not review what had been issued earlier.  \n\nActing FBI Director Pickard told us that in addition to his July 19 conference call, he mentioned the heightened \nterrorist threat in individual calls with the special agents in charge of field offices during their annual performance \nreview discussions. In speaking with agents around the country, we found little evidence that any such concerns \nhad reached FBI personnel beyond the New York Field Office.  \n\nThe head of counterterrorism at the FBI, Dale Watson, said he had many discussions about possible attacks with \nCofer Black at the CIA. They had expected an attack on July 4. Watson said he felt deeply that something was \ngoing to happen. But he told us the threat information was \"nebulous. \" He wished he had known more. He wished \nhe had had \"500 analysts looking at Usama Bin Ladin threat information instead of two. \"  \n\nAttorney General Ashcroft was briefed by the CIA in May and by Pickard in early July about the danger. Pickard \nsaid he met with Ashcroft once a week in late June, through July, and twice in August. There is a dispute regarding \nAshcroft's interest in Pickard's briefings about the terrorist threat situation. Pickard told us that after two such \nbriefings Ashcroft told him that he did not want to hear about the threats anymore. Ashcroft denies Pickard's \ncharge. Pickard says he continued to present terrorism information during further briefings that summer, but nothing \nfurther on the \"chatter\" the U. S. government was receiving.  \n\nThe Attorney General told us he asked Pickard whether there was intelligence about attacks in the United States \nand that Pickard said no. Pickard said he replied that he could not assure Ashcroft that there would be no attacks in \nthe United States, although the reports of threats were related to overseas targets. Ashcroft said he therefore \nassumed the FBI was doing what it needed to do. He acknowledged that in retrospect, this was a dangerous \nassumption. He did not ask the FBI what it was doing in response to the threats and did not task it to take any \nspecific action. He also did not direct the INS, then still part of the Department of Justice, to take any specific action.  \n\nIn sum, the domestic agencies never mobilized in response to the threat. They did not have direction, and did not \nhave a plan to institute. The borders were not hardened. Transportation systems were not fortified. Electronic \nsurveillance was not targeted against a domestic threat.   State and local law enforcement were not marshaled to \naugment the FBI's efforts. The public was not warned.\n\nThe terrorists exploited deep institutional failings within our government. The question is whether extra vigilance \nmight have turned up an opportunity to disrupt the plot. As seen in chapter 7, al Qaeda's operatives made mistakes. \nAt least two such mistakes created opportunities during 2001, especially in late August.\n\n8. 2 LATE LEADS - MIHDHAR, MOUSSAOUI, AND KSM \n\nIn chapter 6 we discussed how intelligence agencies successfully detected some of the early travel in the planes \noperation, picking up the movements of Khalid al Mihdhar and identifying him, and seeing his travel converge with \nsomeone they perhaps could have identified but did not - Nawaf al Hazmi - as well as with less easily identifiable \npeople such as Khallad and Abu Bara. These observations occurred in December 1999 and January 2000. The trail \nhad been lost in January 2000 without a clear realization that it had been lost, and without much effort to pick it up \nagain. Nor had the CIA placed Mihdhar on the State Department's watchlist for suspected terrorists, so that either \nan embassy or a port of entry might take note if Mihdhar showed up again.\n\nOn four occasions in 2001, the CIA, the FBI, or both had apparent opportunities to refocus on the significance of \nHazmi and Mihdhar and reinvigorate the search for them. After reviewing those episodes we will turn to the \nhandling of the Moussaoui case and some late leads regarding Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.\n\nJanuary 2001: Identification of Khallad \n\nAlmost one year after the original trail had been lost in Bangkok, the FBI and the CIA were working on the \ninvestigation of the Cole bombing. They learned of the link between a captured conspirator and a person called \n\n\n\n\"Khallad. \"They also learned that Khallad was a senior security official for Bin Ladin who had helped direct the \nbombing (we introduced Khallad in chapter 5, and returned to his role in the Cole bombing in chapter 6).  \n\nOne of the members of the FBI's investigative team in Yemen realized that he had heard of Khallad before, from a \njoint FBI/CIA source four months earlier. The FBI agent obtained from a foreign government a photo of the person \nbelieved to have directed the Cole bombing. It was shown to the source, and he confirmed that the man in that \nphotograph was the same Khallad he had described.  \n\nIn December 2000, on the basis of some links associated with Khalid al Mihdhar, the CIA's Bin Ladin unit \nspeculated that Khallad and Khalid al Mihdhar might be one and the same.  \n\nThe CIA asked that a Kuala Lumpur surveillance photo of Mihdhar be shown to the joint source who had identified \nKhallad. In early January 2001, two photographs from the Kuala Lumpur meeting were shown to the source. One \nwas a known photograph of Mihdhar, the other a photograph of a then unknown subject. The source did not \nrecognize Mihdhar. But he indicated he was 90 percent certain that the other individual was Khallad.  \n\nThis meant that Khallad and Mihdhar were two different people. It also meant that there was a link between Khallad \nand Mihdhar, making Mihdhar seem even more suspicious.   Yet we found no effort by the CIA to renew the long-\nabandoned search for Mihdhar or his travel companions.\n\nIn addition, we found that the CIA did not notify the FBI of this identification. DCI Tenet and Cofer Black testified \nbefore Congress's Joint Inquiry into 9/11 that the FBI had access to this identification from the beginning. But \ndrawing on an extensive record, including documents that were not available to the CIA personnel who drafted that \ntestimony, we conclude this was not the case. The FBI's primary Cole investigators had no knowledge that Khallad \nhad been in Kuala Lumpur with Mihdhar and others until after the September 11 attacks. Because the FBI had not \nbeen informed in January 2000 about Mihdhar's possession of a U. S. visa, it had not then started looking for him in \nthe United States. Because it did not know of the links between Khallad and Mihdhar, it did not start looking for him \nin January 2001.  \n\nThis incident is an example of how day-to-day gaps in information sharing can emerge even when there is mutual \ngoodwill. The information was from a joint FBI/CIA source who spoke essentially no English and whose languages \nwere not understood by the FBI agent on the scene overseas. Issues of travel and security necessarily kept short \nthe amount of time spent with the source. As a result, the CIA officer usually did not translate either questions or \nanswers for his FBI colleague and friend.  \n\nFor interviews without simultaneous translation, the FBI agent on the scene received copies of the reports that the \nCIA disseminated to other agencies regarding the interviews. But he was not given access to the CIA's internal \noperational reports, which contained more detail. It was there - in reporting to which FBI investigators did not have \naccess - that information regarding the January 2001 identification of Khallad appeared. The CIA officer does not \nrecall this particular identification and thus cannot say why it was not shared with his FBI colleague. He might not \nhave understood the possible significance of the new identification.  \n\nIn June 2000, Mihdhar left California and returned to Yemen. It is possible that if, in January 2001, the CIA had \nresumed its search for him, placed him on the State Department's TIPOFF watchlist, or provided the FBI with the \ninformation, he might have been found - either before or at the time he applied for a new visa in June 2001, or when \nhe returned to the United States on July 4.\n\nSpring 2001: Looking Again at Kuala Lumpur \n\nBy mid-May 2001, as the threat reports were surging, a CIA official detailed to the International Terrorism \nOperations Section at the FBI wondered where the attacks might occur. We will call him \"John. \" Recalling the \nepisode about the Kuala Lumpur travel of Mihdhar and his associates, \"John\" searched the CIA's databases for \ninformation regarding the travel. On May 15, he and an official at the CIA reexamined many of the old cables from \nearly 2000, including the information that Mihdhar had a U. S. visa, and that Hazmi had come to Los Angeles on \nJanuary 15, 2000.  \n\nThe CIA official who reviewed the cables took no action regarding them.\n\n\n\n\"John, \" however, began a lengthy exchange with a CIA analyst, whom we will call \"Dave, \" to figure out what these \ncables meant. \"John\" was aware of how dangerous Khallad was - at one point calling him a \"major league killer. \" \nHe concluded that \"something bad was definitely up. \" Despite the U. S. links evident in this traffic, \"John\" made no \neffort to determine whether any of these individuals was in the United States. He did not raise that possibility with \nhis FBI counterpart. He was focused on Malaysia.  \n\n\"John\"described the CIA as an agency that tended to play a \"zone defense. \" He was worrying solely about \nSoutheast Asia, not the United States. In contrast, he told us, the FBI tends to play \"man-to-man. \"  \n\nDesk officers at the CIA's Bin Ladin unit did not have \"cases\" in the same sense as an FBI agent who works an \ninvestigation from beginning to end. Thus, when the trail went cold after the Kuala Lumpur meeting in January \n2000, the desk officer moved on to different things. By the time the March 2000 cable arrived with information that \none of the travelers had flown to Los Angeles, the case officer was no longer responsible for follow-up. While \nseveral individuals at the Bin Ladin unit opened the cable when it arrived in March 2000, no action was taken.  \n\nThe CIA's zone defense concentrated on \"where, \"not \"who. \"Had its information been shared with the FBI, a \ncombination of the CIA's zone defense and the FBI's man-to-man approach might have been productive.\n\nJune 2001:The Meeting in New York \n\n\"John's\" review of the Kuala Lumpur meeting did set off some more sharing of information, getting the attention of \nan FBI analyst whom we will call \"Jane. \" \"Jane\" was assigned to the FBI's Cole investigation. She knew that \nanother terrorist involved in that operation, Fahd al Quso, had traveled to Bangkok in January 2000 to give money \nto Khallad.  \n\n\"Jane\" and the CIA analyst, \"Dave, \" had been working together on Cole related issues. Chasing Quso's trail, \n\"Dave\" suggested showing some photographs to FBI agents in New York who were working on the Cole case and \nhad interviewed Quso.  \n\n\"John\" gave three Kuala Lumpur surveillance pictures to \"Jane\" to show to the New York agents. She was told that \none of the individuals in the photographs was someone named Khalid al Mihdhar. She did not know why the \nphotographs had been taken or why the Kuala Lumpur travel might be significant, and she was not told that \nsomeone had identified Khallad in the photographs. When \"Jane\" did some research in a database for intelligence \nreports, Intelink, she found the original NSA reports on the planning for the meeting. Because the CIA had not \ndisseminated reports on its tracking of Mihdhar, \"Jane\"did not pull up any information about Mihdhar's U. S. visa or \nabout travel to the United States by Hazmi or Mihdhar.  \n\n\"Jane, \"\"Dave, \" and an FBI analyst who was on detail to the CIA's Bin Ladin\n\nunit went to New York on June 11 to meet with the agents about the Cole case. \"Jane\" brought the surveillance \npictures. At some point in the meeting she showed the photographs to the agents and asked whether they \nrecognized Quso in any of them. The agents asked questions about the photographs - Why were they taken? Why \nwere these people being followed? Where are the rest of the photographs?  \n\nThe only information \"Jane\" had about the meeting - other than the photographs - were the NSA reports that she \nhad found on Intelink. These reports, however, contained caveats that their contents could not be shared with \ncriminal investigators without the permission of the Justice Department's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review \n(OIPR). Therefore \"Jane\" concluded that she could not pass on information from those reports to the agents. This \ndecision was potentially significant, because the signals intelligence she did not share linked Mihdhar to a \nsuspected terrorist facility in the Middle East. The agents would have established a link to the suspected facility \nfrom their work on the embassy bombings case. This link would have made them very interested in learning more \nabout Mihdhar.   The sad irony is that the agents who found the source were being kept from obtaining the fruits of \ntheir own work.\n\n\"Dave, \" the CIA analyst, knew more about the Kuala Lumpur meeting. He knew that Mihdhar possessed a U. S. \nvisa, that his visa application indicated that he intended to travel to New York, that Hazmi had traveled to Los \nAngeles, and that a source had put Mihdhar in the company of Khallad. No one at the meeting asked him what he \n\n\n\nknew; he did not volunteer anything. He told investigators that as a CIA analyst, he was not authorized to answer \nFBI questions regarding CIA information. \"Jane\" said she assumed that if \"Dave\" knew the answers to questions, \nhe would have volunteered them. The New York agents left the meeting without obtaining information that might \nhave started them looking for Mihdhar.  \n\nMihdhar had been a weak link in al Qaeda's operational planning. He had left the United States in June 2000, a \nmistake KSM realized could endanger the entire plan - for to continue with the operation, Mihdhar would have to \ntravel to the United States again. And unlike other operatives, Mihdhar was not \"clean\": he had jihadist connections. \nIt was just such connections that had brought him to the attention of U. S. officials.\n\nNevertheless, in this case KSM's fears were not realized. Mihdhar received a new U. S. visa two days after the CIA-\nFBI meeting in New York. He flew to New York City on July 4. No one was looking for him.\n\nAugust 2001:The Search for Mihdhar and Hazmi Begins and Fails \n\nDuring the summer of 2001 \"John, \" following a good instinct but not as part of any formal assignment, asked \n\"Mary, \" an FBI analyst detailed to the CIA's Bin Ladin unit, to review all the Kuala Lumpur materials one more time. \nShe had been at the New York meeting with \"Jane\" and \"Dave\" but had not\n\nlooked into the issues yet herself. \"John\" asked her to do the research in her free time.  \n\n\"Mary\" began her work on July 24. That day, she found the cable reporting that Mihdhar had a visa to the United \nStates. A week later, she found the cable reporting that Mihdhar's visa application - what was later discovered to be \nhis first application - listed New York as his destination. On August 21, she located the March 2000 cable that \n\"noted with interest\" that Hazmi had flown to Los Angeles in January 2000. She immediately grasped the \nsignificance of this information.  \n\n\"Mary\" and \"Jane\" promptly met with an INS representative at FBI headquarters. On August 22, the INS told them \nthat Mihdhar had entered the United States on January 15, 2000, and again on July 4, 2001. \"Jane\" and \"Mary\" \nalso learned that there was no record that Hazmi had left the country since January 2000, and they assumed he \nhad left with Mihdhar in June 2000. They decided that if Mihdhar was in the United States, he should be found.  \n\nThey divided up the work. \"Mary\" asked the Bin Ladin unit to draft a cable requesting that Mihdhar and Hazmi be \nput on the TIPOFF watchlist. Both Hazmi and Mihdhar were added to this watchlist on August 24.  \n\n\"Jane\" took responsibility for the search effort inside the United States. As the information indicated that Mihdhar \nhad last arrived in New York, she began drafting what is known as a lead for the FBI's New York Field Office. A \nlead relays information from one part of the FBI to another and requests that a particular action be taken. She called \nan agent in New York to give him a \"headsup\" on the matter, but her draft lead was not sent until August 28. Her \nemail told the New York agent that she wanted him to get started as soon as possible, but she labeled the lead as \n\"Routine\" - a designation that informs the receiving office that it has 30 days to respond.  \n\nThe agent who received the lead forwarded it to his squad supervisor. That same day, the supervisor forwarded the \nlead to an intelligence agent to open an intelligence case - an agent who thus was behind \"the wall\" keeping FBI \nintelligence information from being shared with criminal prosecutors. He also sent it to the Cole case agents and an \nagent who had spent significant time in Malaysia searching for another Khalid: Khalid Sheikh Mohammad.  \n\nThe suggested goal of the investigation was to locate Mihdhar, determine his contacts and reasons for being in the \nUnited States, and possibly conduct an interview. Before sending the lead, \"Jane\" had discussed it with \"John, \" the \nCIA official on detail to the FBI. She had also checked with the acting head of the FBI's Bin Ladin unit. The \ndiscussion seems to have been limited to whether the search should be classified as an intelligence investigation or \nas a criminal one. It appears that no one informed higher levels of management in either the FBI or CIA about the \ncase.   There is no evidence that the lead, or the search for these terrorist suspects, was substantively discussed \nat any level\n\nabove deputy chief of a section within the Counterterrorism Division at FBI headquarters.\n\n\n\nOne of the Cole case agents read the lead with interest, and contacted \"Jane\" to obtain more information. \n\"Jane\"argued, however, that because the agent was designated a \"criminal\" FBI agent, not an intelligence FBI \nagent, the wall kept him from participating in any search for Mihdhar. In fact, she felt he had to destroy his copy of \nthe lead because it contained NSA information from reports that included caveats ordering that the information not \nbe shared without OIPR's permission. The agent asked \"Jane\" to get an opinion from the FBI's National Security \nLaw Unit (NSLU) on whether he could open a criminal case on Mihdhar.  \n\n\"Jane\" sent an email to the Cole case agent explaining that according to the NSLU, the case could be opened only \nas an intelligence matter, and that if Mihdhar was found, only designated intelligence agents could conduct or even \nbe present at any interview. She appears to have misunderstood the complex rules that could apply to this situation.  \n\nThe FBI agent angrily responded:\n\n        Whatever has happened to this - someday someone will die - and wall\n\n        or not - the public will not understand why we were not more\n\n        effective and throwing every resource we had at certain \"problems.\n\n        \" Let's hope the National Security Law Unit will stand behind\n\n        their decisions then, especially since the biggest threat to us\n\n        now, UBL, is getting the most \"protection. \"\n\n\"Jane\" replied that she was not making up the rules; she claimed that they were in the relevant manual and \n\"ordered by the [FISA] Court and every office of the FBI is required to follow them including FBI NY. \"  \n\nIt is now clear that everyone involved was confused about the rules governing the sharing and use of information \ngathered in intelligence channels. Because Mihdhar was being sought for his possible connection to or knowledge \nof the Cole bombing, he could be investigated or tracked under the existing Cole criminal case. No new criminal \ncase was needed for the criminal agent to begin searching for Mihdhar. And as NSA had approved the passage of \nits information to the criminal agent, he could have conducted a search using all available information. As a result of \nthis confusion, the criminal agents who were knowledgeable about al Qaeda and experienced with criminal \ninvestigative techniques, including finding suspects and possible criminal charges, were thus excluded from the \nsearch.  \n\nThe search was assigned to one FBI agent, and it was his very first counterterrorism lead. Because the lead was \n\"routine, \" he was given 30 days to open an intelligence case and make some unspecified efforts to locate Mihdhar. \nHe started the process a few days later. He checked local New York databases for\n\ncriminal record and driver's license information and checked the hotel listed on Mihdhar's U. S. entry form. Finally, \non September 11, the agent sent a lead to Los Angeles, because Mihdhar had initially arrived in Los Angeles in \nJanuary 2000.  \n\nWe believe that if more resources had been applied and a significantly different approach taken, Mihdhar and \nHazmi might have been found. They had used their true names in the United States. Still, the investigators would \nhave needed luck as well as skill to find them prior to September 11 even if such searches had begun as early as \nAugust 23, when the lead was first drafted.  \n\nMany FBI witnesses have suggested that even if Mihdhar had been found, there was nothing the agents could have \ndone except follow him onto the planes. We believe this is incorrect. Both Hazmi and Mihdhar could have been held \nfor immigration violations or as material witnesses in the Cole bombing case. Investigation or interrogation of them, \nand investigation of their travel and financial activities, could have yielded evidence of connections to other \nparticipants in the 9/11 plot. The simple fact of their detention could have derailed the plan. In any case, the \nopportunity did not arise.\n\nPhoenix Memo \n\n\n\nThe Phoenix memo was investigated thoroughly by the Joint Inquiry and the Department of Justice Inspector \nGeneral.   We will recap it briefly here. In July 2001, an FBI agent in the Phoenix field office sent a memo to FBI \nheadquarters and to two agents on international terrorism squads in the New York Field Office, advising of the \n\"possibility of a coordinated effort by Usama Bin Ladin\" to send students to the United States to attend civil aviation \nschools. The agent based his theory on the \"inordinate number of individuals of investigative interest\" attending \nsuch schools in Arizona.  \n\nThe agent made four recommendations to FBI headquarters: to compile a list of civil aviation schools, establish \nliaison with those schools, discuss his theories about Bin Ladin with the intelligence community, and seek authority \nto obtain visa information on persons applying to flight schools. His recommendations were not acted on. His memo \nwas forwarded to one field office. Managers of the Usama Bin Ladin unit and the Radical Fundamentalist unit at FBI \nheadquarters were addressees, but they did not even see the memo until after September 11. No managers at \nheadquarters saw the memo before September 11, and the New York Field Office took no action.  \n\nAs its author told investigators, the Phoenix memo was not an alert about suicide pilots. His worry was more about \na Pan Am Flight 103 scenario in which explosives were placed on an aircraft. The memo's references to aviation \ntraining were broad, including aeronautical engineering.   If the memo had been distributed in a timely fashion and \nits recommendations acted on promptly, we do not believe it would have uncovered the plot. It might well, however, \nhave sensitized the FBI so that it might have taken the Moussaoui matter more seriously the next month.\n\nZacarias Moussaoui \n\nOn August 15, 2001, the Minneapolis FBI Field Office initiated an intelligence investigation on Zacarias Moussaoui. \nAs mentioned in chapter 7, he had entered the United States in February 2001, and had begun flight lessons at \nAirman Flight School in Norman, Oklahoma. He resumed his training at the Pan Am International Flight Academy in \nEagan, Minnesota, starting on August 13. He had none of the usual qualifications for flight training on Pan Am's \nBoeing 747 flight simulators. He said he did not intend to become a commercial pilot but wanted the training as an \n\"ego boosting thing. \" Moussaoui stood out because, with little knowledge of flying, he wanted to learn how to \"take \noff and land\" a Boeing 747.  \n\nThe agent in Minneapolis quickly learned that Moussaoui possessed jihadist beliefs. Moreover, Moussaoui had $32, \n000 in a bank account but did not provide a plausible explanation for this sum of money. He had traveled to \nPakistan but became agitated when asked if he had traveled to nearby countries while in Pakistan (Pakistan was \nthe customary route to the training camps in Afghanistan). He planned to receive martial arts training, and intended \nto purchase a global positioning receiver. The agent also noted that Moussaoui became extremely agitated \nwhenever he was questioned regarding his religious beliefs. The agent concluded that Moussaoui was \"an Islamic \nextremist preparing for some future act in furtherance of radical fundamentalist goals. \" He also believed \nMoussaoui's plan was related to his flight training.  \n\nMoussaoui can be seen as an al Qaeda mistake and a missed opportunity. An apparently unreliable operative, he \nhad fallen into the hands of the FBI. As discussed in chapter 7, Moussaoui had been in contact with and received \nmoney from Ramzi Binalshibh. If Moussaoui had been connected to al Qaeda, questions should instantly have \narisen about a possible al Qaeda plot that involved piloting airliners, a possibility that had never been seriously \nanalyzed by the intelligence community.\n\nThe FBI agent who handled the case in conjunction with the INS representative on the Minneapolis Joint Terrorism \nTask Force suspected that Moussaoui might be planning to hijack a plane. Minneapolis and FBI headquarters \ndebated whether Moussaoui should be arrested immediately or surveilled to obtain additional information. Because \nit was not clear whether Moussaoui could be imprisoned, the FBI case agent decided the most important thing was \nto prevent Moussaoui from obtaining any further training that he could use to carry out a potential attack.  \n\nAs a French national who had overstayed his visa, Moussaoui could be detained immediately. The INS arrested \nMoussaoui on the immigration violation. A deportation order was signed on August 17, 2001.  \n\n\n\nThe agents in Minnesota were concerned that the U. S. Attorney's Office in Minneapolis would find insufficient \nprobable cause of a crime to obtain a criminal warrant to search Moussaoui's laptop computer.   Agents at FBI \nheadquarters believed there was insufficient probable cause. Minneapolis therefore\n\nsought a special warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to conduct the search (we introduced FISA \nin chapter 3).\n\nTo do so, however, the FBI needed to demonstrate probable cause that Moussaoui was an agent of a foreign \npower, a demonstration that was not required to obtain a criminal warrant but was a statutory requirement for a \nFISA warrant.   The case agent did not have sufficient information to connect Moussaoui to a \"foreign power, \"so he \nreached out for help, in the United States and overseas.\n\nThe FBI agent's August 18 message requested assistance from the FBI legal attache in Paris. Moussaoui had lived \nin London, so the Minneapolis agent sought assistance from the legal attache there as well. By August 24, the \nMinneapolis agent had also contacted an FBI detailee and a CIA desk officer at the Counterterrorist Center about \nthe case.  \n\nThe FBI legal attache's office in Paris first contacted the French government on August 16 or 17, shortly after \nspeaking to the Minneapolis case agent on the telephone. On August 22 and 27, the French provided information \nthat made a connection between Moussaoui and a rebel leader in Chechnya, Ibn al Khattab. This set off a spirited \ndebate between the Minneapolis Field Office, FBI headquarters, and the CIA as to whether the Chechen rebels and \nKhattab were sufficiently associated with a terrorist organization to constitute a \"foreign power\" for purposes of the \nFISA statute. FBI headquarters did not believe this was good enough, and its National Security Law Unit declined to \nsubmit a FISA application.  \n\nAfter receiving the written request for assistance, the legal attache in London had promptly forwarded it to his \ncounterparts in the British government, hand-delivering the request on August 21. On August 24, the CIA also sent \na cable to London and Paris regarding \"subjects involved in suspicious 747 flight training\" that described Moussaoui \nas a possible \"suicide hijacker. \" On August 28, the CIA sent a request for information to a different service of the \nBritish government; this communication warned that Moussaoui might be expelled to Britain by the end of August. \nThe FBI office in London raised the matter briefly with British officials as an aside, after a meeting about a more \nurgent matter on September 3, and sent the British service a written update on September 5. The case was not \nhandled by the British as a priority amid a large number of other terrorist-related inquiries.  \n\nOn September 4, the FBI sent a teletype to the CIA, the FAA, the Customs Service, the State Department, the INS, \nand the Secret Service summarizing the known facts regarding Moussaoui. It did not report the case agent's \npersonal assessment that Moussaoui planned to hijack an airplane. It did contain the FAA's comment that it was not \nunusual for Middle Easterners to attend flight training schools in the United States.  \n\nAlthough the Minneapolis agents wanted to tell the FAA from the beginning about Moussaoui, FBI headquarters \ninstructed Minneapolis that it could\n\nnot share the more complete report the case agent had prepared for the FAA. The Minneapolis supervisor sent the \ncase agent in person to the local FAA office to fill in what he thought were gaps in the FBI headquarters teletype.   \nNo FAA actions seem to have been taken in response.\n\nThere was substantial disagreement between Minneapolis agents and FBI headquarters as to what Moussaoui was \nplanning to do. In one conversation between a Minneapolis supervisor and a headquarters agent, the latter \ncomplained that Minneapolis's FISA request was couched in a manner intended to get people \"spun up. \"The \nsupervisor replied that was precisely his intent. He said he was \"trying to keep someone from taking a plane and \ncrashing into the World Trade Center. \" The headquarters agent replied that this was not going to happen and that \nthey did not know if Moussaoui was a terrorist.  \n\nThere is no evidence that either FBI Acting Director Pickard or Assistant Director for Counterterrorism Dale Watson \nwas briefed on the Moussaoui case prior to 9/11. Michael Rolince, the FBI assistant director heading the Bureau's \nInternational Terrorism Operations Section (ITOS), recalled being told about Moussaoui in two passing hallway \nconversations but only in the context that he might be receiving telephone calls from Minneapolis complaining about \nhow headquarters was handling the matter. He never received such a call. Although the acting special agent in \n\n\n\ncharge of Minneapolis called the ITOS supervisors to discuss the Moussaoui case on August 27, he declined to go \nup the chain of command at FBI headquarters and call Rolince.  \n\nOn August 23, DCI Tenet was briefed about the Moussaoui case in a briefing titled \"Islamic Extremist Learns to Fly. \n\"   Tenet was also told that Moussaoui wanted to learn to fly a 747, paid for his training in cash, was interested to \nlearn the doors do not open in flight, and wanted to fly a simulated flight from London to New York. He was told that \nthe FBI had arrested Moussaoui because of a visa overstay and that the CIA was working the case with the FBI. \nTenet told us that no connection to al Qaeda was apparent to him at the time. Seeing it as an FBI case, he did not \ndiscuss the matter with anyone at the White House or the FBI. No connection was made between Moussaoui's \npresence in the United States and the threat reporting during the summer of 2001.  \n\nOn September 11, after the attacks, the FBI office in London renewed their appeal for information about Moussaoui. \nIn response to U. S. requests, the British government supplied some basic biographical information about \nMoussaoui. The British government informed us that it also immediately tasked intelligence collection facilities for \ninformation about Moussaoui. On September 13, the British government received new, sensitive intelligence that \nMoussaoui had attended an al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan. It passed this intelligence to the United States \non the same day. Had this information been available in late August 2001, the Moussaoui case would almost \ncertainly have received intense, high-level attention.  \n\nThe FBI also learned after 9/11 that the millennium terrorist Ressam, who\n\nby 2001 was cooperating with investigators, recognized Moussaoui as someone who had been in the Afghan \ncamps.   As mentioned above, before 9/11 the FBI agents in Minneapolis had failed to persuade supervisors at \nheadquarters that there was enough evidence to seek a FISA warrant to search Moussaoui's computer hard drive \nand belongings. Either the British information or the Ressam identification would have broken the logjam.\n\nA maximum U. S. effort to investigate Moussaoui conceivably could have unearthed his connections to Binalshibh. \nThose connections might have brought investigators to the core of the 9/11 plot. The Binalshibh connection was \nrecognized shortly after 9/11, though it was not an easy trail to find. Discovering it would have required quick and \nvery substantial cooperation from the German government, which might well have been difficult to obtain.\n\nHowever, publicity about Moussaoui's arrest and a possible hijacking threat might have derailed the plot.   With \ntime, the search for Mihdhar and Hazmi and the investigation of Moussaoui might also have led to a breakthrough \nthat would have disrupted the plot.\n\nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed \n\nAnother late opportunity was presented by a confluence of information regarding Khalid Sheikh Mohammed \nreceived by the intelligence community in the summer of 2001. The possible links between KSM, Moussaoui, and \nan individual only later identified as Ramzi Binalshibh would remain undiscovered, however.\n\nAlthough we readily equate KSM with al Qaeda today, this was not the case before 9/11. KSM, who had been \nindicted in January 1996 for his role in the Manila air plot, was seen primarily as another freelance terrorist, \nassociated with Ramzi Yousef. Because the links between KSM and Bin Ladin or al Qaeda were not recognized at \nthe time, responsibility for KSM remained in the small Islamic Extremist Branch of the Counterterrorist Center, not in \nthe Bin Ladin unit.\n\nMoreover, because KSM had already been indicted, he became targeted for arrest. In 1997, the Counterterrorist \nCenter added a Renditions Branch to help find wanted fugitives. Responsibility for KSM was transferred to this \nbranch, which gave the CIA a \"man-to-man\" focus but was not an analytical unit. When subsequent information \ncame, more critical for analysis than for tracking, no unit had the job of following up on what the information might \nmean.  \n\nFor example, in September 2000, a source had reported that an individual named Khalid al-Shaykh al-Ballushi was \na key lieutenant in al Qaeda. Al- Ballushi means \"from Baluchistan, \" and KSM is from Baluchistan. Recognizing the \npossible significance of this information, the Bin Ladin unit sought more information. When no information was \nforthcoming, the Bin Ladin unit\n\n\n\ndropped the matter.   When additional pieces of the puzzle arrived in the spring and summer of 2001, they were not \nput together.\n\nThe first piece of the puzzle concerned some intriguing information associated with a person known as \"Mukhtar\" \nthat the CIA had begun analyzing in April 2001. The CIA did not know who Mukhtar was at the time - only that he \nassociated with al Qaeda lieutenant Abu Zubaydah and that, based on the nature of the information, he was \nevidently involved in planning possible terrorist activities.  \n\nThe second piece of the puzzle was some alarming information regarding KSM. On June 12, 2001, a CIA report \nsaid that \"Khaled\"was actively recruiting people to travel outside Afghanistan, including to the United States where \ncolleagues were reportedly already in the country to meet them, to carry out terrorist-related activities for Bin Ladin. \nCIA headquarters presumed from the details of the reporting that this person was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. In \nJuly, the same source was shown a series of photographs and identified a photograph of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed \nas the Khaled he had previously discussed.  \n\nThe final piece of the puzzle arrived at the CIA's Bin Ladin unit on August 28 in a cable reporting that KSM's \nnickname was Mukhtar. No one made the connection to the reports about Mukhtar that had been circulated in the \nspring. This connection might also have underscored concern about the June reporting that KSM was recruiting \nterrorists to travel, including to the United States. Only after 9/11 would it be discovered that Muhktar/KSM had \ncommunicated with a phone that was used by Binalshibh, and that Binalshibh had used the same phone to \ncommunicate with Moussaoui, as discussed in chapter 7. As in the Moussaoui situation already described, the links \nto Binalshibh might not have been an easy trail to find and would have required substantial cooperation from the \nGerman government. But time was short, and running out.  \n\nTime Runs Out \n\nAs Tenet told us, \"the system was blinking red\" during the summer of 2001. Officials were alerted across the world. \nMany were doing everything they possibly could to respond to the threats.\n\nYet no one working on these late leads in the summer of 2001 connected the case in his or her in-box to the threat \nreports agitating senior officials and being briefed to the President. Thus, these individual cases did not become \nnational priorities. As the CIA supervisor \"John\" told us, no one looked at the bigger picture; no analytic work \nforesaw the lightning that could connect the thundercloud to the ground.\n\nWe see little evidence that the progress of the plot was disturbed by any government action. The U. S. government \nwas unable to capitalize on mistakes made by al Qaeda. Time ran out.\n\n9 HEROISM AND HORROR \n\n9. 1 PREPAREDNESS AS OF SEPTEMBER 11 \n\nEmergency response is a product of preparedness. On the morning of September 11, 2001, the last best hope for \nthe community of people working in or visiting the World Trade Center rested not with national policymakers but \nwith private firms and local public servants, especially the first responders: fire, police, emergency medical service, \nand building safety professionals.\n\nBuilding Preparedness \n\nThe World Trade Center. The World Trade Center (WTC) complex was built for the Port Authority of New York and \nNew Jersey. Construction began in 1966, and tenants began to occupy its space in 1970. The Twin Towers came \nto occupy a unique and symbolic place in the culture of New York City and America.\n\n\n\nThe WTC actually consisted of seven buildings, including one hotel, spread across 16 acres of land. The buildings \nwere connected by an underground mall (the concourse). The Twin Towers (1 WTC, or the North Tower, and 2 \nWTC, or the South Tower) were the signature structures, containing 10. 4 million square feet of office space. Both \ntowers had 110 stories, were about 1, 350 feet high, and were square; each wall measured 208 feet in length. On \nany given workday, up to 50, 000 office workers occupied the towers, and 40, 000 people passed through the \ncomplex.  \n\nEach tower contained three central stairwells, which ran essentially from top to bottom, and 99 elevators. Generally, \nelevators originating in the lobby ran to \"sky lobbies\" on higher floors, where additional elevators carried \npassengers to the tops of the buildings.  \n\nStairwells A and C ran from the 110th floor to the raised mezzanine level of the lobby. Stairwell B ran from the \n107th floor to level B6, six floors below ground, and was accessible from the West Street lobby level, which was \none World Trade Center Complex\n\n  \u2022 \n\nThe World Trade Center Complex as of 9/11  Rendering by Marco Crupi\n\nfloor below the mezzanine. All three stairwells ran essentially straight up and down, except for two deviations in \nstairwells A and C where the staircase jutted out toward the perimeter of the building. On the upper and lower \nboundaries of these deviations were transfer hallways contained within the stairwell proper. Each hallway contained \nsmoke doors to prevent smoke from rising from lower to upper portions of the building; they were kept closed but \nnot locked. Doors leading from tenant space into the stairwells were never kept locked; reentry from the stairwells \nwas generally possible on at least every fourth floor.  \n\nDoors leading to the roof were locked. There was no rooftop evacuation plan. The roofs of both the North Tower \nand the South Tower were sloped and cluttered surfaces with radiation hazards, making them impractical for \nhelicopter landings and as staging areas for civilians. Although the South Tower roof had a helipad, it did not meet \n1994 Federal Aviation Administration guidelines.  \n\nThe 1993 Terrorist Bombing of the WTC and the Port Authority's Response. Unlike most of America, New \nYork City and specifically the World\n\nTrade Center had been the target of terrorist attacks before 9/11. At 12:18 P. M. on February 26, 1993, a 1, 500-\npound bomb stashed in a rental van was detonated on a parking garage ramp beneath the Twin Towers. The \nexplosion killed six people, injured about 1, 000 more, and exposed vulnerabilities in the World Trade Center's and \nthe city's emergency preparedness.  \n\nThe towers lost power and communications capability. Generators had to be shut down to ensure safety, and \nelevators stopped. The public-address system and emergency lighting systems failed. The unlit stairwells filled with \nsmoke and were so dark as to be impassable. Rescue efforts by the Fire Department of New York (FDNY) were \nhampered by the inability of its radios to function in buildings as large as the Twin Towers. The 911 emergency call \nsystem was overwhelmed. The general evacuation of the towers' occupants via the stairwells took more than four \nhours.  \n\nSeveral small groups of people who were physically unable to descend the stairs were evacuated from the roof of \nthe South Tower by New York Police Department (NYPD) helicopters. At least one person was lifted from the North \nTower roof by the NYPD in a dangerous helicopter rappel operation - 15 hours after the bombing. General \nknowledge that these air rescues had occurred appears to have left a number of civilians who worked in the Twin \nTowers with the false impression that helicopter rescues were part of the WTC evacuation plan and that rescue \nfrom the roof was a viable, if not favored, option for those who worked on upper floors. Although they were \nconsidered after 1993, helicopter evacuations in fact were not incorporated into the WTC fire safety plan.  \n\nTo address the problems encountered during the response to the 1993 bombing, the Port Authority spent an initial \n$100 million to make physical, structural, and technological improvements to the WTC, as well as to enhance its fire \n\n\n\nsafety plan and reorganize and bolster its fire safety and security staffs.   Substantial enhancements were made to \npower sources and exits. Fluorescent signs and markings were added in and near stairwells. The Port Authority \nalso installed a sophisticated computerized fire alarm system with redundant electronics and control panels, and \nstate-of-the-art fire command stations were placed in the lobby of each tower.  \n\nTo manage fire emergency preparedness and operations, the Port Authority created the dedicated position of fire \nsafety director. The director supervised a team of deputy fire safety directors, one of whom was on duty at the fire \ncommand station in the lobby of each tower at all times. He or she would be responsible for communicating with \nbuilding occupants during an emergency.  \n\nThe Port Authority also sought to prepare civilians better for future emergencies. Deputy fire safety directors \nconducted fire drills at least twice a year, with advance notice to tenants. \"Fire safety teams\"were selected from \namong civilian employees on each floor and consisted of a fire warden, deputy fire wardens, and searchers. The \nstandard procedure for fire drills was for fire wardens\n\nThe Port Authority also sought to prepare civilians better for future emergencies. Deputy fire safety directors \nconducted fire drills at least twice a year, with advance notice to tenants. \"Fire safety teams\"were selected from \namong civilian employees on each floor and consisted of a fire warden, deputy fire wardens, and searchers. The \nstandard procedure for fire drills was for fire wardens\n\nto lead co-workers in their respective areas to the center of the floor, where they would use the emergency intercom \nphone to obtain specific information on how to proceed. Some civilians have told us that their evacuation on \nSeptember 11 was greatly aided by changes and training implemented by the Port Authority in response to the \n1993 bombing.  \n\nBut during these drills, civilians were not directed into the stairwells, or provided with information about their \nconfiguration and about the existence of transfer hallways and smoke doors. Neither full nor partial evacuation drills \nwere held. Moreover, participation in drills that were held varied greatly from tenant to tenant. In general, civilians \nwere never told not to evacuate up. The standard fire drill announcement advised participants that in the event of an \nactual emergency, they would be directed to descend to at least three floors below the fire. Most civilians recall \nsimply being taught to await the instructions that would be provided at the time of an emergency. Civilians were not \ninformed that rooftop evacuations were not part of the evacuation plan, or that doors to the roof were kept locked. \nThe Port Authority acknowledges that it had no protocol for rescuing people trapped above a fire in the towers.  \n\nSix weeks before the September 11 attacks, control of the WTC was transferred by net lease to a private developer, \nSilverstein Properties. Select Port Authority employees were designated to assist with the transition. Others \nremained on-site but were no longer part of the official chain of command. However, on September 11, most Port \nAuthority World Trade Department employees - including those not on the designated \"transition team\" - reported to \ntheir regular stations to provide assistance throughout the morning. Although Silverstein Properties was in charge of \nthe WTC on September 11, the WTC fire safety plan remained essentially the same.  \n\nPreparedness of First Responders On 9/11, the principal first responders were from the Fire Department of New \nYork, the New York Police Department, the Port Authority Police Department (PAPD), and the Mayor's Office of \nEmergency Management (OEM).\n\nPort Authority Police Department. On September 11, 2001, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey \nPolice Department consisted of 1, 331 officers, many of whom were trained in fire suppression methods as well as \nin law enforcement. The PAPD was led by a superintendent. There was a separate PAPD command for each of the \nPort Authority's nine facilities, including the World Trade Center.  \n\nMost Port Authority police commands used ultra-high-frequency radios. Although all the radios were capable of \nusing more than one channel, most PAPD officers used one local channel. The local channels were low-wattage \nand worked only in the immediate vicinity of that command. The PAPD also had an agencywide channel, but not all \ncommands could access it.  \n\n\n\nAs of September 11, the Port Authority lacked any standard operating procedures to govern how officers from \nmultiple commands would respond to and then be staged and utilized at a major incident at the WTC. In particular, \nthere were no standard operating procedures covering how different commands should communicate via radio \nduring such an incident.\n\nThe New York Police Department. The 40, 000-officer NYPD was headed by a police commissioner, whose \nduties were not primarily operational but who retained operational authority. Much of the NYPD's operational \nactivities were run by the chief of department. In the event of a major emergency, a leading role would be played by \nthe Special Operations Division. This division included the Aviation Unit, which provided helicopters for surveys and \nrescues, and the Emergency Service Unit (ESU), which carried out specialized rescue missions. The NYPD had \nspecific and detailed standard operating procedures for the dispatch of officers to an incident, depending on the \nincident's magnitude.  \n\nThe NYPD precincts were divided into 35 different radio zones, with a central radio dispatcher assigned to each. In \naddition, there were several radio channels for citywide operations. Officers had portable radios with 20 or more \navailable channels, so that the user could respond outside his or her precinct. ESU teams also had these channels \nbut at an operation would use a separate point-to-point channel (which was not monitored by a dispatcher).  \n\nThe NYPD also supervised the city's 911 emergency call system. Its approximately 1, 200 operators, radio \ndispatchers, and supervisors were civilian employees of the NYPD. They were trained in the rudiments of \nemergency response. When a 911 call concerned a fire, it was transferred to FDNY dispatch.  \n\nThe Fire Department of New York. The 11, 000-member FDNY was headed by a fire commissioner who, unlike \nthe police commissioner, lacked operational authority. Operations were headed by the chief of department - the \nsole five-star chief.  \n\nThe FDNY was organized in nine separate geographic divisions. Each division was further divided into between \nfour to seven battalions. Each battalion contained typically between three and four engine companies and two to \nfour ladder companies. In total, the FDNY had 205 engine companies and 133 ladder companies. On-duty ladder \ncompanies consisted of a captain or lieutenant and five firefighters; on-duty engine companies consisted of a \ncaptain or lieutenant and normally four firefighters. Ladder companies' primary function was to conduct rescues; \nengine companies focused on extinguishing fires.  \n\nThe FDNY's Specialized Operations Command (SOC) contained a limited number of units that were of particular \nimportance in responding to a terrorist attack or other major incident. The department's five rescue companies and \nseven squad companies performed specialized and highly risky rescue operations.  \n\nThe logistics of fire operations were directed by Fire Dispatch Operations Division, which had a center in each of \nthe five boroughs. All 911 calls concerning fire emergencies were transferred to FDNY dispatch.  \n\nAs of September 11, FDNY companies and chiefs responding to a fire used analog, point-to-point radios that had \nsix normal operating channels. Typically, the companies would operate on the same tactical channel, which chiefs \non the scene would monitor and use to communicate with the firefighters. Chiefs at a fire operation also would use \na separate command channel. Because these point-to-point radios had weak signal strength, communications on \nthem could be heard only by other FDNY personnel in the immediate vicinity. In addition, the FDNY had a dispatch \nfrequency for each of the five boroughs; these were not point-to-point channels and could be monitored from \naround the city.  \n\nThe FDNY's radios performed poorly during the 1993 WTC bombing for two reasons. First, the radios signals often \ndid not succeed in penetrating the numerous steel and concrete floors that separated companies attempting to \ncommunicate; and second, so many different companies were attempting to use the same point-to-point channel \nthat communications became unintelligible.  \n\nThe Port Authority installed, at its own expense, a repeater system in 1994 to greatly enhance FDNY radio \ncommunications in the difficult high-rise environment of the Twin Towers. The Port Authority recommended leaving \n\n\n\nthe repeater system on at all times. The FDNY requested, however, that the repeater be turned on only when it was \nactually needed because the channel could cause interference with other FDNY operations in Lower Manhattan. \nThe repeater system was installed at the Port Authority police desk in 5 WTC, to be activated by members of the \nPort Authority police when the FDNY units responding to the WTC complex so requested. However, in the spring of \n2000 the FDNY asked that an activation console for the repeater system be placed instead in the lobby fire safety \ndesk of each of the towers, making FDNY personnel entirely responsible for its activation. The Port Authority \ncomplied.  \n\nBetween 1998 and 2000, fewer people died from fires in New York City than in any three-year period since accurate \nmeasurements began in 1946. Firefighter deaths - a total of 22 during the 1990s - compared favorably with the \nmost tranquil periods in the department's history.  \n\nOffice of Emergency Management and Interagency Preparedness. In 1996, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani created the \nMayor's Office of Emergency Management, which had three basic functions. First, OEM's Watch Command was to \nmonitor the city's key communications channels - including radio frequencies of FDNY dispatch and the NYPD - \nand other data. A second purpose of the OEM was to improve New York City's response to major incidents, \nincluding terrorist attacks, by planning and conducting exercises and drills that would involve multiple city agencies, \nparticularly the NYPD and FDNY. Third, the OEM would play a crucial role in managing the city's overall response \nto an The World Trade Center Radio Repeater System \n\n  \u2022 \n\nRendering by Marco Crupi\n\nincident. After OEM's Emergency Operations Center was activated, designated liaisons from relevant agencies, as \nwell as the mayor and his or her senior staff, would respond there. In addition, an OEM field responder would be \nsent to the scene to ensure that the response was coordinated.  \n\nThe OEM's headquarters was located at 7 WTC. Some questioned locating it both so close to a previous terrorist \ntarget and on the 23rd floor of a building (difficult to access should elevators become inoperable). There was no \nbackup site.  \n\nIn July 2001, Mayor Giuliani updated a directive titled \"Direction and Control of Emergencies in the City of New \nYork. \" Its purpose was to eliminate \"potential conflict among responding agencies which may have areas\n\nof overlapping expertise and responsibility. \"The directive sought to accomplish this objective by designating, for \ndifferent types of emergencies, an appropriate agency as \"Incident Commander. \" This Incident Commander would \nbe \"responsible for the management of the City's response to the emergency, \" while the OEM was \"designated the \n'On Scene Interagency Coordinator. '\"  \n\nNevertheless, the FDNY and NYPD each considered itself operationally autonomous. As of September 11, they \nwere not prepared to comprehensively coordinate their efforts in responding to a major incident. The OEM had not \novercome this problem.\n\n9. 2 SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 \n\nAs we turn to the events of September 11, we are mindful of the unfair perspective afforded by hindsight. \nNevertheless, we will try to describe what happened in the following 102 minutes:\n\n     *  the 17 minutes from the crash of the hijacked American Airlines\n\n        Flight 11 into 1 World Trade Center (the North Tower) at 8:46 until\n\n        the South Tower was hit\n\n     *  the 56 minutes from the crash of the hijacked United Airlines\n\n        Flight 175 into 2 World Trade Center (the South Tower) at 9:03\n\n\n\n        until the collapse of the South Tower\n\n     *  the 29 minutes from the collapse of the South Tower at 9:59 until\n\n        the collapse of the North Tower at 10:28\n\nFrom 8:46 until 9:03 A. M. \n\nAt 8:46:40, the hijacked American Airlines Flight 11 flew into the upper portion of the North Tower, cutting through \nfloors 93 to 99. Evidence suggests that all three of the building's stairwells became impassable from the 92nd floor \nup. Hundreds of civilians were killed instantly by the impact. Hundreds more remained alive but trapped.  \n\nCivilians, Fire Safety Personnel, and 911 Calls \n\nNorth Tower. A jet fuel fireball erupted upon impact and shot down at least one bank of elevators. The fireball \nexploded onto numerous lower floors, including the 77th and 22nd; the West Street lobby level; and the B4 level, \nfour stories below ground. The burning jet fuel immediately created thick, black smoke that enveloped the upper \nfloors and roof of the North Tower. The roof of the South Tower was also engulfed in smoke because of prevailing \nlight winds from the northwest.  \n\nWithin minutes, New York City's 911 system was flooded with eyewit-\n\nness accounts of the event. Most callers correctly identified the target of the attack. Some identified the plane as a \ncommercial airliner.  \n\nThe first response came from private firms and individuals - the people and companies in the building. Everything \nthat would happen to them during the next few minutes would turn on their circumstances and their preparedness, \nassisted by building personnel on-site.\n\nHundreds of civilians trapped on or above the 92nd floor gathered in large and small groups, primarily between the \n103rd and 106th floors. A large group was reported on the 92nd floor, technically below the impact but unable to \ndescend. Civilians were also trapped in elevators. Other civilians below the impact zone - mostly on floors in the \n70s and 80s, but also on at least the 47th and 22nd floors - were either trapped or waiting for assistance.  \n\nIt is unclear when the first full building evacuation order was attempted over the public-address system. The deputy \nfire safety director in the lobby, while immediately aware that a major incident had occurred, did not know for \napproximately ten minutes that a commercial jet had directly hit the building. Following protocol, he initially gave \nannouncements to those floors that had generated computerized alarms, advising those tenants to descend to \npoints of safety - at least two floors below the smoke or fire - and to wait there for further instructions. The deputy \nfire safety director has told us that he began instructing a full evacuation within about ten minutes of the explosion. \nBut the first FDNY chiefs to arrive in the lobby were advised by the Port Authority fire safety director - who had \nreported to the lobby although he was no longer the designated fire safety director - that the full building evacuation \nannouncement had been made within one minute of the building being hit.  \n\nBecause of damage to building systems caused by the impact of the plane, public-address announcements were \nnot heard in many locations. For the same reason, many civilians may have been unable to use the emergency \nintercom phones, as they had been advised to do in fire drills. Many called 911.  \n\nThe 911 system was not equipped to handle the enormous volume of calls it received. Some callers were unable to \nconnect with 911 operators, receiving an \"all circuits busy\" message. Standard operating procedure was for calls \nrelating to fire emergencies to be transferred from 911 operators to FDNY dispatch operators in the appropriate \nborough (in this case, Manhattan). Transfers were often plagued by delays and were in some cases unsuccessful. \nMany calls were also prematurely disconnected.  \n\nThe 911 operators and FDNY dispatchers had no information about either the location or the magnitude of the \nimpact zone and were therefore unable to provide information as fundamental as whether callers were above or \n\n\n\nbelow the fire. Because the operators were not informed of NYPD Aviation's determination of the impossibility of \nrooftop rescues from the Twin Towers on that day, they could not knowledgeably answer when callers asked \nwhether to go up or down. In most instances, therefore, the operators and the FDNY dispatchers relied on standard \noperating procedures for high-rise fires - that civil-\n\nians should stay low, remain where they are, and wait for emergency personnel to reach them. This advice was \ngiven to callers from the North Tower for locations both above and below the impact zone. Fire chiefs told us that \nthe evacuation of tens of thousands of people from skyscrapers can create many new problems, especially for \nindividuals who are disabled or in poor health. Many of the injuries after the 1993 bombing occurred during the \nevacuation.  \n\nAlthough the guidance to stay in place may seem understandable in cases of conventional high-rise fires, FDNY \nchiefs in the North Tower lobby determined at once that all building occupants should attempt to evacuate \nimmediately. By 8:57, FDNY chiefs had instructed the PAPD and building personnel to evacuate the South Tower \nas well, because of the magnitude of the damage caused by the first plane's impact.  \n\nThese critical decisions were not conveyed to 911 operators or to FDNY dispatchers. Departing from protocol, a \nnumber of operators told callers that they could break windows, and several operators advised callers to evacuate if \nthey could.   Civilians who called the Port Authority police desk located at 5 WTC were advised to leave if they \ncould.  \n\nMost civilians who were not obstructed from proceeding began evacuating without waiting for instructions over the \nintercom system. Some remained to wait for help, as advised by 911 operators. Others simply continued to work or \ndelayed to collect personal items, but in many cases were urged to leave by others. Some Port Authority civilian \nemployees remained on various upper floors to help civilians who were trapped and to assist in the evacuation.  \n\nWhile evacuating, some civilians had trouble reaching the exits because of damage caused by the impact. Some \nwere confused by deviations in the increasingly crowded stairwells, and impeded by doors that appeared to be \nlocked but actually were jammed by debris or shifting that resulted from the impact of the plane. Despite these \nobstacles, the evacuation was relatively calm and orderly.  \n\nWithin ten minutes of impact, smoke was beginning to rise to the upper floors in debilitating volumes and isolated \nfires were reported, although there were some pockets of refuge. Faced with insufferable heat, smoke, and fire, and \nwith no prospect for relief, some jumped or fell from the building.  \n\nSouth Tower. Many civilians in the South Tower were initially unaware of what had happened in the other tower. \nSome believed an incident had occurred in their building; others were aware that a major explosion had occurred on \nthe upper floors of the North Tower. Many people decided to leave, and some were advised to do so by fire \nwardens. In addition, Morgan Stanley, which occupied more than 20 floors of the South Tower, evacuated its \nemployees by the decision of company security officials.  \n\nConsistent with protocol, at 8:49 the deputy fire safety director in the South Tower told his counterpart in the North \nTower that he would wait to hear from \"the boss from the Fire Department or somebody\" before ordering an \nevacuation.   At about this time, an announcement over the public-address system in The World Trade Center North \nTower Stairwell with Deviation \n\n  \u2022 \n\nRendering by Marco Crupi\n\nthe South Tower stated that the incident had occurred in the other building and advised tenants, generally, that their \nbuilding was safe and that they should remain on or return to their offices or floors. A statement from the deputy fire \nsafety director informing tenants that the incident had occurred in the other building was consistent with protocol; \nthe expanded advice did not correspond to any existing written protocol, and did not reflect any instruction known to \nhave been given to the deputy fire safety director that day. We do not know the reason for the announcement, as \nboth the deputy fire safety director believed to have made it and the director of fire safety for the WTC complex \n\n\n\nperished in the South Tower's collapse. Clearly, however, the prospect of another plane hitting the second building \nwas beyond the contemplation of anyone giving advice. According\n\nto one of the first fire chiefs to arrive, such a scenario was unimaginable, \"beyond our consciousness. \"As a result \nof the announcement, many civilians remained on their floors. Others reversed their evacuation and went back up.  \n\nSimilar advice was given in person by security officials in both the groundfloor lobby - where a group of 20 that had \ndescended by the elevators was personally instructed to go back upstairs - and in the upper sky lobby, where many \nwaited for express elevators to take them down. Security officials who gave this advice were not part of the fire \nsafety staff.  \n\nSeveral South Tower occupants called the Port Authority police desk in 5 WTC. Some were advised to stand by for \nfurther instructions; others were strongly advised to leave.  \n\nIt is not known whether the order by the FDNY to evacuate the South Tower was received by the deputy fire safety \ndirector making announcements there. However, at approximately 9:02 - less than a minute before the building \nwas hit - an instruction over the South Tower's public-address system advised civilians, generally, that they could \nbegin an orderly evacuation if conditions warranted. Like the earlier advice to remain in place, it did not correspond \nto any prewritten emergency instruction.  \n\nFDNY Initial Response \n\nMobilization. The FDNY response began within five seconds of the crash. By 9:00, many senior FDNY leaders, \nincluding 7 of the 11 most highly ranked chiefs in the department, as well as the Commissioner and many of his \ndeputies and assistants, had begun responding from headquarters in Brooklyn. While en route over the Brooklyn \nBridge, the Chief of Department and the Chief of Operations had a clear view of the situation on the upper floors of \nthe North Tower. They determined that because of the fire's magnitude and location near the top of the building, \ntheir mission would be primarily one of rescue. They called for a fifth alarm, which would bring additional engine and \nladder companies, as well as for two more elite rescue units. The Chief of Department arrived at about 9:00; \ngeneral FDNY Incident Command was transferred to his location on the West Side Highway. In all, 22 of the 32 \nsenior chiefs and commissioners arrived at the WTC before 10:00.  \n\nAs of 9:00, the units that were dispatched (including senior chiefs responding to headquarters) included \napproximately 235 firefighters. These units consisted of 21 engine companies, nine ladder companies, four of the \ndepartment's elite rescue teams, the department's single Hazmat team, two of the city's elite squad companies, and \nsupport staff. In addition, at 8:53 nine Brooklyn units were staged on the Brooklyn side of the Brooklyn-Battery \nTunnel to await possible dispatch orders.  \n\nOperations. A battalion chief and two ladder and two engine companies arrived at the North Tower at \napproximately 8:52. As they entered the lobby, they encountered badly burned civilians who had been caught in the \npath of\n\nthe fireball. Floor-to-ceiling windows in the northwest corner of the West Street level of the lobby had been blown \nout; some large marble tiles had been dislodged from the walls; one entire elevator bank was destroyed by the \nfireball. Lights were functioning, however, and the air was clear of smoke.  \n\nAs the highest-ranking officer on the scene, the battalion chief initially was the FDNY incident commander. Minutes \nlater, the on-duty division chief for Lower Manhattan arrived and took over. Both chiefs immediately began speaking \nwith the former fire safety director and other building personnel to learn whether building systems were working. \nThey were advised that all 99 elevators in the North Tower appeared to be out, and there were no assurances that \nsprinklers or standpipes were working on upper floors. Chiefs also spoke with Port Authority police personnel and \nan OEM representative.  \n\n\n\nAfter conferring with the chiefs in the lobby, one engine and one ladder company began climbing stairwell C at \nabout 8:57, with the goal of approaching the impact zone as scouting units and reporting back to the chiefs in the \nlobby. The radio channel they used was tactical 1. Following FDNY high-rise fire protocols, other units did not begin \nclimbing immediately, as the chiefs worked to formulate a plan before sending them up. Units began mobilizing in \nthe lobby, lining up and awaiting their marching orders.  \n\nAlso by approximately 8:57, FDNY chiefs had asked both building personnel and a Port Authority police officer to \nevacuate the South Tower, because in their judgment the impact of the plane into the North Tower made the entire \ncomplex unsafe - not because of concerns about a possible second plane.  \n\nThe FDNY chiefs in the increasingly crowded North Tower lobby were confronting critical choices with little to no \ninformation. They had ordered units up the stairs to report back on conditions, but did not know what the impact \nfloors were; they did not know if any stairwells into the impact zone were clear; and they did not know whether \nwater for firefighting would be available on the upper floors. They also did not know what the fire and impact zone \nlooked like from the outside.  \n\nThey did know that the explosion had been large enough to send down a fireball that blew out elevators and \nwindows in the lobby and that conditions were so dire that some civilians on upper floors were jumping or falling \nfrom the building. They also knew from building personnel that some civilians were trapped in elevators and on \nspecific floors. According to Division Chief for Lower Manhattan Peter Hayden, \"We had a very strong sense we \nwould lose firefighters and that we were in deep trouble, but we had estimates of 25, 000 to 50, 000 civilians, and \nwe had to try to rescue them. \"  \n\nThe chiefs concluded that this would be a rescue operation, not a firefighting operation. One of the chiefs present \nexplained:\n\n        We realized that, because of the impact of the plane, that there\n\n        was some structural damage to the building, and most likely that\n\n        the fire suppres-\n\n        sion systems within the building were probably damaged and possibly\n\n        inoperable. . . . We knew that at the height of the day there were\n\n        as many as 50, 000 people in this building. We had a large volume\n\n        of fire on the upper floors. Each floor was approximately an acre\n\n        in size. Several floors of fire would have been beyond the\n\n        fire-extinguishing capability of the forces that we had on hand. So\n\n        we determined, very early on, that this was going to be strictly a\n\n        rescue mission. We were going to vacate the building, get everybody\n\n        out, and then we were going to get out.\n\n        \n\n        \n\nThe specifics of the mission were harder to determine, as they had almost no information about the situation 80 or \nmore stories above them. They also received advice from senior FDNY chiefs that while the building might \neventually suffer a partial collapse on upper floors, such structural failure was not imminent. No one anticipated the \npossibility of a total collapse.  \n\nEmergency medical services (EMS) personnel were directed to one of four triage areas being set up around the \nperimeter of the WTC. Some entered the lobby to respond to specific casualty reports. In addition, many ambulance \nparamedics from private hospitals were rushing to the WTC complex.  \n\n\n\nNYPD Initial Response \n\nNumerous NYPD officers saw the plane strike the North Tower and immediately reported it to NYPD \ncommunications dispatchers.  \n\nAt 8:58, while en route, the NYPD Chief of Department raised the NYPD's mobilization to level 4, thereby sending \nto the WTC approximately 22 lieutenants, 100 sergeants, and 800 police officers from all over the city. The Chief of \nDepartment arrived at Church and Vesey at 9:00.  \n\nAt 9:01, the NYPD patrol mobilization point was moved to West and Vesey in order to handle the greater number of \npatrol officers dispatched in the higher-level mobilization. These officers would be stationed around the perimeter of \nthe complex to direct the evacuation of civilians. Many were diverted on the way to the scene by intervening \nemergencies related to the attack.  \n\nAt 8:50, the Aviation Unit of the NYPD dispatched two helicopters to the WTC to report on conditions and assess \nthe feasibility of a rooftop landing or of special rescue operations. En route, the two helicopters communicated with \nair traffic controllers at the area's three major airports and informed them of the commercial airplane crash at the \nWorld Trade Center. The air traffic controllers had been unaware of the incident.  \n\nAt 8:56, an NYPD ESU team asked to be picked up at the Wall Street heliport to initiate rooftop rescues. At 8:58, \nhowever, after assessing the North Tower roof, a helicopter pilot advised the ESU team that they could not land on \nthe roof, because \"it is too engulfed in flames and heavy smoke condition. \"  \n\nBy 9:00, a third NYPD helicopter was responding to the WTC complex.\n\nNYPD helicopters and ESU officers remained on the scene throughout the morning, prepared to commence rescue \noperations on the roof if conditions improved. Both FDNY and NYPD protocols called for FDNY personnel to be \nplaced in NYPD helicopters in the event of an attempted rooftop rescue at a high-rise fire. No FDNY personnel were \nplaced in NYPD helicopters on September 11.  \n\nThe 911 operators and FDNY dispatchers were not advised that rooftop rescues were not being undertaken. They \nthus were not able to communicate this fact to callers, some of whom spoke of attempting to climb to the roof.  \n\nTwo on-duty NYPD officers were on the 20th floor of the North Tower at 8:46. They climbed to the 29th floor, urging \ncivilians to evacuate, but did not locate a group of civilians trapped on the 22nd floor.  \n\nJust before 9:00, an ESU team began to walk from Church and Vesey to the North Tower lobby, with the goal of \nclimbing toward and setting up a triage center on the upper floors for the severely injured. A second ESU team \nwould follow them to assist in removing those individuals.  \n\nNumerous officers responded in order to help injured civilians and to urge those who could walk to vacate the area \nimmediately. Putting themselves in danger of falling debris, several officers entered the plaza and successfully \nrescued at least one injured, nonambulatory civilian, and attempted to rescue others.  \n\nAlso by about 9:00, transit officers began shutting down subway stations in the vicinity of the World Trade Center \nand evacuating civilians from those stations.  \n\nAround the city, the NYPD cleared major thoroughfares for emergency vehicles to access the WTC. The NYPD and \nPAPD coordinated the closing of bridges and tunnels into Manhattan.  \n\nPAPD Initial Response \n\nThe Port Authority's on-site commanding police officer was standing in the concourse when a fireball erupted out of \nelevator shafts and exploded onto the mall concourse, causing him to dive for cover. The on-duty sergeant initially \ninstructed the officers in the WTC Command to meet at the police desk in 5 WTC. Soon thereafter, he instructed \nofficers arriving from outside commands to meet him at the fire safety desk in the North Tower lobby. A few of these \nofficers from outside commands were given WTC Command radios.  \n\n\n\nOne Port Authority police officer at the WTC immediately began climbing stairwell C in the North Tower.   Other \nofficers began performing rescue and evacuation operations on the ground floors and in the PATH (Port Authority \nTrans-Hudson) station below the WTC complex.\n\nWithin minutes of impact, Port Authority police officers from the PATH, bridges, tunnels, and airport commands \nbegan responding to the WTC. The PAPD lacked written standard operating procedures for personnel responding \nfrom outside commands to the WTC during a major incident. In addition, offi-\n\ncers from some PAPD commands lacked interoperable radio frequencies. As a result, there was no comprehensive \ncoordination of PAPD's overall response.  \n\nAt 9:00, the PAPD commanding officer of the WTC ordered an evacuation of all civilians in the World Trade Center \ncomplex, because of the magnitude of the calamity in the North Tower. This order was given over WTC police radio \nchannel W, which could not be heard by the deputy fire safety director in the South Tower.  \n\nAlso at 9:00, the PAPD Superintendent and Chief of Department arrived separately and made their way to the North \nTower.  \n\nOEM Initial Response \n\nBy 8:48, officials in OEM headquarters on the 23rd floor of 7 WTC - just to the north of the North Tower - began to \nactivate the Emergency Operations Center by calling such agencies as the FDNY, NYPD, Department of Health, \nand the Greater Hospital Association and instructing them to send their designated representatives to the OEM. In \naddition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was called and asked to send at least five federal \nUrban Search and Rescue Teams (such teams are located throughout the United States). At approximately 8:50, a \nsenior representative from the OEM arrived in the lobby of the North Tower and began to act as the OEM field \nresponder to the incident. He soon was joined by several other OEM officials, including the OEM Director.  \n\nSummary \n\nIn the 17-minute period between 8:46 and 9:03 A. M. on September 11, New York City and the Port Authority of \nNew York and New Jersey had mobilized the largest rescue operation in the city's history. Well over a thousand first \nresponders had been deployed, an evacuation had begun, and the critical decision that the fire could not be fought \nhad been made.\n\nThen the second plane hit.\n\nFrom 9:03 until 9:59 A. M. \n\nAt 9:03:11, the hijacked United Airlines Flight 175 hit 2 WTC (the South Tower) from the south, crashing through the \n77th to 85th floors. What had been the largest and most complicated rescue operation in city history instantly \ndoubled in magnitude. The plane banked as it hit the building, leaving portions of the building undamaged on \nimpact floors. As a consequence - and in contrast to the situation in the North Tower - one of the stairwells (A) \ninitially remained passable from at least the 91st floor down, and likely from top to bottom.  \n\nCivilians, Fire Safety Personnel, and 911 Calls \n\nSouth Tower. At the lower end of the impact, the 78th-floor sky lobby, hundreds had been waiting to evacuate \nwhen the plane hit. Many had attempted but failed to squeeze into packed express elevators. Upon impact, many \nwere\n\nkilled or severely injured; others were relatively unharmed. We know of at least one civilian who seized the initiative \nand shouted that anyone who could walk should walk to the stairs, and anyone who could help should help others \n\n\n\nin need of assistance. As a result, at least two small groups of civilians descended from that floor. Others remained \non the floor to help the injured and move victims who were unable to walk to the stairwell to aid their rescue.  \n\nStill others remained alive in the impact zone above the 78th floor. Damage was extensive, and conditions were \nhighly precarious. The only survivor known to have escaped from the heart of the impact zone described the 81st \nfloor - where the wing of the plane had sliced through his office - as a \"demolition\" site in which everything was \n\"broken up\" and the smell of jet fuel was so strong that it was almost impossible to breathe. This person escaped by \nmeans of an unlikely rescue, aided by a civilian fire warden descending from a higher floor, who, critically, had been \nprovided with a flashlight.  \n\nAt least four people were able to descend stairwell A from the 81st floor or above. One left the 84th floor \nimmediately after the building was hit. Even at that point, the stairway was dark, smoky, and difficult to navigate; \nglow strips on the stairs and handrails were a significant help. Several flights down, however, the evacuee became \nconfused when he reached a smoke door that caused him to believe the stairway had ended. He was able to exit \nthat stairwell and switch to another.  \n\nMany civilians in and above the impact zone ascended the stairs. One small group reversed its descent down \nstairwell A after being advised by another civilian that they were approaching a floor \"in flames. \"The only known \nsurvivor has told us that their intention was to exit the stairwell in search of clearer air. At the 91st floor, joined by \nothers from intervening floors, they perceived themselves to be trapped in the stairwell and began descending \nagain. By this time, the stairwell was \"pretty black, \" intensifying smoke caused many to pass out, and fire had \nignited in the 82nd-floor transfer hallway.  \n\nOthers ascended to attempt to reach the roof but were thwarted by locked doors. At approximately 9:30 a \"lock \nrelease\" order - which would unlock all areas in the complex controlled by the buildings' computerized security \nsystem, including doors leading to the roofs - was transmitted to the Security Command Center located on the 22nd \nfloor of the North Tower. Damage to the software controlling the system, resulting from the impact of the plane, \nprevented this order from being executed.  \n\nOthers, attempting to descend, were frustrated by jammed or locked doors in stairwells or confused by the structure \nof the stairwell deviations. By the lower 70s, however, stairwells A and B were well-lit, and conditions were \ngenerally normal.  \n\nSome civilians remained on affected floors, and at least one ascended from a lower point into the impact zone, to \nhelp evacuate colleagues or assist the injured.  \n\nWithin 15 minutes after the impact, debilitating smoke had reached at least\n\none location on the 100th floor, and severe smoke conditions were reported throughout floors in the 90s and 100s \nover the course of the following half hour. By 9:30, a number of civilians who had failed to reach the roof remained \non the 105th floor, likely unable to descend because of intensifying smoke in the stairwell. There were reports of \ntremendous smoke on that floor, but at least one area remained less affected until shortly before the building \ncollapsed. There were several areas between the impact zone and the uppermost floors where conditions were \nbetter. At least a hundred people remained alive on the 88th and 89th floors, in some cases calling 911 for \ndirection.  \n\nThe 911 system remained plagued by the operators' lack of awareness of what was occurring. Just as in the North \nTower, callers from below and above the impact zone were advised to remain where they were and wait for help. \nThe operators were not given any information about the inability to conduct rooftop rescues and therefore could not \nadvise callers that they had essentially been ruled out. This lack of information, combined with the general advice to \nremain where they were, may have caused civilians above the impact not to attempt to descend, although stairwell \nA may have been passable.  \n\nIn addition, the 911 system struggled with the volume of calls and rigid standard operating procedures according to \nwhich calls conveying crucial information had to wait to be transferred to either EMS or FDNY dispatch.   According \nto one civilian who was evacuating down stairwell A from the heart of the impact zone and who stopped on the 31st \nfloor in order to call 911,\n\n        I told them when they answered the phone, where I was, that I had\n\n\n\n        passed somebody on the 44th floor, injured - they need to get a\n\n        medic and a stretcher to this floor, and described the situation in\n\n        brief, and the person then asked for my phone number, or something,\n\n        and they said - they put me on hold. \"You gotta talk to one of my\n\n        supervisors\" - and suddenly I was on hold. And so I waited a\n\n        considerable amount of time. Somebody else came back on the phone,\n\n        I repeated the story. And then it happened again. I was on hold a\n\n        second time, and needed to repeat the story for a third time. But I\n\n        told the third person that I am only telling you once. I am getting\n\n        out of the building, here are the details, write it down, and do\n\n        what you should do. \n\n        \n\nVery few 911 calls were received from floors below the impact, but at least one person was advised to remain on \nthe 73rd floor despite the caller's protests that oxygen was running out. The last known 911 call from this location \ncame at 9:52.  \n\nEvidence suggests that the public-address system did not continue to function after the building was hit. A group of \npeople trapped on the 97th floor, however, made repeated references in calls to 911 to having heard \n\"announcements\" to go down the stairs. Evacuation tones were heard in locations both above and below the \nimpact zone.  \n\nBy 9:35, the West Street lobby level of the South Tower was becoming overwhelmed by injured people who had \ndescended to the lobby but were having difficulty going on. Those who could continue were directed to exit north or \neast through the concourse and then out of the WTC complex.  \n\nBy 9:59, at least one person had descended from as high as the 91st floor of that tower, and stairwell A was \nreported to have been almost empty. Stairwell B was also reported to have contained only a handful of descending \ncivilians at an earlier point in the morning. But just before the tower collapsed, a team of NYPD ESU officers \nencountered a stream of civilians descending an unidentified stairwell in the 20s. These civilians may have been \ndescending from at or above the impact zone.  \n\nNorth Tower. In the North Tower, civilians continued their evacuation. On the 91st floor, the highest floor with \nstairway access, all civilians but one were uninjured and able to descend. While some complained of smoke, heat, \nfumes, and crowding in the stairwells, conditions were otherwise fairly normal on floors below the impact. At least \none stairwell was reported to have been \"clear and bright\" from the upper 80s down.  \n\nThose who called 911 from floors below the impact were generally advised to remain in place. One group trapped \non the 83rd floor pleaded repeatedly to know whether the fire was above or below them, specifically asking if 911 \noperators had any information from the outside or from the news. The callers were transferred back and forth \nseveral times and advised to stay put. Evidence suggests that these callers died.  \n\nAt 8:59, the Port Authority police desk at Newark Airport told a third party that a group of Port Authority civilian \nemployees on the 64th floor should evacuate. (The third party was not at the WTC, but had been in phone contact \nwith the group on the 64th floor. ) At 9:10, in response to an inquiry from the employees themselves, the Port \nAuthority police desk in Jersey City confirmed that employees on the 64th floor should \"be careful, stay near the \nstairwells, and wait for the police to come up. \" When the third party inquired again at 9:31, the police desk at \nNewark Airport advised that they \"absolutely\" evacuate. The third party informed the police desk that the employees \nhad previously received contrary advice from the FDNY, which could only have come via 911. These workers were \n\n\n\nnot trapped, yet unlike most occupants on the upper floors, they had chosen not to descend immediately after \nimpact. They eventually began to descend the stairs, but most of them died in the collapse of the North Tower.  \n\nAll civilians who reached the lobby were directed by NYPD and PAPD officers into the concourse, where other \npolice officers guided them to exit the concourse and complex to the north and east so that they might avoid falling \ndebris and victims.  \n\nBy 9:55, only a few civilians were descending above the 25th floor in stair-\n\nwell B; these primarily were injured, handicapped, elderly, or severely overweight civilians, in some cases being \nassisted by other civilians.  \n\nBy 9:59, tenants from the 91st floor had already descended the stairs and exited the concourse. However, a \nnumber of civilians remained in at least stairwell C, approaching lower floors. Other evacuees were killed earlier by \ndebris falling on the street.  \n\nFDNY Response \n\nIncreased Mobilization. Immediately after the second plane hit, the FDNY Chief of Department called a second \nfifth alarm.  \n\nBy 9:15, the number of FDNY personnel en route to or present at the scene was far greater than the commanding \nchiefs at the scene had requested. Five factors account for this disparity. First, while the second fifth alarm had \ncalled for 20 engine and 8 ladder companies, in fact 23 engine and 13 ladder companies were dispatched. Second, \nseveral other units self-dispatched. Third, because the attacks came so close to the 9:00 shift change, many \nfirefighters just going off duty were given permission by company officers to \"ride heavy\" and became part of those \non-duty teams, under the leadership of that unit's officer. Fourth, many off-duty firefighters responded from \nfirehouses separately from the on-duty unit (in some cases when expressly told not to) or from home. The arrival of \npersonnel in excess of that dispatched was particularly pronounced in the department's elite units. Fifth, numerous \nadditional FDNY personnel - such as fire marshals and firefighters in administrative positions - who lacked a \npredetermined operating role also reported to the WTC.  \n\nThe Repeater System. Almost immediately after the South Tower was hit, senior FDNY chiefs in the North Tower \nlobby huddled to discuss strategy for the operations in the two towers. Of particular concern to the chiefs - in light of \nFDNY difficulties in responding to the 1993 bombing - was communications capability. One of the chiefs \nrecommended testing the repeater channel to see if it would work.  \n\nEarlier, an FDNY chief had asked building personnel to activate the repeater channel, which would enable greatly-\nenhanced FDNY portable radio communications in the high-rises. One button on the repeater system activation \nconsole in the North Tower was pressed at 8:54, though it is unclear by whom. As a result of this activation, \ncommunication became possible between FDNY portable radios on the repeater channel. In addition, the repeater's \nmaster handset at the fire safety desk could hear communications made by FDNY portable radios on the repeater \nchannel. The activation of transmission on the master handset required, however, that a second button be pressed. \nThat second button was never activated on the morning of September 11.  \n\nAt 9:05, FDNY chiefs tested the WTC complex's repeater system. Because the second button had not been \nactivated, the chief on the master handset could\n\nnot transmit. He was also apparently unable to hear another chief who was attempting to communicate with him \nfrom a portable radio, either because of a technical problem or because the volume was turned down on the \nconsole (the normal setting when the system was not in use). Because the repeater channel seemed inoperable - \nthe master handset appeared unable to transmit or receive communications - the chiefs in the North Tower lobby \ndecided not to use it. The repeater system was working at least partially, however, on portable FDNY radios, and \nfirefighters subsequently used repeater channel 7 in the South Tower.  \n\n\n\nFDNY North Tower Operations. Command and control decisions were affected by the lack of knowledge of what \nwas happening 30, 60, 90, and 100 floors above. According to one of the chiefs in the lobby, \"One of the most \ncritical things in a major operation like this is to have information. We didn't have a lot of information coming in. We \ndidn't receive any reports of what was seen from the [NYPD] helicopters. It was impossible to know how much \ndamage was done on the upper floors, whether the stairwells were intact or not. \"   According to another chief \npresent, \"People watching on TV certainly had more knowledge of what was happening a hundred floors above us \nthan we did in the lobby. . . . [W]ithout critical information coming in . . . it's very difficult to make informed, critical \ndecisions[. ]\"  \n\nAs a result, chiefs in the lobby disagreed over whether anyone at or above the impact zone possibly could be \nrescued, or whether there should be even limited firefighting for the purpose of cutting exit routes through fire \nzones.  \n\nMany units were simply instructed to ascend toward the impact zone and report back to the lobby via radio. Some \nunits were directed to assist specific groups of individuals trapped in elevators or in offices well below the impact \nzone. One FDNY company successfully rescued some civilians who were trapped on the 22nd floor as a result of \ndamage caused by the initial fireball.  \n\nAn attempt was made to track responding units' assignments on a magnetic board, but the number of units and \nindividual firefighters arriving in the lobby made this an overwhelming task. As the fire companies were not advised \nto the contrary, they followed protocol and kept their radios on tactical channel 1, which would be monitored by the \nchiefs in the lobby. Those battalion chiefs who would climb would operate on a separate command channel, which \nalso would be monitored by the chiefs in the lobby.  \n\nFire companies began to ascend stairwell B at approximately 9:07, laden with about 100 pounds of heavy protective \nclothing, self-contained breathing apparatuses, and other equipment (including hoses for engine companies and \nheavy tools for ladder companies).  \n\nFirefighters found the stairways they entered intact, lit, and clear of smoke. Unbeknownst to the lobby command \npost, one battalion chief in the North Tower found a working elevator, which he took to the 16th floor before \nbeginning to climb.  \n\nIn ascending stairwell B, firefighters were passing a steady and heavy stream of descending civilians. Firemen were \nimpressed with the composure and total lack of panic shown by almost all civilians. Many civilians were in awe of \nthe firefighters and found their mere presence to be calming.  \n\nFirefighters periodically stopped on particular floors and searched to ensure that no civilians were still on it. In a few \ninstances healthy civilians were found on floors, either because they still were collecting personal items or for no \napparent reason; they were told to evacuate immediately. Firefighters deputized healthy civilians to be in charge of \nothers who were struggling or injured.  \n\nClimbing up the stairs with heavy protective clothing and equipment was hard work even for physically fit \nfirefighters. As firefighters began to suffer varying levels of fatigue, some became separated from others in their \nunit.  \n\nAt 9:32, a senior chief radioed all units in the North Tower to return to the lobby, either because of a false report of a \nthird plane approaching or because of his judgment about the deteriorating condition of the building. Once the \nrumor of the third plane was debunked, other chiefs continued operations, and there is no evidence that any units \nactually returned to the lobby. At the same time, a chief in the lobby was asked to consider the possibility of a \nrooftop rescue but was unable to reach FDNY dispatch by radio or phone. Out on West Street, however, the FDNY \nChief of Department had already dismissed any rooftop rescue as impossible.  \n\nAs units climbed higher, their ability to communicate with chiefs on tactical 1 became more limited and sporadic, \nboth because of the limited effectiveness of FDNY radios in high-rises and because so many units on tactical 1 \nwere trying to communicate at once. When attempting to reach a particular unit, chiefs in the lobby often heard \nnothing in response.  \n\n\n\nJust prior to 10:00, in the North Tower one engine company had climbed to the 54th floor, at least two other \ncompanies of firefighters had reached the sky lobby on the 44th floor, and numerous units were located between \nthe 5th and 37th floors.  \n\nFDNY South Tower and Marriott Hotel Operations. Immediately after the repeater test, a senior chief and a \nbattalion chief commenced operations in the South Tower lobby. Almost at once they were joined by an OEM field \nresponder. They were not, however, joined right away by a sizable number of fire companies, as units that had \nbeen in or en route to the North Tower lobby at 9:03 were not reallocated to the South Tower.  \n\nA battalion chief and a ladder company found a working elevator to the 40th floor and from there proceeded to climb \nstairwell B. Another ladder company arrived soon thereafter, and began to rescue civilians trapped in an elevator \nbetween the first and second floors. The senior chief in the lobby expressed frustration about the lack of units he \ninitially had at his disposal for South Tower operations.  \n\nUnlike the commanders in the North Tower, the senior chief in the lobby\n\nand the ascending battalion chief kept their radios on repeater channel 7. For the first 15 minutes of the operations, \ncommunications among them and the ladder company climbing with the battalion chief worked well. Upon learning \nfrom a company security official that the impact zone began at the 78th floor, a ladder company transmitted this \ninformation, and the battalion chief directed an engine company staged on the 40th floor to attempt to find an \nelevator to reach that upper level.  \n\nTo our knowledge, no FDNY chiefs outside the South Tower realized that the repeater channel was functioning and \nbeing used by units in that tower. The senior chief in the South Tower lobby was initially unable to communicate his \nrequests for more units to chiefs either in the North Tower lobby or at the outdoor command post.  \n\nFrom approximately 9:21 on, the ascending battalion chief was unable to reach the South Tower lobby command \npost because the senior chief in the lobby had ceased to communicate on repeater channel 7. The vast majority of \nunits that entered the South Tower did not communicate on the repeater channel.  \n\nThe first FDNY fatality of the day occurred at approximately 9:30, when a civilian landed on and killed a fireman \nnear the intersection of West and Liberty streets.  \n\nBy 9:30, chiefs in charge of the South Tower still were in need of additional companies. Several factors account for \nthe lag in response. First, only two units that had been dispatched to the North Tower prior to 9:03 reported \nimmediately to the South Tower. Second, units were not actually sent until approximately five minutes after the \nFDNY Chief of Department ordered their dispatch. Third, those units that had been ordered at 8:53 to stage at the \nBrooklyn-Battery Tunnel - and thus very close to the WTC complex - were not dispatched after the plane hit the \nSouth Tower. Fourth, units parked further north on West Street, then proceeded south on foot and stopped at the \noverall FDNY command post on West Street, where in some cases they were told to wait. Fifth, some units \nresponded directly to the North Tower. (Indeed, radio communications indicated that in certain cases some firemen \nbelieved that the South Tower was 1 WTC when in fact it was 2 WTC. ) Sixth, some units couldn't find the staging \narea (at West Street south of Liberty) for the South Tower. Finally, the jumpers and debris that confronted units \nattempting to enter the South Tower from its main entrance on Liberty Street caused some units to search for \nindirect ways to enter that tower, most often through the Marriott Hotel, or simply to remain on West Street.  \n\nA chief at the overall outdoor command post was under the impression that he was to assist in lobby operations of \nthe South Tower, and in fact his aide already was in that lobby. But because of his lack of familiarity with the WTC \ncomplex and confusion over how to get to there, he instead ended up in the Marriott at about 9:35. Here he came \nacross about 14 units, many of which had been trying to find safe access to the South Tower. He directed them to\n\nsecure the elevators and conduct search-and-rescue operations on the upper floors of the Marriott. Four of these \ncompanies searched the spa on the hotel's top floor - the 22nd floor - for civilians, and found none.  \n\nFeeling satisfied with the scope of the operation in the Marriott, the chief in the lobby there directed some units to \nproceed to what he thought was the South Tower. In fact, he pointed them to the North Tower. Three of the FDNY \n\n\n\ncompanies who had entered the North Tower from the Marriott found a working elevator in a bank at the south end \nof the lobby, which they took to the 23rd floor.  \n\nIn response to the shortage of units in the South Tower, at 9:37 an additional second alarm was requested by the \nchief at the West and Liberty streets staging area. At this time, the units that earlier had been staged on the \nBrooklyn side of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel were dispatched to the South Tower; some had gone through the \ntunnel already and had responded to the Marriott, not the South Tower.  \n\nBetween 9:45 and 9:58, the ascending battalion chief continued to lead FDNY operations on the upper floors of the \nSouth Tower. At 9:50, an FDNY ladder company encountered numerous seriously injured civilians on the 70th floor. \nWith the assistance of a security guard, at 9:53 a group of civilians trapped in an elevator on the 78th-floor sky \nlobby were found by an FDNY company. They were freed from the elevator at 9:58. By that time the battalion chief \nhad reached the 78th floor on stairwell A; he reported that it looked open to the 79th floor, well into the impact zone. \nHe also reported numerous civilian fatalities in the area.  \n\nFDNY Command and Control Outside the Towers. The overall command post consisted of senior chiefs, \ncommissioners, the field communications van (Field Comm), numerous units that began to arrive after the South \nTower was hit, and EMS chiefs and personnel.  \n\nField Comm's two main functions were to relay information between the overall operations command post and \nFDNY dispatch and to track all units operating at the scene on a large magnetic board. Both of these missions were \nseverely compromised by the magnitude of the disaster on September 11. First, the means of transmitting \ninformation were unreliable. For example, while FDNY dispatch advised Field Comm that 100 people were reported \nvia 911 to be trapped on the 105th floor of the North Tower, and Field Comm then attempted to convey that report \nto chiefs at the outdoor command post, this information did not reach the North Tower lobby. Second, Field Comm's \nability to keep track of which units were operating where was limited, because many units reported directly to the \nNorth Tower, the South Tower, or the Marriott. Third, efforts to track units by listening to tactical 1 were severely \nhampered by the number of units using that channel; as many people tried to speak at once, their transmissions \noverlapped and often became indecipherable. In the opinion of one of the members of the Field\n\nComm group, tactical 1 simply was not designed to handle the number of units operating on it that morning.  \n\nThe primary Field Comm van had access to the NYPD's Special Operations channel (used by NYPD Aviation), but \nit was in the garage for repairs on September 11. The backup van lacked that capability.  \n\nThe Chief of Department, along with civilian commissioners and senior EMS chiefs, organized ambulances on West \nStreet to expedite the transport of injured civilians to hospitals.  \n\nTo our knowledge, none of the chiefs present believed that a total collapse of either tower was possible. One senior \nchief did articulate his concern that upper floors could begin to collapse in a few hours, and that firefighters thus \nshould not ascend above floors in the 60s. That opinion was not conveyed to chiefs in the North Tower lobby, and \nthere is no evidence that it was conveyed to chiefs in the South Tower lobby either.  \n\nAlthough the Chief of Department had general authority over operations, tactical decisions remained the province of \nthe lobby commanders. The highest-ranking officer in the North Tower was responsible for communicating with the \nChief of Department. They had two brief conversations. In the first, the senior lobby chief gave the Chief of \nDepartment a status report and confirmed that this was a rescue, not firefighting, operation. In the second \nconversation, at about 9:45, the Chief of Department suggested that given how the North Tower appeared to him, \nthe senior lobby chief might want to consider evacuating FDNY personnel.  \n\nAt 9:46, the Chief of Department called an additional fifth alarm, and at 9:54 an additional 20 engine and 6 ladder \ncompanies were sent to the WTC. As a result, more than one-third of all FDNY companies now had been \ndispatched to the WTC. At about 9:57, an EMS paramedic approached the FDNY Chief of Department and advised \nthat an engineer in front of 7 WTC had just remarked that the Twin Towers in fact were in imminent danger of a total \ncollapse.  \n\n\n\nNYPD Response \n\nImmediately after the second plane hit, the Chief of Department of the NYPD ordered a second Level 4 \nmobilization, bringing the total number of NYPD officers responding to close to 2, 000.  \n\nThe NYPD Chief of Department called for Operation Omega, which required the protection of sensitive locations \naround the city. NYPD headquarters were secured and all other government buildings were evacuated.  \n\nThe ESU command post at Church andVesey streets coordinated all NYPD ESU rescue teams. After the South \nTower was hit, the ESU officer running this command post decided to send one ESU team (each with approximately \nsix police officers) up each of the Twin Towers' stairwells. While he continued to monitor the citywide SOD channel, \nwhich NYPD helicopters were using, he also monitored the point-to-point tactical channel that the ESU teams \nclimbing in the towers would use.  \n\nThe first NYPD ESU team entered the West Street-level lobby of the North Tower and prepared to begin climbing at \nabout 9:15 A. M. They attempted to check in with the FDNY chiefs present, but were rebuffed. OEM personnel did \nnot intervene. The ESU team began to climb the stairs. Shortly thereafter, a second NYPD ESU team entered the \nSouth Tower. The OEM field responder present ensured that they check in with the FDNY chief in charge of the \nlobby, and it was agreed that the ESU team would ascend and support FDNY personnel.  \n\nA third ESU team subsequently entered the North Tower at its elevated mezzanine lobby level and made no effort \nto check in with the FDNY command post. A fourth ESU team entered the South Tower. By 9:59, a fifth ESU team \nwas next to 6 WTC and preparing to enter the North Tower.  \n\nBy approximately 9:50, the lead ESU team had reached the 31st floor, observing that there appeared to be no more \ncivilians still descending. This ESU team encountered a large group of firefighters and administered oxygen to \nsome of them who were exhausted.  \n\nAt about 9:56, the officer running the ESU command post on Church and Vesey streets had a final radio \ncommunication with one of the ESU teams in the South Tower. The team then stated that it was ascending via \nstairs, was somewhere in the 20s, and was making slow progress because of the numerous descending civilians \ncrowding the stairwell.  \n\nThree plainclothes NYPD officers without radios or protective gear had begun ascending either stairwell A or C of \nthe North Tower. They began checking every other floor above the 12th for civilians. Only occasionally did they find \nany, and in those few cases they ordered the civilians to evacuate immediately. While checking floors, they used \noffice phones to call their superiors. In one phone call an NYPD chief instructed them to leave the North Tower, but \nthey refused to do so. As they climbed higher, they encountered increasing smoke and heat. Shortly before 10:00 \nthey arrived on the 54th floor.  \n\nThroughout this period (9:03 to 9:59), a group of NYPD and Port Authority police officers, as well as two Secret \nService agents, continued to assist civilians leaving the North Tower. They were positioned around the mezzanine \nlobby level of the North Tower, directing civilians leaving stairwells A and C to evacuate down an escalator to the \nconcourse. The officers instructed those civilians who seemed composed to evacuate the complex calmly but \nrapidly. Other civilians exiting the stairs who were either injured or exhausted collapsed at the foot of these stairs; \nofficers then assisted them out of the building.  \n\nWhen civilians reached the concourse, another NYPD officer stationed at the bottom of the escalator directed them \nto exit through the concourse to the north and east and then out of the WTC complex. This exit route ensured that \ncivilians would not be endangered by falling debris and people on West Street, on the plaza between the towers, \nand on Liberty Street.  \n\nSome officers positioned themselves at the top of a flight of stairs by 5 WTC that led down into the concourse, \ngoing into the concourse when necessary\n\nto evacuate injured or disoriented civilians. Numerous other NYPD officers were stationed throughout the \nconcourse, assisting burned, injured, and disoriented civilians, as well as directing all civilians to exit to the north \nand east. NYPD officers were also in the South Tower lobby to assist in civilian evacuation. NYPD officers stationed \n\n\n\non Vesey Street between West Street and Church Street urged civilians not to remain in the area and instead to \nkeep walking north.  \n\nAt 9:06, the NYPD Chief of Department instructed that no units were to land on the roof of either tower. At about \n9:30, one of the helicopters present advised that a rooftop evacuation still would not be possible. One NYPD \nhelicopter pilot believed one portion of the North Tower roof to be free enough of smoke that a hoist could be \nlowered in order to rescue people, but there was no one on the roof. This pilot's helicopter never attempted to hover \ndirectly over the tower. Another helicopter did attempt to do so, and its pilot stated that the severity of the heat from \nthe jet fuel-laden fire in the North Tower would have made it impossible to hover low enough for a rescue, because \nthe high temperature would have destabilized the helicopter.  \n\nAt 9:51, an aviation unit warned units of large pieces of debris hanging from the building. Prior to 9:59, no NYPD \nhelicopter pilot predicted that either tower would collapse.  \n\nInteraction of 911 Calls and NYPD Operations. At 9:37, a civilian on the 106th floor of the South Tower reported \nto a 911 operator that a lower floor - the \"90-something floor\" - was collapsing. This information was conveyed \ninaccurately by the 911 operator to an NYPD dispatcher. The dispatcher further confused the substance of the 911 \ncall by telling NYPD officers at the WTC complex that \"the 106th floor is crumbling\" at 9:52, 15 minutes after the \n911 call was placed. The NYPD dispatcher conveyed this message on the radio frequency used in precincts in the \nvicinity of the WTC and subsequently on the Special Operations Division channel, but not on City Wide channel 1.  \n\nPAPD Response \n\nInitial responders from outside PAPD commands proceeded to the police desk in 5 WTC or to the fire safety desk in \nthe North Tower lobby. Some officers were then assigned to assist in stairwell evacuations; others were assigned to \nexpedite evacuation in the plaza, concourse, and PATH station. As information was received of civilians trapped \nabove ground-level floors of the North Tower, other PAPD officers were instructed to climb to those floors for rescue \nefforts. Still others began climbing toward the impact zone.  \n\nAt 9:11, the PAPD Superintendent and an inspector began walking up stairwell B of the North Tower to assess \ndamage near and in the impact zone. The PAPD Chief and several other PAPD officers began ascending a \nstairwell in\n\norder to reach the Windows on the World restaurant on the 106th floor, from which calls had been made to the \nPAPD police desk reporting at least 100 people trapped.  \n\nMany PAPD officers from different commands responded on their own initiative. By 9:30, the PAPD central police \ndesk requested that responding officers meet at West and Vesey and await further instructions. In the absence of a \npredetermined command structure to deal with an incident of this magnitude, a number of PAPD inspectors, \ncaptains, and lieutenants stepped forward at around 9:30 to formulate an on-site response plan. They were \nhampered by not knowing how many officers were responding to the site and where those officers were operating. \nMany of the officers who responded to this command post lacked suitable protective equipment to enter the \ncomplex.  \n\nBy 9:58, one PAPD officer had reached the 44th-floor sky lobby of the North Tower. Also in the North Tower, one \nteam of PAPD officers was in the mid-20s and another was in the lower 20s. Numerous PAPD officers were also \nclimbing in the South Tower, including the PAPD ESU team. Many PAPD officers were on the ground floors of the \ncomplex - some assisting in evacuation, others manning the PAPD desk in 5 WTC or assisting at lobby command \nposts.  \n\nOEM Response \n\nAfter the South Tower was hit, OEM senior leadership decided to remain in its \"bunker\" and continue conducting \noperations, even though all civilians had been evacuated from 7 WTC. At approximately 9:30, a senior OEM official \n\n\n\nordered the evacuation of the facility, after a Secret Service agent in 7 WTC advised him that additional commercial \nplanes were not accounted for. Prior to its evacuation, no outside agency liaisons had reached OEM. OEM field \nresponders were stationed in each tower's lobby, at the FDNY overall command post, and, at least for some period \nof time, at the NYPD command post at Church and Vesey.  \n\nSummary \n\nThe emergency response effort escalated with the crash of United 175 into the South Tower. With that escalation, \ncommunications as well as command and control became increasingly critical and increasingly difficult. First \nresponders assisted thousands of civilians in evacuating the towers, even as incident commanders from responding \nagencies lacked knowledge of what other agencies and, in some cases, their own responders were doing.\n\nFrom 9:59 until 10:28 A. M. \n\nAt 9:58:59, the South Tower collapsed in ten seconds, killing all civilians and emergency personnel inside, as well a \nnumber of individuals - both first responders and civilians - in the concourse, in the Marriott, and on neighboring \nstreets. The building collapsed into itself, causing a ferocious windstorm and\n\ncreating a massive debris cloud. The Marriott hotel suffered significant damage as a result of the collapse of the \nSouth Tower.  \n\nCivilian Response in the North Tower \n\nThe 911 calls placed from most locations in the North Tower grew increasingly desperate as time went on. As late \nas 10:28, people remained alive in some locations, including on the 92nd and 79th floors. Below the impact zone, it \nis likely that most civilians who were physically and emotionally capable of descending had exited the tower. The \ncivilians who were nearing the bottom of stairwell C were assisted out of the building by NYPD, FDNY, and PAPD \npersonnel. Others, who experienced difficulty evacuating, were being helped by first responders on lower floors.  \n\nFDNY Response \n\nImmediate Impact of the Collapse of the South Tower. The FDNY overall command post and posts in the North \nTower lobby, the Marriott lobby, and the staging area on West Street south of Liberty all ceased to operate upon the \ncollapse of the South Tower, as did EMS staging areas, because of their proximity to the building.  \n\nThose who had been in the North Tower lobby had no way of knowing that the South Tower had suffered a \ncomplete collapse. Chiefs who had fled from the overall command post on the west side of West Street took shelter \nin the underground parking garage at 2 World Financial Center and were not available to influence FDNY \noperations for the next ten minutes or so.  \n\nWhen the South Tower collapsed, firefighters on upper floors of the North Tower heard a violent roar, and many \nwere knocked off their feet; they saw debris coming up the stairs and observed that the power was lost and \nemergency lights activated. Nevertheless, those firefighters not standing near windows facing south had no way of \nknowing that the South Tower had collapsed; many surmised that a bomb had exploded, or that the North Tower \nhad suffered a partial collapse on its upper floors.  \n\nWe do not know whether the repeater channel continued to function after 9:59.  \n\nInitial Evacuation Instructions and Communications. The South Tower's total collapse was immediately \ncommunicated on the Manhattan dispatch channel by an FDNY boat on the Hudson River; but to our knowledge, no \none at the site received this information, because every FDNY command post had been abandoned - including the \n\n\n\noverall command post, which included the Field Comm van. Despite his lack of knowledge of what had happened to \nthe South Tower, a chief in the process of evacuating the North Tower lobby sent out an order within a minute of \nthe collapse:\"Command to all units in Tower 1, evacuate the building. \"Another chief from the North Tower lobby \nsoon followed with an additional evacuation order issued on tactical 1.  \n\nEvacuation orders did not follow the protocol for giving instructions when a building's collapse may be imminent - a \nprotocol that includes constantly repeating \"Mayday, Mayday, Mayday\" - during the 29 minutes between the fall of \nthe South Tower and that of the North Tower. In addition, most of the evacuation instructions did not mention that \nthe South Tower had collapsed. However, at least three firefighters heard evacuation instructions which stated that \nthe North Tower was in danger of \"imminent collapse. \"  \n\nFDNY Personnel above the Ground Floors of the North Tower. Within minutes, some firefighters began to hear \nevacuation orders over tactical 1. At least one chief also gave the evacuation instruction on the command channel \nused only by chiefs in the North Tower, which was much less crowded.  \n\nAt least two battalion chiefs on upper floors of the North Tower - one on the 23rd floor and one on the 35th floor - \nheard the evacuation instruction on the command channel and repeated it to everyone they came across. The chief \non the 23rd floor apparently aggressively took charge to ensure that all firefighters on the floors in the immediate \narea were evacuating. The chief on the 35th floor also heard a separate radio communication stating that the South \nTower had collapsed (which the chief on the 23rd floor may have heard as well). He subsequently acted with a \nsense of urgency, and some firefighters heard the evacuation order for the first time when he repeated it on tactical \n1. This chief also had a bullhorn and traveled to each of the stairwells and shouted the evacuation order:\"All FDNY, \nget the fuck out! \"As a result of his efforts, many firefighters who had not been in the process of evacuating began \nto do so.  \n\nOther firefighters did not receive the evacuation transmissions, for one of four reasons: First, some FDNY radios did \nnot pick up the transmission because of the difficulties of radio communications in high-rises. Second, the numbers \ntrying to use tactical 1 after the South Tower collapsed may have drowned out some evacuation instructions. \nAccording to one FDNY lieutenant who was on the 31st floor of the North Tower at the time, \"[Tactical] channel 1 \njust might have been so bogged down that it may have been impossible to get that order through. \"   Third, some \nfirefighters in the North Tower were off-duty and did not have radios. Fourth, some firefighters in the North Tower \nhad been dispatched to the South Tower and likely were on the different tactical channel assigned to that tower.  \n\nFDNY personnel in the North Tower who received the evacuation orders did not respond uniformly. Some units - \nincluding one whose officer knew that the South Tower had collapsed - either delayed or stopped their evacuation \nin order to assist nonambulatory civilians. Some units whose members had become separated during the climb \nattempted to regroup so they could descend together. Some units began to evacuate but, according to \neyewitnesses, did not hurry. At least several firefighters who survived believed that they and others would have \nevacuated more urgently had they known of the South Tower's complete collapse. Other firefighters continued to sit \nand rest on floors\n\nwhile other companies descended past them and reminded them that they were supposed to evacuate. Some \nfirefighters were determined not to leave the building while other FDNY personnel remained inside and, in one \ncase, convinced others to remain with them. In another case, firefighters had successfully descended to the lobby, \nwhere another firefighter then persuaded them to reascend in order to look for specific FDNY personnel.  \n\nOther FDNY personnel did not hear the evacuation order on their radio but were advised orally to leave the building \nby other firefighters and police who were themselves evacuating.  \n\nBy 10:24, approximately five FDNY companies reached the bottom of stairwell B and entered the North Tower \nlobby. They stood in the lobby for more than a minute, not certain what to do, as no chiefs were present. Finally, \none firefighter - who had earlier seen from a window that the South Tower had collapsed - urged that they all leave, \nas this tower could fall as well. The units then proceeded to exit onto West Street. While they were doing so, the \nNorth Tower began its pancake collapse, killing some of these men.  \n\n\n\nOther FDNY Personnel. The Marriott Hotel suffered significant damage in the collapse of the South Tower. Those \nin the lobby were knocked down and enveloped in the darkness of a debris cloud. Some were hurt but could walk. \nOthers were more severely injured, and some were trapped. Several firefighters came across a group of about 50 \ncivilians who had been taking shelter in the restaurant and assisted them in evacuating. Up above, at the time of the \nSouth Tower's collapse four companies were descending the stairs single file in a line of approximately 20 men. \nFour survived.  \n\nAt the time of the South Tower's collapse, two FDNY companies were either at the eastern side of the North Tower \nlobby, near the mall concourse, or actually in the mall concourse, trying to reach the South Tower. Many of these \nmen were thrown off their feet by the collapse of the South Tower; they then attempted to regroup in the darkness \nof the debris cloud and evacuate civilians and themselves, not knowing that the South Tower had collapsed. \nSeveral of these firefighters subsequently searched the PATH station below the concourse - unaware that the \nPAPD had cleared the area of all civilians by 9:19.  \n\nAt about 10:15, the FDNY Chief of Department and the Chief of Safety, who had returned to West Street from the \nparking garage, confirmed that the South Tower had collapsed. The Chief of Department issued a radio order for all \nunits to evacuate the North Tower, repeating it about five times. He then directed that the FDNY command post be \nmoved further north on West Street and told FDNY units in the area to proceed north on West Street toward \nChambers Street. At approximately 10:25, he radioed for two ladder companies to respond to the Marriott, where he \nwas aware that both FDNY personnel and civilians were trapped.  \n\nMany chiefs, including several of those who had been in the North Tower lobby, did not learn that the South Tower \nhad collapsed until 30 minutes or\n\nmore after the event. According to two eyewitnesses, however, one senior FDNY chief who knew that the South \nTower had collapsed strongly expressed the opinion that the North Tower would not collapse, because unlike the \nSouth Tower, it had not been hit on a corner.  \n\nAfter the South Tower collapsed, some firefighters on the streets neighboring the North Tower remained where they \nwere or came closer to the North Tower. Some of these firefighters did not know that the South Tower had \ncollapsed, but many chose despite that knowledge to remain in an attempt to save additional lives. According to \none such firefighter, a chief who was preparing to mount a search-and-rescue mission in the Marriott, \"I would \nnever think of myself as a leader of men if I had headed north on West Street after [the] South Tower collapsed. \" \nJust outside the North Tower on West Street one firefighter was directing others exiting the building, telling them \nwhen no jumpers were coming down and it was safe to run out. A senior chief had grabbed an NYPD bullhorn and \nwas urging firefighters exiting onto West Street to continue running north, well away from the WTC. Three of the \nmost senior and respected members of the FDNY were involved in attempting to rescue civilians and firefighters \nfrom the Marriott.  \n\nNYPD Response \n\nA member of the NYPD Aviation Unit radioed that the South Tower had collapsed immediately after it happened, \nand further advised that all people in the WTC complex and nearby areas should be evacuated. At 10:04, NYPD \naviation reported that the top 15 stories of the North Tower \"were glowing red\" and that they might collapse. At \n10:08, a helicopter pilot warned that he did not believe the North Tower would last much longer.  \n\nImmediately after the South Tower collapsed, many NYPD radio frequencies became overwhelmed with \ntransmissions relating to injured, trapped, or missing officers. As a result, NYPD radio communications became \nstrained on most channels. Nevertheless, they remained effective enough for the two closest NYPD mobilization \npoints to be moved further from the WTC at 10:06.  \n\nJust like most firefighters, the ESU rescue teams in the North Tower had no idea that the South Tower had \ncollapsed. However, by 10:00 the ESU officer running the command post at Church and Vesey ordered the \nevacuation of all ESU units from the WTC complex. This officer, who had observed the South Tower collapse, \nreported it to ESU units in the North Tower in his evacuation instruction.  \n\n\n\nThis instruction was clearly heard by the two ESU units already in the North Tower and the other ESU unit \npreparing to enter the tower. The ESU team on the 31st floor found the full collapse of the South Tower so \nunfathomable that they radioed back to the ESU officer at the command post and asked him to repeat his \ncommunication. He reiterated his urgent message.  \n\nThe ESU team on the 31st floor conferred with the FDNY personnel there to ensure that they, too, knew that they \nhad to evacuate, then proceeded down\n\nstairwell B. During the descent, they reported seeing many firefighters who were resting and did not seem to be in \nthe process of evacuating. They further reported advising these firefighters to evacuate, but said that at times they \nwere not acknowledged. In the opinion of one of the ESU officers, some of these firefighters essentially refused to \ntake orders from cops. At least one firefighter who was in the North Tower has supported that assessment, stating \nthat he was not going to take an evacuation instruction from a cop that morning. However, another firefighter \nreports that ESU officers ran past him without advising him to evacuate.  \n\nThe ESU team on the 11th floor began descending stairwell C after receiving the evacuation order. Once near the \nmezzanine level - where stairwell C ended - this team spread out in chain formation, stretching from several floors \ndown to the mezzanine itself. They used their flashlights to provide a path of beacons through the darkness and \ndebris for civilians climbing down the stairs. Eventually, when no one else appeared to be descending, the ESU \nteam exited the North Tower and ran one at a time to 6 WTC, dodging those who still were jumping from the upper \nfloors of the North Tower by acting as spotters for each other. They remained in the area, conducting additional \nsearches for civilians; all but two of them died.  \n\nAfter surviving the South Tower's collapse, the ESU team that had been preparing to enter the North Tower spread \ninto chain formation and created a path for civilians (who had exited from the North Tower mezzanine) to evacuate \nthe WTC complex by descending the stairs on the north side of 5 and 6 WTC, which led down to Vesey Street. \nThey remained at this post until the North Tower collapsed, yet all survived.  \n\nThe three plainclothes NYPD officers who had made it up to the 54th floor of the North Tower felt the building shake \nviolently at 9:59 as the South Tower collapsed (though they did not know the cause). Immediately thereafter, they \nwere joined by three firefighters from an FDNY engine company. One of the firefighters apparently heard an \nevacuation order on his radio, but responded in a return radio communication, \"We're not fucking coming out! \" \nHowever, the firefighters urged the police officers to descend because they lacked the protective gear and \nequipment needed to handle the increasing smoke and heat. The police officers reluctantly began descending, \nchecking that the lower floors were clear of civilians. They proceeded down stairwell B, poking their heads into \nevery floor and briefly looking for civilians.  \n\nOther NYPD officers helping evacuees on the mezzanine level of the North Tower were enveloped in the debris \ncloud that resulted from the South Tower's collapse. They struggled to regroup in the darkness and to evacuate \nboth themselves and civilians they encountered. At least one of them died in the collapse of the North Tower. At \nleast one NYPD officer from this area managed to evacuate out toward 5 WTC, where he teamed up with a Port \nAuthority police officer and acted as a spotter in advising the civilians who were still exiting\n\nwhen they could safely run from 1 WTC to 5 WTC and avoid being struck by people and debris falling from the \nupper floors.  \n\nAt the time of the collapse of the South Tower, there were numerous NYPD officers in the concourse, some of \nwhom are believed to have died there. Those who survived struggled to evacuate themselves in darkness, assisting \ncivilians as they exited the concourse in all directions.  \n\nPort Authority Response \n\nThe collapse of the South Tower forced the evacuation of the PAPD command post on West and Vesey, compelling \nPAPD officers to move north. There is no evidence that PAPD officers without WTC Command radios received an \nevacuation order by radio. Some of these officers in the North Tower decided to evacuate, either on their own or in \nconsultation with other first responders they came across. Some greatly slowed their own descent in order to assist \nnonambulatory civilians.  \n\n\n\nAfter 10:28  A  .  M  . \n\nThe North Tower collapsed at 10:28:25 A. M. , killing all civilians alive on upper floors, an undetermined number \nbelow, and scores of first responders. The FDNY Chief of Department, the Port Authority Police Department \nSuperintendent, and many of their senior staff were killed. Incredibly, twelve firefighters, one PAPD officer, and \nthree civilians who were descending stairwell B of the North Tower survived its collapse.  \n\nOn September 11, the nation suffered the largest loss of life - 2, 973 - on its soil as a result of hostile attack in its \nhistory. The FDNY suffered 343 fatalities - the largest loss of life of any emergency response agency in history. The \nPAPD suffered 37 fatalities - the largest loss of life of any police force in history. The NYPD suffered 23 fatalities - \nthe second largest loss of life of any police force in history, exceeded only by the number of PAPD officers lost the \nsame day.  \n\nMayor Giuliani, along with the Police and Fire commissioners and the OEM director, moved quickly north and \nestablished an emergency operations command post at the Police Academy. Over the coming hours, weeks, and \nmonths, thousands of civilians and city, state, and federal employees devoted themselves around the clock to \nputting New York City back on its feet.  \n\n9. 3 EMERGENCY RESPONSE AT THE PENTAGON \n\nIf it had happened on any other day, the disaster at the Pentagon would be remembered as a singular challenge \nand an extraordinary national story. Yet the calamity at the World Trade Center that same morning included \ncatastrophic damage 1, 000 feet above the ground that instantly imperiled tens of thousands of people. The two \nexperiences are not comparable. Nonetheless, broader les- The Twin Towers following the impact of American \nAirlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 \n\n  \u2022 \n\n The Pentagon, after being struck by American Airlines Flight 77 \n\n  \u2022 \n\n United Airlines Flight 93 crash site, Shanksville, Pennsylvania \n\n  \u2022 \n\nsons in integrating multiagency response efforts are apparent when we analyze the response at the Pentagon.\n\nThe emergency response at the Pentagon represented a mix of local, state, and federal jurisdictions and was \ngenerally effective. It overcame the inherent complications of a response across jurisdictions because the Incident \nCommand System, a formalized management structure for emergency response, was in place in the National \nCapital Region on 9/11.  \n\nBecause of the nature of the event - a plane crash, fire, and partial building collapse - the Arlington County Fire \nDepartment served as incident commander. Different agencies had different roles. The incident required a major \nrescue, fire, and medical response from Arlington County at the U. S. military's headquarters - a facility under the \ncontrol of the secretary of defense. Since it was a terrorist attack, the Department of Justice was the lead federal \nagency in charge (with authority delegated to the FBI for operational response). Additionally, the terrorist attack \naffected the daily operations and emergency management requirements of Arlington County and all bordering and \nsurrounding jurisdictions.  \n\nAt 9:37, the west wall of the Pentagon was hit by hijacked American Airlines Flight 77, a Boeing 757. The crash \ncaused immediate and catastrophic damage. All 64 people aboard the airliner were killed, as were 125 people \ninside the Pentagon (70 civilians and 55 military service members). One hundred six people were seriously injured \nand transported to area hospitals.  \n\nWhile no emergency response is flawless, the response to the 9/11 terrorist attack on the Pentagon was mainly a \nsuccess for three reasons: first, the strong professional relationships and trust established among emergency \n\n\n\nresponders; second, the adoption of the Incident Command System; and third, the pursuit of a regional approach to \nresponse. Many fire and police agencies that responded had extensive prior experience working together on \nregional events and training exercises. Indeed, at the time preparations were under way at many of these agencies \nto ensure public safety at the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank scheduled to \nbe held later that month in Washington, D. C.  \n\nLocal, regional, state, and federal agencies immediately responded to the Pentagon attack. In addition to county \nfire, police, and sheriff 's departments, the response was assisted by the Metropolitan Washington Airports \nAuthority, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport Fire Department, Fort Myer Fire Department, the Virginia \nState Police, the Virginia Department of Emergency Management, the FBI, FEMA, a National Medical Response \nTeam, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and numerous military personnel within the Military District of \nWashington.  \n\nCommand was established at 9:41. At the same time, the Arlington County Emergency Communications Center \ncontacted the fire departments of Fairfax County, Alexandria, and the District of Columbia to request mutual aid.\n\nThe incident command post provided a clear view of and access to the crash site, allowing the incident commander \nto assess the situation at all times.  \n\nAt 9:55, the incident commander ordered an evacuation of the Pentagon impact area because a partial collapse \nwas imminent; it occurred at 9:57, and no first responder was injured.  \n\nAt 10:15, the incident commander ordered a full evacuation of the command post because of the warning of an \napproaching hijacked aircraft passed along by the FBI. This was the first of three evacuations caused by reports of \nincoming aircraft, and the evacuation order was well communicated and well coordinated.  \n\nSeveral factors facilitated the response to this incident, and distinguish it from the far more difficult task in New \nYork. There was a single incident, and it was not 1, 000 feet above ground. The incident site was relatively easy to \nsecure and contain, and there were no other buildings in the immediate area. There was no collateral damage \nbeyond the Pentagon.  \n\nYet the Pentagon response encountered difficulties that echo those experienced in New York. As the \"Arlington \nCounty: After-Action Report\" notes, there were significant problems with both self-dispatching and communications: \n\"Organizations, response units, and individuals proceeding on their own initiative directly to an incident site, without \nthe knowledge and permission of the host jurisdiction and the Incident Commander, complicate the exercise of \ncommand, increase the risks faced by bonafide responders, and exacerbate the challenge of accountability. \"With \nrespect to communications, the report concludes: \"Almost all aspects of communications continue to be \nproblematic, from initial notification to tactical operations. Cellular telephones were of little value. . . . Radio \nchannels were initially oversaturated. . . . Pagers seemed to be the most reliable means of notification when \navailable and used, but most firefighters are not issued pagers. \"  \n\nIt is a fair inference, given the differing situations in New York City and Northern Virginia, that the problems in \ncommand, control, and communications that occurred at both sites will likely recur in any emergency of similar \nscale. The task looking forward is to enable first responders to respond in a coordinated manner with the greatest \npossible awareness of the situation.\n\n9. 4 ANALYSIS \n\nLike the national defense effort described in chapter 1, the emergency response to the attacks on 9/11 was \nnecessarily improvised. In New York, the FDNY, NYPD, the Port Authority, WTC employees, and the building \noccupants themselves did their best to cope with the effects of an unimaginable catastrophe - unfolding furiously \nover a mere 102 minutes - for which they were unprepared in terms of both training and mindset. As a result of the\n\nefforts of first responders, assistance from each other, and their own good instincts and goodwill, the vast majority \nof civilians below the impact zone were able to evacuate the towers.\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology has provided a preliminary estimation that between 16, 400 and \n18, 800 civilians were in the WTC complex as of 8:46 A. M. on September 11. At most 2, 152 individuals died at the \n\n\n\nWTC complex who were not (1) fire or police first responders, (2) security or fire safety personnel of the WTC or \nindividual companies, (3) volunteer civilians who ran to the WTC after the planes' impact to help others, or (4) on \nthe two planes that crashed into the Twin Towers. Out of this total number of fatalities, we can account for the \nworkplace location of 2, 052 individuals, or 95. 35 percent. Of this number, 1, 942 or 94. 64 percent either worked or \nwere supposed to attend a meeting at or above the respective impact zones of the Twin Towers; only 110, or 5. 36 \npercent of those who died, worked below the impact zone. While a given person's office location at the WTC does \nnot definitively indicate where that individual died that morning or whether he or she could have evacuated, these \ndata strongly suggest that the evacuation was a success for civilians below the impact zone.  \n\nSeveral factors influenced the evacuation on September 11. It was aided greatly by changes made by the Port \nAuthority in response to the 1993 bombing and by the training of both Port Authority personnel and civilians after \nthat time. Stairwells remained lit near unaffected floors; some tenants relied on procedures learned in fire drills to \nhelp them to safety; others were guided down the stairs by fire safety officials based in the lobby. Because of \ndamage caused by the impact of the planes, the capability of the sophisticated building systems may have been \nimpaired. Rudimentary improvements, however, such as the addition of glow strips to the handrails and stairs, were \ncredited by some as the reason for their survival. The general evacuation time for the towers dropped from more \nthan four hours in 1993 to under one hour on September 11 for most civilians who were not trapped or physically \nincapable of enduring a long descent.\n\nFirst responders also played a significant role in the success of the evacuation. Some specific rescues are \nquantifiable, such as an FDNY company's rescue of civilians trapped on the 22d floor of the North Tower, or the \nsuccess of FDNY, PAPD, and NYPD personnel in carrying nonambulatory civilians out of both the North and South \nTowers. In other instances, intangibles combined to reduce what could have been a much higher death total. It is \nimpossible to measure how many more civilians who descended to the ground floors would have died but for the \nNYPD and PAPD personnel directing them - via safe exit routes that avoided jumpers and debris - to leave the \ncomplex urgently but calmly. It is impossible to measure how many more civilians would have died but for the \ndetermination of many members of the FDNY, PAPD, and NYPD to continue assisting civilians after the South \nTower collapsed. It is\n\nimpossible to measure the calming influence that ascending firefighters had on descending civilians or whether but \nfor the firefighters' presence the poor behavior of a very few civilians could have caused a dangerous and panicked \nmob flight. But the positive impact of the first responders on the evacuation came at a tremendous cost of first \nresponder lives lost.  \n\nCivilian and Private-Sector Challenges \n\nThe \"first\" first responders on 9/11, as in most catastrophes, were privatesector civilians. Because 85 percent of our \nnation's critical infrastructure is controlled not by government but by the private sector, private-sector civilians are \nlikely to be the first responders in any future catastrophes. For that reason, we have assessed the state of private \nsector and civilian preparedness in order to formulate recommendations to address this critical need. Our \nrecommendations grow out of the experience of the civilians at the World Trade Center on 9/11.\n\nLack of Protocol for Rooftop Rescues. Civilians at or above the impact zone in the North Tower had the smallest \nhope of survival. Once the plane struck, they were prevented from descending because of damage to or \nimpassable conditions in the building's three stairwells. The only hope for those on the upper floors of the North \nTower would have been a swift and extensive air rescue. Several factors made this impossible. Doors leading to the \nroof were kept locked for security reasons, and damage to software in the security command station prevented a \nlock release order from taking effect. Even if the doors had not been locked, structural and radiation hazards made \nthe rooftops unsuitable staging areas for a large number of civilians; and even if conditions permitted general \nhelicopter evacuations - which was not the case - only several people could be lifted at a time.\n\nThe WTC lacked any plan for evacuation of civilians on upper floors of the WTC in the event that all stairwells were \nimpassable below.\n\n\n\nLack of Comprehensive Evacuation of South Tower Immediately after the North Tower Impact. No decision \nhas been criticized more than the decision of building personnel not to evacuate the South Tower immediately after \nthe North Tower was hit. A firm and prompt evacuation order would likely have led many to safety. Even a strictly \n\"advisory\" announcement would not have dissuaded those who decided for themselves to evacuate. The advice to \nstay in place was understandable, however, when considered in its context. At that moment, no one appears to \nhave thought a second plane could hit the South Tower. The evacuation of thousands of people was seen as \ninherently dangerous. Additionally, conditions were hazardous in some areas outside the towers.  \n\nLess understandable, in our view, is the instruction given to some civilians\n\nwho had reached the lobby to return to their offices. They could have been held in the lobby or perhaps directed \nthrough the underground concourse.\n\nDespite the initial advice given over its public-address system, the South Tower was ordered to be evacuated by \nthe FDNY and PAPD within 12 minutes of the North Tower's being hit. If not for a second, unanticipated attack, the \nevacuation presumably would have proceeded.\n\nImpact of Fire Safety Plan and Fire Drills on Evacuation. Once the South Tower was hit, civilians on upper \nfloors wasted time ascending the stairs instead of searching for a clear path down, when stairwell A was at least \ninitially passable. Although rooftop rescues had not been conclusively ruled out, civilians were not informed in fire \ndrills that roof doors were locked, that rooftop areas were hazardous, and that no helicopter evacuation plan \nexisted.\n\nIn both towers, civilians who were able to reach the stairs and descend were also stymied by the deviations in the \nstairways and by smoke doors. This confusion delayed the evacuation of some and may have obstructed that of \nothers. The Port Authority has acknowledged that in the future, tenants should be made aware of what conditions \nthey will encounter during descent.\n\nImpact of 911 Calls on Evacuation. The NYPD's 911 operators and FDNY dispatch were not adequately \nintegrated into the emergency response. In several ways, the 911 system was not ready to cope with a major \ndisaster. These operators and dispatchers were one of the only sources of information for individuals at and above \nthe impact zone of the towers. The FDNY ordered both towers fully evacuated by 8:57, but this guidance was not \nconveyed to 911 operators and FDNY dispatchers, who for the next hour often continued to advise civilians not to \nself-evacuate, regardless of whether they were above or below the impact zones. Nor were 911 operators or FDNY \ndispatchers advised that rooftop rescues had been ruled out. This failure may have been harmful to civilians on the \nupper floors of the South Tower who called 911 and were not told that their only evacuation hope was to attempt to \ndescend, not to ascend. In planning for future disasters, it is important to integrate those taking 911 calls into the \nemergency response team and to involve them in providing upto- date information and assistance to the public.\n\nPreparedness of Individual Civilians. One clear lesson of September 11 is that individual civilians need to take \nresponsibility for maximizing the probability that they will survive, should disaster strike. Clearly, many building \noccupants in the World Trade Center did not take preparedness seriously. Individuals should know the exact \nlocation of every stairwell in their workplace. In addition, they should have access at all times to flashlights, which \nwere deemed invaluable by some civilians who managed to evacuate the WTC on September 11.\n\nChallenges Experienced by First Responders \n\nThe Challenge of Incident Command. As noted above, in July 2001, Mayor Giuliani updated a directive titled \n\"Direction and Control of Emergencies in the City of New York. \"The directive designated, for different types of \n\n\n\nemergencies, an appropriate agency as \"Incident Commander\"; it would be \"responsible for the management of the \nCity's response to the emergency. \"The directive also provided that where incidents are \"so multifaceted that no \none agency immediately stands out as the Incident Commander, OEM will assign the role of Incident Commander \nto an agency as the situation demands. \"  \n\nTo some degree, the Mayor's directive for incident command was followed on 9/11. It was clear that the lead \nresponse agency was the FDNY, and that the other responding local, federal, bistate, and state agencies acted in a \nsupporting role. There was a tacit understanding that FDNY personnel would have primary responsibility for \nevacuating civilians who were above the ground floors of the Twin Towers, while NYPD and PAPD personnel would \nbe in charge of evacuating civilians from the WTC complex once they reached ground level. The NYPD also greatly \nassisted responding FDNY units by clearing emergency lanes to the WTC.  \n\nIn addition, coordination occurred at high levels of command. For example, the Mayor and Police Commissioner \nconsulted with the Chief of the Department of the FDNY at approximately 9:20. There were other instances of \ncoordination at operational levels, and information was shared on an ad hoc basis. For example, an NYPD ESU \nteam passed the news of their evacuation order to firefighters in the North Tower.  \n\nIt is also clear, however, that the response operations lacked the kind of integrated communications and unified \ncommand contemplated in the directive. These problems existed both within and among individual responding \nagencies.\n\nCommand and Control within First Responder Agencies. For a unified incident management system to \nsucceed, each participant must have command and control of its own units and adequate internal communications. \nThis was not always the case at the WTC on 9/11.\n\nUnderstandably lacking experience in responding to events of the magnitude of the World Trade Center attacks, the \nFDNY as an institution proved incapable of coordinating the numbers of units dispatched to different points within \nthe 16-acre complex. As a result, numerous units were congregating in the undamaged Marriott Hotel and at the \noverall command post on West Street by 9:30, while chiefs in charge of the South Tower still were in desperate \nneed of units. With better understanding of the resources already available, additional units might not have been \ndispatched to the South Tower at 9:37.\n\nThe task of accounting for and coordinating the units was rendered difficult, if not impossible, by internal \ncommunications breakdowns resulting from\n\nthe limited capabilities of radios in the high-rise environment of the WTC and from confusion over which personnel \nwere assigned to which frequency. Furthermore, when the South Tower collapsed the overall FDNY command post \nceased to operate, which compromised the FDNY's ability to understand the situation; an FDNY marine unit's \nimmediate radio communication to FDNY dispatch that the South Tower had fully collapsed was not conveyed to \nchiefs at the scene. The FDNY's inability to coordinate and account for the different radio channels that would be \nused in an emergency of this scale contributed to the early lack of units in the South Tower, whose lobby chief \ninitially could not communicate with anyone outside that tower.  \n\nThough almost no one at 9:50 on September 11 was contemplating an imminent total collapse of the Twin Towers, \nmany first responders and civilians were contemplating the possibility of imminent additional terrorist attacks \nthroughout New York City. Had any such attacks occurred, the FDNY's response would have been severely \ncompromised by the concentration of so many of its off-duty personnel, particularly its elite personnel, at the WTC.\n\nThe Port Authority's response was hampered by the lack of both standard operating procedures and radios capable \nof enabling multiple commands to respond in unified fashion to an incident at the WTC. Many officers reporting from \nthe tunnel and airport commands could not hear instructions being issued over the WTC Command frequency. In \naddition, command and control was complicated by senior Port Authority Police officials becoming directly involved \nin frontline rescue operations.\n\nThe NYPD experienced comparatively fewer internal command and control and communications issues. Because \nthe department has a history of mobilizing thousands of officers for major events requiring crowd control, its \ntechnical radio capability and major incident protocols were more easily adapted to an incident of the magnitude of \n\n\n\n9/11. In addition, its mission that day lay largely outside the towers themselves. Although there were ESU teams \nand a few individual police officers climbing in the towers, the vast majority of NYPD personnel were staged \noutside, assisting with crowd control and evacuation and securing other sites in the city. The NYPD ESU division \nhad firm command and control over its units, in part because there were so few of them (in comparison to the \nnumber of FDNY companies) and all reported to the same ESU command post. It is unclear, however, whether \nnon-ESU NYPD officers operating on the ground floors, and in a few cases on upper floors, of the WTC were as \nwell coordinated.\n\nSignificant shortcomings within the FDNY's command and control capabilities were painfully exposed on September \n11. To its great credit, the department has made a substantial effort in the past three years to address these. While \nsignificant problems in the command and control of the PAPD also were exposed on September 11, it is less clear \nthat the Port Authority has adopted new training exercises or major incident protocols to address these \nshortcomings.  \n\nLack of Coordination among First Responder Agencies. Any attempt to establish a unified command on 9/11 \nwould have been further frustrated by the lack of communication and coordination among responding agencies. \nCertainly, the FDNY was not \"responsible for the management of the City's response to the emergency, \" as the \nMayor's directive would have required. The command posts were in different locations, and OEM headquarters, \nwhich could have served as a focal point for information sharing, did not play an integrating role in ensuring that \ninformation was shared among agencies on 9/11, even prior to its evacuation. There was a lack of comprehensive \ncoordination between FDNY, NYPD, and PAPD personnel climbing above the ground floors in the Twin Towers.\n\nInformation that was critical to informed decisionmaking was not shared among agencies. FDNY chiefs in \nleadership roles that morning have told us that their decision making capability was hampered by a lack of \ninformation from NYPD aviation. At 9:51 A. M. , a helicopter pilot cautioned that \"large pieces\" of the South Tower \nappeared to be about to fall and could pose a danger to those below. Immediately after the tower's collapse, a \nhelicopter pilot radioed that news. This transmission was followed by communications at 10:08, 10:15, and 10:22 \nthat called into question the condition of the North Tower. The FDNY chiefs would have benefited greatly had they \nbeen able to communicate with personnel in a helicopter.\n\nThe consequence of the lack of real-time intelligence from NYPD aviation should not be overstated. Contrary to a \nwidely held misperception, no NYPD helicopter predicted the fall of either tower before the South Tower collapsed, \nand no NYPD personnel began to evacuate the WTC complex prior to that time. Furthermore, the FDNY, as an \ninstitution, was in possession of the knowledge that the South Tower had collapsed as early as the NYPD, as its fall \nhad been immediately reported by an FDNY boat on a dispatch channel. Because of internal breakdowns within the \ndepartment, however, this information was not disseminated to FDNY personnel on the scene.\n\nThe FDNY, PAPD, and NYPD did not coordinate their units that were searching the WTC complex for civilians. In \nmany cases, redundant searches of specific floors and areas were conducted. It is unclear whether fewer first \nresponders in the aggregate would have been in the Twin Towers if there had been an integrated response, or what \nimpact, if any, redundant searches had on the total number of first responder fatalities.\n\nWhether the lack of coordination between the FDNY and NYPD on September 11 had a catastrophic effect has \nbeen the subject of controversy. We believe that there are too many variables for us to responsibly quantify those \nconsequences. It is clear that the lack of coordination did not affect adversely the evacuation of civilians. It is \nequally clear, however, that the Incident Command System did not function to integrate awareness among agencies \nor to facilitate interagency response.  \n\nIf New York and other major cities are to be prepared for future terrorist\n\nattacks, different first responder agencies within each city must be fully coordinated, just as different branches of \nthe U. S. military are. Coordination entails a unified command that comprehensively deploys all dispatched police, \nfire, and other first responder resources.\n\nIn May 2004, New York City adopted an emergency response plan that expressly contemplates two or more \nagencies jointly being lead agency when responding to a terrorist attack but does not mandate a comprehensive \n\n\n\nand unified incident command that can deploy and monitor all first responder resources from one overall command \npost. In our judgment, this falls short of an optimal response plan, which requires clear command and control, \ncommon training, and the trust that such training creates. The experience of the military suggests that integrated \ninto such a coordinated response should be a unified field intelligence unit, which should receive and combine \ninformation from all first responders - including 911 operators. Such a field intelligence unit could be valuable in \nlarge and complex incidents.\n\nRadio Communication Challenges:The Effectiveness and Urgency of Evacuation Instructions. As discussed \nabove, the location of the NYPD ESU command post was crucial in making possible an urgent evacuation order \nexplaining the South Tower's full collapse. Firefighters most certainly would have benefited from that information.\n\nA separate matter is the varied success at conveying evacuation instructions to personnel in the North Tower after \nthe South Tower's collapse. The success of NYPD ESU instruction is attributable to a combination of (1) the \nstrength of the radios, (2) the relatively small numbers of individuals using them, and (3) use of the correct channel \nby all.\n\nThe same three factors worked against successful communication among FDNY personnel. First, the radios' \neffectiveness was drastically reduced in the high-rise environment. Second, tactical channel 1 was simply \noverwhelmed by the number of units attempting to communicate on it at 10:00. Third, some firefighters were on the \nwrong channel or simply lacked radios altogether.\n\nIt is impossible to know what difference it made that units in the North Tower were not using the repeater channel \nafter 10:00. While the repeater channel was at least partially operational before the South Tower collapsed, we do \nnot know whether it continued to be operational after 9:59.\n\nEven without the repeater channel, at least 24 of the at most 32 companies who were dispatched to and actually in \nthe North Tower received the evacuation instruction - either via radio or directly from other first responders. \nNevertheless, many of these firefighters died, either because they delayed their evacuation to assist civilians, \nattempted to regroup their units, lacked urgency, or some combination of these factors. In addition, many other \nfirefighters not dispatched to the North Tower also died in its collapse. Some had their radios on the wrong channel. \nOthers were off-duty and lacked radios. In view of these\n\nconsiderations, we conclude that the technical failure of FDNY radios, while a contributing factor, was not the \nprimary cause of the many firefighter fatalities in the North Tower.  \n\nThe FDNY has worked hard in the past several years to address its radio deficiencies. To improve radio capability \nin high-rises, the FDNY has internally developed a \"post radio\" that is small enough for a battalion chief to carry to \nthe upper floors and that greatly repeats and enhances radio signal strength.  \n\nThe story with respect to Port Authority police officers in the North Tower is less complicated; most of them lacked \naccess to the radio channel on which the Port Authority police evacuation order was given. Since September 11, \nthe Port Authority has worked hard to integrate the radio systems of their different commands.\n\nThe lesson of 9/11 for civilians and first responders can be stated simply: in the new age of terror, they - we - are \nthe primary targets. The losses America suffered that day demonstrated both the gravity of the terrorist threat and \nthe commensurate need to prepare ourselves to meet it. The first responders of today live in a world transformed by \nthe attacks on 9/11. Because no one believes that every conceivable form of attack can be prevented, civilians and \nfirst responders will again find themselves on the front lines. We must plan for that eventuality. A rededication to \npreparedness is perhaps the best way to honor the memories of those we lost that day.\n\n10 WARTIME \n\nAfter the attacks had occurred, while crisis managers were still sorting out a number of unnerving false alarms, Air \nForce One flew to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. One of these alarms was of a reported threat against Air \nForce One itself, a threat eventually run down to a misunderstood communication in the hectic White House \nSituation Room that morning.  \n\n\n\nWhile the plan at the elementary school had been to return to Washington, by the time Air Force One was airborne \nat 9:55 A. M. the Secret Service, the President's advisers, and Vice President Cheney were strongly advising \nagainst it. President Bush reluctantly acceded to this advice and, at about 10:10, Air Force One changed course \nand began heading due west. The immediate objective was to find a safe location - not too far away - where the \nPresident could land and speak to the American people. The Secret Service was also interested in refueling the \naircraft and paring down the size of the traveling party. The President's military aide, an Air Force officer, quickly \nresearched the options and, sometime around 10:20, identified Barksdale Air Force Base as an appropriate interim \ndestination.  \n\nWhen Air Force One landed at Barksdale at about 11:45, personnel from the local Secret Service office were still en \nroute to the airfield. The motorcade consisted of a military police lead vehicle and a van; the proposed briefing \ntheater had no phones or electrical outlets. Staff scrambled to prepare another room for the President's remarks, \nwhile the lead Secret Service agent reviewed the security situation with superiors in Washington. The President \ncompleted his statement, which for security reasons was taped and not broadcast live, and the traveling party \nreturned to Air Force One. The next destination was discussed: once again the Secret Service recommended \nagainst returning to Washington, and the Vice President agreed. Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska was chosen \nbecause of its elaborate command and control facilities, and because it could accommodate overnight lodging for \n50 persons. The Secret Service wanted a place where the President could spend several days, if necessary.  \n\nAir Force One arrived at Offutt at 2:50 P. M. At about 3:15, President Bush met with his principal advisers through a \nsecure video teleconference.   Rice said President Bush began the meeting with the words, \"We're at war, \"   and \nthat Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet said the agency was still assessing who was responsible, but the \nearly signs all pointed to al Qaeda.   That evening the Deputies Committee returned to the pending presidential \ndirective they had labored over during the summer.  \n\nThe secretary of defense directed the nation's armed forces to Defense Condition 3, an increased state of military \nreadiness.   For the first time in history, all nonemergency civilian aircraft in the United States were grounded, \nstranding tens of thousands of passengers across the country. Contingency plans for the continuity of government \nand the evacuation of leaders had been implemented.   The Pentagon had been struck; the White House or the \nCapitol had narrowly escaped direct attack. Extraordinary security precautions were put in place at the nation's \nborders and ports.\n\nIn the late afternoon, the President overruled his aides' continuing reluctance to have him return to Washington and \nordered Air Force One back to Andrews Air Force Base. He was flown by helicopter back to the White House, \npassing over the still-smoldering Pentagon. At 8:30 that evening, President Bush addressed the nation from the \nWhite House. After emphasizing that the first priority was to help the injured and protect against any further attacks, \nhe said: \"We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them. \n\" He quoted Psalm 23 - \"though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death . . . \" No American, he said, \"will \never forget this day. \"  \n\nFollowing his speech, President Bush met again with his National Security Council (NSC), expanded to include \nSecretary of Transportation Norman Mineta and Joseph Allbaugh, the director of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency. Secretary of State Colin Powell, who had returned from Peru after hearing of the attacks, \njoined the discussion. They reviewed the day's events.  \n\n10. 1 IMMEDIATE RESPONSES AT HOME \n\nAs the urgent domestic issues accumulated, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten chaired a temporary \n\"domestic consequences\" group.   The agenda in those first days is worth noting, partly as a checklist for future \ncrisis planners. It began with problems of how to help victims and stanch the flowing losses to the American \neconomy, such as\n\n     *  Organizing federal emergency assistance. One question was what kind\n\n        of public health advice to give about the air quality in Lower\n\n        Manhattan in the vicinity of the fallen buildings.\n\n\n\n     *  Compensating victims. They evaluated legislative options,\n\n        eventually setting up a federal compensation fund and defining the\n\n        powers of a special master to run it.\n\n     *  Determining federal assistance. On September 13, President Bush\n\n        promised to provide $20 billion for New York City, in addition\n\n        to the $20 billion his budget director had already guessed\n\n        might be needed for the country as a whole.\n\n     *  Restoring civil aviation. On the morning of September 13, the\n\n        national airspace reopened for use by airports that met newly\n\n        improvised security standards.\n\n     *  Reopening the financial markets. After extraordinary emergency\n\n        efforts involving the White House, the Treasury Department, and the\n\n        Securities and Exchange Commission, aided by unprecedented\n\n        cooperation among the usually competitive firms of the financial\n\n        industry, the markets reopened on Monday, September 17.\n\n     *  Deciding when and how to return border and port security to more\n\n        normal operations.\n\n     *  Evaluating legislative proposals to bail out the airline industry\n\n        and cap its liability.\n\nThe very process of reviewing these issues underscored the absence of an effective government organization \ndedicated to assessing vulnerabilities and handling problems of protection and preparedness. Though a number of \nagencies had some part of the task, none had security as its primary mission.\n\nBy September 14, Vice President Cheney had decided to recommend, at least as a first step, a new White House \nentity to coordinate all the relevant agencies rather than tackle the challenge of combining them in a new \ndepartment. This new White House entity would be a homeland security adviser and Homeland Security Council - \nparalleling the National Security Council system. Vice President Cheney reviewed the proposal with President Bush \nand other advisers. President Bush announced the new post and its first occupant - Pennsylvania governor Tom \nRidge - in his address to a joint session of Congress on September 20.  \n\nBeginning on September 11, Immigration and Naturalization Service agents working in cooperation with the FBI \nbegan arresting individuals for immigration violations whom they encountered while following up leads in the FBI's \ninvestigation of the 9/11 attacks. Eventually, 768 aliens were arrested as \"special interest\" detainees. Some (such \nas Zacarias Moussaoui) were actually in INS custody before 9/11; most were arrested after. Attorney General John \nAshcroft told us that he saw his job in directing this effort as \"risk minimization, \" both to find out who had committed \nthe attacks and to prevent a subsequent attack. Ashcroft ordered all special interest immigration hearings closed to \nthe public, family members, and press; directed government attorneys\n\nto seek denial of bond until such time as they were \"cleared\" of terrorist connections by the FBI and other agencies; \nand ordered the identity of the detainees kept secret. INS attorneys charged with prosecuting the immigration \nviolations had trouble getting information about the detainees and any terrorist connections; in the chaos after the \nattacks, it was very difficult to reach law enforcement officials, who were following up on other leads. The clearance \nprocess approved by the Justice Department was time-consuming, lasting an average of about 80 days.  \n\nWe have assessed this effort to detain aliens of \"special interest. \" The detainees were lawfully held on immigration \ncharges. Records indicate that 531 were deported, 162 were released on bond, 24 received some kind of \n\n\n\nimmigration benefits, 12 had their proceedings terminated, and 8 - one of whom was Moussaoui - were remanded \nto the custody of the U. S. Marshals Service. The inspector general of the Justice Department found significant \nproblems in the way the 9/11 detainees were treated.   In response to a request about the counterterrorism benefits \nof the 9/11 detainee program, the Justice Department cited six individuals on the special interest detainee list, \nnoting that two (including Moussaoui) were linked directly to a terrorist organization and that it had obtained new \nleads helpful to the investigation of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.   A senior al Qaeda detainee has stated that U. S. \ngovernment efforts after the 9/11 attacks to monitor the American homeland, including review of Muslims' \nimmigration files and deportation of nonpermanent residents, forced al Qaeda to operate less freely in the United \nStates.  \n\nThe government's ability to collect intelligence inside the United States, and the sharing of such information \nbetween the intelligence and law enforcement communities, was not a priority before 9/11. Guidelines on this \nsubject issued in August 2001 by Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson essentially recapitulated prior \nguidance. However, the attacks of 9/11 changed everything. Less than one week after September 11, an early \nversion of what was to become the Patriot Act (officially, the USA PATRIOT Act) began to take shape.   A central \nprovision of the proposal was the removal of \"the wall\" on information sharing between the intelligence and law \nenforcement communities (discussed in chapter 3). Ashcroft told us he was determined to take every conceivable \naction, within the limits of the Constitution, to identify potential terrorists and deter additional attacks.   The \nadministration developed a proposal that eventually passed both houses of Congress by large majorities and was \nsigned into law on October 26.  \n\nSidebar 6: \n\n10. 2 PLANNING FOR WAR \n\nBy late in the evening of September 11, the President had addressed the nation on the terrible events of the day. \nVice President Cheney described the President's mood as somber.   The long day was not yet over. When the \nlarger meeting that included his domestic department heads broke up, President Bush chaired a smaller meeting of \ntop advisers, a group he would later call his \"war council. \"   This group usually included Vice President Cheney, \nSecretary of State Powell, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, General Hugh Shelton, Vice Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs (later to become chairman) General Myers, DCI Tenet, Attorney General Ashcroft, and FBI Director \nRobert Mueller. From the White House staff, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice and Chief of Staff Card \nwere part of the core group, often joined by their deputies, Stephen Hadley and Joshua Bolten.\n\nIn this restricted National Security Council meeting, the President said it was a time for self-defense. The United \nStates would punish not just the perpetrators of the attacks, but also those who harbored them. Secretary Powell \nsaid the United States had to make it clear to Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Arab states that the time to act was \nnow. He said we would need to build a coalition. The President noted that the attacks provided a great opportunity \nto engage Russia and China. Secretary Rumsfeld urged the President and the principals to think broadly about who \nmight have harbored the attackers, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Sudan, and Iran. He wondered aloud how \nmuch evidence the United States would need in order to deal with these countries, pointing out that major strikes \ncould take up to 60 days to assemble.  \n\nPresident Bush chaired two more meetings of the NSC on September 12. In the first meeting, he stressed that the \nUnited States was at war with a new and different kind of enemy. The President tasked principals to go beyond their \npre-9/11 work and develop a strategy to eliminate terrorists and punish those who support them. As they worked on \ndefining the goals and objectives of the upcoming campaign, they considered a paper that went beyond al Qaeda to\n\npropose the \"elimination of terrorism as a threat to our way of life, \" an aim that would include pursuing other \ninternational terrorist organizations in the Middle East.  \n\nRice chaired a Principals Committee meeting on September 13 in the Situation Room to refine how the fight against \nal Qaeda would be conducted. The principals agreed that the overall message should be that anyone supporting al \nQaeda would risk harm. The United States would need to integrate diplomacy, financial measures, intelligence, and \n\n\n\nmilitary actions into an overarching strategy. The principals also focused on Pakistan and what it could do to turn \nthe Taliban against al Qaeda. They concluded that if Pakistan decided not to help the United States, it too would be \nat risk.  \n\nThe same day, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage met with the Pakistani ambassador to the United \nStates, Maleeha Lodhi, and the visiting head of Pakistan's military intelligence service, Mahmud Ahmed. Armitage \nsaid that the United States wanted Pakistan to take seven steps:\n\n     *  to stop al Qaeda operatives at its border and end all logistical\n\n        support for Bin Ladin;\n\n     *  to give the United States blanket overflight and landing rights for\n\n        all necessary military and intelligence operations;\n\n     *  to provide territorial access to U. S. and allied military\n\n        intelligence and other personnel to conduct operations against al\n\n        Qaeda;\n\n     *  to provide the United States with intelligence information;\n\n     *  to continue to publicly condemn the terrorist acts;\n\n     *  to cut off all shipments of fuel to the Taliban and stop recruits\n\n        from going to Afghanistan; and,\n\n     *  if the evidence implicated bin Ladin and al Qaeda and the Taliban\n\n        continued to harbor them, to break relations with the Taliban\n\n        government.\n\nPakistan made its decision swiftly. That afternoon, Secretary of State Powell announced at the beginning of an NSC \nmeeting that Pakistani President Musharraf had agreed to every U. S. request for support in the war on terrorism. \nThe next day, the U. S. embassy in Islamabad confirmed that Musharraf and his top military commanders had \nagreed to all seven demands. \"Pakistan will need full US support as it proceeds with us, \" the embassy noted. \n\"Musharraf said the GOP [government of Pakistan] was making substantial concessions in allowing use of its \nterritory and that he would pay a domestic price. His standing in Pakistan was certain to suffer. To counterbalance \nthat he needed to show that Pakistan was benefiting from his decisions. \"  \n\nAt the September 13 NSC meeting, when Secretary Powell described Pakistan's reply, President Bush led a \ndiscussion of an appropriate ultimatum to the Taliban. He also ordered Secretary Rumsfeld to develop a military \nplan against\n\nthe Taliban. The President wanted the United States to strike the Taliban, step back, wait to see if they got the \nmessage, and hit them hard if they did not. He made clear that the military should focus on targets that would \ninfluence the Taliban's behavior.  \n\nPresident Bush also tasked the State Department, which on the following day delivered to the White House a paper \ntitled \"Game Plan for a Political- Military Strategy for Pakistan and Afghanistan. \"The paper took it as a given that \nBin Ladin would continue to act against the United States even while under Taliban control. It therefore detailed \nspecific U. S. demands for the Taliban: surrender Bin Ladin and his chief lieutenants, including Ayman al Zawahiri; \ntell the United States what the Taliban knew about al Qaeda and its operations; close all terrorist camps; free all \nimprisoned foreigners; and comply with all UN Security Council resolutions.  \n\nThe State Department proposed delivering an ultimatum to the Taliban: produce Bin Ladin and his deputies and \nshut down al Qaeda camps within 24 to 48 hours, or the United States will use all necessary means to destroy the \nterrorist infrastructure. The State Department did not expect the Taliban to comply. Therefore, State and Defense \nwould plan to build an international coalition to go into Afghanistan. Both departments would consult with NATO and \nother allies and request intelligence, basing, and other support from countries, according to their capabilities and \n\n\n\nresources. Finally, the plan detailed a public U. S. stance:America would use all its resources to eliminate terrorism \nas a threat, punish those responsible for the 9/11 attacks, hold states and other actors responsible for providing \nsanctuary to terrorists, work with a coalition to eliminate terrorist groups and networks, and avoid malice toward any \npeople, religion, or culture.  \n\nPresident Bush recalled that he quickly realized that the administration would have to invade Afghanistan with \nground troops.   But the early briefings to the President and Secretary Rumsfeld on military options were \ndisappointing.   Tommy Franks, the commanding general of Central Command (CENTCOM), told us that the \nPresident was dissatisfied. The U. S. military, Franks said, did not have an off-the-shelf plan to eliminate the al \nQaeda threat in Afghanistan. The existing Infinite Resolve options did not, in his view, amount to such a plan.  \n\nAll these diplomatic and military plans were reviewed over the weekend of September 15-16, as President Bush \nconvened his war council at Camp David.   Present were Vice President Cheney, Rice, Hadley, Powell, Armitage, \nRumsfeld, Ashcroft, Mueller, Tenet, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, and Cofer Black, chief of the \nDCI's Counterterrorist Center.\n\nTenet described a plan for collecting intelligence and mounting covert operations. He proposed inserting CIA teams \ninto Afghanistan to work with Afghan warlords who would join the fight against al Qaeda.   These CIA teams would \nact jointly with the military's Special Operations units. President Bush later praised this proposal, saying it had been \na turning point in his thinking.  \n\nGeneral Shelton briefed the principals on the preliminary plan for Afghanistan that the military had put together. It \ndrew on the Infinite Resolve \"phased campaign\" plan the Pentagon had begun developing in November 2000 as an \naddition to the strike options it had been refining since 1998. But Shelton added a new element - the possible \nsignificant use of ground forces - and that is where President Bush reportedly focused his attention.  \n\nAfter hearing from his senior advisers, President Bush discussed with Rice the contents of the directives he would \nissue to set all the plans into motion. Rice prepared a paper that President Bush then considered with principals on \nMonday morning, September 17. \"The purpose of this meeting, \" he recalled saying, \"is to assign tasks for the first \nwave of the war against terrorism. It starts today. \"  \n\nIn a written set of instructions slightly refined during the morning meeting, President Bush charged Ashcroft, \nMueller, and Tenet to develop a plan for homeland defense. President Bush directed Secretary of State Powell to \ndeliver an ultimatum to the Taliban along the lines that his department had originally proposed. The State \nDepartment was also tasked to develop a plan to stabilize Pakistan and to be prepared to notify Russia and \ncountries near Afghanistan when hostilities were imminent.  \n\nIn addition, Bush and his advisers discussed new legal authorities for covert action in Afghanistan, including the \nadministration's first Memorandum of Notification on Bin Ladin. Shortly thereafter, President Bush authorized broad \nnew authorities for the CIA.  \n\nPresident Bush instructed Rumsfeld and Shelton to develop further the Camp David military plan to attack the \nTaliban and al Qaeda if the Taliban rejected the ultimatum. The President also tasked Rumsfeld to ensure that \nrobust measures to protect American military forces against terrorist attack were implemented worldwide. Finally, \nhe directed Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill to craft a plan to target al Qaeda's funding and seize its assets.   NSC \nstaff members had begun leading meetings on terrorist fund-raising by September 18.  \n\nAlso by September 18, Powell had contacted 58 of his foreign counterparts and received offers of general aid, \nsearch-and-rescue equipment and personnel, and medical assistance teams.   On the same day, Deputy Secretary \nof State Armitage was called by Mahmud Ahmed regarding a two-day visit to Afghanistan during which the \nPakistani intelligence chief had met with Mullah Omar and conveyed the U. S. demands. Omar's response was \"not \nnegative on all these points. \"   But the administration knew that the Taliban was unlikely to turn over Bin Ladin.  \n\nThe pre-9/11 draft presidential directive on al Qaeda evolved into a new directive, National Security Presidential \nDirective 9, now titled \"Defeating the Terrorist Threat to the United States. \"The directive would now extend to a \nglobal war on terrorism, not just on al Qaeda. It also incorporated the President's determination not to distinguish \nbetween terrorists and those who harbor them. It included a determination to use military force if necessary to end\n\n\n\nal Qaeda's sanctuary in Afghanistan. The new directive - formally signed on October 25, after the fighting in \nAfghanistan had already begun - included new material followed by annexes discussing each targeted terrorist \ngroup. The old draft directive on al Qaeda became, in effect, the first annex.   The United States would strive to \neliminate all terrorist networks, dry up their financial support, and prevent them from acquiring weapons of mass \ndestruction. The goal was the \"elimination of terrorism as a threat to our way of life. \"  \n\n10. 3 \"PHASE TWO\"AND THE QUESTION OF IRAQ \n\nPresident Bush had wondered immediately after the attack whether Saddam Hussein's regime might have had a \nhand in it. Iraq had been an enemy of the United States for 11 years, and was the only place in the world where the \nUnited States was engaged in ongoing combat operations. As a former pilot, the President was struck by the \napparent sophistication of the operation and some of the piloting, especially Hanjour's high-speed dive into the \nPentagon. He told us he recalled Iraqi support for Palestinian suicide terrorists as well. Speculating about other \npossible states that could be involved, the President told us he also thought about Iran.  \n\nClarke has written that on the evening of September 12, President Bush told him and some of his staff to explore \npossible Iraqi links to 9/11. \"See if Saddam did this, \" Clarke recalls the President telling them. \"See if he's linked in \nany way. \"   While he believed the details of Clarke's account to be incorrect, President Bush acknowledged that he \nmight well have spoken to Clarke at some point, asking him about Iraq.  \n\nResponding to a presidential tasking, Clarke's office sent a memo to Rice on September 18, titled \"Survey of \nIntelligence Information on Any Iraq Involvement in the September 11 Attacks. \" Rice's chief staffer on Afghanistan, \nZalmay Khalilzad, concurred in its conclusion that only some anecdotal evidence linked Iraq to al Qaeda. The \nmemo found no \"compelling case\" that Iraq had either planned or perpetrated the attacks. It passed along a few \nforeign intelligence reports, including the Czech report alleging an April 2001 Prague meeting between Atta and an \nIraqi intelligence officer (discussed in chapter 7) and a Polish report that personnel at the headquarters of Iraqi \nintelligence in Baghdad were told before September 11 to go on the streets to gauge crowd reaction to an \nunspecified event. Arguing that the case for links between Iraq and al Qaeda was weak, the memo pointed out that \nBin Ladin resented the secularism of Saddam Hussein's regime. Finally, the memo said, there was no confirmed \nreporting on Saddam cooperating with Bin Ladin on unconventional weapons.  \n\nOn the afternoon of 9/11, according to contemporaneous notes, Secretary Rumsfeld instructed General Myers to \nobtain quickly as much information as\n\npossible. The notes indicate that he also told Myers that he was not simply interested in striking empty training \nsites. He thought the U. S. response should consider a wide range of options and possibilities. The secretary said \nhis instinct was to hit Saddam Hussein at the same time - not only Bin Ladin. Secretary Rumsfeld later explained \nthat at the time, he had been considering either one of them, or perhaps someone else, as the responsible party.  \n\nAccording to Rice, the issue of what, if anything, to do about Iraq was really engaged at Camp David. Briefing \npapers on Iraq, along with many others, were in briefing materials for the participants. Rice told us the \nadministration was concerned that Iraq would take advantage of the 9/11 attacks. She recalled that in the first \nCamp David session chaired by the President, Rumsfeld asked what the administration should do about Iraq. \nDeputy Secretary Wolfowitz made the case for striking Iraq during \"this round\" of the war on terrorism.  \n\nA Defense Department paper for the Camp David briefing book on the strategic concept for the war on terrorism \nspecified three priority targets for initial action: al Qaeda, the Taliban, and Iraq. It argued that of the three, al Qaeda \nand Iraq posed a strategic threat to the United States. Iraq's long-standing involvement in terrorism was cited, along \nwith its interest in weapons of mass destruction.  \n\nSecretary Powell recalled that Wolfowitz - not Rumsfeld - argued that Iraq was ultimately the source of the terrorist \nproblem and should therefore be attacked.   Powell said that Wolfowitz was not able to justify his belief that Iraq \nwas behind 9/11. \"Paul was always of the view that Iraq was a problem that had to be dealt with, \" Powell told us. \n\"And he saw this as one way of using this event as a way to deal with the Iraq problem. \" Powell said that President \nBush did not give Wolfowitz's argument \"much weight. \"   Though continuing to worry about Iraq in the following \nweek, Powell said, President Bush saw Afghanistan as the priority.  \n\n\n\nPresident Bush told Bob Woodward that the decision not to invade Iraq was made at the morning session on \nSeptember 15. Iraq was not even on the table during the September 15 afternoon session, which dealt solely with \nAfghanistan.   Rice said that when President Bush called her on Sunday, September 16, he said the focus would be \non Afghanistan, although he still wanted plans for Iraq should the country take some action or the administration \neventually determine that it had been involved in the 9/11 attacks.  \n\nAt the September 17 NSC meeting, there was some further discussion of \"phase two\" of the war on terrorism.   \nPresident Bush ordered the Defense Department to be ready to deal with Iraq if Baghdad acted against U. S. \ninterests, with plans to include possibly occupying Iraqi oil fields.  \n\nWithin the Pentagon, Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz continued to press the case for dealing with Iraq. Writing to \nRumsfeld on September 17 in a memo headlined \"Preventing More Events, \"he argued that if there was even a 10 \npercent chance that Saddam Hussein was behind the 9/11 attack, maximum pri-\n\nority should be placed on eliminating that threat. Wolfowitz contended that the odds were \"far more\" than 1 in 10, \nciting Saddam's praise for the attack, his long record of involvement in terrorism, and theories that Ramzi Yousef \nwas an Iraqi agent and Iraq was behind the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center.   The next day, Wolfowitz \nrenewed the argument, writing to Rumsfeld about the interest of Yousef 's co-conspirator in the 1995 Manila air plot \nin crashing an explosives-laden plane into CIA headquarters, and about information from a foreign government \nregarding Iraqis' involvement in the attempted hijacking of a Gulf Air flight. Given this background, he wondered \nwhy so little thought had been devoted to the danger of suicide pilots, seeing a \"failure of imagination\" and a mind-\nset that dismissed possibilities.  \n\nOn September 19, Rumsfeld offered several thoughts for his commanders as they worked on their contingency \nplans. Though he emphasized the worldwide nature of the conflict, the references to specific enemies or regions \nnamed only the Taliban, al Qaeda, and Afghanistan.   Shelton told us the administration reviewed all the Pentagon's \nwar plans and challenged certain assumptions underlying them, as any prudent organization or leader should do.  \n\nGeneral Tommy Franks, the commanding general of Central Command, recalled receiving Rumsfeld's guidance \nthat each regional commander should assess what these plans meant for his area of responsibility. He knew he \nwould soon be striking the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan. But, he told us, he now wondered how that action \nwas connected to what might need to be done in Somalia, Yemen, or Iraq.  \n\nOn September 20, President Bush met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and the two leaders discussed the \nglobal conflict ahead. When Blair asked about Iraq, the President replied that Iraq was not the immediate problem. \nSome members of his administration, he commented, had expressed a different view, but he was the one \nresponsible for making the decisions.  \n\nFranks told us that he was pushing independently to do more robust planning on military responses in Iraq during \nthe summer before 9/11 - a request President Bush denied, arguing that the time was not right. (CENTCOM also \nbegan dusting off plans for a full invasion of Iraq during this period, Franks said. ) The CENTCOM commander told \nus he renewed his appeal for further military planning to respond to Iraqi moves shortly after 9/11, both because he \npersonally felt that Iraq and al Qaeda might be engaged in some form of collusion and because he worried that \nSaddam might take advantage of the attacks to move against his internal enemies in the northern or southern parts \nof Iraq, where the United States was flying regular missions to enforce Iraqi no-fly zones. Franks said that President \nBush again turned down the request.  \n\nHaving issued directives to guide his administration's preparations for war, on Thursday, September 20, President \nBush addressed the nation before a joint session of Congress. \"Tonight, \" he said, \"we are a country awakened to\n\ndanger. \"   The President blamed al Qaeda for 9/11 and the 1998 embassy bombings and, for the first time, \ndeclared that al Qaeda was \"responsible for bombing the USS Cole . \"   He reiterated the ultimatum that had \nalready been conveyed privately. \"The Taliban must act, and act immediately, \" he said. \"They will hand over the \nterrorists, or they will share in their fate. \"   The President added that America's quarrel was not with Islam: \"The \nenemy of America is not our many Muslim friends; it is not our many Arab friends. Our enemy is a radical network \nof terrorists, and every government that supports them. \" Other regimes faced hard choices, he pointed out: \"Every \nnation, in every region, now has a decision to make: Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists. \"  \n\n\n\nPresident Bush argued that the new war went beyond Bin Ladin. \"Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it \ndoes not end there, \" he said. \"It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped, and \ndefeated. \"The President had a message for the Pentagon: \"The hour is coming when America will act, and you will \nmake us proud. \" He also had a message for those outside the United States. \"This is civilization's fight, \" he said. \n\"We ask every nation to join us. \"  \n\nPresident Bush approved military plans to attack Afghanistan in meetings with Central Command's General Franks \nand other advisers on September 21 and October 2. Originally titled \"Infinite Justice, \" the operation's code word \nwas changed - to avoid the sensibilities of Muslims who associate the power of infinite justice with God alone - to \nthe operational name still used for operations in Afghanistan:\"Enduring Freedom. \"  \n\nThe plan had four phases.\n\n     *  In Phase One, the United States and its allies would move\n\n        forces into the region and arrange to operate from or over\n\n        neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan and Pakistan. This\n\n        occurred in the weeks following 9/11, aided by overwhelming\n\n        international sympathy for the United States.\n\n     *  In Phase Two , air strikes and Special Operations attacks\n\n        would hit key al Qaeda and Taliban targets. In an innovative joint\n\n        effort, CIA and Special Operations forces would be deployed to work\n\n        together with each major Afghan faction opposed to the Taliban. The\n\n        Phase Two strikes and raids began on October 7. The basing\n\n        arrangements contemplated for Phase One were substantially secured\n\n        - after arduous effort - by the end of that month.\n\n     *  In Phase Three , the United States would carry out \"decisive\n\n        operations\" using all elements of national power, including ground\n\n        troops, to topple the Taliban regime and eliminate al Qaeda's\n\n        sanctuary in Afghanistan. Mazar-e-Sharif, in northern Afghanistan,\n\n        fell to a coalition assault by Afghan and U. S. forces on November\n\n        9. Four days later the Taliban had fled from Kabul. By early\n\n        December, all major cities\n\n     *  had fallen to the coalition. On December 22, Hamid Karzai, a\n\n        Pashtun leader from Kandahar, was installed as the chairman of\n\n        Afghanistan's interim administration. Afghanistan had been\n\n        liberated from the rule of the Taliban.\n\nIn December 2001, Afghan forces, with limited U. S. support, engaged al Qaeda elements in a cave complex called \nTora Bora. In March 2002, the largest engagement of the war was fought, in the mountainous Shah-i-Kot area \nsouth of Gardez, against a large force of al Qaeda jihadists. The three-week battle was substantially successful, \nand almost all remaining al Qaeda forces took refuge in Pakistan's equally mountainous and lightly governed \nfrontier provinces. As of July 2004, Bin Ladin and Zawahiri are still believed to be at large.\n\n     *  In Phase Four , civilian and military operations turned to the\n\n        indefinite task of what the armed forces call \"security and\n\n\n\n        stability operations. \"\n\nWithin about two months of the start of combat operations, several hundred CIA operatives and Special Forces \nsoldiers, backed by the striking power of U. S. aircraft and a much larger infrastructure of intelligence and support \nefforts, had combined with Afghan militias and a small number of other coalition soldiers to destroy the Taliban \nregime and disrupt al Qaeda. They had killed or captured about a quarter of the enemy's known leaders. \nMohammed Atef, al Qaeda's military commander and a principal figure in the 9/11 plot, had been killed by a U. S. \nair strike. According to a senior CIA officer who helped devise the overall strategy, the CIA provided intelligence, \nexperience, cash, covert action capabilities, and entree to tribal allies. In turn, the U. S. military offered combat \nexpertise, firepower, logistics, and communications.   With these initial victories won by the middle of 2002, the \nglobal conflict against Islamist terrorism became a different kind of struggle.\n\n11 FORESIGHT - AND HINDSIGHT \n\nIn composing this narrative, we have tried to remember that we write with the benefit and the handicap of hindsight. \nHindsight can sometimes see the past clearly - with 20/20 vision. But the path of what happened is so brightly lit \nthat it places everything else more deeply into shadow. Commenting on Pearl Harbor, Roberta Wohlstetter found it \n\"much easier after the event to sort the relevant from the irrelevant signals. After the event, of course, a signal is \nalways crystal clear; we can now see what disaster it was signaling since the disaster has occurred. But before the \nevent it is obscure and pregnant with conflicting meanings. \"  \n\nAs time passes, more documents become available, and the bare facts of what happened become still clearer. Yet \nthe picture of how those things happened becomes harder to reimagine, as that past world, with its preoccupations \nand uncertainty, recedes and the remaining memories of it become colored by what happened and what was \nwritten about it later. With that caution in mind, we asked ourselves, before we judged others, whether the insights \nthat seem apparent now would really have been meaningful at the time, given the limits of what people then could \nreasonably have known or done.\n\nWe believe the 9/11 attacks revealed four kinds of failures: in imagination, policy, capabilities, and management.\n\n11. 1 IMAGINATION \n\nHistorical Perspective \n\nThe 9/11 attack was an event of surpassing disproportion. America had suffered surprise attacks before - Pearl \nHarbor is one well-known case, the 1950 Chinese attack in Korea another. But these were attacks by major powers.\n\nWhile by no means as threatening as Japan's act of war, the 9/11 attack was in some ways more devastating. It \nwas carried out by a tiny group of people,\n\nnot enough to man a full platoon. Measured on a governmental scale, the resources behind it were trivial. The \ngroup itself was dispatched by an organization based in one of the poorest, most remote, and least industrialized \ncountries on earth. This organization recruited a mixture of young fanatics and highly educated zealots who could \nnot find suitable places in their home societies or were driven from them.\n\nTo understand these events, we attempted to reconstruct some of the context of the 1990s. Americans celebrated \nthe end of the Cold War with a mixture of relief and satisfaction. The people of the United States hoped to enjoy a \npeace dividend, as U. S. spending on national security was cut following the end of the Soviet military threat.\n\nThe United States emerged into the post-Cold War world as the globe's preeminent military power. But the vacuum \ncreated by the sudden demise of the Soviet Union created fresh sources of instability and new challenges for the \nUnited States. President George H. W. Bush dealt with the first of these in 1990 and 1991 when he led an \ninternational coalition to reverse Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Other examples of U. S. leaders' handling new threats \nincluded the removal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan; the Nunn-Lugar threat reduction \nprogram to help contain new nuclear dangers; and international involvement in the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo.\n\n\n\nAmerica stood out as an object for admiration, envy, and blame. This created a kind of cultural asymmetry. To us, \nAfghanistan seemed very far away. To members of al Qaeda, America seemed very close. In a sense, they were \nmore globalized than we were.\n\nUnderstanding the Danger \n\nIf the government's leaders understood the gravity of the threat they faced and understood at the same time that \ntheir policies to eliminate it were not likely to succeed any time soon, then history's judgment will be harsh. Did they \nunderstand the gravity of the threat?\n\nThe U. S. government responded vigorously when the attack was on our soil. Both Ramzi Yousef, who organized \nthe 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, and Mir Amal Kansi, who in 1993 killed two CIA employees as they \nwaited to go to work in Langley, Virginia, were the objects of relentless, uncompromising, and successful efforts to \nbring them back to the United States to stand trial for their crimes.\n\nBefore 9/11, al Qaeda and its affiliates had killed fewer than 50 Americans, including the East Africa embassy \nbombings and the Cole attack. The U. S. government took the threat seriously, but not in the sense of mustering \nanything like the kind of effort that would be gathered to confront an enemy of the first, second, or even third rank. \nThe modest national effort exerted to contain Serbia and its depredations in the Balkans between 1995 and 1999, \nfor example, was orders of magnitude larger than that devoted to al Qaeda.\n\nAs best we can determine, neither in 2000 nor in the first eight months of 2001 did any polling organization in the \nUnited States think the subject of terrorism sufficiently on the minds of the public to warrant asking a question about \nit in a major national survey. Bin Ladin, al Qaeda, or even terrorism was not an important topic in the 2000 \npresidential campaign. Congress and the media called little attention to it.\n\nIf a president wanted to rally the American people to a warlike effort, he would need to publicize an assessment of \nthe growing al Qaeda danger. Our government could spark a full public discussion of who Usama Bin Ladin was, \nwhat kind of organization he led, what Bin Ladin or al Qaeda intended, what past attacks they had sponsored or \nencouraged, and what capabilities they were bringing together for future assaults. We believe American and \ninternational public opinion might have been different--and so might the range of options for a president--had they \nbeen informed of these details. Recent examples of such debates include calls to arms against such threats as \nSerbian ethnic cleansing, biological attacks, Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, global climate change, and the \nHIV/AIDS epidemic.\n\nWhile we now know that al Qaeda was formed in 1988, at the end of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the \nintelligence community did not describe this organization, at least in documents we have seen, until 1999. A \nNational Intelligence Estimate distributed in July 1995 predicted future terrorist attacks against the United States - \nand in the United States. It warned that this danger would increase over the next several years. It specified as \nparticular points of vulnerability the White House, the Capitol, symbols of capitalism such as Wall Street, critical \ninfrastructure such as power grids, areas where people congregate such as sports arenas, and civil aviation \ngenerally. It warned that the 1993 World Trade Center bombing had been intended to kill a lot of people, not to \nachieve any more traditional political goal.\n\nThis 1995 estimate described the greatest danger as \"transient groupings of individuals\" that lacked \"strong \norganization but rather are loose affiliations. \" They operate \"outside traditional circles but have access to a \nworldwide network of training facilities and safehavens. \"   This was an excellent summary of the emerging danger, \nbased on what was then known.\n\nIn 1996-1997, the intelligence community received new information making clear that Bin Ladin headed his own \nterrorist group, with its own targeting agenda and operational commanders. Also revealed was the previously \nunknown involvement of Bin Ladin's organization in the 1992 attack on a Yemeni hotel quartering U. S. military \npersonnel, the 1993 shootdown of U. S. Army Black Hawk helicopters in Somalia, and quite possibly the 1995 \nRiyadh bombing of the American training mission to the Saudi National Guard.\n\nThe 1997 update of the 1995 estimate did not discuss the new intelligence. It did state that the terrorist danger \ndepicted in 1995 would persist. In the update's summary of key points, the only reference to Bin Ladin was this sen-\n\n\n\ntence:\"Iran and its surrogates, as well as terrorist financier Usama Bin Ladin and his followers, have stepped up \ntheir threats and surveillance of US facilities abroad in what also may be a portent of possible additional attacks in \nthe United States. \"   Bin Ladin was mentioned in only two other sentences in the six-page report. The al Qaeda \norganization was not mentioned. The 1997 update was the last national estimate on the terrorism danger completed \nbefore 9/11.  \n\nFrom 1998 to 2001, a number of very good analytical papers were distributed on specific topics. These included Bin \nLadin's political philosophy, his command of a global network, analysis of information from terrorists captured in \nJordan in December 1999, al Qaeda's operational style, and the evolving goals of the Islamist extremist movement. \nMany classified articles for morning briefings were prepared for the highest officials in the government with titles \nsuch as \"Bin Ladin Threatening to Attack US Aircraft [with antiaircraft missiles]\" (June 1998), \"Strains Surface \nBetween Taliban and Bin Ladin\" (January 1999), \"Terrorist Threat to US Interests in Caucasus\" (June 1999), \"Bin \nLadin to Exploit Looser Security During Holidays\"(December 1999), \"Bin Ladin Evading Sanctions\" (March 2000), \n\"Bin Ladin's Interest in Biological, Radiological Weapons\" (February 2001), \"Taliban Holding Firm on Bin Ladin for \nNow\" (March 2001), \"Terrorist Groups Said Cooperating on US Hostage Plot\"(May 2001), and \"Bin Ladin \nDetermined to Strike in the US\" (August 2001).  \n\nDespite such reports and a 1999 paper on Bin Ladin's command structure for al Qaeda, there were no complete \nportraits of his strategy or of the extent of his organization's involvement in past terrorist attacks. Nor had the \nintelligence community provided an authoritative depiction of his organization's relationships with other \ngovernments, or the scale of the threat his organization posed to the United States.\n\nThough Deputy DCI John McLaughlin said to us that the cumulative output of the Counterterrorist Center (CTC) \n\"dramatically eclipsed\" any analysis that could have appeared in a fresh National Intelligence Estimate, he \nconceded that most of the work of the Center's 30- to 40-person analytic group dealt with collection issues.   In late \n2000, DCI George Tenet recognized the deficiency of strategic analysis against al Qaeda. To tackle the problem \nwithin the CTC he appointed a senior manager, who briefed him in March 2001 on \"creating a strategic assessment \ncapability. \"The CTC established a new strategic assessments branch during July 2001. The decision to add about \nten analysts to this effort was seen as a major bureaucratic victory, but the CTC labored to find them. The new chief \nof this branch reported for duty on September 10, 2001.  \n\nWhatever the weaknesses in the CIA's portraiture, both Presidents Bill Clinton and George Bush and their top \nadvisers told us they got the picture - they understood Bin Ladin was a danger. But given the character and pace of \ntheir policy efforts, we do not believe they fully understood just how many people\n\nal Qaeda might kill, and how soon it might do it. At some level that is hard to define, we believe the threat had not \nyet become compelling.\n\nexample, a New York Times article in April 1999 sought to debunk claims that Bin Ladin was a terrorist leader, with \nthe headline \"U. S. Hard Put to Find Proof Bin Laden Directed Attacks. \"   The head of analysis at the CTC until \n1999 discounted the alarms about a catastrophic threat as relating only to the danger of chemical, biological, or \nnuclear attack - and he downplayed even that, writing several months before 9/11:\"It would be a mistake to redefine \ncounterterrorism as a task of dealing with 'catastrophic, ''grand, ' or 'super' terrorism, when in fact these labels do \nnot represent most of the terrorism that the United States is likely to face or most of the costs that terrorism imposes \non U. S. interests. \"  \n\nBeneath the acknowledgment that Bin Ladin and al Qaeda presented serious dangers, there was uncertainty \namong senior officials about whether this was just a new and especially venomous version of the ordinary terrorist \nthreat America had lived with for decades, or was radically new, posing a threat beyond any yet experienced. Such \ndifferences affect calculations about whether or how to go to war.\n\nTherefore, those government experts who saw Bin Ladin as an unprecedented new danger needed a way to win \nbroad support for their views, or at least spotlight the areas of dispute, and perhaps prompt action across the \ngovernment. The national estimate has often played this role, and is sometimes controversial for this very reason.   \nSuch assessments, which provoke widespread thought and debate, have a major impact on their recipients, often in \na wider circle of decisionmakers. The National Intelligence Estimate is noticed in the Congress, for example. But, as \nwe have said, none was produced on terrorism between 1997 and 9/11.\n\n\n\nBy 2001 the government still needed a decision at the highest level as to whether al Qaeda was or was not \"a first \norder threat, \" Richard Clarke wrote in his first memo to Condoleezza Rice on January 25, 2001. In his blistering \nprotest about foot-dragging in the Pentagon and at the CIA, sent to Rice just a week before 9/11, he repeated that \nthe \"real question\" for the principals was \"are we serious about dealing with the al Qida threat? . . . Is al Qida a big \ndeal? \"\n\nOne school of thought, Clarke wrote in this September 4 note, implicitly argued that the terrorist network was a \nnuisance that killed a score of Americans every 18-24 months. If that view was credited, then current policies might \nbe proportionate. Another school saw al Qaeda as the \"point of the spear of radical Islam. \" But no one forced the \nargument into the open by calling for a national estimate or a broader discussion of the threat. The issue was never \njoined as a collective debate by the U. S. government, including the Congress, before 9/11.\n\nWe return to the issue of proportion - and imagination. Even Clarke's note\n\nchallenging Rice to imagine the day after an attack posits a strike that kills \"hundreds\" of Americans. He did not \nwrite \"thousands. \"\n\nInstitutionalizing Imagination:  The Case of Aircraft as Weapons \n\nImagination is not a gift usually associated with bureaucracies. For example, before Pearl Harbor the U. S. \ngovernment had excellent intelligence that a Japanese attack was coming, especially after peace talks stalemated \nat the end of November 1941. These were days, one historian notes, of \"excruciating uncertainty. \"The most likely \ntargets were judged to be in Southeast Asia. An attack was coming, \"but officials were at a loss to know where the \nblow would fall or what more might be done to prevent it. \"   In retrospect, available intercepts pointed to Japanese \nexamination of Hawaii as a possible target. But, another historian observes, \"in the face of a clear warning, alert \nmeasures bowed to routine. \"  \n\nIt is therefore crucial to find a way of routinizing, even bureaucratizing, the exercise of imagination. Doing so \nrequires more than finding an expert who can imagine that aircraft could be used as weapons. Indeed, since al \nQaeda and other groups had already used suicide vehicles, namely truck bombs, the leap to the use of other \nvehicles such as boats (the Cole attack) or planes is not far-fetched.\n\nYet these scenarios were slow to work their way into the thinking of aviation security experts. In 1996, as a result of \nthe TWA Flight 800 crash, President Clinton created a commission under Vice President Al Gore to report on \nshortcomings in aviation security in the United States. The Gore Commission's report, having thoroughly canvassed \navailable expertise in and outside of government, did not mention suicide hijackings or the use of aircraft as \nweapons. It focused mainly on the danger of placing bombs onto aircraft - the approach of the Manila air plot. The \nGore Commission did call attention, however, to lax screening of passengers and what they carried onto planes.\n\nIn late 1998, reports came in of a possible al Qaeda plan to hijack a plane. One, a December 4 Presidential Daily \nBriefing for President Clinton (reprinted in chapter 4), brought the focus back to more traditional hostage taking; it \nreported Bin Ladin's involvement in planning a hijack operation to free prisoners such as the \"Blind Sheikh, \" Omar \nAbdel Rahman. Had the contents of this PDB been brought to the attention of a wider group, including key \nmembers of Congress, it might have brought much more attention to the need for permanent changes in domestic \nairport and airline security procedures.  \n\nWorld Trade Center. In neither case could the information be corroborated. In addition, an Algerian group hijacked \nan airliner in 1994, most likely intending to blow it up over Paris, but possibly to crash it into the Eiffel Tower.  \n\nIn 1994, a private airplane had crashed onto the south lawn of the White House. In early 1995, Abdul Hakim Murad \n- Ramzi Yousef 's accomplice in the Manila airlines bombing plot - told Philippine authorities that he and Yousef had \ndiscussed flying a plane into CIA headquarters.  \n\nClarke had been concerned about the danger posed by aircraft since at least the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. There he \nhad tried to create an air defense plan using assets from the Treasury Department, after the Defense Department \ndeclined to contribute resources. The Secret Service continued to work on the problem of airborne threats to the \nWashington region. In 1998, Clarke chaired an exercise designed to highlight the inadequacy of the solution. This \n\n\n\npaper exercise involved a scenario in which a group of terrorists commandeered a Learjet on the ground in Atlanta, \nloaded it with explosives, and flew it toward a target in Washington, D. C. Clarke asked officials from the Pentagon, \nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA), and Secret Service what they could do about the situation. Officials from the \nPentagon said they could scramble aircraft from Langley Air Force Base, but they would need to go to the President \nfor rules of engagement, and there was no mechanism to do so. There was no clear resolution of the problem at the \nexercise.  \n\nIn late 1999, a great deal of discussion took place in the media about the crash off the coast of Massachusetts of \nEgyptAir Flight 990, a Boeing 767. The most plausible explanation that emerged was that one of the pilots had gone \nberserk, seized the controls, and flown the aircraft into the sea. After the 1999-2000 millennium alerts, when the \nnation had relaxed, Clarke held a meeting of his Counterterrorism Security Group devoted largely to the possibility \nof a possible airplane hijacking by al Qaeda.  \n\nIn his testimony, Clarke commented that he thought that warning about the possibility of a suicide hijacking would \nhave been just one more speculative theory among many, hard to spot since the volume of warnings of \"al Qaeda \nthreats and other terrorist threats, was in the tens of thousands - probably hundreds of thousands. \"   Yet the \npossibility was imaginable, and imagined. In early August 1999, the FAA's Civil Aviation Security intelligence office \nsummarized the Bin Ladin hijacking threat. After a solid recitation of all the information available on this topic, the \npaper identified a few principal scenarios, one of which was a \"suicide hijacking operation. \"The FAA analysts \njudged such an operation unlikely, because \"it does not offer an opportunity for dialogue to achieve the key goal of \nobtaining Rahman and other key captive extremists. . . . A suicide hijacking is assessed to be an option of last \nresort. \"  \n\nAnalysts could have shed some light on what kind of \"opportunity for dialogue\" al Qaeda desired.   The CIA did not \nwrite any analytical assessments of possible hijacking scenarios.\n\nOne prescient pre-9/11 analysis of an aircraft plot was written by a Justice Department trial attorney. The attorney \nhad taken an interest, apparently on his own initiative, in the legal issues that would be involved in shooting down a \nU. S. aircraft in such a situation.  \n\nThe North American Aerospace Defense Command imagined the possible use of aircraft as weapons, too, and \ndeveloped exercises to counter such a threat - from planes coming to the United States from overseas, perhaps \ncarrying a weapon of mass destruction. None of this speculation was based on actual intelligence of such a threat. \nOne idea, intended to test command and control plans and NORAD's readiness, postulated a hijacked airliner \ncoming from overseas and crashing into the Pentagon. The idea was put aside in the early planning of the exercise \nas too much of a distraction from the main focus (war in Korea), and as too unrealistic. As we pointed out in chapter \n1, the military planners assumed that since such aircraft would be coming from overseas; they would have time to \nidentify the target and scramble interceptors.  \n\nWe can therefore establish that at least some government agencies were concerned about the hijacking danger \nand had speculated about various scenarios. The challenge was to flesh out and test those scenarios, then figure \nout a way to turn a scenario into constructive action.\n\nSince the Pearl Harbor attack of 1941, the intelligence community has devoted generations of effort to \nunderstanding the problem of forestalling a surprise attack. Rigorous analytic methods were developed, focused in \nparticular on the Soviet Union, and several leading practitioners within the intelligence community discussed them \nwith us. These methods have been articulated in many ways, but almost all seem to have at least four elements in \ncommon: (1) think about how surprise attacks might be launched; (2) identify telltale indicators connected to the \nmost dangerous possibilities; (3) where feasible, collect intelligence on these indicators; and (4) adopt defenses to \ndeflect the most dangerous possibilities or at least trigger an earlier warning.\n\nAfter the end of the Gulf War, concerns about lack of warning led to a major study conducted for DCI Robert Gates \nin 1992 that proposed several recommendations, among them strengthening the national intelligence officer for \nwarning. We were told that these measures languished under Gates's successors. Responsibility for warning \nrelated to a terrorist attack passed from the national intelligence officer for warning to the CTC. An Intelligence \nCommunity Counterterrorism Board had the responsibility to issue threat advisories.  \n\n\n\nWith the important exception of analysis of al Qaeda efforts in chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear \nweapons, we did not find evidence that the methods to avoid surprise attack that had been so laboriously \ndeveloped over the years were regularly applied.\n\nConsidering what was not done suggests possible ways to institutionalize imagination. To return to the four \nelements of analysis just mentioned:\n\n1. The CTC did not analyze how an aircraft, hijacked or explosivesladen, might be used as a weapon. It did not \nperform this kind of analysis from the enemy's perspective (\"red team\" analysis), even though suicide terrorism had \nbecome a principal tactic of Middle Eastern terrorists. If it had done so, we believe such an analysis would soon \nhave spotlighted a critical constraint for the terrorists - finding a suicide operative able to fly large jet aircraft. They \nhad never done so before 9/11.\n\n2. The CTC did not develop a set of telltale indicators for this method of attack. For example, one such indicator \nmight be the discovery of possible terrorists pursuing flight training to fly large jet aircraft, or seeking to buy \nadvanced flight simulators.\n\n3. The CTC did not propose, and the intelligence community collection management process did not set, \nrequirements to monitor such telltale indicators. Therefore the warning system was not looking for information such \nas the July 2001 FBI report of potential terrorist interest in various kinds of aircraft training in Arizona, or the August \n2001 arrest of Zacarias Moussaoui because of his suspicious behavior in a Minnesota flight school. In late August, \nthe Moussaoui arrest was briefed to the DCI and other top CIA officials under the heading \"Islamic Extremist Learns \nto Fly. \"   Because the system was not tuned to comprehend the potential significance of this information, the news \nhad no effect on warning.\n\n4. Neither the intelligence community nor aviation security experts analyzed systemic defenses within an aircraft or \nagainst terroristcontrolled aircraft, suicidal or otherwise. The many threat reports mentioning aircraft were passed to \nthe FAA. While that agency continued to react to specific, credible threats, it did not try to perform the broader \nwarning functions we describe here. No one in the government was taking on that role for domestic vulnerabilities. \nRichard Clarke told us that he was concerned about the danger posed by aircraft in the context of protecting the \nAtlanta Olympics of 1996, the White House complex, and the 2001 G-8 summit in Genoa. But he attributed his \nawareness more to Tom Clancy novels than to warnings from the intelligence community. He did not, or could not, \npress the government to work on the systemic issues of how to strengthen the layered security defenses to protect \naircraft against hijackings or put the adequacy of air defenses against suicide hijackers on the national policy \nagenda.\n\nThe methods for detecting and then warning of surprise attack that the U. S. government had so painstakingly \ndeveloped in the decades after Pearl Harbor\n\ndid not fail; instead, they were not really tried. They were not employed to analyze the enemy that, as the twentieth \ncentury closed, was most likely to launch a surprise attack directly against the United States.\n\n11. 2 POLICY \n\nThe road to 9/11 again illustrates how the large, unwieldy U. S. government tended to underestimate a threat that \ngrew ever greater. The terrorism fostered by Bin Ladin and al Qaeda was different from anything the government \nhad faced before. The existing mechanisms for handling terrorist acts had been trial and punishment for acts \ncommitted by individuals; sanction, reprisal, deterrence, or war for acts by hostile governments. The actions of al \nQaeda fit neither category. Its crimes were on a scale approaching acts of war, but they were committed by a loose, \nfar-flung, nebulous conspiracy with no territories or citizens or assets that could be readily threatened, \noverwhelmed, or destroyed.\n\nEarly in 2001, DCI Tenet and Deputy Director for Operations James Pavitt gave an intelligence briefing to \nPresident-elect Bush, Vice President-elect Cheney, and Rice; it included the topic of al Qaeda. Pavitt recalled \nconveying that Bin Ladin was one of the gravest threats to the country.  \n\n\n\nBush asked whether killing Bin Ladin would end the problem. Pavitt said he and the DCI had answered that killing \nBin Ladin would have an impact, but would not stop the threat. The CIA later provided more formal assessments to \nthe White House reiterating that conclusion. It added that in the long term, the only way to deal with the threat was \nto end al Qaeda's ability to use Afghanistan as a sanctuary for its operations.  \n\nPerhaps the most incisive of the advisors on terrorism to the new administration was the holdover Richard Clarke. \nYet he admits that his policy advice, even if it had been accepted immediately and turned into action, would not \nhave prevented 9/11.  \n\nWe must then ask when the U. S. government had reasonable opportunities to mobilize the country for major action \nagainst al Qaeda and its Afghan sanctuary. The main opportunities came after the new information the U. S. \ngovernment received in 1996-1997, after the embassy bombings of August 1998, after the discoveries of the \nJordanian and Ressam plots in late 1999, and after the attack on the USS Cole in October 2000.\n\nThe U. S. policy response to al Qaeda before 9/11 was essentially defined following the embassy bombings of \nAugust 1998. We described those decisions in chapter 4. It is worth noting that they were made by the Clinton \nadministration under extremely difficult domestic political circumstances. Opponents were seeking the President's \nimpeachment. In addition, in 1998-99 President Clinton was preparing the government for possible war against \nSerbia, and he\n\nhad authorized major air strikes against Iraq.\n\nThe tragedy of the embassy bombings provided an opportunity for a full examination, across the government, of the \nnational security threat that Bin Ladin posed. Such an examination could have made clear to all that issues were at \nstake that were much larger than the domestic politics of the moment. But the major policy agencies of the \ngovernment did not meet the threat.\n\nThe diplomatic efforts of the Department of State were largely ineffective. Al Qaeda and terrorism was just one \nmore priority added to already-crowded agendas with countries like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. After 9/11 that \nchanged.\n\nPolicymakers turned principally to the CIA and covert action to implement policy. Before 9/11, no agency had more \nresponsibility - or did more - to attack al Qaeda, working day and night, than the CIA. But there were limits to what \nthe CIA was able to achieve in its energetic worldwide efforts to disrupt terrorist activities or use proxies to try to \ncapture or kill Bin Ladin and his lieutenants. As early as mid-1997, one CIA officer wrote to his supervisor: \"All we're \ndoing is holding the ring until the cavalry gets here. \"  \n\nMilitary measures failed or were not applied. Before 9/11 the Department of Defense was not given the mission of \nending al Qaeda's sanctuary in Afghanistan.\n\nOfficials in both the Clinton and Bush administrations regarded a full U. S. invasion of Afghanistan as practically \ninconceivable before 9/11. It was never the subject of formal interagency deliberation.\n\nLesser forms of intervention could also have been considered. One would have been the deployment of U. S. \nmilitary or intelligence personnel, or special strike forces, to Afghanistan itself or nearby - openly, clandestinely \n(secretly), or covertly (with their connection to the United States hidden). Then the United States would no longer \nhave been dependent on proxies to gather actionable intelligence. However, it would have needed to secure basing \nand overflight support from neighboring countries. A significant political, military, and intelligence effort would have \nbeen required, extending over months and perhaps years, with associated costs and risks. Given how hard it has \nproved to locate Bin Ladin even today when there are substantial ground forces in Afghanistan, its odds of sucess \nare hard to calculate. We have found no indication that President Clinton was offered such an intermediate choice, \nor that this option was given any more consideration than the idea of invasion.\n\nThese policy challenges are linked to the problem of imagination we have already discussed. Since we believe that \nboth President Clinton and President Bush were genuinely concerned about the danger posed by al Qaeda, \napproaches involving more direct intervention against the sanctuary in Afghanistan apparently must have seemed - \nif they were considered at all - to be disproportionate to the threat.\n\n\n\nInsight for the future is thus not easy to apply in practice. It is hardest to mount a major effort while a problem still \nseems minor. Once the danger has fully materialized, evident to all, mobilizing action is easier - but it then may be \ntoo late.\n\nAnother possibility, short of putting U. S. personnel on the ground, was to issue a blunt ultimatum to the Taliban, \nbacked by a readiness to at least launch an indefinite air campaign to disable that regime's limited military \ncapabilities and tip the balance in Afghanistan's ongoing civil war. The United States had warned the Taliban that \nthey would be held accountable for further attacks by Bin Ladin against Afghanistan's U. S. interests. The warning \nhad been given in 1998, again in late 1999, once more in the fall of 2000, and again in the summer of 2001. \nDelivering it repeatedly did not make it more effective.\n\nAs evidence of al Qaeda's responsibility for the Cole attack came in during November 2000, National Security \nAdvisor Samuel Berger asked the Pentagon to develop a plan for a sustained air campaign against the Taliban. \nClarke developed a paper laying out a formal, specific ultimatum. But Clarke's plan apparently did not advance to \nformal consideration by the Small Group of principals. We have found no indication that the idea was briefed to the \nnew administration or that Clarke passed his paper to them, although the same team of career officials spanned \nboth administrations.\n\nAfter 9/11, President Bush announced that al Qaeda was responsible for the attack on the USS Cole . Before 9/11, \nneither president took any action. Bin Ladin's inference may well have been that attacks, at least at the level of the \nCole , were risk free.  \n\n11. 3 CAPABILITIES \n\nEarlier chapters describe in detail the actions decided on by the Clinton and Bush administrations. Each president \nconsidered or authorized covert actions, a process that consumed considerable time - especially in the Clinton \nadministration - and achieved little success beyond the collection of intelligence. After the August 1998 missile \nstrikes in Afghanistan, naval vessels remained on station in or near the region, prepared to fire cruise missiles. \nGeneral Hugh Shelton developed as many as 13 different strike options, and did not recommend any of them. The \nmost extended debate on counterterrorism in the Bush administration before 9/11 had to do with missions for the \nunmanned Predator - whether to use it just to locate Bin Ladin or to wait until it was armed with a missile, so that it \ncould find him and also attack him. Looking back, we are struck with the narrow and unimaginative menu of options \nfor action offered to both President Clinton and President Bush.\n\nBefore 9/11, the United States tried to solve the al Qaeda problem with the\n\nsame government institutions and capabilities it had used in the last stages of the Cold War and its immediate \naftermath. These capabilities were insufficient, but little was done to expand or reform them.\n\nFor covert action, of course, the White House depended on the Counterterrorist Center and the CIA's Directorate of \nOperations. Though some officers, particularly in the Bin Ladin unit, were eager for the mission, most were not. The \nhigher management of the directorate was unenthusiastic. The CIA's capacity to conduct paramilitary operations \nwith its own personnel was not large, and the Agency did not seek a large-scale general expansion of these \ncapabilities before 9/11. James Pavitt, the head of this directorate, remembered that covert action, promoted by the \nWhite House, had gotten the Clandestine Service into trouble in the past. He had no desire to see this happen \nagain. He thought, not unreasonably, that a truly serious counterterrorism campaign against an enemy of this \nmagnitude would be business primarily for the military, not the Clandestine Service.  \n\nAs for the Department of Defense, some officers in the Joint Staff were keen to help. Some in the Special \nOperations Command have told us that they worked on plans for using Special Operations Forces in Afghanistan \nand that they hoped for action orders. JCS Chairman General Shelton and General Anthony Zinni at Central \nCommand had a different view. Shelton felt that the August 1998 attacks had proved a waste of good ordnance and \nthereafter consistently opposed firing expensive Tomahawk missiles merely at \"jungle gym\" terrorist training \ninfrastructure.   In this view, he had complete support from Defense Secretary William Cohen. Shelton was \nprepared to plan other options, but he was also prepared to make perfectly clear his own strong doubts about the \nwisdom of any military action that risked U. S. lives unless the intelligence was \"actionable. \"  \n\n\n\nThe high price of keeping counterterrorism policy within the restricted circle of the Counterterrorism Security Group \nand the highest-level principals was nowhere more apparent than in the military establishment. After the August \n1998 missile strike, other members of the JCS let the press know their unhappiness that, in conformity with the \nGoldwater-Nichols reforms, Shelton had been the only member of the JCS to be consulted. Although follow-on \nmilitary options were briefed more widely, the vice director of operations on the Joint Staff commented to us that \nintelligence and planning documents relating to al Qaeda arrived in a ziplock red package and that many flag and \ngeneral officers never had the clearances to see its contents.  \n\nAt no point before 9/11 was the Department of Defense fully engaged in the mission of countering al Qaeda, though \nthis was perhaps the most dangerous foreign enemy then threatening the United States. The Clinton administration \neffectively relied on the CIA to take the lead in preparing long-term offensive plans against an enemy sanctuary. \nThe Bush administration adopted this approach, although its emerging new strategy envisioned some yet unde-\n\nfined further role for the military in addressing the problem. Within Defense, both Secretary Cohen and Secretary \nDonald Rumsfeld gave their principal attention to other challenges.\n\nAmerica's homeland defenders faced outward. NORAD itself was barely able to retain any alert bases. Its planning \nscenarios occasionally considered the danger of hijacked aircraft being guided to American targets, but only aircraft \nthat were coming from overseas. We recognize that a costly change in NORAD's defense posture to deal with the \ndanger of suicide hijackers, before such a threat had ever actually been realized, would have been a tough sell. But \nNORAD did not canvass available intelligence and try to make the case.\n\nThe most serious weaknesses in agency capabilities were in the domestic arena. In chapter 3 we discussed these \ninstitutions - the FBI, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the FAA, and others. The major pre-9/11 effort to \nstrengthen domestic agency capabilities came in 2000, as part of a millennium after-action review. President \nClinton and his principal advisers paid considerable attention then to border security problems, but were not able to \nbring about significant improvements before leaving office. The NSC-led interagency process did not effectively \nbring along the leadership of the Justice and Transportation departments in an agenda for institutional change.\n\nThe FBI did not have the capability to link the collective knowledge of agents in the field to national priorities. The \nacting director of the FBI did not learn of his Bureau's hunt for two possible al Qaeda operatives in the United \nStates or about his Bureau's arrest of an Islamic extremist taking flight training until September 11. The director of \ncentral intelligence knew about the FBI's Moussaoui investigation weeks before word of it made its way even to the \nFBI's own assistant director for counterterrorism.\n\nOther agencies deferred to the FBI. In the August 6 PDB reporting to President Bush of 70 full-field investigations \nrelated to al Qaeda, news the President said he found heartening, the CIA had simply restated what the FBI had \nsaid. No one looked behind the curtain.\n\nThe FAA's capabilities to take aggressive, anticipatory security measures were especially weak. Any serious policy \nexamination of a suicide hijacking scenario, critiquing each of the layers of the security system, could have \nsuggested changes to fix glaring vulnerabilities - expanding no-fly lists, searching passengers identified by the \nCAPPS screening system, deploying Federal Air Marshals domestically, hardening cockpit doors, alerting air crew \nto a different kind of hijacking than what they had been trained to expect, or adjusting the training of controllers and \nmanagers in the FAA and NORAD.\n\nGovernment agencies also sometimes display a tendency to match capabilities to mission by defining away the \nhardest part of their job. They are often passive, accepting what are viewed as givens, including that efforts to \nidentify and fix glaring vulnerabilities to dangerous threats would be too costly, too controversial, or too disruptive.\n\n11. 4 MANAGEMENT \n\nOperational Management \n\nEarlier in this report we detailed various missed opportunities to thwart the 9/11 plot. Information was not shared, \nsometimes inadvertently or because of legal misunderstandings. Analysis was not pooled. Effective operations \n\n\n\nwere not launched. Often the handoffs of information were lost across the divide separating the foreign and \ndomestic agencies of the government.\n\nHowever the specific problems are labeled, we believe they are symptoms of the government's broader inability to \nadapt how it manages problems to the new challenges of the twenty-first century. The agencies are like a set of \nspecialists in a hospital, each ordering tests, looking for symptoms, and prescribing medications. What is missing is \nthe attending physician who makes sure they work as a team.\n\nOne missing element was effective management of transnational operations. Action officers should have drawn on \nall available knowledge in the government. This management should have ensured that information was shared and \nduties were clearly assigned across agencies, and across the foreign-domestic divide.\n\nConsider, for example, the case of Mihdhar, Hazmi, and their January 2000 trip to Kuala Lumpur, detailed in \nchapter 6. In late 1999, the National Security Agency (NSA) analyzed communications associated with a man \nnamed Khalid, a man named Nawaf, and a man named Salem. Working-level officials in the intelligence community \nknew little more than this. But they correctly concluded that \"Nawaf \" and \"Khalid\" might be part of \"an operational \ncadre\" and that \"something nefarious might be afoot. \"\n\nThe NSA did not think its job was to research these identities. It saw itself as an agency to support intelligence \nconsumers, such as CIA. The NSA tried to respond energetically to any request made. But it waited to be asked.\n\nIf NSA had been asked to try to identify these people, the agency would have started by checking its own database \nof earlier information from these same sources. Some of this information had been reported; some had not. But it \nwas all readily accessible in the database. NSA's analysts would promptly have discovered who Nawaf was, that \nhis full name might be Nawaf al Hazmi, and that he was an old friend of Khalid.\n\nWith this information and more that was available, managers could have more effectively tracked the movement of \nthese operatives in southeast Asia. With the name \"Nawaf al Hazmi, \" a manager could then have asked the State \nDepartment also to check that name. State would promptly have found its own record on Nawaf al Hazmi, showing \nthat he too had been issued a visa to visit the United States. Officials would have learned that the visa had been \nissued at the same place - Jeddah - and on almost the same day as the one given to Khalid al Mihdhar.\n\nWhen the travelers left Kuala Lumpur for Bangkok, local officials were able to identify one of the travelers as Khalid \nal Mihdhar. After the flight left, they learned that one of his companions had the name Alhazmi. But the officials did \nnot know what that name meant.\n\nThe information arrived at Bangkok too late to track these travelers as they came in. Had the authorities there \nalready been keeping an eye out for Khalid al Mihdhar as part of a general regional or worldwide alert, they might \nhave tracked him coming in. Had they been alerted to look for a possible companion named Nawaf al Hazmi, they \nmight have noticed him too. Instead, they were notified only after Kuala Lumpur sounded the alarm. By that time, \nthe travelers had already disappeared into the streets of Bangkok.\n\nOn January 12, the head of the CIA's al Qaeda unit told his bosses that surveillance in Kuala Lumpur was \ncontinuing. He may not have known that in fact Mihdhar and his companions had dispersed and the tracking was \nfalling apart. U. S. officials in Bangkok regretfully reported the bad news on January 13. The names they had were \nput on a watchlist in Bangkok, so that Thai authorities might notice if the men left the country. On January 14, the \nhead of the CIA's al Qaeda unit again updated his bosses, telling them that officials were continuing to track the \nsuspicious individuals who had now dispersed to various countries.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no evidence of any tracking efforts actually being undertaken by anyone after the Arabs \ndisappeared into Bangkok. No other effort was made to create other opportunities to spot these Arab travelers in \ncase the screen in Bangkok failed. Just from the evidence in Mihdhar's passport, one of the logical possible \ndestinations and interdiction points would have been the United States. Yet no one alerted the INS or the FBI to \nlook for these individuals. They arrived, unnoticed, in Los Angeles on January 15.\n\nIn early March 2000, Bangkok reported that Nawaf al Hazmi, now identified for the first time with his full name, had \ndeparted on January 15 on a United Airlines flight to Los Angeles. Since the CIA did not appreciate the significance \nof that name or notice the cable, we have found no evidence that this information was sent to the FBI.\n\n\n\nEven if watchlisting had prevented or at least alerted U. S. officials to the entry of Hazmi and Mihdhar, we do not \nthink it is likely that watchlisting, by itself, have prevented the 9/11 attacks. Al Qaeda adapted to the failure of some \nof its operatives to gain entry into the United States. None of these future hijackers was a pilot. Alternatively, had \nthey been permitted entry and surveilled, some larger results might have been possible had the FBI been patient.\n\nThese are difficult what-ifs. The intelligence community might have judged that the risks of conducting such a \nprolonged intelligence operation were too high - potential terrorists might have been lost track of, for example. The \npre- 9/11 FBI might not have been judged capable of conducting such an operation. But surely the intelligence \ncommunity would have preferred to have the chance to make these choices.\n\nFrom the details of this case, or from the other opportunities we catalogue in the text box, one can see how hard it \nis for the intelligence community to assemble enough of the puzzle pieces gathered by different agencies to make \nsome sense of them and then develop a fully informed joint plan. Accomplishing all this is especially difficult in a \ntransnational case. We sympathize with the working-level officers, drowning in information and trying to decide what \nis important or what needs to be done when no particular action has been requested of them.\n\nWho had the job of managing the case to make sure these things were done? One answer is that everyone had the \njob. The CIA's deputy director for operations, James Pavitt, stressed to us that the responsibility resided with all \ninvolved. Above all he emphasized the primacy of the field. The field had the lead in managing operations. The job \nof headquarters, he stressed, was to support the field, and do so without delay. If the field asked for information or \nother support, the job of headquarters was to get it - right away.  \n\nThis is a traditional perspective on operations and, traditionally, it has had great merit. It reminded us of the FBI's \npre-9/11 emphasis on the primacy of its field offices. When asked about how this traditional structure would adapt to \nthe challenge of managing a transnational case, one that hopped from place to place as this one did, the deputy \ndirector argued that all involved were\n\nSidebar 7: \n\nresponsible for making it work. Pavitt underscored the responsibility of the particular field location where the \nsuspects were being tracked at any given time. On the other hand, he also said that the Counterterrorist Center \nwas supposed to manage all the moving parts, while what happened on the ground was the responsibility of \nmanagers in the field.  \n\nHeadquarters tended to support and facilitate, trying to make sure everyone was in the loop. From time to time a \nparticular post would push one way, or headquarters would urge someone to do something. But headquarters never \nreally took responsibility for the successful management of this case. Hence the managers at CIA headquarters did \nnot realize that omissions in planning had occurred, and they scarcely knew that the case had fallen apart.\n\nThe director of the Counterterrorist Center at the time, Cofer Black, recalled to us that this operation was one \namong many and that, at the time, it was \"considered interesting, but not heavy water yet. \" He recalled the failure \nto get the word to Bangkok fast enough, but has no evident recollection of why the case then dissolved, unnoticed.  \n\nThe next level down, the director of the al Qaeda unit in CIA at the time recalled that he did not think it was his job \nto direct what should or should not be done. He did not pay attention when the individuals dispersed and things fell \napart. There was no conscious decision to stop the operation after the trail was temporarily lost in Bangkok. He \nacknowledged, however, that perhaps there had been a letdown for his overworked staff after the extreme tension \nand long hours in the period of the millennium alert.  \n\nThe details of this case illuminate real management challenges, past and future. The U. S. government must find a \nway of pooling intelligence and using it to guide the planning of and assignment of responsibilities for joint \noperations involving organizations as disparate as the CIA, the FBI, the State Department, the military, and the \nagencies involved in homeland security.\n\nInstitutional Management \n\n\n\nBeyond those day-to-day tasks of bridging the foreign-domestic divide and matching intelligence with plans, the \nchallenges include broader management issues pertaining to how the top leaders of the government set priorities \nand allocate resources. Once again it is useful to illustrate the problem by examining the CIA, since before 9/11 this \nagency's role was so central in the government's counterterrorism efforts.\n\nOn December 4, 1998, DCI Tenet issued a directive to several CIA officials and his deputy for community \nmanagement, stating:\"We are at war. I want no resources or people spared in this effort, either inside CIA or the \nCommunity. \"   The memorandum had little overall effect on mobilizing the CIA or the intelligence community.  \n\nThe memo was addressed only to CIA officials and the deputy for community management, Joan Dempsey. She \nfaxed the memo to the heads of the major intelligence agencies after removing covert action sections. Only a \nhandful of people received it. The NSA director at the time, Lieutenant General Kenneth Minihan, believed the \nmemo applied only to the CIA and not the NSA, because no one had informed him of any NSA shortcomings. For \ntheir part, CIA officials thought the memorandum was intended for the rest of the intelligence community, given that \nthey were already doing all they could and believed that the rest of the community needed to pull its weight.  \n\nThe episode indicates some of the limitations of the DCI's authority over the direction and priorities of the \nintelligence community, especially its elements within the Department of Defense. The DCI has to direct agencies \nwithout controlling them. He does not receive an appropriation for their activities, and therefore does not control \ntheir purse strings. He has little insight into how they spend their resources. Congress attempted to strengthen the \nDCI's authority in 1996 by creating the positions of deputy DCI for community management and assistant DCIs for \ncollection, analysis and production, and administration. But the authority of these positions is limited, and the vision \nof central management clearly has not been realized.\n\nThe DCI did not develop a management strategy for a war against Islamist terrorism before 9/11. Such a \nmanagement strategy would define the capabilities the intelligence community must acquire for such a war - from \nlanguage training to collection systems to analysts. Such a management strategy would necessarily extend beyond \nthe CTC to the components that feed its expertise and support its operations, linked transparently to \ncounterterrorism objectives. It would then detail the proposed expenditures and organizational changes required to \nacquire and implement these capabilities.\n\nDCI Tenet and his deputy director for operations told us they did have a management strategy for a war on \nterrorism. It was to rebuild the CIA. They said the CIA as a whole had been badly damaged by prior budget \nconstraints and that capabilities needed to be restored across the board. Indeed, the CTC budget had not been cut \nwhile the budgets had been slashed in many other parts of the Agency. By restoring funding across the CIA, a \nrising tide would lift all boats. They also stressed the synergy between improvements of every part of the Agency \nand the capabilities that the CTC or stations overseas could draw on in the war on terror.  \n\nAs some officials pointed out to us, there is a tradeoff in this management approach. In an attempt to rebuild \neverything at once, the highest priority efforts might not get the maximum support that they need. Furthermore, this \napproach attempted to channel relatively strong outside support for combating terrorism into backing for across-the-\nboard funding increases. Proponents of the counterterrorism agenda might respond by being less inclined to loosen \nthe purse strings than they would have been if offered a convincing counterterrorism budget strategy. The DCI's \nmanagement strategy was also focused mainly on the CIA.\n\nLacking a management strategy for the war on terrorism or ways to see how funds were being spent across the \ncommunity, DCI Tenet and his aides found it difficult to develop an overall intelligence community budget for a war \non terrorism.\n\nResponsibility for domestic intelligence gathering on terrorism was vested solely in the FBI, yet during almost all of \nthe Clinton administration the relationship between the FBI Director and the President was nearly nonexistent. The \nFBI Director would not communicate directly with the President. His key personnel shared very little information with \nthe National Security Council and the rest of the national security community. As a consequence, one of the critical \nworking relationships in the counterterrorism effort was broken.\n\nThe Millennium Exception \n\n\n\nBefore concluding our narrative, we offer a reminder, and an explanation, of the one period in which the \ngovernment as a whole seemed to be acting in concert to deal with terrorism - the last weeks of December 1999 \npreceding the millennium.\n\nIn the period between December 1999 and early January 2000, information about terrorism flowed widely and \nabundantly. The flow from the FBI was particularly remarkable because the FBI at other times shared almost no \ninformation. That from the intelligence community was also remarkable, because some of it reached officials - local \nairport managers and local police departments - who had not seen such information before and would not see it \nagain before 9/11, if then. And the terrorist threat, in the United States even more than abroad, engaged the \nfrequent attention of high officials in the executive branch and leaders in both houses of Congress.\n\nWhy was this so? Most obviously, it was because everyone was already on edge with the millennium and possible \ncomputer programming glitches (\"Y2K\") that might obliterate records, shut down power and communication lines, or \notherwise disrupt daily life. Then, Jordanian authorities arrested 16 al Qaeda terrorists planning a number of \nbombings in that country. Those in custody included two U. S. citizens. Soon after, an alert Customs agent caught \nAhmed Ressam bringing explosives across the Canadian border with the apparent intention of blowing up Los \nAngeles airport. He was found to have confederates on both sides of the border.\n\nThese were not events whispered about in highly classified intelligence dailies or FBI interview memos. The \ninformation was in all major newspapers and highlighted in network television news. Though the Jordanian arrests \nonly made page 13 of the New York Times , they were featured on every evening newscast. The arrest of Ressam \nwas on front pages, and the original story and its follow-ups dominated television news for a week. FBI field offices \naround the country were swamped by calls from concerned citizens. Representatives of the Justice Department, the \nFAA, local police departments, and major airports had microphones in their faces whenever they showed \nthemselves.  \n\nAfter the millennium alert, the government relaxed. Counterterrorism went back to being a secret preserve for \nsegments of the FBI, the Counterterrorist Center, and the Counterterrorism Security Group. But the experience \nshowed that the government was capable of mobilizing itself for an alert against terrorism. While one factor was the \npreexistence of widespread concern about Y2K, another, at least equally important, was simply shared information. \nEveryone knew not only of an abstract threat but of at least one terrorist who had been arrested in the United States \n. Terrorism had a face - that of Ahmed Ressam - and Americans from Vermont to southern California went on the \nwatch for his like.\n\nIn the summer of 2001, DCI Tenet, the Counterterrorist Center, and the Counterterrorism Security Group did their \nutmost to sound a loud alarm, its basis being intelligence indicating that al Qaeda planned something big. But the \nmillennium phenomenon was not repeated. FBI field offices apparently saw no abnormal terrorist activity, and \nheadquarters was not shaking them up.\n\nBetween May 2001 and September 11, there was very little in newspapers\n\nor on television to heighten anyone's concern about terrorism. Front-page stories touching on the subject dealt with \nthe windup of trials dealing with the East Africa embassy bombings and Ressam. All this reportage looked \nbackward, describing problems satisfactorily resolved. Back-page notices told of tightened security at embassies \nand military installations abroad and government cautions against travel to the Arabian Peninsula. All the rest was \nsecret.\n\n12 WHAT TO DO? A GLOBAL STRATEGY \n\n12. 1 REFLECTING ON A GENERATIONAL CHALLENGE \n\nThree years after 9/11, Americans are still thinking and talking about how to protect our nation in this new era. The \nnational debate continues.\n\n\n\nCountering terrorism has become, beyond any doubt, the top national security priority for the United States. This \nshift has occurred with the full support of the Congress, both major political parties, the media, and the American \npeople.\n\nThe nation has committed enormous resources to national security and to countering terrorism. Between fiscal year \n2001, the last budget adopted before 9/11, and the present fiscal year 2004, total federal spending on defense \n(including expenditures on both Iraq and Afghanistan), homeland security, and international affairs rose more than \n50 percent, from $354 billion to about $547 billion. The United States has not experienced such a rapid surge in \nnational security spending since the Korean War.  \n\nThis pattern has occurred before in American history. The United States faces a sudden crisis and summons a \ntremendous exertion of national energy. Then, as that surge transforms the landscape, comes a time for reflection \nand reevaluation. Some programs and even agencies are discarded; others are invented or redesigned. Private \nfirms and engaged citizens redefine their relationships with government, working through the processes of the \nAmerican republic.\n\nNow is the time for that reflection and reevaluation. The United States should consider what to do  - the shape and \nobjectives of a strategy. Americans should also consider how to do it  - organizing their government in a different \nway.\n\nDefining the Threat \n\nIn the post-9/11 world, threats are defined more by the fault lines within societies than by the territorial boundaries \nbetween them. From terrorism to global\n\ndisease or environmental degradation, the challenges have become transnational rather than international. That is \nthe defining quality of world politics in the twenty-first century.\n\nNational security used to be considered by studying foreign frontiers, weighing opposing groups of states, and \nmeasuring industrial might. To be dangerous, an enemy had to muster large armies. Threats emerged slowly, often \nvisibly, as weapons were forged, armies conscripted, and units trained and moved into place. Because large states \nwere more powerful, they also had more to lose. They could be deterred.\n\nNow threats can emerge quickly. An organization like al Qaeda, headquartered in a country on the other side of the \nearth, in a region so poor that electricity or telephones were scarce, could nonetheless scheme to wield weapons of \nunprecedented destructive power in the largest cities of the United States.\n\nIn this sense, 9/11 has taught us that terrorism against American interests \"over there\" should be regarded just as \nwe regard terrorism against America \"over here. \" In this same sense, the American homeland is the planet.\n\nBut the enemy is not just \"terrorism, \" some generic evil.   This vagueness blurs the strategy. The catastrophic \nthreat at this moment in history is more specific. It is the threat posed by Islamist terrorism - especially the al Qaeda \nnetwork, its affiliates, and its ideology.  \n\nAs we mentioned in chapter 2, Usama Bin Ladin and other Islamist terrorist leaders draw on a long tradition of \nextreme intolerance within one stream of Islam (a minority tradition), from at least Ibn Taimiyyah, through the \nfounders of Wahhabism, through the Muslim Brotherhood, to Sayyid Qutb. That stream is motivated by religion and \ndoes not distinguish politics from religion, thus distorting both. It is further fed by grievances stressed by Bin Ladin \nand widely felt throughout the Muslim world - against the U. S. military presence in the Middle East, policies \nperceived as anti-Arab and anti-Muslim, and support of Israel. Bin Ladin and Islamist terrorists mean exactly what \nthey say: to them America is the font of all evil, the \"head of the snake, \" and it must be converted or destroyed.\n\nIt is not a position with which Americans can bargain or negotiate. With it there is no common ground - not even \nrespect for life - on which to begin a dialogue. It can only be destroyed or utterly isolated.\n\nBecause the Muslim world has fallen behind the West politically, economically, and militarily for the past three \ncenturies, and because few tolerant or secular Muslim democracies provide alternative models for the future, Bin \nLadin's message finds receptive ears. It has attracted active support from thousands of disaffected young Muslims \n\n\n\nand resonates powerfully with a far larger number who do not actively support his methods. The resentment of \nAmerica and the West is deep, even among leaders of relatively successful Muslim states.  \n\nTolerance, the rule of law, political and economic openness, the extension\n\nof greater opportunities to women - these cures must come from within Muslim societies themselves. The United \nStates must support such developments.\n\nBut this process is likely to be measured in decades, not years. It is a process that will be violently opposed by \nIslamist terrorist organizations, both inside Muslim countries and in attacks on the United States and other Western \nnations. The United States finds itself caught up in a clash within a civilization. That clash arises from particular \nconditions in the Muslim world, conditions that spill over into expatriate Muslim communities in non-Muslim \ncountries.\n\nOur enemy is twofold: al Qaeda, a stateless network of terrorists that struck us on 9/11; and a radical ideological \nmovement in the Islamic world, inspired in part by al Qaeda, which has spawned terrorist groups and violence \nacross the globe. The first enemy is weakened, but continues to pose a grave threat. The second enemy is \ngathering, and will menace Americans and American interests long after Usama Bin Ladin and his cohorts are killed \nor captured. Thus our strategy must match our means to two ends: dismantling the al Qaeda network and prevailing \nin the longer term over the ideology that gives rise to Islamist terrorism.\n\nIslam is not the enemy. It is not synonymous with terror. Nor does Islam teach terror. America and its friends \noppose a perversion of Islam, not the great world faith itself. Lives guided by religious faith, including literal beliefs \nin holy scriptures, are common to every religion, and represent no threat to us.\n\nOther religions have experienced violent internal struggles. With so many diverse adherents, every major religion \nwill spawn violent zealots. Yet understanding and tolerance among people of different faiths can and must prevail.\n\nThe present transnational danger is Islamist terrorism. What is needed is a broad political-military strategy that rests \non a firm tripod of policies to\n\n     *  attack terrorists and their organizations;\n\n     *  prevent the continued growth of Islamist terrorism; and\n\n     *  protect against and prepare for terrorist attacks.\n\nMore Than a War on Terrorism \n\nTerrorism is a tactic used by individuals and organizations to kill and destroy. Our efforts should be directed at \nthose individuals and organizations.\n\nCalling this struggle a war accurately describes the use of American and allied armed forces to find and destroy \nterrorist groups and their allies in the field, notably in Afghanistan. The language of war also evokes the mobilization \nfor a national effort. Yet the strategy should be balanced.\n\nThe first phase of our post-9/11 efforts rightly included military action to topple the Taliban and pursue al Qaeda. \nThis work continues. But long-term success demands the use of all elements of national power: diplomacy, intelli-\n\ngence, covert action, law enforcement, economic policy, foreign aid, public diplomacy, and homeland defense. If we \nfavor one tool while neglecting others, we leave ourselves vulnerable and weaken our national effort.\n\nCertainly the strategy should include offensive operations to counter terrorism. Terrorists should no longer find safe \nhaven where their organizations can grow and flourish. America's strategy should be a coalition strategy, that \nincludes Muslim nations as partners in its development and implementation.\n\nOur effort should be accompanied by a preventive strategy that is as much, or more, political as it is military. The \nstrategy must focus clearly on the Arab and Muslim world, in all its variety.\n\nOur strategy should also include defenses. America can be attacked in many ways and has many vulnerabilities. \nNo defenses are perfect. But risks must be calculated; hard choices must be made about allocating resources. \n\n\n\nResponsibilities for America's defense should be clearly defined. Planning does make a difference, identifying \nwhere a little money might have a large effect. Defenses also complicate the plans of attackers, increasing their \nrisks of discovery and failure. Finally, the nation must prepare to deal with attacks that are not stopped.\n\nMeasuring Success \n\nWhat should Americans expect from their government in the struggle against Islamist terrorism? The goals seem \nunlimited: Defeat terrorism anywhere in the world. But Americans have also been told to expect the worst: An attack \nis probably coming; it may be terrible.\n\nWith such benchmarks, the justifications for action and spending seem limitless. Goals are good. Yet effective \npublic policies also need concrete objectives. Agencies need to be able to measure success.\n\nThese measurements do not need to be quantitative: government cannot measure success in the ways that private \nfirms can. But the targets should be specific enough so that reasonable observers - in the White House, the \nCongress, the media, or the general public - can judge whether or not the objectives have been attained.\n\nVague goals match an amorphous picture of the enemy. Al Qaeda and its affiliates are popularly described as being \nall over the world, adaptable, resilient, needing little higher-level organization, and capable of anything. The \nAmerican people are thus given the picture of an omnipotent, unslayable hydra of destruction. This image lowers \nexpectations for government effectiveness.\n\nIt should not lower them too far. Our report shows a determined and capable group of plotters. Yet the group was \nfragile, dependent on a few key personalities, and occasionally left vulnerable by the marginal, unstable people \noften attracted to such causes. The enemy made mistakes - like Khalid al Mihdhar's unauthorized departure from \nthe United States that required him to enter the country again in July 2001, or the selection of Zacarias Moussaoui \nas a par-\n\nticipant and Ramzi Binalshibh's transfer of money to him. The U. S. government was not able to capitalize on those \nmistakes in time to prevent 9/11.\n\nWe do not believe it is possible to defeat all terrorist attacks against Americans, every time and everywhere. A \npresident should tell the American people:\n\n     *  No president can promise that a catastrophic attack like that of\n\n        9/11 will not happen again. History has shown that even the most\n\n        vigilant and expert agencies cannot always prevent determined,\n\n        suicidal attackers from reaching a target.\n\n     *  But the American people are entitled to expect their government to\n\n        do its very best. They should expect that officials will have\n\n        realistic objectives, clear guidance, and effective organization.\n\n        They are entitled to see some standards for performance so they can\n\n        judge, with the help of their elected representatives, whether the\n\n        objectives are being met.\n\n12. 2 ATTACK TERRORISTS AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONS \n\nThe U. S. government, joined by other governments around the world, is working through intelligence, law \nenforcement, military, financial, and diplomatic channels to identify, disrupt, capture, or kill individual terrorists. This \neffort was going on before 9/11 and it continues on a vastly enlarged scale. But to catch terrorists, a U. S. or foreign \nagency needs to be able to find and reach them.\n\n\n\nNo Sanctuaries \n\nThe 9/11 attack was a complex international operation, the product of years of planning. Bombings like those in Bali \nin 2003 or Madrid in 2004, while able to take hundreds of lives, can be mounted locally. Their requirements are far \nmore modest in size and complexity. They are more difficult to thwart. But the U. S. government must build the \ncapacities to prevent a 9/11-scale plot from succeeding, and those capabilities will help greatly to cope with lesser \nbut still devastating attacks.\n\nA complex international terrorist operation aimed at launching a catastrophic attack cannot be mounted by just \nanyone in any place. Such operations appear to require\n\n     *  time, space, and ability to perform competent planning and staff\n\n        work;\n\n     *  a command structure able to make necessary decisions and possessing\n\n        the authority and contacts to assemble needed people, money, and\n\n        materials;\n\n     *  opportunity and space to recruit, train, and select operatives with\n\n        the needed skills and dedication, providing the time and structure\n\n        required to socialize them into the terrorist cause, judge their\n\n        trustworthiness, and hone their skills;\n\n     *  a logistics network able to securely manage the travel of\n\n        operatives, move money, and transport resources (like explosives)\n\n        where they need to go;\n\n     *  access, in the case of certain weapons, to the special materials\n\n        needed for a nuclear, chemical, radiological, or biological attack;\n\n     *  reliable communications between coordinators and operatives; and\n\n     *  opportunity to test the workability of the plan.\n\nMany details in chapters 2, 5, and 7 illustrate the direct and indirect value of the Afghan sanctuary to al Qaeda in \npreparing the 9/11 attack and other operations. The organization cemented personal ties among veteran jihadists \nworking together there for years. It had the operational space to gather and sift recruits, indoctrinating them in \nisolated, desert camps. It built up logistical networks, running through Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAl Qaeda also exploited relatively lax internal security environments in Western countries, especially Germany. It \nconsidered the environment in the United States so hospitable that the 9/11 operatives used America as their \nstaging area for further training and exercises - traveling into, out of, and around the country and complacently \nusing their real names with little fear of capture.\n\nTo find sanctuary, terrorist organizations have fled to some of the least governed, most lawless places in the world. \nThe intelligence community has prepared a world map that highlights possible terrorist havens, using no secret \nintelligence - just indicating areas that combine rugged terrain, weak governance, room to hide or receive supplies, \nand low population density with a town or city near enough to allow necessary interaction with the outside world. \nLarge areas scattered around the world meet these criteria.  \n\nIn talking with American and foreign government officials and military officers on the front lines fighting terrorists \ntoday, we asked them: If you were a terrorist leader today, where would you locate your base? Some of the same \nplaces come up again and again on their lists:\n\n     *  western Pakistan and the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region\n\n\n\n     *  southern or western Afghanistan\n\n     *  the Arabian Peninsula, especially Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and the\n\n        nearby Horn of Africa, including Somalia and extending southwest\n\n        into Kenya\n\n     *  Southeast Asia, from Thailand to the southern Philippines to\n\n        Indonesia\n\n     *  West Africa, including Nigeria and Mali\n\n     *  European cities with expatriate Muslim communities, especially\n\n        cities\n\n     *  in central and eastern Europe where security forces and border\n\n        controls are less effective\n\nIn the twentieth century, strategists focused on the world's great industrial heartlands. In the twenty-first, the focus \nis in the opposite direction, toward remote regions and failing states. The United States has had to find ways to \nextend its reach, straining the limits of its influence.\n\nEvery policy decision we make needs to be seen through this lens. If, for example, Iraq becomes a failed state, it \nwill go to the top of the list of places that are breeding grounds for attacks against Americans at home. Similarly, if \nwe are paying insufficient attention to Afghanistan, the rule of the Taliban or warlords and narcotraffickers may \nreemerge and its countryside could once again offer refuge to al Qaeda, or its successor.\n\nRecommendation:The U. S. government must identify and prioritize actual or potential terrorist sanctuaries. \nFor each, it should have a realistic strategy to keep possible terrorists insecure and on the run, using all \nelements of national power. We should reach out, listen to, and work with other countries that can help. \n\nWe offer three illustrations that are particularly applicable today, in 2004: Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Saudi Arabia.\n\nPakistan \n\nPakistan's endemic poverty, widespread corruption, and often ineffective government create opportunities for \nIslamist recruitment. Poor education is a particular concern. Millions of families, especially those with little money, \nsend their children to religious schools, or madrassahs. Many of these schools are the only opportunity available for \nan education, but some have been used as incubators for violent extremism. According to Karachi's police \ncommander, there are 859 madrassahs teaching more than 200, 000 youngsters in his city alone.  \n\nIt is hard to overstate the importance of Pakistan in the struggle against Islamist terrorism. Within Pakistan's \nborders are 150 million Muslims, scores of al Qaeda terrorists, many Taliban fighters, and - perhaps - Usama Bin \nLadin. Pakistan possesses nuclear weapons and has come frighteningly close to war with nuclear-armed India over \nthe disputed territory of Kashmir. A political battle among anti-American Islamic fundamentalists, the Pakistani \nmilitary, and more moderate mainstream political forces has already spilled over into violence, and there have been \nrepeated recent attempts to kill Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf.\n\nIn recent years, the United States has had three basic problems in its relationship with Pakistan:\n\n     *  On terrorism, Pakistan helped nurture the Taliban. The Pakistani\n\n        army and intelligence services, especially below the top ranks,\n\n        have long been ambivalent about confronting Islamist extremists.\n\n        Many in the government have sympathized with or provided support to\n\n\n\n        the extremists. Musharraf agreed that Bin Ladin was bad. But before\n\n        9/11, preserving good relations with the Taliban took precedence.\n\n     *  On proliferation, Musharraf has repeatedly said that Pakistan does\n\n        not barter with its nuclear technology. But proliferation concerns\n\n        have been long-standing and very serious. Most recently, the\n\n        Pakistani government has claimed not to have known that one of its\n\n        nuclear weapons developers, a national figure, was leading the most\n\n        dangerous nuclear smuggling ring ever disclosed.\n\n     *  Finally, Pakistan has made little progress toward the return of\n\n        democratic rule at the national level, although that turbulent\n\n        process does continue to function at the provincial level and the\n\n        Pakistani press remains relatively free.\n\nImmediately after 9/11, confronted by the United States with a stark choice, Pakistan made a strategic decision. Its \ngovernment stood aside and allowed the U. S. -led coalition to destroy the Taliban regime. In other ways, Pakistan \nactively assisted: its authorities arrested more than 500 al Qaeda operatives and Taliban members, and Pakistani \nforces played a leading part in tracking down KSM, Abu Zubaydah, and other key al Qaeda figures.  \n\nIn the following two years, the Pakistani government tried to walk the fence, helping against al Qaeda while seeking \nto avoid a larger confrontation with Taliban remnants and other Islamic extremists. When al Qaeda and its Pakistani \nallies repeatedly tried to assassinate Musharraf, almost succeeding, the battle came home.\n\nThe country's vast unpoliced regions make Pakistan attractive to extremists seeking refuge and recruits and also \nprovide a base for operations against coalition forces in Afghanistan. Almost all the 9/11 attackers traveled the \nnorthsouth nexus of Kandahar-Quetta-Karachi. The Baluchistan region of Pakistan (KSM's ethnic home) and the \nsprawling city of Karachi remain centers of Islamist extremism where the U. S. and Pakistani security and \nintelligence presence has been weak. The U. S. consulate in Karachi is a makeshift fortress, reflecting the gravity of \nthe surrounding threat.  \n\nDuring the winter of 2003-2004, Musharraf made another strategic decision. He ordered the Pakistani army into the \nfrontier provinces of northwest Pakistan along the Afghan border, where Bin Ladin and Ayman al Zawahiri have \nreportedly taken refuge. The army is confronting groups of al Qaeda fighters and their local allies in very difficult \nterrain. On the other side of the frontier, U. S. forces in Afghanistan have found it challenging to organize effective \njoint\n\noperations, given Pakistan's limited capabilities and reluctance to permit U. S. military operations on its soil. Yet in \n2004, it is clear that the Pakistani government is trying harder than ever before in the battle against Islamist \nterrorists.  \n\nAcknowledging these problems and Musharraf 's own part in the story, we believe that Musharraf 's government \nrepresents the best hope for stability in Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\n     *  In an extraordinary public essay asking how Muslims can \"drag\n\n        ourselves out of the pit we find ourselves in, to raise ourselves\n\n        up, \" Musharraf has called for a strategy of \"enlightened\n\n        moderation. \"The Muslim world, he said, should shun militancy and\n\n        extremism; the West - and the United States in particular - should\n\n        seek to resolve disputes with justice and help better the Muslim\n\n        world.\n\n\n\n     *  Having come close to war in 2002 and 2003, Pakistan and India have\n\n        recently made significant progress in peacefully discussing their\n\n        longstanding differences. The United States has been and should\n\n        remain a key supporter of that process.\n\n     *  The constant refrain of Pakistanis is that the United States long\n\n        treated them as allies of convenience. As the United States makes\n\n        fresh commitments now, it should make promises it is prepared to\n\n        keep, for years to come.\n\nRecommendation: If Musharraf stands for enlightened moderation in a fight for his life and for the life of his \ncountry, the United States should be willing to make hard choices too, and make the difficult long-term \ncommitment to the future of Pakistan. Sustaining the current scale of aid to Pakistan, the United States \nshould support Pakistan's government in its struggle against extremists with a comprehensive effort that \nextends from military aid to support for better education, so long as Pakistan's leaders remain willing to \nmake difficult choices of their own. \n\nAfghanistan \n\nAfghanistan was the incubator for al Qaeda and for the 9/11 attacks. In the fall of 2001, the U. S. -led international \ncoalition and its Afghan allies toppled the Taliban and ended the regime's protection of al Qaeda. Notable progress \nhas been made. International cooperation has been strong, with a clear UN mandate and a NATO-led \npeacekeeping force (the International Security Assistance Force, or ISAF). More than 10, 000 American soldiers \nare deployed today in Afghanistan, joined by soldiers from NATO allies and Muslim states. A central government \nhas been established in Kabul, with a democratic constitution, new currency, and a new army. Most Afghans enjoy \ngreater freedom, women\n\nand girls are emerging from subjugation, and 3 million children have returned to school. For the first time in many \nyears, Afghans have reason to hope.  \n\nBut grave challenges remain. Taliban and al Qaeda fighters have regrouped in the south and southeast. Warlords \ncontrol much of the country beyond Kabul, and the land is awash in weapons. Economic development remains a \ndistant hope. The narcotics trade - long a massive sector of the Afghan economy - is again booming. Even the most \nhardened aid workers refuse to operate in many regions, and some warn that Afghanistan is near the brink of \nchaos.  \n\nBattered Afghanistan has a chance. Elections are being prepared. It is revealing that in June 2004, Taliban fighters \nresorted to slaughtering 16 Afghans on a bus, apparently for no reason other than their boldness in carrying an \nunprecedented Afghan weapon: a voter registration card.\n\nAfghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, is brave and committed. He is trying to build genuinely national institutions \nthat can overcome the tradition of allocating powers among ethnic communities. Yet even if his efforts are \nsuccessful and elections bring a democratic government to Afghanistan, the United States faces some difficult \nchoices.\n\nAfter paying relatively little attention to rebuilding Afghanistan during the military campaign, U. S. policies changed \nnoticeably during 2003. Greater consideration of the political dimension and congressional support for a substantial \npackage of assistance signaled a longer-term commitment to Afghanistan's future. One Afghan regional official \nplaintively told us the country finally has a good government. He begged the United States to keep its promise and \nnot abandon Afghanistan again, as it had in the 1990s. Another Afghan leader noted that if the United States \nleaves, \"we will lose all that we have gained. \"  \n\n\n\nMost difficult is to define the security mission in Afghanistan. There is continuing political controversy about whether \nmilitary operations in Iraq have had any effect on the scale of America's commitment to the future of Afghanistan. \nThe United States has largely stayed out of the central government's struggles with dissident warlords and it has \nlargely avoided confronting the related problem of narcotrafficking.  \n\nRecommendation:The President and the Congress deserve praise for their efforts in Afghanistan so far. \nNow the United States and the international community should make a long-term commitment to a secure \nand stable Afghanistan, in order to give the government a reasonable opportunity to improve the life of the \nAfghan people. Afghanistan must not again become a sanctuary for international crime and terrorism. The \nUnited States and the international community should help the Afghan government extend its authority \nover the country, with a strategy and nation-by-nation commitments to achieve their objectives. \n\n     *  This is an ambitious recommendation. It would mean a redoubled\n\n        effort to secure the country, disarm militias, and curtail the age\n\n        of warlord rule. But the United States and NATO have already\n\n        committed themselves to the future of this region - wisely, as the\n\n        9/11 story shows - and failed half-measures could be worse than\n\n        useless.\n\n     *  NATO in particular has made Afghanistan a test of the Alliance's\n\n        ability to adapt to current security challenges of the future. NATO\n\n        must pass this test. Currently, the United States and the\n\n        international community envision enough support so that the central\n\n        government can build a truly national army and extend essential\n\n        infrastructure and minimum public services to major towns and\n\n        regions. The effort relies in part on foreign civil-military teams,\n\n        arranged under various national flags. The institutional\n\n        commitments of NATO and the United Nations to these enterprises are\n\n        weak. NATO member states are not following through;some of the\n\n        other states around the world that have pledged assistance to\n\n        Afghanistan are not fulfilling their pledges.\n\n     *  The U. S. presence in Afghanistan is overwhelmingly oriented toward\n\n        military and security work. The State Department presence is\n\n        woefully understaffed, and the military mission is narrowly focused\n\n        on al Qaeda and Taliban remnants in the south and southeast. The U.\n\n        S. government can do its part if the international community\n\n        decides on a joint effort to restore the rule of law and contain\n\n        rampant crime and narcotics trafficking in this crossroads of\n\n        Central Asia.\n\n\n\nWe heard again and again that the money for assistance is allocated so rigidly that, on the ground, one U. S. \nagency often cannot improvise or pitch in to help another agency, even in small ways when a few thousand dollars \ncould make a great difference.\n\nThe U. S. government should allocate money so that lower-level officials have more flexibility to get the job done \nacross agency lines, adjusting to the circumstances they find in the field. This should include discretionary funds for \nexpenditures by military units that often encounter opportunities to help the local population.\n\nSaudi Arabia \n\nSaudi Arabia has been a problematic ally in combating Islamic extremism. At the level of high policy, Saudi Arabia's \nleaders cooperated with American diplomatic initiatives aimed at the Taliban or Pakistan before 9/11. At the same \ntime, Saudi Arabia's society was a place where al Qaeda raised money directly from individuals and through \ncharities. It was the society that produced 15 of the 19 hijackers.\n\nThe Kingdom is one of the world's most religiously conservative societies, and its identity is closely bound to its \nreligious links, especially its position as the guardian of Islam's two holiest sites. Charitable giving, or zakat , is one \nof the five pillars of Islam. It is broader and more pervasive than Western ideas of charity - functioning also as a \nform of income tax, educational assistance, foreign aid, and a source of political influence. The Western notion of \nthe separation of civic and religious duty does not exist in Islamic cultures. Funding charitable works is an integral \nfunction of the governments in the Islamic world. It is so ingrained in Islamic culture that in Saudi Arabia, for \nexample, a department within the Saudi Ministry of Finance and National Economy collects zakat directly, much as \nthe U. S. Internal Revenue Service collects payroll withholding tax. Closely tied to zakat is the dedication of the \ngovernment to propagating the Islamic faith, particularly the Wahhabi sect that flourishes in Saudi Arabia.\n\nTraditionally, throughout the Muslim world, there is no formal oversight mechanism for donations. As Saudi wealth \nincreased, the amounts contributed by individuals and the state grew dramatically. Substantial sums went to finance \nIslamic charities of every kind.\n\nWhile Saudi domestic charities are regulated by the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, charities and international \nrelief agencies, such as the World Assembly of Muslim Youth (WAMY), are currently regulated by the Ministry of \nIslamic Affairs. This ministry uses zakat and government funds to spread Wahhabi beliefs throughout the world, \nincluding in mosques and schools. Often these schools provide the only education available; even in affluent \ncountries, Saudi-funded Wahhabi schools are often the only Islamic schools. Some Wahhabi-funded organizations \nhave been exploited by extremists to further their goal of violent jihad against non-Muslims. One such organization \nhas been the al Haramain Islamic Foundation;the assets of some branch offices have been frozen by the U. S. and \nSaudi governments.\n\nUntil 9/11, few Saudis would have considered government oversight of charitable donations necessary; many would \nhave perceived it as interference in the exercise of their faith. At the same time, the government's ability to finance \nmost state expenditures with energy revenues has delayed the need for a modern income tax system. As a result, \nthere have been strong religious, cultural, and administrative barriers to monitoring charitable spending. That \nappears to be changing, however, now that the goal of violent jihad also extends to overthrowing Sunni \ngovernments (such as the House of Saud) that are not living up to the ideals of the Islamist extremists.  \n\nThe leaders of the United States and the rulers of Saudi Arabia have long had friendly relations, rooted in \nfundamentally common interests against the Soviet Union during the Cold War, in American hopes that Saudi oil \nsupplies would stabilize the supply and price of oil in world markets, and in Saudi hopes that America could help \nprotect the Kingdom against foreign threats.\n\nIn 1990, the Kingdom hosted U. S. armed forces before the first U. S. -led war\n\nagainst Iraq. American soldiers and airmen have given their lives to help protect Saudi Arabia. The Saudi \ngovernment has difficulty acknowledging this. American military bases remained there until 2003, as part of an \ninternational commitment to contain Iraq.\n\n\n\nFor many years, leaders on both sides preferred to keep their ties quiet and behind the scenes. As a result, neither \nthe U. S. nor the Saudi people appreciated all the dimensions of the bilateral relationship, including the Saudi role in \nU. S. strategies to promote the Middle East peace process. In each country, political figures find it difficult to publicly \ndefend good relations with the other.\n\nToday, mutual recriminations flow. Many Americans see Saudi Arabia as an enemy, not as an embattled ally. They \nperceive an autocratic government that oppresses women, dominated by a wealthy and indolent elite. Saudi \ncontacts with American politicians are frequently invoked as accusations in partisan political arguments. Americans \nare often appalled by the intolerance, anti-Semitism, and anti-American arguments taught in schools and preached \nin mosques.\n\nSaudis are angry too. Many educated Saudis who were sympathetic to America now perceive the United States as \nan unfriendly state. One Saudi reformer noted to us that the demonization of Saudi Arabia in the U. S. media gives \nammunition to radicals, who accuse reformers of being U. S. lackeys. Tens of thousands of Saudis who once \nregularly traveled to (and often had homes in) the United States now go elsewhere.  \n\nAmong Saudis, the United States is seen as aligned with Israel in its conflict with the Palestinians, with whom \nSaudis ardently sympathize. Although Saudi Arabia's cooperation against terrorism improved to some extent after \nthe September 11 attacks, significant problems remained. Many in the Kingdom initially reacted with disbelief and \ndenial. In the following months, as the truth became clear, some leading Saudis quietly acknowledged the problem \nbut still did not see their own regime as threatened, and thus often did not respond promptly to U. S. requests for \nhelp. Though Saddam Hussein was widely detested, many Saudis are sympathetic to the anti-U. S. insurgents in \nIraq, although majorities also condemn jihadist attacks in the Kingdom.  \n\nAs in Pakistan, Yemen, and other countries, attitudes changed when the terrorism came home. Cooperation had \nalready become significant, but after the bombings in Riyadh on May 12, 2003, it improved much more. The \nKingdom openly discussed the problem of radicalism, criticized the terrorists as religiously deviant, reduced official \nsupport for religious activity overseas, closed suspect charitable foundations, and publicized arrests - very public \nmoves for a government that has preferred to keep internal problems quiet.\n\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is now locked in mortal combat with al Qaeda. Saudi police are regularly being killed \nin shootouts with terrorists. In June 2004, the Saudi ambassador to the United States called publicly - in the Saudi \npress - for his government to wage a jihad of its own against the terrorists. \"We must all, as a state and as a people, \nrecognize the truth about these criminals, \"\n\nhe declared, \"[i]f we do not declare a general mobilization - we will lose this war on terrorism. \"  \n\nSaudi Arabia is a troubled country. Although regarded as very wealthy, in fact per capita income has dropped from \n$28, 000 at its height to the present level of about $8, 000. Social and religious traditions complicate adjustment to \nmodern economic activity and limit employment opportunities for young Saudis. Women find their education and \nemployment sharply limited.\n\nPresident Clinton offered us a perceptive analysis of Saudi Arabia, contending that fundamentally friendly rulers \nhave been constrained by their desire to preserve the status quo. He, like others, made the case for pragmatic \nreform instead. He hopes the rulers will envision what they want their Kingdom to become in 10 or 20 years, and \nstart a process in which their friends can help them change.  \n\nThere are signs that Saudi Arabia's royal family is trying to build a consensus for political reform, though uncertain \nabout how fast and how far to go. Crown Prince Abdullah wants the Kingdom to join the World Trade Organization \nto accelerate economic liberalization. He has embraced the Arab Human Development Report, which was highly \ncritical of the Arab world's political, economic, and social failings and called for greater economic and political \nreform.  \n\nCooperation with Saudi Arabia against Islamist terrorism is very much in the U. S. interest. Such cooperation can \nexist for a time largely in secret, as it does now, but it cannot grow and thrive there. Nor, on either side, can \nfriendship be unconditional.\n\n\n\nRecommendation:The problems in the U. S. -Saudi relationship must be confronted, openly. The United \nStates and Saudi Arabia must determine if they can build a relationship that political leaders on both sides \nare prepared to publicly defend - a relationship about more than oil. It should include a shared commitment \nto political and economic reform, as Saudis make common cause with the outside world. It should include \na shared interest in greater tolerance and cultural respect, translating into a commitment to fight the violent \nextremists who foment hatred. \n\n12. 3 PREVENT THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF ISLAMIST TERRORISM \n\nIn October 2003, reflecting on progress after two years of waging the global war on terrorism, Defense Secretary \nDonald Rumsfeld asked his advisers:\"Are we capturing, killing or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day \nthan the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting, training and deploying\n\nagainst us? Does the US need to fashion a broad, integrated plan to stop the next generation of terrorists? The US \nis putting relatively little effort into a long-range plan, but we are putting a great deal of effort into trying to stop \nterrorists. The cost-benefit ratio is against us! Our cost is billions against the terrorists' costs of millions. \"  \n\nThese are the right questions. Our answer is that we need short-term action on a long-range strategy, one that \ninvigorates our foreign policy with the attention that the President and Congress have given to the military and \nintelligence parts of the conflict against Islamist terrorism.\n\nEngage the Struggle of Ideas \n\nThe United States is heavily engaged in the Muslim world and will be for many years to come. This American \nengagement is resented. Polls in 2002 found that among America's friends, like Egypt - the recipient of more U. S. \naid for the past 20 years than any other Muslim country - only 15 percent of the population had a favorable opinion \nof the United States. In Saudi Arabia the number was 12 percent. And two-thirds of those surveyed in 2003 in \ncountries from Indonesia to Turkey (a NATO ally) were very or somewhat fearful that the United States may attack \nthem.  \n\nSupport for the United States has plummeted. Polls taken in Islamic countries after 9/11 suggested that many or \nmost people thought the United States was doing the right thing in its fight against terrorism; few people saw \npopular support for al Qaeda; half of those surveyed said that ordinary people had a favorable view of the United \nStates. By 2003, polls showed that \"the bottom has fallen out of support for America in most of the Muslim world. \nNegative views of the U. S. among Muslims, which had been largely limited to countries in the Middle East, have \nspread. . . . Since last summer, favorable ratings for the U. S. have fallen from 61% to 15% in Indonesia and from \n71% to 38% among Muslims in Nigeria. \"  \n\nMany of these views are at best uninformed about the United States and, at worst, informed by cartoonish \nstereotypes, the coarse expression of a fashionable \"Occidentalism\" among intellectuals who caricature U. S. \nvalues and policies. Local newspapers and the few influential satellite broadcasters - like al Jazeera - often \nreinforce the jihadist theme that portrays the United States as anti-Muslim.  \n\nThe small percentage of Muslims who are fully committed to Usama Bin Ladin's version of Islam are impervious to \npersuasion. It is among the large majority of Arabs and Muslims that we must encourage reform, freedom, \ndemocracy, and opportunity, even though our own promotion of these messages is limited in its effectiveness \nsimply because we are its carriers. Muslims themselves will have to reflect upon such basic issues as the concept \nof jihad, the position of women, and the place of non-Muslim minorities. The United\n\nStates can promote moderation, but cannot ensure its ascendancy. Only Muslims can do this.\n\nThe setting is difficult. The combined gross domestic product of the 22 countries in the Arab League is less than the \nGDP of Spain. Forty percent of adult Arabs are illiterate, two-thirds of them women. One-third of the broader Middle \nEast lives on less than two dollars a day. Less than 2 percent of the population has access to the Internet. The \nmajority of older Arab youths have expressed a desire to emigrate to other countries, particularly those in Europe.  \n\n\n\nIn short, the United States has to help defeat an ideology, not just a group of people, and we must do so under \ndifficult circumstances. How can the United States and its friends help moderate Muslims combat the extremist \nideas?\n\nRecommendation:The U. S. government must define what the message is, what it stands for. We should \noffer an example of moral leadership in the world, committed to treat people humanely, abide by the rule of \nlaw, and be generous and caring to our neighbors. America and Muslim friends can agree on respect for \nhuman dignity and opportunity. To Muslim parents, terrorists like Bin Ladin have nothing to offer their \nchildren but visions of violence and death. America and its friends have a crucial advantage - we can offer \nthese parents a vision that might give their children a better future. If we heed the views of thoughtful \nleaders in the Arab and Muslim world, a moderate consensus can be found. \n\nThat vision of the future should stress life over death: individual educational and economic opportunity. This vision \nincludes widespread political participation and contempt for indiscriminate violence. It includes respect for the rule \nof law, openness in discussing differences, and tolerance for opposing points of view.\n\nRecommendation:Where Muslim governments, even those who are friends, do not respect these principles, \nthe United States must stand for a better future. One of the lessons of the long Cold War was that short-\nterm gains in cooperating with the most repressive and brutal governments were too often outweighed by \nlong-term setbacks for America's stature and interests. \n\nAmerican foreign policy is part of the message. America's policy choices have consequences. Right or wrong, it is \nsimply a fact that American policy regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and American actions in Iraq are \ndominant staples of popular commentary across the Arab and Muslim world. That does not mean U. S. choices \nhave been wrong. It means those choices must be integrated with America's message of opportunity to the Arab \nand Muslim\n\nworld. Neither Israel nor the new Iraq will be safer if worldwide Islamist terrorism grows stronger.\n\nThe United States must do more to communicate its message. Reflecting on Bin Ladin's success in reaching \nMuslim audiences, Richard Holbrooke wondered, \" How can a man in a cave outcommunicate the world's leading \ncommunications society? \" Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage worried to us that Americans have been \n\"exporting our fears and our anger, \"not our vision of opportunity and hope.  \n\nRecommendation: Just as we did in the Cold War, we need to defend our ideals abroad vigorously. America \ndoes stand up for its values. The United States defended, and still defends, Muslims against tyrants and \ncriminals in Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. If the United States does not act aggressively \nto define itself in the Islamic world, the extremists will gladly do the job for us. \n\n     *  Recognizing that Arab and Muslim audiences rely on satellite\n\n        television and radio, the government has begun some promising\n\n        initiatives in television and radio broadcasting to the Arab world,\n\n        Iran, and Afghanistan. These efforts are beginning to reach large\n\n        audiences. The Broadcasting Board of Governors has asked for much\n\n        larger resources. It should get them. \n\n     *  The United States should rebuild the scholarship, exchange, and\n\n        library programs that reach out to young people and offer them\n\n        knowledge and hope. Where such assistance is provided, it should be\n\n\n\n        identified as coming from the citizens of the United States. \n\nAn Agenda of Opportunity \n\nThe United States and its friends can stress educational and economic opportunity. The United Nations has rightly \nequated \"literacy as freedom. \"\n\n     *  The international community is moving toward setting a concrete\n\n        goal - to cut the Middle East region's illiteracy rate in half by\n\n        2010, targeting women and girls and supporting programs for adult\n\n        literacy.\n\n     *  Unglamorous help is needed to support the basics, such as textbooks\n\n        that translate more of the world's knowledge into local languages\n\n        and libraries to house such materials. Education about the outside\n\n        world, or other cultures, is weak.\n\n     *  More vocational education is needed, too, in trades and business\n\n        skills. The Middle East can also benefit from some of the programs\n\n        to bridge the digital divide and increase Internet access that have\n\n        already been developed for other regions of the world.\n\nEducation that teaches tolerance, the dignity and value of each individual, and respect for different beliefs is a key \nelement in any global strategy to eliminate Islamist terrorism.\n\nRecommendation: The U. S. government should offer to join with other nations in generously supporting a \nnew International Youth Opportunity Fund. Funds will be spent directly for building and operating primary \nand secondary schools in those Muslim states that commit to sensibly investing their own money in public \neducation. \n\nEconomic openness is essential. Terrorism is not caused by poverty. Indeed, many terrorists come from relatively \nwell-off families. Yet when people lose hope, when societies break down, when countries fragment, the breeding \ngrounds for terrorism are created. Backward economic policies and repressive political regimes slip into societies \nthat are without hope, where ambition and passions have no constructive outlet.\n\nThe policies that support economic development and reform also have political implications. Economic and political \nliberties tend to be linked. Commerce, especially international commerce, requires ongoing cooperation and \ncompromise, the exchange of ideas across cultures, and the peaceful resolution of differences through negotiation \nor the rule of law. Economic growth expands the middle class, a constituency for further reform. Successful \neconomies rely on vibrant private sectors, which have an interest in curbing indiscriminate government power. \nThose who develop the practice of controlling their own economic destiny soon desire a voice in their communities \nand political societies.\n\nThe U. S. government has announced the goal of working toward a Middle East Free Trade Area, or MEFTA, by \n2013. The United States has been seeking comprehensive free trade agreements (FTAs) with the Middle Eastern \nnations most firmly on the path to reform. The U. S. -Israeli FTA was enacted in 1985, and Congress implemented \nan FTA with Jordan in 2001. Both agreements have expanded trade and investment, thereby supporting domestic \neconomic reform. In 2004, new FTAs were signed with Morocco and Bahrain, and are awaiting congressional \napproval. These models are drawing the interest of their neighbors. Muslim countries can become full participants in \nthe rules-based global trading system, as the United States considers lowering its trade barriers with the poorest \nArab nations.\n\n\n\nRecommendation: A comprehensive U. S. strategy to counter terrorism should include economic policies \nthat encourage development, more open societies, and opportunities for people to improve the lives of \ntheir families and to enhance prospects for their children's future. \n\nTurning a National Strategy into a Coalition Strategy \n\nPractically every aspect of U. S. counterterrorism strategy relies on international cooperation. Since 9/11, these \ncontacts concerning military, law enforcement, intelligence, travel and customs, and financial matters have \nexpanded so dramatically, and often in an ad hoc way, that it is difficult to track these efforts, much less integrate \nthem.\n\nRecommendation: The United States should engage other nations in developing a comprehensive coalition \nstrategy against Islamist terrorism. There are several multilateral institutions in which such issues should \nbe addressed. But the most important policies should be discussed and coordinated in a flexible contact \ngroup of leading coalition governments. This is a good place, for example, to develop joint strategies for \ntargeting terrorist travel, or for hammering out a common strategy for the places where terrorists may be \nfinding sanctuary. \n\nPresently the Muslim and Arab states meet with each other, in organizations such as the Islamic Conference and \nthe Arab League. The Western states meet with each other in organizations such as NATO and the Group of Eight \nsummit of leading industrial nations. A recent G-8 summit initiative to begin a dialogue about reform may be a start \ntoward finding a place where leading Muslim states can discuss - and be seen to discuss - critical policy issues with \nthe leading Western powers committed to the future of the Arab and Muslim world.\n\nThese new international efforts can create durable habits of visible cooperation, as states willing to step up to their \nresponsibilities join together in constructive efforts to direct assistance and coordinate action.\n\nCoalition warfare also requires coalition policies on what to do with enemy captives. Allegations that the United \nStates abused prisoners in its custody make it harder to build the diplomatic, political, and military alliances the \ngovernment will need. The United States should work with friends to develop mutually agreed-on principles for the \ndetention and humane treatment of captured international terrorists who are not being held under a particular \ncountry's criminal laws. Countries such as Britain, Australia, and Muslim friends, are committed to fighting \nterrorists. America should be able to reconcile its views on how to balance humanity and security with our nation's \ncommitment to these same goals.\n\nThe United States and some of its allies do not accept the application of full Geneva Convention treatment of \nprisoners of war to captured terrorists. Those\n\nConventions establish a minimum set of standards for prisoners in internal conflicts. Since the international struggle \nagainst Islamist terrorism is not internal, those provisions do not formally apply, but they are commonly accepted as \nbasic standards for humane treatment.\n\nRecommendation: The United States should engage its friends to develop a common coalition approach \ntoward the detention and humane treatment of captured terrorists. New principles might draw upon Article \n3 of the Geneva Conventions on the law of armed conflict. That article was specifically designed for those \ncases in which the usual laws of war did not apply. Its minimum standards are generally accepted \nthroughout the world as customary international law. \n\nProliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction \n\nThe greatest danger of another catastrophic attack in the United States will materialize if the world's most \ndangerous terrorists acquire the world's most dangerous weapons. As we note in chapter 2, al Qaeda has tried to \n\n\n\nacquire or make nuclear weapons for at least ten years. In chapter 4, we mentioned officials worriedly discussing, \nin 1998, reports that Bin Ladin's associates thought their leader was intent on carrying out a \"Hiroshima. \"\n\nThese ambitions continue. In the public portion of his February 2004 worldwide threat assessment to Congress, \nDCI Tenet noted that Bin Ladin considered the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction to be a \"religious \nobligation. \" He warned that al Qaeda \"continues to pursue its strategic goal of obtaining a nuclear capability. \n\"Tenet added that \"more than two dozen other terrorist groups are pursuing CBRN [chemical, biological, \nradiological, and nuclear] materials. \"  \n\nA nuclear bomb can be built with a relatively small amount of nuclear material. A trained nuclear engineer with an \namount of highly enriched uranium or plutonium about the size of a grapefruit or an orange, together with \ncommercially available material, could fashion a nuclear device that would fit in a van like the one Ramzi Yousef \nparked in the garage of the World Trade Center in 1993. Such a bomb would level Lower Manhattan.  \n\nThe coalition strategies we have discussed to combat Islamist terrorism should therefore be combined with a \nparallel, vital effort to prevent and counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). We recommend \nseveral initiatives in this area.\n\nStrengthen Counterproliferation Efforts . While efforts to shut down Libya's illegal nuclear program have been \ngenerally successful, Pakistan's illicit trade and the nuclear smuggling networks of Pakistani scientist A. Q. Khan \nhave revealed that the spread of nuclear weapons is a problem of global dimensions. Attempts to deal with Iran's \nnuclear program are still underway. Therefore, the\n\nUnited States should work with the international community to develop laws and an international legal regime with \nuniversal jurisdiction to enable the capture, interdiction, and prosecution of such smugglers by any state in the world \nwhere they do not disclose their activities.\n\nExpand the Proliferation Security Initiative . In May 2003, the Bush administration announced the Proliferation \nSecurity Initiative (PSI): nations in a willing partnership combining their national capabilities to use military, \neconomic, and diplomatic tools to interdict threatening shipments of WMD and missile-related technology.\n\nThe PSI can be more effective if it uses intelligence and planning resources of the NATO alliance. Moreover, PSI \nmembership should be open to non- NATO countries. Russia and China should be encouraged to participate.\n\nSupport the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. Outside experts are deeply worried about the U. S. \ngovernment's commitment and approach to securing the weapons and highly dangerous materials still scattered in \nRussia and other countries of the Soviet Union. The government's main instrument in this area, the Cooperative \nThreat Reduction Program (usually referred to as \"Nunn-Lugar, \" after the senators who sponsored the legislation in \n1991), is now in need of expansion, improvement, and resources. The U. S. government has recently redoubled its \ninternational commitments to support this program, and we recommend that the United States do all it can, if Russia \nand other countries will do their part. The government should weigh the value of this investment against the \ncatastrophic cost America would face should such weapons find their way to the terrorists who are so anxious to \nacquire them.\n\nRecommendation: Our report shows that al Qaeda has tried to acquire or make weapons of mass \ndestruction for at least ten years. There is no doubt the United States would be a prime target. Preventing \nthe proliferation of these weapons warrants a maximum effort - by strengthening counterproliferation \nefforts, expanding the Proliferation Security Initiative, and supporting the Cooperative Threat Reduction \nprogram. \n\nTargeting Terrorist Money \n\n\n\nThe general public sees attacks on terrorist finance as a way to \"starve the terrorists of money. \" So, initially, did the \nU. S. government. After 9/11, the United States took aggressive actions to designate terrorist financiers and freeze \ntheir money, in the United States and through resolutions of the United Nations. These actions appeared to have \nlittle effect and, when confronted by legal challenges, the United States and the United Nations were often forced to \nunfreeze assets.\n\nThe difficulty, understood later, was that even if the intelligence community might \"link\" someone to a terrorist group \nthrough acquaintances or communications, the task of tracing the money from that individual to the terrorist group, \nor otherwise showing complicity, was far more difficult. It was harder still to do so without disclosing secrets.\n\nThese early missteps made other countries unwilling to freeze assets or otherwise act merely on the basis of a U. \nS. action. Multilateral freezing mechanisms now require waiting periods before being put into effect, eliminating the \nelement of surprise and thus virtually ensuring that little money is actually frozen. Worldwide asset freezes have not \nbeen adequately enforced and have been easily circumvented, often within weeks, by simple methods.\n\nBut trying to starve the terrorists of money is like trying to catch one kind of fish by draining the ocean. A better \nstrategy has evolved since those early months, as the government learned more about how al Qaeda raises, \nmoves, and spends money.\n\nRecommendation:Vigorous efforts to track terrorist financing must remain front and center in U. S. \ncounterterrorism efforts. The government has recognized that information about terrorist money helps us \nto understand their networks, search them out, and disrupt their operations. Intelligence and law \nenforcement have targeted the relatively small number of financial facilitators - individuals al Qaeda relied \non for their ability to raise and deliver money - at the core of al Qaeda's revenue stream. These efforts have \nworked. The death or capture of several important facilitators has decreased the amount of money \navailable to al Qaeda and has increased its costs and difficulty in raising and moving that money. Captures \nhave additionally provided a windfall of intelligence that can be used to continue the cycle of disruption. \n\nThe U. S. financial community and some international financial institutions have generally provided law enforcement \nand intelligence agencies with extraordinary cooperation, particularly in supplying information to support quickly \ndeveloping investigations. Obvious vulnerabilities in the U. S. financial system have been corrected. The United \nStates has been less successful in persuading other countries to adopt financial regulations that would permit the \ntracing of financial transactions.\n\nPublic designation of terrorist financiers and organizations is still part of the fight, but it is not the primary weapon. \nDesignations are instead a form of diplomacy, as governments join together to identify named individuals and \ngroups as terrorists. They also prevent open fundraising. Some charities that have been identified as likely avenues \nfor terrorist financing have seen their donations\n\ndiminish and their activities come under more scrutiny, and others have been put out of business, although \ncontrolling overseas branches of Gulf-area charities remains a challenge. The Saudi crackdown after the May 2003 \nterrorist attacks in Riyadh has apparently reduced the funds available to al Qaeda - perhaps drastically - but it is too \nsoon to know if this reduction will last.\n\nThough progress apparently has been made, terrorists have shown considerable creativity in their methods of \nmoving money. If al Qaeda is replaced by smaller, decentralized terrorist groups, the premise behind the \ngovernment's efforts - that terrorists need a financial support network - may become outdated. Moreover, some \nterrorist operations do not rely on outside sources of money and may now be self-funding, either through legitimate \nemployment or low-level criminal activity.  \n\n12. 4 PROTECT AGAINST AND PREPARE FOR TERRORIST ATTACKS \n\nIn the nearly three years since 9/11, Americans have become better protected against terrorist attack. Some of the \nchanges are due to government action, such as new precautions to protect aircraft. A portion can be attributed to \nthe sheer scale of spending and effort. Publicity and the vigilance of ordinary Americans also make a difference.\n\n\n\nBut the President and other officials acknowledge that although Americans may be safer, they are not safe. Our \nreport shows that the terrorists analyze defenses. They plan accordingly.\n\nDefenses cannot achieve perfect safety. They make targets harder to attack successfully, and they deter attacks by \nmaking capture more likely. Just increasing the attacker's odds of failure may make the difference between a plan \nattempted, or a plan discarded. The enemy also may have to develop more elaborate plans, thereby increasing the \ndanger of exposure or defeat.\n\nProtective measures also prepare for the attacks that may get through, containing the damage and saving lives.\n\nTerrorist Travel \n\nMore than 500 million people annually cross U. S. borders at legal entry points, about 330 million of them \nnoncitizens. Another 500, 000 or more enter illegally without inspection across America's thousands of miles of land \nborders or remain in the country past the expiration of their permitted stay. The challenge for national security in an \nage of terrorism is to prevent the very few people who may pose overwhelming risks from entering or remaining in \nthe United States undetected.  \n\nIn the decade before September 11, 2001, border security - encompassing\n\nFor terrorists, travel documents are as important as weapons. Terrorists must travel clandestinely to meet, train, \nplan, case targets, and gain access to attack. To them, international travel presents great danger, because they \nmust surface to pass through regulated channels, present themselves to border security officials, or attempt to \ncircumvent inspection points.\n\nIn their travels, terrorists use evasive methods, such as altered and counterfeit passports and visas, specific travel \nmethods and routes, liaisons with corrupt government officials, human smuggling networks, supportive travel \nagencies, and immigration and identity fraud. These can sometimes be detected.\n\nBefore 9/11, no agency of the U. S. government systematically analyzed terrorists' travel strategies. Had they done \nso, they could have discovered the ways in which the terrorist predecessors to al Qaeda had been systematically \nbut detectably exploiting weaknesses in our border security since the early 1990s.\n\nWe found that as many as 15 of the 19 hijackers were potentially vulnerable to interception by border authorities. \nAnalyzing their characteristic travel documents and travel patterns could have allowed authorities to intercept 4 to \n15 hijackers and more effective use of information available in U. S. government databases could have identified up \nto 3 hijackers.  \n\nLooking back, we can also see that the routine operations of our immigration laws - that is, aspects of those laws \nnot specifically aimed at protecting against terrorism - inevitably shaped al Qaeda's planning and opportunities. \nBecause they were deemed not to be bona fide tourists or students as they claimed, five conspirators that we know \nof tried to get visas and failed, and one was denied entry by an inspector. We also found that had the immigration \nsystem set a higher bar for determining whether individuals are who or what they claim to be - and ensuring routine \nconsequences for violations - it could potentially have excluded, removed, or come into further contact with several \nhijackers who did not appear to meet the terms for admitting short-term visitors.  \n\nOur investigation showed that two systemic weaknesses came together in our border system's inability to contribute \nto an effective defense against the 9/11 attacks: a lack of well-developed counterterrorism measures as a part of \nborder security and an immigration system not able to deliver on its basic commitments, much less support \ncounterterrorism. These weaknesses have been reduced but are far from being overcome.\n\nRecommendation:Targeting travel is at least as powerful a weapon against terrorists as targeting their \nmoney. The United States should combine terrorist travel intelligence, operations, and law enforcement in a \nstrategy to intercept terrorists, find terrorist travel facilitators, and constrain terrorist mobility. \n\nSince 9/11, significant improvements have been made to create an integrated watchlist that makes terrorist name \ninformation available to border and law enforcement authorities. However, in the already difficult process of merging \n\n\n\nborder agencies in the new Department of Homeland Security - \"changing the engine while flying\" as one official put \nit   - new insights into terrorist travel have not yet been integrated into the front lines of border security.\n\nThe small terrorist travel intelligence collection and analysis program currently in place has produced \ndisproportionately useful results. It should be expanded. Since officials at the borders encounter travelers and their \ndocuments first and investigate travel facilitators, they must work closely with intelligence officials.\n\nInternationally and in the United States, constraining terrorist travel should become a vital part of counterterrorism \nstrategy. Better technology and training to detect terrorist travel documents are the most important immediate steps \nto reduce America's vulnerability to clandestine entry. Every stage of our border and immigration system should \nhave as a part of its operations the detection of terrorist indicators on travel documents. Information systems able to \nauthenticate travel documents and detect potential terrorist indicators should be used at consulates, at primary \nborder inspection lines, in immigration services offices, and in intelligence and enforcement units. All frontline \npersonnel should receive some training. Dedicated specialists and ongoing linkages with the intelligence community \nare also required. The Homeland Security Department's Directorate of Information Analysis and Infrastructure \nProtection should receive more resources to accomplish its mission as the bridge between the frontline border \nagencies and the rest of the government counterterrorism community.\n\nA Biometric Screening System \n\nWhen people travel internationally, they usually move through defined channels, or portals. They may seek to \nacquire a passport. They may apply for a visa. They stop at ticket counters, gates, and exit controls at airports and \nseaports. Upon arrival, they pass through inspection points. They may transit to another gate to get on an airplane. \nOnce inside the country, they may seek another form of identification and try to enter a government or private \nfacility. They may seek to change immigration status in order to remain.\n\nEach of these checkpoints or portals is a screening - a chance to establish that people are who they say they are \nand are seeking access for their stated purpose, to intercept identifiable suspects, and to take effective action.\n\nThe job of protection is shared among these many defined checkpoints. By taking advantage of them all, we need \nnot depend on any one point in the system to do the whole job. The challenge is to see the common problem \nacross agencies and functions and develop a conceptual framework - an architecture - for an effective screening \nsystem.  \n\nThroughout government, and indeed in private enterprise, agencies and firms at these portals confront recurring \njudgments that balance security, efficiency, and civil liberties. These problems should be addressed systemically, \nnot in an ad hoc, fragmented way. For example:\n\nWhat information is an individual required to present and in what form? A fundamental problem, now \nbeginning to be addressed, is the lack of standardized information in \"feeder\" documents used in identifying \nindividuals. Biometric identifiers that measure unique physical characteristics, such as facial features, fingerprints, \nor iris scans, and reduce them to digitized, numerical statements called algorithms, are just beginning to be used. \nTravel history, however, is still recorded in passports with entry-exit stamps called cachets, which al Qaeda has \ntrained its operatives to forge and use to conceal their terrorist activities.\n\nHow will the individual and the information be checked? There are many databases just in the United States - \nfor terrorist, criminal, and immigration history, as well as financial information, for instance. Each is set up for \ndifferent purposes and stores different kinds of data, under varying rules of access. Nor is access always \nguaranteed. Acquiring information held by foreign governments may require painstaking negotiations, and records \nthat are not yet digitized are difficult to search or analyze. The development of terrorist indicators has hardly begun, \nand behavioral cues remain important.\n\n\n\nWho will screen individuals, and what will they be trained to do? A wide range of border, immigration, and law \nenforcement officials encounter visitors and immigrants and they are given little training in terrorist travel \nintelligence . Fraudulent travel documents, for instance, are usually returned to travelers who are denied entry \nwithout further examination for terrorist trademarks, investigation as to their source, or legal process.\n\nWhat are the consequences of finding a suspicious indicator, and who will take action? One risk is that \nresponses may be ineffective or produce no further information. Four of the 9/11 attackers were pulled into \nsecondary border inspection, but then admitted. More than half of the 19 hijackers were flagged by the Federal \nAviation Administration's profiling system when they arrived for their flights, but the consequence was that bags, not \npeople, were\n\nchecked. Competing risks include \"false positives, \"or the danger that rules may be applied with insufficient training \nor judgment. Overreactions can impose high costs too - on individuals, our economy, and our beliefs about justice.\n\n     *  A special note on the importance of trusting subjective judgment:\n\n        One potential hijacker was turned back by an immigration inspector\n\n        as he tried to enter the United States. The inspector relied on\n\n        intuitive experience to ask questions more than he relied on any\n\n        objective factor that could be detected by \"scores\" or a machine.\n\n        Good people who have worked in such jobs for a long time understand\n\n        this phenomenon well. Other evidence we obtained confirmed the\n\n        importance of letting experienced gate agents or security screeners\n\n        ask questions and use their judgment. This is not an invitation to\n\n        arbitrary exclusions. But any effective system has to grant some\n\n        scope, perhaps in a little extra inspection or one more check, to\n\n        the instincts and discretion of well trained human beings.\n\nRecommendation: The U. S. border security system should be integrated into a larger network of screening \npoints that includes our transportation system and access to vital facilities, such as nuclear reactors. The \nPresident should direct the Department of Homeland Security to lead the effort to design a comprehensive \nscreening system, addressing common problems and setting common standards with systemwide goals in \nmind. Extending those standards among other governments could dramatically strengthen America and \nthe world's collective ability to intercept individuals who pose catastrophic threats. \n\nWe advocate a system for screening, not categorical profiling. A screening system looks for particular, identifiable \nsuspects or indicators of risk. It does not involve guesswork about who might be dangerous. It requires frontline \nborder officials who have the tools and resources to establish that people are who they say they are, intercept \nidentifiable suspects, and disrupt terrorist operations.\n\nThe U. S. Border Screening System \n\nThe border and immigration system of the United States must remain a visible manifestation of our belief in \nfreedom, democracy, global economic growth, and the rule of law, yet serve equally well as a vital element of \ncounterterrorism. Integrating terrorist travel information in the ways we have described is the most immediate need. \nBut the underlying system must also be sound.\n\n\n\nSince September 11, the United States has built the first phase of a biometric screening program, called US VISIT \n(the United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology program). It takes two biometric\n\nidentifiers - digital photographs and prints of two index fingers - from travelers . False identities are used by \nterrorists to avoid being detected on a watchlist. These biometric identifiers make such evasions far more difficult.\n\nSo far, however, only visitors who acquire visas to travel to the United States are covered. While visitors from \"visa \nwaiver\" countries will be added to the program, beginning this year, covered travelers will still constitute only about \n12 percent of all noncitizens crossing U. S. borders. Moreover, exit data are not uniformly collected and entry data \nare not fully automated. It is not clear the system can be installed before 2010, but even this timetable may be too \nslow, given the possible security dangers.  \n\n     *  Americans should not be exempt from carrying biometric passports or\n\n        otherwise enabling their identities to be securely verified when\n\n        they enter the United States; nor should Canadians or Mexicans.\n\n        Currently U. S. persons are exempt from carrying passports when\n\n        returning from Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. The current\n\n        system enables non-U. S. citizens to gain entry by showing minimal\n\n        identification. The 9/11 experience shows that terrorists study and\n\n        exploit America's vulnerabilities.\n\n     *  To balance this measure, programs to speed known travelers should\n\n        be a higher priority, permitting inspectors to focus on greater\n\n        risks. The daily commuter should not be subject to the same\n\n        measures as first-time travelers. An individual should be able to\n\n        preenroll, with his or her identity verified in passage. Updates of\n\n        database information and other checks can ensure ongoing\n\n        reliability. The solution, requiring more research and development,\n\n        is likely to combine radio frequency technology with biometric\n\n        identifiers.\n\n     *  The current patchwork of border screening systems, including\n\n        several frequent traveler programs, should be consolidated with the\n\n        US VISIT system to enable the development of an integrated system,\n\n        which in turn can become part of the wider screening plan we\n\n        suggest.\n\n     *  The program allowing individuals to travel from foreign countries\n\n        through the United States to a third country, without having to\n\n        obtain a U. S. visa, has been suspended. Because \"transit without\n\n        visa\" can be exploited by terrorists to enter the United States,\n\n        the program should not be reinstated unless and until transit\n\n        passage areas can be fully secured to prevent passengers from\n\n        illegally exiting the airport.\n\n\n\nInspectors adjudicating entries of the 9/11 hijackers lacked adequate information and knowledge of the rules. All \npoints in the border system - from consular offices to immigration services offices - will need appropriate electronic \naccess to an individual's file. Scattered units at Homeland Security and the State\n\nDepartment perform screening and data mining: instead, a government-wide team of border and transportation \nofficials should be working together. A modern border and immigration system should combine a biometric entry-\nexit system with accessible files on visitors and immigrants, along with intelligence on indicators of terrorist travel.\n\nOur border screening system should check people efficiently and welcome friends. Admitting large numbers of \nstudents, scholars, businesspeople, and tourists fuels our economy, cultural vitality, and political reach. There is \nevidence that the present system is disrupting travel to the United States. Overall, visa applications in 2003 were \ndown over 32 percent since 2001. In the Middle East, they declined about 46 percent. Training and the design of \nsecurity measures should be continuously adjusted.  \n\nRecommendation:The Department of Homeland Security, properly supported by the Congress, should \ncomplete, as quickly as possible, a biometric entry-exit screening system, including a single system for \nspeeding qualified travelers. It should be integrated with the system that provides benefits to foreigners \nseeking to stay in the United States. Linking biometric passports to good data systems and \ndecisionmaking is a fundamental goal. No one can hide his or her debt by acquiring a credit card with a \nslightly different name. Yet today, a terrorist can defeat the link to electronic records by tossing away an \nold passport and slightly altering the name in the new one. \n\nCompletion of the entry-exit system is a major and expensive challenge. Biometrics have been introduced into an \nantiquated computer environment. Replacement of these systems and improved biometric systems will be required. \nNonetheless, funding and completing a biometrics-based entry-exit system is an essential investment in our \nnational security.\n\nExchanging terrorist information with other countries, consistent with privacy requirements, along with listings of lost \nand stolen passports, will have immediate security benefits. We should move toward real-time verification of \npassports with issuing authorities. The further away from our borders that screening occurs, the more security \nbenefits we gain. At least some screening should occur before a passenger departs on a flight destined for the \nUnited States. We should also work with other countries to ensure effective inspection regimes at all airports.  \n\nThe international community arrives at international standards for the design of passports through the International \nCivil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The global standard for identification is a digital photograph; fingerprints are \noptional. We must work with others to improve passport standards and provide foreign assistance to countries that \nneed help in making the transition.  \n\nRecommendation: The U. S. government cannot meet its own obligations to the American people to \nprevent the entry of terrorists without a major effort to collaborate with other governments. We should do \nmore to exchange terrorist information with trusted allies, and raise U. S. and global border security \nstandards for travel and border crossing over the medium and long term through extensive international \ncooperation. \n\nImmigration Law and Enforcement \n\nOur borders and immigration system, including law enforcement, ought to send a message of welcome, tolerance, \nand justice to members of immigrant communities in the United States and in their countries of origin. We should \nreach out to immigrant communities. Good immigration services are one way of doing so that is valuable in every \nway - including intelligence.\n\nIt is elemental to border security to know who is coming into the country. Today more than 9 million people are in \nthe United States outside the legal immigration system. We must also be able to monitor and respond to entrances \nbetween our ports of entry, working with Canada and Mexico as much as possible.\n\n\n\nThere is a growing role for state and local law enforcement agencies. They need more training and work with \nfederal agencies so that they can cooperate more effectively with those federal authorities in identifying terrorist \nsuspects.\n\nAll but one of the 9/11 hijackers acquired some form of U. S. identification document, some by fraud. Acquisition of \nthese forms of identification would have assisted them in boarding commercial flights, renting cars, and other \nnecessary activities.\n\nRecommendation: Secure identification should begin in the United States. The federal government should \nset standards for the issuance of birth certificates and sources of identification, such as drivers licenses. \nFraud in identification documents is no longer just a problem of theft. At many entry points to vulnerable \nfacilities, including gates for boarding aircraft, sources of identification are the last opportunity to ensure \nthat people are who they say they are and to check whether they are terrorists.   \n\nStrategies for Aviation and Transportation Security \n\nThe U. S. transportation system is vast and, in an open society, impossible to secure completely against terrorist \nattacks. There are hundreds of commercial airports, thousands of planes, and tens of thousands of daily flights \ncarrying more than half a billion passengers a year. Millions of containers are imported annually through more than \n300 sea and river ports served by more than 3, 700 cargo and passenger terminals. About 6, 000 agencies provide \ntransit services\n\nthrough buses, subways, ferries, and light-rail service to about 14 million Americans each weekday.  \n\nIn November 2001, Congress passed and the President signed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act. This \nact created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which is now part of the Homeland Security \nDepartment. In November 2002, both the Homeland Security Act and the Maritime Transportation Security Act \nfollowed. These laws required the development of strategic plans to describe how the new department and TSA \nwould provide security for critical parts of the U. S. transportation sector.\n\nOver 90 percent of the nation's $5. 3 billion annual investment in the TSA goes to aviation - to fight the last war. The \nmoney has been spent mainly to meet congressional mandates to federalize the security checkpoint screeners and \nto deploy existing security methods and technologies at airports. The current efforts do not yet reflect a forward-\nlooking strategic plan systematically analyzing assets, risks, costs, and benefits. Lacking such a plan, we are not \nconvinced that our transportation security resources are being allocated to the greatest risks in a cost-effective way.\n\n     *  Major vulnerabilities still exist in cargo and general aviation\n\n        security. These, together with inadequate screening and access\n\n        controls, continue to present aviation security challenges.\n\n     *  While commercial aviation remains a possible target, terrorists may\n\n        turn their attention to other modes. Opportunities to do harm are\n\n        as great, or greater, in maritime or surface transportation.\n\n        Initiatives to secure shipping containers have just begun. Surface\n\n        transportation systems such as railroads and mass transit remain\n\n        hard to protect because they are so accessible and extensive.\n\nDespite congressional deadlines, the TSA has developed neither an integrated strategic plan for the transportation \nsector nor specific plans for the various modes - air, sea, and ground.\n\nRecommendation: Hard choices must be made in allocating limited resources. The U. S. government \n\n\n\nshould identify and evaluate the transportation assets that need to be protected, set risk-based priorities \nfor defending them, select the most practical and cost-effective ways of doing so, and then develop a plan, \nbudget, and funding to implement the effort. The plan should assign roles and missions to the relevant \nauthorities (federal, state, regional, and local) and to private stakeholders. In measuring effectiveness, \nperfection is unattainable. But terrorists should perceive that potential targets are defended. They may be \ndeterred by a significant chance of failure. \n\nCongress should set a specific date for the completion of these plans and hold the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and TSA accountable for achieving them.\n\nThe most powerful investments may be for improvements in technologies with applications across the \ntransportation modes, such as scanning technologies designed to screen containers that can be transported by \nplane, ship, truck, or rail. Though such technologies are becoming available now, widespread deployment is still \nyears away.\n\nIn the meantime, the best protective measures may be to combine improved methods of identifying and tracking the \nhigh-risk containers, operators, and facilities that require added scrutiny with further efforts to integrate intelligence \nanalysis, effective procedures for transmitting threat information to transportation authorities, and vigilance by \ntransportation authorities and the public.\n\nA Layered Security System \n\nNo single security measure is foolproof. Accordingly, the TSA must have multiple layers of security in place to \ndefeat the more plausible and dangerous forms of attack against public transportation.\n\n     *  The plan must take into consideration the full array of possible\n\n        enemy tactics, such as use of insiders, suicide terrorism, or\n\n        standoff attack. Each layer must be effective in its own right.\n\n        Each must be supported by other layers that are redundant and\n\n        coordinated.\n\n     *  The TSA should be able to identify for Congress the array of\n\n        potential terrorist attacks, the layers of security in place, and\n\n        the reliability provided by each layer. TSA must develop a plan as\n\n        described above to improve weak individual layers and the\n\n        effectiveness of the layered systems it deploys.\n\nOn 9/11, the 19 hijackers were screened by a computer-assisted screening system called CAPPS. More than half \nwere identified for further inspection, which applied only to their checked luggage.\n\nUnder current practices, air carriers enforce government orders to stop certain known and suspected terrorists \nfrom boarding commercial flights and to apply secondary screening procedures to others. The \"no-fly\" and \n\"automatic selectee\" lists include only those individuals who the U. S. government believes pose a direct threat of \nattacking aviation.\n\nBecause air carriers implement the program, concerns about sharing intelligence information with private firms and \nforeign countries keep the U. S. government from listing all terrorist and terrorist suspects who should be included. \nThe TSA has planned to take over this function when it deploys a new screening system to take the place of \nCAPPS. The deployment of this system has been delayed because of claims it may violate civil liberties.\n\nRecommendation: Improved use of \"no-fly\" and \"automatic selectee\" lists should not be delayed while the \nargument about a successor to CAPPS continues. This screening function should be performed by the \n\n\n\nTSA, and it should utilize the larger set of watchlists maintained by the federal government. Air carriers \nshould be required to supply the information needed to test and implement this new system. \n\nCAPPS is still part of the screening process, still profiling passengers, with the consequences of selection now \nincluding personal searches of the individual and carry-on bags. The TSA is dealing with the kind of screening \nissues that are being encountered by other agencies. As we mentioned earlier, these screening issues need to be \nelevated for high-level attention and addressed promptly by the government. Working through these problems can \nhelp clear the way for the TSA's screening improvements and would help many other agencies too.\n\nThe next layer is the screening checkpoint itself. As the screening system tries to stop dangerous people, the \ncheckpoint needs to be able to find dangerous items. Two reforms are needed soon: (1) screening people for \nexplosives, not just their carry-on bags, and (2) improving screener performance.\n\nRecommendation: The TSA and the Congress must give priority attention to improving the ability of \nscreening checkpoints to detect explosives on passengers. As a start, each individual selected for special \nscreening should be screened for explosives. Further, the TSA should conduct a human factors study, a \nmethod often used in the private sector, to understand problems in screener performance and set \nattainable objectives for individual screeners and for the checkpoints where screening takes place. \n\nConcerns also remain regarding the screening and transport of checked bags and cargo. More attention and \nresources should be directed to reducing or mitigating the threat posed by explosives in vessels' cargo holds. The \nTSA should expedite the installation of advanced (in-line) baggage-screening equipment. Because the aviation \nindustry will derive substantial benefits from this deployment, it should pay a fair share of the costs. The TSA should \nrequire that every passenger aircraft carrying cargo must deploy at least one hardened container to carry any \nsuspect cargo. TSA also needs to intensify its efforts to identify, track, and appropriately screen potentially \ndangerous cargo in both the aviation and maritime sectors.\n\nThe Protection of Civil Liberties \n\nMany of our recommendations call for the government to increase its presence in our lives - for example, by \ncreating standards for the issuance of forms of\n\nidentification, by better securing our borders, by sharing information gathered by many different agencies. We also \nrecommend the consolidation of authority over the now far-flung entities constituting the intelligence community. \nThe Patriot Act vests substantial powers in our federal government. We have seen the government use the \nimmigration laws as a tool in its counterterrorism effort. Even without the changes we recommend, the American \npublic has vested enormous authority in the U. S. government.\n\nAt our first public hearing on March 31, 2003, we noted the need for balance as our government responds to the \nreal and ongoing threat of terrorist attacks. The terrorists have used our open society against us. In wartime, \ngovernment calls for greater powers, and then the need for those powers recedes after the war ends. This struggle \nwill go on. Therefore, while protecting our homeland, Americans should be mindful of threats to vital personal and \ncivil liberties. This balancing is no easy task, but we must constantly strive to keep it right.\n\nThis shift of power and authority to the government calls for an enhanced system of checks and balances to protect \nthe precious liberties that are vital to our way of life. We therefore make three recommendations.\n\nFirst, as we will discuss in chapter 13, to open up the sharing of information across so many agencies and with the \nprivate sector, the President should take responsibility for determining what information can be shared by which \nagencies and under what conditions. Protection of privacy rights should be one key element of this determination.\n\nRecommendation: As the President determines the guidelines for information sharing among government \nagencies and by those agencies with the private sector, he should safeguard the privacy of individuals \nabout whom information is shared. \n\n\n\nSecond, Congress responded, in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, with the Patriot Act, which vested substantial \nnew powers in the investigative agencies of the government. Some of the most controversial provisions of the \nPatriot Act are to \"sunset\" at the end of 2005. Many of the act's provisions are relatively noncontroversial, updating \nAmerica's surveillance laws to reflect technological developments in a digital age. Some executive actions that have \nbeen criticized are unrelated to the Patriot Act. The provisions in the act that facilitate the sharing of information \namong intelligence agencies and between law enforcement and intelligence appear, on balance, to be beneficial. \nBecause of concerns regarding the shifting balance of power to the government, we think that a full and informed \ndebate on the Patriot Act would be healthy.\n\nRecommendation:The burden of proof for retaining a particular governmental power should be on the \nexecutive, to explain (a) that the power actually materially enhances security and (b) that there is ade- \n\nquate supervision of the executive's use of the powers to ensure protection of civil liberties. If the power is \ngranted, there must be adequate guidelines and oversight to properly confine its use. \n\nThird, during the course of our inquiry, we were told that there is no office within the government whose job it is to \nlook across the government at the actions we are taking to protect ourselves to ensure that liberty concerns are \nappropriately considered. If, as we recommend, there is substantial change in the way we collect and share \nintelligence, there should be a voice within the executive branch for those concerns. Many agencies have privacy \noffices, albeit of limited scope. The Intelligence Oversight Board of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory \nBoard has, in the past, had the job of overseeing certain activities of the intelligence community.\n\nRecommendation: At this time of increased and consolidated government authority, there should be a \nboard within the executive branch to oversee adherence to the guidelines we recommend and the \ncommitment the government makes to defend our civil liberties. \n\nWe must find ways of reconciling security with liberty, since the success of one helps protect the other. The choice \nbetween security and liberty is a false choice, as nothing is more likely to endanger America's liberties than the \nsuccess of a terrorist attack at home. Our history has shown us that insecurity threatens liberty. Yet, if our liberties \nare curtailed, we lose the values that we are struggling to defend.\n\nSetting Priorities for National Preparedness \n\nBefore 9/11, no executive department had, as its first priority, the job of defending America from domestic attack. \nThat changed with the 2002 creation of the Department of Homeland Security. This department now has the lead \nresponsibility for problems that feature so prominently in the 9/11 story, such as protecting borders, securing \ntransportation and other parts of our critical infrastructure, organizing emergency assistance, and working with the \nprivate sector to assess vulnerabilities.\n\nThroughout the government, nothing has been harder for officials - executive or legislative - than to set priorities, \nmaking hard choices in allocating limited resources. These difficulties have certainly afflicted the Department of \nHomeland Security, hamstrung by its many congressional overseers. In delivering assistance to state and local \ngovernments, we heard - especially in New York - about imbalances in the allocation of money. The argument \nconcentrates on two questions.\n\nFirst, how much money should be set aside for criteria not directly related to risk? Currently a major portion of the \nbillions of dollars appropriated for\n\nstate and local assistance is allocated so that each state gets a certain amount, or an allocation based on its \npopulation - wherever they live.\n\n\n\nRecommendation: Homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an assessment of risks and \nvulnerabilities. Now, in 2004, Washington, D. C. , and New York City are certainly at the top of any such list. \nWe understand the contention that every state and city needs to have some minimum infrastructure for \nemergency response. But federal homeland security assistance should not remain a program for general \nrevenue sharing. It should supplement state and local resources based on the risks or vulnerabilities that \nmerit additional support. Congress should not use this money as a pork barrel. \n\nThe second question is, Can useful criteria to measure risk and vulnerability be developed that assess all the many \nvariables? The allocation of funds should be based on an assessment of threats and vulnerabilities. That \nassessment should consider such factors as population, population density, vulnerability, and the presence of \ncritical infrastructure within each state. In addition, the federal government should require each state receiving \nfederal emergency preparedness funds to provide an analysis based on the same criteria to justify the distribution \nof funds in that state.\n\nIn a free-for-all over money, it is understandable that representatives will work to protect the interests of their home \nstates or districts. But this issue is too important for politics as usual to prevail. Resources must be allocated \naccording to vulnerabilities. We recommend that a panel of security experts be convened to develop written \nbenchmarks for evaluating community needs. We further recommend that federal homeland security funds be \nallocated in accordance with those benchmarks, and that states be required to abide by those benchmarks in \ndisbursing the federal funds. The benchmarks will be imperfect and subjective; they will continually evolve. But hard \nchoices must be made. Those who would allocate money on a different basis should then defend their view of the \nnational interest.\n\nCommand, Control, and Communications \n\nThe attacks on 9/11 demonstrated that even the most robust emergency response capabilities can be overwhelmed \nif an attack is large enough. Teamwork, collaboration, and cooperation at an incident site are critical to a successful \nresponse. Key decisionmakers who are represented at the incident command level help to ensure an effective \nresponse, the efficient use of resources, and responder safety. Regular joint training at all levels is, moreover, \nessential to ensuring close coordination during an actual incident.\n\nThe attacks of September 11, 2001 overwhelmed the response capacity of most of the local jurisdictions where the \nhijacked airliners crashed. While many jurisdictions have established mutual aid compacts, a serious obstacle to \nmultijurisdictional response has been the lack of indemnification for mutual-aid responders in areas such as the \nNational Capital Region.\n\nPublic safety organizations, chief administrative officers, state emergency management agencies, and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security should develop a regional focus within the emergency responder community and \npromote multi-jurisdictional mutual assistance compacts. Where such compacts already exist, training in \naccordance with their terms should be required. Congress should pass legislation to remedy the long-standing \nindemnification and liability impediments to the provision of public safety mutual aid in the National Capital Region \nand where applicable throughout the nation.\n\nThe inability to communicate was a critical element at the World Trade Center, Pentagon, and Somerset County, \nPennsylvania, crash sites, where multiple agencies and multiple jurisdictions responded. The occurrence of this \nproblem at three very different sites is strong evidence that compatible and adequate communications among public \nsafety organizations at the local, state, and federal levels remains an important problem.\n\nRecommendation: Congress should support pending legislation which provides for the expedited and \nincreased assignment of radio spectrum for public safety purposes. Furthermore, high-risk urban areas \nsuch as New York City and Washington, D. C. , should establish signal corps units to ensure \ncommunications connectivity between and among civilian authorities, local first responders, and the \nNational Guard. Federal funding of such units should be given high priority by Congress. \n\n\n\nPrivate-Sector Preparedness \n\nThe mandate of the Department of Homeland Security does not end with government; the department is also \nresponsible for working with the private\n\nsector to ensure preparedness. This is entirely appropriate, for the private sector controls 85 percent of the critical \ninfrastructure in the nation. Indeed, unless a terrorist's target is a military or other secure government facility, the \n\"first\" first responders will almost certainly be civilians. Homeland security and national preparedness therefore \noften begins with the private sector.\n\nPreparedness in the private sector and public sector for rescue, restart, and recovery of operations should include \n(1) a plan for evacuation, (2) adequate communications capabilities, and (3) a plan for continuity of operations. As \nwe examined the emergency response to 9/11, witness after witness told us that despite 9/11, the private sector \nremains largely unprepared for a terrorist attack. We were also advised that the lack of a widely embraced private-\nsector preparedness standard was a principal contributing factor to this lack of preparedness.\n\nWe responded by asking the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) to develop a consensus on a \"National \nStandard for Preparedness\" for the private sector. ANSI convened safety, security, and business continuity experts \nfrom a wide range of industries and associations, as well as from federal, state, and local government stakeholders, \nto consider the need for standards for private sector emergency preparedness and business continuity.\n\nThe result of these sessions was ANSI's recommendation that the Commission endorse a voluntary National \nPreparedness Standard. Based on the existing American National Standard on Disaster/Emergency Management \nand Business Continuity Programs (NFPA 1600), the proposed National Preparedness Standard establishes a \ncommon set of criteria and terminology for preparedness, disaster management, emergency management, and \nbusiness continuity programs. The experience of the private sector in the World Trade Center emergency \ndemonstrated the need for these standards.\n\nRecommendation: We endorse the American National Standards Institute's recommended standard for \nprivate preparedness. We were encouraged by Secretary Tom Ridge's praise of the standard, and urge the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to promote its adoption. We also encourage the insurance and credit-\nrating industries to look closely at a company's compliance with the ANSI standard in assessing its \ninsurability and creditworthiness. We believe that compliance with the standard should define the standard \nof care owed by a company to its employees and the public for legal purposes. Private-sector \npreparedness is not a luxury; it is a cost of doing business in the post-9/11 world. It is ignored at a \ntremendous potential cost in lives, money, and national security. \n\n13 HOW TO DO IT? A DIFFERENT WAY OF ORGANIZING THE GOVERNMENT \n\nAs presently configured, the national security institutions of the U. S. government are still the institutions \nconstructed to win the Cold War. The United States confronts a very different world today. Instead of facing a few \nvery dangerous adversaries, the United States confronts a number of less visible challenges that surpass the \nboundaries of traditional nation-states and call for quick, imaginative, and agile responses.\n\nThe men and women of the World War II generation rose to the challenges of the 1940s and 1950s. They \nrestructured the government so that it could protect the country. That is now the job of the generation that \nexperienced 9/11. Those attacks showed, emphatically, that ways of doing business rooted in a different era are \njust not good enough. Americans should not settle for incremental, ad hoc adjustments to a system designed \ngenerations ago for a world that no longer exists.\n\nWe recommend significant changes in the organization of the government. We know that the quality of the people is \nmore important than the quality of the wiring diagrams. Some of the saddest aspects of the 9/11 story are the \noutstanding efforts of so many individual officials straining, often without success, against the boundaries of the \npossible. Good people can overcome bad structures. They should not have to.\n\n\n\nThe United States has the resources and the people. The government should combine them more effectively, \nachieving unity of effort. We offer five major recommendations to do that:\n\n     *  unifying strategic intelligence and operational planning against\n\n        Islamist terrorists across the foreign-domestic divide with a\n\n        National Counterterrorism Center;\n\n     *  unifying the intelligence community with a new National\n\n        Intelligence Director;\n\n     *  unifying the many participants in the counterterrorism effort and\n\n        their knowledge in a network-based information-sharing system that\n\n        transcends traditional governmental boundaries;\n\n     *  unifying and strengthening congressional oversight to improve\n\n        quality and accountability; and\n\n     *  strengthening the FBI and homeland defenders.\n\n13. 1 UNITY OF EFFORT ACROSS THE FOREIGN-DOMESTIC DIVIDE \n\nJoint Action \n\nMuch of the public commentary about the 9/11 attacks has dealt with \"lost opportunities, \"some of which we \nreviewed in chapter 11. These are often characterized as problems of \"watchlisting, \" of \"information sharing, \" or of \n\"connecting the dots. \" In chapter 11 we explained that these labels are too narrow. They describe the symptoms, \nnot the disease.\n\nIn each of our examples, no one was firmly in charge of managing the case and able to draw relevant intelligence \nfrom anywhere in the government, assign responsibilities across the agencies (foreign or domestic), track progress, \nand quickly bring obstacles up to the level where they could be resolved. Responsibility and accountability were \ndiffuse.\n\nThe agencies cooperated, some of the time. But even such cooperation as there was is not the same thing as joint \naction. When agencies cooperate, one defines the problem and seeks help with it. When they act jointly, the \nproblem and options for action are defined differently from the start. Individuals from different backgrounds come \ntogether in analyzing a case and planning how to manage it.\n\nIn our hearings we regularly asked witnesses:Who is the quarterback? The other players are in their positions, \ndoing their jobs. But who is calling the play that assigns roles to help them execute as a team?\n\nSince 9/11, those issues have not been resolved. In some ways joint work has gotten better, and in some ways \nworse. The effort of fighting terrorism has flooded over many of the usual agency boundaries because of its sheer \nquantity and energy. Attitudes have changed. Officials are keenly conscious of trying to avoid the mistakes of 9/11. \nThey try to share information. They circulate - even to the President - practically every reported threat, however \ndubious.\n\nPartly because of all this effort, the challenge of coordinating it has multiplied. Before 9/11, the CIA was plainly the \nlead agency confronting al Qaeda. The FBI played a very secondary role. The engagement of the departments of \nDefense and State was more episodic.\n\n     *  Today the CIA is still central. But the FBI is much more active,\n\n        along with other parts of the Justice Department.\n\n     *  The Defense Department effort is now enormous. Three of its unified\n\n\n\n        commands, each headed by a four-star general, have counterterrorism\n\n        as a primary mission: Special Operations Command, Central Command\n\n        (both headquartered in Florida), and Northern Command\n\n        (headquartered in Colorado).\n\n     *  A new Department of Homeland Security combines formidable resources\n\n        in border and transportation security, along with analysis of\n\n        domestic vulnerability and other tasks.\n\n     *  The State Department has the lead on many of the foreign policy\n\n        tasks we described in chapter 12.\n\n     *  At the White House, the National Security Council (NSC) now is\n\n        joined by a parallel presidential advisory structure, the Homeland\n\n        Security Council.\n\nSo far we have mentioned two reasons for joint action - the virtue of joint planning and the advantage of having \nsomeone in charge to ensure a unified effort. There is a third: the simple shortage of experts with sufficient skills. \nThe limited pool of critical experts - for example, skilled counterterrorism analysts and linguists - is being depleted. \nExpanding these capabilities will require not just money, but time.\n\nPrimary responsibility for terrorism analysis has been assigned to the Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC), \ncreated in 2003, based at the CIA headquarters but staffed with representatives of many agencies, reporting \ndirectly to the Director of Central Intelligence. Yet the CIA houses another intelligence \"fusion\" center: the \nCounterterrorist Center that played such a key role before 9/11. A third major analytic unit is at Defense, in the \nDefense Intelligence Agency. A fourth, concentrating more on homeland vulnerabilities, is at the Department of \nHomeland Security. The FBI is in the process of building the analytic capability it has long lacked, and it also has \nthe Terrorist Screening Center.  \n\nThe U. S. government cannot afford so much duplication of effort. There are not enough experienced experts to go \naround. The duplication also places extra demands on already hard-pressed single-source national technical \nintelligence collectors like the National Security Agency.\n\nCombining Joint Intelligence and Joint Action \n\nA \"smart\"government would integrate all sources of information to see the enemy as a whole. Integrated all-source \nanalysis should also inform and shape strategies to collect more intelligence. Yet the Terrorist Threat Integration \nCenter, while it has primary responsibility for terrorism analysis, is formally proscribed from hav-\n\ning any oversight or operational authority and is not part of any operational entity, other than reporting to the \ndirector of central intelligence.  \n\nThe government now tries to handle the problem of joint management, informed by analysis of intelligence from all \nsources, in two ways.\n\n     *  First, agencies with lead responsibility for certain problems have\n\n        constructed their own interagency entities and task forces in order\n\n        to get cooperation. The Counterterrorist Center at CIA, for\n\n        example, recruits liaison officers from throughout the intelligence\n\n        community. The military's Central Command has its own interagency\n\n        center, recruiting liaison officers from all the agencies from\n\n\n\n        which it might need help. The FBI has Joint Terrorism Task Forces\n\n        in 84 locations to coordinate the activities of other agencies when\n\n        action may be required.\n\n     *  Second, the problem of joint operational planning is often passed\n\n        to the White House, where the NSC staff tries to play this role.\n\n        The national security staff at the White House (both NSC and new\n\n        Homeland Security Council staff) has already become 50 percent\n\n        larger since 9/11. But our impression, after talking to serving\n\n        officials, is that even this enlarged staff is consumed by meetings\n\n        on day-to-day issues, sifting each day's threat information and\n\n        trying to coordinate everyday operations.\n\nEven as it crowds into every square inch of available office space, the NSC staff is still not sized or funded to be an \nexecutive agency. In chapter 3 we described some of the problems that arose in the 1980s when a White House \nstaff, constitutionally insulated from the usual mechanisms of oversight, became involved in direct operations. \nDuring the 1990s Richard Clarke occasionally tried to exercise such authority, sometimes successfully, but often \ncausing friction.\n\nYet a subtler and more serious danger is that as the NSC staff is consumed by these day-to-day tasks, it has less \ncapacity to find the time and detachment needed to advise a president on larger policy issues. That means less \ntime to work on major new initiatives, help with legislative management to steer needed bills through Congress, and \ntrack the design and implementation of the strategic plans for regions, countries, and issues that we discuss in \nchapter 12.\n\nMuch of the job of operational coordination remains with the agencies, especially the CIA. There DCI Tenet and his \nchief aides ran interagency meetings nearly every day to coordinate much of the government's day-to-day work. \nThe DCI insisted he did not make policy and only oversaw its implementation. In the struggle against terrorism \nthese distinctions seem increasingly artificial. Also, as the DCI becomes a lead coordinator of the government's\n\noperations, it becomes harder to play all the position's other roles, including that of analyst in chief.\n\nThe problem is nearly intractable because of the way the government is currently structured. Lines of operational \nauthority run to the expanding executive departments, and they are guarded for understandable reasons: the DCI \ncommands the CIA's personnel overseas; the secretary of defense will not yield to others in conveying commands \nto military forces; the Justice Department will not give up the responsibility of deciding whether to seek arrest \nwarrants. But the result is that each agency or department needs its own intelligence apparatus to support the \nperformance of its duties. It is hard to \"break down stovepipes\" when there are so many stoves that are legally and \npolitically entitled to have cast-iron pipes of their own.\n\nRecalling the Goldwater-Nichols legislation of 1986, Secretary Rumsfeld reminded us that to achieve better joint \ncapability, each of the armed services had to \"give up some of their turf and authorities and prerogatives. \"Today, \nhe said, the executive branch is \"stove-piped much like the four services were nearly 20 years ago. \" He wondered \nif it might be appropriate to ask agencies to \"give up some of their existing turf and authority in exchange for a \nstronger, faster, more efficient government wide joint effort. \"   Privately, other key officials have made the same \npoint to us.\n\nWe therefore propose a new institution: a civilian-led unified joint command for counterterrorism. It should \ncombinestrategic intelligence and joint operational planning.\n\nIn the Pentagon's Joint Staff, which serves the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, intelligence is handled by the J-\n2 directorate, operational planning by J-3, and overall policy by J-5. Our concept combines the J-2 and J-3 functions \n\n\n\n(intelligence and operational planning) in one agency, keeping overall policy coordination where it belongs, in the \nNational Security Council.\n\nRecommendation:We recommend the establishment of a National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), built on \nthe foundation of the existing Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC). Breaking the older mold of national \ngovernment organization, this NCTC should be a center for joint operational planning  and joint \nintelligence, staffed by personnel from the various agencies. The head of the NCTC should have authority \nto evaluate the performance of the people assigned to the Center. \n\n     *  Such a joint center should be developed in the same spirit that\n\n        guided the military's creation of unified joint commands, or the\n\n        shaping of earlier national agencies like the National\n\n        Reconnaissance Office, which was formed to organize the work of the\n\n        CIA and several defense agencies in space.\n\n     *  NCTC - Intelligence. The NCTC should lead strategic analysis,\n\n        pooling all-source intelligence, foreign and domestic, about\n\n        transnational terrorist organizations with global reach. It should\n\n        develop net assessments (comparing enemy capabilities and\n\n        intentions against U. S. defenses and countermeasures). It should\n\n        also provide warning. It should do this work by drawing on the\n\n        efforts of the CIA, FBI, Homeland Security, and other departments\n\n        and agencies. It should task collection requirements both inside\n\n        and outside the United States.\n\n     *  The intelligence function (J-2) should build on the existing TTIC\n\n        structure and remain distinct, as a national intelligence center,\n\n        within the NCTC. As the government's principal knowledge bank on\n\n        Islamist terrorism, with the main responsibility for strategic\n\n        analysis and net assessment, it should absorb a significant\n\n        portion of the analytical talent now residing in the CIA's\n\n        Counterterrorist Center and the DIA's Joint Intelligence Task Force\n\n        - Combatting Terrorism (JITF-CT). NCTC - Operations. The NCTC\n\n        should perform joint planning. The plans would assign operational\n\n        responsibilities to lead agencies, such as State, the CIA, the FBI,\n\n        Defense and its combatant commands, Homeland Security, and other\n\n        agencies. The NCTC should not direct the actual execution of\n\n        these operations, leaving that job to the agencies. The NCTC would\n\n        then track implementation; it would look across the\n\n        foreign-domestic divide and across agency boundaries, updating\n\n        plans to follow through on cases.\n\n\n\n     *  The joint operational planning function (J-3) will be new to the\n\n        TTIC structure. The NCTC can draw on analogous work now being done\n\n        in the CIA and every other involved department of the government,\n\n        as well as reaching out to knowledgeable officials in state and\n\n        local agencies throughout the United States.\n\n     *  The NCTC should not be a policymaking body. Its operations\n\n        and planning should follow the policy direction of the president\n\n        and the National Security Council.\n\nSidebar 8: \n\nNCTC - Authorities. The head of the NCTC should be appointed by the president, and should be equivalent in rank \nto a deputy head of a cabinet department. The head of the NCTC would report to the national intelligence director, \nan office whose creation we recommend below, placed in the Executive Office of the President. The head of the \nNCTC would thus also report indirectly to the president. This official's nomination should be confirmed by the \nSenate and he or she should testify to the Congress, as is the case now with other statutory presidential offices, like \nthe U. S. trade representative.\n\n     *  To avoid the fate of other entities with great nominal authority\n\n        and little real power, the head of the NCTC must have the right to\n\n        concur in the choices of personnel to lead the operating entities\n\n        of the departments and agencies focused on counterterrorism,\n\n        specifically including the head of the Counterterrorist Center, the\n\n        head of the FBI's Counterterrorism Division, the commanders of the\n\n        Defense Department's Special Operations Command and Northern\n\n        Command, and the State Department's coordinator for\n\n        counterterrorism. The head of the NCTC should also work with the\n\n        director of the Office of Management and Budget in developing the\n\n        president's counterterrorism budget.\n\n     *  There are precedents for surrendering authority for joint planning\n\n        while preserving an agency's operational control. In the\n\n        international context, NATO commanders may get line authority over\n\n        forces assigned by other nations. In U. S. unified commands,\n\n        commanders plan operations that may involve units belonging to one\n\n        of the services. In each case, procedures are worked out, formal\n\n        and informal, to define the limits of the joint commander's\n\n        authority.\n\nThe most serious disadvantage of the NCTC is the reverse of its greatest virtue. The struggle against Islamist \nterrorism is so important that any clear-cut centralization of authority to manage and be accountable for it may \n\n\n\nconcentrate too much power in one place. The proposed NCTC would be given the authority of planning the \nactivities of other agencies. Law or executive order must define the scope of such line authority.\n\nThe NCTC would not eliminate interagency policy disputes. These would still go to the National Security Council. To \nimprove coordination at the White House, we believe the existing Homeland Security Council should soon be \nmerged into a single National Security Council. The creation of the NCTC should help the NSC staff concentrate on \nits core duties of assisting the president and supporting interdepartmental policymaking.\n\nWe recognize that this is a new and difficult idea precisely because the authorities we recommend for the NCTC \nreally would, as Secretary Rumsfeld foresaw, ask strong agencies to \"give up some of their turf and authority in \nexchange for a stronger, faster, more efficient government wide joint effort. \" Countering transnational Islamist \nterrorism will test whether the U. S. government can fashion more flexible models of management needed to deal \nwith the twenty-first-century world.\n\nAn argument against change is that the nation is at war, and cannot afford to reorganize in midstream. But some of \nthe main innovations of the 1940s and 1950s, including the creation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and even the \nconstruction of the Pentagon itself, were undertaken in the midst of war. Surely the country cannot wait until the \nstruggle against Islamist terrorism is over.\n\n\"Surprise, when it happens to a government, is likely to be a complicated, diffuse, bureaucratic thing. It includes \nneglect of responsibility, but also responsibility so poorly defined or so ambiguously delegated that action gets lost. \n\"   That comment was made more than 40 ears ago, about Pearl Harbor. We hope another commission, writing in \nthe future about another attack, does not again find this quotation to be so apt.\n\n13. 2 UNITY OF EFFORT IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY \n\nIn our first section, we concentrated on counterterrorism, discussing how to combine the analysis of information \nfrom all sources of intelligence with the joint planning of operations that draw on that analysis. In this section, we \nstep back from looking just at the counterterrorism problem. We reflect on whether the government is organized \nadequately to direct resources and build the intelligence capabilities it will need not just for countering terrorism, but \nfor the broader range of national security challenges in the decades ahead.\n\nThe Need for a Change \n\nDuring the Cold War, intelligence agencies did not depend on seamless integration to track and count the \nthousands of military targets - such as tanks and missiles - fielded by the Soviet Union and other adversary states. \nEach agency concentrated on its specialized mission, acquiring its own information and then sharing it via formal, \nfinished reports. The Department of Defense had given birth to and dominated the main agencies for technical \ncollection of intelligence. Resources were shifted at an incremental pace, coping with challenges that arose over \nyears, even decades.\n\nWe summarized the resulting organization of the intelligence community in chapter 3. It is outlined below.\n\nSidebar 9: \n\nThe need to restructure the intelligence community grows out of six problems that have become apparent before \nand after 9/11:\n\n     *  Structural barriers to performing joint intelligence work.\n\n        National intelligence is still organized around the collection\n\n        disciplines of the home agencies, not the joint mission. The\n\n        importance of integrated, allsource analysis cannot be overstated.\n\n        Without it, it is not possible to \"connect the dots. \" No one\n\n\n\n        component holds all the relevant information. By contrast, in\n\n        organizing national defense, the Goldwater- Nichols legislation of\n\n        1986 created joint commands for operations in the field, the\n\n        Unified Command Plan. The services - the Army, Navy, Air Force, and\n\n        Marine Corps - organize, train, and equip their people and units to\n\n        perform their missions. Then they assign personnel and units to the\n\n        joint combatant commander, like the commanding general of the\n\n        Central Command (CENTCOM). The Goldwater- Nichols Act required\n\n        officers to serve tours outside their service in order to win\n\n        promotion. The culture of the Defense Department was transformed,\n\n        its collective mind-set moved from service-specific to \"joint, \"\n\n        and its operations became more integrated.\n\n     *  Lack of common standards and practices across the\n\n        foreign-domestic divide. The leadership of the intelligence\n\n        community should be able to pool information gathered overseas with\n\n        information gathered in the United States, holding the work -\n\n        wherever it is done - to a common standard of quality in how it is\n\n        collected, processed (e. g. , translated), reported, shared, and\n\n        analyzed. A common set of personnel standards for intelligence can\n\n        create a group of professionals better able to operate in joint\n\n        activities, transcending their own service-specific mind-sets.\n\n     *  Divided management of national intelligence capabilities. While\n\n        the CIA was once \"central\" to our national intelligence\n\n        capabilities, following the end of the Cold War it has been less\n\n        able to influence the use of the nation's imagery and signals\n\n        intelligence capabilities in three national agencies housed within\n\n        the Department of Defense: the National Security Agency, the\n\n        National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the National\n\n        Reconnaissance Office. One of the lessons learned from the 1991\n\n        Gulf War was the value of national intelligence systems (satellites\n\n        in particular) in precision warfare. Since that war, the department\n\n        has appropriately drawn these agencies into its transformation of\n\n        the military. Helping to orchestrate this transformation is the\n\n        under secretary of defense for intelligence, a position established\n\n        by Congress after 9/11. An unintended consequence of these\n\n        developments has been the far greater demand made by Defense on\n\n\n\n        technical systems, leaving the DCI less able to influence how these\n\n        technical resources are allocated and used.\n\n     *  Weak capacity to set priorities and move resources. The\n\n        agencies are mainly organized around what they collect or the way\n\n        they collect it. But the priorities for collection are national. As\n\n        the DCI makes hard choices about moving resources, he or she must\n\n        have the power to reach across agencies and reallocate effort.\n\n     *  Too many jobs. The DCI now has at least three jobs. He is\n\n        expected to run a particular agency, the CIA. He is expected to\n\n        manage the loose confederation of agencies that is the intelligence\n\n        community. He is expected to be the analyst in chief for the\n\n        government, sifting evidence and directly briefing the President as\n\n        his principal intelligence adviser. No recent DCI has been able to\n\n        do all three effectively. Usually what loses out is management of\n\n        the intelligence community, a difficult task even in the best case\n\n        because the DCI's current authorities are weak. With so much to do,\n\n        the DCI often has not used even the authority he has.\n\n     *  Too complex and secret . Over the decades, the agencies and the\n\n        rules surrounding the intelligence community have accumulated to a\n\n        depth that practically defies public comprehension. There are now\n\n        15 agencies or parts of agencies in the intelligence community. The\n\n        community and the DCI's authorities have become arcane matters,\n\n        understood only by initiates after long study. Even the most basic\n\n        information about how much money is actually allocated to or within\n\n        the intelligence community and most of its key components is\n\n        shrouded from public view.\n\nThe current DCI is responsible for community performance but lacks the three authorities critical for any agency \nhead or chief executive officer: (1) control over purse strings, (2) the ability to hire or fire senior managers, and (3) \nthe ability to set standards for the information infrastructure and personnel.  \n\nThe only budget power of the DCI over agencies other than the CIA lies in coordinating the budget requests of the \nvarious intelligence agencies into a single program for submission to Congress. The overall funding request of the \n15 intelligence entities in this program is then presented to the president and Congress in 15 separate volumes.\n\nWhen Congress passes an appropriations bill to allocate money to intelligence agencies, most of their funding is \nhidden in the Defense Department in order to keep intelligence spending secret. Therefore, although the House and \nSenate Intelligence committees are the authorizing committees for funding of the intelligence community, the final \nbudget review is handled in the Defense Subcommittee of the Appropriations committees. Those committees have \nno subcommittees just for intelligence, and only a few members and staff review the requests.\n\nThe appropriations for the CIA and the national intelligence agencies - NSA, NGA, and NRO - are then given to the \nsecretary of defense. The secretary transfers the CIA's money to the DCI but disburses the national agencies' \n\n\n\nmoney directly. Money for the FBI's national security components falls within the appropriations for Commerce, \nJustice, and State and goes to the attorney general.  \n\nIn addition, the DCI lacks hire-and-fire authority over most of the intelligence community's senior managers. For the \nnational intelligence agencies housed in the Defense Department, the secretary of defense must seek the DCI's \nconcurrence regarding the nomination of these directors, who are presidentially appointed. But the secretary may \nsubmit recommendations to the president without receiving this concurrence. The DCI cannot fire these officials. \nThe DCI has even less influence over the head of the FBI's national security component, who is appointed by the \nattorney general in consultation with the DCI.  \n\nCombining Joint Work with Stronger Management \n\nWe have received recommendations on the topic of intelligence reform from many sources. Other commissions \nhave been over this same ground. Thoughtful bills have been introduced, most recently a bill by the chairman of the \nHouse Intelligence Committee Porter Goss (R-Fla. ), and another by the ranking minority member, Jane Harman \n(D-Calif. ). In the Senate, Senators Bob Graham (D-Fla. ) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif. ) have introduced reform \nproposals as well. Past efforts have foundered, because the president did not support them; because the DCI, the \nsecretary of defense, or both opposed them; and because some proposals lacked merit. We have tried to take \nstock of these experiences, and borrow from strong elements in many of the ideas that have already been \ndeveloped by others.\n\nRecommendation:The current position of Director of Central Intelligence should be replaced by a National \nIntelligence Director with two main areas of responsibility: (1) to oversee national intelligence centers on \nspecific subjects of interest across the U. S. government and (2) to manage the national intelligence \nprogram and oversee the agencies that contribute to it. \n\nFirst, the National Intelligence Director should oversee national intelligence centers to provide all-source analysis \nand plan intelligence operations for the whole government on major problems.\n\n     *  One such problem is counterterrorism. In this case, we believe that\n\n        the center should be the intelligence entity (formerly TTIC) inside\n\n        the National Counterterrorism Center we have proposed. It would sit\n\n        there alongside the operations management unit we described\n\n        earlier, with both making up the NCTC, in the Executive Office of\n\n        the President. Other national intelligence centers - for instance,\n\n        on counterproliferation, crime and narcotics, and China - would be\n\n        housed in whatever department or agency is best suited for them.\n\n     *  The National Intelligence Director would retain the present DCI's\n\n        role as the principal intelligence adviser to the president. We\n\n        hope the president will come to look directly to the directors of\n\n        the national intelligence centers to provide all-source analysis in\n\n        their areas of responsibility, balancing the advice of these\n\n        intelligence chiefs against the contrasting viewpoints that may be\n\n        offered by department heads at State, Defense, Homeland Security,\n\n        Justice, and other agencies.\n\n\n\nSecond, the National Intelligence Director should manage the national intelligence program and oversee the \ncomponent agencies of the intelligence community. (See diagram. )  \n\n     *  The National Intelligence Director would submit a unified budget\n\n        for national intelligence that reflects priorities chosen by the\n\n        National Security Council, an appropriate balance among the\n\n        varieties of technical and human intelligence collection, and\n\n        analysis. He or she would receive an appropriation for national\n\n        intelligence and apportion the funds to the appropriate agencies,\n\n        in line with that budget, and with authority to reprogram funds\n\n        among the national intelligence agencies to meet any new priority\n\n        (as counterterrorism was in the 1990s). The National Intelligence\n\n        Director should approve and submit nominations to the president of\n\n        the individuals who would lead the CIA, DIA, FBI Intelligence\n\n        Office, NSA, NGA, NRO, Information Analysis and Infrastructure\n\n        Protection Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security, and\n\n        other national intelligence capabilities.\n\n     *  The National Intelligence Director would manage this national\n\n        effort with the help of three deputies, each of whom would also\n\n        hold a key position in one of the component agencies.\n\n     *  foreign intelligence (the head of the CIA)\n\n     *  defense intelligence (the under secretary of defense for\n\n        intelligence)\n\n     *  homeland intelligence (the FBI's executive assistant director for\n\n        intelligence or the under secretary of homeland security for\n\n        information analysis and infrastructure protection)\n\n Other agencies in the intelligence community would coordinate their work within each of these three areas, largely \nstaying housed in the same departments or agencies that support them now. Returning to the analogy of the \nDefense Department's organization, these three deputies - like the leaders of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marines \n- would have the job of acquiring the systems, training the people, and executing the operations planned by the \nnational intelligence centers. And, just as the combatant commanders also report to the secretary of defense, the \ndirectors of the national intelligence centers - e. g. , for counterproliferation, crime and narcotics, and the rest - also \nwould report to the National Intelligence Director. The Defense Department's military intelligence programs - the \njoint military intelligence program (JMIP) and the tactical intelligence and related activities program (TIARA) - would \nremain part of that department's responsibility. Unity of Effort in Managing Intelligence\n\n  \u2022 \n\n     *  The National Intelligence Director would set personnel policies to\n\n        establish standards for education and training and facilitate\n\n        assignments at the national intelligence centers and across agency\n\n        lines. The National Intelligence Director also would set\n\n\n\n        information sharing and information technology policies to maximize\n\n        data sharing, as well as policies to protect the security of\n\n        information.\n\n     *  Too many agencies now have an opportunity to say no to change. The\n\n        National Intelligence Director should participate in an NSC\n\n        executive committee that can resolve differences in priorities\n\n        among the agencies and bring the major disputes to the president\n\n        for decision.\n\nThe National Intelligence Director should be located in the Executive Office of the President. This official, who \nwould be confirmed by the Senate and would testify before Congress, would have a relatively small staff of several \nhundred people, taking the place of the existing community management offices housed at the CIA.\n\nIn managing the whole community, the National Intelligence Director is still providing a service function. With the \npartial exception of his or her responsibilities for overseeing the NCTC, the National Intelligence Director should \nsupport the consumers of national intelligence - the president and policymaking advisers such as the secretaries of \nstate, defense, and homeland security and the attorney general.\n\nWe are wary of too easily equating government management problems with those of the private sector. But we \nhave noticed that some very large private firms rely on a powerful CEO who has significant control over how money \nis spent and can hire or fire leaders of the major divisions, assisted by a relatively modest staff, while leaving \nresponsibility for execution in the operating divisions.\n\nThere are disadvantages to separating the position of National Intelligence Director from the job of heading the CIA. \nFor example, the National Intelligence Director will not head a major agency of his or her own and may have a \nweaker base of support. But we believe that these disadvantages are outweighed by several other considerations:\n\n     *  The National Intelligence Director must be able to directly oversee\n\n        intelligence collection inside the United States. Yet law and\n\n        custom has counseled against giving such a plain domestic role to\n\n        the head of the CIA.\n\n     *  The CIA will be one among several claimants for funds in setting\n\n        national priorities. The National Intelligence Director should not\n\n        be both one of the advocates and the judge of them all.\n\n     *  Covert operations tend to be highly tactical, requiring close\n\n        attention. The National Intelligence Director should rely on the\n\n        relevant joint mission center to oversee these details, helping to\n\n        coordinate closely with the White House.The CIA will be able to\n\n        concentrate on building the capabilities to carry out such\n\n        operations and on providing the personnel who will be directing and\n\n        executing such operations in the field.\n\n     *  Rebuilding the analytic and human intelligence collection\n\n        capabilities of the CIA should be a full-time effort, and the\n\n        director of the CIA should focus on extending its comparative\n\n\n\n        advantages.\n\nRecommendation: The CIA Director should emphasize (a) rebuilding the CIA's analytic capabilities; (b) \ntransforming the clandestine service by building its human intelligence capabilities; (c) developing a \nstronger language program, with high standards and sufficient financial incentives; (d) renewing emphasis \non recruiting diversity among operations officers so they can blend more easily in foreign cities; (e) \nensuring a seamless relationship between human source collection and signals collection at the \noperational level; and (f) stressing a better balance between unilateral and liaison operations. \n\nThe CIA should retain responsibility for the direction and execution of clandestine and covert operations, as \nassigned by the relevant national intelligence center and authorized by the National Intelligence Director and the \npresident. This would include propaganda, renditions, and nonmilitary disruption. We believe, however, that one \nimportant area of responsibility should change.\n\nRecommendation: Lead responsibility for directing and executing paramilitary operations, whether \nclandestine or covert, should shift to the Defense Department. There it should be consolidated with the \ncapabilities for training, direction, and execution of such operations already being developed in the Special \nOperations Command. \n\n     *  Before 9/11, the CIA did not invest in developing a robust\n\n        capability to conduct paramilitary operations with U. S. personnel.\n\n        It relied on proxies instead, organized by CIA operatives without\n\n        the requisite military training. The results were unsatisfactory.\n\n     *  Whether the price is measured in either money or people, the United\n\n        States cannot afford to build two separate capabilities for\n\n        carrying out secret military operations, secretly operating\n\n        standoff missiles, and secretly training foreign military or\n\n        paramilitary forces. The United States should concentrate\n\n        responsibility and necessary legal authorities in one entity.\n\n     *  The post-9/11 Afghanistan precedent of using joint CIA-military\n\n        teams for covert and clandestine operations was a good one. We\n\n        believe this proposal to be consistent with it. Each agency would\n\n        concentrate on its comparative advantages in building capabilities\n\n        for joint missions. The operation itself would be planned in common.\n\n     *  The CIA has a reputation for agility in operations. The military\n\n        has a reputation for being methodical and cumbersome. We do not\n\n        know if these stereotypes match current reality; they may also be\n\n        one more symptom of the civil-military misunderstandings we\n\n        described in chapter 4. It is a problem to be resolved in policy\n\n        guidance and agency management, not in the creation of redundant,\n\n        overlapping capabilities and authorities in such sensitive work.\n\n        The CIA's experts should be integrated into the military's\n\n\n\n        training, exercises, and planning. To quote a CIA official now\n\n        serving in the field:\"One fight, one team. \"\n\nRecommendation: Finally, to combat the secrecy and complexity we have described, the overall amounts \nof money being appropriated for national intelligence and to its component agencies should no longer be \nkept secret. Congress should pass a separate appropriations act for intelligence, defending the broad \nallocation of how these tens of billions of dollars have been assigned among the varieties of intelligence \nwork. \n\nThe specifics of the intelligence appropriation would remain classified, as they are today. Opponents of \ndeclassification argue that America's enemies could learn about intelligence capabilities by tracking the top-line \nappropriations figure. Yet the top-line figure by itself provides little insight into U. S. intelligence sources and \nmethods. The U. S. government readily provides copious information about spending on its military forces, including \nmilitary intelligence. The intelligence community should not be subject to that much disclosure. But when even \naggregate categorical numbers remain hidden, it is hard to judge priorities and foster accountability.\n\n13. 3 UNITY OF EFFORT IN SHARING INFORMATION \n\nInformation Sharing \n\nWe have already stressed the importance of intelligence analysis that can draw on all relevant sources of \ninformation. The biggest impediment to all-source analysis - to a greater likelihood of connecting the dots - is the \nhuman or systemic resistance to sharing information.\n\nThe U. S. government has access to a vast amount of information. When databases not usually thought of as \n\"intelligence, \" such as customs or immigra-\n\ntion information, are included, the storehouse is immense. But the U. S. government has a weak system for \nprocessing and using what it has. In interviews around the government, official after official urged us to call attention \nto frustrations with the unglamorous \"back office\" side of government operations.\n\nIn the 9/11 story, for example, we sometimes see examples of information that could be accessed - like the \nundistributed NSA information that would have helped identify Nawaf al Hazmi in January 2000. But someone had \nto ask for it. In that case, no one did. Or, as in the episodes we describe in chapter 8, the information is distributed, \nbut in a compartmented channel. Or the information is available, and someone does ask, but it cannot be shared.\n\nWhat all these stories have in common is a system that requires a demonstrated \"need to know\" before sharing. \nThis approach assumes it is possible to know, in advance, who will need to use the information. Such a system \nimplicitly assumes that the risk of inadvertent disclosure outweighs the benefits of wider sharing. Those Cold War \nassumptions are no longer appropriate. The culture of agencies feeling they own the information they gathered at \ntaxpayer expense must be replaced by a culture in which the agencies instead feel they have a duty to the \ninformation - to repay the taxpayers' investment by making that information available.\n\nEach intelligence agency has its own security practices, outgrowths of the Cold War. We certainly understand the \nreason for these practices. Counterintelligence concerns are still real, even if the old Soviet enemy has been \nreplaced by other spies.\n\nBut the security concerns need to be weighed against the costs. Current security requirements nurture \noverclassification and excessive compartmentation of information among agencies. Each agency's incentive \nstructure opposes sharing, with risks (criminal, civil, and internal administrative sanctions) but few rewards for \nsharing information. No one has to pay the long-term costs of overclassifying information, though these costs - even \nin literal financial terms - are substantial. There are no punishments for not sharing information. Agencies uphold a \n\"need-to-know\" culture of information protection rather than promoting a \"need-to-share\" culture of integration.  \n\n\n\nRecommendation: Information procedures should provide incentives for sharing, to restore a better \nbalance between security and shared knowledge. \n\nIntelligence gathered about transnational terrorism should be processed, turned into reports, and distributed \naccording to the same quality standards, whether it is collected in Pakistan or in Texas.\n\nThe logical objection is that sources and methods may vary greatly in different locations. We therefore propose that \nwhen a report is first created, its data be separated from the sources and methods by which they are obtained. The\n\nreport should begin with the information in its most shareable, but still meaningful, form. Therefore the maximum \nnumber of recipients can access some form of that information. If knowledge of further details becomes important, \nany user can query further, with access granted or denied according to the rules set for the network - and with \nqueries leaving an audit trail in order to determine who accessed the information. But the questions may not come \nat all unless experts at the \"edge\" of the network can readily discover the clues that prompt to them.  \n\nWe propose that information be shared horizontally, across new networks that transcend individual agencies.\n\n     *  The current system is structured on an old mainframe, or\n\n        hub-andspoke, concept. In this older approach, each agency has its\n\n        own database. Agency users send information to the database and\n\n        then can retrieve it from the database.\n\n     *  A decentralized network model, the concept behind much of the\n\n        information revolution, shares data horizontally too. Agencies\n\n        would still have their own databases, but those databases would be\n\n        searchable across agency lines. In this system, secrets are\n\n        protected through the design of the network and an \"information\n\n        rights management\" approach that controls access to the data, not\n\n        access to the whole network. An outstanding conceptual framework\n\n        for this kind of \"trusted information network\" has been developed\n\n        by a task force of leading professionals in national security,\n\n        information technology, and law assembled by the Markle Foundation.\n\n        Its report has been widely discussed throughout the U. S.\n\n        government, but has not yet been converted into action.\n\nRecommendation: The president should lead the government-wide effort to bring the major national \nsecurity institutions into the information revolution. He should coordinate the resolution of the legal, \npolicy, and technical issues across agencies to create a \"trusted information network. \" \n\n     *  No one agency can do it alone. Well-meaning agency officials are\n\n        under tremendous pressure to update their systems. Alone, they may\n\n        only be able to modernize the stovepipes, not replace them.\n\n     *  Only presidential leadership can develop government-wide concepts\n\n        and standards. Currently, no one is doing this job. Backed by the\n\n        Office of Management and Budget, a new National Intelligence\n\n\n\n        Director empowered to set common standards for information use\n\n        throughout the community, and a secretary of homeland security who\n\n        helps extend the system to public agencies and relevant\n\n        private-sector databases, a government-wide initiative can succeed.\n\n     *  White House leadership is also needed because the policy and legal\n\n        issues are harder than the technical ones. The necessary technology\n\n        already exists. What does not are the rules for acquiring,\n\n        accessing, sharing, and using the vast stores of public and private\n\n        data that may be available.When information sharing works, it is a\n\n        powerful tool. Therefore the sharing and uses of information must\n\n        be guided by a set of practical policy guidelines that\n\n        simultaneously empower and constrain officials, telling them\n\n        clearly what is and is not permitted.\n\n\"This is government acting in new ways, to face new threats, \" the most recent Markle report explains. \"And while \nsuch change is necessary, it must be accomplished while engendering the people's trust that privacy and other civil \nliberties are being protected, that businesses are not being unduly burdened with requests for extraneous or \nuseless information, that taxpayer money is being well spent, and that, ultimately, the network will be effective in \nprotecting our security. \"The authors add: \"Leadership is emerging from all levels of government and from many \nplaces in the private sector. What is needed now is a plan to accelerate these efforts, and public debate and \nconsensus on the goals. \"  \n\n13. 4 UNITY OF EFFORT IN THE CONGRESS \n\nStrengthen Congressional Oversight of Intelligence and Homeland Security \n\nOf all our recommendations, strengthening congressional oversight may be among the most difficult and important. \nSo long as oversight is governed by current congressional rules and resolutions, we believe the American people \nwill not get the security they want and need. The United States needs a strong, stable, and capable congressional \ncommittee structure to give America's national intelligence agencies oversight, support, and leadership.\n\nFew things are more difficult to change in Washington than congressional committee jurisdiction and prerogatives. \nTo a member, these assignments are almost as important as the map of his or her congressional district. The \nAmerican people may have to insist that these changes occur, or they may well not happen. Having interviewed \nnumerous members of Congress from both parties, as well as congressional staff members, we found that \ndissatisfaction with congressional oversight remains widespread.\n\nThe future challenges of America's intelligence agencies are daunting. They include the need to develop leading-\nedge technologies that give our policy-\n\nmakers and warfighters a decisive edge in any conflict where the interests of the United States are vital. Not only \ndoes good intelligence win wars, but the best intelligence enables us to prevent them from happening altogether.\n\nUnder the terms of existing rules and resolutions the House and Senate intelligence committees lack the power, \ninfluence, and sustained capability to meet this challenge. While few members of Congress have the broad \nknowledge of intelligence activities or the know-how about the technologies employed, all members need to feel \nassured that good oversight is happening. When their unfamiliarity with the subject is combined with the need to \npreserve security, a mandate emerges for substantial change.\n\n\n\nTinkering with the existing structure is not sufficient. Either Congress should create a joint committee for \nintelligence, using the Joint Atomic Energy Committee as its model, or it should create House and Senate \ncommittees with combined authorizing and appropriations powers.\n\nWhichever of these two forms are chosen, the goal should be a structure - codified by resolution with powers \nexpressly granted and carefully limited - allowing a relatively small group of members of Congress, given time and \nreason to master the subject and the agencies, to conduct oversight of the intelligence establishment and be clearly \naccountable for their work. The staff of this committee should be nonpartisan and work for the entire committee and \nnot for individual members.\n\nThe other reforms we have suggested - for a National Counterterrorism Center and a National Intelligence Director - \nwill not work if congressional oversight does not change too. Unity of effort in executive management can be lost if it \nis fractured by divided congressional oversight.\n\nRecommendation: Congressional oversight for intelligence - and counterterrorism - is now dysfunctional. \nCongress should address this problem. We have considered various alternatives: A joint committee on the \nold model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one. A single committee in each house of Congress, \ncombining authorizing and appropriating authorities, is another. \n\n     *  The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies\n\n        of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems\n\n        relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members\n\n        of the House and Senate.\n\n     *  We have already recommended that the total level of funding for\n\n        intelligence be made public, and that the national intelligence\n\n        program be appropriated to the National Intelligence Director, not\n\n        to the secretary of defense.\n\n     *  We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a\n\n        subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, freed from the\n\n        consuming responsibility of working on the budget.\n\n     *  The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure\n\n        should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees. The\n\n        majority party's representation on this committee should never\n\n        exceed the minority's representation by more than one.\n\n     *  Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees\n\n        should be a member who also serves on each of the following\n\n        additional committees:Armed Services, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs,\n\n        and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. In this way the other\n\n        major congressional interests can be brought together in the new\n\n        committee's work.\n\n     *  Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees,\n\n        without set terms, thereby letting them accumulate expertise.\n\n     *  The committees should be smaller - perhaps seven or nine members in\n\n\n\n        each house - so that each member feels a greater sense of\n\n        responsibility, and accountability, for the quality of the\n\n        committee's work.\n\nThe leaders of the Department of Homeland Security now appear before 88 committees and subcommittees of \nCongress. One expert witness (not a member of the administration) told us that this is perhaps the single largest \nobstacle impeding the department's successful development. The one attempt to consolidate such committee \nauthority, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, may be eliminated. The Senate does not have even \nthis.\n\nCongress needs to establish for the Department of Homeland Security the kind of clear authority and responsibility \nthat exist to enable the Justice Department to deal with crime and the Defense Department to deal with threats to \nnational security. Through not more than one authorizing committee and one appropriating subcommittee in each \nhouse, Congress should be able to ask the secretary of homeland security whether he or she has the resources to \nprovide reasonable security against major terrorist acts within the United States and to hold the secretary \naccountable for the department's performance.\n\nRecommendation: Congress should create a single, principal point of oversight and review for homeland \nsecurity. Congressional leaders are best able to judge what committee should have jurisdiction over this \ndepartment and its duties. But we believe that Congress does have the obligation to choose one in the \nHouse and one in the Senate, and that this committee should be a permanent standing committee with a \nnonpartisan staff. \n\nImprove the Transitions between Administrations \n\nIn chapter 6, we described the transition of 2000-2001. Beyond the policy issues we described, the new \nadministration did not have its deputy cabinet officers in place until the spring of 2001, and the critical subcabinet \nofficials were not confirmed until the summer - if then. In other words, the new administration - like others before it - \ndid not have its team on the job until at least six months after it took office.\n\nRecommendation: Since a catastrophic attack could occur with little or no notice, we should minimize as \nmuch as possible the disruption of national security policymaking during the change of administrations by \naccelerating the process for national security appointments. We think the process could be improved \nsignificantly so transitions can work more effectively and allow new officials to assume their new \nresponsibilities as quickly as possible. \n\n     *  Before the election, candidates should submit the names of selected\n\n        members of their prospective transition teams to the FBI so that,\n\n        if necessary, those team members can obtain security clearances\n\n        immediately after the election is over.\n\n     *  A president-elect should submit lists of possible candidates for\n\n        national security positions to begin obtaining security clearances\n\n        immediately after the election, so that their background\n\n        investigations can be complete before January 20.\n\n     *  A single federal agency should be responsible for providing and\n\n        maintaining security clearances, ensuring uniform\n\n\n\n        standards-including uniform security questionnaires and financial\n\n        report requirements, and maintaining a single database. This agency\n\n        can also be responsible for administering polygraph tests on behalf\n\n        of organizations that require them.\n\n     *  A president-elect should submit the nominations of the entire new\n\n        national security team, through the level of under secretary of\n\n        cabinet departments, not later than January 20. The Senate, in\n\n        return, should adopt special rules requiring hearings and votes to\n\n        confirm or reject national security nominees within 30 days of\n\n        their submission. The Senate should not require confirmation of\n\n        such executive appointees below Executive Level 3.\n\n     *  The outgoing administration should provide the president-elect, as\n\n        soon as possible after election day, with a classified,\n\n        compartmented list that catalogues specific, operational threats to\n\n        national security; major military or covert operations; and pending\n\n        decisions on the pos- sible use of force. Such a document could\n\n        provide both notice and a checklist, inviting a president-elect to\n\n        inquire and learn more.\n\n13. 5 ORGANIZING AMERICA'S DEFENSES IN THE UNITED STATES \n\nThe Future Role of the FBI \n\nWe have considered proposals for a new agency dedicated to intelligence collection in the United States. Some call \nthis a proposal for an \"American MI- 5, \" although the analogy is weak - the actual British Security Service is a \nrelatively small worldwide agency that combines duties assigned in the U. S. government to the Terrorist Threat \nIntegration Center, the CIA, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe concern about the FBI is that it has long favored its criminal justice mission over its national security mission. \nPart of the reason for this is the demand around the country for FBI help on criminal matters. The FBI was criticized, \nrightly, for the overzealous domestic intelligence investigations disclosed during the 1970s. The pendulum swung \naway from those types of investigations during the 1980s and 1990s, though the FBI maintained an active \ncounterintelligence function and was the lead agency for the investigation of foreign terrorist groups operating inside \nthe United States.\n\nWe do not recommend the creation of a new domestic intelligence agency. It is not needed if our other \nrecommendations are adopted - to establish a strong national intelligence center, part of the NCTC, that will \noversee counterterrorism intelligence work, foreign and domestic, and to create a National Intelligence Director who \ncan set and enforce standards for the collection, processing, and reporting of information.\n\nUnder the structures we recommend, the FBI's role is focused, but still vital. The FBI does need to be able to direct \nits thousands of agents and other employees to collect intelligence in America's cities and towns - interviewing \ninformants, conducting surveillance and searches, tracking individuals, working collaboratively with local authorities, \nand doing so with meticulous attention to detail and compliance with the law. The FBI's job in the streets of the \n\n\n\nUnited States would thus be a domestic equivalent, operating under the U. S. Constitution and quite different laws \nand rules, to the job of the CIA's operations officers abroad.\n\nCreating a new domestic intelligence agency has other drawbacks.\n\n     *  The FBI is accustomed to carrying out sensitive intelligence\n\n        collection operations n compliance with the law. If a new domestic\n\n        intelligence agency were outside of the Department of Justice, the\n\n        process of legal oversight - never easy - could become even more\n\n        difficult. Abuses of civil liberties could create a backlash that\n\n        would impair the collection of needed intelligence.\n\n     *  Creating a new domestic intelligence agency would divert attention\n\n        of the officials most responsible for current counterterrorism\n\n        efforts while the threat remains high. Putting a new player into\n\n        the mix of federal agencies with counterterrorism responsibilities\n\n        would exacerbate existing information-sharing problems.\n\n     *  A new domestic intelligence agency would need to acquire assets and\n\n        personnel. The FBI already has 28, 000 employees; 56 field offices,\n\n        400 satellite offices, and 47 legal attache offices; a laboratory,\n\n        operations center, and training facility; an existing network of\n\n        informants, cooperating defendants, and other sources; and\n\n        relationships with state and local law enforcement, the CIA, and\n\n        foreign intelligence and law enforcement agencies.\n\n     *  Counterterrorism investigations in the United States very quickly\n\n        become matters that involve violations of criminal law and possible\n\n        law enforcement action. Because the FBI can have agents working\n\n        criminal matters and agents working intelligence investigations\n\n        concerning the same international terrorism target, the full range\n\n        of investigative tools against a suspected terrorist can be\n\n        considered within one agency. The removal of \"the wall\" that\n\n        existed before 9/11 between intelligence and law enforcement has\n\n        opened up new opportunities for cooperative action within the FBI.\n\n     *  Counterterrorism investigations often overlap or are cued by other\n\n        criminal investigations, such as money laundering or the smuggling\n\n        of contraband. In the field, the close connection to criminal work\n\n        has many benefits.\n\nOur recommendation to leave counterterrorism intelligence collection in the United States with the FBI still depends \non an assessment that the FBI - if it makes an all-out effort to institutionalize change - can do the job. As we \nmentioned in chapter 3, we have been impressed by the determination that agents display in tracking down details, \n\n\n\npatiently going the extra mile and working the extra month, to put facts in the place of speculation. In our report we \nhave shown how agents in Phoenix, Minneapolis, and New York displayed initiative in pressing their investigations.\n\nFBI agents and analysts in the field need to have sustained support and dedicated resources to become stronger \nintelligence officers. They need to be rewarded for acquiring informants and for gathering and disseminating \ninformation differently and more broadly than usual in a traditional criminal inves-\n\ntigation. FBI employees need to report and analyze what they have learned in ways the Bureau has never done \nbefore.\n\nUnder Director Robert Mueller, the Bureau has made significant progress in improving its intelligence capabilities. It \nnow has an Office of Intelligence, overseen by the top tier of FBI management. Field intelligence groups have been \ncreated in all field offices to put FBI priorities and the emphasis on intelligence into practice. Advances have been \nmade in improving the Bureau's information technology systems and in increasing connectivity and information \nsharing with intelligence community agencies.\n\nDirector Mueller has also recognized that the FBI's reforms are far from complete. He has outlined a number of \nareas where added measures may be necessary. Specifically, he has recognized that the FBI needs to recruit from \na broader pool of candidates, that agents and analysts working on national security matters require specialized \ntraining, and that agents should specialize within programs after obtaining a generalist foundation. The FBI is \ndeveloping career tracks for agents to specialize in counterterrorism/counterintelligence, cyber crimes, criminal \ninvestigations, or intelligence. It is establishing a program for certifying agents as intelligence officers, a certification \nthat will be a prerequisite for promotion to the senior ranks of the Bureau. New training programs have been \ninstituted for intelligence-related subjects.\n\nThe Director of the FBI has proposed creating an Intelligence Directorate as a further refinement of the FBI \nintelligence program. This directorate would include units for intelligence planning and policy and for the direction of \nanalysts and linguists.\n\nWe want to ensure that the Bureau's shift to a preventive counterterrorism posture is more fully institutionalized so \nthat it survives beyond Director Mueller's tenure. We have found that in the past the Bureau has announced its \nwillingness to reform and restructure itself to address transnational security threats, but has fallen short - failing to \neffect the necessary institutional and cultural changes organization-wide. We want to ensure that this does not \nhappen again. Despite having found acceptance of the Director's clear message that counterterrorism is now the \nFBI's top priority, two years after 9/11 we also found gaps between some of the announced reforms and the reality \nin the field. We are concerned that management in the field offices still can allocate people and resources to local \nconcerns that diverge from the national security mission. This system could revert to a focus on lower-priority \ncriminal justice cases over national security requirements.\n\nRecommendation: A specialized and integrated national security workforce should be established at the \nFBI consisting of agents, analysts, linguists, and surveillance specialists who are recruited, trained, \nrewarded, and retained to ensure the development of an institutional \n\nculture imbued with a deep expertise in intelligence and national security. \n\n     *  The president, by executive order or directive, should direct the\n\n        FBI to develop this intelligence cadre.\n\n     *  Recognizing that cross-fertilization between the criminal justice\n\n        and national security disciplines is vital to the success of both\n\n        missions, all new agents should receive basic training in both\n\n        areas. Furthermore, new agents should begin their careers with\n\n        meaningful assignments in both areas.\n\n\n\n     *  Agents and analysts should then specialize in one of these\n\n        disciplines and have the option to work such matters for their\n\n        entire career with the Bureau. Certain advanced training courses\n\n        and assignments to other intelligence agencies should be required\n\n        to advance within the national security discipline.\n\n     *  In the interest of cross-fertilization, all senior FBI managers,\n\n        including those working on law enforcement matters, should be\n\n        certified intelligence officers.\n\n     *  The FBI should fully implement a recruiting, hiring, and selection\n\n        process for agents and analysts that enhances its ability to target\n\n        and attract individuals with educational and professional\n\n        backgrounds in intelligence, international relations, language,\n\n        technology, and other relevant skills.\n\n     *  The FBI should institute the integration of analysts, agents,\n\n        linguists, and surveillance personnel in the field so that a\n\n        dedicated team approach is brought to bear on national security\n\n        intelligence operations.\n\n     *  Each field office should have an official at the field office's\n\n        deputy level for national security matters. This individual would\n\n        have management oversight and ensure that the national priorities\n\n        are carried out in the field.\n\n     *  The FBI should align its budget structure according to its four\n\n        main programs - intelligence, counterterrorism and\n\n        counterintelligence, criminal, and criminal justice services - to\n\n        ensure better transparency on program costs, management of\n\n        resources, and protection of the intelligence program.\n\n     *  The FBI should report regularly to Congress in its semiannual\n\n        program reviews designed to identify whether each field office is\n\n        appropriately addressing FBI and national program priorities.\n\n     *  The FBI should report regularly to Congress in detail on the\n\n        qualifications, status, and roles of analysts in the field and at\n\n        headquarters. Congress should ensure that analysts are afforded\n\n        training and career opportunities on a par with those offered\n\n        analysts in other intelligence community agencies.\n\n     *  The Congress should make sure funding is available to accelerate\n\n        the expansion of secure facilities in FBI field offices so as to\n\n\n\n        increase their ability to use secure email systems and classified\n\n        intelligence product exchanges. The Congress should monitor whether\n\n        the FBI's information-sharing principles are implemented in\n\n        practice.\n\nThe FBI is just a small fraction of the national law enforcement community in the United States, a community \ncomprised mainly of state and local agencies. The network designed for sharing information, and the work of the \nFBI through local Joint Terrorism Task Forces, should build a reciprocal relationship, in which state and local agents \nunderstand what information they are looking for and, in return, receive some of the information being developed \nabout what is happening, or may happen, in their communities. In this relationship, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity also will play an important part.\n\nThe Homeland Security Act of 2002 gave the under secretary for information analysis and infrastructure protection \nbroad responsibilities. In practice, this directorate has the job to map \"terrorist threats to the homeland against our \nassessed vulnerabilities in order to drive our efforts to protect against terrorist threats. \"   These capabilities are still \nembryonic. The directorate has not yet developed the capacity to perform one of its assigned jobs, which is to \nassimilate and analyze information from Homeland Security's own component agencies, such as the Coast Guard, \nSecret Service, Transportation Security Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Customs and \nBorder Protection. The secretary of homeland security must ensure that these components work with the \nInformation Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate so that this office can perform its mission.  \n\nHomeland Defense \n\nAt several points in our inquiry, we asked, \"Who is responsible for defending us at home? \" Our national defense at \nhome is the responsibility, first, of the Department of Defense and, second, of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. They must have clear delineations of responsibility and authority.\n\nWe found that NORAD, which had been given the responsibility for defending U. S. airspace, had construed that \nmission to focus on threats coming from outside America's borders. It did not adjust its focus even though the \nintelligence community had gathered intelligence on the possibility that ter-\n\nrorists might turn to hijacking and even use of planes as missiles. We have been assured that NORAD has now \nembraced the full mission. Northern Command has been established to assume responsibility for the defense of the \ndomestic United States.\n\nRecommendation: The Department of Defense and its oversight committees should regularly assess the \nadequacy of Northern Command's strategies and planning to defend the United States against military \nthreats to the homeland. \n\nThe Department of Homeland Security was established to consolidate all of the domestic agencies responsible for \nsecuring America's borders and national infrastructure, most of which is in private hands. It should identify those \nelements of our transportation, energy, communications, financial, and other institutions that need to be protected, \ndevelop plans to protect that infrastructure, and exercise the mechanisms to enhance preparedness. This means \ngoing well beyond the preexisting jobs of the agencies that have been brought together inside the department.\n\nRecommendation: The Department of Homeland Security and its oversight committees should regularly \nassess the types of threats the country faces to determine (a) the adequacy of the government's plans - and \nthe progress against those plans - to protect America's critical infrastructure and (b) the readiness of the \ngovernment to respond to the threats that the United States might face. \n\nWe look forward to a national debate on the merits of what we have recommended, and we will participate \nvigorously in that debate.\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX A COMMON ABBREVIATIONS \n\nCAP combat air patrol\n\nCAPPS Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System\n\nCENTCOM Central Command\n\nCIA Central Intelligence Agency\n\nCONR Continental U.S. NORAD Region\n\nCSG Counterterrorism Security Group\n\nCTC Counterterrorist Center\n\nDIA Defense Intelligence Agency\n\nDCI Director of Central Intelligence\n\nESU Emergency Service Unit (NYPD)\n\nFAA Federal Aviation Administration\n\nFBI Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nFDNY Fire Department of New York\n\nFFTC Florida Flight Training Center\n\nFISA Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\n\nFISC Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\n\nINS Immigration and Naturalization Service\n\nISID Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (Pakistan)\n\nJCS Joint Chiefs of Staff\n\nJI Jemaah Islamiah\n\nJTTF Joint Terrorism Task Force\n\nKSM Khalid Sheikh Mohammed\n\nLegat legal attache\n\nMAK Mektab al Khidmat\n\nMON memorandum of notification\n\nNEADS Northeast Air Defense Sector\n\nNCTC National Counterterrorism Center\n\nNGO nongovernmental organization\n\nNMCC National Military Command Center\n\nNORAD North American Aerospace Defense Command\n\nNTSB National Transportation Safety Board\n\nNSA National Security Agency\n\nNSC National Security Council\n\nNSPD national security policy directive\n\nNYPD New York Police Department\n\n\n\nOEM Office of Emergency Management (New York City)\n\nOFAC Office of Foreign Assets Control\n\nOIPR Office of Intelligence Policy and Review\n\nOMB Office of Management and Budget\n\nPAPD Port Authority Police Department\n\nPDD presidential decision directive\n\nPEOC Presidential Emergency Operations Center\n\nSEC Securities and Exchange Commission\n\nTSA Transportation Security Administration\n\nTTIC Terrorist Threat Integration Center\n\nUBL Usama Bin Ladin\n\nWMD weapons of mass destruction\n\nWTC World Trade Center\n\nWTO World Trade Organization\n\nAPPENDIX B TABLE OF NAMES \n\nU.

Zuhair al Thubaiti: He has reportedly admitted membership in al Qaeda,stating \"proudly\"that\n\nhe was among a select number of operatives who had the personal endorsement of Bin Ladin.He was not ultimately \nselected for the 9/11 attacks because the al Qaeda leadership considered him too high-strung and lacking the \nnecessary temperament.CIA analytic report,\"Threat Threads,\"Sept.16,2002,p.3;Intel-ligence reports,interrogations \nof detainee,May 21,2002;June 17,2002;June 20,2002;Intelligence reports, interrogations of KSM,Feb.20,2004 (two \nreports).\n\n7.

Saud al Rashid. Describing him as headstrong and immature,KSM says he disappeared after being sent to \nSaudi Arabia for a U.S.visa,either because he had second thoughts or because his family interceded and \nconfiscated his passport.Passport photos of Rashid and three 9/11 hijackers - Nawaf al Hazmi,Mih-dhar,and Omari \n- were found together during a May 2002 raid in Karachi.After discovery of the photos in 2002,Rashid turned himself \nin to the Saudi authorities,but he has since been released from custody. In a Commission interview,he has admitted \ntraining in Afghanistan but denies hearing of al Qaeda before returning from Afghanistan or meeting Bin \nLadin,KSM,or any 9/11 hijacker other than Ahmad al Haz-nawi,whom he claims seeing only once or twice at a \nguesthouse.He has no credible explanation why photos of him were found with those of three other hijackers,or why \nothers identified him as a candidate hijacker.See Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,Mar.27,2003;June \n11,2003;July 3,2003;Feb.20, 2004;Intelligence report,interrogation of Khallad,July 9,2003;Saud al Rashid interview \n(Feb.24,2004).\n\n9. Mushabib al Hamlan. Sent to Saudi Arabia to acquire a U.S.visa,he and his travel companion, 9/11 hijacker \nAhmed al Nami,both applied for and received visas on October 28,2000.Hamlan never returned to \nAfghanistan,probably dropping out either because he changed his mind or because his family intervened.\n\nIn December 1999,while still in high school in Saudi Arabia,Hamlan became involved with a group that gathered \nperiodically to watch jihad propaganda tapes,and was encouraged by a mentor named Ban-dar Marui to pursue \njihad,especially as practiced in the Bosnia-Herzegovina and Russian-Afghan wars and a book titled Gladiator of \nPassion .As instructed,Hamlan acquired a passport,on February 15,2000,and agreed to go to Afghanistan after the \nhajj in mid-March 2000.He and two travel companions obtained Pakistani visas in Sharjah,UAE,and traveled to \nIslamabad,where al Qaeda facilitator Hassan Ghul took them to a guesthouse managed by Abu Zubaydah.Days \nlater,two men helped Hamlan cross the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.\n\nAt the Khaldan camp,Hamlan received military training courses.Upon hearing that the camp was to be closed,he \nand others traveled to al Faruq camp near Kandahar,where they received more training.He also met and \nproclaimed allegiance to Bin Ladin at this time.Injured during a further training session, Hamlan was assigned to \nguard the airport,where he met future hijacker Ahmed al Nami (whose recent laser eye surgery had interrupted his \ntraining).An individual named Abu Basir al Yemeni indoctrinated the two in Bin Ladin's anti-U.S.position and \nextolled the virtues of martyrdom.Hamlan and Nami eventually agreed to approach Abu Hafs al Mauritani about \n\n\n\nparticipating in a suicide operation.The day after visiting Abu Hafs,Hamlan and Nami heard from Abu Basir that Bin \nLadin was planning an attack against the United States.After taking their passports,Abu Basir arranged for Hamlan \nand Nami to meet Bin Ladin and instructed them to use the following phrase to express their desire to become \nmartyrs:\"I want to be one of this religion's bricks and glorify this religion.\"The al Qaeda leader accepted both \napplicants.\n\nIn October 2000,Abu Basir took Hamlan and Nami to Kandahar to meet KSM,who impressed on them the high \nexpectations for martyrs and instructed them on using coded telephone numbers. He returned their passports,which \nhad been altered and now contained forged tourism stamps for Singapore, Malaysia,Turkey,and Egypt.KSM told \nthem to meet with Atef before returning to Saudi Arabia,where they should contact hijacker future 9/11 hijacker \nWaleed al Shehri for additional documentation.\n\nAfter meeting with Atef,Hamlan and Nami traveled by car and by air to an address KSM had given them in \nTehran,where arrangements were made for them to fly to Qatar.From Qatar they traveled onward to the UAE and \nthen to Mecca.Nami contacted KSM and received coded instructions to go to Jeddah, call Waleed al Shehri,and \nobtain visas at the U.S.consulate.In Jeddah,they briefly shared an apartment with Shehri,who provided them with \ndirections to the consulate and showed them how to fill out the visa application.After acquiring visas,Hamlan and \nNami presented their passports to Shehri for inspection and returned to Mecca.Nami called KSM,who told them to \nreturn to Afghanistan the next day.\n\nDespite instructions to the contrary,Hamlan insisted on calling his family before leaving Saudi Arabia because he \nhad begun to have second thoughts after acquiring the visa.Told by his brother that their mother had fallen \nill.Hamlan decided not to return to Afghanistan even after Nami reminded him of his\n\nallegiance to Bin Ladin and commitment to complete the suicide mission.In Riyadh,he told his brothers that he had \nbeen on jihad in Chechnya.Fearing that they might ask for his passport,he removed the U.S.visa - as later \nconfirmed by forensic analysis performed by Saudi authorities.Hamlan returned to college and resumed living with \nhis parents,who confiscated his passport.\n\nThereafter,Hamlan received a visit at the college from a former associate at al Faruq camp,Khalid al Zahrani,who \nasked why he had not returned to Afghanistan.Zahrani admitted having been sent by KSM to convince Hamlan to \nreturn to Afghanistan.Hamlan never did.Intelligence report,interrogation of detainee,Mar.16,2003.\n\n10. Abderraouf Jdey,a.k.a.Faruq al Tunisi. A Canadian passport holder,he may have trained in Afghanistan with \nKhalid al Mihdhar and Nawaf al Hazmi and received instruction from KSM with Atta and Binalshibh.A letter \nrecovered from a safehouse in Pakistan,apparently written by Sayf al Adl,also suggests that Jdey was initially part \nof the 9/11 operation at the same time as the Hamburg group.A videotape of Jdey's martyrdom statement was \nfound in the rubble of Atef's house near Kabul following a November 2001 airstrike,together with a martyrdom video \nof Binalshibh.While both Binalshibh and Khallad confirm Jdey's status as an al Qaeda recruit,KSM says Jdey was \nslated for a \"second wave\"of attacks but had dropped out by the summer of 2001 while in Canada.FBI briefing \n(June 24,2004);Intelligence report,interrogation of Binalshibh,Sept.11,2003;Intelligence report,interrogation of \nKhallad,May 21, 2004;Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,July 1,2003.\n\nSidebar 1: \n\nThe following is the text of an item from the Presidential Daily Brief received by President William J. Clinton on \nDecember 4, 1998. Redacted material is indicated in brackets. \n\nSUBJECT: Bin Ladin Preparing to Hijack US Aircraft and Other Attacks\n\n1. Reporting [ - ] suggests Bin Ladin and his allies are preparing for attacks in the US, including an aircraft hijacking \nto obtain the release of Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd al-Rahman, Ramzi Yousef, and Muhammad Sadiq 'Awda. One source \nquoted a senior member of the Gama'at al-Islamiyya (IG) saying that, as of late October, the IG had completed \nplanning for\n\n\n\nan operation in the US on behalf of Bin Ladin, but that the operation was on hold. A senior Bin Ladin operative from \nSaudi Arabia was to visit IG counterparts in the US soon thereafter to discuss options - perhaps including an aircraft \nhijacking.\n\n     *  IG leader Islambuli in late September was planning to hijack a US\n\n        airliner during the \"next couple of weeks\" to free 'Abd al- Rahman\n\n        and the other prisoners, according to what may be a different\n\n        source.\n\n     *  The same source late last month said that Bin Ladin might implement\n\n        plans to hijack US aircraft before the beginning of Ramadan on 20\n\n        December and that two members of the operational team had evaded\n\n        security checks during a recent trial run at an unidentified New\n\n        York airport. [ - ]\n\n2. Some members of the Bin Ladin network have received hijack training, according to various sources, but no \ngroup directly tied to Bin Ladin's al-Qa'ida organization has ever carried out an aircraft hijacking. Bin Ladin could be \nweighing other types of operations against US aircraft. According to [ - ] the IG in October obtained SA-7 missiles \nand intended to move them from Yemen into Saudi Arabia to shoot down an Egyptian plane or, if unsuccessful, a \nUS military or civilian aircraft.\n\n     *  A [ - ] in October told us that unspecified \"extremist elements\"\n\n        in Yemen had acquired SA-7s. [ - ]\n\n3. [ - ] indicate the Bin Ladin organization or its allies are moving closer to implementing anti-US attacks at \nunspecified locations, but we do not know whether they are related to attacks on aircraft. A Bin Ladin associate in \nSudan late last month told a colleague in Kandahar that he had shipped a group of containers to Afghanistan. Bin \nLadin associates also talked about the movement of containers to Afghanistan before the East Africa bombings.\n\n     *  In other [ - ] Bin Ladin associates last month discussed picking\n\n        up a package in Malaysia. One told his colleague in Malaysia that\n\n        \"they\"were in the \"ninth month [of pregnancy]. \"\n\n     *  An alleged Bin Ladin supporter in Yemen late last month remarked to\n\n        his mother that he planned to work in \"commerce\" from abroad and\n\n        said his impending \"marriage, \" which would take place soon, would\n\n        be a \"surprise. \"\"Commerce\" and \"marriage\" often are codewords for\n\n        terrorist attacks. [ - ]\n\nSidebar 2: \n\nDetainee Interrogation Reports \n\nChapters 5 and 7 rely heavily on information obtained from captured al Qaeda members. A number of these \n\"detainees\" have firsthand knowledge of the 9/11 plot.\n\nAssessing the truth of statements by these witnesses - sworn enemies of the United States - is challenging. Our \naccess to them has been limited to the review of intelligence reports based on communications received from the \nlocations where the actual interrogations take place. We submitted questions for use in the interrogations, but had \n\n\n\nno control over whether, when, or how questions of particular interest would be asked. Nor were we allowed to talk \nto the interrogators so that we could better judge the credibility of the detainees and clarify ambiguities in the \nreporting. We were told that our requests might disrupt the sensitive interrogation process.\n\nWe have nonetheless decided to include information from captured 9/11 conspirators and al Qaeda members in our \nreport. We have evaluated their statements carefully and have attempted to corroborate them with documents and \nstatements of others. In this report, we indicate where such statements provide the foundation for our narrative. We \nhave been authorized to identify by name only ten detainees whose custody has been confirmed officially by the U. \nS. government.  \n\nSidebar 3: \n\nA Case Study in Terrorist Travel \n\nFollowing a familiar terrorist pattern, Ressam and his associates used fraudulent passports and immigration fraud to \ntravel. In Ressam's case, this involved flying from France to Montreal using a photo-substituted French passport \nunder a false name. Under questioning, Ressam admitted the passport was fraudulent and claimed political asylum. \nHe was released pending a hearing, which he failed to attend. His political asylum claim was denied. He was \narrested again, released again, and given another hearing date. Again, he did not show. He was arrested four \ntimes\n\nfor thievery, usually from tourists, but was neither jailed nor deported. He also supported himself by selling stolen \ndocuments to a friend who was a document broker for Islamist terrorists.  \n\nRessam eventually obtained a genuine Canadian passport through a document vendor who stole a blank baptismal \ncertificate from a Catholic church. With this document he was able to obtain a Canadian passport under the name \nof Benni Antoine Noris. This enabled him to travel to Pakistan, and from there to Afghanistan for his training, and \nthen return to Canada. Impressed, Abu Zubaydah asked Ressam to get more genuine Canadian passports and to \nsend them to him for other terrorists to use.  \n\nAnother conspirator, Abdelghani Meskini, used a stolen identity to travel to Seattle on December 11, 1999, at the \nrequest of Mokhtar Haouari, another conspirator. Haouari provided fraudulent passports and visas to assist Ressam \nand Meskini's planned getaway from the United States to Algeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.   One of Meskini's \nassociates, Abdel Hakim Tizegha, also filed a claim for political asylum. He was released pending a hearing, \nwhich was adjourned and rescheduled five times. His claim was finally denied two years after his initial filing. His \nattorney appealed the decision, and Tizegha was allowed to remain in the country pending the appeal. Nine \nmonths later, his attorney notified the court that he could not locate his client. A warrant of deportation was issued.  \n\nSidebar 4: \n\nAtta's Alleged Trip to Prague \n\nMohamed Atta is known to have been in Prague on two occasions: in December 1994, when he stayed one night at \na transit hotel, and in June 2000, when he was en route to the United States. On the latter occasion, he arrived by \nbus from Germany, on June 2, and departed for Newark the following day.  \n\nThe allegation that Atta met with an Iraqi intelligence officer in Prague in April 2001 originates from the reporting of \na single source of the Czech intelligence service. Shortly after 9/11, the source reported having seen Atta meet with \nAhmad Khalil Ibrahim Samir al Ani, an Iraqi diplomat, at the Iraqi Embassy in Prague on April 9, 2001, at 11:00 A. \nM. This information was passed to CIA headquarters.\n\nThe U. S. legal attache (\"Legat\") in Prague, the representative of the FBI, met with the Czech service's source. \nAfter the meeting, the assessment of the Legat and the Czech officers present was that they were 70 percent sure \n\n\n\nthat the source was sincere and believed his own story of the meeting. Subsequently, the Czech intelligence \nservice publicly stated that there was a 70 percent probability that the meeting between Atta and Ani had taken \nplace. The Czech Interior Minister also made several statements to the press about his belief that the meeting had \noccurred, and the story was widely reported.\n\nThe FBI has gathered evidence indicating that Atta was in Virginia Beach on April 4 (as evidenced by a bank \nsurveillance camera photo), and in Coral Springs, Florida on April 11, where he and Shehhi leased an apartment. \nOn April 6, 9, 10, and 11, Atta's cellular telephone was used numerous times to call various lodging establishments \nin Florida from cell sites within Florida. We cannot confirm that he placed those calls. But there are no U. S. records \nindicating that Atta departed the country during this period. Czech officials have reviewed their flight and border \nrecords as well for any indication that Atta was in the Czech Republic in April 2001, including records of anyone \ncrossing the border who even looked Arab. They have also reviewed pictures from the area near the Iraqi embassy \nand have not discovered photos of anyone who looked like Atta. No evidence has been found that Atta was in the \nCzech Republic in April 2001.\n\nAccording to the Czech government, Ani, the Iraqi officer alleged to have met with Atta, was about 70 miles away \nfrom Prague on April 8-9 and did not return until the afternoon of the ninth, while the source was firm that the \nsighting occurred at 11:00 A. M. When questioned about the reported April 2001 meeting, Ani - now in custody - \nhas denied ever\n\nmeeting or having any contact with Atta. Ani says that shortly after 9/11, he became concerned that press stories \nabout the alleged meeting might hurt his career. Hoping to clear his name, Ani asked his superiors to approach the \nCzech government about refuting the allegation. He also denies knowing of any other Iraqi official having contact \nwith Atta.\n\nThese findings cannot absolutely rule out the possibility that Atta was in Prague on April 9, 2001. He could have \nused an alias to travel and a passport under that alias, but this would be an exception to his practice of using his \ntrue name while traveling (as he did in January and would in July when he took his next overseas trip). The FBI and \nCIA have uncovered no evidence that Atta held any fraudulent passports.\n\nKSM and Binalshibh both deny that an Atta-Ani meeting occurred. There was no reason for such a meeting, \nespecially considering the risk it would pose to the operation. By April 2001, all four pilots had completed most of \ntheir training, and the muscle hijackers were about to begin entering the United States.\n\nThe available evidence does not support the original Czech report of an Atta-Ani meeting.  \n\nSidebar 5: \n\nThe following is the text of an item from the Presidential Daily Brief received by President George W. Bush on \nAugust 6, 2001.    Redacted material is indicated by brackets. \n\nBin Ladin Determined To Strike in US\n\nClandestine, foreign government, and media reports indicate Bin Ladin since 1997 has wanted to conduct terrorist \nattacks in the US. Bin Ladin implied in US television interviews in 1997 and 1998 that his followers would follow the \nexample ofWorld Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef and \"bring the fighting to America. \"\n\n        After US missile strikes on his base in Afghanistan in 1998, Bin\n\n        Ladin told followers he wanted to retaliate in Washington,\n\n        according to a [ - ] service. An Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ)\n\n        operative told an [ - ] service at the same time that Bin Ladin\n\n        was planning to exploit the operative's access to the US to mount a\n\n        terrorist strike.\n\n\n\nThe millennium plotting in Canada in 1999 may have been part of Bin Ladin's first serious attempt to implement a \nterrorist strike in the US. Convicted plotter Ahmed Ressam has told the FBI that he conceived the idea to attack Los \nAngeles International Airport himself, but that Bin Ladin lieutenant Abu Zubaydah encouraged him and helped \nfacilitate the operation. Ressam also said that in 1998 Abu Zubaydah was planning his own US attack.\n\n        Ressam says Bin Ladin was aware of the Los Angeles operation.\n\nAlthough Bin Ladin has not succeeded, his attacks against the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 \ndemonstrate that he prepares operations years in advance and is not deterred by setbacks. Bin Ladin associates \nsurveilled our Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam as early as 1993, and some members of the Nairobi cell \nplanning the bombings were arrested and deported in 1997.\n\nAl-Qa'ida members - including some who are US citizens - have resided in or traveled to the US for years, and the \ngroup apparently maintains a support structure that could aid attacks. Two al-Qua' da members found\n\nguilty in the conspiracy to bomb our embassies in East Africa were US citizens, and a senior EIJ member lived in \nCalifornia in the mid-1990s.\n\n        A clandestine source said in 1998 that a Bin Ladin cell in New York\n\n        was recruiting Muslim-American youth for attacks.\n\nWe have not been able to corroborate some of the more sensational threat reporting, such as that from a [ - ] \nservice in 1998 saying that Bin Ladin wanted to hijack a US aircraft to gain the release of \"Blind Shaykh\" 'Umar 'Abd \nal-Rahman and other US-held extremists.\n\nNevertheless, FBI information since that time indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with \npreparations for hijackings or other types of attacks, including recent surveillance of federal buildings in New York.\n\nThe FBI is conducting approximately 70 full field investigations throughout the US that it considers Bin Ladin-\nrelated. CIA and the FBI are investigating a call to our Embassy in the UAE in May saying that a group of Bin Ladin \nsupporters was in the US planning attacks with explosives.\n\nSidebar 6: \n\nFlights of Saudi Nationals Leaving the United States \n\nThree questions have arisen with respect to the departure of Saudi nationals from the United States in the \nimmediate aftermath of 9/11: (1) Did any flights of Saudi nationals take place before national airspace reopened on \nSeptember 13, 2001? (2) Was there any political intervention to facilitate the departure of Saudi nationals? (3) Did \nthe FBI screen Saudi nationals thoroughly before their departure?\n\nFirst, we found no evidence that any flights of Saudi nationals, domestic or international, took place before the \nreopening of national airspace on the morning of September 13, 2001.   To the contrary, every flight we have \nidentified occurred after national airspace reopened.  \n\nSecond, we found no evidence of political intervention. We found no evidence that anyone at the White House \nabove the level of Richard Clarke participated in a decision on the departure of Saudi nationals. The issue came up \nin one of the many video teleconferences of the interagency group Clarke chaired, and Clarke said he approved of \nhow the FBI was dealing with the matter when it came up for interagency discussion at his level. Clarke told us, \"I \nasked the FBI, Dale Watson . . . to handle that, to check to see if that was all right with them, to see if they wanted \naccess to any of these people, and to get back to me. And if they had no objections, it would be fine with me. \" \nClarke added, \"I have no recollection of clearing it with anybody at the White House. \"  \n\nAlthough White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card remembered someone telling him about the Saudi request \nshortly after 9/11, he said he had not talked to the Saudis and did not ask anyone to do anything about it. The \nPresident and Vice President told us they were not aware of the issue at all until it surfaced much later in the media. \nNone of the officials we interviewed recalled any intervention or direction on this matter from any political appointee.  \n\n\n\nThird, we believe that the FBI conducted a satisfactory screening of Saudi nationals who left the United States on \ncharter flights.   The Saudi government was advised of and agreed to the FBI's requirements that passengers be \nidentified and checked against various databases before the flights departed.   The Federal Aviation Administration \nrepresentative working in the FBI operations center made sure that the\n\nFBI was aware of the flights of Saudi nationals and was able to screen the passengers before they were allowed to \ndepart.  \n\nThe FBI interviewed all persons of interest on these flights prior to their departures. They concluded that none of the \npassengers was connected to the 9/11 attacks and have since found no evidence to change that conclusion. Our \nown independent review of the Saudi nationals involved confirms that no one with known links to terrorism departed \non these flights.  \n\nSidebar 7: \n\nOperational Opportunities \n\n1. January 2000: the CIA does not watchlist Khalid al Mihdhar or notify the FBI when it learned Mihdhar possessed \na valid U. S. visa.\n\n2. January 2000: the CIA does not develop a transnational plan for tracking Mihdhar and his associates so that they \ncould be followed to Bangkok and onward, including the United States.\n\n3. March 2000: the CIA does not watchlist Nawaf al Hazmi or notify the FBI when it learned that he possessed a U. \nS. visa and had flown to Los Angeles on January 15, 2000.\n\n4. January 2001: the CIA does not inform the FBI that a source had identified Khallad, or Tawfiq bin Attash, a major \nfigure in the October 2000 bombing of the USS Cole , as having attended the meeting in Kuala Lumpur with Khalid \nal Mihdhar.\n\n5. May 2001: a CIA official does not notify the FBI about Mihdhar's U. S. visa, Hazmi's U. S. travel, or Khallad's \nhaving attended the Kuala Lumpur meeting (identified when he reviewed all of the relevant traffic because of the \nhigh level of threats).\n\n6. June 2001: FBI and CIA officials do not ensure that all relevant information regarding the Kuala Lumpur meeting \nwas shared with the Cole investigators at the June 11 meeting.\n\n7. August 2001: the FBI does not recognize the significance of the information regarding Mihdhar and Hazmi's \npossible arrival in the United States and thus does not take adequate action to share information, assign resources, \nand give sufficient priority to the search.\n\n8. August 2001: FBI headquarters does not recognize the significance of the information regarding Moussaoui's \ntraining and beliefs and thus does not take adequate action to share information, involve higher-level officials \nacross agencies, obtain information regarding Moussaoui's ties to al Qaeda, and give sufficient priority to \ndetermining what Moussaoui might be planning.\n\n9. August 2001: the CIA does not focus on information that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is a key al Qaeda lieutenant \nor connect information identifying KSM as the \"Mukhtar\"mentioned in other reports to the analysis that could have \nlinked \"Mukhtar\" with Ramzi Binalshibh and Moussaoui.\n\n10. August 2001: the CIA and FBI do not connect the presence of Mihdhar, Hazmi, and Moussaoui to the general \nthreat reporting about imminent attacks.\n\nSidebar 8: \n\n\n\nConsider this hypothetical case. The NSA discovers that a suspected terrorist is traveling to Bangkok and Kuala \nLumpur. The NCTC should draw on joint intelligence resources, including its own NSA counterterrorism experts, to \nanalyze the identities and possible destinations of these individuals. Informed by this analysis, the NCTC would \nthen organize and plan the management of the case, drawing on the talents and differing kinds of experience \namong the several agency representatives assigned to it - assigning tasks to the CIA overseas, to Homeland \nSecurity watching entry points into the United States, and to the FBI. If military assistance might be needed, the \nSpecial Operations Command could be asked to develop an appropriate concept for such an operation. The NCTC \nwould be accountable for tracking the progress of the case, ensuring that the plan evolved with it, and integrating \nthe information into a warning. The NCTC would be responsible for being sure that intelligence gathered from the \nactivities in the field became part of the government's institutional memory about Islamist terrorist personalities, \norganizations, and possible means of attack.\n\nIn each case the involved agency would make its own senior managers aware of what it was being asked to do. If \nthose agency heads objected, and the issue could not easily be resolved, then the disagreement about roles and \nmissions could be brought before the National Security Council and the president.\n\nSidebar 9: \n\nMembers of the U.

a convincing explanation of why Atta and Omari drove \nto Portland,Maine,from Boston on the morning of September 10,only to return to Logan on Flight 5930 on the \nmorning of September 11.However,Atta reacted negatively when informed in Portland that he would have to check \nin again in Boston.Michael Touhey interview (May 27,2004).Whatever their reason,the Portland Jetport was the \nnearest airport to Boston with a 9/11 flight that would have arrived at Logan in time for the passengers to transfer to \nAmerican Airlines Flight 11,which had a scheduled departure time of 7:45 A.M.SeeTomKinton interview \n(Nov.6,2003);Portland International Jetport site visit (Aug.18,2003).\n\nLike the other two airports used by the 9/11 hijackers (Newark Liberty International Airport and Washington Dulles \nInternational Airport),Boston's Logan International Airport was a \"Category X\"airport:i.e.,among the largest facilities \nliable to highest threat,and generally subject to greater security requirements.See FAA report,\"Civil Aviation \nSecurity Reference Handbook,\"May 1999,pp.117-118.Though Logan was selected for two of the hijackings (as \nwere both American and United Airlines),we found no evidence that the terrorists targeted particular airports or \nairlines.Nothing stands out about any of them with respect to the only security layer that was relevant to the actual \nhijackings:checkpoint screening.See FAA briefing materials,\"Assessment and Testing Data for BOS, EWR,and \nIAD,\"Oct.24,2001.Despite security problems at Logan (see,e.g.,two local Fox 25 television investigative reports in \nFebruary and April 2001,and an email in August 2001 from a former FAA special agent to the agency's leadership \nregarding his concerns about lax security at the airport),no evidence suggests that such issues entered into the \nterrorists'targeting:they simply booked heavily fueled east-to-west transcontinental flights of the large Boeing aircraft \nthey trained to fly that were scheduled to take off at nearly the same time.See Matt Carroll, \"Fighting Terror Sense \nof Alarm;Airlines Foiled Police Logan Probe,\" Boston Globe, Oct.17,2001,p.B1.\n\n2.CAPPS was an FAA-approved automated system run by the airlines that scored each passenger's profile to \nidentify those who might pose a threat to civil aviation.The system also chose passengers at random to receive \nadditional security scrutiny.Ten out of the 19 hijackers (including 9 out of 10 on the two American Airlines flights) \nwere identified via the CAPPS system.According to the procedures in place on 9/11,in addition to those flagged by \nthe CAPPS algorithm,American's ticket agents were to mark as \"selectees\"those passengers who did not provide \ncorrect responses to the required security questions,failed to show proper identification,or met other crite-ria.See \nFAA report,\"Air Carrier Standard Security Program,\"May 2001,pp.75-76;FAA record of interview,Donna \nThompson,Sept.23,2001;Chuck Severance interview (Apr.15,2004);Jim Dillon interview (Apr.15,2004);Diane \nGraney interview (Apr.16,2004).It appears that Atta was selected at random.See Al Hickson briefing (June 8, 2004).\n\n3.The call was placed from a pay phone in Terminal C (between the screening checkpoint and United 175's \nboarding gate).We presume Shehhi made the call,but we cannot be sure.Logan International Airport site visit \n(Aug.15,2003);see also FBI response to Commission briefing request no.6,undated (topic 11).\n\n4.Flight 11 pushed back from Gate 32 in Terminal B at 7:40.See AAL response to the Commission's February \n3,2004,requests,Mar.15,2004.\n\n5.See UAL letter,\"Flight 175 - 11Sep01 Passenger ACI Check-in History,\"July 11,2002.Customer service \nrepresentative Gail Jawahir recalled that her encounter with the Ghamdis occurred at \"shortly before 7 A.M.,\"and \nwhen shown photos of the hijackers,she indicated that Mohand al Shehri resembled one of the two she checked in \n(suggesting they were Banihammad and Shehri).However,she also recalled that the men had the same last name \nand had assigned seats on row 9 (i.e.,the Ghamdis),and that account has been adopted here.In either case,she \nalmost certainly was dealing with one set of the Flight 175 hijackers.See FBI reports of investigation,interviews of \nGail Jawahir,Sept.21,2001;Sept.28,2001.Even had the hijackers been unable to understand and answer the two \n\n\n\nstandard security questions,the only consequence would have been the screening of their carry-on and checked \nbags for explosives.See FAA report,\"Air Carrier Standard Security Program,\"May 2001,p.76.\n\n6.For Flight 11,two checkpoints provided access to the gate.The second was opened at 7:15 A.M. The FAA \nconducted many screener evaluations between September 11,1999,and September 11,2001.At the primary check-\npoints,in aggregate,screeners met or exceeded the average for overall,physical search,and X-ray detection,while \nfalling below the norm for metal detection.No FAA Special Assessments (by \"red teams\") were done at Logan \nsecurity checkpoints during the two years prior to September 11,2001.See FAA briefing materials,\"Assessment and \nTesting Data for BOS,EWR,and IAD,\"Oct.24,2001.\n\n7.See Air Transport Association/Regional Airlines Association (ATA/RAA) report,\"Air Carriers Checkpoint \nOperations Guide,\"Aug.1999;FAA report,\"Air Carrier Standard Security Program,\"May 2001,appendix VI.\n\n8.Mary Carol Turano interview (Mar.11,2004);FBI reports of investigation,interview of Nilda Cora,Oct.4, \n2001;interview ofWilliam Thomas,Sept.14,2001;interview of Jennifer Gore,Sept.12,2001;interview of Claudia \nRichey,Sept.15,2001;interview of Rosarito Rivera,Sept.25,2001.\n\n9.See TSA report,\"Selectee Status of September 11th Hijackers,\"undated.For boarding and seating informa-\ntion,see AAL record,SABRE information on Flight 11,Sept.11,2001.These boarding times from the American system \nare approximate only;for Flight 11,they indicated that some passengers \"boarded\"after the aircraft had pushed back \nfrom the gate.See AAL response to the Commission's February 3,2004,requests,Mar.15,2004.\n\n10.See TSA report,\"Selectee Status of September 11th Hijackers,\"undated;see also UAL letter,\"Flight 175 -

The \nshortest time frame assumes maximum speed without regard to overspeed warnings,a straight-line path,and no \ntime allowed for maneuvering or slowing to aim and crash the airplane into its target.The probable time frame \nallows for speeds consistent with the observed operation of the airplane prior to its final maneuvers and crash,as \nwell as for maneuvers and slowing in the D.C.area to take aim.According to radar data,the fighters from Langley Air \n\n\n\nForce Base arrived over Washington at about 10:00 A.M.Two of the three Langley fighters were fully armed \n(i.e.,with missiles

whether or not the information was \nsubject to the attorney general's order - which required approval before the report's contents could be shared with \ncriminal investigators.Ibid.On the several reviews of the process,see Bellows Report,pp.709,722; DOJ Inspector \nGeneral report,\"The Handling of FBI Intelligence Information Related to the Justice Department's Campaign \nFinance Investigation,\"July 1999,pp.15-16,255,256,328-330,340,344;GAO report,\"FBI Intelligence \nInvestigations:Coordination Within Justice on Counterintelligence Criminal Matters Is Limited,\"July 2001, pp.3-5.\n\n38.In December 1999,NSA began placing caveats on all of its Bin Ladin reports that precluded sharing of any of the \nreports'contents with criminal prosecutors or FBI agents investigating criminal matters without first obtaining OIPR's \npermission.These caveats were initially created at the direction of Attorney General Reno and applied solely to \nreports of information gathered from three specific surveillances she had authorized.Because NSA decided it was \nadministratively too difficult to determine whether particular reports derived from the specific surveillances \n\n\n\nauthorized by the attorney general,NSA decided to place this caveat on all its terrorism-related reports.In November \n2000,in response to direction from the FISA Court,NSA modified these caveats to require that consent for sharing \nthe information with prosecutors or criminal agents be obtained from NSA's Customer Needs and Delivery Services \ngroup.See DOJ memo,Reno to Freeh,E.O.12333 authorized surveillance of a suspected al Qaeda \noperative,Dec.24,1999;NSA email,William L.to Brian C.,\"dissemination of terrorism reporting,\"Dec.29,1999; NSA \nmemo,Ann D.to others,\"Reporting Guidance,\"Dec.30.1999;Intelligence report,Nov.6,2000.See also discussion of \nthe history of the NSA caveats in the notes to Chapter 8.\n\n39.See DEA report,\"DEA Staffing & Budget\"(figures for 1972 to 2003) (online at  http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/  \nagency/staffing.htm).For USMS staffing,see DOJ information provided to the Commission.\n\n40.On the number of agents,see INS newsletter,\"INS Commissioner Meissner Announces Departure,\"Jan. \n2001;INS news release,\"INS to Hire More than 800 Immigration Inspectors Nationwide,\"Jan.12,2001;Gregory \nBednarz prepared statement,Oct.9,2003,p.5.On the INS's main challenges,see,e.g.,Eric Holder interview (Jan. \n28,2004);Jamie Gorelick interview (Jan.13,2004);Doris Meissner interview (Nov.25,2003).On the White House \nviews,see,e.g.,White House press release,\"Fact Sheet on Immigration Enforcement Act,\"May 3,1995.On DOJ's \nconcerns,see INS newsletter,Remarks of Attorney General Reno on Oct.24,2000,Jan.2001,pp.16,26.To assess \ncongressional views,we reviewed all conference and committee reports relating to congressional action on INS \nbudget requests for fiscal years 1995 through 2001 and all Senate and House immigration hearings from 1993 to \n2001.On outdated technology,see Gus de la Vina interview (Nov.19,2003);Doris Meissner interview (Nov.25, 2003).\n\n41.On Meissner's response,see Doris Meissner interview (Nov.25,2003).On the lookout unit,see Tim G. interview \n(Oct.1,2002).On the number of denials of entry,see Majority Staff Report,Hearing on \"Foreign Terrorists in \nAmerica:Five Years after the World Trade Center\"before the Subcommittee on Technology,Terrorism, and \nGovernment Information of the Senate Judiciary Committee,Feb.24,1998,p.145.\n\n42.Majority Staff Report,Hearing on \"Foreign Terrorists in America:Five Years after the World Trade Cen-\nter,\"Feb.24,1998,p.152;8 U.S.C.[sect] 1534(e)(1)(A).On the low level of removals,see Daniel Cadman interview \n(Oct.9,2003);Rocky Concepcion interview (June 15,2004).\n\n43.On the 1986 plan,see INS report,Investigations Division,\"Alien Terrorists and Undesirables:A Contingency \nPlan,\"May 1986;Daniel Cadman interview (Oct.17,2003).On the 1995 plan,see INS memo,Bramhall to Bednarz and \nHurst,\"Draft Counter-Terrorism Strategy Outline,\"Aug.11,1995.On the 1997 plan,see INS email, Cadman to \nothers,\"EAC briefing document,\"Dec.5,1997 (attachment titled \"Counterterrorism/National Secu-\n\nrity Strategy and Casework Oversight\").On the work of the National Security Unit and the Intelligence Unit,see \nDaniel Cadman interview (Oct.17,2003);Cliff Landesman interview (Oct.27,2003).\n\n44.For number of agents on Canadian border,the Canadian situation generally,and the inspector general's rec-\nommendations,see INS report,\"Northern Border Strategy,\"Jan.9,2001;DOJ Inspector General report,\"Follow-up \nReview of the Border Patrol Efforts Along the Northern Border,\"Apr.2000 (inspection plan).On terrorists entering the \nUnited States via Canada,see,e.g.,INS record,Record of Deportable Alien,Abu Mezer,June 24,1996.

After \nrepeatedly demanding that Sudan stop supporting terrorist groups,in 1993 the U.S.government designated the \ncountry a state sponsor of terrorism.Diplomatic discussions continued but had little impact on Sudanese support for \nterrorism or on other issues,such as human rights.In the fall of 1995,the United States conducted a Sudan policy \nreview and,supported by a vocal segment of Congress,the White House sought to pressure and isolate the \nSudanese.Susan Rice interview (Jan.9,2004).\n\nAfter Bin Ladin left Sudan in May 1996,some State Department officials,including Ambassador Carney,crit-icized \nthe NSC's hard-line policy,which he felt provided no \"carrots\"for Sudanese moderates to cooperate on \ncounterterrorism.He also faulted the NSC for not reopening the U.S.embassy in Khartoum (closed in early 1996) \nwhen security concerns there were reevaluated.State's Sudan desk officer agreed,noting that the embassy was an \nexcellent vehicle for gathering information on terrorists.According to one State official,NSC policymakers'views were \ntoo firmly set to engage and test the Sudanese on counterterrorism.Timothy Carney interview (Dec.4,2003); David \nShinn interview (Aug.29,2003);Stephen Schwartz interview (Dec.30,2003).\n\nBut supporters of the tough line,such as the NSC's Susan Rice,argued that any conciliatory statements from \nKhartoum belied its unhelpful actions.For example,she noted,though Sudan did eventually expel Bin Ladin,his al \nQaeda network retained a presence in the country.Susan Rice interview (Jan.9,2004).In addition,the CIA's Africa \nDivision,whose operatives had engaged the Sudanese on counterterrorism in early 1996,would conclude that \"there \nis no indication that Sudanese involvement with terrorism has decreased in the past year.\"They saw the Sudanese \ngestures toward cooperating as \"tactical retreats\"aimed at deceiving Washington in hopes of having sanctions \nremoved.CIA memo,Walter to Acting DCI,\"Africa Division's Recommendations Regarding Sudan,\"Dec. 17,1996.The \nCIA official who ran the Sudanese portfolio and met with the Sudanese on numerous occasions told us the \nSudanese were not going to deliver,and the perceived moderates \"were just flat-out lying.\"Mark interview (May \n12,2004).\n\nIn February 1997,the Sudanese sent letters to President Clinton and Secretary of State Albright,extending an \ninvitation for a U.S.counterterrorism inspection mission to visit Sudan.The Sudanese also used private U.S.citi-zens \nto pass along offers to cooperate.Mansoor Ijaz interview (May 7,2004);Janet McElligot interview (Oct.20, 2003).But \nthese offers were dismissed because the NSC viewed Sudan as all talk and little action.U.S.officials also feared that \nthe Sudanese would exploit any positive American responses,including trips to the region by U.S.offi-cials,for their \nown political purposes.See Joint Inquiry interview of David Williams,June 26,2002.Today,Sudan is still listed as a \nstate sponsor of terrorism.\n\n8.Mike interview (Dec.11,2003).On local contacts,see Gary Schroen interview (Mar.3,2004).On \"Jeff's\" views,see \nCIA memo,\"DCI Talking Points Regarding Operations Against Usama Bin Ladin,\"Aug.25,1997.\n\n9.See Joint Inquiry briefing by Mike,Sept.12,2002.For briefings to the NSC,see NSC email,Clarke to Berger, \"Threat \nWarning:Usama bin Ladin,\"Mar.7,1998;Mary McCarthy interview (Dec.8,2003);CIA memos,sum-mary of weekly \nBerger/Tenet meeting,May 1,1998.\n\n10.CIA memos,summary of weekly Berger/Tenet meeting,May 1,1998.\n\n11.Karl Inderfurth interview (Feb.18,2004).\n\n\n\n12.Peter Tomsen interview (Oct.8,2003).\n\n13.For State Department officials'views,see Strobe Talbott interview (Jan.15,2004);Karl Inderfurth interview \n(Feb.18,2004).\n\n14.On the civil war and UNOCAL,see Karl Inderfurth interview (Feb.18,2004);Robin Raphel interview \n(Dec.8,2003).The former UNOCAL chief for the pipeline project,Marty Miller,denied working exclusively with the \nTaliban and told us that his company sought to work with all Afghan factions to bring about the necessary stability to \nproceed with the project.Marty Miller interview (Nov.7,2003).UNOCAL hired,among others,Robert Oakley, the \nformer ambassador to Pakistan.

\nbegin working with al Qaeda until after the 1998 East Africa embassy bombings.Intelligence reports,inter-rogations \nof KSM,Nov.21,2003;Jan.9,2004;Feb.19,2004.\n\n2.Those detainees are Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,Abu Zubaydah,Riduan Isamuddin (also known as Ham-bali),Abd \nal Rahim al Nashiri,Tawfiq bin Attash (also known as Khallad),Ramzi Binalshibh,Mohamed al Kah-tani,Ahmad Khalil \nIbrahim Samir al Ani,Ali Abd al Rahman al Faqasi al Ghamdi (also known as Abu Bakr al Azdi), and Hassan Ghul.\n\n3. On KSM's relationship to Yousef and his ethnicity, see CIA analytic report, Khalid Sheik Muhammad's \nNephews,CTC 2003-300013,Jan.31,2003.On KSM's biography,see Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM, July \n12,2003;FBI electronic communication,requests for information on KSM colleges/universities,June 10,2002.\n\n4.In an uncorroborated post-capture claim that may be mere bravado,KSM has stated that he considered \nassassinating Rabbi Meir Kahane when Kahane lectured in Greensboro at some point between 1984 and \n1986.Intel-ligence report,interrogation of KSM,July 12,2003.On KSM's connection to Sayyaf,see Intelligence \nreports, interrogations of KSM,July 3,2003;July 12,2003;FBI electronic communication,\"Summary of Information \u2026 \nwith regard to ...KSM,\"July 8,1999.On KSM's battle experience and his electronics work,see Intelligence reports, \ninterrogations of KSM,July 3,2003;July 12,2003.On KSM's anti-Soviet activities,see Intelligence report,inter-rogation \nof KSM,Feb.17,2004 (in which KSM says he apparently met Bin Ladin for the first time when the Sayyaf group and \nBin Ladin's Arab mujahideen group were next to each other along the front line).\n\n5.Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,July 12,2003 (in which KSM also notes that his group continued fighting in \nthe Jalalabad area,and his brother Abid was killed there).KSM claims that Ramzi Yousef visited the NGO's \nestablishment in Jalalabad while Yousef was undergoing training.KSM adds that between 1993 and 1996, he \ntraveled to China,the Philippines,Pakistan,Bosnia (a second time),Brazil,Sudan,and Malaysia.Most,if not all, of this \ntravel appears to have been related to his abiding interest in carrying out terrorist operations.Although KSM claims \nthat Sheikh Abdallah was not a member,financier,or supporter of al Qaeda,he admits that Abdallah underwrote a \n1995 trip KSM took to join the Bosnia jihad.Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,July 23,2003.\n\n6.On KSM's learning of Yousef's plans,see Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,Jan.9,2004 (in which KSM also \ncontends that Yousef never divulged to him the intended target of the attack).On KSM/Yousef phone \nconversations,see Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,Feb.17,2004 (in which KSM also says that most of his \nphone conversations with Yousef were social in nature,but that Yousef did discuss mixing explosives ingredients \nonce or twice and that on one occasion,Yousef asked him to send the passport Yousef had in his true name,Abdul \nBasit).On KSM's money transfer,see FBI report,Tradebom investigation,Mar.20,1993.\n\n7.Evidence gathered at the time of Yousef's February 1995 arrest included dolls wearing clothes containing \nnitrocellulose.FBI evidence,Manila air investigation.On KSM's rationale for attacking the United States,see \nIntelligence report,interrogation of KSM,Sept.5,2003 (in this regard,KSM's statements echo those of Yousef,who \ndelivered an extensive polemic against U.S.foreign policy at his January 1998 sentencing).On the Manila air plot, \nsee Intelligence reports,interrogations of KSM,Apr.17,2003;July 12,2003 (in which KSM also says bojinka is not \nSerbo-Croatian for \"big bang,\"as has been widely reported,but rather a nonsense word he adopted after hearing\n\n\n\nit on the front lines in Afghanistan).According to KSM,the plot was to receive financing from a variety of sources, \nincluding associates of co-conspirator Wali Khan and KSM's own funds.Intelligence reports,interrogations of KSM, \nNov.26,2003;Jan.9,2004; Feb.19,2004.On activities during the summer of 1994,see Intelligence reports,inter-\nrogations of KSM,May 3,2003;July 12,2003; Nov.10,2003;Feb.21,2004;Feb.24,2004.\n\n8.On recruiting Wali Khan in Karachi,see FBI report of investigation,interview of Abdul Hakim Murad,Apr. \n13,1995;Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,July 12,2003 (in which KSM recounts how he knew Wali Khan from \nAfghanistan).On the testing of the timer,see Brief for the United States of America, United States v. Ramzi Ahmed \nYousef, No.98-1041(L) (2d Cir.filed Aug.25,2000),pp.85-86,88-91.The latter explosion caused the death of a \npassenger and extensive damage to the aircraft,which was forced to make an emergency landing in Okinawa.In \n1996,Yousef was convicted on charges arising out of the Bojinka plot,including the bombing of the Philippine \nAirlines flight.See ibid.,p.8.On KSM's travels,see generally Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM, July \n12,2003.Yousef managed to escape to Pakistan,but his accomplice,Murad - whom KSM claims to have sent to \nYousef with $3,000 to help fund the operation - was arrested and disclosed details of the plot while under inter-\nrogation.Contrary to Murad's confession,in which he described his intended role as one of the five operatives who \nwould plant bombs on board the targeted aircraft,KSM has said that Murad's role was limited to carrying the $3,000 \nfrom Dubai to Manila.Intelligence reports,interrogations of KSM,Feb.19,2004;(two reports);Feb.24,2004;Apr. \n2,2004.This aspect of KSM's account is not credible,as it conflicts not just with Murad's confession but also with \nphysical evidence tying Murad to the very core of the plot,and with KSM's own statements elsewhere that Murad \nwas involved in planning and executing the operation.Intelligence reports,interrogations of KSM,Aug.18,2003; \nJan.9,2004;Feb.24,2004 (in which KSM also claims that while he was in Qatar in February 1995,he and Yousef \nconsulted by telephone regarding the cargo carrier plan,and Yousef proceeded with the operation despite KSM's \nadvice that he hide instead).We have uncovered no evidence that KSM was present at the guesthouse in \nIslamabad where Yousef's arrest took place,as has been suggested in the press.\n\n9.Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,July 12,2003.KSM's presence in Bosnia coincided with a police station \nbombing in Zagreb where the timing device of the bomb (a modified Casio watch) resembled those manufactured \nby KSM and Yousef in the Philippines for the Manila air operation.FBI report,Manila air investigation, May \n23,1999.On the Sudanese trip and Afghanistan,see Intelligence report,interrogation of SM,July 12,2003 (in which \nKSM also claims to have encountered Sayf al Adl while in Yemen;apparently KSM has not divulged the substance \nof this meeting).\n\n10.Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,Jan.9,2004.In another interrogation report,however,KSM downplays the \nsignificance of his relationship to Yousef in enabling him to meet with Bin Ladin.Specifically,KSM notes that Yousef \nwas not a member of al Qaeda and that Yousef never met Bin Ladin.Intelligence report,interro-gation of \nKSM,Feb.19,2004.\n\n11.Intelligence reports,interrogations of KSM,July 12,2003;Jan.9,2004;Feb.19,2004.With respect to KSM's \nadditional proposal to bomb cargo planes by shipping jackets containing nitrocellulose,KSM states that Bin Ladin \nexpressed interest in changing the operation so that it would involve a suicide operative.Intelligence report,inter-\nrogation of KSM,Nov.10,2003.\n\n12.Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,Feb.19,2004.\n\n13.Probably inflating his own role,KSM says he and a small group of colleagues,including Yousef and Wali \nKhan,were among the earliest advocates of attacking the United States.KSM asserts that Bin Ladin and some of \nthe other jihadist leaders concentrated on overthrowing Arab regimes and argued for limiting confrontation with the \nUnited States to places like Somalia.On KSM's description of Bin Ladin's agenda,see Intelligence report,inter-\nrogation of KSM,Nov.13,2003.As discussed in chapter 2,we do not agree with this assessment.On Bin Ladin's \nreactions to KSM's proposal,see Intelligence reports,interrogations of KSM,July 12,2003;Jan.9,2004;Feb.19, \n2004.On KSM's intent to target the United States and Bin Ladin's interest in Somalia,see Intelligence report,inter-\nrogation of KSM,Nov.13,2003.\n\n14.On KSM's independence,see Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,Jan.9,2004.Even after he began working \nwith Bin Ladin and al Qaeda,KSM concealed from them his ongoing relationship with Sayyaf.Intelli-gence \nreport,interrogation of KSM,July 30,2003.Although KSM says he would have accepted the support of another \norganization to stage a 9/11-type operation,there is no evidence he ever peddled this idea to any other \n\n\n\ngroup.Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,Feb.19,2004.On his travels after meeting Bin Ladin,see Intelligence \nreport,interrogation of KSM,July 12,2003.Hambali also was one of the founders of Konsojaya,a Malaysian company \nrun by a close associate of Wali Khan.FBI report,Manila air investigation,May 23,1999.Hambali claims he was \nasked to serve on the company's board of directors as a formality and insists that he did not recognize the \n\"Arabs\"who were to run the company or play any role in its operations.Intelligence report,interrogation of Ham-\nbali,Nov.19,2003.\n\n15.Intelligence reports,interrogations of KSM,July 12,2003;Feb.19,2004 (two reports).KSM maintains that he \nprovided similar services for other mujahideen groups at this time,including the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group and a \ngroup headed by Abu Zubaydah.Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,Feb.19,2004.\n\n16.On KSM's understanding of Bin Ladin's commitment,see Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,Feb. \n19,2004.On KSM's assistance to al Qaeda,see Intelligence reports,interrogations of KSM,July 12,2003 (two \nreports).On Bin Ladin's decision to approve 9/11 operation,see Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,Jan.9, \n2004.KSM has observed that the East Africa bombings and the subsequent bombing of the USS Cole yielded a \nrecruiting bonanza for al Qaeda,as increasing numbers of Arab youth became enamored of the idea of waging jihad \nagainst the United States.Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,Sept.5,2003.\n\n17.On KSM's decision to move to Kandahar,see Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,Jan.9,2004. On the media \ncommittee,see Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,July 12,2003 (in which KSM also says that as head of the \nmedia committee,he would take charge of producing the propaganda video al Qaeda issued following the bombing \nof the USS Cole ).On the oath,see Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,Nov.13,2003 (in which KSM also claims \nhis reluctance stemmed from a concern that he would lose the ability to persevere with the 9/11 operation should \nBin Ladin subsequently decide to cancel it).\n\n18.On a possible Southeast Asian operation,see Intelligence report,interrogation of Hambali,Sept.4,2003.

See Peter Lance, 1000 Years for Revenge: International Terrorism and the FBI - the Untold Story \n\n(HarperCollins,2003),pp.278-280.In Murad's initial taped confession,he referred to an idea of crashing a plane into \nCIA headquarters.Lance gave us his copy of an apparent 1995 Philippine National Police document on an \ninterrogation of Murad.That document reports Murad describing his idea of crashing a plane into CIA headquar-\nters,but in this report Murad claims he was thinking of hijacking a commercial aircraft to do it,saying the idea had \ncome up in a casual conversation with Yousef with no specific plan for its execution.We have seen no pre-9/11 \nevidence that Murad referred in interrogations to the training of other pilots,or referred in this casual conversation to \ntargets other than the CIA.According to Lance,the Philippine police officer,who after 9/11 offered the much more \nelaborate account of Murad's statements reported in Lance's book,claims to have passed this added information to \nU.S.officials.But Lance states the Philippine officer declined to identify these officials.Peter Lance interview \n(Mar.15,2004).If such information was provided to a U.S.official,we have seen no indication that it was written down \nor disseminated within the U.S.government.Incidentally,KSM says he never discussed his idea for the planes \noperation with Murad,a person KSM regarded as a minor figure.Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,Apr.2,2004.\n\n34.Intelligence report,1996 Atef study on airplane hijacking operations, Sept.26,2001.\n\n35.Intelligence reports,interrogations of KSM,July 12,2003;Nov.6,2003.Abu Zubaydah,who worked closely with the \nal Qaeda leadership,has stated that KSM originally presented Bin Ladin with a scaled-down version of the 9/11 \nplan,and that Bin Ladin urged KSM to expand the operation with the comment,\"Why do you use an axe when you \ncan use a bulldozer?\"Intelligence report,interrogation of Abu Zubaydah,May 16,2003.The only possible \ncorroboration we have found for Abu Zubaydah's statement is Khallad's suggestion that Bin Ladin may have \nexpanded KSM's original idea for an attack using planes.Intelligence report,interrogation of Khallad,Apr.22, \n2004.Neither Abu Zubaydah nor Khallad claims to have been present when KSM says he first pitched his proposal \nto Bin Ladin in 1996.\n\n36.For the scheme's lukewarm reception,see Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,Nov.6,2003.For Bin Ladin's \nresponse,see Intelligence reports,interrogations of KSM,Aug.18,2003;Feb.19,2004.\n\n37.Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,Feb.19,2004.\n\n38.For KSM's joining al Qaeda,see Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,Nov.13,2003.KSM has provided \ninconsistent information about whether Bin Ladin first approved his proposal for what became the 9/11 attacks in \nlate 1998 or in early 1999.Compare Intelligence reports,interrogations of KSM,Aug.18,2003;Jan.9, \n2004;Feb.19,2004;Apr.3,2004.

negotiable instrument or other \ncommonly recognized method for the exchange of money.For example,a U.S.resident who wanted to send money \nto a person in another country,such as Pakistan,would give her money,in dollars,to a U.S.-based hawaladar.The \nU.S.hawaladar would then contact his counterpart in Pakistan,giving the Pakistani hawaladar the particulars of the \ntransaction,such as the amount of money,the code,and perhaps the identity of the recipient.The ultimate recipient in \nPakistan would then go to the Pakistani hawaladar and receive his money,in rupees,from whatever money the \nPakistani hawaladar has on hand.As far as the sender and ultimate recipient are concerned,the transaction is then \ncomplete.The two hawaladars would have a variety of mechanisms to settle their debt,either through offsetting \ntransactions (e.g.,someone in Pakistan sending money to the United States using the same two hawaladars),a \nperiodic settling wire transfer from the U.S.hawaladar's bank to the Pakistani hawaladar's bank,or a commercial \ntransaction,such as the U.S.hawaladar paying a debt or an invoice,in dollars,that the Pakistani hawaladar owes in \nthe United States.Hawalas typically do not have a large central control office for settling transactions,maintaining \ninstead a loose association with other hawaladars to transfer value,generally without any formal or legally binding \nagreements.See Treasury report,\"A Report to Congress in Accordance with Section 359 of the [USA PATRIOT \nAct]\"Nov.2002;Treasury report,\"Hawala:The Hawala Alternate Remittance System and

of insider trading in advance of 9/11 generally rest on reports of unusual pre-9/11 \ntrading activity in companies whose stock plummeted after the attacks.Some unusual trading did in fact occur,but \neach such trade proved to have an innocuous explanation.For example,the volume of put options - investments that \npay off only when a stock drops in price - surged in the parent companies of United Airlines on September 6 and \nAmerican Airlines on September 10 - highly suspicious trading on its face.Yet,further investigation has revealed that \nthe trading had no connection with 9/11.A single U.S.-based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al \nQaeda purchased 95 percent of the UAL puts on September 6 as part of a trading strategy that also included \nbuying 115,000 shares of American on September 10.Similarly,much of the seemingly suspicious trading in \nAmerican on September 10 was traced to a specific U.S.-based options trading newsletter,faxed to its subscribers \non Sunday,September 9,which recommended these trades.These examples typify the evidence examined by the \ninvestigation.The SEC and the FBI,aided by other agencies and the securities industry,devoted enormous \nresources to investigating this issue,including securing the cooperation of many foreign governments.These \ninvestigators have found that the apparently suspicious consistently proved innocuous.Joseph Cella interview \n(Sept. 16,2003;May 7,2004;May 10-11,2004);FBI briefing (Aug.15,2003);SEC memo,Division of Enforcement to \nSEC Chair and Commissioners,\"Pre-September 11,2001 Trading Review,\"May 15,2002;Ken Breen interview \n(Apr.23,2004);Ed G.interview (Feb.3,2004).\n\n131.The hijackers spent more than $270,000 in the United States,and the costs associated with Moussaoui were at \nleast $50,000.The additional expenses included travel to obtain passports and visas,travel to the United \nStates,expenses incurred by the plot leaders and facilitators,and the expenses incurred by the people selected to \n\n\n\nbe hijackers who ultimately did not participate.For many of these expenses,we have only fragmentary evidence \nand/or unconfirmed detainee reports,and can make only a rough estimate of costs.The $400,000 to $500,000 \nestimate does not include the cost of running training camps in Afghanistan,where the hijackers were recruited and \ntrained,or the marginal cost of the training itself.Finally,the architect of the plot,KSM,put the total cost at \napproximately $400,000,apparently excluding Moussaoui's expenses.Intelligence reports,interrogations of \nKSM,June 3, 2003;Apr.5,2004.Our investigation has uncovered no evidence that the 9/11 conspirators employed \nhawala as a means to move the money that funded the operation.Indeed,the surviving plot participants have either \nnot mentioned hawala or have explicitly denied using it to send money to the United States.Adam Drucker interview \n(Jan. 12,2004);Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,April 5,2004;Intelligence report,interrogation of detainee, \nApr.2,2004;Intelligence report,interrogation of Ramzi Binalshibh,Apr.7,2004.On domestic U.S.and foreign \ngovernment funding,see,e.g.,Adam Drucker interviews (Jan.12,2004;May 19,2004);Dennis Lormel interview \n(Jan.16,2004);FBI response to Commission question for the record,July 13,2004.As discussed in chapter 7,we have \nexamined three transactions involving individuals in San Diego.Based on all of the evidence,we have concluded \nthat none of these transactions involved a net transfer of funds to the hijackers.\n\n132.Shehhi received a salary from the UAE military,which was sponsoring his studies in Germany.Adam Drucker \ninterview (Jan.12,2004).For funds received by facilitators,see Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM, \nApr.5,2004;Intelligence report,interrogation of Binalshibh,Apr.9,2004.Notwithstanding persistent press reports to the \ncontrary,there is no convincing evidence that the Spanish al Qaeda cell,led by Imad Barkat Yarkas and al Qaeda \nEuropean financier Mohammed Galeb Kalaje Zouaydi,provided any funding to support the 9/11 attacks or the \nHamburg participants.Zouaydi may have provided funds to Hamburg associate Mamoun Darkazanli - see, e.g.,FBI \nletterhead memorandum,Yarkas and Spanish Cell investigation,Jan.8,2003 - but there is no evidence that Zouaydi \nprovided money to the plot participants or that any of his funds were used to support the plot.Adam Drucker \ninterview (Jan.12,2004);Ed G.interview (Feb.3,2004).\n\n6 From Threat to Threat \n\n1.President Clinton was a voracious reader of intelligence.He received the President's Daily Brief (PDB),Senior \nExecutive Intelligence Brief (SEIB),and the State Department's intelligence updates daily,as well as other products \nepisodically.Berger,Clarke,and Chief of Staff John Podesta received daily Bin Ladin \"Situation Reports\"from the CIA \ndetailing Bin Ladin's reported location and movements.Berger told us he would tell President Clinton if there was \nanything in these reports that he needed to know.Samuel Berger interview (Jan.14,2004).Information on distribution \nof Bin Ladin Situation Reports provided to the Commission by CIA.\n\n2.President Clinton spoke of terrorism in numerous public statements.In his August 5,1996,remarks at George \nWashington University,he called terrorism \"the enemy of our generation.\"He usually spoke of terrorism in two \nrelated contexts: new technologies and the greater openness engendered by post-Cold War globalization; and \nweapons of mass destruction (WMD),especially - and increasingly over time - the threat from biological and \nchemical weapons.President Clinton repeatedly linked terrorist groups and WMD as transnational threats for the \nnew global era.See,e.g.,President Clinton remarks,\"On Keeping America Secure for the 21st Century,\"Jan.22,1999 \n(at the National Academy of Sciences,Washington,D.C.),in which he spoke directly to these topics.\n\n3.President Clinton spoke of the Y2K computer problem in his January 19,1999,State of the Union address. On Y2K \nconcerns,see John Podesta interview (Jan.15,2004).On concerns about extremist groups exploiting millennial \nopportunities,see,e.g.,CIA briefing materials,CTC for the DCI,\"Millennium Threat,\"Dec.16,1999.\n\n4.Judith Miller,\"Holy Warriors:Dissecting a Terror Plot from Boston to Amman,\" NewYorkTimes ,Jan.15,2001, \np.A1;CIA analytic report,\"Bin Ladin's Terrorist Operations:Meticulous and Adaptable,\"CTC 00-400117,Nov.2, 2000 \n(appendix B:\"Bin Ladin's Role in the Anti-U.S.'Millennial'Plots\").\n\n5.Ibid.On Hoshar and Hijazi,see Jason Burke, Al Qaeda:Casting a Shadow of Terror (I.B.Tauris,2003),p.188. \nKhaldan and Derunta were terrorist training camps in Afghanistan controlled by Abu Zubaydah.While the camps \nwere not al Qaeda facilities,Abu Zubaydah had an agreement with Bin Ladin to conduct reciprocal recruiting efforts \nwhereby promising trainees at the camps could be invited to join al Qaeda.See Intelligence report,interrogation of \nAbu Zubaydah,July 10,2002.\n\n\n\n6.Miller,\"Holy Warriors,\"Jan.15,2001;CIA analytic report,\"Bin Ladin's Terrorist Operations,\"Nov.2,2000 (appendix B).\n\n7.CIA analytic report,\"Bin Ladin's Terrorist Operations,\"Nov.2,2000 (appendix B).\n\n8.FBI electronic communication,\"Ahmed Ressam;Usama bin Ladin;Sbih Benyamin;Lucia Garofalo;Boua-bide \nChamchi,\"Dec.29,1999;Miller,\"Holy Warriors,\"Jan.15,2001.The Encyclopedia is a multivolume instruction manual \ncontaining lessons on weapons handling,tactics,covert operations,bomb making,and other topics.The manual was \noriginally created in the late 1980s by Afghanistan-based extremists,who considered it essential for waging terrorist \noperations and guerrilla warfare in the jihad against the Soviets.For more on the origins of the Encyclopedia ,see \nIntelligence report,interrogation of Abu Zubaydah,June 24,2003.Although Deek's precise role within the extremist \ncommunity is unknown,his name appears variously as a staff member,instructor,and technical guru for the Khaldan \nand Derunta terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.Intelligence has revealed no extant links to the al Qaeda inner \ncircle.For more on Deek,see FBI electronic communication,\"Usama Bin Laden;Pentt-bomb;Taliban,\"May 25,2002.\n\n9.Testimony of Dale Watson before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence,Feb.9,2000,p.4;Miller, \"Holy \nWarriors,\"Jan.15,2001.\n\n10.Testimony of Dale Watson before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence,Feb.9,2000,pp.3-4;FBI electronic \ncommunication,\"Ahmed Ressam;Usama bin Ladin;Sbih Benyamin;Lucia Garofalo;Bouabide Gham-\nchi,\"Dec.29,1999;Miller,\"Holy Warriors,\"Jan.15,2001.On the fate of Hoshar and Hijazi's accomplices,see DOS \ncable,Amman 05158,\"Security Court Convicts UBL Suspects of Plotting,\"Sept.18,2000.\n\n11.NSC note,Clarke to Berger,Dec.4,1999;Richard Clarke interview (Jan.12,2004).In the margin next to Clarke's \nsuggestion to attack al Qaeda facilities in the week before January 1,2000,Berger wrote \"no.\"\n\n12.NSC memo,Berger to President Clinton,Dec.9,1999.\n\n13.NSC email,Clarke to Berger,Dec.14,1999.The State Department,through the U.S.embassy in Riyadh, also asked \nthe Saudis to relay the same threat to the Taliban.The diplomat said the United States was delivering \"a strong and \nunmistakable message to the Taliban that should such attacks occur,they and Bin Ladin will be subject to swift and \nserious response.\"See DOS cable,Riyadh 003900,\"Saudis on USG Warning to Taliban Concerning UBL \nThreats,\"Dec.14,1999.Berger wrote President Clinton that the State Department's warning seemed to barely \nregister with the Taliban.See NSC memo,Berger to President Clinton,terrorist threat at the millennium,Dec.18, \n1999.\n\n14.See NSC memo,talking points for Zinni,Dec.20,1999;Anthony Zinni interview (Jan.19,2004);NSC email,Clarke to \nBerger,Dec.22,1999 (in which Clarke writes that \"the Milam mission has largely failed\");NSC memo,Riedel re Milam \ncall (attached to the Clarke email).\n\n15.George Tenet interview (Jan.22,2004);George Tenet prepared statement,Mar.24,2004,p.22.\n\n16.Randy Moss interview (Feb.6,2004).In sending the draft MON to the CIA,the NSC's senior director for \nintelligence programs,Mary McCarthy,cited only the August 1998 and July 1999 MONs as relevant prece-\n\ndents -

Even if OFAC had received better intelligence from the intelligence \ncommunity,it would have been powerless to stop the bulk of the problem.Al Qaeda money flows depended on an \ninformal network of hawalas and Islamic institutions moving money from Gulf supporters to Afghanistan.These \nfunds would not therefore have touched the U.S.formal financial system.

In any event, it is an open question whether such legislative or regulatory \ninitiatives would have significantly harmed al Qaeda,which generally made little use of the U.S.finan-cial system to \nmove or store its money.\n\n91.Treasury report,\"The 2001 National Money Laundering Strategy,\"Sept.2001.\n\n92.NSC email,Berger's office to executive secretaries,\"Millennium Alert After Action Review,\"Mar.9,2000.\n\n93.PDD-62,\"Protection Against Unconventional Threats to the Homeland and Americans Overseas,\"May \n22,1998,pp.8-9;NSC email,Berger's office to executive secretaries,\"Millennium Alert After Action Review,\" \nMar.9,2000.\n\n94.PDD-62,May 22,1998;PDD-39,\"U.S.Policy on Counterterrorism,\"June 21,1995,p.2.\n\n95.NSC email,Berger's office to executive secretaries,\"Millennium Alert After Action Review,\"Mar.9,2000.\n\n96.PDD-62,May 22,1998,p.9.Congress had authorized the Alien Terrorist Removal Court at the request of the \nJustice Department in 1996,and it was established in 1997.Clarke noted the court had not been \"highly useful.\"NSC \nemail,Berger's office to executive secretaries,\"Millennium Alert After Action Review,\"Mar.9,2000.

It was \nnot uncommon for FBI budget requests to be reduced by the attorney general or by OMB before being submitted to \nCongress;this had occurred during the previous administration.\n\n234.In chapter 3,we discuss how this problem arose.By 2001,it had become worse.During 2000,the FBI had erred \nin preparing some of its applications for FISA surveillance,misstating how much information had been shared with \ncriminal prosecutors and the nature of the walls between the intelligence and law enforcement functions within the \nFBI.In March 2001,Judge Royce Lamberth,chief judge of the FISA Court,chastised the FBI, sending a letter to \nAshcroft announcing he was banning an offending supervisory agent from appearing before the court.Judge \nLamberth also met personally with Ashcroft and his acting deputy,Robert Mueller,to complain about the \nperformance of the FBI and the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review (OIPR).Judge Lamberth letter to \nAshcroft,Mar.9,2001;John Ashcroft interview (Dec.17,2003).In May 2001,Ashcroft altered the FISA application \nprocess to ensure greater accuracy.See DOJ memo,Ashcroft to Freeh,\"The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \n(FISA) Process,\"May 18,2001.\n\nIn July 2001,the General Accounting Office criticized the way the 1995 procedures were being applied and criticized \nOIPR and FBI for not complying with the information-sharing requirements of the 1995 procedures. This was the \nthird report in as many years by a government agency indicating that the procedures were not working as \nplanned.In October 2000,December 2000,and March 2001,proposals for reform to the 1995 procedures were put \nforth by senior DOJ officials.None resulted in reform.One impediment was that the respective DOJ components \ncould not agree on all the proposed reforms.A second impediment was a concern that such reforms would require a \nchallenge to the FISA Court's position on the matter.This was considered risky because the FISA Court of Review \nhad never convened,and one of the judges had previously voiced skepticism regarding the constitutionality of the \nFISA statute.Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson did ask the court to accept the modifications described in \nthe text,which were distributed as part of his August 2001 memorandum reaffirming the 1995 procedures. See DOJ \nmemo,Thompson to the Criminal Division, the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review,and the FBI,\"Intelligence \nSharing,\"Aug.6,2001.\n\n235.This tasking may have occurred before Rice's March 15,2001,meeting with Tenet.See CIA memo,\"Talk-ing \nPoints for DCI Meeting with Rice,\"Mar.15,2001.For Rice's recollections,see Condoleezza Rice meeting \n(Feb.7,2004).Attorney General John Ashcroft told us he told Rice on March 7,2001,that his lawyers had determined \nthat the existing legal authorities for covert action against Bin Ladin were unclear and insufficient,and that he \nsuggested new,explicit kill authorities be developed.John Ashcroft testimony,Apr.13,2004.On the CIA draft \n\n\n\ndocuments,see CIA memo,\"Talking Points for the DCI on the Draft Afghanistan Counterterrorism Finding and the \nDraft UBL MON,\"Mar.27,2001.For the description of the meeting,see CIA memo,Moseman to Tenet,Mar. 28,2001.\n\n236.NSC memo,Sturtevant to Griffin,Levin,Krongard,Watson,and others,July 12,2001.\n\n237.See,e.g.,NSC note,Clarke to Berger,Sept.23,2000;Richard Clarke interview (Feb.3,2004).\n\n238.CIA memo,Black to Clarke,Jan.25,2001.For a Joint Staff view,see,e.g.,Scott Gration interview (Mar. \n3,2004).The mission commander for the Predator flights,Air Force Major Mark A.Cooter,had registered his \nopposition to redeploying the aircraft back in December 2000:\"given the cost/benefit from these continued missions \nit seems senseless.\"DOD letter,Cooter to Alec B.,\"Continued Flight Operations,\"Nov.14,2000 (attached to CIA \nmemo,Black to DCI and others,Predator Operation,Nov.17,2000).\n\n239.See NSC memo,Summary of Conclusions of Deputies Committee meeting,Apr.30,2001.This document noted a \nconsensus in favor of reconnaissance missions commencing in July.But DDCI McLaughlin told us that he and Black \nbelieved that no such decision had been made at the meeting.Hadley told us he believed that a decision had been \nmade at the meeting to fly such missions.See John McLaughlin interview (Jan.2,2004).See also CIA briefing \nmaterials,\"Summary of April 30,2001 Deputies Committee meeting,\"May 3,2001;Stephen Hadley meeting \n(Jan.31,2004).For Rice's perspective,see Condoleezza Rice meeting (Feb.7,2004).\n\n240.Allen described the \"quibbling\"over financing the Predator program as \"ridiculous.\"Charles Allen interview \n(Jan.27,2004).For a CIA senior management perspective,see,e.g.,John McLaughlin interview (Jan.21,2004).

see,e.g.,CIA analytic report,\n\n\"Alternate View:Two 11 September Hijackers Possibly Involved in Previous US Plot,\"CTC 2002-30064,July 5, 2002 \n- conflicts with the organization's preference for having its 9/11 operatives concentrate on that mission exclusively.\n\n3.Intelligence reports,interrogations of KSM,May 19,2003;Aug.14,2003.\n\n4.Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,Aug.18,2003.According to Hambali,in late 1999 or early 2000 KSM sent \nan al Qaeda operative named Issa al Britani to visit Hambali in Malaysia.At the end of the visit,Issa provided \nHambali with two addresses - one in the United States (\"possibly in California\") and one in South Africa - and told \nHambali he could contact \"people in those locations\" if he \"needed help.\" Hambali claims he never contacted \nanyone at either address or passed either address to anyone else,and claims not to remember the addresses. \nIntelligence report,interrogation of Hambali,Sept.12,2003.In an assessment of KSM's reporting,the CIA concluded \nthat protecting operatives in the United States appeared to be a \"major part\"of KSM's resistance efforts.For \nexample,in response to questions about U.S.zip codes found in his notebooks,KSM provided the less than \nsatisfactory explanation that he was planning to use the zip codes to open new email accounts.CIA \nreport,Intelligence Community Terrorist Threat Assessment,\"Khalid Shaykh Muhammed's Threat Reporting - \nPrecious Truths,Sur-rounded by a Bodyguard of Lies,\"Apr.3,2003,pp.4-5.\n\n5.Notably,as discussed in chapter 5,precisely such arrangements - in the form of lodging and travel assistance \nprovided by Hambali's minions - were in place when the first contingent of operatives (including Hazmi and Mih-\ndhar) journeyed to Kuala Lumpur in late 1999 and early 2000.\n\n6.Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,May 19,2003.\n\n7.Intelligence reports,interrogations of KSM,May 19,2003;Aug.14,2003.KSM also has stated that in addition to \nproviding Hazmi and Mihdhar with a San Diego telephone book,he gave them another directory \"possibly covering \nLong Beach,California.\"Intelligence report,interrogation of KSM,June 15,2004.\n\n8.Although Hazmi and Mihdhar told immigration authorities on January 15,2000,that they would be staying at the \nSheraton Hotel in Los Angeles,their names do not appear in the hotel's registration records for the second half of \nJanuary.FBI searches of the records of other hotels near the airport and smaller establishments in Culver City failed \nto locate the hijackers,as did our own investigation.See FBI report,\"Hijackers Timeline,\"Nov.14,2003 \n(Apr.3,1999,entry,citing 265A-NY-280350-CG,serial 4062;265A-NY-280350-302,serial 7134);Commission \ninvestigation in Culver City;Vicki G.interview (Sept.30,2003).\n\n\n\n9.For the FBI source's claims,see FBI letterhead memorandum,Penttbom investigation,Oct.8,2002.For Abdullah's \nrecollections,see FBI report of investigation,interview of Mohdar Abdullah,Jan.15,2002.Other reporting indicates \nthat Hazmi and Mihdhar spent time at the King Fahd mosque.A scholar lecturing at the mosque was reportedly \napproached by either Hazmi or Mihdhar about performing a wedding ceremony.Khalil A.Khalil interview \n(Feb.24,2004).On \"Khallam,\"see FBI electronic communication,\"Fahad Althumairy,\"Sept.4,2002;FBI electronic \ncommunication,\"Ziyat Kharfan,\"Jan.8,2002 (giving description of visitor with whom Hazmi and Mih-dhar met at \nmosque).The Khallam story has never been corroborated.The FBI considered the possibility that Khal-lam might be \nKhallad,the al Qaeda member whose role in the 9/11 plot and the Cole attack we discussed in chapter 5.This \nspeculation was based on reporting that Khallad was in the United States in June 2000 and was seen in the \ncompany of Fahad al Thumairy,an imam at the mosque.FBI electronic communication,investigation of Cole bomb-\ning,interview of witness,Mar.19,2003;CIA cable,source reporting,Mar.18,2003.Neither we nor the FBI have found \nany travel documentation establishing Khallad's presence in the United States at any time.We doubt that the person \nallegedly seen with Thumairy actually was Khallad.\n\n10.Patrick J.McDonnell,\"Saudi Envoy in L.A.Is Deported,\" Los Angeles Times ,May 10,2003,p.B1;Michael Isikoff \nand Daniel Klaidman,with Jamie Reno,\"Failure to Communicate,\" Newsweek ,Aug.4,2003,p.34.As of January \n2000,Thumairy was employed by the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Islamic Affairs,Religious Endowments and Religious \nGuidance,to act as the consulate's liaison to the mosque.FBI electronic communication,\"Fahad Al Thu-\nmairy,\"Sept.4,2002.Before 9/11,Saudi imams employed by the ministry often were dispatched to help serve Muslim \ncommunities around the world,sometimes -

However,two witnesses we interviewed who knew Thu-\nmairy and used to hear him preach at the King Fahd mosque deny that he promoted extremism.Sami A.Mekhe-mar \ninterview (Apr.21,2004);Interview (Apr.23,2004).Despite the disparate views as to whether Thumairy\n\nqualified as an extremist while he was in Los Angeles,it does appear that both the Saudi Arabian government and \nthe leadership of the mosque attempted to discipline him in the summer of 2002 and early 2003 for espousing \nextremist views.Thumairy denies incurring any such disciplinary measures.Fahad al Thumairy interviews (Feb. 23-\n25,2004);FBI letterhead memorandum,investigation of Mohammed bin Suleiman al Muhanna,July 9,2003. On \nBayoumi,see Khalil A.Khalil interview (Feb.24,2004).Bayoumi and Thumairy had numerous telephonic contacts \nbetween December 1998 and December 2000.Specifically,Bayoumi called Thumairy's home telephone 10 times \nduring this period,and Thumairy called Bayoumi's cellular and home phones 11 times between December 3and \nDecember 20,2000.FBI electronic communication,\"Fahad Al-Thumairy,\"Nov.20,2002.Bayoumi recalls consulting \nwith Thumairy,solely on religious matters,both by telephone and in person at the mosque.Omar al Bayoumi \ninterview (Oct.16-17,2003).As to Thumairy's contact with Mohdar Abdullah,see FBI electronic com-\nmunication,\"Fahad Althumairy,\"Oct.25,2002;FBI report of investigation,interview of Mohdar Abdullah,July 23, \n2002.According to one individual,Abdullah visited the mosque frequently and was \"very close\"to radical followers of \nThumairy.FBI electronic communication,\"Fahad Althumairy,\"Oct.25,2002.\n\n14.We have checked,for example,the records for apartments where Thumairy is known to have placed Saudi \nvisitors during 2001.The most intriguing lead concerns an Arabic-speaking taxicab driver,Qualid Benomrane,who \nwas arrested on immigration charges in early 2002.When asked to look at a series of photographs that included the \n19 hijackers involved in the 9/11 attacks,Benomrane responded ambiguously,seeming first to pick out the \nphotographs of Hazmi and Mihdhar but then denying that he recognized them.Later in the interview,Benom-rane \ntold the FBI about driving \"two Saudis\"around Los Angeles and to San Diego's Sea World after being introduced to \n\n\n\nthem by Thumairy at the King Fahd mosque before 9/11.According to Benomrane,someone at the consulate had \nasked Thumairy to assist the two Saudis,who had recently arrived in Los Angeles and had moved to an apartment \nnear the mosque.FBI electronic communication,\"Fahad Althumairy,\"Sept.4,2002;Ashour E.inter-view (May \n20,2004);FBI reports of investigation,interviews of Qualid Moncef Benomrane,Mar.7,2002;Mar.13, 2002;May \n23,2002.Working with agencies of the U.S.government,we have attempted to locate and interview Benomrane \noverseas,since he was deported in 2002.After checking many possible avenues of corroboration for this story,our \ninvestigation has not substantiated the hypothesis that Benomrane's \"two Saudis\"were Hazmi and Mihdhar.In \nfact,we have established that Benomrane did not obtain a taxi license,or even a driver's license,until months after \nhe could be supposed to have chauffeured Hazmi and Mihdhar.Moreover,before his deportation, Benomrane \ndescribed the two Saudis as sons of a sick father who was seeking medical treatment in Los Angeles. Ibid.We have \nfound evidence corroborating this account.\n\n15.FBI document made available to the Commission;Caysan Bin Don interview (Apr.20,2004);Omar al Bayoumi \ninterview (Oct.16-17,2003);Interview (Apr.23,2004).In Bin Don's presence,Bayoumi met with a still-unidentified \nconsular employee whom Bayoumi already knew and whom Bin Don says he saw in Anaheim as recently as \nNovember 2003.The employee provided Bayoumi with Qur'ans and other religious materials during the February \n1,2000,meeting.Omar al Bayoumi interview (Oct.16-17,2003).At the time of the February 1, 2000,restaurant \nencounter,Bin Don,a U.S.citizen,went by the name Isamu Dyson.\n\n16.Caysan Bin Don interview (Apr.20,2004);FBI report of investigation,interview of Isamu Dyson,Oct.8, 2001.\n\n17.See Caysan Bin Don interview (Apr.20,2004);FBI report of investigation,interview of Isamu Dyson,Oct. \n8,2001.Bin Don himself has been inconsistent about visiting the mosque.In his initial interviews,he recalled praying \nwith Bayoumi at the consulate before lunch and visiting the mosque only once,after the meal;when we interviewed \nhim recently,however,he stated that both prayer sessions took place at the mosque.For Bayoumi's visits to Los \nAngeles,see FBI report of investigation,recovery of hotel records,Jan.15,2002.Although Bayoumi might deny visiting \nthe mosque on February 1 to conceal some contact he may have made there that day,we have seen no evidence of \nsuch contact.\n\n18.Saudi Civil Aviation Authority employment records for Bayoumi,Mar.2000-Jan.2002 (provided by the FBI);FBI \nreport of investigation,\"Connections of San Diego PENTTBOMB Subjects to the Government of Saudi \nArabia,\"undated;FBI letterhead memorandum,investigation of Bayoumi,Apr.15,2002.While in San Diego,Bay-oumi \nwas officially employed by Ercan,a subsidiary of a contractor for the Saudi Civil Aviation Administration, although a \nfellow employee described Bayoumi as a \"ghost employee,\"noting that he was one of many Saudis on the payroll \nwho was not required to work.In April 2000,Bayoumi received a promotion and his status was also adjusted from \n\"single\"to \"married\"(despite the fact that he was already married).As a result,his salary was raised and his \"other \nallowances\"stipend increased significantly,from approximately $465 to $3,925 a month,remaining at that level until \nDecember 2000.In January 2001,the stipend was reduced to $3,427.It stayed constant until August 2001,when \nBayoumi left the United States.Saudi Civil Aviation Authority employment records for Bayoumi,Mar. 2000-Jan.2002 \n(provided by the FBI);Richard L.Lambert prepared statement,June 26,2003,pp.7-9;FBI reports of \ninvestigation,interviews of Samuel George Coombs,Apr.8,2002;July 24,2002;Aug.26,2002.\n\n19.On Bayoumi's activities,see FBI electronic communication,interview of Bayoumi,Sept.17,2003.Although Bayoumi \nadmits knowing Thumairy,no telephone records document any contact between the two just before Bay-oumi's \nlunch with Hazmi and Mihdhar in Los Angeles.Nor do individuals who regard Thumairy as an extremist\n\nplace Bayoumi in Thumairy's circle of associates.KSM has denied knowing Bayoumi.Intelligence report,interro-\ngation of KSM,Aug.18,2003.\n\nBayoumi was once the subject of an FBI counterterrorism investigation,prompted by allegations about him that \nappear to have been groundless.On the closing of the investigation,see FBI electronic communication,\"Omar \nAhmed Al Bayoumi,\"June 7,1999.Another possible source of suspicion is his passport,which contains a cachet that \nintelligence investigators associate with possible adherence to al Qaeda.It is a marking that can be obtained by \nespecially devout Muslims.Although we believe the marking suggests the need for further inquiry,it is not the kind of \nfraudulent manipulation that would conclusively link the document with a terrorist organization.INS records,copy of \nBayoumi passport;CIA analytic report,Al-Qa'ida Travel Issues,CTC 2004-40002H,Nov.14,2003, pp.ii,18.\n\n\n\n20.On Abdullah's assistance to the hijackers,see FBI electronic communication,Abdullah investigation,May \n19,2004.In a post-9/11 interview with law enforcement,Abdullah claimed that Bayoumi specifically asked him \"to be \nthe individual to acclimate the hijackers to the United States,particularly San Diego,California.\"FBI report of \ninvestigation,interview of Mohdar Abdullah,July 23,2002.Bayoumi,however,denies even introducing Hazmi and \nMihdhar to Abdullah,much less asking him to assist them.Omar al Bayoumi interview (Oct.16-17,2003).\n\n21.FBI report of investigation,interview of Mohdar Abdullah,July 23,2002;FBI electronic communication, \"Osama \nBassnan,\"Oct.17,2001;FBI report of investigation,interview of Mohdar Abdullah,Sept.22,2001;FBI electronic \ncommunication,\"Shareef Abdulmuttaleb el Arbi,\" Feb. 4, 2003.

According to Khallad,Bin Ladin wanted operatives from strong tribal areas of Saudi Arabia and chose \ntwo Saudi brothers from the al Shehri tribe,of which their father was a leader.Intelligence report,interrogation of \nKhallad, Feb.18,2004.\n\n92.CIA analytic report,\"The Plot and the Plotters,\"June 1,2003,pp.24,26.According to Saudi authorities, none of the \nhijackers had any record of extremist activity,but Satam al Suqami and Salem al Hazmi both had minor criminal \noffense records.Saudi Arabian Mabahith briefing (Oct.17,2003).\n\n93.CIA analytic report,\"Afghanistan Camps Central to 11 September Plot,\"June 20,2003,pp.1-2.\n\n94.

so that the operatives could \nuse that number as a travel agency point of contact.Ibid.\n\n112.In May 2001,however,Ali asked KSM to participate in a suicide mission and offered to travel to the United \nStates and assist the operatives there.As discussed in a set of Atta-Binalshibh exchanges in August 2001,Ali \n(referred to by the nickname \"Losh\") appears to have contacted Atta and expressed the desire to join the \noperation.Ali actually applied for a U.S.visa on August 27,2001,listing his intended arrival date as September 4 for a \none-week stay.

observed taking \nphotographs of two adjacent buildings that contained FBI offices.The person taking the photographs told the FBI \nthat he was taking them for a co-worker in Indiana who had never been to New York and wanted to see what it \nlooked like.The picture taker was in New York to obtain further information regarding his pending citizenship \napplication.He had an appointment at 26 Federal Plaza,where the relevant INS offices were located.This same \nbuilding houses portions of the FBI's New York Field Office.Before going into the building the individual pulled out \nthe camera and took four photographs.When the FBI attempted to contact the co-worker (and roommate) who had \nrequested some photographs,it was determined that he had fled without receiving his last paycheck after learning \nthat the FBI had asked his employer some questions about him.Further investigation determined that he was an \nillegal alien using forged identity documents.Despite two years of investigation,the FBI was unable to find the co-\nworker or determine his true identity.The FBI closed the investigation on June 9,2003,when it concluded that it was \nunable to connect the men's activities to terrorism.Matthew interview (June 18,2004);FBI case file,no.266A-NY-\n279198.\n\nThe 70 full-field investigations number was a generous calculation that included fund-raising

Moreover,once information was properly shared,the \ncriminal agent could use it for further investigation.\n\n81.FBI email,Jane to Steve,NSLU Response,Aug.29,2001.\"Jane\"says she only asked whether there was sufficient \nprobable cause to open the matter as a criminal case and whether the criminal agent could attend any interview if \nMihdhar was found.She said the answer she received to both questions was no.She did not ask whether the \nunderlying information could have been shared.Jane interview (July 13,2004).The NSLU attorney denies advising \nthat the agent could not participate in an interview and notes that she would not have given such inaccurate \nadvice.The attorney told investigators that the NSA caveats would not have precluded criminal agents from joining \nin any search for Mihdhar or from participating in any interview.Moreover,she said that she could have gone to the \n\n\n\nNSA and obtained a waiver of any such caveat because there was no FISA information involved in this case.There \nare no records of the conversation between \"Jane\"and the attorney.\"Jane\"did not copy the attorney on her email to \nthe agent,so the attorney did not have an opportunity to confirm or reject the advice \"Jane\"was giving to the \nagent.DOJ Inspector General interview of Sherry S.,Nov.7,2002. \"Jane\"asked the New York agent assigned to the \nMihdhar search to sign a FISA acknowledgment form indicating the agent understood how he had to treat FISA \ninformation.Because no FISA information was involved, she should not have required him to sign such a form.To \nthe extent she believed,incorrectly,that the Attorney General's 1995 procedures applied to this situation,there was in \nfact an exception in place for New York.DOJ Inspector General interview of Sherry S.,Nov.7,2002.More \nfundamentally,\"Jane\"apparently understood the welter of restrictions to mean,in workday shorthand,that any \ninformation gathered by intelligence agencies should\n\nnot be shared with criminal agents.This was incorrect.DOJ Inspector General interviews of Jane,July 16,2003; \nNov.4,2002.\n\n82.FBI emails between Steve B.and Jane,re:NSLU Response,Aug.29,2001.While the agent expressed his \nfrustration with the situation to \"Jane,\"he made no effort to press the matter further by discussing his concerns with \neither his supervisor or the chief division counsel in New York.\n\n83.Attorney General Ashcroft testified to us that this and similar information-sharing issues arose from Attorney \nGeneral Reno's 1995 guidelines,discussed in chapter 3,and specifically from a March 1995 memorandum of then \nDeputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick.John Ashcroft testimony,Apr.13,2004;DOJ memo,Gorelick to \nWhite,\"Instructions on Separation of Certain Foreign Counterintelligence and Criminal Investigations,\"Mar.4, 1995.\n\nWe believe the Attorney General's testimony does not fairly or accurately reflect the significance of the 1995 \ndocuments and their relevance to the 2001 discussions.Whatever the merits of the March 1995 Gorelick \nmemorandum and the subsequent July 1995 Attorney General procedures on information sharing,they did not apply \nto the information the analyst decided she could not share with the criminal agent.As discussed earlier,the reason \n\"Jane\"decided she could not share information was because the initial information on Mihdhar had been analyzed \nby the NSA.This reason was unrelated to either of the 1995 documents.The Gorelick memorandum applied to two \nparticular criminal cases,neither of which was involved in the summer 2001 information-sharing discussions. As the \nFBI agent observed in his email,Part A of the 1995 procedures applied only to information obtained pursuant to a \nFISA warrant.None of the Mihdhar material was FISA information.There was an exemption for the Southern District \nof New York from Part B of the 1995 procedures,so they did not apply.Also,the 1995 procedures did not govern \nwhether information could be shared between intelligence and criminal agents within the FBI,a separation that the \nBureau did not begin making formally until long after the procedures were in place.The 1995 procedures governed \nonly the sharing of information with criminal prosecutors.Even in that situation,the restriction obliged running the \ninformation through the OIPR screen.\n\nWhat had happened,as we discussed in chapter 3,was a growing battle within the Justice Department during the \n1990s,and between parts of Justice and the FISA Court,over the scope of OIPR's screening function and the \npropriety of using FISA-derived information in criminal matters.The FISA Court's concern with FBI sloppiness in its \nFISA applications also began to take a toll:the court began designating itself as the gatekeeper for the sharing of \nintelligence information;the FBI was required to separately designate criminal and intelligence agents;and the court \nbanned one supervisory FBI agent from appearing before it.By late 2000,these factors had culminated in a set of \ncomplex rules and a widening set of beliefs - a bureaucratic culture - that discouraged FBI agents from even \nseeking to share intelligence information.Neither Attorney General acted to resolve the conflicting views within the \nJustice Department.Nor did they challenge the strict interpretation of the FISA statute set forth by the FISA Court \nand OIPR.Indeed,this strict interpretation remained in effect until the USA PATRIOT Act was passed after 9/11.\n\nSimply put,there was no legal reason why the information the analyst possessed could not have been shared with \nthe criminal agent.On August 27,\"Jane\"requested the NSA's permission to share the information with the criminal \nagents,but she intended for the information only to help the criminal agents in their ongoing Cole inves-tigation.She \nstill did not believe they could be involved in the intelligence investigation even if the NSA permitted the information \nto be shared.DOJ IG 9/11 Report,July 2,2004,p.339.The next day the NSA notified its representative at FBI \nheadquarters that it had approved the passage of the information to the criminal agents.NSC email,Carlene C.to \n\n\n\nRichard K.,\"Response to FBI Sanitization Request,\"Aug.28,2001.Thus,\"Jane\"had permission to share the \ninformation with the criminal agent prior to their August 29 emails.\n\n84.DOJ Inspector General interview of Robert F.,Dec.18,2002;FBI electronic communication,Los Angeles \nlead,Sept.10,2001.\n\n85.Hazmi and Mihdhar used their true names to obtain California driver's licenses and open New Jersey bank \naccounts.Hazmi also had a car registered and had been listed in the San Diego telephone book.Searches of readily \navailable databases could have unearthed the driver's licenses,the car registration,and the telephone listing.A \nsearch on the car registration would have unearthed a license check by the South Hackensack Police Department \nthat would have led to information placing Hazmi in the area and placing Mihdhar at a local hotel for a week in early \nJuly 2001.The hijackers actively used the New Jersey bank accounts,through ATM,debit card,and cash trans-\nactions,until September 10.Among other things,they used their debit cards to pay for hotel rooms;and Hazmi used \nhis card on August 27 to purchase tickets on Flight 77 for himself and his brother (and fellow hijacker),Salem al \nHazmi.These transactions could have helped locate them if the FBI had obtained the bank records in time.There \nwould have been no easy means,however,to determine the existence of these accounts,and obtaining bank \ncooperation pre-9/11 might have been problematic.The most likely means of successfully finding the men in the \nshort time available was one not often used pre-9/11 for suspected terrorists:an FBI BOLO (be on the lookout) \ncombined with a media campaign.This alone might have delayed or disrupted the plot,even if the men had not been \nphysically located before September 11.But this would have been considered only if the FBI believed that they were \nabout to carry out an imminent attack.No one at the FBI - or any other agency - believed that at the time.\n\nSee FBI report,financial spreadsheet re:9/11 hijackers,undated;South Hackensack,N.J.,Police Department report, \nDetective Bureau Report,Oct.17,2001 (case

\nAirport;and he was also particularly interested in the operation of the aircraft doors.FBI electronic \ncommunication,Request OIPR permission to contact U.S.Attorney's Office regarding Zacarias

of Justice attorneys before submission to the \ncourt.Therefore,approval from the Minneapolis U.S.Attorney's Office was required before a criminal search warrant \ncould be obtained.DOJ Inspector General interview of Coleen Rowley,July 16,2002.Another agent,how-ever,said \nthat he spoke to an Assistant U.S.Attorney in the Minneapolis office and received advice that the facts were almost \nsufficient to obtain a criminal warrant.DOJ Inspector General interview of Greg J.,July 9,2002.The Assistant United \nStates Attorney said that if the FBI had asked for a criminal warrant that first night,he would have sought it.He \n\n\n\nbelieved that there was sufficient probable cause for a criminal warrant at that time.DOJ Inspector General interview \nofWilliam K.,May 29,2003.Mary Jo White,the former U.S.Attorney for the Southern District of New York,told us that \nbased on her review of the evidence known pre-9/11,she would have approved a criminal search warrant.Mary Jo \nWhite interview (May 17,2004).Because the agents never presented the information to the Minneapolis \nU.S.Attorney's Office before 9/11,we cannot know for sure what its judgment would have been or whether a judge \nwould have signed the warrant.In any event,the Minneapolis agents were concerned that if they tried to first obtain a \ncriminal warrant but the U.S.Attorney's Office or the judge refused,the FISA Court might reject an application for a \nFISA warrant on the grounds that the agents were attempting to make an end run around the criminal \nprocess.Therefore,it was judged too risky to seek a criminal warrant unless it was certain that it would be \napproved.DOJ Inspector General interview of Greg J.,July 9,2002.In addition,FBI headquarters specifically \ninstructed Minneapolis that it could not open a criminal investigation.DOJ IG 9/11 Report, July \n2,2004,p.138.Finally,the Minneapolis Field Office mistakenly believed that the 1995 Attorney General procedures \nrequired OIPR's approval before it could contact the U.S.Attorney's Office about obtaining a criminal warrant.\n\n95.The FISA definition of \"foreign power\"includes \"a group engaged in international terrorism or

The \nconditions of stairwell C are unknown.For conditions in stairwells,see,e.g.,Civilian Interview 1 (Mar.2,2004); Civilian \nInterview 13 (Mar.25,2004).\n\n86.For some civilians remaining,see Civilian interview 10 (Mar.24,2004).For some civilians ascending,see, \ne.g.,Civilian interview 1 (Mar.2,2004);Civilian interview 11 (Mar.25,2004).\n\n87.For conditions in the 90s and 100s,see Commission analysis of 911/PAPD calls.For the 105th floor and the \ncondition of the less affected area,see Civilian interview 16 (Apr.27,2004).For the other areas of the 105th, 88th,and \n89th floors,see Commission analysis of 911/PAPD calls.\n\n88.For the callers,see Commission analysis of 911/PAPD calls.There are many variables to consider in determining \nwhether,and to what extent,stairwell A was actually a viable exit.Knowing that the stairway was initially passable \nfrom at least the 91st floor down,we can conclude that it was likely open from top to bottom,on floors farther \nremoved from the impact.However,in areas near the impact zone some doors leading to the stairwell may have \n\n\n\njammed.We know that access to stairway A was possible from at least the 81st and 84th floors,and from several \nother floors between the 84th and 91st floor.It is likely that access was possible from floors higher up as well. It is \nnot known,however,whether 911 callers had a clear path to the stairwell entrance from their locations.Dam-age \ncaused by the impact of the plane,and the resulting smoke and heat,may have prevented some from being able to \nreach the entrance to the staircase;but the stated locations of at least some callers indicate that they were near \nstairwell A on their floor.Based on conditions described by civilians who descended stairwell A from at or above the \nimpact zone,we conclude that stairwell A may have become effectively impassable as the morning progressed.\n\n89.Commission analysis of 911/PAPD calls.\n\n90.Brian Clark testimony,May 18,2004 (videotaped);Civilian interview 1 (Mar.2,2004);Commission analysis of \n911/PAPD calls.\n\n91.Commission analysis of 911/PAPD calls.\n\n92.Civilian interview 1 (Mar.2,2004);Civilian interview 8 (Mar.23,2004);Civilian interview 13 (Mar.25, 2004);Civilian \ninterview 4 (Mar.16,2004);Commission analysis of 911/PAPD calls.\n\n93.OEM interview 1 (Feb.12,2004);PANYNJ interview 7 (June 2,2004);Civilian interview 13 (Mar.25, 2004);Civilian \ninterview 1 (Mar.2,2004);Civilian interview 8 (Mar.23,2004).\n\n94.Civilian interview 8 (Mar.23,2004);Civilian interview 1 (Mar.2,2004);Civilian interview 4 (Mar.16, 2004);Civilian \ninterview 13 (Mar.25,2004);NYPD interview 15,ESU (Mar.11,2004).\n\n95.Civilian interview 6 (Mar.22,2004);Civilian interview 7 (Mar.22,2004) (quotation);Civilian interview 9 \n(Mar.3,2004);Civilian interview 14 (Apr.7,2004).\n\n96.Commission analysis of 911/PAPD calls.It is not clear whether callers from below the impact were trapped\n\nin offices or otherwise obstructed from proceeding,or were simply calling to seek advice.In any case,the 911 \noperators and FDNY dispatchers who advised them did not appear to be basing their advice on these or other \nfactual considerations.\n\n97.Port Authority transcripts of recorded Port Authority calls and radio channels,Sept.11,2001.\n\n98.For the evacuation route for civilians,see Civilian interview 6 (Mar.22,2004);Civilian interview 7 (Mar. \n22,2004);Civilian interview 14 (Apr.7,2004);Civilian interview 9 (Mar.23,2004);PANYNJ interview 7 (Jun.2, 2004).\n\n99.FDNY interview 40,Battalion 4 (Feb.12,2004);FDNY interview 16,Battalion 1 (Jan.20,2004);FDNY interview \n24,Battalion 6 (Jan.23,2004);FDNY interview 29,Battalion 1 (Jan.29,2004);NYPD interview 6,ESU \n(Feb.19,2004);NYPD interview 10,ESU (Mar.1,2004);FDNY interview,transcript 10,Battalion 2,Dec.6,2001.\n\n100.Civilian interview 7 (Mar.22,2004);Civilian interview 6 (Mar.22,2004);PAPD interview 4,Port Authority Bus \nTerminal Command (Nov.20,2003);NYPD interview 10,ESU (Mar.1,2004).For people killed by debris, see,e.g.,WTC \ninterview 9 (June 8,2004).\n\n101.FDNY records,computer-aided dispatch report,alarm box 8087,Sept.11,2001,09:10:02;FDNY interview 45,HQ \n(Mar.8,2004).\n\n102.For the 23 engines and 13 ladders dispatched,see FDNY records,computer-aided dispatch report,Sept. \n11,2001,09:08:28-09:15:00.For units that self-dispatched,see FDNY interview 60,HQ (May 11,2004);FDNY \nreport,McKinsey & Company,\"FDNY Report,\"Aug.19,2002,p.35.For units riding heavy,see ibid.,p.131;FDNY \ninterview 25,Battalion 1 (Jan.23,2004);FDNY interview 21,Battalion 1 (Jan.22,2004);FDNY interview 7,Bat-talion 4 \n(Jan.9,2004);FDNY interview 9,Battalion 8 (Jan.9,2004);FDNY interview 50,Battalion 11 (Mar.17, 2004);FDNY \ninterview 31,Battalion 1 (Jan.30,2004);FDNY interview 34,Battalion 1 (Feb.9,2004).For extra personnel being a \nparticular issue for SOC companies,see FDNY report,9/11 fatalities list.For firefighters responding when told not \nto,see FDNY interview 46,Battalion 10 (Mar.9,2004).For firefighters responding from firehouses separately from the \non-duty unit,see FDNY interview 46,Battalion 10 (Mar.9,2004);FDNY interview, transcript 26,Battalion \n2,Jan.16,2002;FDNY interview,transcript 14,Battalion 32,Dec.12,2001;FDNY inter-view,transcript 19,Battalion \n2,Jan.8,2002.For firefighters responding from home,see FDNY interview 14,Bat-talion 1 (Jan.13,2004);FDNY \ninterview 17,Battalion 6 (Jan.22,2004);FDNY interview 19,Battalion 4 (Jan.22, 2004);FDNY interview,transcript \n\n\n\n6,Battalion 6 (Oct.12,2001);FDNY interview 11,Battalion 1 (Jan.13,2004); FDNY interview,transcript 2,Battalion \n2,Oct.9,2001.For numerous additional FDNY personnel reporting,see FDNY interview 3,Chief (Jan.7,2004);FDNY \ninterview 8,Fire Marshall (Jan.9,2004).\n\n103.FDNY interview 15,Chief (Jan.14,2004);Jules Naudet and Gedeon Naudet,video footage,Sept.11, 2001.\n\n104.For FDNY personnel requesting the repeater's activation,see FDNY interview 4,Chief (Jan.8,2004).

For the Mayor and Police Commissioner's consultation with the FDNY Chief of Department, see Rudolph \nGiuliani interview (Apr.20,2004).\n\n206.The FDNY's lack of command and control had some unintended positive consequences.One battalion chief \nwas dispatched to the South Tower but instead responded to the North Tower,where he was instrumental in saving \nmany lives after the South Tower collapsed.Some FDNY units dispatched to the South Tower - where they would \nhave perished - instead were mistakenly sent to the North Tower and in many cases survived.\n\n207. For the FDNY addressing these issues, see generally FDNY report, McKinsey & Company,\"FDNY \nReport,\"Aug.19,2002;Peter Hayden interview (Jan.14,2004).For the PAPD not changing standard operating \nprocedures or training,see PAPD regulations,\"Manual of Police Division Instructions,\"undated (in existence before \nand after 9/11);Barry Pickard interview (Nov.24,2003).\n\n208.One instance in which the FDNY/NYPD rivalry may have had an impact on the total fatalities was the alleged \nfailure of ESU officers descending past at least two firefighters after 9:59 in the North Tower to share their \nevacuation instructions.It should be noted,however,that at least one firefighter has conceded that he,too,descended \npast other stationary firefighters without telling them to evacuate.In addition,according to one of the ESU offi-\n\ncers and one of the firefighters in the North Tower,at least some FDNY personnel were unwilling to take evacuation \norders from police that morning.\n\n209.Based on more than 100 interviews we conducted and our review of 500 internal FDNY interview tran-\nscripts,we conclude that out of these 32 companies,all on-duty members of 19 companies are likely to have known \nto evacuate (Engine Companies 1,4,7,9,15,16,21,24,28,33,39,and 65;Ladder Companies 1,5,6,8,9,110;and Rescue \n1).We also conclude that at least some members of each of five companies knew to evacuate (two firefighters from \nLadder Company 10;the officer of Ladder Company 20;all but the officer of Engine Company 10;at least two \nfirefighters from Squad 18;and at least three firefighters from Engine 6).We do not know whether members of the \neight other companies knew to evacuate (Engine Companies 55,207,and 226;Rescue 2,3,and 4;Haz-mat 1;and \nSquad 1) because they all died,and we have come across no on-point eyewitness accounts related to their \noperations.It is very possible that at least some of these firefighters did hear the evacuation order but nevertheless \nfailed to evacuate in the only 29-minute period between the collapse of the two towers.In addition,it is possible that \nseveral of the eight companies for which we have no record of their receiving evacuation instructions were in the \nSouth Tower and thus died in its earlier collapse.\n\n210.Eric Lipton,\"A New Weapon for Firefighters,\" NewYorkTimes ,May 30,2004,p.27.\n\n10 Wartime \n\n1.All times are Eastern Daylight Time.Sometime around 10:30,after the decision had already been made not to \nreturn to Washington,a reported threat to \"Angel\" - the code word for Air Force One - was widely disseminated in \nthe Presidential Emergency Operations Center (PEOC) and aboard Air Force One.Notes from the morning indicate \nthat Vice President Cheney informed President Bush in a phone conversation shortly after 10:30 that an \nanonymous threat had been phoned into the White House that was viewed as credible.At about the same time, \nnews of the threat was conveyed on the air threat conference call.\n\nThe Secret Service's Intelligence Division tracked down the origin of this threat and,during the day,deter-mined that \nit had originated in a misunderstanding by a watch officer in the White House Situation Room.The director of the \nWhite House Situation Room that day disputes this account.But the Intelligence Division had the primary job of \nrunning down the story,and we found their witnesses on this point to be credible.During the afternoon of September \n11 the leadership of the Secret Service was satisfied that the reported threat to \"Angel\"was unfounded.\n\nAt the White House press briefing on September 12,spokesperson Ari Fleischer described the threat to Air Force \nOne as \"real and credible.\"White House transcript,Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,Sept.12,2001 (online at  \nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/09/print/20010912-8.html  ).Fleischer told us he cited the \ninformation in good faith.Indeed,Fleischer had conferred with Vice President Cheney and Karen Hughes before the \nbriefing, and they had decided to let people know about the threat,all of them believing it was true.According to \n\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/09/print/20010912-8.html\n\n\nFleischer, only weeks later did he learn - from press reports - that the threat was unfounded.We have not found any \nevidence that contradicts his account.Ari Fleischer interview (Apr.22,2004);Chuck Green interview (Mar.10,2004);

The most controversial press release,on September 18,quoted EPA Administrator Christine \nWhitman as saying that the air was \"safe\"to breathe.This statement was issued the day after the financial markets \nreopened.The EPA Office of Inspector General investigated the issuance of these press releases and concluded \nthat the agency did not have enough data about the range of possible pollutants other than asbestos to make a \njudgment,lacked public health benchmarks for appropriate levels of asbestos and other pollutants,and had \nimprecise methods for sampling asbestos in the air;it also noted that more than 25 percent of the bulk dust samples \n\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010911-16.html\n\n\ncollected before September 18 showed the presence of asbestos above the agency's 1 percent benchmark.EPA \nInspector General report,\"EPA's Response to the World Trade Center Collapse:Challenges,Successes,and Areas \nfor Improve-ment,\"Aug.21,2003.\n\nWe do not have the expertise to examine the scientific accuracy of the pronouncements in the press releases. The \nissue is the subject of pending civil litigation.\n\nWe did examine whether the White House improperly influenced the content of the press releases so that they \nwould intentionally mislead the public.The EPA press releases were coordinated with Samuel Thernstrom,associ-\nate director for communications at the White House Council on Environmental Quality.Oral reports,interviews with \nEPA officials,and materials on the EPA's Web site were not coordinated through the White House.Although the \nWhite House review process resulted in some editorial changes to the press releases,these changes were \nconsistent with what the EPA had already been saying without White House clearance.See,e.g.,David France and \nErika Check,\"Asbestos Alert; How much of the chemical does the World Trade Center wreckage contain?\" \nNewsweekWebExclusive ,Sept.14,2001 (quoting EPA Administrator Whitman as saying the air quality is not a \nhealth problem);Andrew C.Revkin,\"After the Attacks:The Chemicals;Monitors Say Health Risk From Smoke Is Very \nSmall,\" NewYorkTimes ,Sept.14,2001,p.A6 (EPA says levels of airborne asbestos below threshold of \nconcern);Hugo Kugiya,\"Terrorist Attacks;Asbestos Targeted in Cleanup Effort;EPA's Whitman:'No reason for \nconcern,'\" News-day ,Sept.16,2001,p.W31 (Whitman says there is no reason for concern given EPA tests for \nasbestos).There were disputes between the EPA's communications person and the White House coordinator \nregarding the press releases. The EPA communications person said she felt extreme pressure from the White \nHouse coordinator,and felt that they were no longer her press releases.EPA Inspector General interview of Tina \nKreisher,Aug.28,2002.The White House coordinator,however,told us that these disputes were solely concerned with \nprocess,not the actual substance of the releases.Samuel Thernstrom interview (Mar.31,2004).Former EPA \nadministrator Christine Whitman agreed with the White House coordinator.Christine Whitman interview (June \n28,2004) The documentary evidence supports this claim.Although Whitman told us she spoke with White House \nsenior economic adviser Lawrence Lindsey regarding the need to get the financial markets open quickly,she denied \nhe pressured her to declare the air was safe due to economic expediency.We found no evidence of pressure on \nEPA to say the air was safe in order to permit the markets to reopen.Moreover,the most controversial release that \nspecifically declared the air safe to breathe was released after the markets had already reopened.\n\nThe EPA did not have the health-based benchmarks needed to assess the extraordinary air quality conditions in \nLower Manhattan after 9/11.The EPA and the White House therefore improvised and applied standards developed \nfor other circumstances in order to make pronouncements regarding air safety,advising workers at Ground Zero to \nuse protective gear and advising the general population that the air was safe.Whether those improvisations were \nappropriate is still a subject for medical and scientific debate. See EPA Inspector General report,\"EPA's Response \nto the World Trade Center Collapse,\"Aug.21,2003,pp.9-19.\n\n14.Brill, After ,pp.47-50.\n\n15.We studied this episode and interviewed many of the participants.The NYSE,Amex,and Nasdaq have developed \nplans for coordination and cooperation in the event of a disaster affecting one or all of them,but these plans do not \ninclude other exchanges or international components.The White House efforts during the crisis were coordinated by \nthe President's Working Group on Financial Markets,a group created in the 1980s.\n\n16.Brill, After ,pp.53-55,89-91.Following interim reports in 1999 and 2000,a congressional commission\n\nchaired by former senators Gary Hart and Warren Rudman,and directed by retired general Charles Boyd,had,in \nJanuary 2001,recommended the creation of a cabinet department dedicated to \"homeland security.\"In May 2001, \nPresident Bush named Vice President Cheney to head a task force on problems of national preparedness.His \nrecently hired coordinator,Admiral Steven Abbot,had started work just before the 9/11 attack.\n\n17.Ashcroft told us that he established a \"hold until cleared\"policy because of the high rate of flight from deportation \nproceedings.John Ashcroft testimony,Apr.13,2004.For closure of hearings and secrecy of the detainee names,see \nDOJ email,Chief Immigration Judge Michael Creppy to all immigration judges,\"Cases requiring special \nprocedures,\"Sept.21,2001.This policy has been challenged in two U.S.courts of appeals.The Sixth Circuit held that \nthere is a constitutional right of public access to these hearings;the Third Circuit reached the opposite result.The \n\n\n\nSupreme Court has not yet decided to resolve this \"circuit split.\"See Detroit Free Press v.Ashcroft ,303 F.3d 681 \n(6th Cir.2002); North Jersey Media Group,Inc.v.Ashcroft ,308 F.3d 198 (3d Cir.2002), cert.denied ,123 S.Ct. 2215 \n(2003).

the national \nairspace.While the national airspace was closed,decisions to allow aircraft to fly were made by the FAA working \nwith the Department of Defense,Department of State,U.S.Secret Service,and the FBI.The Department of \nTransportation reopened the national airspace to U.S.carriers effective 11:00 A.M.on September 13,2001,for flights \nout of or into airports that had implemented the FAA's new security requirements.See FAA response to Commission \nquestions for the record,June 8,2004.\n\n25.After the airspace reopened,nine chartered flights with 160 people,mostly Saudi nationals,departed from the \nUnited States between September 14 and 24.In addition,one Saudi government flight,containing the Saudi deputy \ndefense minister and other members of an official Saudi delegation,departed Newark Airport on September \n14.Every airport involved in these Saudi flights was open when the flight departed,and no inappropriate actions \nwere taken to allow those flights to depart.See City of St.Louis Airport Authority,Lambert-St.Louis International \nAirport response to Commission questions for the record,May 27,2004;Los Angeles International Airport response \nto Commission questions for the record,June 2,2004;Greater Orlando Aviation Authority,Orlando International \nAirport response to Commission questions for the record,June 8,2004;Metropolitan

record,July 9,2004.\n\nAnother particular allegation is that a flight carrying Saudi nationals from Tampa,Florida,to Lexington,Ken-tucky,was \nallowed to fly while airspace was closed,with special approval by senior U.S.government officials.On September \n13,Tampa police brought three young Saudis they were protecting on an off-duty security detail to the airport so \nthey could get on a plane to Lexington.Tampa police arranged for two private investigators to provide security on \nthe flight.They boarded a chartered Learjet.Dan Grossi interview (May 24,2004);Manuel Perez interview (May \n27,2004);John Solomon interview (June 4,2004);Michael Fendle interview (June 4,2004).The plane took off at 4:37 \nP.M.,after national airspace was open,more than five hours after the Tampa airport had reopened, and after other \nflights had arrived at and departed from that airport.Hillsborough County Aviation Authority,Tampa International \nAirport response to Commission questions for the record,June 7,2004.The plane's pilot told us there was \"nothing \n\n\n\nunusual whatsoever\"about the flight other than there were few airplanes in the sky.The company's owner and \ndirector of operations agreed,saying that \"it was just a routine little trip for us\"and that he would have\n\nheard if there had been anything unusual about it.The pilot said he followed standard procedures and filed his flight \nplan with the FAA prior to the flight,adding,\"I was never questioned about it.\"Christopher Steele interview (June \n14,2004);Barry Ellis interview (June 14,2004).FAA records confirm this account.FAA supplemental response to \nCommission questions for the record,June 8,2004.When the plane arrived at Lexington Blue Grass Airport,that \nairport had also been open for more than five hours.Lexington-Fayette Urban County Airport Board,Blue Grass \nAirport response to Commission questions for the record,June 8,2004.The three Saudi nationals debarked from the \nplane and were met by local police.Their private security guards were paid,and the police then escorted the three \nSaudi passengers to a hotel where they joined relatives already in Lexington.Mark Barnard interview (June \n7,2004).The FBI is alleged to have had no record of the flight and denied that it occurred,hence contributing to the \nstory of a \"phantom flight.\"This is another misunderstanding.The FBI was initially misinformed about how the Saudis \ngot to Lexington by a local police officer in Lexington who did not have firsthand knowledge of the matter.The \nBureau subsequently learned about the flight.James M.interview (June 18,2004).\n\n26.Richard Clarke interview (Jan.12,2004).\n\n27.Andrew Card meeting (Mar.31,2004);President Bush and Vice President Cheney

able to tell you who did it,who brought this \nproposal to me,but I don't know\").Instead,the matter was handled as follows.Within days of September 11, fearing \nreprisals against Saudi nationals,Rihab Massoud,the deputy chief of mission at the Saudi embassy in Wash-\nington,D.C.,called Dale Watson,the FBI's assistant director for counterterrorism,and asked for help in getting some \nof its citizens out of the country.Rihab Massoud interview (May 11,2004).At about the same time,Michael \nRolince,chief of the FBI's international terrorism operations section,also heard from an FBI official in Newark about \na proposed flight of Saudis out of the country.Michael Rolince interview (June 9,2004).We believe this was the \nSaudi deputy defense minister's flight.Rolince says he told the Newark official that the Saudis should not be allowed \nto leave without having the names on their passports matched to their faces,and their names run through FBI case \nrecords to see whether they had surfaced before.Rolince and Watson briefed Robert Mueller,the director of the \nFBI,about the issue and how they were handling it.The State Department played a role as well in flights involving \ngovernment officials or members of the royal family.State coordinated with the FBI and FAA to allow screening by \nthe FBI of flights with Saudi nationals on board.There is no evidence that State tried to limit the screening.DOS \nrecord,Log of USA 9-11 Terrorist Attack Task Force,Sept.13,2001;Jack S.interview (June 14, 2004).The FBI \neffectively approved the Saudi flights at the level of a section chief.Having an opportunity to check the Saudis was \nuseful to the FBI.This was because the U.S.government did not,and does not,routinely run checks on foreigners \nwho are leaving the United States.This procedure was convenient to the FBI,as the Saudis who wished to leave in \nthis way would gather and present themselves for record checks and interviews,an opportunity that would not be \navailable if they simply left on regularly scheduled commercial flights.\n\n28.These flights were screened by law enforcement officials,primarily the FBI.For example,one flight,the so-called \nBin Ladin flight,departed the United States on September 20 with 26 passengers,most of them relatives of Usama \nBin Ladin.Screening of this flight was directed by an FBI agent in the Baltimore Field Office who was also a \npilot.This agent,coordinating with FBI headquarters,sent an electronic communication to each of the field offices \nthrough which the Bin Ladin flight was scheduled to pass,including the proposed flight manifest and directing what \nscreening should occur.He also monitored the flight as it moved around the country - from St.Louis to Los Angeles \nto Orlando to Washington Dulles,and to Boston Logan - correcting for any changes in itinerary to make sure there \nwas no lapse in FBI screening at these locations.Again,each of the airports through which the Bin Ladin flight \npassed was open,and no special restrictions were lifted to accommodate its passage.James C.interview (June \n3,2004).\n\nThe Bin Ladin flight and other flights we examined were screened in accordance with policies set by FBI \nheadquarters and coordinated through working-level interagency processes.Michael Rolince interview (June \n9,2004). Although most of the passengers were not interviewed,22 of the 26 people on the Bin Ladin flight were \n\n\n\ninterviewed by the FBI.Many were asked detailed questions.None of the passengers stated that they had any \nrecent contact with Usama Bin Ladin or knew anything about terrorist activity.See,e.g.,FBI report of \ninvestigation,inter-view of Mohammed Saleh Bin Laden,Sept.21,2001.As Richard Clarke noted,long before 9/11 the \nFBI was following members of the Bin Ladin family in the United States closely.Richard Clarke \ntestimony,Mar.24,2004. Two of the passengers on this flight had been the subjects of preliminary investigations by \nthe FBI,but both their cases had been closed,in 1999 and March 2001,respectively,because the FBI had uncovered \nno derogatory information on either person linking them to terrorist activity.Their cases remained closed as of \n9/11,were not reopened before they departed the country on this flight,and have not been reopened since.FBI \nelectronic communication, Summary of Information Regarding Flights taken by Saudi Citizens Out of the \nU.S.Shortly After September 11, 2001,Oct.29,2003,pp.9-10.\n\n29.Michael Rolince interview (June 9,2004).Massoud corroborates this account.He said the FBI required the names \nand personal information of all departing passengers sponsored for departure by the Saudi Embassy.Rihab \nMassoud interview (May 11,2004).\n\n30.Jack S.interview (June 14,2004).\n\n31.The FBI checked a variety of databases for information on the Bin Ladin flight passengers and searched the \naircraft.Because it was not clear to us whether the TIPOFF terrorist watchlist was checked by the FBI,the Terrorist \nScreening Center checked the names of individuals on the flight manifests of six Saudi flights against the current \nTIPOFF watchlist at our request prior to our hearing in April 2004.There were no matches.At our request, based on \nadditional information,the Terrorist Screening Center in June and July 2004 rechecked the names of individuals \nbelieved to be on these six flights,the names of individuals on three more charter flights,the names of individuals on \nthe flight containing the Saudi Deputy Defense Minister,and the names of Saudi nationals on commercial flights that \njournalists have alleged are suspect.There were no matches.Tim D.interviews (Apr.12,2004;June 30, 2004;July \n9,2004);FBI memo,Terrorist Screening Center to Director's Office,\"Request by 9/11 Commission Task Force to \nscreen the airline passenger lists through the TDSB and TIPOFF databases,\"Mar.30,2004.\n\n32.White House transcript,Vice President Cheney interview with Charlie Gibson ofABC,Sept.4,2002,p.11.\n\n33.\"The only ...true advice I receive is from our war council.\"White House transcript,President Bush interview with \nBob Woodward and Dan Balz of the Washington Post ,Dec.20,2001.\n\n34.On Secretary Rumsfeld's remarks,see White House transcript,President Bush interview with Bob Wood-ward \nand Dan Balz,Dec.20,2001.The President's adviser,Karen Hughes,who was in the interview,listed the points \nRumsfeld made at the smaller NSC meeting.Ibid.\n\n35.On the President's tasking in the earlier meeting held that day,see NSC memo,Summary of Conclusions for \nNSC Meeting Held on September 12,2001,Dec.17,2001.On the paper that went beyond al Qaeda,see NSC \nmemo,Deputies Draft Paper (attached to Agenda for NSC Meeting Scheduled for Sept.12,2001).The Summary of \nConclusions for the afternoon meeting indicates that the paper was discussed.\n\nOn giving priority to preventing terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction,seeWhite House tran-\nscript,Hadley interview with Dan Balz and Bob Woodward,Jan.11,2002,p.535.\n\n36.NSC memo,Summary of Conclusions for Principals Committee Meeting Held on September 13,2001.

of Islamism .This term distinguishes itself from Islamic by the fact \nthat the latter refers to a religion and culture in existence over a millennium,whereas the first is a political/religious \nphenomenon linked to the great events of the 20th century. Furthermore Islamists define themselves as \n'Islamiyyoun/Islamists'precisely to differentiate themselves from 'Muslimun/Muslims.'\u2026 Islamism is defined as 'an \nIslamic militant,anti-democratic

argument was that the Muslims should gather their assets,not \nstriking back blindly,but instead planning a thoughtful,long-term strategy to defeat their worldwide enemies,which he \nargued were

visa applications we reviewed arguably could have been denied visas \nbecause their applications were not filled out completely.Had State visa officials routinely had a practice of acquiring \nmore information in such cases,they likely would have found more grounds for denial.For example,three hijackers \nmade statements on their visa applications that could have been proved false by U.S.government records (Hani \nHanjour, Saeed al Ghamdi,and Khalid al Mihdhar),and many lied about their employment or educational status.Two \nhijackers could have been denied admission at the port of entry based on violations of immigration rules governing \nterms of admission - Mohamed Atta overstayed his tourist visa and then failed to present a proper vocational school \nvisa when he entered in January 2001;Ziad Jarrah attended school in June 2000 without properly adjusting his \nimmigration status,an action that violated his immigration status and rendered him inadmissible on each of his six \nsubsequent reentries into the United States between June 2000 and August 5,2001.There were possible grounds to \ndeny entry to a third hijacker (Marwan al Shehhi).One hijacker violated his immigration status by failing to enroll as \na student after entry (Hani Hanjour);two hijackers overstayed their terms of admission by four and eight months \nrespectively (Satam al Suqami and Nawaf al Hazmi).Atta and Shehhi attended a flight school (Huffman Aviation) \nthat the Justice Department's Inspector General concluded should not have been certified to accept foreign stu-\ndents,see DOJ Inspector General's report,\"The INS'Contacts with Two September 11 Terrorists:A Review of the \nINS's Admissions of Atta and Shehhi,its Processing of their Change of Status Applications,and its Efforts to Track \nForeign Students in the United States,\"May 20,2002.\n\n34.John Gordon interview (May 13,2004).\n\n35.For a description of a layering approach,see Stephen Flynn, America the Vulnerable:How the U.S.Has Failed to \nSecure the Homeland and Protect Its People from Terrorism (HarperCollins,2004),p.69.\n\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/book/index.html\n\n\n36.The logical and timely rollout of such a program is hampered by an astonishingly long list of congressional \nmandates. The system originated in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 and \napplied to all non-U.S.citizens who enter or exit the United States at any port of entry.Pub.L.No.104-208, 110 \nStat.3009 (1996),[sect] 110.The Data Management Improvement Act of 2000 altered this mandate by incorporating \na requirement for a searchable centralized database,limiting the government's ability to require new data from \ncertain travelers and setting a series of implementation deadlines.Pub.L.No.106-215,114 Stat.337 (2000), [sect] \n2(a).The USA PATRIOT Act mandated that the Attorney General and Secretary of State \"particularly focus\"on \nhaving the entry-exit system include biometrics and tamper-resistant travel documents readable at all ports of entry. \nPub.L.No.107-56,115 Stat.272 (2001),[sect] 1008(a).In the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act, \nCongress directed that,not later than October 26,2004,the attorney general and the secretary of state issue to all \nnon-U.S.citizens only machine-readable,tamper-resistant visas and other travel and entry documents that use \nbiometric identifiers and install equipment at all U.S.ports of entry to allow biometric authentication of such docu-\nments.Pub.L.No.107-173,116 Stat.543 (2002),[sect] 303(b).The Act also required that increased security still \nfacilitate the free flow of commerce and travel.Ibid.[sect] 102(a)(1)(C).The administration has requested a delay of \ntwo years for the requirement of tamper-proof passports.Testimony ofThomas Ridge before the House Judiciary \nCommit-tee,Apr. 21, 2004 (online at  http://www.dhs.gov/dhspublic/display?theme=45content=3498print=true  ). \nProgram planners have set a goal of collecting information,confirming identity,providing information about foreign \nnationals throughout the entire immigration system,and ultimately enabling each point in the system to assess the \nlawfulness of travel and any security risks.\n\n37.There are at least three registered traveler programs underway,at different points in the system,designed and \nrun by two different agencies in the Department of Homeland Security (outside the U.S.VISIT system),which must \nultimately be the basis for access to the United States.\n\n38.For the statistics,see DOS report,\"Workload Statistics by Post Regions for All Visa Classes \" June 18,2004. One \npost-9/11 screening process,known as Condor,has conducted over 130,000 extra name-checks.DOS letter, Karl \nHofmann to the Commission,Apr.5,2004.The checks have caused significant delays in some cases but have never \nresulted in visas being denied on terrorism grounds.For a discussion of visa delays,see General Accounting Office \nreport,\"Border Security:Improvements Needed to Reduce Time Taken to Adjudicate Visas for Science Students and \nScholars,\"Feb.2004.We do not know all the reasons why visa applications have dropped so significantly. Several \nfactors beyond the visa process itself include the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System,which requires \nadditional screening processes for certain groups from Arab and Muslim countries;the Iraq war;and per-\n\nhaps cyclical economic factors.For the cost to the United States of visa backlogs,see National Foreign Trade \nCouncil report,\"Visa Backlog Costs U.S.Exporters More Than $30 Billion Since 2002,New Study Finds,\"June \n2,2004 (online at  http://www.nftc.org/newsflash/newsflash.asp?Mode=Viewarticleid=1686Category=All  ).\n\n39.These issues are on the G-8 agenda.White House press release,\"G-8 Secure and Facilitated Travel Initiative \n(SAFTI),\"June 9,2004 (online at  http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/06/20040609-51.html  ).Lax \npassport issuance standards are among the vulnerabilities exploited by terrorists,possibly including two of the 9/11 \nhijackers.Three models exist for strengthened prescreening: (1) better screening by airlines, such as the use of \nimproved document authentication technology;(2) posting of border agents or inspectors in foreign airports to work \ncooperatively with foreign counterparts;and (3) establishing a full preinspection regime,such as now exists for travel \nto the United States from Canada and Ireland.All three models should be pursued,in addition to electronic \nprescreening .\n\n40.Among the more important problems to address is that of varying transliterations of the same name.For \nexample,the current lack of a single convention for transliterating Arabic names enabled the 19 hijackers to vary the \nspelling of their names to defeat name-based watchlist systems and confuse any potential efforts to locate them. \nWhile the gradual introduction of biometric identifiers will help,that process will take years,and a name match will \nalways be useful.The ICAO should discuss the adoption of a standard requiring a digital code for all names that \nneed to be translated into the Roman alphabet,ensuring one common spelling for all countries.\n\n41.On achieving more reliable identification,see Markle Foundation task force report, Creating a Trusted Information \nNetwork for Homeland Security (Markle Foundation,2003),p.72 (online at  http://www.markle.org  ).\n\nhttp://www.dhs.gov/dhspublic/display?theme=45content=3498print=true\nhttp://www.nftc.org/newsflash/newsflash.asp?Mode=Viewarticleid=1686Category=All\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/06/20040609-51.html\nhttp://www.markle.org/\n\n\n42.General Accounting Office report, MassTransit:FederalActionCouldHelpTransitAgenciesAddressSecurityChal-\nlenges ,GAO-03-263,Dec.2002 (online at  http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03263.pdf  ).\n\n13 How to Do It? A Different Way of Organizing the Government \n\n1.The Bush administration clarified the respective missions of the different intelligence analysis centers in a letter \nsent by Secretary Ridge,DCI Tenet,FBI Director Mueller,and TTIC Director Brennan to Senators Susan Collins and \nCarl Levin on April 13,2004.The letter did not mention any element of the Department of Defense.It stated that the \nDCI would define what analytical resources he would transfer from the CTC to TTIC no later than June 1,2004.DCI \nTenet subsequently told us that he decided that TTIC would have primary responsibility for terrorism analysis but \nthat the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency would grow their own analysts.TTIC will have tasking authority \nover terrorism analysts in other intelligence agencies,although there will need to be a board to supervise \ndeconfliction.George Tenet interview (July 2,2004).We have not received any details regarding this plan.\n\n2.\"TTIC has no operational authority.However,TTIC has the authority to task collection and analysis from \nIntelligence Community agencies,the FBI,and DHS through tasking mechanisms we will create.The analytic work \nconducted at TTIC creates products that inform each of TTIC's partner elements,as well as other Federal \ndepartments and agencies as appropriate.\"Letter from Ridge and others to Collins and Levin,Apr.13,2004.\n\n3.Donald Rumsfeld prepared statement,Mar.23,2004,p.20.\n\n4.In this conception,the NCTC should plan actions,assigning responsibilities for operational direction and execution \nto other agencies.It would be built on TTIC and would be supported by the intelligence community as TTIC is \nnow.Whichever route is chosen,the scarce analytical resources now dispersed among TTIC,the Defense \nIntelligence Agency's Joint Interagency Task Force - Combatting Terrorism (JITF-CT),and the DCI's Countert-\nerrorist Center (CTC) should be concentrated more effectively than they are now.\n\n     *  The DCI's Counterterrorist Center would become a CIA unit,to handle\n\n        the direction and execution of tasks assigned to the CIA.It could\n\n        have detailees from other agencies,as it does now,to perform this\n\n        operational mission.It would yield much of the broader,strategic\n\n        analytic duties and personnel to the NCTC.The CTC would rely on the\n\n        restructured CIA (discussed in section 13.2) to organize,train,and\n\n        equip its personnel.\n\n     *  Similarly,the FBI's Counterterrorism Division would remain,as\n\n        now,the operational arm of the Bureau to combat terrorism.As it\n\n        does now,it would work with other agencies in carrying out these\n\n        missions,retain-ing the JTTF structure now in place.The\n\n        Counterterrorism Division would rely on the FBI's Office of\n\n        Intelligence to train and equip its personnel,helping to process\n\n        and report the information gathered in the field.\n\n     *  The Defense Department's unified commands - SOCOM,NORTHCOM,and\n\n        CENTCOM - would be the joint operational centers taking on DOD\n\n        tasks.Much of the excellent analytical talent that has been\n\n        assembled in the Defense Intelligence Agency's JITF-CT should merge\n\n        into the planned NCTC.\n\nhttp://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03263.pdf\n\n\n     *  The Department of Homeland Security's Directorate for Information\n\n        Analysis and Infrastructure Protection should retain its core\n\n        duties,but the NCTC should have the ultimate responsibility for\n\n        producing net assessments that utilize Homeland Security's\n\n        analysis of domestic vulnerabilities and integrate all-source\n\n        analysis of foreign intelligence about the terrorist enemy.\n\n     *  The State Department's counterterrorism office would be a critical\n\n        participant in the NCTC's work,taking the lead in directing the\n\n        execution of the counterterrorism foreign policy mission.\n\nThe proposed National Counterterrorism Center should offer one-stop shopping to agencies with counterterror-ism \nand homeland security responsibilities.That is,it should be an authoritative reference base on the transnational \nterrorist organizations:their people,goals,strategies,capabilities,networks of contacts and support,the context in \nwhich they operate,and their characteristic habits across the life cycle of operations - recruitment,reconnaissance, \ntarget selection,logistics,and travel.For example,this Center would offer an integrated depiction of groups like al \nQaeda or Hezbollah worldwide,overseas,and in the United States.\n\nThe NCTC will not eliminate the need for the executive departments to have their own analytic units.But it would \nenable agency-based analytic units to become smaller and more efficient.In particular,it would make it possible for \nthese agency-based analytic units to concentrate on analysis that is tailored to their agency's specific \nresponsibilities.\n\nA useful analogy is in military intelligence.There,the Defense Intelligence Agency and the service production \nagencies (like the Army's National Ground Intelligence Center) are the institutional memory and reference source \nfor enemy order of battle,enemy organization,and enemy equipment.Yet the Joint Staff and all the theater \ncommands still have their own J-2s.They draw on the information they need,tailoring and applying it to their \noperational needs.As they learn more from their tactical operations,they pass intelligence of enduring value back up \nto the Defense Intelligence Agency and the services so it can be evaluated,form part of the institutional memory,and \nhelp guide future collection.\n\nIn our proposal,that reservoir of institutional memory about terrorist organizations would function for the government \nas a whole,and would be in the NCTC.\n\n5.The head of the NCTC would thus help coordinate the operational side of these agencies,like the FBI's \nCounterterrorism Division.The intelligence side of these agencies,such as the FBI's Office of Intelligence,would be \noverseen by the National Intelligence Director we recommend later in this chapter.\n\n6.The quotation goes on:\"It includes gaps in intelligence,but also intelligence that,like a string of pearls too precious \nto wear,is too sensitive to give to those who need it.It includes the alarm that fails to work,but also the alarm that \nhas gone off so often it has been disconnected.It includes the unalert watchman,but also the one who knows he'll \nbe chewed out by his superior if he gets higher authority out of bed.It includes the contingencies that occur to no \none,but also those that everyone assumes somebody else is taking care of.It includes straightforward \nprocrastination,but also decisions protracted by internal disagreement.It includes,in addition,the inability of \nindividual human beings to rise to the occasion until they are sure it is the occasion - which is usually too late\u2026 \nFinally,as at Pearl Harbor,surprise may include some measure of genuine novelty introduced by the enemy,and \nsome sheer bad luck.\"Thomas Schelling,foreword to Roberta Wohlstetter, Pearl Harbor:Warning and Decision \n(Stanford Univ.Press,1962),p.viii.\n\n7.For the Goldwater-Nichols Act,see Pub.L.No.99-433,100 Stat.992 (1986).For a general discussion of the act,see \nGordon Lederman, Reorganizing the Joint Chiefs of Staff:The Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 (Greenwood,1999); \n\n\n\nJames Locher, Victory on the Potomac:The Goldwater-Nichols Act Unifies the Pentagon (Texas A&M \nUniv.Press,2003).\n\n8.For a history of the DCI's authority over the intelligence community,see CIA report,Michael Warner ed., Central \nIntelligence;Origin and Evolution (CIA Center for the Study of Intelligence,2001).For the Director's view of his \ncommunity authorities,see DCI directive,\"Director of Central Intelligence Directive 1/1:The Authorities and \nResponsibilities of the Director of Central Intelligence as Head of the U.S.Intelligence Community,\"Nov.19, 1998.\n\n9.As Norman Augustine,former chairman of Lockheed Martin Corporation,writes regarding power in the \ngovernment,\"As in business,cash is king.If you are not in charge of your budget,you are not king.\"Norman \nAugustine, Managing to Survive in Washington:A Beginner's Guide to High-Level Management in Government \n(Center for Strategic and International Studies,2000),p.20.\n\n10.For the DCI and the secretary of defense,see 50 U.S.C.[sect] 403-6(a).If the director does not concur with the \nsecretary's choice,then the secretary is required to notify the president of the director's nonconcurrence.Ibid. For the \nDCI and the attorney general,see 50 U.S.C.[sect] 403-6(b)(3).\n\n11.The new program would replace the existing National Foreign Intelligence Program.\n\n12.Some smaller parts of the current intelligence community,such as the State Department's intelligence bureau \nand the Energy Department's intelligence entity,should not be funded out of the national intelligence program and \nshould be the responsibility of their home departments.\n\n13.The head of the NCTC should have the rank of a deputy national intelligence director,e.g.,Executive Level II,but \nwould have a different title.\n\n14.If the organization of defense intelligence remains as it is now,the appropriate official would be the under \nsecretary of defense for intelligence.If defense intelligence is reorganized to elevate the responsibilities of the \ndirector of the DIA,then that person might be the appropriate official.\n\n15.For the information technology architecture,see Ruth David interview (June 10,2003).For the necessity of \nmoving from need-to-know to need-to-share,see James Steinberg testimony,Oct.14,2003.The Director still has no \nstrategy for removing information-sharing barriers and - more than two years since 9/11 - has only appointed a \nworking group on the subject.George Tenet prepared statement,Mar.24,2004,p.37.\n\n16.The intelligence community currently makes information shareable by creating \"tearline\"reports,with the \nnonshareable information at the top and then,below the \"tearline,\"the portion that recipients are told they can \nshare.This proposal reverses that concept.All reports are created as tearline data,with the shareable information at \nthe top and with added details accessible on a system that requires permissions or authentication.\n\n17.See Markle Foundation Task Force report, Creating a Trusted Information Network for Homeland Security \n(Markle Foundation,2003);Markle Foundation Task Force report, Protecting America's Freedom in the Information \nAge (Markle Foundation,2002) (both online at  http://www.markle.org  ).\n\n18.Markle Foundation Task Force report, Creating a Trusted Information Network ,p.12.The pressing need for such \nguidelines was also spotlighted by the Technology and Privacy Advisory Committee appointed by Secretary \nRumsfeld to advise the Department of Defense on the privacy implications of its Terrorism Information Awareness \nProgram.Technology and Privacy Advisory Committee report, Safeguarding Privacy in the Fight Against Terrorism \n(2004) (online at  http://www.sainc.com/tapac/TAPAC_Report_Final_5-10-04.pdf  ).We take no position on the \nparticular recommendations offered in that report,but it raises issues that pertain to the government as a whole - \nnot just to the Department of Defense.\n\n19.This change should eliminate the need in the Senate for the current procedure of sequential referral of the \nannual authorization bill for the national foreign intelligence program.In that process,the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee reviews the bill passed by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence before the bill is brought before \nthe full Senate for consideration.\n\nhttp://www.markle.org/\nhttp://www.sainc.com/tapac/TAPAC_Report_Final_5-10-04.pdf\n\n\n20.This recommendation,and measures to assist the Bureau in developing its intelligence cadre,are included in the \nreport accompanying the Commerce,Justice and State Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2005,passed by the \nHouse of Representatives on July 7,2004.H.R.Rep.No.108-576,108th Cong.,2d sess.(2004),p.22.\n\n21.Letter from Ridge and others to Collins and Levin, Apr.13,2004.\n\n22.For the directorate's current capability,see Patrick Hughes interview (Apr.2,2004).\n"}
