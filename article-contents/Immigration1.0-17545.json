{"title": "Senate rejects measure to ease immigration rules", "body": "\nWashington --- Efforts to pave the way for some illegal immigrants to work their way to citizenship failed in the \nSenate on a procedural vote Tuesday, but supporters of the legislation said they would try again.\n\nThe AgJobs Bill, which would allow an estimated 500,000 undocumented farm workers and their families to gain \nlegal status in the United States, fell seven votes short of the 60 needed to force the Senate to consider the \nmeasure.\n\nIt was being offered as part of an $80.7 billion supplemental appropriations bill to finance military operations in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. The Senate is expected to approve that bill within days.\n\nSupporters of the bill said the 53-45 vote indicated that a majority of the Senate supports the legislation. By \ncontrast, they noted that only 21 senators voted Tuesday for a competing bill, backed by Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-\nGa.), that would streamline the current H-2A \"guest worker\" visa program for agricultural workers but not allow \nillegal immigrants to gain citizenship without first returning to their native country and going through normal \nimmigration procedures.\n\nThe AgJobs Bill offered by Sens. Larry Craig (R-Idaho) and Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) would have allowed \nillegal agricultural workers and their families to eventually gain permanent legal residency status if they continued \nworking for six years. Such status could then lead to citizenship.\n\nThe other proposal, offered by Chambliss and Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), would have allowed agricultural employers to \nhire workers under a \"blue card\" system for three to nine years.\n"}
