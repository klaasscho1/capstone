Chairman Michael Dell said Monday.\n\nCongress should move quickly to approve legislation raising the annual limit on the number of high-skilled \nimmigrants allowed to enter the country on H-1B visas, he said.\nCONSTITUTION\n\n''The cap should definitely be increased because there is a huge shortage of workers,'' Dell said at the Global \nInternet Summit at George Mason University.\n\n''If you want to bring wealth to this country, you'll bring in knowledgable workers.''\n\nToday's tight labor pool is driving up the cost of doing business, he said.\n\n''What happens is the limited supply of workers who actually have the skills get bid up, just like Internet stocks,'' \nDell said.\n\nSpiraling wages in this country could spur U.S. employers to expand overseas, he warned.\n\nCongress is considering several bills that would boost the annual limit on H-1B visas from 115,000 to as much as \n195,000.\n\nDell blamed the worker shortage on educators who are failing to teach young people the skills they need to get \njobs in the economy's booming technology sector.\n\n''The education system needs to fundamentally embrace the idea of computing being a central skill,'' he said.\n\nDell also said that if Congress were to allow states to impose sales taxes on interstate retail transactions, his \ncompany would be able to adapt to the change without losing business.\n\nBut he warned that because cyberspace is borderless, U.S. online retailers might move operations overseas to \navoid taxes.\n"}
