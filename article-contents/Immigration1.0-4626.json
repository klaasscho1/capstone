Also before the\n\nCourt are Petitioner\u2019s motions for evidentiary hearing (ECF No. 120) and to preserve testimony\n\n(ECF No. 150).\n\nI.\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nPetitioner is currently in the custody of the California Department of Corrections and\n\nRehabilitation pursuant to a judgment of the Superior Court of California, County of Kern,\n\nfollowing his conviction by court trial on August 3, 1988 of the first degree murders of Juan\n\nBocanegra (\u201cMr. Bocanegra\u201d) and Juanita Bocanegra (\u201cMrs. Bocanegra\u201d) (Cal. Pen. Code \u00a7\n\n187), and of the separate (non-capital) first degree murder of Woodrow Tatman (\u201cMr. Tatman\u201d)\n\n(Cal. Pen. Code \u00a7 187). The multiple-murder special-circumstance allegation (Cal. Pen. Code \u00a7\n\n190.2, subd. (a)(3)) as to the murders of Mr. Bocanegra and Mrs. Bocanegra was found true.\n\nThe trial court also found Petitioner used a deadly and dangerous weapon in the murders of the\n\nMr. Bocanegra and Mrs. Bocanegra (Cal. Pen. Code \u00a7 12022, subd. (b)), and that Petitioner was\n\nguilty of the robbery of Mr. Tatman. (Cal. Pen. Code \u00a7 211.)\n\nOn September 21, 1988, a penalty phase jury was empaneled. During the penalty phase,\n\nthe prosecution introduced evidence (see Cal. Pen. Code \u00a7 190.3) that in 1982 Petitioner was\n\ninvolved in the use of, or attempted use of, force or violence against a store owner, Mr.\n\nAmmarie, and against a friend, Mr. Pena. Defendant in turn offered evidence of his\n\n1\n\nPursuant to Fed. R. Civ.

On October 31, 1988, the trial\n\ncourt denied Petitioner\u2019s motion to modify the verdict (Cal. Pen. Code \u00a7 190.4) and sentenced\n\nPetitioner to death for aiding and abetting the stabbing deaths of Mr. & Mrs. Bocanegra; to 25\n\nyears to life for the Tatman murder; to 5 years for the Tatman robbery; and to 2 years for the\n\nweapon enhancement.\n\nOn December 14, 1995, the California Supreme Court affirmed the judgment and\n\nsentence on direct appeal. People v. Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th 1 (1995). The California Supreme\n\nCourt denied petition for rehearing but modified its opinion on February 21, 1996. People v.\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th 825b (1996). Petitioner\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari was denied by the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court on October 7, 1996. Sanchez v. California, 519 U.S. 835 (1996).\n\nPetitioner filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the California Supreme Court. The\n\nstate petition was summarily denied on October 22, 1997. In re Sanchez, S049502.\n\nOn September 17, 1998, Petitioner filed his federal petition for writ of habeas corpus\n\narguing insufficient evidence, actual innocence, prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel based on allegations he did not assist Joey Bocanegra (\u201cJoey\u201d) in killing\n\nMr. Bocanegra, Joey\u2019s father, and that his assistance in the murder of Mrs. Bocanegra, Joey\u2019s\n\nmother, does not make him eligible for the death penalty.\n\nRespondent filed an answer on October 19, 1998 and an amended answer on February 8,\n\n1999, admitting jurisdictional and procedural allegations (except paragraphs, 1, 16, 18-20),\n\nasserting procedural defenses, and denying all claims 1 through 61.\n\nOn December 9, 1998, the Court found all claims to be fully exhausted.\n\nOn April 5, 1999, Petitioner filed a memorandum of points and authorities in support of\n\nthe petition. On July 1, 1999, Respondent filed a memorandum of points and authorities in\n\nsupport of his answer. On August 16, 1999, Petitioner filed a reply to Respondent\u2019s\n\nmemorandum.\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 3 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n4\n\nPetitioner was granted discovery of law enforcement records relating to: the Bocanegra\n\ncrime scene, Petitioner\u2019s jail records, jailhouse informants Charles Seeley (\u201cSeeley\u201d) and Rufus\n\nHernandez (\u201cHernandez\u201d), and coroner Dr. Holloway\u2019s autopsy notes.

Petitioner does not present clear and convincing evidence\n\nto the contrary; thus, the Court adopts the factual recitations set forth by the state appellate court.\n\nSee Vasquez v. Kirkland, 572 F.3d 1029, 1031 n.1 (9th Cir. 2009) (\u201cWe rely on the state\n\nappellate court\u2019s decision for our summary of the facts of the crime.\u201d).\n\nA. Guilt Phase Facts\n\n1. The Bocanegra Murders\n\nOn the afternoon of February 3, 1987, the police found the bodies of Juan and\n\nJuanita Bocanegra in their home. Juanita was found in her sewing room, and Juan\n\nwas found in the kitchen. Both had sustained extensive stab wounds and head\n\ninjuries. A piece of fabric was tied loosely around Juanita's neck, and another\n\npiece of cloth was found on her right wrist.\n\nKern County Sheriff's criminalist Gregory Laskowski analyzed the blood found at\n\nthe scene and concluded that both victims were killed where their bodies were\n\nfound. The blood splatter evidence showed that the attack began in the hallway\n\nnear the bathroom. The fight then moved to the kitchen where large amounts of\n\nblood indicated that a struggle took place throughout the room. The evidence\n\nindicated a fierce struggle occurred throughout the house. Small amounts of\n\ndiluted blood in the bathroom suggested that someone cleaned up after the attack.\n\nLaskowski also found evidence of two types of shoe tracks on the floor of the\n\nBocanegra kitchen; one print had a \u201cchevron pattern\u201d and another, partial print,\n\ncontained a \u201cwavy sole design.\u201d A full wavy design shoe track in the bathroom\n\nwas consistent with the print found in the kitchen. Both victims were found\n\nwithout shoes; Juanita's bloodstained slippers were found in the hallway.\n\nPolice found a knife block with four empty spaces in the kitchen. Two knives,\n\nwithout bloodstains, were in the kitchen sink. There were slash marks on the\n\ncabinets directly above the knife holder. That same evening, the police recovered\n\na knife and sharpening stone that appeared to have blood on them. No fingerprints\n\n\n\nwere found on these items. But police did find a bloody palm print belonging to\n\ndefendant's accomplice Robert Reyes on the doorknob inside the Bocanegra front\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 5 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n6\n\ndoor. Autopsies performed on both Juan and Juanita revealed that they died as a\n\nresult of massive hemorrhaging due to multiple stab wounds, although the type of\n\ninstrument that inflicted the wounds could not be conclusively determined.\n\nOn February 4, 1987, the Bocanegras' Dodge Colt station wagon was found\n\nabandoned. There were extensive bloodstains on both the interior and exterior of\n\nthe car. Fingerprints belonging to Joey Bocanegra were found on the interior\n\ndriver's and right rear door windows and on the right rear door handle.\n\nTwo items of evidence linked defendant to the crimes. The missing Bocanegra\n\ntelevision set was found in the same room at the Bakersfield Inn where defendant\n\nstayed at the time of the murders, and defendant sold the Bocanegras' vacuum\n\n\n\ncleaner to Maria Rodriguez, a clerk employed by the inn. The remaining evidence\n\nused to convict defendant was based primarily on the circumstances of the crime,\n\nand incriminating statements made by defendant to police investigator Bob\n\nStratton, jailhouse informant Rufus Hernandez, and newspaper reporter Michael\n\nTrihey.\n\n2. The Tatman Murder\n\nWoodrow Wilson Tatman was a frail, undernourished, 72-year-old man who often\n\ndrank alcohol and was confined to a wheelchair. He rented a room at the\n\nBakersfield Inn, and spent his days drinking alcohol and watching television.\n\nRose McGrew was employed by the inn as a maid and she also lived on the\n\npremises. She helped care for Tatman and had last been in his room on February\n\n1, 1987. Maria Charboneau also worked and lived at the inn, and she took care of\n\nTatman's Social Security checks, and managed his finances. In the first week of\n\nFebruary, Tatman received two Social Security checks. On February 2,\n\nCharboneau gave Tatman between $80 and $100. That was the last time she saw\n\nhim alive.\n\nOn the afternoon of February 4, 1987, McGrew noticed that Tatman's drapes were\n\nstill drawn and that he had not yet picked up his mail, which included his Social\n\nSecurity check. McGrew entered the room and found Tatman's body, lying on the\n\nfloor near his bed. He was covered with a bedspread. Tatman's television, radio\n\nand electric skillet were missing from the room.\n\nThe autopsy report indicated that Tatman was killed by \u201cmassive blunt force\n\ninjury to the left chest\u201d which collapsed his left lung and caused substantial\n\nhemorrhaging. The blow to the chest was consistent with a heel stomp or with the\n\napplication of an instrument approximately two inches by three inches in size.\n\nTatman also sustained several superficial stab wounds to the chest and lower\n\nabdomen, as well as a head injury. It appeared that the superficial injuries had\n\nbeen inflicted intra or post mortem, and none contributed to death. It could not be\n\ndetermined what instrument caused the lower abdominal injuries, although it\n\nappeared that the chest wounds were inflicted by a screwdriver. Dr. John\n\nHolloway, the forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy, could not\n\ndetermine whether the wounds were caused by one or more individuals.\n\na. Statements Made to Jailhouse Informant Hernandez\n\nRufus Hernandez was incarcerated with defendant for two months during 1987.\n\nHe had been charged with receiving stolen property and second degree burglary.\n\nDefendant spoke to Hernandez about the Bocanegra murders and Hernandez\n\nentered into a plea bargain whereby he received six months in county jail and\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 6 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n7\n\nthree years' probation in exchange for his testimony.\n\nHernandez testified that defendant told him he went with Joey Bocanegra to the\n\nBocanegra house. Hernandez's testimony was inconsistent as to whether\n\ndefendant said they went with the plan of robbing the Bocanegras or only with the\n\nplan of borrowing money from Juan Bocanegra. Defendant waited outside for\n\nJoey, but entered the house when he heard Joey and Juan arguing in the hallway.\n\nDefendant claimed he tried unsuccessfully to stop the fight by hitting Juan with a\n\ncurved metal bar. He thereafter threw the bar in the front yard. Defendant did not\n\nsay whether Joey had stabbed Juan before or after defendant hit him.\n\nJuanita, who heard the commotion from another room, came out of the bedroom\n\nyelling. Defendant slipped in a puddle of blood as he jumped over Juan to reach\n\nJuanita. He thereafter grabbed Juanita and told Joey that he should \u201cshut up\u201d his\n\nmother. Joey then stabbed his mother repeatedly and pushed her into the sewing\n\nroom, where she was found. Defendant did not tell Hernandez that he did\n\nanything other than hold Juanita; instead defendant claimed that he saw Joey stab\n\nboth victims with a kitchen knife. Defendant ended his story with the comment\n\n\n\nthat after the murders he threw the bar into the front yard, and that the knife was\n\nthrown into a canal. Defendant noted that Joey took the television, a toolbox, and\n\nhis parents' hatchback automobile. Hernandez thereafter reported defendant's\n\nstatements to police investigator Stratton.\n\nb. Statements Made to Police Investigator Stratton\n\nOn February 19, 1987, Stratton met with defendant in the Kern County jail.\n\nDefendant had contacted the police through his attorney because he wished to\n\noffer statements about the Bocanegra crimes. Before commencing the interview,\n\ndefendant waived his right to counsel after receiving the admonitions required by\n\nMiranda v. Arizona (1966) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 10\n\nA.L.R.3d 974]. Thereafter, he told Stratton that about 10 a.m., on the day of the\n\nBocanegra murders, he met Joey Bocanegra on the street and spoke to him for a\n\nfew minutes before Joey walked home. Defendant then walked by the Bocanegra\n\nhouse and observed Joey leaving the home. At that point, the interview with\n\nStratton ended.\n\nOne week later, Stratton again spoke to defendant. At this point, defendant asked\n\nStratton a series of hypothetical questions, including: \u201cWhat if I was present in the\n\nhouse; what if Joey hit his dad after his dad had refused to give him some money;\n\nand what if Joey's dad hit him back and what if Joey got real mad and grabbed a\n\nknife and started stabbing his dad; what if Joey's mother didn't know what was\n\nhappening because she was in another room?\u201d\n\nc. Statements Made to Homicide Detective Boggs\n\nOn March 27, 1987, after waiving his Miranda rights, defendant was interviewed\n\nabout the Tatman murder by Homicide Detective Boggs. Defendant had already\n\nbeen arrested for the Bocanegra murders and agreed to talk to the officer because\n\nhe believed he could be spending the rest of his life in prison.\n\nBoggs testified that defendant told him he wanted to rob Tatman of his\n\nrefrigerator because he needed one. Defendant told Boggs that, because he was so\n\nintoxicated (from ingesting alcohol and drugs) at the time of the robbery, he could\n\nnot remember the sequence of events.\n\nAccording to Boggs, defendant asked Reyes to pry open Tatman's bathroom\n\nwindow with Reyes's screwdriver. Once inside, Reyes removed the contents of\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 7 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n8\n\nTatman's refrigerator, and defendant moved it to a room next door that had been\n\nrented by Vicky Ornalez, a friend of the perpetrators.\n\nDefendant told Boggs that when he returned to Tatman's room, Tatman was\n\nawake and Reyes was standing over him with a screwdriver in his hand.\n\nDefendant claimed he had no idea why Reyes was acting this way because both\n\nmen had discussed trying not to awaken Tatman while they removed his property.\n\nReyes then hit Tatman in the chest, pulled Tatman off the bed and onto the floor,\n\nand made multiple lunging movements downward with the screwdriver in his\n\nhand. Defendant asserted that the bed partially blocked his view, but he\n\nnonetheless believed Reyes was stabbing Tatman. After Reyes completed the\n\nmurder, both defendant and Reyes returned to Vickie Ornalez's room.\n\nd. Defendant's Post-Arrest Comments to Michael Trihey\n\nMichael Trihey was a reporter for the Bakersfield Californian. Prior to trial, he\n\ninterviewed defendant five times about the charges pending against him. On April\n\n25, 1988, the paper published a Trihey article entitled, Accused Asks for Own\n\nDeath, System Says No. According to Trihey, defendant told him that he was a\n\n\u201ctriple murderer\u201d and that the Bocanegras and Tatman were killed for their Social\n\nSecurity checks.\n\nB. Penalty Phase Evidence\n\nThe prosecution introduced evidence of defendant's criminal activity involving\n\nthe use or attempted use of force or violence. (\u00a7 190.3, factor (b).) On May 7,\n\n1982, defendant assaulted store owner Hassan Ahmad Ammarie after defendant\n\n\n\nasked Ammarie to \u201cget him some bacon\u201d and Ammarie refused. Defendant\n\nstabbed Ammarie in the left shoulder and neck. Ammarie was hospitalized for\n\ntwo weeks following the attack.\n\nOn June 2, 1982, defendant attacked an acquaintance, Arthur Melendez Pena,\n\nafter Pena refused to comply with defendant's demand for money.\n\nSeveral witnesses who had testified at the preliminary hearing also testified at the\n\npenalty phase. Homicide Detective Boggs testified defendant had told him that\n\nafter removing Tatman's possessions to Ornalez's room, he and Reyes \u201ckicked\n\nback, drank some whiskey, smoked some dope, ate some food and just relaxed for\n\nthe rest of the evening.\u201d Informant Rufus Hernandez and Police Detective Stratton\n\nalso testified that defendant told Hernandez that he took an active role in the\n\nBocanegra and Tatman slayings-including beating Juan and Juanita Bocanegra,\n\nand beating and assisting Reyes in stabbing Tatman. Stratton repeated\n\nHernandez's statements to him that defendant and Joey Bocanegra went to Juan\n\nand Juanita's house and planned to rob them and that Tatman was robbed for his\n\nSocial Security check. Rose McGrew, the Bakersfield Inn maid, repeated her guilt\n\nphase testimony about how she discovered Tatman's body.\n\nWith regard to the Bocanegra murders, Hernandez testified that defendant entered\n\nthe house with a bar and \u201cran up to Joey's father and grabbed him and held him\n\nthere until Joey went and got the knife and they just beat him and stabbed him.\u201d\n\nWhen Juanita walked out of her sewing room, defendant \u201crushed\u201d her: \u201cThat's\n\nwhen they both started killing her.... They just stabbed her numerous times and hit\n\nher in the head a few times with the bar, and the time, at the same time of doing\n\nthat I guess Joey somehow managed to get her back inside the room, I guess,\n\nwhile he was hitting her....\u201d The prosecution also introduced six color\n\nphotographs of the victims and forty-eight other color photographs of the\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 8 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n9\n\nBocanegra and Tatman crime scenes. Criminalist Greg Laskowski testified that\n\nthe blood splatter in the hallway of the Bocanegra house was consistent with the\n\nprosecution's theory that multiple stabbings occurred there.\n\nDefendant's penalty phase evidence consisted of testimony by friends, relatives,\n\nand a social anthropologist to the effect that defendant's dysfunctional and\n\npoverty-stricken, migratory family life severely hampered his ability to live a\n\nproductive life. Defendant was rejected by his mother following his birth and was\n\nsent to live with his grandparents. When he was three years old, defendant's\n\nmother and stepfather unexpectedly wrenched defendant from his grandparents'\n\nhome to move to Arkansas. Shortly thereafter, defendant's mother left defendant's\n\nstepfather, and took defendant and his half-brother to California. Defendant's\n\nmother remarried a man with three children, and the couple thereafter had five\n\nadditional children.\n\nDefendant's mother and his stepfather were alcoholics and drug abusers who were\n\nviolent with each other and the children. His grandparents, who were often in\n\ncharge of defendant, also drank heavily and abused drugs. Both defendant's\n\nmother and stepfather died in their middle 30's of acute alcoholism. Defendant\n\ntried to take care of his siblings, but took drugs to escape his difficult life. He\n\neventually turned to crime because he had no marketable job skills to prepare him\n\nfor life as an adult.\n\nPenalty phase defense counsel Gary Frank attempted to persuade the jury that\n\ndefendant should receive a sentence of life without the possibility of parole and\n\n\u201cspend the remainder of his life in prison.\u201d\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th 1, 17-23 (1995).\n\nIII.\n\nJURISDICTION\n\nRelief by way of a petition for writ of habeas corpus extends to a person in custody\n\npursuant to the judgment of a state court if the custody is in violation of the Constitution or laws\n\n\n\nor treaties of the United States. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(3); Williams v.\n\nTaylor, 529 U.S. 362, 375 (2000).

Legal Standard - Habeas Corpus\n\nUnder the AEDPA, relitigation of any claim adjudicated on the merits in state court is\n\nbarred unless a petitioner can show that the state court\u2019s adjudication of his claim:\n\n(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable\n\napplication of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n\nCourt of the United States; or\n\n(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the\n\nfacts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\n\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 98 (2011); Lockyer, 538 U.S. at 70-71;\n\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 413.\n\nAs a threshold matter, this Court must \u201cfirst decide what constitutes \u2018clearly established\n\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u2019\u201d Lockyer, 538 U.S. at\n\n71 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)). In ascertaining what is \u201cclearly established Federal law,\u201d\n\nthis Court must look to the \u201choldings, as opposed to the dicta, of [the Supreme Court's] decisions\n\nas of the time of the relevant state-court decision.\u201d Williams, 529 U.S. at 412. \u201cIn other words,\n\n\u2018clearly established Federal law\u2019 under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) is the governing legal principle or principles\n\nset forth by the Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its decision.\u201d Id. In addition,\n\nthe Supreme Court decision must \u201c\u2018squarely address [] the issue in th[e] case\u2019; otherwise, there is\n\nno clearly established Federal law for purposes of review under AEDPA.\u201d Moses v. Payne, 555\n\nF.3d 742, 754 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Wright v. Van Patten, 552 U.S. 120, 125 (2008)); see also\n\nPanetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, 949 (2007); Carey v. Musladin, 549 U.S. 70, 74 (2006). If\n\nno clearly established Federal law exists, the inquiry is at an end and the Court must defer to the\n\nstate court\u2019s decision. Carey, 549 U.S. 70; Wright, 552 U.S. at 126; Moses, 555 F.3d at 760. In\n\naddition, the Supreme Court has recently clarified that habeas relief is unavailable in instances\n\nwhere a state court arguably refuses to extend a governing legal principle to a context in which\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 10 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n11\n\nthe principle should have controlled. White v. Woodall, --- U.S. ---, 134 S. Ct. 1697, 1706\n\n(2014). The Supreme Court stated: \u201c\u2018[I]f a habeas court must extend a rationale before it can\n\napply to the facts at hand,\u2019 then by definition the rationale was not \u2018clearly established at the time\n\nof the state-court decision.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652, 666 (2004)).\n\nIf the Court determines there is governing clearly established Federal law, the Court must\n\nthen consider whether the state court's decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable\n\napplication of,\u201d [the] clearly established Federal law.\u201d Lockyer, 538 U.S. at 72 (quoting 28\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)). \u201cUnder the \u2018contrary to\u2019 clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ\n\nif the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme] Court on a\n\nquestion of law or if the state court decides a case differently than [the] Court has on a set of\n\nmaterially indistinguishable facts.\u201d Williams, 529 U.S. at 412-13; see also Lockyer, 538 U.S. at\n\n72. \u201cThe word \u2018contrary\u2019 is commonly understood to mean \u2018diametrically different,\u2019 \u2018opposite\n\nin character or nature,\u2019 or \u2018mutually opposed.\u2019\u201d Williams, 529 U.S. at 405 (quoting Webster's\n\nThird New International Dictionary 495 (1976)). \u201cA state-court decision will certainly be\n\ncontrary to [Supreme Court] clearly established precedent if the state court applies a rule that\n\ncontradicts the governing law set forth in [Supreme Court] cases.\u201d Id.\n\n\u201cUnder the \u2018reasonable application clause,\u2019 a federal habeas court may grant the writ if\n\nthe state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the] Court\u2019s decisions but\n\n\n\nunreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d Williams, 529 U.S. at\n\n413. \u201c[A] federal court may not issue the writ simply because the court concludes in its\n\nindependent judgment that the relevant state court decision applied clearly established federal\n\nlaw erroneously or incorrectly. Rather, that application must also be unreasonable.\u201d Id. at 411;\n\nsee also Lockyer, 538 U.S. at 75-76. \u201cA state court's determination that a claim lacks merit\n\nprecludes federal habeas relief so long as fair-minded jurists could disagree on the correctness of\n\nthe state court's decision.\u201d Richter, 562 U.S. at 101, citing Yarborough, 541 U.S. at 664. The\n\nSupreme Court stated:\n\nAs a condition for obtaining habeas corpus from a federal court, a state prisoner\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 11 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n12\n\n\n\nmust show that the state court's ruling on the claim being presented in federal\n\ncourt was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and\n\ncomprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fair-minded\n\ndisagreement.\n\nId. at 103. In other words, so long as fair-minded jurists could disagree on the correctness of the\n\nstate courts decision, the decision cannot be considered unreasonable. Id. at 101. In applying\n\nthis standard, \u201ca habeas court must determine what arguments or theories supported . . . or could\n\nhave supported the state court\u2019s decision; and then it must ask whether it is possible fair-minded\n\njurists could disagree that those arguments or theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior\n\ndecision of [the Supreme Court].\u201d Id. at 102. This objective standard of reasonableness applies\n\nto review under both subsections of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). See Hibbler v. Benedetti, 693 F.3d\n\n1140, 1146-47 (9th Cir. 2012). If the Court determines that the state court decision is objectively\n\nunreasonable, and the error is not structural, habeas relief is nonetheless unavailable unless the\n\nerror had a substantial and injurious effect on the verdict. Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619,\n\n637 (1993).\n\nPetitioner has the burden of establishing that the decision of the state court is contrary to\n\nor involved an unreasonable application of United States Supreme Court precedent. Baylor v.\n\nEstelle, 94 F.3d 1321, 1325 (9th Cir. 1996). Although only Supreme Court law is binding on the\n\nstates, Ninth Circuit precedent remains relevant persuasive authority in determining whether a\n\nstate court decision is objectively unreasonable. See LaJoie v. Thompson, 217 F.3d 663, 669 n.6\n\n(9th Cir. 2000); Duhaime v. Ducharme, 200 F.3d 597, 600-01 (9th Cir. 1999).\n\nThe AEDPA requires considerable deference to the state courts. \u201c[R]eview under \u00a7\n\n2254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on\n\nthe merits,\u201d and \u201cevidence introduced in federal court has no bearing on 2254(d)(1) review.\u201d\n\nCullen v. Pinholster, __ U.S. __, __, 131 S.

Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 340 (2003) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1)). However, a\n\nstate court factual finding is not entitled to deference if the relevant state court record is\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 12 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n13\n\nunavailable for the federal court to review. Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 319 (1963),\n\noverruled by Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U.S. 1 (1992).\n\nIf a petitioner satisfies either subsection (1) or (2) for a claim, then the federal court\n\nconsiders that claim de novo. See Panetti, 551 U.S. at 953 (when section 2254(d) is satisfied,\n\n\u201c[a] federal court must then resolve the claim without the deference AEDPA otherwise\n\nrequires.\u201d); Frantz v. Hazey, 533 F.3d 724, 737 (9th Cir. 2008).\n\nIn this case, many of Petitioner\u2019s claims were raised and rejected by the California\n\nSupreme Court on direct appeal. However, many of his claims were raised in his state habeas\n\npetition to the California Supreme Court, and summarily denied on the merits. In such a case\n\nwhere the state court decision is unaccompanied by an explanation, \u201cthe habeas petitioner\u2019s\n\nburden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis for the state court to deny\n\nrelief.\u201d Richter, 562 U.S. at 98. The Supreme Court stated that \u201ca habeas court must determine\n\nwhat arguments or theories supported or . . . could have supported, the state court\u2019s decision; and\n\nthen it must ask whether it is possible fair-minded jurists could disagree that those arguments or\n\ntheories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this Court.\u201d Id. at 786 (emphasis\n\n\n\nadded). Petitioner bears \u201cthe burden to demonstrate that \u2018there was no reasonable basis for the\n\nstate court to deny relief.\u2019\u201d Walker v. Martel, 709 F.3d 925, 939 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting\n\nRichter, 562 U.S. at 98). \u201cCrucially, this is not a de novo review of the constitutional question,\u201d\n\nid., as \u201ceven a strong case for relief does not mean the state court's contrary conclusion was\n\nunreasonable,\u201d Id. (quoting Richter, 562 U.S. at 102); (see also Murray v. Schriro, 745 F.3d 984,\n\n996-97, (9th Cir. 2014)).\n\nWhen reviewing the California Supreme Court's summary denial of a petition, this Court\n\nmust consider that the California Supreme Court's summary denial of a habeas petition on the\n\nmerits reflects that court's determination that:\n\n[T]he claims made in th[e] petition do not state a prima facie case entitling the\n\npetitioner to relief. It appears that the court generally assumes the allegations in\n\nthe petition to be true, but does not accept wholly conclusory allegations, and will\n\nalso review the record of the trial ... to assess the merits of the petitioner's claims.\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 13 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n14\n\nPinholster, 131 S.

Accordingly, if this Court finds Petitioner has unarguably\n\npresented a prima facie case for relief on a claim, the state court's summary rejection of that\n\nclaim would be unreasonable. Taylor v.

In addition, some of his claims were denied as procedurally barred. As to those\n\nclaims, Respondent has argued that California\u2019s timeliness rule for state habeas petitions,\n\nCalifornia\u2019s rule barring claims on state habeas that could have been presented on direct appeal,\n\nand California\u2019s contemporaneous objection rule are all adequate and independent state grounds\n\nthat bar federal habeas review. The Court will not address procedural default with this order\n\nbecause all of the claims lack merit, and the Court finds the question of procedural default to be\n\nrelatively complicated in this case. See Franklin v. Johnson, 290 F.3d 1223, 1232 (9th Cir. 2002)\n\n(Courts may reach the merits of a case prior to addressing procedural default); Bell v.

Sufficiency of the Evidence - Claims 1\n\n3\n\nand 3\n\n4\n\nIn claims 1 and 3, Petitioner states that he was convicted and sentenced for the first\n\ndegree murders of Mr. Bocanegra and Mrs. Bocanegra on insufficient evidence that he acted\n\nwith deliberation and premeditation, see People v. Anderson, 70 Cal.2d 15, 26-27 (1968),\n\ndepriving him of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\na. Clearly Established Law\n\nA federal habeas court reviews challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence by\n\ndetermining whether in \u201cviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any\n\nrational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\u201d Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U.S. 764, 781 (1990). \u201cA reviewing court must consider all of the\n\nevidence admitted by the trial court, regardless whether that evidence was admitted erroneously.\u201d\n\nMcDaniel v. Brown, 558 U.S. 120, 131 (2010). Sufficiency of the evidence claims raised in \u00a7\n\n\n\n2254 proceedings must be measured with reference to substantive requirements as defined by\n\nstate law. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 324 n.16 (1979). In cases where the evidence is\n\nunclear or would support conflicting inferences, the federal court \u201cmust presume -- even if it\n\ndoes not affirmatively appear in the record -- that the trier of fact resolved any such conflict in\n\nfavor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolution.\u201d Id. at 326. To prevail here,\n\nPetitioner must show \u201cthat the prosecution\u2019s case against him \u201cwas so lacking that the trial court\n\nshould have entered a judgment of acquittal.\u201d McDaniel, 558 U.S. at 131.\n\nThe AEDPA adds another layer of deference over the already deferential Jackson\n\nstandard. Under the AEDPA, the federal court may not grant a habeas petition unless it finds that\n\nthe state court unreasonably applied the principles underlying the Jackson standard when\n\nreviewing the petitioner\u2019s claim. See e.g., Juan H. v. Allen, 408 F.3d 1262, 1275 n.12 (9th Cir.\n\n2005); Jones v.

Borg, 982 F.2d 335, 338 (9th Cir. 1992).\n\nb. Review of Claims 1 and 3\n\nThe state supreme court, on direct appeal, considered claimed insufficiency of the\n\nevidence and rejected Petitioner\u2019s claim of \u201cwading into [the] fight\u201d and being ineffectual in the\n\nassaults; finding instead that the evidence clearly reflects that defendant aided and abetted Joey\n\nin killing both Mr. Bocanegra and Mrs. Bocanegra, as follows:\n\n[S]ubstantial evidence supports the trial court's finding that Joey Bocanegra\n\nintended to kill his parents, that he premeditated and deliberated the murders, and\n\nthat defendant can be found vicariously liable for the murders as an aider and\n\nabettor. As we have observed, an aider and abettor must act with knowledge of\n\nthe criminal purpose of the perpetrator and with an intent either of committing, or\n\nof encouraging or facilitating commission of, the offense. [Citation] We have also\n\nrecognized that if the aider and abettor undertakes acts \u201cwith the intent that the\n\nactual perpetrator's purpose be facilitated thereby, he is a principal and liable for\n\nthe commission of the offense.\u201d [Citation] Thus, the basis of liability for the\n\nperpetrator applies to the aider and abettor and extends to \u201cthe natural and\n\nreasonable consequences of the acts he knowingly and intelligently aids and\n\nencourages.\u201d [Citation] As we explain, we conclude that defendant shared Joey's\n\nintent to kill, and in assisting Joey in committing the crimes, understood, and\n\nfacilitated, the full extent of Joey's criminal purpose.\n\nHernandez testified, and defendant admitted to Detective Stratton, that defendant\n\ninitially waited outside while Joey entered his parents' house. Defendant then\n\nentered the house after hearing the sounds of a fight between Joey and Juan.\n\nDefendant told Hernandez that he went inside the house to break up the fight\n\nbetween Joey and his father, but the facts belie his stated intent. When defendant\n\nentered the house, he saw Joey fighting with his father. Rather than come to\n\n\n\nJuan's aid, defendant grabbed a curved metal bar and commenced beating Juan.\n\nJoey's actions, according to defendant's statements to prosecution witnesses,\n\nindicated that Joey deliberated over his father's killing. Joey initially struck Juan\n\nin the hallway and then, in the kitchen, obtained a knife that he used to stab Juan.\n\nIn our view, Joey formed a clear intent to kill, at the latest, during the altercation\n\nwith his father, and obtained a kitchen knife to carry out that plan. Our cases hold\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 16 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n17\n\nthat planning activity occurring over a short period of time is sufficient to find\n\npremeditation. \u201c\u2018The true test is not the duration of time as much as it is the extent\n\nof the reflection. Thoughts may follow each other with great rapidity and cold,\n\ncalculated judgment may be arrived at quickly ....'\u201d [Citation]\n\nThere was also ample evidence of motive. The evidence supports a strong\n\ninference that Joey entered his parents' house to rob them. When his father\n\n\n\nresisted the robbery, Joey was motivated to murder him in order to gain access to\n\nboth money and tangible goods, including a television set. Substantial evidence\n\nsupports a finding that Joey believed Juan stood in the way of his plan.\n\nFinally, the trial court could infer from the evidence that the manner of killing\n\ntended to demonstrate Joey acted with premeditation and deliberation. The attack\n\noccurred in a series of rooms, indicating that Juan's repeated attempts to break\n\naway from his murderers were consistently thwarted by the attackers' relentless\n\npursuit of him, even after he was gravely wounded. A rational finder of fact could\n\ninfer that the manner of killing, when combined with Joey's retrieval of the knife\n\nin the kitchen, and defendant's retrieval of a metal bar used in clubbing a\n\ndefenseless Juan, is sufficient to support the trier of fact's implied finding that\n\nJoey formed the plan to kill his parents during the altercation, located the murder\n\nweapon, and along with defendant, deliberately murdered his father. [Citation]\n\nThe same evidence supports the trial court's finding that defendant shared Joey's\n\nintent and plan to kill Juan, and thus was liable, as an aider and abettor, for Juan's\n\nmurder. [Citation] The killing of Juan ended after a prolonged knife attack and\n\nbeating from which Juan attempted to defend himself. Defendant's personal\n\ninvolvement in the murder was substantial. Far from merely acting as a lookout,\n\nor beating Juan after he was already dead, defendant was actively involved in\n\nassisting Joey in Juan's murder. Defendant's admitted act of arming himself with a\n\ncurved metal bar before joining the altercation between Joey and Juan indicates he\n\nshared Joey's plan. [Citation] From this evidence, the trier of fact could\n\nreasonably infer defendant knowingly engaged or assisted in Juan's murder as an\n\naider and abettor. [Citation]\n\nAs to Juanita's murder, defendant asserts the evidence similarly does not support\n\nthe conviction. He claims that he \u201cdid not personally kill Juanita [because] she\n\nwas stabbed to death by Joey.\u201d He asserts that there is \u201cno evidence in the record\n\nthat [he] held Juanita down, helped push her back to the sewing room, or had any\n\ncontact with her while Joey was stabbing her.\u201d He contends that there is no\n\nevidence to support the People's theory that defendant aided Joey by hitting\n\nJuanita with a bar and that \u201c[t]here is simply no evidence that [his] initial\n\ngrabbing of Juanita actually aided, or even was intended to aid, Joey's subsequent\n\nstabbing of his mother.\u201d Finally, defendant asserts in his reply brief that his\n\n\u201cefforts to tie and gag Juanita are altogether inconsistent with an intent to kill\n\nher.\u201d\n\nAgain, the evidence supports the court's verdicts and refutes defendant's\n\ncontention. Hernandez testified defendant told him that during the murder of Juan,\n\nJuanita screamed. Defendant grabbed Juanita and told Joey to \u201cshut her up.\u201d Joey\n\nthen stabbed his mother 26 times. A bloodstained garment was wrapped around\n\nJuanita's neck, and her wrists had been tied together with a piece of fabric. The\n\n\n\npathologist (Holloway) opined that Juanita died of the stab wounds and that the\n\nligature constriction of her neck was a possible contributing cause. She also had\n\nsevere scalp injuries that Holloway concluded were consistent with those inflicted\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 17 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n18\n\nby a long bar or pipe less than one-half inch in diameter, similar to the instrument\n\nused by defendant to inflict Juan's scalp wounds. The trial court could reasonably\n\ninfer from the evidence that Juanita was killed in order to keep her from being a\n\npercipient witness to the murder of her husband. Thus, viewing the evidence in\n\nthe light most favorable to the People, we conclude a \u201crational trier of fact\u201d could\n\nhave been persuaded \u201cthat the killing was the result of preexisting reflection and\n\nweighing of considerations rather than mere unconsidered or rash impulse.\u201d\n\n[Citation] Defendant's participation in Juanita's murder, like his aiding and\n\n\n\nabetting in Juan's killing, clearly supports a finding that defendant aided and\n\nabetted her murder.

But the extended nature and duration of the\n\nstruggles with Mr. Bocanegra and Mrs. Bocanegra, with Joey taking time to get a kitchen knife\n\n(CT 504; RT 2854), and Petitioner attempting to subdue and restrain each of the victims during\n\nJoey\u2019s assault on them, seeing Joey stab them, along with the multiple stab and blunt force\n\nwounds inflicted during room to room struggle with the victims, could reasonably suggest a plan\n\nto kill them. (CT112-120; 149-153; 181; 192-194; 357-383; 479-483; 488.) Each victim suffered\n\nmultiple stab wounds, Mrs. Bocanegra was stabbed at least 26 times and had 6 scalp wounds and\n\nMr. Bocanegra was stabbed at least eight times and had nine scalp wounds. (Id.) Both victims\n\nwere left unassisted to bleed to death. (CT 112-114, 117-119.) There was evidence Mrs.\n\nBocanegra\u2019s wrists had been tied together and that she had been gagged. (CT 113, 149-150,\n\n153.) Jailhouse informant Hernandez consistently testified Petitioner told him that when\n\nfighting broke out between Joey and Mr. Bocanegra (CT 479-505), in the hallway (id.; RT 2843,\n\n2852-2853), Petitioner responded by hitting Mr. Bocanegra on the head nine times with a curved\n\nbar (CT 479-505; CT 112-114; 117-119), that when Mrs. Bocanegra came out of a back bedroom\n\nand started yelling Petitioner grabbed her and told Joey to \u201cshut her up.\u201d (CT 483, 488, 504.)\n\nPetitioner\u2019s claim that it was Joey who stabbed his parents to death (CT 488; RT 121-122), does\n\nnot undermine evidence above that Petitioner aided and abetted Joey to that end.\n\nThe physical evidence is consistent with Hernandez\u2019s testimony. The evidentiary record\n\nreasonably suggests that Mr. Bocanegra was initially assaulted in the hallway and then murdered\n\nin the kitchen (CT 355-381). The coroner, Dr. Holloway, opined Mr. Bocanegra died from\n\nmultiple stab wounds and that other conditions were the multiple blunt force trauma wounds to\n\nMr. Bocanegra\u2019s head (CT 117-119); that Mrs. Bocanegra died from multiple stab wounds and\n\nhad six wounds to her scalp (CT 112-115;, 153-154); that the scalp wounds were caused by an\n\ninstrument different from that used to inflict the stab wounds; and that ligature construction was\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 19 of 213\n\n1\n\n\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n20\n\na possible contributing cause. (CT 112-119.)\n\nBoth at the preliminary hearing and the penalty phase, Hernandez testified that Petitioner\n\nstruck Mr. Bocanegra with a bar (CT 479-482, 500-501, RT 2843-2844, 2854), and that he\n\ngrabbed or \u201crushed\u201d Mrs. Bocanegra, a witness to Mr. Bocanegra\u2019s murder (id.; RT 153, 189)\n\nand told Joey to \u201cshut her up\u201d (CT 483, 504; RT 2844). Hernandez testimony that the altercation\n\nbetween Mr. Bocanegra and Joey started in the hallway and moved to the kitchen is consistent\n\nwith the bloodstain pattern evidence, (CT 355-383; 479, 487-488, 500-501; RT 2843-2845) and\n\nother crime scene evidence. (Id.) Petitioner\u2019s claim that a third person, Robert Reyes (\u201cReyes\u201d),\n\nwas in the house during the murders and may have aided Joey in the murders, is not substantially\n\nsupported by the evidentiary record. (Id.; CT 131-133)\n\nPetitioner attempts to discount testimony that he intended to rob the Bocanegras prior to\n\ntheir murder. Petitioner correctly notes that the trial court did not find him guilty of robbing the\n\nBocanegras and found the robbery-murder special circumstance untrue on grounds Petitioner\u2019s\n\n\n\nintent to rob arose after the murders. (CT 906; RT 235-237.) Even so, Petitioner has not\n\ncontroverted evidence that he used a metal bar during the murders. (CT 479-482, 500-501, RT\n\n2843-2844, 2854RT 236). The trial court rejected Hernandez testimony, favorable to Petitioner,\n\nthat Petitioner merely grabbed Mrs. Bocanegra. (CT 483.)\n\nNo facts or discrepancies between the testimony and the physical evidence establish or\n\ncompel the conclusion that Hernandez, by virtue of his alleged substance addiction, his plea deal,\n\nor otherwise, was motivated to and did testify falsely or inaccurately. For reasons discussed in\n\nclaim 7, the state court could reasonably have found Hernandez received no undisclosed sentence\n\nconcession in return for his testimony. (State Habeas Corpus Petition, hereinafter \u201cSHCP\u201d, Ex.\n\n900, pp. 4, 11; State Court Response to Petition, hereinafter \u201cSResp.\u201d, Ex.

Clearly Established Law\n\ni. Actual Innocence\n\nThe showing required for a free standing claim of actual innocence, i.e., a claim\n\nirrespective of constitutional error at trial or sentencing, is \u201cextraordinarily high\u201d and must be\n\n\u201ctruly persuasive.\u201d Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390, 417, (1993). To carry this burden\n\nPetitioner must affirmatively prove he is innocent. See Carriger v.

Delo, 513 U.S. 298 (1995) the Supreme Court reached actual innocence as a\n\ngateway claim to consideration of otherwise barred Constitutional claims. \u201cIf a habeas petitioner\n\n. . . presents evidence of innocence so strong that a court cannot have confidence in the outcome\n\nof the trial unless the court is also satisfied that the trial was free of non-harmless constitutional\n\nerror, the petitioner should be allowed to pass through the gateway and argue the merits of his\n\nunderlying claims.\u201d Schlup at 316. The Schlup court held that the proper standard is that a\n\nprocedurally defaulted petitioner must show that a constitutional violation has probably resulted\n\nin the conviction of one who is actually innocent. Schlup at 326.\n\n\u201cThe petitioner must show that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would\n\nhave convicted him in the light of the new evidence.\u201d Schlup at 327. Petitioner\u2019s burden is to\n\ndemonstrate that more likely than not, any reasonable juror would have reasonable doubt. House\n\nv. Bell, 547 U.S. 518, 538 (2006). See Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U.S. 333, 346 (1992) (holding\n\nthat in order to prove actual innocence, petitioner must show fair probability that rational trier of\n\nfact would have entertained reasonable doubt regarding the existence of facts which are\n\nprerequisites under state or federal law for imposition of the death penalty).\n\nii. State Law Aider/Abettor\n\n\n\nCalifornia law requires an aider and abettor to share the specific intent of the perpetrator.\n\nBeeman, 35 Cal.3d at 560. An aider and abettor shares the perpetrator\u2019s specific intent by\n\nknowing the full extent of the perpetrator\u2019s criminal purpose and giving aid or encouragement\n\nwith the intent or purpose of facilitating the commission of the crime. Id. California\u2019s 1978\n\ndeath penalty statute requires finding an independent intent to kill as part of the special\n\ncircumstance for an aider or abettor of felony-murder. People v. Anderson, 43 Cal. 3d 1104,\n\n1141-42 (1987). This is consistent with the Eighth Amendment which prohibits the death\n\npenalty for an aider and abettor of felony murder who does not actually kill, attempt to kill,\n\nintend that a killing or lethal force occur, or act with reckless indifference to human life.\n\nEnmund v.

To the extent these claims are free\n\nstanding claims based on alleged newly discovered evidence, the claims not cognizable (see\n\nHerrera, 506 U.S. at 400) (the Supreme Court held that free standing claims of \u201cactual innocence\n\nbased on newly discovered evidence have never been held to state a ground for federal habeas\n\nrelief absent an independent constitutional violation occurring in the underlying state criminal\n\nproceeding.\u201d).\n\nThe actual innocence claims also fail as gateway claims because it is not likely any\n\nreasonable juror would have reasonable doubt that the essential elements of the criminal counts\n\ncould have been found beyond a reasonable doubt. Petitioner\u2019s statements to jailhouse informant\n\nHernandez, Detective Stratton and reporter Trihey, and the physical evidence in the Bocanegra\n\nhome all are substantial evidence of his guilt.\n\nHernandez\u2019s testimony at both preliminary hearing and penalty phase that the altercation\n\nbetween Mr. Bocanegra and Joey started in the hallway and moved to the kitchen is consistent\n\nwith the bloodstain evidence. (CT 355-383; 479, 487-488, 500-501; RT 2843-2845) and other\n\ncrime scene evidence. (CT 355-380.) His preliminary hearing testimony that Petitioner heard\n\nJoey and Mr. Bocanegra arguing, \u201cwalked into the house, tried to break \u2018em up\u201d (CT 479) and\n\nthat he (Petitioner) hit Mr. Bocanegra with the bar is not materially inconsistent with\n\nHernandez\u2019s penalty phase testimony that Petitioner grabbed and held Mr. Bocanegra until Joey\n\ngot the knife and that Petitioner beat Mr. Bocanegra with a bar.\n\nHernandez testimony at the preliminary hearing and the penalty phase was consistent that\n\nduring Joey\u2019s struggles with Mr. Bocanegra, Petitioner struck Mr. Bocanegra with a bar (CT\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 23 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n24\n\n479-482, 500-501, RT 2843-2844, 2854), and that he grabbed or \u201crushed\u201d Mrs. Bocanegra and\n\ntold Joey to \u201cshut her up\u201d during his struggles with Mrs. Bocanegra (CT 483, 504; RT 2844).\n\nPetitioner saw Joey wield a knife during these assaults. (CT 483, 487-489, 504; SPet. Ex. 419, 5,\n\n17; RT 121-122.) Mr. Bocanegra and Mrs. Bocanegra succumbed to the multiple stab wounds.\n\n(CT 112-119.)\n\nAs to the Tatman homicide, Hernandez\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony that Petitioner\n\nand Joey \u201chit a black guy in an alley\u201d (CT 488, 497-99) is not, as Petitioner alleges, inconsistent\n\nwith penalty phase testimony that Petitioner and two other men entered Mr. Tatman\u2019s room at\n\nthe Bakersfield Inn, and beat him, and the other two stabbed Mr. Tatman with a screwdriver, and\n\nthat they took Mr. Tatman\u2019s money. There is no evidence Hernandez\u2019s testimony at the\n\npreliminary hearing related to the same incident he testified to at the penalty phase.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s assertion that there were actually 3 non-victim shoeprints in the kitchen\n\nwhere Mr. Bocanegra was murdered, so as to implicate Reyes in the Bocanegra murders is not\n\nsufficiently supported in the record. As discussed in claims 8 and 10, post, the state court could\n\nreasonably have found that the bloodstain evidence and testimony of Hernandez contradicts\n\njailhouse informant Seeley\u2019s account that Petitioner observed Mr. Bocanegra\u2019s murder from the\n\nhallway.\n\nNo facts or discrepancies between the testimony and the physical evidence establish or\n\ncompel the conclusion that Hernandez, by virtue of his alleged substance addiction, his plea deal,\n\nor otherwise, was motivated to and did testify falsely or inaccurately. (See claim 7, ante.)\n\nPetitioner has not demonstrated Hernandez received undisclosed sentence concession(s). (SPet.\n\n\n\nEx. 900, pp. 4, 11; SResp. Ex. B.)\n\nIn contrast, the testimony of jailhouse informant Seeley inculpating Reyes in the murders,\n\nis inconsistent with the physical evidence. Seeley\u2019s testimony that the altercation with Mr.\n\nBocanegra started and ended in the kitchen (SPet. Ex. 419, pp.5-6, 17-20) is not reasonably\n\nconsistent with the blood stain patterns that suggest the assault on Mr. Bocanegra began in the\n\nhallway.

But as explained in claim 6, there is no\n\nsufficient evidence that Petitioner suffered from neurological or psychiatric impairment\n\n\n\nprecluding, as an aider and abettor, his knowingly and intentionally assisting Joey in the\n\nBocanegra murders.\n\nFinally, Petitioner\u2019s assertion that he merely restrained Mrs. Bocanegra is nonetheless\n\nsufficient to support a first degree murder conviction as an aider and abettor, especially given\n\nthat Petitioner had just observed Joey stab his father to death. (CT 483; RT 2843-2854.) It could\n\nreasonably be concluded that Petitioner\u2019s restraining Mrs. Bocanegra just after Mr. Bocanegra\u2019s\n\nmurder satisfied the requirement that an aider or abettor knows the full extent of the perpetrator\u2019s\n\ncriminal purpose and gives aid to facilitate the commission of the crime. Beeman, 35 Cal. 3d at\n\n560.\n\nFor the reasons stated, a fair-minded jurist could conclude it unlikely any reasonable juror\n\nwould have reasonable doubt that the essential elements of the criminal counts against Petitioner\n\ncould have been found beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe California Supreme Court\u2019s denial of these claims was not contrary to, or an\n\nunreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, or based on an unreasonable\n\ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding. See 28\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nClaims 2 and 4 are denied.\n\n3. State Appellate Error - Claim 5\n\nIn this claim Petitioner alleges that the California Supreme Court committed appellate\n\nreview error by making an unconstitutional change in the definition of first degree murder (Cal.\n\nPen. Code 189) violating the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 25 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n26\n\na. Clearly Established Law\n\nA defendant has a due process right to fair notice of the elements of the crime for which\n\nhe was convicted. Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, 352 (1964).\n\nA state\u2019s capital punishment scheme must \u201cminimize the risk of wholly arbitrary and\n\ncapricious action.\u201d Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 189 (1976).\n\nAbsent specific constitutional error, federal habeas review is limited to determining\n\nwhether the state supreme court\u2019s statutory review was \u201cso arbitrary and capricious as to\n\nconstitute an independent due process or Eighth Amendment violation.\u201d Lewis v.

DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 642-43 (1974) (absent a\n\nspecific constitutional violation, federal habeas review of trial error is limited to whether the\n\nerror \u201cso infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due\n\nprocess). The essential function of state appellate court jurisdiction is to ensure \u201cevenhanded,\n\nrational, and consistent imposition of death sentences under law.\u201d Campbell v.

Review of Claim 5\n\nPetitioner contends that the state supreme court retroactively eliminated the distinction\n\nbetween intentional first and second degree murders. He reasons this is so because, prior to his\n\nappeal, California law required that premeditated and deliberated first degree murder be shown\n\nto be the \u201cresult of careful thought and weighing of considerations,\u201d and that conversely \u201ca\n\nsudden killing in the course of an argument and struggle\u201d would not be premeditated and\n\ndeliberated murder. See People v. Lasko, 23 Cal.4th 101, 104 (2000); see Anderson, 70 Cal. 2d\n\nat 26-27 (stating types of evidence which might support a finding of premeditation and\n\ndeliberation). Yet here, he claims, the trial court found the murder of Mr. Bocanegra satisfied\n\nthe premeditation and deliberation standard even though the killer formed the intent to kill during\n\nthe fatal altercation and killed with a weapon found at hand. Petitioner alleges there was no\n\nevidence of planning activity, no evidence of a preexisting motive, and that multiple stab wounds\n\nalone are insufficient to prove premeditation and deliberation. See People v. Caldwell, 43 Cal.\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 26 of 213\n\n1\n\n\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n27\n\n2d 864, 869 (1955).\n\nThe state supreme court denied this claim when raised in \u201csupplement to existing habeas\n\ncorpus petition\u201d (claim ZZ), In re Sanchez, S049502, (DD), because that court found substantial\n\nevidence that Joey intended to kill his parents and that Petitioner could be found vicariously\n\nliable for these murders as an aider and abettor, as follows:\n\nJoey's actions, according to defendant's statements to prosecution witnesses,\n\nindicated that Joey deliberated over his father's killing. Joey initially struck Juan\n\nin the hallway and then, in the kitchen, obtained a knife that he used to stab Juan.\n\nIn our view, Joey formed a clear intent to kill, at the latest, during the altercation\n\nwith his father, and obtained a kitchen knife to carry out that plan. Our cases hold\n\nthat planning activity occurring over a short period of time is sufficient to find\n\npremeditation. \u201cThe true test is not the duration of time as much as it is the extent\n\nof the reflection. Thoughts may follow each other with great rapidity and cold,\n\n\n\ncalculated judgment may be arrived at quickly . . . .\u201d [Citation]\n\nThere was also ample evidence of motive. The evidence supports a strong\n\ninference that Joey entered his parents' house to rob them. When his father\n\nresisted the robbery, Joey was motivated to murder him in order to gain access to\n\nboth money and tangible goods, including a television set. Substantial evidence\n\nsupports a finding that Joey believed Juan stood in the way of his plan.\n\nFinally, the trial court could infer from the evidence that the manner of killing\n\ntended to demonstrate Joey acted with premeditation and deliberation. The attack\n\noccurred in a series of rooms, indicating that Juan's repeated attempts to break\n\naway from his murderers were consistently thwarted by the attackers' relentless\n\npursuit of him, even after he was gravely wounded. A rational finder of fact could\n\ninfer that the manner of killing, when combined with Joey's retrieval of the knife\n\nin the kitchen, and defendant's retrieval of a metal bar used in clubbing a\n\ndefenseless Juan, is sufficient to support the trier of fact's implied finding that\n\nJoey formed the plan to kill his parents during the altercation, located the murder\n\nweapon, and along with defendant, deliberately murdered his father. [Citation]\n\nThe same evidence supports the trial court's finding that defendant shared Joey's\n\nintent and plan to kill Juan, and thus was liable, as an aider and abettor, for Juan's\n\nmurder. [Citation] The killing of Juan ended after a prolonged knife attack and\n\nbeating from which Juan attempted to defend himself. Defendant's personal\n\ninvolvement in the murder was substantial. Far from merely acting as a lookout,\n\nor beating Juan after he was already dead, defendant was actively involved in\n\nassisting Joey in Juan's murder. Defendant's admitted act of arming himself with a\n\ncurved metal bar before joining the altercation between Joey and Juan indicates he\n\nshared Joey's plan. [Citation] From this evidence, the trier of fact could\n\nreasonably infer defendant knowingly engaged or assisted in Juan's murder as an\n\naider and abettor.\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 33-34.\n\nThe Court finds that, contrary to Petitioner assertion, and for the reasons discussed in\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 27 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n28\n\nclaims 1-4, the state court\u2019s analysis could reasonably rely upon evidence before it of a preexisting\n\nmotive to obtain money from Mr. Bocanegra, involving a joint criminal design of\n\nmultiple and prolonged stab wounds, aided and abetted by Petitioner\u2019s participation with the\n\nmetal bar, sufficient to find premeditation and deliberation both by Joey and Petitioner. Id.\n\nGiven the state court\u2019s analysis and the record, there appears to be no risk of arbitrary and\n\ncapricious verdict.\n\nThis Court does not find the state court rejection of the claim was contrary to, or an\n\nunreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n\nCourt, or that the state court's ruling was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in\n\nlight of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding, viewed most favoring the\n\nprosecution, Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319.

Woodford, 279 F.3d\n\n825, 836 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\nThe Supreme Court explained the legal standard for assessing a claim of ineffective\n\n\n\nassistance of counsel in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 685\u201387 (1984). Strickland\n\npropounded a two prong test for analysis of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. First, the\n\npetitioner must show that counsel's performance was deficient, requiring a showing that counsel\n\nmade errors so serious that he or she was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed by the\n\nSixth Amendment. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687. The petitioner must show that \u201ccounsel's\n\nrepresentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d and must identify counsel\u2019s\n\nalleged acts or omissions that were not the result of reasonable professional judgment\n\nconsidering the circumstances. Richter, 562 U.S. at 104 (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688);\n\nUnited States v. Quintero-Barraza, 78 F.3d 1344, 1348 (9th Cir. 1995).\n\nPetitioner must show that counsel's errors were so egregious as to deprive defendant of a\n\nfair trial, one whose result is reliable. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688. Judicial scrutiny of counsel's\n\nperformance is highly deferential, and the habeas court must guard against the temptation \u201cto\n\nsecond-guess counsel\u2019s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence.\u201d Id. at 689. Instead, the\n\nhabeas court must make every effort \u201cto eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to\n\nreconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from\n\ncounsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d Id.; see also Richter, 562 U.S. at 107. A court indulges a\n\n\u201c\u2018strong presumption\u2019 that counsel's representation was within the \u2018wide range\u2019 of reasonable\n\nprofessional assistance.\u201d Richter, 562 U.S. at 104 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687); Sanders\n\nv. Ratelle, 21 F.3d 1446, 1456 (9th Cir. 1994). This presumption of reasonableness means that\n\nnot only do we \u201cgive the attorneys the benefit of the doubt,\u201d we must also \u201caffirmatively\n\nentertain the range of possible reasons [defense] counsel may have had for proceeding as they\n\ndid.\u201d Pinholster, 131 S.

However, \u201cgeneral\n\nprinciples have emerged regarding the duties of criminal defense attorneys that inform [a court's]\n\nview as to the \u2018objective standard of reasonableness' by which [a court must] assess attorney\n\nperformance, particularly with respect to the duty to investigate.\u201d Summerlin v. Schriro, 427\n\nF.3d 623, 629 (9th Cir. 2005). \u201c[S]trategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and\n\nfacts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690.\n\nHowever, strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable\n\nprecisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on\n\ninvestigation. In other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a\n\nreasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary. In any ineffectiveness\n\ncase, a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all\n\nthe circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel's judgment.

A\n\ncourt need not determine whether counsel's performance was deficient before examining the\n\nprejudice suffered by the petitioner as a result of the alleged deficiencies. Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n\n697. Since the defendant must affirmatively prove prejudice, any deficiency that does not result\n\nin prejudice must necessarily fail.\n\nUnder the AEDPA, the Court does not apply Strickland de novo. Rather, the Court must\n\ndetermine whether the state court\u2019s application of Strickland was unreasonable. Richter, 562\n\n\n\nU.S. at 99-100. Establishing that a state court\u2019s application of Strickland was unreasonable\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) is very difficult. Richter, 562 U.S. at 100.

Richter, 562 U.S. at 105 (quoting Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556\n\nU.S. 111, 123 (2009)). Further, because the Strickland rule is a \u201cgeneral\u201d one, courts have \u201cmore\n\nleeway . . . in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations\u201d and the \u201crange of reasonable\n\napplications is substantial.\u201d Id. at 101; Premo v.

Review of Claim 6\n\nIn this claim, Petitioner alleges ineffective assistance of counsel by failure to investigate\n\nand present evidence of mental state defenses, violating his Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendment rights.\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 31 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n\n\n27\n\n28\n\n32\n\nPetitioner raised this claim in his state petition for habeas corpus. (SPet. claim C.) The\n\nCalifornia Supreme Court summarily denied the claim in a decision unaccompanied by\n\nexplanation. In re Sanchez, S049502 (DD.) In such a case where the state court denied\n\nPetitioner\u2019s state petition for habeas corpus without an explanation, \u201cthe habeas petitioner\u2019s\n\nburden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis for the state court to deny\n\nrelief,\u201d Richter, 562 U.S. at 98, and this Court \u201cmust determine what arguments or theories\n\nsupported or . . . could have supported, the state court\u2019s decision; and then it must ask whether it\n\nis possible fair-minded jurists could disagree that those arguments or theories are inconsistent\n\nwith the holding in a prior decision of this Court.\u201d Id. (emphasis added).\n\nPetitioner contends that a reasonable investigation would have revealed his organic brain\n\ndifficulties and psychiatric impairments relating to childhood abuse and trauma and deprivations\n\nand his long history of substance abuse. During the week prior to the homicides, Petitioner\n\nalleges he drank alcohol and smoked PCP continually and in large amounts, triggering a posttraumatic\n\nstress reaction, precluding his forming an intent to kill and premeditation and\n\ndeliberation during the Bocanegra homicides. He claims his substance abuse led to long-term\n\nbrain dysfunction. (SHCP Ex. 114, \u00b6\u00b6 67-70.)\n\nThe evidence proffered by Petitioner suggests chronic substance abuse beginning as early\n\nas 1977. (SPet. Exhs. 105, pp. 64-65, 74-75; 110, p. 1; 119, p. 8; 123, p. 1; and 128,at pp. 1-2.)\n\nPetitioner offers evidence that he engaged in substance abuse during the weeks prior to the\n\nmurders. (SPet. Ex. 105, pp. 85-87.) However, Respondent correctly notes the absence of\n\ncompetent evidence that Petitioner ingested and/or was under the influence of phencyclidine,\n\nmarijuana, or alcohol on the days the Bocanegra and Tatman murders occurred. Based on the\n\nrecord before it, the state court could reasonably have found that Petitioner was not under the\n\ninfluence of phencyclidine (PCP), marijuana, or alcohol at the time of the Bocanegra and Tatman\n\nmurders.\n\nThe state court could have reasonably concluded that Petitioner\u2019 statements to jailhouse\n\ninformant Hernandez (CT 479-484, 487-489, 495, 500-505), detective Stratton (CT 77-78), and\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 32 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n33\n\nreporter Trihey (RT 16-20; 175-181; SPet. Exhs. 700-701) demonstrated Petitioner\u2019s intentional\n\nand deliberate aiding and abetting of Joey in the Bocanegra murders. This being the case, a\n\ntactical decision not to investigate and present such a defense could be reasonable where\n\nevidence is lacking, or it could go toward aggravation. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690-91.\n\nPost-offenses jail records and medications Petitioner allegedly was given while\n\nincarcerated (SHCP Exhs. 601, 602) do not show his emotional and mental state at the time of\n\nthe crimes.\n\nDefense psychologist Donaldson, who evaluated Petitioner in May 1987, found that\n\nalthough there were indications of organic difficulties in perceptual motor integration, Petitioner\n\nwas of average intelligence. Specifically, Donaldson stated that:\n\nThere were no indications through the testing of deficits in reality testing, nor of a\n\nthought disorder of any kind. There were no indications of significant anxiety or\n\ndepression. In spite of his socially and educationally deprived background . . . Mr.\n\nPetitioner is a highly sociopathic individual.\n\n(SPet. Ex. 106, pp. 1-2.)\n\nPetitioner claims effective counsel would have been aware of the evidence showing\n\nserious mental problems and would have investigated this evidence. He points to a 1995\n\nneuropsychological evaluation by psychologist Froming finding severe diffuse organic brain\n\ndamage and localized brain dysfunction. (SHCP Ex. 114, \u00b6\u00b6 39-60.) He points to post-offense\n\n\n\njail records which showed continuing mental problems including paranoia, depression, stress,\n\ninsomnia, inability to eat and a suicide attempt, and that he was given medication for these\n\nconditions. He also notes his 1995 evaluation by defense psychiatrist, Dr. Foster, finding\n\ndepression, mental impairment and post-traumatic stress disorders from childhood trauma and\n\ndeprivation of basic necessities, exacerbated by substance abuse, all possibly extending back to\n\nthe time of the instant homicides. (SHCP Ex. 111, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 20-23, 79-95.) He alleges defense\n\ncounsel missed this opportunity to show lack of premeditation and deliberation, and also\n\nmistakenly believed voluntary intoxication would be no defense to felony murder. He further\n\nalleges that his impairments made him more likely to follow counsel's advice to waive a full\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 33 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n34\n\ndefense and also affected his ability to understand the consequences of doing so.\n\nRespondent views these allegations as speculation. Respondent contends that Petitioner\u2019s\n\nstatements to reporter Trihey did not necessarily imply that Petitioner believed his dead mother\n\n\n\nwas alive. Respondent contends that Hernandez\u2019s observation that Petitioner was suicidal is\n\nmere conjecture. Respondent contends that the 1995 opinions of psychiatrist Foster and\n\npsychologist Froming of a high probability of mental disorders and impairments at the time of\n\nthe crimes and subsequent trial are likewise speculation and surmise.\n\nThis Court agrees that Petitioner\u2019s proffer is not sufficient evidence of mental impairment\n\nat the time of the murders and subsequent trial. As discussed in claims 1-4, ante, the substantial\n\nevidence shows Petitioner knowingly and intentionally assisted Joey in the Bocanegra murders\n\nand confessed the same to reporter Trihey. Significantly, Petitioner told detective Boggs of his\n\ninvolvement in the Tatman murder (CT 288-320) and acknowledged that \u201che was going to prison\n\nfor the rest of his life anyway\u201d for his role in the Bocanegra murders. (CT 314.)\n\nThe Court does not find post-custody psychological and psychiatric reports sufficient\n\nevidence that, at the time of the crimes and trial thereon, Petitioner suffered neurological or\n\npsychological impairments. Significantly, there is no evidence defense psychiatrist Donaldson\n\nrecommended to Toton that a neuropsychological evaluation be performed. Psychiatrist\n\nMatychowiak, following his November 1987 court-ordered examination, found that Petitioner\n\nwas not suicidal or delusional or suffering memory gaps (SPet. Ex. 520, p. 5); that Petitioner\n\nplanned to tell the judge he was guilty (id. at 2); and that Petitioner understood the proceedings\n\nand could cooperate with counsel. (Id. at 6.) Petitioner told Matychowiak that he planned to tell\n\nthe jury he was guilty and \u201cget it over with.\u201d (SPet. Ex. 520, p. 2.) Dr. Matychowiak found\n\nPetitioner competent to stand trial.\n\nAdditionally, Petitioner cannot establish prejudice from defense counsel\u2019s alleged\n\nineffectiveness because a change in the outcome had mental defenses been further investigated\n\nand presented is not reasonably likely given the substantial evidence against him and his\n\nexpressed desire to plead guilty. That is, mental state defenses would not have been sufficient to\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 34 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n35\n\nundermine confidence in the trial outcome. See U.S. v. Lewis, 786 F.2d 1278, 1283 (5th Cir.\n\n1986). Defense psychologist Donaldson found Petitioner to be of average intelligence and\n\nthough there were indications in perceptual motor integration, no deficits in reality testing or\n\nthought disorder was detected. (SPet. Ex. 106, p.2.) Court appointed psychiatrist Matychowiak\n\ncame to essentially the same conclusions. (SPet. Ex. 520, p.1; CT 646.) Toton could reasonably\n\nhave believed Donaldson\u2019s negative findings were not relevant at the guilt and special\n\ncircumstance phase. (SPet. Ex. 137, p. 2.)\n\nPetitioner never alleged during trial proceedings that he was mentally impaired or that he\n\ndid not knowingly participate in the homicides. Rather he admitted his knowing participation to\n\nreporter Trihey (RT 181; see SPet. Exhs. 700-701), detective Stratton (CT 77-78) and informant\n\nHernandez (CT 479-484, 487-489). Such a defense was contrary to Petitioner\u2019s stated desire to\n\nplead guilty to the Bocanegra murders (SPet. Ex. 520, pp. 2-4) and \u201cdying for his crimes but\n\ndying with a clear conscience\u201d (SPet. Ex. 700). In fact, Petitioner proceeded to waive jury trial\n\non the guilt and special circumstances phase and submit on the preliminary hearing transcript and\n\ntestimony of additional prosecution witnesses. (See Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 23-30.) The\n\nevidence does not suggest a reasonable probability that Petitioner would have agreed to go\n\nforward on a mental defense, or that if he had, it would have been successful given his\n\nincriminating statements.\n\nFor the reasons stated, a fair-minded jurist could have found that Petitioner failed to\n\nestablish that defense counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\n\nand that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\n\ndifferent. Strickland, 466 U.S., at 687-694.\n\nIt does not appear that the state court rejection of the claim was contrary to, or an\n\nunreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n\nCourt, or that the state court's ruling was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in\n\n\n\nlight of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nClaim 6 is denied.\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 35 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n36\n\nc. Review of Claim 7\n\nPetitioner alleges ineffective assistance of counsel by failure to investigate and impeach\n\ninformant Hernandez, the principal witness against him, violating his Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and\n\nFourteenth Amendment rights.\n\nThe California Supreme Court summarily denied this claim (SPet. Claim D) raised in\n\nPetitioner\u2019s state petition for habeas corpus. In re Sanchez, S049502 (DD.) As noted, in such a\n\ncase \u201cthe habeas petitioner\u2019s burden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis\n\nfor the state court to deny relief,\u201d Richter, 562 U.S. at 98, and this Court \u201cmust determine what\n\n\n\narguments or theories supported or . . . could have supported, the state court\u2019s decision; and then\n\nit must ask whether it is possible fair-minded jurists could disagree that those arguments or\n\ntheories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this Court.\u201d Id. (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\nPetitioner claims that, though Hernandez\u2019s history of drug abuse and heroin addiction\n\nwas available to defense counsel, counsel deficiently failed to investigate these matters or\n\ninterview Hernandez. (SHCP Exhs. 137, \u00b6 12; 113, \u00b6 11.) This even though Hernandez\u2019s\n\nallegedly inconsistent testimony may have been related to drug use and the plea deal he received\n\nin exchange for his testimony. Petitioner claims additional evidence discovered might have\n\nmotivated Toton to put on a full defense. (SHCP Ex. 137, \u00b6 18.)\n\nThis Court is unconvinced. For the reasons and upon consideration of the evidence\n\ndiscussed in claims 1 through 4, ante, the state court could reasonably have determined there was\n\nno basis upon which Petitioner could have effectively impeached Hernandez. Petitioner has not\n\nshown that Hernandez gave materially contradictory, inconsistent or false testimony, or that\n\nHernandez was motivated by an undisclosed plea bargain. No facts or discrepancies between the\n\ntestimony and the physical evidence establish or compel the conclusion that Hernandez, by virtue\n\nof his alleged substance addiction, his plea deal, or otherwise, was motivated to and did testify\n\nfalsely or inaccurately. (SPet. Ex. 900, pp. 4, 11; SResp. Ex. B.)\n\nDefense counsel Toton could have made a reasoned tactical decision not to interview\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 36 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n37\n\nHernandez. Having cross-examined Hernandez at the preliminary hearing, Toton determined on\n\nthat basis not to interview him. (SPet. Ex. 137, pp. 3-4.) Moreover, Toton did ask Hernandez\n\nabout any undisclosed plea deal during cross-examination in the guilt and special circumstances\n\nphase. Hernandez\u2019s testimony was consistent with Petitioner\u2019s statements and the physical\n\nevidence, that he had not been offered any disposition of then pending criminal matters prior to\n\nagreeing to testify at the Petitioner prosecution. (CT 576-577.) Toton later cross-examined\n\nHernandez during the penalty phase. Hernandez admitted a deal on a then pending charge in\n\nexchange for his testimony in Petitioner\u2019s proceeding. (RT 2850-2851.) The Court does not find\n\nthat Hernandez\u2019s testimony was false or misleading in this regard.\n\nDefense counsel Frank was not responsible for the guilt and special circumstance phase.\n\nIt was not unreasonable that Frank did not interview Hernandez relative to his statements therein.\n\n(SPet. Ex. 113, p. 4.)\n\nAdditionally, given the speculative nature of impeachment, Petitioner\u2019s desire to plead\n\nguilty, and the incriminating evidence, all as discussed in claims 1-4, ante, Petitioner was not\n\nprejudiced from any allegedly deficient performance. There was not a reasonable probability of\n\na different outcome from further attempted impeachment of Hernandez.\n\nAlso, such a defense was contrary to Petitioner\u2019s stated desire to plead guilty to the\n\nBocanegra murders (SPet. Ex. 520, p. 2) and \u201cdying for his crimes but dying with a clear\n\nconscience\u201d (SPet. Ex. 700). Petitioner waived jury trial and submitted the guilt and special\n\ncircumstances phase on the preliminary hearing transcript and on the testimony of additional\n\nprosecution witnesses. See Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 23-30. The evidence does not suggest a\n\nreasonable probability impeachment would have been successful given his incriminating\n\nstatements to detective Stratton and reporter Trihey and the crime scene evidence corroborated\n\nby Hernandez\u2019s testimony. (See claims 1-4, ante.)\n\nFor the reasons stated, it is clear that a fair-minded jurist could have found that Petitioner\n\nfailed to establish that defense counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of\n\nreasonableness and that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 37 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n38\n\nwould have been different.

Review of Claim 8\n\nPetitioner claims ineffective assistance of counsel by failure to investigate and present\n\ntestimony of jailhouse informant Seeley, violating his Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment\n\nrights.\n\nThe California Supreme Court summarily denied this claim (SPet. Claim E) raised in\n\nPetitioner\u2019s state petition for habeas corpus. In re Sanchez, S049502 (DD.) As noted, in such a\n\ncase \u201cthe habeas petitioner\u2019s burden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis\n\nfor the state court to deny relief,\u201d Richter, 562 U.S. at 98, and this Court \u201cmust determine what\n\n\n\narguments or theories supported or . . . could have supported, the state court\u2019s decision; and then\n\nit must ask whether it is possible fair-minded jurists could disagree that those arguments or\n\ntheories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this Court.\u201d Id. (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\nPetitioner claims that Seeley had conversations both with him and Reyes and would have\n\ntestified that: Reyes was in the Bocanegra home at the time of the their murders; it was Reyes,\n\nnot Petitioner, who struck Mr. Bocanegra; that the assault on Mrs. Bocanegra by Petitioner and\n\nReyes was unconnected to Joey\u2019s subsequent killing of her; that Petitioner and Reyes did not\n\nintend to rob the Bocanegras; that Petitioner and Reyes had no plan to kill the Bocanegras; and\n\nthat their deaths resulted from the sudden quarrel between Joey and Mr. Bocanegra. (SHCP Ex.\n\n419.) Toton, Petitioner claims, was aware of Seeley\u2019s statement, (SCHP Ex. 420), but did not\n\ninterview him or investigate. (SHCP Ex. 137, \u00b6 12.) This even though counsel for Reyes in his\n\nseparate proceedings did attempt to investigate and interview Seeley (SHCP Ex. 136, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 8),\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 38 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n\n\n39\n\nconsistent with the local professional practice of interviewing informants. (SHCP Ex. 127 \u00b6 6.)\n\nThis Court finds that the record could reasonably support a tactical decision by Toton not\n\nto investigate Seeley\u2019s possibly exculpating testimony. Toton, who had experience with Seeley\n\non at least one other case, did not believe Seeley had actually spoken with Petitioner (SPet. Ex.\n\n137, \u00b6 4), did not believe Seeley was credible, and doubted the prosecution would call Seeley.\n\n(SPet. Ex. 137, p. 4.) Moreover, Seeley\u2019s version of events could have been viewed as contrary\n\nto the physical evidence at the Bocanegra crime scene. (SPet. Ex. 419, pp. 5-6, 17; CT 355-382.)\n\nSee e.g., Denham v. Deeds, 954 F.2d 1501, 1505-06 (9th Cir. 1992) (defense counsel not\n\nineffective where decision not to call witness based on inconsistencies in witness\u2019s testimony).\n\nSeeley\u2019s testimony was in some ways more inculpating of Petitioner than were\n\nHernandez\u2019s statements. Under Seeley\u2019s version of events, Petitioner actively participated in\n\nattempts to subdue Mrs. Bocanegra. Seeley apparently would have testified that Petitioner struck\n\nseveral blows to Mrs. Bocanegra\u2019s head with a piece of rebar whereupon Joey stabbed her to\n\ndeath. (SPet. Ex. 419, pp. 6-8, 18-19.) Furthermore, testimony by Seeley likely would have\n\nbeen subject to rebuttal by significant contrary evidence from Hernandez, Stratton, Trihey, as\n\nwell as by the bloodstain evidence and Petitioner\u2019s professed desire to plead guilty. All this\n\nlikely obviating any prejudice to Petitioner for not investigating and presenting Seeley.\n\nEvidence of Petitioner\u2019s shoeprint in the kitchen undermines Seeley\u2019s July 27, 1987\n\nstatements to district attorney investigator Pendleton that Petitioner watched the assault on Mr.\n\nBocanegra from the hallway. (SPet. Ex. 419.) Seeley\u2019s version also could be viewed as\n\ninconsistent with Petitioner\u2019s above noted statements to Hernandez and detective Stratton and to\n\nreporter Trihey, where Petitioner omits any mention of Reyes\u2019s involvement in the assault by\n\nJoey on Mr. Bocanegra.\n\nIn addition to these considerations of credibility and corroboration, the record reflects\n\nthat Seeley refused to speak with counsel for Reyes, (SPet. Ex. 136, pp.1-3), who characterized\n\nSeeley as \u201ca professional jailhouse snitch.\u201d (SPet. Ex. 139, p. 2.) It is uncertain that he would\n\nhave agreed to speak with Toton. Even if, as Petitioner alleges, Toton had an unusual practice of\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 39 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n40\n\nnot talking to jailhouse informants except on the witness stand, Toton\u2019s alleged failure in this\n\ncase to investigate and present evidence from Seeley could nonetheless have been a reasonable\n\ntrial tactic. Strickland permits counsel to \u201cmake a reasonable decision that makes particular\n\ninvestigations unnecessary.\u201d Richter, 562 U.S. at 106 (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691).\n\nAccordingly, it was at least arguable that a reasonable attorney could decide to forego\n\ninvestigation into Seeley\u2019s testimony in similar circumstances. Toton was allowed to formulate a\n\nstrategy, reasonable at the time, and to balance limited resources consistent with effective trial\n\ntactics and strategies. See Richter, 562 U.S. at 107. Toton was not required to pursue an\n\ninvestigation that would have been fruitless, or worse, harmful to the defense. Id. at 108.\n\nAs to defense counsel Frank, he could reasonably have decided not to interview Seeley to\n\nthe extent any evidence to be provided by Seeley related only to the guilt and special\n\ncircumstances phase, handled by Toton. (See SPet. Ex. 113, p. 4.)\n\nThis claim, to the extent based on insufficiency of the evidence and actual innocence, is\n\nunpersuasive for reasons discussed in claims 1 through 4, ante. For the reasons discussed\n\ntherein, Petitioner has not established that Hernandez\u2019s testimony was materially unreliable or\n\ninconsistent with the testimony of Stratton and Trihey and the physical evidence found at the\n\nBocanegra crime scene, or that Hernandez testimony was given in exchange for an undisclosed\n\nfavorable (to Hernandez) plea deal.\n\nNor has Petitioner made an evidentiary showing of prejudice. For the reasons discussed\n\nabove, the state court could have determined there was no reasonable probability of a different\n\noutcome from investigating Seeley and presenting him as a witness. Fundamentally, such a\n\ndefense was contrary to Petitioner\u2019s stated desire to plead guilty to the Bocanegra murders,\n\n(SPet. Ex. 520, p. 2), and \u201cdying for his crimes but dying with a clear conscience.\u201d (SPet. Ex.\n\n700.) Based on that desire, Petitioner waived jury trial and submitted guilt and special\n\n\n\ncircumstances phase on the preliminary hearing transcript and the testimony of additional\n\nprosecution witnesses. See Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 23-30; CT 891-892; RT 108a-115a.)

He bases this claim upon facts allege in claims 1 through 4.\n\nThe Court is not persuaded. In June, 1988, prior to trial, defense investigator Peninger\n\ninterviewed Joey. (SHCP Ex. 127, \u00b6 5.) Though Toton conceded he could have investigated\n\nJoey further, and would have done so if a full defense had been mounted, (SHCP Ex. 137, \u00b6\u00b6 18,\n\n21, 22), Petitioner waived a full defense.\n\nProffer of evidence that there was no robbery motive would not have changed the\n\noutcome. The trial court\u2019s found Petitioner was not guilty of robbery, and found not true the\n\nrobbery-murder special circumstance. (CT 906; RT 236-237.) Therefore no prejudice arose from\n\nany failure to investigate and present evidence of Joey\u2019s temper and prior assaultive behavior\n\nrelating to robbery-murder theory.\n\nAs discussed in claims 1-8, ante, there was sufficient evidence to convict Petitioner of\n\naiding and abetting first degree murder based upon a finding of premeditation and deliberation.\n\nThe state court could reasonably have concluded that, in the face of such substantial evidence of\n\nguilt, it was not reasonably likely that a showing of Joey\u2019s temper and prior assaultive conduct\n\nwould have raised a reasonable doubt that Petitioner aided and abetted the premeditated and\n\ndeliberate murders of Mr. Bocanegra and Mrs. Bocanegra.\n\nPetitioner points out that counsel for Reyes, in Reyes\u2019s separate proceeding, did\n\ninvestigate Joey and subpoenaed trial witnesses based thereon. However, this alone does not\n\nsuggest that, on the record in this proceeding, Toton\u2019s decision not to do so was an unreasonable\n\ntrial tactic. Especially so given the above noted substantial evidence of Petitioner\u2019s guilt and\n\nReyes\u2019s decision to plead guilty to three counts of first degree murder.\n\nPetitioner has not made an evidentiary showing of prejudice, that there is a reasonable\n\nprobability of a different outcome from investigating and presenting evidence about Joey. The\n\nstate court could reasonably have found that, considering the record before it, evidence about\n\nJoey would not have changed the result. Petitioner gave incriminating statements to detective\n\nStratton and reporter Trihey, corroborated by the crime scene evidence and Hernandez\u2019s\n\ntestimony. (See claims 1-4, ante.)

(SHCP Exhs. 417, pp.1-2; 120, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.)\n\nPetitioner reasons this supplemental evidence would have rebutted the prosecution theory that\n\nonly Petitioner and Joey were present in the Bocanegra home at the time of the murders, and\n\nwould have caused defense counsel to take the matter to full trial on guilt, (SHCP Ex. 137, pp. 6-\n\n7) and thereby increased possibility of a negotiated plea more favorable than the conviction and\n\nsentence handed down.\n\nThe Court finds this claim unavailing. The evidence in the state record is consistent with\n\nReyes, at some point, entering the Bocanegra home. Evidence of Reyes\u2019s bloody hand print on\n\nthe front doorknob was admitted at Petitioner\u2019s preliminary hearing. (CT 202-203.)\n\nPetitioner is correct that criminologist Laskowski testified at preliminary hearing to only\n\ntwo shoe tread patterns found at the Bocanegra crime scene, and that Laskowski (during his\n\nsubsequent preparation for the separate Reyes trial) identified a third shoe tread pattern in the\n\nkitchen of the Bocanegra residence. However, Reyes admitted in this subsequent proceeding\n\nthat he served as lookout during the murders and entered the residence only afterwards to assist\n\nPetitioner and Joey. (SResp. Ex. A., p. 3:1-11.)\n\nPetitioner is also correct in noting that, while Dr. Holloway testified at the preliminary\n\nhearing that the same type of implement inflicted consistent scalp wounds on both Mr.\n\nBocanegra and Mrs. Bocanegra, (CT 118-119), Holloway at the penalty phase stated that Mr.\n\nBocanegra\u2019s scalp wounds were only \u201cpartially\u201d, rather than \u201centirely\u201d consistent with Mrs.\n\nBocanegra\u2019s scalp wounds; and that it appeared different objects were used to inflict these scalp\n\nwounds. (RT 2712-13, 2720-21, 2725.) However, Holloway qualified his preliminary hearing\n\ntestimony by noting that the scalp wounds on Mr. Bocanegra and Mrs. Bocanegra were not\n\nnecessarily inflicted by the same instrument. (CT 131-134.)\n\nHolloway\u2019s testimony, as qualified, did not then preclude the possibility that more than\n\none weapon and more than one perpetrator inflicted the wounds. Defense counsel Toton argued\n\nas much, that different individuals, using different weapons, could have inflicted the scalp\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 44 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n45\n\nwounds on Mr. Bocanegra and Mrs. Bocanegra. (RT 189-191.)\n\nThe Court finds that, for the reasons discussed in claims 1-9, the state court could\n\nreasonably have found that there was sufficient evidence to convict Petitioner of aiding and\n\nabetting first degree murder based upon a finding of premeditation and deliberation. In the face\n\nof such substantial evidence, a further showing regarding physical evidence, that Reyes left a\n\nbloody shoe print, and that two different weapons may have inflicted the scalp wounds, would\n\nnot have raised a reasonable doubt that Petitioner aided and abetted the premeditated and\n\ndeliberate murders of Mr. Bocanegra and Mrs. Bocanegra. Additionally, evidence of Petitioner\u2019s\n\nshoeprint in the kitchen undermines Seeley\u2019s testimony that Petitioner watched the assault on\n\nMr. Bocanegra from the hallway. (SHCP, Ex. 419, pp. 6, 7, 22-23.)\n\nFor the reasons stated, Petitioner has not made an evidentiary showing of prejudice, i.e.,\n\nthat there is a reasonable probability of a different outcome from investigating physical evidence\n\nof the Bocanegra murder scene. As noted, such a defense was contrary to Petitioner\u2019s stated\n\ndesire to plead guilty to the Bocanegra murders (SPet. Ex. 520, p.2) and \u201cdying for his crimes\n\nbut dying with a clear conscience.\u201d (SPet. Ex. 700.) Petitioner waived jury trial and submitted\n\nguilt and special circumstances phase on the preliminary hearing transcript and the testimony of\n\nadditional prosecution witnesses. See Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 23-30.\n\n\n\nAccordingly, the Court is not convinced of a reasonable probability that supplemental\n\ncrime scene evidence would have prompted defense counsel to put on a further defense or would\n\nhave resulted in a more favorable disposition for Petitioner given his incriminating statements to\n\ndetective Stratton and reporter Trihey and the crime scene evidence corroborated by Hernandez\u2019s\n\ntestimony.

Claim H) raised in\n\nPetitioner\u2019s state petition for habeas corpus. In re Sanchez, S049502 (DD). As noted, in such a\n\ncase \u201cthe habeas petitioner\u2019s burden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis\n\nfor the state court to deny relief,\u201d Richter, 562 U.S. at 98, and this Court \u201cmust determine what\n\narguments or theories supported or . . . could have supported, the state court\u2019s decision; and then\n\nit must ask whether it is possible fair-minded jurists could disagree that those arguments or\n\ntheories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this Court.\u201d Id. (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\nPetitioner alleges that defense counsel was deficient in failing to pursue plea negotiations\n\ngiven that the evidence supported the prosecution\u2019s theory that Joey was the actual killer of his\n\nparents. (RT 122, 155-156.) Petitioner points out that Reyes, whom the prosecution viewed to\n\nbe of equal culpability, consummated a plea deal in his separate proceeding and avoided the\n\ndeath penalty. (Id.)\n\nThis claim fails. The state court could reasonably have found defense counsel Toton was\n\nnot deficient in failing to pursue continuing plea negotiations. The record reflects that Toton\n\nattempted to obtain a plea deal for Petitioner on May 10, 1988. But the prosecutor rejected the\n\nplea deal when Petitioner refused to provide information of Joey\u2019s involvement in the Bocanegra\n\nmurders, even though Petitioner had proposed to do just that in his plea bid. (SResp. Ex. B.)\n\nToton also made a pre-penalty phase overture for Petitioner to provide information\n\nregarding Joey\u2019s involvement in the Bocanegra murders in return for life without parole.

In the face of such evidence and Petitioner\u2019s failure to support his\n\nnegotiated plea offers, it is not reasonably probable that continuing attempts by defense counsel\n\ntoward a negotiated plea would have been successful.

Review of Claim 12\n\nPetitioner claims ineffective assistance of counsel by counsel\u2019s failure to move to exclude\n\njailhouse statements by Petitioner to the police implicating him in the Bocanegra homicides,\n\nviolating his Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n\nThe California Supreme Court summarily denied this claim (SPet. Claim I) raised in\n\nPetitioner\u2019s state petition for habeas corpus. In re Sanchez, S049502 (DD). As noted, in such a\n\ncase \u201cthe habeas petitioner\u2019s burden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis\n\nfor the state court to deny relief,\u201d Richter, 562 U.S. at 98, and this Court \u201cmust determine what\n\narguments or theories supported or . . . could have supported, the state court\u2019s decision; and then\n\nit must ask whether it is possible fair-minded jurists could disagree that those arguments or\n\ntheories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this Court.\u201d Id. (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\nPetitioner supports this claim with facts alleged in claim 6, ante. He alleges that he\n\nsuffered organic brain damage, psychiatric disorders (post-traumatic stress disorder, depression,\n\nand paranoia), and that he expected favorable treatment when, at the request of his then attorney,\n\nMr. Huffman, Petitioner waived Miranda rights and gave incriminating statements to detective\n\nStratton, (CT 75-78) (Bocanegra murders), and detective Boggs (CT 308-319) (Tatman\n\nmurder). Petitioner claims that his Miranda waiver was not intelligent and voluntary.\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 48 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n49\n\nIn Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444 (1966), the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe\n\nprosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from\n\ncustodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards\n\neffective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d As to the procedural safeguards to\n\nbe employed, \u201c[p]rior to any questioning, the person must be warned that he has a right to remain\n\nsilent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a\n\nright to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.\u201d Id. Nevertheless, \u201c\u2018[t]he\n\ndefendant may waive effectuation\u2019 of the rights conveyed in the warnings \u2018provided the waiver is\n\nmade voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.\u2019\u201d Moran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 421 (1986)\n\n(quoting Miranda, 384 U.S. at 444, 475).\n\nThis claim fails for the same reasons discussed in claim 6. The state court could\n\nreasonably have found that the evidence did not show that prior to, during, or after the murders\n\nPetitioner suffered any material neurological and/or psychiatric impairment. The report of courtappointed\n\npsychiatrist Matychowiak states that on November 13, 1987, [Petitioner] was \u201cable to\n\ndiscuss himself, his decisions and his reasoning for his decisions\u201d and was \u201cpresently able to\n\nunderstand the nature and purpose of the proceedings taken against him\u201d and \u201cto cooperate in a\n\nrational manner with counsel in presenting a defense.\u201d (SPet. Ex. 520, pp.5-6.)\n\nUnder Miranda, if a suspect indicates \u201cat any time prior to or during questioning, that he\n\nwishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease.\u201d Miranda, 384 U.S. at 473-74 (emphasis\n\nadded). Petitioner does not point to evidence supporting coercive tactics by Stratton and Boggs\n\nor showing Petitioner was promised any concession in his then pending charge of burglarizing\n\nJoey\u2019s residence. See Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 167 (1986) (confession not\n\ninvoluntary absent coercive police activity). Petitioner apparently did not attempt to make any\n\n\n\nevidentiary showing of police coercion. The state court could have reasonably concluded\n\nPetitioner\u2019s Miranda waiver was not involuntary.\n\nAdditionally, it was Petitioner who initiated contact with the police, offering testimony\n\non the Bocanegra murders in exchange for \u201csome type of consideration\u201d in the burglary charge\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 49 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n50\n\nagainst him. (SPet. Ex. 412; CT 76.)\n\nThe Court finds that, in the face of such lack of evidence, it is not reasonably probable\n\nthat a motion to exclude jailhouse statements based upon invalid waiver would have been\n\nsuccessful. See Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U.S. 365, 381 (1986) (counsel\u2019s failure to make a\n\nfutile motion is not ineffective assistance). Even assuming impaired mental status, such alone is\n\nnot sufficient reason to suppress a confession. See Connelly, 479 U.S. at 167 (coercive police\n\nconduct necessary to find confession involuntary under Due Process Clause).\n\nPetitioner has not made an evidentiary showing of prejudice, that there is a reasonable\n\n\n\nprobability of a different outcome had defense counsel moved to exclude jailhouse statements\n\nbased on invalid waiver. As discussed, such a defense was contrary to Petitioner\u2019s stated desire\n\nto plead guilty to the Bocanegra murders (SPet. Ex. 520, p.2) and \u201cdying for his crimes but dying\n\nwith a clear conscience.\u201d (SPet. Ex. 700.) Petitioner waived jury trial and submitted the guilt\n\nand special circumstances phase on the preliminary hearing transcript and the testimony of\n\nadditional prosecution witnesses. See Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 23-30. The evidence does not\n\nsuggest a reasonable probability that a motion to exclude jailhouse statements would have\n\nresulted in a more favorable disposition for Petitioner given his incriminating statements to\n\nreporter Trihey and the crime scene evidence corroborated by Hernandez\u2019s testimony. (See\n\nclaims 1-4, ante.)\n\nFor the reasons stated, a fair-minded jurist could have found that Petitioner failed to\n\nestablish that defense counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\n\nand that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\n\ndifferent.

Review of Claim 13\n\nIn this next claim, Petitioner alleges ineffective assistance of counsel by failure to seek\n\nsufficient continuance to adequately prepare for trial, violating his Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendment rights.\n\nThe California Supreme Court summarily denied this claim (SPet. Claim J) raised in\n\nPetitioner\u2019s state petition for habeas corpus. In re Sanchez, S049502 (DD.) As noted, in such a\n\ncase \u201cthe habeas petitioner\u2019s burden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis\n\nfor the state court to deny relief,\u201d Richter, 562 U.S. at 98, and this Court \u201cmust determine what\n\narguments or theories supported or . . . could have supported, the state court\u2019s decision; and then\n\nit must ask whether it is possible fair-minded jurists could disagree that those arguments or\n\ntheories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this Court.\u201d Id. (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\nPetitioner supports this claim with facts alleged in claims 2, 4, and 6 through 10. He\n\nalleges that, as of May 16, 1988, when a three-week pre-trail continuance was requested and\n\ngranted through June 27, 1988, defense counsel had done no guilt investigation, except for\n\nconsulting a serologist and obtaining a sanity evaluation, (SHCP, Ex. 127, \u00b6 4), and had not done\n\nany investigation for the penalty phase. (SHCP, Ex. 127, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 11.) He claims competent\n\ncounsel would have begun trial preparations sooner. (Id., \u00b6 12.)\n\nPetitioner\u2019s trial began on July 7, 1988. He alleges that had defense counsel requested,\n\nconsistent with local practice, required a continuance longer than the three weeks, there is a\n\nreasonable probability that a plea bargain could have been negotiated, or a full trial on guilt and\n\nspecial circumstances would have been sought.\n\nFor the reasons discussed in claims 1-12, the evidence does not support a reasonable\n\npossibility that Petitioner would have received a more favorable disposition even with a longer\n\ncontinuance. Petitioner relies on defense investigator Peninger\u2019s declaration regarding the extent\n\nto which she was aware of the defense investigation and her view that further investigation\n\nshould have been done. (SPet. Ex. 127, pp. 1-2.) Even if evidence, the Peninger declaration\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 51 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n52\n\ndoes not demonstrate the actual extent and tactical appropriateness of defense counsel\u2019s trial\n\npreparations.\n\nThe record suggests that defense counsel timely began trial preparations, retaining\n\ndefense expert(s) as early as November 1987. (RT [5/16/88] 3-4.) Petitioner concedes defense\n\ncounsel retained serology and psychological experts prior to the request for continuance. The\n\ncontinuance request was partially opposed by the prosecution, (RT [5/16/88] 5-6; CT 713-714),\n\nsuggesting a further continuance was unlikely.\n\nThere state court could reasonably have determined that Petitioner did not want or need a\n\ncontinuance. Petitioner initially refused to waive time for beginning trial, stating his intention to\n\nenter a guilty plea. (RT [5/16//88] 7.) Petitioner agreed to waive time only after discussions with\n\ncounsel. (RT [5/16/88] 7-8.) Petitioner continued to express his desire to plead guilty to the\n\nBocanegra murders. (SPet. Exhs. 520, p.2; 700.)\n\nOn July 11, 1988, Toton requested submission of guilt and special circumstance phase\n\non the preliminary hearing transcript. Defense counsel Frank had no expressed need for a further\n\n\n\ncontinuance to prepare his penalty phase case. Frank stated his preparations would be complete\n\nby July 25, 1988. (RT [5/16/88] 6.) The penalty phase did not start until September 21, 1988,\n\nalmost two month later. (CT 949; RT 2583.) It does not reasonably appear the defense needed\n\nand would have been granted further pre-trial continuance. \u201cA fair assessment of attorney\n\nperformance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight . . .\n\nand to evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at the time.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689.\n\nFor the reasons stated, a fair-minded jurist could have reasonably have determined that,\n\nbased on the evidence, a longer continuance would not have resulted in a more favorable\n\ndisposition for Petitioner. His incriminating statements to detective Stratton and reporter Trihey\n\nand the crime scene evidence that was corroborated by Hernandez\u2019s testimony reasonably\n\nsuggest otherwise. (See claims 1-12, ante.)\n\nPetitioner has failed to establish that defense counsel\u2019s performance fell below an\n\nobjective standard of reasonableness and that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 52 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n\n\n53\n\nof the proceeding would have been different.

Review of Claim 14\n\nPetitioner next claims ineffective assistance of counsel by the decision to waive jury trial,\n\nconfrontation and presentation of a defense, violating his Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendment rights.\n\nThe California Supreme Court summarily denied this claim (SPet. Claim K) raised in\n\nPetitioner\u2019s state petition for habeas corpus. In re Sanchez, S049502 (DD.)\n\nThe state supreme court, on direct appeal, addressed the merits of the validity of\n\nsubmission on the Preliminary Hearing Transcript as follow:\n\n[Petitioner\u2019s] chief guilt phase trial counsel, Toton, informed the court that the\n\nsubmission proposal was a compromise made by defendant at Toton's request.\n\nDefendant originally had wanted to plead guilty to the capital charges, but Toton\n\nwould not consent to such a plea, believing that a guilty plea would amount to\n\nineffective assistance of counsel . . . .

Even so, the California Supreme Court went on to find Petitioner\u2019s\n\nsubmission on the preliminary hearing transcripts was not a \u201cslow (guilty) plea\u201d that would have\n\nrequired an on the record waiver of the right against self-incrimination, as follows:\n\nDefense counsel Toton conducted substantial cross-examination of the\n\nprosecution witnesses during the preliminary hearing. Toton also called\n\nprosecution witnesses Hernandez and Detective Stratton to testify for the defense,\n\nand questioned Hernandez about whether he had agreed to testify against\n\ndefendant with the intent of making a deal in his own case.\n\nIn addition, following the close of the prosecution's guilt phase presentation,\n\nToton renewed his motions to strike portions of the trial testimony of Maria\n\n\n\nRodriguez, Detective Boggs, and William Freeman (the patrolman who seized\n\ntwo screwdrivers from defendant that had been stolen from the Bocanegra\n\nresidence), and then moved for a judgment of acquittal of all the charges.\n\nIn arguing the motion for acquittal, Toton asserted there was insufficient evidence\n\nof defendant's guilt of the robbery and murder charges, and that the People failed\n\nto charge properly the special circumstance allegations. In addition, Toton\n\nasserted that no physical evidence linked defendant to the Bocanegra murders. He\n\nargued that the prosecution presented no evidence of premeditation in those\n\nmurders, and that defendant's hypothetical questions to Detective Stratton should\n\nnot be used as evidence of murder. Toton also pointed out that defendant's\n\nincriminating statements to newsman Trihey implied knowledge of the crime, but\n\nnot intent to kill, that there was no evidence that defendant robbed the Bocanegras\n\nor that defendant had the specific intent to kill either the Bocanegras or Tatman.\n\nToton's closing argument following the guilt phase was equally extensive. He\n\nasserted there was insufficient evidence, as a matter of law, to prove beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that defendant committed the charged robberies and the\n\nBocanegra murders because the testimony of Hernandez and Trihey was not\n\ncredible. At best, he argued, the evidence in the Bocanegra murders supported a\n\nverdict of voluntary manslaughter. He also asserted that the prosecution had failed\n\nto prove the specific intent to kill necessary to support the special circumstance\n\nallegations.\n\nIt therefore appears that defense counsel's cross-examination was substantial, and\n\nthat he argued constantly that the facts as presented at the preliminary hearing\n\nshould be viewed as not supporting first degree murder convictions. These facts\n\nsupport the People's assertion that defendant's submission on the preliminary\n\nhearing transcripts for the guilt and special circumstance phases of the trial was\n\nnot tantamount to a guilty plea.

[Citation]\n\nId., at 29-30.\n\nThe state supreme court also concluded there was no requirement that Petitioner be\n\nadvised of ramifications of submission and waiver and the probability of conviction in light of\n\ndefendant's reservation of his right to present additional evidence and to contest his alleged guilt\n\nin argument to the court.

He supports this claim with facts alleged in claims 2, 4 and 6\n\nthrough 10. He reiterates his above claims that Toton and Frank did not conduct sufficient trial\n\ninvestigation and preparation. He claims Toton\u2019s agreement to allow additional evidence upon\n\nsubmission negated Toton\u2019s theory that submission on the preliminary hearing would limit\n\ndamaging evidence. (See SHCP Ex. 137, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16.) He claims that Frank had reservations\n\nabout waiving full defense, but did not express them to the trial court. (SHCP Ex. 113, \u00b6 \u00b6 13-\n\n\n\n19.) However, this Court finds that, for the reasons and based on the evidence discussed in\n\nclaims 1-13, ante, the state court could reasonably have found that defense counsel were not\n\ndeficient in preparing for trial and that the trial waiver was not necessarily inform on this basis..\n\nPetitioner alleges mental impairments prevented him from knowingly, voluntarily, and\n\nintelligently entering the waiver with complete knowledge of the relevant circumstances and\n\nlikely consequences. See Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 747\u201348 and n.4 (1970).\n\nHowever, the mental defense claim is unavailing for reasons discussed in claim 6. Petitioner\n\nagreed to submit the case following \u201cseveral long discussions\u201d with Toton, (SPet. Ex. 137, p.5)\n\nand in compromise of Petitioner\u2019s expressed desire to plead guilty (RT [5/16/88] 7), and Toton\u2019s\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 56 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n57\n\nrefusal to consent to a guilty plea. The trial judge discussed the submission with Petitioner in\n\nsome detail, including how it might impact his case (CT 889, 891-892; RT \u2013 65a-71a, 85a-89a,\n\n\n\n98a-115a.) and the waiver of any conflict of interest Toton might have had relating to his\n\ndebarment proceedings. (RT [7/27/88] 6.) Petitioner waived his trial rights on the record. (RT\n\n107a-111a.) The prosecution also examined him regarding the waivers. (RT 108a-114a.) It was\n\nnot unreasonable for the state court to conclude that Petitioner understood and freely entered the\n\nwaivers.\n\nPetitioner also fails to make an evidentiary showing of prejudice. He had expressed his\n\nintention to enter a guilty plea (RT [5/16/88] 7) and waive jury trial. (RT [7/27/88] 6.) Defense\n\ncounsel Frank\u2019s preparation of penalty phase defense was nearly complete at time of the trial\n\nwaiver and was not adversely affected. (SPet. Ex. 113, pp. 5-7.) Defense counsel could have\n\nreasonably believed that, as a matter of trial strategy, submission on the preliminary hearing\n\ntranscripts would limit damaging evidence, (SPet. Exhs. 137, pp. 4-5; 113, pp.4-5), keeping\n\n\u201csome of the blood and gore of the homicides away from the penalty jury.\u201d (SPet. Ex. 113, \u00b6 16.)\n\nEspecially so given Toton\u2019s concern that Reyes might testify against Petitioner, and Toton\u2019s\n\nbelief the aider and abettor theory might be more favorably decided by the court rather than a\n\njury. (SPet. Ex. 137, p. 5.)\n\nIn sum, the evidentiary record does not support a reasonable possibility that Petitioner\n\nwould have received a more favorable disposition had the matter gone to jury trial at the guilt\n\nand special circumstance phase. Had Petitioner testified before a jury as to lack of knowledge\n\nand intent in aiding and abetting the murders, he likely would have been impeached for reasons\n\ndiscussed in claims 1-13.\n\nFor the reasons stated, Petitioner has not established that defense counsel\u2019s performance\n\nfell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional\n\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.

Review of Claim 15\n\nPetitioner next claims ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to cross-examine\n\nnewspaper report Trihey, violating Petitioner\u2019s Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment\n\nrights.\n\nThe California Supreme Court summarily denied this claim (SPet. Claim L) as it was\n\nraised in Petitioner\u2019s state petition for habeas corpus. In re Sanchez, S049502 (DD.) That court\n\nalso rejected on appeal Petitioner\u2019s contention that Toton\u2019s failure to cross-examine Trihey\n\nbefore closing argument denied him the effective assistance of counsel, finding that:\n\nToton convinced the court during his closing argument that Trihey's testimony\n\nshould not be given substantial weight; his decision not to cross-examine Trihey\n\nas to the contents of the published material was sound strategy, given the nature\n\nof defendant's alleged contradictory statements. Defendant does not establish that\n\ncross-examination would have revealed any new information, or that any\n\nadditional information about the interviews would have influenced the court's\n\njudgment. Hence, we cannot find counsel's failure to cross-examination Trihey to\n\nbe deficient. In any event, given the fact that the court dismissed the robbery\n\ncharges against defendant, and found not true the robbery-murder specialcircumstance\n\nallegation, we discern no prejudice to defendant based on counsel's\n\nperformance. [Citation]\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th 59.\n\n\n\nPetitioner supports this claim with facts alleged in claims 2 and 4. He alleges that had\n\nToton cross-examined Trihey on the published newspaper articles he could have called into\n\nquestion the version of events offered by Trihey and Hernandez, and supported Petitioner\u2019s\n\nmental defenses. (Pet. \u00b6 306-314.)\n\nStrickland provides that \u201cstrategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and\n\nfacts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690-91.\n\n\u201c[S]trategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the\n\nextent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.\u201d Id.\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 58 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n59\n\nPetitioner argues cross-examination regarding the contents of the newspaper articles,\n\ncross-examination Toton refused under conditions imposed by the Court (limiting such to the\n\nprinted articles \u2013 see RT 57-59) would have been beneficial, but he does not demonstrate how or\n\nwhy this is so given his contradictory statements of the crimes and his involvement.\n\n\n\nTrihey testified at the guilt and special circumstance phase that during the course of five\n\ninterviews, Petitioner stated he was \u201ca triple murderer\u201d and that the victims were killed for their\n\n\u201cSocial Security checks.\u201d (RT 17-18). These statements were included in the published articles.\n\n(Id.) Based on the record before it, the state court could reasonably have found that any claimed\n\nadvantage that would have resulted from cross-examination of Trihey was speculative. It\n\nfollows that the decision of defense counsel not to cross-examine Trihey could be seen as neither\n\nunreasonable nor prejudicial.\n\nThe trial judge limited any cross-examination to the confession and information\n\npublished by Trihey in the newspaper. Unable to impeach Trihey, defense counsel could\n\nreasonably have concluded that cross-examination might highlight inconsistencies in Petitioner\u2019s\n\nversions of how the murders occurred, bolstering both the direct examination and the damaging\n\ntestimony of Hernandez. Moreover, defense counsel Toton, during closing argument, argued\n\neffectively to limit the impact of Trihey\u2019s testimony regarding robbery, (RT 175-183), and the\n\nrobbery-murder special circumstance. Petitioner cannot show prejudice where he fails to state\n\nwith specificity the nature of the proposed testimony. Alcala v. Woodford, 334 F.3d 862, 872-73\n\n(9th Cir. 2003); see also Bragg v. Galaza, 242 F.3d 1082, 1088 (9th Cir. 2001) (mere speculation\n\nof possible helpful information from potential witnesses is not sufficient to show ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel).\n\nAdditionally, for the reasons discussed in claims 1 through 4 and 6, the evidence does not\n\nsupport a reasonable possibility that Petitioner would have received a more favorable disposition\n\non sufficiency of the evidence, actual innocence and mental states defenses by cross-examining\n\nTrihey. Instead, defense counsel could have reasonably believed that cross-examining Trihey as\n\nto mental state defenses, unsupported in the record, might serve only to reinforce the published\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 59 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n60\n\nconfession.\n\nPetitioner was not prejudiced by failing to Toton\u2019s failure to cross-examine Trihey. The\n\ntrial court\u2019s guilt phase verdicts, rejecting robbery and robbery special circumstance counts in the\n\nBocanegra homicides, reflect its acceptance of Toton\u2019s argument that Trihey\u2019s testimony should\n\nnot be given substantial weight. (RT 235-236.) Trihey\u2019s testimony likely would not have\n\nchanged the outcome.\n\nAccordingly, the Court finds the state court rejection of the claim was neither contrary to,\n\nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n\nCourt, nor based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented\n\nin the state court proceeding, viewed most favoring the prosecution. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nClaim 15 is denied.\n\nl. Review of Claim 16\n\nIn his next claim, Petitioner alleges ineffective assistance of counsel by failure to argue\n\nfor second degree Murder in Bocanegra homicides, violating his Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and\n\nFourteenth Amendment rights.\n\nThe California Supreme Court summarily denied this claim (SPet. Claim M) raised in\n\nPetitioner\u2019s state petition for habeas corpus. In re Sanchez, S049502 (DD). As noted, in such a\n\ncase \u201cthe habeas petitioner\u2019s burden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis\n\nfor the state court to deny relief,\u201d Richter, 562 U.S. at 98, and this Court \u201cmust determine what\n\narguments or theories supported or . . . could have supported, the state court\u2019s decision; and then\n\nit must ask whether it is possible fair-minded jurists could disagree that those arguments or\n\ntheories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this Court.\u201d Id. (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\nPetitioner claims that Toton should have argued for lesser included second degree murder\n\nbecause evidence he premeditated the murders was insufficient. (RT 168-196.) He supports this\n\n\n\nclaim with facts alleged in claims 2 and 4, ante. However, Petitioner has not established actual\n\ninnocence, or that the evidence was insufficient to support the premeditated and deliberate\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 60 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n61\n\nmurder of the Bocanegras. (See claims 1 through 4, ante.) Second degree murder was in any\n\nevent a lesser included option, necessarily rejected by the trial court in its finding of first degree\n\nmurder. (RT 235-236.)\n\nThe Court finds it was not unreasonable for Toton to argue voluntary manslaughter (RT\n\n168-196), foregoing argument of second degree murder, given his theory that a sudden heated\n\nargument between Mr. Bocanegra and Joey led to the killings. (CT 77-78, 479, 487, 500, 590;\n\nRT 97, 132-33, 188-193, 195-96.) Given the support in the evidentiary record for the\n\nmanslaughter argument, the state court could reasonably have determined Toton\u2019s failure to\n\nargue for second degree murder was not ineffective assistance.\n\n\n\nThe state court could reasonably have determined that Petitioner was not prejudiced by\n\nToton\u2019s failure to argue for second degree murder. Though Petitioner contends in this claim that\n\nhe was willing to accept any non-capital conviction, this position is not consistent with his stated\n\ndesire to plead guilty to the Bocanegra murders. (SPet. Ex. 520, p. 2; 700.) Petitioner waived\n\njury trial and submitted guilt and special circumstances phase on the preliminary hearing\n\ntranscript and the testimony of additional prosecution witnesses. See Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 23-\n\n30. The evidence does not suggest a reasonable probability that argument for second degree\n\nmurder would have resulted in a more favorable disposition for Petitioner given the substantial\n\nevidence against him, his incriminating statements to detective Stratton and reporter Trihey and\n\nthe crime scene evidence corroborated by Hernandez\u2019s testimony. (See claims 1-10.)\n\nThe Court notes that Toton\u2019s motion for acquittal based upon sufficiency of the evidence\n\nwas denied by the trial court. (RT 140-141.) Toton\u2019s argument in closing, revisiting\n\ninsufficiency of the evidence, was also unsuccessful.\n\nAccordingly, a fair-minded jurist could have found that Petitioner failed to establish that\n\ndefense counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that, but\n\nfor counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S., at 687-694.\n\nIt does not appear that the state court rejection of the claim was contrary to, or an\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 61 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n62\n\nunreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n\nCourt, or that the state court's ruling was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in\n\nlight of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.

Review of Claim 17\n\nPetitioner next claims ineffective assistance of counsel by failure to object to improper\n\nprosecution closing at the guilt and special circumstances phase, violating his Fifth, Sixth, Eighth\n\nand Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n\nThe California Supreme Court summarily denied this claim (SPet. Claim N) raised in\n\nPetitioner\u2019s state petition for habeas corpus. In re Sanchez, S049502 (DD.) As noted, in such a\n\ncase \u201cthe habeas petitioner\u2019s burden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis\n\nfor the state court to deny relief,\u201d Richter, 562 U.S. at 98, and this Court \u201cmust determine what\n\narguments or theories supported or . . . could have supported, the state court\u2019s decision; and then\n\nit must ask whether it is possible fair-minded jurists could disagree that those arguments or\n\ntheories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this Court.\u201d Id. (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\nPetitioner alleges that the prosecutor\u2019s argument, that there were only two people, other\n\nthan the Bocanegras, present at the time of the killings, was false and misleading. Petitioner\n\nstates that the prosecution presented evidence of Reyes\u2019s bloody palm print on the door knob\n\ninside the Bocanegra home. (CT 202-203.) Yet Toton failed to object because he wrongly\n\nassessed the evidence. (SHCP Ex. 137, \u00b6 30.) Defense counsel Frank did not object because he\n\nwas responsible only for the penalty phase. (SHCP Ex. 113, \u00b6 27.)\n\nThis Court is not convinced. Physical evidence that Reyes was in the Bocanegra home is\n\nnot inconsistent with the evidence that Reyes served as a lookout and entered the Bocanegra\n\nhome after the homicides to assist Joey and Petitioner. (SResp. Ex. A, pp.3-4; see claim 10.)\n\nThe prosecution\u2019s argument then was not inconsistent with the evidence. Toton could\n\nreasonably have concluded that the prosecution\u2019s \u201ctwo person\u201d argument was not objectionable\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 62 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n63\n\nas false or misleading based on the record.

(CT 482-483, 504; RT 190-91.) Counsel is not ineffective for failing to\n\nmake an objection that would be overruled. See United States v. Steele, 785 F.2d 743, 750 (9th\n\nCir. 1986). \u201cIn any ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate must be directly\n\nassessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to\n\ncounsel's judgments.\u201d Strickland, at 691.\n\nPetitioner does not demonstrate by evidence in the record that Toton failed to reasonably\n\ninvestigate these matters. \u201c[S]trategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts\n\nrelevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S at 690-91.\n\nEven if he had, \u201cstrategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable\n\nprecisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on\n\ninvestigation.\u201d Id. Toton could reasonably have concluded further investigation would have\n\nbeen futile given the weight of the evidence against Petitioner.\n\n\n\nToton could have considered the prosecution argument, that there was no evidence\n\nanyone other than Joey and Petitioner committed the Bocanegra homicides, to be consistent with\n\nthe evidence and not unreasonable. Moreover, Toton did argue an inference from the evidence,\n\nthat Mrs. Bocanegra\u2019s scalp wounds were inflicted by someone other than Petitioner, (RT 191),\n\nand that there was insufficient evidence to show Petitioner inflicted the wounds.\n\nThere is no sufficient showing that Petitioner was prejudiced by Toton\u2019s alleged failure to\n\nobject to the prosecutor\u2019s guilt and special circumstance closing argument that there were only\n\ntwo perpetrators in the Bocanegra homicides. The evidentiary record contains substantial\n\nevidence against Petitioner, his incriminating statements to detective Stratton and reporter Trihey\n\nand the crime scene evidence corroborated by Hernandez\u2019s testimony.

As noted, in such a\n\ncase \u201cthe habeas petitioner\u2019s burden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis\n\nfor the state court to deny relief,\u201d Richter, 562 U.S. at 98, and this Court \u201cmust determine what\n\narguments or theories supported or . . . could have supported, the state court\u2019s decision; and then\n\nit must ask whether it is possible fair-minded jurists could disagree that those arguments or\n\ntheories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this Court.\u201d Id. (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\nPetitioner claims that Toton\u2019s failure to seek a continuance to conduct guilt phase\n\ninvestigation, and failure to present complete defenses based on physical evidence, mental state,\n\nand testimony from Joey, Seeley, and Hernandez had the cumulative effect of denying Petitioner\n\na full trial at the guilt and special circumstance phase and possibility of a plea bargain. Petitioner\n\nbases this claim on facts alleged in claims 2, 4, and 6 through 17, ante.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court has clearly established that the combined effect of multiple trial\n\nerrors may give rise to a due process violation if it renders a trial fundamentally unfair, even\n\nwhere each error considered individually would not require reversal.\u201d Parle v. Runnels, 505 F.3d\n\n922, 928 (9th Cir. 2007) (citing Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 643 (1974)).\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 64 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n65\n\nThe cumulative effect of trial court errors can be a basis for habeas relief in certain\n\ncircumstances:\n\nAlthough individual errors looked at separately may not rise to the level of\n\nreversible error, their cumulative effect may nevertheless be so prejudicial as to\n\nrequire reversal. United States v. Necoechea, 986 F.2d 1273, 1282 (9th Cir.\n\n1993). However, the fact that errors have been committed during a trial does not\n\nmean that reversal is required. [W]hile a defendant is entitled to a fair trial, [she]\n\nis not entitled to a perfect trial, for there are no perfect trials. United States v.\n\nPayne, 944 F.2d 1458, 1477 (9th Cir. 1991).\n\nU.S. v. de Cruz, 82, F.3d 856, 868 (9th Cir. 1996).\n\nHere, there is not a need to employ cumulative error analysis because review has detected\n\nno error, for the reasons discussed in claims 2, 4 and 6-17. Petitioner has not established that the\n\nevidence before the trial court showed defense counsel Toton was ineffective. These claims are\n\ninsubstantial whether considered singlely or cumulatively. See United States v. Karterman, 60\n\nF.3d 576, 580 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201cBecause each error is, at best, marginal, we cannot conclude that\n\ntheir cumulative effect was \u2018so prejudicial\u2019 to [defendant] that reversal is warranted.\u201d); see also\n\nRupe v. Wood, 93 F.3d 1434, 1445 (9th Cir. 1995); Detrich v. Ryan, 740 F.3d 1237, 1273 (9th\n\nCir. 2013). Cumulative error analysis applies where there are two or more actual errors. It does\n\nnot apply . . . to the cumulative effect of non-errors.\u201d Moore v. Gibson, 195 F.3d 1152, 1175\n\n(10th Cir. 1999) (quoting Castro v. Ward, 138 F.3d 810, 832 (10th Cir. 1998)).\n\n\n\nAccordingly, Petitioner has not established that defense counsel\u2019s cumulative\n\nperformance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that, but for counsel's\n\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Strickland, 466\n\nU.S., at 687-694. Petitioner\u2019s reliance on Cargle v. Mullin, 317 F.3d 1196, 1210 (10th Cir.\n\n2003), a case readily distinguished on the facts of ineffective assistance, is misplaced.\n\nRespondent contends this claim is not cognizable because it creates and retroactively\n\napplies a \u201cnew rule\u201d of constitutional law within Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288. However, the\n\nCourt finds the claim fails not because Petitioner seeks to apply a new rule of criminal procedure\n\nunder Teague, but rather on grounds the claim lacks merit for the reasons stated.\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 65 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n66\n\nClaim 18 is denied.\n\n5. Denial Of Effective Assistance Of Counsel \u2013 Claims 19-27\n\n\n\nIn claims 19 through 27, Petitioner alleges that during the guilt and special circumstance\n\nphase he was denied effective assistance of defense counsel.\n\na. Clearly Established Law\n\nA breakdown in the attorney-client relationship can result in a denial of the right to\n\neffective assistance of counsel. Frazer v. United States, 18 F.3d 778, 782-83, 785 (9th Cir.\n\n1994); see also Brown v. Craven, 424 F.2d. 1166, 1169-70 (9th Cir. 1970) (trial court\u2019s failure to\n\nconduct inquiry into irreconcilable conflict arising from the client\u2019s refusal to communicate or\n\ncooperate with counsel resulted in denial of effective assistance of counsel).\n\nThe Sixth Amendment requires an appropriate, on the record, inquiry into the grounds for\n\nsuch a motion, and that the matter be resolved on the merits before the case goes forward. Schell\n\nv. Witek, 218 F.3d 1017, 1025, citing Smith v. Lockhart, 923 F.2d 1314, 1320 (8th Cir. 1991)).\n\nThe overarching constitutional question is whether the attorney-client conflict has become so\n\ngreat that \u201cit resulted in a total lack of communication or other significant impediment that\n\nresulted in turn in an attorney-client relationship that fell short of that required by the Sixth\n\nAmendment.\u201d Id., at 1026.\n\nb. Review of Claim 19\n\nPetitioner claims trial court error by denial, without adequate investigation, of defense\n\ncounsel\u2019s motions to withdraw depriving him of effective assistance of counsel, violating his\n\nSixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n\nThe state supreme court considered this claim on appeal and found that the trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in denying defense counsel\u2019s two motions to withdraw, as follows:\n\n[I]mplicit in the court's denial of the motions is the finding that defendant's\n\ndiscussion of his case with the media was not an indication of his distrust or\n\ndissatisfaction with counsel. Rather, the conduct was merely indicative of his\n\nunwavering desire to admit culpability and to atone for his crimes. Indeed,\n\nallowing counsel to withdraw would not have alleviated any prejudice to\n\ndefendant caused by his contact with the press, nor does the record indicate that\n\ndenying the motion to withdraw influenced defendant's desire to submit the guilt\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 66 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n67\n\nissue on the basis of the preliminary hearing transcripts. Even though counsel\n\nwere dissatisfied with defendant's failure to heed their advice and not discuss the\n\ncase with the media, the record shows defendant's right to counsel was not\n\njeopardized by counsel's continuing representation. Thus, because defendant does\n\nnot show that any disagreement with counsel resulted in a complete breakdown in\n\nthe attorney-client relationship that jeopardized his right to a fair trial, we\n\nconclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying counsels' motions\n\nto withdraw. [Citation] In reviewing denial of motion to substitute attorneys, the\n\ncourt \u201cfocuses on the ruling itself and the record on which it is made. It does not\n\nlook to subsequent matters . . . .\u201d]\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 37.\n\nPetitioner alleges that his out-of-court actions revealed a complete breakdown in his\n\nrelationship with counsel and that his lack of trust and confidence was not unfounded as counsel\n\nignored his serious mental disturbances which should have been obvious. Petitioner notified\n\ndefense counsel of his intent to speak to the media on February 2, 1988. Later that day counsel\n\nmet with Petitioner and advised against contacting the media. After the meeting, counsel\n\ndiscovered Petitioner had given an interview to Michael Trihey, reporter for the Bakersfield\n\nCalifornian newspaper, earlier that day. That interview led to a front-page story published on\n\nFebruary 12, 1988.\n\nOn February 16, 1988, defense counsel filed a motion to withdraw, asserting Petitioner\n\nhad indicated he did not trust counsel and actively mislead them by failing to inform them he had\n\nalready given an interview to Trihey, Petitioner\u2019s refusal to cooperate rendered his representation\n\n\n\nvirtually impossible, and their attorney-client relationship was so tainted counsel\u2019s efforts would\n\nbe of no assistance. However, the Court denied the motion because it found no breakdown in the\n\nattorney-client relationship and that any prejudice created by Petitioner\u2019s contacting the press\n\nagainst counsel\u2019s advice would not be ameliorated by counsel\u2019s withdrawal. On March 7, 1988\n\nthe trial court, before denying the initial motion to withdraw, questioned Petitioner about\n\nwhether he trusted defense counsel. Petitioner responded that \u201c[he was] willing to stay with\n\nthem.\u201d (CT 690, 707-708; RT [3/7/88] 4-5.)\n\nOn April 25, 1988, another article by Trihey was published in the Bakersfield Californian\n\nthat asserted that Petitioner said he was a triple killer who deserved to die and described\n\nPetitioner\u2019s legal predicament of not being able to plead guilty and accept the death penalty\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 67 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n68\n\nwithout his counsel\u2019s consent.\n\n\n\nOn May 2, 1988, counsel again moved to withdraw, asserting continued representation\n\nwould require unethical conduct by counsel. The trial judge met with defense counsel and\n\nPetitioner regarding counsel\u2019s renewed motions to withdraw. The court denied Toton\u2019s motion\n\non the merits on that day. (CT 707; RT [5/6/88] 3.) Four days later the Court denied Frank\u2019s\n\nmotion due to \u201cnearness of the trial date.\u201d (CT 708; RT [5/10/88] 5.) The trial court had\n\npreviously noted that substitution of counsel would not alleviate any prejudice to the case already\n\nresulting from Petitioner\u2019s discussions with report Trihey. (RT [3/7/88] 5.) On June 22, 1988,\n\nthe Court of Appeal of the State of California, Fifth Appellate District, denied Petitioner\u2019s\n\npetition for writ of mandate and/or prohibition, seeking an order directing the trial court to grant\n\ncounsel\u2019s motions to withdraw. (CT 768.)\n\nHere, the state court could reasonably have found that any disagreement with counsel was\n\nnot so great that it resulted in a complete breakdown in the attorney-client relationship\n\njeopardizing his right to effective representation and a fair trial. (CT 690; RT [3/7/88] 4-5.) The\n\ncontention of defense counsel in their initial (February 1988) motion that the newspaper article\n\nreflected a lack of trust and cooperation (RT March 7, 1988 at pp. 3-4; CT 685-686) was\n\ncountered by Petitioner during his colloquy with the trial court. Petitioner stated to the trial judge\n\nthat, \u201c[t]here is a little bit of mistrust there, but you know, I\u2019m willing to stay with them, if they\n\nwant out, you know, I won\u2019t stop them.\u201d (RT March 7, 1988 at pp. 4-5; CT 685-686.)\n\nPetitioner\u2019s assertion that the trial court erred by treating the newspaper interview as the\n\nsole issue, failing to investigate and address the more pervasive problem of mistrust, is\n\nunavailing. Toton\u2019s February 1988 withdrawal motion, which raised a lack of trust and\n\nconfidence as a result of the newspaper article, was denied by the trial court on the merits (CT\n\n707; RT May 6, 10, and June 24, 1988 at p. 3) following the trial court\u2019s above noted discussion\n\nof these very issues with Petitioner. (RT March 7, 1988 at pp. 4-5; CT 685-686.)\n\n Petitioner also contends that the second motion to withdraw, brought by Frank in May\n\n1988 and joined in by Toton, was improperly denied. He points out that this motion was\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 68 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n69\n\nunopposed and that the trial court delayed reaching the motion and ultimately did not reach the\n\nmerits. Frank\u2019s May 1988 withdrawal motion, brought on ethical grounds relating to possibly\n\nperjurous testimony, (CT 694-696; URT6\n\n(Frank) [5/6/88] 2-8), joined in by Toton, was denied\n\nby the trial court following ex parte in camera hearing because it was too close to trial. (CT 708-\n\n710; RT May 6, 10, and June 24, 1988, at p. 5.) However, the request was devoid of facts\n\nshowing the nature and basis for relief requested. (RT May 10, 1988, pp. 4-5, 7-8.) Any ethical\n\ndilemma involving perjurous testimony would not likely have been resolved by appointing\n\nreplacement counsel, and the trial court recognized as much. (URT (Frank) [5/6//88] 4-6.)\n\nPetitioner does not allege or support an ethical violation. Even if he had, a lawyer\u2019s violation of\n\nethical norms does not make the lawyer per se ineffective. Burt v. Titlow, 134 S. Ct. 10, 18\n\n(2013).\n\nMoreover, as with the earlier motion to withdraw, Petitioner was ambivalent, neither\n\nseeking nor objecting to withdrawal. (URT (Frank) [5/6/88] 9; RT [5/6/88] 2.) Petitioner\u2019s\n\ncontention his defense waiver was a product of ineffective assistance (Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 377-380) is refuted\n\nby his expressed desire to plead guilty. (RT [7/27/88] 6-7; URT (Toton) [5/6/88] 2.)\n\nPetitioner\u2019s suggestion that he lacked confidence in counsel because they ignored his\n\nmental disturbance was not communicated by him to the court and counsel and is not supported\n\nby any proffer in the evidentiary record. Petitioner neither sought nor objected to withdrawal of\n\ndefense counsel Toton and Frank, (RT [5/6/88]2), and had expressed his desire to enter a guilty\n\nplea. (RT [5/16/88] 7.) In accordance therewith, trial was waived on the guilt and special\n\n\n\ncircumstances phase. (RT [7/27/88] 6-7.) The state court could reasonably have determined that\n\nwithdrawal would not have ameliorated any prejudice from Petitioner\u2019s contacting the press, or\n\naffected Petitioner\u2019s submission on the preliminary hearing. Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 36-37. On\n\nthis basis Petitioner\u2019s right to counsel was not placed by jeopardy by the continued\n\nrepresentation of defense counsel.\n\nRespondent contends this claim is not cognizable because it creates and retroactively\n\n6 The term \u201cURT\u201d is a reference to Unsealed Reporter\u2019s Transcripts of ex parte in camera proceedings.\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 69 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n70\n\napplies a \u201cnew rule\u201d of constitutional law within Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288. However, the\n\nCourt finds the claim fails not because Petitioner seeks to apply a new rule of criminal procedure\n\nunder Teague, but rather on grounds the claim lacks merit for the reasons stated.\n\n\n\nFor the reasons stated, the state court rejection of the claim was neither contrary to, or an\n\nunreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n\nCourt, nor an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the\n\nstate court proceeding. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nClaim 19 is denied.\n\nc. Review of Claim 20\n\nIn claim 20, Petitioner alleges ineffective assistance of counsel by complete breakdown\n\nin the attorney/client relationship violating his Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n\nThe California Supreme Court summarily denied this claim (SPet. Claim Q) raised in\n\nPetitioner\u2019s state petition for habeas corpus. In re Sanchez, S049502 (DD). The state supreme\n\ncourt, in its decision on direct appeal, considered Toton\u2019s disciplinary proceedings and noted the\n\nfollowing trial court discussion:\n\n\u201cThe Court: One of the things that concerns me about this incident is the fact of\n\nthe date of August 25th and the fact that a jury trial was waived in this case, and\n\nnow we're at that stage of the case where a [Penal Code section] 1118.1 is under\n\nsubmission. And I suppose somebody reviewing this case could say one of the\n\nreasons maybe that Mr. Toton suggested that the jury trial be waived was the fact\n\nthat the trial could be completed prior to the time that the Californian suggests\n\nthat there's going to be some kind of a ruling in his case. As-and clearly if we had\n\nhad a jury, we would still have been going at that time, and I really seriously\n\ndoubt whether we would have been in a position even to have begun to take\n\nevidence as of the 25th day of August. That situation worried me a little bit.\n\n\u201cAnd I wonder if you have discussed this with your client.\n\n\u201cMr. Frank: Yes, your Honor. I advised [defendant] that the article certainly did\n\nimply that Mr. Toton's motivation for pursuing the presentation of the case in the\n\nmanner in which he has, at least indicated, that perhaps he did that because of his\n\nown personal problems, plans or agenda.\n\n\u201cI advised [defendant] that he had the right to be represented by an attorney who\n\nwas completely and absolutely free from any sort of conflict, that [defendant] had\n\nthe right to have an attorney whose decision-making process was unfettered by\n\nany of his own personal plans or problems, and that he had the right to have an\n\nattorney whose representation and whose decision-making process was based not\n\non any of the attorney's considerations but on the best interests of [defendant], the\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 70 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n71\n\nclient in this case.\u201d\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 38.\n\nPetitioner revisits allegations in claim 19 regarding Toton\u2019s disciplinary issues, and\n\nproffers an unsigned declaration of defense expert Isabel Wright that defense counsel disbelieved\n\nand disregarded Petitioner. (SHCP Ex. 131, Att. B, \u00b6 6-9.) However, even if competent\n\nevidence, Wright\u2019s testimony is controverted by that of defense counsel Toton (SHCP Ex. 137,\n\np. 8) and Frank (SHCP Ex. 113, \u00b6 6), that apart from the media interview issue, the attorneyclient\n\nrelationship was a cooperative one. Moreover, the record shows that the trial court\n\nquestioned Petitioner to verify that he had spoken to Frank about the disciplinary proceedings,\n\nthat he had read the Bakersfield Californian article, and that he was unaware of any disciplinary\n\naction against Toton prior to the date of the article. The court asked Petitioner if he believed the\n\narticle implied that \u201cone reason Mr. Toton was pushing this case forward was because of his own\n\npersonal time considerations.\u201d Petitioner replied: \u201cNot really sir, because we had discussed-you\n\nknow, this was part- I wanted to go this way in the beginning anyway. So there was really-I\n\nnever really felt that he was doing it for his own incidences [sic].\u201d Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 39.\n\nThe trial court discussed with Petitioner his earlier position that it was his idea alone to\n\n\n\n\u201cwaive the jury under any circumstances.\u201d Petitioner told the trial court that he wanted to waive\n\njury trial on the guilty and special circumstances phase and that the idea started with him and not\n\ndefense counsel. (RT [7/27/88] 6-7.)\n\nThe trial court discussed with Petitioner whether he wanted to make a motion for mistrial\n\n\u201cand for certain other motions in view of the publicity that this has gotten?\u201d The following\n\ncolloquy took place:\n\n\u201cThe Court: What I'm concerned [about] is that something will happen down the\n\nline and then you will say, gee, I didn't know what I was doing; I should have\n\nasked for a mistrial at that point in time. That would probably be too late, because\n\nI'm probably getting an indication that you want to waive any problems that Mr.\n\nToton's difficulties might have in this case.

As noted by the state supreme\n\ncourt, \u201c[i]n order to establish a violation of the right to effective assistance of counsel, a\n\ndefendant must show that counsel's performance was inadequate when measured against the\n\nstandard of a reasonably competent attorney, and that counsel's performance prejudiced\n\ndefendant's case in such a manner that his representation \u201cso undermined the proper functioning\n\nof the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u201d\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 686. The record above does not support such a finding.\n\nMoreover, \u201ca court need not determine whether counsel's performance was deficient\n\nbefore examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies.\u201d\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at p. 697. Prejudice is shown when there is a \u201creasonable probability that,\n\nbut for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A\n\nreasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d In re\n\nSixto (1989) 48 Cal.3d 1247, 1257; Strickland, 466 U.S. at p. 694. If defendant fails to show\n\nthat he was prejudiced by counsel's performance, the ineffective assistance claim may be rejected\n\nwithout determining whether counsel's performance was inadequate.

In rejecting this claim on\n\nappeal, the state supreme court pointed out that:\n\n[Petitioner] does not assert that Toton's pending discipline prejudiced his case.\n\nThe record would not support such an argument. Toton vigorously crossexamined\n\nprosecution witnesses at the preliminary hearing and during the guilt\n\nphase, made several defense motions, including one for appointed assistant\n\ncounsel, which was granted, and motions for pretrial discovery, severance and\n\nadditional motions that indicated he was vigorously representing his client. In\n\naddition, Toton made a comprehensive closing argument at the guilt phase. Thus,\n\nthere is no indication on the record that counsel's representation was anything less\n\nthan competent, and defendant fails to persuade us that counsel's representation\n\n\n\nwas ineffective solely on the basis of the disciplinary action pending against him .\n\n. . Toton was a member of the State Bar at all times during his representation of\n\ndefendant. \u201c 'Erring morally or by a breach of professional ethics does not\n\nnecessarily indicate a lack of knowledge of the law.'\u201d [Citation] We simply are\n\nnot persuaded that Toton's unrelated disciplinary problems in any way influenced\n\nhis representation of defendant or otherwise rendered him unfit as a matter of law.\n\n[Citation]\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 43-45.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s contention that defense counsel found him uncooperative is refuted by Mr.\n\nFrank\u2019s declaration where he said that, except for the media interviews, Petitioner was\n\ncooperative with defense counsel. (SPet. Ex. 113, p. 3.) As to the alleged ethical dilemma, as\n\nnoted a lawyer\u2019s violation of ethical norms does not make the lawyer per se ineffective. Burt,\n\n134 S. Ct. at 18.\n\nRespondent contends this claim is not cognizable because it creates and retroactively\n\napplies a \u201cnew rule\u201d of constitutional law within Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288. However, the\n\nCourt finds the claim fails not because Petitioner seeks to apply a new rule of criminal procedure\n\nunder Teague, but rather on grounds the claim lacks merit for the reasons stated.\n\nThe Court finds that, the reasons discussed, the state court rejection of the claim was\n\nneither contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as\n\ndetermined by the Supreme Court, nor an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n\nevidence presented in the state court proceeding.

Claims P, R\n\nand S respectively) raised in Petitioner\u2019s state petition for habeas corpus. In re Sanchez,\n\nS049502 (DD). As noted, in such a case \u201cthe habeas petitioner\u2019s burden still must be met by\n\nshowing there was no reasonable basis for the state court to deny relief,\u201d Richter, 562 U.S. at 98,\n\nand this Court \u201cmust determine what arguments or theories supported or . . . could have\n\nsupported, the state court\u2019s decision; and then it must ask whether it is possible fair-minded\n\njurists could disagree that those arguments or theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior\n\ndecision of this Court.\u201d Id. (emphasis added).\n\nThe state supreme court, in reviewing these issues on direct appeal, noted that:\n\nDefendant's claim that Toton's disciplinary proceedings rendered him\n\nincompetent is no more persuasive if considered under the rubric of conflict of\n\ninterest. A criminal defendant's right to effective assistance of counsel,\n\nguaranteed by both the state and federal Constitutions, includes the right to\n\nrepresentation free from conflicts of interest. [Citation] To establish a violation\n\nof the right to unconflicted counsel under the federal Constitution, 'a defendant\n\nwho raised no objection at trial must demonstrate that an actual conflict of\n\ninterest adversely affected his lawyer's performance.' [Citation] To establish a\n\nviolation of the same right under our state Constitution, a defendant need only\n\nshow that the record supports an 'informed speculation' that counsel's\n\nrepresentation of the defendant was adversely affected by the claimed conflict of\n\ninterest. [Citation]\n\n\n\n[W]e also observed that \u201c[c]onflicts of interest may arise in various factual\n\nsettings. Broadly, they 'embrace all situations in which an attorney's loyalty to, or\n\nefforts on behalf of, a client are threatened by his responsibilities to another\n\nclient or a third person or by his own interests.'\u201d [Citation]\n\nDefendant contends that the alleged conflict of interest between himself and\n\nToton was caused by Toton's \u201cown interest\u201d in expediting the trial prior to his\n\ndisbarment, to the defendant's prejudice. Defendant asserts that the fact of the\n\npending disciplinary action gave Toton a strong incentive to finish defendant's\n\ncase as quickly as possible, implying that Toton's desire to end the case led to a\n\nconstitutionally deficient performance.\n\nBased on the appellate record, we are not persuaded by defendant's arguments.\n\nAs we have observed, the record shows that Toton was not disbarred until eight\n\nmonths after the court and defendant learned of the proceedings against him, and\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 74 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n\n\n75\n\none month after completion of the penalty phase of defendant's trial. There is no\n\nindication that the disciplinary proceedings influenced the pace of Toton's\n\nrepresentation, and, indeed, there is substantial evidence on record that would\n\nsupport the opposite conclusion.\n\nFirst and foremost, it was Toton who advised defendant not to plead guilty and\n\ninstead to submit the guilt and special circumstance issues on the basis of the\n\npreliminary hearing transcripts. This alternative to a guilty plea allowed counsel\n\nto contest the People's case, present various defense motions to the court, and\n\ngenerally make a stronger case for defendant than would have been available\n\nfollowing a guilty plea. Thus, counsel Toton actually prolonged the trial\n\nnotwithstanding defendant's desire to proceed directly to the penalty phase.\n\nMoreover, even if we were to perceive either an actual conflict of interest, as\n\nrequired by federal law, or to conclude the record supports an \u201cinformed\n\nspeculation\u201d of a conflict as required under our state Constitution, defendant\n\nintentionally and knowingly waived any conflict on the record. [Citation]\n\nIn addition, defense counsel Frank informed the court he was satisfied that\n\nToton's pending discipline \u201chad nothing to do with the waiver of the jury trial.\u201d\n\nAt a later in camera hearing attended by defense counsel Frank, defendant\n\nadmitted that, in partially submitting his case, it was his desire to waive jury trial\n\n\u201cunder any circumstances,\u201d that he had had a \u201clengthy discussion\u201d regarding his\n\nrights with defense counsel Frank, and that he wanted to maintain the status quo.\n\nThe fact that defendant did not discuss Toton's pending discipline with him does\n\nnot assist defendant's conflict claim. Here, defendant asserts that his \u201cdiscussion\n\nwith Frank could not substitute for a discussion with Toton. By his own\n\nadmission, Frank knew nothing about his co-counsel's impending [discipline]\n\nuntil the news appeared on the front page of the Bakersfield newspaper . . . .\n\nToton hid this important fact from his own assistant counsel until the news\n\nbecame public. Nothing in the record indicates that Frank knew any more about\n\nthe [discipline] than did the readers of the Bakersfield Californian. Frank simply\n\nwas not able to speak for Toton in discussing the impact of the [disciplinary\n\nproceedings] on the future conduct of the defense [nor was] Frank in [a] position\n\nto discuss with [defendant] how the [disciplinary] proceedings already might\n\nhave affected Toton's guilt phase strategy.\u201d Defendant fails to show, however,\n\nhow Toton's assurances or perspective would have assisted him in determining\n\nwhether he wanted to waive the conflict, or how Toton would have provided him\n\nwith a better explanation than that given by the court about the potential\n\ndrawbacks of Toton's continued representation.\n\nDefendant next asserts that the trial court failed in its duty to ensure that he\n\n\n\nknowingly and intelligently waived any conflict with counsel. \u201cWhen a trial\n\ncourt knows or should know that defense counsel has a possible conflict of\n\ninterest with his client, it must inquire into the matter [citations] and act in\n\nresponse to what its inquiry discovers [Citation].\u201d If the court determines that a\n\nwaiver of a conflict is necessary, it must satisfy itself that \u201c '(1) the defendant has\n\ndiscussed the potential drawbacks of [potentially conflicted] representation with\n\nhis attorney, or if he wishes, outside counsel, (2) that he has been made aware of\n\nthe dangers and possible consequences of [such] representation in his case, (3)\n\nthat he knows of his right to conflict-free representation, and (4) that he\n\nvoluntarily wishes to waive that right.'\u201d [Citation] A trial court's failure to inquire\n\ninto the conflict or to adequately respond to its inquiry amounts to reversible\n\nerror if the defendant can show \u201cthat an actual conflict of interest existed and that\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 75 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n\n\n76\n\nthat conflict adversely affected counsel's performance.\u201d [Citation]\n\nDefendant asserts that the trial court \u201cnever asked [defendant] in clear,\n\nunambiguous language whether he was willing to waive his right to unimpaired\n\ncounsel.\u201d He also complains of the court's failure to \u201cdetermine whether\n\n[Toton's] alleged misuse of client funds might indicate that Toton had financial\n\ndifficulties which might affect his work or handling of funds in [defendant's]\n\ncase, [nor did the court] ask Toton about the timetable of state bar proceedings\n\n[or ask] how the bar proceeding might affect, or might have affected, Toton's\n\nconduct of [defendant's] case.\u201d\n\nIn deciding whether a defendant understands the nature of a possible conflict of\n\ninterest with counsel, the trial court need not explore each foreseeable conflict\n\nand consequence. [Citation] Nor does a defendant's waiver of conflict-free\n\ncounsel extend merely to matters discussed on the record. [Citation] As we\n\nobserved in [Citation] \u201c[r]ules that are that strict seem neither necessary nor\n\nworkable.\u201d [Citation] (waiver found adequate even though all conceivable\n\nramifications of conflict not explained). Thus, looking at the whole record, we\n\nmust determine whether defendant was aware of the potential drawbacks and\n\npossible consequences of retaining Toton, and whether he understood his right to\n\nconflict-free counsel and knowingly waived that right.\n\nIt is clear that the record belies defendant's argument. The court's response to the\n\nasserted conflict of interest was appropriate under the circumstances; it was\n\nimmediate and informed petitioner of his rights under the facts. As the record\n\nindicates, the court discussed the conflict with the parties, was careful to ensure\n\ndefendant was aware that a conflict existed, and confirmed that his waiver of the\n\nconflict was voluntary and knowing. [Citation] Defendant even declined the\n\ncourt's invitation to make a motion for mistrial, emphasizing that he was satisfied\n\nwith the state of the record. Thus, in light of all the circumstances, we conclude\n\nthe court gave defendant an opportunity to declare a mistrial, to relieve counsel,\n\nand to voice his objections on the record. In our view, the trial court conducted\n\nan adequate inquiry into the conflict, and we are satisfied that defendant's waiver\n\nwas knowing and voluntary. [Citation]\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 45-48.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment provides that a criminal defendant shall have the right to \u201cthe\n\nAssistance of Counsel for his defense.\u201d As a general matter, a defendant alleging a Sixth\n\nAmendment violation must demonstrate \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel's\n\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Strickland, 466\n\nU.S. at 694.\n\n\n\nAn exception exists for cases in which counsel actively represents conflicting interests.\n\nMickens v.

Thus, \u201cuntil a defendant shows that his counsel actively\n\nrepresented conflicting interests, he has not established the constitutional predicate for his claim\n\nof ineffective assistance.\u201d Id. at 350 (emphasis in original).\n\nPetitioner supports these claims in part with facts alleged in claims 5 and 6. He contends\n\nthat Toton, who had state bar disciplinary proceedings pending against him at the time he was\n\nappointed to Petitioner\u2019s case. He contends Toton obtained his bar license by fraud. He\n\ncontends that Toton had conflicts of interest relating to disbarment proceedings which should\n\nhave resulted in replacement lead counsel and a jury trial at the guilt and special circumstance\n\n\n\nphase. However, there is no competent evidence Toton obtained his law license by fraud (SHCP\n\nEx. 133, Att. A), or that he engaged in the practice of law prior to his admission to the bar.\n\n(SHCP Exhs. 514; 516-18.) Toton was not disbarred until March 31, 1989, five months after the\n\npenalty phase verdict. (SHCP Ex. 519.)\n\nPetitioner faults the trial court for failure to conduct an adequate inquiry into Toton\u2019s\n\npossible conflict of interest, noting Toton was never questioned. (Sealed RT July 26, 1988, at\n\npp. 80-84.) However, the trial judge did look into the pending disciplinary proceedings against\n\nToton and discussed such with the parties and Petitioner. See Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 47. The\n\nCourt provided Petitioner the opportunity to \u201cdeclare a mistrial, to relieve counsel, and to voice\n\nhis objections to the record.\u201d Id. In response Petitioner voluntarily, knowingly and intentionally\n\nwaived any conflict of interest on the record following a discussion with co-counsel Frank and\n\nthe trial court as to his rights to conflict free representation and potential drawbacks and\n\nconsequences of staying with Toton (RT [7/27/88] 3, 4-10), as reflected by his statement he\n\nwanted to maintain the status quo. (RT [7/27/88] 8.) He refused the court\u2019s invitation for\n\nmistrial, to relieve counsel, and to object to the record. Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 47.\n\nThe evidentiary record does not reflect that Toton\u2019s litigation of the case was influenced\n\nby an actual conflict arising from the disciplinary proceedings. See Burger, 483 U.S. at 783.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s argument that, had the trial court pressed the inquiry, Toton would have withdrawn\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 77 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n78\n\nor been replaced and a full defense then mounted, is based upon speculation. The trial court\n\ncould reasonably have found that there was no actual unwaived conflict of interest. The state\n\ncourt could have concluded that Petitioner understood what he was waiving, was \u201cvery satisfied\u201d\n\nwith the record and acting voluntarily, (RT [7/27/88] 8), and that Toton\u2019s situation had \u201cnothing\n\nto do with his waiver of the jury trial.\u201d (RT [7/27/88] 9-10.)\n\nPetitioner\u2019s contention that he should have been allowed to discuss Toton\u2019s alleged\n\nconflict with Toton himself or outside counsel is unaccompanied by any evidentiary proffer how\n\nthat would have resulted in a more favorable outcome. The state supreme court found that \u201cthe\n\nfact disciplinary proceedings were pending against counsel Toton did not automatically render\n\nToton\u2019s performance inadequate or prejudice [Petitioner\u2019s] right to effective counsel.\u201d Sanchez,\n\n12 Cal.4th at 44. The court further found that Toton engaged in vigorous witness examination\n\nand cross-examination (CT 518-625; RT 2664-2670), pre-trial discovery (CT 649-663, 769),\n\npreemptory challenges (CT 836-840) evidentiary motions (CT 841-45, 846-53, 854-58, RT 80,\n\n97-113), and closing argument. (RT 169-96.) All this supported the conclusion that Toton\u2019s\n\nrepresentation was adequate. The state supreme court also found \u201cno indication that the\n\ndisciplinary proceedings influenced the pace of Toton\u2019s representation.\u201d Sanchez 12 Cal.4th at\n\n45:2). Nothing in the state record suggests otherwise.\n\nFor the reasons discussed in claims 19 and 20, ante, Petitioner has not established denial\n\nof effective assistance of counsel through denial of defense counsel motions to withdraw,\n\nbreakdown of the attorney-client relationship by virtue of Toton\u2019s debarment proceedings, or\n\nwaiver of jury trial at the guilt and special circumstance phase. The assertion in claims 21-24,\n\nthat the trial court did not sufficiently investigate defense counsel\u2019s alleged conflict of interest\n\nsimilarly fails for the same reasons.\n\nPetitioner expressed his desire to plead guilty, to stay with Toton following discussion\n\nwith the court and defense counsel. Toton, assisted by co-counsel Frank, vigorously crossexamined\n\nwitnesses and made a variety of pretrial and trial motions and made a detailed guilt\n\nphase closing argument, thereby distinguishing this matter from Petitioner\u2019s cited People v.\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 78 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n79\n\nWilliams, 93 Ill.2d 309 (1982) and People v. Rainge, 112 Ill.App.3d 396 (1983). Petitioner was\n\naware of the possible problems with Toton\u2019s continued representation and his right to conflict\n\nfree representation, having discussed these matters with co-counsel Frank for approximately an\n\nhour, and Petitioner thereafter expressly waived any such conflict. (RT [7/27/88] 4-10.)\n\nPetitioner argues that defense counsel Frank lacked sufficient information about Toton\u2019s\n\ndisciplinary proceedings to discuss the matter with Petitioner, (SHCP Ex. 137, \u00b6 16), but makes\n\nno proffer of how and why this was so and cause him prejudice. Frank believed that Toton\u2019s\n\ndisciplinary issues did not affect the proceedings. (Sealed RT July 27, 1988, at p. 9-10.)\n\nPetitioner\u2019s re-argument that neuropsychological deficits (organic impairments) and\n\nneurological and psychiatric disorders (psychiatric impairments) prevented him from\n\ncompetently waiving the conflict fails substantively for the reasons stated in claims 1-4 and 6.\n\nAs discussed in those claims, Dr. Foster\u2019s 1995 opinion of Petitioner\u2019s mental state, that there is\n\na high probability Petitioner suffered neuropsychological and psychiatric disorders and\n\nimpairments during the pretrial and trial period, does not demonstrate the trial court decision to\n\n\n\nallow Toton to continue as lead counsel was unreasonable.\n\nAt bottom, Petitioner has not demonstrated Toton had an actual conflict of interest. See\n\nGarcia v. Bunnell 33 F.3d 1193, 1198 (9th Cir. 1994) (no actual conflict where record discloses\n\nno active representation of competing interest); see also Burger, 483 U.S.at 783; Mickens, 535\n\nU.S. at 171 (\u201c[A]n actual conflict of interest [means] precisely a conflict that affected counsel's\n\nperformance\u2014as opposed to a mere theoretical division of loyalties.\u201d). To meet this standard, he\n\nmust show \u201cthat the attorney's behavior seems to have been influenced by the conflict,\u201d which,\n\nthough not a showing of actual prejudice, \u201cremains a substantial hurdle.\u201d Lockhart v. Terhune,\n\n250 F.3d 1223, 1231 (9th Cir. 2001). Even if he had demonstrated actual conflict, Petitioner has\n\nnot demonstrated that his waiver the conflict was invalid. Garcia, 33 F3d at 1195 (9th Cir.\n\n1994);\n\nRespondent contends claims 21, 22 and 24 are not cognizable because each creates and\n\nretroactively applies a \u201cnew rule\u201d of constitutional law within Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288.\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 79 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n\n\n80\n\nHowever, the Court finds the claims fail not because Petitioner seeks to apply a new rule of\n\ncriminal procedure under Teague, but rather on grounds the claims lack merit for the reasons\n\nstated.\n\nA fair-minded jurist could have found that rejection of these claims was neither contrary\n\nto, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the\n\nSupreme Court, nor an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented\n\nin the state court proceeding. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nClaims 21-24 are denied.\n\ne. Review of Claims 25-26\n\nPetitioner next claims that he was not competent to waive trial by jury and confrontation\n\nand cross-examination of witnesses and presentation of a defense, and that he was not competent\n\nto stand trial, violating his Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. He supports these\n\nclaims with facts alleged in denied claims 6 through 10 and 14.\n\nThe California Supreme Court summarily denied claims 25 and 26 (SPet. Claims W and\n\nT respectively) raised in Petitioner\u2019s state petition for habeas corpus. In re Sanchez, S049502\n\n(DD). As noted, in such a case \u201cthe habeas petitioner\u2019s burden still must be met by showing\n\nthere was no reasonable basis for the state court to deny relief,\u201d Richter, 562 U.S. at 98, and this\n\nCourt \u201cmust determine what arguments or theories supported or . . . could have supported, the\n\nstate court\u2019s decision; and then it must ask whether it is possible fair-minded jurists could\n\ndisagree that those arguments or theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of\n\nthis Court.\u201d Id. (emphasis added).\n\ni. Trial Waivers\n\nThe state supreme court found Petitioner knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived\n\nrights when it considered the matter on direct appeal. This Court agrees, for the reasons\n\ndiscussed in claims 6, 14 and 21-24. The trial court allowed Toton to inform Petitioner of his\n\nconstitutional rights, which Petitioner acknowledged he was waiving \u201cfreely and voluntarily.\u201d\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 24-25. Petitioner\u2019s suggestion he did not receive a sufficient narrative\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 80 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n81\n\nexplanation of rights waived is refuted by the evidentiary record. Toton informed the trial court\n\nhe had discussed the guilt and special circumstance submission and waiver with Petitioner, who\n\nagreed to the procedure. (RT-10a.) Petitioner expressly declined the offer of more time to\n\nconsider the waiver decision, stating that he was \u201cvery confident\u201d of his decision. See Sanchez,\n\n12 Cal.4th at 26; CT 889-892; RT-10a, 98a-100a.). Petitioner then entered jury trial, compulsory\n\nprocess, confrontation and cross-examination and presentation of evidence waivers on the\n\nrecord. (CT 891; RT- 108a-114a.) Petitioner confirmed the waivers the next day, July 14, 1988.\n\n(CT 892; RT-115a.) Petitioner\u2019s argument that medication he received during his incarceration\n\nimpacted the waivers (SHCP Exhs. 111, \u00b6 64; 601) is not sufficiently supported in the\n\nevidentiary record.\n\nii. Slow Guilty Plea\n\nThe State Supreme Court also considered on direct appeal Petitioner\u2019s argument that the\n\nsubmission for court trial was a \u201cslow plea\u201d unaccompanied by waivers sufficient under BoykinTahl.\n\nThat court found no \u201cslow plea\u201d because defense counsel called and cross-examined\n\nwitnesses, retained the right to present additional evidence, attempted to impeach Hernandez,\n\nmoved to strike testimony, moved for judgment of acquittal on insufficiency of the evidence,\n\nargued against first degree murder, and made an extensive closing argument. Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th\n\nat 28-30. That court also ruled there was no surrender of the rights against self-incrimination\n\n\n\n(because Petitioner chose not to testify at the guilt phase) and no prejudicial error from any\n\nfailure to advise Petitioner of the consequences of conviction, noting that:\n\nDefendant had been thoroughly advised by counsel of the consequences of\n\npleading guilty and of the consequences of waiving his constitutional rights. He\n\nwas well aware that he faced a possible death sentence, and, according to reporter\n\nTrihey, even asked for his own death. It is clear from the record that defendant\n\nwould have waived his right to a jury trial and insisted on the submission of the\n\nguilt phase on the preliminary hearing transcripts even if he was specifically told\n\nby the court that he faced a possible death sentence.\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 30-31.\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 81 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n82\n\nAt trial, Petitioner was questioned about the charges pending and consequences of\n\n\n\nconviction:\n\n\u201cMr. Toton: And you also understand the nature of the charges against you in this\n\nproceeding; is that correct?\n\n\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, sir.\n\nMr. Toton: All right, and that there are three counts of homicide alleged with\n\nspecial circumstances.\n\nThe Defendant: Yes.\n\nMr. Toton: Thank you, your Honor.\n\nThe Court: And I take it, sir, that you have done all this freely and voluntarily?\n\nThe Defendant: Yes, sir.\n\nThe Court: No one has threatened you?\n\nThe Defendant: No, sir.\n\nThe Court: And you have done this after consultation with both of your lawyers?\n\nThe Defendant: Yes, sir.\n\nThe Court: Thank you.\n\n(CT 889; RT- 65a-68a.)\n\nPetitioner was given time to consider the waiver which did not become final until the\n\nfollowing day, when he confirmed the waiver and that it was made freely and voluntarily. (CT\n\n891-892; RT-115a.)\n\nThe Court finds the \u201cslow plea\u201d claim is not adequately supported by the state record.\n\nPetitioner consulted with defense counsel prior to the waivers and submission to court trial;\n\nrepeatedly stated his desire to plead guilty; and acquiesced to counsel\u2019s urging to allow crossexamination\n\nand argument in his defense. The California Supreme Court\u2019s determination of facts\n\nwas not unreasonable in light of the evidence above and Petitioner\u2019s desire to plead guilty. (RT \u2013\n\n87a.) That court\u2019s rejection of Petitioner\u2019s claims neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable\n\napplication of, United States Supreme Court precedent.\n\niii. Competency for trial\n\nPetitioner maintains Dr. Matychowiak, who conducted his psychiatric evaluation in\n\nNovember 1987, erred in finding him competent to stand trial because: (1) the opinion was\n\nbased on a single, inefficient interview, (2) the conclusion relies almost exclusively on\n\nPetitioner\u2019s statements and are not corroborated by independent evidence, (3) insufficient\n\ninformation was obtained about several important factors, including Petitioner\u2019s history of severe\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 82 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n83\n\nchildhood trauma and extreme neurological deficits, (4) the effect of signs of potential brain\n\ndamage, including history of head injury, paint sniffing and PCP use, as well findings of poor\n\n\u201ctheoretical and general judgment\u201d were not considered, (5) the effect of signs of depression,\n\nsuicidal intentions, and self-mutilation were not considered, (6) no questions were asked about\n\nPetitioner\u2019s understanding of the nature of the proceedings or his ability to consult with or assist\n\ncounsel, and (7) the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder with a past history of substance\n\nabuse did not follow logically from findings of head injury, severe drug abuse, depression,\n\nsuicidal tendencies and poor theoretical and general judgment.\n\nA defendant is not competent to stand trial if he lacks \u201csufficient present ability to consult\n\nwith his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\u2013and a rational as well as\n\nfactual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d Dusky v. United Sates, 362 U.S. 402\n\n(1960). A state may legislate the presumption that defendants are competent to stand trial and\n\nrequire defendants to bear the burden of proving that they are not. Medina v. California, 505\n\nU.S. 437, 449 (1992).\n\nPetitioner has not made a sufficient showing that he was erroneously deemed mentally\n\ncompetent. Petitioner\u2019s contention his neuropsychological deficits (organic impairments) and\n\nneurological and psychiatric disorders (psychiatric impairments) prevented him from\n\ncompetently standing trial and making the above waivers fails substantively for the reasons\n\n\n\nstated in claim 6. Petitioner did not suffer hallucinations or delusions memory lapse at this time.\n\n(SPet. Ex. 520, p. 5.) He wanted to enter a guilty plea, though his attorneys had not allowed him\n\nto do so. (Id. at p. 2-4.) Dr. Matychowiak found that Petitioner\n\n[Q]uite clearly understand(s) his situation and has the comprehension of the court\n\nprocesses. He is able to discuss himself, his decisions and his reasoning for his\n\ndecisions . . . At the present time he shows evidence of a basic personality\n\ndisorder. However, this does not make him unable to understand court procedures\n\nor his need for his own defense. It does not appear to significantly interfere with\n\nhis capacity to cooperate with his attorney.\u201d\n\nId., at 5-6. Dr. Matychowiak found Petitioner \u201cpresently able to understand the nature and\n\npurpose of proceedings taken against him\u201d and \u201cto cooperate in a rational manner with counsel\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 83 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n84\n\n\n\nin presenting a defense.\u201d (SPet. Ex. 520, p.6.)\n\nAs discussed above, defense psychologist Donaldson, who examined Petitioner prior to\n\nthe preliminary hearing, found Petitioner to be of average intelligence with no deficits in reality\n\ntesting or thought disorder. (SPet. Ex. 106, p. 2.) Defense counsel were entitled to rely on the\n\nexpert\u2019s opinions, and were not obligated, without a request for information from the expert, to\n\ninvestigate further in these regards. Hendricks v. Calderon, 70 F.3d 1032, 1038 (9th Cir. 1995);\n\ncf., Silva v. Woodford, 279 F.3d 825, 842-43 (9th Cir. 2002) (trial counsel deficient if inadequate\n\ninvestigation into background and mental health: at guilt if expert requests information; and at\n\npenalty if the information is mitigating).\n\nPetitioner points to declarations included with the state habeas petition by psychologists\n\nDoane and Froming (SHCP Exhs. 105 and 114 respectively) and psychiatrist Foster (SHCP Ex.\n\n111). These experts opine that Petitioner had a history of heavy paint sniffing and PCP abuse\n\n(SHCP, Ex. 111, \u00b6 90), and suffered significant organic brain damage and neuropsychological\n\ndeficits and post-traumatic stress disorder at the time of his trial waivers. (SHCP Exhs. 105, \u00b6\u00b6\n\n153-165; 111, \u00b6\u00b6 60-69). Petitioner contends that, as of December 1987, he was considered a\n\n\u201cmentally unstable inmate\u2019 based on his bizarre behavior, overwhelming guilt and depression,\n\ninstability, possible hallucinations and a suicide attempt. (SCHP Ex. 601.)\n\nHowever, to the extent that these declarations can be considered evidence, they were not\n\npresented to the California Supreme Court in his appeal. As to claims adjudicated in the appeal,\n\nthe Court cannot consider these declarations here. Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1398. Even if they\n\ncould be considered, they are not sufficient evidence in support of the claims for the reasons\n\nstated. Petitioner was mentally competent for reasons discussed in claims 6, and knowingly and\n\nvoluntarily made the waivers for reasons discussed in claims 14 and 21through 24.\n\nDue process requires a state to provide access to competent psychiatric assistance when a\n\ndefendant demonstrates that his sanity at the time of the offense will be a significant factor at\n\ntrial. Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68, 83 (1985). However, an indigent defendant does not have\n\na constitutional right to hire the psychiatrist of his choice. Id.

Peters, 905 F.2d 986, 1013 (7th Cir. 1990)).\n\n\u201cAllowing such battles of psychiatric opinions during successive collateral challenges to a death\n\nsentence would place federal courts in a psycho-legal quagmire resulting in the total abuse of the\n\nhabeas process.\u201d Id. at 1518.\n\nDr. Matychowiak was aware of Petitioner\u2019s history of substance abuse (SPet. Ex. 520, pp.\n\n3-4), and found Petitioner competent to stand trial. (SPet. Ex. 520, pp. 2-6.) Dr. Matychowiak\n\nfound that Petitioner understood his situation and the court process, had the capacity to cooperate\n\nwith his attorney and wanted to plead guilty and \u201cget it over with.\u201d (SPet. Ex. 520, pp. 2-6.)\n\nMoreover, Petitioner\u2019s coherent interaction with the trial court and counsel, and defense\n\ncounsel\u2019s failure to raise any competency concern, are some evidence Petitioner was then\n\ncompetent. See United States v. Lewis, 991 F.2d 524, 528 (9th Cir. 1993). Petitioner\u2019s alleged\n\nfacts are not sufficient to create real and substantial doubt as to his competency. See Boag v.\n\nRaines, 769 F.2d 1341, 1343, (9th Cir. 1985).\n\nFor the reasons stated, a fair-minded jurist could have found that the state court rejection\n\nof these claims was neither contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established\n\nfederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court, nor an unreasonable determination of the facts\n\nin light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nClaims 25-26 are denied.\n\nf. Review of Claim 277\n\nIn his next claim, Petitioner alleges the trial court misapplied the California Shield Law\n\n\n\nto reporter Trihey\u2019s testimony, violating Petitioner\u2019s rights to confrontation, due process, a fair\n\ntrial and compulsory process under the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nThe California Supreme Court rejected this claim on direct appeal.

Moreover, as with any attempt to discover evidence subject to\n\na claim of privilege, a defendant must show a reasonable possibility that the\n\nevidence sought might result in his exoneration.\u201d [Citation]\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 52.\n\nTrihey testified during the guilt phase subject to invocation of the newsperson\u2019s shield\n\nlaw. He testified that during interviews that Petitioner had told him he was \u201ctriple murderer\u201d and\n\nthat \u201call three were killed for their Social Security checks.\u201d (RT 18.) These statements were\n\npublished in the Bakersfield Californian on April 25, 1988. (RT 17-18.)\n\nToton objected to use of the newsperson\u2019s shield law to protect unpublished information\n\nin Trihey\u2019s possession. The trial court ruled for such protection, limiting Toton\u2019s crossexamination\n\nto only published information and finding that impeachment of Trihey was not at\n\nissue. (RT 57-59.) Toton then decline further cross-examination of Trihey. (RT 65.)\n\nPetitioner alleges that the trial court\u2019s misapplication of California Shield Law to reporter\n\nTrihey\u2019s testimony caused defense counsel Toton to decline any cross-examination of Trihey,\n\ndenying Petitioner an effective defense.\n\n8 California Constitution, article I, section 2, subdivision (b); Cal.

He asserts his alleged unpublished statements also could have been used to\n\nimpeach Trihey's testimony that defendant had told him he was a \u201ctriple\n\nmurderer\u201d and that \u201call three were killed for their social security checks.\u201d But\n\ndefendant never shows how the information he sought would materially assist his\n\ndefense, or how it differed in content from the testimony and published\n\ninformation available for cross-examination, including defendant's statements that\n\nhe was scared, that he had taken phencyclidine (PCP), and that he had not\n\nmurdered anyone. Defendant simply asserts that he \u201cneeded discovery of, and\n\ncross-examination about, the unpublished records of the interviews to impeach\n\nTrihey's testimony. Unlike other statements attributed to [defendant] in the April\n\n25th article, Trihey's 'triple murderer' assertion was not a direct quotation. Rather,\n\nit was a conclusion drawn by Trihey. Trihey's unpublished material might have\n\nshown that his 'triple murder' testimony was his own interpretation of\n\n[defendant's] account, not an actual admission. Moreover, discovery and crossexamination\n\n\n\nmight have proven that Trihey's conclusion was not supported by the\n\ninterviews. The tapes might have shown that [defendant] never said he was a\n\n'triple murderer' or a 'triple killer'; that he did not hit either Juan or Juanita; that he\n\ndid nothing to aid or abet Joey; that he did not intend that either Juan or Juanita be\n\nkilled; that he tried to stop Joey from killing his parents; or that he feels guilty\n\nbecause he failed to prevent the homicides. Any of these possibilities would have\n\nbolstered [defendant's] insufficiency of the evidence argument.\u201d\n\nThe alleged evidence defendant claims would have materially assisted his defense\n\nconsists of nothing more than self-serving statements that a court could\n\nreasonably conclude were either too speculative to assist defendant or would\n\nharm, rather than materially assist, the defense. Indeed, this case is similar to\n\n[Citation], in which the court rejected the defendant's attempt to attack his own\n\ncredibility by subpoenaing a reporter's unpublished interview notes. Based on this\n\nrecord, and under the more recent [citation] threshold test, we find that defendant\n\nhas failed to make the threshold showing that publication of alleged unpublished\n\ninterview information possessed by Trihey would have materially assisted the\n\ndefense and defeated Trihey's claim of immunity under the shield law.\n\nIn addition, for the same reasons noted above, we reject defendant's claim that he\n\nwas denied his right to confront and cross-examine Trihey and to discover and\n\npresent evidence under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. The record shows\n\nthe court rejected Trihey's statements as proof that defendant killed the victims for\n\ntheir Social Security checks. Moreover, the court found untrue the special\n\ncircumstance allegations that the murders of Juan and Juanita Bocanegra were\n\ncommitted during a robbery and found defendant not guilty of the robbery in\n\nconnection with that crime. Thus, it appears the court afforded little weight to\n\nTrihey's testimony, and defendant was not denied his federal constitutional right\n\nto a fair trial simply because the court allowed the testimony to be introduced.\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 56-58.\n\nThe state supreme court also rejected Petitioner\u2019s assertion that counsel's failure to crossCase\n\n1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 87 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n88\n\nexamine Trihey before closing argument denied him the effective assistance of counsel under\n\narticle I, section 15 of the California Constitution, and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to\n\nthe federal Constitution, noting that:\n\nIn order to succeed in his claim, \u201cdefendant must show (1) deficient performance\n\nunder an objective standard of professional reasonableness and (2) prejudice\n\nunder a test of reasonable probability of an adverse effect on the outcome.\u201d\n\n[Citation] Defendant does not satisfy either prong of the foregoing test.\n\nAs discussed, Toton convinced the court during his closing argument that Trihey's\n\ntestimony should not be given substantial weight; his decision not to crossexamine\n\nTrihey as to the contents of the published material was sound strategy,\n\ngiven the nature of defendant's alleged contradictory statements. Defendant does\n\nnot establish that cross-examination would have revealed any new information, or\n\nthat any additional information about the interviews would have influenced the\n\ncourt's judgment. Hence, we cannot find counsel's failure to cross-examination\n\nTrihey to be deficient. In any event, given the fact that the court dismissed the\n\nrobbery charges against defendant, and found not true the robbery-murder specialcircumstance\n\nallegation, we discern no prejudice to defendant based on counsel's\n\nperformance. [Citation]\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 58-59.\n\nThe state court was not unreasonable in rejecting the claim. Petitioner does not make an\n\n\n\nevidentiary showing identifying how and why unpublished interview information sought from\n\nTrihey differed from that in the record and would likely change the result in his proceeding. The\n\nstate court, having found that impeachment of Trihey was not in issue, Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th 52,\n\nand giving only minimal weight to Trihey\u2019s testimony of a robbery motive, could reasonably\n\nhave rejected Petitioner\u2019s speculation and desire to impeach himself by arguing that the\n\ninterviews did not support the articles.\n\n\u201c[C]ounsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision\n\nthat makes particular investigations unnecessary.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691. \u201cIn any\n\nineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for\n\nreasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel's\n\njudgments.\u201d Id. at 691.\n\nPetitioners claim fails under this standard. The trial judge was able to evaluate Trihey\u2019s\n\ncredibility and motivations in testifying, expressly found that impeachment of Trihey was not in\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 88 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n\n\n89\n\nissue. (RT 59.) Toton was afforded the opportunity to cross-examine Trihey, both about\n\nPetitioner\u2019s statements and any inconsistency therein (RT 51, 54-57), as well published\n\nstatements by Hernandez and by Seeley which alleged were attributed to Petitioner. (RT 51-53.)\n\nThe record does not support claimed denial of confrontation and fair trial. Any\n\nconfrontation clause error was harmless, for reasons discussed in claims 1-4 there was substantial\n\nevidence of guilt even without Trihey\u2019s testimony.\n\nThe trial court verdict accorded only slight evidentiary value to Trihey\u2019s testimony.\n\nDefense counsel Toton successfully argued to minimize the significance of Trihey\u2019s testimony\n\nregarding robbery motive. (RT 175-183, 235-236.) Any claim of due process and compulsory\n\nprocess error fails because it is not reasonable to believe any evidence suppressed might have\n\naffected the outcome of trial for reasons discussed in claims 1-26.\n\nAccordingly, the Court finds that the California Supreme Court\u2019s determination of facts\n\nwas not unreasonable in light of the evidence, and its rejection of this claim was neither contrary\n\nto, nor an unreasonable application of, United States Supreme Court precedent.\n\nClaim 27 is denied.\n\n6. Prosecutorial Misconduct in Guilt and Special Circumstances Phase - Claims 28-\n\n33\n\nIn claims 28 through 33, Petitioner alleges instances of prosecutorial misconduct during\n\nthe guilt and special circumstance phase\n\na. Clearly Established Law\n\ni. Brady\n\nThe Supreme Court held that if the state fails to disclose exculpatory evidence in\n\nviolation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S 83 (1963), the conviction cannot stand if there is a\n\nreasonable probability that the evidence, considered cumulatively, would have produced a\n\ndifferent result at trial. Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 441 (1995). There are three components\n\nof a Brady violation: (1) the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused either because it\n\nis exculpatory or because it is impeaching; (2) the evidence must have been suppressed by the\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 89 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n90\n\nState either willfully or inadvertently; and (3) prejudice must have ensued. Banks v. Dretke, 540\n\nU.S. 668, 691 (2004); Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 281\u201382 (1999). \u201cSuch evidence is\n\nmaterial if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,\n\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Strickler, 527 U.S. at 280, quoting\n\nUnited States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985)). \u201c[T]here is never a real Brady violation\n\nunless the nondisclosure was so serious that there is a reasonable probability that the suppressed\n\nevidence would have produced a different verdict.\u201d Strickler, 527 U.S. at 281.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that a federal court can grant habeas relief on a\n\nconstitutional trial error claim only if the error had a \u201csubstantial or injurious effect\u201d on the\n\nverdict. Brecht, 507 U.S. at 637. A new trial is warranted only if prosecutorial misconduct\n\nresulted in a fundamental denial of due process. Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 181\n\n(1986). Where the issue is evenly balanced and the judge has doubts about whether the error had\n\na \u201csubstantial and injurious effect\u201d on the jury\u2019s verdict, then the judge must treat the error as if\n\nit were not harmless. O\u2019Neal v. McAninch, 513 U.S. 432, 435 (1995). In California v. Roy, 519\n\nU.S. 2 (1996), the Supreme Court ruled that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s application of a modified O\u2019Neal\n\nharmless error standard (\u201cthe omission is harmless only if review of the facts found by the jury\n\nestablishes that the jury necessarily found the omitted element\u201d) was too strict and remanded the\n\ncase for further consideration in light of Brecht and O\u2019Neal.\n\nThe Court in Kyles also held that once a habeas petitioner establishes the \u201creasonable\n\nprobability\u201d of a different result, the error cannot subsequently be found harmless under Brecht.\n\nKyles, 514 U.S. at 436.\n\nii. Due Process\n\n\n\nA petitioner is entitled to habeas corpus relief if the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct \u201cso infected\n\nthe trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d Donnelly,\n\n416 U.S. at 643. To constitute a due process violation, the prosecutorial misconduct must be \u201cof\n\nsufficient significance to result in the denial of the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d Greer v.\n\nMiller, 483 U.S. 756, 765 (1987) (quoting Bagley, 473 U.S. at 667). \u201c\u2018Before a federal court\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 90 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n91\n\nmay overturn a conviction resulting from a state trial . . . it must be established not merely that\n\nthe [State\u2019s action] is undesirable, erroneous, or even \u2018universally condemned,\u2019 but that it\n\nviolated some right which was guaranteed to the defendant by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d\n\nSmith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 221 (1982) (quoting Cupp v. Naughten, 414 U.S. 141, 146\n\n(1973)).\n\nAny claim of prosecutorial misconduct must be reviewed within the context of the entire\n\n\n\ntrial. Greer, 485 U.S. at 765-66; United States v. Weitzenhoff, 35 F.3d 1275, 1291 (9th Cir.\n\n1994). The court must keep in mind that \u201c[t]he touchstone of due process analysis in cases of\n\nalleged prosecutorial misconduct is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor\u201d\n\nand \u201cthe aim of due process is not punishment of society for the misdeeds of the prosecutor but\n\navoidance of an unfair trial to the accused.\u201d Phillips, 455 U.S. at 219. \u201cImproper argument does\n\nnot, per se, violate a defendant's constitutional rights.\u201d Thompson v. Borg, 74 F.3d 1571, 1576\n\n(9th Cir. 1996) (quoting Jeffries v. Blodgett, 5 F.3d 1180, 1191 (9th Cir. 1993)). Furthermore,\n\nthe Supreme Court has stated:\n\n[A]rguments of counsel generally carry less weight with a jury than do\n\ninstructions from the court. The former are usually billed in advance to the jury as\n\nmatters of argument, not evidence . . . and are likely viewed as the statements of\n\nadvocates; the latter, we have often recognized, are viewed as definitive and\n\nbinding statements of the law. Arguments of counsel which misstate the law are\n\nsubject to objection and to correction by the court. This is not to say that\n\nprosecutorial misrepresentations may never have a decisive effect on the jury, but\n\nonly that they are not to be judged as having the same force as an instruction from\n\nthe court. And the arguments of counsel, like the instructions of the court, must be\n\njudged in the context in which they are made.\n\nBoyde v. California, 494 U.S. 370, 384-85 (1990).\n\nIf prosecutorial misconduct is established, and it was constitutional error, the error must\n\nbe evaluated pursuant to the harmless error test set forth in Brecht. See Thompson, 74 F.3d at\n\n1577 (\u201cOnly if the argument were constitutional error would we have to decide whether the\n\nconstitutional error was harmless.\u201d).\n\nb. Review of Claim 28\n\nIn this claim, Petitioner alleges that information tending to undermine the credibility of\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 91 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n92\n\njailhouse informant Hernandez, that Hernandez was a heroin addict who gave testimony\n\nmotivated by Detective Stratton\u2019s offer of a deal over pending heroin and probation violation\n\ncharges and to avoid being suspected in the Bocanegra murders, was withheld by the\n\nprosecution.\n\nThe California Supreme Court summarily denied claim 28 (SPet. Claims U) raised in\n\nPetitioner\u2019s state petition for habeas corpus. In re Sanchez, S049502 (DD). As noted, in such a\n\ncase \u201cthe habeas petitioner\u2019s burden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis\n\nfor the state court to deny relief,\u201d Richter, 562 U.S. at 98, and this Court \u201cmust determine what\n\narguments or theories supported or . . . could have supported, the state court\u2019s decision; and then\n\nit must ask whether it is possible fair-minded jurists could disagree that those arguments or\n\ntheories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this Court.\u201d Id. (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\nHere the state court could reasonably have found that Petitioner was not prejudiced by\n\nalleged prosecution failure to disclose information about jailhouse informant Hernandez. The\n\nrecord in this matter shows that the defense had the benefit of Hernandez\u2019s arrest report and\n\npresumptively was aware of his criminal record including any matters relating to substance\n\nabuse. (SPet. Ex. 409, pp. 1-2.) The defense was aware of Hernandez plea deal and crossexamined\n\nHernandez regarding it. (CT 576-577; RT 2850-51.) Facts surrounding Hernandez\n\nalleged heroin addiction were equally available to defense counsel through discovery. (CT 654-\n\n676.) See U.S. v. Pelullo, 399 F.3d 197, 202 (3d. Cir. 2005) (Brady challenge fails where\n\ninformation equally available). For the same reason, any alleged omission of Hernandez\u2019s\n\nprobation status regarding charges plea bargained is unavailing.\n\nPetitioner has not made any sufficient showing in the evidentiary record that Hernandez\n\n\n\ntestified falsely by omitting charges covered by plea bargain. These \u201comitted\u201d charges were\n\nresolved outside the plea bargain under which Hernandez testified. (SPet. Ex. 508, p. 6.)\n\nContrary to Petitioner\u2019s assertion, the record reflects that it was Hernandez who initiated contact\n\nwith the authorities. (RT 2857; CT 576-77; SResp. Ex. C, pp. 1-2.) Petitioner\u2019s allegation that\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 92 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n93\n\nHernandez\u2019s testimony was coerced by detective Stratton, and false, fails substantively for\n\nreasons discussed in claims 1-4, ante. As discussed in those claims, Hernandez testimony was\n\nnot inconsistent with the physical evidence. (CT 355, 378-80.) See United States v. Cooper,\n\n173 F.3d 1192, 1202 (9th Cir. 1999) (stating that to show Brady error, the petitioner must show\n\nthat the evidence (1) was exculpatory, (2) should have been but was not produced, and (3) was\n\nmaterial to guilt or innocence). Hernandez\u2019s unsigned declaration (SPet. Ex. 101, Att. A) is not\n\nevidence otherwise. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746.\n\n\n\nGiven the foregoing and the extended cross-examination of Hernandez by Toton and the\n\nconsistent physical evidence, the state court could reasonably have found it unlikely that\n\nallegedly undisclosed evidence would have affected assessment of witness\u2019 credibility and, given\n\nPetitioner desire to plead guilty, the result of the proceedings.\n\nRespondent contends claim 28 is not cognizable because it creates and retroactively\n\napplies a \u201cnew rule\u201d of constitutional law within Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288. However, the\n\nCourt finds the claim fails not because Petitioner seeks to apply a new rule of criminal procedure\n\nunder Teague, but rather on grounds the claim lacks merit for the reasons stated.\n\nFor the reasons stated, a fair-minded jurist could have found that the state court rejection\n\nof the claim was neither contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal\n\nlaw, as determined by the Supreme Court, nor an unreasonable determination of the facts in light\n\nof the evidence presented in the state court proceeding. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nClaim 28 is denied.\n\nc. Review of Claim 29\n\nIn this next claim, Petitioner alleges that Hernandez\u2019s notes of conversation with\n\nPetitioner, which might have provided a basis to impeach Hernandez, were not safeguarded by\n\npolice and the prosecution and were lost.\n\nThe California Supreme Court summarily denied claim 29 (SPet. Claims V) raised in\n\nPetitioner\u2019s state petition for habeas corpus. In re Sanchez, S049502 (DD). In such a case, \u201cthe\n\nhabeas petitioner\u2019s burden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis for the\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 93 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n94\n\nstate court to deny relief,\u201d Richter, 562 U.S. at 98, and this Court \u201cmust determine what\n\narguments or theories supported or . . . could have supported, the state court\u2019s decision; and then\n\nit must ask whether it is possible fair-minded jurists could disagree that those arguments or\n\ntheories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this Court.\u201d Id. (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\nAccording to the court in Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51, 57 (1988) the failure of a\n\nstate to preserve evidence \u201cof which no more can be said than it could have been subjected to\n\ntests, the results of which might have exonerated the defendant,\u201d is not a denial of due process of\n\nthe law \u201cunless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police.\u201d\n\nThe Ninth Circuit used the Youngblood standard for a claim of bad faith destruction of\n\nevidence in U.S. v. Hernandez, 109 F.3d 1450, 1455 (9th Cir. 1997), stating \u201c[t]he mere failure\n\nto preserve evidence which could have been subjected to tests which might have exonerated the\n\ndefendant does not constitute a due process violation\u201d, citing Mitchell v. Goldsmith, 878 F.2d\n\n319, 322 (9th Cir. 1989).\n\nWhere the government fails to preserve evidence that is only potentially exculpatory, the\n\nright to due process is violated only if [the evidence] possesses \u201can exculpatory value that was\n\napparent before the evidence was destroyed, and [is] of such a nature that the defendant would be\n\nunable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.\u201d California v.\n\nTrombetta, 467 U.S. 479, 489 (1984).\n\nThe state court could reasonably have found there was no bad faith failure to preserve\n\npotentially useful evidence. The record does not readily suggest Hernandez made the notes for\n\nthe prosecution or as their agent, (CT 74, 477-499, 503, 575-577; SResp. Ex. C, pp. 1, 3), or\n\nprosecutorial bad faith in failing to take custody of and preserve potentially material evidence.\n\nYoungblood, 488 U.S. at 58. Additionally, Petitioner has not demonstrated that the materiality\n\nand exculpatory value of such notes was anything more than speculative. (CT 484-487, 503;\n\nSResp. Ex. C, p. 3.)\n\nRespondent contends claim 29 is not cognizable because it creates and retroactively\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 94 of 213\n\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n95\n\napplies a \u201cnew rule\u201d of constitutional law within Teague v.

However, the\n\nCourt finds the claim fails not because Petitioner seeks to apply a new rule of criminal procedure\n\nunder Teague, but rather on grounds the claim lacks merit for the reasons stated.\n\nFor the reasons stated, a fair-minded jurist could have found that the state court rejection\n\nof the claim was neither contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal\n\nlaw, as determined by the Supreme Court, nor an unreasonable determination of the facts in light\n\nof the evidence presented in the state court proceeding. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nClaim 29 is denied\n\nd. Review of Claim 30\n\nPetitioner next claims that criminalist Laskowski, who testified to two different sets of\n\nfootprints during Petitioner\u2019s proceeding, subsequently identified a third set during Reyes\u2019s\n\n\n\nseparate trial for his role in the Bocanegra murders, undermining the prosecution\u2019s argument at\n\nPetitioner\u2019s trial that Petitioner and Joey were the only two who struck blows to the victims.\n\nThe State Supreme Court reviewed this claim in Petitioner state petition for habeas\n\ncorpus (SPet. Claim X) and summarily denied it. In re Sanchez, S049502 (DD). In such a case,\n\n\u201cthe habeas petitioner\u2019s burden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis for\n\nthe state court to deny relief,\u201d Richter, 562 U.S. at 98, and this Court \u201cmust determine what\n\narguments or theories supported or . . . could have supported, the state court\u2019s decision; and then\n\nit must ask whether it is possible fair-minded jurists could disagree that those arguments or\n\ntheories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this Court.\u201d Id. (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\nThe knowing use of false or perjured testimony against a defendant to obtain a conviction\n\nis unconstitutional. Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264 (1959). In Napue, the Supreme Court held\n\nthat the knowing use of false testimony to obtain a conviction violates due process regardless of\n\nwhether the prosecutor solicited the false testimony or merely allowed it to go uncorrected when\n\nit appeared.

Tayborn v. Scott, 251\n\nF.3d 1125, 1130 (7th Cir. 2001).\n\nThere is no sufficient showing Petitioner was prejudiced by presenting the testimony of\n\ncriminologist Laskowski regarding the shoe tread pattern photographs taken at the Bocanegra\n\ncrime scene. The state court could reasonably have found that, during Petitioner\u2019s trial,\n\nLaskowski and prosecutor Ryals were unaware of a third set of different footprints in the\n\nBocanegra home. (CT 376; SResp. Ex. B.) Moreover, there is not a reasonable possibility that\n\ntestimony of a third set of footprints would have affected the outcome of Petitioner\u2019s trial. See\n\nU.S. v.

In such a case, \u201cthe habeas petitioner\u2019s burden still must be met by showing\n\nthere was no reasonable basis for the state court to deny relief,\u201d Richter, 562 U.S. at 98, and this\n\nCourt \u201cmust determine what arguments or theories supported or . . . could have supported, the\n\nstate court\u2019s decision; and then it must ask whether it is possible fair-minded jurists could\n\ndisagree that those arguments or theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of\n\nthis Court.\u201d Id.

He argues that had Holloway testified\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 97 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n98\n\n\n\ntruthfully at the preliminary hearing, a three assailant theory might have discredited Hernandez\u2019s\n\ntestimony that only two assailants struck blows to the victims. However, the Court is not\n\nconvinced that Dr. Holloway\u2019s erroneous testimony precluded a theory that more than one\n\nperpetrator and more than one weapon inflicted the scalp wounds on Mr. Bocanegra and Mrs.\n\nBocanegra; Toton argued as much. (RT 187-191.)\n\nDr. Holloway testified at the preliminary hearing that Mr. Bocanegra\u2019s head wounds were\n\nentirely consistent with being inflicted by one person (CT 118-119, 134), similar to Mrs.\n\nBocanegra\u2019s head wounds (CT 118, 155-156, 159), and were consistent with being inflicted by\n\nthe same type of instrument (CT 118-119), though not necessarily the identical instrument. (CT\n\n131-134.)\n\nDr. Holloway later testified at the penalty phase that he had erred, that Mr. Bocanegra\u2019s\n\nhead wounds were not entirely consistent with Mrs. Bocanegra\u2019s (RT 2704-2706, 2720-2721,\n\n2725), that is they were only partially consistent (RT 2721-2722, 2725), and that he could not\n\nconclude from the autopsy evidence how many assailants were involved in the attack on Mr.\n\nBocanegra and Mrs. Bocanegra. (SPet. Ex. 120, p.3.)\n\nEven so, the state court could reasonably have found that Holloway and prosecutor Ryals\n\nwere not aware of the error at the preliminary hearing. (SResp. Ex. B.)\n\nThere is no sufficient showing Petitioner was prejudiced by pathologist Holloway\u2019s\n\nerroneous interpretation of scalp wounds of Mr. Bocanegra and Mrs. Bocanegra. The state court\n\ncould reasonably have found that Holloway\u2019s erroneous testimony that Mr. Bocanegra\u2019s scalp\n\nwounds were \u201centirely\u201d consistent with Mrs. Bocanegra\u2019s did not affect the outcome of\n\nPetitioner\u2019s trial. See Agurs, 427 U.S. at 103. Holloway\u2019s preliminary hearing opinion qualified\n\nthat the scalp wounds were not necessarily caused by the \u201cthe identical instrument\u201d (CT 132) and\n\nwere consistent with being inflicted by one person (CT 134). Holloway\u2019s testimony did not\n\nreasonably preclude Toton from arguing use of more than one weapon by more than one\n\nperpetrator. (RT 189-191). Moreover, had Dr. Holloway\u2019s modified testimony been presented\n\nat the preliminary hearing the outcome would not likely have changed for reasons stated in\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 98 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n99\n\nclaims 1, 3, and 10.\n\nAny attempt by defense counsel to argue Reyes rather than Petitioner struck blows to the\n\nvictims is rebutted by the record (CT 77-78, 479-84, 487-89, 495, 500-505; RT 181; SPet.

This Court cannot consider evidence outside the state\n\nrecord. Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1398. Even if it could, evidence proffered in the Reyes\n\nproceeding was not necessarily inconsistent with the prosecution\u2019s two assailant theory in this\n\naction. See People v. Robert Gabriel Reyes, Kern County Superior Court case number 34638,\n\nRT [10/3/91] 2-3, SResp. Ex. A.\n\nThe state court could reasonably have determined that Petitioner was not prejudiced by\n\nthe prosecution\u2019s two assailant argument for reasons discussed in claims 1-4 and 28-31. The\n\nprosecution could rely upon inference from trial court evidence that supported the two person\n\ntheory, i.e., that only Joey and Petitioner were in the Bocanegra home at the time of the murders.\n\nNotably, Petitioner did not challenge the evidence demonstrating that he struck Mr. Bocanegra\n\n(CT 481-82; RT 169, 184-185, 188, 196; RT 207) and that he grabbed Mrs. Bocanegra and told\n\nJoey to \u201cshut her up\u201d (CT 482-83, 504; RT 190-191). Evidence that, at some point, Reyes was\n\npresent in the house does not necessarily establish his participation in the murders. (See CT 202-\n\n203.)\n\nAdditionally, no theory inconsistent with the two assailant theory was advanced in\n\nReyes\u2019s separate criminal proceedings. Reyes pled guilty in his criminal proceeding on the\n\ntheory he participated in the Bocanegra murders only by acting as a lookout during the murders\n\nand then assisting Joey and Petitioner after the murders. See People v. Robert Gabriel Reyes,\n\nKern County Superior Court Case No. 34638, RT [10/3/91] 2-3; SResp. Ex. A. Even if there\n\nwere inconsistencies in testimony regarding the Reyes involvement in the Bocanegra murders,\n\ninconsistencies alone are not sufficient to establish that the prosecutor knowingly permitted the\n\nadmission of false testimony.

Review of Claim 35\n\nPetitioner alleges in this claim that the California Supreme Court affirmed his conviction\n\nand sentence on the basis of material misstatements and omissions of issues and facts, and then\n\ndenied rehearing, violating his Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n\nThe state supreme court considered this claim in the petition for rehearing. That court\n\nissued a modification opinion upon denial of rehearing (see 12 Cal. 4th 825b), corrected errors\n\nand withdrew the \u201cAlleged Prosecutorial Misconduct\u201d section of its opinion.\n\nPetitioner alleges that the state supreme court erred by not re-assessing or re-analyzing\n\nlegal issues in light of the modification.\n\nAppellate review of California\u2019s capital cases is authorized by California Penal Code\n\nsections 190.4(e) and 1239(b). At the time of Petitioner\u2019s trial, section 1239(b) provided,\n\n\u201c[w]hen upon any plea a judgment of death is rendered, an appeal is automatically taken by the\n\ndefendant without any action by him or his counsel.\u201d Even where defendant\u2019s counsel takes no\n\naction, California\u2019s high court has a duty to examine the complete trial record to \u201cascertain[]\n\nwhether defendant was given a fair trial.\u201d People v.

Sections 190.4(e) and 1239(b), and the cases construing\n\nthem, provide the mechanism for meaningful appellate review.\n\nPetitioner alleges misstatements regarding the Bocanegra murders; misstatements and\n\nomissions regarding disciplinary proceedings against Toton; misstatements and omissions\n\nregarding reporter immunity under California Shield Law; misstatements regarding alleged\n\nprosecutorial misconduct; and other misstatements and omissions. Nonetheless, the state\n\nsupreme court\u2019s affirmance was based on its modified opinion. Reasonably implicit in the\n\nmodified opinion is that court\u2019s re-examination of the issues underlying its issuance of the\n\nmodified opinion.\n\nAdditionally, Petitioner has not made a showing on the evidentiary record that the\n\nmodified opinion contained any misstatements or omission. In that no material misstatements or\n\nomissions are identified in the modified opinion, and given that court\u2019s adjudication of all\n\nPlaintiff\u2019s claims on the merits, this Court cannot find the state supreme court\u2019s determination of\n\nfacts to be unreasonable or unfair on the record before it.\n\nRespondent contends claim 35 is not cognizable because it creates and retroactively\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 106 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n107\n\napplies a \u201cnew rule\u201d of constitutional law within Teague v.

Marsh, 548 U.S. 163,\n\n173-74 (2006). If the \u201cstate system satisfies these requirements,\u201d then the \u201cState enjoys a range\n\nof discretion in imposing the death penalty, including the manner in which aggravating and\n\nmitigating circumstances are to be weighed.\u201d Id.

Review of Claim 36\n\nIn this claim Petitioner alleges that California\u2019s death penalty scheme in effect in 1987\n\nwas unconstitutional because it was arbitrary and unpredictable, failing to genuinely narrow class\n\nof murders eligible for the death penalty, violating his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n\nThe California Supreme Court summarily denied claim 34 (SPet.

In re Sanchez, S049502 (DD).\n\nThe state supreme court also considered this claim on appeal, as follows:\n\nDefendant contends that the 1978 death penalty law is unconstitutional under the\n\nUnited States and California Constitutions because it fails to narrow the class of\n\ndeath-eligible murderers and thus renders \u201cthe overwhelming majority of\n\nintentional first degree murderers\u201d death eligible. Defendant cites statistics of all\n\nfirst degree murder convictions in which a defendant was found death eligible,\n\nand concludes: \u201cThe vice of the California scheme is not that any one of the\n\nspecial circumstances taken alone is unconstitutional-each arguably identifies a\n\nsubclass of all first degree murders more deserving of the death penalty than other\n\nmembers of the class. The vice is that, taken together, the special circumstances\n\ncover virtually all first degree murders (and a substantial majority of all murders),\n\nand, thus, they perform no narrowing function at all.\u201d Principally, defendant relies\n\non Justice Blackman's dissent in Tuilaepa v. California, (1994) 512 U.S. ---, ---\n\n\n\n[129 L.Ed.2d 750, 767-774, 114 S. Ct. 2630], in which he stated: \u201cBy creating\n\nnearly 20 such special circumstances, California creates an extraordinarily large\n\ndeath pool.\u201d Id.\n\nWe have repeatedly considered and rejected this identical claim beginning with\n\nour decision in People v. Rodriguez (1986) 42 Cal.3d 730, 770-779. [Citation]\n\nMoreover, in Tuilaepa, supra, and in a number of previous cases, the high court\n\nhas recognized that \u201cthe proper degree of definition\u201d of death-eligibility factors\n\n\u201cis not susceptible of mathematical precision\u201d; the court has confirmed that our\n\ndeath penalty law avoids constitutional impediments because it is not\n\nunnecessarily vague, it suitably narrows the class of death-eligible persons, and\n\nprovides for an individualized penalty determination. [Citation] Defendant's\n\nargument fails to convince us to revisit the issue. [Citation]\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 60-61. In addition, the state supreme court has further held that:\n\nCalifornia's scheme for death eligibility satisfies the constitutional requirement\n\nthat it \u201cnot apply to every defendant convicted of a murder[, but only] to a\n\nsubclass of defendants convicted of murder. [Citation.]\u201d Even after 1990 additions\n\nby virtue of Propositions 114 and 115, the special circumstances set forth in the\n\nstatute are not over inclusive by their number or terms. [Citation] Nor have the\n\nstatutory categories been construed in an unduly expansive manner. [Citation]\n\nHaving been found guilty of an intentional murder in the course of a robbery,\n\ndefendant falls within the \u201csubclass\u201d of murderers who are eligible for the death\n\npenalty.

Penal Code \u00a7 190.2. As relevant here, one of the circumstances is:\n\n\u201c[t]he defendant, in this proceeding, has been convicted of more than one offense of murder in\n\nthe first or second degree.\u201d Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 190.2(a)(3). There is no question that this\n\nsentencing scheme satisfies clearly established constitutional requirements. First, the subclass of\n\ndefendants eligible for the death penalty is rationally narrowed to those who have committed\n\nmultiple murders. Tuilaepa, 512 U.S. at 969-73. The multiple murder special circumstance\n\nsufficiently guides the sentencer and is not unconstitutionally vague. See Godfrey v. Georgia,\n\n446 U.S. 420, 428 (1980) (the sentencer\u2019s discretion must be guided by \u201cclear and objective\n\nstandards.\u201d).\n\nIn California v. Ramos, 463 U.S. 992 (1983), the United States Supreme Court stated that\n\n\u201c[o]nce the jury finds that the defendant falls within the legislatively defined category of persons\n\neligible for the death penalty\u201d the jury\u2019s consideration of a myriad of factors and exercise of\n\n\u201cunbridled discretion\u201d in determining whether death is the appropriate punishment is not\n\narbitrary and capricious. Id. at 1008-09. At the selection stage, an individualized determination\n\nincludes consideration of the character and record of the defendant, the circumstances of the\n\ncrime, and an assessment of the defendant\u2019s culpability. Tuilaepa, 512 U.S. at 972-73.\n\nHowever, the jury \u201cneed not be instructed how to weigh any particular fact in the capital\n\nsentencing decision.\u201d Id. at 979.\n\nThis Court finds that state supreme court could reasonably have determined that\n\nCalifornia\u2019s death penalty scheme in effect in 1987 did not fail to genuinely narrow the class of\n\nmurderers eligible for the death penalty. California\u2019s scheme, which narrows the class of death\n\neligible offenders to less than the definition of first degree murder and permits consideration of\n\nall mitigating evidence, has been approved by the United States Supreme Court, Tuilaepa, 512\n\n\n\nU.S. at 972-79; Harris, 465 U.S. at 38, and this Court, see Ben-Sholom v.

In re Sanchez, S049502 (DD).\n\nThe California Supreme Court also considered and rejected this claim on appeal, finding\n\nthat the defense had waived the issue on appeal, Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th 65-66, and that the record\n\ndid not support the claim because it was \u201csimply a disagreement as to the interpretation of the\n\nevidence, and in no way indicates that Ryals encouraged or elicited false testimony from Boggs.\u201d\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 71.\n\nAs discussed above, the knowing use of false or perjured testimony against a defendant to\n\nobtain a conviction is unconstitutional. Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264 (1959). In Napue, the\n\nSupreme Court held that the knowing use of false testimony to obtain a conviction violates due\n\nprocess regardless of whether the prosecutor solicited the false testimony or merely allowed it to\n\ngo uncorrected when it appeared. Id. at 269.

To warrant habeas relief, Petitioner must establish that: 1) the\n\ntestimony was actually false; 2) the prosecution knew or should have known it to be false; and 3)\n\nthere is a reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the jury\u2019s verdict.\n\nTayborn, 251 F.3d at 1130.\n\nIn this claim, Petitioner alleges that Boggs, testifying at the penalty phase, falsely\n\nattributed to Petitioner a statement actually made by Reyes, that after the Tatman murder he\n\n\u201ckicked back, drank some whiskey, smoked some dope, ate some food, and mostly relaxed for\n\nthe rest of the evening.\u201d (RT 2663-2664.) Though Boggs correctly attributed the statement to\n\nReyes at the preliminary hearing (CT 308), Petitioner contends that prosecutor Ryals did not\n\ncorrect the false testimony at the penalty phase, instead using it to highlight Petitioner\u2019s lack of\n\nremorse. (RT 2619, 3036.)\n\nThe evidence before the state court did not reasonably suggest Boggs knowingly testified\n\nfalsely, or that Prosecutor Ryals was aware of the errant testimony. (SResp. Ex. B.) Boggs\n\nstates in his June 29, 1995 declaration that he mistakenly testified at the penalty phase that\n\nPetitioner, rather than Robert Reyes, stated that:\n\nThey returned to their own room and just, again in his own words, kicked back,\n\ndrank some whiskey, smoked some dope, ate some food, and just relaxed for the\n\nrest of the evening.\n\nSPet.

Tayborn, 251 F.3d 1125 at1130.\n\nPetitioner cites to facts alleged in claims 30 and 32 in support of this claim. However,\n\nthe state court could reasonably have found that the claim lacks merit. At the preliminary\n\nhearing (CT 376) and at the penalty phase of Petitioner\u2019s trial (RT 2813), Laskowski testified he\n\nwas able to determine from crime scene photographs that there were two types of shoes in the\n\nkitchen. The following year he re-examined the photographs and determined that there were\n\nthree types of shoe patterns in the kitchen and outside the Bocanegra home. (SPet. Ex. 121, p. 2;\n\nEx. 417, pp. 1-2; SHCP Ex. 137, Ex.

The Court finds that the Claim fails\n\nsubstantively for reasons stated in Claims 30 and 32, ante. The state court could reasonably\n\nconclude that neither Laskowski nor Ryals knew the former\u2019s interpretation was erroneous.\n\nNor is there a reasonable likelihood the erroneous testimony affected the jury\u2019s\n\nimposition of the death penalty, see Agurs, 427 U.S. at 103, or made trial so fundamentally\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 113 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n114\n\nunfair as to deny due process.

(SPet. Ex.\n\n520, p. 2; see CT 891-92; RT [5/16/88] 7; RT-108a-155a.)

He alleges that Holloway falsely testified at the penalty\n\nphase that Mr. Bocanegra\u2019s head wounds were a \u201ccontributory cause\u201d of death, contradicting his\n\nguilt phase testimony and prosecutor Ryals argument based thereon that head wounds neither\n\ncaused nor contributed to Mr. Bocanegra\u2019s death. Petitioner claims Ryals knew or should have\n\nknown this testimony was false.\n\nThe California Supreme Court summarily denied claim 39 (SPet.

Scott, 251 F.3d at 1130.\n\nHere, Dr. Holloway\u2019s testimony was consistent from preliminary hearing through penalty\n\nphase that Mr. Bocanegra died from three fatal stab wounds to the torso. (RT 2697, 2699-2700.)\n\nProsecutor Ryals argued as much in her opening statement. (RT 2620.) Holloway\u2019s preliminary\n\nhearing characterization of scalp wounds as an \u201cother condition\u201d attendant to fatal stab wounds,\n\n(CT 112-119, 158-59), and Holloway\u2019s penalty phase characterization of the same scalp wounds\n\nas a \u201ccontributory cause\u201d attendant to fatal stab wounds, (RT 2706), was not erroneous because\n\nHolloway used the terms interchangeably to characterize non-fatal wounds. (SPet. Ex. 120, pp.\n\n1-4.) The same applies to Mrs. Bocanegra, who also suffered scalp wounds but died from stab\n\nwounds.

Additionally, the state supreme court found as\n\nfollows:\n\n[A]ny error that did occur was harmless. As we explain in detail below, although\n\nthe prosecutor may have, at times, pushed the limits of proper advocacy, any\n\nmisconduct that did occur could not have contributed to the verdict and was thus\n\nrendered harmless.\n\nDefendant contends Ryals improperly told the jury that he was Tatman's actual\n\nkiller, and that Tatman was killed with a screwdriver seized from him. Defendant\n\nalso asserts that Ryals improperly treated defendant's conviction under section\n\n187 (without special circumstances) as a capital crime. Her argument, claims\n\ndefendant, violated the doctrines of collateral estoppel and double jeopardy, and\n\ndenied him his constitutional rights under both the state and federal Constitutions.\n\nDefendant's first claim, that the prosecutor improperly argued to the jury that he\n\nwas Tatman's actual killer, was based on the following comments made during the\n\nprosecutor's closing argument:\n\n\u201cFirst, Mr. Tatman, an old, sick man, wheelchair bound, living from payday to\n\npayday in the Bakersfield Inn, hardly a match for the defendant alone much less\n\nfor the defendant and his friend, Robert Reyes.\n\n\u201cThink of the old man lying in his bed, fearful because there were burglars in his\n\nlittle room at the Bakersfield Inn. Think of how that fear turned to horror as he\n\nrealized that they weren't just burglars but that they intended to take his life.\n\nImagine how he must have felt when they approached him.\n\n\u201cOf course, the defendant told the police that he had no actual part in the murder,\n\nthat he watched his buddy do it. But then, when you think of that, think that the\n\ndefendant learned to lie to authorities at an early age, I believe Dr. Wright said the\n\nthird grade. Remember that he denied to the police also anything or any facts\n\nconcerning the Bocanegra murders, but then remember what he told Rufus\n\nHernandez.\n\n\u201cHe told Rufus Hernandez what happened, how the two of them killed Mr.\n\nTatman, not how Robert [Reyes] killed Mr. Tatman or how he killed Mr. Tatman\n\nbut how they killed Mr. Tatman. Think of that when you are considering what the\n\npenalty in this case should be.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe two men could have taken the food. They could have taken the refrigerator.\n\nThey could have taken everything that was in that room and not touched that old\n\nman who weighed less than one hundred pounds. They could have gone into that\n\nroom, completely cleared it out, even stripped the bed clothes out from under him\n\nand never harmed him, never hurt him at all. But they didn't do that. The\n\ndefendant didn't do that. They chose, for some useless, senseless reason, to\n\ncommit an act of violence, the ultimate, ultimate act of violence, murder.\u201d\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 120 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n121\n\nIn her rebuttal, the prosecutor told the jury that it should not attempt to relitigate\n\nthe guilt phase facts, but then asked the jury to deliberate over what she had told\n\nit: \u201cYou do not know what evidence was presented in the previous hearing. You\n\nare not to re-litigate that at this time. You hear[d] the circumstances of the Tatman\n\n\n\nmurder. You know what the defendant told the police because you heard that. But\n\nyou also know what the defendant told Rufus Hernandez because you heard that.\n\nIt is up to you to weigh this and to deliberate on that and to determine who exactly\n\nstruck the fatal blow.\u201d\n\nDefendant asserts that the effect of the above argument was to ask \u201cthe jury to\n\ndisregard completely the trial court's not true verdict on the robbery murder\n\nspecial circumstance under Count I which implicitly and necessarily rejected the\n\ncharges that [defendant] was the actual killer in the Tatman homicide and that he\n\nharbored an intent to kill in committing the crime.\u201d Defendant claims Ryals's\n\nargument sought to elevate a noncapital murder to which defendant was an\n\naccomplice into a capital murder in violation of the guarantee against double\n\njeopardy following acquittal under the Fifth Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution and article I, section 15 of the California Constitution, and the related\n\ndoctrine of collateral estoppel. [Citation]\n\nIn making his argument, defendant points to the court's guilt phase verdict, in\n\nwhich the court found defendant acted as an accomplice (and not the actual killer)\n\nin the Tatman murder:\n\n\u201cAs to the first count [the Tatman murder], the Court finds defendant guilty of\n\nmurder and fixes that murder as murder in the first degree based on the felony\n\nmurder rule.\n\n\u201cThe Court finds that it is not true that the murder of Woodrow Wilson Tatman\n\nwas committed while the defendant was engaged in the commission or attempted\n\ncommission of a felony, to wit: The crime of robbery, within the meaning of the\n\nspecial circumstance section. That does not mean, I hasten to add, that I do not\n\nthink there was a robbery in progress; that simply means that I find that the\n\ndefendant was an aider and abettor of the robbery but that the homicide occurred\n\nin the commission of that, and therefore it's a first degree felony murder.\u201d\n\nThe People observe that this verdict appears inconsistent. The confusion over the\n\nverdict is highlighted by the fact that early in the guilt phase arguments, the\n\nprosecutor appeared to concede (and the court appeared to agree) that defendant\n\ncould be found guilty only of second degree felony murder in connection with the\n\nTatman killing. Of course, any inconsistency in the verdict was harmless in light\n\nof our law recognizing that accomplice status is sufficient to elevate a defendant's\n\ncomplicity in the crime to the robbery-murder special circumstance as long as\n\ndefendant acted with \u201cintent to kill.\u201d [Citation]\n\nWhat is clear from the verdict is the court's finding that defendant aided and\n\nabetted the robbery, and that the murder verdict was based on the felony-murder\n\nrule. It is less clear, however, whether the court found defendant was or was not\n\n\n\nthe actual killer. If we assume the court found the special circumstance untrue\n\nbecause the prosecution had proved neither that defendant was the actual killer,\n\nnor that he had the intent to kill, prosecutorial argument attempting to re-litigate\n\nthe guilt phase as to actual killer status was improper. [Citation] To the extent\n\nRyals crossed the line of proper argument, however, any misconduct was not\n\nprejudicial to defendant because it is not reasonably possible a result more\n\nfavorable to the defendant would have occurred.

(a)(3)), and the\n\njury was aware of defendant's prior violent criminal activity (\u00a7 190.3, factors (b)\n\n& (c)). Thus, Ryals's references to defendant's role in the Tatman murder could\n\nnot have affected the outcome of the penalty phase. [Citation]\n\nDefendant next claims that the prosecutor deliberately misled the jury by her\n\n\n\nopening statement comment that Tatman was actually murdered by Reyes with a\n\nscrewdriver that had been stolen from the Bocanegra residence and later found on\n\ndefendant's person. [Citation] Defendant asserts the prosecutor's comment\n\ncontradicted guilt phase evidence indicating that Tatman was mortally wounded\n\nby a \u201cmassive blunt force injury to the left chest,\u201d consistent with a heel stomp or\n\nblow by a similar object (with a dimension of two to three inches). According to\n\nthe autopsy report, the screwdriver wounds were superficial stab wounds that did\n\nnot actually contribute to Tatman's death. Accordingly, defendant contends, the\n\nprosecutor's misstatement of the evidence rendered the penalty phase\n\nfundamentally unfair. [Citation]\n\nAny inaccurate reference to the screwdriver as the actual murder weapon (or\n\ncomment that the weapon was found on defendant) could not properly be\n\ncharacterized as prejudicial or so egregious as to deny defendant a fair trial.\n\n[Citation] When, as here, the point focuses on the prosecutor's comments to the\n\njury, the question is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the jury\n\nconstrued or applied any of the complained-of remarks in an objectionable\n\nmanner. [Citation]\n\nHere, the jury was told that only nonfatal stab wounds were inflicted upon\n\nTatman. Forensic pathologist Holloway testified that the cause of Tatman's death\n\nwas massive blunt force injury to his chest. Holloway also stated that some of the\n\ninjuries sustained by Tatman were multiple superficial stab wounds to the chest\n\n\u201cnone of which would be construed as capable of a cause of death in themselves,\u201d\n\nand a superficial stab wound to the abdomen which \u201cwould not itself have been a\n\nfatal wound.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Bakersfield Police Detective Boggs testified that, on March 23, 1987,\n\ndefendant told him that after he and Reyes had entered Tatman's hotel room, he\n\nsaw Reyes standing over Tatman in a threatening manner with a screwdriver in\n\nhis hand, that Reyes \u201cfreaked out\u201d and stabbed Tatman with a screwdriver\n\nalthough defendant never saw the screwdriver enter Tatman's body, and that\n\nReyes \u201cpossessed the screwdriver at all times.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the jury was consistently admonished by the court that it was to\n\nconsider only the evidence presented, and that the opening statements of the\n\nlawyers were not to be considered evidence. The court admonished the jury that:\n\n\u201cThe important thing to remember is that what lawyers say in a trial, what they\n\nsay in their argument, what they say in their opening statements, those simply are\n\nnot evidence. They are just telling you what they expect to prove. You have to\n\ndecide this case, however, based on what you hear under oath from the witness\n\nstand or based on some documents or pictures that I admit for your consideration.\n\nWhat a lawyer says . . . is not evidence.\u201d [Citation] The court repeated its\n\nadmonition following closing arguments.\n\n\n\nTaken in context as an attempt to counter defense counsel's argument that\n\ndefendant did not participate in the Tatman killing, it is not reasonably possible\n\nthe prosecutor's alleged inaccurate remarks about the Tatman murder misled the\n\njury. [Citation] Moreover, the court's instruction that the lawyers' opening and\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 122 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n123\n\nclosing statements were not to be considered evidence by the jury vitiated the\n\nmisleading effect of any inaccurate remarks. The court's instructions are\n\ndeterminative in their statement of law, and we presume the jury treated the\n\ncourt's instructions as statements of law, and the prosecutor's comments as words\n\nspoken by an advocate in an attempt to persuade. [Citation] We cannot conclude\n\non this record that the prosecutor's isolated mischaracterization of the evidence in\n\nher opening statement misled the jury.\n\n\n\nDefendant also asserts that by discussing the circumstances of the Tatman killing\n\nduring the penalty phase, the prosecutor improperly misled the jury into believing\n\nit could sentence defendant to death for the murder of Tatman alone, when the\n\npenalty should have been considered only for the Bocanegra crimes, in which the\n\nmultiple-murder special circumstance was found true.\n\nDefendant's argument is misplaced. The circumstances of the Tatman crime were\n\nproperly argued as an aggravating factor under section 190.3, factor (a)\n\n(circumstances of the crime and the existence of any special circumstances found\n\nto be true pursuant to section 190.1). [Citation] Moreover, defense counsel\n\nreminded the jury of defendant's aider and abettor status in the Tatman murder\n\nwhen he stated: \u201cTed Sanchez did not kill Mr. Tatman nor did he share in Robert\n\nReyes's intent to kill Mr. Tatman. Ted's role in that tragic incident was limited to\n\nremoving some of Mr. Tatman's property.\u201d Hence, we find no prosecutorial error\n\noccurred in Ryals's discussion of the circumstances of the Tatman murder at the\n\npenalty phase.\n\nDefendant's other claims of prosecutorial misconduct to which there was no\n\ndefense objection are not supported by the record. For example, defendant's\n\ncontention that the prosecutor allowed Detective Boggs to testify falsely as to who\n\ntold him-Reyes or defendant-that both men had \u201ckicked back\u201d and \u201crelaxed\u201d after\n\nthe Tatman murder, is simply a disagreement as to the interpretation of the\n\nevidence, and in no way indicates that Ryals encouraged or elicited false\n\ntestimony from Boggs. In addition, the prosecutor did not commit misconduct in\n\nfailing to correct Dr. Holloway's characterization of the nonfatal scalp wounds to\n\nJuan Bocanegra as a \u201ccontributory cause\u201d rather than an \u201cother condition\u201d of\n\ndeath. The characterization of the scalp wounds as contributing to Juan's death\n\nwas minimally significant to the jury's assessment of defendant's culpability in the\n\nmurders. The facts showed that defendant struck disabling blows to the victim's\n\nhead while Joey was stabbing him. Moreover, any misperceptions of the cause of\n\nJuan's death were corrected by the prosecutor's opening statement that the wounds\n\ninflicted by defendant with a metal bar, \u201cwere not the actual blows that killed the\n\nman. They were only a part of what killed the man. The actual blow to the man\n\nwas the stab wound inflicted by his son while defendant was beating him in the\n\nhead with an iron pipe.\u201d\n\nFinally, defendant's claim that the prosecutor committed misconduct by asserting\n\nthat the Bocanegras would not have been killed without defendant's assistance is\n\nwithout merit. The evidence supported the view that defendant restrained both\n\nvictims while Joey Bocanegra stabbed them. \u201cThe argument came well within the\n\nbroad discretion of the parties to state their views as to what the evidence shows\n\nand what inferences may be drawn therefrom.\u201d [Citation]\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 66-72.\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 123 of 213\n\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n124\n\nPetitioner alleges that prosecutor Ryals improperly argued and misstated evidence, that\n\nthe Bocanegra and Tatman murders would not have occurred but for Petitioner\u2019s participation,\n\nthat the jury was sentencing Petitioner for the Tatman murder, and that Petitioner stabbed Mr.\n\nTatman to death, (See SHCP Ex. 124, \u00b6 16), with a screwdriver (RT 2619.) Petitioner contends\n\nthat the correct facts are that Petitioner was only vicariously liable in the murders, that Mr.\n\nTatman was killed by blunt force rather than stab wounds (CT 109; RT 2695), and Petitioner was\n\nsentenced by the trial court to 25 years to life for the Tatman conviction.\n\nThe Court finds that the state court could reasonably have concluded this claim lacks\n\nmerit. Petitioner contends the prosecution misled the jury into thinking it was sentencing\n\nPetitioner for the Tatman murder (RT 3047-3048), i.e., as a triple murderer (RT 3080), when in\n\nfact the trial court was responsible for sentencing Petitioner for the Tatman murder, which was a\n\nnon-capital murder. (CT 1103; RT October 31, 1988 at p. 13.) Even if the prosecution argued\n\n\n\nthat Petitioner played a principal role in the Tatman murder, the state court could reasonably\n\nhave determined no prejudice resulted. The Tatman conviction was presented to the jury as\n\nevidence in aggravation. The jury was appropriately admonished and instructed in this regard.\n\n(RT 2615-2616; CT 979-1021; RT 3082-3097.) The record included testimony of pathologist,\n\nDr. Holloway that Mr. Tatman died of blunt force injury to his chest. (RT 2695.) Nothing in the\n\nevidentiary record suggests the trial court\u2019s admonishment and jury instructions were not\n\nunderstood and followed. Moreover, the penalty phase evidence in aggravation was substantial\n\nas discussed in claims 1 through 4, ante.\n\nThe record suggests that, as to Mr. Tatman, it was Petitioner\u2019s decision to \u201chit the old\n\nman\u201d and take his food and refrigerator, that Petitioner and Reyes entered Mr. Tatman\u2019s room,\n\nthat Reyes made stabbing motions at Mr. Tatman with a screwdriver, and that Petitioner stole\n\nMr. Tatman\u2019s possessions after witnessing his murder.

(RT 2858-2861.)\n\nThe jury was made well aware that Mr. Tatman\u2019s stabbing wounds were non-fatal\n\ninjuries and that Petitioner\u2019s conviction for Mr. Tatman\u2019s murder was based on his aiding and\n\nabetting Reyes. (Id.; RT 235, 2693-2695.) Defense counsel made its argument to the jury that\n\nPetitioner did not intend to kill Mr. Tatman.\n\nRyals\u2019 argument that Petitioner had a principal role in the Bocanegra homicides, and that\n\nthe Bocanegras would not have been killed without his assistance, did not in all reasonable\n\nlikelihood mislead the jury or affect the death sentence imposed. The evidence weighed heavily\n\nagainst Petitioner as an aider and abettor of the homicides. Petitioner grabbed and held Mr.\n\nBocanegra while Joey got a knife. (RT 2843, 2853-54.) Petitioner beat Mr. Bocanegra while\n\nJoey stabbed him. (RT 2696-2706, 2719-21, 2725, 2843-44, 2854, 2858.) Petitioner rushed\n\nMrs. Bocanegra and told Joey to \u201cshut her up.\u201d (RT 2844, 2858.) Petitioner pushed Mrs.\n\nBocanegra into a back room and hit her on the head with a bar while Joey stabbed her. (RT\n\n2710-14, 2720-21, 2725, 2752, 2844.) This occurred Mrs. Bocanegra\u2019s hands were bound and\n\nshe was likely gagged.

Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687-88.\n\nIn the context of the penalty phase, just as in the guilt phase, the Supreme Court has\n\n\u201cdeclined to articulate specific guidelines for appropriate attorney conduct and instead [has]\n\n\n\nemphasized that \u2018[t]he proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness\n\nunder prevailing professional norms.\u2019\u201d Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 521 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S.\n\nat 688). In the penalty phase, defense counsel has an \u201cobligation to conduct a thorough\n\ninvestigation of the defendant's background,\u201d Williams, 529 U.S. at 396, and defense counsel has\n\na duty to investigate, develop, and present mitigation evidence during penalty phase proceedings,\n\nWiggins, 539 U.S. at 521-23. Counsel has a duty to make a \u201cdiligent investigation into his\n\nclient's troubling background and unique personal circumstances.\u201d Williams, 529 U.S. at 415\n\n(O'Connor, J., concurring).\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court has recognized that the duty to investigate does not require\n\ndefense counsel \u201cto scour the globe on the off chance something will turn up; reasonably diligent\n\ncounsel may draw a line when they have good reason to think further investigation would be a\n\nwaste.\u201d Rompilla v.

The Strickland court stated:\n\n[S]trategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to\n\nplausible options are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made after\n\nless than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that\n\nreasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation. In\n\nother words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a\n\nreasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary. In any\n\nineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate must be directly\n\nassessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of\n\ndeference to counsel's judgments.\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 127 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n128\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 690-691.\n\n\u201cIn assessing counsel's investigation, the Court must conduct an objective review of their\n\nperformance, measured for reasonableness under prevailing professional norms,\u201d Strickland, 466\n\nU.S. at 688, which includes a context-dependent consideration of the challenged conduct as seen\n\n\u201cfrom counsel's perspective at the time,\u201d id., at 689 (\u201c[e]very effort [must] be made to eliminate\n\nthe distorting effects of hindsight\u201d).\u201d Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 523. Further, the reasonableness of\n\ncounsel\u2019s actions may be determined or substantially influenced by the defendant\u2019s own\n\nstatements or actions. Counsel\u2019s actions are usually based, quite properly, on informed strategic\n\nchoices made by the defendant and on information supplied by the defendant. In particular, what\n\ninvestigation decisions are reasonable depends critically on such information. Strickland, 466\n\nU.S. at 691.\n\nIn order to demonstrate prejudice, Petitioner must show \u201ca reasonable probability that,\n\nbut for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d\n\nId. at 693-94. To assess that probability, the reviewing court must consider the totality of the\n\navailable mitigation evidence and reweigh it against the evidence in aggravation.

(emphasis\n\nadded).\n\nPetitioner states that defense counsel Frank was aware that proper penalty phase\n\npreparation had not been completed when the penalty trial started. Petitioner faults Frank for\n\nfailing to fully investigate neurological, psychiatric, drug use and social history defenses.\n\nPetitioner points to retained social historian Dr. Wright, who found the penalty preparations\n\n\n\ndisorganized. (SHCP Ex. 131, Att. B, \u00b6 6.) This disorganization, according to Dr. Wright, was\n\nexacerbated by the accelerated penalty phase time line following trial waiver at the guilt and\n\nspecial circumstances phase, (SHCP Ex. 137, \u00b6 16), and by defense counsel\u2019s delay in paying\n\ndefense service providers. (SHCP Ex. 137, Att. B, \u00b6 16.) Dr. Wright also suggested aspects of\n\nthe penalty defense were not completed by the time of the penalty trial (SHCP Ex. 137, App. B,\n\n\u00b6\u00b6 11-14), such that defense counsel should have requested a continuance. (SHCP Ex. 137, \u00b6\u00b6\n\n10-21.)\n\nHowever, the state court could reasonably find here, as it did in claim 13, ante, that\n\nadditional preparation time was unnecessary. Defense counsel consulted with a serologist and\n\nretained defense psychologist Donaldson in 1987. (RT [5/16/88] 3-4.) Defense counsel Frank,\n\nwho was responsible for the penalty phase, had almost completed his preparation when, on July\n\n14, 1988, Petitioner waived jury trial on guilt and special circumstances. (CT 892; RT-115a;\n\nSPet. Ex. 113, pp. 5-6.) By Frank\u2019s own estimate, his preparations were to be complete by July\n\n25, 1988. (RT [5/16/88] 6.) This was reasonably sufficient time given that the penalty phase did\n\nnot begin until September 21, 1988. (CT 949.) Defense counsel Frank was able to complete his\n\ndefense investigation prior to the penalty phase. (RT [5/16/88] 3-6.) During this time, Frank\n\nretained Dr. Wright to prepare the social history (SHCP Ex. 137, Att. B, \u00b6 3), and hired defense\n\ninvestigators Peninger and McGregor. (SHCP Ex. 124, \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.) Given the foregoing, the state\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 129 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n130\n\ncourt could reasonably have found Dr. Wright allegations relating to inadequate trial preparation,\n\nif considered evidence, to be unpersuasive.\n\nDefense counsel, having already been granted a partially opposed three week continuance\n\non the eve of trial, could reasonably have concluded that a further continuance was unlikely.\n\n(RT [5/16/88] 5-6; CT 713-714.) Moreover, a further continuance was contrary to Petitioner\u2019s\n\nstated desire to plead guilty to the Bocanegra murders. (SPet. Ex. 520, p. 2; SPet. Ex. 700.)\n\nPetitioner waived jury trial (RT [5/16/88] 7-8) and submitted guilt and special circumstances\n\nphase on the preliminary hearing transcript and the testimony of additional prosecution\n\nwitnesses. See Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 23-30. Dr. Wright\u2019s suggestion a continuance would have\n\nbeen granted could have been viewed as speculative.\n\nPetitioner also alleges his defense was affected by publicity of the pending disbarment\n\nproceedings against defense counsel Toton. Petitioner asserts that defense Counsel Toton\n\nreceived substantial adverse publicity in the Bakersfield Californian from his impending\n\ndebarment some two weeks before jury selection. However, the record does not demonstrate that\n\njurors had knowledge of the debarment proceedings or that the jury was unfair or biased as to\n\nToton\u2019s disciplinary matter. As discussed in claims 49 and 55, post, the California Supreme\n\nCourt reasonably have determined that there was \u201cno showing the jury was unfair or biased.\u201d\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal. 4th at 62, n.6. That court noted that, during voir dire, only two of the jurors\n\nselected, Razo and Rodriguez, had heard of the case. (RT 1814-1815; 2458-2460, 2471.)\n\nNeither of those two jurors mentioned having hearing of Toton. Both of those jurors indicated\n\nthey could put what they had heard out of mind while deliberating. Id. Petitioner proffers no\n\nevidence these statements were untrue.\n\nIt is well-established that \u201cjuror impartiality . . . does not require ignorance.\u201d Skilling v.\n\nUnited States, 561 U.S. 358, 360 (2010) 81 (citing Irvin v.

Virginia, 500 U.S. 415, 427 (1991).\n\nHere, for the reasons stated, the California Supreme Court could reasonably have\n\nconcluded that there was no reasonable likelihood that Petitioner did not receive a fair trial\n\ndespite limited pretrial publicity. Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 61. \u201cA fair assessment of attorney\n\nperformance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight . . .\n\nand to evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at the time.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689.\n\nBearing that in mind, and as discussed in the claims above, the penalty phase evidence against\n\nPetitioner was substantial. Nothing suggests a reasonable likelihood of a more favorable\n\noutcome had there been a further continuance.\n\n\n\nAccordingly, the state court could have reasonably determined that there was no\n\ncompetent evidence of juror bias arising from Toton\u2019s state bar difficulties and related publicity.\n\nPetitioner has not established that defense counsel\u2019s failure to seek a further continuance to\n\nprepare for the penalty trial and to avoid adverse publicity fell below an objective standard of\n\nreasonableness and that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding\n\nwould have been different. Strickland, 466 U.S., at 687-694.\n\nA fair-minded jurist could have found that the state court rejection of the claim was\n\nneither contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as\n\ndetermined by the Supreme Court, nor an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n\nevidence presented in the state court proceeding. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nClaim 43 is denied.\n\nc.

Claim MM) raised in\n\nPetitioner\u2019s state petition for habeas corpus. In re Sanchez, S049502 (DD). In this case, \u201cthe\n\nhabeas petitioner\u2019s burden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis for the\n\nstate court to deny relief,\u201d Richter, 562 U.S. at 98, and this Court \u201cmust determine what\n\narguments or theories supported or . . . could have supported, the state court\u2019s decision; and then\n\nit must ask whether it is possible fair-minded jurists could disagree that those arguments or\n\ntheories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this Court.\u201d Id. (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\nThe Court finds that Petitioner has not made a sufficient showing that he was prejudiced\n\nby defense counsel\u2019s failure to further investigate and present mitigating evidence of the\n\nBocanegra homicides, for the reasons discussed below.\n\ni. Jailhouse Informant Hernandez\n\nThe Court finds that, for reasons discussed in claims 2 and 7, the decision of defense\n\ncounsel not to further investigate and impeach jailhouse informant Hernandez regarding\n\nsubstance abuse and heroin addiction (SCHP Exhs. 112, \u00b6 10; 137, \u00b6 37; 113, \u00b6 34), and his\n\nchanging testimony to inculpate Petitioner as an equal participant in all three homicides (CT 488;\n\nRT 2842-44), could reasonably reflect counsel\u2019s lack of knowledge of sufficient supporting facts.\n\n(SHCP Exhs. 137, \u00b6 37; 113, \u00b6 34; 112, \u00b6 4.)\n\nAdditionally, it appears unlikely such impeachment would have been effective. See\n\nclaims 2, 7, ante; see also Burger, 483 U.S. at 795 (failure to pursue fruitless or harmful\n\ninvestigation not unreasonable). The evidentiary record did not demonstrate that Hernandez, by\n\nvirtue of his alleged substance addition, his plea deal, or otherwise, was motivated to and did\n\ntestify falsely or inaccurately. (SPet. Ex. 900, pp. 4, 11; SResp. Ex. B.) Defense counsel Toton\n\ncross-examined Hernandez at the preliminary hearing and asked Hernandez about any\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 132 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n133\n\nundisclosed plea deal during cross-examination in the guilt and special circumstances phase.\n\n(CT 576-577.) Hernandez\u2019s testimony was consistent with Petitioner\u2019s statements and the\n\nphysical evidence. (CT 355, 378-380; 576-77.) Hernandez was not offered any disposition of\n\npending criminal matters prior to agreeing to testify at the Petitioner\u2019s proceeding. (Id.; See\n\nSResp. Ex. B.) Toton later cross-examined Hernandez during the penalty phase. Hernandez\n\nadmitted a deal on a then pending charge in exchange for his testimony. (RT 2850-2857.) As\n\ndiscussed in claim 7, ante, Hernandez\u2019s testimony was not false or misleading.\n\nAccordingly, the state court could reasonably have found that defense counsel were not\n\ndeficient in the decision not to conduct additional investigation of Hernandez to impeach him.\n\nii. Jailhouse Informant Seeley\n\nThe Court finds that for reasons discussed in claims 2 and 8, the decision of defense\n\ncounsel not to further investigate alleged statements of jailhouse informant Charles Seeley\n\nregarding Reyes\u2019s involvement in the Bocanegra homicides, could have been a reasonable trial\n\ntactic given the evidentiary record. Toton had dealt with Seeley in a separate matter and based\n\nthereon doubted Seeley\u2019s credibility and whether the prosecution would call him. (SPet. Ex.\n\n137, p. 4.) Seeley\u2019s version of events seemed contrary to the physical evidence at the Bocanegra\n\ncrime scene. (SPet. Ex. 419, pp. 5-6, 17; CT 355-382.) See e.g., Denham, 954 F.2d at 1505-06\n\n(9th Cir. 1992) (defense counsel not ineffective where decision not to call witness based on\n\ninconsistencies in witness\u2019s testimony).\n\nAlso, Seeley\u2019s testimony could reasonably have been viewed as more inculpating of\n\n\n\nPetitioner than was Hernandez\u2019s testimony. (SPet. Ex. 419, pp. 6-8, 18-19.) Seeley\u2019s testimony\n\nwould have been subject to rebuttal by the substantial contrary evidence from Hernandez,\n\nStratton, Trihey, as well as by the crime scene physical evidence.\n\nDefendant counsel Frank, for his part, had a tactical reason for not interviewing Seeley to\n\nthe extent any evidence provided by Seeley related only to the guilt and special circumstances\n\nphase that were handled by Toton. (See SPet. Ex. 113, p. 4.)\n\nAccordingly, the state court could reasonably have found that defense counsel was not\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 133 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n134\n\ndeficient in the decision not to conduct further investigation of Seeley and present him as a\n\ndefense witness.\n\niii. Joey Bocanegra\n\nThe Court finds that, for reasons discussed in claims 2 and 9, the evidentiary record could\n\n\n\nreasonably support as trial tactics, the failure of defense counsel to further investigate and\n\npresent evidence about Joey\u2019s role in the murders of his parents including Joey\u2019s history of\n\nviolence, violent temper, PCP use around the time of the murders, and the sudden fight with Mr.\n\nBocanegra that preceded the murder. There was substantial evidence that Petitioner aided and\n\nabetted the Bocanegra murders with premeditation and deliberation. (See claims 1-8.) So much\n\nso that defense counsel chose not to object to the prosecution\u2019s two assailant theory.\n\nPetitioner has not made an evidentiary showing of prejudice regarding evidence about\n\nJoey. In the face of such substantial evidence of guilt, the state court could reasonably have\n\ndetermined that a showing of Joey\u2019s temper and prior assaultive conduct would not have raised a\n\nreasonable doubt that Petitioner aided and abetted the premeditated and deliberate murders of\n\nMr. Bocanegra and Mrs. Bocanegra. Moreover, such a defense was contrary to Petitioner\u2019s\n\nstated desire to plead guilty to the Bocanegra murders (SPet. Ex. 520, p. 2) and \u201cdying for his\n\ncrimes but dying with a clear conscience.\u201d (SPet. Ex. 700.) Petitioner waived jury trial and\n\nsubmitted guilt and special circumstances phase on the preliminary hearing transcript and the\n\ntestimony of additional prosecution witnesses. See Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 23-30.\n\nThe state court could reasonably have found that the record did not suggest that evidence\n\nabout Joey would have changed the result, given Petitioner\u2019s incriminating statements to\n\ndetective Stratton and reporter Trihey and the crime scene evidence corroborated by Hernandez\u2019s\n\ntestimony, (see claims 1-4, ante), supporting Petitioner\u2019s intent to aid and abet the murders.\n\nThe state court could reasonably have found that defense counsel was not deficient in the\n\ndecision not to conduct additional investigation of Joey Bocanegra regarding his role in the\n\nmurders of his parents.\n\niv.

(Pet. Ex. 121, p. 2; Ex. 417, pp. 1-\n\n2; SHCP 137, Ex. A.) Petitioner argues further investigation could have shown that Reyes, not\n\nPetitioner, caused the scalp wounds. However, Reyes admitted in subsequent proceedings that\n\nhe served as lookout during the murders and entered the residence only afterwards to assist\n\nPetitioner and Joey. (SResp., Ex. A.) Evidence of Petitioner\u2019s shoeprint in the kitchen also\n\nundermines Seeley\u2019s testimony that Petitioner watched the assault on Mr. Bocanegra from the\n\nhallway. (SHCP, Ex. 419, pp. 6, 7, 22-23.) Evidence suggesting the presence of a third nonvictim\n\nin the Bocanegra Home does not does demonstrate or suggest a third person was present\n\nduring the murders. (See claim 30, 32, ante.) Significantly, defense counsel did not to object to\n\nthe two assailant theory (SHCP Ex. 137, \u00b6 22) and the state record suggests this decision was not\n\nunreasonable.\n\nPetitioner also revisits testimony by Dr. Holloway that the scalp wounds were non-fatal.\n\n(CT 119, 158-159.) Petitioner argues that further investigation could have shown the blows to\n\nthe head were not of such force as would show an intent to kill. However, as discussed in claims\n\n1 and 3, there was substantial evidence of Petitioner\u2019s aider and abetter liability. The violent\n\nnature and extended duration of the struggles with Mr. Bocanegra and Mrs. Bocanegra, with\n\nJoey taking time to get a kitchen knife, and Petitioner attempting to subdue and restrain each of\n\nthe victims during Joey\u2019s assault on them, along with the multiple stab and blunt force wounds\n\ninflicted during room to room struggle with the victims, reasonably suggest a plan to kill them.\n\n(CT112-120; 149-156; 159; 167; 181; 192-194; 357-383; 479-483; 488.) Each victim suffered\n\nmultiple stab wounds (id.) and was left unassisted to hemorrhage to death. (CT 114-119.) There\n\nwas evidence Mrs. Bocanegra\u2019s wrists had been tied together and that she had been gagged.

Defense counsel could reasonably have determined to focus limited\n\nresources elsewhere.\n\nAdditionally, there is no reasonable likelihood that the foregoing testimony of Laskowski\n\nand Holloway affected the jury\u2019s imposition of the death penalty, see Agurs, 427 U.S. at 103, or\n\nmade trial so fundamentally unfair as to deny due process. Donnelly, 416 U.S. at 645. The\n\nevidence against Petitioner was substantial. A fair-minded jurist could conclude from the\n\nevidence and statements Petitioner made to Hernandez and Detective Stratton, that Petitioner\n\nassisted Joey in murdering Mr. Bocanegra and Mrs. Bocanegra (RT 2843-45, 2851-2854, 2856-\n\n59) and that he desired to enter a guilty plea. (SPet. Ex. 520, p. 2; see CT 891-92; RT [5/16/88]\n\n7; RT- 108a-155a.)\n\n\n\nDefense counsel\u2019s failure to further investigate and rebut the prosecution\u2019s physical\n\nevidence supporting the two assailant theory was not unreasonable given the evidentiary record.\n\nv. Mental Defenses\n\nThe Court finds that, for the reasons discussed in claims 2 and 6, the failure of defense\n\ncounsel to further investigate and present mitigating evidence of Petitioner\u2019s organic brain\n\ndamage and psychiatric impairments could reasonably be justified by a lack of supporting\n\nevidence. (SHCP Exhs. 113, \u00b6 31; 139, \u00b6 11; 136, \u00b6 10.) The evidentiary record suggests that\n\nPetitioner was not under the influence of phencyclidine (PCP), marijuana, or alcohol at the time\n\nof the Bocanegra and Tatman murders. The evidence proffered by Petitioner suggests a history\n\nof substance abuse (SPet. Exhs. 105, pp. 64-65, 74-75; 110, p. 1; 119, p. 8; 123, p.1; 128, pp. 1-\n\n2), continuing through the weeks prior to the murders. (SPet. Ex. 105, pp. 85-87.) However,\n\nRespondent correctly points to the absence of competent evidence that Petitioner ingested and/or\n\nwas under the influence of phencyclidine, marijuana, or alcohol on the days the Bocanegra and\n\nTatman murders occurred.\n\nAs discussed in claim 6, defense psychologist Donaldson did not recommended to\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 136 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n\n\n27\n\n28\n\n137\n\ndefense counsel that a neuropsychological evaluation be performed.

Petitioner told Matychowiak that he planned to tell the jury he was\n\nguilty and \u201cget it over with.\u201d (SPet. Ex. 520, p. 2.) Dr. Matychowiak found Petitioner\n\ncompetent to stand trial. (SPet. Ex. 520, p. 2-6.)\n\nThe state court could reasonably have found that defense counsel were not deficient in\n\nthe decision not to conduct additional investigation of mental state defenses.\n\nAccordingly, all the foregoing allegations of failure to investigate and present mitigating\n\nevidence are insubstantial when considered cumulatively for the reasons stated. See Karterman,\n\n60 F.3d at 580.\n\nFor the reasons stated, a fair-minded jurist could have found that the state court rejection\n\nof this claim was neither contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established\n\nfederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court, nor an unreasonable determination of the facts\n\nin light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nClaim 44 is denied.\n\nd. Review of Claim 45\n\nIn his next claim, Petitioner alleges ineffective assistance by counsel\u2019s failure to object to\n\nadmission of prejudicial crime scene and autopsy photographs.\n\nThe California Supreme Court summarily denied claim 44 (SPet. Claim NN) raised in\n\nPetitioner\u2019s state petition for habeas corpus. In re Sanchez, S049502 (DD).\n\nThe state supreme court also considered and rejected this claim on appeal:\n\nThe trial court admitted into evidence 44 photographs, including 2 photographs of\n\nthe autopsies of Juan and Juanita Bocanegra depicting the extensive nature of\n\ntheir scalp wounds. (Exhibits Nos. 13 & 14.) The autopsy photographs had been\n\nexcluded from the guilt phase following a successful motion in limine by\n\ndefendant. The trial court overruled defendant's objection to the admission of the\n\nautopsy photographs, however, for the penalty phase. We first review his\n\ncontention that the trial court erred in admitting the autopsy photographs because\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 137 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n138\n\nthey were cumulative, misleading and inflammatory, and their prejudicial effect\n\nsubstantially outweighed their probative value.\n\nIn overruling defendant's objection, the court stated: \u201cThese scalp wounds are\n\nabsolutely very important that the jury see. And they are not the kind of autopsy\n\npictures-they're bad, I'll say that, all autopsy pictures are bad, but they're not the\n\nblood and guts type of thing that you sometimes see in autopsy pictures. And I\n\nthink the prejudicial effect is far, far, far, and I can't stress it enough, outweighed\n\nby the probative value of these scalp wounds.\u201d\n\nDefendant contends the trial court committed prejudicial error in admitting\n\nExhibits Nos. 13 and 14 in violation of his right to a fair trial and reliable penalty\n\ndetermination under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the federal\n\nConstitution. The thrust of his argument is that the photos were not relevant to the\n\npenalty determination, were cumulative to the testimony of Dr. Holloway (the\n\nforensic pathologist who performed the autopsies on the Bocanegras), and\n\nseriously misled the jury as to defendant's culpability in the Bocanegra murders.\n\n\n\nIn sum, the sole purpose of allowing the photographs, defendant asserts, was to\n\nimproperly shock and horrify the jury.\n\nDefendant points to the prosecutor's explanation to the jury as to why she believed\n\nthe autopsy photographs were important evidence and asserts her comment\n\nactually exploited the prejudicial effect of the evidence: \u201cYou will have the\n\npictures available to you. Look at the scalp wounds. You make the decision. But\n\nwhatever, [Mrs. Bocanegra] would not have been killed but for the help of Teddy\n\nBrian Sanchez, and he is just as guilty of the murder as Joey Bocanegra.\u201d\n\nDefendant claims that because the probative value of the photographs was clearly\n\noutweighed by their prejudicial effect, their admission violated his constitutional\n\nrights.\n\nThe decision whether to admit photographs is within the trial court's discretion\n\nand will not be disturbed unless their prejudicial effect substantially outweighs\n\ntheir probative value. [Citation] We have examined Exhibits Nos. 13 and 14 and\n\nhave determined they are not so horrific or shocking that we can conclude the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion in admitting them. [Citation] The jury was familiar\n\nwith the facts of the crime, and the photographs had substantial probative value in\n\ndemonstrating defendant's culpability as an aider and abettor, and as corroborative\n\nof Hernandez's testimony implicating defendant in the crimes. Moreover, the\n\nprobative value of the photographs was not diminished simply because the scalp\n\nwounds alone were not fatal to the victims. The photographs corroborated the\n\ntestimonial evidence and were relevant to a determination of the appropriateness\n\nof the death penalty. [Citation]\n\nDefendant's claim that there was no dispute as to the circumstances of the murders\n\nis not supported by the facts. Defense counsel Frank argued at the penalty phase\n\nthat defendant should be spared the death penalty if the jury had a \u201clingering\n\ndoubt\u201d about the extent of defendant's participation in the Bocanegra killings.\n\nNor is defendant assisted by People v. Love (1960) 53 Cal.2d 843, 856-857, in\n\nwhich we held that the trial court's admission of a photograph showing the\n\nvictim's face as she was dying, and of a tape recording of her last words as she lay\n\non a hospital table in extreme pain, was prejudicial because it \u201cserved primarily to\n\ninflame the passions of the jurors.\u201d [Citation] Here, by contrast, the autopsy\n\nphotographs depicting the Bocanegras' scalp wounds were clearly probative of (i)\n\nthe manner in which the victims were wounded, (ii) defendant's culpability as an\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 138 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n139\n\naider and abettor, (iii) the malice and aggravation of the crime, and (iv) the\n\nappropriate ultimate penalty. [Citation]\n\nBecause we find no error in admitting the autopsy photographs, we need not\n\naddress defendant's claims that admission of other photographs during the penalty\n\nphase (Exhibits Nos. 9, 18, 19 & 25, depicting the wounds on the Bocanegras and\n\nTatman) did not render harmless the prejudicial effect of the autopsy photos. Nor\n\ndo we address defendant's related argument that, assuming we conclude the\n\nadmission of these photographs \u201cundercut the prejudice resulting from the\n\nadmission\u201d of the autopsy photographs, trial counsel was ineffective for failing to\n\nobject to their admission. Neither argument is persuasive in light of our\n\nconclusion that the court did not err in admitting the autopsy photographs at the\n\npenalty phase.\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 63-65.\n\nA due process claim can be stated where graphic photos of victims make the trial\n\nfundamentally unfair. Jammal, 926 F.2d at 919. However, photos that are relevant to the crime\n\ncharges and elements thereof are admissible. See Villafuerte v. Lewis, 75 F.3d 1330, 1343\n\n(1996). Under California law, \u201cphotographs which disclose the manner in which the victim was\n\nwounded are relevant on the issues of malice and aggravation of the crime and the penalty.\u201d\n\n\n\nPeople v. Thompson, 50 Cal.3d 134, 182 (1990).\n\nPetitioner, citing in support to claim 56, post, alleges the jury was allowed to view\n\ninflammatory and prejudicial autopsy, crime scene and victim photographs (RT 2891-2892),\n\ndepicting graphic and gory injuries unrelated to actions attributed to Petitioner, which should\n\nhave been excluded under California Evidence Code section 352, and that caused the penalty\n\ntrial to be fundamentally unfair. He claims there was no tactical reason not to object to these\n\nphotographs.\n\nThe state record shows that defense counsel Toton did move to exclude all photographs\n\nduring the guilt phase (RT-30a-33a). At the penalty phase, two autopsy photos of Mr. Bocanegra\n\nand Juanita\u2019s scalp wounds (People\u2019s Exhs. 13, 14) were admitted, over the defense\u2019s objection,\n\n(RT 2876, 2880-2281, 2285, 2891-2892), and the victim photos were admitted without objection.\n\n(RT 2891).\n\nHowever, the state court could reasonably find that Petitioner was not prejudiced by\n\nintroduction of the photos or failure of defense counsel to object to them. The Court agrees with\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 139 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n\n\n27\n\n28\n\n140\n\nthe state court reasoning in finding the photographs relevant and probative of charges and\n\nelements including intent to kill, aggravation and penalty.\n\nNor does the failure to object necessarily demonstrate ineffective assistance. See Nefstad\n\nv. Baldwin, 66 F.3d 335 at *3 (9th Cir. 1995) (holding no violation of due process where\n\nprosecutor during closing argument shows photographs of victim before and after murder\n\nbecause relevant to intent).\n\nEven without the photographs, it is not reasonably probable the jury would have returned\n\na sentence less than death given the evidence in aggravation including the circumstances\n\nsurrounding the murders of the Bocanegras and Mr. Tatman, and Petitioner\u2019s 1982 assaults on\n\nAmmarie and Pena. (RT 2863-2874.)\n\nAccordingly, the state court could reasonable have found that Petitioner failed to make an\n\nevidentiary showing that defense counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of\n\nreasonableness and that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding\n\nwould have been different. Strickland, 466 U.S., at 687-694.\n\nIt follows that the state court rejection of the claim was neither contrary to, or an\n\nunreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, nor based on an unreasonable\n\ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.

(emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n Petitioner alleges that he was prejudiced by Boggs\u2019s false testimony attributing to\n\nPetitioner the lack of remorse shown by Reyes following the Tatman murder, i.e., that Reyes and\n\nPetitioner \u201ckicked back, drank some whiskey, smoked some dope, ate some food, and just\n\nrelaxed for the rest of the evening.\u201d (RT 2663-64; SPet. Ex. 100.) An error that Ryals also made\n\nin her opening argument. (RT 2619.) Petitioner faults his counsel for failure to cross-examine\n\nBoggs, and failure to introduce evidence of Petitioner\u2019s remorse expressed to reporter Trihey and\n\nhis friends Robin and Debbie Lozano.\n\nThe Court is not persuaded by this claim. Petitioner\u2019s contention regarding to Boggs\u2019s\n\nallegedly false testimony and defense counsel\u2019s failure to cross-examine Boggs on this issue fails\n\nsubstantively for reasons discussed in claim 37, i.e., the state court could reasonably have\n\nconcluded that prosecutor Ryals did not know of and knowingly rely upon Boggs\u2019s erroneous\n\ntestimony, (SPet. Exhs. 137, p. 12; 113, p.10; SResp. Ex. B), and there is no reasonable\n\nlikelihood the error affected the result of trial or caused an unfair trial.\n\nPetitioner also alleges prejudice from Ryals\u2019s opening argument in which she made\n\nreference to Boggs\u2019s errant testimony. Under California law, the absence or presence of remorse\n\nis a factor relevant to the jury\u2019s penalty determination. People v. Ghent, 43 Cal.3d 739, 771\n\n(1987); see also Harris v. Pulley, 885 F.2d 1354, 1384 (9th Cir. 1988). The prosecutor\u2019s\n\n\n\ncomment is impermissible only where it is \u201cmanifestly intended to call attention to the\n\ndefendant's failure to testify or is of such a character that the jury would naturally and necessarily\n\ntake it to be a comment on the failure to testify.\u201d Beardslee v. Woodford, 358 F.3d 560, 586 (9th\n\nCir. 2003). Here the prosecution evidence of lack of remorse did not refer to Petitioner\u2019s failure\n\nto testify, but rather to statements that were already in evidence.\n\nAdditionally, there is not a reasonable probability that statements of remorse to Trihey\n\nand acquaintances, the Lozanos, even if taken as admissible evidence of remorse, could have\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 141 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n142\n\naffected the jury\u2019s imposition of the death penalty. Statements of remorse to Trihey were\n\nthemselves inculpating. (SPet. Ex. 113, p. 12.) Moreover, a lack of remorse is in any event\n\nsuggested by Petitioner\u2019s statements describing Mr. Tatman\u2019s murder and robbery, his intention\n\nto rob Mr. Tatman, how Reyes stabbed Mr. Tatman, and how Petitioner and Reyes then took Mr.\n\nTatman\u2019s things back to their room. (RT 2658-2666.) Tactical reasons for not presenting\n\n\n\nremorse evidence are reasonably suggested by hearsay issues relating to Petitioner\u2019s proffer (Pet.\n\n719) and the defense strategy to not admit guilt but rather focus on \u201cresidual or lingering doubt.\u201d\n\n(SPet. Ex. 113, pp. 8-12.)\n\nThe state court could have reasonably believed that Petitioner\u2019s confession to Boggs of\n\nthe circumstances surrounding Tatman\u2019s murder and Petitioner\u2019s involvement in it would have\n\nundercut any sympathy toward him by the jury. (See RT 2658-2666.) Moreover, defense\n\ncounsel could reasonably have decided that a lingering doubt defense and mitigating social\n\nhistory might well have been weakened by evidence of remorse. (See RT 3053-3055, 3063-\n\n3064.)\n\nThe Court finds that Petitioner has not established that defense counsel\u2019s performance fell\n\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness and that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors,\n\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different. Strickland, 466 U.S., at 687-694.\n\nFor the reasons stated, a fair-minded jurist could have found that Petitioner failed to\n\nestablish that the state court rejection of the claim was contrary to, or an unreasonable\n\napplication of, clearly established federal law, or an or an unreasonable determination of the\n\nfacts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding, viewed most favoring the\n\nprosecution.

(emphasis\n\nadded).\n\nThe trial record reveals Mr. Ammarie, the store keeper victim in one incident, testified at\n\nthe penalty phase that, on May 7, 1982, Petitioner assaulted him when Ammarie refused to \u201cget\n\n[Petitioner] some bacon.\u201d Petitioner stabbed Ammarie in the left shoulder and neck, took money\n\nand ran away, leaving Ammarie in the hospital for two weeks. (RT 2862-2866; see Sanchez, 12\n\nCal.4th at 22.) The victim in the other incident, Mr. Pena, a friend of and Petitioner, testified at\n\nthe penalty phase that Petitioner, without any provocation, stabbed him three times with a\n\nkitchen knife and demanded money, leaving Pena hospitalized for two days. (RT 2868-74.)\n\nPetitioner contends that, as to the Ammarie and Pena crimes, defense counsel failed to\n\ninvestigate and present mitigating evidence of Petitioner\u2019s emotional and family turmoil,\n\npossible PCP psychosis, organic brain damage, and belief he acted in self-defense in these\n\nincidents. Petitioner claims there was no tactical reason for these omissions.\n\nThe Court finds this claim unavailing. Petitioner does not offer facts showing the nature\n\nand extent of the investigation conducted by defense counsel Frank, or what information if any,\n\nPetitioner provided to defense counsel Frank in preparation for the penalty phase, or what\n\nPetitioner did, if anything, to cooperate in developing mitigating penalty phase evidence.

Petitioner offers in support the 1995 opinion of a clinical psychologist, Jeri Doane, as to the\n\neffect of losses and turmoil in his personal life (SPet. Ex. 105, pp. 75-78), as well as anecdotal\n\nassertions of Petitioner and others regarding potential mental and other defenses to his 1982\n\ncriminal conduct. (SPet. Exhs. 105, pp. 1-5, 79-82, 99- 100; 802; 506, pp.6-8; 128, p. 2.)\n\nBut even assuming this type of mitigating information could be competent evidence, it\n\ndoes not suggest Petitioner informed defense counsel in this proceeding of the existence of this\n\nmitigating information, or that defense counsel in this proceeding was otherwise aware of it or\n\n\n\nshould have been aware of it. Moreover, defense counsel Frank could reasonably have believed\n\nsuch information, if developed, would have little if any mitigating value. Petitioner does not\n\ndispute that he was convicted of the 1982 crimes. Post hac assertion of defenses to convictions\n\nsuffered years prior could reasonably be found to have little if any mitigating value. As to\n\nmental defenses, the lack of supporting evidence (see claim 6), and the fact that Petitioner was\n\nconvicted for these 1982 offenses, could reasonably suggest further investigation was\n\nunwarranted. Based on the evidentiary record, defense counsel could reasonably presume viable\n\ndefenses in the 1982 proceedings were raised therein.\n\nThese defenses would not advance defense counsel Frank\u2019s tactic of lingering doubt.\n\n\u201cRare are the situations in which the \u2018wide latitude counsel must have in making tactical\n\ndecisions\u2019 will be limited to any one technique or approach.\u201d Richter, 131 S.

Wiggins, 539\n\nU.S., at 525, 123 S. Ct. 2527, or would have been apparent from documents any\n\nreasonable attorney would have obtained, cf. Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374,\n\n389\u2013393, 125 S. Ct. 2456, 162 L.Ed.2d 360 (2005). It is instead a case, like\n\nStrickland itself, in which defense counsel's \u201cdecision not to seek more\u201d\n\nmitigating evidence from the defendant's background \u201cthan was already in hand\u201d\n\nfell \u201cwell within the range of professionally reasonable judgments.\u201d\n\nBobby v. Van Hook, 558 U.S. 4, 11-12 (2009) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 699).\n\nAdditionally, even if defense counsel Frank\u2019s investigation and presentation relating to\n\nthe 1982 crimes was deficient, there was no reasonable probability such mitigation evidence\n\ncould have affected the jury\u2019s imposition of the death penalty given the noted substantial\n\nevidence against Petitioner. The state court could reasonably have concluded that defense\n\ncounsel\u2019s investigation was adequate given the above noted facts underlying these prior criminal\n\nconvictions, defense counsel Frank\u2019s theory of lingering doubt and the social and personal\n\nhistory mitigation evidence discussed in claims 6, 26, ante.\n\nFor these reasons, Petitioner has failed to overcome the strong presumption that counsel\n\nmade decisions in the exercise of professional judgment. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690. Even if\n\ndefense counsel had discovered this evidence and still chose to proceed with his strategy as\n\nopposed to the strategy Petitioner now advocates, a fair-minded jurist could conclude that his\n\ndecision was reasonable. \u201cCounsel was entitled to formulate a strategy that was reasonable at the\n\ntime and to balance limited resources in accord with effective trial tactics and strategies.\u201d\n\nRichter, 562 U.S. at 107. \u201c[T]he Sixth Amendment guarantees reasonable competence, not\n\nperfect advocacy judged with the benefit of hindsight.\u201d Yarborough, 540 U.S. at 8.\n\nPetitioner fails to demonstrate that no reasonable jurist could have found that he failed to\n\nmake a prima facie showing that defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance during the\n\npenalty phase of the trial relating to mitigating the 1982 criminal convictions.\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 145 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n146\n\nFor the reasons stated, a fair-minded jurist could have found that the state court rejection\n\nof this claim was neither contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established\n\nfederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court, nor an unreasonable determination of the facts\n\nin light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.

Review of Claim 48\n\nPetitioner next claims ineffective assistance by counsel\u2019s failure to fully and completely\n\ndevelop and present adequate and reliable evidence about Petitioner\u2019s character, background, and\n\nbehavior.\n\nThe California Supreme Court summarily denied claim 48 (SPet. Claim QQ) raised in\n\nPetitioner\u2019s state petition for habeas corpus. In re Sanchez, S049502 (DD). In this case, \u201cthe\n\nhabeas petitioner\u2019s burden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis for the\n\nstate court to deny relief,\u201d Richter, 562 U.S. at 98, and this Court \u201cmust determine what\n\narguments or theories supported or . . . could have supported, the state court\u2019s decision; and then\n\nit must ask whether it is possible fair-minded jurists could disagree that those arguments or\n\ntheories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this Court.\u201d Id. (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n\n\nPetitioner, citing to facts alleged in claim 6, contends that background and character\n\ntestimony from four family members as well as social anthropologist Isabel Wright did not fully\n\npresent evidence of his unstable family life, sporadic education, disabling physical violence,\n\nabuse, deprivation, and emotional suffering of his childhood and adolescence his caring for\n\nsiblings and heavy drug use. He alleges that defense counsel Frank, consistent with Wright\u2019s\n\nrequests, should have presented a full social history prepared by a social anthropologist, along\n\nwith evidence of organic brain damage and psychiatric disorders prepared by a psychologist or\n\npsychiatrist, such as included with his state petition.

Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 605 n.12 (1978).\n\nThe Court does not find that Petitioner was prejudiced by any failure of defense counsel\n\nto develop and present complete, adequate, and reliable evidence of Petitioner\u2019s character,\n\nbackground, and behavior at the time of the Bocanegra and Tatman homicides.\n\nDefense counsel Frank, while arguing for life without the possibility of parole, (RT 2895-\n\n2896, 2910, 2923, 2928, 3021), did present the following significant mitigating background and\n\ncharacter evidence from family members including Petitioner\u2019s wife and retained social\n\nanthropologist Dr. Wright. (RT 2897, 2912, 2928, 2930, 3007-3008, 3017.) Petitioner\u2019s mother\n\nbecame pregnant with him when she was fifteen. (RT 2897-2898, 2943-2945.) His mother\n\nturned to alcohol and drugs (2899-2900, 2902-2903) and embarked upon a succession of\n\nunstable and unsupportive marriages and relationships. Petitioner experienced an impoverished,\n\nnomadic, neglected and sometimes abusive upbringing with little positive parental or adult\n\nsupervision. (RT 2902-2941, 2958-2964, 3003-3006.) He lived in a car and then cheap motels.\n\n(RT 2904, 2908, 2918-2919.) His parents drank and argued, (RT 2905, 2909), and sometimes\n\nphysically abused Petitioner (RT 2907, 2985.) His siblings were removed from the home for\n\nadoption. (RT 2913-2914, 2941, 2970, 2978-83.)

His attempts at job training and employment\n\n(RT 2996-2997) were short-lived because of his lack of skills and education. (RT 3003-3004.)\n\nDefense Counsel Frank presented evidence that Petitioner nonetheless showed concern\n\nand care for his siblings, sometimes stealing food for them. (RT 2920.) Petitioner\u2019s\n\ngrandmother, to whom he was close, died in 1982 (RT 3000). Petitioner\u2019s mother died from\n\nalcohol related complications at age thirty-eight while he was in prison for the 1982 Ammarie\n\nand Pena stabbings. (RT 2897, 2912, 2916, 3001.) Petitioner\u2019s step-father also died from\n\ncomplication of alcohol. (RT 2919, 2961.) Petitioner lived a transient existence after his release\n\nfrom prison in 1986. (RT 3001-3002.) Petitioner was unable to find work and resorted to drugs.\n\n(Id.) Petitioner married Robin Alvarado shortly before his 1988 homicide trial, (RT 2925, 2928),\n\nand prior to that cared for her children. (RT 2927, 3000, 3018-3019.) Social anthropologist, Dr.\n\nWright, testified that the major influences in Petitioner\u2019s life were his migratory lifestyle\n\nsecondary to poverty and inconsistent family relationships. (RT 2939, 3003, 3006.)\n\nThe evidentiary record demonstrates defense counsel argued all the foregoing in urging\n\nthe jury to return a life sentence without the possibility of parole for the then twenty-five year old\n\nPetitioner. (RT 2895-2896, 2910, 2923, 2928, 3021.) Moreover, prosecutor Ryals, in her\n\nargument to the jury, acknowledged there were mitigating factors in Petitioner\u2019s background and\n\ncharacter that evoked sympathy for him. (RT 3043-3047, 3079.)\n\nThe Court finds that, given the substantial inculpating evidence against Petitioner, it is\n\nnot reasonably probable that Petitioner would have received a more favorable sentence had\n\nfurther evidence of his background, character and behavior been presented. In particular,\n\npresentation of additional evidence regarding Petitioner\u2019s substance abuse would not have\n\nnecessarily added weight to his case for mitigation. See Cullen, 131 S.

Strickland, 466 U.S., at 687-694.\n\nFor the reasons stated, a fair-minded jurist could have found that Petitioner failed to\n\nestablish that the state court rejection of the claim was contrary to, or an unreasonable\n\napplication of, clearly established federal law, or an unreasonable determination of the facts in\n\n\n\nlight of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding, viewed most favoring the\n\nprosecution. Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nClaim 48 is denied.\n\nh. Review of Claim 49\n\nPetitioner alleges defense counsel was ineffective by failing to request that the trial court\n\nvoir dire prospective jurors about adverse publicity from Bakersfield Californian articles relating\n\nto debarment proceedings against defense counsel Toton.\n\nThe California Supreme Court summarily denied claim 49 (SPet. Claim RR) raised in\n\nPetitioner\u2019s state petition for habeas corpus. In re Sanchez, S049502 (DD).\n\nThe state supreme court considered and rejected this claim on direct appeal:\n\n[I]t is evident from the record that defendant failed to preserve his claim of\n\nimproper voir dire by objecting to the court's questioning during trial. [Citation]\n\nOn the merits, our review of the record shows the trial court's voir dire adequately\n\ninsured an impartial jury, without unnecessarily exposing the jury to the very\n\ninformation defendant found could prejudice his case . . . .\n\nThe trial court assisted counsel and to ensure a fair and impartial jury by requiring\n\nthe 201 prospective jurors to fill out a one-page questionnaire asking the panel\n\nmembers whether they had ever heard of the case, and if so, to name their source.\n\n[Citation] Of the jurors eventually selected to serve, eight told the court they had\n\nnever heard of defendant's case, were not familiar with counsel, and either did not\n\nsubscribe to or did not read on a consistent basis the Bakersfield Californian.

Their knowledge of the\n\ncase did not include any specific information regarding Toton's pending\n\ndisbarment. Thus, it appears that the trial court acted well within its discretion in\n\nproposing the general question of the jurors' knowledge of Toton's pending\n\ndisbarment without unnecessarily educating the jury about that matter. The trial\n\ncourt's strategy thus avoided informing the jury of Toton's troubles, while\n\nassuring defendant a fair and impartial jury. [Citation] Under these facts, we find\n\nthe trial court did not err in limiting voir dire to general questions concerning\n\npretrial publicity. [Citation]\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 61-63. The record demonstrates that defense counsel Toton agreed,\n\nreasoning that questioning jurors about the publicity was likely to be more prejudicial than that\n\npublicity itself. (SHCP Ex. 137, \u00b6 29). This Court finds the tactic not unreasonable.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment secures to criminal defendants the right to trial by an impartial\n\njury. Skilling, 561 U.S. at 377-78; Irvin, 366 U.S. at 722. Nevertheless, \u201cjuror impartiality, we\n\nhave reiterated, does not require ignorance.\u201d Skilling, 561 U.S. at 381 (citing Irvin, 366 U.S. at\n\n722) (jurors are not required to be \u201ctotally ignorant of the facts and issues involved.\u201d). To merit\n\nrelief for violation of his due process rights due to pretrial publicity, Petitioner must demonstrate\n\nthat the case is one in which prejudice is presumed, or he must demonstrate actual prejudice.\n\nSkilling, 561 U.S. at 379, 385.\n\n\n\n\u201cA presumption of prejudice . . . attends only the extreme case.\u201d Id. at 381. The\n\nSupreme Court has determined that pretrial publicity so manifestly tainted a criminal prosecution\n\nthat prejudice must be presumed in only three cases: Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U.S. 723, 726-27\n\n(1963) (televised confession); Estes v. Texas, 381 U.S. 532, 536 (1965) (massive pretrial media\n\ninterference); and Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 355-356 (1966) (months of virulent\n\npretrial publicity).\n\n\u201cTo establish actual prejudice, the defendant must demonstrate that the jurors exhibited\n\nactual partiality or hostility that could not be laid aside.\u201d United States v. Sherwood, 98 F.3d\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 150 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n151\n\n402, 410 (9th Cir. 1996). When pretrial publicity is at issue, \u201cprimary reliance on the judgment\n\nof the trial court makes [especially] good sense\u201d because the judge \u201csits in the locale where the\n\npublicity is said to have had its effect\u201d and may base her evaluation on her \u201cown perception of\n\n\n\nthe depth and extent of news stories that might influence a juror.\u201d Mu'Min, 500 U.S., at 427.\n\nAppellate courts making after-the-fact assessments of the media's impact on jurors should be\n\nmindful that their judgments lack the on-the-spot comprehension of the situation possessed by\n\ntrial judges. Skilling, 561 U.S. at 386.\n\nPetitioner contends that neither the trial court nor defense counsel asked prospective\n\njurors about newspaper the articles appearing in the Bakersfield Californian two weeks before\n\njury selection that discussed the impending debarment of lead defense counsel Toton. He\n\nmaintains there was no tactical reason for not questioning jurors about these newspaper articles\n\nand that jurors prejudiced thereby may have been empaneled.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s case is immediately distinguishable from Estes and Sheppard. He does not\n\nallege, nor is there any evidence, that media coverage of attorney disciplinary proceedings\n\ninterfered with his right to a fair trial. See Skilling, 561 U.S. at 382 n.14 (\u201cSkilling's reliance on\n\nEstes and Sheppard is particularly misplaced; those cases involved media interference with\n\ncourtroom proceedings during trial. [Citation] Skilling does not assert that news coverage\n\nreached and influenced his jury after it was empaneled.\u201d). Rideau is the only case in which the\n\nSupreme Court overturned a conviction based on pretrial publicity.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s case also is readily distinguished from Rideau. See Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th at\n\n61-63.

The coverage in this case was neither all pervasive nor constant leading up to\n\ntrial. Certainly there was no barrage of inflammatory publicity immediately prior to trial or in\n\nthe six months leading up to trial. Based on the foregoing, the state court reasonably could have\n\nconcluded that this was not an extreme case wherein prejudice should be presumed from pretrial\n\npublicity.\n\nAs discussed above and in claim 55, post, the trial judge considered the impact of pretrial\n\npublicity on the jurors who served on Petitioner\u2019s case.

Moreover,\n\neven if defense counsel\u2019s failure to request voir dire about attorney discipline publicity was\n\ndeficient performance, nothing in the evidentiary record suggests presumed or actual prejudice.\n\nThe noted substantial evidence against Petitioner suggested no reasonable probability of a more\n\nfavorable outcome even had defense counsel requested voir dire about publicity from Toton\u2019s\n\ndisciplinary proceeding.\n\nThe state court could reasonably have concluded that Petitioner failed to establish that\n\ndefense counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that, but\n\nfor counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\n\n\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S., at 687-694. For the reasons above, this Court agrees with the state court\n\nthat there was no reasonable likelihood that Petitioner did not receive a fair trial despite the\n\nlimited voir dire regarding pretrial publicity.\n\nAccordingly, the state court\u2019s rejection of this claim was not contrary to, or an\n\nunreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, or an unreasonable determination of\n\nthe facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding, viewed most favoring\n\nthe prosecution.

In any event, we\n\nfind no reasonable probability that defense counsel's failure to object prejudiced\n\ndefendant's case.\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 71.\n\nPetitioner faults defense counsel\u2019s failure to object when prosecutor Ryals argued in\n\nclosing that Petitioner killed Mr. Tatman, suggesting the jury was sentencing Petitioner for the\n\nTatman homicide, and argued that the Bocanegras would not have been killed but for the actions\n\nof Petitioner.\n\nHowever, the state court, based on the record before it, could have found it reasonable for\n\nthe defense not to object in such circumstances. (See claim 42; see also Flieger v. Delo, 16 F.3d\n\n878, 886 (8th Cir. 1994) (reasonable trial strategies do not amount to ineffective assistance even\n\nwhere unsuccessful).\n\nThe Tatman conviction was presented to the jury as evidence in aggravation and the jury\n\nappropriately admonished and instructed in this regard. Prosecution argument that Petitioner had\n\na principal role in the Tatman killing, and that the Bocanegras would not have been killed\n\nwithout his assistance, did not in all reasonable likelihood mislead the jury or affect the death\n\nsentence imposed. The weight of evidence against Petitioner as an aider and abettor of the\n\nhomicides was substantial. Evidence showed that Petitioner grabbed and held Mr. Bocanegra\n\nwhile Joey got a knife (RT 2843, 2853-54); that Petitioner beat Mr. Bocanegra while Joey\n\nstabbed him (RT 2696-2706, 2719-21, 2725, 2843-44, 2854, 2858); that Petitioner rushed Mrs.\n\nBocanegra and told Joey to \u201cshut her up\u201d (RT 2844, 2858); that Petitioner pushed Mrs.\n\nBocanegra into a back room and hit her on the head with a bar while Joey stabbed her (RT 2710-\n\n14, 2720-21, 2725, 2752, 2844), and that while this occurred Mrs. Bocanegra\u2019s hands were\n\nbound and she was likely gagged (RT 2708, 2723, 2749-51, 2754-55, 2774-2775).\n\nMoreover, the jury certainly was made well aware that Mr. Tatman\u2019s stabbing wounds\n\nwere non-fatal injuries and that Petitioner\u2019s conviction for Mr. Tatman\u2019s murder was based on\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 154 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n155\n\nhis aiding and abetting Reyes.

The evidence\n\nagainst Petitioner was not insubstantial considering the multiple murder special circumstance in\n\nthe Bocanegra murders and the substantial evidence in aggravation presented during the penalty\n\nphase. There is no reasonably likelihood the outcome would have been different absent the\n\nalleged prosecutorial misconduct. See Donnelly, 416 U.S. at 643 (improper jury argument by the\n\nstate does not present a claim of constitutional magnitude unless it is so prejudicial that the\n\npetitioner\u2019s trial was fundamentally unfair . . .

To this end, Petitioner repeats his allegations in claims 7, 42 and 50, ante,\n\nthat defense counsel failed to point out evidence discrediting prosecution informant Hernandez\n\n(RT 2842, 2847-2848, 3051), and that Petitioner never told Hernandez that he (Petitioner) had\n\nstabbed anyone, (RT 2847-2848), and that he (Petitioner) did not inflict the fatal stab wounds\n\nupon the Bocanegras, (RT 2846), and that he (Petitioner) had no robbery motive. (RT 2852.)\n\nNonetheless, for the reasons stated in claims 7, 42 and 50, the state court could reasonably have\n\nfound that the performance of defense counsel was not deficient and did not prejudice the\n\noutcome of trial proceedings.\n\nThe trial judge appropriately admonished the jury that argument is not evidence. As to\n\nthe evidence, the state court could reasonably have found it weighed substantially against the\n\nPetitioner as an aider and abettor of the homicides. The murders occurred about one month after\n\nPetitioner\u2019s release from prison for the 1982 assaults. (RT 2877-2879 2973-2974.) The evidence\n\nreasonably showed that Petitioner grabbed and held Mr. Bocanegra while Joey got a knife (RT\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 156 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n157\n\n2843-2854), beat Mr. Bocanegra while Joey stabbed him (RT 2696-2706, 2719-2721, 2725,\n\n2843-2844, 2854, 2858), rushed Mrs. Bocanegra and told Joey to \u201cshut her up\u201d (RT 2844, 2858),\n\npushed Mrs. Bocanegra into a back room while Joey stabbed her, hitting her on the head with a\n\nbar (RT 2710-2714, 2720-2721, 2725, 2752, 2844), and that Mrs. Bocanegra\u2019s hands were bound\n\nand she was likely gagged (RT 2708, 2723, 2749-2751, 2754-2755, 2774-2775).\n\nThe state court also could have reasonably determined there was no basis upon which\n\nPetitioner could have effectively impeached Hernandez. Petitioner has not shown that\n\nHernandez gave contradictory, inconsistent or false testimony, or that Hernandez was motivated\n\nby an undisclosed plea bargain. No facts or discrepancies between the testimony and the\n\nphysical evidence establish or compel the conclusion that Hernandez, by virtue of his alleged\n\nsubstance addition, his plea deal, or otherwise, was motivated to and did testify falsely or\n\ninaccurately. (SPet. Ex. 900, pp. 4, 11; SResp. Ex. B.) Having cross-examined Hernandez at the\n\npreliminary hearing, Toton determined on that basis not to interview him. (SPet. Ex. 137, p. 4.)\n\nDuring cross-examination at the guilt and special circumstance phase, Hernandez\u2019s testimony\n\nwas consistent with Petitioner\u2019s statements and the physical evidence that he had not been\n\noffered any disposition of then pending criminal matters prior to agreeing to testify at the\n\nPetitioner prosecution. (CT 576-577.) During cross-examination at the penalty phase,\n\nHernandez admitted a deal on a then pending charge in exchange for his testimony in Petitioner.\n\n(RT 2850-2851.) Petitioner has not demonstrated that Hernandez\u2019s testimony was false or\n\nmisleading, or that defense counsel acted unreasonably in not interviewing Hernandez.\n\nPetitioner goes on to argue that defense counsel failed to explain the Bocanegra and\n\nTatman evidence and verdicts, and failed to dispel the suggestion Tatman homicide was a capital\n\ncrime for which they would sentence Petitioner (RT 3055), and failed to support the \u201clingering\n\n\n\ndoubt\u201d defense (RT 3063-3082). Petitioner points out that, as discussed in claim 42, prosecutor\n\nRyals improperly argued that the jury was to decide whether Petitioner killed Mr. Tatman. (RT\n\n3034-3036.) However, the record reflects that defense counsel pointed out improper argument\n\nand reminded the jury of the evidence presented in favor of the lingering doubt defense.

(RT 235, 2693-2695.) Defense counsel made his\n\nargument to the jury that Petitioner did not intend to kill Mr. Tatman (CT 109; RT 2695), and the\n\nBocanegras (CT 479, 500; see SHCP Ex. 419), and that there may have been a third assailant in\n\nthe Bocanegra murders. (Pet. Exhs. 121, p. 2; 417, pp. 1-2; SHCP Ex. 137, Att. A.) Given\n\nPetitioner\u2019s desire to plead guilty to the Bocanegra murders, (SPet. Exhs. 520, p. 2; 700), the\n\n\n\nunrebutted evidence presented at the penalty phase, the admonitions of the trial judge that\n\nargument is not evidence, and the potential aggravating and mitigating effects of circumstances\n\nsurrounding the Tatman murder, it is not reasonably probable that even had defense counsel\n\nfurther responded to Ms. Ryals\u2019s closing statements, a different sentence would have been\n\nreturned.\n\nAccordingly, it could reasonably be found that the prosecution arguments were not so\n\nprejudicial as to make trial fundamentally unfair. See Donnelly, 416 U.S. at 643 (improper jury\n\nargument by the state does not present a claim of constitutional magnitude unless it is so\n\nprejudicial that the petitioner\u2019s trial was fundamentally unfair . . .

Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nClaim 52 is denied.\n\nl. Review of Claim 53\n\nIn this claim, Petitioner alleges ineffective assistance of counsel due to conflict of interest\n\narising from publicity about defense counsel Toton\u2019s pending disbarment.\n\nThe California Supreme Court summarily denied claim 53 (SPet. Claim VV) raised in\n\nPetitioner\u2019s state petition for habeas corpus. In re Sanchez, S049502 (DD). In this case, \u201cthe\n\n\n\nhabeas petitioner\u2019s burden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis for the\n\nstate court to deny relief,\u201d Richter, 562 U.S. at 98, and this Court \u201cmust determine what\n\narguments or theories supported or . . . could have supported, the state court\u2019s decision; and then\n\nit must ask whether it is possible fair-minded jurists could disagree that those arguments or\n\ntheories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this Court.\u201d Id. (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\nThe Sixth Amendment provides that a criminal defendant shall have the right to \u201cthe\n\nAssistance of Counsel for his defense.\u201d As a general matter, a defendant alleging a Sixth\n\nAmendment violation must demonstrate \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s\n\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Strickland, 466\n\nU.S. at 694. An exception exists for cases in which counsel actively represents conflicting\n\ninterests. Mickens, 535 U.S. at 166; Cuyler, 446 U.S. at 345-50. In such a case, prejudice is\n\npresumed. Id. However, Petitioner must establish that \u201can actual conflict of interest actually\n\naffected the adequacy of [defense counsel\u2019s] representation.\u201d Sullivan, 446 U.S. at 348-49.\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 160 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n\n\n27\n\n28\n\n161\n\nThus, \u201cuntil a defendant shows that his counsel actively represented conflicting interests, he has\n\nnot established the constitutional predicate for his claim of ineffective assistance.\u201d Id., at 350\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\nPetitioner cites to the facts in claims 23, 24 and 43 and alleges that lead defense counsel\n\nToton\u2019s disbarment publicity placed Toton in an actual conflict of interest of a personal and\n\nfinancial nature, preventing his effective assistance at penalty phase in ways not fully disclosed\n\nto Petitioner. The trial judge, according to Petitioner, did not adequately inquire into the matter\n\nand thereby allowed Toton to remain on the case. Petitioner alleges the trial judge never\n\nquestioned Toton specifically about the debarment (Sealed RT July 26, 1988, at pp. 80-84),\n\nnever obtained a copy of the debarment hearing decision, and agreed to Toton\u2019s proposal to have\n\nco-defense counsel Frank talk to Petitioner about the debarment. (Id., at p. 82-84.) Petitioner\n\nasserts that Toton sought to avoid the issue of debarment. Toton refused to appear at the\n\ndebarment hearing. (SHCP Ex. 517, p. 8.) He refused to comment to reporters about the issue.\n\n(SCHP Exhs. 703, 704.)\n\nThis Court finds it unlikely that Toton\u2019s pending debarment influenced his actions as\n\ndefense counsel, for reasons discussed by the state court. See Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 45-48,\n\nsummarized as follows. Toton\u2019s refusal to allow Petitioner to plead guilty lengthened rather than\n\nshortened the duration of this proceeding. Toton participated in arrangements for defense\n\ninvestigation and engaged in pre-trial preparation. (RT [5/16/88] 3-4.) He conducted pre-trial\n\ndiscovery (CT 649-663, 769), made preemptory challenges (CT 836-840) filed evidentiary\n\nmotions (CT 841-45, 846-53, 854-58, RT 80, 97-113), conducted vigorous witness examination\n\nand cross-examination (CT 518-625; RT 2664-2670), and made a reasoned closing argument\n\n(RT 169-196). The evidentiary record simply does not suggest the pace, manner and method of\n\nToton\u2019s representation was influenced by the disciplinary proceedings. Toton was not disbarred\n\nuntil eight months after the court and defendant learned of the proceedings against him, and\n\nseveral month after completion of the penalty phase of defendant\u2019s trial. Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th at\n\n45-48.\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 161 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n162\n\nEven if there were a conflict, Petitioner was aware of the possible problems with Toton\u2019s\n\ncontinued representation and his right to conflict free representation, having discussed these\n\nmatters with co-counsel Frank for approximately an hour and he expressly waived any such\n\nconflict. Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 46; RT [7/27/88] 4-10. Based thereon, the state supreme court\n\ncould reasonably have found that Petitioner validly waived any such conflict on the record and\n\ndecided to keep Toton as counsel. See Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 37-39, 45-46.\n\nPetitioner alleges that it was likely that one or more jurors was aware of Toton\u2019s adverse\n\npublicity and, given Toton\u2019s failure to withdraw, was prejudiced by it. However, he offers no\n\nevidentiary predicate supporting the allegation. The evidence does not suggest the trial court\u2019s\n\nfailure to question juror\u2019s about Toton\u2019s debarment rendered trial \u201cfundamentally unfair.\u201d (See\n\nRT 591-609 (juror Jones), RT 647-669 (juror Mooney), RT 1168-1183 (juror Roberts), RT 1338-\n\n1355 (juror Crowder), RT 1813-1831 (juror Razo), RT 1879-1892 (juror Stell), RT 2117-2136\n\n(juror G.

For reasons\n\nmore fully discussed in claims 49 ante, and 55, post, this Court agrees with the California\n\nSupreme Court\u2019s determination that there was \u201cno showing the jury was unfair or biased.\u201d\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal. 4th at 62, n.6. As noted by that court, during voir dire only two of the jurors\n\nselected, Razo and Rodriguez, had heard of the case. (RT 1814-1815; 2458-2460, 2471.)\n\nNeither of those two jurors mentioned having hearing of Toton. Both of those jurors indicated\n\n\n\nthey could put what they had heard out of mind while deliberating. Id. Petitioner proffers no\n\nevidence these statements were somehow untrue. The state court could have reasonably\n\ndetermined that none of the jurors selected were exposed to media coverage of Toton\u2019s\n\ndisciplinary matters. Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 61; claim 55, post. Moreover, the state court could\n\nreasonably find that questioning jurors about the publicity was likely to be more prejudicial than\n\nthat publicity itself. (SHCP Ex. 137, \u00b6 29.)\n\nPetitioner has not established that defense counsel\u2019s performance at the penalty phase fell\n\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness and that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors,\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 162 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n163\n\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different.

A trial court\u2019s failure\n\nto ask certain questions does not violate the Constitution unless it \u201crender[s] the defendant\u2019s trial\n\nfundamentally unfair.\u201d Mu\u2019Min, 500 U.S. at 426.\n\nPetitioner contends that, during voir dire, Razo admitted his exposure to a news article\n\nabout this case and stated that the murder of his cousin four years earlier would not affect his\n\ndeliberations (RT 1815, 1822), but after the trial, Razo stated to a defense investigator that his\n\ncousin\u2019s murder may have had some impact on him in Petitioner\u2019s case. (SPet. Exhs. 124, App.\n\nB, \u00b6 5; 124, \u00b6 13.)\n\nThe record before the state court shows that juror Razo stated during voir dire that he\n\nrecalled reading an article in the Bakersfield Californian that included Petitioner\u2019s picture and\n\nstated his involvement in a number of alleged criminal activities. (RT 1814-1816.) Razo stated\n\nthat the article and the murder of his cousin four years earlier would not affect his deliberations.\n\n(RT 1821-1822.) The evidence in the record suggests it unlikely that Razo\u2019s deliberation was\n\naffected by the article. (See claim 49, ante.) Nor are Razo\u2019s post-trial hearsay and unsigned\n\nstatements competent evidence that he was other than truthful during voir dire concerning his\n\ncousin\u2019s murder. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 802; Fed. R. Evid. 606(b); Cal. Evid.

For the reasons just discussed, the state court could reasonably have concluded that\n\nRazo\u2019s deliberations were unaffected by the article.\n\nAccordingly, it was not objectively unreasonable for the State Supreme Court to find\n\n\n\nthere was no reasonable probability juror Razo was other than an impartial juror. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n1746; Ortiz v.

Review of Claim 559\n\nIn this claim, Petitioner alleges court error by failure to voir dire the jury regarding\n\npublicity about defense counsel\u2019s pending disbarment.\n\nThe California Supreme Court considered this claim on appeal and found that the defense\n\nhad not objected on this ground or sought a curative admonition at trial and thus waived the issue\n\non appeal.

That court also found that there was \u201cno showing the jury\n\nwas unfair or biased\u201d, Sanchez, 12 Cal. 4th at 62, n.6, and that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s voir dire\n\nadequately insured an impartial jury, without unnecessarily exposing the jury to the very\n\ninformation defendant found could prejudice his case.\u201d Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 62.\n\n\u201c[T]he right to jury trial guarantees to the criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of\n\nimpartial, \u2018indifferent\u2019 jurors.\u201d Irvin, 366 U.S. at 722; see also Skilling, 561 U.S. at 377-78.\n\n\u201c[T]he trial court retains great latitude in deciding what questions should be asked on voir dire.\u201d\n\nMu\u2019Min, 500 U.S. at 424.

Petitioner does not raise such a basis for compelled inquiry in\n\nthis claim. Instead he claims that the voir dire questionnaire, the trial court, and defense counsel\n\nall failed to inquire whether prospective jurors had heard anything about the attorneys in this\n\ncase.\n\nThe Court is unpersuaded by this claim for reasons discussed in claim 49, ante. During\n\nvoir dire, the following eight jurors indicated they had never heard of the case, did not know\n\ncounsel, and did not subscribe to and did not usually read the Bakersfield Californian: juror\n\nJones (CT 258; RT 594, 596-597, 606); juror Mooney (CT 256, RT 647, 664); juror Roberts\n\n(CT 237, RT 1170); juror Stell (CT 184, RT 1882); juror G. Clark (CT 229, RT 2120); juror P.\n\nClark (CT 228; RT 2140-2141); juror O\u2019Toole (CT 220, RT 2401-2402, 2406); and juror\n\nRaymond (CT 217, RT 2438-2439). Two jurors, juror Crowder (CT 207; RT 1342-1343) and\n\njuror Zamora (CT 213; RT 2554, 2563) regularly read the Bakersfield Californian but were\n\nunaware of the case and did not know counsel.\n\nOnly two of the jurors selected, Razo and Rodriguez, stated they had heard of the case.\n\n(RT 1814-1815; 2458-2460, 2471-2472.) Neither mentioned having hearing of Toton; both\n\nindicated they did not believe everything they read in newspapers and could put what they had\n\nheard out of mind while deliberating. Id. Petitioner proffers no evidence these juror statements\n\nwere untrue. The state court could reasonably have found that prospective jurors were properly\n\nvoir dired regarding any pretrial publicity without exposing them to the allegedly prejudicial\n\ninformation.\n\nBased on the record, the state court could reasonably have found that specific voir dire\n\nregarding Toton\u2019s disbarment proceeding was unnecessary and could serve to education the\n\njurors on the potentially prejudicial information. See Mu\u2019Mun, 500 U.S. at 425-428 (1991) (trial\n\ncourt\u2019s failure to ask questions must \u201crender the defendant\u2019s trial fundamentally unfair\u201d and may\n\nbe overturned only for \u201cmanifest error.\u201d).\n\n\n\nNor has Petitioner pointed to evidence that demonstrates prejudice, i.e., that the error had\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 166 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n167\n\na \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d Brecht, 507\n\nU.S. at 638 (1991).

Autopsy photographs of scalp wounds to Mr. Bocanegra and Mrs. Bocanegra were\n\nproperly admitted as relevant to expert testimony and issues of aggravation and penalty and were\n\nnot unnecessarily gruesome.

The California Supreme Court\n\ncould reasonably have found the photographs relevant and probative of charges and elements\n\nincluding intent to kill, aggravation and penalty, such that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object did\n\nnot necessarily demonstrate ineffective assistance. See Nefstad, 66 F.3d 335, at *3 (holding no\n\nviolation of due process where prosecutor during closing argument shows photographs of victim\n\nbefore and after murder because relevant to intent).\n\nAdmission of the photographs did not render trial \u201cfundamentally unfair.\u201d Batchelor v.\n\n\n\nCupp, 693 F.2d 859, 865 (9th Cir. 1982) (admission of photographs lies largely within the\n\ndiscretion of the trial court, whose ruling will not be disturbed . . . unless the admission of the\n\nphotographs rendered the trial fundamentally unfair). Defense counsel Frank argued his\n\nlingering doubt theory, (RT 3048-3072), that Petitioner did not intend to kill or assist in killing\n\nMr. Tatman (id.,), and that Petitioner had no criminal intent when he went to the Bocanegra\n\nresidence (id.).\n\nAdditionally, even without the photographs, it is not reasonably probable the jury would\n\nhave returned a sentence less than death. The evidence in aggravation including the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the murders of the Bocanegras and Mr. Tatman, and Petitioner\u2019s 1982\n\nassaults on Ammarie and Pena, was not insubstantial.

Claim II) raised in\n\nPetitioner\u2019s state petition for habeas corpus. In re Sanchez, S049502 (DD).\n\nThe state supreme court also considered and rejected this claim on direct appeal. That\n\ncourt found that Petitioner failed to meet the state procedural requirement of timely objection and\n\nthus waived the issue on appeal and was procedurally barred on collateral review, noting that:\n\n[C]ounsel did not object to the court's incorrect reading of the multiple-murder\n\nspecial-circumstances verdict. Hence, if any error occurred, it was waived.\n\n[Citation] Moreover, even if counsel had objected, we would find any error the\n\ncourt made in reading incorrectly the multiple-murder special-circumstance\n\nfindings, or any confusion caused by the court's verdict as to the Tatman charges,\n\ncould have been rendered harmless by an admonition to the jury.\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 75.\n\nThe state supreme court went on to consider the trial court\u2019s verdict misstatement and\n\ndefense attorney Frank\u2019s argument to the jury clarifying and arguing the Tatman verdict, as\n\nfollows:\n\nPrior to penalty phase arguments, at defense counsel Frank's request, the trial\n\ncourt read the information and summarized the guilt verdict, including the special\n\ncircumstances findings, for the jury. In summarizing the verdict, the court\n\npurported to read from the August 3, 1988, minute order which . . . found true the\n\nmultiple-murder special circumstance with respect to the Bocanegra murders only\n\nand did not include the Tatman murder in the special-circumstance disposition.\n\nPurporting to read from the August 3 minute order, the court inexplicably\n\nincluded Tatman as part of the [special circumstance] finding when it summarized\n\n\n\nthe verdict to the jury. That finding is not in the record copy of the minute order.\n\nAlso during penalty phase argument, Frank explained to the jury the meaning of\n\nthe felony-murder charges in the Tatman verdict, and discussed defendant's role as\n\nan accomplice in the Tatman robbery and murder in an apparent attempt to clarify\n\nthe court's allegedly inconsistent verdicts finding defendant guilty of the first\n\ndegree murder and robbery of Tatman, but finding not true the robbery-murder\n\nspecial circumstance. Frank's explanation of the felony-murder verdict was\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 170 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n171\n\ninterrupted by Ryals's successful objection. Defendant now complains that the\n\ncourt's erroneous inclusion of the Tatman murder as part of the multiple-murder\n\nspecial-circumstance finding in the Bocanegra murders, and its failure to explain\n\n(or allow counsel to adequately explain) its allegedly inconsistent verdict and\n\n\n\nspecial-circumstance finding in the Tatman murder verdicts amounted to \u201cthe use\n\nof false or misleading evidence in capital sentencing\u201d in violation of defendant's\n\nFourteenth Amendment right to due process, and the Eighth Amendment right to a\n\nfair trial. [Citation]\n\nIn addition, Frank's penalty phase argument explained to the jury the meaning of\n\nthe Tatman verdict: \u201cThe significance of what [defendant] was and wasn't\n\nconvicted of, I would submit to you, establishes a lot of facts, number one, that he\n\nhimself did not kill Woodrow [Wilson] Tatman. You heard the evidence. I think\n\nyou can infer from the evidence, from the verdicts that it was not Ted Sanchez\n\nwho killed Mr. Tatman, it was Robert Reyes. I submit to you that you can\n\nlogically infer from what you've heard that Ted Sanchez did not kill Mr. Tatman\n\nnor did he share in Robert Reyes' intent to kill Mr. Tatman. Ted's role in that\n\ntragic incident was limited to removing some of Mr. Tatman's property. You\n\nheard the evidence. Mr. Tatman was not supposed to even have known that his\n\nproperty had been taken . . . .\u201d\n\n;\n\nFrank next repeated to the jury: \u201cRobert Reyes took it upon himself to kill, but\n\nTed had no part in that.\u201d Frank then explained the multiple-murder specialcircumstance\n\nfindings and argued the circumstances of the Bocanegra murders as\n\na mitigating factor. . . .\n\n\u201cNow let's turn to the charges involving the Bocanegras. Teddy was charged in\n\ncount two of the Information with having killed Mr. Bocanegra and in count three\n\nof the Information with having killed Mrs. Bocanegra. Each count carried with it\n\nthe special circumstance that the murder had been committed during the course of\n\na robbery. Although he was found guilty of the murders of Mr. and Mrs.\n\nBocanegra, the special circumstance that the murders occurred during the course\n\nof a robbery were not found true. In addition, he was found not guilty of robbing\n\nthe Bocanegras as was alleged in count five.\n\n\u201cI submit to you that the importance of all this is that you can infer that when Tedthat\n\nwhen Ted went over to the Bocanegra house he did not do so with the intent\n\nto rob him. In fact, I would submit that you can infer that when he went over to\n\nthat house he didn't intend to commit any criminal acts against the Bocanegras,\n\nand that it wasn't until after Joey and his father started fighting that Teddy thought\n\nabout engaging in any criminal activity.\n\n\u201cNow, I bring all this to your attention because the law says that you can take into\n\naccount the circumstances of the crimes when you deliberate on the issue of\n\npenalty . . . .\n\n\u201cNow this factor is general, looked upon as being an aggravating factor, one that\n\ndoesn't usually contain any mitigating value, but I submit to you that, in this case,\n\nif you look closely at the facts and circumstances of what transpired at the Tatman\n\nand Bocanegra residence[s], you will find significant mitigating values there.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrank thereafter told the jury that it was Reyes, not defendant, who killed Tatman,\n\nand that defendant \u201chad no criminal intent when he went over to [the Bocanegras']\n\nhouse.\u201d He also argued that these same facts could be interpreted as mitigating\n\nevidence . . .

The state court, upon considering the foregoing found the\n\nmisstatement to be alternatively procedurally barred and harmless:\n\nWe conclude any error the court made in the court's verdict statement was\n\nharmless. Defendant requested the court read the verdict and special circumstance\n\nfindings, and failed to correct the court or offer clarifying instructions in order to\n\n\n\nremedy any misperceptions the jury may have had about the verdict. Moreover,\n\ncounsel's explanation of the verdict to the jury during argument more than\n\nclarified any potential confusion the jury may have experienced following the\n\ncourt's explanation. The prosecutor did not mention the erroneous verdict, or\n\ncapitalize on its inclusion. Defendant was convicted of three counts of first degree\n\nmurder, including one supportable special-circumstance allegation, as well as two\n\ncounts of use of a deadly weapon, and one count of robbery. Under these\n\ncircumstances, there is no reasonable possibility that consideration of the court's\n\npotentially confusing reading of the guilt phase verdict could have improperly\n\ninfluenced the jury. [Citation]\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 76.\n\nPetitioner contends that the trial court misled the jury, telling them Petitioner was guilty\n\nof Mr. Tatman\u2019s first degree murder, and guilty of robbery of Mr. Tatman, but not guilty of the\n\nrobbery special circumstance under California Penal Code section 190.2(a)(17). In Petitioner\u2019s\n\nview, the jury was unaware the verdict implicitly found that Petitioner was not Mr. Tatman\u2019s\n\nactual killer and that Petitioner was found not to have intended the killing of Mr. Tatman.\n\nThe Court finds, however, that the state supreme could reasonably have determined that\n\nthe trial court reading of the guilt verdicts was adequately clarified by defense counsel\u2019s penalty\n\nphase argument. Defense attorney Frank pointed out to the jury where the evidentiary record\n\nsupported inference from the verdicts that Petitioner did not intend to kill Mr. Tatman and did\n\nnot kill him. Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 74-77. Frank\u2019s argument was sufficient to make harmless\n\nany error by the trial court in explaining the verdicts.\n\nPetitioner contends the trial court errantly explained the verdict regarding the \u201cmultiple\n\nmurder\u201d special circumstance, stating such was predicated on the murders of Mr. Tatman and\n\nMr. Bocanegra when in fact it was predicated on the murders of Mr. & Mrs. Bocanegra.\n\nPetitioner claims this misled the jury into believing the Tatman murder was a capital crime and\n\nas such was an aggravating factor.

Frank argued at penalty phase that,\n\nbased on the evidence, Petitioner had no criminal intent when he arrived at the Bocanegra home,\n\nand explained to the jury the meaning of the felony-murder charges in the Tatman verdict, and\n\ndiscussed defendant's role as an accomplice in the Tatman murder and robbery. Id.; RT 3052-\n\n3072. These defense arguments sufficiently clarified the trial court\u2019s allegedly inconsistent\n\nverdicts finding defendant guilty of the first degree murder and robbery of Mr. Tatman but\n\nfinding not true the robbery-murder special circumstance.\n\nPetitioner contends that the trial court improperly restricted Frank\u2019s closing argument\n\nregarding the Tatman conviction and felony murder rule, on grounds the rule was not part of the\n\nevidence. Petitioner maintains this was error in that the prosecution had argued to the jury that\n\nPetitioner killed Mr. Tatman, treating the first degree felony-murder conviction as a capital\n\ncrime. However, as Respondent correctly notes, the felony murder rule was not in evidence or\n\npart of the jury instructions. Defense counsel Frank was not restricted in arguing the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the Tatman murder and verdict. Petitioner was able to argue the\n\ninference that he did not intend to kill Mr. Tatman and did not kill him. Defense counsel Frank\u2019s\n\nclosing argument stated and clarified the specific charges levied and those upon which Petitioner\n\nwas convicted and argued for mitigation based on the facts and circumstances in the evidentiary\n\nrecord. (RT 3050-3072.)\n\nThe state record does not reasonably suggest the likelihood that the trial court verdict\n\n\n\nstatement improperly influenced the jury. Any error in the trial court\u2019s statement of the verdicts,\n\nthat the multiple murder circumstance was based on the murders of Mr. Tatman and Mr.\n\nBocanegra, was harmless because, based on Frank\u2019s penalty phase and closing arguments (RT\n\n3050-3072) and the instructions given (RT 2611-2616, 3082-3097; CT 979-1021), there is no\n\nreasonable probability the jury mistakenly believed Tatman was a capital crime.\n\nAccordingly, Petitioner has not established that defense counsel\u2019s performance at penalty\n\nphase fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that, but for counsel's\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 173 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n174\n\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.

Review of Claim 5810\n\nIn his next claim, which includes multiple subclaims, Petitioner alleges inadequate and\n\nunconstitutional jury instructions at the penalty phase. The subclaims are reviewed separately.\n\ni. Lingering Doubt\n\nPetitioner alleges that the trial court rejected his \u201clingering doubt\u201d instruction even\n\nthough California law mandates mitigating consideration of lingering doubt and defense counsel\n\nargued discrepancies in Hernandez\u2019s testimony created lingering doubt as to Petitioner\u2019s guilt.\n\nThe state supreme court reached and rejected this subclaim on direct appeal, finding that\n\nthe trial court did not err in rejecting Petitioner\u2019s specific instruction on lingering doubt:\n\nDefendant's proposed instruction asked the jury to \u201cconsider as a mitigating factor\n\nresidual or lingering doubt as to Mr. Sanchez's guilt for the crimes of which he has\n\nbeen convicted.\u201d Although defendant recognizes that the state and federal\n\nConstitutions do not require a residual doubt instruction, he asserts the instruction\n\nshould have been given in this case because it was warranted by the evidence. He\n\nrelies on section [California Penal Code \u00a7] 190.3, factor (f), which gives the judge\n\ndiscretion to instruct the jury \u201con any points of law pertinent to the issue,\u201d and\n\ncase law that holds section 190.3, factor (f) may require a court to give the\n\n\u201cresidual doubt\u201d instruction should the evidence warrant it. [Citation] Claiming\n\nthat the evidence was insufficient to find him guilty of the first degree murders of\n\nMr. and Mrs. Bocanegra, defendant contends \u201cresidual doubt\u201d was \u201ca\n\ncircumstance of the capital crimes that could be considered by the jury under both\n\n[section] 190.3, factors (a) and (k).\u201d\n\nWe find no error. It is true, as defendant claims, that the jury's consideration of\n\nresidual doubt is proper; defendant may assert his possible innocence to the jury\n\nas a factor in mitigation under section 190.3, factors (a) and (k). [Citation] But\n\n10 The legal basis of the Fifth Amendment, and the legal basis of the Sixth Amendment except with regard to the\n\nlingering doubt instruction was stricken as unexhausted.

These instructions on the scope of mitigating circumstances\n\nsufficiently encompassed the concept of residual doubt about defendant's guilt.\n\n[Citation]\n\nIn addition, as we have observed, defense counsel told the jury that the\n\ncircumstances of the crimes could be viewed as mitigating evidence of defendant's\n\nintent to kill. He also emphasized to the jury that section 190.3, factor (k) allows it\n\nto \u201cconsider any aspect of the defendant's character or record that he offers as a\n\nbasis for a sentence less than death,\u201d and asked the jury whether it had \u201csome\n\nlingering doubts about what [it] would have seen\u201d if it had been inside the\n\nBocanegra residence at the time of the murders. In light of the proper instructions\n\n\n\ngiven to the jury, and counsel's argument, we conclude the trial court did not err in\n\nrejecting defendant's specific instruction on lingering doubt. [Citation]\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 77-83.\n\n\u201c[T]he Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require that the sentencer, in all but the rarest\n\nkind of capital case, not be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a\n\ndefendant's character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant\n\nproffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u201d Lockett, 438 U.S. 586 at 604; Eddings v.\n\nOklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 113-114 (1982) (adopting rule in Lockett). \u201cThe standard against\n\nwhich we assess whether jury instructions satisfy the rule of Lockett and Eddings was set forth in\n\nBoyde, 494 U.S. 370 (1990).\u201d Johnson v. Texas, 509 U.S. 350, 367-68 (1993). In Boyde, the\n\nSupreme Court held that \u201cthere is no . . . constitutional requirement of unfettered sentencing\n\ndiscretion in the jury, and States are free to structure and shape consideration of mitigating\n\nevidence \u2018in an effort to achieve a more rational and equitable administration of the death\n\npenalty.\u2019\u201d Boyde, 494 U.S. at 377 (quoting Franklin, 487 U.S. at 181 (plurality opinion)).\n\nIn evaluating the instructions, the \u201creviewing court must determine \u2018whether there is a\n\nreasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents\n\nthe consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.\u2019\u201d Johnson, 509 U.S. at 367 (quoting\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 175 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n176\n\nBoyde, 494 U.S. at 380). \u201c[W]e do not engage in a technical parsing of this language of the\n\ninstructions, but instead approach the instructions in the same way that the jury would\u2014with a\n\n\u2018commonsense understanding of the instructions in the light of all that has taken place at the\n\ntrial.\u2019\u201d Id., at 368 (quoting Boyde, 494 U.S. at 381). Further, a single instruction \u201cmay not be\n\njudged in artificial isolation,\u201d but must be considered in light of the instructions as a whole and\n\nthe entire trial record.\u201d Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 72 (1991).\n\nThe failure to identify whether factors are aggravating or mitigating is plainly not\n\ncontrary to or an unreasonable application of Supreme Court authority. In Pulley v. Harris, the\n\nSupreme Court reviewed California\u2019s sentencing system, including the manner in which the jury\n\nconsidered relevant factors in deciding the penalty. Pulley, 465 U.S. at 51. The Supreme Court\n\nnoted that the 1977 law (like the 1978 law applicable in this case) did not identify or separate the\n\naggravating or mitigating factors. Id. at 53 n.14. The Court found California\u2019s death penalty law\n\nto be constitutional. Id. at 51 (\u201cAssuming that there could be a capital sentencing system so\n\nlacking in other checks on arbitrariness that it would not pass constitutional muster without\n\ncomparative proportionality review, the 1977 California statute is not of that sort.\u201d).\n\nIn Tuilaepa v. California, the Supreme Court again considered California\u2019s death penalty\n\nsentencing scheme. The Supreme Court rejected the argument that California\u2019s \u201csingle list of\n\nfactors\u201d was unconstitutional. The Court stated:\n\nThis argument, too, is foreclosed by our cases. A capital sentencer need not be\n\ninstructed how to weigh any particular fact in the capital sentencing decision. In\n\nCalifornia v. Ramos, for example, we upheld an instruction informing the jury\n\nthat the Governor had the power to commute life sentences and stated that \u201cthe\n\nfact that the jury is given no specific guidance on how the commutation factor is\n\nto figure into its determination presents no constitutional problem.\u201d 463 U.S., at\n\n1008\u20131009, n. 22, 103 S. Ct., at 3457\u20133458, n. 22. Likewise, in Proffitt v. Florida,\n\nwe upheld the Florida capital sentencing scheme even though \u201cthe various factors\n\nto be considered by the sentencing authorities [did] not have numerical weights\n\nassigned to them.\u201d 428 U.S., at 258, 96 S. Ct., at 2969. In Gregg, moreover, we\n\n\u201capproved Georgia's capital sentencing statute even though it clearly did not\n\nchannel the jury's discretion by enunciating specific standards to guide the jury's\n\nconsideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.\u201d Zant, 462 U.S., at\n\n875, 103 S. Ct., at 2742. We also rejected an objection \u201cto the wide scope of\n\nevidence and argument\u201d allowed at sentencing hearings. 428 U.S., at 203\u2013204, 96\n\n\n\nS. Ct., at 2939. In sum, \u201cdiscretion to evaluate and weigh the circumstances\n\nrelevant to the particular defendant and the crime he committed\u201d is not\n\nimpermissible in the capital sentencing process. McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S.\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 176 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n177\n\n279, 315, n. 37, 107 S.

Ct., at 3457. Indeed, the sentencer may be given\n\n\u201cunbridled discretion in determining whether the death penalty should be imposed\n\nafter it has found that the defendant is a member of the class made eligible for that\n\npenalty.\u201d Zant, supra, 4[62] U.S., at 875, 103 S. Ct., at 2742; see also Barclay v.\n\nFlorida, 463 U.S. 939, 948\u2013951, 103 S. Ct. 3418, 3424\u20133425, 77 L.Ed.2d 1134\n\n\n\n(1983) (plurality opinion). In contravention of those cases, petitioners' argument\n\nwould force the States to adopt a kind of mandatory sentencing scheme requiring\n\na jury to sentence a defendant to death if it found, for example, a certain kind or\n\nnumber of facts, or found more statutory aggravating factors than statutory\n\nmitigating factors. The States are not required to conduct the capital sentencing\n\nprocess in that fashion. See Gregg, supra, 428 U.S., at 199\u2013200, n. 50, 96 S. Ct.,\n\nat 2937\u20132938, n. 50.\n\nTuilaepa, 512 U.S. at 975. The Court finds that, based on the state record, the jury was\n\nadequately instructed that it could consider the circumstances of the convictions in the present\n\nproceeding including any special circumstance found to be true and any other mitigating\n\ncircumstances under \u00a7 190.3, factor (k), encompassing the concept of residual or lingering doubt\n\nabout Petitioner\u2019s guilt.\n\nThere is no persuasive argument that the instruction given in this case in any way\n\nforeclosed the jury from considering any relevant mitigating evidence. As noted by Respondent,\n\nthe Supreme Court has examined the language in California\u2019s jury instruction on mitigation\n\nmultiple times, and upheld it against constitutional challenges every time. See Ayers v.\n\nBelmontes, 549 U.S. 7 (2006); Brown v. Payton, 544 U.S. 133, 141, 142 (2005); Boyde, 494\n\nU.S. 370. Thus, the state court rejection of the claim was reasonable. Even if constitutional trial\n\nerror did occur, Petitioner is not entitled to relief because any such error did not have a\n\n\u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d Brecht, 507 U.S.\n\nat 638.\n\nThe trial court\u2019s use of the standard penalty phase instruction, California Criminal Jury\n\nInstruction, (CALJIC), No. 8.84.1 (1986 rev.), regarding California Penal Code \u00a7 190.3 factor\n\n(k), is adequate to permit jurors to consider relevant mitigating evidence. Boyde, 494 U.S. 370\n\nat 381-382; Lockett, 438 U.S. at 604. The Eighth Amendment does not require that a jury be\n\ninstructed on particular statutory mitigating factors. Buchanan v.

Strickland, 466\n\nU.S., at 687-694.\n\nRespondent contends this subclaim is not cognizable because it creates and retroactively\n\napplies a \u201cnew rule\u201d of constitutional law within Teague v.

However, the\n\nCourt finds the claim fails not because Petitioner seeks to apply a new rule of criminal procedure\n\nunder Teague, but rather on grounds the claim lacks merit for the reasons stated.\n\nThe Court finds the state court rejection of the subclaim was not contrary to, or an\n\nunreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, or an unreasonable determination of\n\nthe facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding, viewed most favoring\n\nthe prosecution. Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nThis subclaim is denied.\n\nii. California Penal Code \u00a7 190.3 Sentencing Factors\n\nPetitioner next alleges that the trial court\u2019s use of CALJIC No. 8.84.1 (1986 rev.), which\n\nincludes (Cal. Pen. Code \u00a7 190.3) sentencing factors \u201ca\u201d (consideration of current offense), \u201cb\u201d\n\n(consideration of violent criminal activity), and \u201cc\u201d (consideration of prior felony conviction),\n\nerroneously allowed the jury to inflate the aggravating weight of Petitioner\u2019s guilt phase crimes.\n\nPetitioner contends the jury improperly applied sentencing factors regarding presence of \u201cviolent\n\ncriminal activity\u201d and \u201cprior felony convictions\u201d to the charged offenses and to Petitioner\u2019s 1982\n\nassaults on store owner Hassan Ammarie and friend Arturo Pena.\n\nThe state supreme court reviewed this subclaim on direct appeal and rejected it, providing\n\nthat:\n\n\n\n[California Penal Code] Section 190.3 requires the jury to consider the\n\ncircumstances of the offense (\u00a7 190.3, factor (a)), the presence of violent criminal\n\nactivity, (id., factor (b)), and prior felony convictions (id., factor (c)). The jury\n\nwas instructed in the statutory language. [Citation] Defendant now claims the\n\ncourt erred by failing to clarify the differences between the above factors, thus\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 178 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n179\n\nallowing the jury to give multiple consideration to the aggravating evidence under\n\nall these factors. He also asserts that the instructions erroneously permitted the\n\njury to consider defendant's prior assaults under both factors (b) and (c), and\n\nimproperly inflated the weight the jury should have given to either prior crime.\n\nWe have noted that section 190.3, factor (b), concerns crimes other than those for\n\nwhich defendant is being prosecuted [Citation], and we have directed that courts\n\n\n\nshould give clarifying instructions \u201cto avoid any confusion\u201d that may be caused\n\nby the above factors. [Citation.] But we have consistently found that the absence\n\nof clarifying instructions is harmless [Citation], and that the standard instructions\n\ndo not \u201cinherently encourage 'double-counting' under section 190.3.\u201d [Citation]\n\nTherefore, \u201ceven if one or more jurors mistakenly consider a particular criminal\n\nincident under the wrong factor, there is little risk that a reasonable jury will give\n\na single incident duplicative consideration.\u201d [Citation] Moreover, both the\n\nprosecutor and defense counsel separately explained the proper use of the\n\nevidence under the separate factors. Thus, any potential confusion the jury may\n\nhave faced in light of the instructions was adequately addressed by both counsel's\n\narguments. Accordingly, given the arguments and the absence of any improperly\n\nadmitted evidence, we find that the court's failure to clarify the scope of each\n\nfactor did not affect the outcome of the trial.\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 79.\n\nThe legal standard for review of penalty phase instructions is also set forth in the\n\nsubclaim above, to wit, \u201cwhether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the\n\nchallenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant\n\nevidence.\u201d Boyde, 494 U.S. at 380.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s allegations lack merit. It is plainly not contrary to Supreme Court precedent\n\nto instruct the jury with all sentencing factors. The Supreme Court stated in Gregg v. Georgia:\n\nThe petitioner objects, finally, to the wide scope of evidence and argument\n\nallowed at [penalty] hearings. We think that the Georgia court wisely has chosen\n\nnot to impose unnecessary restrictions on the evidence that can be offered at such\n\na hearing and to approve open and far-ranging argument. So long as the evidence\n\nintroduced and the arguments made at the [penalty] hearing do not prejudice a\n\ndefendant, it is preferable not to impose restrictions. We think it desirable for the\n\njury to have as much information before it as possible when it makes the\n\nsentencing decision.\n\nGregg, 428 U.S. at 203-204 (citations omitted).\n\nThe Court finds there is no reasonable likelihood the jury misinterpreted the instruction\n\nby inflating aggravation from the guilt phase crimes. It is well established that a sentencing\n\ncourt need not identify which factors are aggravating and which are mitigating. Pulley, 465 U.S.\n\nat 51 and 53 n.14; Tuilaepa, 512 U.S. at 979-80.\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 179 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n180\n\nThe state court could reasonably have found that the prosecution guilt phase argument\n\nwas relevant only under the first sentencing factor. In fact, defense counsel Frank argued as\n\nmuch to the jury, that the guilt phase crimes should be considered only with regard to the first\n\nsentencing factor, (RT 3066-3067), ameliorating any juror confusion as to the current offense\n\nfactor \u201ca\u201d.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit has found the second factor, which refers to crimes for which the\n\ndefendant has not been convicted, not to be unconstitutionally vague, Bonin v. Calderon, 59 F.3d\n\n815, 848 (9th Cir. 1995), and that the third factor on its face aggravates for prior felony\n\nconvictions precluding any reasonable probability the jury aggravated for the charged offenses.\n\nId. The penalty phase evidence was relevant only to the second and third factors. The jury then\n\ncould properly have considered the 1982 assaults under both the second and third factors, and\n\nthat the prosecution\u2019s argument in this regard was not improper. People v. Melton, 44 Cal.3d\n\n713, 764 (1988) (no constitutional obstacle to separate consideration of properly distinct aspects\n\nof the penalty determination, even when those aspects happen to coexist in a single incident).\n\nAdditionally, any error was harmless given the substantial weight of evidence in\n\naggravation.

Instructing Which Sentencing Factors were Aggravating/Mitigating\n\n\n\nPetitioner next alleges that the trial court improperly rejected defense instructions\n\naddressing which sentencing factors were aggravating and which were mitigating, (CT 1078-83),\n\nallowing the jury to improperly consider the absence of a mitigating factor as itself an\n\naggravating factor.\n\nThe state supreme court considered and rejected this subclaim on direct appeal:\n\nDefendant claims the prosecutor improperly implied that the absence of mitigating\n\nevidence under [California Penal Code] section 190.3, factors (e) and (f) should\n\nbe considered as aggravating evidence. [Citation] We find no error. The\n\nprosecutor simply told the jury that there \u201cwas no evidence\u201d of factor (e), and also\n\nargued that she could not recall hearing any factor (f) evidence, but that if the jury\n\nheard it the evidence could be considered in mitigation. Moreover, the jury was\n\nspecifically instructed, pursuant to defendant's request, that the \u201cabsence of any\n\nparticular factor in mitigation is not to be treated as any factor in aggravation.\u201d It\n\nis presumed that the jury followed the court's instruction. [Citation]\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 77-83.\n\nThe legal standard for review of penalty phase instructions is also set forth in the\n\nsubclaim above, to wit, \u201cwhether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the\n\nchallenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant\n\nevidence.\u201d Boyde, 494 U.S. at 380.\n\nThe Court finds it clearly established that a sentencing court need not identify which\n\nfactors are aggravating and which are mitigating. Pulley, 465 U.S. at 51 and 53 n.14; Tuilaepa,\n\n512 U.S. at 979-80. The failure to identify whether factors are aggravating or mitigating is not\n\ncontrary to or an unreasonable application of Supreme Court authority. Pulley, 465 U.S. at 53\n\nn.14; Tuilaepa, 512 U.S. at 975-80. This is fatal to Petitioner\u2019s subclaim, since he cannot show\n\nthat the state court rejection of his claim was contrary to or an unreasonable application of\n\nSupreme Court precedent.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit arrived at the same conclusion in Williams v.

Deleting Inapplicable Mitigating Factors\n\nPetitioner alleges in this subclaim that the trial court erred in rejecting instructions\n\ndeleting mitigating factors (Cal. Pen. Code \u00a7 190.3 (e) and (f)) which were not claimed by\n\nPetitioner and thus not relevant this case, i.e., factors that \u201cvictims participated in, or consented\n\nto their own deaths\u201d or that Petitioner\u2019s actions were \u201cmorally justified.\u201d (CT 1078-1079.)\n\nPetitioner alleges that the prosecution argued the absence of evidence supporting these claims\n\nand thereby implied an illusory aggravating factor.\n\nThe state supreme court considered this claim on direct appeal and rejected it, noting that:\n\n\n\nDefendant contends the court erred when it rejected his request to delete\n\ninapplicable mitigating factors (e) (whether victim participated in crime) and (f)\n\n(moral justification for crime) of [California Penal Code] section 190.3 from its\n\nstandard statutory instructions, and injected irrelevant considerations into the\n\njury's penalty deliberations, depriving him of his right to a fair and reliable penalty\n\ndetermination under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nThe jury, however, was properly instructed to consider all the factors \u201cif\n\napplicable\u201d and later told to \u201ctake into account and be guided by\u201d the applicable\n\nfactors. [Citation] As we have in previous cases, we assume the jury properly\n\nfollowed the instruction and concluded that mitigating factors not supported by\n\nevidence were simply not \u201capplicable.\u201d [Citation]\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 79.\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 182 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n183\n\n\n\nThe Court finds this subclaim to be unavailing. As noted in discussion of the subclaims\n\nabove, the jury was instructed with CALJIC No. 8.84.1. That instruction allowed the jury to\n\n\u201cconsider\u201d each factor \u201cif applicable\u201d, (CT 994-995; RT 3087-3089), precluding any reasonable\n\nprobability Petitioner\u2019s rights were violated by a failure to delete sentencing factors (Cal. Pen.\n\nCode \u00a7 190.3 (e) and (f)).\n\nThe legal standard for review of penalty phase instructions is \u201cwhether there is a\n\nreasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents\n\nthe consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.\u201d Boyde, 494 U.S. at 380. In this\n\ninstance, it was not contrary to Supreme Court precedent to instruct the jury with all sentencing\n\nfactors where the instructions expressly indicated that the jury was to consider each factor only if\n\napplicable. The Supreme Court stated in Gregg v. Georgia:\n\nThe petitioner objects, finally, to the wide scope of evidence and argument\n\nallowed at [penalty] hearings. We think that the Georgia court wisely has chosen\n\nnot to impose unnecessary restrictions on the evidence that can be offered at such\n\na hearing and to approve open and far-ranging argument. So long as the evidence\n\nintroduced and the arguments made at the [penalty] hearing do not prejudice a\n\ndefendant, it is preferable not to impose restrictions. We think it desirable for the\n\njury to have as much information before it as possible when it makes the\n\nsentencing decision.\n\nGregg, 428 U.S. at 203-04. In Williams v. Calderon, the Ninth Circuit stated:\n\nWilliams argues that it was error to read to the jury the entire list of factors the\n\nstate considered relevant to the sentencing decision, even when some did not\n\napply. To the contrary, the jury instructions expressly indicated that the jury was\n\nto consider each factor only \u201cif applicable.\u201d Moreover, \u201c[i]t seems clear ... that the\n\nproblem [of jury inexperience] will be alleviated if the jury is given guidance\n\nregarding the factors about the crime and the defendant that the State,\n\nrepresenting organized society, deems particularly relevant to the sentencing\n\ndecision.\u201d Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 192, 96 S. Ct. 2909, 2934, 49 L.Ed.2d\n\n859 (1976) (plurality opinion). The reading of the complete list gave the jury\n\nmore guidance, not less. We find nothing in the Constitution prohibiting the very\n\npractice Gregg encouraged.\n\nWilliams, 52 F.3d 1465 at 1481.\n\nConsistent with the foregoing, this Court finds that the state court could reasonably have\n\nfound it unlikely that the jury applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevented\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 183 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n184\n\nconsideration of constitutionally relevant evidence. There was no requirement that a trial court\n\nredact the instructions to include only those factors deemed applicable. Moreover, the\n\ninstruction itself advises the jury to consider the factors \u201cif applicable.\u201d In Bonin v. Calderon,\n\nthe Ninth Circuit again rejected the argument posited by Petitioner. Bonin, 59 F.3d at 847-48.\n\nThe Bonin court noted that \u201cthe cautionary words \u2018if applicable\u2019 warned the jury that not all of\n\nthe factors would be relevant and that the absence of a factor made it inapplicable rather than an\n\naggravating factor.\u201d Id.\n\nRespondent contends this subclaim is not cognizable because it creates and retroactively\n\napplies a \u201cnew rule\u201d of constitutional law within Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288. However, the\n\nCourt finds the claim fails not because Petitioner seeks to apply a new rule of criminal procedure\n\nunder Teague, but rather on grounds the claim lacks merit for the reasons stated.\n\nThe Court finds that that the state court rejection of the subclaim was not contrary to, or\n\nan unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, or an or an unreasonable\n\ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding, viewed\n\n\n\nmost favoring the prosecution. Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nThis subclaim is denied.\n\nv. Limiting Aggravation\n\nPetitioner next alleges that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury it could not\n\nconsider aggravating factors not included in the instructions. He claims this potentially allowed\n\nunrestricted aggravation. (RT 3087-3089, 3095.)\n\nThe state supreme court considered and rejected this subclaim on direct appeal, finding\n\nthat there was no violation of state law:\n\nDefendant also asserts the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury not to\n\nconsider non-statutory aggravating evidence in determining penalty. We have\n\nrepeatedly rejected this contention, and defendant has not persuaded us to\n\nreconsider our conclusion. [Citation] Nor was the trial court required to label\n\nvarious factors as exclusively aggravating or mitigating.

At bottom, \u201cwhat is\n\nimportant at the selection stage is an individualized determination on the basis of the character of\n\nthe individual and the circumstances of the crime.\u201d Zant, 462 U.S. at 879. There is no\n\nconstitutional prohibition against non-statutory aggravating factors. Harris v. Pulley, 692 F.2d\n\n1189, 1193-94 (1982), overruled on other grounds, 465 U.S. 37 (1984); Zant, 462 U.S. at 878-79.\n\nAs noted, California\u2019s death penalty scheme allows for a sufficiently individualized sentence\n\ndetermination. Tuilaepa, 512 U.S. at 975. The trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that it\n\ncould not consider non-statutory aggravating factors is plainly not contrary to or an unreasonable\n\napplication of Supreme Court authority. Pulley, 465 U.S. at 51, 53 n.14; Tuilaepa, 512 U.S. at\n\n975-80.\n\nThe California Supreme Court found the specific instructions given allowed a fully\n\nindividualized evaluation of aggravating and mitigating evidence. Sanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 79-80,\n\nciting People v. Hawthorne, 4 Cal.4th 43 at 74-74. Petitioner\u2019s citation to People v. Boyd, 38\n\nCal.3d 762 (1985) is not authority otherwise. Nor is it \u201cthe province of a federal habeas court to\n\nre-examine state court determinations on state law questions.\u201d Estelle, 502 U.S. at 67-68.\n\nFurthermore, as the Supreme Court stated in Gregg v. Georgia:\n\nThe petitioner objects, finally, to the wide scope of evidence and argument\n\nallowed at [penalty] hearings. We think that the Georgia court wisely has chosen\n\nnot to impose unnecessary restrictions on the evidence that can be offered at such\n\na hearing and to approve open and far-ranging argument.

Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319; see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nThis subclaim is denied.\n\nvi. Limiting Modifiers\n\nPetitioner alleges that the trial court erred in denying his requested special instruction that\n\nsought to delete the adjective \u201cextreme\u201d from the reference in [mitigation factor] (d) to being\n\nunder the influence of mental or emotional disturbance, and the adjective \u201csubstantial\u201d from the\n\nreference in [mitigation factor] (g) to being under the domination of another person. He claims\n\nthis prevented presentation of his mitigation evidence. (CT 1078-1079.)\n\n\n\nThe state supreme court considered and rejected this claim on direct appeal, finding that:\n\nDefendant contends the trial court violated the Eighth Amendment by refusing his\n\nrequested deletion of the adjectives \u201cextreme\u201d and \u201csubstantial\u201d in instructions\n\ngiven in the language of section 190.3, factors (d) (whether defendant was under\n\nthe influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance at time of offense), and\n\n(g) (whether defendant acted under extreme duress or substantial domination of\n\nanother person). We have rejected this argument in numerous cases, and\n\ndefendant has failed to persuade us that we should reconsider these decisions.\n\n(See Turner, supra, 8 Cal.4th at pp. 208-209, and cases cited [catchall provision of\n\nsection 190.3, factor (k) referring to \u201cany other circumstance which extenuates the\n\ngravity of the crime\u201d allows consideration of non-extreme mental or emotional\n\nconditions when read in conjunction with instructions on factors (d) and (g)].)\n\nSanchez 12 Cal. 4th at 80.\n\nThe jury, however, was properly instructed to consider all the factors \u201cif\n\napplicable\u201d and later told to \u201ctake into account and be guided by\u201d the applicable\n\nfactors. [Citation] As we have in previous cases, we assume the jury properly\n\nfollowed the instruction and concluded that mitigating factors not supported by\n\nevidence were simply not \u201capplicable.\u201d [Citation]\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 186 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n187\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 79.\n\nThe Constitution requires that the jury must \u201cnot be precluded from considering, as a\n\nmitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant's character or record and any of the circumstances of\n\nthe offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u201d Lockett, 438\n\nU.S. at 604. The test is \u201cwhether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the\n\nchallenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant\n\nevidence.\u201d Boyde, 494 U.S. at 380. Further, a single instruction \u201cmay not be judged in artificial\n\nisolation,\u201d but must be considered in light of the instructions as a whole and the entire trial\n\nrecord. Estelle, 502 U.S. at 72.\n\nHere, the Court finds that the trial court\u2019s use of CALJIC No. 8.84.1 (1986 rev.),\n\nregarding California Penal Code \u00a7 190.3 factor (k), was adequate to permit jurors to consider\n\nrelevant mitigating evidence. Boyde, 494 U.S. at 381-82 (1990). The state supreme court\n\nrejected this subclaim, finding sufficient the trial court\u2019s instruction that (Cal. Pen. Code \u00a7\n\n190.3(k)) includes:\n\n[A]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime, even though\n\nit is not a legal excuse for the crime, and any sympathetic or other aspect of the\n\ndefendant\u2019s character or record that the defendant offers as a basis for a sentence\n\nless than death, whether or not related to the offense for which he is on trial.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit has rejected Petitioner\u2019s argument where, as here, the jury was advised\n\nit could consider any other mitigating matter. See Hendricks v. Vasquez, 974 F.2d 1099, 1109\n\n(9th Cir. 1992). Moreover, as noted by the California Supreme Court, factors (d) and (g) cannot\n\nbe read in isolation. It is clear that factor (k) on its face allows the jury to consider non-extreme\n\nand non-substantial mental or emotional conditions when read in conjunction with instructions\n\non factors (d) and (g). See Sanchez, 12 Cal. 4th at 80.\n\nThe Supreme Court has stated that factor (k) directed the jury to consider \u201cany other\n\ncircumstance that might excuse the crime. . . .\u201d Boyde, 494 U.S. at 382. Nothing suggests the\n\ninstruction in issue here precluded the jury from considering the mitigating evidence proffered\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 187 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n188\n\nby Petitioner.

It has\n\nrejected claims that the instruction restricts the jury\u2019s consideration of mitigating evidence in\n\nevery instance. See, e.g., Ayers, 549 U.S. at 7; Brown, 544 U.S. at 133; Boyde, 494 U.S. 370.\n\nRespondent contends this subclaim is not cognizable because it creates and retroactively\n\napplies a \u201cnew rule\u201d of constitutional law within Teague v.

However, the\n\nCourt finds the claim fails not because Petitioner seeks to apply a new rule of criminal procedure\n\nunder Teague, but rather on grounds the claim lacks merit for the reasons stated.\n\nThe Court finds that the state court rejection of the subclaim was not contrary to, or an\n\nunreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, or an unreasonable determination of\n\nthe facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding, viewed most favoring\n\nthe prosecution. Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nThis subclaim is denied.\n\nvii. \u201cPinpoint\u201d Mitigation Instructions\n\n\n\nIn this subclaim, Petitioner alleges that the trial court erred in denying his requested\n\nspecial \u201cpinpoint\u201d instructions relating to the defense theory of mitigating childhood and family\n\nfacts and circumstances. He argues that without the pinpoint instruction there is a reasonable\n\nlikelihood the jury did not understand the defense and could consider all factors in the\n\ninstructions as mitigation.\n\nThe state supreme court considered and rejected this subclaim on direct appeal, stating\n\nthat:\n\nDefendant complains that the court erred in rejecting his instructions discussing\n\nhis childhood and background, that were required to augment the section 190.3,\n\nfactor (k) instruction. We disagree. The jury was fully aware that it could consider\n\ndefendant's childhood in mitigation under factor (k); it was further instructed that\n\nthis factor allowed the jury to consider \u201cany sympathetic or other aspect of the\n\ndefendant's character or record that the defendant offers as a basis for a sentence\n\nless than death.\u201d In addition, the jury was instructed that it was \u201cfree to assign\n\nwhatever moral or sympathetic value you deem appropriate to each and all of the\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 188 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n189\n\nvarious factors\u201d and that [t]o return a judgment of death, each of you must be\n\npersuaded that the aggravating evidence and/or circumstances is so substantial in\n\ncomparison with the mitigating circumstances that it warrants death instead of life\n\nwithout parole.\u201d These instructions, combined with the arguments of Ryals\n\n(informing the jury it could consider as mitigating defendant's background and\n\ncharacter) and Frank (telling jury that factor (k) includes any evidence of\n\ndefendant's character or background that he offers), lead us to conclude that there\n\nis no possibility the jury misunderstood its sentencing obligation to consider\n\ndefendant's background and character in determining the appropriate penalty.\n\n[Citation]\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 82.\n\nAs recited above, in reviewing penalty phase instructions, the test is \u201cwhether there is a\n\nreasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents\n\nthe consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.\u201d Boyde, 494 U.S. at 380. Further, a\n\nsingle instruction \u201cmay not be judged in artificial isolation,\u201d but must be considered in light of\n\nthe instructions as a whole and the entire trial record. Estelle, 502 U.S. at 72.\n\nHere, the state court could reasonably have found that the jury was not precluded from\n\nconsidering mitigating evidence including childhood and family evidence. The trial court\n\nrejected Petitioner\u2019s proffered special instruction, using instead CALJIC No. 8.84.1 (1986 rev.),\n\nwhich advised the jury to consider the circumstances of the present conviction (pursuant to Cal.\n\nPen. Code \u00a7 190.3(a)) and any other extenuating circumstance and aspect of the defendant\u2019s\n\ncharacter or record (pursuant to Cal. Pen. Code \u00a7 190.3(k)). (CT 994-995; RT 3087-3089.)\n\nAdditionally, the prosecution argued to the jury that it was not precluded from considering\n\nmitigating evidence. (RT 3043-3044.) Defense counsel Frank did the same. (RT 3053-3060).\n\nAt the time Petitioner\u2019s conviction became final on October 7, 1996, it was established\n\nthat use of CALJIC No. 8.84.1 was adequate to permit jurors to consider relevant mitigating\n\nevidence. Boyde, 494 U.S. at 381-82 (1990). The Ninth Circuit has rejected Petitioner\u2019s\n\nargument where, as here, the jury was advised it could consider any other mitigating matter. See\n\nHendricks, 974 F.2d at 1109. The Supreme Court has never required a sentencing court to\n\ninstruct a jury on how to weigh and balance factors in aggravation and mitigation. As discussed\n\nin the subclaims above, in Tuilaepa v. California, the Supreme Court stated, \u201c[a] capital\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 189 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n190\n\nsentencer need not be instructed how to weigh any particular fact in the capital sentencing\n\ndecision.\u201d Tuilaepa, 512 U.S. at 979. Similarly, in Kansas v. Marsh, the Supreme Court stated:\n\nIn aggregate, our precedents confer upon defendants the right to present\n\nsentencers with information relevant to the sentencing decision and oblige\n\nsentencers to consider that information in determining the appropriate sentence.\n\nThe thrust of our mitigation jurisprudence ends here. \u201c[W]e have never held that\n\na specific method for balancing mitigating and aggravating factors in a capital\n\nsentencing proceeding is constitutionally required.\u201d\n\nMarsh, 548 U.S. at 175 (quoting Franklin, 487 U.S. at 179) (citing Zant, 462 U.S. at 875\u2013876,\n\nn.13). Petitioner has not made any sufficient evidentiary showing otherwise.\n\nRespondent contends this subclaim is not cognizable because it creates and retroactively\n\napplies a \u201cnew rule\u201d of constitutional law within Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288. However, the\n\nCourt finds the claim fails not because Petitioner seeks to apply a new rule of criminal procedure\n\nunder Teague, but rather on grounds the claim lacks merit for the reasons stated.\n\nFor the reasons stated, the Court is persuaded the state court rejection of the subclaim\n\n\n\nwas not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, or an or\n\nan unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court\n\nproceeding, viewed most favoring the prosecution.

Aggravation \u201cBeyond a Reasonable Doubt\u201d Instruction\n\nPetitioner alleges in the next subclaim that the trial court erred in denying his requested\n\nspecial instructions requiring the jury to find aggravation outweighed mitigation beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt and that a death sentence was appropriate beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial\n\ncourt instead gave the statutory instruction, CALJIC No. 8.84.2 (1986 rev.), renumbered CALJIC\n\nNo. 8.88 (1989 rev.).\n\nThe state supreme court considered and rejected this claim on appeal, stating that:\n\nDefendant contends the trial court violated the federal Constitution by rejecting\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 190 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n\n\n27\n\n28\n\n191\n\nhis instruction that would have required the jury unanimously to find the existence\n\nof an aggravating factor before considering it and to find beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors before\n\nchoosing the penalty of death. Instead, the court instructed the jury pursuant to\n\nformer CALJIC No. 8.84.2, which informed the jury it must \u201cbe guided by the\n\napplicable factors of aggravating and mitigating circumstances upon which [it]\n\nhad been instructed.\u201d The instruction also emphasized to the jury that the penalty\n\ndetermination did not involve a mere mechanical weighing process, but required\n\nan individual assessment of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances (and\n\nassignment of \u201cwhatever moral or sympathetic value\u201d it deemed appropriate) in\n\ndetermining the sentence. Defendant claims CALJIC No. 8.84.2 failed to inform\n\nthe jury it must find that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors\n\nand that, if it found mitigating factors outweighed aggravating factors, it must\n\nimpose a sentence of life without parole. We have previously rejected these\n\ncontentions, and defendant has failed to persuade us to reconsider our decisions.\n\n[Citation]\n\nAs we have previously recognized, nothing in the federal Constitution requires the\n\njury unanimously to find the existence of an aggravating factor, or to find beyond\n\na reasonable doubt that the People proved each aggravating factor, that the\n\naggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating ones, or that death is\n\nappropriate. [Citation] Unlike the determination of guilt, \u201cthe sentencing function\n\nis inherently moral and normative, not factual\u201d [Citation] and thus \u201cnot\n\nsusceptible to a burden-of-proof quantification.\u201d [Citation] . . . Former CALJIC\n\nNo. 8.84.2 adequately conveyed to the jury the seriousness of its obligation in\n\ndetermining the appropriate penalty, and we find no error in giving the\n\ninstruction.

Nor is there any Supreme Court authority which would require a burden of proof or\n\npersuasion be assigned to any of the jury\u2019s penalty phase determinations. On the contrary, the\n\nSupreme Court has held that no \u201cspecific method for balancing mitigating and aggravating\n\nfactors in a capital sentencing proceeding is constitutionally required.\u201d Marsh, 548 U.S. at 175.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s death penalty sentencing scheme has been consistently upheld as constitutional by\n\n\n\nthe Supreme Court. Tuilaepa, 512 U.S. at 975-80; Pulley, 465 U.S. at 53.\n\nThe Court finds the statutory instruction, CALJIC 8.84.2, did appropriately advise the\n\njury to consider the applicable factors of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and that to\n\nfind for death each juror must be persuaded that the aggravating evidence and/or circumstances\n\nis so substantial in comparison with the mitigating circumstances that it warrants death instead of\n\nlife without parole. (CT 1018; RT 3095-3096.) Due process requires no more. Harris, 692 F.2d\n\nat 1194. California is not required to adopt specific standards for instructing the jury on\n\nconsideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Zant, 462 U.S. at 890.\n\nThe state court then could reasonably find the requirement under California\u2019s death\n\npenalty statute, that the jury weigh aggravating and mitigating factors before imposing the death\n\npenalty, adequately guarantees the jury\u2019s discretion will be guided and its considerations\n\ndeliberate.\n\nRespondent contends this subclaim is not cognizable because it creates and retroactively\n\napplies a \u201cnew rule\u201d of constitutional law within Teague v.

Written Aggravation Findings\n\nPetitioner alleges in his next subclaim that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury\n\nto make written findings as to aggravating and mitigating factors, denying him due process and\n\nmeaningful appellate review under the Eighth Amendment.\n\nThe state supreme court reviewed and rejected this claim on direct appeal, noting that:\n\nDefendant contends the trial court erred by failing to require the jury to render\n\nwritten findings on the aggravating factors it selected. We have repeatedly held\n\nthat such findings are not required, and accordingly, find no error. [Citation]\n\nFederal law is in accord. See Harris, 692 F.2d at 1195, overruled on other grounds\n\n465 U.S. 37 (1984).\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 82.\n\nThe state court decision is not contrary to Supreme Court precedent. See Harris, 692\n\nF.2d at 1195\u201396. Moreover, the California procedure provides a sufficient record for appellate\n\nreview by requiring the judge to provide a written statement upholding or overturning the jury\u2019s\n\nverdict without requiring written findings by the jury on the aggravating circumstances. In\n\nProffitt v. Florida, the Supreme Court upheld the Florida death penalty statute which was\n\ncomparable to California\u2019s procedure. 428 U.S. 242, 250-251 (1976). In the Florida statute, the\n\njury is required to make a penalty recommendation to the trial judge, unaccompanied by any\n\nspecific findings, and thereafter the judge determines the actual sentence and specifies in writing\n\nthe reasons in support of the sentence. Id. at 249-250. In interpreting the Florida law, the\n\nSupreme Court emphasized, \u201cSince . . . the trial judge must justify the imposition of a death\n\nsentence with written findings, meaningful appellate review of each such sentence is made\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 193 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n194\n\npossible . . . .\u201d Id. at 251. In a similar way, the California procedure provides for meaningful\n\nappellate review with respect to the disclosure of the reasons supporting a sentence of death.\n\nThe California procedure was approved by the Supreme Court in Pulley v. Harris, where\n\nit was stated:\n\nIf the jury finds the defendant guilty of first degree murder and finds at least one\n\nspecial circumstance, the trial proceeds to a second phase to determine the\n\nappropriate penalty. Additional evidence may be offered and the jury is given a\n\nlist of relevant factors. \u00a7 190.3. \u201cAfter having heard all the evidence, the trier of\n\nfact shall consider, take into account and be guided by the aggravating and\n\nmitigating circumstances referred to in this section, and shall determine whether\n\nthe penalty shall be death or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\u201d\n\nIbid. If the jury returns a verdict of death, the defendant is deemed to move to\n\nmodify the verdict. \u00a7 190.4(e). The trial judge then reviews the evidence and, in\n\nlight of the statutory factors, makes an \u201cindependent determination as to whether\n\nthe weight of the evidence supports the jury's findings and verdicts.\u201d Ibid. The\n\njudge is required to state on the record the reasons for his findings. Ibid. If the\n\n\n\ntrial judge denies the motion for modification, there is an automatic appeal. \u00a7\u00a7\n\n190.4(e), 1239(b). The statute does not require comparative proportionality\n\nreview or otherwise describe the nature of the appeal. [Footnote omitted.] It does\n\nstate that the trial judge's refusal to modify the sentence \u201cshall be reviewed.\u201d \u00a7\n\n190.4(e). This would seem to include review of the evidence relied on by the\n\njudge. As the California Supreme Court has said, \u201cthe statutory requirements that\n\nthe jury specify the special circumstances which permit imposition of the death\n\npenalty, and that the trial judge specify his reasons for denying modification of\n\nthe death penalty, serve to assure thoughtful and effective appellate review,\n\nfocusing upon the circumstances present in each particular case.\u201d People v.\n\nFrierson, 25 Cal.3d 142, 179, 158 Cal. Rptr. 281, 302, 599 P.2d 587, 609 (1979).\n\n. . .\n\nThe jury's \u201cdiscretion is suitably directed and limited so as to minimize the risk of\n\nwholly arbitrary and capricious action.\u201d Gregg, 428 U.S., at 189, 96 S. Ct., at\n\n2932. Its decision is reviewed by the trial judge and the State Supreme Court. On\n\nits face, this system, without any requirement or practice of comparative\n\nproportionality review, cannot be successfully challenged under Furman and our\n\nsubsequent cases.\n\nPulley, 465 U.S. at 51-53 (emphasis added).\n\nRespondent contends this subclaim is not cognizable because it creates and retroactively\n\napplies a \u201cnew rule\u201d of constitutional law within Teague v.

However, the\n\nCourt finds the claim fails not because Petitioner seeks to apply a new rule of criminal procedure\n\nunder Teague, but rather on grounds the claim lacks merit for the reasons stated.\n\nFor the reasons stated, the Court finds that the state court rejection of the subclaim was\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 194 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n195\n\nnot contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, or an or an\n\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court\n\nproceeding, viewed most favoring the prosecution.

Proportionality\n\nPetitioner next alleges that the California death penalty statute fails to require intra-case\n\nand inter-case proportionality and to provide for meaningful proportionality review, denying him\n\nprotection from arbitrary imposition of the death penalty and denying him equal protection with\n\nnon-capital felons and preventing the jury from considering all mitigation factors.\n\nThe state supreme court considered and rejected this subclaim on appeal, finding that:\n\nDefendant complains that the lack of intra-case and inter-case proportionality\n\nreview in this case renders the 1978 sentencing scheme under California's death\n\npenalty law arbitrary under the Eighth Amendment and in violation of his equal\n\nprotection rights because such review is afforded to noncapital defendants. We\n\nhave rejected the argument in numerous cases. [Citation]\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th 83.\n\nGenerally, errors of state law are not cognizable on federal habeas. Estelle, 502 U.S. at\n\n67. If a challenged instruction, viewed in the context of the overall charge, shows a denial of\n\ndue process which renders the trial unfair, habeas relief may lie. See Cupp, 414 U.S. at 147;\n\nHenderson v. Kibbe, 431 U.S. 145, 154 (1976).

Review of Claim 5911\n\nIn his next claim, Petitioner alleges that the trial court, during the (Cal. Pen. Code \u00a7\n\n190.4(e)) automatic motion to independently review the evidence, erred by failing to consider\n\nmitigating evidence when imposing death.\n\nThe state supreme court considered and rejected this claim on direct appeal, stating that:\n\nDefendant contends the trial court committed prejudicial error in denying his\n\nautomatic motion for modification of the death sentence (\u00a7 190.4, subd. (e))\n\nbecause it failed to consider mitigating evidence of defendant's dysfunctional\n\nfamily and his kindness to his siblings (\u00a7 190.3, factor (k)). We are not persuaded.\n\nAfter reviewing section 190.3, factors (a)-(i), and concluding that several statutory\n\nmitigating factors did not apply to defendant, (the court did note that defendant\n\nmay have been high on PCP during the murders pursuant to factor (h)), the court\n\nasked: \u201dAre there other circumstances that mitigate against the aggravation of the\n\n[defendant], I think not.\u201c Moreover, before denying the modification motion, the\n\ncourt stated that it had considered defendant's motion to reduce penalty and the\n\nPeople's response, both of which referred to defendant's mitigating evidence.\n\nThus, although the court did not specifically mention defendant's mitigating\n\nevidence of his family life, the court's statement regarding section 190.3, factor\n\n(k) evidence shows it considered all pertinent penalty phase evidence, including\n\ntestimony about defendant's family life and his behavior toward his siblings, but\n\nmerely found it unpersuasive. The record is clear that in ruling on the motion for\n\nmodification, the trial court independently assessed the weight of the evidence\n\nunder each factor, and stated its reasons for denying defendant's motion. [Citation]\n\nWe conclude on this record that all constitutional and statutory considerations\n\nwere observed in the court's ruling. [Citation]\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 83.\n\n\n\nAt the time Petitioner\u2019s conviction became final, Cal.

In\n\nruling on the application, the judge shall review the evidence, consider, take into\n\naccount, and be guided by the aggravating and mitigating circumstances referred\n\nto in Section 190.3, and shall make a determination as to whether the jury's\n\nfindings and verdicts that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating\n\ncircumstances are contrary to law or the evidence presented.

Pen. Code \u00a7 190.4(e)) automatic\n\nmotion to modify and independently review of the evidence, did not mention and thus ignored\n\nmuch 190.3(k) mitigating evidence of his abysmal childhood, adolescence in an alcoholic,\n\nviolent and dysfunctional family and his love and loyalty toward siblings, when it imposed the\n\ndeath penalty following its independent review. (CT 1103; RT [10/ 27-31, 1988] at pp. 2-16.)\n\nHe claims the trial judge was not guided by aggravating and mitigating circumstances in\n\nupholding death and thus failed to comply with the mandate of California Penal Code \u00a7 190.4(e).\n\nThe death penalty is constitutional if it \u201cis imposed only after a determination that the\n\naggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances present in the particular crime\n\ncommitted by the particular defendant, or that there are no such mitigating circumstances.\u201d\n\nBlystone, 494 U.S. at 305.

RT [10/31/88] pp. 7-10; see Turner v. Calderon,\n\n281 F.3d 851, 871 (9th Cir. 2002). The California Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s review was proper under state law is binding on this Court. Wainwright v. Goode, 464\n\nU.S. 78, 84 (1983) (per curiam).\n\nThe Court finds this claim raises solely an issue of state law without any claimed\n\nconstitutional error, Estelle, 502 U.S. at 68, leaving the federal court unable to review it. As\n\nnoted, habeas relief does not lie for errors of state law.

See Turner, 281 F.3d at 871. The Supreme Court\n\nhas not held that such a review is required, and the high court has found California\u2019s review\n\nprocedure to be constitutional. Pulley, 465 U.S. at 51-53.\n\nRespondent contends this claim is not cognizable because it creates and retroactively\n\napplies a \u201cnew rule\u201d of constitutional law within Teague v.

However, the\n\nCourt finds the claim fails not because Petitioner seeks to apply a new rule of criminal procedure\n\nunder Teague, but rather on grounds the claim lacks merit for the reasons stated.\n\nFor the reasons stated, the Court finds that the state court rejection of the claim was not\n\ncontrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, or an unreasonable\n\ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding, viewed\n\nmost favoring the prosecution.

Review of Claim 60\n\nIn his penultimate claim, Petitioner alleges that the cumulative effect of constitutional\n\nerror during the penalty phase warrants habeas relief. He cites to and incorporates claims 36-59\n\nand argues cumulative error therefrom.\n\n\n\nThe state supreme court considered and rejected this claim on direct appeal, stating that:\n\nDefendant claims that in combination, the errors at the penalty phase caused\n\ncumulative prejudice warranting a reversal of penalty. After review of the record,\n\nwe disagree. Any prosecutorial misconduct that did occur did not significantly\n\ninfluence the fairness of defendant's trial or detrimentally affect the jury's\n\ndetermination of the appropriate penalty.

These claims are insubstantial when considered cumulatively. See Karterman, 60\n\nF.3d at 580; see also Rupe, 93 F.3d at 1445.\n\nRespondent contends this claim is not cognizable because it creates and retroactively\n\napplies a \u201cnew rule\u201d of constitutional law within Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288. However, the\n\nCourt finds the claim fails not because Petitioner seeks to apply a new rule of criminal procedure\n\nunder Teague, but rather on grounds the claim lacks merit for the reasons stated.\n\nAccordingly, the Court finds that a fair-minded jurist could have found that Petitioner\n\nfailed to establish that the state court rejection of the claim was contrary to, or an unreasonable\n\napplication of, clearly established federal law, or an or an unreasonable determination of the facts\n\nin light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding, viewed most favoring the\n\nprosecution. Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nClaim 60 is denied.\n\nt. Review of Claim 61\n\nIn his final claim, Petitioner alleges that his death sentence is grossly disproportionate\n\ngiven his actions, his merely vicarious culpability as an aider and abetter, and his severe\n\nneurological and psychiatric impairments, violating his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments.\n\nThe state supreme court considered and rejected this claim on direct appeal, stating that:\n\nDefendant contends his death sentence is disproportionate to his culpability under\n\nthe Eighth Amendment and article I, section 17 of the California Constitution,\n\nwhich preclude punishment that is disproportionate to a defendant's individual\n\nculpability. [Citation] Defendant complains that the constitutional proscription\n\nagainst a disproportionate penalty has been especially violated in this case because\n\nhis accomplices in the murders received either 25 years to life pursuant to a\n\nnegotiated plea (Robert Reyes), or had the charges dismissed on insufficient\n\nevidence grounds (Joey Bocanegra).\n\nDefendant relies on People v. Dillon (1983) 34 Cal.3d 441, 479, in which the\n\ncourt reduced a life sentence imposed on a 17-year-old with no prior convictions\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 200 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n201\n\nfor a noncapital first degree felony murder to a sentence for second degree\n\nmurder. But, as we have subsequently stated, Dillon does not mandate the type of\n\nintra-case proportionality review sought by defendant. See People v. Hill, 3\n\nCal.4th 959, 1013 (1992).\n\nAs the People observe, intra-case proportionality review is \u201can examination of\n\nwhether defendant's death sentence is proportionate to his individual culpability\n\nirrespective of the punishment imposed on others.\u201d People v. Adcox, 47 Cal.3d\n\n207, 274 (1987). \u201cThe Eighth Amendment to the federal Constitution does not\n\nrequire us to incorporate into our proportionality determination any comparison of\n\ndefendant's sentence with that of another culpable person, whether charged or\n\nuncharged.\u201d Hill, 3 Cal.4th at p. 1014; Pulley, 465 U.S. 37, 53 (1984) [upholding\n\nCalifornia's absence of comparative proportionality review].)\n\nAccordingly, we reject defendant's plea for \u201cintra-case proportionality.\u201d The\n\nevidence shows that he committed three brutal first degree murders of innocent\n\nand defenseless victims as an accomplice, only thirty-three days after he was\n\nreleased from state prison on parole from an eight-year prison term imposed for\n\ntwo violent assaults. In light of the evidence presented at trial, the penalty is\n\nproportionate to defendant's culpability. [Citation]\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 84-85.\n\n\n\nThe California Supreme Court also denied claim 61 (SHCP Claim XX) raised in\n\nPetitioner\u2019s state petition for habeas corpus. In re Sanchez, S049502 (DD).\n\nPetitioner purports to question the viability of Pulley. Yet he does not explain how and\n\nwhy the Pulley decision is infirm, or provide any authority showing that it is. Instead he argues\n\nsimply that Pulley should not be applied to him because his liability was only vicarious and he is\n\nactually innocent of the charged murders.\n\nThe claim is not persuasive. Petitioner does not provide any sufficient basis for\n\nquestioning the holding in Pulley or its application in his proceeding. Pulley was clearly\n\nestablished authority at the time Petitioner\u2019s conviction became final on October 7, 1996.\n\nPetitioner does not distinguish or limit application of Pulley based on facts of this case.\n\nPetitioner alleges his death sentence is disproportionate because the more culpable Reyes and\n\nJoey were not sentenced to death. However, this argument cannot succeed given that there is no\n\nfederal proportionality requirement. Pulley, 465 U.S. 37. The Supreme Court held that \u201c[o]n its\n\nface, [California\u2019s] system, without any requirement or practice of comparative proportionality\n\nreview, cannot be successfully challenged under Furman [v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972)] and\n\nour subsequent cases.\u201d Id. at 53. California\u2019s 1978 death penalty has been upheld as\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 201 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n202\n\nconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court. Ramos, 463 U.S. at 993-94. The federal\n\ncourt has rejected proportionality review, Pulley, 465 U.S. at 53, as has the California Supreme\n\nCourt. Cox, 53 Cal.3d at 692. Moreover, the state court could reasonably find Petitioner\u2019s death\n\nsentence is not disproportionate to his culpability given the facts and circumstances of the crimes\n\nand his involvement in the crimes. (See claims 1-4 and subclaim \u201cx\u201d of claim 58, ante.)\n\nPetitioner alleges that his death sentence is disproportionate given California\u2019s\n\nextraordinarily large death pool. The Eighth Amendment requires that a state capital sentencing\n\nsystem must: \u201c1) rationally narrow the class of death-eligible defendants; and 2) permit a jury to\n\nrender a reasoned, individualized sentencing determination based on a death-eligible defendant's\n\nrecord, personal characteristics, and the circumstances of his crime.\u201d Marsh, 548 U.S. at 173-74.\n\nAs noted in claim 58, subclaim \u201cx\u201d, it was established at the time Petitioner\u2019s conviction became\n\nfinal that California\u2019s system complied with these requirements. Pulley, 465 U.S. at 53-54.\n\nPetitioner has not shown that Pulley does not control this case.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s re-argument of actual innocence fails for the reasons discussed in claims 2\n\nand 4, ante.\n\nIn sum, the Court finds this claim is entirely foreclosed by Pulley. Therein, the Supreme\n\nCourt determined that the Eighth Amendment did not require a \u201cstate appellate court, before it\n\naffirms a death sentence, to compare the sentence in the case before it with the penalties imposed\n\nin similar cases if requested to do so by the prisoner.\u201d Pulley, 465 U.S. at 43-44. The California\n\nSupreme Court, applying state law, rejected Petitioner\u2019s intra-case proportionality argument,\n\nstating that:\n\nThe evidence shows that he committed three brutal first degree murders of\n\ninnocent and defenseless victims as an accomplice, only thirty-three days after he\n\nwas released from state prison on parole from an eight-year prison term imposed\n\nfor two violent assaults. In light of the evidence presented at trial, the penalty is\n\nproportionate to defendant's culpability.\n\nSanchez, 12 Cal.4th at 84-85. The Bocanegra murders in which Petitioner participated were\n\nviolent, progressed over a period of time, and were bloody.

Petitioner has not shown a reasonable probability that his sentence was\n\ngrossly disproportionate to the crimes, see Hamelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 959 (1991), so as\n\nto deny him a fair trial and a more favorable outcome.\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons discussed above, the Court finds that the state court rejection\n\nof the claim was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal\n\nlaw, or an or an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the\n\nstate court proceeding, viewed most favoring the prosecution. Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319; see 28\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nClaim 61 is denied.\n\nVII.\n\nMOTION FOR EVIDENTIARY HEARING\n\nOn March 18, 2003, Petitioner filed a motion seeking an evidentiary hearing on claims 2,\n\n\n\n4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37,\n\n38, 40, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, 54 and 60. (ECF No. 120.) Petitioner alleges in his\n\nmotion that the state supreme court denied him a full and fair evidentiary hearing to resolve the\n\nfollowing facts showing prejudice, facts that were not presented at trial because of ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct:\n\n1) Jailhouse informant Seeley\u2019s statements, disclosed to the defense prior to trial but not\n\npresented at trial by either side, that Reyes, the third person at the Bocanegra crime scene,\n\nconfessed to a more culpable role in Mr. Bocanegra\u2019s murder, that Petitioner played no part in\n\nkilling Mr. Bocanegra, and that Reyes admitted being the initial aggressor against Mrs.\n\nBocanegra.\n\n2) Inconsistencies between the physical evidence and jailhouse informant Hernandez\u2019s\n\ntestimony at trial where he wanted to trade information for favorable treatment, exaggerated the\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 203 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n204\n\n\n\namount of time he spoke to Petitioner about the crime, failed to admit he was arrested for being\n\nunder the influence of heroin, and failed to admit he had been a heroin addict for over five years.\n\n3) Principal perpetrator Joey Bocanegra\u2019s violent temper, substance abuse through the\n\nnight and early morning before killing his parents, history of requesting money for drugs from\n\nhis parents and becoming violent if they refused his request.\n\n4) Testimony by prosecution witnesses, the crime scene analyst and the forensic\n\npathologist, supporting Petitioner\u2019s defense that Reyes was Joey\u2019s main assistant in the\n\nBocanegra murders.\n\n5) Petitioner\u2019s severe organic brain damage, low IQ, and serious psychiatric disorders,\n\nknown to defense counsel before trial but not investigated and presented at trial.\n\n6) Defense counsel\u2019s unreasonable acquiescence in the prosecution\u2019s use of statements\n\nPetitioner made to Detectives Stratton and Boggs which should have been excluded under\n\nMiranda, and to reporter Trihey which should have been placed in context and shown they were\n\ninconsistent with an inference that he intended to kill.\n\nRespondent filed his opposition on July 18, 2003, arguing that an evidentiary hearing is\n\nnot warranted because the claims lack merit, there is no sufficient offer of proof, and the new\n\nevidence presented by Petitioner does not cast doubt on the California Supreme Court\u2019s finding\n\nthat Petitioner failed to set forth facts which constitute a constitutionally cognizable claim. (ECF\n\nNo. 137.) Petitioner filed a reply on September 19, 2003, re-arguing his position on the motion.\n\n(ECF No. 140.)\n\nSection 2254(d), as amended by the AEDPA, provides:\n\nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody\n\npursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted with respect to any\n\nclaim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the\n\nadjudication of the claim--\n\n(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable\n\napplication of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the\n\nSupreme Court of the United States; or\n\n(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination\n\nof the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 204 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n205\n\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nIn Cullen v. Pinholster, the Supreme Court held that \u201creview under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) is\n\nlimited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits,\u201d and\n\nthus \u201cevidence introduced in federal court has no bearing on \u00a7 2254(d)(1) review.\u201d Pinholster,\n\n131 S. Ct. at 1398, 1400. Although the central holding of Pinholster pertained to \u00a7 2254(d)(1),\n\nthe Supreme Court observed that \u201c\u00a7 2254(d)(2) includes the language \u2018in light of the evidence\n\npresented in the State court proceeding,\u2019\u201d providing \u201cadditional clarity\u201d that review under \u00a7\n\n2254(d)(2) is also limited to the record before the state court. Id. at 1400 n.7. Therefore, for\n\nclaims that were adjudicated on the merits in state court, Petitioner can only rely on the record\n\nthat was before the state court to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 2254(d). See Landrigan, 550 U.S.\n\nat 474.\n\nPetitioner seeks an evidentiary hearing on the forty-one claims set forth above. All of\n\nthose claims were adjudicated on the merits in the state court. See Richter, 562 U.S. at 99\n\n(\u201c[w]hen a federal claim has been presented to a state court and the state court has denied relief,\n\nit may be presumed that the state court adjudicated the claim on the merits in the absence of any\n\nindication or state-law procedural principles to the contrary). For the reasons stated above,\n\nPetitioner fails to demonstrate that any of the forty-one claims overcomes the limitation of \u00a7\n\n\n\n2254(d). Thus, Pinholster effectively bars a habeas court from any further factual development\n\non these claims. Id. at 1411 n.20.\n\nPetitioner further claims that he is entitled to a hearing under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2).\n\nPinholster suggests this is not so. \u201cSection 2254(e)(2) continues to have force where \u00a7\n\n2254(d)(1) does not bar federal habeas relief.\u201d Id. at 1401. Analysis of the claims under \u00a7\n\n2254(d) must precede the granting of an evidentiary hearing under \u00a7 2254(e)(2). Id. Thus, only\n\nif Petitioner overcomes \u00a7 2254(d) can the Court consider a hearing under \u00a7 2254(e)(2). As\n\nJustice Breyer stated: \u201cIf the federal habeas court finds that the state-court decision fails [\u00a7\n\n2254](d)'s test (or if [\u00a7 2254](d) does not apply), then an [\u00a7 2254](e) hearing may be needed.\u201d\n\nId. at 1412 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 205 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n206\n\n\n\nAs discussed above, \u00a7 2254(d) applies to all forty-one claims since they were adjudicated\n\non the merits, and Petitioner fails to overcome \u00a7 2254(d) with respect to any of the forty-one\n\nclaims.\n\nFor the reasons stated, Petitioner\u2019s motion for evidentiary hearing shall be denied.\n\nVIII.\n\nMOTION AND RENEWED MOTION TO PRESERVE TESTIMONY\n\nOn June 25, 2014, Petitioner filed a motion to preserve testimony by deposing the\n\nfollowing seven witnesses:\n\nName Case Relation Age\n\nTheodore S.

(ECF\n\nNo. 150.)\n\nPetitioner argues good cause to preserve evidence because these witnesses are of\n\nadvanced age and their proposed testimony will be probative of the claimed ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel, mental defenses, and Petitioner\u2019s actions and lack of culpability, as alleged\n\nin the petition. Respondent filed his opposition on August 27, 2014, arguing there is no good\n\ncause for such relief because Petitioner is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing, and even if he\n\nwere, there is no showing of the probity of proposed testimony or that these witnesses would be\n\nunavailable. (ECF No. 154.) Moreover, Respondent states his need for further discovery should\n\nthe motion be granted.

Supp. 1355, 1356 (E.D. Tex.\n\n1991). Availability of discovery during habeas is vested in the sound discretion of the district\n\ncourt. Campbell v. Blodgett, 982 F.2d 1356, 1358, (9th Cir. 1993).\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 27 provides in pertinent part that:\n\nThe court where a judgment has been rendered may, if an appeal has been taken\n\nor may still be taken, permit a party to depose witnesses to perpetuate their\n\ntestimony for use in the event of further proceedings in that court.\n\nThe party who wants to perpetuate testimony may move for leave to take the\n\ndepositions, on the same notice and service as if the action were pending in the\n\ndistrict court. The motion must show:\n\n(A) the name, address, and expected substance of the testimony of each deponent;\n\nand\n\n(B) the reasons for perpetuating the testimony.\n\nIf the court finds that perpetuating the testimony may prevent a failure or delay of\n\njustice, the court may permit the depositions to be taken and may issue orders like\n\nthose authorized by Rules 34 and 35. The depositions may be taken and used as\n\n\n\nany other deposition taken in a pending district-court action.\n\nThis Rule does not limit a court's power to entertain an action to perpetuate testimony and\n\nmay be used in habeas proceedings. Calderon v. U.S. Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of\n\nCalifornia, 144 F.3d 618, 621 (9th Cir. 1998); accord Martin v. Reynolds Metals Corp., 297 F.2d\n\n49, 55 (9th Cir. 1961) (court has the power to order taking of deposition for purpose of\n\nperpetuating evidence).\n\nGood cause under Rule 27 may be found \u201c[w]here specific allegations before the court\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 207 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n208\n\nshow reason to believe that the petitioner may, if the facts are fully developed, be able to\n\ndemonstrate that he is . . . entitled to relief . . . .\u201d Bracy v. Gramley, 520 U.S. 899, 908-09 (1997),\n\nciting Harris v. Nelson, 394 U.S. 286, 300 (1969).\n\n\n\nHere, the Court finds that Petitioner has not made a sufficient factual showing to establish\n\ngood cause as required by Habeas Corpus Rule 6(a). Apart from age, Petitioner offers no facts\n\nsuggesting unavailability of these witnesses or reasons why this testimony will be lost if not\n\npreserved. See Penn. Mut. Life Ins. Co., v. U.S., 68 F.3d 1371, 1373 (C.A.D.C. 1995). While\n\nage of the deponent may be relevant in determining whether there is sufficient basis to perpetuate\n\ntestimony, Penn. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 68 F.3d at 1375, this Court, for purposes of this proceeding,\n\ndoes not find age alone a sufficient basis to grant relief. Even if it were, Petitioner supports\n\nprobity of the proposed testimony only by citing generally to proposed deponents\u2019 declarations\n\nin the record. Petitioner does not state with sufficient specificity the expected substance of the\n\ntestimony and how it would lead to evidence, admissible under AEDPA, relevant to claims in his\n\npetition and entitlement to relief. Petitioner has not made a sufficient showing that the proposed\n\ndiscovery would lead to relevant evidence likely to be lost. See Martin, 298 F.2d at 55.\n\nIn sum, nothing reasonably suggests a basis to believe the proposed testimony would lead\n\nto factual development showing entitlement to relief, and that the proposed testimony might\n\notherwise be lost. See Bracy, 520 U.S. at 908-09; see also Gilday v. Callahan, 99 F.R.D. 308,\n\n309 (D.C. Mass. 1983) (no \u201cgood cause\u201d under Rule 6 where the facts petitioner seeks to dispute\n\nhad been resolved by state court).\n\nFor the reasons stated, Petitioner\u2019s motion to preserve evidence, as renewed, shall be\n\ndenied.\n\nIX.\n\nMOTION FOR CASE MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE\n\nOn May 1, 2015, Petitioner filed a motion requesting a case management conference to\n\ndiscuss any assistance the Court might require to resolve the pending motion for evidentiary\n\nhearing. (ECF No. 159.)\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 208 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n209\n\nHowever, there is no need for a case management conference given the discussion above\n\ndenying the motion for evidentiary hearing. The motion for case management conference shall\n\nbe denied.\n\nX.\n\nREQUEST TO SEAL AND PROTECT SUPPLEMENTAL LODGED DOCUMENTS\n\nOn June 23, 2015, Respondent filed a request that the following documents be filed under\n\nseal and protected from disclosure: (1) the Request to Seal the November 25, 1987 Reporter\u2019s\n\nTranscript & Penal Code Section 987.9 Materials, totaling two (2) pages, (2) the November 25,\n\n1987 Reporter\u2019s Transcript (conditionally sealed Lodged Document # II), totaling Seven (7)\n\npages, (3) all Penal Code Section 987.9 Materials (conditionally sealed Lodged Document #\n\nQQ), totaling ninety-five (95) pages, and (4) a [Proposed] Order Sealing the conditionally sealed\n\nLodged Documents # II and # QQ), totaling one (1) page.\n\nRespondent argues that these documents, sealed state court records, contain confidential\n\ninformation that should be protected from disclosure in this proceeding. Local Rule 141;\n\nCalifornia Penal Code Section 987.9(d).\n\nThe Court notes that Petitioner has been served with copies of these supplemental record\n\ndocuments. He has not opposed Respondent\u2019s request and the time for doing so has passed.\n\nLocal Rule 141(c).\n\nDocuments may be sealed only by written order of the Court, upon the showing required\n\nby applicable law. Local Rule 141(a). Confidential information may be protected by a\n\nprotective order. Local Rule 141.1(a)(1).\n\nThe Court has reviewed the request to seal and protect documents and the supplemental\n\nlodged documents, and based thereon finds good cause to grant the request.\n\nThe supplemental lodged documents, sealed and unsealed, were not considered by the\n\nCourt in its analysis and disposition of the foregoing claims. The Court notes that these\n\ndocuments, to the extent they are evidence of trial counsel\u2019s defense of Petitioner, do nothing but\n\n\n\nsupport effective assistance by trial counsel and the Court\u2019s above analysis and disposition. (See\n\nCase 1:97-cv-06134-AWI-SAB Document 163 Filed 07/23/15 Page 209 of 213\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n210\n\n[Sealed] Supplemental Lodged Documents #II and #QQ.)\n\nXI.\n\nCERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY\n\nBecause this is a final order adverse to the petitioner, Rule 11 of the Rules Governing\n\nSection 2254 Cases requires this court to issue or deny a Certificate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d).\n\nAccordingly, the Court has sua sponte evaluated the claims within the petition for suitability for\n\nthe issuance of a COA. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c); Turner, 281 F.3d at 864\u201365 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\nA state prisoner seeking a writ of habeas corpus has no absolute entitlement to appeal a\n\ndistrict court's denial of his petition, and an appeal is only allowed in certain circumstances.\n\n\n\nMiller\u2013El, 537 U.S. at 335\u201336 (2003). The controlling statute in determining whether to issue a\n\nCOA is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, which provides as follows:\n\n(a) In a habeas corpus proceeding or a proceeding under section 2255 before a\n\ndistrict judge, the final order shall be subject to review, on appeal, by the court of\n\nappeals for the circuit in which the proceeding is held.\n\n(b) There shall be no right of appeal from a final order in a proceeding to test the\n\nvalidity of a warrant to remove to another district or place for commitment or trial\n\na person charged with a criminal offense against the United States, or to test the\n\nvalidity of such person's detention pending removal proceedings.\n\n(c) (1) Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability, an\n\nappeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from\u2014\n\n(A) the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention\n\ncomplained of arises out of process issued by a State court; or\n\n(B) the final order in a proceeding under section 2255.\n\n(2) A certificate of appealability may issue under paragraph (1) only if the\n\napplicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\n\n(3) The certificate of appealability under paragraph (1) shall indicate which\n\nspecific issue or issues satisfy the showing required by paragraph (2).\n\nThe court may issue a COA only \u201cif jurists of reason could disagree with the district\n\ncourt\u2019s resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented\n\nare adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d Miller-El, 537 U.S. at 327; Slack v.\n\nMcDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).

Petitioner has not made the required substantial showing of the denial of a\n\nconstitutional right. He has not demonstrated good cause to preserve testimony. Accordingly,\n\nthe Court hereby declines to issue a COA as to the remaining claims and requests for evidentiary\n\nhearing and to preserve testimony.\n\nXII.\n\nORDER\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons stated, it is HEREBY ORDERED that:\n\n1. The Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus (ECF No. 38) is DENIED,\n\n2. Petitioner\u2019s motion for evidentiary hearing (ECF No. 120) is DENIED,\n\n3.
