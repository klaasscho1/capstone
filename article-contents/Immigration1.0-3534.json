{"title": "Ex-Official Resentenced In U.S. Passports Case", "body": "\nA former top U.S. immigration official was jailed yesterday for a three-month term for possessing material to make \nfalse passports, far less than a previous sentence of 40 months that he had received for actually having bogus \npassports.\n\nJerry Stuchiner, 45, was sentenced to 40 months in prison last August after he admitted possessing false travel \ndocuments.\nBut the five Honduran passports he was carrying when he was arrested at Hong Kong airport in July were blank \nexcept for an official stamp and signature. By legal definition, a travel document must include a photograph.\n\nAn appeals court ruled he had been charged with the wrong offense and that his conviction was unsustainable, but \nofficers from the Independent Commission Against Corruption rearrested him moments after he left court last \nmonth. This time Stuchiner was charged with the correct offense -- possessing documents for making false \ninstruments -- and was duly sentenced, the commission said.\n\nThe commission was working with U.S. Justice Department officials probing a smuggling ring that took illegal \nmigrants from Asia to the United States. At the time of his arrest, Stuchiner was the top immigration officer in the \nU.S. Embassy in Honduras.  --\n"}
