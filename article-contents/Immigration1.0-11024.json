{"title": "States Revise Rules for Driver's Licenses", "body": "\n Several states are changing the rules for obtaining driver's licenses, particularly for foreign nationals, as a result \nof the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. \n\n Before the attacks, the nation's main form of identification was issued according to loosely enforced standards set \nby each state. \n\nLaw enforcement officials say the 19 hijackers used driver's licenses to open bank accounts and rent cars and \napartments. \n\n Now, Florida, North Carolina, Michigan and others are tightening regulations, and some are considering new \nlicenses that would include biometric data such as fingerprints or retinal patterns. \n\n Some also are considering linking the states' computer networks, elevating the licenses into de facto national ID \ncards. \n\n Under an executive order signed last month by Gov. Jeb Bush (R), foreigners applying for Florida licenses get 30-\nday temporary permits while police investigate their identification. \n\n * In Michigan, which has one of the nation's largest Arab populations, Secretary of State Candice Miller proposed a \nbill that would bar illegal immigrants from receiving licenses. \n\n * Wisconsin suspended acceptance of a visa form, which foreign visitors fill out and the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service checks, as proof of residency. \n\n * New Jersey stopped issuing licenses to immigrants whose visas expire within a year. \n\n * Florida and North Carolina are closing loopholes that allowed drivers the option of refusing to be photographed \nfor religious reasons. \n"}
