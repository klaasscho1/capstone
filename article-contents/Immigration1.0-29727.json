{"title": "CITY COUNCIL REJECTS BOYCOTT, OKS RESOLUTION", "body": "\nTHE CITY COUNCIL tiptoed into the Arizona immigration fight yesterday by passing a toned-down condemnation of \nthe law.\n\nCouncil Speaker Christine Quinn refused to allow a vote on a general boycott of Arizona, so members approved a \nban against Council employees using public funds to travel to the Grand Canyon State.\n\nThe resolution also authorizes Quinn to file a friend-of-the court brief on behalf of the Council supporting the \nfederal lawsuit against the contested law, which calls for cops to check immigrants' legal status.\n\n\"I actually think the new version of this resolution is stronger,\" argued Quinn, who called the original resolution \n\"more rhetorical.\"\n\n\"What we wanted to do in this resolution was not, you know, preach to others,\" she added.\n\nSponsors of the boycott and immigration advocates voiced their support of the adopted resolution.\n\nFour Republicans and two Democrats voted against the measure.\n\n\"When Arizona starts telling New York what to do about terrorism, that's when we can start telling Arizona what to \ndo about illegal immigration,\" groused Councilman Peter Vallone Jr. (D-Queens), who opposed the plan.\n"}
