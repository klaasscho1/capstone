{"title": "AROUND THE NATION;Rumanian Defector Granted Asylum in U.S.", "body": "\nA Rumanian seaman who fled a freighter loading cargo in the Port of Houston was granted asylum in the United \nStates today, the Immigration and Naturalization Service announced.\n\nThe seaman, Paul Firica, said he had been troubled by a lack of religious toleration in Rumania and decided to \ndefect to where ''freedom is respected.''\n\nImmigration officials said the 44-year-old diesel mechanic walked off the freighter Zalau shortly before the vessel \nleft Houston late Tuesday. He made his way to the Harris County jail and was subsequently sent to the immigration \nagency for questioning.\n\nLast week another Rumanian sailor, Stefan Vernea, 38, was granted asylum after jumping from a merchant ship \nin Jacksonville, Fla.\n\nPaul O'Neill, an immigration official, said such defections were not uncommon but added that ''the situation is \nsensitive'' because of an incident in New Orleans last week when a Soviet sailor twice jumped ship, only to be \nre=turned to the ship.\n"}
