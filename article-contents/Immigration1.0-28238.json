He's used such technology in programs to help reduce \nviolence against women in the Congo and to remind patients to take HIV medication in sub-Saharan Africa. Last \nweek, the agency said in a blog post that it plans to promote Twitter as a \"worldwide platform in which people can \ndiscuss the meaning of democracy and exchange ideas from diverse perspectives.\"\n\nThe dinner included Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, and Microsoft chief \nresearch and strategy officer Craig Mundie. The meeting also included nonprofit leaders and representatives from \nthe Web 2.0 world such as Shervin Pishevar, chief executive of mobile game company Social Gaming Network; \nJason Liebman, chief of online video aggregator Howcast; and James Eberhard, founder of the mobile donations \ncompany Mobile Accord.\n\nClinton joked that it was the youngest dinner she had hosted at the State Department, Ross said.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nIMAGE\n"}
