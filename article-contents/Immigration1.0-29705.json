{"title": "Palin: Obama lacks guts on immigration; President assailed over federal lawsuit against Arizona law", "body": "\nFormer Alaska governor Sarah Palin said Sunday that Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer (R) has \"the cojones\" that \nPresident Obama \"does not have\" to take on illegal immigration.\n\nAppearing on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Palin (R) blasted Obama  over the Justice Department's lawsuit to block \nArizona's controversial new law and attacked him in particular for not addressing \"sanctuary cities\" -- where local \nlaw enforcement is prohibited from asking people about their immigration status. Arizona's law bans sanctuary \ncities.\n\nPalin said the president and congressional Democrats \"are all wet\" on plans to let the George W. Bush \nadministration's tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans expire. \"It's idiotic to think about increasing taxes at a time like \nthis,\" Palin said. She added that her \"palm isn't large enough\" to write all her notes down, and she proceeded to \nread notes about tax policy from a sheet of paper.\n\nPalin declined to address \"fickle\" polls showing that she remains unpopular with independents. \"I don't blame \npeople for not knowing what I stand for,\" Palin said. \"If I believed everything I read in the media, I wouldn't like me \neither.\"\n\nPalin said her family has been avoiding their front yard and \"certain angles\" in their home after an investigative \nreporter moved in next door. She said her family has changed its behavior as a result of his arrival, and she \naccused the reporter, Joe McGinniss, of infringing  its privacy and trying to \"hamper some of our freedom.\"\n\n\"Some people need to get a life,\" Palin said.\n"}
