{"title": "SPORTS PEOPLE;Support for Swimmer", "body": "\nThe United States Senate has passed a bill, sponsored by Jeremiah Denton, Republican of Alabama, to grant Peter \nBerndt, a 22-year-old East German swimmer, American citizenship four years early. Berndt was granted political \nasylum in the United States on Jan. 7, 1985, after he defected at an airport in Oklahoma City while he was traveling \nwith the East German team.\nHe wants to compete for the United States in the 1988 Olympics but must be an American citizen to do so. Berndt, \na former world-record holder in the 40-meter individual medley, has enrolled at the University of Alabama and is \ncompeting on the team. The legislation may run into a snag in the House of Representatives, however, where a \nsimilar bill is being sponsored by Representative Ben Erdreich, Republican of Alabama. Representative Romano L. \nMazzoli, Democrat of Kentucky, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees and Law, has \nwritten Representative Erdreich, saying that the panel considers private immigration bills an ''extraordinary remedy'' \nfor aliens with unusual problems. Representative Mazzoli has said there is no precedent for granting permanent \nresidence or expedited citizenship, but Representative Erdreich said Monday that the swimmer was almost certain \nto get permanent residence status next year.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nphoto of Peter Berndt (NYT)\n"}
