{"title": "Bishops Want Immigration Raids to End", "body": "\nRoman Catholic bishops urged the Bush administration to halt workplace immigration raids, saying the \n''humanitarian cost'' was ''unacceptable in a civilized society.'' Speaking on behalf of the United States Conference \nof Catholic Bishops, John C. Wester, the bishop of Salt Lake City said that the escalating number of worksite \nraids over the past year had spread fear in immigrant communities and had made it difficult for detained immigrants \nto obtain legal representation. Bishop Wester also called on the Department of Homeland Security to refrain from \nconducting raids in churches, health centers and schools. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
