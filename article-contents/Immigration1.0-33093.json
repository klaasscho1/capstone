From June 2003 to December 2004, it collected almost $101 million from 3,500 investors in \nGermany, Switzerland and Austria, authorities said. Once the money reached the United States, investors lost \naccess to it.\n\nFBI agents and local police on Friday began tracing Engler's steps in southern Nevada, finding more than 1,000 \npieces of artwork at a storage facility he rented in Boulder City, about 25 miles east of Las Vegas.\n\nFBI agent Patrick Turner in Las Vegas said the warrant search at the storage facility was an effort to recover \nproceeds on behalf of alleged fraud victims.\n\nA local court in Mannheim, Germany, issued a warrant in December 2007 accusing Engler of multiple criminal \nfraud charges, according to an ICE statement. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison.\n"}
