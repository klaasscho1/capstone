{"title": "Skilled or Not, Immigrants Aid U.S. Economy;Pandering to Bias", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nYour May 27 editorial \"Immigrants and the Economy\" pointed out the lack of foundation for anti-immigrant \nsentiments based upon the economy. Such sentiments are sadly widespread and have even found a place in the \nNew York State Lottery's promotion of one of its products. One ad reads: \"In 2007 intelligent life will be discovered \non Mars. Then they'll come here and take your job.\" When the government of a state with a high immigrant \npopulation panders to anti-immigrant prejudice in such a fashion, it's clear that much needs to be done to re-\neducate ourselves and our leaders.\n\n \n\nDANIEL S.
