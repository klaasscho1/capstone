A Category 2 customer is a representative who has been authorized by actual\n\n customers to represent them. Category 2 involves a more formal arrangement\n\n where a customer or a group of customers selects a more skilled person to\n\n represent the customer\u2019s views in a proceeding. A customer or group of\n\n customers may also form or authorize a group to represent them, and the group,\n\n in turn, may authorize a representative such as an attorney to represent the group.\n\n A representative authorized by a customer must identify the residential customer(s)\n\n being represented and provide authorization from at least one customer. See D.98-\n\n 04-059 at 30.\n\n \u2610\n\n 3. A Category 3 customer is a formally organized group authorized, by its articles\n\n of incorporation or bylaws to represent the interests of residential customers or\n\n small commercial customers receiving bundled electric service from an electrical\n\n corporation.2 Certain environmental groups that represent residential customers\n\n with concerns for the environment may also qualify as Category 3 customers,\n\n even if the above requirement is not specifically met in the articles or bylaws.\n\n See D.98-04-059, footnote at 3.\n\n \uf052\n\n\n\n The party\u2019s explanation of its customer status must include the percentage of the\n\n intervenors members who are residential ratepayers or the percentage of the\n\n intervenors members who are customers receiving bundled electric service from\n\n an electrical corporation, and must include supporting documentation: (i.e.,\n\n articles of incorporation or bylaws).\n\n Sierra Club meets the third definition of \u201ccustomer\u201d provided in Public Utilities Code\n\n section 1802(b)(1)(C). Sierra Club is a \u201crepresentative of a group or organization\n\n authorized pursuant to its articles of incorporation or bylaws to represent the interests\n\n of residential customers . . . .\u201d Sierra Club is a non-profit, member-based, \u201cpublic\n\n benefit\u201d California corporation with over 600,000 members nationwide and more\n\n than 140,000 members living in California. Many of Sierra Club\u2019s California\n\n members are residential customers of PacifiCorp. Sierra Club estimates that up to\n\n 2,000 members are customers of PacifiCorp. Sierra Club\u2019s membership consists\n\n entirely (100%) of residential ratepayers. (Sierra Club cannot precisely state the\n\n number of members that are PacifiCorp\u2019s customers because PacifiCorp\u2019s service\n\n territory does not overlap completely with Sierra Club local chapters.)\n\n Sierra Club\u2019s Articles, Bylaws, Standing Rules and policies authorize and require it to\n\n represent the environmental interests of its members - including PacifiCorp\n\n customers. Sierra Club\u2019s Board of Directors is democratically elected by its members.\n\n (See Sierra Club Standing Rule (\u201cS.R.\u201d) 4.8.1.) Sierra Club is expressly authorized to\n\n participate in environmental legal actions to advance its mission, including lawsuits\n\n\n\n 2 Intervenors representing either a group of residential customers or small commercial customers who receive\n\n bundled electric service from an electrical corporation, must indicate in Part I, Section A, Item #4 of this form, the\n\n percentage of their members who are residential customers or the percentage of their members who receive \nbundled\n\n electric service from an electrical corporation. The NOI may be rejected if this information is omitted.\n\n Revised September 2014\n\n and administrative proceedings. (See S.R. 5.15.1 and 9.1.1.)\n\n For decades, Sierra Club has participated in environmental lawsuits and\n\n administrative proceedings, and has appeared many times before the California Public\n\n Utilities Commission. For example, Sierra Club was an active participant in the\n\n Energy Storage and 2010 and 2012 Long-Term Procurement Plan proceedings\n\n (\u201cLTPP\u201d), and was awarded fees for its substantial contribution to the 2010 LTPP.\n\n (See D.13- 10-068.) Open proceedings Sierra Club is active in include Residential\n\n Rate Design (R.12-06-013), the 2014 LTPP (R.13-12-010), the Joint Reliability Plan\n\n (R.14-02- 001), and SDG&E\u2019s Application for Approval of the Carlsbad Energy\n\n Center PPTA (A.14-07-009). Sierra Club\u2019s environmental concerns encompass a\n\n broad range of energy and pollution issues. Specifically, Sierra Club is a leader in the\n\n effort to reduce California\u2019s and the nation\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels. The highest\n\n current priority of Sierra Club\u2019s work is eliminating the need for fossil fuel-fired\n\n power plants through the development of affordable renewable energy and clean\n\n integrating resources. Sierra Club has been active in the Legislature and its\n\n committees, as well as in the Governor\u2019s office, to accelerate California\u2019s transition to\n\n a carbon free grid. The interests of the customers represented by Sierra Club are\n\n\n\n unique and well suited to this proceeding and are not adequately represented by other\n\n parties that have intervened in this proceeding. Sierra Club participated in\n\n proceedings in Oregon and Utah addressing the same Deer Creek transaction that is at\n\n issue here, and therefore has developed unique expertise and knowledge about the\n\n risks associated with the transaction.\n\n As the Commission has recognized: \u201cWith respect to environmental groups, we have\n\n concluded they were eligible in the past with the understanding that they represent\n\n customers whose environmental interests include the concern that, e.g., regulatory\n\n policies encourage the adoption of all cost-effective conservation measures and\n\n discourage unnecessary new generating resources that are expensive and\n\n environmentally damaging. (D.88-04-066, mimeo at 3). They represent customers\n\n who have a concern for the environment which distinguishes their interests from the\n\n interests represented by Commission staff, for example.\u201d D.98-04-059, at 29 n. 14.\n\n The Commission has accordingly approved Sierra Club\u2019s intervention with\n\n entitlement to compensation on several occasions. See, e.g., D.13-12-027, D.13-10-\n\n 068, D.09-10-054. Sierra Club, consistent with its governing documents,\n\n appropriately represents the environmental and energy conservation interests of its\n\n members who are California IOU customers. Sierra Club therefore qualifies as a\n\n \u201ccustomer\u201d as defined in section 1802(b)(1)(C) of the Public Utilities Code and the\n\n Commission\u2019s decisions applying this section to environmental organizations.\n\n Identify all attached documents in Part IV.\n\n Attachment 1: Certificate of Service;\n\n Attachment 2: Sierra Club Bylaws and Standing Rules;\n\n\n\n Revised September 2014\n\n Attachment 3: Sierra Club Articles of Incorporation\n\n Do you have any direct economic interest in outcomes of the proceeding? 3\n\n Yes: \u2610 No: \uf052\n\n If \u201cYes\u201d, explain:\n\n B. Conflict of Interest (&sect; 1802.3) Check\n\n 1. Is the customer a representative of a group representing the interests of\n\n small commercial customers who receive bundled electric service from an\n\n electrical corporation?\n\n \u2610Yes\n\n \uf052 No\n\n 2. If the answer to the above question is \u201cYes\u201d, does the customer have a conflict\n\n arising from prior representation before the Commission?\n\n \u2610Yes\n\n \u2610No\n\n C. Timely Filing of Notice of Intent (NOI) (&sect; 1804(a)(1)): Check\n\n 1. Is the party\u2019s NOI filed within 30 days after a Prehearing Conference?\n\n Date of Prehearing Conference: Click here to enter a date.\n\n \u2610Yes\n\n \uf052No\n\n 2. Is the party\u2019s NOI filed at another time (for example, because no Prehearing\n\n Conference was held, the proceeding will take less than\n\n 30 days, the schedule did not reasonably allow parties to identify issues within\n\n the timeframe normally permitted, or new issues have emerged)?\n\n \uf052Yes\n\n\n\n \u2610No\n\n 2a. The party\u2019s description of the reasons for filing its NOI at this other time:\n\n A Prehearing Conference has not been set at this time.\n\n 2b. The party\u2019s information on the proceeding number, date, and decision number for any\n\n Commission decision, Commissioner ruling, Administrative Law Judge\u2019s ruling, or other\n\n document authorizing the filing of NOI at that other time:\n\n On October 1, 2015, the Commission made a preliminary determination that no hearing was\n\n necessary. Notice of the filing of the application first appeared on the Commission\u2019s daily\n\n calendar on September 23, 2015. In accordance with Rule 2.6(a), protests were therefore due\n\n within 30 days, which is October 23, 2015. In accordance with Rule 17.1(a)(2), notices to file\n\n intervenor compensation are due 30 days after the deadline for responsive pleadings, which is\n\n November 22, 2015, a Sunday. Therefore, in accordance with Rule 1.15, this notice is timely if\n\n filed on or before November 23, 2015.\n\n 3 See Rule 17.1(e).\n\n Revised September 2014\n\n PART II: SCOPE OF ANTICIPATED PARTICIPATION\n\n (To be completed by the party (\u201ccustomer\u201d) intending to claim intervenor\n\n compensation)\n\n A. Planned Participation (&sect; 1804(a)(2)(A)(i)):\n\n The party\u2019s statement of the issues on which it plans to participate:\n\n Sierra Club plans to address whether PacifiCorp\u2019s decision to enter into the Deer Creek\n\n transaction, transfer ratepayer assets to Bowie Resources Partners, and enter into the long term\n\n coal supply agreements bundled into the agreement was in the best interests of customers. Sierra\n\n Club further plans to address PacifiCorp\u2019s violation of Public Utilities Code Section 851, and the\n\n\n\n environmental impacts of the transaction as they relate to the California Environmental Quality\n\n Act (CEQA).\n\n The party\u2019s explanation of how it plans to avoid duplication of effort with other parties:\n\n Sierra Club is not aware of any other party that plans to intervene in this proceeding. To the\n\n extent other parties do intervene, Sierra Club will work to avoid duplicative effort.\n\n The party\u2019s description of the nature and extent of the party\u2019s planned participation in this\n\n proceeding (to the extent that it is possible to describe on the date this NOI is filed).\n\n Sierra Club objected to the Commission\u2019s preliminary determination that hearings will not be\n\n necessary. Sierra Club believes that hearings will be necessary to allow Sierra Club and other\n\n interested parties an opportunity to provide expert testimony to rebut the assertions made by\n\n PacifiCorp that the transaction is in the public interest. Sierra Club intends to conduct discovery,\n\n introduce evidence showing the significant environmental impacts that will result from the\n\n transaction, and participate in evidentiary hearings and briefing.\n\n B. The party\u2019s itemized estimate of the compensation that the party expects to request,\n\n based on the anticipated duration of the proceeding (&sect; 1804(a)(2)(A)(ii)):\n\n Item Hours Rate $ Total $ #\n\n ATTORNEY, EXPERT, AND ADVOCATE FEES\n\n Travis Ritchie 100 $320 $32,000\n\n [Attorney 2]\n\n [Expert 1] 60 $200 $12,000\n\n [Expert 2] 60 $150 $9,000\n\n [Advocate 1]\n\n [Advocate 2]\n\n Subtotal:\n\n\n\n $53,000\n\n OTHER FEES\n\n [Person 1]\n\n [Person 2]\n\n Subtotal: $\n\n COSTS\n\n Revised September 2014\n\n [Item 1]\n\n [Item 2]\n\n Subtotal: $\n\n TOTAL ESTIMATE: $53,000\n\n Estimated Budget by Issues:\n\n At this early point in the proceeding, Sierra Club does not know which issues will require what\n\n proportion of time. Sierra Club expects 100% of the budget for experts to apply to a review of the\n\n Deer Creek transaction. For attorney\u2019s fees, Sierra Club roughly estimates the following: 60% -\n\n Deer Creek transaction; 10% - PacifiCorp violation of Section 851; 30% - CEQA.\n\n When entering items, type over bracketed text; add additional rows to table as necessary.\n\n Estimate may (but does not need to) include estimated Claim preparation time. Claim\n\n preparation time is typically compensated at &frac12; professional hourly rate.\n\n PART III: SHOWING OF SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL HARDSHIP\n\n (To be completed by party (\u201ccustomer\u201d) intending to claim intervenor\n\n compensation; see Instructions for options for providing this\n\n information)\n\n A. The party claims \u201csignificant financial hardship\u201d for its Intervenor\n\n\n\n Compensation Claim in this proceeding on the following basis:\n\n Applies\n\n (check)\n\n 1. \u201c[T]he customer cannot afford, without undue hardship, to pay the costs of\n\n effective participation, including advocate\u2019s fees, expert witness fees, and other\n\n reasonable costs of participation\u201d (&sect; 1802(g)); or\n\n \u2610\n\n 2. \u201c[I]n the case of a group or organization, the economic interest of the Individual\n\n members of the group or organization is small in comparison to the costs of effective\n\n participation in the proceeding\u201d (&sect; 1802(g)).\n\n \uf052\n\n 3. A &sect; 1802(g) finding of significant financial hardship in another proceeding,\n\n made within one year prior to the commencement of this proceeding, created a\n\n rebuttable presumption in this proceeding ( &sect; 1804(b)(1)).\n\n Commission\u2019s finding of significant financial hardship made in proceeding\n\n number:\n\n Date of Administrative Law Judge\u2019s Ruling (or CPUC Decision) in which the\n\n finding of significant financial hardship was made:\n\n \u2610\n\n B. The party\u2019s explanation of the factual basis for its claim of \u201csignificant financial\n\n hardship\u201d (&sect; 1802(g)) (necessary documentation, if warranted, is attached to the NOI:\n\n Sierra Club received a ruling of significant financial hardship in R.14-02-001 on July 25,\n\n 2014. Sierra Club has also received the same finding in other Commission proceedings\n\n Revised September 2014\n\n\n\n including A.10-03- 014, R.08-08-009, R.10-05-006, R.12-06-013. In R. 12-06-013, ALJs\n\n Sullivan and McKinney Revised September 2014 determined, on February 25, 2013, that:\n\n Sierra Club\u2019s estimated cost of participating in this proceeding far exceeds the\n\n economic interests of the individual members of Sierra Club or of Sierra Club itself.\n\n Thus, Sierra Club showing meets the eligibility criteria for intervenor compensation set\n\n forth in &sect; 1804 because Sierra Club has demonstrated that it qualifies for a finding of\n\n significant financial hardship pursuant to &sect; 1802(g).\n\n The average utility bill of Sierra Club\u2019s California members and the customers it represents\n\n continues to be small compared to the costs of effective participation in this proceeding. Sierra\n\n Club, therefore, should continue to be entitled to a finding of significant financial hardship\n\n pursuant to Public Utilities Code section 1802(g).\n\n Sierra Club does not anticipate any challenge to its eligibility for compensation in this\n\n proceeding. If any party does attempt to challenge Sierra Club\u2019s eligibility, Sierra Club\n\n requests that it be granted the opportunity to reply to such party's allegations within 10 days\n\n after the service of such filing\n\n PART IV: ATTACHMENTS DOCUMENTING SPECIFIC\n\n ASSERTIONS MADE IN THIS NOTICE\n\n (The party (\u201ccustomer\u201d) intending to claim intervenor compensation\n\n identifies and attaches documents; add rows as necessary)\n\n Attachment No. Description\n\n 1 Certificate of Service\n\n 2 Sierra Club Bylaws and Standing Rules\n\n\n\n 3 Sierra Club Articles of Incorporation\n\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE RULING4\n\n (Administrative Law Judge completes)\n\n Check all\n\n that apply\n\n 1. The Notice of Intent (NOI) is rejected for the following reasons: \u2610\n\n a. The NOI has not demonstrated the party\u2019s status as a \u201ccustomer\u201d for the\n\n following reason(s):\n\n \u2610\n\n b. The NOI has not demonstrated that the NOI was timely filed (Part I(B)) for \u2610\n\n 4 A Ruling needs not be issued unless: (a) the NOI is deficient; (b) the Administrative Law Judge desires to \naddress\n\n specific issues raised by the NOI (to point out similar positions, areas of potential duplication in showings,\n\n unrealistic expectations for compensation, or other matters that may affect the customer\u2019s Intervenor \nCompensation\n\n Claim); or (c) the NOI has included a claim of \u201csignificant financial hardship\u201d that requires a finding under\n\n &sect; 1802(g).\n\n Revised September 2014\n\n the following reason(s):\n\n c. The NOI has not adequately described the scope of anticipated participation\n\n (Part II, above) for the following reason(s):\n\n \u2610\n\n 2. The NOI has demonstrated significant financial hardship for the reasons set\n\n forth in Part III of the NOI (above).\n\n \u2610\n\n 3. The NOI has not demonstrated significant financial hardship for the following\n\n\n\n reason(s):\n\n \u2610\n\n 4. The Administrative Law Judge provides the following additional\n\n guidance (see &sect; 1804(b)(2)):\n\n \u2610\n\n IT IS RULED that:\n\n 1. The Notice of Intent is rejected. \u2610\n\n 2. The customer has satisfied the eligibility requirements of Pub. Util. Code\n\n &sect; 1804(a).\n\n \u2610\n\n 3. The customer has shown significant financial hardship. \u2610\n\n 4. The customer is preliminarily determined to be eligible for intervenor\n\n compensation in this proceeding. However, a finding of significant financial\n\n hardship in no way ensures compensation.\n\n \u2610\n\n 5. Additional guidance is provided to the customer as set forth above. \u2610\n\n Dated _____________, at San Francisco, California.\n\n Administrative Law Judge\n\n BEFORE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA\n\n In the Matter of the Application of PACIFICORP\n\n (U901E) for Authority to Sell Certain Mining Assets in\n\n Accordance with Public Utilities Code Section 851\n\n Application 15-09-007\n\n (Filed Sep. 18, 2015)\n\n CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE OF SIERRA CLUB\n\n\n\n I, Alexa Zimbalist, hereby certify that I have this day served, for proceeding A. 15-09-\n\n 007, the following documents:\n\n &bull; Notice Of Intent To Claim Intervenor Compensation\n\n &bull; Certificate of Service\n\n These documents were sent via electronic mail to all persons for whom email addresses were\n\n listed on the most recently updated service list, and paper copies were sent via USPS to all\n\n persons for whom email addresses were not listed.

The purposes of the Sierra Club are\n\n To explore, enjoy, and protect the wild places of the Earth; to practice and promote\n\n the responsible use of the Earth's ecosystems and resources; to educate and enlist\n\n humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and human environment;\n\n and to use all lawful means to carry out these objectives.\n\n SR. 2.2.1: Civil Disobedience\n\n (a) The Club will not encourage, request or direct any person to violate the law.\n\n No chapter, group, or other entity of the Club shall encourage, request or direct\n\n any person to violate the law.\n\n (b) The Club recognizes that it cannot control the private actions of its members,\n\n and in particular cannot prevent its members from engaging in acts of civil\n\n disobedience. However, no member of the Club is authorized to use, display, or\n\n\n\n invoke the Club's name or logo (including the name of any chapter, group, or\n\n other entity of the Club) in connection with committing, or encouraging,\n\n requesting or directing any other person to commit, any violation of the law.\n\n (c) The Club recognizes that some of its members have become closely identified\n\n with the Club in the minds of the public. The mere involvement of such\n\n members, either individually or collectively, in an act of civil disobedience or\n\n other violation of law, without any effort on their part to use, display, or invoke\n\n the Club's name, or logo in connection with that act, shall not be deemed a\n\n violation of this Standing Rule. Members shall take all reasonable precautions to\n\n avoid confusion over whether the Club is involved in such acts.\n\n (d) If there is a coalition event such as a march, rally, protest etc. that is peaceful\n\n and lawful, but where a subset of the participants plan to participate in an act of\n\n civil disobedience in association with the event; the Sierra Club may endorse,\n\n organize support for, and participate in the event, but it may not use Club\n\n resources to promote participation specifically in the civil disobedience activity.\n\n Resolution of 11/15/92; amended and adopted as a SR. 05/2/93;\n\n amended 05/19-20/06, 02/24/07, 11/16/2013\n\n 3\n\n SR. 2.2.2: Representing the Club\n\n (a) No Club member, present or former leader, or member of the staff shall make\n\n a statement or take a public position in the name of the Club that is contrary to, or\n\n creates a misimpression of a policy or position established by the Board, the duly\n\n\n\n authorized chapter, group, committee or other Club entity, or the Club\n\n membership through referendum. When speaking or taking a public position on\n\n their own behalf, or on the behalf of organizations other than the Club, members\n\n shall avoid giving the impression that they are representing the Club and endeavor\n\n to correct any misimpression in this regard.\n\n Adopted 03/01-02/97; amended 11/14-15/98, 05/19-20/06, 02/24/07\n\n (b) No Club member shall give permission for her/his membership or position in\n\n the Club to be used in any manner, including \"for identification purposes only,\"\n\n on the letterhead or in any other official publications or documents of any other\n\n organization unless such use has been expressly approved by the relevant Club\n\n unit.\n\n Adopted 12/2/84; amended 05/19-20/06, 02/24/07\n\n SR. 2.2.3: Defense of Name\n\n If the Club is criticized or attacked in the public media on any issue, including,\n\n but not restricted to ballot issues or procedures, the Board or its designees are free\n\n to respond fully and publicly, addressing any point raised. Any Board-authorized\n\n communications in response may utilize Club funds and any internal\n\n communication media or system, including electronic mail.\n\n Adopted 02/19-20/94; amended 05/19-20/06\n\n SR. 2.2.4: Club Assets\n\n National, chapter, group, and other Club entities are authorized to use assets that\n\n\n\n are made available to them for delivery of current programs, including coalition\n\n building, fundraising, and administrative activities necessary to carry out the\n\n mission and achieve the goals of the Club. However, it is within the exclusive\n\n powers of the Board to restrict, lien, hypothecate, lend, encumber, transfer to\n\n foundations, trusts or other third parties without consideration, the assets of the\n\n Club. This exclusive Board power does not annul restrictions imposed by donors.\n\n Adopted as a policy 09/26-27/98; amended and adopted as a Standing\n\n Rule 02/20-21/2000; amended 05/19-20/06, 02/24/07\n\n SR. 2.2.5: Conflicts of Interest\n\n (a) Preamble. Every person elected or appointed to a position of authority in an\n\n organization has a duty of loyalty to, and must act in the interests of, that\n\n organization. A conflict of interest is a situation that exists when someone's\n\n loyalty may be divided between the first organization and a second person or\n\n 4\n\n organization. No one should be faulted merely because a conflict of interest\n\n situation exists. A problem arises only when someone takes action related to the\n\n conflict. A person in a conflict of interest situation may act appropriately by\n\n respecting his/her duty of loyalty, or may act inappropriately by violating it. It is\n\n the action - the behavior - that is or is not appropriate.\n\n (b) General Policy. As part of their duty of loyalty to the Club, volunteers and\n\n staff have an obligation and responsibility (i) to disclose any conflict or potential\n\n conflict of interest on any issue promptly as such conflict arises, (ii) to abstain\n\n from participation in FINAL deliberations and decisions concerning that issue,\n\n and (iii) to abstain from public comment upon that issue.\n\n\n\n (c) Definition.\n\n (i) A conflict of interest situation exists when any volunteer or staff member, or\n\n said person\u2019s immediate family, or any party, group or organization to which said\n\n person has allegiance, has a direct or indirect financial or other material interest in\n\n a proposed contract, transaction, or arrangement with the Club, or in a policy or\n\n position of in the Club.\n\n (ii) An interest in holding an elected or appointed Club volunteer leadership\n\n position does not constitute or create the appearance of a conflict of interest. A\n\n person seeking appointment or election to such a position may properly deliberate\n\n and vote on the setting of rules of general application for the appointment or\n\n election process, endorsements for the position, and on the appointment or\n\n election itself.\n\n (iii) Club volunteer leaders are responsible for self-identifying those individuals\n\n that the volunteer considers to be \u201cimmediate family members\u201d in this policy.\n\n (d) Applicability. This policy applies to all volunteers, including volunteer\n\n leaders who are authorized to vote in the decision of any Club entity at the group,\n\n chapter, committee or national level, to all volunteers who are authorized to speak\n\n on behalf of the Club, and to all staff, including staff of chapters, groups or\n\n committees, and including all independent contractors.\n\n (e) Existence of a Conflict of Interest Situation.\n\n (i) When there is a doubt as to whether a conflict of interest situation exists, the\n\n matter shall be resolved by a vote of the authorized voting members of the Club\n\n entity involved, with the person concerning whose situation the doubt has arisen\n\n\n\n present, but not voting or, in the case of any staff member, by the Executive\n\n Director. The Board of Directors is the final arbiter on all matters involving\n\n conflict of interest situations.\n\n 5\n\n (ii) When there is disagreement on whether a conflict of interest exists, the Club\n\n entity involved in the decision making process resolves that question by a separate\n\n vote on each matter and each individual who is argued to have a conflict. If more\n\n than one individual is argued to have a factually indistinguishable conflict of\n\n interest, the Club entity may resolve the question by a single vote on whether a\n\n conflict exists as to all such individuals. A conflict of interest will be found to\n\n exist only if a majority of the members of the Club entity who were present at the\n\n meeting when the disagreement arose votes that such a conflict exists.\n\n (f) Obligation to Disclose. Disclosure shall be to the Club entity (group or\n\n chapter executive committee, internal or issue committee, or Board or other\n\n national entity) most directly involved or, in the case of staff, to the Executive\n\n Director. At least annually, or at the time the situation arises, all volunteer leaders\n\n and staff shall disclose any conflict of interest situation. At least annually, all\n\n volunteer leaders and staff members shall disclose any direct or indirect benefits\n\n that they are receiving or will receive as a result of agreements between the Club\n\n and any outside party. However, existence of a minor interest in pension fund\n\n investments and third party-managed funds shall not constitute a conflict of\n\n interest.\n\n (g) Obligation to Abstain from Deliberations. When any such conflict of interest\n\n\n\n situation is relevant to a matter requiring action by any Club entity within which,\n\n or over which, the person concerned has any authority, decision-making role, or\n\n voice, the interested person shall call it to the attention of that entity and shall\n\n retire from the room in which the Club entity is meeting and shall not participate\n\n in the final deliberations regarding the matter. However, that person has the right\n\n to, and should, upon request, provide the Club entity with any and all relevant\n\n information they may have concerning the matter. Final deliberation means a\n\n discussion on the merits of a matter pending by motion before a Club entity.\n\n (h) Obligation to Abstain from Decision. In any conflict of interest situation, the\n\n person concerned shall not vote or otherwise participate in any decision\n\n concerning that matter.\n\n (i) Documentation. The minutes of the meeting of the Club entity shall reflect\n\n that the conflict of interest was disclosed and that the interested person was not\n\n present during the final deliberation or vote and did not vote.\n\n (j) Obligation to Abstain from Public Statement. No volunteer or staff member\n\n shall make any public statement, as a Club spokesperson, on any issue (internal or\n\n external) regarding which they may have a possible conflict of interest. All\n\n volunteers and staff shall refrain from public comment, as a Club spokesperson,\n\n about conflict of interest issues except as authorized by the President.\n\n (k) Notice and Review of Policy. A copy of this conflict of interest policy shall be\n\n furnished to each volunteer leader and staff member who is presently serving the\n\n 6\n\n Club, or who may hereafter become associated with it. This policy shall be\n\n\n\n reviewed annually as a part of a meeting of each Club entity for the information\n\n and guidance of volunteer leaders, and any new volunteer leaders shall be advised\n\n of the policy upon undertaking the duties of their office. This policy shall be\n\n prominently included in the employment manual for all existing and new staff\n\n members.\n\n [Notes: This Standing Rule does not apply to concerns arising from attendance\n\n and participation at meetings by Club members who are not voting members of\n\n the Club entity at issue. For information on that topic, see Bylaw 5.14 and\n\n chapter and group bylaws regarding open meetings. For Guidelines in the\n\n implemention of this policy, see Board Policies document.]\n\n Adopted 11/10-11/90, amended 11/19-20/04, 05/19-20/06, 05/16/09\n\n SR. 2.2.6: Standards of Conduct\n\n (a) Affirmative Standards of Conduct\n\n (i) Serving in an appointed to elected position of leadership is a privilege that can\n\n be lost either by ignoring the duty of loyalty expected of all Club leaders or by\n\n violating the following affirmative standards of conduct.\n\n (ii) Club leaders have an obligation to meet the following affirmative standards of\n\n conduct, and to hold other leaders accountable to them as well, in all Club\n\n interactions with others, including in person, in writing, on email, or on the phone.\n\n (A) Communicate and work together with common courtesy and collegial respect;\n\n disagree without being disagreeable.\n\n (B) Create a welcoming environment for new members, visitors, guests, staff and\n\n volunteers. Avoid cliquishness, behavior that fosters an \u201cinsider\u201d vs. \u201coutsider\u201d\n\n\n\n culture and language or behavior that offends others. Seek to welcome and\n\n engage people who reflect the diversity of the community.\n\n (C) Always represent the Club and its mission in a positive and professional\n\n manner; keep disagreements within the Club.\n\n (D) Accurately present the Club\u2019s policies and positions when communicating on\n\n behalf of the Club; don\u2019t use a Club leadership role or title to advance personal\n\n views that are not the Club\u2019s position.\n\n (E) Respect your obligation to the Club\u2019s members; use member lists and\n\n information about members for Club purposes only.\n\n (F) Use Club resources wisely and in keeping with the fiduciary responsibility of\n\n all leaders.\n\n (G) Foster an open democratic decision-making process; respect decisions once\n\n they are made.\n\n (H) When speaking of other Club leaders praise publicly, criticize privately and\n\n tactfully.\n\n (I) Seek to resolve differences with other Club leaders, avoid fractionalism and\n\n behavior that exacerbates or prolongs conflict.\n\n 7\n\n (J) Respect the policies and procedures that have been established by and for\n\n members engaged in specific Club activities; when in doubt, ask.\n\n (b) Misconduct. The following actions constitute misconduct:\n\n\n\n (A) Physical or sexual assault or violent threats toward others.\n\n (B) Embezzling or misdirecting Club funds, membership lists or other assets for\n\n activities not authorized by the responsible entity.\n\n (C) Use of slurs, epithets, threats, intimidations, negative stereotyping or other\n\n derogatory language regarding gender, race, ethnic or national origin, color,\n\n ancestry, medical condition, religion, age, sexual orientation, or physical or\n\n mental disability. Actions or behavior that denigrates, threatens, shows hostility\n\n or aversion towards, or seeks to exclude an individual or group from participation\n\n because of these characteristics.\n\n (D) Fraud, libel, defamation or illegal activity of any kind in the conduct of Club\n\n business.\n\n (E) Illegal or unethical professional conduct outside the Club if that misconduct\n\n could significantly damage the Club, its staff, its members or its assets.\n\n (F) Harassment, threats or any action directed toward Club employees that violate\n\n Club employment policies or are covered by law.\n\n (c) Dealing with Disruptive Personal Behavior\n\n (i) The chair of the relevant Club entity has an obligation to deal quickly and\n\n decisively with violations of the affirmative standards of conduct or actions\n\n constituting misconduct. All disputes over personal behavior that may violate the\n\n affirmative standards of conduct or may constitute misconduct should be resolved\n\n at the most local level, and informally whenever possible. Disputes over personal\n\n behavior may also warrant the removal, suspension or barring the member from\n\n\n\n leadership positions or participation in certain activities.\n\n (ii) Formal actions under Standing Rule 5.10.2 can be taken to remove, suspend or\n\n bar members from leadership positions (except members of the Board of\n\n Directors) or participation in certain activities.\n\n (iii) Immediate Suspension\n\n A. The Executive Director, Board President, and the Chair of the Board Volunteer\n\n Leadership Advisory Committee, or their acting designee, together have authority\n\n to immediately suspend a member from leadership positions (except members of\n\n the Board of Directors) or from participation in specific Club activities for\n\n misconduct. Any Club member who believes that a member has engaged in\n\n misconduct can make a written request to the Club\u2019s Executive Office for the\n\n immediate suspension of that member from a leadership position (excepting\n\n members of the Board of Directors) or from participation in specific Club\n\n activities.\n\n 8\n\n B. Any action to immediately suspend a member for misconduct must be based on\n\n a fair assessment (clear documentation, multiple reports, direct communication\n\n with those involved) that creates strong reason to believe that misconduct\n\n occurred.\n\n C. In cases of the immediate suspension of elected leaders, the process for\n\n Termination of Membership or Suspension of Member Privileges (Standing Rule\n\n 5.10.2), or the process for resolving conflicts between volunteers and staff must\n\n be used to determine whether the suspension should be reversed, extended for a\n\n specific period of time, or made permanent. One of these processes must be\n\n\n\n initiated within three weeks of a suspension.\n\n (d) Resolving Disputes\n\n (i) Policy Disputes. When there is a dispute regarding interpretation, application\n\n or disregard for Club Bylaws, these Standing Rules, policies, guidelines or other\n\n governing procedures, leaders should seek clarification from the relevant staff\n\n entity, for referral or appeal if necessary to the appropriate Board Advisory\n\n Committee or the Executive Committee. No leader should act in violation of a\n\n policy interpretation that has been provided by the appropriate staff entity. If the\n\n leader believes the interpretation is incorrect, he or she should appeal or seek\n\n clarification from the appropriate Board Advisory Committee or the Executive\n\n Committee, but shall not act in violation of the interpretation the leader has\n\n received.\n\n (ii) Decision-Making Disputes\n\n (A) All Club leaders involved in a contentious decision-making process are\n\n nevertheless expected to behave according to these Standards of Conduct. This\n\n includes decisions regarding priorities for action, strategies and tactics, and the\n\n allocation of resources where differences of opinion can be heated.\n\n (B) All disputes among volunteers should be resolved at the most local level\n\n possible. If these disputes cannot be resolved locally, the Office of Volunteer and\n\n Activist Services shall provide assistance in resolving disputes.\n\n (e) Authority is delegated to the Board Volunteer Leadership Advisory\n\n Committee to develop and adapt, as needed, guidelines for resolving disputes over\n\n these Standards of Conduct.\n\n (f) Board Discretion. These procedures shall not deprive the Board, at any point\n\n\n\n in the process, from taking such actions as it may deem necessary or advisable for\n\n the best interests of the Club.\n\n Earlier version adopted as a policy 03/17-18/90; this version adopted as a\n\n SR 11/15-16/02; amended 09/10-11/04, 05/19-20/06, 02/24/07, 05/16/08,\n\n 11/20/10\n\n 9\n\n SR. 2.2.7: Sexual Harassment\n\n (a) Sexual harassment of Club employees or in Club workplaces is prohibited as\n\n provided by law and as governed by Club employment policies and contracts.\n\n Any complaints or concerns about sexual harassment of Club staff, or in Club\n\n offices, should be reported to a staff supervisor and to the Director of Human\n\n Resources.\n\n (b) Sexual harassment of Club members, volunteers or others who participate in\n\n Club-sponsored activities is also prohibited.

(i) Candidates for Director shall be provided reasonable\n\n opportunity to solicit votes and promote their views, and members shall have\n\n reasonable opportunity to exchange views freely.\n\n (ii) As used in this Standing Rule, \u201cClub entity(ies)\u201d means any chapter, group,\n\n section, committee or other body operating under the authority of the Board, but\n\n not the Board itself.\n\n (iii) Without authorization of the Board by resolution or except as provided in the\n\n Bylaws and these Standing Rules, no Club funds or other resources, including those\n\n of Club entities, shall be used to support or oppose any candidate for Director,\n\n including activities related to circulation of petitions. Resources include official\n\n publications and other forums, such as newsletters and web pages, but do not include\n\n the Club President, even if he or she receives a stipend.\n\n\n\n (iv) Any Club entity may expend Club funds to carry out its designated duties in\n\n connection with the election. Any Club entity may expend Club funds to publicize\n\n the election, its timing, or to urge members to exercise their right to vote, or to\n\n inform members about the election procedures and rules, but no expenditure made\n\n under this subsection shall mention or provide support for or opposition to any\n\n candidate or group of candidates in the election.\n\n (b) Candidate Statements. (i) A statement from each nominee shall be distributed\n\n with the ballot mailed to each Regular or Life member. Statements and\n\n photographs, if they are to be included in the ballot materials, shall be delivered to\n\n the Club\u2019s Executive Office by noon Pacific time on a date set by the Nominating\n\n Committee, not more than two weeks after the close of nominations.\n\n (ii) The Nominating Committee shall prescribe the form of the statements, including\n\n the number of words and of paragraphs or indentations, the use of bullets or other\n\n printer\u2019s marks and specific information (for example, length of membership, offices\n\n held and other experience in the Club) that the committee may require of all\n\n 19\n\n candidates. Candidates must submit with their statements evidence that each listed\n\n endorser has agreed to be so listed.\n\n (iii) Candidate statements shall be reviewed for length, form and significant errors of\n\n fact about the Club by a Ballot Statement Review Committee. The committee shall\n\n consist of three Club members who are neither Directors, candidates for Director,\n\n nor members of the Nominating Committee, appointed annually and jointly by the\n\n Nominating Committee and Board of Directors or its Executive Committee. No\n\n change in a statement shall be made without the nominee\u2019s specific consent, except\n\n\n\n to conform to the prescribed format (no substantive wording changes) or to delete\n\n any words beyond the limit. If the candidate does not make the statement conform\n\n to the prescribed format and/or word limit within five days of a request, the\n\n committee shall change the statement to do so. If a candidate, on request of the\n\n committee, refuses to remove significant errors of fact (but not differences of\n\n opinion) about the Club or any candidate from the statement, the Secretary, at the\n\n request of the committee, shall cause a correction or note to be published in the\n\n ballot materials, subject to an appeal to the Inspectors. An asterisk or other mark in\n\n the candidate\u2019s statement may be included to make the correction clear.\n\n (iv) The introductory material that accompanies the candidates' statements for the\n\n election of Directors shall indicate whether the candidate was nominated by the\n\n Nominating Committee or by petition. There shall also be indication after each\n\n candidate's statement and/or under each candidate's photograph, as well as on the\n\n ballot, as to whether the candidate was nominated by the Nominating Committee\n\n or by petition.\n\n (c) Articles. (i) No articles or messages by or about individual candidates shall be\n\n published in SIERRA, Club newsletters, web pages, or other Club publications\n\n between the close of nominations and the date set for counting Club ballots, except\n\n (A) for routine articles or messages (defined below), or (B) if all candidates are\n\n given at least seven days written notice, through the Club\u2019s Executive Office, to\n\n submit an article or message of equal length to be published with equal prominence\n\n in the same publication.\n\n (ii) An article or message is \"about\" a nominee or petition candidate if it either\n\n\n\n mentions the fact that the member is a candidate or has as its principal focus the\n\n candidate, as opposed to an incidental reference. An article or message is not \u201cabout\n\n a candidate\u201d if it merely discusses the Club\u2019s elections, the functioning of the Board,\n\n or issues presented by the election without mentioning the names of any individual\n\n candidate or expressly advocating that members vote for or against any identifiable\n\n subset of candidates. An article or message is \"routine\" if it (A) does not mention\n\n the fact that the author or subject is a candidate, (B) does not mention the election,\n\n (C) relates to the candidate\u2019s performance of duties in an elected or appointed Club\n\n capacity, (D) is timely for Club purposes, and (E) is sent or published only to\n\n members who would normally receive similar articles or messages. Periodic reports\n\n 20\n\n by the Club President to leaders and activists are routine even if the President is a\n\n candidate for reelection, so long as these reports do not mention the Club election.\n\n (iii) During the nominating and election process, the Nominating Committee, in\n\n cooperation with the Chief Inspector of the Election, shall distribute to\n\n appropriate chapter and group leaders and editors memos in which the following\n\n matters are discussed:\n\n (A) the nature of the nominating process and the criteria used;\n\n (B) the availability of the petition process and a description of the procedures;\n\n (C) a statement of this Standing Rule on Promotion of Candidates;\n\n (D) a plea for orderly process in elections, asking that members vote for the\n\n candidates that in their opinion would best serve the overall interests of the Club\n\n and its members.\n\n\n\n The Secretary is authorized to include items (A) and (D), above, in an\n\n introduction to the candidates\u2019 statements distributed with the ballot, so long as no\n\n reference is made to any individual candidate or groups of candidates other than\n\n all candidates nominated by the Nominating Committee as a class. If any issues\n\n are also on the ballot, these materials should cover the rules about electioneering\n\n about them as well (SR. 11.2.2).\n\n (d) Advertising. No Club publication, including chapter and group newsletters, web\n\n pages and electronic bulletin board systems, shall carry advertising for or against a\n\n candidate.\n\n (e) Forums & Discussion Lists. (i) The Club may have a forum for Director\n\n candidates to answer questions selected by a Forum Questions Committee\n\n appointed by the Volunteer Leadership Advisory Committee. This committee shall\n\n consist of three representatives of the Council of Club Leaders and three other\n\n members. Germane discussion of Board candidates (for example, discussing\n\n forestry aspects of a candidacy on a forestry list) may take place on any other Club\n\n discussion list, subject to the usual rules of the list and unless barred by the\n\n sponsor/owner of the list. The rules may limit the length and frequency of messages\n\n from a discussant. The poster of a message about a candidate shall send a copy of\n\n the message to the candidate.\n\n (ii) Under the rules issued by Inspectors of the Election, the Club may have a\n\n Club-sponsored election information website to provide links to election-related\n\n sites of the candidates\u2019 choosing.\n\n (f) Meetings. Candidates or their proxies may speak to groups of Club members\n\n\n\n about their candidacy at regularly scheduled meetings and outings as long as no\n\n additional Club funds are spent. Candidates or proxies who travel to meetings at\n\n Club expense may not discuss their candidacy on the floor of the meeting other than\n\n a brief announcement that the member is a candidate. Club entities may hold\n\n scheduled candidate forums provided that all candidates are given adequate notice\n\n and an opportunity to participate.\n\n 21\n\n (g) Chapter Endorsements. Chapters, but not groups or other Club entities, may\n\n vote to recommend one or more candidates in the election to the Board. Such a\n\n chapter recommendation must be adopted in a regular or special meeting by a\n\n two-thirds majority of the number of executive committee members of the chapter\n\n then in office. All candidates shall be given reasonable notice of any meeting at\n\n which such a recommendation is to be considered and provided an opportunity to\n\n make written materials relevant to their candidacy available at the meeting, at no\n\n cost to the chapter, for consideration by the executive committee. Chapters and\n\n groups may expend Club funds to communicate such a recommendation by the\n\n publication of the following statement in the newsletters and websites of the\n\n chapter and its own groups. \u201cThe [insert chapter name] recommends a vote for\n\n [insert names of supported candidates] in the upcoming election for the Sierra\n\n Club\u2019s Board of Directors.\u201d\n\n (h) Mailings. (i) A member\u2019s request for access to the membership list to\n\n communicate with other Club members about candidates in a Club election is a\n\n\n\n purpose reasonably related to that member\u2019s interest as a Club member. [see SR\n\n 4.1.2]. A copy of such communication and a description of the members to which\n\n it was sent must be sent to each candidate in the election and to the Executive\n\n Office at the time it is first sent to Club members.\n\n (ii) The Executive Office will notify all candidates in the Club election of\n\n requests when all required information and fees are received (\u201cValid Requests\u201d).\n\n Valid Requests for access to the membership list to communicate about\n\n candidates in a Club election must be received at least 40 days before the date set\n\n for counting the ballots in that Club election. If any such Valid Request is\n\n received, other such Valid Requests may be made until 30 days before the date set\n\n for counting ballots in that same Club election.\n\n (iii) A Club member in good standing may use published Club lists, including the\n\n Leader Directory, to communicate with Club leaders about Club elections.\n\n However, e-mail addresses and telephone numbers from the Leader Directory\n\n may not be used by a Club member for fundraising of any kind.\n\n (i) Candidate Websites. Individual candidates or groups of candidates may have\n\n their own promotional websites. To avoid any misunderstanding, the opening\n\n page of any such site must say \u201cThis site is not sponsored or supported by the\n\n Sierra Club.\u201d\n\n (j) Records and Reporting. (i) For six months after the election, candidates shall\n\n keep records of (A) contributions aggregating $100 or more from one person\n\n\n\n (including such contributions from the candidate), which records shall include the\n\n identity (name, address and telephone number) of the contributor, date, amount of\n\n contribution, and aggregate number of that person's contributions, and (B)\n\n expenditures of $100 or more, including recipient, amount, date and purpose.\n\n 22\n\n (ii) Each candidate shall report this information to the Inspectors of Election and\n\n to the Executive Office (A) 40 days before the date set for the counting the ballots\n\n and (B) within five days of receipt of a request for the information from the\n\n Inspectors of Election or the Executive Office. The reports shall be available for\n\n inspection and copying by any member.\n\n Adopted 09/10-11/83; amended 09/13-14/86, 11/11-12/89, 09/18-19/93,\n\n 09/24-25/94, 11/18-19/95, 09/21-22/96, 11/15-16/97, 09/26-27/98,\n\n 11/14-15/98, 11/13-14/99, 11/16-18/01, 09/19-20/03, 11/19-20/04,\n\n 07/16/05, 11/19-20/05, 05/19-20/06, 11/19/06, 02/24/07, 09/29/07,\n\n 05/16/08, 10/16/08, 09/25/10, 10/20/11\n\n SR. 5.6.2: Complaints, Appeals, Remedies & Sanctions\n\n (a) Complaints. Once the election process has begun, any Club member may\n\n complain to the Inspectors of Election about a violation of these Standing Rules, the\n\n Bylaws or applicable law governing the conduct of the Club\u2019s annual election by\n\n any person or entity, or the Inspectors may consider a potential violation on their\n\n own. The election process will begin at the following time (i) for elections to the\n\n Board, when the Nominating Committee has made its report to the Board, or when a\n\n petitioner for Director has notified the Secretary of an intention to circulate petitions,\n\n whichever occurs sooner; or (ii) for ballot issues when the Secretary has approved a\n\n resolution and petition for circulation. To guarantee review, a complaint must be\n\n\n\n received within 10 days of an alleged violation, but the Inspectors may entertain a\n\n complaint made later. Except for complaints received within five days of an alleged\n\n violation or about the vote counting process, no new complaints will be considered if\n\n made later than five days after the date set for counting the ballots.

Decisions shall\n\n be based on the Club\u2019s Bylaws and Standing Rules, in conformance with California\n\n law, to ensure a fair election.\n\n (b) Remedies and Sanctions. The Inspectors may take such action as may be proper\n\n to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all members, including, but not\n\n limited to requiring a Club entity or member to remedy any violation through (i) an\n\n expenditure to remedy the violation or (ii) repayment to the Club of the value of any\n\n resources used.\n\n (c) Content and Availability of Rulings\n\n (i) Written rulings of the Inspectors on complaints must state the reason(s) for the\n\n ruling, including summaries of written documents relied on by the Inspectors to\n\n support the ruling.

A party aggrieved by any decision of the Inspectors may appeal to the Board by\n\n filing a written statement setting forth the basis of the appeal delivered by ordinary\n\n mail, email, or fax transmission to the Secretary in care of the Executive Office, with\n\n a copy to the Inspectors, within five days of notice from the Inspectors to the\n\n complainant of the Inspectors\u2019 decision, or afterwards if good cause for the delay is\n\n shown.

Board decisions on appeals will be transmitted in writing to the appellant\n\n and the Inspectors by the Secretary as soon as practicable.\n\n (ii) If the Board entertains an appeal and finds that the Inspectors have erred as to\n\n the meaning of the Bylaws or Standing Rules, the Board shall state the proper\n\n meaning and remand the ruling to the Inspectors for reconsideration. If the Board\n\n entertains an appeal and finds credible and sufficient evidence that the Inspectors\n\n have erred as to a material fact supporting the ruling, the Board shall remand the\n\n ruling to the Inspectors for further investigation and reconsideration. If the Board\n\n entertains an appeal and finds that the Inspectors have not so erred, it shall affirm\n\n the ruling.\n\n (iii) If a Director is alleged to have committed an election violation, the Director\n\n may remain present during the deliberations and the vote on an appeal from a\n\n ruling of the Inspectors about the alleged violation, but the Director shall not vote\n\n on whether to entertain the appeal or on its merits. Directors also shall not vote\n\n on an appeal involving a transaction between the Director and the Club in which\n\n the Director has a material financial interest.

Unless an appeal of a decision made by the Inspectors\n\n is pending before the Board, the Inspectors may certify the election results and\n\n officially report them to the Secretary at the end of the fifth day after the date set for\n\n counting of the ballots. If an appeal of a decision made by the Inspectors is pending\n\n before the Board, the Inspectors may certify the election results and officially report\n\n them to the Secretary promptly after the Board declines to hear the appeal or the\n\n Board decides the appeal, or at the end of the twentieth day after the date set for\n\n counting of the ballots.\n\n Adopted 11/18-19/95, 11/14-15/98, 09/19-20/03, 11/19-20/04\n\n 05/19-20/06\n\n 24\n\n 5.7.

To assist in fulfilling this obligation, the\n\n Board delegates the authority for termination of Club membership or suspension of\n\n 25\n\n member privileges, including the privilege of serving in elected or appointed Club\n\n leadership positions, to the Executive Director, Club President, and chair of the Board\n\n Volunteer Leadership Advisory Committee. This delegation does not impair the\n\n authority of the Board or any Club officer to take action required in an emergency or\n\n by law.\n\n (b) Any Club member may request to terminate a membership or suspend a member\u2019s\n\n privileges by submitting such a request to the Club\u2019s Executive Office. The reason\n\n for such a request must be that the actions of the member:\n\n (i) constitute Misconduct as defined by Standing Rule 2.2.6;\n\n (ii) constitute Sexual Harassment as defined by Standing Rule 2.2.7;\n\n (iii) significantly undermine the work of volunteers or staff by repeatedly creating a\n\n public misimpression about the Club, its positions or policies;\n\n (iv) are repeatedly hostile or harassing of others - in meetings, at Club activities or\n\n offices, or in public venues - so that others become fearful, apprehensive, or reluctant\n\n or unwilling to participate in Club activities with that member; or,\n\n (v) have significantly disrupted or impaired the work of the Club, or will significantly\n\n disrupt or impair it if the actions continue.\n\n\n\n The request should include a description of the ways in which the Club is, or may be\n\n harmed by the actions of the member; contact information for individuals who have\n\n been affected by the actions of the member and who have information relevant to the\n\n request; and a statement, if applicable, describing prior efforts to resolve these\n\n concerns.\n\n (c) Upon receipt of a request, the Executive Director, President and chair of the Board\n\n Volunteer Leadership Advisory Committee have the discretion to determine that the\n\n request appears to be premature, of an insignificant nature, merely a personal\n\n grievance, or possessing some other circumstance that should be dealt with more\n\n appropriately by other means. They shall not be obligated to take any further action\n\n on such requests other than to inform those who have requested such action of that\n\n determination.\n\n (d) (i) If the Executive Director, President and Board Volunteer Leadership Advisory\n\n Committee chair determine the request may warrant action, they will inform the\n\n member and those who have requested the investigation of that determination. The\n\n Executive Director, working with staff, shall then conduct an investigation, including\n\n contact with the member who is the subject of the request and with others who have\n\n knowledge about the situation. The results of that investigation must be presented by\n\n staff to the Executive Director, the President and chair of the Board Volunteer\n\n Leadership Advisory Committee (\u201cPanel\u201d) and they must reach consensus on\n\n appropriate action, if any.\n\n (ii) If they agree to take action, they will notify the member in writing of this\n\n decision, the reasons for it, and the effective date of the action. The action will\n\n become effective 15 days after notice is given by registered mail, or other method\n\n reasonably calculated to provide actual notice, sent to the last address of the member\n\n\n\n shown on the Club\u2019s records. Copies of this notice must be sent to the chair of the\n\n 26\n\n member's chapter and group, to the leader, member or entity initiating the request, the\n\n chairs of any other affected entities, if known, and to the Board. This notice shall\n\n inform the member that the termination of membership or suspension of member\n\n privileges may be appealed in writing to the Volunteer Leadership Advisory\n\n Committee, c/o Sierra Club Executive Office, 85 Second Street, 2nd Floor, San\n\n Francisco CA 94105, sent not less than 5 days before the effective date of the\n\n decision.\n\n (e) The Volunteer Leadership Advisory Committee to shall review all timely appeals\n\n from members and decide whether to overturn the Panel\u2019s decision or let it stand.\n\n Pending review of such an appeal, suspension of member privileges becomes\n\n effective as per the notice; termination of membership only upon Volunteer\n\n Leadership Advisory Committee action to let the decision stand.\n\n (f) This rule, and the rules cited herein, apply to Directors only to the extent allowed\n\n by law and the Club\u2019s Articles and Bylaws, including Bylaw 5.10.\n\n Adopted as a policy 03/1-2/97; amended and adopted as a Standing Rule\n\n 10/15-16/97; amended 11/16-18/01; amended 02/22/03. 05/20-21/05,\n\n 05/19-20/06, 06/15/06, 02/24/07, 05/16/08, 11/20/10\n\n Bylaw 5 (cont.)\n\n Section 3: Meetings\n\n 5.11.

Existing policy, programs or priorities that would\n\n be changed by a resolution shall be stated or summarized in the petition, to show the\n\n change. Petitions must use the signature forms created by the Executive Office or\n\n full-sized copies thereof. The back of the petition may be used for additional\n\n background material, and the bottom may specify mailing directly to the\n\n Executive Office or some other place.\n\n (d) Petitioners.

If more than one alternative to existing\n\n policy is proposed, members shall be given a choice among them and a \"none-ofthe-\n\n above\" option. The ballot shall state that this option would preserve existing\n\n policy. Any ballot issue must receive a majority of the votes cast to prevail,\n\n provided that a quorum votes on the issue. The ballot pamphlet and ballot itself\n\n shall make clear the recommendation of the Board, if any is made, on any ballot\n\n measure.\n\n Adopted 12/10-11/94; amended 11/14-15/98, 11/16-18/01, 05/19-20/06,\n\n 02/24/07, 02/27/10\n\n SR. 11.2.3: Complaints, Appeals, Remedies & Sanctions: The provisions of\n\n Standing Rule 5.6.2 apply to ballot issues.\n\n Adopted 11/14-15/98, 05/19-20/06\n\n 11.3.

A written petition submitting a resolution must be\n\n 36\n\n delivered to the principal office of the Club by the date set by the Board of Directors\n\n in order for it to be qualified for presentation on the annual ballot. The ballot shall\n\n be printed so as to enable the members to express approval or disapproval of each\n\n resolution. The mailing of the ballot and the counting of the votes shall be\n\n conducted in the same manner as for the election of Directors (Bylaw 5, Section 2).\n\n The ballot shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth arguments for and\n\n against the question and stating the number of approvals necessary to pass the\n\n\n\n measure submitted. [5513]\n\n SR. 11.3.1: Promotion of Positions on Ballot Issues\n\n (a) Ballot Statements\n\n (i) Coordinators.

The petitioners\n\n shall designate, in writing (by letter, fax or e-mail) to the Secretary in care of the\n\n Executive Office, a position coordinator to be responsible for overseeing the\n\n preparation and submission of the statement in favor of the ballot issue. To identify\n\n position coordinators for any other required opposing or supporting statements, the\n\n Secretary shall consult with potential opponents or supporters of the ballot issue and\n\n designate position coordinators to be responsible for overseeing the preparation and\n\n submission of these statements. No coordinator shall be a candidate for the Board in\n\n the same election. If no statement supporting or opposing a ballot question is\n\n received by the deadline provided in these rules, the Secretary shall inform the\n\n Chief Inspector of Election and President, and then the President, or the\n\n President\u2019s delegee, will prepare a statement that provides a summary of\n\n arguments supporting or opposing the question, identifies the preparer, and\n\n indicates that no other statement was received.\n\n (ii) Requirements.\n\n (A) Each position statement, pro and con, shall have a maximum of 400 words,\n\n including the names and affiliations of the signers. Coordinators must submit with\n\n all statements evidence that any listed endorsers have agreed to be so listed. No\n\n candidate for Director shall be shown as a signer of this or of either of the statements\n\n provided for in subsection (b) of this Standing Rule.\n\n (B) The Secretary shall prescribe the form of the statements, considering such issues\n\n\n\n of form as are set forth in subsection (b) of Standing Rule 5.6.1. The Secretary shall\n\n review each statement for form and significant errors of fact about the Club or the\n\n resolution. No change in a statement shall be made without the coordinator\u2019s\n\n specific consent, except to conform to the prescribed format (no substantive wording\n\n changes) or to delete any words beyond the limit. If the coordinator does not make\n\n the statement conform to the prescribed format and/or word limit within five days of\n\n a request, the Secretary shall change the statement to do so. If a coordinator refuses\n\n to remove significant errors of fact (but not differences of opinion) about the Club or\n\n 37\n\n the resolution, the Secretary shall cause a correction to be published in the ballot\n\n materials, with an asterisk or other mark in the position statement as may be\n\n necessary to make the correction clear.\n\n (C) Deadline. The deadline for receipt of statements for or against ballot issues at\n\n the Club Executive Office in original, facsimile or e-mail shall be noon Pacific\n\n time on the last business day on or before the Friday after the last regular meeting\n\n of the Board before the close of nominations, unless the Board has put an\n\n alternative question on the same subject on the ballot, in which case the deadline\n\n shall be noon Pacific time on the last business day on or before the fourth Friday\n\n after this meeting. If a ballot question is initiated by the Board at its last regular\n\n meeting before the close of nominations, the deadline for receipt of statements for\n\n or against it is noon Pacific time on the third Friday following that Board meeting.\n\n (b) Promotion of Positions (Electioneering)\n\n (i) SIERRA Statements. If time and space permit, the promoters of each position\n\n\n\n shall be allocated equal space in an issue of SIERRA that is distributed in advance\n\n of the election to expand the arguments presented in the ballot statements. The\n\n names and principal identifications of the signers of the statement shall be\n\n included in the space allotment. Excepting questions of legality (libel, fraud,\n\n etc.), SIERRA shall not exercise editorial control over the material submitted. The\n\n Executive Director shall determine the appropriateness of timing and amount of\n\n space available. Due to time and space limitations, there shall be no exchange of\n\n statements and no rebuttals of the opposing statement except as arranged by the\n\n two coordinators between themselves.\n\n (ii) Statements for Newsletters. Additional statements of no more than 750 words,\n\n including the names and principal identifications of the signers, expanding on the\n\n ballot statements may be submitted to the Executive Office in original, facsimile, or\n\n e-mail by noon Pacific time on the last business day on or before the third Friday\n\n after the last regular meeting of the Board before the closing date for nominations,\n\n unless the Board has put an alternative question on the same subject on the ballot, in\n\n which case the deadline shall be noon Pacific time on the last business day on or\n\n before the fifth Friday after this meeting.\n\n (A) These statements shall be distributed to the editors of all Club newsletters of\n\n record in the volunteer leadership file. Due to time and space limitations, there shall\n\n be no exchange of statements and no rebuttals of the opposing statement except as\n\n arranged by the position coordinators.\n\n (B) Newsletters and other Club publications, including web pages, may publish\n\n these or any other official statements, including the SIERRA statements, if they\n\n publish the statements on both sides. They may also publish matched opinion pieces\n\n\n\n on both sides of approximately equal length written for this purpose, by their local\n\n members or by others.\n\n 38\n\n (iii) Editorial Positions. Editorial positions taken in chapter and group newsletters\n\n on ballot questions must represent the position of the respective chapter or group\n\n executive committee as adopted in a regular or special meeting.\n\n (iv) Letters to the Editor. Letters to the editor on ballot questions, if any are\n\n published, shall, as a whole, reflect a balance of positions on the issue insofar as\n\n possible. Letters must be signed.\n\n (v) Advertising. No advertising may be accepted promoting a position on a ballot\n\n issue in a Club newsletter.\n\n (vi) Web Page Links. Any mention in a Club publication, including a web page, of,\n\n or link to, a web page formally designated by one side of a ballot issue must be\n\n matched by a corresponding mention of or link to a page designated by the other\n\n side of a ballot issue, unless the other side has not responded with a web page\n\n address to a request for it from the publisher of the reference or the Club Secretary or\n\n webmaster.\n\n (vii) Use of Club Resources. Without authorization of the Board of Directors, no\n\n Club funds or other resources, such as official publications and other forums or\n\n means of communication, including newsletters and web pages, and including those\n\n of chapters, groups and other entities, shall be used in support of or opposition to any\n\n ballot issue, unless both sides have the same opportunity.\n\n (viii) Mailing Lists.\n\n\n\n (A) A member\u2019s request for access to the membership list to communicate with\n\n other Club members about a ballot issue in a Club election is a purpose\n\n reasonably related to that member\u2019s interest as a Club member.\n\n (B) The Executive Office will notify the position coordinators in the Club election\n\n of requests when all required information and fees are received (\u201cValid\n\n Requests\u201d). Valid Requests for access to the membership list to communicate\n\n about a ballot issue in a Club election must be received at least 40 days before the\n\n date set for counting the ballots in that Club election. If any such Valid Request\n\n is received, other such Valid Requests may be made until 30 days before the date\n\n set for counting ballots in that same Club election.\n\n (C) Leader Directory. A Club member in good standing may use published Club\n\n lists, including the Leader Directory, to communicate with Club leaders about\n\n Club elections. However, e-mail addresses and telephone numbers from the\n\n Leader Directory may not be used by a Club member for fundraising of any kind.\n\n 39\n\n (ix) Forum.\n\n (A) Under rules issued by the Inspectors of the Election, the Club may have a forum\n\n for discussion of each ballot issue or each set of alternative ballot issues. The rules\n\n may limit the length and frequency of messages from a discussant.\n\n (B) The Inspectors of the Election may issue rules for a ballot question\n\n information website to provide links to election-related sites of the position\n\n\n\n coordinators\u2019 choosing.\n\n (x) Records and Reporting.\n\n (A) For six months after the election, petitioners and position coordinators shall keep\n\n records of contributions aggregating $100 or more from one person, including\n\n identity (name, address and telephone number) of the contributor, date, amount of\n\n contribution and aggregate amount of that person\u2019s contributions; and expenditures\n\n over $100, including recipient, amount, date and purpose. A coordinator shall\n\n provide this information to the Inspectors of election within (1) five days of receipt\n\n of a request for the information by e-mail, fax or delivery (add three days for mail)\n\n within 60 days before or 30 days after the date set for counting the ballots; or (2) 10\n\n days at other times.\n\n (B) Coordinators shall report the aggregate amount of contributions and\n\n expenditures 45 days before the date set for counting the ballots and 15 days after\n\n that date. Individual contributions and expenditures of $100 or more, including the\n\n identity of the contributor or recipient, shall be reported to the Executive Office\n\n within 10 days of receipt and within 15 days before the date set for counting the\n\n ballots. The reports shall be available for inspection and copying by any member.\n\n Adopted 05/2-3/81 & 09/13-14/86; amended 09/20-21/97, 09/26-27/98,\n\n 11/14-15/98, 11/13-14/99, 11/16-18/01, 09/19-20/03, 11/19-20/04,\n\n 07/16/05, 05/19-20/06, 05/16/08\n\n 11.4. A majority of all the ballots cast on each question shall decide the question\n\n except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws, provided that such votes represent at\n\n least a majority of the votes required for a quorum. [5512, 5513]\n\n Bylaw 12: CONSTRUCTION OF BYLAWS\n\n 12.1. On all questions as to the construction or meaning of these Bylaws and the\n\n\n\n rules of the Club, the decision of the Board of Directors shall be final, unless\n\n rescinded by the Club by a vote as provided for in Bylaw 11.\n\n Bylaw 13: AMENDMENTS TO BYLAWS\n\n 13.1. These Bylaws are fundamental and shall not be added to, amended, or\n\n repealed except by a resolution approved by the Board of Directors and approved\n\n 40\n\n by the affirmative votes of two-thirds (2/3) of the members voting on a given matter\n\n or group of related matters as specified in Paragraph 11.3, provided that such\n\n affirmative votes represent at least two-thirds (2/3) of the votes required for a\n\n quorum. The approval of the members may be before or after the approval by the\n\n Board. When permitted by law, however, the Board may, by affirmative vote of\n\n two-thirds (2/3) of the Directors and with the concurrence of the Sierra Club\n\n Council, amend the Bylaws to conform to law.
