{"title": "Obama administration goes for integration over deportation for illegal immigrants; DHS has taken steps to ensure that the majority of America's 11.3\u00a0million undocumented immigrants can stay.", "body": "\nThe Obama administration has begun a profound shift in its enforcement of the nation's immigration laws, aiming to \nhasten the integration of long-term illegal immigrants into society rather than targeting them for deportation, \naccording to documents and federal officials.\n\n In recent months, the Department of Homeland Security has taken steps to ensure that the majority of America's \n11.3 million undocumented immigrants can stay in this country, with agents narrowing enforcement efforts to three \ngroups of illegal migrants: convicted criminals, terrorism threats or those who recently crossed the border.\n\nWhile public attention has been focused on the court fight over President Obama's highly publicized executive \naction on immigration, DHS has with little fanfare been training thousands of immigration agents nationwide to carry \nout new policies on everyday enforcement.\n\nThe legal battle centers on the constitutionality of a program that would officially shield up to 5 million eligible illegal \nimmigrants from deportation, mainly parents of children who are U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents. A \nfederal judge put the program, known by the acronym DAPA, on hold in February after 26 states sued. \n\nBut the shift in DHS's enforcement priorities, which are separate from the DAPA program and have not been \nchallenged in court, could prove even more far-reaching.\n\nThe new policies direct agents to focus on the three priority groups and leave virtually everyone else alone. \nDemographic data shows that the typical undocumented immigrant has lived in the United States for a decade or \nmore and has established strong community ties.\n\nWhile the new measures do not grant illegal immigrants a path to citizenship, their day-to-day lives could be \nchanged in countless ways. Now, for instance, undocumented migrants say they are so afraid to interact with \npolice, for fear of being deported, that they won't report crimes and often limit their driving to avoid possible traffic \nstops. The new policies, if carried out on the ground, could dispel such fears, advocates for immigrants say.\n\nIn describing the initiatives, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has echoed the language often used by \nadvocates of comprehensive immigration reform, which remains stalled on Capitol Hill. \n\n\"We are making it clear that we should not expend our limited resources on deporting those who have been here \nfor years, have committed no serious crimes, and have, in effect, become integrated members of our society,'' \n\n\nJohnson said in a recent speech in Houston. He added, \"These people are here, they live among us, and they are \nnot going away.\"\n\nSince the new policies took effect in January, Johnson's instructions have been conveyed to agents throughout the \ndepartment. \"We decided we're going to draw a clear line between individuals who now have significant equities in \nthe country versus those who are recent entrants,'' said one department official, who spoke on condition of \nanonymity to describe internal deliberations.\n\n\"If people are not an enforcement priority,'' the official said, \" . . . bottom line, the secretary has said don't go after \nthem.''\n\nAmerica's massive dragnet is shrinking rapidly, both because of the new enforcement policies and declining flows \nof new immigrants crossing the southwest border, DHS officials say.\n\nDeportations, for example, are dropping. The Obama administration is on pace to remove 229,000 people from the \ncountry this year, a 27 percent fall from last year and nearly 50 percent less than the all-time high in 2012.\n\nFewer people are also in the pipeline for deportation. The number of occupied beds at immigration detention \nfacilities, which house people arrested for immigration violations, have dropped nearly 20 percent this year. \n\nAnd on Johnson's orders, officials are reviewing the entire immigrant detainee population - and each of the \n400,000 cases in the nation's clogged immigration courts - to weed out those who don't meet the new priorities. \nAbout 3,000 people have been released from custody or had their immigration cases dropped, DHS officials said. \n\n\"It does have the potential to be extremely significant. It would allow people to live without that noose over their \nheads of the threat of deportation at all times,'' said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National \nImmigration Law Center, referring to the policy shift.\n\nBut Hincapie and other advocates - who have long clashed with the administration over its aggressive enforcement \n- said there is widespread skepticism in the immigrant community about whether agents on the ground will adjust \ntheir activities to match the new priorities.\n\n\"It all sounds great, but it means nothing if it's not applied,'' said Kica Matos, director of human rights and racial \njustice at the Washington-based Center for Community Change. She faulted U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (ICE), part of DHS, for what she said has been a series of broken promises to more humanely enforce \nimmigration laws.\n\n\"DHS is an agency that has terrorized our community for a really long time,'' Matos said, \"so the level of distrust and \nfear is really big.''\n\nDuring Obama's first presidential campaign, he spoke of undocumented immigrants, telling CNN in March 2007: \n\"It's absolutely vital that we bring those families out of the shadows.''\n\nWhen his administration took power, the government was adding thousands of new agents hired at the end of \nPresident George W. Bush's term and as a result ramping up enforcement efforts. Under pressure from Obama's \nsupporters to end Bush's post-9/11 crackdown on illegal migrants, DHS tried to target these efforts.\n\n\"There were no comprehensive, written enforcement priorities,'' said John Sandweg, a top immigration adviser to \nthen-DHS secretary Janet Napolitano. \"Everyone in the country unlawfully was fair game.'' \n\nAt ICE, then-director John Morton put out two 2011 memos laying out the agency's priorities: protecting public \nsafety and national security and securing the border. In a move cheered by activists, Morton also said agents could \nexercise \"prosecutorial discretion\" and decide not to deport certain illegal immigrants taken into custody based on \nfactors such as their length of stay in the United States.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, DHS expanded a Bush administration program called Secure Communities. It allowed ICE to \nlodge official requests with local police departments that had arrested someone ICE wanted to deport. The \nrequests called on police to hold the immigrants for up to 48 hours after their scheduled release so ICE could pick \nthem up.\n\nAs Secure Communities took hold, deportations kept climbing, reaching an all-time-high of 409,000 in 2012. Even \nas Republicans blasted the administration for what they called lax enforcement, prominent Latino and other groups \nderided Obama as the \"deporter in chief.''\n\n\"There was a lot of big talk coming out of DHS, big promises that they were going to be more sensitive to \nimmigrant families, said Nick Katz, a staff attorney for Make the Road New York, an immigrant rights group. \"And \nthen it didn't make a fundamental impact on the ground.''\n\nSoon after Johnson took office in December 2013, he took on a presidential request. Obama - frustrated by the \nfailure months earlier of legislation that would have given undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship - tasked \nthe new DHS secretary with determining what the administration could do on its own.\n\nA former corporate lawyer and Pentagon general counsel, Johnson immersed himself in the legal details, reading \nthe 2011 ICE memos and earlier internal documents. He spotted what he considered some of the same flaws \nactivists had pointed out, DHS officials said.\n\nThe 2011 ICE memos, for example, had put a priority on deporting people who reentered the country illegally after \nbeing removed from the country before, even if the initial deportation was years earlier and they had since lived \nlaw-abiding lives in the United States. Long-term illegal immigrants with families and other community ties were \nbeing arrested - many under the Secure Communities program - for minor offenses and sent to ICE for \ndeportation.\n\n\"These individuals were being picked up based on that priority, nothing else was looked at, and they were removed \nfrom the country before they had their day in court,'' a second DHS official said.\n\nA rebellion was also brewing against Secure Communities, which had been billed as a way to crack down on \nimmigrants who had committed serious crimes. About 300 communities, including major cities such as Baltimore \nand Los Angles, ended or scaled back their participation.\n\n             \"In some ways, [Secure Communities] got away from itself,'' the second DHS official said.\n\nJohnson's answer was a pair of memos, released in November on the same day as Obama's much-publicized \nspeech about the new DAPA program.\n\nJohnson spelled out that immigrants could be deported only if they had been convicted of crimes, not just \narrested. And he specified that only people who had crossed the border since January 2014 could be deported \npurely for an immigration violation, not someone who had been deported years earlier, reentered the country and \nlived a law-abiding life.\n\nHe also did away with Secure Communities, replacing it with a new Priority Enforcement Program to begin later this \nsummer. Under this plan, ICE will still coordinate with local police about immigrants who are in custody but will ask \nto be notified 48 hours before the scheduled release of an immigrant who is targeted for deportation, rather than \nseeking to have immigrants held beyond their schedule release.\n\nImmigrant advocates expressed widespread skepticism about Johnson's changes, saying they fear that long-term \nimmigrants who are low-level offenders will still be targeted.\n\nBut Sandweg said they should keep an open mind. \"I think these new priorities are in-cred-ibly significant,'' he said. \n\"They will obviously have an impact on the lives of millions of people.''\n\n\n\njerry.markon@washpost.com\n"}
