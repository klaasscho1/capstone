{"title": "U.S. to recruit churches to aid immigrants", "body": "\nThe Bush administration plans to deepen its collaboration with religious groups by recruiting the Roman Catholic \nChurch and other organizations to help set up a mentoring program for new immigrants, a U.S. official said \nyesterday.\n\nThe program, to be launched on a pilot basis within six months, will pair new immigrants with host families that will \nhelp them better adapt.\n\nBut with funds in short supply to reach out to more than one million legal immigrants coming into the country each \nyear, the government plans to look to outside entities to help.\n\n\"Our resources are limited,\" said Alfonso Aguilar, chief of the Office of Citizenship, part of the U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services in the Homeland Security Department.\n\nThe groups, he said, will include religious ones \"like the Catholic Church, which has an extraordinary network of \nservices for immigrants.\"\n\nAbout one in five new immigrants are Mexican, a vast majority of them Catholics.\n\nThe administration wants religious charities that provide social services to compete for $28 billion in federal funds. \nSome opponents say that would be an unconstitutional violation of separation of church and state.\n\nProponents said the State Department already used religious groups to settle refugees.\n\nDaniel Kane, a spokesman for Citizenship and Immigration Services, said, \"It is important to note that faith-based \norganizations will be precluded from using any funding to promote religion.\"\n"}
