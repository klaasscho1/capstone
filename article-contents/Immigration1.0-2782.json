{"title": "Don't Surrender to Lower Housing Standard", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nBack off on enforcing New York City's housing codes: that's Peter D. Salins's answer to the miserable housing \nconditions of hundreds of thousands of impoverished immigrants (Op-Ed, Oct. 26). If his prescription sounds \nfamiliar, that's because it is like frequently heard advice to go along with sweatshops and minimum-wage violations, \nsince those are means of giving low-skilled immigrants a foothold and of preserving small businesses.\n\nBoth approaches involve public assent to the lowering of hard-won standards that are morally and economically \ncrucial. Better management of immigration itself, not surrender to third world working and housing standards, \nmust be this nation's response to the squalor that threatens low-income immigrants and natives alike.\n\n \n\nDAVID SIMCOX\n\nLouisville, Ky., Oct. 28, 1996\n\n \n\nThe writer is policy-board chairman of the Center for Immigration Studies.\n"}
