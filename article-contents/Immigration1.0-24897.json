Before 9am Heidi \nAlexander, the shadow health secretary, had released a resignation letter saying Mr Corbyn did not have \"the \ncapacity to shape the answers our country is demanding\".\n\nMr Benn explained his decision shortly afterwards, telling BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show: \"He's a good and \ndecent man but he is not a leader.\" By 9.30pm, 11 more ministers had resigned, with more expected overnight and \non Monday.\n\nBenn: 'I no longer have confidence' in Corbyn's leadershipPlay!00:23\n\nOne former member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet who resigned yesterday said the party needed an \"avowedly \npro-EU\" leader who could push to keep Britain as close to Europe as possible during exit negotiations.\n\n\n\nSources said that they expect a general election before the end of the year and that they want a leader in place who \nwill stand on a pro-EU manifesto.\n\n\"People have started to say that we can go into the next election as a avowedly pro-EU party,\" the former \nfrontbencher told The Telegraph.\n\n\"I would want someone who is very much-pro European, who has a vision for us being very much engaged in \nEurope, but addresses concerns that are clearly there such as immigration.\" \n\nCorbyn's shadow cabinet\n\nSources said that Mr Corbyn will refuse to step down and will instead try and make public a planned secret vote on \nhis future so that voters can see which MPs are trying to unseat him.\n\nLate on Sunday evening Mr Corbyn issued a bullish statement and vowed to continue as leader despite the \nresignations. He said: \"I am not going to betray the trust of those who voted for me - or the millions of supporters \nacross the country who need Labour to represent them.\n\n\"Those who want to change Labour's leadership will have to stand in a democratic election, in which I will be a \ncandidate.\n\n\"Over the next 24 hours I will reshape my shadow cabinet and announce a new leadership team to take forward \nLabour's campaign for a fairer Britain - and to get the best deal with Europe for our people.\"\n\nJeremy Corbyn avoids questions on whether he will step down as Labour leaderPlay!00:35\n\nIt is thought that the Parliamentary Labour Party is hoping to select a new leader who could seek to negotiate a new \nBritish-EU deal in conjunction with sympathetic European leaders and the heads of other British regions.\n\nTony Blair, the former Labour prime minister, said a second referendum on the UK's membership of the EU should \nnot be ruled out because Britain has become \"deeply divided\" after the vote. Across Europe, there are growing \nsigns that a new deal may ultimately offered.\n\nPeter Altmaier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's chief of staff, said that British politicians \"should have the \npossibility to reconsider the consequences of an exit\" as these begin to emerge.\n\nHe later clarified that the validity of the result was not in doubt and said \"we respect the decision of the British \npeople\".\n\nThe Czech government called for the removal of Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU President, following another day of \naggressive anti-British briefings from the European Commission.
