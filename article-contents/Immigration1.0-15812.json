It followed rulings by federal judges Friday in California, New York and Washington.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune reports that Cook County and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights sued to \nblock the new rules, claiming the public benefits rule \"would have imposed real and irreparable harm to Cook \nCounty and the people who call it home.\"\n\nKen Cuccinelli, acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, has expressed confidence that the \nadministration will eventually prevail.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Chicago Tribune, http://www.chicagotribune.com\n"}
