About 18,000 calls had been placed to the hotline.\n\nCitizenship Now was first offered in April, when more than 6,000 News readers got free legal advice in five days. \nMore than 120,000 calls were logged.\n\nThe phone lines, which are answered in English, Spanish and other languages, will remain open through Friday \nfrom 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.\n\nRep. Nydia Velazquez (D-Brooklyn) visited the call-in center at The News yesterday morning and answered some \ncalls. She said her office sees about 4,000 people a year who have immigration concerns.\n\n\"This is a tremendous effort that gives hope to immigrants who are here and sometimes get lost through the \nsystem,\" Velazquez said.\n\n"}
