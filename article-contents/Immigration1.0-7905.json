{"title": "The Raid in Miami: Reasonable, or Reckless? - Correction Appended", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nRe \"Cuban Boy Seized by U.S. Agents and Reunited With His Father\" (front page, April 23):\n\nI am breathing a sigh of relief knowing that Elian Gonzalez is in the hands of his father and not those self-absorbed \nMiami relatives. The longer they kept Elian from reuniting with his father, the more obvious it became that their \nactions were not for the welfare of the boy but for satisfying their own perverse sense of \"payback\" to Fidel Castro.\n\nI was shocked and saddened to learn that terrifying force was used to remove Elian from the home of his relatives, \nbut I blame the Lazaro Gonzalez family for that, and not Attorney General Janet Reno. The shame is on them for \nputting the boy at such a risk and introducing yet another trauma into his young life.\n\n \n\nPAMELA PERRY\n\nCambridge, Mass., April 23, 2000\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nCorrection\n\nA letter on Monday about Elian Gonzalez referred incorrectly to a legal aspect of the raid to seize him. The \ngovernment did indeed have a search warrant.\n\nCorrection-Date: April 26, 2000, Wednesday\n"}
