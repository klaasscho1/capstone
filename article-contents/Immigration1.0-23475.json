{"title": "Woven Into Our Midst", "body": "\nA Feb. 6 Metro article, \"Latino Groups Lobby for More Rights,\"  about activists urging the Virginia legislature to tone \ndown anti-immigrant legislation,  reported that a member of the Virginia Council for Immigration Reform  said that \nVirginia bills under consideration are not \"anti-immigrant\" but only anti-illegal immigrant. \n\n  The distinction he attempts to make is misleading. People working in this country without permission from the \nfederal government do not exist in isolation.  \n\n They are the husbands, wives, sons and daughters of legal immigrants and U.S. citizens. They are our friends, \nneighbors and co-workers. \n\n They attend our churches. They shop in our stores and sit next to us at Little League games. \n\n  The idea that illegal immigrants can be excised from our midst without hurting the remaining immigrant community \nor the community at large is simply false. \n\n  \"They\" are us. \n\n CHARLOTTE STICHTER \n\n Takoma Park \n"}
