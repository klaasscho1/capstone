ACTION: Final rule. ----------------------------------------------\n------------------------- SUMMARY: This final rule, consistent with the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), expands \nthe class of individuals who may be eligible for a provisional waiver of certain grounds of inadmissibility based on \nthe accrual of unlawful presence in the United States. \n\nThe provisional unlawful presence waiver (``provisional waiver'') process allows certain individuals who are present \nin the United States to request from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) a provisional waiver of \nthese grounds of inadmissibility before departing the United States for consular processing of their immigrant \nvisas-- rather than applying for a waiver abroad after their immigrant visa interviews using the Form I-601, Waiver \nof Grounds of Inadmissibility (``Form I-601 waiver process''). The provisional waiver process is designed to \nencourage unlawfully present individuals to leave the United States, attend their immigrant visa interviews, and \nreturn to the United States legally to reunite with their U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident (LPR) family \nmembers. Having an approved provisional waiver helps facilitate immigrant visa issuance at DOS, streamlines \nboth the waiver and the immigrant visa processes, and reduces the time that applicants are separated from their \nU.S. citizen or LPR family members, thus promoting family unity. The rule is intended to encourage eligible \nindividuals to complete the immigrant visa process abroad, promote family unity, and improve administrative \nefficiency. DATES: This final rule is effective August 29, 2016. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: \nRoselyn Brown-Frei, Office of Policy and Strategy, Residence and Naturalization Division, U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services, Department of Homeland Security, 20 Massachusetts Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20529-\n2099, Telephone (202) 272-8377 (this is not a toll free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule \nadopts the proposed rule that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published on July 22, 2015, with \n\n\nchanges made in response to comments received. This final rule provides that eligibility for the provisional waiver \nwill no longer be limited to the subset of statutorily qualified individuals who seek to immigrate as immediate \nrelatives of U.S. citizens \\1\\ and who can show that denial of admission will result in extreme hardship to a U.S. \ncitizen spouse or parent. Rather, this final rule makes eligibility for the provisional waiver available to all individuals \nwho are statutorily eligible for a waiver of the unlawful presence grounds of inadmissibility. Under this final rule, \nsuch an individual must go abroad to obtain an immigrant visa, establish that denial of admission will result in \nextreme hardship to a U.S. citizen or LPR spouse or parent, establish that his or her case warrants a favorable \nexercise of discretion, and meet all other regulatory requirements. Eligibility for the provisional waiver will also \nextend to the spouses and children who accompany or follow to join principal immigrants. The rule is intended to \nencourage eligible individuals to complete the immigrant visa process abroad, promote family unity, and improve \nadministrative efficiency. DHS believes that this rule will reduce overall immigrant visa processing times for eligible \nimmigrant visa applicants; encourage individuals who are unlawfully present in the United States to seek lawful \nstatus after departing the country; save resources and time for the Department of State (DOS), DHS, and the \nindividual; and reduce the hardship that U.S. citizen and LPR family members of individuals seeking the provisional \nwaiver may experience as a result of the immigrant visa process. -----------------------------------------------------------------\n---------- \\1\\ Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens are the spouses, children and parents of U.S. citizens, provided that, \nin the case of parents, the U.S. citizen son or daughter petitioner is over the age of 21. In certain situations, the \nformer spouse of a deceased U.S. citizen is also considered an immediate relative. ------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------- Table of Contents: I.

Purpose of the Regulatory Action \nThis final rule, consistent with the INA, expands the provisional unlawful presence waiver process (hereinafter \n``provisional waiver process''), which specifies how an individual may be eligible to receive a provisional waiver of \nhis or her inadmissibility for accrual of unlawful presence prior to departing the United States for processing of an \nimmigrant visa application at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad. See 8 CFR 212.7(e). Generally, individuals who \nare in the United States and seeking lawful permanent resident (LPR) status must either obtain an immigrant visa \nabroad through what is known as ``consular processing'' with the Department of State (DOS) or apply to adjust their \nimmigration status to that of an LPR in the United States, if eligible. Individuals present in the United States without \nhaving been inspected and admitted or paroled are typically ineligible to adjust their status in the United States. To \nobtain LPR status, such individuals must leave the United States for immigrant visa processing at a U.S. Embassy \nor consulate abroad. But because these individuals are present in the United States without having been inspected \nand admitted or paroled, their departures may trigger a ground of [[Page 50245]] inadmissibility based on the \naccrual of unlawful presence in the United States under INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B)(i). \nUnder subclause (I) of this provision, an individual who has been unlawfully present in the United States for more \nthan 180 days but less than one year, and who then departs voluntarily from the United States before the \ncommencement of removal proceedings, is inadmissible for 3 years from the date of departure. See INA section \n212(a)(9)(B)(i)(I), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(I). Under subclause (II), an individual who has been unlawfully present \nin the United States for one year or more and then departs the United States (before, during, or after removal \nproceedings), is inadmissible for 10 years from the date of the departure. See INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(II), 8 \nU.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II). These ``3- and 10-year unlawful presence bars'' do not take effect unless and until the \n\n\n\nindividual departs from the United States. See, e.g., Matter of Rodarte-Roman, 23 I. & N. Dec. 905 (BIA 2006). The \nSecretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) may waive this ground of inadmissibility for an individual who can \ndemonstrate that the refusal of his or her admission to the United States would result in extreme hardship to his or \nher U.S. citizen or LPR spouse or parent. See INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(v), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B)(v). Prior to the \ncreation of the provisional waiver process in 2013, any individual who was seeking an immigrant visa and became \ninadmissible under the 3- or 10-year unlawful presence bar upon departure from the United States, could apply for \na waiver of such inadmissibility from DHS by filing an Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility, Form I-\n601, with USCIS, but only after having attended the consular immigrant visa interview abroad. Those who applied \nfor waivers under this ``Form I-601 waiver process'' \\2\\ were effectively required to remain abroad for at least \nseveral months while USCIS adjudicated their waiver applications.\\3\\ -------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------- \\2\\ The ``Form I-601 waiver process,'' for purposes of this rule, refers to the process that an applicant \nuses when seeking an immigrant visa at a U.S. Embassy or consulate abroad and applying for a waiver of \ninadmissibility by filing an Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility, Form I-601. \\3\\ The average \nadjudication time of Form I-601 applications is currently over five months. Source: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices. USCIS Processing Time Information for the Nebraska Service Center-Form I-601, available at \n\nof removal, exclusion, or deportation to be eligible for provisional waivers provided that they have already applied \nfor, and USCIS has approved, an Application for Permission to Reapply for Admission into the United States After \nDeportation or Removal, Form I-212. (5) Clarifying that DHS must have actually reinstated a removal, deportation, \nor exclusion order in order for an individual who has returned to the United States unlawfully after removal to be \nineligible for a provisional waiver on that basis. In addition, DHS made several technical and non-substantive \nchanges. B. Costs and Benefits This rule's expansion of the provisional waiver process will create costs and \nbenefits for newly eligible provisional waiver (Form I-601A) applicants, their U.S. citizen or LPR family members, \nand the Federal Government (namely, USCIS and DOS), as outlined in the Summary Table. This rule will impose \nfee, time, and travel [[Page 50246]] costs on an estimated 100,000 newly eligible individuals who choose to \ncomplete and submit provisional waiver applications and biometrics (fingerprints, photograph, and signature) to \nUSCIS for consideration during the 10-year period of analysis (see Table 8). These costs will equal an estimated \n$52.4 million at a 7 percent discount rate and $64.2 million at a 3 percent discount rate in present value across the \nperiod of analysis. On an annualized basis, the costs will measure approximately $7.5 million at both 7 percent and \n3 percent discount rates (see Summary Table). Newly eligible provisional waiver applicants and their U.S. citizen or \nLPR family members will benefit from this rule. Those applying for provisional waivers will receive advance notice \nof USCIS' decision to provisionally waive their 3- or 10-year unlawful presence bar before they leave the United \nStates for their immigrant visa interview abroad. This offers applicants and their family members the certainty of \nknowing that the applicants have been provisionally approved for waivers of the 3- and 10-year unlawful presence \nbars before departing from the United States. Individuals with approved provisional waivers may experience \nshortened periods of separation from their family members living in the United States while they pursue issuance of \nimmigrant visas abroad, thus reducing any related financial and emotional strains on the families. USCIS and DOS \nwill continue to benefit from the operational efficiencies gained from the provisional waiver's role in streamlining \nimmigrant visa application processing, but on a larger scale. In the absence of this rule, DHS assumes that the \nmajority of individuals who are newly eligible for provisional waivers under this rule will likely continue to pursue an \nimmigrant visa through consular processing abroad and apply for waivers of grounds of inadmissibility resulting \nfrom the accrual of unlawful presence through the Form I-601 waiver process. Those who apply for unlawful \npresence waivers through the Form I-601 waiver process will incur fee, time, and travel costs similar to individuals \napplying for waivers through the provisional waiver process. However, without this rule, individuals who must seek \na waiver of inadmissibility abroad through the Form I-601 waiver process after the immigrant visa interview may \nface longer separation times from their families in the United States and will experience less certainty regarding the \napproval of a waiver of the 3- or 10-year unlawful presence bar before departing from the United States. Absent a \nwaiver, individuals who are subject to these bars would be unable to obtain LPR status for either 3 or 10 years. \nSummary Table--Total Costs and Benefits of Rule, Year 1-Year 10 ----------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------ 10-Year present values Annualized values -----------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------- 3% Discount rate 7% Discount rate 3% Discount rate 7% Discount rate --------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Costs: Quantitative................ \n$64,168,205....... $52,429,216....... $7,522,471........ $7,464,741 --------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------- Total Benefits: Qualitative.................

II. Background A. Legal Authority Under \nsection 212(a)(9)(B) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B), an individual who has accrued more than 180 days of \nunlawful presence in the United States and then leaves the United States generally is inadmissible for a specified \nperiod after the individual's departure. The inadmissibility period lasts for 3 years if the individual accrued more than \n180 days but less than 1 year of unlawful presence, and for 10 years if the individual accrued 1 year or more of \nunlawful presence. Under INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(v), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B)(v), the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity (``Secretary'') has discretion to waive this ground of inadmissibility if the Secretary finds that denying the \napplicant's admission to the United States would result in extreme hardship to the applicant's U.S. citizen or LPR \nspouse or parent. INA section 103, 8 U.S.C. 1103, gives the Secretary the authority to prescribe regulations for the \nadministration and enforcement of the immigration and naturalization laws of the United States. B. Proposed Rule \nOn July 22, 2015, DHS published a notice of proposed rulemaking to expand eligibility for provisional waivers of \ncertain grounds of inadmissibility based on the accrual of unlawful presence to all individuals who are statutorily \neligible for a waiver [[Page 50247]] of such grounds, are seeking a provisional waiver in connection with an \nimmigrant visa application, and meet other conditions. See proposed rule, Expansion of Provisional Waivers of \nInadmissibility, 80 FR 43338 (July 22, 2015) (2015 Proposed Rule). In response to the proposed rule, DHS \nreceived 606 public comments from individuals, advocacy groups, attorneys, organizations, schools, and local \ngovernments. Some of the comments were submitted through mass mailing or email campaigns or petitions \nexpressing support for or opposition to the provisional waiver process in general. Opinions on the proposed rule \nvaried, but the majority of commenters (472) were supportive of the proposed expansion. Many of these \ncommenters made additional suggestions to improve the provisional waiver process overall. These suggestions are \ndiscussed below. DHS received 82 comments opposed to the proposed rule. In many of these instances, these \ncommenters argued that the Executive Branch lacks the legal authority to implement the proposed changes. \nCommenters indicated that expanding the program amounted to an abuse of authority. One commenter asserted \nthat the rule exceeded the Secretary's authority under the INA and that provisionally approving a waiver before an \nindividual departs from the United States based on a family unity rationale was arbitrary and capricious. Some \ncommenters also believed that the provisional waiver process would grant legal status to individuals unlawfully \npresent in the United States. Others asked that USCIS prioritize the lawful immigrant community over those \nunlawfully present in the United States. DHS received 52 comments that either did not clearly express an opinion in \nsupport of or in opposition to the proposed rule or that did not address any aspect of the proposed rule. For \nexample, a few commenters provided input on immigrants in general, immigration policy, the Federal government, \nand other government programs that are not within the scope of this rulemaking. Because these comments address \nnothing in the proposed rule, DHS provides no specific response to them. Unless mentioned in this supplementary \ninformation, commenters did not make any specific suggestions for changes to the provisional waiver process \nbased on what DHS outlined in the proposed rule. In preparing this final rule, DHS counted and considered each \npublic comment and other relevant materials that appear in the Federal Docket Management System (FDMS). All \ncomments received may be reviewed in FDMS at            http://www.regulations.gov, under docket number USCIS-\n2012-0003. C. Final Rule This final rule adopts most of the regulatory amendments set forth in the proposed rule \nexcept for a few provisions, as explained in this preamble. The rationale for the proposed rule and the reasoning \nprovided in its preamble remain valid with respect to the regulatory amendments adopted. Additionally, DHS has \nmade several changes to the regulatory provisions based on the comments received. This final rule also adopts the \ntechnical regulatory amendments suggested in the proposed rule without change. This final rule does not address \ncomments seeking changes in U.S. laws, regulations, or agency policies that are unrelated to the provisional waiver \nprocess or the clarifying technical amendments to 8 CFR 212.7. This final rule does not change the procedures or \npolicies of other DHS components or Federal agencies, or resolve issues outside the scope of this rulemaking. III. \nPublic Comments on the Proposed Rule A. Summary of Public Comments The 60-day public comment period for \nthe proposed rule ended on September 21, 2015. The majority of comments came from supporters who agreed \nthat the proposed rule would promote family unity and reduce the length of time family members would be \nseparated. Many considered family unity as one of the core principles of U.S. immigration law and stated that this \nrulemaking benefitted the United States overall, not just families. Several commenters made suggestions for \nsimplifying the provisional waiver process overall. Some commenters identified themselves as U.S. citizens or LPR \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\n\n\nfamily members (including children) who were worried about their relatives' immigration situations and about being \nseparated from their family members for prolonged time periods. Numerous commenters who urged DHS to \nimplement the proposed expansion shared personal stories and described hardships they have experienced or may \nexperience upon being separated from family members. Many reasoned that keeping families together assists the \nU.S. economy and otherwise strengthens the country, because many individuals who are undocumented work hard, \npay taxes, and are concerned about the well-being of their children. Many asserted that the 3- and 10-year unlawful \npresence bars and other bars to admissibility are inhumane and cruel and that these laws need to change. \nBacklogs in the immigration system, such as visa backlogs, were raised generally by commenters as additional \nreasons for supporting this rule. Some commenters also believed that expanding eligibility for the provisional waiver \nprocess would streamline the waiver adjudication process for applicants inadmissible based on the accrual of \nunlawful presence in the United States, thereby making the immigrant visa process faster and more predictable. \nFinally, a commenter expressed the belief that expanding the process would reduce burdens on DOS. Several \ncommenters who disagreed with the proposed expansion argued that the Executive Branch lacks the legal authority \nto implement the proposed changes without congressional approval. Others stated that the proposed expansion is \nthe Administration's way of circumventing existing laws, creating amnesty, and favoring those who are unlawfully \npresent over lawful immigrants. Some considered the measure to be unconstitutional, arbitrary, and capricious. A \nnumber of commenters asserted that the expansion would reward law breakers, further illegal immigration, and lead \nto system abuse and fraud, as well as additional social problems. For several commenters, unifying families was \nnot an acceptable justification for the proposed rule. Some asserted that it is not the U.S. Government's place to \naccommodate people who are in the country illegally. Those commenters expressed that family separation is a \nnatural consequence of an individual's choice to break the law. Others asserted that expanding the process would \nundermine the Nation's sovereignty, economy, security, and proper law enforcement efforts. Overall, these \ncommenters believed that the expansion would erode the integrity of the immigration system. Many of the \ncommenters identified themselves as lawful immigrants or relatives of lawful immigrants. Some of these \nindividuals voiced disappointment over the proposed expansion and indicated that the Federal Government's \nmoney and resources would be better invested in assisting U.S. citizens and lawful immigrants. These \ncommenters emphasized that they have complied with the law, paid taxes, and worked hard toward maintaining \nlawful status, [[Page 50248]] and they asked DHS to first assist individuals who are lawfully present in the United \nStates to obtain immigrant status by fixing the backlogged immigration system before fixing processes that benefit \nthose who are unlawfully present in the United States. One commenter suggested that local governments, rather \nthan the Federal Government, should control the immigration process. This commenter indicated that local \ngovernments are in a better position to consider the costs of immigration measures to local communities. Other \ncommenters considered the rule unnecessary and current regulations sufficient to address the immigrant \ncommunity's needs. One commenter asked that DHS restrict and not expand the provisional waiver process in \norder to better control the U.S. border. DHS has reviewed all of the public comments received in response to the \nproposed rule and addresses those comments focused on aspects in this final rule. DHS's responses to these \ncomments are grouped by subject area, with a focus on the most common issues and suggestions raised by the \ncommenters. The response to each comment also explains whether DHS made any changes to address the \ncomment. DHS received no comments on the following topics addressed in the proposed rule: Inclusion of Diversity \nVisa selectees; inclusion of derivative spouses and children; the rejection criteria; the validity of an approved \nprovisional waiver; and automatic revocation. B. Legal Authority A number of commenters questioned the \nDepartment's legal authority to expand the provisional waiver process. Some commenters expressed the view that \nthe rule constituted an attempt to circumvent Congress, and that it was as an effort in disregard of current \nimmigration laws, including case law. Some commenters also stated that the proposed rule exceeded DHS \nauthorities in implementing the Secretary's directive to expand eligibility for provisional waivers. Others asserted \nthat the rule was arbitrary and capricious. DHS disagrees that this rule's expansion of the provisional waiver \nprocess exceeds the Secretary's legal authority. As a preliminary matter, the Federal Government has plenary \nauthority over immigration and naturalization, and Congress may enact legislation establishing immigration law and \npolicy. See, e.g., Arizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. 2492, 2498 (2012) (``The Government of the United States \nhas broad, undoubted power over the subject of immigration and the status of aliens. This authority rests, in part, on \nthe National Government's constitutional power to `establish [a] uniform Rule of Naturalization,' and its inherent \npower as sovereign to control and conduct relations with foreign nations.'' (citations omitted)); see also Fiallo v. Bell, \n\n\n\n430 U.S. 787, 792 (1977). The Executive Branch, which includes DHS, implements the laws passed by Congress, \nand Congress has specifically charged the Secretary with the administration and enforcement of the immigration \nand naturalization laws. See 6 U.S.C. 112, 202(3)-(5); INA section 103, 8 U.S.C. 1103(a). The Secretary is also \nauthorized to promulgate rules and ``perform such other acts as he deems necessary for carrying out his \nauthority.'' INA section 103(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(3). The Secretary thus has broad discretion to determine the \nmost effective way to administer the immigration laws. See, e.g., Jean v. Nelson, 727 F.2d 957, 965 (11th Cir. \n1984) (``The principal responsibility for immigration matters in the Executive branch resides with the [Secretary], \nwho is the beneficiary of broad grants of discretion under the statute.''), aff'd, 472 U.S. 846 (1985); Narenji v. \nCiviletti, 617 F.2d 745, 747 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (observing that the INA ``need not specifically authorize each and every \naction taken by the Attorney General [(now Secretary of Homeland Security)], so long as his action is reasonably \nrelated to the duties imposed upon him''). More specifically, Congress provided for a waiver of the 3- and 10- year \nunlawful presence bars in INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(v), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B)(v), for individuals who can \ndemonstrate extreme hardship to certain qualifying relatives. That section does not restrict the manner in which \neligible individuals can seek such waivers. In 2013, DHS created the provisional waiver process to allow certain \nimmigrant visa applicants who are immediate relatives of U.S. citizens to provisionally apply for waivers before \nthey leave the United States for their consular interviews. The creation of this process was merely a procedural \nchange that addressed the manner in which eligible individuals can apply for the statutorily provided waiver of \ninadmissibility. See Provisional Unlawful Presence Waivers of Inadmissibility for Certain Immediate Relatives, 78 \nFR 536, 541 (Jan. 3, 2013) (``2013 Rule''). This rule expands on that process by simply expanding the pool of \nindividuals eligible to apply for provisional waivers to statutorily eligible individuals in all immigrant visa \nclassifications, subject to certain conditions. See new 8 CFR 212.7(e). Like the 2013 Rule, this Final Rule, \ntherefore, does not create new waiver authority; it implements an existing authority conferred by Congress.\\4\\ --------\n------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ Neither conditioning a waiver on an individual's departure \nfrom the United States nor allowing advance application for a waiver is novel. For example, DHS regulations at 8 \nCFR 212.2(j) have long allowed an individual who is subject to a removal order to seek consent to reapply for \nadmission under INA section 212(a)(9)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(A)(iii), while the individual is in the United States \nand before the individual departs the United States. A grant of consent to reapply for admission, like the provisional \nwaiver, is conditioned on the individual's eventual departure from the United States. See 8 CFR 212.2(j). DHS and \nformer Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) regulations have permitted advance applications for consent to \nreapply for admission under INA section 212(a)(9)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(A)(iii) since at least 1969. See, e.g., \n34 FR 9061 (1969); 36 FR 11635 (1971). The INS also permitted advance waiver applications under former INA \nsection 212(c), 8 U.S.C. 1182(c) (repealed 1996). See 8 CFR 212.3(b); 52 FR 11620 (1987). ------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------- Finally, DHS disagrees with commenters who stated that the proposed rule is \narbitrary and capricious. The commenters appear to assert that DHS exceeds its statutory authority by violating the \nsubstantive requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). See 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A). A rulemaking may be \nconsidered arbitrary and capricious under the APA when an agency's action is unreasonable, unsound, or not \nexplained, or when it fails to demonstrate that the agency has considered the circumstances surrounding its action. \nAn agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action, including a \nrational connection between the facts found and the choice made. See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of the United \nStates, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 42-43 (1983). DHS has made clear throughout the \nproposed rule and this preamble all of the factors that were considered in putting forth the proposal and has \narticulated how the expansion of the provisional waiver process is tied to the purposes of the immigration laws and \nefficient operation of the immigration system. See generally 2015 Proposed Rule, 80 FR 43339. DHS believes that \nthe assertions of these commenters are unfounded. C. Eligibility for the Provisional Waiver 1. Categories of Eligible \nIndividuals Many commenters believed that expanding eligibility for the provisional waiver as proposed to all \nstatutorily [[Page 50249]] eligible individuals--including beneficiaries in family-sponsored and employment-based \npreference categories, as well as Diversity Visa selectees--would offer benefits to the U.S. Government and \nfacilitate legal immigration and family unity. These commenters indicated that the expansion would reduce the fear \nof many immigrants, who otherwise may worry that they would be unable to reunite with their families after leaving \nthe United States to have their immigrant visas processed abroad. Accordingly, some commenters suggested that \nall individuals with approved immigrant visa petitions should be able to participate in the provisional waiver \nprocess, regardless of whether they are located inside or outside the United States. Other commenters asked that \n\n\n\nUSCIS allow individuals with approved immigrant visa petitions to apply for provisional waivers regardless of their \npriority dates, especially if they had been present in the United States for many years. Many commenters asked \nthat DHS allow the following categories of individuals to apply for provisional waivers: (1) Married or unmarried \nindividuals over the age of 21 with U.S. citizen parents; (2) individuals over the age of 21, whether single or married; \n(3) spouses of U.S. citizens without a criminal record and with good standing in their communities; (4) parents of \nU.S. citizens with approved petitions; (5) sons-in-law and daughters-in-law; and 6) self- petitioning widows and \nwidowers of U.S. citizens. Some commenters urged DHS to prioritize relatives of U.S. citizens over relatives of \nLPRs. Some commenters asked that DHS focus not only on families, but also on sponsored employees, \ncorporations, and self-sponsored business owners. Others requested that DHS include the following categories of \nindividuals in the provisional waiver process: (1) Those with nonimmigrant investor-type visas; (2) well-educated \nprofessionals; (3) those with approved immigrant visa petitions but without any family in the United States; (4) \nspouses of nonimmigrant visa holders who are beneficiaries of approved employment-based immigrant visa \npetitions (Forms I-140); and (5) those with pending immigrant visa petitions. Many commenters requested that \nUSCIS adjust an individual's status to that of an LPR upon approval of the waiver; others mistakenly believed that \nUSCIS already does so. The Secretary is authorized to waive the 3- and 10-year unlawful presence bars for \nindividuals seeking admission to the United States as immigrants if they can show that the refusal of admission \nwould result in extreme hardship to a qualifying U.S. citizen or LPR spouse or parent, and provided that the \napplicant warrants a favorable exercise of discretion. See INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(v), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B)(v). \nWith this final rule, DHS is allowing all individuals who are statutorily eligible for an immigrant visa and who meet \nthe legal requirements for a waiver under INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(v), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B)(v), to seek a \nprovisional waiver in accordance with new 8 CFR 212.7(e). Consistent with the current provisional waiver process, \nprovisional waivers are available only to those who are present in the United States, who must apply for immigrant \nvisas at U.S. embassies or consulates abroad, and who at the time of the immigrant visa interview may be \ninadmissible based on the accrual of unlawful presence under INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B)(i). \nDHS can only expand the pool of individuals eligible for this process to those who fall within one of the current \nstatutory immigrant visa classifications and who meet the requirements for the unlawful presence waiver described \nin INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(v), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B)(v). DHS cannot expand eligibility to those who are not \nstatutorily eligible for such waivers under current law. Similarly, DHS cannot change who is statutorily eligible to \nadjust status in the United States. Intending immigrants who are present in the United States but ineligible to \nadjust status must depart the United States and obtain their immigrant visas through consular processing abroad; \napproval of a provisional waiver does not change this requirement. See INA sections 104, 202(a)(1)(B), 211, 221, \n222 and 245; 8 U.S.C. 1104, 1152(a)(1)(B), 1181, 1201, 1202, and 1255. See generally 8 CFR part 245; 22 CFR \npart 42. As indicated above, many commenters asked that DHS expand the provisional waiver process to include \nadditional categories of individuals, including sons or daughters who have approved immigrant visa petitions and \nare over the age of 21 or married. To clarify, in the proposed rule, DHS sought to include all beneficiaries of \napproved immigrant visa petitions who are statutorily eligible for a waiver of the 3- and 10-year unlawful presence \nbars, regardless of age, marital status, or immigration status. Individuals with approved immigrant visa petitions, \nincluding sons and daughters (married or unmarried) of U.S. citizens, as well as those who have been selected to \nparticipate in the Diversity Visa program, may participate in the provisional waiver process provided they meet the \nrequirements stated in 8 CFR 212.7(e). Consistent with its statutory authority under INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(v), 8 \nU.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B)(v), DHS will no longer limit the provisional waiver process to certain immediate relatives of \nU.S. citizens.\\5\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ Additionally, as explained throughout \nthis preamble, DHS is changing other eligibility and ineligibility criteria in response to comments received. -------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------- 2. Backlogged Immigrant Visa Categories and Eligibility for Interim \nBenefits A large number of commenters suggested that individuals with approved family-sponsored and \nemployment-based immigrant visa petitions should be permitted to obtain provisional waivers if immigrant visas \nare unavailable to them as a result of visa backlogs.\\6\\ Many commenters expressed frustration with the current \nlegal immigration system and lengthy wait times for visas, which separate families and hinder the professional \ndevelopment of many individuals and their family members. Some commenters said it was unfair that DHS and \nUSCIS seek to implement rules that assist persons who came to the United States unlawfully. These commenters \nindicated that those who came legally to the United States but who cannot obtain immigrant status as a result of \nvisa backlogs should also receive assistance. These commenters opined that those who immigrate lawfully, such \n\n\n\nas employment-based immigrants, bring economic advantages to the United States. ---------------------------------------\n------------------------------------ \\6\\ In particular, some commenters requested that DHS include married and unmarried \nsons and daughters of U.S. citizens for whom an immigrant visa is unavailable due to immigrant visa backlogs. ---\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ A few commenters suggested that individuals with or without \napproved provisional waivers should be given interim benefits while awaiting visa availability. For example, one \ncommenter requested that USCIS grant deferred action and work authorization to undocumented individuals who \nare U.S.-educated professionals in nursing, medical, or engineering fields, are the beneficiaries of family-sponsored \npetitions, and have displayed good conduct. Another commenter requested that an individual with an approved \nprovisional waiver be issued a temporary Social Security number and renewable work authorization for a minimum \nof 3 years. A commenter asked USCIS to provide work authorization and advance parole documents to enable \ntravel outside of, [[Page 50250]] and facilitate return to, the United States to lawfully present individuals affected by \nvisa backlogs if they otherwise complied with the immigration laws. Another commenter believed that USCIS should \ngrant parole in place to an individual with an approved immigrant visa petition and provisional waiver, if the \npetitioner's or beneficiary's disability makes travel abroad hazardous due to a condition covered by the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act (ADA).\\7\\ After receiving parole in place, the commenter reasoned, the beneficiary could adjust \nhis or her status in the United States and would not have to risk the petitioner's or the beneficiary's life by traveling. \nFinally, many commenters expressed the desire that individuals be able to adjust status in the United States if they \nhave an approved petition or provisional waiver. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\7\\ See \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101- 336), as amended. ---------------------------------------------------------\n------------------ DHS acknowledges the concerns many intending immigrants face due to backlogs in available \nimmigrant visa numbers. As noted, DHS is broadening the availability of the provisional waiver process to include \nall statutorily eligible individuals--including all beneficiaries of family-sponsored and employment-based immigrant \nvisa petitions, as well as Diversity Visa selectees--who have a qualifying relative under the statute for purposes of \nthe extreme hardship determination. Beneficiaries in family-sponsored and employment-based preference \ncategories, as well as Diversity Visa immigrants, are subject to annual numerical limits that have been set by \nCongress. See INA sections 201, 202 and 203; 8 U.S.C. 1151, 1152 and 1153. Neither DOS nor DHS can change \nthe number of visas that Congress allocates for particular immigrant visa categories, nor can they alter the \nstatutory requirements for adjustment of status in the United States. Addressing those recommendations would \nrequire legislative changes. DHS does not consider it appropriate to make an application for a provisional waiver, or \nthe approval of such an application, a basis for granting interim benefits, including an advance parole document or \nemployment authorization. In particular, because an approved immigrant visa petition and a waiver of \ninadmissibility do not independently confer any immigration status or otherwise afford lawful presence in the United \nStates, neither may typically serve as the basis for interim benefits. Furthermore, issuance of interim benefits to \nindividuals who are granted provisional waivers may encourage them to postpone their timely departures from the \nUnited States to pursue their immigrant visa applications. The purpose of the provisional waiver process is not to \nprolong an applicant's unlawful presence in the United States. Rather, the purpose is to facilitate the applicant's \ndeparture to attend an immigrant visa interview abroad so that they may complete their application process for an \nimmigrant visa. Moreover, providing an advance parole document is unnecessary because the premise of the \nprovisional waiver process is that the applicant, if eligible, will depart the United States and return with an \nimmigrant visa. The provisional waiver process is designed to encourage unlawfully present individuals to leave \nthe United States, attend their immigrant visa interviews, and return to the United States legally to reunite with their \nU.S. citizen or LPR family members. Having an approved provisional waiver helps facilitate immigrant visa \nissuance at DOS, streamlines both the waiver and the immigrant visa processes, and reduces the time that \napplicants are separated from their U.S. citizen or LPR family members, thus promoting family unity. 3. Individuals \nOutside the United States A few commenters asked DHS to extend eligibility for provisional waivers to individuals \noutside the United States. Commenters argued that such individuals should be eligible for provisional waivers \nbecause they are often relatives of U.S. citizens with approved immigrant visa petitions and have immigrant visa \napplications pending with DOS. These commenters also suggested that those who need waivers of the 3- and 10-\nyear unlawful presence bars but are now outside the United States should not be disadvantaged by their decision to \nultimately comply with the immigration laws by departing the United States. The commenters believed that DHS \nshould apply the same rules and processes to all visa applicants. DHS understands the difficulties that U.S. \ncitizens and LPRs face when their family members are outside the United States and are attempting to navigate the \n\n\n\nimmigrant visa process. DHS notes, however, that individuals who are outside the United States and are eligible \nfor waivers of the 3- and 10-year unlawful presence bars may apply for such waivers through the preexisting Form \nI-601 waiver process. Considering the existence of the Form I-601 waiver process, DHS continues to believe that \nexpanding the provisional waiver process to those individuals abroad would duplicate steps already incorporated in \nthe DOS immigrant visa process and would not be an efficient use of agency resources. DHS thus will not adopt \nthe suggestion.\\8\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\8\\ For additional discussion relating to \nthis suggestion, please refer to the 2013 Rule, 78 FR at 543. ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--- However, to alleviate some of the delays in waiver processing for those filing from abroad, USCIS has \nimplemented the centralization of Form I-601 application filings, which no longer requires that applicants schedule \n``waiver filing'' appointments with a U.S. embassy or consulate. Instead, Form I-601 applicants now file the waiver \napplication directly with USCIS at a centralized location in the United States, thereby significantly reducing the time \nthey are required to be outside the United States. By centralizing the processing of these waiver applications at \nlocations in the United States, USCIS is able to better ensure that applications are processed in the most efficient \nmanner possible. 4. Extreme Hardship Several commenters requested that USCIS clarify the term ``extreme \nhardship'' in guidance or regulations. Others suggested that the proposed rule was legally flawed because DHS \nhad not promulgated the requirements for establishing extreme hardship. Commenters requested that DHS clearly \ndefine the term and apply it fairly, including by considering the financial, emotional, and other harmful effects that \nresult from separating families. Commenters believed that clarifying the term would lead to greater consistency in \nadjudication. One commenter asked that extreme hardship examples be included in guidance and in the provisional \nwaiver application form. Many commenters also requested that USCIS ease the extreme hardship standard and its \ndocumentary requirements, including, for example, by presuming extreme hardship in certain cases involving \nvulnerable families. Commenters often referenced the interim rule at 8 CFR 240.64(d) \\9\\ as a precedent that DHS \ncould consider for purposes of adopting one or more presumptions of extreme hardship. Commenters also urged \nUSCIS to extend the special accommodation for beneficiaries of immigrant visa petitions described in INA section \n204(l), 8 U.S.C. 1154(l), to self-petitioning widows and widowers of U.S. citizens when such [[Page 50251]] citizens \ndied before filing immigrant visa petitions on behalf of their spouses. INA section 204(l), 8 U.S.C. 1154(l), allows \nfor immigrant visa petitions and related applications to be approved or reinstated for certain beneficiaries despite \nthe death of the petitioner or principal beneficiary. Under the special accommodation, the death of the petitioner or \nprincipal beneficiary is treated as the ``functional equivalent'' of a finding of extreme hardship in cases where he or \nshe could have served as a ``qualifying relative'' for purposes of waiving the 3- and 10-year unlawful presence \nbars.\\10\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\9\\ This regulation was promulgated under \nsection 203 of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA), Public Law 105-100 (Nov. \n19, 1997). \\10\\ See USCIS AFM Chapter 10.21(c)(5),            \n\nwould experience extreme hardship; (5) the applicant's sibling would experience extreme hardship; (6) the applicant \nwould trigger the 3- or 10-year unlawful presence bar when departing the United States; (7) the applicant has \nwaited for a prolonged period for an immigrant visa to become available; (8) the applicant is the beneficiary of an \nemployment-based immigrant visa petition (because beneficiaries of such petitions may not have U.S. citizen or \nLPR qualifying relatives); \\12\\ or (9) the applicant has family in the United States but not a qualifying relative. Many \ncommenters also requested that DHS give consideration to extreme hardship that would be suffered by U.S. citizen \nor LPR sons and daughters who are over the age of 21 or who are married.\\13\\ One commenter requested that \nspecial consideration be given to those in ``special situation[s]'' with respect to extreme hardship determinations, \neven if they do not have qualifying relatives. That commenter appeared to suggest that USCIS should create two \nclassifications for assessing waiver eligibility, one for individuals with LPR family members and one for individuals \nwithout LPR family members. A few commenters asked DHS to eliminate the extreme hardship standard altogether. \nMany such commenters felt that taxpaying citizens who are ``good people'' should be able to keep their families \ntogether and that it is unfair to separate families simply because certain individuals cannot establish extreme \nhardship. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\12\\ Some commenters asked USCIS to accept \na showing of extreme hardship to an employer, but such consideration is not authorized by the statutory waiver \nauthority at INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(v), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B)(v). \\13\\ In many instances, it was unclear whether \ncommenters were requesting additional eligibility criteria for provisional waivers in general, or whether they were \nrequesting that DHS consider additional classes of individuals to be qualifying relatives for purposes of the extreme \nhardship determination. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- One commenter suggested that \nUSCIS should contact experts and declarants claiming personal knowledge of a qualifying relative's hardship claim \nby mail in order to verify that such claims are legitimate. This commenter also suggested that DHS should only \nconsider hardship flowing from a qualifying relative's decision to remain in the United States and not the hardship \nsuch a relative may confront if he or she chooses to depart with the inadmissible applicant. That commenter viewed \nas ``hypothetical'' the hardship that may result if the qualifying relative chooses to depart, but as ``verifi[able]'' the \nhardship resulting from the choice of a qualifying relative to stay behind in the United States. According to the \ncommenter, considering hypothetical hardship in another country is unnecessary and too difficult to document. \nOther commenters proposed that DHS provide in its regulations a list of consequences or other factors typically \nassociated with removal that adjudicators would consider when making extreme hardship recommendations. These \ncommenters suggested that such a list of factors be drawn from historical data and precedent decisions. The \ncommenters further suggested that such a list would be analogous to what is provided in the regulation for \nNACARA \\14\\ applicants at 8 CFR 1240.58(b). The commenters considered such an approach invaluable to \nachieving consistent adjudication of all waiver applications under the INA, not just provisional waiver applications. \nThe commenters also believed that such an approach would reduce the incentive for individuals to make conclusory \nand unsupported allegations when applying for provisional waivers. According to these commenters, the lack of \nsuch a regulation was a ``capricious political benefit'' to those unlawfully present in the United States. ------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------- \\14\\ See note 8, supra. ----------------------------------------------------------------\n----------- Finally, another commenter requested that USCIS establish specific questions related to hardship so that \nUSCIS officers can quickly determine whether a threshold level of extreme hardship has been demonstrated.\\15\\ As \nan alternative to an extreme hardship showing, another commenter suggested that USCIS permit applicants to \nexplain why they violated U.S. immigration laws. Another commenter indicated that it was important to train officers \nin this area. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\15\\ The commenter cited the Application for \nSuspension of Deportation or Special Rule Cancellation of Removal, Form I-881, which contains a list of questions \nrelating to factors considered when evaluating extreme hardship as drawn from the NACARA special rule \nregulations at 8 CFR 1240.58(b). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- DHS cannot adopt \nsuggestions to revise the statutory requirements for waivers of the unlawful presence grounds of inadmissibility \nunder INA section 212(a)(9)(B), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B). The authorizing statute requires the applicant to show \nextreme hardship to a U.S. citizen or LPR spouse or parent, and DHS does not have the authority to change the \nstatutory requirement. DHS also cannot approve a provisional waiver application if the applicant has not \ndemonstrated extreme hardship to a qualifying relative as required by the INA. DHS also declines in this rulemaking \nto define extreme hardship for purposes of the provisional waiver (or more generally), or to create a rebuttable \n[[Page 50252]] presumption related to such determinations. The INA does not define extreme hardship. The Board \nof Immigration Appeals (BIA) has stated that extreme hardship is not a definable term of fixed and inflexible \n\n\n\nmeaning, and that establishing extreme hardship is dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each case.\\16\\ \nSee Matter of Cervantes- Gonzalez, 22 I&N Dec. 560, 565 (BIA 1999) (describing factors to be considered in \nextreme hardship analysis), aff'd, Cervantes-Gonzales v. INS, 244 F.3d 1001 (9th Cir. 2001). Accordingly, DHS will \ncontinue to make extreme hardship determinations for purposes of provisional waivers on a case-by-case basis, \nconsistent with agency guidance. On October 7, 2015, USCIS posted proposed guidance on extreme hardship \ndeterminations for public comment on its Web site at            www.uscis.gov.\\17\\ USCIS also continually trains its \nofficers on all aspects of the provisional waiver adjudication, including the extreme hardship determination. -----------\n---------------------------------------------------------------- \\16\\ The BIA and immigration judges, both under the jurisdiction of \nthe Department of Justice, Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), also make extreme hardship \ndeterminations for purposes of adjudicating applications for extreme hardship waivers under INA section \n212(a)(9)(B)(v), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B)(v), and for other immigration benefits and relief from exclusion, deportation, \nor removal. \\17\\ The proposed guidance on extreme hardship determinations can be viewed at            \nhttp://www.uscis.gov/\n\npurposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest, provided the individual meets all other \nrequirements. See INA section 212(d)(11), 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(11). \\20\\ Of the commenters who asked DHS to \nexpand the provisional waiver process to include waivers of other grounds of inadmissibility, many requested that \nDHS specifically include the Application for Permission to Reapply for Admission into the United States After \nDeportation or Removal, Form I-212. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Several commenters \nrequested that the provisional waiver process be available to individuals who are barred for unlawful reentry after \nprevious immigration violations under INA section 212(a)(9)(C), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(C). Others suggested making \nthe process available to individuals who are inadmissible under that section if they are spouses of U.S. citizens or \nLPRs. A few commenters asked that certain categories of individuals receive special treatment.\\21\\ For example, a \ncommenter requested that DHS create a special waiver for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) \nrecipients. Others asked that DHS add special provisions to benefit the relatives of active members or veterans of \nthe U.S. Armed Forces. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\21\\ It was often unclear if the \ncommenters sought implementation of new waivers or an expansion of the provisional waiver to include these \ngrounds of inadmissibility. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- DHS considered these \ncomments but did not adopt the suggested changes. DHS cannot waive grounds of inadmissibility for those who are \nnot authorized to receive waivers under the immigration laws. Implementation of these suggestions thus would have \nexceeded DHS's statutory authority. Other suggestions did not support a principal goal of the provisional waiver \nprocess, which is to streamline immigrant visa issuance for individuals who are eligible for an immigrant visa and \notherwise admissible to the United States \\22\\ but whose family members would experience extreme hardship due \nto application of certain unlawful presence grounds of inadmissibility. As explained in the 2013 Rule, DOS consular \nofficers are charged with [[Page 50253]] determining whether individuals are eligible for issuance of immigrant \nvisas, including whether they are affected by one or more grounds of inadmissibility. Expanding the provisional \nwaiver process to other grounds of inadmissibility would introduce additional complexity and inefficiencies into the \nimmigrant visa process, create potential backlogs, and likely delay and adversely affect the processing of \nimmigrant visas by DOS. Furthermore, USCIS generally assesses waiver applications for inadmissibility due to \nfraud, misrepresentation, or criminal history through an in-person interview at a USCIS field office. Because DOS \nalready conducts a thorough in-person interview as part of the immigrant visa process, DHS believes that this type \nof review would be unnecessarily duplicative of DOS's efforts. -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n---- \\22\\ Upon departure from the United States to attend a consular interview, an individual no longer would be \ninadmissible as a result of being present in the United States without admission or parole under INA section \n212(a)(6)(A)(i), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), or for lacking proper immigrant entry documents under INA section \n212(a)(7)(A), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(7)(A). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Because the text of \nthe statute forecloses the issue, DHS also rejects the suggestion to expand the provisional waiver process to \ninclude individuals who are inadmissible based on a return (or attempted return) without admission after previous \nimmigration violations under INA section 212(a)(9)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(C)(i). The relevant forms of relief for \nindividuals who are inadmissible under that section are found at INA section 212(a)(9)(C)(ii) and (iii), 8 U.S.C. \n1182(a)(9)(C)(ii) and (iii). See Matter of Torres-Garcia, 23 I&N Dec. 866 (BIA 2006). Under the statute, waivers \nunder INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(v), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B)(v), cannot be used to relieve an applicant from \ninadmissibility under INA section 212(a)(9)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(C)(i). 6. Reason-to-Believe Standard Under \ncurrent regulations, USCIS must deny a provisional waiver application if USCIS has ``reason to believe'' that the \napplicant may be subject to a ground of inadmissibility other than unlawful presence at the time of the immigrant \nvisa interview abroad (``reason-to-believe standard''). 8 CFR 212.7(e)(4)(i).\\23\\ Commenters asked DHS to clarify \nthe reason-to-believe standard and to train officers \\24\\ so that they properly apply the standard. Many argued that \nUSCIS often applies the standard too rigidly by denying applications on mere suspicion, rather than actually \nadjudicating the relevant inadmissibility concerns consistent with applicable law relating to these grounds. -------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------- \\23\\ That regulation reads: ``Ineligible aliens. Notwithstanding \nparagraph (e)(3) of this section, an alien is ineligible for a provisional unlawful presence waiver under paragraph (e) \nof this section if: (i) USCIS has reason to believe that the alien may be subject to grounds of inadmissibility other \nthan unlawful presence under section 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(I) or (II) of the Act at the time of the immigrant visa interview \nwith the Department of State.'' 8 CFR 212.7(e)(4)(i). \\24\\ USCIS has continually trained its officers on all aspects of \nthe provisional waiver adjudication, including how to determine whether individuals may be subject to additional \ninadmissibility grounds at the time of the immigrant visa interview. However, since USCIS is removing the reason-\n\n\n\nto-believe standard as a basis for eligibility, we will no longer be training officers on application of this specific \nstandard. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Commenters also urged DHS to expand the \nscope of the January 24, 2014 field guidance memorandum on the reason-to-believe standard.\\25\\ Commenters \nspecifically asked DHS to direct USCIS officers to consider the totality of the evidence when assessing whether \nother grounds of inadmissibility apply to an applicant, and to issue Requests for Evidence (RFEs) related to such \ngrounds prior to denying a provisional waiver application for mere suspicion that such grounds apply. Commenters \ncriticized the lack of issuance of RFEs or Notices of Intent to Deny (NOIDs), as well as USCIS' use of standard \ndenial template language when denying a provisional waiver application under the reason-to-believe standard. \nCommenters stated that the use of these denial templates implies that USCIS does not consider the evidence that \napplicants submit to show that they are in fact not inadmissible on other grounds. In addition, the commenters \nstated that the templates did not provide sufficient information to indicate why USCIS determined it had reason to \nbelieve that the applicant would be inadmissible at the time of the immigrant visa interview, thus preventing \napplicants from addressing the agency's concerns upon reapplication. Commenters requested that USCIS instruct \nits officers to clearly articulate the fact specific circumstances that led them to deny an application for ``reason to \nbelieve'' that the applicant is inadmissible on other grounds.\\26\\ A couple of commenters suggested that DHS make \nexceptions to the reason-to-believe standard for certain circumstances or classes of individuals. --------------------------\n------------------------------------------------- \\25\\ See USCIS Memorandum, Guidance Pertaining to Applicants for \nProvisional Unlawful Presence Waivers (Jan. 24, 2014), available at            \nhttp://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/nativedocuments/2014-\n0124_Reason_To_Believe_Field_Guidance_Pertaining_to_Applicants_for_Provisional_Unlawful_Presence_Waiver\ns-final.pdf. \\26\\ These commenters suggested adding specific regulatory text in 8 CFR 212.7(e)(4) and 8 CFR \n212.7(e)(9) that would require officers to consider the totality of the circumstances and to recount particular facts of \nthe case when denying waiver applications under the reason-to-believe standard. ---------------------------------------------\n------------------------------ Considering the confusion that has resulted from application of the reason-to-believe \nstandard, DHS is eliminating the standard from the provisional waiver process in this final rule. Under the 2013 \nRule, an approved provisional waiver would take effect if DOS subsequently determined that the applicant was \nineligible for an immigrant visa only on account of the 3- or 10-year unlawful presence bar under INA section \n212(a)(9)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B)(i). Accordingly, DHS had originally incorporated the reason-to-believe \nstandard in the 2013 Rule to preclude individuals from obtaining provisional waivers if they may have triggered \nother grounds of inadmissibility. DHS reasoned, in part, that because the goal of the provisional waiver process was \nto streamline immigrant visa processing, it would be of little benefit to applicants or to DHS to grant provisional \nwaivers to applicants who would eventually be denied immigrant visas based on other grounds of inadmissibility. \nSince the implementation of the provisional waiver program, however, stakeholders have raised concerns over the \napplication of the reason-to-believe standard. Among other things, DHS understands that the standard causes \nconfusion for applicants, as evidenced by the comments submitted to this rule. Despite the Department's repeated \nattempts to explain the reason-to-believe standard, for example, commenters continue to erroneously believe that \nwhen USCIS denies a provisional waiver application under the reason-to-believe standard, the agency has actually \nmade an inadmissibility determination with respect to the relevant other ground(s) of inadmissibility. Alternatively, as \nexplained in the 2013 Rule, it would be counterproductive for USCIS to make other inadmissibility determinations \nduring the adjudication of provisional waiver applications, given DOS's role in the immigrant visa process. It is \nDOS, and not USCIS, that generally determines admissibility under INA section 212(a), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a), as part of \nthe immigrant visa process, which includes an in-depth, in-person interview conducted by DOS consular officers. \nMoreover, it is U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) that ultimately determines admissibility at the time that \nindividuals seek admission at a port of entry. See INA sections 204(e), 221(h); 8 U.S.C. 1154(e), 1201(h). It is thus \ngenerally not USCIS's role to determine whether an individual applying for an immigrant visa, or for admission as \nan immigrant at a U.S. port of entry, is admissible to the United States. Any assessment by USCIS with respect to \nother grounds of inadmissibility would be, at best, [[Page 50254]] advisory in nature and would likely cause even \ngreater confusion for applicants. These considerations have prompted DHS to revisit the current approach. In this \nfinal rule, DHS has decided to eliminate the reason- to-believe standard as a basis for denying provisional waiver \napplications. Accordingly, when adjudicating such applications, USCIS will only consider whether extreme hardship \nhas been established and whether the applicant warrants a favorable exercise of discretion. However, although this \nfinal rule eliminates the reason-to-believe standard, the final rule retains the provision that provides for the \n\nhttp://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/nativedocuments/2014-0124_Reason_To_Believe_Field_Guidance_Pertaining_to_Applicants_for_Provisional_Unlawful_Presence_Waivers-final.pdf\nhttp://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/nativedocuments/2014-0124_Reason_To_Believe_Field_Guidance_Pertaining_to_Applicants_for_Provisional_Unlawful_Presence_Waivers-final.pdf\nhttp://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/nativedocuments/2014-0124_Reason_To_Believe_Field_Guidance_Pertaining_to_Applicants_for_Provisional_Unlawful_Presence_Waivers-final.pdf\n\n\nautomatic revocation of an approved provisional waiver application if the DOS consular officer ultimately determines \nthat the applicant is ineligible for the immigrant visa based on other grounds of inadmissibility. See 8 CFR \n212.7(e)(14)(i). DHS thus cautions and reminds individuals that even if USCIS approves a provisional waiver \napplication, DOS may still find the applicant inadmissible on other grounds at the time of the immigrant visa \ninterview. If DOS finds the applicant ineligible for the immigrant visa or inadmissible on grounds other than \nunlawful presence, the approval of the provisional waiver application is automatically revoked. In such cases, the \nindividual may again apply for a waiver of the unlawful presence ground of inadmissibility, in combination with any \nother waivable grounds of inadmissibility, by using the Form I-601 waiver process. As in all discretionary matters, \nDHS also has the authority to deny provisional waiver applications as a matter of discretion even if the applicant \nsatisfies the eligibility criteria. See 8 CFR 212.7(e)(2)(i). Additionally, USCIS may reopen and reconsider its decision \nto approve or deny a provisional waiver before or after the waiver becomes effective if it is determined that the \ndecision was made in error. See 8 CFR 212.7(e)(13) and 8 CFR 212.7(a)(4)(v). As has always been the case, DHS \nwill continue to uphold the integrity and security of the provisional waiver process by conducting full background and \nsecurity checks to assess whether an individual may be a threat to national security or public safety. If the \nbackground check or the individual's immigration file reveals derogatory information, including a criminal record, \nUSCIS will analyze the significance of the information and may deny the provisional waiver application as a matter \nof discretion.\\27\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\27\\ Under current USCIS policy, officers \nadjudicating provisional waiver applications may issue a Request for Evidence (RFE) to address deficiencies in the \nextreme hardship showing or to resolve issues that may impact their exercise of discretion. USCIS will retain this \npractice. To maintain the streamlined nature of the program, USCIS retains the 30-day response time to any RFE \nissued in connection with provisional waiver applications. See USCIS Memorandum, Standard Timeframe for \nApplicants to Respond to Requests for Evidence Issued in Relation to a Request for a Provisional Unlawful \nPresence Waiver, Form I-601A (Mar. 1, 2013), available at            \nhttp://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/Static_Files_Memoranda/2013/I-601A_30-\nDay_RFE_PM.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Finally, the extreme hardship and \ndiscretionary eligibility assessments made during a provisional waiver adjudication could be impacted by additional \ngrounds of inadmissibility and other information that was not known and therefore not considered during the \nadjudication. Accordingly, USCIS is not bound by these determinations when adjudicating subsequent applications \nfiled by the same applicant, such as an application filed to waive grounds of inadmissibility, including a waiver of the \nunlawful presence grounds of inadmissibility. In other words, because separate inadmissibility grounds and material \ninformation not before USCIS at the time of adjudication may alter the totality of the circumstances present in an \nindividual's case, a prior determination that an applicant's U.S. citizen or LPR spouse would suffer extreme hardship \nif the applicant were refused admission (and that the applicant merits a provisional waiver as a matter of discretion) \ndoes not dictate that USCIS must make the same determination in the future, although the factors and \ncircumstances underlying the prior decision may be taken into account when reviewing the cases under the totality \nof the circumstances. 7. Individuals With Scheduled Immigrant Visa Interviews The proposed rule would have \nmade certain immediate relatives of U.S. citizens ineligible for provisional waivers if DOS had initially acted before \nJanuary 3, 2013 to schedule their immigrant visa interviews. DHS had also proposed to make other applicants \nineligible if DOS initially acted before the effective date of this final rule to schedule their immigrant visa interviews. \nSee 80 FR 43338, 43343 (July 22, 2015). These date restrictions were intended to make the provisional waiver \nprocess more operationally manageable and to avoid processing delays in the immigrant visa process. \nCommenters suggested that DHS either eliminate these restrictions or apply the January 3, 2013 restriction to all \npotential applicants.\\28\\ Some commenters argued that DHS should eliminate these restrictions altogether for \nhumanitarian reasons. Other commenters pointed out that the cutoff dates will cause preference-based immigrants \ndifficulties with their priority dates. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\28\\ One commenter \nalso asked that DHS allow individuals to reopen their ``visa cases'' and to file applications for provisional waivers. \nThe commenter explained that many individuals let their DOS National Visa Center (NVC) cases lapse because \nthey cannot leave to seek their visas and because ameliorative immigration legislation had failed to pass. The \ncommenter asked that the DOS NVC reopen cases for those who have approved petitions so that they may apply \nfor provisional waivers. DHS will not adopt this suggestion. DOS-- and not DHS--will continue to determine whether \nto reopen immigrant visa application cases. Any visa applicant seeking to reopen such a case should consult with \nDOS. An individual may file a provisional waiver if he or she meets the provisional waiver requirements, as outlined \n\nhttp://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/Static_Files_Memoranda/2013/I-601A_30-Day_RFE_PM.pdf\nhttp://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/Static_Files_Memoranda/2013/I-601A_30-Day_RFE_PM.pdf\n\n\nin 8 CFR 212.7(e). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In response to comments, and after \nconsulting with DOS, DHS is eliminating the restrictions based on the date that DOS acted to schedule the \nimmigrant visa interview. USCIS will adjust its processing of petitions and applications so that neither DOS nor \nUSCIS will be adversely affected by the elimination of this restriction. Please note, however, that elimination of \nthese date restrictions does not alter other laws and regulations relating to the availability of immigrant visas. \nApplicants will still be unable to obtain immigrant visas until an immigrant visa number is available based on the \napplicant's priority date. Applicants will need to act promptly, once DOS notifies them that they can file their \nimmigrant visa application. If applicants do not apply within one year of this notice, DOS has authority to terminate \ntheir registration for an immigrant visa. See INA section 203(g), 8 U.S.C. 1153(g); see also 22 CFR 42.8(a). That \naction will also result in automatic revocation of the approval of the related immigrant visa petition. 8 CFR \n205.1(a)(1). In such a situation, applicants will have two options for continuing to pursue a provisional waiver. One \noption is for an applicant to ask DOS to reinstate the registration pursuant to 22 CFR 42.83(d). If DOS reinstates the \nregistration, approval of the immigrant visa petition is also reinstated. Once such an applicant has paid the \nimmigrant visa processing fee for the related immigrant visa application, the applicant can apply for a provisional \nwaiver. A second option is for the [[Page 50255]] relevant immigrant visa petitioner to file a new immigrant visa \npetition with USCIS. If USCIS approves the new immigrant visa petition, the beneficiary could then apply for the \nprovisional waiver after paying the immigrant visa processing fee based on the new petition if otherwise eligible. 8. \nIndividuals in Removal Proceedings Commenters requested that DHS eliminate restrictions that prevent individuals \nin removal proceedings from seeking provisional waivers. Under the current regulations, those in removal \nproceedings may apply for and be granted provisional waivers only if their removal proceedings have been and \nremain administratively closed. See 8 CFR 212.7(e)(4)(v). Rather than excluding individuals whose removal \nproceedings are not administratively closed from obtaining provisional waivers, commenters asserted that DHS \nshould find a way to allow them to apply for such waivers. Commenters suggested that once an individual in \nremoval proceedings has a provisional waiver, he or she should be able to move to either dismiss or terminate \nproceedings or seek cancellation of the Notice to Appear (NTA) \\29\\ so that he or she may depart to seek consular \nprocessing of an immigrant visa application. According to commenters, such a process would also ensure that an \nindividual who is issued an NTA while his or her provisional waiver application is pending does not automatically \nbecome ineligible for the waiver. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\29\\ Notices to Appear \n(NTAs) are the charging documents that DHS issues to individuals to initiate removal proceedings. ----------------------\n----------------------------------------------------- Another commenter noted that immigration courts are severely backlogged \nand that individuals in removal proceedings often have to wait months or years before their cases can be scheduled \nor heard. This commenter asserted that requiring the case to be administratively closed before an individual may \napply for the provisional waiver places an undue burden on the courts and also creates significant delays. \nCommenters generally believed that it would be more efficient if individuals were able to pursue provisional waivers \nand request termination or dismissal of proceedings upon approval of the waivers. They requested that the \nregulations and the provisional waiver application (Form I-601A) clarify that removal proceedings may be resolved \nby termination, dismissal, or a grant of voluntary departure if the provisional waiver is approved. Commenters \nbelieved that such a solution would simplify the provisional waiver process, improve efficiency in the immigration \ncourt system, and further the spirit of expanding the process to all individuals who are statutorily eligible for waivers \nof the unlawful presence ground of inadmissibility at INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B)(i). Due to \nagency efficiency and resource concerns, DHS declines to adopt the above recommendations. On November 20, \n2014, the Secretary directed the Department's immigration components--USCIS, ICE, and CBP-- to exercise \nprosecutorial discretion, when appropriate, as early as possible in proceedings to ensure that DHS's limited \nresources are devoted to the greatest degree possible to the pursuit of enforcement priorities.\\30\\ Prosecutorial \ndiscretion applies not only to the decision to issue, serve, file, or cancel an NTA, but also to other broad ranges of \ndiscretionary measures.\\31\\ To promote docket efficiency and to ensure that finite enforcement resources are used \neffectively, ICE carefully reviews cases pending before the Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration \nReview (EOIR) to ensure that all cases align with the agency's enforcement and removal policies. As such, once an \nNTA is issued, ICE attorneys are directed to review the case, at the earliest opportunity, for the potential exercise of \nprosecutorial discretion.\\32\\ The Department of Justice (DOJ) likewise instructs its immigration judges to use \navailable docketing tools to ensure fair and timely resolution of cases, and to ask ICE attorneys at master calendar \nhearings whether ICE is seeking dismissal or administrative closure of a case.\\33\\ In general, those who are low \n\n\n\npriorities for removal and are otherwise eligible for LPR status may be able to apply for provisional waivers. Among \nother things, ICE may agree to administratively close immigration proceedings for individuals who are eligible to \npursue a provisional waiver and are not currently considered a DHS enforcement priority. ICE also works to \nfacilitate, as appropriate, the timely termination or dismissal of administratively closed removal proceedings once \nUSCIS approves a provisional waiver. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\30\\ See \nMemorandum from Secretary Jeh Charles Johnson, DHS, Policies for Apprehension, Detention, and Removal of \nUndocumented Immigrants (Nov. 20, 2014), available at            \n\nconditioned on the applicant subsequently departing the United States. Thus, if an individual who is inadmissible \nunder INA section 212(a)(9)(A), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(A), obtains a conditional approval of his or her Form I-212 \napplication while in the United States and thereafter departs to attend the immigrant visa interview abroad, he or \nshe generally is no longer inadmissible under that section at the time of the immigrant visa interview and can be \nissued an immigrant visa. Given that an applicant still has to demonstrate visa eligibility, including admissibility, at \nthe time of the immigrant visa interview and that DHS has decided to eliminate the reason-to-believe standard, the \nDepartment believes the goals of the provisional waiver process are supported by making it available to those with \nfinal orders only if they already have conditionally approved a Form I-212 application. The final rule thus extends \neligibility for provisional waivers to such individuals. See 8 CFR 212.7(e)(4)(iv). Such an individual, however, must \nhave the conditionally approved Form I-212 application at the time of filing the provisional waiver application. See 8 \nCFR 212.7(e)(4)(iv). USCIS will deny a provisional waiver application if the applicant's Form I-212 application has \nnot yet been conditionally approved at the time the individual files his or her provisional waiver application. \nAdditionally, if during the immigrant visa interview the consular officer finds that the applicant is inadmissible on \nother grounds that have not been waived, the approved provisional waiver will be automatically revoked.\\35\\ See 8 \nCFR 212.7(e)(14)(i). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\35\\ In such cases, however, the \napproved Form I-212 application will generally remain valid and the individual may apply for any available waivers, \nincluding waiver of the 3- and 10-year bars, by filing a Form I-601 application after the immigrant visa interview. ----\n----------------------------------------------------------------------- Finally, DHS notes that approval of Forms I-601A and I-212 \ndoes not waive inadmissibility under INA section 212(a)(9)(C), 8 U.S.C 1182(a)(9)(C), for having returned to the \nUnited States without inspection and admission or parole after a prior removal or prior unlawful presence. See INA \nsection 212(a)(9)(C)(ii), 8 U.S.C 1182(a)(9)(C)(ii); Matter of Briones, 24 I&N Dec. 355 (BIA 2007); Matter of Torres-\nGarcia, 23 I&N Dec. 866 (BIA 2006).\\36\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\36\\ Although \nDHS received no comments on the issue, DHS has also amended the regulatory text to provide additional clarity \nwith respect to provisional waiver eligibility for certain individuals who have previously been removed. Prior to the \nchanges made by this rule, 8 CFR 212.7(e)(4)(vii) provided that an alien who is ``subject to reinstatement of a prior \nremoval order under section 241(a)(5) of the Act'' is not eligible for a provisional waiver. DHS recognizes that this \nregulatory text was unclear with respect to whether it applies to (1) an individual who is a ``candidate'' for \nreinstatement of removal or (2) an individual whose prior removal order has already been reinstated. To avoid \nconfusion, DHS has amended the regulatory text in 8 CFR 212.7(e)(4)(v) to clarify that the prior removal order must \nactually be reinstated for an individual to be ineligible to apply for a provisional waiver under this provision. DHS \nnotes, however, that USCIS is likely to deny as a matter of discretion a provisional waiver application when records \nindicate that the applicant is inadmissible under INA 212(a)(9)(C), 8 U.S.C 1182(a)(9)(C), for having unlawfully \nreturned to the United States after a prior removal or prior unlawful presence. Moreover, even if such an individual \nobtains approval for a provisional waiver, such approval will be automatically revoked if he or she is ultimately \ndetermined to be inadmissible under that section. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10. \nIndividuals Granted Voluntary Departure Commenters requested that DHS address how voluntary departure under \nINA section 240B, 8 U.S.C. 1229c, affects provisional waiver eligibility. One commenter asked that USCIS provide \neligibility for provisional waivers to individuals who have been granted voluntary departure but who failed to depart \nas required. Another commenter requested that regulations and instructions should clarify that an individual in \ncompliance with an order of voluntary departure is considered by USCIS: (a) Not to be currently in removal \nproceedings; and (b) not subject to a final order of removal. DHS has determined that individuals granted voluntary \ndeparture will not be eligible for provisional waivers. First, if an individual obtains voluntary departure while in \nremoval proceedings, the immigration judge is required by law to enter an alternate order of removal. See 8 CFR \n1240.26(d). DHS cannot execute the alternate order of removal during the voluntary departure period because such \nan order is not yet in effect. But if the individual does not depart as required under the order of voluntary departure, \nthe alternate order of removal automatically becomes fully effective without any additional proceeding. See 8 CFR \n1240.26(d). Thus, an individual who fails to leave as required under a grant of voluntary departure will have an \nadministratively final order of removal, and will thus be ineligible for a provisional waiver. See INA section \n240B(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. 1229c(d)(1); 8 CFR 212.7(e)(4)(iv). Under current law, removal proceedings for such \nindividuals are considered to have ended when the grant of voluntary departure, with an alternate removal order, \nbecomes administratively final. See INA sections 101(a)(47), 240(c)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(47), 1229(a)(c)(1)(A); 8 \nCFR 241.1, 1003.39, 1241.1; Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993). Second, a fundamental premise for a \n\n\n\ngrant of voluntary departure is that the individual who is granted voluntary departure intends to leave the United \nStates as required. See INA section 240B(b)(1)(D), 8 U.S.C. 1229c(b)(1)(D); Dada v. Mukasey, 554 U.S. 1, 18 \n(2008). Allowing an individual whose voluntary departure period has not expired to apply for a provisional waiver \nwould suggest that the individual is excused from complying with the order of voluntary departure. This result would \ncontradict the purpose of voluntary departure--allowing the subject to leave promptly [[Page 50257]] without \nincurring the future inadmissibility that results from removal. For these reasons, DHS did not modify the rule to \nallow those with grants of voluntary departure to apply for provisional waivers. 11. Applications for Lawful \nPermanent Resident (LPR) Status Under current regulations, an individual is ineligible for a provisional waiver if he \nor she has an Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, Form I-485 (``application for \nadjustment of status''), pending with USCIS, regardless of whether the individual is in removal proceedings. See 8 \nCFR 212.7(e)(4)(viii). One commenter suggested that USCIS should allow those seeking LPR status to file \napplications for adjustment of status concurrently with provisional waiver applications, and that USCIS should hold \nsuch applications for adjustment of status in abeyance until final resolution of the provisional waiver applications. \nAccording to the commenter, this would provide applicants present in the United States the opportunity to obtain \nwork authorization and to appeal any denial of their provisional waiver applications. The commenter suggested that \nupon approval of a provisional waiver application, USCIS should route the application for adjustment of status to \nDOS for consular processing of the applicant's immigrant visa abroad. DHS declines to adopt this suggestion. \nDHS believes that the commenter misunderstands the purpose of filing applications for adjustment of status. Those \napplications may be filed only by individuals who are in the United States and meet the statutory requirements for \nadjustment of status. If the applicant is eligible for adjustment of status, approval of the application adjusts one's \nstatus to that of an LPR in the United States, thus making it unnecessary to go abroad and obtain an immigrant \nvisa. For those who are in the United States but are not eligible for adjustment of status, filing an application for \nadjustment of status serves no legitimate purpose. These individuals may not adjust status in the United States and \nmust instead depart the United States and seek an immigrant visa at a U.S. consulate through consular \nprocessing. As these individuals are not eligible for adjustment of status, DHS believes it is inappropriate to invite \nthem to submit applications seeking adjustment of status. Moreover, DOS has its own application process for \nimmigrant visas. Thus, even if USCIS were to forward a denied application for adjustment of status to DOS, that \napplication would have no role in the individual's application process with DOS. The individual would still be \nrequired to submit the proper DOS immigrant visa application to seek his or her immigrant visa. 12. Additional \nEligibility Criteria A few commenters suggested that DHS consider imposing restrictions in the provisional waiver \nprocess, including by adding eligibility criteria for provisional waivers, to better prioritize the classes of individuals \neligible to seek such waivers.\\37\\ Two commenters suggested that the provisional waiver process should prioritize \nfamily members of U.S. citizens over those of LPRs. One commenter suggested using level of education as a factor \nfor prioritizing applicants. This commenter implied that applicants should be prioritized if they have advanced \ndegrees in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics fields. Additional suggestions included: (1) Making \nprovisional waivers easier to obtain for couples who have children or have been married more than two years; (2) \nlimiting the number or percentage of waivers that are made available to particular demographic groups within the \nUnited States; (3) combining eligibility for provisional waivers with ``cross- chargeability'' rules in the INA; \\38\\ (4) \nprioritizing waivers for those with high school degrees or who paid their taxes; (5) making waivers available only to \nthose who submit three letters of recommendation from community members; and (6) making waivers available \nonly to those who can demonstrate proficiency with the English language or who enroll in English language classes. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\37\\ Many of the commenters who suggested additional \neligibility criteria also believed that approved waivers should entitle individuals to adjust to LPR status in the United \nStates. Others suggested that provisional waiver applicants should pay fines, and some of these commenters \nbelieved that paying fines should allow individuals to apply for adjustment of status as an alternative to consular \nprocessing. Many of these commenters believed that such changes would create efficiencies for both the applicant \nand the government. As explained throughout this rule, DHS cannot change the statutory requirements for \nadjustment of status in the United States. Similarly, USCIS cannot impose fines as part of its filing fees. \\38\\ Cross-\nchargeability is a concept employed by the INA in the context of applying the INA's numerical limits on immigrant \nvisas, particularly the ``per country'' limitations that restrict the percentage of such visa numbers that may go to \nnationals of any one country. See generally INA sections 201, 202, and 203; 8 U.S.C. 1151, 1152, and 1153. \nGenerally, an immigrant visa number that is allotted to an individual is ``charged'' to the country of his or her \n\n\n\nnationality. However, when application of the ``per country'' limits may lead to family separation, the immigrant visa \nnumber allotted to an individual may instead be charged to the country of nationality of that individual's spouse, \nparent, or child. See INA sections 202(b), 8 U.S.C. 1152(b); see also 22 CFR 42.12; Department of State, 9 Foreign \nAffairs Manual (FAM) ch. 503.2-4A, available at            https://fam.state.gov/FAM/09FAM/09FAM050302.html (last \nvisited Apr. 26, 2016). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- DHS declines to impose limitations \nor eligibility requirements for obtaining provisional waivers beyond those currently provided by regulation or statute. \nSee INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(v), 8 U.S.C 1182(a)(9)(B)(v); 8 CFR 212.7. In the 2013 Rule, DHS originally limited \neligibility to seek such waivers through the provisional waiver process to ensure operational feasibility and reduce \nthe risk of creating processing delays with respect to other petitions or applications filed with USCIS or DOS. \nConsidering the agency's capacity and the efficiencies gained through the provisional waiver process, DHS now \nbelieves that the provisional waiver process should be made available to all statutorily eligible individuals. DHS is \nconfident that the expansion will reduce family separation and benefit the U.S. Government as a whole, and that all \nagencies involved possess the operational capacity to handle the additional casework. 13. Bars for Certain \nInadmissible Individuals Two commenters suggested that those who have committed crimes should be precluded \nfrom participating in the provisional waiver process, and another commenter cautioned DHS against adopting a \nstandard that would allow provisional waiver eligibility to the ``wrong people,'' in the commenter's view, such as \nthose who hate American values and principles.\\39\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\39\\ \nOne of these commenters believed that, although accrual of unlawful presence is not desirable, serious criminality \nand evidence of violent behavior should be the deciding factors when determining whether to separate families. \nAbsent these factors, the commenter reasoned, immediate family members of U.S. citizens and LPRs should be \nallowed to remain with their loved ones in the United States before consular processing. ------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------- As indicated above, DHS continues to uphold the integrity and security of the \nprovisional waiver process by conducting full background and security checks to assess whether an applicant may \nbe a threat to national security or public safety. If the background check or the applicant's immigration file reveals \nderogatory information, including a criminal record, USCIS analyzes the significance of the information and may \ndeny the provisional waiver application as a matter of discretion. [[Page 50258]] D. Adjudication 1. Requests for \nEvidence (RFEs) and Notices of Intent To Deny (NOIDs) Several commenters criticized USCIS' practice with \nrespect to issuing Requests for Evidence (RFEs) or Notices of Intent to Deny (NOIDs) in cases where the agency \nultimately denies provisional waiver applications. Commenters criticized USCIS for both (1) issuing denials without \nfirst submitting RFEs that provide applicants the opportunity to correct deficiencies, and (2) issuing RFEs that failed \nto clearly articulate the deficiencies in submitted applications. With respect to the latter, commenters indicated that \nRFEs tend to use boilerplate language that makes it impossible for applicants to respond effectively, especially with \nrespect to assessments of extreme hardship or application of the reason-to-believe standard. Noting that terms \nsuch as ``reason to believe'' and ``extreme hardship'' are vague, commenters requested that USCIS issue detailed \nand case-specific RFEs or NOIDs (rather than templates) when the agency intends to deny applications, thereby \ngiving applicants an opportunity to cure any deficiencies before such denials are issued.\\40\\ Commenters also \nraised concerns with the number of days that USCIS provides applicants to respond to often lengthy RFEs, noting \nthat, in most instances, USCIS provides only 30 days for such responses. -------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------- \\40\\ One commenter requested that USCIS ensure transparent processing of applications. USCIS is \ncommitted to providing processing information on its adjudication processes by including information on the form \nand its instructions. USCIS also intends to include a section in the USCIS Policy Manual on provisional waivers. ----\n----------------------------------------------------------------------- As provided in 8 CFR 212.7(e)(8), and notwithstanding 8 \nCFR 103.2(b)(16), USCIS may deny a provisional waiver without issuing an RFE or NOID. USCIS, however, is \ncommitted to issuing RFEs to address missing and critical information that relates to extreme hardship or that may \naffect how USCIS exercises its discretion. USCIS officers also have the discretion to issue RFEs whenever the \nofficer believes that additional evidence would aid in the adjudication of an application. Due to the streamlined \nnature of the program, USCIS currently provides applicants only 30 days to respond to an RFE in such cases.\\41\\ --\n------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\41\\ See USCIS Memorandum, Standard Timeframe for \nApplicants to Response to Requests for Evidence Issued in Relation to a Request for a Provisional Unlawful \nPresence Waiver, Form I-601A (Mar. 1, 2013), available at            \n\nprovisional waiver cases based on the current USCIS RFE policy \\42\\ and to assess the effectiveness of its RFE \npractice in this area. In response to comments, however, the agency has instructed its officers to provide additional \ndetail regarding application deficiencies in RFEs relating to claims of extreme hardship in order to better allow \napplicants to efficiently and effectively cure such deficiencies. USCIS will retain the 30-day RFE response period, \nbecause USCIS and DOS closely coordinate immigrant visa and provisional waiver application processing. The \n30-day RFE response time streamlines USCIS processing, prevents lengthy delays at DOS, and allows applicants \nto complete immigrant visa processing in a timely manner. --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n- \\42\\ See USCIS Memorandum, Requests for Evidence and Notices of Intent to Deny (June 3, 2013), available at       \n     \n\n845, 850 (9th Cir. 2003); Mendoza v. U.S. Att'y Gen., 327 F.3d 1283, 1289 (11th Cir. 2003); Albathani v. INS, 318 \nF.3d 365, 376 (1st Cir. 2003); Guentchev v. INS, 77 F.3d 1036, 1037-38 (7th Cir. 1996). ------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------- Moreover, the provisional waiver process is intended to be a streamlined process that \nis closely coordinated with DOS immigrant visa processing. Holding cases during an administrative appeal of a \nprovisional waiver application would produce logistical complications for the respective agencies, interrupting the \nregular adjudication flow, and therefore would be counterproductive to streamlining efforts. 3. Confidentiality \nProvisions As with the 2013 Rule, commenters asked DHS to include confidentiality protections so that denials of \nprovisional waiver applications would not automatically trigger removal proceedings. The commenters asserted that \nthe Department should provide regulatory assurances stating that DHS will not put provisional waiver applicants in \nremoval proceedings, even if their applications are denied. According to the commenters, such assurances were \nnecessary because a new Administration might institute a change in policy in this area. DHS declines to adopt \nthese suggestions as the Department already has effective policies on these issues. DHS focuses its resources on \nits enforcement priorities, namely threats to national security, border security, or public safety.\\44\\ Similarly, USCIS \ncontinues to follow current agency policy on the issuance of NTAs, which are focused on public safety threats, \ncriminals, and those engaged in fraud.\\45\\ Consistent with DHS enforcement policies and priorities, the Department \nwill not initiate removal proceedings against individuals who are not enforcement priorities solely because they filed \nor withdrew provisional waiver applications, or because USCIS denied such applications. -----------------------------------\n---------------------------------------- \\44\\ See Memorandum from Secretary Jeh Charles Johnson, DHS, Policies for \nApprehension, Detention, and Removal of Undocumented Immigrants (Nov. 20, 2014), available at            \n\nvisa interviews at consular posts. The delay in the adjudication of provisional waiver applications that would result \nfrom allowing additional procedural steps would decrease the efficiencies derived from the provisional waiver \nprocess and thus be counterproductive to these streamlining efforts. As indicated previously in this preamble, \nhowever, DHS will allow an individual who has been approved for consent to reapply for admission under 8 CFR \n212.2(j) to seek a provisional waiver. By allowing individuals with conditionally approved Form I-212 applications to \napply for provisional waivers, DHS further expands the class of eligible individuals who can benefit from provisional \nwaivers and, at the same time, maintains the program's streamlined efficiency. 2. Fines or Penalties Several \ncommenters believed that DHS should require provisional waiver applicants to pay fines or fees of up to several \nthousand dollars to remain in the United States and obtain LPR status. Other commenters appeared to suggest that \nDHS should generally impose financial penalties on individuals unlawfully in the United States. Congress has given \nthe Secretary the authority to administer and enforce the immigration and naturalization laws of the United States. \nSee 6 U.S.C. 112, 202(3)-(5); see also INA section 103, 8 U.S.C. 1103(a). The Secretary also is authorized to set \nfiling fees for immigration benefits at a level that will ensure recovery of the full costs of [[Page 50260]] providing \nadjudication and naturalization services, including services provided without charge to refugees, asylum applicants, \nand other immigrants. See INA section 286(m), 8 U.S.C. 1356(m). This fee revenue remains available to DHS to \nprovide immigration and naturalization benefits. See INA section 286(n), 8 U.S.C. 1356(n). DHS has already \nestablished an appropriate filing fee for the Form I-601A application as authorized by the statute. Congress, \nhowever, has not imposed a specific fine or penalty on provisional waiver applicants or individuals unlawfully \npresent in the United States. Congress also did not authorize any type of independent lawful status for such \napplicants. Such fines, as with a general fine for unlawful presence, would be unrelated to the costs incurred during \nthe adjudication of immigration benefits. USCIS does not have the authority to impose such civil penalties. 3. Fees \nDHS received several comments related to fees. One commenter noted that Congress has already approved DHS's \nfunding for this fiscal year, and that Congress did not authorize changes to the Department's budget. The \ncommenter thus requested an explanation as to why DHS believes that funding is available to effectuate the \nchanges proposed by this rule. Another commenter believed that DHS and DOS should return immigrant visa fees \nto applicants if their provisional waiver applications are ultimately denied. One commenter stated that the derivative \nspouses of primary beneficiaries should pay separate application fees. In contrast to many other U.S. Government \nagencies, USCIS does not rely on appropriated funds for most of its budget. Rather, USCIS is a fee-based agency \nthat is primarily funded by the fees paid by applicants and petitioners seeking immigration benefits. USCIS relies on \nthese fees to fund the adjudication of provisional waiver applications; none of the funds used for these adjudications \ncomes from funds appropriated annually by Congress. Furthermore, as noted above, the fees received with \nprovisional waiver applications and immigrant visa petitions cover the costs of adjudication. These fees are \nnecessary regardless of whether the application or petition is ultimately approved or denied. Therefore, USCIS does \nnot return fees when a petition, application, or request is denied. For its part, DOS determines its own fees pursuant \nto its own authorities. See, e.g., INA section 104, 8 U.S.C. 1104; 8 U.S.C. 1714; see also 22 CFR 22.1, 42.71(b). \nFinally, an individual who applies for a provisional waiver must submit the application with the appropriate filing and \nbiometrics fees, as outlined in the form's instructions and 8 CFR 103.7, even if the individual is a derivative \nbeneficiary. 4. Premium Processing A few commenters recommended that DHS establish a premium processing \nfee to expedite processing of provisional waiver applications. One commenter indicated that the processing time for \na provisional waiver application should not exceed 30 days under premium processing. DHS declines to adopt the \nsuggestion to extend premium processing to provisional waiver applications. The INA permits certain employment- \nbased petitioners and applicants for immigration benefits to request premium processing for a fee. See INA section \n286(u), 8 U.S.C. 1356(u). DHS has established the current premium processing fee at $1,225.\\47\\ See 8 CFR \n103.7(b)(1)(i)(RR); see also 8 CFR 103.7(e) (describing the premium processing service). The premium processing \nfee, which is paid in addition to the base filing fee, guarantees that USCIS processes a benefit request within 15 \ndays. See 8 CFR 103.7(e)(2). If USCIS cannot take action within 15 days, USCIS refunds the premium processing \nfee.\\48\\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\47\\ The fee was originally set at $1,000, and \nmay be adjusted according to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). See INA section 286(u), 8 U.S.C. 1356(u). \\48\\ \nEven if USCIS refunds this fee, USCIS generally continues expedited processing of the benefit request. ---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------ DHS has not extended premium processing to any immigration \nbenefit except for those authorized under INA section 286(u), 8 U.S.C. 1356(u). Notably, INA section 286(u) \nexpressly authorizes premium processing only for employment-based petitions and applications. Even if USCIS \n\n\n\ncould develop an expedited processing fee for other benefits, USCIS would not apply it to the provisional waiver \nprocess, as that process requires background checks over which USCIS does not control timing. Additionally, \ndetermining an appropriate fee for such a new process would require USCIS to estimate the costs of that service \nand engage in separate notice-and-comment rulemaking to establish the new fee. Thus, DHS will not establish a \nForm I-601A premium processing fee at this time. 5. Expedited Processing One commenter stated that the \nprocessing time for a provisional waiver application should generally not exceed 30 days. Other commenters urged \nUSCIS to expedite the processing of applications for family members of active duty members or honorably \ndischarged veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces. One commenter asked that DHS and DOS expedite the immigrant \nvisa interviews of individuals with approved provisional waivers.\\49\\ ---------------------------------------------------------------\n------------ \\49\\ One commenter also urged CBP to expedite Freedom of Information Act requests so that individuals \nare able to obtain the information they need to assess eligibility and complete their applications. The commenter \nindicated that expanding the provisional waiver process is useless unless potential applicants are given access to \ntheir files. DHS declines to adopt this suggestion as it is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. -----------------------------\n---------------------------------------------- DHS did not incorporate these suggestions in this final rule. DHS believes the \nprovisional waiver process is well managed, and officers adjudicate cases quickly after receiving an applicant's \nbackground check results. Creating an expedited process for certain applicants, including relatives of military \nmembers and veterans, would create inefficiencies and potentially slow the process for all provisional waiver \napplicants.\\50\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\50\\ Each time USCIS has to set aside a \nregularly filed case to prioritize the adjudication of another case, it delays those cases that were filed prior to the \nprioritized case and disrupts the normal adjudication process. -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n---- Additionally, even if DHS were to expedite the provisional waiver process for certain applicants, they would still \nbe required to spend time navigating the DOS immigrant visa process. DHS believes that expediting the \nprocessing of provisional waiver applications for certain individuals would generally not significantly affect the \nprocessing time of their immigrant visa processing with DOS. Individuals often file their provisional waiver \napplications with USCIS while the DOS National Visa Center (NVC) pre-processes their immigrant visa \napplications. The NVC pre-processing of immigrant visa applications usually runs concurrently with the USCIS \nprocessing of provisional waiver applications. Thus, even if DHS were to expedite the provisional waiver process for \ncertain applicants, those applicants would nevertheless be required to wait for DOS to complete its process. \nAdditionally, the processing time for immigrant visa applications at the NVC largely depends on other outside \nfactors, including whether applicants submit necessary documents to the NVC on a timely basis throughout the \nprocess. In many cases, including those in which applicants [[Page 50261]] delay in getting necessary documents \nto the NVC, immigrant visa processing would not be affected by the expediting of other processes. DHS reminds \napplicants, however, that they may request expedited adjudication of a provisional waiver application according to \ncurrent USCIS expedite guidance.\\51\\ Also, relatives of current and former U.S. Armed Forces members may seek \nUSCIS assistance through the agency's special military help line.\\52\\ -------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------- \\51\\ For guidance on USCIS expedite procedures, please visit            \nhttp://www.uscis.gov/forms/expedite-criteria. \\52\\ Information about the military help line is available at            \nhttp://www.uscis.gov/military/military-help-line. DHS encourages military families that need assistance to reach out \nto USCIS through the help line. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6. Background Checks \nand Drug Testing One commenter requested that USCIS conduct background checks and drug testing for \nprovisional waiver applicants.\\53\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\53\\ Two commenters \nalso asked that USCIS allow provisional waiver applicants to include medical examinations performed by USCIS-\ndesignated civil surgeons with their provisional waiver applications. These commenters believed that the \nopportunity to provide the results of the medical examination before departure for the immigrant visa interview \nwould further streamline the process. The commenters also believed that applicants could either avoid the higher \npanel physician examination fee abroad, or detect and treat possible medical conditions that would render them \nineligible for their immigrant visas before departure. One of these commenters also indicated that such a process \nwould allow an applicant's representative to check the panel physician's work. DHS did not adopt this suggestion. \nUnder DOS regulations, each immigrant visa applicant must be examined by a DOS-designated panel physician, \nsee 22 CFR 42.66, and altering DHS regulations to permit submission of medical examinations with a provisional \nwaiver application would not eliminate that requirement. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nDHS is not modifying the background checks and biometrics requirement in this rule to include drug testing. \n\nhttp://www.uscis.gov/forms/expedite-criteria\nhttp://www.uscis.gov/military/military-help-line\n\n\nIndividuals seeking provisional waivers already must provide biometrics for background and security checks. Based \nin part on the background check results, USCIS determines whether the applicant is eligible for the waiver, \nincluding whether a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted. DHS only collects the biometric information \nneeded to run such checks and to adjudicate any requested immigration benefit. Additional testing, such as a \nmedical examination, is required within the DOS immigrant visa process and for DOS's visa eligibility \ndeterminations. Performing medical tests as part of the provisional waiver process would duplicate the DOS \nprocess. F. Comments Outside the Scope of This Rulemaking DHS received a number of comments that are \noutside the scope of this rule. For example, one commenter asked USCIS to publish guidance on whether an \nindividual who is subject to the 3- or 10-year unlawful presence bar, but who has already returned to the United \nStates, could satisfy the requisite inadmissibility period while in the United States. Other commenters suggested \nthat those with approved provisional waivers should be permitted to seek adjustment of status in the United States. \nMany asked DHS to extend the period for accepting adjustment of status applications pursuant to INA section \n245(i), 8 U.S.C. 1255(i). Others requested that DHS: create a new waiver for people who leave the United States \nbecause of family emergencies; make certain immigrant visa categories immediately available or create new \nimmigrant visa categories; Create new inadmissibility periods for purposes of INA sections 212(a)(9)(B)(i) and \n212(a)(9)(C), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B)(i) and 1182(a)(9)(C); and generally modify immigration laws, particularly those \nperceived as harsh. Other commenters requested changes to DOS consular processes or regulations, which are \nalso not within the scope of this rule. For example, commenters asked DHS to instruct DOS consular officers to \nissue immigrant visas to applicants with approved provisional waiver applications.\\54\\ One commenter criticized \nthe inability to appeal immigrant visa denials to DHS as unfair, even though DOS, not DHS, adjudicates immigrant \nvisa applications. See generally 22 CFR part 42. Similarly, another commenter stated that individuals whose \nimmigrant visa applications have been denied by DOS must be allowed to reopen those applications so that they \ncan be allowed to file provisional waiver applications.\\55\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\\54\\ To the extent that these comments are read to suggest that DOS should issue immigrant visas to individuals \nwith approved provisional waiver applications without assessing whether such individuals are inadmissible for other \nreasons, DHS believes those comments are outside the scope of this rulemaking. To the extent that the comments \nare read to suggest that DOS should not re- adjudicate or ``second-guess'' USCIS's provisional waiver \ndeterminations, DHS notes that DOS does not reassess USCIS' provisional waiver determination. DOS, however, is \nrequired to assess whether an individual is ineligible for an immigrant visa, including whether an applicant is \ninadmissible. If the individual is inadmissible on a ground other than unlawful presence, or is otherwise ineligible for \nthe immigrant visa, DOS may deny the individual's immigrant visa application, even if the provisional waiver was \napproved. \\55\\ As with other DOS processes, review of the denial of a visa application is governed by DOS \nregulations, not DHS regulations. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Because DHS believes \nthat these suggestions are outside the scope of this rule, the suggestions will not be addressed in this rule. G. \nComments on the Executive Orders 12866/13563 Analysis In one comment requesting that the DOS visa interview \nscheduling cut-off date be eliminated as an ineligibility requirement, the commenter cited DHS's acknowledgement \nthat the 2013 Rule's provisional waiver application projections were overestimated. Because of the overestimation \nin the 2013 Rule, the commenter suggested that DHS likely overestimated provisional waiver applications resulting \nfrom the 2015 Proposed Rule. Since publication of the 2015 Proposed Rule, DHS has adjusted its application \nprojection method based on new, revised data from DOS and this rule's new provisional waiver eligibility criteria. \nDHS believes this new method will better project the provisional waiver applications resulting from the rule. DHS \nreceived many comments affirming the benefits of the provisional unlawful presence waiver described in the 2015 \nProposed Rule. Commenters agreed that the provisional waiver's expansion would provide greater certainty for \nfamilies, promote family unity, improve administrative efficiency, improve communication between DHS and other \ngovernment agencies, facilitate immigrant visa issuance, save time and resources, and relieve the emotional and \nfinancial hardships that family members experience from separation. DHS also received several economic-related \ncomments that were outside the scope of this rule. Several commenters mentioned that obtaining legal status, \nwhich both the provisional and general unlawful presence waivers may facilitate, provides a significant benefit to the \nundocumented individual as well as American society. According to the commenters, this is because obtaining legal \nstatus tends to increase taxable income, reduce poverty, contribute to job growth, help businesses gain qualified \nemployees, and add to consumer spending. Although DHS agrees that obtaining legal status provides important \neconomic benefits to once-undocumented individuals, and the United States in general, those benefits are not \n\n\n\ndirectly attributable to the provisional waiver eligibility [[Page 50262]] provided by this rule. Rather, obtaining a \nwaiver of the unlawful presence ground of inadmissibility (provisional or not) is just one step in the process for \ngaining legal status, which USCIS hopes this rule will facilitate. A different commenter asserted that non-U.S. \ncitizen workers hurt the economy. DHS disagrees with this comment and finds that it is beyond the scope of this \nrule because obtaining a waiver of inadmissibility (provisional or not) for unlawful presence does not provide \nemployment authorization for someone who is unlawfully present. Receiving such a waiver is just one step in the \nprocess for gaining the legal status required to lawfully work in the United States. IV. Regulatory Amendments After \ncareful consideration of the public comments, as previously summarized in this preamble, DHS adopts the \nregulatory amendments in the proposed rule without change, except for the provisions noted below. In addition to \nthese substantive changes, DHS also has made edits to the text of various provisions that do not change the \nsubstance of the proposed rule. A. Amending 8 CFR 212.7(e)(1) To Clarify Which Agency Has Jurisdiction To \nAdjudicate Provisional Waivers Currently, 8 CFR 212.7(e)(1) specifies that all provisional waiver applications, \nincluding an application made by an individual in removal proceedings before EOIR, must be filed with USCIS. The \nprovision implies, but does not specifically state, that USCIS has exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate and decide \nprovisional waivers. With this final rule, DHS modifies the regulatory text to clarify that USCIS has exclusive \njurisdiction, regardless of whether the applicant is or was in removal, deportation, or exclusion proceedings. See \nnew 8 CFR 212.7(e)(2). B. Removing the Reason-to-Believe Standard as a Basis for Ineligibility Under the 2013 \nRule, an individual is ineligible for a provisional waiver if ``USCIS has reason to believe that the alien may be \nsubject to grounds of inadmissibility other than unlawful presence under INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(I) or (II), 8 \nU.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B)(I) or (II), at the time of the immigrant visa interview with the Department of State.'' 8 CFR \n212.7(e)(4)(i). The 2015 Proposed Rule proposed to retain this requirement but requested any alternatives that may \nbe more effective than the current provisional waiver process or the amended process in the proposed rule. See 80 \nFR 43343. In response to comments, DHS is removing this standard as a basis for ineligibility for provisional \nwaivers. See new 8 CFR 212.7(e)(4). DHS, however, retains 8 CFR 212.7(e)(14)(i), which provides that a \nprovisional waiver is automatically revoked if DOS determines, at the time of the immigrant visa interview, that the \napplicant is inadmissible on any grounds of inadmissibility other than unlawful presence under INA section \n212(a)(9)(B), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B). Revocation of the provisional waiver based on inadmissibility on other \ngrounds, however, does not prevent the individual from applying for a general waiver under 8 CFR 212.7(a) to cure \nhis or her inadmissibility under INA section 212(a)(9)(B), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B) or any other ground of \ninadmissibility for which a waiver is available. C. Removing the DOS Visa Interview Scheduling Cut-Off Dates in 8 \nCFR 212.7(e)(4)(iv) and 212.7(e)(5)(ii)(G) In the proposed rule, DHS sought to retain date restrictions that \nprevented immediate relatives of U.S. citizens from obtaining provisional waivers if DOS acted prior to January 3, \n2013 to schedule their immigrant visa interviews. See 80 FR at 43343. DHS also proposed that other individuals \n(i.e., individuals other than certain immediate relatives of U.S. citizens) would be ineligible for provisional waivers if \nDOS had acted on or before the effective date of this final rule to schedule the immigrant visa interview. Id. \nFurthermore, DHS proposed to reject provisional waiver applications that were not filed consistent with the above \ndate restrictions. See proposed 8 CFR 212.7(e)(5)(G)(ii)(1) and (2). In response to comments, DHS has decided to \neliminate these filing restrictions. See new 8 CFR 212.7(e)(4) and (5). D. Allowing Individuals With Final Orders of \nRemoval, Deportation, or Exclusion To Apply for Provisional Waivers Since the inception of the provisional waiver \nprocess, individuals have been ineligible for provisional waivers if they are 1) subject to final orders of removal \nissued under INA sections 217, 235, 238, or 240, 8 U.S.C. 1187, 1225, 1228, or 1229a; 2) subject to final orders of \nexclusion or deportation under former INA sections 236 or 242, 8 U.S.C. 1226 or 1252 (pre-April 1, 1997), or 3) \nsubject to final orders under any other provision of law (including an in absentia order of removal under INA section \n240(b)(5), 8 U.S.C. 1229a(b)(5)). See generally 2013 Rule, 78 FR 536. As indicated in the response to comments \non this subject in the preamble, DHS is amending the rule to provide eligibility for provisional waivers to certain \nindividuals who are subject to an administratively final order of removal, deportation, or exclusion and therefore will \nbe inadmissible under INA section 212(a)(9)(A)(i) or (ii), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(A)(i) or (ii), upon departure from the \nUnited States. Under the final rule, such individuals will be eligible to apply for provisional waivers if they have been \ngranted consent to reapply for admission under INA section 212(a)(9)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(A)(iii) and 8 CFR \n212.2(j). See new 8 CFR 212.7(e)(4) (iv). However, they cannot file Form I-212 applications and provisional waiver \napplications concurrently. See new 8 CFR 212.7(e)(4)(iv). Notwithstanding this change, individuals will remain \nineligible for provisional waivers if 1) they have returned unlawfully to the United States after removal, and 2) CBP \n\n\n\nor ICE, after service of notice under 8 CFR 241.8, has reinstated a prior order of removal, deportation, or exclusion. \nUnder INA section 241(a)(5), 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(5), reinstatement of a such an order makes the individual ineligible \nfor waivers of inadmissibility and other forms of relief. See new 8 CFR 212.7(e)(4)(v). Moreover, even in the \nabsence of reinstatement, the individual's unauthorized return to the United States may be considered as an \nadverse discretionary factor in adjudicating a provisional waiver application. Finally, the approval of a provisional \nwaiver application will be automatically revoked if the applicant is ultimately determined to be inadmissible under \nINA 212(a)(9)(C), 8 U.S.C 1182(a)(9)(C), for having unlawfully returned to the United States after a prior removal or \nprior unlawful presence. E. Clarifying When an Individual Is Subject to Reinstatement and Ineligible for Provisional \nWaivers Currently, an individual is ineligible for a provisional waiver if he or she is subject to reinstatement of a prior \norder under INA section 241(a)(5), 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(5). See 8 CFR 212.7(e)(4)(vii). DHS retained this ineligibility \ncriteria in the proposed rule. In this final rule, however, DHS clarifies which individuals are ineligible for provisional \nwaivers based on application of the reinstatement of removal provision at INA section 241(a)(5), 8 U.S.C. \n1231(a)(5). Under the final rule, an individual will be ineligible for a provisional waiver if ICE or CBP, after service of \nnotice under 8 CFR 241.8, has reinstated the removal, deportation, or [[Page 50263]] exclusion order prior to the \nindividual filing the provisional waiver or while the provisional waiver application is pending. See new 8 CFR \n212.7(e)(4)(v). F. Miscellaneous Technical Amendments In this final rule, DHS made several technical and non-\nsubstantive changes. First, DHS amended 8 CFR 212.7(e)(2) by adding the word ``document'' after the terms \n``employment authorization'' and ``advance parole.'' Additionally, DHS simplified the text of 8 CFR 212.7(e)(5). \nCurrently, that provision outlines filing conditions, which are also provided in the instructions to provisional waiver \napplications. DHS, therefore, revised the provision to refer individuals to the filing instructions of the form. V. \nStatutory and Regulatory Requirements A. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 This rule will not result in the \nexpenditure by State, local and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or \nmore in any one year, and it will not significantly or uniquely affect small governments. Therefore, no actions were \ndeemed necessary under the provisions of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. B. Small Business \nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 This rule is not a major rule as defined by section 804 of the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Act of 1996. This rule will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 \nmillion or more; a major increase in costs or prices; or significant adverse effects on competition, employment, \ninvestment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based companies to compete with foreign- \nbased companies in domestic and export markets. C. Executive Orders 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) \nand 13563 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review) Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to \nassess the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory \napproaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety \neffects, distributive impacts, and equity). Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying both \ncosts and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This rule is a ``significant \nregulatory action,'' although not an economically significant regulatory action, under section 3(f) of Executive Order \n12866. Accordingly, the Office of Management and Budget has reviewed this regulation. This effort is consistent \nwith Executive Order 13563's call for agencies to ``consider how best to promote retrospective analysis of rules \nthat may be outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, or excessively burdensome, and to modify, streamline, expand, or \nrepeal them in accordance with what has been learned.'' 1. Summary After careful consideration of public \ncomments on the 2015 Proposed Rule,\\56\\ DHS adopts most of the regulatory amendments specified in the \nproposed rule without change, except for the provisions addressing ineligibility for: 1) reason to believe that the \napplicant may be inadmissible on grounds other than unlawful presence at the time of the DOS immigrant visa \ninterview (8 CFR 212.7(e)(4)(i)); 2) DOS initially acting before January 3, 2013 or before the effective date of this \nfinal rule to schedule an applicant's immigrant visa interview (proposed 8 CFR 212.7(e)(4)(iv) and \n212.7(e)(5)(ii)(G)); and 3) the applicant being subject to an administratively final order of exclusion, deportation, or \nremoval (``final order'')(8 CFR 212.7(e)(4)(vi)). With the adoption of most of the proposed regulatory amendments, \nDHS largely applies the 2015 Proposed Rule's economic analysis approach to this final rule. However, some \nchanges to the analysis are necessary to capture the population of individuals now eligible for provisional waivers \nthrough this final rule's elimination and modification of certain ineligibility provisions just described and source data \nrevisions. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\56\\ See 80 FR 43338 (July 22, 2015). ------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------- This rule's expansion of the provisional waiver process will create \ncosts and benefits to newly eligible provisional waiver (Form I-601A) applicants, their U.S. citizen or LPR family \n\n\n\nmembers, and the Federal Government (namely, USCIS and DOS), as outlined in Table 1. This rule will impose \nfee, time, and travel costs on an estimated 100,000 newly eligible individuals who choose to complete and submit \nprovisional waiver applications and biometrics (fingerprints, photograph, and signature) to USCIS for consideration \nduring the 10-year period of analysis (see Table 8). These costs will equal an estimated $52.4 million at a 7 percent \ndiscount rate and $64.2 million at a 3 percent discount rate in present value across the period of analysis. On an \nannualized basis, the costs will measure approximately $7.5 million at both 7 percent and 3 percent discount rates \n(see Table 1). Newly eligible provisional waiver applicants and their U.S. citizen or LPR family members will benefit \nfrom this rule. Individuals applying for a provisional waiver will receive advance notice of USCIS' decision to \nprovisionally waive their 3- or 10-year unlawful presence bar under INA section 212(a)(9)(B), 8 U.S.C. \n1182(a)(9)(B), before they leave the United States for their immigrant visa interviews abroad. This offers applicants \nand their family members the certainty of knowing that the applicants have been provisionally approved for a waiver \nof certain unlawful presence grounds of inadmissibility before departing from the United States. Individuals with \napproved provisional waivers may experience shortened periods of separation from their family members living in \nthe United States while they pursue immigrant visas abroad, thus reducing related financial and emotional strains \non the families. USCIS and DOS will continue to benefit from the operational efficiencies gained from the \nprovisional waiver's role in streamlining immigrant visa application processing, but on a larger scale than currently \nin place. In the absence of this rule, DHS assumes that the majority of individuals who would have been newly \neligible for provisional waivers under this rule will likely continue to pursue an immigrant visa through consular \nprocessing abroad and apply for waivers of unlawful presence through the Form I-601 process. Those who apply \nfor unlawful presence waivers through the Form I-601 process will incur fee, time, and travel costs similar to \nindividuals applying for waivers through the provisional waiver process. However, without this rule, those who must \nseek a waiver of inadmissibility abroad through the Form I-601 process after the immigrant visa interview may face \nlonger separation times from their families in the United States and experience less certainty regarding the approval \nof a waiver of the 3- or 10-year unlawful presence bar before departing from the United States. [[Page 50264]] \nTable 1--Total Costs and Benefits of Rule, Year 1-Year 10 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------- 10-Year present values Annualized values ----------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------- 3% Discount rate 7% Discount rate 3% Discount rate 7% Discount rate -------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Costs: Quantitative................ $64,168,205....... \n$52,429,216....... $7,522,471........ $7,464,741 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------- Total Benefits: Qualitative.................

This offers applicants and their family \nmembers the certainty of knowing that the applicants have been provisionally approved for a waiver before \ndeparting from the United States. Provisional waiver applicants will receive advance notice of USCIS' decision to \nprovisionally waive their 3- or 10-year unlawful presence bar before they leave the United States for their \nimmigrant visa interview abroad. This offers applicants and their family members the certainty of knowing that the \napplicants have been provisionally approved for a waiver before departing from the United States. -----------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Federal Government will achieve increased \nefficiencies by streamlining immigrant visa processing for applicants seeking inadmissibility waivers of unlawful \npresence.

Background Individuals who are in the \nUnited States and seeking LPR status must either obtain an immigrant visa abroad through consular processing \nwith DOS or apply to adjust status in the United States, if eligible. Those present in the United States without having \nbeen inspected and admitted or paroled are typically ineligible to adjust status in the United States. To obtain LPR \nstatus, such individuals must leave the United States for immigrant visa processing at a U.S. Embassy or \nconsulate abroad. Because these individuals are present in the United States without having been inspected and \n\n\n\nadmitted or paroled, many have accrued enough unlawful presence to trigger the 3- or 10-year unlawful presence \ngrounds of inadmissibility when leaving the United States for immigrant visa processing abroad.\\57\\ See INA \nsection 212(a)(9)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B)(i). While there may be limited exceptions, the population affected by \nthis rule will consist almost exclusively of individuals who are eligible for immigrant visas but are unlawfully present \nin the United States without having been inspected and admitted or paroled. ----------------------------------------------------\n----------------------- \\57\\ Individuals who depart the United States after accruing more than 180 days, but less than 1 \nyear, of unlawful presence are generally inadmissible for 3 years. Those who depart the United States after \naccruing 1 year or more of unlawful presence are generally inadmissible for 10 years. ---------------------------------------\n------------------------------------ Before the introduction of the provisional waiver process, individuals seeking immigrant \nvisas through consular processing were only able to apply for a waiver of a ground of inadmissibility, such as \nunlawful presence, after attending the immigrant visa interview abroad. If a consular officer identified any ground(s) \nof inadmissibility during an immigrant visa interview, the applicant was tentatively denied an immigrant visa and \nallowed to seek a waiver of any waivable ground(s) of inadmissibility. The individual could apply for such a waiver \nby filing Form I-601 with USCIS. Those who applied for Form I- 601 waivers were required to remain abroad while \nUSCIS adjudicated their Forms I-601, which currently takes over five months to complete.\\58\\ If USCIS approved \nthe waiver of the inadmissibility ground(s), DOS subsequently scheduled a follow-up consular interview. Provided \nthere were no other concerns raised by the consular officer, DOS generally issued the immigrant visa during the \nfollow-up consular interview. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\58\\ U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services. ``USCIS Processing Time Information for the Nebraska Service Center- Form I- 601.'' \nAvailable at            https://egov.uscis.gov/cris/processTimesDisplayInit.do (last updated Feb. 11, 2016). ----------------\n----------------------------------------------------------- In some instances, the Form I-601 waiver process led to lengthy \nseparations of immigrant visa applicants from their U.S. citizen or LPR spouses, parents, and children, causing \nfinancial and emotional harm. The Form I-601 waiver process also created processing inefficiencies for both USCIS \nand DOS through repeated interagency communication and through multiple consular appointments or interviews. \nWith the goals of streamlining the inadmissibility waiver process, facilitating efficient immigrant visa issuance, and \npromoting family unity, DHS promulgated a rule that established an alternative inadmissibility waiver process on \nJanuary 3, 2013 (``2013 Rule'').\\59\\ The 2013 Rule created a provisional waiver process for certain immediate \nrelatives of U.S. citizens (namely, spouses, children (unmarried and under 21), and parents of U.S. citizens \n(provided the child is at least 21)) who are in the United States, are seeking immigrant visas, can demonstrate \nextreme hardship to a U.S. citizen spouse or parent, would be inadmissible upon departure from the United States \ndue to only the accrual of unlawful presence, and meet other eligibility conditions. That process currently allows \neligible individuals to apply for a provisional waiver and receive a notification of USCIS' decision on their provisional \nwaiver application before departing for DOS consular processing of their immigrant visa applications. The \nprovisional waiver process contrasts to the Form I- 601 waiver process, which requires [[Page 50265]] applicants to \nwait abroad, away from their family members in the United States, while USCIS adjudicates their application for a \nwaiver of inadmissibility. Once approved for a provisional waiver, they are scheduled for the immigrant visa \ninterview abroad. During the immigrant visa interview, a DOS consular officer will determine whether the applicant \nis otherwise admissible to the United States and eligible to receive an immigrant visa. Since the provisional waiver \nprocess's inception, USCIS has approved more than 66,000 provisional waiver applications for certain immediate \nrelatives of U.S. citizens,\\60\\ allowing these individuals and their families to enjoy the benefits of such waivers. ------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------- \\59\\ See 78 FR 536 (Jan. 3, 2013). \\60\\ This figure is based on \nForm I-601A approvals data through the end of fiscal year 2015 (September 30, 2015). Note that USCIS began \naccepting provisional waiver applications on March 4, 2013. Source: USCIS' Office of Performance and Quality. ----\n----------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. Purpose of Rule To assess the initial effectiveness of the \nprovisional waiver process, DHS decided to offer this process to a limited group--certain immediate relatives of U.S. \ncitizens--in the 2013 Rule.\\61\\ Based on the lengthy separation periods and related financial and emotional burdens \nto families associated with the Form I-601 waiver process, and based on the efficiencies realized for both USCIS \nand DOS through the provisional waiver process, the Secretary directed USCIS to expand eligibility for the \nprovisional waiver process beyond certain immediate relatives of U.S. citizens to all statutorily eligible immigrant \nvisa applicants.\\62\\ Consistent with that directive and the INA, on July 22, 2015, DHS published the 2015 Proposed \nRule, which proposed to expand eligibility for provisional waivers of certain grounds of inadmissibility based on the \naccrual of unlawful presence to include all other individuals seeking an immigrant visa (all other immigrant visa \n\n\napplicants \\63\\) who are statutorily eligible for a waiver of such grounds, are seeking a waiver in connection with an \nimmigrant visa application, are present in the United States, and meet other conditions.\\64\\ In the 2015 Proposed \nRule, USCIS also proposed to allow LPR spouses and parents, in addition to currently eligible U.S. citizen spouses \nand parents, to serve as qualifying relatives for the provisional waiver's extreme hardship determination, consistent \nwith the statutory waiver authority. Under this provision, provisional waiver applicants could show that their denial of \nadmission would cause extreme hardship to their U.S. citizen or LPR spouses or parents. ----------------------------------\n----------------------------------------- \\61\\ See 78 FR at 542. \\62\\ This expansion included, but was not limited to, adult \nsons and daughters of U.S. citizens; brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens; and spouses and children of LPRs. See \nMemorandum from Jeh Charles Johnson, Secretary, DHS, to L\u00e9on Rodr[iacute]guez, Director, USCIS, Expansion \nof the Provisional Waiver Program (Nov. 20, 2014). Available at            \nhttp://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/14_1120_memo_i601a_waiver.pdf. \\63\\ For the purposes of this \nanalysis, the phrase ``all other immigrant visa applicants'' encompasses the following immigrant visa categories: \nfamily-sponsored immigrants, employment-based immigrants, diversity immigrants, and certain special \nimmigrants. \\64\\ See 80 FR 43338 (July 22, 2015). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This \nfinal rule adopts most of the regulatory amendments set forth in the 2015 Proposed Rule except for a few \nprovisions. In particular, USCIS, in response to public comments on the 2015 Proposed Rule, will eliminate the \ncurrent provisional waiver provisions addressing ineligibility for: (1) Reason to believe that the applicant may be \ninadmissible on grounds other than unlawful presence at the time of the DOS immigrant visa interview (8 CFR \n212.7(e)(4)(i)); (2) DOS initially acting before January 3, 2013 (for certain immediate relatives) or before the \neffective date of this final rule to schedule an applicant's immigrant visa interview (proposed 8 CFR 212.7(e)(4)(iv) \nand 212.7(e)(5)(ii)(G)); and (3) applicants who are subject to an administratively final order of exclusion, \ndeportation, or removal (8 CFR 212.7(e)(4)(vi)).\\65\\ An individual subject to a final order may now seek a \nprovisional waiver, but only if he or she has already requested and been approved for consent to reapply for \nadmission under INA section 212(a)(9)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(A)(iii) via a Form I-212 application. Filing and \nreceiving approval of the Form I-212 application is a requirement already in place for these individuals to be eligible \nfor an immigrant visa. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\65\\ As mentioned earlier in this \npreamble, USCIS will automatically revoke a provisional waiver if DOS determines, at the time of the immigrant \nvisa interview, that the applicant is inadmissible on any ground(s) of inadmissibility other than unlawful presence \nunder INA section 212(a)(9)(B), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B). Revocation of the provisional unlawful presence waiver for \nthis reason does not prevent an individual from applying under 8 CFR 212.7(a) for a waiver of inadmissibility under \nINA section 212(a)(9)(B)(v), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B)(v), or for any other waiver that may be available for any other \nground(s) of inadmissibility. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Other than the changes \noutlined in this rulemaking, DHS will maintain all other eligibility requirements for the provisional waiver as currently \ndescribed in 8 CFR 212.7(e), including the requirements to submit biometrics, pay the provisional waiver filing fee \nand the biometric services fee, and be present in the United States at the time of the provisional waiver application \nfiling and biometrics appointment. This rule's amendments will provide more individuals seeking immigrant visas \nand their U.S. citizen or LPR family members with the provisional waiver's main benefit of shortened family \nseparation periods, while increasing USCIS and DOS efficiencies by streamlining the immigrant visa process for \nsuch applicants. 4. Current Provisional Waiver Process In this analysis, DHS draws on applicable DOS visa \nineligibility statistics and historical provisional waiver application data to estimate the current demand for provisional \nwaivers and the anticipated demand directly resulting from this final rule. Illustrating the past demand for provisional \nwaivers, Table 2 displays the actual numbers of Form I-601A receipts, approvals, and denials recorded for March of \nfiscal year (FY) 2013 \\66\\ through the end of FY 2015. Across those years, DHS received about 107,000 Form I-\n601A applications, for an average of almost 42,000 per year.\\67\\ During the same period, DHS approved 66,000 \nForm I-601A applications and denied 27,000.\\68\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\66\\ FY \n2013 was October 1, 2012 to September 30, 2013. \\67\\ DHS calculated the average Form I-601A receipts per \nmonth since the provisional waiver process's implementation in March 2013 through the end of FY 2015, which \nequaled 3,467.65, and multiplied the average monthly receipts by 12 to determine the annual average. \\68\\ \nApprovals and denials reflect actual cases adjudicated, which do not directly correspond to filing receipts for the \nsame year. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Of the provisional waiver applications \nadjudicated from FY 2013 to FY 2015, USCIS denied a total of 9 percent for the following reasons: An applicant's \nlack of a qualifying relative for the waiver's extreme hardship determination (0.8 percent); \\69\\ reason to believe an \n\nhttp://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/14_1120_memo_i601a_waiver.pdf\n\n\napplicant would be inadmissible based on grounds other than unlawful presence at the time of the immigrant visa \ninterview (7.2 percent); DOS initially acting before January 3, 2013 to schedule an applicant's immigrant visa \ninterview (0.1 percent); and an applicant being subject to a final order [[Page 50266]] (0.9 percent).\\70\\ With this \nfinal rule's elimination or modification of these ineligibility grounds, more individuals will presumably be eligible for \nprovisional waivers. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\69\\ Note that applicants denied for \nnot having a qualifying U.S. citizen spouse or parent include those who could potentially have LPR spouses and/or \nparents who might experience extreme hardship as well as those who attempted to demonstrate hardship to a U.S. \ncitizen child-a relative who is not a qualifying relative for the purposes of the unlawful presence waiver, provisional \nor not. The exact number of denials according to these different demonstrations is unknown.

When DHS conducted the 2013 Rule's economic impact analysis, DHS did \nnot have statistics on unlawful presence inadmissibility findings for certain immediate relatives that would have \nallowed for a precise calculation of the rule's impact. Due to these limitations, DHS instead estimated the rule's \nimpact based on various demand scenarios. In the analysis for this final rule, DHS uses actual USCIS receipts for \nprovisional waiver applications to determine the future demand for provisional waivers, as discussed later.

The average monthly receipts equaled 3,467.65, while approvals \nmeasured 2,138.39 and denials equaled 862.74. \\72\\ DOS determined that the rules it used to collect the \ninadmissibility and ineligibility data included in the 2015 Proposed Rule resulted in errors.

In the \n2015 Proposed Rule, DHS based the demand for Form I-601A applications with and without the rule on the FY \n2013 to FY 2014 average ratio of Form I-601A receipts to immigrant visa ineligibility findings based on unlawful \npresence inadmissibility grounds. Since the publication of the proposed rule, DOS provided DHS with revised data. \nBased on a review of the revised DOS ineligibility data, DHS has determined that using a year-specific ratio of \nreceipts to ineligibility findings is no longer the best option to predict future provisional waiver demand because of \nrecent changes in Form I-601A filing trends. DOS's new data suggests that the majority of immediate relatives \nfound ineligible for an immigrant visa by DOS based on unlawful presence inadmissibility grounds in one fiscal \nyear have filed provisional unlawful presence waivers of inadmissibility prior to DOS's immigrant visa ineligibility \nfinding, though the dates of these separate events is unknown. Because the time lag between such filings and \nineligibility findings is unknown, making same-year comparisons between these data could result in erroneous \nconclusions. As such, DHS believes it is most appropriate to estimate the future demand for provisional waivers in \nthe absence of this rule using historical Form I-601A filing data. In the absence of this rule, DHS projects that Form \nI-601A receipts from immediate relative immigrants would increase from their three-year average of 41,612 (see \nTable 2) by 2.5 percent per year based on the compound annual growth rate of the unauthorized immigrant \npopulation living in the United States between 2000 and 2012.\\77\\ Under this method, USCIS would receive a \nprojected 478,000 provisional waiver applications across 10 years of analysis in the absence of this rule, as shown \nin Table 5. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\77\\ Calculated by comparing the estimated \nunauthorized immigrant population living in the United States in 2000 (8,500,000) to the estimated unauthorized \nimmigrant population living in the United States in 2012 (11,400,000). In recent years, the estimated unauthorized \nimmigrant population has decreased. DHS uses the historical growth rate in the unauthorized immigrant \npopulation from 2000 to 2012 because it most likely reflects the population impacted by this rule. This population \nincludes those who have likely been unlawfully present in the United States for an extended period and who have \nalready started the immigrant visa process by having an approved petition.

These applications do not \nnecessarily correspond to waiver approvals. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- DHS does \nnot believe this rule will induce any new demand above the status quo for filing petitions or immigrant visa \napplications for this expanded group of individuals. DHS bases this assumption on the fact that most of the newly \neligible visa categories to which this rule will now apply (namely, family-sponsored, employment-based, diversity, \nand certain special immigrant visa categories) are generally subject, unlike the immediate relative category, to \nstatutory visa issuance limits and lengthy visa availability waits due to oversubscription.\\79\\ Even with this rule's \nelimination or modification of specific provisional waiver ineligibility criteria currently in place, DHS does not \nanticipate that a related rise in the demand for immigrant visas for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens will occur \ngiven the low historical share of applications denied for these reasons (approximately 9 percent as mentioned \nearlier). In addition, because immediate relative visas are readily available, immediate relatives who were denied a \nprovisional waiver previously have likely continued on with the consular interview process to obtain LPR status.\\80\\ \nTherefore, DHS did not estimate that these immediate relatives would reapply for a provisional waiver. Furthermore, \nthere is no evidence that the Secretary's November 2014 memorandum \\81\\ on the expansion of the provisional \nwaiver process spurred a significant increase in filings of the Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130) or Immigrant \nPetition for Alien Worker (Form I-140).\\82\\ Thus, DHS does not expect that this rule will increase the demand for \nthe immigrant visa categories to which it applies. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\79\\ \nFamily-sponsored immigrant visa applicants, who represent nearly 97 percent of the ``all other immigrants'' \npopulation found ineligible due to only unlawful presence inadmissibility grounds, currently face visa \noversubscription. This means that any new family-sponsored visa applicants must wait in line for available visas. \nDepending on the applicant's country of chargeability and preference category, this wait could be many years. \nSource: U.S. Department of State. ``Visa Bulletin: Immigrant Numbers for December 2015,'' IX (87), Nov. 2015. \nAvailable at            http://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Bulletins/visabulletin_December2015.pdf. \\80\\ \nImmigrant visas for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens are unlimited, so they are always available.

This rule's broadened group of qualifying relatives for the provisional \nwaiver's extreme hardship determination as well as its elimination or modification of current provisional waiver \nineligibility provisions will allow some immediate relatives of U.S. citizens and LPRs to become eligible for \n\nhttp://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ois_ill_pe_2012_2.pdf\nhttp://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Bulletins/visabulletin_December2015.pdf\nhttp://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/visa-availability-and-priority-dates\nhttp://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/visa-availability-and-priority-dates\nhttp://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/14_1120_memo_i601a_waiver.pdf\n\n\nprovisional waivers. All other immigrant visa applicants \\83\\ who are present in the United States and who \notherwise meet the requirements of the provisional waiver process described in this final rule will also become \neligible for provisional waivers. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\83\\ As previously \nmentioned, the phrase ``all other immigrant visa applicants'' encompasses the following immigrant visa \ncategories: family-sponsored, employment-based, Diversity Visa, and (certain) special immigrant visa applicants. \nExamples of family relationships that fall under ``all other immigrant visa applicants'' include, but are not limited to, \nadult sons and daughters of U.S. citizens, brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens, and spouses and children of LPRs. -\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------- Immediate Relatives Affected by Rule Some immediate \nrelatives of U.S. citizens were denied provisional waivers under the 2013 Rule because USCIS had ``reason to \nbelieve'' that they were subject to a ground of inadmissibility other than unlawful presence. Others were denied \nbecause they were subject to a final order. This rule eliminates denials based on the reason-to- believe standard \nand modifies the ineligibility criteria related to final orders, thus allowing additional immediate relatives to become \neligible for provisional waivers. As previously mentioned, Table 4 shows DOS's historical findings of immigrant visa \nineligibility among immediate relatives due to unlawful presence and any other ground for denying visa issuance, \nsuch as being subject to a final order.\\84\\ DHS believes that the population of immediate relatives found ineligible \nfor immigrant visas based on unlawful presence and any other ground of inadmissibility shown in Table 4 best \npredicts the share of immediate relatives affected by the elimination or modification of ineligibility criteria in this rule, \nas the DOS figures presumably account for these provisional waiver ineligibilities.\\85\\ According to the FY 2013 to \nFY 2015 annual average number of immediate relatives found ineligible for visas based on unlawful presence and \nany other ground of inadmissibility (and visa ineligibility) (3,837; see Table 4), and the historical 2.5 percent growth \nin the unauthorized immigrant population, DHS estimates that 3,933 immediate relatives will become eligible, and \nconsequently apply, for provisional waivers as a direct result of this rule's expanded waiver eligibility during the \nrule's first year of implementation (see Table 6). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\84\\ \nOther grounds of inadmissibility barring visa eligibility can be found in INA section 212(a), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a). \\85\\ \nThese ineligibility findings likely include the previously discussed 9 percent of historical Form I-601A applicants \ndenied for the following reasons: an applicant's lack of a qualifying relative for the waiver's extreme hardship \ndetermination; reason to believe an applicant would be inadmissible based on grounds other than unlawful \npresence at the time of the immigrant visa interview; DOS initially acting before January 3, 2013 to schedule an \napplicant's immigrant visa interview; and an applicant being subject to a final order. However, due to data \nlimitations, DHS does not know the exact number of ineligibility findings that correspond to provisional waiver \ndenials. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 6 shows that over a 10-year period of \nanalysis, USCIS will receive approximately 44,000 provisional waiver applications from immediate relatives now \neligible for provisional waivers based on this rule's elimination or modification of specific provisional [[Page 50269]] \nwaiver ineligibility criteria. These figures reflect the assumption that the population of individuals historically found \nineligible for immigrant visas based on unlawful presence and any other ground of inadmissibility will apply for \nprovisional waivers even though they may still be inadmissible on another ground that would bar them from \nreceiving an immigrant visa. However, these figures do not account for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens and \nLPRs who could become eligible for provisional waivers through this rule's broadened group of qualifying relatives \nfor the provisional waiver's extreme hardship determination and its elimination of DOS scheduling date \nrequirements. Due to data limitations, DHS cannot precisely measure the number of individuals impacted by these \namendments, though based on historical denials, the number impacted will likely be small.\\86\\ ----------------------------\n----------------------------------------------- \\86\\ Of the provisional waiver applications adjudicated from FY 2013 to FY \n2015, USCIS denied less than 1,000 applications in total based on an applicant's lack of a qualifying relative for the \nwaiver's extreme hardship determination and for DOS initially acting before January 3, 2013 to schedule an \napplicant's immigrant visa interview. Source: Email correspondence with USCIS' National Benefits Center on \nOctober 7, 2015 and December 7, 2015. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Due to additional \ndata limitations, DHS cannot determine the exact number of immediate relatives eligible to apply for provisional \nwaivers under the 2013 Rule who either continued taking steps necessary to obtain LPR status or who abandoned \nthe immigrant visa process altogether after being denied provisional waivers for the ineligibility criteria eliminated \nor modified with this rule (e.g., DOS scheduling date requirements). DHS assumes for the purpose of this analysis \nthat those immediate relatives who applied for provisional waivers prior to this final rule but were denied for the \ncriteria eliminated or modified with this rule have continued taking the steps necessary to obtain LPR status rather \n\n\n\nthan delay their immigration process. These individuals have likely sought waivers of the unlawful presence \ngrounds of inadmissibility through the Form I-601 waiver process as part of obtaining their LPR status. For these \nreasons, DHS does not believe this rule will affect certain immediate relatives of U.S. citizens previously denied \nprovisional waivers due to this rule's eliminated or modified criteria, and thus does not consider these individuals in \nthe population affected by this rule. As such, Table 6 does not include these individuals.

These applications do not necessarily correspond to \nwaiver approvals. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In addition to the population of \nimmediate relatives illustrated in Table 6, this rule will affect a portion of all other immigrant visa applicants. To \ncapture the population of all other immigrant visa applicants (that is, those who are not immediate relative \nimmigrant visa applicants) that may file for a provisional waiver due to this rule, DHS uses the following historical \ndata: (1) DOS immigrant visa ineligibility findings due to only unlawful presence inadmissibility grounds (the \npopulation included in the 2015 Proposed Rule); (2) DOS immigrant visa ineligibility findings due to unlawful \npresence and any other inadmissibility ground (the population potentially now included in this final rule); and (3) \ngrowth in the unauthorized immigrant population. In particular, DHS applies the previously discussed 2.5 percent \ncompound annual growth rate of unauthorized immigrants from 2000 to 2012 to the sum of the FY 2013 to FY \n2015 annual averages of all other immigrant visa ineligibility findings due to: (1) Only unlawful presence \ninadmissibility grounds; and (2) unlawful presence and any other inadmissibility ground, which equals 4,909 (see \nTable 3 and Table 4).\\88\\ For Year 1, DHS projects that Form I-601A applications from the population of all other \nimmigrants now eligible for provisional waivers will measure approximately 5,032. For Years 2 through 10, \napplications are expected to range from 5,158 to 6,284 (see Table 7).\\89\\ These figures partly reflect the \nassumption that the population of individuals historically found ineligible for immigrant visas based on unlawful \npresence and any other ground of inadmissibility will apply for provisional waivers even though they may still be \ninadmissible on another ground that would bar them from receiving an immigrant visa. -------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------- \\88\\ Calculated as the FY 2013-FY 2015 average number of all other immigrant visa \nineligibility findings due to only unlawful presence (3,685) plus the FY 2013-FY 2015 average number of all other \nimmigrant visa ineligibility findings due to unlawful presence and any other ground of inadmissibility (1,224) = \n4,909. \\89\\ Year 1 figure calculated as the FY 2013-FY 2015 average number of all other immigrant visa ineligibility \nfindings due to: (1) Only unlawful presence, and (2) unlawful presence and any other ground of inadmissibility of \n4,909 multiplied by the assumed 2.5 percent growth rate (that is, 1.025), which equals 5,032.

These applications do not necessarily correspond to waiver approvals. ---------------------------------------\n------------------------------------ Table 8 outlines the entire population of immigrant visa applicants potentially impacted \nby this rule, as measured by the sum of Form I- 601A receipts listed in Table 6 and Table 7. Across a 10-year \nperiod of analysis, DHS estimates that the provisional waiver applications from this rule's expanded population of \nindividuals (including immediate relatives of U.S. citizens and LPRs, and [[Page 50270]] family-sponsored, \nemployment-based, Diversity Visa, and (certain) special immigrant visa applicants) will be nearly 100,000. These \nprovisional waiver applications may ultimately result in waiver approvals or denials. Note that Table 8 presents only \nthe additional Form I-601A filings that will occur as a result of this rule; it does not account for the provisional waiver \napplications that DHS anticipates will be filed in the absence of this rule by currently eligible certain immediate \nrelatives of U.S. citizens (see Table 5). As stated earlier, the figures in Table 8 may underestimate the total Form I-\n601A applications resulting from this rule because they do not account for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens and \nLPRs who could become eligible for provisional waivers through this rule's broadened group of qualifying relatives \nfor the provisional waiver's extreme hardship determination and its elimination of DOS scheduling date \nrequirements. They could also overestimate the total Form I-601A applications resulting from this rule because they \nare partly based on the assumption that the population of individuals historically found ineligible for immigrant visas \nbased on unlawful presence and any other ground of inadmissibility will apply for provisional waivers even though \nthey may still be inadmissible on another ground that would bar them from receiving an immigrant visa.

Thereafter, all yearly estimates \nwere simultaneously rounded for tabular presentation. All public comments about specific elements of the \nprojections, costs, or benefits of the rule are discussed earlier in the preamble. 6. Costs and Benefits Costs \nIndividuals who are newly eligible to apply for a provisional waiver strictly under this rule will bear the costs of this \nregulation. Although the waiver expansion may require the Federal Government (namely, DHS and USCIS) to \nexpend additional resources on related adjudication personnel, equipment (e.g., computers and telephones), and \noccupancy demands, DHS expects these costs to be offset by the additional fee revenue collected from the Form I-\n601A filing fee and the biometric services fee. Currently, the filing fees for Form I-601A and biometric services are \n$585 and $85, respectively.\\91\\ Accordingly, DHS does not believe this rule will impose additional net costs on the \nFederal Government. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\91\\ Source of fee rates: U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services. ``I-601A, Application for Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver.'' Available at       \n     http://www.uscis.gov/i-601a (last reviewed/ updated Oct. 7, 2015). The Form I-601A filing fee and biometric \nservices fee are subject to change through the normal fee review cycle and any subsequent rulemaking issued by \nUSCIS/DHS. USCIS/DHS will consider the impact of the provisional waiver and biometrics process workflows and \nresource requirements as a normal part of its biennial fee review. The biennial fee review determines if fees for \nimmigration benefits are sufficient in light of resource needs and filing trends. See INA section 286(m), 8 U.S.C. \n1356(m). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- With the exception of applicants subject to final \norders,\\92\\ eligible individuals must generally first complete Form I-601A and submit it to USCIS with its current \n$585 filing fee and $85 biometric services fee to receive a provisional waiver under this rule. DHS estimates the \ntime burden of completing Form I-601A to be 1.5 hours, which translates to a time, or opportunity, cost of $15.89 \nper application.\\93\\ DHS calculates the Form I-601A application's opportunity cost to individuals by first multiplying \nthe current Federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour by 1.46 to account for the full cost of employee benefits (such \nas paid leave, insurance, and retirement), which results in a time value of $10.59 per hour.\\94\\ Then, DHS \nmultiplies the $10.59 hourly time value by the current 1.5- hour Form I-601A completion time burden to determine \nthe opportunity cost for individuals to complete Form I-601A ($15.89). DHS recognizes that the individuals impacted \nby the rule are generally unlawfully present and not eligible to work; however, consistent with other DHS \nrulemakings, DHS uses wage rates as a mechanism to estimate the opportunity costs to individuals associated with \n\nhttp://www.uscis.gov/i-601a\n\n\ncompleting this rule's required application and biometrics collection. The cost for applicants to initially file Form I-\n601A, including only the $585 filing fee and opportunity cost, equals $600.89. --------------------------------------------------\n------------------------- \\92\\ As previously stated, individuals subject to a final order may now seek a provisional waiver \nonly if they also request (and are approved for) consent to reapply for admission under INA section 212(a)(9)(A)(iii), \n8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(A)(iii) via an Application for Permission to Reapply for Admission into the United States After \nDeportation or Removal (Form I-212). Filing and receiving approval for a Form I-212 is a requirement already in \nplace for individuals subject to inadmissibility under INA section 212(a)(9)(A), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(A), to be eligible \nfor an immigrant visa. Thus, USCIS does not include the cost to file Form I-212 to the applicable population of \nprovisional waiver applicants in this rule. \\93\\ See 80 FR 16688 (Mar. 30, 2015) for the estimated Form I- 601A \ncompletion time burden. \\94\\ Federal minimum wage information source: U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and \nHour Division. ``Wages- Minimum Wage.''

Available at            \nhttp://www.bls.gov/schedule/archives/ecec_nr.htm#current. --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n- After USCIS receives an applicant's completed Form I-601A and its filing and biometric services fees, the agency \nsends the applicant a notice scheduling him or her to visit a USCIS Application Support Center (ASC) for biometrics \ncollection. Along with an $85 biometric services fee, the applicant will incur the following costs to comply with the \nprovisional waiver's biometrics submission requirement: (1) The opportunity cost of traveling to an ASC, (2) the \nopportunity cost of submitting his or her biometrics, and (3) the mileage cost of traveling to an ASC. While travel \ntimes and distances to an ASC vary, DHS estimates that an applicant's average roundtrip distance to an ASC is 50 \nmiles, and that the average time for that trip is 2.5 hours. DHS estimates that an applicant waits an average of 1.17 \nhours for service and to have his or her biometrics collected at an ASC, adding up to a total biometrics-related time \nburden of 3.67 hours.\\95\\ By applying the $10.59 hourly time value for individuals to the total biometrics- related \ntime burden of 3.67 hours, DHS finds that the opportunity cost for a provisional waiver applicant to travel to and \nfrom an ASC, and to submit biometrics, will total $38.87.\\96\\ In addition to the opportunity cost of providing \nbiometrics, provisional waiver applicants will experience travel costs related to biometrics collection. The cost of \nsuch travel will equal $28.75 per trip, based on the assumed 50-mile [[Page 50271]] roundtrip distance to an ASC \nand the General Services Administration's travel rate of $0.575 per mile.\\97\\ DHS assumes that each applicant will \ntravel independently to an ASC to submit his or her biometrics, meaning that this rule will impose a time cost on \neach provisional waiver applicant. Adding the fee, opportunity, and travel costs of biometrics collection together, \nDHS estimates that the provisional waiver's requirement to submit biometrics will cost a total of $152.62 per Form I-\n601A filing. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\95\\ See 80 FR 16688 (Mar. 30, 2015) for \nForm I-601A biometrics collection time burden. \\96\\ 3.67 hours multiplied by $10.59 per hour equals $38.87. \\97\\ 50 \nmiles multiplied by $0.575 per mile equals $28.75. See 79 FR 78437 (Dec. 30, 2014) for the General Services \nAdministration's mileage rate. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Accounting for all of the fee, \ntime, and travel costs to comply with the provisional waiver requirements, DHS finds that each Form I- 601A filing \nwill cost an applicant $753.51. Table 9 shows that the overall cost of this rule to the expanded population of \nprovisional waiver applicants will measure $75.7 million (undiscounted) over the 10-year period of analysis. DHS \ncalculates this rule's total cost to applicants by multiplying the individual cost of completing the provisional waiver \napplication requirements ($753.51) by the number of newly eligible individuals projected to apply for provisional \nwaivers each year following the implementation of this rule (see Table 8). In present value terms, this rule will cost \nnewly eligible waiver applicants $52.4 million to $64.2 million across a 10-year period at 7 percent and 3 percent \ndiscount rates, respectively (see Table 9). Because this rule will not generate any net costs to the Federal \nGovernment (as discussed previously), these costs to applicants also reflect the total cost of this rule. Depending \non the population of individuals who apply for provisional waivers beyond the projections shown in Table 8, the \ncosts of this rule may be over- or underestimated.

The cost estimates in \nthis table are contingent upon Form I-601A filing (or receipt) projections as well as the discount rates applied. \nBenefits The benefits of this rule are largely the result of streamlining the immigrant visa process for an expanded \npopulation of individuals who are inadmissible to the United States due to unlawful presence. This rule will provide \napplicants seeking provisional waivers and their family members advance notice of USCIS' decision on their \nprovisional waiver application prior to leaving the United States for their immigrant visa interviews abroad, offering \nmany individuals the certainty of knowing they have been provisionally approved for a waiver of certain unlawful \npresence grounds of inadmissibility before departing from the United States. For those newly eligible individuals \nwho receive a provisional waiver through this rule and their U.S. citizen or LPR family members, this rule's primary \nbenefits are its reduced separation time among family members during the immigrant visa process. Instead of \nattending multiple immigrant visa interviews and waiting abroad while USCIS adjudicates a waiver application as \nrequired under the Form I-601 process, the provisional waiver process allows individuals to file a provisional waiver \napplication while in the United States and receive a notification of USCIS' decision on their provisional waiver \napplication before departing for DOS consular processing of their immigrant visa applications. Although DHS \ncannot estimate with precision the exact amount of separation time families will save through this rule, DHS \nestimates that some newly eligible individuals and their U.S. citizen or LPR family members could experience \nseveral months of reduced separation time based on the average adjudication time for Form I-601 waiver \napplications.\\98\\ In addition to the humanitarian and emotional benefits derived from reduced separation of families, \nDHS anticipates that the shortened periods of family separation resulting from this rule may lessen the financial \nburden U.S. citizens and LPRs face to support their immigrant relatives while they remain outside of the country. \nBecause of data limitations, however, DHS cannot predict the exact financial impact of this change. ---------------------\n------------------------------------------------------ \\98\\ The average adjudication time of Form I-601 waivers is currently over \nfive months.

Available at            https://egov.uscis.gov/cris/processTimesDisplayInit.do \n(last updated Feb. 11, 2016). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Due to the unique nature of \nthe Diversity Visa program, individuals seeking an immigrant visa through that program and wishing to use the \nprovisional waiver process are likely to enjoy fewer overall benefits from this rule than others. Although an \nindividual may be selected to participate in the Diversity Visa program, he or she may not ultimately receive an \nimmigrant visa due to visa unavailability. Under this rule, Diversity Visa selectees and their derivatives who wish to \nuse the provisional waiver process may file a waiver application before knowing whether their immigrant visa will \nultimately be available to them. For those pursuing the Diversity Visa track, the risk of completing the provisional \nwaiver process without being issued a visa is higher compared to applicants of other immigrant visa categories \nfiling Form I-601A.\\99\\ If a Diversity Visa program selectee's provisional waiver is approved but he or she is not \nultimately issued an immigrant visa, he or she will incur the costs but not obtain the benefits associated with a \nprovisional waiver. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\99\\ There is a statutory maximum of \n55,000 diversity visas authorized for allocation each fiscal year, but this number is reduced by up to 5,000 visas set \naside exclusively for use under the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act. See NACARA section 203(d), as \namended. DOS regularly selects more than 50,000 entrants to proceed on to the next step for diversity visa \nprocessing to ensure that all of the 50,000 diversity visas are allotted.

As previously [[Page 50272]] described in the 2013 Rule, the provisional waiver process allows \nUSCIS to communicate to DOS the status of the waiver application prior to an applicant's immigrant visa interview \nabroad. Such early communication eliminates the current need to transfer cases repeatedly between USCIS and \n\n\nDOS when adjudicating an immigrant visa application and Form I- 601.\\100\\ Through the provisional waiver \nprocess, DOS receives advance notification from USCIS of the discretionary decision to provisionally waive certain \nunlawful presence inadmissibility bars, allowing for better allocation of valuable agency resources like time, storage \nspace, and human capital. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\100\\ See 78 FR 536 (Jan. 3, \n2013). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- D. Executive Order 13132 This final rule will not \nhave substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the National Government and the States, \nor on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in \naccordance with section 6 of Executive Order 13132, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient \nfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism summary impact statement. E. Executive Order \n12988 Civil Justice Reform Section 3(c) of Executive Order 12988 requires Executive agencies to review \nregulations in light of applicable standards in section 3(a) and section 3(b) to determine whether they are met or it is \nunreasonable to meet one or more of them. DHS has completed the required review and determined that, to the \nextent permitted by law, this final rule meets the relevant standards of Executive Order 12988. F. Paperwork \nReduction Act Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), all Departments are required to submit to the \nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB), for review and approval, any reporting and recordkeeping requirements \ninherent in a rule. See 44 U.S.C. 3507. This final rule requires that an applicant seeking a provisional waiver \ncomplete an Application for Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver, Form I-601A, (OMB Control Number 1615-\n0123). This form is considered an information collection and is covered under the PRA. USCIS is currently seeking \nOMB approval of revisions that this final rule is causing to this information collection instrument. DHS specifically \nrequested public comments on the proposed changes to the Application for Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver, \nForm I-601A, and the form instructions in the proposed rule in accordance with 5 CFR 1320.11(a). OMB reviewed \nthe request filed in connection with the proposed rule and also filed comments in accordance with 5 CFR \n1320.11(c). 1. Comments on the Information Collection DHS received several comments from the public directly \nrelated to the revised form and its instructions, and, in accordance with 5 CFR 1320.11(f), DHS has considered the \ncomments, provided detailed responses to the comments on the form, and explained any modifications it has made \nin its submission to OMB. The comments and responses are summarized below. a. The General Need for a \nStandardized Application Form One commenter requested that USCIS adjudicate provisional waiver requests \nwithout requiring use of a specific form. The commenter believed requiring the completion of a standardized form \neffectively requires applicants to retain an immigration attorney, who may exploit them. DHS has not accepted the \nsuggestion. USCIS forms are generally designed for use by the public in a manner that standardizes the collection \nof necessary information and streamlines the adjudication of immigration benefits, which benefits both USCIS and \napplicants. Lack of a standardized information collection document, as well as the acceptance of ad hoc requests, \ncould cause confusion and processing delays that adversely impact both USCIS and applicants. Standardized \nintake methods and forms help USCIS streamline processing requirements and minimize its costs, thereby \nmoderating the fees it must charge for immigration benefit requests. b. Form I-601A, Information About Your \nImmigrant Visa Petition or Your Immigrant Visa Case DHS received several suggestions for improving the section \nof the form collecting information about the applicant's immigrant visa petition. Two commenters asked USCIS to \ninclude a section for applicants on Form I-601 \\101\\ to indicate the name of the employer, sponsor, or petitioner. \nOne of those commenters requested that the form include a section for applicants to submit information about \napproved Immigration Petitions for Alien Worker, Forms I-140, particularly for beneficiaries under the employment-\nbased third preference (EB-3) category. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\101\\ Both \ncommenters referred to Form I-601 rather than Form I- 601A. -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n---- DHS will not adopt this suggestion because it appears to be related to Form I-601 and not Form I-601A, the \nform used for this rule. Form I- 601A already includes questions about the name of the petitioning employer or \nsponsor. See Part 3, Information About Your Immigrant Visa Petition and Your Immigrant Visa Case, Item \nNumbers 3 through 6 of Form I-601A. Two commenters wanted to ensure that derivative spouses of principal \nbeneficiaries are eligible for the provisional waiver. They requested that USCIS specifically ask whether the \nindividual is filing this application based on an approved Form I-140 petition as a derivative spouse of the primary \nbeneficiary and to provide the USCIS receipt number for the Form I-140 petition. DHS agrees with the need to \ncollect additional information, as suggested by the commenters, in light of this final rule's extension of eligibility for \nthe provisional waiver to spouses and children who accompany or follow to join principal immigrants. DHS has \nadded questions to Form I-601A about derivative spouses or children that should address the concern raised by \n\n\n\nthe commenters. c. Form I-601A, Date of Entry and Place or Port of Entry One commenter suggested that Form I-\n601A applicants should be permitted to use approximate dates and places of entry when filling out the form, rather \nthan only specific dates or places of entry. The commenter reasoned that it may be difficult for some applicants, \nespecially those who entered at a young age or without lawful status, to specify an exact entry date or place. \nConsistent with these comments, DHS has revised Part 1 of Form I- 601A to permit applicants to provide \napproximate dates and places of entry, if necessary. Specifically, DHS added the phrase ``on or about'' to ``Date of \nEntry (mm/dd/yyyy)'' and ``(actual or approximate)'' after ``Place or Port-of-Entry (City or Town).'' d. Form I-601A, \nand Instructions, Certain Inadmissibility and Criminal History Issues One commenter requested that USCIS should \nnot require Form I-601A applicants to provide all related court dispositions regarding criminal history if the \ndisclosure of such court dispositions is prohibited by state law. The commenter was concerned that [[Page 50273]] \nsuch a requirement would effectively ask applicants to violate state confidentiality laws or request records that may \nbe impossible to obtain. DHS did not adopt this suggestion. DHS does not believe that an individual's request for \nhis or her own court dispositions, and the subsequent disclosure of that information to USCIS, would violate \nconfidentiality laws. Although state confidentiality laws may make it improper for a clerk of court to release \ninformation about a case to a third party, such laws do not prohibit the subjects of those proceedings from obtaining \ninformation about themselves.\\102\\ USCIS may request any evidence relevant to the adjudication of an immigration \nbenefit, including court records, when needed to assess the applicant's eligibility for the benefit. USCIS often \nrequires court records to assess an applicant's eligibility for a provisional waiver, as well as to determine whether \nthe applicant merits the waiver as a matter of discretion. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\\102\\ For example, California state law specifies that individuals can obtain a copy of their own case files and can \nsubsequently disclose such records freely. See Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code Sec. 827(a)(1)(C) and (5). -----------------------\n---------------------------------------------------- e. Form I-601A, Statement From Applicant A commenter suggested that \nUSCIS add questions related to hardship that would allow officers to quickly determine whether a threshold level of \nextreme hardship has been demonstrated. The commenter cited the Application for Suspension of Deportation or \nSpecial Rule Cancellation of Removal, Form I-881, as an example of a form that poses specific questions related to \nthe establishment of extreme hardship. DHS has not accepted this suggestion. Although Form I-881 includes \nquestions relating to potential hardship, that form--unlike the provisional waiver application (and the statutory \ninadmissibility waiver grounds upon which it is based)--is used solely to adjudicate relief under NACARA, and thus \nutilizes questions generally tracking pertinent regulations outlining hardship factors that may be considered under \nthe NACARA program. See 8 CFR 240.64; 8 CFR 1240.58(b). Because similar regulations do not exist in the \nprovisional waiver context, DHS does not believe that adding specific hardship questions to Form I-601A is \nappropriate. Among other things, such questions may be understood as setting the contours of the extreme \nhardship determination in the provisional waiver context, which may unintentionally lead applicants to restrict the \ntypes of evidence they submit to establish extreme hardship. Moreover, DHS notes that USCIS does provide, in the \nrelevant form instructions, a list of non-exclusive factors that may be considered in making extreme hardship \ndeterminations. See Instructions to Form I-601 and Form I-601A. f. Form I-601A Instructions, Criminal History \nIssues One commenter suggested clarifications to the Form I-601A instructions regarding documentation of criminal \nhistory in two scenarios: those involving brief detentions and those where criminal records do not exist. First, the \ncommenter suggested a change to the instructions to clarify that the relevant documentation requirements do not \napply to an applicant unless he or she has been arrested for, or charged with, a criminal offense (i.e., not individuals \nwho were simply stopped or questioned by law enforcement authorities). Second, the commenter suggested a \nchange to the instructions to clarify that an applicant may submit documents from a relevant court to show the lack \nof criminal charge or prosecution. To accomplish these two suggestions, the commenter recommended amending \nthe instructions by inserting the following underlined text (and deleting the following text that has been struck \nthrough) in the instruction for Item Number 31: ``For Item Number 31, if you were arrested but not charged with any \ncrime or offense, provide a statement or other documentation from the arresting authority, or prosecutor's office, or \ncourt, if available, to show that you were not charged with any crime or offense.'' In response to these suggestions, \nDHS has inserted the words ``arrested but'' and ``or court'' into the relevant instruction as suggested by the \ncommenter. DHS agrees that the insertion of this language would provide additional clarity to applicants. DHS, \nhowever, did not add the words ``if available'' as suggested by the commenter, because USCIS believes it is self-\nevident that documents cannot be provided if they are not available. In this final rule, USCIS has provided \napplicants with various ways to prove the absence of a criminal conviction without necessarily specifying or limiting \n\n\n\nthe types of documents USCIS will consider. g. Form I-601A Instructions, Purpose of Form I-601A A commenter \nsuggested adding language to the Form I-601A instructions clarifying the categories of individuals who may be \neligible to apply for provisional waivers under this rule. Specifically, the commenter suggested adding the following \nunderlined text to ensure that certain individuals are eligible to apply for provisional waivers: ``Certain immigrant \nvisa applicants who are relatives of U.S. citizen or Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs); family- sponsored \nimmigrants; employment-based immigrants; special immigrants; and participants in the Diversity Visa Program \nmay use this application to request a provisional waiver of the unlawful presence grounds.'' DHS has not adopted \nthis suggestion. DHS believes the pre-existing language accurately captures those who have the requisite family \nrelationships to apply for provisional waivers, including those who have become newly eligible to apply under this \nrulemaking. DHS believes the additional language suggested by the commenter could be read to imply that an \napplicant is not required to have the requisite relationship with a U.S. citizen or LPR in order to apply for a \nprovisional waiver. DHS has thus not amended this portion of the Form I-601A instructions. h. Form I-601A \nInstructions, Who May File One commenter suggested that DHS add language to the Form I-601A instructions \nstating that individuals who are not immediate relatives and who filed more than one Form I-601A application are \nstill eligible to file a subsequent Form I-601A application even if DOS acted, before the effective date of this rule, to \nschedule their first immigrant visa interview. DHS has not adopted this suggestion. As noted previously, this final \nrule eliminates the regulatory provisions that make individuals ineligible for provisional waivers depending on the \ndate on which DOS initially acted to schedule their immigrant visa interviews. Therefore, the commenter's \nsuggested amendment is now unnecessary. i. Form I-601A Instructions, Can I file other forms with Form I-601A? \nOne commenter suggested adding text to the Form I-601A instructions indicating that an applicant may request \nelectronic notification of USCIS acceptance of the filing of Form I-601A by filing Form G-1145, E- Notification of \nApplication/Petition Acceptance, along with Form I- 601A. DHS adopted this suggestion. [[Page 50274]] j. Form I-\n601A Instructions, General Instructions One commenter suggested changes to the Form I-601A instructions to \nmake it easier for individuals with a physical or developmental disability or mental impairment to request waivers. \nSpecifically, the commenter recommended replacing the portion of the Form I-601A instructions concerning the \nability of a legal guardian to sign for a mentally incompetent individual with the following: ``A designated \nrepresentative may sign if the requestor is unable to sign due to a physical or developmental disability or mental \nimpairment.'' DHS has not adopted this suggestion, as the Department believes that current regulations are \nsufficient to address the commenter's concerns. First, current regulations provide that a legal guardian may sign for \nan individual who is mentally incompetent. See 8 CFR 103.2(a)(2). Second, even if no legal guardianship has been \nestablished, applicants with disabilities have various options for affecting signatures. Under USCIS policy, a valid \nsignature does not need to be legible or in English, and it may be abbreviated provided it is consistent with the \nmanner in which the individual normally signs his or her name. An individual who is unable to write in any language \nmay place an ``X'' or similar mark in lieu of a signature. DHS believes existing regulations already address the \ncommenters concern and did not adopt the suggestion. k. Form I-601A Instructions, General Instructions One \ncommenter requested that DHS include an example of a translation certification in the Form I-601A instructions. \nDHS did not adopt this suggestion. Regulations require that any document containing foreign language submitted to \nUSCIS must be accompanied by (1) a full English language translation that the translator has certified as complete \nand accurate, and (2) the translator's certification that he or she is competent to translate from the foreign language \ninto English. See 8 CFR 103.2(b)(3). DHS believes the regulation is sufficiently clear, and the Department is worried \nthat providing an example translation certification will be understood by applicants as a required form, thus \neffectively limiting options for obtaining translation services. l. Form I-601A Instructions, Specific Instructions One \ncommenter suggested providing applicants with additional instructions to help clarify when individuals are deemed \nto be admitted or to have entered without inspection. Specifically, the commenter suggested that DHS replace the \nterm ``EWI'' (entry without inspection) with ``no lawful status'' in the Form I-601A instructions and to add a note to \nthe instructions indicating that applicants without lawful status who entered at a port of entry may have nevertheless \nentered pursuant to inspection and admission. The commenter, citing to the decision of the Board of Immigration \nAppeals at Matter of Quilantan, 25 I. & N. Dec. 285 (BIA 2010), stated that an individual without lawful status who is \nnevertheless permitted to enter the United States at a port of entry may be ``admitted,'' even if the inspection at the \nport did not comply with substantive legal requirements and there is no record of the individual having been \nadmitted in any particular status. DHS has not adopted these suggestions. DHS believes that the form instructions \nare sufficiently clear for applicants to appropriately answer all relevant questions. DHS does not believe it is \n\n\n\nnecessary to add reminders or warnings on the issue raised by the commenter, as DHS does not believe that an \napplicant will erroneously state that he or she is present without admission or parole. m. Form I-601A Instructions, \nImmigration or Criminal History One commenter requested that the Form I-601A instructions be amended to provide \ninformation about grants of voluntary departure and how such grants affect the provisional waiver process. \nSpecifically, the commenter requested that the instructions include a provision specifying that an immigration judge \nmay grant voluntary departure, or dismiss or terminate removal proceedings, prior to the applicant leaving the \nUnited States for immigrant visa processing. DHS has not adopted this suggestion, as an individual granted \nvoluntary departure is not eligible for a provisional waiver. USCIS, however, modified Form I-601A by including a \nquestion asking whether the applicant has been granted voluntary departure. USCIS also made corresponding \namendments in the form instructions. n. Form I-601A Instructions, Penalties One commenter asserted that USCIS \nestablished an overly broad standard for denying Form I-601A applications, as well as other immigration benefits, \ndue to the submission of false documents with such applications. To address this concern, the commenter \nsuggested that the Form I-601A instructions be amended to indicate that applications will be denied only if the \napplicants submit ``materially'' false documents. DHS has not adopted the commenter's suggestion, as there are \nexisting statutory requirements regarding the use of false documents. DHS, however, has modified the relevant \nlanguage in the form instructions to more closely match the language of 8 U.S.C. 1324c and 18 U.S.C. 1001(a), \nwhich relate to civil and criminal penalties for the use of false documents to defraud the U.S. Government or obtain \nan immigration benefit. The new language reads, ``If you knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal a material fact or \nsubmit a false, altered, forged, or counterfeited writing or document with your Form I- 601A, we will deny your Form \nI-601A and may deny any other immigration benefit.'' 2. Changes to the Information Collection (OMB Control No. \n1615-0123) DHS has revised the Form I-601A as indicated in the preceding responses. The revised form and \ninstructions are available for review at            http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain under OMB control number \n1615-0123, or at            https://www.regulations.gov/#!home in docket USCIS- 2012-0003. As a result of the final \nrule's elimination or modification of certain provisional waiver eligibility criteria, and a result of newer and better \ndata and historical source data revisions,\\103\\ DHS has updated the supporting statement for the Form I-601A. The \nupdate reflects changes in the respondent estimates that USCIS projected in the 2015 Proposed Rule. In the 2015 \nProposed Rule, DHS estimated that approximately 10,258 new respondents would file applications for provisional \nwaivers because of the changes proposed by the rule. DHS also estimated that 42,707 individuals currently eligible \nfor provisional waivers would file Form I-601 applications in the future. DHS has revised these estimates, projecting \nthat approximately 9,191 new respondents will file applications for provisional waivers because of the changes in \nthis final rule and 43,728 individuals currently eligible for provisional waivers will file Form I-601 applications in the \nfuture. With these changes in the number of Form I-601A applications, the estimate for the total number of \nrespondents has been [[Page 50275]] updated from 52,965 to 52,918, which represents a decrease of 47 \nrespondents. The current burden hour inventory approved for this form is 141,417 hours, and the requested new \ntotal hour burden is 141,292 hours. This revision reflects an increase (47,841 annual burden hours) in the annual \nburden hours previously reported for this information collection. ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n------ \\103\\ DOS determined that its rules used to collect the inadmissibility data included in the 2015 Proposed \nRule resulted in errors. DOS has since revised its rules to correct the errors. ---------------------------------------------------\n------------------------ Overview of this information collection (OMB Control Number 1615- 0123): (1) Type of \nInformation Collection: Revision of a Currently Approved Collection. (2) Title of the Form/Collection: Application for \nProvisional Unlawful Presence Waiver. (3) Agency form number, if any, and the applicable component of the DHS \nsponsoring, the collection: I-601A; USCIS. (4) Affected public who will be asked or required to respond, as well as a \nbrief abstract: Primary: Individuals or households: Individuals who are: (a) Immigrant visa applicants, including (1) \nimmediate relatives, (2) individuals seeking to immigrate under a family-sponsored, employment-based, or special \nimmigrant visa category, or (3) Diversity Visa selectees and derivatives; and (b) applying from within the United \nStates for a provisional waiver under INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(v), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B)(v), before obtaining an \nimmigrant visa abroad.

G. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-\n612, as amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, Public Law 104-121 (March \n29, 1996), requires Federal agencies to consider the potential impact of regulations on small businesses, small \ngovernmental jurisdictions, and small organizations during the development of their rules. The term ``small entities'' \ncomprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not \ndominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. DHS has reviewed this \nregulation in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act and certifies that this rule will not have a significant \neconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The factual basis for this determination is that this rule \ndirectly regulates individuals, who are not, for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, within the definition of small \nentities established by 5 U.S.C. 601(6). DHS received no public comments challenging this certification. List of \nSubjects Accordingly, DHS adopts the regulatory amendments proposed on July 22, 2015. In addition, DHS \nmodifies certain provisions based on comments received in response to the proposed rule so that chapter I of title 8 \nof the Code of Federal Regulations reads as follows: 8 CFR Part 103 Administrative practice and procedure, \nAuthority delegations (Government agencies), Freedom of information, Privacy, Reporting and recordkeeping \nrequirements, Surety bonds. 8 CFR Part 212 Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Immigration, Passports \nand visas, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. PART 103--IMMIGRATION BENEFITS; BIOMETRIC \nREQUIREMENTS; AVAILABILITY OF RECORDS 0 1. The authority citation for part 103 continues to read as \nfollows: Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301, 552, 552a; 8 U.S.C. 1101, 1103, 1304, 1356; 31 U.S.C. 9701; Pub.

PART 212--DOCUMENTARY REQUIREMENTS; NONIMMIGRANTS; WAIVERS; \nADMISSION OF CERTAIN INADMISSIBLE ALIENS; PAROLE 0 3. The authority citation for part 212 continues to \nread as follows: Authority: 8 U.S.C. 1101 and note, 1102, 1103, 1182 and note, 1184, 1187, 1223, 1225, 1226, \n1227, 1255, 1359; 8 U.S.C. 1185 note (section 7209 of Pub.

Removing \nthe paragraph (a) subject heading; and 0 b. Revising paragraph (e). The revision reads as follows: 212.7 Waivers of \ncertain grounds of inadmissibility. * * * * * (e) Provisional unlawful presence waivers of inadmissibility. The \nprovisions of this paragraph (e) apply to certain aliens who are pursuing consular immigrant visa processing. (1) \nJurisdiction. USCIS has exclusive jurisdiction to grant a provisional unlawful presence waiver under this paragraph \n(e). An alien applying for a provisional unlawful presence waiver must file with USCIS the form designated by \nUSCIS, with the fees prescribed in 8 CFR 103.7(b), and in accordance with the form instructions. (2) Provisional \nunlawful presence waiver; in general. (i) USCIS may adjudicate applications for a provisional unlawful presence \nwaiver of inadmissibility based on section 212(a)(9)(B)(v) of the Act filed by eligible aliens described in paragraph \n(e)(3) of this section. USCIS will only approve such provisional unlawful presence waiver applications in accordance \nwith the conditions outlined in paragraph (e) of this section. Consistent with section 212(a)(9)(B)(v) of the Act, the \ndecision whether to approve a provisional unlawful presence waiver application is discretionary. A pending or \napproved provisional unlawful presence waiver does not constitute a grant of a lawful immigration status or a period \nof stay authorized by the Secretary. (ii) A pending or an approved provisional unlawful presence waiver does not \nsupport the filing of any application for interim immigration benefits, such as employment authorization or an \nadvance parole document. Any application for an advance parole document or employment authorization that is \nsubmitted in connection with a provisional unlawful presence waiver application will be rejected. [[Page 50276]] (3) \nEligible aliens. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, an alien may be eligible to apply for and \nreceive a provisional unlawful presence waiver for the grounds of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(I) or \n(II) of the Act if he or she meets the requirements in this paragraph. An alien may be eligible to apply for and \nreceive a waiver if he or she: (i) Is present in the United States at the time of filing the application for a provisional \nunlawful presence waiver; (ii) Provides biometrics to USCIS at a location in the United States designated by USCIS; \n(iii) Upon departure, would be inadmissible only under section 212(a)(9)(B)(i) of the Act at the time of the \nimmigrant visa interview; (iv) Has a case pending with the Department of State, based on: (A) An approved \nimmigrant visa petition, for which the Department of State immigrant visa processing fee has been paid; or (B) \nSelection by the Department of State to participate in the Diversity Visa Program under section 203(c) of the Act for \n\n\n\nthe fiscal year for which the alien registered; (v) Will depart from the United States to obtain the immigrant visa; \nand (vi) Meets the requirements for a waiver provided in section 212(a)(9)(B)(v) of the Act. (4) Ineligible aliens. \nNotwithstanding paragraph (e)(3) of this section, an alien is ineligible for a provisional unlawful presence waiver \nunder paragraph (e) of this section if: (i) The alien is under the age of 17; (ii) The alien does not have a case \npending with the Department of State, based on: (A) An approved immigrant visa petition, for which the \nDepartment of State immigrant visa processing fee has been paid; or (B) Selection by the Department of State to \nparticipate in the Diversity Visa program under section 203(c) of the Act for the fiscal year for which the alien \nregistered; (iii) The alien is in removal proceedings, in which no final order has been entered, unless the removal \nproceedings are administratively closed and have not been recalendared at the time of filing the application for a \nprovisional unlawful presence waiver; (iv) The alien is subject to an administratively final order of removal, \ndeportation, or exclusion under any provision of law (including an in absentia order under section 240(b)(5) of the \nAct), unless the alien has already filed and USCIS has already granted, before the alien applies for a provisional \nunlawful presence waiver under 8 CFR 212.7(e), an application for consent to reapply for admission under section \n212(a)(9)(A)(iii) of the Act and 8 CFR 212.2(j); (v) CBP or ICE, after service of notice under 8 CFR 241.8, has \nreinstated a prior order of removal under section 241(a)(5) of the Act, either before the filing of the provisional \nunlawful presence waiver application or while the provisional unlawful presence waiver application is pending; or \n(vi) The alien has a pending application with USCIS for lawful permanent resident status. (5) Filing. (i) An alien must \nfile an application for a provisional unlawful presence waiver of the unlawful presence inadmissibility bars under \nsection 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(I) or (II) of the Act on the form designated by USCIS, in accordance with the form \ninstructions, with the fee prescribed in 8 CFR 103.7(b), and with the evidence required by the form instructions. (ii) \nAn application for a provisional unlawful presence waiver will be rejected and the fee and package returned to the \nalien if the alien: (A) Fails to pay the required filing fee or correct filing fee for the provisional unlawful presence \nwaiver application; (B) Fails to sign the provisional unlawful presence waiver application; (C) Fails to provide his or \nher family name, domestic home address, and date of birth; (D) Is under the age of 17; (E) Does not include \nevidence of: (1) An approved immigrant visa petition; (2) Selection by the Department of State to participate in the \nDiversity Visa Program under section 203(c) of the Act for the fiscal year for which the alien registered; or (3) \nEligibility as a derivative beneficiary of an approved immigrant visa petition or of an alien selected for participation \nin the Diversity Visa Program as provided in this section and outlined in section 203(d) of the Act. (F) Fails to \ninclude documentation evidencing: (1) That the alien has paid the immigrant visa processing fee to the \nDepartment of State for the immigrant visa application upon which the alien's approved immigrant visa petition is \nbased; or (2) In the case of a diversity immigrant, that the Department of State selected the alien to participate in \nthe Diversity Visa Program for the fiscal year for which the alien registered. (6) Biometrics. (i) All aliens who apply \nfor a provisional unlawful presence waiver under this section will be required to provide biometrics in accordance \nwith 8 CFR 103.16 and 103.17, as specified on the form instructions. (ii) Failure to appear for biometric services. If \nan alien fails to appear for a biometric services appointment or fails to provide biometrics in the United States as \ndirected by USCIS, a provisional unlawful presence waiver application will be considered abandoned and denied \nunder 8 CFR 103.2(b)(13). The alien may not appeal or file a motion to reopen or reconsider an abandonment \ndenial under 8 CFR 103.5. (7) Burden and standard of proof. The alien has the burden to establish, by a \npreponderance of the evidence, eligibility for a provisional unlawful presence waiver as described in this paragraph, \nand under section 212(a)(9)(B)(v) of the Act, including that the alien merits a favorable exercise of discretion. (8) \nAdjudication. USCIS will adjudicate a provisional unlawful presence waiver application in accordance with this \nparagraph and section 212(a)(9)(B)(v) of the Act. If USCIS finds that the alien is not eligible for a provisional \nunlawful presence waiver, or if USCIS determines in its discretion that a waiver is not warranted, USCIS will deny \nthe waiver application. Notwithstanding 8 CFR 103.2(b)(16), USCIS may deny an application for a provisional \nunlawful presence waiver without prior issuance of a request for evidence or notice of intent to deny. (9) Notice of \ndecision. (i) USCIS will notify the alien and the alien's attorney of record or accredited representative of the decision \nin accordance with 8 CFR 103.2(b)(19). USCIS may notify the Department of State of the denial of an application \nfor a provisional unlawful presence waiver. A denial is without prejudice to the alien's filing another provisional \nunlawful presence waiver application under this paragraph (e), provided the alien meets all of the requirements in \nthis part, including that the alien's case must be pending with the Department of State. An alien also may elect to \nfile a waiver application under paragraph (a)(1) of this section after departing the United States, appearing for his or \nher immigrant visa interview at the U.S. Embassy or consulate abroad, and after the Department of State \n\n\n\ndetermines the alien's admissibility and eligibility for an immigrant visa. (ii) Denial of an application for a provisional \nunlawful presence waiver is not a final agency action for purposes of [[Page 50277]] section 10(c) of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 704. (10) Withdrawal of waiver applications. An alien may withdraw his or \nher application for a provisional unlawful presence waiver at any time before USCIS makes a final decision. Once \nthe case is withdrawn, USCIS will close the case and notify the alien and his or her attorney or accredited \nrepresentative. The alien may file a new application for a provisional unlawful presence waiver, in accordance with \nthe form instructions and required fees, provided that the alien meets all of the requirements included in this \nparagraph (e). (11) Appeals and motions to reopen. There is no administrative appeal from a denial of a request for \na provisional unlawful presence waiver under this section. The alien may not file, pursuant to 8 CFR 103.5, a motion \nto reopen or reconsider a denial of a provisional unlawful presence waiver application under this section. (12) \nApproval and conditions. A provisional unlawful presence waiver granted under this section: (i) Does not take effect \nunless, and until, the alien who applied for and obtained the provisional unlawful presence waiver: (A) Departs from \nthe United States; (B) Appears for an immigrant visa interview at a U.S. Embassy or consulate; and (C) Is \ndetermined to be otherwise eligible for an immigrant visa by the Department of State in light of the approved \nprovisional unlawful presence waiver. (ii) Waives, upon satisfaction of the conditions described in paragraph \n(e)(12)(i), the alien's inadmissibility under section 212(a)(9)(B) of the Act only for purposes of the application for an \nimmigrant visa and admission to the United States as an immigrant based on the approved immigrant visa \npetition upon which a provisional unlawful presence waiver application is based or selection by the Department of \nState to participate in the Diversity Visa Program under section 203(c) of the Act for the fiscal year for which the \nalien registered, with such selection being the basis for the alien's provisional unlawful presence waiver application; \n(iii) Does not waive any ground of inadmissibility other than, upon satisfaction of the conditions described in \nparagraph (e)(12)(i), the grounds of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(I) or (II) of the Act. (13) Validity. \nUntil the provisional unlawful presence waiver takes full effect as provided in paragraph (e)(12) of this section, \nUSCIS may reopen and reconsider its decision at any time. Once a provisional unlawful presence waiver takes full \neffect as defined in paragraph (e)(12) of this section, the period of unlawful presence for which the provisional \nunlawful presence waiver is granted is waived indefinitely, in accordance with and subject to paragraph (a)(4) of this \nsection. (14) Automatic revocation. The approval of a provisional unlawful presence waiver is revoked automatically \nif: (i) The Department of State denies the immigrant visa application after completion of the immigrant visa \ninterview based on a finding that the alien is ineligible to receive an immigrant visa for any reason other than \ninadmissibility under section 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(I) or (II) of the Act. This automatic revocation does not prevent the alien \nfrom applying for a waiver of inadmissibility for unlawful presence under section 212(a)(9)(B)(v) of the Act and 8 \nCFR 212.7(a) or for any other relief from inadmissibility on any other ground for which a waiver is available and for \nwhich the alien may be eligible; (ii) The immigrant visa petition approval associated with the provisional unlawful \npresence waiver is at any time revoked, withdrawn, or rendered invalid but not otherwise reinstated for \nhumanitarian reasons or converted to a widow or widower petition; (iii) The immigrant visa registration is \nterminated in accordance with section 203(g) of the Act, and has not been reinstated in accordance with section \n203(g) of the Act; or (iv) The alien enters or attempts to reenter the United States without inspection and admission \nor parole at any time after the alien files the provisional unlawful presence waiver application and before the \napproval of the provisional unlawful presence waiver takes effect in accordance with paragraph (e)(12) of this \nsection.
