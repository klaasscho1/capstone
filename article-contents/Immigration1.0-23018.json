{"title": "Trucker guilty in smuggling deaths", "body": "\nHOUSTON \u2014 A Texas jury Monday convicted a truck driver on all 58 counts against him for his role in the deaths \nof 19 people during a bungled human smuggling attempt.\n\nTyrone Williams, 35, faces a possible death sentence or life in prison. The punishment phase of the trial will start \nWednesday and is expected to last about a week.\n\nWilliams stared ahead and showed no emotion when the verdict was read but later hugged his lawyer, Craig \nWashington, before being led away by U.S. Marshals.\n\nProsecutors declined to comment but told U.S. District Judge Lee Rosenthal they expect to call about 25 witnesses \nduring the sentencing trial.\n\nIn May 2003, Williams hauled more than 70 immigrants in a trailer from south Texas to a truck stop near Houston. \nAs temperatures inside the trailer rose, the increasingly desperate riders peeled off their clothes, punched out \ntaillights for air and shouted for help.\n\nBy the time Williams opened the door about 3\u00bd hours later, 17 people had died of dehydration, overheating or \nsuffocation. Two others died later.\n\nWilliams abandoned the trailer at a truck stop and fled to Houston, 100 miles away. He was arrested after walking \ninto a hospital complaining of anxiety.\n\nDuring the trial, the jury of seven women and five men watched as grieving family members from Mexico, \nHonduras, El Salvador and the Dominican Republic identified their relatives from grisly photos. One showed a 5-\nyear-old boy who had died in the arms of his father.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Rodriguez told jurors Williams was a \"vile and heartless truck driver\" who ignored the \nsuffering of the riders. Williams' lawyers said he didn't know how many people were packed into his trailer and didn't \nunderstand their cries for help, which were made in Spanish.\n\nWilliams' first trial ended in a hung jury in March 2005.\n"}
