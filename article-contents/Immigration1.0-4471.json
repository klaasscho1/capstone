{"title": "INS Seeks to Fine Eastern Shore Business", "body": "\nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service notified an Eastern Shore nursery yesterday that the agency intends to \nfine the company $ 44,900 for hiring 26 undocumented workers.\n\nAngelica Nurseries, of Kennedyville, Md., has 30 days to request a hearing to answer charges contained in the \nlegal notice. If the company does not, the fine becomes automatic.\n\nThe notice is the result of an INS raid in September 1996 that resulted in the arrest of 87 undocumented workers at \nAngelica Nurseries. INS agents say they have evidence that the company knowingly hired 26 of the workers in \nviolation of federal law. Since 1991, the agency has punished more than 290 Maryland employers, with total fines \nexceeding $ 2.5 million.\n"}
