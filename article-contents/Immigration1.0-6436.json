{"title": "A Multi-Ethnic Kosovo Doesn't Make Sense;Billboards of Hate", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nRe \"Some Immigrants Have Angry Words for Queens Billboard\" (news article, Aug. 5):\n\nNearly every significant movement of hate has centered around the notion that certain members of society \nbelonged while others were forcing their way in, keeping the \"insiders\" from their entitled resources, prosperity and \nplace of prominence. In the most famous case, the \"outsiders\" were Jews in Germany. While it is well known that \nsix million eventually paid with their lives for being different, this began with public displays of swastikas and anti-\nJewish slogans depicting Jews as unwelcome.\n\nThe message that is being sent by the anti-immigration slogans on billboards erected by Craig Nelsen, a Queens \nresident, in largely immigrant neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens fits this model perfectly. These billboards \nshould be recognized for what they truly are.\n\n \n\nERIC ZEIDMAN\n\nRidgewood, Queens, Aug. 5, 1999\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
