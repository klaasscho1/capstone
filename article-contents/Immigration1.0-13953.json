{"title": "Substance Leads to Penn Station Drama", "body": "\nA Liberian man who provoked the suspicions of the authorities on an Amtrak train on Tuesday -- and spurred the \npartial evacuation of Pennsylvania Station in New York -- was in federal custody last night facing a charge of illegal \nimmigration.\n\nThe man was identified by The Associated Press as Nasrat Youssef Kafal. \n\nHis luggage was searched because officials believed he might be carrying hazardous materials. \n\n     An official close the investigation, who insisted on anonymity, said last night that the suspicious substance \nturned out to be cooking oil. \n\n But James Margolin, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said Mr. Kafal did not have a valid visa \nwhen he was questioned on the train. As a result, he was turned over to the federal Bureau of Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement, and could face deportation, Mr. Margolin said.\n\nThe incident resulted in widespread disruption for train passengers on Tuesday, with Amtrak service halted for \nnearly three hours. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
