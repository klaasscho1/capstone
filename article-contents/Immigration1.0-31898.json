{"title": "Fulfilling U.S. humanitarian obligations to assist refugees", "body": "\nMolly Groom\n\nChief, Refugee and Asylum Law Division, Office of the Chief Counsel, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \n(USCIS), Department of Homeland Security \n\nBest known for: For the past 15 years, Groom has dedicated her career to helping refugees. She oversees a team \nof 12 lawyers, who provide legal advice on humanitarian issues for people inside and outside the United States. \nThis includes those who have been displaced by war, famine, and civil and political unrest, or have been forced to \nflee their countries to escape the risk of death and torture. Groom and her team work on a variety of legal issues, \nincluding those involving refugee and asylum status, victims of human trafficking or other violent crimes, and \nbattered spouses, children and parents.\n\nGovernment service: Groom has been the chief of the USCIS refugee and asylum law division since 2002. She \npreviously served as an associate general counsel with the Justice Department's Immigration and Naturalization \nService (INS) and spent a year working as a legal adviser with the United Nations Transitional Authority in East \nTimor,  gathering evidence of and prosecuting war crimes and abuses. Groom began her career as an INS trial \nlawyer in New York.\n\nBiggest challenge: Groom says the biggest challenge of her job is addressing the misperception that providing \nprotection for refugees comes at the expense of ensuring  national security when \"disciplined attention to our \nhumanitarian obligations and commitments is not only consistent with, but also advances, our national security.\"\n\nQuote: \"I feel so lucky to be able to work on providing protection to those in need. To be able to describe your job \nas helping the government do the right thing in the field of protection is an amazing thing.\" \n\n- From the Partnership\n\n for Public Service \n"}
