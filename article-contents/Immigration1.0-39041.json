{"title": "Immigration service calls NHL's Probert a danger", "body": "\nImmigration and Naturalization Service officials and lawyers for Bob Probert paint contrasting pictures of the \nDetroit Red Wings player.\n\nProbert was convicted and served a prison sentence for bringing a small amount of cocaine into the USA from \nCanada.\nHe has been ordered deported by the INS.\n\nINS officials call him a danger to the public whose ''rehabilitation must be questioned.'' Probert's lawyers say he is \na ''public figure \u2026 similar to \u2026 Babe Ruth'' and ''a benefit to the country.''\n\nThose differing pictures of Probert are found in documents filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals in Falls \nChurch, Va., obtained by The Detroit News under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. The documents were part of \nProbert's appeal of a ruling by the INS denying his latest request to be allowed to travel to Canada to play hockey.\n\nProbert is barred from leaving the USA, unless he is willing to do so permanently. He is appealing the deportation \norder to the Board of Immigration Appeals.\n\nThe newspaper disclosed Probert had amassed more than a dozen tickets and suspensions, half of them after his \n1989 cocaine conviction, and received repeated breaks from police, prosecutors and judges. In one instance, he \nwas clocked at 95 mph in a 55 mph zone but was allowed to plead guilty to doing 60.\n\nAlthough Probert's driving record is of minimal importance compared to his cocaine conviction, the government \nargued, his ''repeated brushes with the law are indicative of his true attitude toward society and rehabilitation.''\n\nHis lawyers hope to show that Probert drank and used drugs because of a medical condition, an attention deficit \ndisorder, and was wrongfully judged to be an alcoholic - thus removing one of the reasons for the deportation order.\n"}
