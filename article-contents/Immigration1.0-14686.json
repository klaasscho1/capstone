{"title": "'Undocumented Worker' Means 'Illegal Alien'", "body": "\n  The Post uses the phrases \"undocumented immigrants\" or \"undocumented workers\" to describe illegal aliens. \n\nThese terms are not legally accurate and seem to be used to soften the nature of what is really occurring. \n\n Our federal immigration laws do not refer to those who came into this country illegally as \"undocumented \nimmigrants\" or \"undocumented workers.\" It calls them \"aliens\" who are \"present in violation of law.\" A more \nappropriate term for  such people  is  \"illegal alien.\" Clearly, one who has violated our immigration laws to remain \nin the United States has engaged in illegal behavior. \n\nLAMAR SMITH \n\nU.S. Representative (R-Tex.) \n\nWashington \n"}
