His \nrequest has also been granted, but China has not made an issue of his case, according to the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service. ''I received no contact from the Chinese Government, and I'm not aware of any other \ncontacts,'' says William J.\n\nChambers, the district immigration director in Dallas who processed Mr. Ling's application.  Mr. Ling, who now \nspells his name John Wey Ling, is principal dancer with the City Ballet in Fort Worth, Tex., and is on the faculty of \nthe Southwest Ballet Center in Fort Worth, says the director of both organizations, William Martin-Viscount. In \naddition Mr. Ling performs independently.\n\n''He just got back from London,'' Mr. Martin-Viscount says, ''and I know he's also negotiating a contract to go to \nHong Kong very soon.'' ''He's sought after,'' the ballet director says.\n"}
