{"title": "THREATS AND RESPONSES: IMMIGRATION; U.S. Crackdown Sets Off Unusual Rush to Canada", "body": "\nOnce Jalil Mirza decided to leave the United States to avoid possible deportation, nothing happened quite as he \nexpected, not even goodbye.\n\n     As did hundreds of other Pakistanis fleeing a post-9/11 crackdown on illegal immigrants, Mr. Mirza quit his job, \npacked up his possessions and headed north rather than face a forced return to Pakistan. \n\n After a 16-hour bus ride from Virginia with his wife and seven children, he arrived at the Canadian border, hoping to \ntake advantage of Canada's political asylum law. \n\nBut besieged Canadian officials told him to come back in two weeks. And when he dragged their suitcases back to \nthe American side, United States immigration agents promptly arrested him and his two teenage sons, leaving the \nrest of the family wailing in despair in the icy cold.\n\nThe Mirzas are part of an unusual and chaotic exodus that has jammed land crossings from the United States into \nCanada over the past two weeks, overwhelming immigration officials and refugee aid groups on both sides of the \nborder.\n\nIt is an oddly reluctant migration toward a presumed safe haven by people who say they do not really want to go but \nfeel compelled to for fear that they could be deported.\n\nPrompted by rumors of dragnets and by new federal deadlines that require male foreign visitors, principally those \nfrom Muslim and Arab countries, to register with the government, families that lived illegally but undisturbed in the \nUnited States for years are now rushing to Canada. They get across the border only to be bounced back into the \nhands and jails of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n\nAsylum applications to Canada have increased sharply since the beginning of the year, according to aid workers \nand officials on both sides of the border. Most of the applicants are Pakistanis, who are required to register with the \nAmerican immigration service by March 21. Other nationality groups also face various registration deadlines, but \nhave not noticeably flooded the border.\n\nMany of the Pakistani asylum seekers said they decided to flee to Canada because they knew that Canada was \nalready home to a large and growing population of Pakistani immigrants, especially in Montreal and Toronto. \n\nEven before the latest upswing this month and last month, Pakistanis accounted for the largest number of asylum \napplications to Canada, according to Citizenship and Immigration Canada. \n\n\nRefugee aid workers also speculated that the registration requirement hit Pakistani immigrants harder than other \ngroups because more of them lived illegally in the United States and had less time to legalize their status through \nfamily ties or employment. A result is that hundreds of would-be refugees, some from as far away as Texas, are \nnow camped out in Salvation Army shelters, mosques and other lodgings along the border, waiting for \nappointments to apply for asylum and struggling to find money to pay the bond to get their male relatives out of \nimmigration detention. \n\nTheir common refrain, as was Mr. Mirza's, is that they love America and do not want to leave.\n\nA former restaurant manager in Virginia with four young children born in the United States, Mr. Mirza, 45, managed \nto scrape together the $4,500 he needed to get himself and his older sons out of jail on bond. His family stayed two \nweeks in a shelter in Burlington, until today when they had an 8 a.m. appointment with Canadian immigration \nofficials. \n\nBut Mr. Mirza wanted to show, one last time, that his heart was in the United States. \"I'm going to turn and salute \nthe American flag,\" he said as he approached the border. \"I love America.\"\n\nEven that plan, though, went awry. In the most prosaic of farewells, after filling out forms for eight hours he and his \nfamily were driven straight to the Canadian post at St. Bernard Lacolle, Quebec, early in the morning under a milky \novercast sky. No one bothered to stop him on the American side, where the nearest flag hung limply on a pole in \nthe distance. \n\n\"This is one of the most tragic events I've ever witnessed, seeing this exodus of good, hard-working families,\" said \nPatrick Giantonio, executive director of Vermont Refugee Assistance, which had found the shelter for the Mirzas \nand dozens of other Pakistani families trying to reach Canada. \n\n\"It's a tragedy not just for their communities,\" Mr. Giantonio added, \"but for the American community.\" \n\nSimilar stories are playing out all along the northern border. \n\nAt crossing points in British Columbia, some 70 people, most of them Pakistanis, asked for asylum in January. In all \nof 2002, officials said, only 36 Pakistanis made refugee claims. \n\nAt land crossings into Ontario, 871 people applied for asylum in January, double the number just two months \nearlier. Last November, 5 percent of the asylum seekers were Pakistani. Last month, 49 percent were Pakistani, \naccording to Canadian immigration officials in Toronto. \n\nFreedom House, an immigrant aid group in Detroit, said that since the beginning of the year it had registered 269 \nMuslim asylum seekers trying to reach Canada in advance of their registration deadlines. Seven out of 10 are \nPakistanis, with the rest Arabs. Normally, the group handles about 30 cases a month.\n\nThe surge of asylum seekers coincided with the start in December of a new registration program for men over the \nage of 15 who were in the United States on visitor, student or business visas. Within days, it became clear to \nforeigners that anyone registering who had overstayed a visa would be immediately put into deportation \nproceedings.\n\nAlthough the registration law, dating to 1996, applies to all foreign visitors, the Department of Justice has put it into \neffect only for men from 25 countries, all but one of them Arab or Muslim nations. Of the 32,000 men who have \nregistered so far at immigration offices around the country, according to officials, more than 3,000 face \ndeportation.\n\nThe choices for illegal Muslim immigrants, then, were stark. If they had been in the United States for more than \none year, they no longer had the right to apply for asylum here. So they could have ignored the registration and \nrisked deportation, registered and faced deportation or gone back to Pakistan. Or they could try for asylum in \nCanada by claiming they would face political persecution if forced to return home. \n\n\n\nThey are not only overwhelming service agencies, but have also proved an embarrassment for the Pakistani \ngovernment, which has been criticized at home for not demanding better treatment for its expatriates in exchange \nfor its cooperation with the United States on fighting terrorism.\n\nAfter the Pakistani foreign minister protested in Washington this month against the registration requirement, the \ndeadline for Pakistanis was extended to March 21 from Feb. 21. The change also affected men from Saudi Arabia, \nwho faced the same deadline. \n\nBut the extension is unlikely to stem the tide of people to the Canadian border, which has always registered shifts in \nimmigration policy on either side with surges of people seeking asylum in Canada.\n\nThe widely held perception is that Canada treats applicants with more leniency, although its refugee approval rate \nof 57 percent is not much higher than that of the United States, which approves 54 percent of asylum cases. \nAsylum seekers in the United States are generally placed in detention while their claims are assessed, however, \nwhile those waiting for a decision in Canada are free to work. \n\nStill, the latest tide of Muslim men and their families took authorities on both sides by surprise.\n\nThree weeks ago, Canadian border officials at the crossings from northern New York and Vermont, said they did \nnot have enough workers to handle the numbers of people asking for refugee status. They began giving applicants \nappointments for several weeks later and sending them back to the American side of the border. \n\nIn the past when unable to process people on the spot, Canada asked for assurances from the immigration \nservice that those applicants would not be arrested after returning to the United States to wait for their interviews. \nBut last month, Canadian authorities did not bother. \n\n\"We realized it was useless because whether or not we got assurances, we could not process these people,\" said \nRene Mercier, a spokesman for Citizenship and Immigration Canada. \n\nThe United States, in turn, placed dozens of people in deportation proceedings even if they had documents \nshowing an asylum appointment with Canada. Others, caught on their way to the border at counterterrorism \ncheckpoints set up by the United States Customs Service, were arrested on immigration violations.\n\nThe arrests split families and left many women and children to fend for themselves at isolated border posts in some \nof the coldest weather in years. At least 50 people remain in detention along the border, unable to post bond. \n\nThe immigration service said its agents were simply following procedure. \"Individuals who are illegally in the U.S. \nare processed the same way we would process them if we encountered them any other way,\" said Michael \nGilhooly, a spokesman for the agency.\n\nBut it is a shock for those at the border. \"I am crying, my wife is crying,\" said Samir Sheik, a Pakistani who had \nbeen working as a street vendor in New York City and was arrested at a checkpoint on his way to the Canadian \nborder for having overstayed his visa. \"It's not fair because I am leaving the country.\" \n\nMr. Sheik said that he could not return to Pakistan because he and his wife married against the wishes of both their \nfamilies -- \"a love marriage,\" as he tearfully described it -- and that he feared his wife would be killed by her father. \n\nHis wife, Erim Salim, shuffled silently around the crowded Salvation Army center in Burlington, where they had been \nreunited after she borrowed from friends and neighbors to pay his $5,000 bond. \n\n\"She is sick now, mentally,\" said Mr. Sheik, nodding toward her sadly. \"Millions of people live here and are \noverstays. Why is it only for Pakistanis and Muslim people that they do this?\"\n\nHiraj Zafer, a Pakistani cook from Salt Lake City who was also trying to enter Canada, gave an answer. \"After 9/11, \npeople hate us,\" Mr. Zafer said. \n\n\n\nMr. Sheik said: \"Yes, they hate us. But we love America. We feel free here.\"\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPhoto: Jalil Mirza and his family waiting on Friday to apply for asylum in Canada and leave the United States. \n(Karen Pike for The New York Times)(pg.
