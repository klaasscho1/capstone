{"title": "Safety Stings At Work Sites Will Be Halted", "body": "\nFederal officials told immigrant advocates in a letter made public yesterday that government immigration agents \nwould discontinue using undercover sting operations involving health and safety programs to round up illegal \nimmigrants.\n\n  Such an operation generated a storm of protest in July when federal agents arrested 48 workers at Seymour \nJohnson Air Force Base in North Carolina on illegal immigration charges after the agents tricked the workers into \nattending what was billed as a mandatory training session sponsored by the federal Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration.\n\nWorker advocates and immigrant groups complained that such activity would discourage immigrant workers from \nreporting safety violations or seeking help from safety officials at a time when Hispanics were suffering a \ndisproportionately high rate of injuries and fatalities. \n\n  On March 17, Marcy M. Forman, director of investigations for the Department of Homeland Security's immigration \nand customs enforcement division, known as I.C.E., sent a letter to the United Food and Commercial Workers \nunion, which had protested the ruse, to say federal officials were discontinuing the practice. \n\n  ''This is exactly the action that I.C.E. should have taken,'' said Jackie Nowell, director of occupational safety for \nthe food and commercial workers union. ''Using health and safety as a ruse to catch workers is definitely the wrong \nway to go when immigrant workers are being killed and injured in far greater numbers than other workers.''\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
