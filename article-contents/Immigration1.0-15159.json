{"title": "Two Different Approaches To Illegal Immigrants", "body": "\nIn his Soapbox essay \"... and Citizenship for Latinos\" Jan. 25 , the Rev. Allan B. Ramirez asks for citizenship for \nevery Latino immigrant. \n\nI believe every legal immigrant, no matter what nationality, should be encouraged to become a citizen.\n\n     However illegal immigrants, called undocumented workers by Mr. Ramirez, should not be allowed to have \namnesty or become citizens. These people have knowingly broken the law by entering and staying in this country. \nIllegal immigrants take away thousands of entry-level jobs that could otherwise go to unemployed American \ncitizens. Additionally, allowing illegal immigrants to stay makes those who wait years to immigrate legally to this \ncountry look like fools. \n\n Any country has to be able to control its borders. Allowing illegal immigrants to enter and stay in this country is \nirrational.\n\nRobert F. LaPorta\n\nDix Hills\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
