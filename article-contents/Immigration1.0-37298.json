{"title": "Political Conditions Lebanon", "body": "\nIntroduction\n\nLebanon's political history since independence can be defined largely in terms of its presidents, each of whom \nshaped Lebanon by a personal brand of politics: Sheikh Bishara al-Khoury (1943-1952), Camille Chamoun (1952-\n1958), Fuad Shihab (1958-1964), Charles Helou (1964-1970), Suleiman Franjieh (1970-1976), Elias Sarkis (1976-\n1982), and Amin Gemayel (1982-1988). From the end Amin Gemayel's term in September 1988 until the election of \nRene Moawad in November 1989, Lebanon had no president. This was due to a constitutional crisis over the \nexistence of both an interim government and a de facto government. After Moawad's assassination in 1989, only \ntwo weeks after he was elected, he was replaced with Elias Harawi (1989-1998). Emile Lahoud was elected \npresident in November 1998. Controversy swirled around the successor to Lahoud in 2007 (see below for details).  \nIn 2008, Michel Suleiman became Lebanon's most recent president.  A presidential contest was to be held in 2014 \nbut the deadline passed without a consensus candidate being found (see below for details).  In 2016, a deal was \nfinally brokered, setting the way for  Michel Aoun to become the president.\n\nNote: In Lebanon, the president is elected by the National Assembly for a six-year term  and may not serve \nconsecutive terms.  In accordance with the 1943 National Pact, the president is supposed to be a Maronite \nChristian, the prime minister is to be a Sunni Muslim, and the president of the National Assembly is to be a Shi'a \nMuslim. This means that Lebanon's president is the only non-Muslim head of state in the Arab world amidst a \nsystem of pluralistic religious representation. There is also supposed to be some transfer of powers from the \npresident to the prime minister and cabinet.\n\nThe Early Post-independence Period\n\nThe terms of the first two presidents ended in political turmoil. In 1958, during the last months of President \nChamoun's term and the height of Egyptian Presiden t Nasser's pan-Arabism ideology, an insurrection broke out \nover opposition to Lebanon's close ties to the West. In July of that year, in response to an appeal by the Lebanese \ngovernment and justified by the Eisenhower doctrine of resistance to \"international communism,\" United States \n(U.S.) forces were sent to Lebanon. They were withdrawn in October, after the inauguration of President Shihab \nand a general improvement in the internal and international aspects of the situation.\n\n\nBy the 1970s, yet another crisis emerged, as a consequence of post-World War II restructuring efforts. Specifically, \nthe creation of the state of Israel in 1948 and the 1967 war had displaced the non-Jewish Palestinian people, and \nled to the influx of a stream of Palestinian refugees into Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. By 1964, the Palestine \nLiberation Organization (PLO) had been formed, and it engaged in the training of members in military activities, and \nmobilizing \"fedayeen\" (commando-style martyrs) by 1968. The mass killings of Palestinian civilians and guerrillas in \nthe Jordanian government's \"Black September\" operation in 1970 saw the final expulsion of Palestinian guerrillas \nfrom Jordan. The PLO moved its headquarters to Beirut, and began operating bases out of Lebanon, launching \nattacks out of South Lebanon on Israel.\n\nCivil Conflict\n\nPresident Franjieh's term saw the outbreak of full-scale civil conflict in 1975. Prior to 1975, difficulties had arisen \nover the large number of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and the presence of Palestinian guerrillas, mirroring the \ninternal Lebanese sectarian identity struggles. Frequent clashes involving Israeli forces and the \"fedayeen\" \nendangered civilians in South Lebanon and unsettled the country. Many Christians were especially vocal about \ncontrolling the activities of the \"fedayeen.\" Following minor skirmishes in the late 1960s and early 1970s, serious \nclashes erupted between the \"fedayeen\" and Lebanese government fo rces in May 1973.\n\nExacerbated by the Palestinian problem, the already existing Muslim-Christian political, social and economic \ndifferences grew more intense. The Muslims were dissatisfied with what they considered an inequitable distribution \nof political power and social benefits. The Palestinian problem pitted leftist, pan-Arab, mostly Muslims against right \nwing, Western-oriented, mostly Christians.\n\nIn April 1975, after shots were fired at a church, a busload of Palestinians was ambushed by gunmen in Ain al-\nRamaneh in the Christian sector of Beirut-an incident widely regarded as the spark that touched off the civil war. \nPalestinian militia forces joined the predominantly leftist-Muslim side as the fighting persisted, eventually spreading \nto most parts of the country. Almost 40,000 people were killed in this first phase of what was going to be a 15-year \nlong civil war.\n\nElias Sarkis was elected president in 1976. In October, Arab summit s in Riyadh and Cairo set forth a plan to end \nthe war. The resulting Arab Deterrent Force (ADF), composed largely of Syrian troops, moved in at the Lebanese \ngovernment's invitation to separate the combatants, and most fighting ended soon thereafter.\n\nAs an uneasy quiet settled on Beirut and parts of Lebanon, security conditions in southern Lebanon began \ndeteriorating. A series of clashes occurred in the south in late 1977 and early 1978 between the PLO and Lebanese \nleftists on the one hand, and the pro-Israeli, southern Lebanese militia, eventually known as the South Lebanese \nArmy (SLA), on the other.\n\nAfter a raid on a bus in northern Israel left large numbers of Israeli and Palestinian guerrilla casualties, and whose \npurpose undoubtedly was to cause civilian Israeli casualties, Israel invaded Lebanon in March 1978, occupying \nmost of the area south of the Litani River. The United Nations (U.N.) Security Council passed Resolution 425 calling \nfor with drawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon and creating a United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), \ncharged with maintaining peace. When the Israelis withdrew, they turned over positions inside Lebanon along the \nborder to their Lebanese ally, the SLA, and formed a \"security zone\" under the effective control of Israel and the \nSLA.\n\nIn mid-1978, clashes between the Arab Deterrence Force and the Christian militias erupted. Arab foreign ministers \ncreated the Arab Follow-Up Committee, composed of Lebanon, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, to end fighting \nbetween the Syrians and Christians. After the Saudi ambassador was wounded in an attack in December 1978, the \ncommittee did not meet again formally until June 1981, when it was convened to address security and national \nreconciliation. The committee was unsuccessful in making progress toward a political settlement and was inactive \nfrom November 1981.\n\n\n\nThe 1980s\n\nIsraeli-Palestinian fighting in July 1981 was ended by a cease-fire arranged by the United States. The cease-fire \nwas respected during the next 10 months, but a string of incidents, including PLO rocket attacks on northern Israel, \nled to the June 6, 1982, Israeli ground attack into Lebanon to remove PLO forces. Israeli forces moved quickly \nthrough South Lebanon, encircling west Beirut by mid-June and beginning a three-month siege of Palestinian and \nSyrian forces in the city.\n\nThroughout this period, which saw heavy Israeli air, naval and artillery bombardments of west Beirut, American \nspecial envoy Philip C. Habib worked to arrange a settlement. In August 1982, he was successful in bringing about \nan agreement for the evacuation of Syrian troops and PLO fighters from Beirut. The agreement also provided for \nthe deployment of a three-nation Multinational Force (MNF) during the period of the evacuation, and by late August, \nU.S. Marines, as well as French and Italian units, had arrived in Beirut. When the Palestinian fi ghters had left \nLebanon for Tunis and the Israeli evacuation ended, the MNF departed. The U.S. Marines left on Sept. 10, 1982, \nbut would soon return.\n\nIn spite of the invasion, the Lebanese political process continued to function, and Bashir Gemayel was elected \npresident in August. However, on Sept. 14, 1982, he was assassinated by unidentified gunmen. The next day, on \nSept. 15, Israeli troops entered west Beirut. During the next three days, Lebanese militiamen massacred hundreds \nof Palestinian civilians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in west Beirut, an area under the control of Israeli \nforces. The massacres caused international outcry, and Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon was forced to resign.\n\nBashir Gemayel's brother, Amin, was elected president by a unanimous vote of the parliament. He took office Sept. \n23, 1982. The MNF forces returned to Beirut at the end of September as a symbol of support for the government. \nPresident Gemayel and h is government placed primary emphasis on the withdrawal of Israeli, Syrian and \nPalestinian forces from Lebanon, and in late 1982, Lebanese-Israeli negotiations commenced with U.S. \nparticipation.\n\nIn February 1983, a small British contingent joined the American, French and Italian MNF troops in Beirut. On May \n17 , an accord was signed by the representatives of Lebanon, Israel and the United States, which provided for \nIsraeli withdrawal. Syria declined to discuss the withdrawal of its troops, effectively stalemating further progress.\n\nOpposition to the negotiations, as well as to U.S. support for the Gemayel regime, led to a series of terrorist attacks \nin 1983 and 1984 on U.S. interests. The bombing of the U.S. Embassy in west Beirut on April 18, 1983 left 63 \npeople dead; the bombing of the U.S. and French MNF headquarters in Beirut on Oct. 23, 1983 left 298 people \ndead; and the bombing of the U.S. Embassy annex in east Beirut on Sept. 20, 1984 left eight people dead.\n\nThe general security situation in Beirut had remained calm through late 1982 and the first half of 1983. A move by \nChristian militiamen into the Druze-controlled Chouf area southeast of Beirut following the Israeli invasion, however, \nled to a series of Druze-Christian clashes of escalating intensity beginning in October 1982.\n\nWhen Israeli forces unilaterally withdrew from the Chouf at the beginning of September 1983, a full-scale battle \nerupted between the Druze, backed by Syria, and the Christian Lebanese forces supported by the Lebanese army. \nAmerican and Saudi efforts led to a cease-fire on Sept. 26. This left the Druze in control of most of the Chouf. \nCasualties were estimated to be in the thousands.\n\nThe virtual collapse of the Lebanese army in February 1984, following the defection of many of its Muslim and \nDruze units to opposition militias, was a major blow to the government. As it became clear that the depa rture of the \nU.S. Marines was imminent, the Gemayel government came under increasing pressure from Syria and its Muslim \nLebanese allies to abandon the May 17 accord. The Lebanese government announced on March 5, 1984, that it \nwas canceling its unimplemented agreement with Israel. The U.S. Marines left the Lebanon for the second time \nlater that month.\n\n\n\nFurther national reconciliation talks at Lausanne in Switzerland, under Syrian auspices, failed. A new \"government \nof national unity\" under Prime Minister Rashid Karami was declared in April 1984, but made no significant progress \ntoward solving Lebanon's internal political crises or its growing economic difficulties.\n\nThe situation intensified with the deterioration of internal security. The opening rounds of the savage \"camps war\" in \nMay 1985, a war that flared up twice in 1986, pitted the Palestinians living in refugee camps in Beirut, Tyre, and \nSidon against the Shiite Amal militia, which was concerned w ith resurgent Palestinian military strength in Lebanon. \nEager for a solution in late 1985, Syria began to negotiate a \"tripartite accord\" on political reform among the \nleaders of various Lebanese factions, including the Lebanese forces.\n\nGemayel nonetheless opposed the accord, and his hard-line anti-Syrian rival, Samir Geagea overthrew the leader \nof the Lebanese forces in January 1986. Syria responded by inducing the Muslim government ministers to cease \ndealing with Gemayel in any capacity, effectively paralyzing the government. In 1987, the Lebanese economy \nworsened, and the currency began a precipitous slide. On June 1, Prime Minister Rashid Karami was assassinated, \nfurther compounding the political paralysis. Salim al-Huss was appointed acting prime minister.\n\nAs the end of President Gemayel's term of office neared, the different Lebanese factions could not agree on a \nsuccessor. Consequently, when his term expired on Sept. 23, 1988, Gemayel appoi nted Army Commander Gen. \nMichel Aoun as interim prime minister. Gemayel's acting prime minister, Salim al-Huss, also continued to act as the \nde facto prime minister.\n\nAs a result, Lebanon was placed in a constitutional crisis with two governments claiming legitimacy-an essentially \nMuslim government in west Beirut, and an essentially Christian government in east Beirut. The working levels of \nmany ministries, however, remained intact and were not immediately affected by the split at the ministerial level.\n\nIn February 1989, Gen. Aoun attempted to close illegal ports run by the Lebanese forces. This led to several days \nof intense fighting in east Beirut, and an uneasy truce between Aoun's army units and the Lebanese forces. In \nMarch, an attempt by Aoun to close illegal militia ports in predominantly Muslim parts of the country led to a six-\nmonth period of shelling of east Beirut by Muslim and Syrian forces, and the shelling of west Beirut and the Chouf \nby the Christian units of the army and the Lebanese forces. This barrage caused nearly 1,000 deaths, several \nthousand injuries, and further destruction to Lebanon's economic infrastructure.\n\nIn January 1989, the Arab League appointed a six-member committee on Lebanon, led by the Kuwaiti foreign \nminister. At the Casablanca Arab Summit in May, the Arab League empowered a higher committee on Lebanon, \ncomposed of Saudi King Fahd, Algerian President Bendjedid, and Moroccan King Hassan, to work toward a \nsolution in Lebanon. The committee issued a report in July 1989, stating that its efforts had reached a \"dead end\" \nand blamed Syrian intransigence for the blockage.\n\nAfter further discussions, the committee arranged for a cease-fire in September, followed by a meeting of Lebanese \nparliamentarians in Taif, Saudi Arabia. After a month of intense discussions, the parliamentarians informally agreed \non a charter of national reconciliation, also known as the Taif Agreement.\n\nThe parliamentarians returned to Lebanon in November, where they approved the Taif Agreement and elected \nRene Moawad, a Maronite deputy from Zghorta in North Lebanon, president on Nov. 5. Gen. Aoun, claiming \npowers as interim prime minister, issued a decree in early November dissolving the parliament, and did not accept \neither the ratification of the Taif Agreement or the election of President Moawad.\n\nPresident Moawad was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1989, by a bomb that exploded as his motorcade was returning \nfrom Lebanese Independence Day ceremonies. The parliament met on Nov. 24 in the Bekaa' Valley and elected \nElias Harawi, a Maronite Christian deputy from Zahleh in the Bekaa Valley, to replace him. President Harawi named \na prime minister, Salim al-Huss, and a cabinet on Nov. 25. Despite widespread international recognition of Harawi \nand his government, Gen. Aoun refused to recognize Harawi 's legitimacy, even when he was officially replaced by \nthe new president as army commander in early December.\n\n\n\nThe 1990s\n\nIn late January 1990, Gen. Aoun's forces attacked positions of the Lebanese forces in east Beirut in an apparent \nattempt to remove the Lebanese forces as a political force in the Christian enclave. In the heavy fighting that \nensued in and around east Beirut, over 900 people died and over 3,000 were wounded.\n\nIn August 1990, the National Assembly approved, and President Harawi signed into law, constitutional amendments \nembodying the political reform aspects of the Taif Agreement. These amendments gave some presidential powers \nto the Council of Ministers, expanded the National Assembly from 99 to 108 seats, and divided those seats equally \nbetween Christians and Muslims.\n\nIn October 1990, a joint Lebanese-Syrian military operation forced Gen. Aoun to capitulate and take refuge in the \nFrench Embassy. On Dec. 24, 1990, Omar Karami was appointed prime minister. Gen. Aou n remained in the \nFrench Embassy until Aug. 27, 1991 when a \"special pardon\" was issued, allowing him to leave Lebanon safely and \ntake up residence in France in exile. The Syrian air bombardment on east Beirut on Oct. 13, effectively ended the \nLebanese civil war. The war had left some 150,000 dead, 300,000 wounded and 500,000 people displaced.\n\nConsiderable advancement in efforts to reassert state control over Lebanese territory took place in 1991 and 1992. \nMilitias, with the significant exception of Hezbollah, were dissolved in May 1991, and the armed forces moved \nagainst armed Palestinian elements in Sidon in July 1991. In May 1992 the remaining Western hostages taken \nduring the mid-1980s by Islamic extremists were released.\n\nIn October 1991, under the sponsorship of the United States and the Soviet Union, the Middle East peace talks \nwere convened in Madrid, Spain. This was the first time that Israel and its Arab neighbors had direct bilateral \nnegotiations on the Middle East conflict. Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and representatives of the Palestinians concluded \nround 11 of the negotiations in September 1993.\n\nA social and political crisis, fueled by economic instability and the collapse of the Lebanese pound, led to Prime \nMinister Omar Karami's resignation May 6, 1992. He was replaced by former Prime Minister Rashid al-Sulh, who \nwas widely viewed as a caretaker to oversee Lebanon's first parliamentary elections in 20 years.\n\nThe elections were not prepared and carried out in a manner to ensure the broadest national consensus. Elements \nof the 1992 electoral law, which paved the way for elections, represented a departure from stipulations of the Taif \nAgreement, expanding the number of parliamentary seats from 108 to 128, and employing a temporary districting \narrangement designed to favor certain sects and political interests.\n\nThe turnout of eligible voters in some Christian areas was extremely low, with many voters not participating in the \nelections because they objected to voting in the presence of non-Lebanese forces. There also were widespread \nreports of irregularities. The electoral rolls were themselves in many instances unreliable because of the destruction \nof records and the use of forged identification papers. As a consequence, the results did not reflect the full spectrum \nof Lebanese politics and did not help the process of national reconciliation.\n\nFollowing the election of the National Assembly, according to the Taif Agreement, the Syrian and Lebanese \ngovernments had agreed that by September 1992 Syrian troops would be withdrawn from the Bekaa region. That \ndate passed and it became clear that no such compliance would take place until a comprehensive peace treaty \nbetween Israel and Lebanon had been completed.\n\nIn early November 1992, Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri formed a new cabinet, retaining the finance portfo lio for \nhimself. The formation of the Hariri government, with the inclusion of a number of technocrats, was widely seen as \na sign that the government would seriously grapple with reconstructing the Lebanese state and reviving the \neconomy.\n\nIn June 1995, a constitutional amendment was passed that allowed President Harawi another term in office, which \nwould otherwise have expired in October of that year. In 1996, the Hariri government was renewed in the next set of \n\n\n\nparliamentary elections. The elections did not produce a parliament much different from the previous one. Syrian \nmeddling was obvious, election fraud and irregularities were many. Many Christians continued the call for \nboycotting the elections as long as there were foreign forces on Lebanese soil.\n\nSince the beginning of the Middle East peace talks at Madrid, Spain in 1991, Lebanon has participated in the \nprocess. An escalation in fighting between Hezbollah and Israel-supported, took place from late 1992 into early \n1993. Such conflicts continued well into 1994. Lebanon and other Arab nations withdrew from the peace talks once \nagain in 1994 following the murder of a group of Muslim worshippers in Hebron, by an Israeli extremist. Another \nescalation in fighting between Hezbollah and Israeli forces took place, as a consequence of the incident. Hezbollah \nceased its attacks later that year when United States (U.S.) President Clinton visited the region, but resumed \nactivity after his departure.\n\nIntensive Israeli air attacks on Lebanon occurred in 1993, 1994 and 1996, in response to Hezbollah operating from \npositions within Lebanon. Israeli authorities warned Lebanese authorities that civilians would be endangered by the \nattacks on Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, and some 400,000 Lebanese were displaced as a result. \nOperation \"Grapes of Wrath\" in April 1996, saw air attacks directed at a village north of Beirut (where Hezbollah had \nnever operated from) as well as the infamous attack on a U.N. post in the village of Qana which sheltered civilians. \nThe Israeli attack killed 106 Lebanese civilians, and it became crucial to find an immediate diplomatic solution.\n\nOn April 27, 1996, a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah took effect, and as a result of the \ndevastating consequence of Operation Grapes of Wrath, the two parties agreed to avoid civilian targets. An \ninternational committee monitored it in July, and the larger Middle Eastern peace process continued. In the wake of \nthe cease-fire, in 1998, Emile Lahoud replaced Harawi as the president. The former general, who had successfully \nrebuilt the army, was approved by the Syrians and entrusted with the presidency. Personal differences between \nLahoud and Hariri led to the naming of Salim al-Hoss as prime minister-his fourth term.\n\nPresident Lahoud emphasized the battle against corruption and economic reform in inaugural speech. However, \ndue to Sy ria's and its supporters' role in Lebanese politics, Lahoud has been unable or unwilling to clean up the \nsystem. This is particularly illustrated by the fact that Lahoud chose to include Michel al-Murr as minister of interior \nin his government. Murr has been known as Syria's strong man in the Lebanese regime, and is a feared and corrupt \nman.\n\nFrom 2000-2004\n\nIsraeli attacks on South Lebanon continued almost on a daily basis in 1998, 1999 and 2000. On two occasions, in \nJune 1999 and in February 2000, Israeli planes bombed Lebanese infrastructure causing substantial damages to \nroads and power stations. Several people were killed in both instances. Also, the Israeli army and the South \nLebanese Army (SLA) suffered heavy losses in the beginning of 2000.\n\nThe election of Ehud Barak and his promise to withdraw Israeli soldiers from South Lebanon within a year led to the \nanticipation of the departure of Israeli soldiers in July 2000. However, intensified Hezbollah attacks a nd the killing \nof several Israeli soldiers -- in addition to the low morale and the desertion of SLA soldiers -- led to a hasty end of \nthe Israeli occupation on May 25, 2000. The SLA once numbered 2,500 fighters. Some 2,200 of them surrendered \nto Lebanese authorities or were captured after Israel withdrew, while the rest, mostly ranking SLA officers and their \nfamilies fled to Israel. A Lebanese military court has sentenced more than 1,000 people to jail terms of up to 15 \nyears since the trials of alleged collaborators began on June 5, 2000. The military court's verdicts cannot be \nappealed.\n\nCivilians flooded the roads and villages of the liberated zone that had been occupied for 22 years in the days \nfollowing the withdrawal. Peace and order was not restored immediately, and it was not until June 18 that the U.N. \nSecurity Council confirmed the Israeli withdrawal. More than a month went by before U.N. peacekeepers could \ndeploy in the area on July 28.\n\n\n\nDu ring the summer of 2000, the Lebanese army was still in the process of returning to and restoring law and order \nin the area. South Lebanon remained relatively quiet and stable since the Israeli withdrawal, but low-level tensions \nexisted on almost a daily basis. The new border stations became points of attractions, where Lebanese came to \nthrow stones and bottles on Israeli soldiers, and tourist to experience the absurd closeness of the conflict-now being \nwithin an arm's reach of Israeli soldiers.\n\nThe death of Hafez al-Assad in Syria and the coming to power of his son, the self-proclaimed reformer and \nmodernizer, Bashar al-Assad, had, in addition to the opposition's sweeping victory, given rise to the hopes of \nchanges in Syrian-Lebanese relations. The election campaign saw, for the first time, calls for the re-evaluation of \nSyrian-Lebanese relations. The return to Lebanon of former President Amin Gemayel, after 12 years of self-\nimposed exile in France, signalled Christi an hopes for a fairer political process in the future.\n\nDespite the liberation of South Lebanon, the Hoss government had been unable to improve the economic situations \nand failed to implement promised economic reforms. In the parliamentary elections on Aug. 27 and Sept. 3, 2000, \ngovernment opposition candidates, and in particular former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and his supporters, won a \nlandslide victory. The elections were less tainted by obvious fraud, but the pre-elections restrictions, such as Syrian \napproval of most candidates, the centrality of money and the need for \"wasta\" (connections) in the campaign, does \nstill disqualify the elections from a free and fair label.\n\nThe new parliament convened on Oct. 17, 2000, and within a few days Rafik Hariri was appointed prime minister. \nThe new government faces enormous economic challenges as Lebanon spends half of its national budget serving \nthe sky rocketing debt-ironically acquired during Hariri's fir st period as prime minister. The new 30-member cabinet \nincludes some of Hariri's former ministers, amongst others the controversial former Finance Minister Fouad Siniora \nwho is under investigation for embezzlement of public funds. Armenian and Maronite groups who complain of lack \nof representation criticized the new cabinet. The fact that all members of the new cabinet were approved by Syria \nand that no politician in vocal opposition to Syria's influence were amongst the ministers appointed, underlined the \ncontinued influence of Syria on domestic Lebanese politics.\n\nWith the death of the older Assad, a psychological barrier seems to have been brought down. The politically \nmarginal, but symbolically important, success of some opposition candidates in the elections has spawned an \nincreasingly vocal and intense opposition to the Syrian presence and domination of Lebanese politics. An \nunprecedented anti-Syrian statement was issued on September 20 by the Council of Ma ronite Bishops, which \ncalled for the redeployment of the Syrian army. Maverick Druze leader, Walid Jumblatt, has on several occasions \nstrongly criticized the Syrian presence. Jumblatt's fierce anti-Syrian comments have earned him new allies among \nChristian opposition politicians and the Maronite clergy, but also a persona non grata is status in Damascus. Not \nsurprisingly, Syrian troops' patrols around Jumblatt's strongholds in the Chouf area have intensified.\n\nIn an attempt to demonstrate Lebanon's commitment to freedom of statement, and simultaneously testing former \nGen. Aoun's willingness to observe the \"red lines\" of public discourse, Murr TV (MTV) was allowed to broadcast a \nlive interview with Aoun on Feb. 12, 2001. However, those who believed that Aoun would tone down his criticism of \nSyria, in order to \"earn\" his right to return to Lebanon were wrong. Aoun continued his fierce criticism of Syria, and \neven said that Lebanese President Emile Lahoud had been appoi nted by Syria. However, threats that charges \nwould be filed against both Aoun and MTV were dropped when MTV officially denounced the views presented by \nAoun, and after Prime Minister Hariri returned from France in mid-February, arguing that such charges would \ndamage Lebanon's relation with France and the West. Despite the government's displeasure with criticism of Syria, \nformer President Amin Gemayel, only recently returned to Lebanon from exile, launched a fierce tirade against \nSyrian occupation of Lebanon in a lecture in late February 2001.\n\nIn early August 2002, Murr TV was in the headlines again -- accused of slandering the country's president and its \nsecurity services, as well as damaging the country's ties with Syria, which is the major political force in \nLebanon.The charges followed similar accusations against Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation International, the \nmost popular Christian-owned channel, earlier in the week.\n\n\n\nMany Christians oppose Syria's continued influence in Lebanon, where it maintained 20,000 troops. Against this \nbackdrop, the Lebanese and Syrian regimes' fear of the growing overt opposition to Syria's role in Lebanon \nincreased. On March 14, 2001, several thousand students demonstrated on the 12th anniversary for the launching \nof Aoun's \"War of Liberation\" against Syria. Lebanese security forces virtually sealed off the capital in a bid to \ncontain demonstrations, and more than 35 demonstrators were detained. However, a demonstration against the \nAoun demonstration a week later dispersed some security personnel around the capital.\n\nLebanon's human rights violations record was still bleak with scores of people continuing to be arrested on political \ngrounds, including students arrested after demonstrations. Dozens of people accused of \"collaborating\" with Israel \nreceived trials, which fell short of international fair trial standards. There were also reports of torture and ill \ntreatment. Lebanon 's press enjoys relatively more freedom than other Middle Eastern countries, but influential \nindividuals and politicians often own media organizations although statements of overt, anti-Syrian opinions are \nseldom tolerated, and the media practices self-censorship. In December 2000, around 50 Lebanese citizens were \nreleased from Syrian prisons, and handed over to Lebanese authorities. Syria claimed that its held no Lebanese \nprisoners, but this  was disputed by several international human rights organizations.\n\nIn January 2002, former Lebanese Christian militia leader, Elie Hobeika, a key figure in the massacres of \nPalestinian refugees in 1982, died in a blast shortly after disclosing that he held videotapes and documents \nchallenging the Israeli version of the story of the massacres. Hobeika, 46, was linked to the 1982 massacres at \nSabra and Chatilla refugee camps, where Israeli-allied Lebanese Christian militiamen allegedly killed about 2,000 \nPalestinian refugees. However, just before his death, Hobeika -- who has repeatedly denied any link -- told Belgian \nsenators investigating the massacres he had information which he believed would contradict the Israeli version of \nevents.\n\nThe Hariri government was struggling to renew faith in the Lebanese economy and restructure its government \norganization. However, some steps toward administrative reform were  taken. The government's TV station \"Tele \nLiban\" was closed down on March 1, 2001 -- but later re-opened. Other government services, including the \nelectricity company, are expected to be privatized as a part of the government's efforts to revamp the debt-ridden \nLebanese economy and its surplus-staffed administration. Lebanon's national debt stood at $25 billion in March \n2001, and was expected to rise to more than $30 billion within the year. In February 2001, Lebanon obtained $485 \nmillion in loans and grants from international finance groups such as the World Bank, the European Commission \nand the Mediterranean Development Agency.\n\nNevertheless, with increasing internal dissatisfaction regarding economic and political conditions, a Middle East \npeace process in deadlock, and meager prospects for help from an improved regional situation to boost economic \nand political confidence in the region, Lebanon faced some dire times ahead in 2002.\n\nIn the first part of 2003, international relations dominated the political landscape. Following the war in Iraq, the \nUnited States insisted that Hezbollah fighters on the Lebanese border with Israel be replaced with the government's \nmilitary forces instead. For the most part, the Lebanese position regarding Hezbollah is similar to that of the \nSyrians; the vast majority of Lebanese believe that Hezbollah enacts legitimate resistance against Israeli \noccupation. In the case of Lebanon, however, Hezbollah has been legitimized by the government in Beirut. The An-\nNahar newspaper reported that Lebanese President Emile Lahoud told United States Secretary of State Colin \nPowell that Hezbollah is recognized \"as a legal political party.\" Although there was no verification of this quote by \nthe government of Lebanon, it was certainly true that Lebanese Hezbollah is a political party that holds seats in the \nparliament. President Emile Lahoud was largely unresponsive to the requisition by the United States.\n\nAlso in the first part of 2003, Iranian President Mohammed Khatami traveled to Lebanon for the first official visit by \nan Iranian head of state since the Islamic revolution in 1979. At the airport, Khatami was met by the Lebanese \nPresident Emile Lahoud, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, several Cabinet members, as well as the deputy head of \nHezbollah, Sheik Naim Kassem. Khatami's presence was also greeted with throngs of enthusiastic Shi'a supporters \nin the streets of Beirut. In addition to signing a loan agreement valued at about $50 million, Khatami discuss ed the \nrole of Hezbollah with the Lebanese leadership. Although Hezbollah has operated in Lebanon, its activities have \n\n\n\noften been funded by Iran. Lebanon, Iran, and also Syria, have been pressured by the United States to withdraw \ntheir support of Hezbollah.\n\nIn August 2003, violence returned to the Lebanese landscape when a car bomb exploded in the streets of the \ncapital city of Beirut, killing a member of Hezbollah.  Both the controversial group as well as the Lebanese \ngovernment placed the blame on Israel for the explosion.\n\nSeveral months later in December 2003, Lebanese security forces detained two suspects on the grounds that the \nmen were plotting to attack the embassy of the United States in Beirut.  Roughly around the same period in late \n2003, close to thirty people were sentenced to imprisonment for association with various attacks in Lebanon on \ncommercial enterprises or interests from the United States and the  United Kingdom.\n\nMeanwhile, also in late 2003, the government put forth a strict budget aimed at economic reform and dealing with \nthe country's terribly high debt.  The debates and disagreements about the economy in recent times have not \nhelped the country to deal with the debt challenge, and certainly has not helped the privatization program and \nnecessary cost-cutting measures.  As such, the need for the budget to pass appeared to be of vital interest.  The \nprovisions of the budget, however, allow for very little social program expenditures and also seeks to raise taxes.  \nThe result has been an extended debate within parliament and even street protests over wage freezing in certain \nsectors.\n\nIn early 2004, one of the most significant political decisions made involved the resolution to reinstitute capital \npunishment.  In this regard, in January 2004, three convicted murderers were executed.\n\nBy August 2004, the main political issue involved the declaration by President Lahoud that he wished to continue \nto serve in office after his six-year term ended.  In this regard, the president's office issued a statement noting that \nLahoud had not yet completed his political and administrative reform strategy.  Accordingly, the statement said that \nLahoud was \"ready for the mission\" of continuing his work, if parliament wished to provide him with a mandate.  \nSuch a mandate would entail constitutional changes since at present, Lebanon's constitution prevents consecutive \nterms for presidents.\n\nAlthough neighboring Syria was reportedly enthused about the idea of such a constitutional change, other countries \nsuch as the United States, were not nearly as pleased about the possibility. Moreover, at home in Lebanon, people \nwere generally skeptical about the idea of a constitutional change aimed at extending one person's grip on power.\n\nNevertheless,  a vote in the Lebanese parliament resulted in a provision for the Syrian-favored Lahoud to stay on \nfor three more years.  This step was seen as a virtual agreement to allow Syria to maintain its power in the \nLebanese political scene.\n\nIn  September 2004, four members of Lebanon's parliament planned to resign to protest the passage of this \namendment.  Then, in October 2004, Prime Minister Hariri resigned from  office.  The resignation was the \nculmination of a long standing dispute with President Lahoud over political and economic reforms, although \nspurred in large part by the decision to extend Lahoud's tenure.  Hariri, at the time, had been in political office for \nalmost 15 years and had enjoyed the stature of being a leading political figure in Lebanon since the end of the civil \nwar in 1990.  In the period after his resignation, he became increasingly known as an opposition voice.  In \nparticular, Hariri joined the opposition's calls for a withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon -- a move not favored \nby Syrian-aligned factions.\n\nMeanwhile, in the fall of 2004, the United Nations Security Council narrowly passed a United States-proposed \nresolution demanding the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon.  The resolution also called for full respect \nfor Lebanese sovereignty.  Presumably, the measure  was directed at Syrian forces, which, as discussed \nthroughout,  first entered Lebanon as peacekeepers in the 1970s.  The impetus for the United States-proposed \nresolution was believed to have been associated  with  its shift in policy toward Syria. Whereas Syria was viewed \nfavorably in the 1990s for its support of the Gulf War to liberate Kuwait, it was now viewed negatively due to its \nopposition to the invasion of Iraq, as well as its supposed ties to Palestinian terrorist groups such as Hamas and \nIslamic Jihad.  Earlier in 2004, the United States went so far as to place sanctions on Syria demanding cessation of \n\n\n\nsupport for these groups, which often claim responsibility for attacks on Israeli citizens.  By extension, this stance \nmay have impacted Lebanon.\n\nThe Assassination and the Aftermath\n\nOn Feb. 14, 2005, former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed in what appeared to have been a \npolitical assassination.  A car bomb exploded came just after Hariri had left a political session in parliament and \nhis convoy was around the area of the St. George's Hotel..  The attack left around 10 people dead and several \ninjured.\n\nIncluded in those reported to have been killed were members of his convoy; a former minister, also in his convoy, \nwas reported to have been seriously injured.\n\nAs noted above, Hariri resigned from his political office as prime minister in 2004 over differences with President \nEmile Lahoud.\n\nFor his part, Lahoud is regarded as a favorite of the Syrian government, which ha s been highly influential of \nLebanese politics. In recent times, however, relations between the two countries became more tense.  \nNevertheless, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad condemned Hariri's assassination.  As well, Arab League \nSecretary General Amr Mussa characterized it as an act of terrorism, which was sure to have political \nramifications.\n\nIn the period after Hariri's death, relations between Lebanon and Syria plummeted.  The late prime minister's \nfuneral was itself transformed into a spontaneous rally of Lebanese nationalism mixed with protest against Syrian's \nmilitary presence in Lebanon. Such protests continued in Lebanon after the time of the funeral.  Indeed, Lebanese \nopposition groups scheduled a rally in Beirut on Feb. 28, 2005, to protest the killing of former Prime Minister Rafik \nHariri and to call for a formal investigation into the assassination. Meanwhile, another pro-government rally was \nscheduled to protest the arrival of United States diplomat David Satterfield, who traveled to Beirut to call for the \nwithdrawal of Syrian troops.  In order to prevent political clashes, a ban against such demonstrations was put into \nplace by the government.  Nevertheless, protests and rallies became regular fare during this period.  Indeed, \nemotions ran so high that President Emile Lahoud offered to step down from office.\n\nFor Syria, pressure was exerted by external factions. Notably, very soon after Harare's death, the United States \nentered the fray by calling for Syria's military withdrawal from Lebanon. Of particular significance was the decision \nby the United States to demand the implementation of United Nations Security Resolution 1559, which calls for the \nwithdrawal of \"all remaining foreign forces\" from Lebanon.  By Feb. 21, 2005, the Arab League announced that \nplans were in the works to go forward with the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.  The announcement \nfollowed a meeting between the leadership of the Arab League and Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nIn the backdrop of these developments was the parliamentary debate on Hariri's assassination, during which the \nopposition was expected to call for a vote of non-confidence in the government. Before the vote could be called, on \nFeb. 28, 2005, pro-Syrian Prime Minister Omar Karami and his government resigned.  Ten days after his \nresignation, Karami was asked by the president to form a new government and resume his post as prime minister.  \nKarami had the backing of the majority of parliamentarians and continued on as head of government in somewhat \nof a \"caretaker\" capacity.\n\nBy April 2005, however, Karami again submitted his resignation, which was accepted by President Lahoud.  On \nApril 14, 2005, Karami said that the reason for his resignation was the inability to form a cabinet.  After \nconsultations with other politicians, many with competing interests, demands and agendas, Karami said that the \nprocess had reached a dead end.  President Lahoud said he would begin new consultations with the parliament for \nthe purpose of naming a new prime minister.  Complicating matters was the fact that parliamentary elections were \n\n\n\nscheduled for May 2005.  Nevertheless, Nagib Mikati was eventually named as the prime minister-designate.  He \nsoon formed a government and was able to command some popular support despite his perceived ties to Syria.\n\nIn another development, it was announced in late April 2005 that Saad Hariri, son of  the late Rafik Hariri, would \ntake on the task of continuing his father's work.  A statement was issued noting that the young Hariri would assume \nthe \"historical responsibility and leadership\" required to pursue the goals of  independence and national unity.  \nWhile Saad Hariri had already assumed the role of administering his late father's business interests, it was not \nknown precisely how his political commitments might be met.  For example, it was not made clear whether Saad \nHariri would be a candidate in parliamentary elections to be held in May 2005.\n\nMeanwhile, in March 2005, after weeks of intensifying pressure, Syrian President Basha al-Assad announced the \nredeployment of Syrian troops in Lebanon.  The pull-back was scheduled to begin first with redeployment to the \neastern Bekaa Valley, and then to the Syrian border, as part of a phased withdrawal. Talks making official the \ndetails of the withdrawal were to commence between the Syrian and Lebanese leadership. President Bashar al-\nAssad said that following the redeployment, Lebanon and Syria \"will have fulfilled our obligations under the Taif \naccord and under [United Nations Security Council] Resolution 1559.\"  Even though United States authorities said \nthat the redeployment did not go far enough, Lebanese and Syrian groups eschewed intervention by the \nAmericans. These events followed a mass protest in Beirut in regard to the killing of former Prime Minister Rafik \nHariri.\n\nThen, in early April 2005, United Nations envoy Terje Roed-Larsen announced that Syria would  withdraw all its \ntroops from Lebanon by the end of that very month .  The announcement came after a meeting with Syrian \nPresident Bashar al-Assad and Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara. The date was viewed as something of a surprise \nbecause it indicated a rapid pace for the full withdrawal of Syrian troops, military assets and intelligence apparatus.  \nNevertheless, the scheduled withdrawal was intended to meet the requirement of the 1989 Taif agreement, which \nset the course for the end of the 1975-90 Lebanese civil war.  It was also intended to fulfill the requirements set \nforth in United Nations Security Resolution 1559.\n\nEditor's Note: The 1989 Taif accord, which ended the Lebanese civil war, specified a phased withdrawal, while the \n2004 United Nations resolution called for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon and the disarming of \nmilitant groups.\n\nAs these developments were unfolding in the spring of 2005, Lebanon was in a state of political turmoil. A spate of \nbombings, mostly in Christian areas where anti-Syrian sentiment had been high, only exacerbated the grim \nsituation.  Indeed, the violence sparked anxieties about the return of sectarian violence in a country which suffered \nfrequent car bombings during its civil war from 1975 to 1990. While Lebanon's political opposition lashed out at \nSyria for the attacks, leaders in Damascus denied any involvement and pointed to their plan to withdraw their troops \nfrom Lebanon.  Meanwhile, Lebanon's pro-Syrian President Emile Lahoud called on political parties to participate \nin \"crisis talks.\"\n\nElections of 2005\n\nBy early May 2005, attention was turned to the upcoming parliamentary elections scheduled to begin later that \nmonth in the capital city of Beirut.\n\nIn late May 2005, an opposition bloc claimed victory over all the seats in the capital city of Beirut amidst Lebanon's \nparliamentary elections.  The anti-Syrian opposition in Beirut has been led by Saad Hariri, the son of former Prime \nMinister, Rafik Hariri, who was assassinated months earlier. But even before voting had commenced, nine out of \nthe 12 Beirut seats had gone unchallenged to the \"Martyr Rafik Hariri list.\"\n\nThe Beirut vote preceded voting in other parts of the country, which was scheduled to take place over the course of \nweeks during June 2005.\n\nIn the south of the country, the two main Shi'a groups, Hezbollah and Amal, formed an alliance under the \nResistance, Liberation and Development list. As expected, they were the victors in the southern part of the country \n\n\n\nwhen voting took place a week later in early June 2005. Early results suggested that Hezbollah and its ally, Amal, \nwon all 23 seats in that area bordering Israel.\n\nWithin Maronite Christian enclaves, Michel Aoun led his own election list.  During the following phase of elections in \nthe second week of June 2005, the anti-Syrian opposition appeared to have suffered something of a defeat in the \ncentral area of Mount Lebanon. Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, who was able to hold on to this own seat, admitted \nthat Aoun's pro-Syrian Christian hardliners had defeated his own more moderate compatriots. Although Aoun, who \nhad once functioned as prime minister in the late 1980s led a campaign to expel Syrian troops from Lebanon in \nyears gone past, in more recent times, he had aligned with pro-Syrian candidates from the Druze community.\n\nElections also took place in the Bekaa Valley, in the eastern part of the country. There, another strong contest \nensued between pro- and anti-Syrian candidates. Then, in the fourth and final round of Lebanon 's phased \nparliamentary  elections, the main opposition anti-Syrian alliance appeared to have won victory in the northern part \nof the country.\n\nThis meant that  after the successive phases of the parliamentary elections, the opposition alliance leader, led by \nSaad Hariri \u2013 the son of the assassinated former prime minister, would hold a majority in parliament.  The vote also \nsymbolized the desire among the Lebanese people for change.  Still, the Shi'a factions of Hezbollah and Amal, who \nwon prior in the south of the county, would also hold a significant number of seats in the parliament.  As such, they \nwould likely to continue to be an influential contributor to the political process.\n\nAs the election transpired, voting took place to choose 128 members of parliament, with seats allocated to equal \nnumbers of Christians and Muslims. Within the two religious groupings, seats were also allocated to various sects, \nsuch as Druze, Greek Orthodox, Shi'a and Sunnis. In accordance with the 1943 National Pact, the president is \nsupposed to be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister is to be a Sunni Muslim, and the president of the National \nAssembly is to be a Shi'a Muslim. This means that Lebanon's president is the only non-Muslim head of state in the \nArab world amidst a system of pluralistic religious representation.\n\nIn the wake of elections, an ally of assassinated former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was designated to be the new \nhead of government. Fouad Siniora (sometimes spelled Fuad Siniora), a former Finance Minister, was nominated \nby the son of Rafik Hariri, who led the anti-Syrian political bloc to victory.  Siniora was also backed by an \noverwhelming majority of legislators.\n\nHariri's bloc held 36 seats in the 128-seat parliament.  Still, with its allies, such as Druze leader Walid Jumblatt and \nChristian leader Michael Aoun, the Hariri bloc actually controlled 72 parliamentary votes. Yet despite this level of \npolitical influence, even as Lebanese legislators voted in favor of Siniora, they also re-elected the strongly pro-\nSyrian Nabih Berri as the Speaker of the House for a fourth term.  The election of Berri demonstrated that even in \nthe aftermath of the Syrian military withdrawal, Syrian influence continued to prevail on the Lebanese political \nlandscape.\n\nNote: The popular uprising that occurred after Hariri's death, which largely contributed to an election victory for  \nmodern, anti-Syrian, pro-Western factions in parliament, ultimately placing the Siniora government in power and \nspurring the exit of Syrian forces from Lebanon, has come to be known as the \"Cedar Revolution\" of Lebanon.\n\nViolence, Unrest and Investigations\n\nIn late September 2005, a television new anchor for the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation (LBC), May Chidiac, \nwas terribly wounded by a bomb explosion in her car, just  north of the capital city of Beirut.  Reports stated that the \nbomb had been planted under the driver's seat of her Range Rover vehicle and it exploded when she turned on the \ncar's ignition. She was raced to the hospital and was in critical condition after her arm and leg were amputated. \nLBC, a Christian television station, was regarded as  one of the main anti-Syrian media outlets in Lebanon.  Since \nthe assassination of  former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri earlier in 2005, a number of anti-Syrian figures have been \ntargeted.\n\n\n\nIn October 2005, Syria's Interior Minister Ghazi Kanaan committed suicide.  His death came a month after he was \nquestioned by a United Nations  investigator about the murder of former Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri. Hours \nbefore apparently taking his own life, Kanaan, who had functioned as Syria's top security chief in Lebanon for \nseveral years, said in an interview that he had served Lebanon with honesty. This statement, in conjunction with the \ntiming of his death following questioning by the United Nations, led to suspicions about how Kanaan would be \nrepresented in the United Nations report, which was to be published at the end of the month. Some suggested that \nSyria's intelligence community was likely to be implicated, but  how Kanaan's suicide  was linked with this outcome \nremained  unknown.\n\nThe United Nations report on the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri alleged the \ninvolvement of Syria's ruling Assad family, as well as key Lebanese associates.  In concluding section of paragraph \n123, the report stated in strong terms that the decision to assassinate Rafik Hariri could not have been reached \nwithout approval from the very top of the Syrian security apparatus. The report also noted that Hariri's murder could \nnot have been organized without \"the collusion of their counterparts in the Lebanese security services.\"  The report \nsuggested that the motive for Hariri's murder was rooted in the belief that he was an enemy of Syria and its \nLebanese allies. The document did not, however, foreclose a more complex constellation of rationales, including \ncorruption and fraud.\n\nOne individual named in the report was Sheikh Ahmed Abdel-Al who seemingly telephoned Lebanese President \nEmile Lahoud only moments after the bomb exploded killing, Hariri and several others.  Lahoud, significantly, had \nbeen at odds with Hariri and had enjoyed a strong alliance with Syria. The timing of the call, thus, was deemed to \nbe highly suspicious.\n\nIts revelation  appeared to fuel further calls for Lahoud's resignation from office. The report also named one of \nLahoud's closest security advisors -- General Mustapha Hamdan, the commander of Lebanon's presidential guard -\n- as a witness.  The report alleged that four months prior to the assassination, he claimed that Hariri was \"pro-\nIsraeli\" and said, \"We are going to send him on a trip; bye bye Hariri.\"\n\nAs well, paragraph 96 of the report discussed testimony of a witness who claimed to have worked for Syrian \nintelligence.  In that testimony, a series of apparent (but unconfirmed)  meetings in Damascus between Lebanese \nand Syrian security officials were described, including plans for Hariri's assassination. The brother-in-law o f Syrian \nPresident Bashar al-Assad, Asef Shawkat, who led Syria's military intelligence, as well as Maher al-Assad, the \npresident's own brother, were reportedly mentioned in the report as well, although their actual names were \nredacted. More broadly, the report criticized Syrian authorities of failing to cooperate with the investigation.\n\nAn investigator for the United Nations, Detlev Mehlis, warned that the report evoked further investigatory work, and \ncautioned that those named should enjoy the presumption of innocence.  Nevertheless, he did not back away from \nthe overall charges of conspiracy to commit murder, which appeared to involve key Syrian and Lebanese officials. \nThe report has been sent to the United Nations Security Council for discussion.  Before the commencement of \nthose discussions, the United States had already demanded action against Syria. Throughout, Syrian President \nBashar al-Assad said that there was no evidence to suggest that Syria was involved in  Hariri's death.\n\nA bomb exploded in Lebanon in December 2005 killing Gibran Tunei, a prominent anti-Syrian parliamentarian and \nmanaging editor of a well-known newspaper.  Tunei's death came only days after his return from Paris, where he \nhad been residing due to fears of attempts on his life. \n\nThe murder of Tunei, who had been a vocal critic of Syria's occupation of Lebanon, was the latest in a series of \nmore than a dozen political assassinations over the course of 2005.  The attacks led Prime Minister  Fouad Siniora \nto state that he would call for an United Nations Security Council investigation into the killings, which have been \nallegedly linked with Syria.  For its part, Syria said the specific killing of Tunei may have been timed in order to \ndamage its standing just ahead of meetings scheduled with the United Nations.  Whether or not Syrian involvement \ncould be ascertained, it was certainly true that with each political assassination of an anti-Syrian voice  in Lebanon, \n\n\n\nthe fires of political conflict have been sparked. Indeed, well-known Lebanese politician and leader of the country's \nDruze community, Walid Jumblatt, accused Syria of being behind Tunei's assassination.\n\nIn late 2005, a Syrian-born suspect was arrested in connection with the killing of Tunei. The suspect, Abdul Qadir, \nallegedly  made  telephone calls immediately before and after the bombing that killed Tunei, and apparently rented \na plot of land located near the place where the attack took place.\n\nLahoud's Future\n\nIn the the first part of 2006, Lebanon's political sphere was dominated by the debate over the political career of \nLebanon's pro-Syrian president.  Politicians in Lebanon were ensconced in a new round of discussions about the \ncountry's political future, including the question of whether or not  President Emile Lahoud should be dismissed \nfrom office.  Several rounds of discussions have been ongoing ever since an anti-Syrian majority took power in the \nlast elections, however, there has been little consensus on the fate of Lahoud. \n\nAlthough many of the political players in Lebanon shared the view that Lahoud should not remain in the country's \ntop post, there was little agreement about who should replace him.  Other issues on the table for debate included \nthe procedure for the disarmament of Hezbollah's militia, as set forth in United Nations Security Council Resolution \n1559. \n\nSpecial Extended Coverage Report:  Israeli-Hezbollah Conflict in Lebanon \n\nPrelude\n\nOn  May 28, 2006,  the United Nations (U.N.) announced that it brokered a truce following incidences involving \nmutual missile attacks along the Israel-Lebanon border. In one of the most significant attacks since December \n2005, Katyusha rockets from Lebanon were fired across the border toward northern Israeli bases around Mount \nMiron. While no specific militant group claimed responsibility, it the past, such attacks have been carried out by the \nlikes of Hezbollah as well as Lebanon-based Palestinian militants.  In retaliation, Israeli jets fired on guerilla bases \nin Lebanon.  Clashes between guerillas and Israeli troops then ensued along the boundary between Israel and \nLebanon and residents in the area were instructed to take cover. The area has been a particularly volatile zone \ndespite the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon in 2000, following an occupation that lasted close to \ntwo decades.  Still, there has remained a contested territory in the border region called the Shebaa Farms, which \nremains the site of periodic confrontations.\n\nBackground and Primer\n\nIn mid-July 2006, the leader of Lebanon-based Hezbollah announced that his militant Islamic group had captured \ntwo Israeli soldiers.  The Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, asserted that the soldiers would only be returned \nthrough a combination of dialogue and prisoner exchange.  He added that the operation had been planned in \nadvance of the capture of another Israeli soldier by Palestinian militants in Gaza. Underscoring his militant stance, \nthe head of Hezbollah also said that if Israel wanted to escalate the crisis, his group would be ready to deal with a \npossible confrontation.\n\nThe Israeli government held urgent cabinet meetings regarding the situation and approved a strong military \noffensive in Lebanon -- in response to Hezbollah's actions and also for the purpose of finding the two captured \nsoldiers.  Israel warned that it would hold Lebanon responsible for the fates of the two captured soldiers, pointing to \nthe fact that Hezbollah had been allowed to attack Israel from within Lebanese borders with impunity and \nirrespective of the parameters of international law.  Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert characterized the actions of \nLebanon-based Hezbollah as an \"act of war.\" The Israeli leader's promise of \"painful\" and \"far-reaching\" \nconsequences was issued just as its forces launched a military assault on southern Lebanon.\n\n\n\nThe military assault left several Israeli troops and civilians dead, even as roads as well as Hezbollah interests were \nattacked within Lebanon.  Indeed, as the conflict raged on, parts of the Lebanese capital of Beirut were decimated -\n- particularly southern suburban areas known to be Hezbollah strongholds.  The country's main infrastructure, \nincluding major highways, were bombed in order to prevent Hezbollah from receiving arms and support - allegedly \nfrom Iran via Syria.  The human dimension was not to be ignored as hundreds of civilians were killed in Lebanon as \na result of Israel's military actions.  On the other side of the border in Israel, the death toll and injury list, albeit in \nnotably lower numbers, continued to rise  as a consequence of a relentless barrage of rocket attacks by Hezbollah.  \nIndeed, rocket attacks became systematically more pronounced over time -- traveling further distances and more \ndeeply into Israeli territory and with greater frequency.\n\nThe two main players in the drama unfolding in the Middle East had their own perspectives as well.  With no sign \nthat the conflict was easing, the government of Lebanon called for a ceasefire with Israel and also requested \nassistance from the United Nations. Lebanon was desperate for an end to the violence as its terrain bore the brunt \nof the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.  As a result, the Lebanese people, a first outraged at Hezbollah for \nplacing them in an untenable position, had now turned their anger toward Israel.  Meanwhile, Israel maintained the \nview that its two soldiers had to be returned and Hezbollah rocket attacks against Israel had to be stopped.  To \nthese ends, Israel was willing to take radical actions to achieve a long-term solution.\n\nOn the international scene, leaders laid primary blame for the situation at the feet of Hezbollah. They echoed \nIsrael's demand for the release of the two abducted soldiers and a cessation of rocket attacks on Israel, which had \nleft scores of people dead and hundreds injured. Nevertheless, they also demanded that Israel cease its military \noperation, which had destroyed several Hezbollah interests at a terrible cost.  They pointed to the devastation of  \nthe city of Beirut, as well as hundreds of civilian Lebanese lives and thousands of injuries, which were taken as \ncollateral damage.  The deaths of the United Nations peacekeepers as well as the deaths at Qana were particularly \nbleak examples of the high cost of Israel's operation.  Israeli Prime Minister Olmert asserted that his country was \ncognizant of the humanitarian aspect of the situation regarding Lebanon's civilians.  In fact, his Lebanese \ncounterpart, Fuad Siniora, said on United States television that it was something the two of them had discussed.  \nThat said, Olmert maintained the position that Israel was compelled to defend itself against terrorism.\n\nDiplomatic efforts were underway to try to bring an end to the violence.  Attempts to draft a United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolution on the matter were marred somewhat by different policy imperatives of various countries. \nLebanon's failure to enforce a previous United Nations Security Council Resolution (1559), which was intended to \ndisarm militias from attacking Israel from within its borders, was a key concern. Indeed, it led to discussions about \nthe creation of a new international force, which would be tasked with ensuring that security was maintained in the \nborder region.  Israel's heavy-handed military operation was also a source of great concern with many critics \nwondering whether it would not result in increased animosity in the Middle East, rather than regional peace and \nstability. Iran and Syria became increasingly implicated in the conflict as backers of Hezbollah, while the United \nStates' support for Israel and its refusal to call for an immediate ceasefire became the source of global debate.\n\nOn August 11, 2006, United Nations Security Resolution 1701 called for an end to the hostilities and provided for \nthe stablishment of more robust United Nations enforcement in the border region.  By August 14, 2006, the \nceasefire was officially in effect.  A few days later, Lebanese troops crossed the Litani River to take up positions on \nthe southern border with Israel.  Their presence, however, was viewed as more of a symbolic development than a \nstrategic one since it remained unknown how they would control the region that had become a Hezbollah \nstronghold over a period of decades.  The fragile ceasefire was holding despite occasional flare-ups of violence. \nStill, the United Nation was warning that the ceasefire was at risk of collapsing in the aftermath of a raid by Israelis \nin the Bekaa Valley due to apparent attempts by Hezbollah to rearm itself. In the last days of August 2006, there \nwere also rising accusations about the violations of humanitarian law during the conflict.\n\nMeanwhile, displaced Lebanese people were returning home.  As well, the United Nations said that it was hoping to \nestablish 3,500 troops in southern Lebanon within two weeks and up to 15,000 in a month.  There was also a call \nfor European countries to contribute troops since Israel objected to the presence of peacekeepers from countries \nthat do not recognize its right of existence.  In addition to the orchestration and deployment of the United Nations \n\n\n\npeacekeeping mission on the Lebanese-Israeli border, there were also efforts underway to raise funds to be used to \nreconstruct Lebanon's destroyed infrastructure.\n\nIn the backdrop of these developments both Israel and Hezbollah made competing claims of victory.  However, by \nthe close of August 2006, Hezbollah's leader expressed regret that his orders to capture two Israeli soldiers had \nsparked a war that had left more than 1,000 people dead and which had decimated southern Lebanon.\n\nEditor's Notes: \n\nHezbollah (Hizbollah) --\n\nHezbollah (also known as Hizbollah) is a militant movement founded with the assistance of Iran's late revolutionary \nleader, Ayatollah Khomeini.  Although it is accused of being a terrorist organization by the West, it is regarded as a \nlegitimate resistance movement by many Arabs and Muslims. The group endeavors to restructure Lebanon as an \nIslamic state and has called for the destruction of the state of Israel.  Functionally, it has had control of the border \nregion between Israel and Lebanon since the withdrawal of Israeli forces in 2000.  Like the militant group, Hamas, \nin the Palestinian territories, Hezbollah also has a political wing, which has won representation in government.  \nIndeed, there is a Hezbollah representative serving as a government minister in Lebanon.\n\nThe following countries made pledges toward the peacekeeping mission along the Lebanese-Israeli border --\n\nFrance: Leadership and 2,000 troops\n\nItaly: 2,500-3,000 troops; also offered to take on leadership of the mission\n\nBangladesh: Two battalions (up to 2,000 troops)\n\nMalaysia: One battalion\n\nSpain: One  battalion\n\nIndonesia: One battalion, an engineering company\n\nNepal: One battalion\n\nDenmark: At least two ships\n\nPoland: 500 troops\n\nFinland: 250 troops\n\nBelgium: 302 troops to be increased to 392\n\nGermany: Maritime and border patrols but no combat troops\n\nNorway: 100 soldiers\n\nIntroduction to Day-to-Day Coverage: Positions in the Conflict\n\nThe initial assault left several Israeli troops and civilians dead, even as roads as well as Hezbollah interests were \nattacked within Lebanon. Israel was now dealing with crises on two fronts.  First, it was carrying out an operation in \nthe Gaza Strip to rescue Corporal Galid Shalit, who had been captured by Palestinian militants.  As a result, there \nwas an ongoing conflict between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants taking place in Gaza.  A second operation \ninto Lebanon was now being launched to rescue Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev -- the two soldiers captured by \nLebanon-based Hezbollah.  Nevertheless, despite the overwhelming task of fighting on two fronts, Prime Minister \nOlmert ruled out any negotiations with Hezbollah, just as it had foreclosed the discussions with Hamas.  \nAdditionally, his government filed a complaint with the United Nations, calling on the Security Council to enforce an \nexisting resolution [1559] that required the Lebanese government to disarm militias.\n\nFor its part, Lebanon said it had no knowledge of Hezbollah's activities and would not take responsibility for the \nabduction  of the two Israeli soldiers.  To this end, Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora said, \"The government \n\n\n\nwas not aware of and does not take responsibility for, nor endorses what happened on the international border.\"  \nExperts on the ground in Lebanon also pointed to the fact that despite the existence of United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolution 1559, the country simply was not in the position -- politically or militarily -- to disarm Hezbollah \non its own.\n\nJuly 13, 2006\n\nOn July 13, 2006, the situation intensified after Israeli forces bombed the Beirut international airport and later a \nmain Lebanese army base in the Bekaa Valley. As well, Israeli warships blocked Lebanese ports. An assault on \ntargets across southern Lebanon at that time left approximately 50 people -- most of whom were civilians -- dead.  \nThere were also reports of several Israeli casualties as a result of attacks by Hezbollah in the northern part of Israel.\n\nWith a war-like scenario unfolding, both Israelis and Lebanese on their respective sides of the border were fleeing \nto safety. Tourists in the region also joined the exodus, with many trying to cross the northern border into Syria.  \nSpecial emergency flights were being planned to pick up stranded tourists trying to escape the escalating violence.\n\nLebanon's Social Affairs Minister, Naila Mouawad, called for the two Israeli soldiers to be returned home.  She also \nreiterated Lebanon's previously-noted position that her government was neither aware of Hezbollah's plan, nor \nsupported it.  That said, Mouawad criticized Israel's response for being too heavy-handed, particularly with regard \nto the lives of Lebanese civilians.  She warned that Lebanon was experiencing a catastrophe and explained that her \ngovernment could not disarm Hezbollah by force.\n\nIn the late hours of July 13, 2006, at least two rockets hit Haifa.  Hezbollah quickly denied firing them.  \nNevertheless, the timing of the attacks -- only hours after the group had threatened to carry out this very act -- did \nlittle to assuage suspicions that Hezbollah was responsible.\n\nThat said, it should be noted that although Hezbollah fired several rockets into Israel over the course of the previous \ndays, none had traveled more than 12 miles  (approximately 20 kilometers).  As such, there was some skepticism \nthat Haifa could be hit at all.  Regardless, the distance traversed by the rockets suggested that since Israel's \nwithdrawal from Lebanon, Hezbollah had been busy accumulating more sophisticated weaponry.  Left unsaid at the \ntime was the matter of who would have furnished more technologically-advanced rockets to Hezbollah. For its part, \nIsrael reacted to the rocket attacks on Haifa by characterizing it as a major escalation.\n\nGlobal Reaction\n\nWith no sign that the conflict was easing, the government of Lebanon called for a cease-fire with Israel and also \nrequested assistance from the United Nations.  To this end, the United  Nations Security Council was set to meet \non July 14, 2006 to discuss the crisis unfolding in the Middle East. The European Union said that it would deploy its \nhead of foreign policy, Javier Solana, to the region to try to assist in bringing an end to the violence. The Arab \nLeague was also reported to have scheduled an emergency session.\n\nMeanwhile, there was a growing state of anxiety across the globe, with many countries calling for restraint from all \nparties involved. United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan condemned both the abduction of the Israeli soldiers \nas well as the resulting offensive by Israeli forces into Lebanon. Russian, France and the European Union \nexpressed the view that Israel's response to the capture of two soldiers was disproportionate. But Israeli \nspokesman, Mark Regev, said that Israel was simply responding to an \"unprovoked act of aggression.\"  United \nStates President George W. Bush characterized Hezbollah as terrorists and supported Israel's right to defend  \nitself.  However, he also warned that whatever action Israel took, it should be mindful of the stability of the \nLebanese government. Margaret Beckett, the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, took a similar position \nsaying that while Israel had to ensure its own security, it should do so in a way that avoided civilian deaths.  The \nVatican later added its condemnation of the situation - calling for the release of the soldiers by Hezbollah and \ndecrying  Israel's strikes against the sovereignty of Lebanon.\n\nConditions on the Ground\n\n\n\nAmidst these varied calls for restraint, the crisis intensified further. Along the Israeli-Lebanese border, heavy fighting \ntook a toll.  Reports suggested that Israel had endured its worst losses in the area in several  years.  Hezbollah fired \nrockets in the direction of northern Israel and threatened to attack Israel's port city of Haifa if any attacks on Beirut \ntook place.\n\nAs noted above, Israel did, indeed, bomb the airport in Beirut earlier in the day and further strikes on the city \nfollowed.\n\nJuly 14, 2006\n\nBy the early hours of July 14, 2006, reports emerged that Israeli forces were carrying out a new round of attacks \non Hezbollah targets inside Lebanon.  Among the targets were various Hezbollah interests in the southern part of \nBeirut --buildings believed to house Hezbollah weapons caches and offices of Hezbollah's leader (Sheik Hassan \nNasrallah).\n\nOther strategic targets, such as a power plant and the main highway between Beirut and Damascus (Syria), were \nalso hit by Israeli strikes.  Several spokespersons said that in addition to trying to free their two captured soldiers \n(as noted above), Israeli forces were also endeavoring to stop Hezbollah's flow of weaponry between Lebanon and \nSyria, which have been used to carry out terrorist attacks against Israel.  Earlier, Israel had warned Lebanon that  \nthe suburbs of the country's capital city should be evacuated -- presumably a foreshadowing of what was to follow.\n\nLater on July 14, 2006, Israeli forces struck bridges, Hezbollah's media and security headquarters, and the Beirut \noffices of Hassan Nasrallah.  The Hezbollah leader was not hurt in the attack.  In an address broadcast after the \nstriking of his offices, Nasrallah declared \"open war\" on Israel.  Meanwhile, Hezbollah continued to systematically \nlaunch rocket attacks into northern Israel.  The violence left several people dead on both sides of the Israel-\nLebanon border.\n\nOn that day, the United Nations Security Council met to discuss the crisis, which was taking on the characteristics \nof warfare.  Lebanon's ambassador to the United Nations, Nouhad Mahmoud, called for an end to Israel's operation \nin Lebanon saying, \"The Security Council meets today in the shadow of a widespread, barbaric aggression waged \nby Israel to this very moment against my nation, Lebanon.\" But Israeli Ambassador Dan Gillerman responded by \nsaying that his country had no choice but to respond to Hezbollah's actions.  He also noted that the Lebanese \npeople were the ones suffering because of their government's ineffectiveness in disarming Hezbollah, as set forth in \nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 1559.  United States Ambassador John Bolton called for disarmament \nsaying, \"All militias in Lebanon, including Hezbollah, must disarm and disband immediately, and the Lebanese \ngovernment must extend and exercise its sole and exclusive control over all Lebanese territory.\"\n\nJuly 15, 2006\n\nBy July 15, 2006, the level of violence was escalating.  In one attack by Hezbollah, an Israeli warship off the \nLebanese coast was hit by an Iranian-made missile. Three Israeli sailors were reported missing while Israeli media \nsaid that the body of a fourth sailor had been found. The leader of Hezbollah had earlier alluded to such an attack in \nhis aforementioned address threatening \"open war\" on Israel. Then, Israeli air strikes on southern Lebanon resulted \nin the deaths of several Lebanese civilians who were attempting to flee the region.\n\nIsraeli strikes on targets across Lebanon, stretching as far north toward the border with Syria, were ongoing. Beirut \ncontinued to bear the brunt of the Israeli offensive with the city's port, gas stations, key roads and Hezbollah \ninterests being struck.  Meanwhile, Hezbollah continued its systematic pounding of northern Israel with rocket \nattacks.  The town of Tiberius was among those hit in Israel. There were reports of casualties on the ground.\n\nLebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora repeatedly emphasized his country's call  for a cease-fire, calling on the \nUnited Nations to administer such a move.  In response, the United Nations said it would send a peace delegation \nto the region to assess the situation.  For his part, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said he would concur with a \n\n\n\ncease-fire so long as certain conditions were met.  He said that Hezbollah had to release the two abducted soldier \nand cease rocket attacks at northern Israel, while Lebanon had to comply with  the existing United Nations Security \nCouncil resolution [1559].  Israel also accused  Syria  and Iran of conspiring with Hezbollah and the Palestinian \ngroup, Hamas, against the Jewish state. In this regard, Israel particularly drew attention to the Iranian-made \nmissiles, which allegedly hit its warship, as noted above.  Iran, however, denied supplying Hezbollah with the \nmissiles. Earlier, in a telephone conversation with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Iranian President Mahmoud \nAhmadinejad reportedly warned of a strong response to any Israeli military offensive against Syria.\n\nJuly 16, 2006\n\nOn July 16, 2006, an attack by Hezbollah on Haifa killed several Israelis. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert warned \nthat the attack on Haifa -- the country's third largest city --  would yield grave consequences. Indeed, the resulting \nretaliation came in the form of  intensified Israeli  air raids across Lebanon, including the northern part of that \ncountry.  About seven Lebanese soldiers at a military post at Abdeh were killed  in the strikes.  The city of Tripoli \nwas also among the areas struck by Israeli forces. Israeli air strikes ongoing in southern Lebanon also left a \nnumber of  people dead.  An attack on Tyre and a border village left several more people dead, including some \nholding Canadian citizenship. Strikes against strategic interests, such as fuel tanks at the Beirut airport, also \ncontinued. Meanwhile, Hezbollah's rockets were traveling more deeply into northern Israel, as exemplified by \nattacks on the town Afula, located close to Nazareth.  In this way, the death toll was also mounting on the Israeli \nside of the Lebanese-Israeli border.  Nazrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, promised that the battle against Israel had \nonly just begun.\n\nJuly 17, 2006\n\nA day later on July 17, 2006, Israeli strikes resulted in the deaths of about 10 Lebanese as they crossed a bridge; \nseveral others died in strikes elsewhere in Lebanon as the death toll in that country rose. There were some reports \nthat Israeli forces crossed the border into southern Lebanon, however, this activity was not regarded as a large-\nscale operation. In Israel, the continuous series of rocket attacks by Hezbollah resulted in Israeli casualties.  Also, \nHezbollah said that it had brought down an Israeli F-16 fighter jet over Beirut, however, that claim was dismissed by \nIsraeli authorities who said all their jets were accounted for.\n\nWithin the Israeli parliament, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert made it clear that strikes on Lebanon would continue \nunless the two abducted soldiers were released, Hezbollah was disarmed and Lebanon showed that it was taking \ncontrol over its own southern border with Israel.  Olmert said, \"When missiles are launched at our residents and our \ntowns, our answer will be war waged at full strength, with all determination, courage and sacrifice.\"\n\nHe also noted that Israel was not looking for war or direct conflict, but it would deal with that reality if necessary. \nThe Israeli government continued to assert that militant groups, such as Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Hamas in \nGaza and the West Bank, were functioning in tandem with accused state sponsors of terrorism, Iran and Syria.  \nThose two countries were referred to as \"an axis of terror.\"\n\nAlso on July 17, 2006, French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin traveled to Beirut as a measure of French \nsolidarity with the people of Lebanon and to try to advance a ceasefire agreement. As the French head of \ngovernment was arriving in Lebanon, the foreign policy head of the European Union, Javier Solana, was returning  \nfrom his trip to that country and warned that a ceasefire might not be quickly reached.  Likewise, United Nations \nSpecial Envoy Vijay Nambiar said that although he had made some initial progress during ceasefire talks in Beirut, \nmuch was yet to be done.  Nambiar also noted that it was imperative that Lebanon be more involved in the \nceasefire process.  Clearly, Hezbollah's unilateral actions against Israel served to essentially marginalize the \nLebanese government.  The government was also faced with the reality that conflicting ideas about where to place \nblame served only to create dissonance within the military -- a condition that could spark factionalism or another \ncivil war.\n\nJuly 18, 2006\n\n\n\nThe following day, Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora again blamed Hezbollah for sparking the conflict and \nrepeated his call for the release of the Israeli soldiers.  At the same time, he condemned Israel for its harsh military \nresponse.  Indeed, he reportedly said in an interview with British media that Israel had opened \"the gates of hell and \nmadness\" on Lebanon.\n\nLebanon's  pro-Syrian President Emile Lahoud took a somewhat different view as he promised to stand by \nHezbollah's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.  The different stances of Siniora and Lahoud laid bare the brewing  \npolitical discord within Lebanon.\n\nJuly 18, 2006 was also the day a delegation from the United Nations, led by Vijay Nambiar,  was set to meet with \nIsraeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni to discuss the terms of a possible ceasefire.  At that meeting, Livni asserted that \nthere could be no ceasefire until its conditions (delineated above) were met.  Israel also hinted that its offensive in \nLebanon could last for another week in order to ensure that it had destroyed as much of Hezbollah's arsenal of \nweaponry as possible.  A day later on Arabic television, Hassan Nasrallah made it clear that the Israeli soldiers \ncaptured by Hezbollah would only be released if there was a prisoner exchange with Israel.  The respective \npositions of Israel and Hezbollah made the notion of a resolution appear rather elusive.\n\nThe casualty list on July 18, 2006 included the deaths of 11 Lebanese soldiers as a result of Israeli strikes.  One \nIsraeli was killed in Nahariya as a consequence of Hezbollah rocket attacks.  Across northern Israel, a barrage of \nHezbollah rockets hit  cities and towns such as Haifa, Safed, Acre, Kiryat Shemona, and the Gush Halav region.\n\nJuly 18, 2006 also marked the day in which the United States Senate passed a non-binding resolution of support for \nIsrael.\n\nJuly 19, 2006\n\nThe next day saw little change from the previous ones.  Indeed,  July 19, 2006 appeared to have been a day of \neven greater bloodshed and violence in Lebanon and Israel respectively. Israeli air strikes targeted eastern and \nsouthern Lebanon and left over 50 people dead.  In one case, around a dozen people died in one village.  \nMeanwhile, Israel lost some of its soldiers in heavy clashes with militants from Hezbollah on the ground, just inside \nthe border of Lebanon.  The Israeli forces were attempting to locate and destroy weapons and facilities used for \nterrorist attacks.  A spokesperson for the Israeli government, Miri Eisin, told both British and American media that \nher country would not allow a terrorist organization to deploy along its  border. In the city of Nazareth in northern \nIsrael, three people died as a result of rocket attacks by Hezbollah.\n\nJuly 20, 2006\n\nOn July 20, 2006, United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, called for an immediate ceasefire, blaming \nHezbollah for sparking the conflict and Israel for using excessive retaliatory force.  The United Nations chief also \nindicated that because of the destruction of Lebanon's infrastructure, a humanitarian crisis was evolving.  Indeed, \nseveral sources noted that there were now hundreds of thousands of displaced people across the country. Annan \nnoted that the crisis could only be dealt with via urgent funding and the European  Union - which had also called for \nan end to the violence - pledged to contribute financially  to the cause.  Recognizing that a ceasefire would be \ndifficult to achieve but that the humanitarian crisis had to be addressed nonetheless, the French government put \nforth a proposal for the establishment of safe corridors in Lebanon by which aid could be transported. In response, \nthe Israeli government agreed to the proposal of a humanitarian corridor between Lebanon and Cyprus.\n\nIt was also announced that the Secretary General would hold a private meeting with  the European Union's Foreign \nPolicy Chief, Javier Solana, as well as United States Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice.  For her part, Rice later \ncharacterized the notion of an immediate  ceasefire as \"a false promise.\"\n\nThe casualty list on July 20, 2006 included the deaths of two Arab Israeli children in Nazareth as a result of \nHezbollah rockets.  The Hezbollah leader expressed regret for their deaths.  As well, four  Israeli soldiers died in \n\n\n\nclashes with Hezbollah fighters on the border.  Israeli forces also lost two of its Apache helicopters when they \ncollided near the Lebanese border.  One officer died and three others were injured in that incident.\n\nJuly 20, 2006 also marked the day in which the United States House of Representatives passed a non-binding \nresolution expressing solidarity with Israel.\n\nJuly 21, 2006\n\nOn July 21, 2006, the situation took a turn for the worse when thousands of Israeli reservists were called up for duty \nin anticipation of a possible land incursion. Although it appeared that Israeli troops were already  in Lebanon fighting \nagainst Hezbollah, they had been  operating on a small-scale level.  The call for reservists augured the possibility of \na larger-scale operation.  Another ominous warning came in the form of a directive from the Israeli government that \ncivilians exit southern Lebanon as quickly as possible, presumably in order to escape imminent peril.\n\nIsrael's Defense Minister, Amir Peretz, said that although Israel had no intention of conquering Lebanon, his country \nwas prepared to do whatever was necessary.  The president of Lebanon, Emile Lahoud, warned that the Lebanese \narmy would battle Israel if it invaded Lebanon.  Syria, through its Information Ministry, warned that it would enter the \nconflict if Israel carried out a ground invasion of Lebanon that threatened its own security.\n\nThe fighting between Israel and Hezbollah continued across the border.  Israeli strikes further degraded \nthoroughfares and infrastructure in Lebanon while Hezbollah rockets rained on northern Israel, hitting the city of \nHaifa once again.\n\nThere were at least 15 casualties. A Hezbollah rocket attack hit Masarik and left three people injured. Other \nincidences were reported, including the striking of a United Nations observation post, however, no injuries occurred \nin that case. Israel also announced that it had bombed a Hezbollah bunker and destroyed much of that group's \nstock of missiles.  It was a claim that Hezbollah disputed.\n\nJuly 22, 2006\n\nOn July 22, 2006, fighting between Israeli forces and Hezbollah resulted in serious injury to an unarmed United \nNations observer.  The incident happened in the town of Maroun al-Ras, which according to some reports, had \nbeen the site of a major clash between the two sides.  Some reports concluded that the fight at Maroun al-Ras \nresulted with Israel taking control of the town.\n\nThe Evacuation Process and Humanitarian Relief\n\nMeanwhile, with the conflict ongoing, roads across Lebanon were filled with people attempting to flee the aerial \nbombardment but unsure of where exactly to go.  Foreign nationals were being evacuated as governments of \nWestern countries sent ships and aircrafts to rescue people stranded on the conflict-ridden terrain of Lebanon.  \nSome governments began considering the need for special operations to rescue foreign nationals trapped in cut-off \nparts of Lebanon.  In particular, the French Defense Minister Michele Alliot-Marie said that France would launch a \nspecial mission to rescue some of its citizens trapped in southern Lebanon.\n\nThe evacuation process was winding down by the close of July 2006, although a Canadian ferry was set to \nevacuate foreign nationals trapped in the southern part of Lebanon from the city of Tyre. At the same time, \nhumanitarian efforts were underway with lorries of food and medical supplies arriving at key points in the conflict, \nsuch as Beirut and Tyre.\n\nAs the last week of July 2006 began, the evacuation of foreign nationals began to be the source of great \nconsternation among local Lebanese who accused the international community of caring only about people carrying \ncertain passports, while failing to act on behalf of local civilians who were bearing the brunt of the violence.\n\nJuly 23, 2006\n\n\n\nBy July 23, 2006, the head of the emergency relief agency for the United Nations, Jan Egeland, characterized the \ndamage caused by Israeli strikes on Beirut as \"horrific.\" He decried the devastation caused by Israel's retaliatory \naction against Hezbollah, calling it  excessive, while at the same time condemning Hezbollah for cloaking itself \namong the civilian population, thus worsening their casualties. He called on both sides to cease their attacks and \nnoted that humanitarian aid would begin arriving shortly in Lebanon. In that latter regard, he appealed for safe \naccess.  As noted above, Israel had earlier said that it would lift its blockade on the port of Beirut and respect a \nhumanitarian corridor.  He also said that the United Nations would be launching an appeal for humanitarian aid \namounting to $150 million dollars (USD).\n\nEgeland arrived in Beirut on the heels of an Israeli strike against the Hezbollah-dominated portion of Lebanon's \ncapital city. In Beirut, there were four injuries when one strike hit a mosque. While Hezbollah said the facility was \nused only for prayer, Israel contended that it was one of several legitimate targets used not only for conventional \npurposes, but also by Hezbollah for its activities.\n\nOn that same day [July 23, 2006], Israel's aerial bombing of southern and eastern Lebanon continued in the early \nhours of Sunday. In the east, Israeli strikes caused engineers, who had been attempting  to repair impassable \nroads, to retreat for safety reasons. The southern town of Sidon, where several people had fled seeking safety, was \nhit by Israeli strikes.  As well, the city of Tyre was the site of action from both sides.  It was one of several places \nfrom which some Hezbollah militants were firing missiles and, as such, Israel made it a target of retaliatory strikes. \nThere were eight deaths reported across  Lebanon.  They included a young boy, a photographer, three people \nfleeing in a minibus, as well as three Hezbollah fighters.  On the other side of the border, two Israelis died in Haifa \nand over twenty  people were injured as a result of repeated Hezbollah rocket attacks.\n\nIn other developments, Kim Howells, a Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the United \nKingdom,  was scheduled to meet with the Israeli Foreign Affairs Minister, Tzipi Livni.  Howells issued a rebuke of \nIsrael for essentially attacking the Lebanese nation in its effort to fight Hezbollah. However, he also expressed \nunderstanding of Israel's imperative to defend itself and condemned Hezbollah for exacerbating the conflict by \nhiding weapons in civilian-dominated areas.\n\nFor its part, the United States appeared reticent about getting actively involved since the start of the crisis. \nNevertheless, United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was expected to depart for the Middle East on \nJuly 23, 2006. As well, foreign ministers from France and Germany were expected to travel to Israel for peace \ntalks.  Iran, which had been notably silent for some time, entered the mix with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad \nsuggesting that Israel's current conundrum had been self-inflicted.\n\nDiplomacy and Ceasefire Demands\n\nOn July 24, 2006, United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice arrived in the Middle East for talks regarding \nthe crisis. Before arriving in the Middle East, Rice mentioned to reporters that the United States still had an \nembassy in Syria.  Her statement was interpreted by some as a reminder that the United States and Syria still \nshared diplomatic relations that could be leveraged, if necessary.  Her first stop was Lebanon where she met with \nPrime Minister Fuad Siniora. In that meeting, she expressed concern for the Lebanese people, while also making \nclear that Hezbollah's attacks on Israel from within Lebanese territory could not be permitted to continue.  She then \nleft for talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.\n\nThere was no call issued for an immediate ceasefire.  In the backdrop of these developments, the White House \nannounced that it had authorized humanitarian aid to be sent to Lebanon.\n\nSecretary Rice, and later President Bush, both conveyed the view that the only possible solution to the conflict was \na sustainable ceasefire and enduring peace. The United States' stance has been that a ceasefire might result in \nonly Israeli compliance, thus subjecting Israel to future attacks.  Clearly, this view has not been shared by many \nworld leaders and foreign policy chiefs who have called for an immediate ceasefire, arguing that continued \nhostilities were untenable, regardless of optimal long-term objectives. Many Middle Eastern experts have further \nsaid that no long-term objectives can be achieved, at all, without addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n\n\nIntensive talks between Western and Middle Eastern ministers were scheduled to take place on July 26, 2006 in \nRome.  Prior to the meeting, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan said it was crucially important to achieve \nconcrete results aimed at resolving the conflict.\n\nJuly 24, 2006\n\nOn the ground in the conflict zone in the last week of July 2006, Israeli forces moved northward from Maroun al-\nRas, the southern Lebanese town it had earlier taken control of, and were engaging Hezbollah fighters around the \ntown of Bint Jbeil.  In that fighting, ten Israeli soldiers were injured while two Hezbollah fighters were captured.  The \nlevel of operations suggested that Israel was still carrying out only small-scale incursions across the border in \nLebanon. In one case, an Israeli helicopter crashed in northern Israel.  While Hezbollah said it had shot down the \naircraft, Israeli authorities said it crashed as a result of technical difficulties.\n\nThere was a lull in the Israeli strikes on Beirut on July 24, 2006, presumably due to the presence of Rice in the city \non that day.\n\nClashes and blasts elsewhere in Lebanon ensued nonetheless.  In one case,  there were allegations that clearly-\nmarked Red Cross vehicles had been hit by Israeli strikes.  Israeli efforts in Bint Jbeil appeared to have been \nsuccessful because it was later reported that they had taken control of the town and were advancing toward \nYaroun.  As well, Israel subsequently said during its incursions in southern Lebanon, that it had managed to kill Abu \nJaafar, a key Hezbollah commander.  Both Israel and Hezbollah confirmed that several of their troops had been \nkilled in the fighting.\n\nJuly 25, 2006\n\nOn July 25, 2006, the conflict was ongoing with blasts heard on both sides of the border -- from Beirut to Haifa. \nClearly, Israeli strikes on Lebanon's capital had resumed with explosions heard in Hezbollah-controlled areas of the \ncity. Hezbollah's efforts against Israel continued with a constant volley of rockets raining down on northern Israeli.  \nIn one case, a young Arab-Israeli girl was killed in the village of Maghar.  At the same time, Haifa continued to \nendure Hezbollah's ceaseless rocket offensive.  Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, appeared on Lebanese \ntelevision on this day warning that his forces were ready to attack more deeply into Israeli terrain.\n\nThe Deaths of the United Nations Peacekeepers\n\nMeanwhile, several days earlier on July 25, 2006, there were reports  that a United Nations observation post in \nsouthern Lebanon had been hit by Israeli military aircraft.  There were unconfirmed reports that four peacekeepers \nmight have killed. This was later confirmed when it was reported that four unarmed peacekeepers from Austria, \nCanada, China and Finland died when the United Nations post was struck.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary Kofi Annan expressed shock at the \"apparently deliberate targeting of the post,\" \nespecially since he claimed that Israel had assured him of the safety of United Nations personnel.  Israel responded \nby conveying its regret over the matter. Some Israeli spokespersons criticized Annan for \"irresponsibly\" accusing \ntheir country of deliberate action before an investigation could be carried out.\n\nA day later, an initial report into the deaths of the United Nations peacekeepers was released.  The report indicated \nthat despite repeated contacts by the United Nations -- 10 in total -- with Israeli troops regarding the closeness of \nIsraeli strikes in the area, and regardless of promises from the Israelis that the shelling would stop, the United \nNations post was hit by a precision-guided missile following a period of about six hours of constant shelling. \n\nOne diplomat familiar with the report argued that if Israel had actually acted on the basis of the contacts, \"rather \nthan deliberately ignoring them,\"  the peacekeepers would still be alive.  As well, the Irish Foreign Ministry said that \none of its soldiers working for the United Nations warned Israel that its military activities were placing the lives of the \npeacekeepers at risk.\n\n\n\nUnited Nations humanitarian aid chief, Jan Egeland, said on United States television that (1) the post had been a \nknown and clearly-marked structure for decades; (2) the Israeli prime minister had given personal assurances of \nsafety to head of the United Nations; (3) repeated contacts by the United Nations had been made regarding the \ndangerously close range of the shelling; (4) although Hezbollah operated  generally in southern Lebanon, \nHezbollah was not in close proximity of that particular post; and (5) the post had, in the end, been hit by a  missile \nknown for its precision.\n\nFor its part, Israel expressed deep regret regarding the deaths of the four United Nations peacekeepers and Israeli \nPrime Minister Ehud Olmert personally telephoned United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to express his \ncondolences over what had happened.\n\nBoth Israel and the United Nations agreed to pursue a joint investigation into what transpired. At the same time, the \nUnited Nations said that it would meet to deliberate what course of action it should take. After lengthy talks on July \n27, 2006 in which no real consensus could be reached on the wording of a position statement, the United Nations \nSecurity Council released a declaration expressing deep shock and distress over the Israeli air strikes that killed \nfour peacekeepers.  China criticized the statement for being needlessly weak.\n\nA few days after the deaths of the four United Nations peacekeepers, another two peacekeepers were injured as a \nresult of the ongoing violence.  There was rising concern that many countries might be reluctant to contribute to \nfuture peacekeeping efforts, as a result of these incidences.\n\nJuly 26, 2006\n\nOn July 26, 2006 -- crisis talks in Rome ensued and ended with no agreement on the call for an immediate \nceasefire, despite an impassioned plea from Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora.  United States Secretary of \nState Rice was apparently one of few voices arguing against the ceasefire, which gave rise to difficult discussions \namong the parties present.  The Rome summit ended with the release of a declaration expressing \"determination to \nwork immediately to reach with utmost urgency a ceasefire to put an end to the current hostilities.\" The declaration \nalso included a description of a ceasefire as \"lasting, permanent and sustainable.\" The Rome summit did manage \nto advance calls for the creation of an international force that would enforce peace and stability along the Israel-\nLebanon border.\n\nOn the ground in the conflict zone, Israeli troops experienced one of their bloodiest and most challenging days. \nEight soldiers died and around 22 were injured in clashes with Hezbollah; it was the most significant loss of troops \nto Israel since the start of the conflict.  The clashes ensued at  Bint Jbeil -- the very town that Israel said it had taken \ncontrol of a day earlier.  In a separate incident of fighting, a ninth Israeli, this time an officer, was killed.  In the city \ncenter of Tyre in Lebanon, a huge explosion destroyed a multi-storey complex, supposedly regarded as the offices \nof another Hezbollah commander.  On the other side of the border, Hezbollah continued its rocket assault on Israel, \nleaving about 31 people injured.  It was estimated that Hezbollah was firing rockets at a rate of over 100 per day \ninto Israel.\n\nThe Imperative for Stability\n\nThe escalation of hostilities between Israeli forces and Lebanon-based Hezbollah, in conjunction with Israel's \nongoing conflict in Gaza, spurred fears that the entire Middle Eastern region was at risk of being acutely \ndestabilized.\n\nKeeping these anxieties in mind, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and United Kingdom Prime Minister \nTony Blair called for an international force to be deployed to Lebanon.  The force would be tasked with stopping \nHezbollah's attacks on Israel, and in so doing, it would remove Israel's rationale for bombarding Lebanon. Although \na United Nations mission, UNIFIL, has been monitoring the Israeli-Lebanese border since 1978, it numbers less \nthan 2,000 in strength and has few means to enforce peace.  As such, a new stabilization force would have to be \nenshrined with far more power and capabilities.\n\n\n\nAmir Peretz, the Defense Minister of Israel, expressed support for the idea of an international peacekeeping force \nin southern Lebanon on July 23, 2006.  He particularly conveyed his backing for such a force to be led by NATO.  A \nday later, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert confirmed his country's support for this plan, so long as the forces \ndeployed were both robust and enshrined with sufficient power as to be able to carry out their mandate.  The \nEuropean Union's chief of foreign policy, Javier Solana, further affirmed the plan when he stated that several \nEuropean countries would contribute to such a force, which might function under the aegis of the United Nations \nSecurity Council.\n\nIsrael announced that it would maintain control over southern Lebanon until the proposed international force was \nactivated.  In this regards, Amir Peretz, Israel's Defense Minister, explained on July 25, 2006 that his country had \nno alternative saying, \"We have no other option. We have to build a new security strip that will be a cover for our \nforces.\"  It was not clear if Israel intended to hold control over a security zone even after the deployment of the \nproposed international force.\n\nFollowing the Rome summit on July 26, 2006, there had been a call for the creation of an international force, \nworking under a United Nations mandate, and with the mission of fully implementing existing United Nations \nSecurity Council resolutions.  The statement also called  for the disarmament of militias and the deployment of \nLebanese troops on the border.\n\nJuly 27, 2006\n\nOn July 27, 2006, Hezbollah rockets continued to rain on northern Israel.  Targets hit the town of Kiryat Shmona \nand ignited fires.  Rockets also fell on fields close to Safed, Carmiel, Maalot and Shlomi. As well, the terrorist group \nal-Qaida, which has traditionally not worked in sync with Hezbollah, issued a statement suggesting that it would not \nsit on the sidelines as the conflict in southern Lebanon raged on. That same day, Israeli authorities said that while \nthey did not intend to expand their military offensive in Lebanon, they would call up additional troops from their \nreserve divisions to fortify their operations against Hezbollah. Israeli Defense Minister Amir Peretz said that Israel's \nmilitary operation would go on  until a secure border strip could be established, preventing Hezbollah's  return to \ncurrent positions.\n\nHis statement came a day after failed peace talks in Rome in which no agreement could be reached on a ceasefire.\n\nJuly 28, 2006\n\nOn July 28, 2006, United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair and United States President George W. Bush held \ntalks in Washington D.C.  The crisis in the Middle East factored highly during those discussions, which were \nfollowed by a call by the two leaders for \"lasting peace\" in the region. Bush also said that he and his British \ncounterpart both supported the establishment of an international force, which would work with the Lebanese \nmilitary to maintain stability along the Israeli-Lebanese border zone. Despite increasing international pressure for \nthe cessation of hostilities, however, there was no call for an immediate ceasefire from the respective British and \nAmerican leaders.  Meanwhile, the United Nations made its own call for a 72-hour truce aimed at facilitating the \ntransportation of aid and supplies.\n\nOn the ground in the conflict zone, Hezbollah reportedly fired a long-range rocket, the Khaibar-1, in the direction of \nIsrael; it landed just south of Haifa.  It was an apparent attempt to make good on an earlier threat to fire longer \nrange rockets more deeply into Israeli territory.  Another Hezbollah rocket -- this one of unknown origin and packed \nwith explosives -- hit an area around the town of Afula.\n\nSeveral Israelis were injured as a result of these and other rocket attacks on that day.  At the same time, the Israeli \nmilitary was carrying out strikes against targets in Lebanon, leaving at least a dozen people dead.  Israel also \nreported that it had killed a number of Hezbollah fighters in the town of Bint Jbei, which had been the site of serious \nclashes in recent days.  Civilians were again the unfortunate casualties of the hostilities when mortar rounds struck \na convoy of civilian vehicles as they tried to flee  southern Lebanon.  There was no conclusive knowledge about \nwho might be responsible for those injuries. Two members of the German media were also injured during the chaos \n\n\n\nof the day.  Elsewhere in Lebanon,  Israeli strikes left a Jordanian man dead and three people wounded in Kfar \nJoz.  Strikes were also being carried out on the Bekaa Valley in the east and southern villages around Tyre.\n\nJuly 29, 2006\n\nA day later on July 29, 2006, Israeli air strikes in the north of Lebanon resulted in the closure of the border crossing \nbetween Lebanon and Syria.  It was reported that missiles hit the area between the two countries' respective \nimmigration stations.\n\nIsraeli raids on southern Lebanon left several people dead.  There were reports that a mother and her five children \nwere among those killed. Israeli troops were still engaging Hezbollah fighters in Bint Jbeil, however, on  July 29, \n2006, Israeli troops withdrew from  the Hezbollah stronghold.  On the other side of the conflict, Israel continued to \nbe hit by volleys of rockets from Hezbollah. Safed was among the towns affected on July 29, 2006.  Israeli anxiety \nalso increased on this day as Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, promised that towns in the center of Israel could \nwell be targeted.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was in the region for further talks -- this \ntime with a focus on the creation of an international force that would ensure security and stability in the conflict \nzone.  Rice warned that, at this point, negotiations were expected to be very difficult.  Meanwhile, Rice and other \nforeign policy leaders were also trying to craft a United Nations resolution, which would set forth key conditions \nassociated with the  long-term resolution of the crisis.\n\nAlso on July 29, 2006, British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed similar views to those previously-articulated by \nhis American counterpart, saying that there could not be a ceasefire until certain conditions [presumably those that \nwould ensure a long-term solution] were in place.  Jack Straw,  the leader of the British House of Commons and the \nformer Foreign Minister, endeavored to carve out quite a different stance.  Following on the heels of Minister of \nState Kim Howells, who had issued strong sentiments on the matter, Jack Straw criticized Israeli's military operation \nin Lebanon as \"disproportionate.\"  International Development Secretary Hilary Benn also raised concerns about the \nconflict.\n\nCivilian Deaths at Qana\n\nJuly 30, 2006 was likely to be remembered as one of the darkest days in the conflict taking place between Israeli \nforces and Lebanon-based Hezbollah.  An Israeli air raid at Qana left more than 50 civilians dead -- the vast \nmajority of whom were women, children and senior citizens.  They had been seeking shelter from the violence in \nthe basement of a three-story house.  Survivors, as well as relatives of those killed, were reported to have been \nanguished about the bloodshed and confused about why they had been targeted.\n\nIsraeli authorities responded  by saying that they had warned civilians to leave the area.  They also furnished aerial \nfootage, apparently filmed two days earlier, which showed  missiles being fired from the area around Qana, as well \nas what seemed to be a missile launcher surreptitiously hidden in a house there.\n\nDespite this explanation, Lebanon's Prime Minister Fouad Siniora characterized the Israeli strikes in Qana as  \n\"heinous crimes against civilians.\"  For Siniora, along with many Lebanese, it was possible that this incident at \nQana evoked memories of a similar strike that took place a decade ago.  In 1996, Israel launched its \"Grapes of \nWrath\" operation, which was similarly aimed at destroying Hezbollah's base in Lebanon.  A United Nations post was \nhit by Israeli strikes and approximately 100 people, who had come to the post seeking refuge from the violence,  \ndied as a result.  Now, ten years later, a similar scenario had transpired.\n\nFor its part, Hezbollah promised retaliatory attacks.  Hezbollah soon acted upon that ominous promise and fired \nsuccessive waves of rockets into Israel later in the day, some of which hit the Israeli border town of Kiryat \nShemona.  Israelis said that they were experiencing the worst barrage of rocket attacks ever.\n\nRegardless, the deaths at Qana evoked recriminations and condemnations from the international community.  \nUnited Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan called for a vociferous rebuke by the international community and \n\n\n\nreiterated his demand for an immediate ceasefire. After several hours of discussions during an emergency session, \nthe United Nations Security Council issued a statement in which it unanimously expressed \"extreme shock and \ndistress\" over what had happened at Qana and  deplored the loss of life there. The Security Council, however, did \nnot call for an immediate ceasefire, despite Kofi Annan's earlier's appeal for one.\n\nNevertheless, the deaths at Qana appeared to have shifted the position of United Kingdom's leader, Tony Blair, \nsignificantly.  Only a day after he said that certain conditions had to be met before a ceasefire could ensue, Blair on \nJuly 30, 2006 said that some sort of resolution had to be forged \"as soon as possible,\" in order to resolve the \n\"catastrophe\" that befallen Lebanon.  Blair said, \"What has happened at Qana shows that this is a situation that \nsimply cannot continue.\" It was apparent that the events at Qana had spurred a notable change in perspective on \nhis part.  Indeed, Blair issued a joint statement with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, asserting that the tragedy of \nQana emphasized the \"urgency of the need for a ceasefire as soon as possible.\"\n\nOverall, perhaps the most important outcome of the Qana deaths appeared to have been  a renewed sense of \nurgency from among the international community to end the crisis, if only to stop further tragedies of this sort from \noccurring.\n\nJuly 31, 2006\n\nBy July 31, 2006, Israel had agreed to an immediate suspension of air strikes over southern Lebanon for a 48-hour \nperiod, in order to facilitate an investigation into what had transpired. Dan Gillerman, the Israeli ambassador to the \nUnited States, said in an interview with British media that the suspension would allow the inquiry to take place, \nwhile also providing remaining civilians with time to evacuate the area.\n\nThe agreement to cease air strikes temporarily was reached following urgent talks between Israeli officials and the \nUnited States  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.  For its part, however, the United States had not shifted its \nposition and did not join the increasing chorus of calls for an immediate ceasefire.\n\nThat was not to say that the views of all American politicians were unified on the matter.  Despite expressed support \nby the two houses of Congress for Israel on July 18, 2006  and July 20, 2006  respectively, United States Senator \nChuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, broke ranks with his party and the Bush administration to call for an \nimmediate ceasefire.  On July 31, 2006, Hagel declared, \"The sickening slaughter on both sides must end and it \nmust end now. President Bush must call for an immediate ceasefire. This madness must stop.\"\n\nAugust 1, 2006\n\nBy August 1, 2006, the Blair government was experiencing some internal dissonance as a result of differing \napproaches to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah.  Whereas the British Foreign \nOffice indicated its support for an immediate ceasefire, the stance from Downing Street was one that stopped short \nof that particular call.  The Foreign Office was not the only source of dissonance regarding Blair's stance.  As noted \nabove, comments from the Minister of State, the former Foreign Minister and leader of the House of Commons, as \nwell as the International Development Minister, indicated that several members of the Blair's Labour Party was \ndeparting company with the prime minister.  Now, days later,  a number of cabinet ministers were reported to have \ndispatched notes to the British prime minister during a cabinet meeting suggesting that their silence was not to be \ninterpreted as actual consent for Blair's position.\n\nWhile the internal struggle was going on within government of the United Kingdom, British Foreign Minister Beckett \njoined her counterparts within the European Union in the Belgian capital of Brussels to draft a proposal calling for \nan \"immediate cessation of hostilities,\" which would be followed by a sustainable ceasefire. That two-step process \nwould eventually facilitate both a political accord and the deployment of a multinational force to enforce stability in \nthe conflict zone.  The elements of the proposal were somewhat adapted to accommodate the varying perspectives \nof European governments on the conditions of a ceasefire.\n\nIn other diplomatic efforts, French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy was in Beirut and met with his Iranian \ncounterpart, Manouchehr Mottaki.  Taking a different approach than that of the United States, the French diplomat \n\n\n\ncomplimented the Iranian nation and its heritage, presumably paving the way for harmonious discussions aimed at \nresolving the conflict.  The Foreign Minister's objectives were somewhat frustrated by the call from a senior Iranian \ncleric for Muslims to lend support to Hezbollah's fight against Israel.\n\nOn the ground in the conflict zone, Israeli tanks moved into southern Lebanon.  Following a security cabinet \nmeeting,  Israel had indicated that it was going to expand its ground offensive.\n\nHeavy fighting was reported in the southern part of Lebanon in several locations between Israeli troops and \nHezbollah fighters.\n\nIsraeli warplanes struck at targets on the ground, even as Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert claimed that his \ncountry was succeeding in its efforts to nullify Hezbollah.  But at the same time,  Hezbollah was responding with \nfierce resistance. Casualties were reported on both sides as a result of the clashes. In the Lebanese town of \nLweizeh, an Israeli strike was said to have left a mother and her two children dead.  In Ait al-Shaab, where the \nstrongest exchange of fire was reported, an anti-tank missile  killed three Israeli soldiers and injured 25 others.  \nIsrael said that it had killed dozens of Hezbollah fighters there.\n\nHezbollah fighters were also reported to have been killed at Kfar Kila, Adiasse and Taibe, while Bint Jbeil continued \nto be the site of clashes.\n\nOn the other side of the border, Hezbollah fired mortal shells into northern Israel, however, there were no rocket \nattacks.  The last day rockets were fired at Israel was July 31, 2006.\n\nDespite his claim that Israeli forces were winning the military battle against Hezbollah (noted just above), Ehud \nOlmert acknowledged that Israel would not be able to completely destroy Hezbollah's arsenal of weapons.  That \nsaid, he asserted that Israel's objective was to lessen the threat posed by Hezbollah.  Israel's Infrastructure Minister \nsaid that his country's troops would likely require another two weeks to finish this task.  In this regard,  Binyamin \nBen-Eliezer said on Israeli Army Radio that this timeline would be needed  \"to complete the job, and by that I mean \nthat the area in which we want [an] international force to deploy is cleansed of Hezbollah.\"\n\nReports suggested that Israel's operations in Lebanon also involved forcing Hezbollah fighters to retreat as far as \nthe Litani River, located 18 miles (or 30 kilometers) north of the border.\n\nAlso on Aug. 1, 2006, irrespective of previous announcements about a temporary halt on air strikes (made in late \nJuly 2006) and the establishment of a humanitarian corridor (made in the third week of July 2006), two Belgian \naircraft carrying humanitarian aid were prevented from landing in Beirut when Israel warned that it could not \nguarantee safe passage. Nevertheless, a day later, humanitarian efforts were underway with the  World Food \nProgramme saying that they had been given safe passage into Lebanon.\n\nAugust 2, 2006\n\nAfter a lull, Hezbollah resumed its attacks on Israel on Aug. 2, 2006 with intensity.  Indeed, Hezbollah launched \nmore than 220 rockets into Israel from Lebanon.  It was the heaviest barrage of rockets in a single day since the \nstart of the conflict.  Intensity aside, this spate of attacks was also distinguished for the distance traveled.  Indeed, \nthere were reports that the rockets were hitting the targets deeply into Israeli territory.  One person was reported to \nhave been killed in Nahariya while several others were injured.  One rocket hit  Beit Shean on the edge of the West \nBank, while another hit the West Bank itself.\n\nFor his part, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said that Israel was successfully destroying Hezbollah's \ninfrastructure.  He also foreclosed any hope of an immediate ceasefire by asserting that no such action would be \ntaken until an international force was deployed in southern Lebanon.\n\n\n\nHis comments suggested confidence in the operations being carried out by the Israeli military.  Indeed, earlier in the \nday, Israeli troops assaulted a Hezbollah stronghold, Baalbek, located in the north eastern part of Lebanon.  There, \nIsraeli troops raided a hospital that was said to be used by Hezbollah fighters and seized five people.  Israeli \nauthorities claimed that the five individuals were Hezbollah fighters, but Hezbollah disputed the claim and said they \nwere civilians.  Regardless, the fact that Israeli commandos had managed to infiltrate Lebanese territory, even \nreaching a part of the country located close to the border with Syria, served to bolster Israeli claims of mission \nsuccess.\n\nIn southern Lebanon, clashes between Israeli troops and Hezbollah fighters were ongoing.\n\nOn the diplomatic front the United Kingdom's ambassador to the United Nations expressed the view that an initial \nSecurity Council resolution aimed at end the violence was close at hand.\n\nAmidst these developments, Iran's supreme leader echoed the earlier words of  a senior cleric and called on the \nMuslim world to stand with Hezbollah against Israel.\n\nAugust 3, 2006\n\nIsrael continued to carry out its offensive operation into southern Lebanon, destroying  several interests in the \nregion along the way, but taking a toll in the form of the lives of four Israeli soldiers.  Nevertheless, Israeli authorities \nappeared to be planning intensified attacks, as evidenced by the dropping of  leaflets in Beirut  warning residents of \na new military operation against Hezbollah. As well, Defense Minister Amir Peretz was reported to have informed \ntop military commanders that they should prepare to advance northward of the border with Lebanon toward the \nRiver Litani.\n\nOn the other side of the conflict, Hezbollah's rocket attacks on August 3, 2006 resulted in the deaths of at least \neight civilians in northern Israel.  As well, Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, warned that further attacks by \nIsrael would result in the bombing of Tel Aviv.\n\nMeanwhile, diplomats at the United Nations were attempting to craft a resolution that would bring an end to the \nfighting.  Such a result was to be welcomed by humanitarian agencies, which warned that their relief operations \nwere being hampered by the destruction of infrastructure as well as fuel shortages.\n\nAugust 4, 2006\n\nOn August 4, 2006, an Israeli strike left 26 people dead and at least 20 people injured.  Most of the victims were \nSyrian Kurdish farm workers in the village of Qaa, located in the Bekaa Valley along Lebanon's north-eastern \nborder with Syria.  Israeli strikes also hit bridges in Christian areas in northern Beirut, as well as bridges along \nLebanon's coastal highway.  Five people were reported to have been killed when the coastal bridges were \ndecimated.  As well, an Israeli air raid on Taibeh in the southern part of Lebanon resulted in the deaths of seven \npeople and injuries to 10 others.  Meanwhile, Israeli fighters continued to engage Hezbollah fighters in southern \nLebanon, in an attempt to push Hezbollah's forces northward from the border toward the Litani River.\n\nOn the other side of the conflict, Hezbollah fired 190 rockets into Israel, leaving three civilians dead.  The attacks \nevoked fears about Hezbollah's capacities since some rockets landed as many as 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the \nborder.  Indeed, the town of Hadera, just 30 miles (45 kilometers) north of Tel Aviv, was among the areas hit.\n\nIn addition to concerns about the increased range of the rockets being fired by Hezbollah, there was anxiety about \nthe amplified volume of rockets.  In recent days, the number of rocket attacks by Hezbollah had increased \nsubstantially to close to 200 per day -- double the number of attacks that had become the norm in the first few \nweeks of the conflict.  In anticipation of a possible missile attack against Tek Aviv, Israeli authorities urged the city's \nresidents to ensure that they were able to access bomb shelters.\n\n\n\nOn the diplomatic front, United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice suggested that a United Nations \nresolution regarding the conflict could be pass within days.  At issue was the phraseology of a possible ceasefire \nresolution. However, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert signaled that with or without a resolution, Israel's offensive \nwould continue  until an international force was actually deployed in southern Lebanon.\n\nAugust 5, 2006\n\nClashes between Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon continued on Aug. 5, 2006.  Several \ncasualties were reported as a result of a raid by Israeli troops on an apartment in Tyre, which was said to house \nHezbollah fighters.  The Israeli military claimed that Hezbollah militants made up the casualty list; the Israeli military \nalso acknowledged that eight of its own soldiers had been wounded in the raid. Israel additionally warned people in \nSidon to avoid areas where rockets might be launched, presumably auguring strikes against such targets.\n\nOn the other side of the border, Israel continued to be pounded by a barrage of rocket attacks from Hezbollah.  \nAgain, the number of rocket attacks far exceeded the previous volume and numbered in excess of 170 on August 5, \n2006, leaving three women dead.  Haifa was among the places hit by the rocket attacks on this day, and five people \nwere reported to have been injured as a result.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, differences regarding the wording of a possible ceasefire agreement were being worked out \nas the United States and France came to agreement on the matter.  The draft of the proposed United Nations \nSecurity Council Resolution apparently called for a \"full cessation of hostilities,\" demanded that Hezbollah \nimmediately cease all attacks, and declared that Israel immediately halt its offensive military operations.\n\nThe wording was deliberately crafted to allow Israel some room to defend itself in the face of attack. It was hoped \nthat the resolution, which still had to be passed in the 15-member Security Council of the United Nations, would \nbring a quick end to the violence.  United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair and United States President George \nW. Bush lauded the diplomatic progress being made.\n\nIn other developments, humanitarian aid agencies warned that the destruction to infrastructure in Lebanon, and \nparticularly to bridges, was making it very difficult to transport supplies to people in need of help.  Meanwhile, the \nsituation in the Middle East was spurring people from across the world to take to the streets to protest the violence \nand to call for a ceasefire.  Such demonstrations were taking place from Baghdad to London.\n\nAugust 6, 2006\n\nAugust 6, 2006 was the bloodiest day experienced on the Israeli side of the conflict. At least 15 people were killed \nin northern Israel as a result of relentless rocket attacks by Hezbollah. The port city of Haifa was especially hard hit \non this day, with three deaths, dozens of injuries and the collapse of a building.  Israelis were also dying on \nLebanese soil as evidenced by the deaths of 12 soldiers during an attack on the town of Kfar Giladi.  It was the \nhighest number of Israeli deaths in a single incident since the start of the conflict.\n\nIn Lebanon, Israeli strikes killed approximately 14 people.  In the coastal town of Naquora, three people were killed \nin strikes while five civilians died as a result of an air raid in the village of Ansar. The Israeli military reported that its \nforces had launched strikes on a site in Qana where it said rocket launchers were being housed. The military also \nsaid that it had destroyed rocket launchers to the north of Tyre.  Fresh strikes were carried out on the southern \nsuburbs of Beirut, the area of Tyre, as well as the eastern Bekaa Valley.  Clashes between Israeli soldiers and \nHezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon were also ongoing.\n\nIn the diplomatic sphere, Lebanon formally issued a request of the United Nations Security Council. In that request, \nLebanon asked that a provision be added calling on Israel to withdraw from Lebanese terrain. Syria also weighed \ninto the diplomatic process by characterizing the current draft of the proposed resolution as a \"recipe for the \ncontinuation of the war.\" For its part, the Israeli government was generally happy with the draft resolution.\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the Israeli government noted that Israeli forces were prepared to withdraw from Lebanon once \nthe resolution was passed, and so long as Israel had satisfactorily incapacitated Hezbollah's strongholds.\n\nAugust 7, 2006\n\nIsraeli air raids on Lebanon on August 7, 2006, resulted in the deaths of almost 50 people.  Among those killed \nwere up to 30 people in southern Beirut who died in air strikes.  Lebanon's Prime Minister Fuad Siniora corrected a \nclaim that an earlier Israeli air strike had left 40 civilians dead.  Instead, five people were reported to have been \nkilled in the earlier strike.  Clashes between Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon were \nongoing with three Israeli soldiers and five Hezbollah militants killed at Bint Jbeil.  On the other side of the conflict, \nHezbollah fired more than 100 rockets into northern Israel, resulting in civilian casualties.\n\nThe issue of civilian casualties was the topic of a report issued by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, in \nwhich the targeting of civilians was strongly criticized.  Annan said that military operations by both sides, in which \ncivilians suffered the consquences of indiscriminate attacks, constituted a violation of international law. The \nbombing at Qana was specifically noted in this regard.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, United States President George W. Bush conveyed strong support for the United Nations \ndraft resolution, stating that he wanted to see the document passed in the Security Council as soon as possible.  \nThat said, the draft resolution remained in doubt,  as Arab ministers echoed Lebanese demands for changes to the \nproposed resolution.\n\nAugust 8, 2006\n\nOn August 8, 2006, Israeli fighter jets struck at Hezbollah targets in Lebanon.  In the village of Ghaziyeh, at least six \npeople were killed and two dozen injured.  Another strike left 13 villagers dead as they attended a funeral for those \npreviously killed in air raids. One person died when Israeli strikes hit Lebanon's largest Palestinian refugee camp at \nEin el-Hilweh. Clashes between Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon were ongoing, with at \nleast three Israeli soldiers dying in addition.  There was not word about casualties among Hezbollah factions. On \nthe other side of the border, Hezbollah continued its barrage of rocket attacks against southern Israel.\n\nWith rocket attacks increasing, Israel said that it would temporarily relocate remaining residents from the city of \nKiryat Shmona to a safer area.  Compared to the rest of northern Israel, Kiryat Shmona had suffered  the most \nattacks by Hezbollah.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel was stepping up its operations to move toward the Litani River. Israel had earlier dropped leaflets \nin Tyre, the largest Lebanese city south of the Litani River, warning of military strikes to come.  But with many \nroadways in the area bombed and destroyed, those still in the villages around Tyre were expected to have \ndifficulties trying to get out. Israel also warned that as its forces advanced toward the river, any moving vehicles \nspotted in the area south of the Litani would be destroyed.  Given the clear risk outlined by Israel, the United \nNations decided to stop its aid convoy from traveling in that zone.\n\nIn the realm of diplomacy, the United Nations Security Council debated the draft resolution aimed at ending the \nviolence and bloodshed.  At the same time, a delegation from the Arab League traveled to the headquarters of the \ninternational body to officially express backing for Lebanon's demands.  Lebanon had argued that the draft \nresolution should be altered so that it expressly called for Israel's immediate withdrawal from Lebanese terrain.  As \nwell, there were differences over the phrasing in some parts of the draft, which called on Israel to end its \"offensive\" \nmilitary operations, while madating that Hezbollah end \"all\" its attacks.  It was not clear how these demands for \nchanges to the document would be received by the Security Council, especially since many key members appeared \nsupportive of the current version of the draft.  Moreover, France and the United States, who made great headway in \nagreeing to the current terms of the draft, were not apt to make any changes. On the other side of the equation, \nhowever, Russia said that it could not vote for a resolution that did not have the backing of Lebanon.  A vote on the \nresolution was not expected until later in the week.\n\n\n\nAugust 9, 2006\n\nOn August 9, 2006, heavy fighting in Lebanese villages close to the Lebanese-Israeli border resulted in the deaths \nof 15 Israeli soldiers and 40 Hezbollah fighters.  Israeli soldiers later commenced an operation against Hezbollah in \nKhiam. Meanwhile, Israeli strikes continued to bombard targets in Lebanon.  As a result of air strikes in the Bekaa \nValley, a building believed to have housed a Hezbollah fighter collapsed, killing six people.  Beirut continued to be \nhit by Israeli strikes, resulting in deaths of several people.  On the other side of the border, Israel was still dealing \nwith Hezbollah's rocket attacks.\n\nOn the same day, the Israeli cabinet approved sending troops further north toward the Litani River.  However, the \ncabinet also agreed to delay the advancement of the troops in the hopes that a diplomatic resolution could be \nfound.  The plan to deploy Israeli troops northward was not new; it had been discussed for several days in advance \nof the official approval by cabinet.\n\nIn the realm of diplomacy, France and the United States worked on redrafting the original text of the proposed \nUnited Nations resolution.  The redrafting exercise occurred after the two countries disagreed on the proper course \nof action.  Given Lebanon's opposition to the original text on the basis that it did not expressly call for Israel's \nwithdrawal from its own terrain, France said that it would work toward adjustments in the text.  By contrast, \nhowever, the United States was reluctant to make any changes.  The situation set the stage for a possible impasse, \nand by extension, the continuation of hostilities.  Consequently,  French President Jacques Chirac argued that it \nwould be \"immoral\" to relinquish diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire.\n\nAugust 10, 2006\n\nOn August 10, 2006, Israel  dropped another wave of warning leaflets over south Beirut auguring further air strikes \nto come, and urging residents to flee.  Clashes between Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters were reported in \nMarjayoun.  At the same time,  Hezbollah rocket attacks were pounding targets in Israel, leaving two people dead in \nthe Arab village of Deir al-Assad. Meanwhile, Jan Egeland, the head of the United Nations' humanitarian agency, \ndecried both Israel and Hezbollah for creating a humanitarian crisis in Lebanon by preventing the transportation of \nmuch-needed aid and relief supplies.  On the diplomatic front, further efforts were being extended to forge a \ndipomatic resolution that would bring an end to the violence and bloodshed, while setting the terms for sustainable \npeace in the region.\n\nAugust 11, 2006\n\nAs diplomatic efforts were going on in New York on August 11, 2006, to try to resolve the conflict in the Middle East, \nviolence was unabated.  Israeli troops were moving toward the Litani River, with the objective of pushing back \nHezbollah fighters and thusly establishing a de facto security zone.  In Beirut, Israeli strikes were ongoing. \nElsewhere in Lebanon, an attack by an Israeli drone left about four people dead in the town of Marjayoun, located in \nthe south of the country.  Hundreds of Lebanese soldiers and police stranded at barracks  in that very town of \nMarjayoun were being evacuated by United Nations troops. To the north,  Israeli air strikes at a  bridge near the \nLebanon-Syria border left approximately 12 civilians dead.  One Israeli  soldier died in fighting in western Lebanon, \nwhile close to 20 were reported to have been injured in southern Lebanon. On the other side of the border, several \ncasualties were reported in northern Israel as a result of a barrage of missile attacks by Hezbollah.\n\nOn the diplomatic agenda, media reports on August 11, 2006 suggested that the United Nations Security Council \nwas set to debate and vote on a new draft resolution calling for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. The text \nof the draft, which had been changed to reflect concerns articulated by Lebanon about a withdrawal of Israeli \ntroops, called for a \"full cessation of hostilities,\" and made provisions for Israeli troops to pull back from Lebanese \nterrain as local and United Nations forces were deployed along the border.  The draft also authorized an expansion \nof the United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon, known by the acroym UNIFIL, along with increased \nenforcement powers. Left out of the text was a reference to Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter, which would \nfacilitate the use of force if certain conditions were not met.\n\n\n\nIllustrating Israel's dual-pronged approach toward a mix of military tactics along with a diplomatic strategy, Israeli \nPrime Minister Ehud Olmert was reported to have said that he accepted the new ceasefire plan.  This revelation \ncame after Olmert had already directed Israeli troops to expand its offensive operations in Lebanon, presumably \nbecause of the bleak prospect of an acceptable resolution  being passed by the United Nations Security Council \nearlier in the day.  Now, with a shift in the proverbial winds, Olmert was expected to call on his cabinet to sanction \nthe resolution within the next few days.  It was expected that Israeli's military operations would continue until that \ntime.\n\nMeanwhile, an affirmative vote within the United Nations Security Council was expected shortly.  While not perfectly \nin line with the desires of either Israel or Lebanon, the new draft appeared to be acceptable to both parties as well. \nIn a passionate speech at the convening of the Security Council session, United Nations Secretary General Kofi \nAnnan decried the international body's failure to act in a more timely manner, saying that it had \"badly shaken\" the \ninternational community's confidence in the United Nations.  Still, later on August 11, 2006, the United Nations \nSecurity Council unanimously approved Resolution 1701.\n\nA policy adviser in the government of Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora cautiously welcomed the passage of \nthe new resolution. United States Secretary of State, Condoleezzza Rice, declared that agreement would \"open a \npath to lasting peace between Lebanon and Israel.\"  Her French counterpart, Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-\nBlazy, characterized  called the passage of the resolution as \"a historic turning point.\" United Kingdom  Prime \nMinister Tony Blair lauded the resolution and called for an  immediate end to hostilities.  He also said that he \nintended to travel to the Middle East to personally revitalize the stalled peace process between Israelis and \nPalestinians.  But on the other side of the equation, Qatar, which at the time held a seat on the Security Council as \na non-permanent member, criticized the resolution for containing provisions that favored Israel.\n\nAugust 12, 2006\n\nUnited Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan announced on August 12, 2006 that that the ceasefire called for in \nSecurity Council Resolution 1701 would go into effect at 05:00GMT on August 14, 2006.\n\nHezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said that his group intended to abide by the United Nations ceasefire, \nhowever, he warned that fighting would prevail while Israeli troops were still inside Lebanon. Such a position \npromised that there would be no immediate end to the hostilities.  This was because Israel had said that it would \ntake some time to draw down its troops while  UNIFIL forces were deployed -- a process that could well take close \nto a month. For his part, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert issued praise for Resolution 1701, characterizing it as \nboth positive and acceptable.  He also said that he would seek approval from his cabinet on August 13, 2006 to \nabide by the ceasefire agreement.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel's ground assault in Lebanon continued, with particular effort expended by forces moving north to \nthe Litani River.  In southern and northern Lebanon, air strikes by Israeli fighter jets carried on with some deaths \nreported in the southern city of Tyre.\n\nAugust 13, 2006\n\nOn August 13, 2006, the Israeli cabinet endorsed United Nations Security Resolution 1701, but warned that its \ntroops would not exit Lebanon until UNIFIL forces were deployed.  That position, in conjunction with the stance \narticulated earlier by Hezbollah that it would abide by the ceasefire only when Israeli troops were out of Lebanon, \nsuggested that fighting was destined to continue until the deployment of the newly-madated United Nations forces \n(UNIFIL).  Indeed, United Nations Deputy Secretary General Mark Malloch Brown said that it could take up to a \nmonth to install UNIFIL in southern Lebanon. For its part, Lebanon's cabinet postponed an important meeting to \ndiscuss the disarmament of Hezbollah -- a key directive set forth in Security Resolution 1701.\n\nMeanwhile,  the conflict raged on in Israel and Lebanon. Israeli strikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, including \nthe cities of Tyre and Beirut, left close to 20 people dead.  Aid personnel and rescue workers said that Israeli air \nstrikes had resulted in the collapse of several buildings in southern Beirut.  There were also reports of strikes in \neastern Lebanon.  In fighting between Israeli troops and Hezbollah fighters, five Israeli soldiers were reported to \n\n\n\nhave been killed.  Among those who died was Uri Grossman, the son of renowned Israeli writer and peace activist, \nDavid Grossman.  The younger Grossman died as a result of an anti-tank missile only days after the older \nGrossman joined a call by Israeli intelligentsia for an end to the violence.  On the other side of the conflict, \nHezbollah fired a relentless barrage of rockets into Israel, this time numbering around 250 in total.\n\nAugust 14, 2006\n\nOn the first day of the ceasefire, relative calm reigned both in northern Israel and across Lebanon, with only \nsporadic fighting reported in disparate areas.  The easing of hostilities ensued despite earlier assertions by \nHezbollah that it would continue its fighting until Israel left Lebanon, and regardless of the fact that Israel said it \nwould remain in Lebanon until UNIFIL forces were installed.\n\nIsrael also issued a statement noting that it intended to pursue Hezbollah leaders.\n\nDisplaced Lebanese attempted to traverse bombed-out roads to return to their homes despite the fact that travel \nrestrictions were still in place.  On the other side of the border, few people in northern Israel left their bomb shelters, \nevidently not quite willing to trust yet that the ceasefire would hold. \n\nLater in the day, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert expressed satisfaction in his country's elimination of \nHezbollah's dominance in southern Lebanon, and Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah gave a televised address in \nwhich he claimed \"historic victory.\"\n\nIn the backdrop of these competing claims of victory, President George W. Bush of the United States and President \nMahmoud Ahmadinejad blamed one another for spurring the conflict.\n\nAugust 15, 2006\n\nThe second day of the tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah was marked by occasional spurts of \nfighting.  In one case, five Hezbollah gunmen were reported to have been shot by Israeli soldiers.  In another case, \nHezbollah militants fired several mortars in the direction of Israel, however, none landed across the border.  Amidst \nthese intermittent bursts of violence, efforts were underway to try to find bodies of the dead.\n\nMeanwhile,  the United Nations said that it was hoping to establish 3,500 troops in southern Lebanon within two \nweeks and up to 15,000 within a month.  Most of the soldiers were expected to come from France.  In the backdrop \nof this announcement, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad hailed Hezbollah's victory and said that it augured a new \nMiddle East.  At the same time, he assailed the United States' perspective of the region.\n\nAugust 16, 2006\n\nThe third day of the fragile ceasefire ensued much like the previous day -- with the truce holding in spite of sporadic \nviolence.\n\nIsrael warned that southern Lebanon was vulnerable to the resumption of violence until United Nations troops were \ndeployed and the Lebanese military was operating in the border region.\n\nNegotiations were ongoing to formulate a United Nations peacekeeping force as called for in United Nations \nSecurity Resolution 1701 to enforce the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. France was contributing the lion's \nshare of troops, also the force would also include the Lebanese army.  France said that it might be prepared to \ncommand the peacekeeping mission but only if certain conditions were in effect.  Other than France, other countries \nsaid that they might be joining the effort, but no formal pledge of troops was made.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations said that approximately 250,000 Lebanese people had returned to their homes with \nhalf a million Lebanese en route.\n\n\n\nAugust 17, 2006\n\nAugust 17, 2006 was marked by the crossing of the Litani River by Lebanese military, which then took up positions \nin the area of the strategically-located waterway as Israeli troops withdrew.  The Israeli military also said that it had \ntransferred control of up to half of its positions in southern Lebanon to the current (not-yet fortified) United Nations \npeacekeeping mission there.  In order to stave off the chance of bloodshed should a wave of attacks resume, Israel \ndropped new leaflets urging people not to travel in and around southern Lebanon.  Despite this warning, displaced \nLebanese people worked their way home.\n\nAugust 18, 2006\n\nIn the Lebanese capital of Beirut on August 18, 2006, Hezbollah representatives handed out disbursements of \n$12,000 to residents whose homes and businesses had been decimated in the conflict between its group and \nIsrael.  By this day, up to 400,000 Lebanese had returned home to southern Lebanon.  In the town of Qana where a \nnumber of people were killed in an Israeli air strike that garnered international condemnation, relatives of the dead \nhosted a mass funeral.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations called on European countries to come forward and contribute troops to the \npeacekeeping force in Lebanon, which had been provided for in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701.  \nThus far, only France had expressed the possibility of contributing troops, however, Italy added its bid to the list of \ncountries willing to participate in the peacekeeping mission.  Italy also said that it was prepared to take the \nleadership role in the operation.\n\nThe call from the United Nations came on the heels of a complaint by Israel that it would be \"inconceivable\" that \npeacekeepers be accepted from countries like Indonesia and Malaysia, which deny the right of Israel to exist.\n\nAugust 19, 2006\n\nOn August 19, 2006, Israel carried out an air raid in the Bekaa Valley deep within Lebanese territory.  One Israeli \nand three Hezbollah fighters were reported to have been killed.  The Lebanese government described the air raid \nas a blatant violation of the existing ceasefire, however, the Israeli government said it was responding to an attempt \nby Hezbollah to rearm itself.  It thus claimed that Hezbollah and not Israel was in violation of the ceasefire \nagreement.  The scenario unfolded only hours after United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan characterized the \nsituation in the conflict zone as \"fragile.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the first of the new deployments of United Nations  peacekeepers arrived on the ground; these included \n50 engineers from France.\n\nAugust 20, 2006\n\nA day after Israel said that it had carried out an air raid in the Bekaa Valley to prevent Hezbollah from rearming \nitself, Lebanon's Defense Minister Elias Murr warned that anyone firing rockets into Israel from the south would be \nregarded as a traitor.  His warning came along with an expression of confidence regarding Hezbollah's commitment \nto the existing ceasefire set forth un United Nations Security Resolution 1701.  In the backdrop of these \ndevelopments. United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan rejected Israel's explanation for the air raid, noting \nthat it was indeed a violation of the ceasefire agreement.\n\nMeanwhile, France called on the European Union to convene a meeting to discuss involvement in the United \nNations peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon.  At issue were Israel's concerns about the composition of the \nforce, as well as overall concerns about deployment.  Emphasizing what had already been noted, Israeli Prime \nMinister Ehud Olmert said that peacekeepers from countries that did not have diplomatic relations  with Israel were \nnot acceptable. \n\nAugust 21, 2006\n\n\n\nAttention turned on August 21, 2006 to reconstruction of the conflict-ravaged region when United States President \nGeorge W. Bush said that there would be an aid package earmarked for Lebanon's reconstruction worth \napproximately $230 million in United States currency (USD).  Bush also called for the deployment of a United \nNations (U.N.) peacekeeping force in Lebanon as quickly as possible.\n\nOn that particular issue,  Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi was reported to have told U.N.  Secretary General \nKofi Annan that Italy was willing to lead the peacekeeping mission. As regards Israel's opposition to the \nparticipation of certain countries as peacekeepers -- notably from countries that did not recognize the state of Israel \n-- U.N. Deputy General Mark Malloch Brown noted that Israel did not have the power to foreclose participation by \nany specific country, regardless of whether or not there were diplomatic ties.\n\nAt home in Israel, hundreds of Israeli army reservists signed an open letter calling for a massive investigation into \nthe handling of the war against Hezbollah. At issue was the lack of decisive leadership by the military and \npoliticians, exemplified by ever-shifting objectives of the war.\n\nAcross the border in southern Lebanon, the discovery of British-made night-vision equipment in Hezbollah bunkers \nwas believed to be British,  led to the launching of an investigation by the British authorities.  At issue in this case \nwas the question of how that equipment came to be in Hezbollah's possession.\n\nMeanwhile, sporadic hostilities ensued, exemplified by the killing of two Hezbollah fighters by Israel.  The Israeli \nmilitary explained that the Hezbollah fighters were among a group of men who approached their troops in a \n\"threatening manner\" in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah did not concur with this version of events.  For its part, \nHezbollah's deputy leader Sheikh Naeem Kassem rejected requirements for the militant group's disarmament \nsaying on al-Jazeera Arabic television that the resistance would continue. Nevertheless, Terje Roed-Larsen, a \nsenior U.N. envoy, expressed optimism regarding the prevailing ceasefire.\n\nAugust 22, 2006\n\nOn the heels of the news that Italy was willing to both contribute troops  and act lead the peacekeeping mission in \nthe conflict zone,  Italian Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema tempered the announcement by noting that his \ncountry's involvement was contingent upon a commitment to respect for the prevailing ceasefire.  The Italian \nForeign Minister also called on the European Union to convene an urgent meeting of foreign ministers to discuss \nthe contribution of European forces to Middle East peacekeeping efforts.\n\nOn the issue of the peacekeeping mission, senior United Nations envoy Terje Roed-Larsen warned that Lebanon \nwould likely experience a security vacuum while organization was being established. In other developments, the \nhuman rights group, Amnesty International, accuse Israel of committing war crimes by deliberately targeting civilian \ninfrastructure in Lebanon.  It was a claim vociferously denied by Israel.  Amnesty International also demanded a \nUnited Nations investigation into war tactics of both Israel and Hezbollah aimed at determining of any humanitarian \nlaws had been breached.\n\nAugust 23, 2006\n\nA meeting between European Union ambassadors and military official convened in Belgium at which the issue of \nEurope's contribution to a United Nations (U.N.) peacekeeping force on the Israeli-Lebanese border was \ndiscussed.\n\nMeanwhile, a day after a senior U.N. envoy warned of a security vacuum in Lebanon as the  proposed \npeacekeeping mission was being established, Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni called for quick action on the \nmatter.  She particularly noted that time was running short for the application of the U.N. ceasefire resolution along \nthe Lebanese-Irsaeli border.\n\nIn a related development, Israel also suggested that U.N. peacekeeping troops also patrol the Lebanese-Syrian \nborder in order to prevent the movement of arms by Hezbollah.  But Syrian President Bashar al-Assad soundly \n\n\n\nrejected Israel's suggestion, stating that such a measure would be viewed as a \"hostile act.\"  Syria later said that it \nwould close its border with Lebanon if such a move was implemented.\n\nIn a separate development, one Israeli soldier was killed and three others were injured when their military tank hit a \nlandmine in southern Lebanon.\n\nAugust 24, 2006\n\nFinland, which held the presidency of the European Union in late August 2006, said that United Nations (U.N.) \ntroops should be deployed to the conflict zone within a week.  The announcement by Finland came at a time of \nincreasing urgency regarding the establishment of peacekeeping forces along the Lebanese-Israeli border.  Also \non the subject of the peacekeeping mission, France pledged an additional 1,600 troops to the effort and registered \nits willingness to continue to lead the force.\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of thousands of Lebanese were returning home.  In southern Lebanon, returning residents \nfaced the problems of a lack of proper sanitation and no potable water.  To this end, the U.N.  launched a 60-day \nplan to deal with the humanitarian situation in Lebanon.\n\nAugust 27, 2006\n\nOn August 27, 2005, Hezbollah's leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, expressed his regret regarding the war between \nhis group and Israel on Lebanese terrain.  In an interview on Lebanese television, Nasrallah acknowledged that he \nhad ordered the capture of the two Israeli soldiers -- the incident that resulted in Israel's military response and \neffectively sparked the war.  He said that had he known the extent of the repercussions of his actions -- a conflict \nlasting approximately one month and resulting in the deaths of more than 1,000 people -- he would have acted \ndifferently. In the interview, Nasrallah also said that he did not expect fighting to resume, effectively suggesting that \nhis group was likely to hold to the ongoing truce.\n\nAugust 30, 2006\n\nThe issue of Israel's blockade of Lebanon came to the fore at the close of August 2006.  Despite the presence of an \nongoing truce, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert rejected calls for an end to his country's seven-week blockade of \nLebanon.  Following discussions with United Nations (U.N.) Secretary General Kofi Annan, Olmert said the \nblockade would be lifted when all the ceasefire requirements were implemented. Olmert particularly specified one of \nthe central conditions for an end to Israel's blockade of Israel as being the release of two Israeli soldiers captured \nby Hezbollah.  He said that unless the two Israeli soldiers were freed, the U.N. Security Council Resolution could \nnot \"be considered as fully implemented.\"\n\nAnnan echoed Olmert's call for this condition to be met and appealed for the \"unambiguous and unconditional \nrelease\" of the soldiers.\n\nIt was unclear if such a measure would actually materialize.  Indeed, Lebanese Energy Minister Mohammed Fneish \nwho was also a member of the political wing of Hezbollah said that the unconditional release of the Israeli soldiers \nwas \"not possible.\"  He said that the Israeli soldiers would only be freed within the constraints of a prisoner \nexchange with Israel.\n\nThe close of August 2006 was also marked by the denunciation of Israel's use of cluster bombs during its conflict \nwith Hezbollah on Lebanese terrain. The U.N said that the cluster bombs had caused death and injuries, and the \nU.N. Mine Action Coordination Center said that up to 100,000 unexploded cluster \"bomblets\" had been found at \nhundreds of sites in Lebanon. The U.N.'s humanitarian head, Jan Egeland, characterized the use of cluster bombs \nin the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah as \"immoral.\"  He argued that the majority of the cluster bomb strikes \nhad taken place in the last days of the conflict, when a resolution appeared likely.  He thusly said that the strikes \nmade at that sensitive time were \"shocking.\"\n\n\n\nFor its part, Israel said that its use of such munitions was compliant with international law.  That said, there were \nsome media reports that the bombs had been purchased from the United States on the basis of conditional use, the \nrequirements of which may not have been met.  The United States said that it was investigating whether or not \nIsrael had used the cluster bombs on non-military targets, which was prohibited under the terms of the sale \nagreement.  Even so, a conditional use agreement between Israel and the United States would not constitute an \nactual violation of international law.\n\nIn other developments, the European Commission pledged 42 million euros toward the reconstruction of Lebanon.  \nAt home in Lebanon, Prime Minister Fouad Siniora said that his government would allot $33,000 in compensation to \ntens of thousands of families whose homes were destroyed in the conflict.\n\nAugust 31, 2006\n\nA donor conference in Sweden on August 31, 2006 focused on raising funds to be used toward Lebanon's post-war \nreconstruction.  The Swedish Foreign Minister Jan Eliasson said that $940 million in new funds had been pledged -- \nbringing the total reconstruction funds to $1.2 billion.  The event was an apparent success given the fact that the \nconference's organizers had aimed to collect $500 million.\n\nSeptember 4, 2006\n\nBy the start of September 2006, United Nations (U.N.) Secretary General Kofi Annan said that Israel and Hezbollah \nhad accepted his offer to mediate the dispute over two captured Israeli soldiers.  Despite this announcement by the \nU.N. head, Israel publicly reiterated its stance that the soldiers had to be released unconditionally and noted that \nthis was a condition of the U.N. Security Council resolution, which  brought an end to the war between Israel and \nHezbollah.  Within this context, Israel said that Annan would assist in the release of its soldiers, rather than mediate \nan agreement.  Many analysts surmised that despite its public pronouncements, Israel may have privately \nacknowledged that a deal would have  to be brokered in order to garner the release of the two soldiers.\n\nSeptember 6, 2006\n\nOn September 6, 2006, Israel said that it intended to lift its air, land and sea blockade of  Lebanon.  The \nannouncement came days after Israel firmly stated that it would not lift its blockade until all conditions of the \nprevailing United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 were met.  Israel said that it was holding its position in \norder to prevent Hezbollah for accessing weaponry.  Israel said that it did not intend to to lift the embargo until \ninternational forces were fully deployed in the conflict zone and could ensure that the transport of weaponry did not \ntake place.  News that French, Greek and Italian troops would patrol the conflict zone, followed later by German \nforces, appeared to have assuaged Israel in some measure. \n\nAs well, the shift in stance may have been attributed partially to mounting international pressure, in conjunction with \nefforts to release the two Israeli soldiers, whose capture sparked the war between Israel and Lebanon.  For its part, \nIsrael has publicly said that it will not negotiate with terrorists -- a reference to Hezbollah.  That said, some sources \nsuggest that  efforts are underway to try to secure the release of the soldiers -- a process that may well involve \nengagement by Israel at some point, as well as the possibility of deal-making.\n\nLater in September, 2006\n\nLater in September 2006, with the truce in full force, the human rights group, Amnesty International, accused \nHezbollah of war crimes. It had previously made a similar charge against Israel.  Amnesty said that \nHezbollah's conduct of aggression from civilian terrain was classified as a war crime.  Also in September 2006, \nHezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, led a victory rally in southern Beirut to proclaim the success of his \n\n\n\ngroup's efforts, and also to assert that Hezbollah was still in possession of a number of rockets.  Nasrallah was also \nchampioning the idea of a new government in Lebanon with greater Hezbollah representation, presumably with \ngreater ties to Syria  and Iran.  the natural corollary of such a government would entail the resignation of Fuad \nSiniora's moderate government. On the other side of the border, Israelis were carrying out periodic demonstrations \nagainst the Israel government, and particularly Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.  Many Israelis called for the Israeli \nprime minister's resignation and protested his leadership during the war with Hezbollah.  In this way, the aftermath \nof the war yielded clear political ramifications, not the least of which was the precariousness of the positions of the \nleaders of both Israel and Lebanon.\n\nOctober 2006\n\nBy the start of October 2006, the United Nations said that Israel had fulfilled a core conditions of the ceasefire \nagreement by withdrawing the vast majority of its troops from Lebanon.  Only in a border village of Ghajar were \nthere some Israeli troops left.  Monitoring and enforcing the ceasefire were both Lebanese troops and international \npeacekeepers. On the other side of the equation, however, Hezbollah was yet to comply with the requirement that it \ndisarm.  Instead, the group refused to comply, saying  that it intended to keep its fighters equipped to resume \noperations.\n\nOn October 22, 2006, Israel acknowledged its use of  phosphorus during its war with Hezbollah in Lebanon in mid-\n2006. The admission that it had dropped phosphorus munitions on military targets contravened against earlier \nstatements that phosphorus weapons were used only to mark targets.  Because of the severe chemical burns \ncaused by phosphorus weapons, its use has been regarded as strongly controversial. In fact,  the Red Cross and \nother humanitarian agencies have said that phosphorus  munitions should be regarded as chemical weapons.  At \nthe same time,  the  Geneva Conventions expressly prohibits the use of white phosphorus against civilian \npopulations and in air attacks against military forces in civilian areas. For its part, Israel said that its use of these \nweapons did not contravene against international law.  Meanwhile, Hezbollah was also facing criticism for its \nwarfare tactics.  The group Human Rights Watch accused both Hezbollah and Israel of using cluster bombs during \nits war in mid-2006.  For its part, Hezbollah denied that it had used cluster munitions.\n\nPost-War Developments\n\nOn October 15,  2006, three grenades were fired in the center of the capital city of Beirut.  There was some \nstructural damage and several people were injured as a result. The area of the attacks was the site of a number of \nnightclubs -- a location in close proximity to the headquarters for the United Nations. It was the third such incident in \nthe Lebanese capital within ten days, leading government officials to say that they believed the three attacks were \nconnected.  In particular, Interior Minister Ahmed Fatfat expressed the view that the attacks were aimed \ndestabilizing the country, which was not recovering from the war between Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah \nmonths earlier.  To this end, he said, \"It is clear that there is an attempt to ignite security strife in the country.\"\n\nA month later, Lebanon was embroiled in a domestic struggle for power between the Western-backed and \ndemocratically-elected Siniora government and pro-Syrian Hezbollah.  The situation took a turn for the worse when, \nin the first week of November 2006, six cabinet ministers aligned with Hezbollah resigned from government, \nfollowing the collapse of multi-party unity talks. \n\nAt issue was the demand by Hezbollah for substantially more power and influence in the political sphere in the \naftermath of the war with Israel, which raised the profile of Hezbollah, and cast relations with Syria in more \nfavorable light.  Buoyed by that change in the political landscape, Hezbollah was demanding more of a say in the \ncountry's political decision-making.\n\n\n\nOn the other side of the equation, however, Siniora was vowing not to bend to \"the tyranny of the minority\" -- a \npossible reference to the small number of Hezbollah-affiliated members in government prior to their resingations.  \nSiniora's position was echoed by Druze leader, Walid Jumblatt, who foreclosed the possibility of Hezbollah and the \npro-Syrian faction having a decisive say in government. Indeed, Jumblatt noted that Hezbollah and its allies already \nhad control of the presidency (a reference to Emile Lahoud), important ties to Iran and Syria, as well as possession \nof weaponry -- all of which, he alleged, had a negative effect on Lebanese democracy and sovereignty. \n\nThe situation was further complicated by  the decision by the cabinet -- now without the pro-Syrian and Hezbollah-\naffiliated members -- to approve the statutes drafted by the United Nations to establish a special tribunal charged \nwith prosecuting those responsible for the assassination of former Lebanese leader, Rafik Hariri.\n\nSiniora, Jumblatt and other anti-Syrian leaders  had criticized their pro-Syrian colleagues for trying to block the \ncreation of the tribunal.  Indeed, pro-Syrian factions have been implicated by  the United Nations (as intimated \nearlier) in Hariri's assassination.  Not one to accept the situation as it stood, Syrian-backed President Lahoud \nissued a letter to the office of the United Nations Secretary General  charging that the approval of the statutes by \nSiniora's government was not legitimate since he had not given his approval, and because some of the cabinet \nmembers had resigned.  For its part, the Siniora government said that its decision was fully constitutional. \n\nOn November 21, 2006, Industry Minister Pierre Gemayel  was assassinated in the Christian suburb of Jdaideh in \nLebanon's capital city of Beirut.  Gemayel's  car was rammed by three gunmen, who then sprayed the vehicle with \ngunfire and shot the cabinet minister at close range. Gemayel was taken to the hospital in critical condition where \nhe died.\n\nAt only 34 years of age, Gemayel was one of the youngest politicians in Lebanon, and certainly one of the youngest \nto ever suffer political assassination.  A Maronite Christian, he was known for his anti-Syrian stance, as well as \nhis well-known Gemayel family, who formed something of a modern political dynasty in the Lebanese political \nspectrum.\n\nHis grandfather, Pierre Gemayel, for whom he was named, had been the founder of the Phalange Party; his father, \nAmin Gemayel, once served as the country's president.  \n\nLebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora reacted to the tragic news by saying, \"Assassinations will not terrorise us. \nWe will not let the criminal killers control our fate.\"\n\nIn a poignant moment during his press conference, Siniora addressed the late Gemayel, asking him to give regards \nto Hariri -- the former Lebanese leader who was also assassinated over a year earlier -- promising that both their \ndeaths would not be in vain.\n\nThe international community was quick to condemn Gemayel's assassination.  United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony \nBlair said the killing was \"completely without any justification\" and said,  \"We condemn this murder utterly.\"  United \nStates President George W. Bush called for an investigation in Gemayel's death, and said that his country would \nstand in support of the Siniora government.\n\nDespite appeals for calm from the victim's father, former President Amin Gemayel,  crowds of people -- both \ninfuriated and wracked by grief -- gathered in the streets, particularly outside the hospital where the cabinet minister \ndied. Other protests were reported to be taking place in various Christian districts of Beirut, the Christian town of \nZahle in the eastern part of the country, as well as Gemayel's homtown of Bikfaya to the east of Beirut.\n\nIn an effort to stave off violence, the Lebanese army was being deployed in and around Beirut.\n\n\n\nGemayel's death was the latest in a list of assassinations since 2005  that began with the murder of former Prime \nMinister Hariri, but went on to include journalist Samir Kassir, ex-communist leader George Hawi, and \nparliamentarian / newspaper editor Gebran Tueni.  During the same period, journalist May Chidiac survived an \nassassination attempt.\n\nAll of the victims were known for being vocal critics of Syria's influence in Lebanon.  In the immediate aftermath of \nGemayel's murder, Saad Hariri, the son of the assassinated former prime minister and the current leader of the \nanti-Syrian majority in parliament, accused Syria of being involved.  That said, Syria was quick to condemn \nGemayel's death, even characterizing it as \"a dispicable crime,\" and expressing sympathy.  As such, there was also \nsome speculation about Hezbollah being responsible for the murder, Syria's possible involvement notwithstanding.  \nBehind this hypothesis was the view that Hezbollah was becoming more aggressive in demanding political power \nfrom the Siniora government, which was itself at risk of collapse. \n\nWith Gemayel's death now in the forefront of the consciousness of many Lebanese, it was difficult to determine how \nHezbollah's  influence would be affected.  Likewise, it was too soon to tell if the Siniora government could withstand \ncollapse, or if Gemayel's assassination could rally support by anti-Syrian factions -- and in a direction away from \nHezbollah's sphere of influence.\n\nIn late 2006, the Lebanese capital of Beirut was overwhelmed by mass protests by  pro-Hezbollah and pro-Syrian \nfactions, demanding the end of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora's government.  Protestors were calling for a new \ngovernment that would include more allies of Hezbollah and the pro-Syrian opposition, and would be capable of \nwielding more influence.  But with Siniora and his government still refusing to resign, a political  crisis seemed \ninevitable.\n\nThe situation was not helped by the fact that emotions were still running high in the aftermath of the aforementioned \nassassination of Pierre Gemayel only a week earlier.\n\nComplicating matters was the fact that the demonstrations were taking on a sectarian cast, as evidenced by the \nclashes erupting between Shi'a and Sunni Muslims.  Moreover, sectarian affiliations appeared to be linked with \nparticular political allegiances.  Whereas Shi'as were largely allied with Hezbollah, on the other side of the \nequation, Sunnis, Christians and Druze tended to align with Siniora's government. Analysts were, therefore, \nwarning that civil strife could potentially be rekindled in Lebanon.  That type of destabilization would inevitably have \nregional implications.\n\nIn response, regional blocs, such as the Arab League, as well as envoys from the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain \nand Tunisia, were extending their assistance.  They offered to facilitate negotiations between the Siniora \ngovernment and  the pro-Syrian opposition, along with its Hezbollah allies.\n\nThe second week of December 2006 saw further protests with hundreds of thousands of people  taking to the \nstreets of Beirut and demanding that the Siniora government give more power to the pro-Hezbollah and pro-Syrian \nopposition.  In an effort to prevent the eruption of violence, Lebanese military troops were deployed to the streets of \nthe capital city, and were seen barricading the key roads around the two squares where the demonstrations were \ntaking place. Also visible on the streets of Beirut were Hezbollah security agents.\n\nBy January 2007, a general strike in Lebanon exacerbated the chaos.  Clashes between pro-Hezbollah supporters \nand government supporters resulted in over 100 injuries and some deaths, while thousands of protestors brought \nthe capital city of Beirut to a virtual standstill.  Protestors were also participating in the strike in the Shi'a south and \neast of Lebanon.  The northern part of the country, which was inhabited by both Christians and Muslims, saw a \ncomplex mix of  institutional support and opposition to the government.  At issue remained the demand for greater \n\n\n\npower and influence by pro-Hezbollah and pro-Syrian factions in government, and an orientation away from \ninfluence by the West. \n\nPrime Minister Fouad Siniora responded to the brewing crisis in Lebanon by stating in a televised address that he \nintended to stand squarely against the \"intimidation\" by the opposition and its supporters. To this end, he said,  \n\"Today's general strike turned into actions and harassment that overstepped all limits and rekindled memories of \ntimes of strife, war and hegemony.\"  But the opposition warned that it would not let up its efforts.\n\nThe situation turned particularly grim when clashes erupted at Beirut's Arab University between Sunni pro-\ngovernment factions and Shi'a opponents.  Several people were killed and over 150 others were injured as the two \nsides turned violent and hurled rocks, clubs and other items at one another, eventually spreading the violence \nbeyond the university campus and across the capital. The fighting came to a close after the military fired into the air \nand an overnight curfew was imposed.\n\nThe developments overshadowed a donor's conference aimed at helping Lebanon rebuild and restore its \ninfrastructure following the damaging war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. \n\nLebanon was wracked by bombs on February 13, 2007 -- the eve of the second anniversary of the assassination of \nformer Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri.\n\nThe bombs exploded on two buses in a Christian area and left  at least three people dead and more than 20 \ninjured. \n\nConflict and the Palestinian Refugee Camp\n\nOn May 20, 2007, intense fighting between Lebanese soldiers and radical Islamic fighters from a Palestinian \nrefugee camp left at least 50 people dead close to the city of Tripoli in the northern part of Lebanon.\n\nAmong those killed on that day were more than 20 Lebanese troops and at least 20 gunmen from the Fatah Islam \ngroup.  Two civilians also died as a result of the fighting, while scores more people, including several soldiers, were \ninjured.\n\nThe group, Fatah Islam, which split from Fatah al-Intifada in late 2006, has been based at the Nahr al-Bared \nrefugee camp.  It was believed to have ties to the terrorist enclave, al-Qaida, although the group denies this claim.\n\nThere were also suspicions of a connection to Syrian intelligence.\n\nThe group has been largely shunned by other Palestinian organizations.\n\nThe fighting was said to have been sparked by the raid of a building aimed at arresting of bank robbery suspects in \nTripoli.  The suspects, also allegedly radical Islamic militants, resisted arrest and then attacked the army posts of \nthe Nahr el-Bared refugee camp where 30,000 displaced Palestinians were said to be living.  Lebanese forces then \nretaliated by storming the camp.\n\nIn separate attacks, an explosion was reported in the capital city of Beirut.  It was unknown whether it was related to \na blast in the Christian district of Ashrafieh, which left one woman dead and at least 10 people wounded.\n\n\n\nA day later, on May 21, 2007, Lebanese troops and Palestinian Islamic militants continued to battle for another day \naround the Nahr al-Bared refugee camp close to Tripoli.\n\nLebanon's Information Minister Ghazi Aridi promised that the military would continue its efforts against the \nPalestinian extremist group.  Arizo also noted that leading figures of Fatah Islam were among the fighters who had \nbeen killed the day before, and he alleged they were responsible for past attacks as well as the planning of future \nattacks.  To this end, Lebanese security officials said that one militant was wanted in Germany in connection with \nan unsuccessful train bombing plot in mid-2006. \n\nWhile the conflict appeared to be lessening as Lebanese troops took control of the perimeter of the Nahr al-Bared \nrefugee camp, the exchange of  gunfire continued through the next day.  Caught in the cross-fire were civilians \ninside the camp.  As a result, the death toll was expanding with reports of the deaths of several civilians, including \nLebanese citizens and Palestinian refugees.  The list of those suffering from injuries was also increasing and there \nwere attempts to move the wounded to hospitals for treatment.  Meanwhile, there were burgeoning humanitarian \nconcerns about deteriorating conditions on the ground.\n\nThat situation was not helped on May 22, 2007 when a convoy carrying aid entered the Nahr al-Bared camp came \nunder heavy fire and shelling, thus forcing its retreat.  The convoy of six truck was transporting  food, water, \nmedical supplies, an electrical generator, and other necessities.  In the midst of this development, heavy fighting \nappeared to have resumed between the two sides, effectively nullifying reports of a supposed ceasefire. \n\nAt the national level, the Lebanese government authorized the military to intensify its efforts in dealing with the \nextremist fighters.  Internationally, the United States said the extremist forces had to be \"reined in.\"  European \nUnion foreign policy head Javier Solana was set to convene meetings with Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora \nin Beirut to discuss the situation.\n\nMeanwhile, Lebanese Trade Minister Sami Haddad said in an interview with the British media that he believed Syria \nwas responsible for orchestrating the violence for the purpose of destabilizing the Lebanese government. But \nBashar Jaafari, the Syrian ambassador to the United Nations dismissed this notion, asserting that there was no link \nbetween his government and  Fatah Islam.  He also made note of the fact that some members of the group had \nbeen imprisoned in Syrian jails for their support for al-Qaida.\n\nAfter a week of ongoing clashes between the Lebanese army and radical Islamic fighters at a Palestinian refugee \ncamp, the situation remained unresolved.  While an official from the United Nations said that about 25,000 civilians \nhad managed to flee the Nahr al-Bared refugee compound, about 6,000 people remained trapped there -- \neffectively caught in the crossfire of violence.\n\nOn May 26, 2007, Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora said in an interview with British media that if the radical \nIslamic fighters of Fatah Islam surrendered, they would be treated fairly.  He warned, however, that if the radical \nPalestinian Islamists continued to fight, the army would deal with them.  In the meanwhile, an uneasy cease-fire \nwas ongoing as the Lebanese authorities allowed Palestinian factions a few days to try to forge a peaceful end to \nthe crisis.\n\nDespite this uneasy cease-fire and negotiation plan, on May 27, 2007, Lebanese troops came under attack from the \nIslamist militants inside the Palestinian refugee camp. In the background of this development was the clear rejection \nof a resolution on the part of Fatah Islam leader, Shaker al-Abssi, who in a videotaped message promised to \"fight \nJews, Americans and their allies.\" \n\n\n\nWeeks after fighting ensued between Lebanese troops and Islamic militants at the Nahr-al-Bared refugee camp \nnear Tripoli, a new site of similar violence broke out at the Ain al-Hilweh camp close to Sidon.  In this case, the \nfighting involved Lebanese soldiers and militants from the group, Jund al-Sham.  Reports suggested that the \nsituation at Ain al-Hilweh was provoked after militants fired a rocket-propelled grenade at an army checkpoint.  \nLebanese soldiers responded to the attack with gunfire. The mayor of Sidon, Abdul Rahman Bizri, later said the \nincident was limited in scope and was ultimately contained. \n\nBut on June 4, 2007, a commander for Fatah Islam warned it would enter the fray and escalate the newly-sparked \nconflict at Ain al-Hilweh.  The warning from Commander Abu Hureira came after two Lebanese soldiers were \nreported to have been killed in the fighting there with the other extremist group, Jund al-Sham.\n\nOn June 5, 2007,  the head of the Palestinian Fatah political party in Lebanon (distinct from the extremist group \nFatah Islam), announced that seven militants had surrendered and laid down their arms.  Khaled Aref explained to \nthe media, \"They surrendered on Monday and Tuesday to Fatah men in the Nahr al-Bared camp.\" He continued, \n\"We can confirm that men from Fatah al-Islam turned themselves in and handed over their weapons.\"\n\nWhile that announcement was welcomed, two days later on June 7, 2007, the violence was ongoing at Nahr al-\nBared.  Lebanese troops, fortified by air power, carried out heavy shelling of the refugee camp.  Clashes on the \nground were also going on, with one Lebanese soldier reported to have been killed as a result. \n\nMeanwhile, violence was not limited to the two camps.  In Beirut, four bombs exploded in the weeks since the start \nof the fighting.  In one case, a bomb exploded on a bus; several people were reported to have been injured as a \nresult.  It was unknown as to who was responsible, however, Lebanese authorities alleged that the bombings were \nlikely connected to the conflict at the two camps.  Complicating matters even further was the discovery of three \nvehicles packed with explosives close to Lebanon's border with Syria.  Lebanese officials said that the vehicles \nwere intended to be used as car bombs; they also noted that two Syrians and one Iraqi had been arrested. \n\nAt the start of July 2007, attention returned to the ongoing conflict at the aforementioned Nahr al-Bared refugee \ncamp.  Palestinian refugees were trying to get past a security checkpoint, in an attempt to return to their homes, \nand were fired on by the Lebanese army.  As a result, at least three people were said to have been killed, and over \n40 people were reportedly injured. While it was unclear whether the protestors provoked the soldiers or not, the \nLebanese army said the troops were responding with warning shots to the fact that throngs of people were burning \ntires and attacking soldiers with sharp objects.  Human Right Watch called for an independent inquiry into the \nsituation.\n\nBy the middle of July 2007, the conflict between Lebanese troops and  Fatah Islam  militants was continuing at the \nPalestinian refugee camp, with the army taking on more of an offensive stance.  In fact, reports suggested that \nLebanese forces took up positions just outside the camp and were shelling at the compound.\n\nThe offensive move came after many of the remaining residents fled the camp and two soldiers were shot by \nsnipers at the edge of the compound.\n\nLebanese officials denied that the relentless shelling was a final assault aimed at flushing out or killing the militants.\n\nNote: Since the start of the conflict, more than 85 soldiers, 60 militants and 40 civilians were killed.  \n\nOther Developments in 2007\n\nMeanwhile, on June 13, 2007, an explosion in Beirut's waterfront left eight people dead, including anti-Syrian \nparliamentarian Walid Eido, and at least 10 people injured.  The attack was the latest in a spate of blasts plaguing \n\n\n\nLebanon in the spring of 2007, and Eido was the most recent victim in a series of  assassinations in the last few \nyears involving high profile anti-Syrian individuals.  Eido was a member of Future Movement, and a political ally of \nSaad Hariri, the son of Lebanon's former head of government. \n\nThe timing of the attack was regarded as significant since it came two weeks after a decision by the United Nations \nSecurity Council to establish a tribunal to prosecute suspects in the assassination of former Lebanese Prime \nMinister Rafik Hariri.\n\nThroughout, there has been suspicion about Syrian involvement in the Hariri's assassination as well as the \nsubsequent attacks on political opponents in Lebanon.  For its part, Syria has dismissed such accusations.\n\nIn the third week of June 2007, even as the Lebanese army continued to battle with militants from Fatah Islam at \nthe Nahr-al-Bared Palestinian refugee camp, the country continued to be plagued by violence.  Less than two \nweeks after the assassination of another leading anti-Syrian figure in the country, parliamentarian Walid Eido \n(discussed just above), six United Nations (U.N.) peacekeepers were killed when their vehicle was hit by an \nexplosive device.\n\nThe peacekeepers were functioning under the aegis of Spanish forces. The attack took place between the towns of \nKhiyam and Marjeyoun, close to the border with Israel, in  a zone that has been part of the U.N. operation in \nLebanon since 1978.  (Note: In 2006, the U.N. operation in Lebanon was intensified following the Hezbollah-Israel \nconflict.)\n\nThere was no claim of responsibility although the Spanish Defense Minister, Jose Antonio Alonso, stated that it was \na \"premeditated attack,\" noting also that his government was \"working on the theory of a terrorist attack.\"  Indeed, \nextremists groups in Lebanon have made threats against U.N. peacekeepers in the past.  Most notably, some of the \nmilitants of Fatah Islam who were arrested and interrogated since the start of the aforementioned conflict at Nahr-\nal-Bared, admitted to a plot to attack the U.N.\n\nOn Aug. 5, 2007, tens of thousands of Lebanese voters went to the polls to cast ballots in key by-elections.  Turnout \nwas reported to have been high and Prime Minister Fouad Siniora said that voting took place in an orderly manner.  \nThere was no deadly violence reported on election day, presumably as a result of tight security at polling stations.\n\nAt stake were the two vacant seats previously held by two assassinated parliamentarians, both of whom belonged \nto the anti-Syrian and Western-backed ruling coalition.  The elections would, thus, result in replacements for the \nseats held by Sunni Muslim parliamentarian, Walid Eido, who had been assassinated in a car bomb in Beirut in \nJune 2007 as noted above, and Christian cabinet minister, Pierre Gemayel, who was gunned down in November \n2006, as aforementioned. Both deaths were a result of the spate of murders and violent attacks that have plagued \nLebanon since the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri who had been a harsh and vociferous critic of \nSyrian involvement in Lebanese affairs.  \n\nNow, two years later, Lebanon was deeply divided on sectarian grounds between Shi'ite Muslims, Sunni Muslims \nand Maronite Christians (its Jewish population having long since dwindled).  Lebanon was also politically \nfragmented between pro-Syrian and pro-Hezbollah factions on one end of the equation, and anti-Syrian,  \nnationalist, and pro-Western enclaves, on the other end.  In many ways, the fractures that characterized Lebanon's \ncivil war were resurfacing, most especially in the form of renewed violence, power struggles, strategic machinations, \nand political tensions.\n\nThe by-elections were thus imbued with grave symbolic significance, irrespective of the fact that they did not have \nthe approval of either President Emile Lahoud or recognition of the parliamentary speaker, Nabih Berri.  Both \n\n\n\nLahoud and Berri were aligned with Hezbollah-led opposition in parliament, which had been calling for the \nresignation of Fouad Siniora's government since late 2006.\n\nIn the period leading up to the 2007 by-elections, Eido's seat in western Beirut was expected to be won by the pro-\ngovernment candidate, Mohammed Amin Itani. With the votes counted, it appeared that projections for a victory by \nItani were on target with the pro-government Sunni politician winning by a substantial margin.\n\nGemayel's seat in the Maronite Christian stronghold of Metn was another matter, largely because of the divided \nnature of the population base.  Amin Gemayel, the father of the murdered cabinet minister, was contesting the \nelection and hoping to replace his son.  A former president and Phalange Party leader, Gemayel, was regarded as \na strong contender.  However, the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM), was hoping that its candidate, Camile Khoury, \nwould win the seat.  Supporters of the two parties were reported to have been embroiled in clashes with one \nanother, which ended only after the army intervened.  While the situation was calm in Metn as voters cast their \nballots, there were allegations of voting irregularities. Then, prior to the announcement of the election result, \nGemayel called for a re-run of the vote in a particular district.  Nevertheless, once the votes were counted, it \nappeared that Khoury had won a slim victory.\n\nThe race was regarded as a precursor to the upcoming presidential election for a successor to pro-Syrian President \nEmile Lahoud.  This was because Gemayel was viewed as a possible (albeit unconfirmed) candidate  for the \ncountry's leadership position against former military chief and FPM leader, Micheal Aoun.  While Phalange has \nbeen an establishment of sorts within the Maronite Christian community, FPM had never been regarded as a bitter \nrival until the last year.\n\nIn 2006, Aoun of FPM, who had once been a strong critic of Syrian involvement in Lebanese affairs, became \nincreasingly allied with the extremist group, Hezbollah, which has itself been tied to Syria.  There was some \nspeculation that Aoun crafted his alliance with Hezbollah strategically, for the purpose of advancing his presidential \nambitions.  Regardless of the motivation, his efforts were successful because Hezbollah indicated that Aoun was its \npreferred candidate in the impending presidential contest.\n\nClearly with Aoun aligned with Hezbollah and other pro-Syrian forces in Lebanon, and with Gemayel and his \nallies being strong advocates of the pro-Western and anti-Syrian orientation of the ruling coalition, there was a clear \nchoice before the voters in the by-election, and also in the presidential election later in 2007, regarding the path to \nbe charted by the Lebanese people.  To this end, Gemayel said, \"Lebanon is at a crossroad. The people have to \nmake a choice whether they want an independent and democratic Lebanon, or whether they want to vote for the \nopposition and a country ruled by Syria.\"\n\nOn Sept. 19, 2007, another anti-Syrian parliamentarian was assassinated in an apparent car bombing that took \nplace in the Lebanese capital.  Antoine Ghanim, a member of the Maronite Christian party known as Phalange, was \nkilled when his car exploded in the mainly Christian district of  Sin al-Fil  in Beirut.  Ghanim was an attorney who \nwas first elected to parliament in 2000 and re-elected in 2005. Several other people were killed as well in the attack, \nwhich also caused serious injuries to even more victims, as well as damage to nearby cars and buildings.\n\nThe Lebanese government expressed its sorrow over Ghanim's death while governments across the world, as well \nas regional and international groups, conveyed both sympathy and outrage over the turn of events.  As the country \nmourned Ghanim, government offices, banking institutions, schools and universities were closed.  A funeral was \nexpected to be held within days.\n\nGhanim's killing came months after the murder of Walid Eido, less than a year after the death of Pierre Gemayel, \nthe son of the one of the leaders of the  Phalange Party  [Amin Gemayel], and more than two years after the \nassassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.  Since the killing of Hariri, which gave rise to the Cedar \nRevolution (referenced above),  several political assassinations have ensued in Lebanon.  All the victims have \nbeen high-profile figures with anti-Syrian stances. \n\n\n\nThere have been allegations that Syria has been behind the political killings, presumably as a result of its declining \npower and influence upon -- and within \u2013 Lebanon in recent years.  While an investigation by the United Nations \nsuggested that Syria, indeed, played a role in Hariri's assassination, the government of Syria in Damascus has \nsteadfastly denied any role in the wave of killings.  Nevertheless, pro-Western interests both inside Lebanon and \ninternationally have noted that the latest assassination fit the pattern of past assassinations in Lebanon.\n\nGhanim's death had political implications on two levels.  In broad scope, it was the latest manifestation of political \nviolence rocking Lebanon, destabilizing the Siniora government, and ripping away the democratic foundations that \nwere beginning to take shape in the last decade after a long period of civil war.  In the immediate future, Ghanim's \ndeath had the practical effect of reducing the governing bloc's majority in parliament to only two seats, thus \nstrengthening the position of pro-Syrian elements, such as Hezbollah, in parliament.\n\nThe Lebanese parliament, or National Assembly, was made up of a slight majority of modern, anti-Syrian, and pro-\nWestern factions, as noted above.  However, the pro-Syrian factions, such as Hezbollah, have also held a great \ndeal of political power.  Much of that power had been consolidated after the war between Israel and Hezbollah on \nLebanese terrain in 2006.  Since that time, Hezbollah had been demanding a greater say in the governing realm.\n\nIn fact, the year 2007 had seen Lebanon become increasingly mired in an ongoing political crisis between the two \nsides  in parliament.\n\nThe parliamentary breakdown and climate of relations were of significant relevance, given the fact that Lebanese \nparliamentarians were set to vote on the country's new president.  The winner of this vote within parliament would \nsucceed outgoing pro-Syrian President Emile Lahoud.\n\nAll candidates for the post of head of state were Maronite Christian*, in accordance with existing political \nprovisions.\n\n(*Note: In accordance with the 1943 National Pact, the president is supposed to be a Maronite Christian, the prime \nminister is to be a Sunni Muslim, and the parliamentary speaker is to be a Shi'a Muslim. This means that Lebanon's \npresident is the only non-Muslim head of state in the Arab world amidst a system of pluralistic religious \nrepresentation.)\n\nIn the wake of the assassination of Ghanim, there were prevailing questions as to whether or not the vote on the \npresidency would go forward as planned.  But only days after Ghanim's death, Lebanon's government said the \nelection would indeed take place.  Prime Minister Fuad Siniora made a point of noting that those responsible for the \nassassination of Ghanim should not be allowed to succeed in their objectives to undermine the democratic process \nand to silence the people.  To these ends, the Lebanese head of government said, \"The hand of terror will not win \nand will not succeed in subduing us and silencing us.\"  He also called for a United Nations inquiry into the \nassassination.  \n\nOn Sept. 25, 2007,  the situation changed when the Lebanese parliament adjourned its session intended elect the \ncountry's new president and, instead, set a new date of Oct. 23, 2007, to do so.  The decision was made due to the \nabsence of pro-Syrian opposition members at the session.  As such, there were insufficient parliamentarians \npresent to form the two-thirds quorum, effectively making a vote impossible.  While  Lebanon's leadership contest \nremained unresolved, there was some hope that the delayed vote would provide additional time to, perhaps, consult \nacross party lines and reach agreement on a consensus candidate.\n\nApart from the aforementioned candidate, Michael Aoun, who was supported by Hezbollah, others contesting the \nelection included the following:\n\n\n\npro-government candidate and industrialist Nassib Lahoud, pro-government parliamentarian and former cabinet \nminister Boutous Harb, former Foreign Minister Jean Obeid, Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh, and former \nArmy Commander Michel Suleiman.  Obeid was rapidly being viewed as a consensus candidate, while Salameh's \npositive domestic and international reputation was regarded as a strong asset.  Suleiman's prospects appeared \nweak since a constitutional amendment would have to be passed to allow him to become president.\n\nMonths later, there was no sign of a successor to President Lahoud.  In fact, the highly anticipated presidential \nelection  was postponed until Nov. 21, 2007.  Parliamentary speaker, Nabih Berri, said that more time was needed \nto settle on a compromise candidate who would be acceptable to the Western-backed government of Lebanon as \nwell as the Syrian-supported opposition.  That date was again postponed until Nov. 23, 2007, due to the failure to \nagree on a compromise candidate even with the assistance of international mediators.\n\nIf no successor to Lahoud was selected by Nov. 24, 2007, when the outgoing president was scheduled to step \ndown from office, interim leadership would be named.  Indeed, that deadline approached and passed with no \nselection of a successor.  The vote, in fact, was unable to take place since the pro-Syrian opposition would not \nallow a quorum to be formed.  Instead, a new vote was scheduled for Nov. 30, 2007.\n\nIn the interim, as Lahoud left the presidential palace, he instructed the army to take presidential control.  To that \nend, Lahoud issued a statement noting that the army would take on responsibility for ensuring that stability and \norder was maintained.  For his part, however, army chief General Michel Suleiman refrained from comment, \nprefering to present the military as a neutral entity.  But Lahoud's declaration was not accepted as fact.  Pro-\nWestern Prime Minister Siniora forthrightly rejected the position that the army was in charge saying that he and his \ncabinet held temporary power in keeping with constitutional provisions.\n\nIn the background of these developments, there have been grave anxieties about a power vacuum, constitutional \ncrisis and civil unrest if the political impasse is not ultimately resolved.\n\nIncreasingly unstable Lebanon sunk deeper into a vortex of chaos in mid-December 2007 when one of the country's \ntop generals, General Francois al-Hajj, was assassinated in a car bombing.  The attack, which also killed two other \nindividuals including Hajj's bodyguard, took place in the Christian enclave of Baabda, located near to the \npresidential palace in the capital city of Beirut.  The location of the attack had, until this time, been regarded as a \nhighly secure area.\n\nGeneral Hajj, who had been the Lebanese army's chief of operations, was rumored to be in line for the position of \narmy chief, if the current army chief, General Michel Suleiman, was chosen to become the country's new \npresident.  Since Emile Lahoud's rule as president ended in late November 2007, the country had been in a state of \npolitical crisis with no resolution between the pro-Western ruling government and pro-Syrian/pro-Hezbollah \nopposition factions in parliament.  Both sides were unable to agree on a successor to Lahoud for several months, \nand as such, the power vacuum has loomed large.\n\nOnly by December 2007 did the two sides agree on Suleiman being a consensus candidate, however, their \ndissonance prevailed as there was no agreement on how to amend the constitution to allow a senior civil servant to \nbe elected to the presidency.  As well, no concurrence could be reached on the government, which the opposition \nrefused to recognize.\n\nHajj's untimely death was another one in a long line of political assassinations in Lebanon since 2005 when former \nPrime Minister Rafiq Hariri was murdered.  The assassinations of Hariri and a number of anti-Syrian public figures \nhave long since been blamed on Syria.  As such, it was not surprising that some pro-Western voices placed the \n\n\n\nblame for Hajj's assassination on Syria once again.  To that end, Lebanese telecommunications minister Marwan \nHamadeh accused the \"Syrian-Iranian axis\" of targeting the Lebanese military because it was the only entity that \ncould \"balance the power of Hezbollah and other militias in the country.\"  However that charge was somewhat \ntempered by the fact that both Syrian-backed Hezbollah and Hezbollah-backed Christian politician Michel Aoun \nboth condemned Hajj's murder.  Indeed Aoun said that he backed the idea of Hajj succeeding Suleiman as army \nchief.\n\nAttention then turned to other motivations.  Because of Hajj's involvement as chief of operations in the fight against \nIslamic militants at the  Palestinian Nahr al-Bared refugee camp earlier in the year, there was some belief that his \nassassination was a revenge killing.  However, the location of the attack, as noted above, would have required \nmilitants to have had access to high level logistical intelligence, thus casting some doubt about that particular \ntheory.\n\nRegardless of who was responsible for Hajj's assassination, such action was unprecedented.  To date, the \nLebanese military has been viewed as a unifying force in this fragmented country, and senior military officials have \nnot been targeted in assassination attacks.  Hajj's death, thusly, could be regarded as an omen of further political \nconflict on the horizon for Lebanon.\n\nDevelopments in Early 2008\n\nThe ongoing political crisis that had gripped Lebanon for months over the choice of president was extended once \nagain by the start of 2008.  The presidential election, which had already been postponed approximately a dozen \ntimes due to political dissonance on the matter, was delayed again until Feb. 11, 2008.  Attempts to mediate a \nsolution by the Arab League had yielded little success.  Amr Moussa of the Arab League met with the Lebanese \nparliament to advocate a plan that would result in the election of Suleiman as president, the formation of a national \nunity government and the passage of a a new electoral law.\n\nOn Jan. 25, 2008, a powerful bomb blast in the Lebanese capital of Beirut rocked the city and resulted in the deaths \nof several people.  Included in the death toll was Wissam Eid  -- a senior  intelligence officer.  Close to forty others \nwere injured in the bomb blast.\n\nWissam Eid  had been carrying out an investigation of the attacks  against notable anti-Syrian political and media \nfigures that had plagued Lebanon since 2004 and left the country in a state of instability.\n\nIt was thus believed that  Wissam Eid was the clear target of the attack, coming on the heels of the late 2007 high \nprofile assassination of a top general.  To that end, the Internal Security Forces chief, Ashraf Rifi said, \"This is a \nmessage to the Internal Security Forces, following the message sent to the army in December when General \nFrancois el-Hajj was killed in a car bomb.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Saad Hariri --  the country's majority leader in parliament and son of the assassinated former head of \ngovernment -- implicated Syria in the attack and demanded that the neighboring country cease its interference into \nLebanese affairs.\n\nFor its part, as it has before, Damascus, denied any involvement.\n\nRecent Developments: Doha Agreement and Presidential Election\n\nIn the first part of 2008, attention turned to the prospect of the impending presidential election. The indirect \npresidential election in Lebanon had been delayed over and over several times, with new dates put forth on a \nsuccessive basis.\n\n\n\nThe main presidential candidates, listed in brief above,  are discussed more fully following --\n\nOne of the strongest candidates has been Michel Suleiman, the chief of the Lebanese armed forces.  Suleiman is a \nhighly decorated official and he is positively seen by both sides of the Lebanese debate as the best option for the \nnext president.  He has been functioning in a leadership role since President Emile Lahoud left office and the \npresidency has remained vacant.\n\nNassib Lahoud is a member of the Democratic Renewal Movement, which is anti-Syrian.  This movement gained \nmomentum in opposition to the pro-Syrian former president (Emile Lahoud).  He believes that Lebanon must put an \nend to Syrian intrusion in their affairs.\n\nMichael Aoun is a highly controversial candidate for the presidency.  Having served as a Prime Minister to one of \nthe governing bodies in Lebanon imposed by former President Amine Gemayel, Aoun's government was defeated \nby Syrian forces in 1990 and he was exiled.  After his return in 2005 and the exit of the Syrian forces, Aoun \nbecame a member of the Free Patriotic Movement that gained support in the 2005 elections and he, himself, was \nelected to the National Assembly in that same year.  Aoun has been criticized for his support of the 2006 \nMemorandum of Understanding with Hezbollah, though he criticized them openly during his exile.  He  is endorsed \nby Hezbollah.\n\nMichael Edde was chosen as a candidate by the head of the Lebanese Maronite Church (a sect that produces the \nmajority of Presidents chosen by the Parliament) as a candidate that most parties involved could agree upon.  He \nhas worked as a minister in Lebanon for upwards of 30 years.\n\nRiad Salameh is a very successful banker in Lebanon and is supported by the French.  He has maintained a stable \nmonetary policy, though his candidacy would require a constitutional amendment to allow him to take the position of \npresident.\n\nBoutros Harb is an anti-Syrian candidate for the presidency.  He has been an active protestor of the Hezbollah's \ninvolvement in the Lebanese government since the assassination of their Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri in 2004. He \ninsists upon national unity and wishes to work on mutual respect for sovereignty and independence with Syria.\n\nJean Obeid is a former Minister of Foreign Affairs and is seen as a consensus candidate, as he served as an \nadvisor to two former Lebanese presidents on the Syrian affairs.\n\nThe election was intended to bring an end to the impasse that had plagued the country since the departure of \nformer President Lahoud.  However, no election would take place unless the Western-backed government and \nHezbollah-allied opposition  could come to agreement on the backing of a consensus candidate.\n\nSeveral successive postponements marked the lack of consensus on the matter of the presidency.  However,  even \nwith emerging agreement over Michel Suleiman  as the consensus candiate, there remained no \nagreement regarding  a plan to pass a new electoral law, that would allow the army chief to take on the position of \nhead of state.\n\nTo that end, Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa was attempting to broker a three-point plan aimed at \nresolving the political dissonance between the opposition and the Western-backed government.  That plan called \nfor the election of Suleiman as president, the formation of a unity government with no group having the right to veto, \nas well as the passage of a new election law.  The main sticking point for the opposition bloc was the issue of veto \npower, which it demanded.  \n\n\n\nAt the core of the political dissonance in Lebanon was the very one keeping the country from securing a leader: \nthe relationship with Syria and the Hezbollah. Indeed, the conflict between the pro-Western government of Lebanon \nand the parliament (composed of opposed pro-Western and pro-Hezbollah factions) has kept the process from \nmoving forward since November 2007 when President Emile Lahoud left office. \n\nBy May 2008, even as Lebanon was once again delaying its presidential election due to lack of consensus among \nrival factions of parliament, a  violent conflict between Hezbollah and the Lebanese government was brewing.  \n\nThe violence, which resulted in scores of deaths in the streets of Beirut and beyond,  had been sparked when the \nleader of Hezbollah, characterized the government's decision to close its telecommunications network as a \n\"declaration of war.\"  The network had been deemed a threat to security.  Hassan Nasrallah also railed at the \ngovernment for firing  the chief of security at the Beirut airport, also on the basis of security concerns.  The \nHezbollah leader  thusly promised to \"cut off the hand\" trying to dismantle its operations. \n\nOn the other side of the equation, Saad Hariri, the leader of the pro-Western parliamentary majority, called for an \nend to the bloodshed saying, \"My appeal to you is to stop the language of arms.\" This call was not realized.  \nHezbollah had taken control over the airport and key transport arteries and attacked interests associated with the \ngovernment in Beirut.\n\nIn fact, the area was plagued by  several successive days of  bloodshed between Hezbollah and pro-government \nforces, reminiscent of the period in which the country had been plunged into a civil war. The Western-backed \ngovernment of Prime Minister Fuad Siniora said that an \"armed and bloody coup\" was taking place in his country.\n\nMeanwhile, the Lebanese military warned that the country's security would be at risk if the crisis went on, and it also \nsuggested that its neutral status could be compromised if it was forced to intervene to stop the violence.\n\nWhile there was a temporary lull in the violence on May 10 and 11, 2008, and even though Hezbollah withdrew \nsome of its fighters from the capital, fighting resumed again outside Beirut in the hills to the east of the capital.\n\nThe area was a stronghold of the Druze community and was emerging as the site of violent battles between pro-\nHezbollah forces and government supporters. The Druze community was fearful that without the deployment of \nmilitary troops in the area, Hezbollah would take control by force, as per Beirut. In order to prevent such an end in \nthe northern part of the country,  military troops were deployed to Tripoli to tamper down clashes between pro-\nHezbollah  forces and government supporters.  In the background of these developments, thousands of Lebanese \npeople were trying to flee regions of the country affected by the conflict.\n\nLater in May 2008, the Arab League  mediated talks in which a deal was forged to bring an end to the fighting. \nCentral to the agreement were provisions for electoral reform and the formation of a national unity cabinet.  Earlier, \nthe government had reversed its actions against Hezbollah regarding the telecommunications network and the \nsecurity chief.  As well, Hezbollah agreed to end its street blockades, re-open the airport and end its siege of \nBeirut. On May 18, 2008, rival political leaders from Lebanon were convening talks in Qatar,  aimed at putting the \npeace deal into action. However, the meeting was somewhat stymied by differing views on  Hezbollah's possession \nof vast stores of weapons.\n\nBy May 21, 2008,  Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad  bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani of Qatar announced in Doha (Qatar) \nthat rival Lebanese factions had agreed  on a plan to resolve the political crisis.  Central to the Doha Agreement \nwas the provision for the formation of a unity government according to the \"16-11-3 formula.\" To this end, the \nWestern-backed ruling majority would hold 16 cabinet seats and would have the right to select the prime minister, \nwhile the Syrian/Hezbollah-backed opposition would hold 11 cabinet seats and have veto power.  The president \nwould have the right to nominate options for three cabinet seats.  Another core component of the Doha Agreement \nwas  the election of a new president within 24 hours, which would  itself bring an end to the ongoing political \n\n\n\nstandoff in Lebanon.  Other provisions were included, such as electoral reform, the prohibition of the use of \nweaponry in internal conflict, and the removal of protests camps in central Beirut.  The weapons ban and closure of \nthe protest camps were intended to prevent Lebanon from spiraling into a state of violent civil unrest.\n\nThe first tangible sign that the Doha Agreement was clearly activated came when Army Commander Michel \nSuleiman was elected by parliament and became Lebanon's new president.  The indirect vote gave Suleiman  118 \nvotes out of 127.  In his first official address to Lebanon's parliament, President Michel Suleiman urged national \nreconciliation saying,  \"Let us unite... and work towards a solid reconciliation... we have paid dearly for our national \nunity, let us preserve it hand-in-hand.\"\n\nThis rallying call did not ignore the recent dark events, as he also noted that the country was \"starting to wake up \nfrom self-destruction.\"  The new head of state additionally called for\n\n\"quiet dialogue\" on the most contentious issues facing Lebanon, such as Hezbollah's role as an armed  resistance \nmovement.  Suleiman also addressed the thorny matter of the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister \nRafik Hariri by saying the country should cooperate with the United Nations in bringing those responsible to justice.\n\nThe biggest test facing Lebanon now was the formation of the new unity government.  Until that government could \nbe formed, outgoing Prime Minister Fuad Siniora would lead the  caretaker government.\n\nIn late May 2008, Siniora was nominated to reprise his role as prime minister under the provisions of the Doha \nAgreement.  The only other name being considered for the post was that of the son of former Prime Minister Hariri, \nwho had been assassinated years prior.  Newly-elected President Suleiman was expected to be presented with the \nnews that Siniora had been selected for the role of head of government, and the process of government formation \nwould then commence. \n\nIn July 2008, in the wake of the concurrence reached in the Doha Agreement, Lebanese political leaders agreed to \nform a national unity government, in accordance with the  \"16-11-3 formula\" noted above.  With the government to \nbe formed, it was expected that Fuad Siniora (at the time, functioning as the caretaker head of government) would \ncontinue on as prime minister and head of government, albeit with a very divided cabinet.  Addressing this fact, \nSiniora said, \"Our differences will not be resolved overnight, but we have decided to resolve them through \ninstitutions and dialogue rather than in the streets.\"\n\nOn July 11, 2008, Lebanon finally formed a 30-member national unity government after several weeks of difficult \nnegotiations. Indeed, the fractious period was marked by contentious debate among political power brokers and \nviolent clashes in the streets of Beirut among supporters of the two rival sides.  The new cabinet was composed of \n16 ministers of the Western-backed ruling majority, 11 allied with the Shiite Hezbollah-led opposition, and the rest \nthree named by President Michel Suleiman.\n\nWith the new government set to take office,  Prime Minister Siniora was faced with a plethora of challenges.  Chief \namong these challenges was the task of unifying the rival factions in the cabinet.  Prime Minister Siniora remarked \non some of the objectives of this new cabinet saying,  \"This government has two main tasks: regaining confidence \nin the Lebanese political system... and securing the holding of transparent parliamentary elections.\n\nIn early August 2008, the Lebanese parliamentary speaker, Nabih Berri, called parliament to discuss a possible \nconfidence vote for the newly-established unity government.  The vote would make clear whether the uneasy \ncoalition of unlikely partners -- pro-Western factions and pro-Hezbollah factions-- would be able to maintain \nfunctioning viability in parliament.  That vote passed off successfully reifying the new unity government's authority \nand influence in parliament.\n\n\n\nOther Recent Developments\n\nMeanwhile, in late July 2008 saw sectarian violence break out in Lebanon as rival factions of Alawi and Sunni \nMuslims clashed in the northern city of Tripoli.  Sniper fire and rocket-propelled grenades were reported to have \nbeen used by the two sides.  Officials said that at least five people died as a result of this bout of violence, however, \na number of deaths and injuries had already taken place earlier in the month as a result of the factional fighting. The \nclashes occurred in the wake of the formation of a unity government and appeared to have been sparked by \ndifferences over militia weaponry and disarmament.\n\nOn Aug. 13, 2008, a bomb explosion  in the Lebanese port city of Tripoli killed between 10 and 20  people and \nwounded more than 30 others.  According to the Lebanese military, the bomb exploded  in proximity of a bus \ncarrying several off-duty soldiers and some of those troops were among the dead.\n\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility, however, the city had been the site of sectarian fighting between \nthe dominant Sunni community, which supports the pro-Western forces of government,  and the Alawaite \ncommunity, with its Shi'a roots and connection to pro-Syrian Hezbollah. This particular  attack occurred one day \nafter the new government of national unity won a key confidence vote and just as newly-elected President Michel \nSuleiman was set to visit Syria.  As such, there was speculation that the attack was intended to upset reconciliatory \nmovement both at home and abroad between typically-conflicted pro-Western and pro-Syrian factions.\n\nFor his part, President Suleiman described the explosion as \"a terrorist act\" and promised that the country's military \nwould not stand for such action.  In a statement, he said, \"The army and security forces will not be terrorized by \nattacks and crimes that target it and civil society, and the history of the army attests to that.\"\n\nUpdate:\n\nOctober 2008 saw Syrian President Bashar al-Assad initiate plans to forge diplomatic relations with Lebanon for the \nfirst time in decades.  Indeed, the two Arab countries have been at odds with one another since gaining \nindependence from France in the 1940s.  The plans, which have been backed by France, includes the \nestablishment of a Syrian embassy in the Lebanese capital of Beirut.  The move would be a symbolic \nacknowledgment of Lebanese sovereignty after decades of what many have viewed as Syrian inteference in \nLebanese affairs.\n\nOn the other side of the equation,  Lebanese Foreign Minister Fawzi Salloukh said that he would travel to the Syrian \ncapital of Damascus to commence establishing ties with his Syrian counterpart ,Walid al-Moualem.  That would \nconstitute the first step in the diplomatic process, ultimately aimed at the exchange of ambassadors by the close of \n2009. \n\nIn March 2009, there was a stall on the proceedings of the special tribunal, established by the United \nNations at The Hague, to try those individuals believed to be responsible for the assassination of former Prime \nMinister Rafiq Hariri.  At issue were the upcoming general elections.  The court decided to halt its call to transfer \nfour generals held in connection with Hariri's assassination until after the elections in June 2009.\n\nMeanwhile in January 2009, the  Lebanese Interior Ministry issued a decree calling for the  parliamentary elections \nto take place in June 2009. The parliamentary elections were to take place according to the 1960 election law, as \nurged by the opposition, and signed by Lebanese rival leaders in Doha  in 2008 as a way of ending the prevailing \npolitical power struggle between pro-Western and pro-Hezbollah factions in government.\n\n\n\nOn the issue of the elections scheduled for June 2009, President Michel Suleiman vowed in March 2009 to hold the \ngeneral elections on time, saying in the An-Nahar daily publication that elections are \"democratic means of \ncompetition.\"\n\nHe went on to note,  \"The elections represent one step in the political life, and not the end of the road.\"\n\nAt stake was representation in the 128-seat parliament, which according to Lebanon's power-sharing system, \ndivides seat allocation along sectarian and communal lines.  In effect, that means that there were 64 seats for \nMuslims and 64 seats for Christians.  The two main factions contesting the elections were as follows--\n\n-The pro-Western \"14 March Coalition,\" made up of Future movement, Progressive Socialist Party, Christian \nLebanese Forces and Christian Phalangist party.\n\n-The Hezbollah-led bloc, composed of  Hezbollah, Amal movement of Speaker Nabih Birri, and Free Patriotic \nMovement of Michel Aoun.\n\nLebanese voters finally went to the polls on June 7, 2009 to cast their ballots and, in so doing, select members of \nparliament. Turnout was said to be high at close to 55 percent -- the highest level of voter participation since the \n1975-91 civil war.  Former United States President Jimmy Carter led a team of international monitors who \nconcluded that the voting took place in a free and fair manner.\n\nAt issue in the election was the ongoing power struggle between the Lebanon's governing pro-Western coalition \nand the Hezbollah-led bloc on the other side of the equation.  The two sides have been deadlocked in a political \nbattle for supremacy for several years.  But with the votes counted, it was clear that the ruling pro-Western coalition \nwould retain its majority in the 128-member parliament.  The actual official results indicated that the pro-Western \ncoalition won 71 seats and the Hezbollah bloc secured 57 seats.  With these results  confirmed, the pro-Western \ncoalition actually increased its parliamentary representation and consolidated its political power.\n\nSaad Hariri-- the leader of the pro-Western coalition and the son of assassinated anti-Syrian politician Rafiq Hariri  -\n-  claimed victory. In a speech before jubilant supporters, Hariri said, \"Congratulations to you, congratulations to \nfreedom, congratulations to democracy.\"  He continued, \"There is no winner and loser in these elections, the only \nwinner is democracy and Lebanon.\"  On the other side of the equation, the Hezbollah-led bloc was reported to have \nconceded defeat.\n\nHezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said:  \"I would like to congratulate all those who won, those in the majority and \nthose in the opposition.\"\n\nWestern countries, such as the United States, were likely relieved to hear the election results, which decisively \naverted the prospect of victory and increased political influence for the Hezbollah bloc.\n\nIn fact, United States President Barack Obama reportedly, \"It is our sincere hope that the next government will \ncontinue along the path towards building a sovereign, independent and stable Lebanon.\"\n\nFresh on the heels of election victory, Lebanese majority leader Saad Hariri said in an interview with Italian media \nthat he was ready to lead a new government.  On Italy's Italian TV Rai Uno, Hariri said,  \"I did not have the \nexperience and was not ready after my father's assassination to take office, but now after four years I do not fear \ntaking this position.\" \n\nOf course, Saad Hariri was  referring to his father, former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, who was \nassassinated in a car bomb in Beirut on Feb.14, 2005. Saad Hariri became the leader of the coalition that won \n\n\n\nelection in what came to be known as the \"Cedar Revolution\" just after his father's assassination.  However, the \nyounger Hariri did not lead the government, instead leaving that task to  Prime Minister Fouad Seniora.  Going \nforward, though, Hariri was indicating that he had effectively earned the right to head the new incoming \ngovernment. \n\nStriking an assertive tone, Hariri said, \"We are keen on doing what the Lebanese want and not what the United \nStates, Europe or Israel want.\"  He also said that the new government would be fully representative  and that his \nhands were outstretched to political opponents \"for the interest of Lebanon.\"  This statement was viewed as a \nveiled hint toward the Shi'ite militant group, Hezbollah, especially as he made clear that his government would solve \nits problems via dialogue and not with violence.\n\nOn June 27, 2009, Lebanese President Michel Suleiman announced that Hariri would be the country's new prime \nminister. In this way, the younger Hariri would take on the role once held by his late father.  Prime Minister-\ndesignate Hariri was tasked with forming a new government, which he said would include  members of the \nopposition.  It was not known if the opposition membership in government would extend to Hezbollah. \n\nThat said, there was a sense that Lebanon was entering a period of stability after several years of insecurity and \nvolatility that came with Rafiq Hariri's assassination and continued well after the so-called Cedar Revolution, and \nreached its nadir during the war between Hezbollah and Israel.\n\nRelations with Israel came to the fore in September 2009 when two rockets were fired into northern Israel from \nLebanon; the explosions were reported in the Israeli city of Nahariya only six miles from the border with Lebanon. \nThe Israeli military responded by firing eight shells into a fruit plantation near the city of Tyre.  There were no \nreports of deaths or injuries as a result, although Israeli police said they did manage to find the remnants of a \nKatyusha rocket.\n\nUnited Nations peacekeepers in Lebanon urged both sides to exercise restraint in response to the situation. The \nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said that it was deploying extra troops and released the following \nstatement:  \"Unifil is in contact with both sides, urging them to exercise maximum restraint, uphold the cessations of \nhostilities and avoid taking steps which would lead to further escalation.\"\n\nUnifil was established in 1978 following Israel's incursion into Lebanon and was expanded after Israel's 2006 war \nwith the militant Islamic group, Hezbollah. That situation was spurred by a Hezbollah offensive from Lebanese \nterrain into Israel, in which two Israeli soldiers were seized at the onset. Israel retaliated and Lebanese citizens -- \nmore than 1,000 in total -- were killed in the crossfire of violence.  As well, about 160 Israelis, most of whom were \nsoldiers, also died in the war as a result of rocket fire and fighting. The border region maintained a sense of uneasy \ncalm since the end of the 2006, although there have been occasional flare ups of rocket fire and clashes between \nthe two sides.\n\nOn July 30, 2010, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Saudi King Abdullah were in Beirut for landmark talks with \nLebanese President Michel Suleiman. The meeting was significant largely because of the complicated relationship \nbetween Lebanon and Syria through the years, which translated into a complex political terrain in Lebanon defined \nby pro-Syrian/Hezbollah-backed factions at odds with anti-Syrian/pro-reform factions, who have had tenuous control \nof the government. Those tensions reached a nadir years ago as discussed in the \"Editor's Note\" below and have \nfunctioned as the main dynamics of the Lebanese political sphere. Now tensions were on the rise once again.\n\nAt issue was the possible indictment of members of Hezbollah by a United Nations tribunal investigating the \nassassination of vocal anti-Syrian former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. As noted below in the \"Editor's Note,\" Hariri's \nmurder marked a turning point in Lebanon's modern history, functioning as a harbinger for the Cedar Revolution \nthat forced the Syrian military from Lebanon after a 30-year long presence there. Despite its tragic roots, the Cedar \n\n\n\nRevolution was a political victory for pro-Western and reformist forces in Lebanon, and concomitantly enflamed \nthe passions of pro-Syrian elements in the country, many of whom were allied with Hezbollah and sought to assert \ntheir authority in Lebanon. Now, in mid-2010, the possible indictment of members of Hezbollah in Hariri's \nassassination, in many ways, re-opened the wounds of that period.\n\nStill, years after Syrian forces were compelled to exit Lebanon, Syrian President al-Assad was in Lebanon for his \nfirst visit since that fateful period. While some Lebanese would likely interpret the visit as a sign of progress \nbetween the two neighboring countries, others could well view it as a rallying cry for renewed hostility between pro-\nSyrian and anti-Syrian factions. But the presence of Saudi King Abdullah on the scene underlined the imperative for \nregional powers to work in lockstep for Middle Eastern stability. To this end, both the leaders of Syria and Saudi \nArabia appealed for calm during unprecedented talks in Lebanon and urged that country's rival factions to refrain \nfrom violence despite the politics of the moment. Moreover, with al-Assad and King Abdullah saying that resolution \nshould be reached through \"legal institutions,\" there was a message of unity and a tacit endorsement of the United \nNations tribunal process.\n\nOn Aug. 3, 2010, Lebanese and Israeli soldiers have exchanged fire along their shared border. There were \ncompeting claims as to what spurred the incident. Lebanese officials claimed that it started firing only after warning \nIsraeli soldiers not to uproot a tree impeding their view on the Lebanese side of the border; they said that Israeli \ntroops responded with artillery fire. Lebanese authorities also accused Israeli troops of crossing the border into \nLebanon and said that three of their soldiers and a journalist had been killed in the fracas. Lebanese Prime Minister \nSaad Hariri criticized Israel for its \"aggression.\" For its part, Israel said that it also had casualties with two of its \nsoldiers being shot in the border zone; Israel also denied ever encroaching on Lebanese territory. Indeed, Israel \nsaid that its armed forces were on the Israeli side of the internationally-sanctioned \"blue line\" separating the two \ncountries, carrying out routine operations, when they were warned to withdraw from the area. The Israeli Defense \nForces said that individuals in Lebanese army uniforms then opened fire on them.\n\nIt was the most serious diplomatic imbroglio between Israel and Lebanon since the 2006 conflict between Israel and \nthe Lebanon-based militant extremist organization, Hezbollah. Perhaps not surprisingly, United Nations \npeacekeeping forces stationed in southern Lebanon called on both sides to exercise \"maximum restraint\" at a time \nof heightened tensions.\n\nSpecial Entry\n\nWestern political bloc refuses to join new Lebanese government and calls for new \"Cedar Revolution\"\n\nBackground --\n\nOn Jan. 12, 2011, the government of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri collapsed when members of the \nHezbollah faction and its allies resigned from the cabinet. In fact, ten of the prime minister's 30 cabinet ministers \nwithdrew from unity government while Saad Hariri was in the United States for talks with President Barack Obama.\n\nAt issue for the members of the Hezbollah faction was a United Nations-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon, \nwhich has been investigating the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri -- the father of the current \nPrime Minister Hariri. Indications suggested that the United Nations-backed tribunal was going to indict members of \nHezbollah for Rafik Hariri's assassination, even handing over supporting documents to a pre-trial judge. For its part, \nHezbollah wanted the government to convene an emergency session aimed at opposing the tribunal. Hezbollah has \nfurther characterized the tribunal as a joint Israeli-United States project intended to discredit the extremist Shi'ite \nanti-Israel entity.\n\nGebran Bassil, the country's energy minister for the opposition March 8 alliance, read a statement on behalf of \nopposition ministers. He said on Hezbollah's al-Manar news service: \"Following our last bid to resolve matters \nthrough our call for an immediate cabinet session, and after our call was turned down by the other bloc, and in order \n\n\n\nto pave the way for the formation of a new government that would be able to assume its duties in the upcoming \nstage, we announce our resignation from the government.\"\n\nClearly, the resignations and collapse of the government meant that talks led by Syria, Turkey and Saudi Arabia \nintended to avert a political crisis had not ended successfully. Lebanon's cause of stability was not helped by the \nfact that Saudi Arabia decided to abandon its mediation efforts.\n\nNew government --\n\nNevertheless, attention would refocus on Lebanese President Michel Suleiman with an eye on forming a new \ncabinet. To that end, President Suleiman was expected to launch consultations with the various political factions. \nFor his part, Prime Minister Hariri -- now the head of a caretaker government -- was making the international rounds \nas he conducted talks in France and Turkey, aimed at shoring up support for a new government with him at the \nhelm. Hezbollah was hinting that it would not sanction a government headed by Hariri; however, Hariri was insisting \nthat he intended to hold onto his job.\n\nBut on Jan. 24, 2011, it was Najib Mikati, an American-educated businessman, who was nominated by Hezbollah \nfor the post of prime minister during talks with President Michel Suleiman. Mikati had served briefly as prime \nminister between April and July 2005 -- a period of heightened tensions following Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's \nassassination. Now, in 2011, Mikati won the backing of a bare majority in the Chamber of Deputies -- 65 of 128, \nthanks to support from Druze leader, Walid Jumblatt, and six members of his Progressive Socialist Party, who \nswung the vote in the direction of Mikati and away from Hariri.\n\nHezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah suggested that if that group's candidate (Mikati) was appointed prime \nminister, efforts would be made to form another national unity government inclusive of Hariri's Western-backed \nFuture Movement. Caretaker Prime Minister Hariri was quick to dismiss such a move, making clear he would not \nserve in a government chosen by the Iran-backed Hezbollah, and issuing a statement that read as follows: \"The \nFuture Movement... rejects taking part in any government headed by an 8 March candidate.\" [Note that March 8 \nrefers to the coalition that includes Hezbollah, the Shi'a Amal movement, and the bloc of the Maronite Christian \nleader, Michel Aoun.] Supporters of Hariri and his Future Movement took to the streets in angry protests across the \ncountry. President Suleiman was hoping to act as peacemaker, saying in an interview with the media, \"We are all \none hand for the sake of Lebanon.\"\n\nIn the backdrop of these developments was the ongoing power struggle between Hezbollah and the Western-\nbacked pro Hariri factions. For its part, Hezbollah's supporters were taking to the streets to carry out \ndemonstrations, presumably aimed at showing the group's political influence in Lebanon. Opponents said that \nHezbollah was trying to intimidate the Lebanese populace. At the same time, Hariri's Future Movement \nparliamentary block and their Western-backed March 14 Alliance were accusing Hezbollah and its allies of trying to \nturn Lebanon into \"an Iranian base.\" The dissonance was contributing to fears of a resumption civil war in Lebanon. \nSuch anxieties reached new heights on Jan. 25, 2011, when Mikati was officially appointed to become the new \nprime minister, spurring further protests across Lebanon by Sunnis alarmed at the consolidation of Hezbollah's \npolitical power. For his part, former Prime Minister Saad Hariri praised fellow Lebanese who \"denounced the \nattempts of hegemony over our national citizens,\" but also expressly rejected violent forms of expression.\n\nAt the international level, the Obama administration of the United States said it had \"great concerns about a \ngovernment within which Hezbollah plays a leading role.\" Indeed, the United States has designated Hezbollah to be \na terrorist organization.\n\nMeanwhile, it should be noted that on Jan. 17, 2011, international prosecutors for the United Nations-backed \nSpecial Tribunal for Lebanon issued a sealed indictment for the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik \nHariri. It was expected, as noted above, that members of Hezbollah would be named in the indictment. Yet to be \nseen was the matter of whether or not a pre-trial judge would issue warrants. In Lebanon, assuming that Mikati \nwould indeed become prime minister, it was not known if he could cooperate with Special Tribunal for Lebanon.\n\nUpdate --\n\n\n\nOn Feb. 27, 2011, Lebanon's Western-backed March 14 Alliance made clear that it would not be joining the new \ngovernment of Prime Minister-designate Najib Mikati. The Western-backed political bloc said that Mikati was \nunwilling to give clear commitments relating to the aforementioned United Nations-backed tribunal investigating the \nassassination of the late Prime Minister Rafiq Harriri. The March 14 Alliance also accused Shi'ite militant extremist \ngroup Hezbollah of working with allies to carry out a coup aimed at bringing down the government of Saad Hariri. \nAccordingly, former Prime Minister Faoud Siniora, speaking on behalf of the bloc, issued the following statement: \n\"The March 14 forces refuse to legitimize this coup and will not stand silent in the face of violations being \ncommitted.\" Siniora continued, \"The March 14 camp will confront this coup through all means available in the \nframework of its commitment to the practice of democracy.\"\n\nBy mid-March 2011, tens of thousands of Lebanese were taking to the streets in Beirut to demand the disarming of \nHezbollah, which was now the dominant force in government. The rallies ensued on the sixth anniversary of the \n\"Cedar Revolution,\" which swept Syrian forces from Lebanese soil after the assassination of former Prime Minister \nRafiq Hariri. On this occasion, former Prime Minister Siniora formally posed the questions asked by many of \nLebanese at the rallies: \"Do you accept the formation of a government that imposes its weapons on its people? Do \nyou accept a government who would topple and stop the funding of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon?\" In answer to \nthat question, Siniora's Maronite Christian ally, Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea, said: \"I am announcing \ntoday with you this is the second Cedar Revolution that will not stop until the end of the (Hezbollah) ministate.\"\n\nSee below under \"Update\" for details related to the development of a new Hezbollah-dominated government in \nJune 2011, and the geopolitical challenges emerging as a result.\n\n2011 Update\n\nOn May 27, 2011, a bomb hit a United Nations convoy in Lebanon, injuring at least six Italian peacemakers.  The \nbomb exploded close to the coastal city of Sidon.  According to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon \n(Unifil*), the bomb appeared to have been aimed at a logistics convoy.  Lebanese Prime Minister-designate Najib \nMikati condemned the attack but there was no immediate indication of who might be responsible.\n\n*Note: Unifil operates in Lebanon with about 13,000 troops deployed to southern Lebanon. Its mission has been to  \nkeep the peace along the conflict-ridden border  with Israel.  First formed in 1978 when Israeli troops entered \nsouthern Lebanon, Unifil's mission was expanded in 2006 following the war between Israel and the Lebanese \nmilitant extremist Islamic group, Hezbollah.\n\nOn June 13, 2011,  Lebanon announced that it had finally formed a new government.  The announcement was \nmade following  meetings between  Lebanese President Michel Suleiman, House Speaker Nabih Berri, and Prime \nMinister-designate Najib Mikati, and occurred almost five months after the collapse of outgoing Prime Minister Saad \nHariri's government.\n\nIndeed, on Jan. 12, 2011, conflict between the Western-backed March 14 Alliance and the Iran and Syria-backed \nHezbollah bloc led to the unraveling of that unity government.  At issue  for the members of the Hezbollah faction  \nwas a United Nations-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon, which has been investigating the 2005 assassination of \nformer Prime Minister Rafik Hariri -- the father of the younger Prime Minister Saad Hariri. Indications suggested that \nthe United Nations-backed tribunal was going to indict members of Hezbollah for Rafik Hariri's assassination, even \nhanding over supporting documents to a pre-trial judge. For its part, Hezbollah wanted the government to convene \nan emergency session aimed at opposing the tribunal. No concurrence on the matter led to the exit of the \nopposition ministers from cabinet and the fall of the Hariri government.\n\nThe political scene became more tense when Najib Mikati, the Hezbollah nominee, was chosen for the post of \nprime minister following talks with President Michel Suleiman. The Western-backed March 14 Alliance of outgoing \n\n\n\nPrime Minister Hariri made it clear that it would not sanction such a move and would not participate in any new \nHezbollah-backed government of Mikati.  Now, in June 2011, as the new cabinet line-up was unveiled, even as \nMikati promised a government that would be for \"all the nation,\" it was apparent that the government was not \nrepresentative of the wide array of political parties of Lebanon.  Instead, it was heavily dominated by members of \nHezbollah and its closest ally, Michel Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement. It should be noted that Aoun, a Christian,  \nwas once an enemy of Shi'a Hezbollah, but has since reconciled with the Islamic militant extremist group for \nstrategic political reasons.  He has, therefore, been viewed as a traitor by many Christian Lebanese.\n\nNot surprisingly, the nature of the new Lebanese government signaled alarm bells across the West in response to \nthis move.  Indeed, Hezbollah has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Canada, and \nseveral other Western powers.  Moreover, the ascendancy of Hezbollah as the dominant power in Lebanon was \nillustrative of the resurgence of Syrian and Iranian power on the Lebanese scene.\n\nIt should be noted that the aforementioned United Nations Special Tribunal for Lebanon was scheduled to \nannounce its findings by July 2011.  A list of indictments was expected to include members of Hezbollah, therefore \ncompelling the government of Lebanon to arrest those individuals.  To that end, at the close of June 2011, the \nUnited Nations-backed tribunal investigating the assassination of the late Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri reportedly \nmoved to issue arrest warrants for four members of Hezbollah.\n\nThe son of Hariri, Saad Hariri, said that he welcomed these moves, characterizing them as  \"historic\" developments \nin Lebanese recent history.  As reported by Agence France Presse, the younger Hariri said: After many years of \npatience, of struggle... today, we witness a historic moment in Lebanese politics, justice and security.\"\n\nAt a news conference, newly-selected Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said, \"All suspects are innocent until \nproven guilty.\"  Prime Minister  Mikati said his government intended to  deal \"responsibly and realistically\" with the \nUnited Nations indictments, but that it would  bear in mind \"that these are accusations and not verdicts.\"\n\nDespite Prime Minister Mikati's public claims that  Lebanon's international responsibilities include its support for the \ntribunal, his view was not echoed by the rest of the Hezbollah-dominated government.  Indeed, it was Hezbollah's \nobjections to the very  United Nations Special Tribunal for Lebanon that led to the collapse of the previous \ngovernment, ushering in the current Hezbollah-dominated government, headed by Mikati.  As expected, \nHezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, quickly  rejected the  indictments, insisting that no power would be allowed \nto arrest four indicted  individuals, whom he characterized as the \"honorable brothers.\"  He has also insisted that \nthere was \"no direct evidence\" against the four suspects despite the existence of incriminating telephone records.\n\nClearly, with this assertion from Nasrallah, there was little optimism that  the new Lebanese government would \nactually act on the basis of the indictments and arrest the four Hezbollah individuals at stake.  Regardless, Lebanon \nnow had 30 days to serve the arrest warrants; should the Lebanese authorities fail to act, then the Special Tribunal \nfor Lebanon would be empowered to publicize the indictments and summon the suspects to appear before the \ncourt.  In fact, if the Lebanese authorities failed to act upon the dictates of international law, the United Nations \nSecurity Council would  have to make a decision on its next course of action.  The entire situation placed Lebanon \nat risk of international isolation.\n\nNote that by July 10, 2011, Interpol was circulating arrest warrants for the named in the aforementioned indictments \nover the  assassination of the late Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.  The suspects' names, photographs, and \nother biographical information were made public at that time.\n\nAccording to a spokesperson for the United Nations-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon, Marten Youssed, \"The \ntribunal has requested Interpol to notify all states of the arrest warrants.\"\n\n\n\nMore than a month later, on Aug. 17, 2011, the  United Nations Special Tribunal for Lebanon publicized the  \ncharges against four named suspects, who were expected to be tried in absentia.\n\nIn the indictment, Mustafa Badreddine, a high-level figure in the Lebanese Hezbollah, was identified as the central \ndirector of the operation.  Another Hezbollah figure, Salim Ayyash, was accused of orchestrating the actual \nassassination of former Prime Minister Hariri.  The other two suspects were charged with complicity due to their \nattempts to craft a false  claim of responsibility. The tribunal's chief prosecutor, Daniel Bellemare, said that the \npublication of the indictment would serve to  \"finally inform the public and the victims about the facts.\"  He \ncontinued, \"The full story will, however, only unfold in the courtroom, where an open, public, fair and transparent \ntrial will render a final verdict.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on Aug. 11, 2011, a bomb exploded at a parking lot in  a northern suburb of the Lebanese capital city of \nBeirut.  Two people were killed as a result of the explosion while at least one passerby was injured.  According to \npolice, the two people who died had been handling explosives at the time of the blast.  Accordingly, there was \nspeculation that the two individuals may have been either  assembling the bomb or trying to dismantle it.  \nRegardless, Lebanese authorities indicated that they were treating the incident as an act of terrorism. The situation \nrecalled the period between 2004 and 2008 when there were a spate of car bombings in Lebanon -- most of which \ntargeted anti-Syrian figures.\n\nIn the realm of foreign relations,  Hezbollah claimed that it uncovered a Central Intelligence Agency  spy ring in \nLebanon.  A Hezbollah member of parliament, Hassan Fadlallah, confirmed in an interview with Agence France \nPresse that \"Lebanese intelligence vanquished U.S. and Israeli intelligence in what is now  known as the \nintelligence war.\" A report by the Associated Press reflected the same claims with acknowledgment from officials in \nthe United States. Of course, the dynamics of the respective governments notwithstanding, the lives of the \nindividuals accused of spying were now broadly regarded to be at risk.\n\nThe notion of foreign agents inflitrating Hezbollah-dominated Lebanon resurfaced in February 2012 when  a military \ntribunal in Lebanon sentenced three people to death for spying on Hezbollah  on behalf of Israel. The men \nreportedly passed on information about Hezbollah officials to Israeli contacts over the course of a decade. The \ncases have come to light since 2009 when Lebanese authorities began a crackdown against  Israeli spies, leading \nto the arrests, convictions, and death sentencing of several suspects.\n\n2012 Update:\n\nIn 2012, Lebanon was being rocked by spill-over sectarian violence from Syria.  In May 2012, sectarian clashes in \nnorthern Lebanon left a number of people dead and several more injured, with blame being placed on brewing \nconflict between Alawite supporters of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Sunnis, who back the Syrian \nopposition. Syrian President Assad was himself an Alawite -- a variant of the Shi'a sect of Islam. Of particular \nconcern was the outbreak of violence in the Lebanese city of Tripoli and the deaths of at least five people there.\n\nAt issue was the eruption of violence when a Sunni cleric, Shadi al-Moulawi, was arrested on terrorism charges.  \nSupporters of al-Moulawi said he was detained  because of his assistance to Syrian refugees.  Of course, \nLebanon's current government -- dominated by members of Hezbollah --  has held a more favorable orientation to \nSyria, and could presumably be less lenient with anti-Syrian activists.  Despite calls by political and religious \nleaders to end the violence, fighting has continued in Lebanon, which has increasingly become a bastion of refuge \nfor Syrian refugees fleeing the violence in Syria.\n\nBy the third week of the month (May 2012), the spillover violence continued when Sheikh Ahmed Abdul Wahid, an \nopponent of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, was shot to death  at a Lebanese army checkpoint.  The incident \noccurred in a part of Lebanon where the sympathies of the people were clearly with the  Syrian rebels. The incident, \n\n\n\ntherefore, brought into high relief the aforementioned tensions between Lebanon's current government (dominated \nby members of Hezbollah and pro-Assad in orientation) -- and -- Sunni Muslims in Lebanon who have some loyalty \nto the anti-Syrian former Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, and thus feel connected to the Syrian opposition.\n\nSheikh Wahid's death triggered violent street battles, which reached new heights at the funeral of the Sunni Muslim \ncleric. Demonstrations ensued in the northern province of Akkar, while protests in Beirut spurred gun battles as well \nas the firing of rocket-propelled grenades.  In Beirut, the street battle were between members of the Future \nMovement (aligned with supporters of former Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri), and pro-Syrian activists.  At least two \npeople died as a result.  The violence in Lebanon served as a reminder of the episodes of sectarian strife that has \nperiodically plagued the country over the years, and raised the specter of another sectarian conflict erupting in \nLebanon.\n\nBy the start of June 2012, around ten people were killed and more than 20 were injured in Tripoli when clashes  \nbroke out in the northern port city.  As before, they were seemingly sparked  by the crisis unfolding in neighboring \nSyria.  In this case, pro-Syrian  Alawites and anti-Assad Sunni cadres became embroiled in violent clashes on June \n2, 2012 in  the Sunni Bab al-Tebbaneh district and  inthe pro-Syrian and Alawite Jabal Mohsen neighborhood of  \nTripoli. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati visited Tripoli,  held talks with ministers and officials, and promised \nthat security forces would work to stop the violence.  However, the passions of the two sides were clearly inflamed \nand were sparking sectarian tensions in a manner unseen in recent times.  With no end in sight to the Syrian crisis, \nit was unlikely that the spill-over sectarian violence in Lebanon would spontaneously end.  The main question was \nwhether or not it could trigger a return to Lebanon's previous political landscape of sectarian conflict.\n\nIn mid-August 2012, four Arab countries --  Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait -- urged their citizens \nto exit Lebanon due to spillover sectarian violence from Syria.\n\nThe call was made following a series of kidnappings of Sunni Muslims by a powerful Shi'a clan in Lebanon. The al-\nMeqdad clan claimed that the 20 individuals (most of whom were Syrian nationals but also included at least one \nTurkish and one Saudi national) had ties to the Syrian rebels.  They further claimed that the kidnappings had been \ncarried out in retaliation for the abduction of an al-Meqdad clan member by Syrian rebels in Damascus.  The Syrian \nrebels had their own counterclaim; they said that the man they seized in Damascus was fighting for the Syrian \ngovernment on behalf of Lebanon's Shia Hezbollah movement. The situation was further complicated when seven \nLebanese hostages held by Syrian rebels were wounded as Syrian warplanes struck the town of Azaz to the north \nof the Syrian city of Aleppo.\n\nMeanwhile, the Lebanese city of Tripoli had already seen no shortage of violence between supporters and \nopponents of Syrian President Assad.\n\nAs a result of these developments, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait were clearly responding to \nthe fact that the Syrian de facto civil war was not only slipping over into Lebanese terrain, but was also being \nimprinted with a sectarian dimension. Indeed, it was pitting Shi'a and Sunni against one another, with implications \nfor the entire region.\n\nOf course,  Saudi Arabia and Qatar -- both countries with predominantly Sunni Muslim citizens -- have offered \nsupport to the Syrian rebels fighting the Assad regime.\n\nAlso in August 2012, the pro-Hezbollah cabinet of Lebanon approved a new electoral law based on proportional \nrepresentation and referred it to the parliament for ratification.  If passed in the legislative chamber, the new \nlegislation would divide Lebanon into 13 electoral districts for the 2013 legislative elections, effectively reducing the \nnumber of constituencies in half from its current 26 districts.  With the vote in parliament pending, former Lebanese \nPrime Minister Saad Hariri, who was now serving as the pro-Western opposition leader, made clear that he and his \nparty would reject the legislation.  Hariri  explained that the draft electoral law would disadvantage half the \n\n\n\nLebanese population, saying: \"This draft law is directed against more than half of the Lebanese...  This project is \nunacceptable and will not pass.\" Hariri also accused the government of adopting the electoral law  because it would \ngive the militant party of Hezbollah an advantage at the polls.\n\nOn Oct. 19, 2012, Lebanon was rocked by shocking violence when a massive car bombing occurred in the mainly \nChristian district of Ashrafiya within the capital city of  Beirut. Three people were killed as a result and as many as \n80 others were wounded. Among the dead was the internal intelligence chief, Wissam al-Hassan.\n\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility although it was apparent that Hassan may have been the target of \nan assassination plot. Hassan's close ties to the anti-Syrian opposition led to suspicion that the violence in Lebanon \nwas intrinsically connected to the de facto civil war raging in Syria between the Assad regime in that country, and \nthe anti-government opposition movement.  Of course, Hassan was  also a close associate of opposition leader \nSaad Hariri, who was also a vocal critic of the Assad regime in Syria. It should be noted that Saad Hariri's father, \nformer Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, was assassinated in 2005. Pro-western in orientation, Hariri's assassination was \nlinked towards his anti-Syrian orientation.  The Hassan-Hariri connection to Syria was a strong one since Hassan \nled the  investigation  into the 2005 assassination, which ultimately implicated Syria.  More recently, Hassan was \nbehind the arrest of a Lebanese politician who was allegedly plotting a terror campaign in Lebanon, with Syria as \nthe supposed sponsor of such action.  Thus, suspicion in the Hassan assassination was quickly pointing in the \ndirection of Syria once again.\n\nAt home in Lebanon, protesters took to the streets to register their outrage.  The emerging unrest led  Prime \nMinister Najib Mikatis to offer his resignation to\n\nPresident Michel Suleiman.  The president, however, urged him to remain in his role in the interests of national unity \nand stability, and in order to prevent a power vacuum.\n\nWith the government of Mikati supported by the political wing of Hezbollah, and with Hassan linked with the 14 \nMarch opposition alliance of Saad Hariri, the notion of national unity seemed illusive.  Indeed, the two political \nblocs have long been on a collision coure.  The assassination of Hassan likely re-opened old wounds, as they \nstoked the memories of the assassination of Rafik Hariri, ultimately deepening the political cleavages between pro-\nSyrian and Hezbollah factions on one side, and the pro-Western opposition on the other.  Not surprisingly, the \nopposition reacted unfavorably to the idea of Mikati staying on at the helm of a national unity government, even as \nefforts soon shifted towards the goal of forming a new coalition government.\n\nThe Western-backed 14 March opposition alliance made it known that it was holding Mikati \"personally responsible \nfor Hassan's blood and the blood of innocent people.\"  It also demanded the resignation of Mikat's government.  \nFurther, former Prime Minister Fouad Siniora of  14 March opposition alliance warned, \"The Lebanese people won't \naccept, after today, the continuation of the government of assassination.\" Stung by these accusations, Mikati \nresponded by rescinding his offer of resignation and instead insisting that he would remain as head of government.\n\nIn an additional twist, the opposition alliance's leader, Said Hariri, unequivocally accused Syrian  President Bashar \nAssad of being behind Hassan's assassination.\n\n2013 Update\n\nIn February 2013, Bulgarian officials were placing the blame on Lebanon-based Hezbollah for a  bus bombing that \nkilled five Israelis and a local bus driver, in the Black Sea resort town of Burgas in mid-2012.\n\nThe attack on July 18, 2012, which also resulted in the death of the suspected suicide bomber, occurred at the \nBurgas airport in Bulgaria.  The bombing appeared to target a bus carrying Israeli tourists and ensued on the 18th \n\n\n\nanniversary of a deadly attack on a Jewish community center in Argentina, raising the likelihood that the Bulgaria \nbombing was another instance of anti-Jewish terrorism by extremist elements.\n\nAt the time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasted little time in blaming Iran for the act of terrorism. A \nday later, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak expanded on Netanyahu's claim that Iran was behind the act of \nterrorism, explaining that the Lebanese Hezbollah was the direct perpetrator of the attack, but had been acting \nunder the aegis  of Iran.  Netanyahu himself explained the connection using the following phrase: \"Hezbollah, the \nlong arm of Iran.\" Analysts were suggesting that the terror attack in Bulgaria was likely another manifestation of the \ncovert  war between Israel and Iran.  To that end, there were intimations that the Bulgaria bombing might have been \na retaliatory attack for the series of targeted strikes against  Iranian nuclear scientists. For its part, Iran dismissed \nthe accusation and expressed condemnation for \"all terrorist acts.\"\n\nNo statement, though, came from Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nIn mid- 2012, United States officials were suggesting that the suicide bomber on the bus in Bulgaria was a member \nof Hezbollah.  According to the New York Times,  their sources did not wish to be identified as the investigation was \nunder way, however, the suicide bomber was in Bulgaria on a mission to attack Israeli interests. The New York \nTimes' unnamed sources also observed that Hezbollah was being guided and sponsored by Iran in this effort. \nBulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov was on the record confirming that the suicide bomber had been \"in \ncountry\" for several days prior to the terror attack.\n\nMore than six months later in February 2013, and with an investigation having taken place, Bulgarian officials were \nnow officially saying that there were  \"obvious links\" to Lebanon and Hezbollah.  Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan \nTsvetanov said  that two suspects involved in the Burgas bombing plot  were directly linked to Hezbollah.  He said, \n\"We have established that the two were members of the militant wing of Hezbollah. There is data showing the \nfinancing and connection between Hezbollah and the two suspects.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasted little time re-entering the fray.  He accused Lebanon-based \nHezbollah and Iran of \"waging a global terror campaign across borders and continents\" and called on Europe to \n\"reach the required conclusions regarding  the true nature of Hezbollah.\"  That latter call appeared to reference the \nfact that many European countries have not gone so far as Israel and the United States in classifying  Hezbollah  as \na terrorist organization.\n\nIn the third week of February 2013, Bahraini  authorities were saying that they had foiled an Iranian-backed terror \nplot that  targeted military and civil installations as well as certain  public figures.  The public security chief, Major \nGeneral Tariq Al Hassan,  accused an Iranian national, Abu Nasser, of dispatching funds  to a terror cell named \n\"Army of Imam,\"  presumably to carry out the operation.  As well, five suspects linked with the terror cell were \narrested in Bahrain and Oman. Bahrain's Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid bin Abdullah al-Khalifa\n\nconfirmed that a \"terrorist cell\" linked to Iran  and Lebanon had been uncovered. For its part, Iranian politicians \ndismissed the claimed of an Iran-linked terrorist cell.  Indeed, Hoseyn Naqavi Hoseyni, the  spokesman of Iran \nMajlis Committee on National Security and Foreign Policy, described the allegation as part of Bahrain's campaign \nof  \"Iranophobia.\"  Meanwhile, a Lebanese member of parliament and leader of the Free Patriotic Movement, Michel \nAoun, actively entered the Shi'ite-Sunni fracas in Bahrain when he accused the international community and the \nArab League for failing to support Bahrain's Shi'ite  protest movement.  It should be noted that Aoun's Free Patriotic \nMovement has been Hezbollah's main Christian ally in Lebanon.\n\nIn March 2013, Lebanese President Michel Suleiman and Prime Minister Najib Miqati signed a decree calling for \nparliamentary elections to be held in June  2013.\n\n\n\nLater in the month on March 23, 2013,  Lebanese President Michel Sleiman accepted the resignation of Prime \nMinister Najib Mikati.  Although Mikati claimed his resignation was for \"personal reasons,\" the general consensus \nwas that he resigned amidst political disagreements with the Hezbollah bloc in government.  At issue, according to \nthe Beirut Daily Star, was the fact that  Hezbollah members of the cabinet objected to a proposal to establish an \nelectoral supervisory body ahead of parliamentary elections to be held in Lebanon.  Also contributing to the \ndissonance between Hezbollah and Mikati was the Hezbollah political bloc's rejection of Mikati's plan to extend the \nterm of the internal security chief.  The growing chasm between Hezbollah and Mikati -- one time political allies -- \nappeared to be the latest manifestation of the political crisis gripping Lebanon. For his part, Mikati said that the \ninternal divisions in Lebanon were only serving to create deep wounds and urged the various political parties to \n\"come together to bring Lebanon out of the unknown.\"\n\nIn the first week of April 2013,\n\nTammam Salam -- a moderate independent and the son of former Prime Minister Saeb Salam -- was named as the \nnew head of government.  He was something of a consensus selection, as he won the support of both the pro-\nWestern March 14 bloc and the Hezbollah-controlled March 8 alliance.\n\nNote that in 2009, following a parliamentary victory for the pro-Western coalition, Lebanese President Michel \nSuleiman announced that Saad Hariri would be the country's new prime minister. In this way, the younger Hariri \nwould take on the role once held by his late father.  Prime Minister-designate Hariri was tasked with forming a new \ngovernment, which he said would include  members of the opposition. The prime minister is appointed by the \npresident in consultation with the National Assembly.  Hariri's government collapsed in January 2011 when the \nHezbollah faction withdrew from the unity government,  making way for Hezbollah-sanctioned Najib Mikati to take \non the role as the new prime minister. In March 2013, Lebanese President Michel Suleiman and Prime Minister \nNajib Miqati signed a decree calling for parliamentary elections to be held in June 2013.  Shortly thereafter, Mikati \nissued his resignation due to conflicts with Hezbollah and as noted above, in April 2013, Tammam Salam was \nnamed as the new head of government.  See below for primer on 2013 elections and an announcement on the \npostponement of those polls.\n\nViolence from Syria reaches Lebanon due to Hezbollah's involvement in Syrian conflict\n\nIn mid-August 2013, Lebanon was struck by Hezbollah-related violence.  An explosion in a southern suburb of \nBeirut killed about two dozen people and injured 200 others. The blast also exacted massive damage to buildings \nand vehicles in the vicinity.\n\nA week later as August 2013 was coming to a close, the northern city of Tripoli was the venue of further attacks.  \nThe bloodshed was being attributed to Hezbollah's ongoing involvement in the civil war in Syria, which has \nexacerbated sectarian tensions between Shi'ites (such as pro-Assad Hezbollah) and Sunni Muslims (of the type \nthat form the base of the Syrian rebel opposition). Indeed, that connection was made clear when a Syrian rebel \ngroup took responsibility for a bombing in Beirut a month earlier (discussed below) and threatened to continue its \nassault against  Hezbollah.\n\nGoing back to the start of July 2013, a car bomb exploded in the Lebanese capital city of Beirut, resulting in injuries \nto scores of people.  The bombing occurred in the Beir el-Abed area of Beirut, which was known to be a stronghold \nof the Shi'a Islamic extremist militant entity, Hezbollah.  Although there was no claim of responsibility for the attack, \nHezbollah's role in the Syrian civil war next door raised questions about spillover violence into Lebanon from Syria.  \nTo be clear, Lebanon-based Hezbollah has increasingly taken a high profile role on the side of the Assad regime as \nit has fought a relentless battle to hold onto power in Syria against a rebel movement supported by other Arab \ncountries and the West. For their part, rebels have railed against Hezbollah for siding with the Assad regime and \ninvolving itself in the Syrian conflict.  They have accordingly threatened to target Hezbollah in Lebanon for its \nintervention into the Syrian civil war.\n\n\n\nIt  was not known if this bombing was the work of Syrian rebels in retaliation for Hezbollah's activity in Syria.  That \nbeing said, by mid-July 2013, the United Nations\n\nSecurity Council was demanding that Lebanon-based Hezbollah end its involvement in the conflict in neighboring \nSyria.  A statement from the  United Nations\n\nSecurity Council  read as follows: \"The Security Council calls upon all Lebanese parties to recommit to Lebanon's \npolicy of disassociation, to stand united behind President Michel Suleiman in this regard and to step back from any \ninvolvement in the Syrian crisis.\"\n\nOn July 16, 2013, a roadside bomb in Lebanon, close to the Syrian border, appeared to target  a convoy carrying \nmembers of Hezbollah.  The explosion killed one Hezbollah official and wounded two others.  Because Syrian \nopposition rebels have warned they would strike against Hezbollah, in retaliation for the militant Shi'a Islamic \nentity's involvement in the Syrian civil war, all suspicion rested on the rebels for this attack.  It was vividly clear that \nthe Syrian civil war, and specifically, Hezbollah's involvement in that conflict, was having an effect on the other side \nof the border in Lebanon.\n\nSpillover violence from Syria reached new heights on July 17, 2013, when a well-known commentator on Syrian \nstate television was assassinated in the southern Lebanese town of Sarafand. Mohammad Darra Jamo worked for \nthe Syrian state media, but also appeared frequently on other Arab networks; he was known to be a strong \nsupporter of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. According to reports, gunmen were hiding in Darra Jamo's house \nprior to the attack;  the  gunmen opened fire and killed him. The Syrian state news agency, SANA, said that an \n\"armed terrorist group\" carried out the attack while Lebanese security officials said the assassination was carried \nout by supporters of the Syrian rebel movement.\n\nMeanwhile, the 15-member United Nations body conveyed its anxieties about the rising death toll in Syria -- now \nestimated to be approaching 100,000 since the start of the  conflict in 2011 -- as well as the increasing number of \ninternally displaced persons -- now estimated to be as many as four million with two million fleeing to  neighboring \ncountries.  Lebanon, especially, was bearing the brunt of the exodus of from Syria, as refugees sought to escape \nthe cross-fire of bloodshed and violence. To this end, the United Nations Security Council noted in its statement: \n\"The Security Council underlines the need for assistance on an unprecedented scale, both to meet the needs of the \nrefugees and of host communities, and to assist the Lebanese authorities who face extraordinary financial and \nstructural challenges as a result of the refugee influx.\"\n\nNawaf Salam - Lebanon's ambassador to the United Nations - addressed the matter of  Syrian refugees in his \ncountry saying, \"Lebanon will not close its borders. Lebanon will not turn back any refugees. Lebanon will continue \nto provide assistance to all Syrian refugees. But let's be clear, Lebanon cannot cope with the burden of the refugee \ncrisis. Lebanon needs international support.\"\n\nIn mid-August 2013, as noted above, Lebanon was struck by further Hezbollah-related violence.  An explosion in a \nsouthern suburb of Beirut left about two dozen people dead, up to 200 others wounded, and exacted massive \ndamage to buildings and vehicles in the vicinity.  The high number of injuries was due to the fact that the explosion -\n- caused by  a car bomb -- occurred in a densely populated part of Beirut. Of course, the area was also a stronghold \nof Hezbollah. Accordingly, the violence was being attributed to Hezbollah's ongoing involvement in the civil war in \nSyria, which has exacerbated sectarian tensions between Shi'ites (such as pro-Assad Hezbollah) and Sunni \nMuslims (of the type that form the base of the Syrian rebel opposition). That claim gained traction when a Syrian \nrebel group took responsibility for a bombing in Beirut a month earlier (discussed above).  In a video posting, the  \nBattalions of Ayesha indicated their involvement in the Beirut bombing in July 2013 and promised to continue to \ntarget Hezbollah strongholds, which it described as \"colonies of Iran.\"\n\n\n\nPoliticians from Hezbollah's government wing characterized the car bombing as a  \"terrorist attack,\"  but they were \nseemingly cognizant of the deleterious consequences of the militant wing's activities in Syria as they also urged \ntheir supporters to exercise \"restraint.\" But Hezbollah's militant wing was in no mood for the rhetoric of restraint.  A \nday after the bombing,  Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah referred to the Sunni Muslim militants from Syria  \nbehind the attack promising to personally fight in Syria against them. Speaking on his own television channel, \nNasrallah said, \"I will go myself to Syria if it is necessary in the battle against the takfiris (Sunni radicals).\" He also \nindicated that Hezbollah had no intention of retreating from its effort to support the Assad regime in Syria.  \nDispelling the notion that spill-over violence would make Hezbollah rethink its activities, Nasrallah declared that his \nmovement would re-intensify its involvement in Syria by doubling its forces fighting in that country.\n\nMeanwhile, no conflict involving Lebanon-based Hezbollah could occur without some reference to Israel.  Some \npoliticians in Lebanon were casting blame on Israel for the mid-August 2013 attack in Beirut.  At a joint  news \nconference with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Israeli  President Shimon Peres dismissed that \nnotion with a succinct declaration as follows: \"Why should they look to Israel? They have a Hezbollah that collects \nbombs, that goes and kills people in Syria without the permission of the Lebanese government.\"\n\nViolence continued to punctuate the Lebanese political landscape a week later. On Aug. 23, 2013, the northern \nLebanese city of Tripoli was rocked by explosions, which left more than 40 people dead and another 400 injured. \nThe blast occurred at  the al-Taqwa mosque during Friday prayers; a second explosion ensued minutes later at the \nal-Salam mosque.  Noteworthy was the fact that the well-known  Sunni cleric opposed to Shi'a Hezbollah, Sheikh \nSalem Rafii, was in attendance at the al-Taqwa mosque; the general consensus was that he was the target of the \nattack although he escaped unharmed. The city of Tripoli has long been a flashpoint of sorts, representing the \nsectarian division between the majorty Sunni population of the city which also contains a small Alawite community \naligned with the Assad regime in neighboring Syria.\n\nIt should be noted that the 15-member United Nations body conveyed its anxieties about the rising death toll in \nSyria -- now estimated to be approaching 100,000 since the start of the  conflict in 2011 -- as well as the increasing \nnumber of internally displaced persons -- now estimated to be as many as four million with two million fleeing to  \nneighboring countries.  Lebanon, especially, was bearing the brunt of the exodus of from Syria, as refugees sought \nto escape the cross-fire of bloodshed and violence. To this end, the United Nations Security Council noted in its \nstatement: \"The Security Council underlines the need for assistance on an unprecedented scale, both to meet the \nneeds of the refugees and of host communities, and to assist the Lebanese authorities who face extraordinary \nfinancial and structural challenges as a result of the refugee influx.\"\n\nNawaf Salam - Lebanon's ambassador to the United Nations - addressed the matter of  Syrian refugees in his \ncountry saying, \"Lebanon will not close its borders. Lebanon will not turn back any refugees. Lebanon will continue \nto provide assistance to all Syrian refugees. But let's be clear, Lebanon cannot cope with the burden of the refugee \ncrisis. Lebanon needs international support.\"\n\nNote on Elections:\n\nParliamentary elections were set to take place in Lebanon in June 2013 (although, as noted here,  the elections \nwere subsequently postponed  and 2013 ended without those polls taking place).  At stake would be the \ncomposition of the \"Majlis al-Nuwab\"/ \"Assembl\u00e9e Nationale\" (National Assembly) -- a unicameral body where 128 \nseats  are allocated on the basis of regional and sectarian affiliation. Christian and Muslim sects are equally \nrepresented. Within the two religious groupings, seats are also allocated to various sects, such as Druze, Greek \nOrthodox, Shi'a and Sunnis.  \n\n\n\nSpecial Reports: Violence Rocks Lebanon (late 2013-2014):\n\nSuicide bombing of Iranian embassy in Beirut --\n\nOn Nov. 19, 2013, a double suicide bombing outside the Iranian embassy in the Lebanese capital of Beirut left \nmore than 20 people dead and more than 140 others injured.  The first bombing was carried out by a suicide \nattacker on a motorcycle, while the second was executed by a suicide bomber in a a four-wheel drive vehicle. \nAmong the dead was the Iranian cultural attache, Sheikh Ibrahim Ansari, who had just assumed his diplomatic post \na month prior. \n\nBecause Iran has been a well-known supporter of the Lebanese Shi'a Islamic extremist group, Hezbollah, which \ndeployed  fighters to Syria to help the government of Bashar al-Assad hang onto power against rebel forces, there \nwere suggestions that this attack was a manifestation of spillover violence from the Syrian civil war.\n\nCertainly, the violence and bloodshed augured negatively for Lebanon as it pushed the country  further into a state \nof turmoil. Noteworthy was the fact that it was the first  since Lebanon's 1975-90 Civil War that an embassy had \nbeen targeted.  Moreover, the brazen act of violence illustrated the ease with which Lebanon  was being pulled into \nSyria's destructive orbit.\n\nThere was also a sectarian element to the attack as the  Sunni Jihadist group, Abdullah Azzam Brigades, claimed \nresponsibility for the violence at the Iranian embassy in Beirut.  Via the Twitter account of the group's religious \nguide, Sheikh Sirajeddine Zuraiqat, Abdullah Azzam Brigades issued its formal claim of responsibility, declaring: \n\"The Abdullah Azzam brigades - the Hussein bin Ali cells - may they please God - are behind the attack on the \nIranian embassy in Beirut.\"  The group, which is linked with the notorious terror enclave, al-Qaida, also said that the \nbombings were a \"double martyrdom operation carried out by two heroes from the heroic Sunnis of Lebanon.\"  The \ngroup threatened more attacks in Lebanon until Iran withdrew its forces from  Syria, bolstering the view that a \nsectarian conflict that transcended borders was emerging in the Middle East.\n\nIn Lebanon, caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the violence, calling it \"a cowardly terrorist act.\"  \nLebanese Parliamentary Speaker Nabih Berri -- a member of the Hezbollah faction in the Lebanese parliament -- \nwarned that the terrorists behind the attack on the Iranian embassy were the people who attempted to assassinate \nhim a year prior.  He was quoted in  Lebanon's Daily Star newspaper as saying, \"Those who targeted the embassy \n[Tuesday] are the same team that threatened to assassinate me.\"\n\nThere was also a global outcry against the bombings, especially given the fact that a diplomatic post was the target. \nUnited Kingdom Foreign Secretary William Hague  said: \"The U.K. is strongly committed to supporting stability in \nLebanon and seeing those responsible for this attack brought to justice.\"  United States Secretary of State John \nKerry said, \"The United States knows too well the cost of terrorism directed at our own diplomats around the world, \nand our hearts go out to the Iranian people after this violent and unjustifiable attack.\"\n\nAt the start of January 2014, DNA tests  confirmed that a man arrested in Lebanon was likely  wanted in connection \nwith the bombing of the Iranian Embassy in Beirut months earlier in November 2013.  The man was identified as \nMajid al-Majid, the head of the Abdullah Azzam Brigades, which claimed responsibility for bombing. According  to \nthe Daily Star in Beirut,  Majid had been captured by the Lebanese army and was on Saudi Arabia's list of 85 most \nwanted individuals for his links to the Islamist Jihadist  terror enclave, al-Qaida.\n\nSectarian spill-over violence from Syria  hits Lebanon --\n\n\n\nNote that at the start of December 2013, Lebanon was struck by spillover violence from the war in Syria as clashes \nbroke out in the northern city of Tripoli, leaving six people dead, and as many as 50 people wounded, including \nmore than 10 soldiers.  The city of Tripoli is home to  a small Alawite community  -- the same ethnic group as \nSyria's President Bashar al-Assad. But the city is also surrounded by a larger Sunni community, which was aligned \nwith the rebel movement opposing the Assad regime in Syria.  In response to the violence in Tripoli, and with an \neye on halting the sectarian bloodshed,  the Lebanese authorities instituted military rule in that city.\n\nThese sectarian fault lines were occurring not only in Syria where the conflict was unfolding, but also in Lebanon.  \nThe sectarian tensions in Lebanon were sparked when some residents of an Alawite district  in Tripoli began flying \nSyrian flags to show support for President Assad; residents of the Bab al-Tabbana  district responded by flying the \nflag of the Syrian rebels.  The acrimony led to violent clashes, with the deadly results noted here.\n\nSenior Hezbollah commander killed in Beirut --\n\nOn Dec. 4, 2013, reports emerged that a senior Hezbollah leader  was killed in the Lebanese capital city of Beirut. \nHassan Lakkis was a  senior commander of the Lebanese Shi'a extremist terror group, Hezbollah, known to be a \nstalwart of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and an expert in  the manufacture of sophisticated weapons \nand explosives. \n\nHezbollah reacted to the news of Lakkis' death by  releasing a statement in which they noted that the senior \ncommander was attacked by assailants and shot in the head as he was returning from work late at night.  Hezbollah \nalso placed the blame for Lakkis' death on Israel, noting that the Jewish state  had carried out several assassination \nattempts against the Hezbollah commander before.  Israel denied any involvement in the death of Lakkis, saying via \nYigal Palmor, its spokesperson for the Israeli foreign ministry,  \"These automatic accusations are an innate reflex \nwith Hezbollah, They don't need evidence, they don't need facts. They just blame anything on Israel.\" \n\nIndeed, there were parallel accusations emerging about rival  Sunni Jihadists being behind the death of Laqqis.  \nThere was even a claim of responsibility for the assassination of Lakkis from a previously unknown group, the \nBrigades of the Free Sunnis in Baalbek.  Coming on the heels of the attack on the Iranian embassy in Beirut a week \nbefore at the hands of the Sunni Jihadist group, Abdullah Azzam Brigades, it was a more plausible explanation of \nthe assassination, rather than the standpoint anti-Israel explanation for Hezbollah's problems.  The so-called \"blame \ngame\" aside, it was certainly clear that Lebanon was once again at risk of sectarian  conflict.\n\nExplosion in Lebanon kills Sunni politicians with anti-Assad and anti-Hezbollah ties  --\n\nOn Dec. 27, 2013, Mohamad Chatah  -- an opposition politician and former Lebanese cabinet minister -- was killed \nduring a car bombing in central Beirut. The attack took place between the Starco Centre and Phoenicia Hotel close \nto the Lebanese parliament building. The blast killed several other individuals and left as many as 50 people \ninjured.  For his part, Chatah was a Sunni Muslim who worked as an adviser to former pro-Western Prime Minister \nSaad Hariri; he was known as a moderate but also a critic of both Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the \nLebanon-based Shi'a extremist entity, Hezbollah.\n\nGiven this background, there were suggestions that Chatah was the latest casualty in the ongoing Sunni-Shi'a \nsectarian conflict that was spreading across the Middle East, but particularly influencing the Syrian civil war and \ncontributing to spill-over violence in Lebanon.  Of note was the fact that Hezbollah fighters  from Lebanon have \nbecome an integral part of the pro-Assad forces fighting in Syria to the consternation of Sunni Muslims in \nLebanon.  Tensions from both sides have manisfested in an increase in the number of sectarian attacks and \nassassinations on Lebanese soil.\n\n\n\nIn this case, former Prime Minister Saad Hariri intimated that Hezbollah may have been involved in the apparent \nassassination of Chatah, accusing \"those who are hiding from international justice and who have spread the \nregional fire to the [Lebanese] nation\" of being responsible.  This statement appeared to be a tacit reference to the \nfact that the United Nations implicated Hezbollah in the 2005 assassination of Saad Hariri's father -- former Prime \nMinister Rafiq Hariri.  Indeed, Rafiq Hariri -- like Mohamad Chatah -- shared an antipathy for the Syrian regime and \nwas wary of the power of Hezbollah with its funding from Iran and its ties to Assad in Syria.  In many senses, the \nassassination of Chatah recalled the painful historic memory of the assassination of Hariri. \n\nThat event -- the killing of Hariri in 2005 --  raised the ire of the Lebanese people, spurring the so-called Cedar \nRevolution, and ridding Lebanon of the presence Syrian forces from Lebanese soil.  The subsequent findings that \nHezbollah was likely behind the older Hariri's death have been rejected by that extremist Shi'a entity but \nnonetheless highlighted the influence of Hezbollah on the political landscape in Lebanon. Although Hezbollah \ndenied the charges, five members of the organization were due to face trial  at The Hague in connection with Rafiq \nHariri's assassination.\n\nMeanwhile, Hezbollah characterized the 2013 assassination of Chatah as a \"heinous crime\" and attempted to \ndistance itself from the violence, declaring, \"No-one benefits from [the bombing] but Lebanon's enemies.\" As well, \nSyria was quick to deny any involvement in Chatah's killing.  However, the fact of the matter was that the \nassassination occurred as Chatah was en route to a meeting of the anti-Syrian/pro-Western March 14 bloc -- led by \nSaad Hariri -- when his convoy was struck by the blast. There were suggestions that  the killing of Chatah was not \nso much a targeted assassination as it was a message to Hariri's anti-Syrian/pro-Western March 14 bloc. \n\nRegardless, former Prime Minister Fuad Siniora of the March 14 bloc was not backing down from a political \nconfrontation with Hezbollah.  At the funeral for Chatah, Seniora demanded that Lebanon be freed from Hezbollah's \nmilitancy.  He said, \"We have decided to liberate the country of the occupation of illegitimate weapons to preserve \nits independence, its sovereignty and its civil peace.\"  Siniora indicated that a popular but peaceful movement \nopposed to the violence and conflict-ridden ethos of Hezbollah was in the offing as he said: \"We have decided to \nengage with the Lebanese people in peaceful, civil and democratic resistance... We call for liberty and justice, we \nwill not surrender, we will not back down, we will not be afraid.\"  The notion that his statements were aimed in \nopposition to Hezbollah became clear when funeral goers cried out, \"Hezbollah is the enemy of God,\" and \n\"Hezbollah are terrorists.\"\n\nInstability update --\n\nViolence against struck the Lebanese capital of Beirut on Jan. 2, 2014 when a car bomb killed at four people and \ninjured nine others.  The area of the car bombing was a busy shopping area not far from Hezbollah's offices. \nBecause human remains were found close to the car, which was seemingly laden with explosives, experts surmised \nthe bombing was a suicide attack.  The car bomb marked the second attack in the  Lebanese capital in less than a \nweek. \n\nAs discussed above, a car bombing in central Beirut in late December 2013  left Mohamad Chatah  -- an opposition \npolitician and former Lebanese cabinet minister -- dead along with several others.  As discussed above, blame was \nplaced (at least at the popular level) on Hezbollah. \n\nIn this case, because the target was in the  densely populated area of Haret Hreik district of Beirut --  a Hezbollah \nstronghold of the city --  suspicion rested on an anti-Hezbollah faction.  With Hezbollah -- a Shi'a extremist entity -- \ncontroversially involved in fighting on behalf of the Alawite Assad regime in Syria, there were suggestions that this \nJanuary 2014 bombing might be the work of anti-Assad Sunni Islamic militants.\n\n\n\nBoth incidences highlighted the increased Sunni-Shi'a tensions plaguing the entire region of the Middle East, with \nparticular attention to Syria, which was in the throes of its ongoing civil war, and with spill-over violence in \nneighboring countries like Lebanon.\n\nHariri assassination trial convenes amidst flare of sectarian tensions in Lebanon --\n\nIn mid-January 2014, the trial of four members of the  Shi'a extremist entity, Hezbollah, commenced at the \nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague over the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister \nRafik Hariri.  Hariri was a pro-Western politician who opposed Syrian involvement in Lebanese affairs, and by \nextension, was an antagonist of  Hezbollah, which has long been aligned with the Alawite-ruled regime of Bashar \nal-Assad in Syria. Hariri's assassination in 2005, followed by the assassinations of several other key pro-Western \nfigures in Lebanon, fueled speculation that Syria and its local proxies, such as Hezbollah, were behind the \nbloodshed.\n\nThe allegations against  the four members of Hezbollah has long been a  source of contention in Lebanon.  \nHezbollah has denied that any of its members  were involved in the dark chapter in Lebanese modern history, but \nthe pro-Western opposition has clamored for justice after so many long years of what they perceive was impunity \nfor Hezbollah.\n\nThe inclusion of Hezbollah in government in 2011  signaled alarm bells across the West  as Hezbollah has been \ndesignated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Canada, and several other Western powers.  Moreover, \nthe ascendancy of Hezbollah as the dominant power in Lebanon was illustrative of the resurgence of Syrian and \nIranian power on the Lebanese scene.\n\nBut in that same year -- 2011 --  the United Nations-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon announced its indictments \nof four members of Hezbollah in relation to the\n\nassassination of the late Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri.  Among the suspects were Mustafa Badreddine, a high-level \nfigure in the Lebanese Hezbollah, who was identified as the central director of the operation to assassinate Hariri.  \nAnother Hezbollah figure, Salim Ayyash, was accused of orchestrating the actual assassination of former Prime \nMinister Hariri.  The other two suspects -- Hussein Oneissi and Assad Sabra -- were charged with complicity due to \ntheir attempts to craft a false  claim of responsibility.  The charges thus ranged from conspiracy to commit a terrorist \nact to murder and attempted murder.\n\nThe son of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, Saad Hariri, said at the time that he welcomed the indictments, \ncharacterizing them as  \"historic\" developments in Lebanese recent history.  As reported by Agence France Presse, \nthe younger Hariri said: After many years of patience, of struggle... today, we witness a historic moment in \nLebanese politics, justice and security\n\nMeanwhile, the special tribunal's chief prosecutor, Daniel Bellemare,  has said that  the case against the four \nmembers of Hezbollah would serve to  \"finally inform the public and the victims about the facts.\"  At the time when \nthe indictment came down, Bellemare said, \"The full story will, however, only unfold in the courtroom, where an \nopen, public, fair and transparent trial will render a final verdict.\"\n\nNow, in 2014, the trial was finally set to begin with high hopes for a verdict being reached by 2015.  All four \nsuspects would be tried in absentia since not one of them has actually been arrested and at least two were believed \nto be in Iran.  In his opening statement, Prosecutor Norman Farrell said the sheer quantity of explosives made it \nclear that the attackers intended to deliver \"a terrifying message and to cause panic among the population of Beirut \nand Lebanon.\"  He added, \"It is not that the perpetrators simply did not care if they killed their fellow citizens. Rather \nthey intended to do so.\"\n\n\n\nIt was clear that the trial would likely re-open the wounds of the past.  In combination with the civil war raging in \nneighboring Syria, which has increasingly included the involvement of Hezbollah, the trial could  exacerbate the \nSunni-Shi'a sectarian conflict plaguing the Middle East, with Syria and  Lebanon at the center of that conflict.  To \nthat latter end, Lebanon was being plagued with spill-over violence from the Syrian civil war thanks to the active \ninvolvement of Lebanon-based Hezbollah in the Syrian crisis, and as that Shi'ite entity expressly supported the \nAssad regime in Syria. The result has been a plague of sectarian violence in the streets of Lebanon.\n\nGoing back to late 2013, a car bombing in central Beirut in late December 2013  left Mohamad Chatah  -- an \nopposition politician and former Lebanese cabinet minister -- dead along with several others.  Blame was placed (at \nleast at the popular level) on Hezbollah.  Then, at the start of the new year (January 2014),  a car bomb killed at \nfour people and injured nine others.  The area of the car bombing was a busy shopping area not far from \nHezbollah's offices.  Because the target was in the  densely populated area of Haret Hreik district of Beirut --  a \nHezbollah stronghold of the city --  suspicion rested on an anti-Hezbollah faction.  With Hezbollah -- a Shi'a \nextremist entity -- controversially involved in fighting on behalf of the Alawite Assad regime in Syria, there were \nsuggestions that this particular bombing might be the work of anti-Assad Sunni Islamic militants.\n\nThen, just before the Hariri assassination trial was scheduled to begin, a suicide bomb occurred in the town of \nHermel - a Hezbollah stronghold close to the Bekaa Valley and near to the border with Syria. That blast killed at \nleast five people, including the suicide bomber, and wounded 20 others. By the third week of January 2014, a \nsuicide bombing\n\nin a residential district of southern Beirut, known as a Hezbollah stronghold,  left four people dead and more than 20 \nothers wounded.  A Twitter account supposedly controlled by the Lebanese branch of the  Syrian rebel group, al-\nNusra Front, claimed responsibility for this attack.  Around the same time, further signs of spillover violence from the \nSyrian civil war flared when  fighting resumed in the northern city of Tripoli between rival factions who support \ndifferent sides of the Syrian conflict.  Then,  as January 2014 came to a close, a car bomb  exploded  in Hermel \nclose to Lebanon's northern border with Syria, killing at least three people.  The area has been known as a \nHezbollah stronghold and thus reinforced the tensions going on within Lebanon and across the border with Syria.\n\nTwin bombings by al-Qaida aligned extremists --\n\nOn Feb. 19, 2014, twin bombings struck the Lebanese capital city of Beirut. The attacks ensued in  a Hezbollah-\ncontrolled southern suburb of Beirut close to an Iranian cultural center.  Two suicide bombers in a car and on a \nmotorcycle respectively detonated the explosives strapped to their bodies, killing the suicide bombers along with at \nleast two other individuals.  Several other people were injured while massive damage was inflicted on shops and \nbusinesses in the vicinity.\n\nThe militants Sunni Islamist group, Abdullah Azzam Brigades, which was aligned with the terror enclave al-Qaida, \nimmediately claimed responsibility for the attacks.  Abdullah Azzam Brigades also took the opportunity to claim \nresponsibility for the November 2013 attack on the Iranian embassy in Beirut that killed more than 20 people.  \nBecause Iran has been a well-known supporter and funder of Hezbollah, there were suggestions that the embassy \nattack was carried out by Sunni extremists opposed to the Shi'a militant group's engagement in the Syrian war.  \nNow, it was clear that that speculation was based on merit, especially with these February 2014 twin bombings \ntaking place in  ezbollah stronghold close to an Iranian interest.  It should be noted that civilians were the primary \nvictims in both cases.\n\nAbdullah Azzam Brigades warned of more attacks to come unless Hezbollah withdrew from Syria; it also demanded \nthat its own fighters be released from jail in Lebanon.  Via its website, the militants Sunni Islamist group\n\n\n\nsaid, \"We will continue -- through the grace of God and his strength -- to target Iran and its party in Lebanon \n(Hezbollah) in all of their security, political, and military centers to achieve our two demands: One, the exit of all \nfighters from the Party of Iran in Syria. Two, the release of all our prisoners from oppressive Lebanese prisons.\"\n\nThe civil war raging in neighboring Syria has increasingly included the involvement of Hezbollah, exacerbating the \nSunni-Shi'a sectarian conflict plaguing the Middle East, with Syria and -- increasingly -- neighboring  Lebanon at the \ncenter of that conflict.  To that latter end, thanks to the active involvement of Lebanon-based Hezbollah in the \nSyrian crisis, there has been a counterveiling  plague of sectarian violence in the streets of Lebanon.  Sunnis \naligned with the opposition in Syria have railed against Hezbollah's alignment with the Assad regime in Syria.\n\nIn the Syrian civil war, the rebel groups have not been united.  Some groups have been aimed at overthrowing the \nAssad regime from office for political reasons, while other Sunni extremist groups have also sought to oust the \nAssad regime but for more ideological (read: sectarian) reasons as they oppose the Shi'a elite that has long ruled \nSyria.  In Lebanon, those dynamics were playing out in similar form.  Some Sunni enclaves were simply \nsympathetic to the rebel movement in Syria and opposed to Hezbollah.  Meanwhile, some Sunni factions were \nbeing motivated by religious extremist ideology to use tactics of terrorism.\n\nSuicide car bombing in Lebanon close to Syrian border kills three soldiers\n\nA suicide car bombing in late March 2014 at an army checkpoint in Lebanon close to the border with Syria left three \nsoldiers dead and another four wounded. The attack\n\ntook place in the town of Arsal, which was home to a complex population base including thousands of Syrian \nrefugees and Syrian (Sunni) rebels. The attack in Arsal was thus linked with the civil war rocking Syria. Indeed, it \nlikely  constituted another episode of cross-over violence.\n\nThe principal contributor to cross-over violence in Lebanon was the fact that Hezbollah -- a Shi'a extremist entity  \nbased in Lebanon  --  was controversially involved in fighting on behalf of the Alawite Assad regime in Syria.  While \nmany Shi'a Lebanese were supportive of Hezbollah's engagement in the Syrian civil war, there were other swaths \nof the Lebanese populace  who were Sunnis and held allegiances instead to the rebel movement in Syria (the fact \nthat some elements of the Syrian rebel movement were extremist Islamists notwithstanding).\n\nTensions were already at an elevated level following the capture of the strategic Syrian border town of Yabroud by \nthe Syrian army earlier in the month. Then as March 2014 was coming to a close, the Syrian army were making \nmore gains as they captured the Syrian border towns of Flita and Ras Maara.  Collectively,  these victories for the \nAssad regime in Syria likely created consternation among Sunni antagonists across the border in Lebanon where \nmany Sunni residents were more sympathetic to the Syrian rebels than the Alawite Assad regime.  Now, the attack \nin Arsal -- for which the Sunni extremist group Ahrar al-Sunna claimed responsibility -- suggested these tensions \nwere escalating, and that Sunni militants were becoming increasingly active not only in Syria but also in Lebanon.\n\nThe timing of the Arsal attack was key, coming as it did on the heels of a blustery speech by  Hezbollah leader, \nHassan Nasrallah, in which he declared that he was protecting Lebanon by fighting Sunni militants in Syria.  Of \ncourse, around the same time, the Lebanese army raided the house of a Sunni bomb maker in Arsal and killed \nhim.  Together, the two incidences were illustrative of the competing loyalties and ethno-sectarian hostilities at play \nin Lebanon.\n\nCollectively, the violence in Lebanon highlighted the increased Sunni-Shi'a tensions plaguing the entire region of \nthe Middle East, with particular attention to Syria, which was in the throes of its ongoing civil war, and with spill-over \nviolence in neighboring countries like Lebanon.\n\n\n\nAttacks in Lebanon suggest continued spill-over sectarian violence from Syria --\n\nIn June 2014, a suicide bombing in eastern Lebanon left a police officer dead and more than 30 other people \ninjured.  That attack was believed to have been an attempted assassination of the security head, Major General \nAbbas Ibrahim, who was traveling in the area at the time. Soon thereafter, Lebanese security forces carried out a \nraid on a hotel in the capital of Beirut and arrested more than a dozen individuals who were linked with the attacks \nin Lebanon.\n\nIn the last week of June 2014, there was a suicide car bombing close to an army checkpoint in the Lebanese capital \nof Beirut. An officer in Lebanon's General Security forces was killed and more than a dozen other people were \ninjured.  This particular attack took place as people were watching a football match.  Because the attack took place \nin a southern suburb largely inhabited by Shi'a Muslims and pro-Hezbollah elements, suspicion rested on Sunni \nactivist lashing out at the Shi'a militant group, Hezbollah, for its involvement in the Syrian civil war.  However, an \nadditional element was the fact that Sunni terrorists from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) were \nadvancing in Iraq, thus possibly emboldening other Sunni extremists in the region in what was quickly becoming a \nregional sectarian conflict.\n\nTwo days after the army checkpoint attack, another suicide bombing took place in Beiruit -- this time  at the Duroy \nhotel located in close proximity to the  Saudi Arabian embassy. The suicide bomber died in the incident.  Several \nother persons -- mostly security personnel who approached the assailant as he prepared to detonate the \nexplosives  - were wounded.  In this case, with the assailant believed to be a Saudi national and quite likely a Sunni \nMuslim, the sectarian and geopolitical dimension was clearly evident.\n\nSpillover violence from the Syrian civil war --\n\nSpillover violence from Syria was in late October and early November 2014  arising in Lebanon where Islamic \nmilitants were engaged in battles with Lebanese military forces in the northern city of Tripoli.  Fierce battles went \non for days and left Lebanese soldiers, civilians, and Islamic extremist fighters dead.  However, Lebanese \nauthorities were ultimately able to gain the upper hand and re-assert control over the city. Of concern was the fact \nthat the Islamist militants appeared to be a mix of  Lebanese and Syrian  fighters aligned with ISIL and the al-Nusra \nFront.  This development pointed to a closer alliance between the two extremist entities than previously thought.\n\nAdditional Note:\n\nCollectively, the recent violence in Lebanon has highlighted the increased Sunni-Shi'a tensions plaguing the entire \nregion of the Middle East, with particular attention to Syria, which was in the throes of its ongoing civil war, and with \nspillover violence in neighboring countries like Lebanon.\n\nThe civil war raging in neighboring Syria has increasingly included the involvement of Hezbollah, exacerbating the \nSunni-Shi'a sectarian conflict plaguing the Middle East, with Syria and -- increasingly -- neighboring  Lebanon at the \ncenter of that conflict.  To that latter end, thanks to the active involvement of Lebanon-based Hezbollah in the \nSyrian crisis, there has been a counterveiling  plague of sectarian violence in the streets of Lebanon.  Sunnis \naligned with the opposition in Syria have railed against Hezbollah's alignment with the Assad regime in Syria.\n\nIn the Syrian civil war, the rebel groups have not been united.  Some groups have been aimed at overthrowing the \nAssad regime from office for political reasons, while other Sunni extremist groups have also sought to oust the \nAssad regime but for more ideological (read: sectarian) reasons as they oppose the Shi'a elite that has long ruled \nSyria.  In Lebanon, those dynamics were playing out in similar form.  Some Sunni enclaves were simply \n\n\n\nsympathetic to the rebel movement in Syria and opposed to Hezbollah.  Meanwhile, some Sunni factions were \nbeing motivated by religious extremist ideology to use tactics of terrorism.\n\nNew Government for Lebanon\n\nIn mid-February 2014, following more than 10 months of political wrangling, Lebanon finally formed a new \ngovernment.\n\nThe new cabinet would be split equally between members of the pro-Western March 14 bloc and the Hezbollah-led \nfaction.\n\nThe government would be led by the incumbent Prime Minister Tammam Salam -- a moderate independent and the \nson of former Prime Minister Saeb Salam -- who had been named as the consensus head of government.  Salam \nwould continue in that role -- this time at the helm of an uneasy coalition between two rival alliances, as noted \nbelow.\n\nIt should be noted that the office of the presidency has been occupied by President Michel Suleiman since 2008. In \naccordance with the 1943 National Pact, the president is supposed to be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister is \nto be a Sunni Muslim, and the president of the National Assembly is to be a Shi'a Muslim. This means that \nLebanon's president is the only non-Muslim head of state in the Arab world amidst a system of pluralistic religious \nrepresentation.\n\nGoing back to 2011, the pro- Western government of Prime Minister Saad Hariri's government collapsed when the \nHezbollah faction withdrew from the unity government,  making way for Hezbollah-sanctioned Najib Mikati to take \non the role as prime minister.  But in 2013, the prime minister resigned amidst disagreements with Hezbollah. At \nissue, according to the Beirut Daily Star, was the fact that  Hezbollah members of the cabinet objected to a proposal \nto establish an electoral supervisory body ahead of parliamentary elections.  Also contributing to the dissonance \nbetween Hezbollah and Mikati was the Hezbollah political bloc's rejection of Mikati's plan to extend the term of the \ninternal security chief.  The growing chasm between Hezbollah and Mikati -- one time political allies -- appeared to \nbe the latest manifestation of the political crisis gripping Lebanon.  As noted above, Mikati was succeeded by \nSalam as the new head of government, although since being named to that post, the actual composition of his \ngovernment has been a matter of consternation.  There were high hopes that the formation of this new government \n-- as uneasy and unlikely a coalition as it might be -- could at least chart the path towards elections.\n\nIndeed, the new government was intended to end the political stalemate plaguing Lebanon, and it would be tasked \nwith crafting a new electoral law and preparing the country for elections.  Those elections had been scheduled to be \nheld in mid-2013 but  were delayed due to internal political hostility between the  Hezbollah-led faction and the pro-\nWestern bloc; those tensions were  exacerbated by spill-over violence from the civil war in Syria. A spate of violent \nattacks in Lebanon laid bare the sectarian hostilities between the stalwarts of Shi'a Hezbollah, who were  now \nactively supporting the Assad regime in Syria --  and -- the local (Lebanese) supporters of the Sunni resistance and \nrebel movement in Syria.  The cross-border interactions of Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Syria have had a long \nand enduring imprint on the Lebanese political scene.\n\nPrimer on 2014 Presidential Election in Lebanon\n\nA presidential election was expected to be held in the spring of 2014 -- ahead of May 2014  when the tenure of \nlong-serving President Michel Suleiman was scheduled to come to an end.\n\n\n\nIn Lebanon, the president is elected by the National Assembly for a six-year term  and may not serve consecutive \nterms.  In accordance with the 1943 National Pact, the president is supposed to be a Maronite Christian, the prime \nminister is to be a Sunni Muslim, and the president of the National Assembly is to be a Shi'a Muslim. This means \nthat Lebanon's president is the only non-Muslim head of state in the Arab world amidst a system of pluralistic \nreligious representation. There is also supposed to be some transfer of powers from the president to the prime \nminister and cabinet.\n\nThe last election was held in 2008.  As a result of the Doha Agreement (discussed directly above), Army \nCommander Michel Suleiman was elected by parliament and became Lebanon's new president.  The indirect vote \ngave Suleiman  118 votes out of 127.  The vote brought an end to an ongoing political impasse between rival pro-\nWestern and pro-Syrian/Hezbollah factions, which resulted in the presidency staying vacant for months after former \nPresident Emile Lahoud's term ended. In the background of these developments, there had been grave anxieties \nabout a power vacuum, constitutional crisis and civil unrest if the political impasse was not ultimately resolved.\n\nNow in 2014, it was to be seen who might succeed outgoing President Suleiman.  One candidate interested in \nentering  the political waters was Lebanese Christian politician, Samir Geagea of the Lebanese Forces Party who  \nannounced his bid for the presidency. It should be noted that Geagea was known for his views opposed to \nHezbollah and the Assad regime in Syria,  and was thus supported by the pro-Western March 12 political bloc.  It \nwas to be seen if Geagea could secure the necessary  two-thirds majority in parliament to win the presidency.\n\nThe recent political climate in Lebanon has been beset by bitter hostility between the rival pro-Western and pro-\nSyrian/Hezbollah factions, and cross-over violence from the Syrian civil war.  That war has sparked ethno-sectarian \nviolence and bloodshed on Lebanese soil as Shi'a Hezbollah has involved itself in that war to the consternation of \nLebanon's Sunni population, even forcing the delay of the country's parliamentary elections that had originally \nbeen intended to be held in 2013 but were postponed to 2014.  It was to be seen if in this climate of acrimony any \ncandidate for the presidency could capture a super-majority of support in the polarized legislative body.\n\nNote that Lebanese Parliamentary Speaker Nabih Berri called for the presidential vote in parliament to be held on \nApril 23, 2014.  Ongoing political dissonance and acrimony in Lebanon ensured that the vote would not end \nsuccessfully.  Members of parliament in Lebanon failed to elect a president since the main candidate, Geagea did \nnot secure the required two-thirds majority.  In fact, he felt significantly short of that goal,  with the pro-Hezbollah \nmembers of parliament issuing blank votes.\n\nThis result could open the race up to other potential candidates.  The former army chief, Michel Aoun, who is \nsupported by Hezbollah, could now decide to throw his hat in the ring. Of course, it was quite likely that the March \n12 bloc would take on the spoiler role on that ballot and oppose him, essentially producing another failed vote.  It \nwas also possible that both sides might support a consensus candidate, such as the current army chief, General \nJean Kahwaji,  or even Central Bank governor Riad Salameh; however, neither man has expressed any interest in \nbecoming president.\n\nA second round of voting to decide the presidency took place on April 30, 2014.  That effort was ultimately \nabandoned when several members of parliament -- mostly aligned  with Michael Aoun (mentioned above) -- opted \nto boycott the vote.  No consensus candidate was agreed upon by both of the two main political factions, \nsuggesting that the process aimed at selecting and electing a successor to outgoing President Suleiman could \ncontinue for some time.  Of course a period of protracted postponement in deciding the presidency would present a \n\n\n\npolitical challenge.  Indeed, Lebanon was in dire need of leadership at a time when divisions and sectarian conflict \ncharacterized the landscape.\n\nBy the start of May 2014, former President Amine Gemayel of the party, Kataeb, had convened talks with  Walid \nJumblatt, the head of the Progressive Socialist Party.\n\nAccording to the Daily Star, Gemayel was trying to rally Christian support for his bid for the presidency bid as the \npro-Western  March 12 bloc candidate.  It was to be seen if he could become the official replacement to Geagea.  It \nwas also to be seen if he could gain support (or at least a lack of resistance) from the Hezbollah bloc.\n\nA third round of voting on May 15, 2014, also  ended in failure, and was followed by similarly futile fourth and fifth \nrounds of voting later in May 2014 as no consensus could be found to satisfy the two rival pro-Hezbollah and pro-\nWestern factions.  A sixth round was set for June 9, 2014, amidst calls by the United Nation Security Council that \nLebanon settle its political affairs and select a new president in the interests of national and regional security.  The \nstatement by that international body read as follows: \"The Council urges the Parliament to uphold Lebanon's \nlongstanding democratic tradition and to work to ensure that presidential elections take place as soon as possible \nand without external interference.\"\n\nBut even with that external pressure, the sixth round of voting on June 9, 2014, ended in failure as Lebanon's \ndeadlocked politicians again could not agree on a successor to outgoing President Suleiman.  The failed vote \noccurred because the pro-Hezbollah faction in parliament  boycotted the session, thus depriving parliament of a \nquorum. Another voting session was set for June 18, 2014; however, until the pro-Hezbollah and pro-Western \ncoalitions could find agreement on  a consensus candidate, there was no expectation of success on that day.\n\nAs expected, the seventh round of voting on June 18, 2014, in the same way as the previous round -- without a \npresident elected to power.  Once again the Hezbollah faction boycotted the session.  Leading the boycott \nthroughout has been  Michel Aoun, who has been backed by Hezbollah. Clearly, he would continue to sabotage the \npresidential vote until he was ready to prepare himself as the presidential consensus candidate.\n\nOn June 17, 2014, ahead of the seventh round of voting, Aoun said, \"I will announce my nomination when the \npolitical situation in parliament becomes clear and when (the current candidates) are dismissed.\" Disparaging \nGeagea, he said, \"It is totally rejected to choose the weakest Christian as president and I will not tolerate this.\"  \nMaking his intentions clear, Aoun continued, \"I'm the strongest and I'm the one who represents (the Christians). My \npopularity is on the rise.\"  However, it was unlikely that the pro-Western bloc in parliament would be prepared to \naccept Aoun as president.  As such, the impasse was expected to continue for some time although news was \nemerging about an alternative presidential candidate in the form of Parliamentarian Henry Helou.\n\nNote that another attempt to elect a president took place on July 2, 2014, and ended in failure as insufficient \nparliamentarians were present in the assembly, presumably due to another boycott.  Another attempt would be \nmade later in July 2014.\n\nIn mid July 2014, former Prime Minister Saad Hariri demanded that members of parliament end the political \nimpasse and avoid the continuing power vacuum and elect a president.\n\nHe said, \"We want parliamentary elections held on schedule, and we do not want an extension for the parliament. \nBut the entrance to the parliamentary elections is electing a president of the republic -- today before tomorrow.\" \nHariri, who was living in exile in France and Saudi Arabia due to fears of assassination, also demanded that \nHezbollah withdraw from its military engagement in the civil war in neighboring Syria. He said, \"Unfortunately \n\n\n\nHezbollah believes that it will save the regime of Bashar al-Assad. The truth is no one can save Assad's regime.\"  \nWhile Hariri's demand was likely to be ignored by Hezbollah, the fact of the matter was that Hezbollah's \ninvolvement in Syria has only served to accentuate  sectarian tensions in Lebanon.  Those very tensions have done \nlittle to alleviate the highly-polarized political environment that has set the Sunni pro-Western coalition of Hariri \nagainst the Shi'ite/Allawite bloc dominated by Hezbollah.\n\nNote: As of late 2014,  a new president was not yet elected.  As such, the outcome of this election was yet to be \ndetermined.\n\nParliamentary elections in Lebanon postponed due to Syrian civil war\n\nParliamentary elections were originally set to take place in Lebanon in June 2013. As noted here, the elections \nwere postponed and rescheduled to be held in 2014, and then again delayed until  2017, due to  sectarian strife \nassociated with the ongoing Syrian civil war across the border.  Meanwhile, political acrimony and in-fighting \nmeant that successive rounds of voting in the presidential contest had ended in failure.  So even without a \nsuccessor to President Michael Suleiman decided to take the executive office of the presidency, there would now \nbe a lengthy delay until a fresh mandate could be democratically decided as regards the legislative branch of \ngovernment.\n\nAt the parliamentary level, elections would decide the composition of the \"Majlis al-Nuwab\"/ \"Assembl\u00e9e Nationale\" \n(National Assembly) -- a unicameral body where 128 seats  are allocated on the basis of regional and sectarian \naffiliation. Christian and Muslim sects are equally represented. Within the two religious groupings, seats are also \nallocated to various sects, such as Druze, Greek Orthodox, Shi'a and Sunnis.\n\nThe previous elections  took place on June 7,  2009.  The two main factions contesting those  elections were the \npro-Western \"14 March Coalition\" (made up of Future movement, Progressive Socialist Party, Christian Lebanese \nForces and Christian Phalangist party) and the Hezbollah-led bloc(composed of  Hezbollah, Amal movement of \nSpeaker Nabih Birri, and Free Patriotic Movement of Michel Aoun).\n\nOn election day in 2009, turnout was close to 55 percent -- the highest level of voter participation since the 1975-91 \ncivil war.  Former United States President Jimmy Carter led a team of international monitors who concluded that the \nvoting took place in a free and fair manner.  The contest was a reflection of the ongoing power struggle between the \nLebanon's governing pro-Western coalition and the Hezbollah-led bloc on the other side of the equation.  The two \nsides have been deadlocked in a political battle for supremacy for several years.\n\nAfter the voter were counted, it was clear that the ruling pro-Western coalition would retain its majority in the 128-\nmember parliament.  The actual official results indicated that the pro-Western coalition won 71 seats and the \nHezbollah bloc secured 57 seats.  With these results  confirmed, the pro-Western coalition actually increased its \nparliamentary representation and consolidated its political power.\n\nBut the pro- Western government of Prime Minister Hariri enjoyed its ascendancy only until January 2011 when it \ncollapsed after the Hezbollah faction withdrew from the unity administration,  making way for Hezbollah-sanctioned \nNajib Mikati to take on the role as the new prime minister.\n\nAs noted below, Mikati resigned in 2013 due to disagreements with Hezbollah (his one time ally) over an electoral \nlaw.  He was replaced ultimately by Tammam Salam -- a moderate independent and the son of former Prime \n\n\n\nMinister Saeb Salam.  The new prime minister  was something of a consensus selection, as he won the support of \nboth the pro-Western March 14 bloc and the Hezbollah-controlled March 8 alliance.\n\nMeanwhile, in March 2013 -- ahead of Mikati's resignation and his replacement with Salam -- Prime Minister Najib \nMikati and President Michel Suleiman  signed a decree calling for parliamentary elections to be held in June  2013.  \nBut at the end of May  2013, just one month ahead of the vote, Lebanon's parliament  voted to again postpone the \nparliamentary elections  due to security concerns over the ongoing conflict in neighboring Syria,  and a failure to \nfind consensus on the  aforementioned electoral law.  Members of parliament thus extended their mandate until \nNovember 2014.\n\nIn October 2014, with the November 2014 election timeline looming just ahead, a decision was made to postpone \nthe elections even further --  until 2017. This decision was made in response to the political instability and \nsectarian conflict, which were only aggravated by the ongoing Syrian civil war crisis.  The new 2017 schedule for \nelections would mean that the current parliament would serve eight years before being subject to election once \nagain.\n\nIn the first week of November 2014, Lebanon's parliament made the decision to postpone the next elections \nofficially by voting to extend its own  mandate until 2017.  The move had been criticized by observers, with even \nthe  head of Lebanon's Maronite Christian community, Patriarch Beshara al-Rai, as well as the European Union \nnoting that it was likely an unconstitutional move.\n\nIt should be noted that while there would be no new parliament until 2017,  Lebanon was already without a new \npresident.  The process for electing a new president had been going on for months without resolution due to \ncontinuing political acrimony between the two main political factions.  Thus, there was a growing call for the \nschedule for the parliamentary elections to be linked with a provisions requiring a president to first be elected.\n\nWhy is this election -- and the news of its postponement -- important?\n\nThe decision by the Lebanese parliament to delay the elections  was a significant move.  Indeed,  it was the first \ntime since the end of the Lebanese civil war in 1990 that members of parliament have chosen to effectively \npostpone elections and recalled that dark chapter in Lebanon's history.  Of particular concern was the growing \ninvolvement of Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon in the Syrian conflict, battling to support Syrian President Bashar \nal-Assad.  The cross-border interactions of Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Syria have had a long and enduring \nimprint on the Lebanese political scene.\n\nIn 2005, former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri -- a noted politician with an anti-Syrian orientation -- was \nassassinated.  Hezbollah and Syria have long been suspected of perhaps playing a role in that act. Hariri's \nassassination gave rise to short-term transformation when Lebanon's Cedar Revolution swept pro-Western and \nanti-Syrian factions to power at the polls later that year, along with the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon \nafter a three-decade long presence in that country. While the Cedar Revolution was viewed as the dawning of a \nnew day in Lebanon, the aftermath was not so pleasant. Political stability devolved, as exemplified by a spate of \npolitical assassinations, which were blamed on pro-Syrian elements. As well, Lebanon was the main venue of \nviolent conflict during the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel. In recent times, the country has been caught in a \npolitical deadlock and intransigence, largely due to prevailing acrimony between pro-Syrian/pro-Hezbollah factions \nand pro-reform/Western-backed members in the Lebanese parliament. The ascendancy of Hezbollah as the \ndominant power in Lebanon since 2011 and well into 2014,  as well as Hezbollah's involvement in the Syrian war \nacross the border, in many ways suggested that the progress of the Cedar Revolution had been reversed.\n\n\n\nExchange of fire between Israeli forces and Hezbollah leaves two Israeli soldiers and a peacekeeper dead\n\nIn the worst eruption of violence between Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah since the 2006 war, Israeli forces \nand Hezbollah fighters exchanged fire at the end of January 2015,  leaving two Israeli soldiers and a Spanish \npeacekeeper dead. The two Israeli soldiers died  when Hezbollah fired five missiles at a convoy of Israeli military \nvehicles along the border with Lebanon.  The Spanish  peacekeeper, who was serving as part of a United Nations  \nmonitoring mission in southern Lebanon died when Israel responded to the assault by Hezbollah with artillery fire \nand air strikes.  Hezbollah wasted little time claiming responsibility for the eruption of violence, saying that its attack \non Israel was carried out in retaliation for an Israeli air strike in southern Syria that killed an Iranian general and \nseveral members of Hezbollah weeks earlier.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised retribution, \nsaying \"Those behind the attack today will pay the full price.\"  Across the border in Lebanon, supporters of \nHezbollah in southern Beirut shot gunfire into the air in celebration of the killing of the Israeli soldiers.  But other \nresidents of the city were preparing to evacuate Beirut in the event that Israel made good on its promise of \nretribution, and with the memory of the devastation associated with the 2006 war still fresh in their memories.  That \nbeing said, with an election in Israel looming ahead, there was deep skepticism that Netanyahu would pursue a \nmilitary effort against Hezbollah anytime soon.\n\nForeign relations note related to Syrian civil war:\n\nIn mid-May 2015, the pro-Assad Syrian military, backed by the Lebanon-based militant based entity, Hezbollah, \nappeared  to be preparing for a major offensive in the border area between the two countries.  For some time, \nHezbollah -- an ally of the Alawite Assad regime -- has been backing President Assad in Syria,  and bolstering the \nfight against Sunni rebel groups (many of them of the extremist Islamist type, such as al-Nusra Front)  with whom \nthe regime has been ensconced in a civil war since the start of the Arab Spring in 2011. Now, however, with the \nSunni Islamist rebel groups gaining strength in the region, and with the Qalamoun mountains becoming a \nstronghold for Sunni militants and terrorists,  joint Syrian military and Lebanese-based Hezbollah forces were \nadvancing on the area. Their aims were to regain control  in  strategic areas, such as  Assal al-Ward and Qarna \nHeights, and to cut off a major supply route for weapons and militants.  It should be noted that some anti-Hezbollah \npolitical factions in Lebanon have decried the operation, warning that it will stimulate violence within Lebanese \nborders.\n\nIslamic State claims responsibility of attack in Beirut; Lebanon increasingly becoming a flashpoint in Syrian crisis\n\nOn Nov. 12, 2015,  two suicide bombings rocked the Lebanese capital city of Beirut killing at least 40 people and \ninjuring up to 200 more victims.  The body of a third suicide bomber who had not yet detonated the explosives \nstrapped to his body was also reported at the site of the carnage.\n\nIt was the worst episode of terrorist violence in Lebanon since the time of that country's civil war.\n\nThe attacks occurred in a southern suburb of Beirut known to be a stronghold of Lebanon's Shi'a Islamic militant \ngroup, Hezbollah.  According to reports from the ground, the attacks were carried out in succession by  suicide \nbombers at the  Mansur shopping plaza and at a storefront in Burj al-Barajneh.\n\nBecause the bombings occurred in an area known to be controlled by Hezbollah, and because that Shi'a Islamic \nmilitant group has been heavily involved in supporting Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, all expectations were that \nthese attacks were carried out by Sunni Islamists opposed to Assad.\n\nIn recent times, there have been several terror attacks in Lebanon, most of which have been linked with Hezbollah's \nactive military engagement in Syria on behalf of Syrian President Assad.\n\n\n\nWhile there was no shortage of extremist Islamist groups opposed to Assad  operating in Syria, and they have \ncertainly  spread over the border into Lebanon,\n\nsuspicions in this case quickly rested on actors aligned with  the notorious terror group, Islamic State.  The Islamist \nterror group itself soon confirmed these suspicions by disseminating a claim of responsibility.\n\nNote:\n\nCollectively, the recent violence in Lebanon has highlighted the increased Sunni-Shi'a tensions plaguing the entire \nregion of the Middle East, with particular attention to Syria, which was in the throes of its ongoing civil war, and with \nspillover violence in neighboring countries like Lebanon.\n\nThe civil war raging in neighboring Syria has increasingly included the involvement of Hezbollah, exacerbating the \nSunni-Shi'a sectarian conflict plaguing the Middle East, with Syria and -- increasingly -- neighboring  Lebanon at the \ncenter of that conflict.  To that latter end, thanks to the active involvement of Lebanon-based Hezbollah in the \nSyrian crisis, there has been a countervailing  plague of sectarian violence in the streets of Lebanon.  Sunnis \naligned with the opposition in Syria have railed against Hezbollah's alignment with the Assad regime in Syria.\n\nIn the Syrian civil war, the rebel groups have not been united.  Some groups have been aimed at overthrowing the \nAssad regime from office for political reasons, while other Sunni extremist groups have also sought to oust the \nAssad regime but for more ideological (read: sectarian) reasons as they oppose the Shi'a elite that has long ruled \nSyria.  In Lebanon, those dynamics were playing out in similar form.  Some Sunni enclaves were simply \nsympathetic to the rebel movement in Syria and opposed to Hezbollah.  Meanwhile, some Sunni factions were \nbeing motivated by religious extremist ideology to use tactics of terrorism.  Of particular note was the November \n2015 bombings in a southern suburb of Beirut for which the notorious terror enclave, Islamic State, claimed \nresponsibility.\n\nRenewed effort rises to find consensus on a president and end Lebanon's political stalemate\n\nFor two years, Lebanon has been without a president.  Typically, the  president in Lebanon  is elected by the \nNational Assembly for a six-year term and may not serve consecutive terms.  In accordance with the 1943 National \nPact, the president is supposed to be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister is to be a Sunni Muslim, and the \npresident of the National Assembly is to be a Shi'a Muslim. This means that Lebanon's president is the only non-\nMuslim head of state in the Arab world amidst a system of pluralistic religious representation. There is also \nsupposed to be some transfer of powers from the president to the prime minister and cabinet.\n\nAn election was to be held in 2014 when the term of outgoing President Michel Suleiman ended.  However, to date, \ndespite successive attempts to elect his Christian successor, there has been no consensus in filing the post with a \nconsensus candidate.  As a result, Lebanon has been mired by a continuing power vacuum.\n\nBy January 2016, there were new political alliances being formed with an eye on finally inaugurating a new head \nof state;  however, those political alliances remained complicated and potentially contradictory.  It was to be seen if \nan end to the political stalemate would in  the immediate offing.\n\nIn an additional political development, parliamentary elections in Lebanon had been postponed.  In October 2014, \nwith the parliamentary elections  looming just ahead, a decision was made to postpone the elections even further --  \nuntil 2017. This decision was made in response to the political instability and sectarian conflict plaguing Lebanon, \n\n\n\nboth of which were only exasperated by the ongoing Syrian civil war crisis.  The new 2017 schedule for elections \nwould mean that the current parliament would serve eight years before being subject to election once again.\n\nIn the first week of November 2014, Lebanon's parliament made the decision to postpone the next elections \nofficially by voting to extend its own  mandate until 2017.  The move had been criticized by observers, with even \nthe  head of Lebanon's Maronite Christian community, Patriarch Beshara al-Rai, as well as the European Union \nnoting that it was likely an unconstitutional move.\n\nThe decision by the Lebanese parliament to delay the elections  was a significant move.  Indeed,  it was the first \ntime since the end of the Lebanese civil war in 1990 that members of parliament have chosen to effectively \npostpone elections and recalled that dark chapter in Lebanon's history.  Of particular concern was the growing \ninvolvement of Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon in the Syrian conflict, battling to support Syrian President Bashar \nal-Assad.  The cross-border interactions of Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Syria have had a long and enduring \nimprint on the Lebanese political scene.\n\nOf course, as discussed here,\n\nwhile there would be no new parliament until 2017,  Lebanon was already without a new president.  The process \nfor electing a new president had been going on for some time without resolution due to continuing political \nacrimony between the two main political factions.  Thus, there was a growing call for the schedule for the \nparliamentary elections to be linked with a provisions requiring a president to first be elected.\n\nBy  December 2015, former Lebanese prime minister and opposition leader Saad al-Hariri expressed support for a \npower-sharing solution that could potentially end the political stalemate that had left Lebanon without a president \nfor close to two years.  Hariri backed the candidacy of  Suleiman Franjieh, a Maronite Christian who was a stalwart \nof Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, for the role of president.  Of note was the fact that the Hariri political family \nhas long been opposed to Syrian influence in Lebanon, which made the notion of consensus seem remote.  \nNevertheless, productive discussions between Hariri and Franjieh appeared to herald a breakthrough of sorts,  in \nwhich both politicians agreed to \"proceed on the joint path for the election of the president.\"\n\nThis breakthrough was made official in mid-December 2015 when Franjieh said that he would contest the \npresidency of Lebanon. Objections from other political players on the scene, such as  Michel Aoun and Samir \nGeagea, both of whom had their own personal presidential ambitions, promised to complicate the situation.\n\nThat complication was manifest when in the third week of January 2016 Geagea said that he was backing  Aoun for \nthe presidency.\n\nSince Gaegea was actually aligned with the March 14 alliance of Hariri, his shift to the Aoun camp was a significant \ndevelopment and suggested something of a political re-alignment.  According to  Geagea, his backing of Aon was \ndue to his desire to rescue the country from its political paralysis and return Lebanon to what he called  \" a normal \nlife.\"\n\nIn mid-February 2016,  Hariri made it clear that he retained his support for Franjieh for the presidency.  Hariri's \ncontinued commitment to  Franjieh  was made clear in his statement that read as follows: \"We have a commitment \nand our commitment to Suleiman (Franjieh) is clear.\"  This stance emphasized the reality that the political \nlandscape in Lebanon in February 2016 continued to be marked by stalemate.\n\nHezbollah commander killed in Damascus\n\n\n\nIn mid-May 2016,  the top military commander of the Lebanon-based  and Iranian-backed Shi'ite extremists group, \nHezbollah, was  killed in an explosion close to the Syrian capital of  Damascus.  The elimination of Mustafa \nBadreddine appeared to be a targeted strike and there was little doubt about the fact that it was a blow to the \nleadership of Hezbollah.  There was no official acknowledgment of who might be responsible for the strike; \nhowever, all expectations were that Israel was likely behind it, although, as expected,  Israel offered no comment.  It \nshould be noted that the United States government had long believed\n\nBadreddine to be responsible for Hezbollah's military operations in Syria where a civil war has been ongoing since \n2011.  Badreddine was actually sentenced to death in 1983 in Kuwait for his role in  a bombing,  After  escaping \nprison in Kuwait  in 1990 when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, he has gone on to be a terror orchestrator.  Of \nparticular importance is the fact that he was one of five Hezbollah members indicted by the United Nations-backed \nSpecial Tribunal for Lebanon with regard to the 2005 assassination of prominent pro-Western politician, Rafik al-\nHariri.\n\nLebanon set to finally elect a president thanks to PM deal\n\nIn October 2016, Lebanon was preparing to end its impasse on electing a new president.  For two years, Lebanon \nhas been in a state of stalemate for over the presidency with no agreement on a Maronite Christian candidate to fill \nthe position, as set forth in the 1943 National Pact.  While Micheal Suleiman's mandate expired in 2014, a two year \npower struggle between the pro-Western and Hezbollah-dominated blocs prevented any consensus form being \nreached.  Finally, an agreement appeared to have been reached to elect Michel Aoun -- a Hezbollah ally \u2014 as the \npresident, with Saad al-Hariri \u2014 of the pro-Western coalition \u2014 heading a new government as prime minister.\n\nBy November 2016, Hariri had been asked to form a government, after he won a parliamentary vote of confidence, \nwhich included support from Parliamentary Speaker Nabih Berri, who had initially opposed the deal.\n\nNote: In Lebanon, the president is elected by the National Assembly for a six-year term  and may not serve \nconsecutive terms.  In accordance with the 1943 National Pact, the president is supposed to be a Maronite \nChristian, the prime minister is to be a Sunni Muslim, and the president of the National Assembly is to be a Shi'a \nMuslim. This means that Lebanon's president is the only non-Muslim head of state in the Arab world amidst a \nsystem of pluralistic religious representation. There is also supposed to be some transfer of powers from the \npresident to the prime minister and cabinet.\n\nMystery surrounds Lebanese prime minister's apparent resignation and exit \n\nThe political scene in Lebanon was rocked in the first week of November 2017 when Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri \nwas reported to have resigned from office. The move also resulted in the collapse of the ruling coalition \ngovernment, which included both Hariri's pro-Western bloc, as well as Hezbollah.  The fall of the coalition \ngovernment effectively triggered a political crisis.  \n\nDays later, Saudi-owned al-Arabiya television reported that Hariri had been received by Saudi King Salman in \nRiyadh.  For his part, Hariri said in a televised speech that he had resigned out of fear that he would be \nassassinated.  Hariri also accused Iran and its Lebanon-based ally, Hezbollah, of being behind a plot to stir chaos \nin the Arab world. In the background was an accusation from the Hezbollah leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, that \nSaudi Arabia had forced Hariri to step down.\n\nHariri's accusation was regarded as fuel for a brewing sectarian chasm between Sunni and Shi'ite  countries in the \nMiddle East. That schism was already in place with an ongoing rivalry between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Iran, \n\n\n\nwhich was being played out in Yemen, but which was also being manifest in other countries such as Syria, Iraq, and \nBahrain.\n\nWith the governing scene in a state of turmoil in Lebanon, President Michel Aoun held an emergency meeting \nwhich was attended by security officials and cabinet ministers from the collapsed government. He urged national \nunity, stability, and calm, also indicating that he would take no measures until Hariri returned from Saudi Arabia.  \n\nThe next development was more ominous as the newspaper al-Akhbar, a Hezbollah-linked publication in Lebanon, \nreported that Hariri was being held in Saudi Arabia under house arrest.  That claim was at odds with a report from \nthe prime minister's office, which indicated that Hariri was in the United Arab Emirates. Meanwhile,  Saudi Foreign \nMinister Adel Jubeir said the newspaper report was \"nonsense\" and Hariri was free to leave at any time.  Saudi \nmedia also broadcast footage of Hariri's meeting with King Salman and reported that the Lebanese politician had \ndeparted Saudi Arabia for the United Arab Emirates.  Furthermore, more than a week later, Hariri addressed the \nmatter himself, saying via Twitter: \"To say that I am held up in Saudi Arabia and not allowed to leave the country is \na lie.\"\n\nBy mid-November 2017, Hariri was in the French capital of Paris meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nFrom Paris, Hariri announced that he would be returning to Lebanon in time for the country's  Independence Day \ncelebrations and  would, at that time, explain his status.  Hariri said, \"As you know I have resigned, and we will \ndiscuss that in Lebanon.\"\n\nPrimer on 2018 parliamentary elections in Lebanon\n\nParliamentary elections were set to take place in Lebanon on May 6, 2018 -- several years after they were due to \nbe held.  The last elections were held in 2009 and were to be followed by polls in 2013.  However,  the elections \nwere postponed due to disagreements over electoral law,  and rescheduled to be held in 2014. A further \npostponement  due to regional unrest set the election date for 2017 -- but December 2017 passed with no elections \nbeing held.  Finally, in May 2018 after nine years, the Lebanese people would get the chance to make their \ngoverning choice known.\n\nAt stake would be the composition of the \"Majlis al-Nuwab\" / \"Assemblee Nationale\" (National Assembly)  -- a \nunicameral body where 128 seats  are allocated on the basis of regional and sectarian affiliation.\n\nSince the civil war that lasted from 1975-1990, power in Lebanon is split according to sectarian lines.  The president \nis always a Maronite Christian, the prime minister is always a Sunni Muslim, and the parliament speaker is always a \nShi'ite.  In parliament,  Christian and Muslim sects have been equally represented. Within the two religious \ngroupings, seats are also allocated to various sects, such as Druze, Greek Orthodox, Shi'a and Sunnis.\n\nIn 2009, the two main political blocs were the March 8 block made up of  Hezbollah and its allies and the pro-\nWestern March 14 bloc made up of Saad al-Hariri and his allies.  As of 2018, Hariri was the head of government \nthanks to a government formation deal in2016 that made him prime minister in exchange for Hezbollah ally, Michel \nAoun, becoming president.\n\nIn 2018, voting would take place under a new and complicated structure in which voters would choose both a \nfavored party list and a preferred candidate from it, in accordance with a proportional system.\n\nOn election day, voters in Lebanon had gone to the polls and made their voice heard at the ballot box.  There were \nno results immediately available. However, Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, a Sunni Muslim, was expected to form \nanother unity government that would include  Iran-backed Shi'ite movement Hezbollah.\n\nWeeks later, President Michel Aoun announced that Saad al-Hariri had been designated to become prime minister \nand form a government.\n\n\n\nHariri has been  Lebanon's most well known  Sunni  politicians since 2005 when his father, Rafik Hariri was \nassassinated.  That event set the path for the country's Cedar Revolution, which ended Syria's overt influence in \nLebanon's political scene. The assassination of the older Hariri has remained a keystone event in Lebanon, \nespecially since a United Nations-backed court charged members of Hezbollah for his assassination.  At the helm \nof the pro-Western bloc in parliament, Hariri has continued to fight against the influence of Hezbollah's political \nwing in Lebanon, which is backed by Syria and Iran. The Syrian civil war has exacerbated those tensions.  His ties \nwith Saudi Arabia have raised eyebrows, especially when he was reported to have resigned and trapped in Saudi \nArabia.  But French intervention appeared to have helped Hariri return to Lebanon and retract the questionable \nresignation. \n\nEditor's Note:\n\nSince the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri -- a noted politician with an anti-Syrian \norientation -- Lebanon has slowly retrenched into a state of dissonance. The period saw short-term transformation \nwhen the Cedar Revolution swept pro-Western and anti-Syrian factions to power at the polls later that year, along \nwith the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon for a three-decade long presence in that country. While the \nCedar Revolution was viewed as the dawning of a new day in Lebanon, the aftermath was not so pleasant. \nPolitical stability devolved, as exemplified by a spate of political assassinations, which were blamed on pro-Syrian \nelements. As well, Lebanon was the main venue of violent conflict during the 2006 war between Hezbollah and \nIsrael. In recent times, the country has been caught in a political deadlock and intransigence over presidential \nsuccession, largely due to prevailing acrimony between pro-Syrian/pro-Hezbollah factions and pro-reform/Western-\nbacked members in the Lebanese parliament. The establishment of the May 2008 Doha Agreement was intended \nto end the political impasse and move the country forward. The opening of corresponding embassies in Beirut and \nDamascus in 2009 was viewed as a step not only towards positive bilateral engagement, but also towards greater \nstability in Lebanon.  However, the collapse of the unity government at the start of 2011, the May 2011 attack on \nUnited Nations peacekeepers, and the June 2011 appointment of a Hezbollah-dominated government, together \naugured further instability in Lebanon. The assassination of the Lebanese  internal intelligence chief, Wissam al-\nHassan in 2012 re-opened old wounds, as they stoked the memories of the assassination of Rafik Hariri, ultimately \ndeepening the political cleavages between pro-Syrian and Hezbollah factions on one side, and the pro-Western \nopposition on the other.  The ascendancy of Hezbollah as the dominant power in Lebanon since 2011 and well into \n2013,  as well as Hezbollah's involvement in the Syrian war across the border, in many ways suggested that the \nprogress of the Cedar Revolution had been reversed. The postponement of the 2013 elections as a result of the \ninvolvement of Hezbollah in the Syrian conflict across the border only underlined the turbulence that characterizes \nthe Lebanese political landscape in recent times.  It was to be seen if the formation of a joint pro-Hezbollah and \npro-Western government, headed by a consensus prime minister, would stabilize Lebanon and set it on the path to \nelections  in 2014 (now delayed from 2013).  However ongoing cross-over violence from the Syrian war meant that \nthe election would be further delayed until 2017.  Meanwhile,  Lebanon's failure to elect  consensus president after \na 2014 deadline passed was a sign that the political arena was dominated by dissonance.\n\nIn 2015, Lebanon continued to be plagued by cross-over violence from the Syrian civil war.\n\nAn agreement was made in 2016 for the establishment of a new president followed by long-awaited parliamentary \nelections in 2018; it was hoped that this political consensus would stabilize the country, at least domestically.\n\n-- June 2018\n\nWritten by Dr. Denise  Coleman, Editor in Chief, CountryWatch.com.
