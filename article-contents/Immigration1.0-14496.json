{"title": "OUR PICKS Exhibition Open ...", "body": "\n Opening Friday at the International Gallery of the Smithsonian's S. Dillon Ripley Center, \"Dreams and Reality: \nContemporary Korean-American Art\" marks the centennial of Korean immigration to the United States with an \nexhibition including one art-world superstar (video artist Nam June Paik), several far-from-household names (Po \nKim and Chong Gon Byun, for instance) and local lights Y. David Chung and Taek Lee, who organized the 17-artist \nsurvey. Call 202-357-2700 (TDD: 202-357-1729). \n\n-- Michael O'Sullivan \n\n So many good movies this weekend! Kevin Costner's \"Open Range,\" which includes great performances from \nRobert Duvall and Annette Bening, is the best Hollywood western since \"Unforgiven.\" (Review on Page 33.) Alan \nRudolph's \"The Secret Lives of Dentists\" is a wry dramedy about a dentist (Campbell Scott) who believes his wife \n(Hope Davis) may be having an affair. (Review on Page 33.) And \"Mondays in the Sun,\" Spain's Oscar submission \nfor Best Foreign Film last year, has an extraordinary performance from Javier Bardem. (Review on Page 34.) \n\n -- Desson Howe \n\nA nice way to remember the late Barry White would be to go see Memphis soul legend Isaac Hayes, the other great \ndeep-voiced soul survivor of the '60s and '70s. After all, Hayes landed the job of Chef on \"South Park\" only because \nWhite turned it down. Think \"Shaft\" and \"Hot Buttered Soul,\" and on Sunday, head to the Birchmere for one of the \nbiggest old-school soul revues still on the road. Call 703-549-7500.  -- Richard Harrington \n"}
