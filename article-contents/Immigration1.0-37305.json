No chancellor in Germany has ever been able to rule against \nhis or her own party for long.'\n\nOne of Merkel's most prominent critics, Bavarian governor Horst Seehofer said: 'The central reason (for the losses) \nis refugee policy - there is no point in talking past it.\n\n'The answer to the population after such an election result cannot be that everything continues as it was.' \n\n                       GERMAN ELECTION RESULTS: HOW CDU LOST TWO OUT OF THREE STATES                                        \n\nSaxony Anhalt\n\nCDU 29.8%\n\nAfD 24.2%\n\n\n\nLeft 16.3%\n\nSPD 10.6%\n\nOthers 7.1%\n\nGreens 5.2%\n\nFDP 4.9%\n\nRhineland Palatinate\n\nSPD 36.4%\n\nCDU 31.8%\n\nAfD 12.4%\n\nFDP 6.1%\n\nGreens 5.2%\n\nOthers 5.2%\n\nLeft 2.9%\n\nBaden Wurttemberg\n\nGreens 30.3%\n\nCDU 27%\n\nAfD 15.1% \n\nSPD 12.7%\n\nFDP 8.3%\n\nOthers 3.7%\n\nLeft 2.9%\n\nWhile Sigmar Gabriel, Merkel's vice-chancellor, insisted the CDU would not change their stance on immigration.\n\n'There is a clear position that we stand by: humanity and solidarity,' he said. 'We will not change our position now.' \n\nFrauke Petry, who leads the Eurosceptic AfD party, has suggested German border guards should open fire on \nillegal immigrants.\n\nAustria's far-right Freedom Party hailed the AfD's success as a win against the 'EU juggernaut.' \n\nMrs Merkel's welcome for arrivals from Syria, other parts of the Middle East and North Africa, has caused chaos \nacross the continent. Initially, the incomers were greeted by crowds of well-wishers.\n\nBut, faced with the sheer numbers, public opinion soured. And there was outrage when gangs of migrant men were \ninvolved in organised sex attacks on women in Cologne and other cities on new year's eve.\n\n\n\nOne by one, EU states have thrown up border fences to stop the flow of arrivals - leading to the slow collapse of the \nSchengen passport-free zone.\n\nAustria is one of several countries to limit numbers in defiance of Brussels.\n\nMrs Merkel, who has failed to win support for a Europe-wide quota system to share out refugees, last week \nmasterminded a deal for Turkey to take back migrants landing in Greece.\n\nIn return, Ankara would be handed up to \u00a33.9billion, EU countries would accept quotas of Syrian refugees from \nTurkey and all 75million Turkish citizens would be allowed visa-free travel around continental Europe.\n\nOn Thursday Mrs Merkel insisted that imposing a limit on refugee numbers was a 'short-term pseudo-solution' and \nthat only a 'concerted European approach' would bring down numbers.\n\nGermany has attempted to return economic migrants to 'safe' countries such as Albania, Kosovo and Montenegro \nbut still risks being overwhelmed.\n\nLast night millions of voters showed they have lost faith in the chancellor's policies.\n\nResults showed the AfD had won 24 per cent of the vote in the eastern state of Saxony Anhalt, finishing third.\n\nThe party fares better in former Eastern Germany where scepticism of liberal refugee policies is stronger.\n\nBut its double-digit score in two other states, Rhineland and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, was potentially more significant.\n\nThis suggests middle-class voters are deserting the Christian Democrats and other establishment parties.\n\nBaden-W\u00fcrttemberg, which is home to Porsche and Daimler, was won by the Green Party. Mrs Merkel's CDU lost a \nlarge slice of its vote in its former stronghold, plunging to a historic low of 27 per cent.\n\nAfD has seats in five regional parliaments and in the European Parliament.\n\nBut its huge gains on 'Super Sunday' will reinforce fears that Germany is shifting to the right after decades of \nmiddle-of-the-road consensus politics following the Nazi period.\n\n                       FAR RIGHT PARTY MAKES GAINS IN GERMANY: WHO ARE THE AFD?                                         \n\nGermany's AfD - Alternativ f\u00fcr Deutschland - started out at as an anti-EU, anti-euro party sceptical of the power of \nBrussels and the 'superstate' project beloved of most of the Fatherland's citizens.\n\nIts destiny was almost certain to be that of a protest party until the refugee crisis came along and propelled it on to \nthe national stage in a way no-one predicted.\n\nFounded in 2013 with the intention of ending bailouts for poor southern EU countries, it focused on criticizing the \ngovernment's immigration policies last year and has not looked back.\n\nAfD is seen by many in Germany to be linked to Pegida, a xenophobic movement which draws thousands onto the \nstreets of the city of Dresden every Monday. \n\nCritics refer to Pegida as 'Nazis in pinstripes' - an allusion to the middle-class disaffected voters it is drawing into its \nranks.\n\nThe current leader of AfD is an East German-born female scientist. But the parallels with Angela Merkel end there. \n\nFrauke Petry believes that German police should 'if necessary' shoot at migrants seeking to enter the country \nillegally. \n\n\n\nShe was lambasted for saying so in January but a poll found nearly 30 percent of the electorate agreed.\n\nMrs Petry, 40, took over as party chief in July 2015 after an internal power struggle that saw the party's co-founder \nand first leader, Bernd Lucke, ousted. \n\nUnder Mrs Petry AfD has moved to the right and shifted focus from eurozone issues to migration.\n\nIt became the first anti-euro party to win seats in a German regional parliament - in Saxony in 2014 - and went on to \nwin seats in four other states' parliaments. \n\nIts latest big win makes it more powerful than ever.\n\nThe tabloid Bild newspaper ran the headline yesterday 'AfD shocks Germany!'.\n\nLast night Mrs Petry, who chairs AfD, said: 'We are seeing above all in these elections that voters are turning away \nin large numbers from the big established parties and voting for our party.'\n\nShe said voters expected AfD to offer 'the opposition that there hasn't been in the German parliament and some \nstate parliaments'.\n\nThe far right victory came despite attacks by leading establishment politicians.\n\nMrs Merkel described AfD as a 'party that does not bring cohesion in society and offers no appropriate solutions to \nproblems, but only stokes prejudices and divisions'.\n"}
