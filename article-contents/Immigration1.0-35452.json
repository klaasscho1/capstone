More than 100 Border Patrol agents were rushed to San Diego in early March when apprehensions in the \nTijuana zone rose 49 percent over a year ago. The increase in border traffic has been attributed to Mexico's \neconomy and the lure of jobs in California.\n\nBecause of the action by 569 agents along a 12-mile stretch here, other areas are seeing an increase in traffic, Mr. \nSmithburg said.\n"}
