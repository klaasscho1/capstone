Dick \nDurbin (D-Ill.), who introduced the so-called \"Dream Act,\" told his Senate colleagues.\n\nIn a speech on the Senate floor, Durbin cited Vargas, 26, as an \"exceptionally gifted young man\" who is being \nbarred from serving his adopted country because he is an undocumented immigrant.\n\nLast night, Vargas, who was on Capitol Hill yesterday to witness the vote, vowed to keep fighting until the legislation \nis passed.\n\n\"Most people say that we were destroyed, but now we've got to turn up the volume,\" Vargas said. \"We're ready to \ngo for the next battle.\"\n\nVargas and his parents illegally immigrated to the United States from Mexico when he was 5 years old.\n\n\"Actually, I consider myself a Brooklyn-born-and-raised American,\" Vargas said.\n\nHe graduated with honors from Brooklyn's James Madison High School, earned an undergraduate degree from St. \nFrancis College in Brooklyn Heights and is in his third and final year at CUNY Law School.\n\nVargas said his dream is to become a military lawyer in the Marines or an intelligence officer.\n\n\"But the military does not accept individuals without legal status. So that is essentially the roadblock,\" Vargas said.\n\nwhutchinson@nydailynews.com\n\nGraphic\n\n\n \n\nBrooklyn law student Cesar Vargas, speaking on Capitol Hill yesterday, vows to keep fighting until he can serve in \nmilitary.
