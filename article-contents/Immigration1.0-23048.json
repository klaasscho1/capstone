{"title": "Community forum on Norristown immigration act", "body": "\nA community forum will be held Sunday in Norristown to discuss recently enacted ordinances that bar \nundocumented immigrants from renting living space or holding jobs in Bridgeport, Montgomery County. The \nmeeting, to be held at 1:30 p.m. at St. Patrick Church, 714 DeKalb St., is sponsored by the Fair Housing Council of \nMontgomery County.\n\nElizabeth Albert, its executive director, said the purpose was to point out \"concerns we have\" about the Illegal \nImmigration Relief Act passed Oct. 24 by the borough's council. The law makes it a crime for a landlord to rent to \nan illegal immigrant or for an employer to hire a worker without documentation. A second ordinance gives the \nborough's police force and code officers power to enforce the measures.\n\nBonnie L. Cook\n"}
