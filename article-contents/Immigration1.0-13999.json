The additional teams will be assigned to states \nwith relatively large immigrant populations, including Georgia.\n\nThe effort focuses on the estimated 80,000 criminals who, by federal law, were supposed to have been removed \nfrom the country after serving their prison time. Hutchinson said the failure to deport these felons has been \"a \nhistoric problem\" for the federal government, which has not systematically monitored the nation's prisons and jails.\n\nMichael J. Garcia, acting director of the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said that before the law \nwas tightened in 1996, felons who had aggravated offenses and who had served their prison time could be set free \non bail, pending their deportation orders. Many then skipped bond and are still missing, Garcia said.\n\nThe new focus on criminal fugitives is not the first such campaign. The immigration service released a now nearly \nforgotten \"most wanted\" list of criminal immigrants a decade ago. That campaign made little headway and \ndisappeared by the mid-1990s.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of people who have taken flight after being ordered out of the country has steadily grown.\n"}
