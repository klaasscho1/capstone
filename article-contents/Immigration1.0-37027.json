Russian planes dropped leaflets on Grozny Monday, \nwarning residents and rebels to flee or ''be considered terrorists and bandits'' and ''be destroyed by artillery and \naviation.''

Scientists say the technique, which stimulates production of the pigs' growth hormones, would be a boon for \nlivestock farmers and eventually could even be used to treat children with growth problems and to prevent muscle \ndeterioration in AIDS and cancer patients. The key to the new technology is a synthetic chemical that's inserted into \na biodegradable piece of DNA, then injected into the leg of a 2-week-old pig. The chemical in turn causes the pig's \npituitary gland to secrete higher than normal levels of growth hormone.\n\nDow Closes Down 118.36\n\nNEW YORK (AP)\n\nStocks were mixed today as investors again collected profits from last week's rally, with the Dow Jones industrial \naverage falling 118.36 to close at 11,106.65.
