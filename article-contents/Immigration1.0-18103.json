{"title": "CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES AIMED AT IMMIGRANTS", "body": "\nThe heated debate over immigration will resurface in the state Assembly this week as lawmakers consider two \nconstitutional amendments.\n\nAssemblyman Mark Wyland, R-Vista, says his proposal would discourage illegal immigration and avoid enormous \ncosts, in part by preventing illegal immigrants from receiving any health care or social services not required by \nfederal law.\n\nThe other constitutional amendment, by Assemblyman Ray Haynes, R-Temecula, would create the California \nborder police, a force of about 1,500 to 2,000 officers who would supplement federal border police and enforce laws \nthat bar employment of illegal immigrants.\n\nNotes\n\nSTATE NEWS IN BRIEF\n"}
