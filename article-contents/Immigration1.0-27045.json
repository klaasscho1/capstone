{"title": "Owners Warned Over Pro-Immigrant Sign; Manassas Threatens Legal Action if Noncompliance Continues", "body": "\nThe owners of a pro-immigrant sign at 9500 Liberty St. might face more legal woes if they fail to respond to a \nsecond letter sent by Manassas officials, which says they are continuing to break city codes and ordinances.\n\nOn July 11, a letter was sent to property owners Delia Alvarez and Gaudencio Fernandez stating that conditions \nand activities observed on their property violated provisions of the city's zoning ordinance.\n\nViolations included parking cars on the grass and using the property as a camp site.\n\nThe letter said that it was not the first time the owners had been warned or told that they needed a special-use \npermit if they planned to continue holding public gatherings on the property, which is zoned residential.\n\nIf the owners fail to comply with the \"notice of violation and order of correction,\" the letter said, further legal action \nwill be taken. The owners have 30 days to appeal the notice.\n\nThe city also sent a letter to the owners May 15.\n\nFernandez said he opened the property up last week to a group of Native Americans who were walking across the \ncountry to raise awareness about how they are treated. The group, which was part of the Longest Walk 2, wanted \nto show support for the 12-by-40-foot sign that denounces the treatment of immigrants by Prince William County \nand Manassas. Fernandez declined to comment further, citing pending legal issues.\n\nFernandez and Alvarez are to appear in Prince William General District Court in September.\n\nManassas officials said that Fernandez failed to get a building permit before fortifying the sign in October and that \ntrash and debris remain on the property. Both violate local regulations.\n\n"}
