{"title": "TIME FOR STATE TO PUT UP THE NO-VACANCY SIGN", "body": "\nLeon Panetta's article on immigration (\"Don't expect bailout to fill 'immigrant gap,' \" Commentary, June 7) should \nmake Californians want to scream for immigration reform.\n\nSome examples: Panetta never answers or even hints at the big question.\nHow can individual states be forced to pay enormous sums to finance federal immigration policy? California has 30 \nmillion people. Our schools are going broke. We have terrible problems with health care, housing and water. We \nhave a multibillion-dollar debt. Does Panetta really believe it's fair that California is being slammed by 450,000 new \nimmigrants yearly?\n\nPanetta states: \"We shouldn't tolerate people immigrating illegally.\" If citizens shouldn't tolerate illegal immigration, \nthen why shouldn't Californians be furious at being forced by the feds to spend billions on government services for \nillegal immigrants?\n\nPanetta implies that lottery tickets purchased by illegal immigrants should be credited against what California \nspends on them.\n\nIs he joking? Even if every penny of a lottery ticket went directly to education, the average immigrant family in \nCalifornia (four children) would have to buy 55 tickets daily for 13 years to reimburse taxpayers for what they \nreceive in educational benefits.\n\nTell your representatives it's time for America to get out of the immigration business. California has neither the \nwealth nor the natural resources to absorb 38,000 new immigrants every month.\n\nIt's time to shut the door.\n\n-- Bruce Mathias\n\nAptos\n\nNotes\n\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\n\nDrawing;\n\nDRAWING:T.
