{"title": "University of Maryland Statement on Amicus Brief in Support of DACA", "body": "\nThe University of Maryland issued the following news release:\n\nThe University of Maryland has joined 164 colleges and universities across the nation to support a legal challenge \nto rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nFiled in federal court last week and coordinated by the Presidents' Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, \nthe amicus brief seeks to advocate for the rights of roughly 700,000 young immigrants to study and work in the \nUnited States under legal protection. The brief further argues that revoking DACA status for the thousands of \nstudents across private, public and community institutions is not only unethical but unconstitutional.\n\n\"As institutions of higher education, we see every day the achievement and potential of these young people, and we \nthink it imperative for both us and them that they be allowed to remain here and live out their dreams.\n\n\"Once at college or university, DACA recipients are among the most engaged students both academically and \notherwise.\n\n\"They work hard in the classroom and become deeply engaged in co-curricular activities, supporting communities \non and off-campus.\n\n\"Indeed, it defies rationality to prevent the government from utilizing its discretion to protect this set of young people \nfrom removal.\"\n\nOn Nov. 12, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments on a series of consolidated cases and \ndetermine whether the administration's rescission of DACA was lawful.\n\nDACA recipients help build and nourish Maryland's robust community, from their academic excellence in research \nand science to their entrepreneurial and industrial spirit through business and the arts. The university will continue \nto identify avenues for offering support to our DACA students and advocate for a restoration of their legal \nprotections.\n\nThis brief is filed on behalf of the following 165 institutions of higher education located in 32 states and the District \nof Columbia:\n\nAdler University\n\nAgnes Scott College\n\nAlamo Community College District\n\n\nAmerican University\n\nAmherst College\n\nArizona State University\n\nAugustana College\n\nAustin Community College District\n\nBarnard College\n\nBeloit College\n\nBenedictine University - Mesa\n\nBerklee College of Music\n\nBoston University\n\nBowdoin College\n\nBrandeis University\n\nBryn Mawr College\n\nBucknell University\n\nCalifornia Community Colleges Board of Governors\n\nCarleton College\n\nCarnegie Mellon University\n\nCase Western Reserve University\n\nChristian Brothers University\n\nClaremont Graduate University\n\nClaremont McKenna College\n\nColby College\n\nColorado Mountain College\n\nColorado State University System\n\nColorado State University\n\nColorado State University-Global\n\nColorado State University-Pueblo\n\nColumbia College\n\nConnecticut College\n\nConnecticut State Colleges &#38;
