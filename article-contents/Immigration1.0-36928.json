{"title": "EIGHT CHINESE PERFORMERS MAY WANT POLITICAL ASYLUM", "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Eight Chinese performers have been missing for a week since they left a group \nreturning to China, but U.S. immigration officials said Tuesday no one had contacted them on behalf of the \nentertainers.  ''All I can tell you is they haven't walked into this office and applied for any relief,'' said David Ilchert, a \nspokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\nFour other Chinese citizens have chosen to defect in San Francisco since the June 4 crackdown on pro-democracy \ndemonstrators in Beijing.  If the eight entertainers who fled the Kun Opera company last week seek political \nasylum in the United States, it would be the largest single defection of Chinese citizens since the 1950s.  The \nperformers left the 28-member opera over a two-day period last week while the company was in San Francisco en \nroute to Shanghai following a series of performances in the United States.  The opera company flew back to \nShanghai on Sunday, according to Officer Larry Higgins, coordinator of VIP travel at San Francisco International \nAirport.  A spokesman for the Chinese consulate confirmed the eight performers did not leave with the company.  \n''They were influenced by people with ulterior motives,'' said spokesman Wang Shaohua.  The missing entertainers \ninclude Hua Wen-yi, a famous opera singer in Shanghai. Two other singers in the group, Chen Tong-shen and \nZhan Ping-ping, also are well known in Shanghai. Zhan is a famous television and film star as well as an opera \nperformer. The others were identified as Qui Huan, Chen Chi-ping, Ma Xin-bao, Peter Chong and Lou Sei-long.\n"}
