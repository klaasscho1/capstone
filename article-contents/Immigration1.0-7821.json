{"title": "SHOOTING SUSPECT CALLED XENOPHOBIC;MAN LINKED TO 5 PITTSBURGH DEATHS WAS TRYING TO FORM A POLITICAL PARTY", "body": "\nThe man arrested in a killing spree that left three immigrants, a Jewish woman and a black man dead had a history \nof mental illness and irrational fears that he was being watched, a former friend and his attorney said Sunday.\n\nPolice searching the home where Richard Scott Baumhammers, 34, lived prior to Friday's attacks also found a \nthree-page manifesto indicating he was trying to form a political party opposed to immigration, the Pittsburgh \nPost-Gazette reported.\n\nThe document, which included Baumhammers' signature as \"chairman\" of the Free Market Party, advocated the \nrights of European Americans and denounced Third World immigration, according to a prosecution source the \npaper declined to name.\n\n\"From what I saw and from what I read, it seemed to advocate violence,\" the source said.\n\nInvestigators reconstructing Friday's trail of death believe Baumhammers walked into his neighbor's house and \nfatally shot Anita Gordon, 63, a Jewish interior designer. They believe he then drove to her synagogue and fired at \nthe front doors.\n\nPolice say Baumhammers also shot up the doors of another synagogue, shot and wounded one man and killed \nanother at an Indian grocery, killed a Vietnamese delivery driver and a Chinese manager at a restaurant, and \ngunned down a black man at a suburban karate school. Officers eventually cornered him about 20 miles from the \nfirst attack.\n\nBaumhammers has been charged in one death, that of 22-year-old karate student Garry Lee. More charges are \nexpected this week.\n\nBaumhammers' attorney, William Difenderfer, said Sunday that his client has a history of mental illness, though he \nwouldn't elaborate.\n\n\"It is way too early to say anything,\" he said.\n"}
