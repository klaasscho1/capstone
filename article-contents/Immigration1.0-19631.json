{"title": "IMMIGRATION PROTEST: 'Let us live in dignity'; Thousands rally against new bills cracking down on illegals", "body": "\nThey came waving U.S. flags, wearing white T-shirts and chanting for dignity.\n\nAnd many of the illegal immigrants who marched from the shadows by the thousands Monday came with \nsomething else in common: a Gwinnett address.\n\nJuan Ballesteros of Lawrenceville and 10 family members from Gwinnett said they wanted to make their presence \nfelt by participating in the 3-mile march through DeKalb County that started and ended at the Plaza Fiesta shopping \ncenter on Buford Highway. Ballesteros, a clothing factory worker who has lived in the country illegally for eight \nyears, held a sign that read \"Awaken Giant.\"\n\n\"We have been working quietly in this country,\" Ballesteros, 38, said. \"But when they called us criminals, they woke \nus up.\"\n\nThe protest, one of several around the country, was part of a national \"Day of Action.\"\n\nThe U.S. House has passed a bill that would make being in the country illegally a felony and would fund \nconstruction of a barrier along much of the Mexican border. Supporters say the legislation would make America \nsafer and help cut the flow of illegal immigrants, whose numbers are estimated at more than 11 million nationally \nand between 250,000 and 800,000 in Georgia.\n\nThe Georgia Legislature last month approved a measure that, if signed by Gov. Sonny Perdue, would crack down \non illegal immigrants and those who hire them. The bill would require state and local agencies to verify the legal \nstatus of adults applying for taxpayer-provided services in Georgia. It also would remove tax breaks for anyone who \nemploys undocumented workers.\n\nDora Aguirre, a real estate agent from Dacula, had both those measures --- HB4437 and SR529 --- crossed out on \na placard that read \"We Love the USA. Let us Live With Dignity.\" Aguirre, who is originally from Colombia, said \nthat although she's in the country legally, some of her family members and friends are not.\n\n\"Those bills are an insult to them,\" she said.\n\n\nThe measures also are an attack on Aguirre's bottom line. She caters to home-buyers from Latin America, many of \nwhom have put a hold on plans to buy a house in order to gauge the political climate in Georgia. \"Right now, they \ndon't want to invest money in a house here,\" she said. \"They live in fear.\"\n\nAguirre said she arrived at 9:30 a.m. and had no problem parking at a nearby Kroger shopping center on Clairmont \nRoad. But for those who arrived a little later for the 10 a.m. march, parking was scarce.\n\nJose Antonio Moreno said he and about 20 friends and relatives from Norcross had to walk about an hour just to \nreach Plaza Fiesta. But he made the most of it once he got there.\n\nMoreno wore a golden Aztec costume with a large headdress, and stood at the center of a circle of people after the \nmarch, calling out chants to the crowd. First everyone chanted, \"USA! USA!\" Then someone yelled \"Viva Pancho \nVilla!\" calling for cheers for the hero of the Mexican Revolution. That led to a spontaneous recital of the song \n\"Mexico Lindo y Querido,\" whose lyrics loosely translate as: \"If I die far from you [Mexico], just say that I am \nsleeping and bring me back here.\"\n\nBut the symbol that outnumbered all others at Monday's protest was the American flag. Luis Hernandez, a 20-year-\nold graduate of Norcross High, was among those waving the Stars and Stripes. \"This says we're all created equal,\" \nsaid Hernandez, a house painter originally from Mexico City.\n\nThe protest seemed to have a modest effect on businesses in Gwinnett, which had a Hispanic population of more \nthan 105,000 in 2004, the largest in Georgia, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nNora Vazir, who owns a Subway restaurant in Norcross, had trouble keeping up with sub orders Monday because \ntwo of her Mexico-born employees were attending the march. During the lunch rush, the line stretched out the door \nof the restaurant near Buford Highway and Jimmy Carter Boulevard. \"A few people came up to the door and walked \naway,\" Vazir said.\n\nAn Indian immigrant, Vazir said she didn't have a strong personal opinion about the protest. But she respected the \ndecision of her workers, who are in the country legally. \"What could I do?\" she asked. \"They are my good \nemployees. They never miss a day of work.\"\n\n--- Staff writer Mary Lou Pickel contributed to this story.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPhoto: JOHN SPINK / StaffThousands of Hispanics gathered at Plaza Fiesta on Monday to protest against stricter \nimmigration laws.\n\nPhoto: JOHN SPINK / StaffMayde Erez (above) from Mexico watches the march down Dresden Drive on Monday.\n\nPhoto: JOHN SPINK / StaffThe Rev.
