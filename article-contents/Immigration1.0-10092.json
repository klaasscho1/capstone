{"title": "REPORT CITES DANGER OF BORDER CRACKDOWN", "body": "\nA congressional report says the U.S. government's 7-year crackdown along the Southwest border has served \nmainly to steer undocumented migrants to dangerous mountains, deserts and rivers but produced no persuasive \nevidence that illegal entries have fallen across the 2,000-mile boundary.\n\nThe assessment is included in an annual evaluation of the border strategy by the General Accounting Office, the \ninvestigative arm of Congress.\nThe report said that while arrests have plummeted to record lows in some formerly troubled areas, such as San \nDiego, overall arrests on the border rose between 1994 and 2000.\n\nThe clampdown, which began in October 1994 has been extended to cities in Arizona and Texas that are hot spots \nfor illegal crossings. Migrant smugglers have adjusted by taking back-country routes.\n\nNotes\n\nCALIFORNIA & THE WEST\n\nIN BRIEF\n"}
