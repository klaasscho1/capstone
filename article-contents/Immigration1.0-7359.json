{"title": "H-1B VISAS APPROACHING BRIM OF CAP", "body": "\nDemand for coveted work visas reserved for high-skilled immigrants has been so strong that the annual ceiling on \nthem is about to be reached only five months into the fiscal year, immigration officials said Wednesday.\n\nAs of Feb. 15, about 67,000 of the H-1B petitions were approved by the Immigration and Naturalization Service for \nthe fiscal year, agency officials said.\nThere are about 44,000 more petitions pending with the INS, meaning up to 111,000 may already be accounted for. \nThe cap for the number of H-1B visasthat can be distributed between Oct. 1, 1999, and Sept. 30, 2000, is 115,000.\n\nThe strong demand for the visas is a reflection of the booming high-tech industry in the United States in recent \nyears. Of about 134,400 H-1B visas distributed between May 11, 1998, and July 31, 1999, about 53 percent of \nthem were given to immigrants filling system analyst or programmer jobs, according to an INS estimate. And 47.5 \npercent of those were distributed to people from India.\n\nThe H-1B visa is valid for three years and is renewable only once for another three-year period. The cap was first \nreached three years ago, when the ceiling was 65,000. Since then, legislation has increased the cap temporarily to \n115,000 last year and this year and to 107,500 next year, before returning to 65,000.\n\nBut there has been a slew of new legislation proposed by Republican congressmen to increase the cap or to get rid \nof it altogether.\n"}
