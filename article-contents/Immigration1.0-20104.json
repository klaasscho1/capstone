The poll's margin of error is +/{ndash}3 percentage points.\n\nThe new recording of the national anthem is part of an album called Somos Americanos (We Are Americans), set \nfor release May 16. Part of the CD's $10 price will go to pro-immigration organizations.\n\nProducer Adam Kidron has said he wanted the new recording of the anthem to honor America's immigrants. \nHowever, the release has generated strong opposition, including from President Bush, who was asked about it last \nweek and said, \"People who want to be a citizen of this country ought to learn English, and they ought to learn to \nsing the national anthem in English.\"\n\nPoll respondents largely agreed with Bush on the anthem, but they were not in sync with his policies on \nimmigration.\n\nNearly two-thirds -- 64% -- disapproved of Bush's immigration policy; 26% approved. Bush wants tougher border \nenforcement, an expanded \"guest worker\" program and a way, yet to be specified, to allow illegal immigrants \nalready in the USA to become citizens.\n"}
