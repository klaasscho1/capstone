Some members of the Council have repeatedly \nspoken against the law since its enactment, and several marched with immigrants-rights activists and thousands of \nprotesters on May 1 in downtown Los Angeles to oppose the law. The Council has asked officials for the city's \nport, airport and utilities to review all contracts with companies based in Arizona. \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
