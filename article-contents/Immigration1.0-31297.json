{"title": "JUDGE HALTS IMMIG PROBE SEZ WORKERS' STATUS IRRELEVANT", "body": "\nA MANHATTAN judge quashed subpoenas the city issued to a consulting firm - and slammed investigators for \ngrilling workers about their immigration status.\n\nJustice Barbara Jaffe said she found evidence employees of Future Technology Associates were harassed by the \nschool system's special commissioner of investigation.\n\nShe approved a motion by FTA to toss the city's subpoenas, calling them \"fishing expeditions.\"\n\nThe city launched a probe of the Department of Education's contract with FTA in 2009 after Daily News columnist \nJuan Gonzalez raised questions about the Florida firm's use of foreign workers here on non-immigrant visas.\n\nFTA lawyer Jim Walden argued the city probers couldn't ask the workers about their immigration status under an \nexecutive order signed by Mayor Bloomberg that prohibits such questioning.\n\nThe judge did not rule on whether the questions violated the law, but was skeptical the questions were relevant.\n\n\"There is considerable doubt as to whether the inquires into immigration status have a reasonable relationship to \nwhat is allegedly being investigated,\" she wrote.\n\nIn a sworn affidavit, Walden said a high-ranking lawyer in the special commissioner's office declared: \"Immigration \nis a central part of this investigation. Get used to it.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for special commissioner Richard Condon declined to comment yesterday.\n\nFTA, which currently has a three-year, $43.2 million contract with the Education Department, has denied any \nwrongdoing in connection with the visas.\n\njmarzulli@nydailynews.com\n"}
