{"title": "Complexities of Visas", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\n\"Workers, and Bosses, in a Visa Maze\" (April 29), spells out clearly the problems plaguing the H-1B visa program \nthat brings skilled foreign workers to the United States for up to six years.\n\n     But the program was conceived and expanded to benefit high-technology companies in this country, which cited \na shortage of qualified American workers. \n\n It was not devised to benefit foreign workers, many of whom are being harmed by the law's complex provisons.\n\nMost of the program's problems stem from a desire to ensure that no American workers are available for these jobs \nbefore allowing foreign workers to be hired.\n\nForeign workers in the H-1B visa program find that obtaining permanent residency can take some time, especially if \nthey come from countries like India, which generates large numbers of foreign workers and produces a long waiting \nlist.\n\nThis wait means the workers can be committed to one company, with restricted opportunities to advance or change \njobs.\n\nSTEPHEN NORDLINGER\n\nChevy Chase, Md., April 29\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
