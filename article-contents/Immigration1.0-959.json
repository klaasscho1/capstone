{"title": "CUBAN FEES IRK U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT", "body": "\nThe State Department may ask Cuban authorities to reduce the $ 750 in fees collected from Cubans leaving the \ncountry.\n\nBefore leaving, each Cuban must pay $ 400 for a medical examination, $ 100 for a passport and $ 250 for an exit \npermit.\nThe head of Cuba's diplomatic mission here, Fernando Remirez, said in an interview that the services provided are \nexpensive but added that the $ 750 in fees was 15 percent less than what Cuban citizens previously paid.\n\nU.S. officials will raise the issue when the two countries open another in a series of migration talks today in New \nYork.\n\nAlso on the table during two days of talks will be the fate of about 1, 200 Cubans who arrived in the United States \nduring the 1980 Mariel boat lift and who remain in federal detention centers.\n\nSuccessive administrations have maintained that these Cubans are not entitled to settle in the United States \nbecause of criminal records, but Cuba has refused to take them back.\n\nUnder an agreement reached last year, the United States promised to grant immigrant visas annually to at least \n20,000 Cubans. The flow of Cuban immigrants has been orderly since then, but U.S. officials are irritated by what \nthey consider exorbitant service charges imposed by the Cuban government.\n\nRemirez also chided the United States for limiting opportunities for Cuban-Americans to travel to Cuba. He said a \nmore flexible Cuban policy has permitted more than 100,000 Cuban-Americans to visit the island since 1985.\n\nSince May, the United States has deterred Cubans from fleeing by forcibly returning all boat people picked up by \nthe U.S. Coast Guard. As of last week, 131 Cubans had been returned, officials said. About a dozen have been \ndetained in Cuba.\n"}
