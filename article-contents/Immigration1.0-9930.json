{"title": "Our electoral system is dangerously broken; LETTER OF THE DAY: PERSONAL INTEGRITY Letters writeback@belfasttelegraph.co.uk Letters to the Editor, Belfast Telegraph, 33 Clarendon Road, Belfast BT1 3BG", "body": "\nTHE prorogation shambles has highlighted the weakness in our constitution: we're constantly just a hair's breadth \nfrom chaos.\n\nAnd the gentlemen's agreements that hold our fragile democracy together are often only as good as the paper \nthey're (not) written on.\n\nThe rusted levers of our democracy are long overdue an upgrade. Take the Lords: the fact that over half our \nParliament is unelected ignores the voice of voters. And Westminster's undemocratic voting system leaves millions \nof voters ignored at every election.\n\nThe winner-takes-all mentality of first-past-thepost elections encourages parties to ignore everyone except the base \nthey need to win. It's no surprise our politics is so polarised and toxic.\n\nCountries with fairer electoral systems see cross-party collaboration not as a betrayal but as something essential for \nthe common good.\n\nWe can no longer avoid discussing how to reform our broken system. It's now time to set out a positive path for how \npolitics works via a \"constitutional convention\" of citizens.\n\nWe can all agree that power is too distant, out-oftouch and centralised. Now, we urge all parties to back the \nElectoral Reform Society and others' call to do what's right and work together to find a way forward.\n\nDARREN HUGHES Chief executive Electoral Reform Society Please note that letters should be short and to the \npoint. Letters will be edited as deemed necessary and should be authenticated with a full name and postal \naddress, not necessarily for publication. A daytime telephone number would also be useful.\n"}
