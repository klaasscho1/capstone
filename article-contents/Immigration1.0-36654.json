{"title": "Ersatz Refugees", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\nYour idea to offer ''emergency protection to a national group whose homeland is racked by armed civil conflict, \nenvironmental disaster or other 'extraordinary and temporary conditions' '' is seriously flawed (''Make America a Fair \nSafe Haven,'' editorial, June 29).\n\nAny national from a country certified under your proposal would be eligible for admission, whether or not that \nindividual was actually in distress.\nAt some point, legitimate refugee claimants would be displaced by ersatz refugees, including economic migrants, \nthus undermining the very premise of humanitarianism and fairness on which your proposal is presumably based. It \nis precisely to defend the interests of genuine refugees that the Refugee Act of 1980, which your proposal would \neffectively supercede, provides for case-by-case adjudication.\n\n''Safe haven'' would involve millions of people if admissions criteria were broadly construed. Imagine, if you will, \noffering safe haven to the victims of a flooded Yangtze River, earthquakes in Mexico, Ecuador and Italy, a volcano \nin Colombia, a typhoon in Ceylon, the conflicts in Lebanon, El Salvador, Northern Ireland, the Philippines, South \nAfrica and Sri Lanka, to name but a few. After they had been afforded ''temporary'' safe haven, what would be their \nincentive to leave, and how would their departure be enforced? If you have the answers, you're way ahead of the \nState Department and the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n\nYour ''safe haven'' notion is a dangerous, ill-conceived and superfluous idea that if enacted will harm many of the \npeople it purports to serve, not the least of whom are the American people.\n\n \n\nROGER CONNER\n\n   Executive Director, Federation\n\n   for American Immigration Reform\n\n   Washington, June 30, 1987\n"}
