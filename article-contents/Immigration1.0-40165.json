{"title": "NEW AMERICAN ARTISTS AS IN THE PAST, IMMIGRANTS ENRICH U.S. ARTS SCENE", "body": "\nCALIFORNIA art and nature lovers know the majestic western landscapes painted by Albert Bierstadt, but many \ndon't know he was an immigrant. Willem DeKooning pioneered abstract expressionism, and Marcel Duchamp did \nthe same for modern art.\nThey too were immigrants.\n\nOn the Commentary Page to the right are the words of current immigrant artists who have a show at De Anza \nCollege in Cupertino. They have lots to say about leaving home and finding refuge and freedom, but also \ndiscrimination and identity crises, in America. They are mostly optimistic, which, when you think about it, is the word \nthat best describes the immigrant in history.\n\nToo often, Americans describe immigrants as a threat and a burden. They usually are proven wrong. For example, \nmany post-colonial Americans feared German immigrants never could adapt to democracy and would turn \nAmerica into a militaristic society, an idea that seems ridiculous now.\n\nSubsequent waves of immigrants through the 1940s came to the United States to escape genocide, jihad and \nrepression. Then opportunity beckoned to artists when the creative and financial center of the art world switched \nfrom a shattered Europe to New York.\n\nSome of today's immigrant artists seek refuge from harsh regimes. Others simply seek their artistic fortunes. Past \nimmigrant waves were largely European. This one is Asian, Latin American and African, but the idea that \nnewcomers see with fresh eyes remains valid.\n\nAmong them may be the next Bierstadt. Or maybe not. It doesn't matter. They will contribute in positive ways to art \nand to America.\n\nNotes\n\nEDITORIALS\n"}
