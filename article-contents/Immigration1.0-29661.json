{"title": "Under God ELIZABETH TENETY, EDITOR; Blogging on religion, government and politics", "body": "\n Gays, like everyone else, are created in God's image \n\n      In Genesis 1:26-28, God creates humanity \"after our likeness,\" and so humanity, male and female, is created in \nGod's own image. . . .\n\nSo, we need to ask ourselves in what way are gay men, lesbians, bisexuals or transgendered people not in the \nimage of God in this interpretation of the text? How are gay people deficient in being creative, engaging the world, \nother humans and, most important, God, and the God-given work of caring for all living things? . . .\n\nThere is no \"wrongness\" in being gay in the Christian perspective, not because DNA evidence tells us that being \ngay is very likely rooted in one's genetic code, but because gay men, lesbians, bisexuals and transgendered people \nare created in the image of God. In the Christian theological perspective they are fully and completely human \nbeings in their relationship with other humans and the God who created them.\n\n -- Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite, professor, Chicago Theological Seminary \n\nStaff writers Michelle Boorstein and William Wan and \"On Faith\" editor Elizabeth Tenety blog regularly on \nreligion, politics and policy at http://washingtonpost.com/onfaith.\n"}
