So if people can take their seats, we'll start in about one minute.\n\nOh, good morning everyone and welcome to the September 13th meeting of the Investor Advisory Committee. \nBefore I turn it over to recognize the Chair and some the other Commissioners to make some comments, I want to \nsee who we have on the telephone from the Committee. Is Elisse on the phone?\n\nWALTER: I am.\n\nSHEEHAN: Great. Paul Mahoney, are you with us?\n\nMAHONEY: Yes, I am.\n\nSHEEHAN: Good morning. Bill Lee, are you also participating by phone? Not yet.\n\nAnd, Barb Roper, are you on by telephone? All right. Is there -- is there anyone else on the phone who wants to be \nrecognized before I turn it over to the Chair for some opening comments? All right.\n\nHOLMES: Anne, this is Stephen. Also I'm on the video conference.\n\nSHEEHAN: Okay. Stephen Holmes is also on. Okay, great. All right. Thank you all.\n\nSo, Chair Clayton, good morning. Nice to see you.\n\nCLAYTON: Great to see you. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I want to welcome our -- or should I say \nwelcome back Commissioner Elad Roisman. It's your first Investor Advisory Committee meeting.\n\nElad was confirmed just last week as the 98th Commissioner of the SEC. We met many years ago when you first \nworked at the Commission. And I am certain that Elad will again make a lasting contribution to the work of the \nCommission. Thank you for coming back. Congratulations.\n\nTurning to today's business, I'm delighted that the Committee will focus this morning on our proxy voting \ninfrastructure. We recently announced the staff will hold a roundtable on the proxy process later this fall. It is clear \nto me that accuracy, transparency and efficiency in the proxy system both and still and are critical to confidence in \nour shareholder governance process.\n\nIn 2010, the Commission -- I haven't got to the good part yet.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nIn 2010, the Commission issued a concept release that solicited feedback on the proxy process. A lot has changed \nin our market since then, and I commend you for taking the time this morning to discuss how the proxy voting \ninfrastructure could be modernized or improved.\n\nIn the afternoon you will discuss the Commission's proposal to conduct a transaction fee pilot and NMS stocks. The \npilot is designed to generate data to help us meaningfully analyze the effects of exchange fees and rebates on \n\n\n\norder routing behavior, execution quality and our market structure generally. In my view, a pilot of the type \nproposed should provide the Commission with data that will help us make better informed and effective policy \ndecisions. I look forward to hearing your perspectives on the proposal and any recommendations you may have in \nthis area.\n\nFinally, the schedule for this afternoon also includes a discussion of the growth of passive investing and its \nimplications. Many say that passive investing provides a low-cost, low-maintenance way to obtain diversified \ninvestment exposure.\n\nA meaningful portion of market commentators also point to benefits of active management. Market analysts also \nposit that risks may be amplified as a result of concentration in passive strategies, and there are questions around \nhow passive funds should approach engagement with companies on the one hand and engagement with their \ninvestors on the other hand. This issue also applies to funds that are actively managed and may dovetail with your \nproxy process discussions of the morning. In short, I commend you for having a connected agenda.\n\nI hope you approach these issues, as I try, to with a view toward what is best for the long-term interests of our retail \ninvestors. For example, those who are investing monthly in their retirement accounts to fund expenses that may be \nyears away.\n\nYou have an interesting impact agenda ahead of you. Before I let you get on with it, I want to thank all of you for \nyour service to the Committee. You have very busy schedules, yet you take substantial time to share your \nknowledge and expertise for the betterment of investors and our markets.\n\nAlso, I have a -- a supplement to my remarks that I will put in the area of being FD-compliant. This morning I issued \na statement reiterating, and the statement is similar to statements issued by my colleagues at other financial \nregulators reiterating that SEC staff use are nonbinding and create no enforceable legal rights and obligations. My \nstatement also notes an ongoing effort by our divisions and offices to review prior staff statements and documents \nand consider whether they should be modified, rescinded or supplemented in light of market or other \ndevelopments.\n\nAlso, this morning in connection with this review in the upcoming roundtable on proxy process, the Division of \nInvestment Management issued a statement withdrawing two 2004 letters, one to Egan-Jones Proxy Service and \none to Institutional Shareholder Service. The Egan-Jones letter is a May 27, 2004 letter, the Institutional \nShareholder Services, Inc. letter is a September 15, 2004 letter.\n\nI look forward to continuing to discuss these topics. And as noted, the staff is having a roundtable on these issues, \nand I look forward to -- I have some of my commissioners here. I can say this in an open forum the Commission \nengaging on these topics and moving forward in light of our current market structure.\n\nThank you, Anne.\n\nSHEEHAN: Great. Thank you, Chair Clayton.\n\nCommissioner Peirce, good morning. Nice to see you.\n\nPEIRCE: Good morning. Nice to be here. Thank you all for being here. I want to welcome Commissioner Roisman \nwho, I think, you all find to be a wonderful advocate for investors. I look forward to working with them. And I'm sure \nthat we will benefit greatly from his wisdom.\n\nI want to thank you all for your efforts through the -- through the time between meetings, which is evident in the \nagenda that's before us today. It looks like a very useful agenda for informing us as well as you, so I look forward \nto the discussions and thank you for being willing to brave the hurricane to -- to travel to be here. Thanks very \nmuch.\n\n\n\nSHEEHAN: Thank you. And, Commissioner Roisman, welcome. We're happy to have you with us as the Chair and \nCommissioner Peirce said welcome to the Commission.\n\nROISMAN: Still need to learn how to push the button.\n\nSHEEHAN: Yeah, you're Okay.\n\nCLAYTON: It's not in the training manual.\n\nROISMAN: Yeah, it really isn't.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nThank you everyone and good morning. I wanted to go, first of all, thank both Chairman Clayton and Commissioner \nPeirce for their kind introductions. Thank you all for being here. As I'd like to echo their sentiment as well, I know \nyou guys all have day jobs and really appreciate you volunteering and sharing your thoughts, experiences and \nwisdom. I look forward to today's discussions, and I look forward to working with you in the future.\n\nSHEEHAN: Thank you. And the other two, I know Commissioner Stein is on her way. So, at some point, we'll get \nopening comments from her and Commissioner Jackson will be joining us, I think, around the 10 o'clock hour, so \nwe'll also have the opportunity to hear from him.\n\nSo, Chair Clayton, I appreciate the heads up -- ooh, there she is.\n\nSTEIN:t Hello.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSHEEHAN: Your -- your timing is perfect. This is good. So good morning, Commissioner Stein. Despite the \nhurricane you get to where -- yeah, the traffic in D.C. I remember that from my days here, yeah. So good morning. \nWelcome.\n\nSTEIN: Thank you. Am I actually supposed to be speaking now?\n\nCLAYTON: I -- I can -- I can take up ...\n\nSTEIN: Did you do your ...\n\nCLAYTON: ... I can take up some time while you're ...\n\nSTEIN: ... did you do introductory remarks?\n\nCLAYTON: I did do and -- and you're -- you're next, but I -- I -- I should have said this in my remarks and did not. I \nhave looked down through the panelists we have today and it's -- it's -- it's truly an extraordinary group. So I -- I \nknow some of you and -- well, I know some of you for a long time and know some of you more recently. And I \ncongratulate the Committee for having such a -- such excellent panelists here. So I hope you aren't about to say \nthat.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSTEIN: No, but I'm going to second that. I want to welcome everybody to today's Advisory Committee meeting. I \nassume that you welcomed our new commissioner.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBut I would also like to welcome our new Commissioner, Commissioner Roisman to his first Investor Advisory \nCommittee meeting. And I'm going to do my normal -- I really, really do appreciate how busy you all are and how \n\n\n\nmuch time you take out of very busy schedules to do this pro bono. So thank you again to all of you for coming and \n-- to Washington and spending time with us.\n\nI'm really excited about today's panels and the morning panels focusing on shareholders in public companies, in \nparticular, and how they can exercise their vote. The proxy process allows investors to make important decisions \nabout the corporations they own, such as electing directors who represent their interests and making their views \nknown on a number of matters that affect companies. I think that's a two-way street. The companies also, by putting \nthings on the agenda, now are able to get information from their investors about the direction of the company.\n\nYet, the proxy process is far from ideal. I think, for me, one of the things that's come home is despite dramatic \nadvances in communications and technology, it's -- it's still service downing to me that shareholders who physically \ngo to meetings have greater sort of rights and opportunities than those who vote by proxy. Shareholders who do \nnot attend meetings, which includes a vast majority of institutional and retail investors may vote using proxy cards \nthat often do not list all of the board nominees or all of the people running for the board. And I think this is a \ndistinction that should not exist in the digital age where people can attend all sorts of events virtually.\n\nIn fact, in some countries such as Estonia, you can even vote in government elections from almost any place in \nthe world. I was talking to someone who is Estonian and he voted from Australia. in his Estonian government \nelection on his cell phone.\n\nRecognizing this disparate treatment, the Commission proposed amendments to its rules to allow universal proxy \ncards. This has been about two years ago. Under this proposal, all investors will be treated the same regardless of \ntheir geographic location. Unfortunately, it's, as I said, a couple of years since the proposal went out and the \nCommission has not yet had the opportunity to vote on the final rule, I think it is time for the Commission to move \nforward on this issue. And I certainly would love to see Chairman Clayton do so.\n\nAnother topic for this meeting is how we can harness the power of innovation to strengthen the means by which \nshareholders and corporations communicate. Block chain technology offers new possibilities to maximize \nshareholder engagement to the benefit of both companies and its investors. The proxy process can also be \nimproved by focusing on the so-called plumbing. There's no question that a proxy system is inefficient and it can \nlead to uncertain or erroneous results. For instance, just last year, one company's vote count swung back and forth \nfor months. We can and we must do better for our investors and for our companies. The Commission should \nembrace technology to improve the accuracy, transparency and the efficiency of the proxy voting system. In \naddition to the issues related to the proxy process, the Advisory Committee is going to hear from panelists on the \ngrowth of passive investing.\n\nOver the last decade we've seen a rapid growth in passive investing through index mutual funds and exchange \ntraded funds. The movement from actively managed investments to passive investments in both equity and bonds \nmay have long-term impacts on the securities markets. However, I think market participants and the regulators are \nstill grappling with the implications of the seismic shift.\n\nFor example, indices created today are very different than those that were created several decades ago. In fact, \nthe underlying methodologies can be incredibly complex and many providers keep their proprietary formulas \nsecretive. When complexity is combined with opacity, we must proceed with caution. We should proactively \nexamine the possible effects on both security-specific pricing and the flow of funds dynamics that may affect the \noverall marketplace if passive investing funds continue their growth trajectory.\n\nAs always, I look forward to hearing from you today and thank you.\n\nSHEEHAN: Thank you, Commissioner Stein. Thank you all. And we also are looking forward to the panels today.\n\nAnd I think, Chair Clayton, you're right. As we put the two together, we realize there was a link between the growth \nof passive investing and the exercise of governance rights and the issues related to corporate governance in their \nvoting on the proxies.\n\n\n\nCLAYTON: Yes. And to Commissioner Stein's point and your point, today's panels are focusing on infrastructure. \nThe Division of Corporation Finance has announced these roundtables, but, you know, these are dynamic issues. \nInfrastructure and regulation go together, so people should feel free. I know this group feels free to speak its mind, \nso you should feel free to speak your mind.\n\nSHEEHAN: Thank you, thank you. And I appreciate the comments on the -- the guidance letters that you took \naction on. I mean, today our focus will be really on some of the -- the plumbing, the infrastructure issues, but I know \nthrough your roundtable and others, there's a lot of interest in the whole proxy advisory issue as well as the other \nitems, which are identified in the release in terms of announcing the roundtable. So thank you for that.\n\nBefore we get started with the first panel, we've got a couple of sort of housekeeping. So we have the minutes for \nthe Committee. You should have the minutes before you. Are there any changes, edits to the minutes? If not, we \nwill entertain a motion.\n\nWe have a motion and a second? We have a second to approve the minutes. All those in favor say aye.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Aye.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Aye.\n\nSHEEHAN: Any opposed?\n\n(UNKNOWN): Aye.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Aye.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Aye.\n\nSHEEHAN: Right. All right. A little delayed, but that's good. The minutes are approved, yeah.\n\n(UNKNOWN): (Inaudible).\n\nSHEEHAN: We'll take it as an aye. I didn't hear any no, so ...\n\n(UNKNOWN): (Inaudible).\n\nSHEEHAN: A delayed yes, I guess, is still a yes. And then before I introduce the first panel, I want to recognize the \nstudents from Seton Hall who were in the audience. Seton Hall has one of the law school clinics that this \nCommittee has heard about over the past few years, so I don't know if the students would like to stand up. We want \nto welcome you to the Investor Advisory Committee.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nYeah. Welcome. Thank you for being here and joining us today.\n\nSo this morning, as the commissioners had recognized, we'll start with the first panel. As has been said, it really -- \nthe first panel -- and we have two -- two panel sessions on the topic of proxy plumbing.\n\nI am very personally very excited about this issue. From my 10 years, it stirs a lot of time and attention spent on \nproxy plumbing and the voting as a fund that own about 8,000 companies. We've spent a lot of time on proxy \nvoting. We voted probably every year over about 70,000 different issues, so a vested interest. So I can only \nimagine all of the others, some of the index funds that we've talked about and others, and the number of votes that \nwe take. So we all care very much about the proxy voting system. And the integrity of the system really goes to the \nheart of our corporate governance activities.\n\n\n\nThe owners of the companies exercising their right to vote, the companies themselves getting the input from the \nshareholders, making sure that they can conduct their meetings and that they have quorum, and that the important \nthing is that all of us who are voters feel that the votes are counted, and we understand what that process is.\n\nAs we proceed today, we'll need to ask ourselves what is it we want out of a good proxy voting process. From my \nperspective, we want transparency. We want accountability so that I know the votes are counted. We want \nhopefully efficiency so that it is easy to do and we want to be able to understand the process.\n\nI think issuers, as I said, they need to make sure that they make quorum and that they're getting the necessary \nvotes to approve their business items that they have, and that also as they need to get the vote out that they can \ncommunicate with their shareholders easily on communicating with them and sharing with them the views of \nmanagement. So we have to ask ourselves, is the current process working as was intended or are there ways that \nwe can improve it? You know, does it serve the interest of investors? Does it serve the issue -- the interest of the \nissuers? And if not, what more can be done?\n\nWe will also hear this morning from the intermediaries in this process and the critical role that they play in \nfacilitating the proxy voting process. You know, are these intermediaries working to facilitate the ease of voting \nprocess? Are they working to ensure that the -- the -- the accuracy of the vote, the efficiency of the votes and the -- \nthe whole process works smoothly.\n\nToday we'll explore some of the issues and the challenges of the proxy voting process. The -- sometimes the \nproblem of overvoting, undervoting, the champ (ph) custody issues, the vote confirmation issues in terms of the \nshareholders, making sure that their votes were counted and other items that come up as the Chair about the -- \nChair had mentioned and Commissioner Stein the issue of universal proxy also, I think, is an issue that they can -- \nwe will ask the panel to address in terms of one of the issues. I agree in terms of it seems crazy in this day and \nage that you have to actually go to -- physically to a meeting if you want to vote on vote cards or split your votes. I \nthink in this day and age there's got to be a technological solution to this, so I'm very supportive of the Commission \nmoving forward on that.\n\nAnd then the whole issue of technology, how can we use technology to improve this process. As was mentioned, \nyou know, blockchain digital ledger technology may be an opportunity for us to see as has been used in Estonia \nand some other markets. What could be done in our -- in our market to facilitate technology to make this process \nbetter?\n\nI do think the integrity of our proxy voting system is essential to a -- our good corporate governance program, so \nwe'll ask all the participants and the panelists today to see are they being served well. If not, how could we improve \nthe process? And specifically since we are at the SEC, what recommendations do you have for the Commission in \nterms of taking actions going forward? As has been said, they will be conducting a roundtable, I think, late this fall \nsometime on this issue, so I know they're very interested in hearing from the panelist today and in -- and for us \nparticipate in -- in that roundtable come late fall.\n\nSo without any further ado, let me introduce our first panelist. The Committee has the -- the complete bios of all the \nindividuals, but let me introduce them in the order by which they'll be speaking.\n\nSo Ken Bertsch is the executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, and he's been in that role since \n2016. I've known Ken in a variety of the positions that he held prior to this, both at the Society of Corporate \nSecretaries, CamberView, Morgan Stanley and others.\n\nThe second panelist will be David Katz who's a partner at Wachtell Lipton and also an adjunct professor at NYU as \nwe were chatting this morning. David and I have spent a lot of time together over the years during my time at STRS. \nAnd he's one of the great -- great corporate lawyers, I would say.\n\n\n\nThird, Brian Schorr who is the -- a partner and chief legal officer at Triumph Fund Management. Also, I had the \nbenefit and the pleasure of working with Brian during my years at CalSTRS as Brian was one of our managers who \nhave spent a lot of time, probably one of the smartest legal minds I know. So welcome, Brian.\n\nDeborah Majoras who is the Chief Legal Officer and Secretary for Procter & Gamble. She's has been with the \ncompany since 2008. Prior to that, she was here in Washington, D.C. as the Chair of the Federal Trade \nCommission and has had a long and distinguished career in government as well as in the private sector. So \nwelcome. Nice to have you here.\n\nAnd then finally, our last panelist on this first session is Arthur Crozier who is the Chairman of Innisfree, a proxy \nadvisor -- proxy solicitation firm, has been involved in, as we'll hear today, in these proxy contest and proxy voting \nfor a number of years, brings a great deal of experience to the debate.\n\nSo thank you. Ken, you will kick off the panelists, and welcome and thank you all for participating this morning.\n\nBERTSCH: Okay. Thank you, Chair Sheehan and Members of the IAC, and Chair Clayton and Members of the \nSEC. So, as Anne said, my name is Ken Bertsch. I represent the Council of Institutional Investors. We have a core \nmembership of asset owners with more than $4 trillion in assets and asset manager associate members with more \nthan 25 trillion in assets -- assets under management.\n\nSo shareholder voting at corporate annual special meetings is a core and essential element of corporate \ngovernance, as has already been mentioned this morning. And shareholders have a keen interest in a reliable, \ntransparent and cost-effective system for voting processes -- proxies. CII's asset owner members affirm this in -- \nin a 2010 statement policy statement that they voted on. And our members currently are considering further \nelaboration of that policy to urge best use of technology to improve the proxy voting process.\n\nEnhanced policy under consideration suggests it is time to look at distributive ledger technology or -- and it's all \nsorts of reasons why people say this expression you use is not exactly correct, but I -- I'll -- I would use private \nblockchains operated by a trusted third party or parties to -- to promote the goals that we have articulated earlier \nwhile safeguarding the identities, holdings and vote decisions of individual shareholders.\n\nThe current system of proxy voting is fraught with inefficiencies in a too large margin of error. Between the \ncomplexity of intermediary chains and challenges around fungible shares, many of our members lack confidence of \ntheir shares actually are always voted fully and accurately. Institutional investors generally vote on electric \nplatforms, and I think a lot of our members believe that the -- they should be able to routinely and promptly seek \nvote confirmations on how their shares are voted in an account on each voting item and the number of shares \nvoted.\n\nSince 2010, market intermediaries have worked on a system to provide vote confirmation on request, but progress \nhas been halting, and the system seems to only work when the stars are truly aligned. That is not most of the time. \nVote confirmation has not become routine, efficient or easy. So as -- as Chairman Clayton said there's been \nsignificant technological progress since 2010 and we have -- may have more opportunities to build a reliable, \ntransparent and cost-effective proxy voting system not available at that time.\n\nHowever, systemic change, potentially including distributive ledger technology, would require substantial focus and \nresources near-term. While the effort would be significant, we do think it's time to seriously explore this as I will \ndiscuss. But I do want to note that the universal proxy, Commissioner. Stein mentioned, is -- is very low hanging \nfruit.\n\nThe SEC has well considered 2016 proposal for universal product proxies already has set forth a good path for this. \nShareholders usually have no practical ability to vote through proxy voting or voting by proxy to split their ticket \nand vote for the combination of shareowner and management nominees that they believe best serve their \neconomic interests. Investors frequently have an interest in splitting their tickets, and there is no good reason why \n\n\n\nthey should be required to attend meetings to do so. Shareholder voting by proxy should have the same voting \noptions as a shareholder who votes in person.\n\nNow, Circor International, my organization, has commented extensively on this in -- in letters to the SEC, so I won't \nnot go in further except to address two points that Chairman Clayton has raised with us -- two concerns about the \nSEC proposal. The first is on the solicitation threshold that would trigger a requirement of universal proxy.\n\nThe rule is proposing 2016 would require that a dissident solicit, at least a majority of shares, for the universal proxy \nrule to kick in. We agreed with that threshold, but in light of the Chairman's concern that this may be too low, we \nwould support moving to a higher threshold that would increase minimum solicitation requirements to 75 percent \nand require that total number person solicited is -- is more than 10.\n\nI think, Chairman, you -- you talked about more people can fit around the dinner table so that we had some \ndiscussion about how may people at dinner table.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nAnyway, the second item is a concern about an incumbent director who would refuse to serve if a dissident is \nelected with -- with some of the incumbents. And we would suggest that the proposed rule be amended to require a \nregistrant to disclose in its proxy statement if a party's nominee will not serve, if elected, should -- should an \nopposing party nominee be elected and then how the resulting vacancy would be filled. So we think those two \nissues can be addressed.\n\nSo we think it's time to move ahead with this and we're -- we're glad to address any other issues that come up. We \ndo think the framework that this Commission put forward is very good, so back to the more difficult challenge of -- of \nmore robust proxies of system.\n\nSo we think blockchain should be explored. It would -- it would entail construction of the blockchain. An intermediary \nacting as a gatekeeper would create a blockchain for the company and its shareholders. The blockchain would be \nprivate in permission. Neither the company nor other shareholders would be able to see identities or holdings of \nany individual shareholder. Blockchain would record each of the company's beneficial owners and holdings as of a \nprerecorded record date and will determine each shareholders' entitlements.\n\nTwo, dissemination of proxy materials. The gatekeeper can upload the proxy materials on the blockchain.\n\nThree, vote allocation and authentification. The gatekeeper allocates votes subject to the company's capital \nstructure and voting rights. Shareholders would know precisely how many votes they control before casting them. \nBefore the meeting, whoever executes the votes, the individual shareholder or the designated proxy must \nauthenticate identity with the gatekeeper.\n\nFour, vote execution and tabulation. During the voting period, shareholders or their proxies would execute their \ninstructions over the blockchain. The blockchain would relay the voting instructions and verification that the votes \nare counted back to each shareholder, ideally providing immediate and accurate end-to-end vote confirmation.\n\nOnce the voting period ends, the blockchain can immediately -- immediately report the aggregate results to the \ncompany and its shareholders simultaneously. Due to the nature of blockchains, once voter votes are entered, the \nrecord of those votes cannot be removed or altered. Now it -- it would -- how you structure this depends on the \nroles you want to set up, but presumably, you could -- you would set it up so that there could be a revised ballot put \nthrough, but all the information would be in the blockchains, so you'd be able to confirm it.\n\nWith his approach, we think we could provide timeliness -- enhance timeliness, accessibility, accuracy, certainty \nand cost-effectiveness. And I want to emphasize, in particular, the end-to-end vote confirmation. That's probably \nthe most important step from the investor standpoint.\n\nSo with that, I'll stop and I'm glad to answer questions later.\n\n\n\nSHEEHAN: Thank you. Thanks, Ken.\n\nCLAYTON: Can I just jump in and say ...\n\nSHEEHAN: Absolutely.\n\nCLAYTON: ... thanks -- thanks, Ken, for framing those issues that were of concern to me. And to the extent people \nhave comments, I -- I would like to hear them, but, you know, basically, how many people you need to get around \nthe table to decide what the proxy is going to look like, and that ensuring that, you know, if this is what -- what's \nbeing presented that that's actually the result.\n\nBERTSCH: Right. Yeah, that's fair concerns.\n\nSHEEHAN: David?\n\nKATZ: Good morning. Thank you, Chairman Clayton, Commissioners, IAC Chairwoman Sheehan, the other \nMembers of the IAC for providing us with the opportunity to participate in today's discussion and address what we \ndo as a very important corporate governance issue that needs to be updated through SEC rulemaking. I also want \nto thank Alexander Ledbetter and the SEC staff for putting today's program together and for handling all logistics, \nincluding dealing with a pesky hurricane named Florence that threatened to disrupt today's meeting.\n\nBy way background, I'm a corporate lawyer at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz in New York City. I've been practicing \nfor over 30 years. My practice is primarily with -- involving representing public companies and boards of directors. \nAnd in recent years, a substantial amount of my time has been devoted to dealing with shareholder activist, contest \nfor corporate control and proxy contest. Thus, I have significant direct experience in navigating the many intricacies \nof the U.S. proxy voting infrastructure as well as experience with similar structures in Europe and Asia.\n\nSimply put, U.S. voting infrastructure is outdated. Similar to another issue we've addressed with Commission \nSchedule 13D that came out of the 1968 Williams Act has not kept up with market developments. I promise that \nthat'll be first and last time I mention it today.\n\nThe current proxy voting infrastructure was developed for a different era and has not been updated to address \nfundamental market and technological changes. There are two sets of laws that regulate the ability of shareholders \nto cast votes in advance of net shareholder meetings for public companies. By and large, led by Delaware, the \nstate law aspects of allowing shareholders to exercise their fundamental rights to the shareholder franchise of kept \npace with technological developments and other changes in recent years. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said \nfor the federal law aspects that regulate much of the mechanics of the proxy voting process.\n\nThis is the aspect that the SEC regulates both rules and tools that were developed long before emails, faxes, texts \nand the Internet leaving a glimmer in anyone's eyes. We'll hear from other panelists today, and Ken referred to \nsome of these already about the benefits that technology can bring to the table to address many of the concerns \nthat will be raised today. And it's my view that we need to embrace much of this technology as we revamp a \nsystem that is sorely outdated.\n\nHowever, these changes must address the interests of both the issuers and investors, including investors who are \nshareholder activists in a fair and balanced manner that provides a level playing field for all participants. It does not \ndiscriminate against any investor, be they institutional or retail. It's essential that we recognize several \ndevelopments that have occurred in recent years and take them into account as we look to develop a new proxy \nvoting regime for the 21st century.\n\nFirst, there has been a tremendous concentration in voting power of institutional investors, including passive \ninvestment such as index funds. For many public companies, this means that by talking to 20 or 30 investors or, in \nsome cases, fewer than 10, issuers and shareholder activists can talk to the whole different majority or close to \nmajority of the public company shares. This concentration in voting power has significantly lowered the cost of \n\n\n\ncommunicating, but this tends to disadvantage issuers who need to communicate with all their shareholders in the \ncontext of proxy contest.\n\nSecond, and recognizing that the Commission is already examining this issue separately, what we see is the undue \ninfluence of proxy advisory firms such as ISS and Glass Lewis to many institutional investors outsource their proxy \nvoting decisions must be taken into account. There has been a recent trend where a number of the major \ninstitutional investors have taken their proxy voting decisions back in house not without bearing non-insignificant \ncosts, but most institutional investors, you know, for cost reasons or otherwise have not abandoned the proxy \nadvisory outsourcing model. The proxy advisory firms do not provide equal access to issuers as they do for \ninvestors and they are in need of separate regulation, but their impact cannot be neglected as we look to update \nthe current voting -- proxy voting infrastructure.\n\nThird, technology has significantly lowered the cost to communicate with shareholders, especially in situations \nwhere shareholder proponents seeks to correspond with the majority of shares or issues generally need to \ncommunicate with all shareholders. This can make it significantly more expensive for public company issuers in a \nproxy contest when facing the shareholder activist. It is in the public interest to make sure that all shareholders, be \nthey large or small, active or passive is in the same information provide to other shareholders, although in practice, \nthis may be easier said than done.\n\nGiven there is significant portion of the investments managed by major institutional investors are pension or \nretirement savings, they're seeking long-term value, we need to develop a system that gives voice to those who \nwere ultimately impacted. The technology can help us achieve that so long as all the impacts of that technology, \nincluding unintended consequences are fully considered and taken into account.\n\nLet me address some of the concerns I and many of our clients have with the current proxy voting system and \ninfrastructure. Here, I would note that the interest of issue is in shareholder activists do not always diverge. We'll \nhear from Brian Schorr of Trian and Debbie Majoras of Procter & Gamble going a number of specific issues that \narose in their recent proxy contest. And you'll see that many of these concerns are shared concerns. Professors Ed \nRocks and Marcel Kahan's important article discusses many of the problems with the voting system and custodian \nissues, and also provides some thoughtful suggestions about technology and other developments that can be \nutilized.\n\nI'd also note that it's in everyone's interest that we develop a system that promotes participation and achieves \naccuracy in a sufficiently transparent manner, allows individuals and institutions to have their voices appropriately \nheard in the boardroom and beyond.\n\nShareholder communications. Simply put, we do not have a system that provides all information -- all shareholders \nwith the same information in a timely manner. It's a routine complaint that many investors, notably not the large \ninstitutional investors, receive some of their proxy voting materials after the vote has taken place. This is not just \ninternational shareholders who may be subject to the vagaries of the global postal system, but also to the inability of \ncompanies communicate directly with their shareholders. They're forced to do so through intermediaries who \nefforts, unfortunately, often fall short.\n\nTechnology should be to overcome many, if not all, of these issues so long as some the roadblocks like the \n(inaudible) Communications directly with beneficial holders are removed, making sure their votes are counted. \nThere's currently no way for an individual shareholder to make sure that their vote has been accurately and \nproperly cast and counted. This is exacerbated with the practice of share lending since generally institutions will not \nput shares that had lent out, but this can impact the beneficial owner who has no knowledge of the transaction.\n\nThe number of recent contests, institutional shareholders have ended up voting far less than the number of shares \nthey are listed as a holding and so shares has been lent to other parties who would not be able to vote them. This \nonly becomes clear at the end of the process as there is little to no transparency on the lending of shares. \nDisclosure here could be quite helpful to the process on both sides.\n\n\n\nTransfers after the record date. Shares held as of the record date with subsequently transferred often either do not \nget voted or get voted improperly difficult -- given the difficulty of buying shares and transferring the vote. Similar \nmechanisms that permit the separation of the vote from underlying economics of the shares that's so-called empty \nvoting need to be regulated. In some cases, this has led to vast overvoting, but the fundamental concern is that \nwhen you separate a vote from the underlying economics it tends to favor short-term interest as opposed to those \nwho were focusing on long-term value.\n\nUniversal proxy card. As I previously testified in a prior SEC roundtable, universal proxy card does resolve some \nissues but raises concerns that could favor one party or the other in a proxy contest. I believe those concerns could \nbe addressed. In some circumstances, for example, the universal proxy card could allow shareholders to fully \nexercise their franchise that they cannot do by voting on a single card if they wish to split their vote.\n\nIf you want to split your vote and you can't go to the meeting, there is no mechanism today that allows you to do \nthat and that means many shares do not get voted in those circumstances. This is something that can be changed, \nbut I don't think private ordering will change it because we've had the ability of private order for a long time in one \nside or the other side or usually both are not willing to agree to some type of universal ballot.\n\nOur current system invites shareholders to vote multiple times as each side sends out numerous mailings and \nproxy cards. However, there's clearly confusion and maybe shareholders do not understand the last voting cards \nplants all earlier votes. This system that encourages people to vote early and often is bound to have problems.\n\nThe current system leads to significant cost for both sides. Procter & Gamble was most expensive proxy contest on \nrecord and has been reported that the ADP Pershing Square proxy contest cost over $26 million, $24 million of \nwhich was borne by ADP and ultimately the ADP shareholders. When every vote counts, each vote gets \nexpensive. A proxy voting system lacks transparency and is overly complicated. Through the use of technology, we \ncan create a system that provides for the appropriate amount of transparency while ensuring an accurate and timely \nresult.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to address the -- this important topic. I look forward to our discussion and answering \nany questions.\n\nSHEEHAN: Thank you. Brian -- yeah, Okay.\n\nCLAYTON: Anne -- Anne, if I can just jump again in real quickly. I have to go to another -- I -- I expect to come \nback, but I want to thank both of you for framing the issues. And I know the two of you have lived it ...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n... but it's clear there is room for improvement. And there's enough room for improvement where we should do \nsomething. Thank you.\n\nSHEEHAN: Thank you. Great. Speaking of the Procter & Gamble fight, so the next two will -- will -- they're \nexperienced in that. Anyway, Brian go ahead.\n\nSCHORR: Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Clayton, Commissioners, Investor Advisory Committee Chairman \nSheehan and the other Members of the IAC for providing me an opportunity to participate in today's discussion. \nTrian Fund Management is an investment management firm. We're founded in 2005. We manage capital for global \nbase of investors that includes institutional investors, individuals, public and private pension plans, and sovereign \nwealth funds.\n\nAs a highly engaged shareowner, Trian principals and partners have gained a total of 14 board seats at 12 different \nportfolio companies since we were founded in 2005. We have all engaged in three proxy contests in that period of \ntime -- H.J. Heinz in 2006, DuPont in 2015 and Procter & Gamble in 2017. I'd like to focus on these three proxy \ncontest and some of the lessons that we have learned from them.\n\n\n\nFirst, I would submit to you that shareholders ability to participate in director elections is fundamental to principles \nof shareholder democracy and the primary mechanism by which shareholders can hold corporate directors \naccountable. However, in a close proxy contest, the complexities of the current proxy voting infrastructure makes \nan accurate and verifiable voting tabulation extremely difficult. And keep in mind that an accurate voting tabulation \nis essential for all shareholder votes, including say-on-pay resolutions and Rule 14A-8 shareholder proposals.\n\nOur 2017 proxy contest with Procter & Gamble shined the spotlight on some of the specific issues and problems \nwith the current proxy voting system. At the outset, let me say that I'm very pleased that Debbie Majoras, Procter & \nGamble's Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary who's sitting next me today is joining me on today's panel \nso that she can share with you the issuer's perspective. Let me put some of it in perspective.\n\nIn the P&G proxy contest where approximately two million votes were cast, the final certified results showed a \nvoting margin of approximately one-quarter of one percent. As David just said, virtually, every vote cast have the \npotential to be the deciding vote.\n\nThis was likely the closest proxy contest to date. Both sides examined over 100,000 proxy cards during a two and a \nhalf week review period after the preliminary certified results came out would show that Trian's Nelson Peltz was \nahead by approximately 43,000 votes out of that, remember, $2 billion. Trian and P&G ultimately settled with Mr. \nPeltz joining the P&G board in early March of 2018.\n\nIn broad strokes, let me summarize some of the problems that we found from the simple to the very complex. Let \nme start with overvoting. Overvoting can happen, for example, when securities intermediaries, brokers, custodians \nwill hold the shares when the shares which they sometimes do for a fee. Only shares that are held on the record \ndate can be voted so that the shares that are loaned out cannot be voted.\n\nIf voting instructions are received for more shares than held on the record date and there's no cutback in the \nnumber of votes submitted, an overvote occurs. What we found was that certain overvoting by securities \nintermediaries was not reconciled by the inspector of election until after the announcement of a certified tabulation \nof vote by the independent inspector. So think about it. Certified vote was announced in preliminary basis, and yet \nfull reconciliation had not been done.\n\nSecond, let me talk about chain of custody. There's generally no way for beneficial owner to confirm that its shares \nwere actually voted. In addition, a break in the voting chain of authority between a voting intermediary like \nBroadridge, the custodian, and subcustodians and the company's registered list has the potential to result in shares \nnot being included in the tabulation. As a result, there's no consistent end-to-end voting confirmation. And let me \nshare with you two examples where break in the chain of custody resulted in shares not being counted.\n\nWe found one major financial institution, which learned that because of chain of custody issues the voting process \nthat had been using for nearly a decade to vote a portfolio of shares held in one account resulted in that portfolio of \nshares being excluded by the independent inspector from the tabulation of every contested proxy contest during \nthat tenure period. We found a situation where shares were voted by a small fund administrator were excluded \nbecause the name of the Broadridge client was changed following the transfer of the fund administration business \neven though the custodian remained unchanged and the ultimate beneficial owners had not been any -- had not \nmade any changes to how they held or voted the shares.\n\nAnd then there's just a simple issue of what happens when you vote a paper ballot. Think about the lack of a \npaperclip. One retail shareholder at the annual meeting tried to voting shares at the annual meeting by submitting a \nlegal proxy and a ballot. And those shares were not initially tabulated because the legal proxy and ballot was \nseparated from each other between the time of the annual meeting and the tabulation by the independent inspector. \nThat separation occurred for want of a paperclip. Ultimately, those shares were counted.\n\nAnother area of focus might be empty voting in the context of Employee Stock Ownership Plans. Should shares \nheld in a company ESOP for future participants and which are therefore unallocated to current participants, \nemployees and retirees be voted on a mirror percentage to match the shares that were allocated to and voted by \n\n\n\ncurrent plan participants who tend to vote for management, I would suggest to you that that does not produce a fair \nand equitable result.\n\nI would also point out that the universal proxy card might have some utility here. In corporate elections, as has been \nsaid before, shareholders can vote multiple times. In the P&G proxy contest, Trian and Procter & Gamble, they're \nmore than a dozen mailings between them. So shareholders had many, many proxy cards to choose from and \nmany, many opportunities to change the vote and submit later data proxy cards or even change the vote if they \nappeared in person at the annual meeting. This sometimes leads the questions of which card was the last voted \nproxy card since that is the card, which is ultimately counted.\n\nIn January 2017, Trian submitted transmitted a comment letter to the SEC in support of the SEC's universal proxy \ncard proposal. We believe that not only does the use of a universal proxy card support good corporate governance \nby providing all shareholders that vote by proxy whether you're a main street investor or institutional shareholder \nwith the same choices available to shareholders who attended annual meeting. But in addition, it could also play a \nrole in simplifying the proxy voting process and reducing tabulation issues by helping to eliminate the problem of \nidentifying the last voted proxy card and if invalid conflicting proxy cards that arise when a shareholder tries to mix \nand match nominees for competing slates.\n\nThe current proxy system is overly complicated making end-to-end voting confirmation to something that is not \nreadily available today. In addition, the current system makes it accurate, verifiable vote tabulation extremely \ndifficult in a close election. Furthermore the voting process seems more onerous and costly than necessary and \nshould be updated adequately and efficiently meet the needs of the shareholders and issuers. But regardless of the \nvoting margin, shareholder votes must be accurately tabulated to ensure the integrity of the shareholder voting \nprocess.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to share these thoughts. I look forward to the dialogue.\n\nSHEEHAN: Thank you, Brian.\n\nDebbie, welcome. Nice to have you here.\n\nMAJORAS: Oh, thank you so much to the Committee for asking me to participate, also to Chairman Clayton and \nthe ...\n\nSHEEHAN: Nice to have you here.\n\nMAJORAS: Well, thank you so much to the Committee for asking me to participate, also to Chairman Clayton and \nthe Commissioners and staff here at the SEC, and to my fellow participants for sharing their thoughts, including \nBrian Schorr.\n\nI think we all agree that for shareholders to effectively exercise their right to vote on certain corporate matters, we \nneed a process that ensures simplicity, transparency and accuracy and were here because most of us agree that \nwe're falling short. In most years and in most elections, when directors are elected with 90 plus percent of the vote, \nsystemic deficiencies don't necessarily surface, but in a close election the issues come into sharper focus and \nremind us that it's time to reevaluate, update and improve.\n\nIn its 180-year history, P&G, like most companies, have never faced a proxy contest until last summer. And \nsometimes it takes a unique or least unusual situation to highlight complexities and problems and here was our \nsituation. P&G has more than $2.5 billion outstanding shares, which are held by about three million shareholders. \nOf those, about 40 percent are retail shareholders, double the size of most companies.\n\nThis retail community includes employees and retirees who hold about 10 to 15 percent of our shares through stock \nplans and personal accounts. We also have a sizable number of international shareholders with about 14 percent of \nour shares being held by shareholders outside the U.S. It is also notable that about half of our three million \nshareholders hold less than 100 shares.\n\n\n\nOf course, the majority of our shares are still held by institutional investors and while we're concerned about those \nproxy voting issues, I thought today I would focus on the retail shareholder. Communication with shareholders is \nessential to their making informed choices and yet it's challenging. In a typical year, we mail fewer than 200,000 \nhard copies of our full proxy materials. For the rest we use either notice and access or electronic delivery. About \n800,000 of our shareholders receive their materials electronically.\n\nBut in a contested election, Broadridge does not permit either side to distribute materials electronically. So \nconsequently, whenever we wanted to communicate with this large shareholder base we had to mail them hard \ncopies even when they didn't want them.\n\nProxy materials mailed internationally could take weeks to arrive. I know David alluded to that, which means that \nthey may arrive after the meeting is over. So in a world where people's lives are literally run through their mobile \ndevices, companies really have to have a user-friendly electronic way to connect with shareholders and invite \nengagement, especially in a proxy contest.\n\nCommunication is hindered and has been mentioned because the SEC's ONO/NOBO will also prevent companies \nfrom having access to the names of our -- most of our investors. Shareholders on the OBO list hold more than 60 \npercent of P&G's outstanding shares and yet we have no way to communicate with them directly. The required \npaper mailings are filtered through their brokers with no real way for issuers to confirm whether those mailings were \nhandled properly. And while we very much support consumer privacy and it must be respected, we do think the \nstructure of those rules should also be reviewed.\n\nOf course, there is the fundamental challenge of engaging retail shareholders who may not understand the \nimportance of voting. With retail turnout typically around 25 percent, we should examine whether we can do more \nto convince them that their votes matter. The experts say that the way to increase retail turnout is to make multiple \ncontext, which Brian said during the proxy contest needs multiple paper mailings.\n\nIn that contest, many retail shareholders received over a dozen hardcopy packets of information collectively, but \nsome had multiple accounts, so then that was multiplied by the number of accounts. It did increase our -- our retail \nvote participation to 50 percent, but it also not surprisingly led to frustration and complaints. Many were confused, \nothers found it environmentally unfriendly, and many were just plain annoyed like why do I have all this paper. If \nthey want retail shareholders to vote, then we have to give them a convenient and user-friendly method by which to \ndo it.\n\nOnline voting works fairly well, but only if the shareholder has the control number to login. While control numbers \nare included in the mailing, shareholders often misplace or accidentally discard them and then replacing them is not \neasy. So for beneficial owners, Broadridge generates and keeps these numbers and is typically unwilling to -- to \nprovide the replacement control numbers by email or phone. Rather, the beneficial owner has to go back to the \nDTCC participant, which then contacts the voting intermediary, which then mails the number to the beneficial and \nanother hardcopy.\n\nRequiring a separate control number rather than perhaps utilizing an existing personal data is so cumbersome that \nwe know that many shareholders just simply give up. And for a shareholder outside the U.S. waiting for your control \nnumber, we had frequent -- we had frequent issues with that and some are just simply deprived of their voting \nrights because they never got it. Again, in an age when consumers are used to doing everything online from \nbanking to buying a car, we have to find an efficient yet secure way for shareholders to vote their shares.\n\nFor those who vote by proxy card, Brian and others mentioned there's just -- the card has multiple opportunities to \nbe disqualified, particularly when names or titles are slight or slightly mismatched, and we have lots of examples of \nthat for another time. For beneficial owners, it's even uncertain whether their votes will actually be executed \nbecause those votes have to be filtered, as you know, through brokers or other custodians and there's lots of room \nfor air there as well.\n\n\n\nOvervoting and undervoting are common. For example, a shareholder typically does not know, as -- as Brian said, if \na broker has loaned out their shares. And finally, for the shareholders' will to be executed, as we've all said here, \nand it seems so obvious we have to have an accurate vote count, yet voting inspectors are still relying on highly \nmanual processes especially when the vote is close. I'm sorry, precision is critical especially when the vote is \nclose, but the voting inspectors are still relying on very manual processes where they have to make a number of \nsubjective judgments. For example, figuring out which is the card that actually count and with tens of thousands of \ncards to be sorted and tabulated, there's just no question that there are going to be errors. We know from \nexperience, groups of ballots get rubberbanded together and they don't all get counted. Some ballots stuck together \nand they didn't -- they -- they didn't all get counted.\n\nAnd then finally, I would say early in this tabulation process, the inspector is required to issue a preliminary report, \nwhich is, by definition, preliminary so it's going to have errors. In a contest as close as ours, while we definitely \nbelieve that shareholders have the right to information, they ought to have accurate information. And when that -- \nthat number is what a -- a tabulation was put out there into the media, most shareholders did not understand that it \nwas a preliminary number, and it caused a lot of confusion. So I think that's something else to look at.\n\nSo, we do think at P&G it's time to consider proxy plumbing reform involved. We hope to not go through that \nexperience again. I will tell you that -- that we did and we are -- we are ready to help in any way we can. Thank you \nvery much.\n\nSHEEHAN: Thank you. Arthur?\n\nCROZIER: Thank you, Chairman Clayton, Commissioners, Chairman Sheehan and the other Members of the \nInvestment -- Investor Advisory Committee for the invitation to speak today. I am the Chairman of Innisfree M&A \nIncorporated, a proxy solicitation firm that specializes in proxy fights and other contentious solicitations. I've been \ninvolved in proxy solicitation since the mid-1980's and I have the scars to prove it.\n\nThere'll be a lot of discussion today regarding the use of technology to resolve serious -- very serious issues in the \nproxy voting process. Technology solutions, which do offer the potential for great improvement in the current proxy \nvoting process, however, are likely a long time incoming and will undoubtedly create other issues that will also \nhave to be resolved.\n\nI will confine my remarks today to three issues that could be addressed in a comparatively short period. One, \nincreasing voting participation by individual holders, reducing to a minimum the brakes in the custodial chain of \nvoting authority resulting in otherwise valid votes not being counted, and universal proxy cards.\n\nThe problem of voting by individual investors, while the percentage of individual holders as participants in the \nequity capital markets has declined precipitously over the last several decades, those holders can and should still \nplay an important role in the electoral process of publicly-traded companies. Many proxy contests, in particular, are \ndecided by extremely small margins, not just Procter & Gamble. Individual support can also be crucial for proposals \nthat require a supermajority vote or transactions that have a majority of the minority vote requirement.\n\nAccording to Broadridge and PwC, however, participation by individual holders declined in the second half of last \nyear to only 27 percent, down from 28 percent the prior year notwithstanding the recent efforts to use the Internet \nand email to make voting easier through changes such as notice and access and email delivery of proxy materials \nand voting instructions. In fact, our experience -- in our experience, those changes have actually resulted in lower \nparticipation by retail holders.\n\nThe problem is ultimately neither a technology problem nor a problem that can be resolved through technology \nalone. The problem is ultimately a behavioral one. Individual holders lead very busy lives and voting in corporate \nelections is not a major priority. In our experience, the best way to increase participation by individual holders is \nthrough regular contact during the solicitation period, by hardcopy mailings with proxy cards and by direct \nsolicitation through telephone calls in which our solicitors can take votes during the call. While such regular contact \n\n\n\ncan be seen as annoying by some holders, potentially confusion, it is, in fact, very effective and produces -- can \nincrease participation to 50 percent or even possibly more.\n\nAt this time, however, the only way for issuers to reach out directly to individual holders is if they are non-objecting \nbeneficial owners, so-called NOBOs, or as we usually describe them the people who forgot to check a box when \nthey opened up their brokerage account. In our experience, NOBOs usually constitute most 50 percent of the \nshares held by individual holders to the company. Modifying the current rules to facilitate more individuals becoming \nNOBOs could increase voter participation, establishing a process whereby companies could solicit proxy votes \ndirectly from individual holders rather than through broker intermediaries could also substantially increase \nparticipation. For example, a broker could give the issuer a written authorization or omnibus proxy authorizing their \nclients to vote directly with the issuer.\n\nThe other -- the second concern I'd like to talk about is reducing the brakes in the custodial chain of voting \nauthority, as Brian had just discussed. And that was a significant problem at Procter & Gamble as well as the other \nproxy fights. And it results in the invalidation of otherwise valid votes due to breaks in the custodial chain.\n\nThe determination of the person or entity entitled to vote shares is determined by state law. In order to vote, the \nholder must be on there issuers registered list or have written authority from a registered holder to vote in its stead. \nSince most shares are held in the Street in the names of custodians, almost all Street shares are held on the \nregistered list by a nominee, CD & Co., which in turn designates through an omnibus proxy the number of shares \nthat each custodian can vote.\n\nBut once CD & Co. issues the omnibus proxy, its responsibilities and actions with respect to voting at the meeting \ncome to an end. The custodians must then transmit to Broadridge and the other voting intermediaries the relevant \ninformation for their clients holding shares on the record date in order for the intermediaries to distribute proxy \nmaterials to those holders, receive voting instructions from those holders and then vote in accordance with those \ninstructions in the names of the custodians.\n\nThat all sounds straightforward, sort of. The problem is that the information supplied by the custodians and the \ninformation maintained by the voting intermediaries often do not match the information on CD's omnibus proxy, \nwhich is the final word on entitlement to vote. A custodian may report to the intermediary that shares are held in the \nname of an affiliate, but that affiliate's name is not on CD's omnibus proxy or the custodian may be clearing for a \nvariety of smaller regional sub-custodians, which vote on behalf of their customers, but the necessary paperwork, \nso-called respondent proxies authorizing the sub-custodians to vote have not been issued.\n\nIn those cases, again votes that have been cast by shareholders fully entitled to vote may not be counted and \nthose shareholders are disenfranchised. It is important that the custodians and voting intermediaries regularly \nreview their processes and records to ensure that the information used to disseminate proxy materials and to \nprocess voting instructions conforms the information that custodians apply to DTCC for purposes of the omnibus \nproxy. It is particularly important that where subcustodians have the authority to vote that respondent proxies are \nissued reflecting that authority.\n\nThese breaks in custodial chain are usually not one-offs but are our recurring problems as I think Brian mentioned \nin the one case in the Procter & Gamble fight. You know, clear out the records, make sure it conforms into it on a \nregular basis. It shouldn't be hard.\n\nThe third topic is universal proxy cards, and I know I am not exactly a voice crying in the wilderness on this. We \nbelieves that universal proxy cards are appropriate. Under the current system, you can have distorted voting \nresults that do not reflect the true desires of the shareholders in terms of composition and shareholder base since \nshareholders are prevented from voting for all seats up for election.\n\nAnd by voting on only one card and possibly withholding on a certain number of directors, if someone wants to only \nelect two dissident nominees, their only choice is to vote for those two dissident nominees on the dissident court \nand withhold on the other nominees, thereby not testing any votes for the other open seats, which results in the \n\n\n\ndistortion of what the shareholders want to the extent that there are other shareholders who were bullet voting. \nEven though they don't represent a majority of the shares voted, they're bullet voting for additional candidates on \nthe dissident court. For example, it can also work the other way for the management court. As everybody has \nmentioned, the only way for -- to vote for candidates on both slates is to go to the expense and inconvenience of \nattending a meeting and voting in person or authorizing the other person to do so.\n\nThere has long been a concern that universal proxies would favor the dissident and that was a reason for not doing \nit. Our experience, however, which has been borne out by a few academic papers is that a universal proxy card \nwould generally favor management, if only because the likelihood that the proxy advisory firms would support some \nof the dissidents' nominees and under the current rules, none of the management's nominees, thereby resulting in \nan artificial vote for a limited number of directors and not for a full slate.\n\nWe use the universal proxy card and the proxy contest to Transocean several years ago. Transocean is listed on \nthe New York Stock Exchange, but it's incorporated in Switzerland, which requires that all nominees must appear \non the company's card.\n\nWe, in the dissident, use identical proxy cards that included both slates and experienced few difficulties in voting. \nBut there is one issue I think, in particular, that we -- that needs to be addressed from universal proxy card in -- in \nour view and our experience, and it comes back again to voting by retail holders.\n\nBy permitting a holder to pick nominees from both sides, there is a possibility that he or she will vote for more \nnominees than the number of open seats. In that case, the shareholders vote must be excluded, disenfranchising \nthe shareholder since there is no way to determine the voter's intent with respect to the seats that are actually \nopen.\n\nThis is not a problem for institutions or individual holders that vote on an electronic platform since safeguards \nagainst the drove overvoting can easily be programmed. The real concern are individual holders voting on print -- \npaper proxy card. Card design to minimize over votes is essential, particularly for voting intermediaries, which are \nfairly inflexible voting instruction forms. And because the penalty for inadvertently overvoting is so severe \ndisenfranchisement, there should be also in place a process whereby the voting intermediaries must inform any \nholders that have overvoted and give them an opportunity to correct their votes.\n\nAgain, while we believe the technology can help solve many of the current proxy voting issues and that the \nCommission should stay focused on facilitating those solutions, they are unlikely to be in place soon. And so it is \nimportant to focus on less complex, faster to implement solutions. There are many other issues such as voting \nissues caused by share lending that can also be addressed in the same way, but time does not permit a full \ndiscussion at this one.\n\nThank you again for the opportunity to -- to participate in this important process, and I look forward to today's \ndiscussion.\n\nSHEEHAN: Thank you all. So questions from the Committee members, first I'm going to call on the Committee \nmembers who are here in the room. And then for the folks on the phone, if you have an interest in asking a \nquestion, I'll -- we'll -- I'll go to the phone members after we conclude the questions from the folks present.\n\nSo, I think J.W., and then Heidi, and then Damon, and then Lisa.\n\nVERRET: Yeah. First, to just a point of background and then a question about three ideas that we haven't heard \nabout yet. So, first, you know, a reminder of the lesson of history that the last time the SEC engaged in a mutual \nrulemaking on proxy issues it was struck down by the D.C. circuit and business roundtable versus SEC. And part of \nthe reasoning in thre referenced state law and -- and preemption of state law.\n\nA lot of the arguments about issues in -- in this space involve an analogy to democracy -- to social democracy. And \nI would offer that that analogy is incredibly strained and that suggested benefits of proxy reform that would bring us \n\n\n\ncloser to an idealized social democracy in which votes are perfect and more clean and such or somewhat \nirrelevant for the purposes of the economic analysis mandate put onto the Commission. In fact, I think that -- that \ncorporate voting under a contractual relationship has about as much to do with social democracy as it has to do \nwith tennis or fishing, which is to say not very much at all. And I think that business roundtable vs. SEC in a number \nof other cases suggests that the internal affairs doctrine should be read in conjunction with the economic analysis \nmandate that is placed on the SEC.\n\nThree ideas, I'm interested in your pushback or thoughts on that. And also just three ideas I'll throw out really \nquickly that the SEC should consider that I think would put an approach to proxy -- proxy reform more in line with \nwhat I just suggested. First, the SEC has the power to certify questions of state law to the state Supreme Court of \nDelaware. That's not true with all states, but I think more states would do it, would -- would permit it if the SEC use \nthat certification mechanism more frequently. It hasn't done so since AFSCME versus CA, but I think certification of \nstate law questions that arise in, for example, the no-action process for shareholder proposals would be more \nhelpful. And I think a process to affirmatively require it is something the SEC could consider now.\n\nSecondly, during proxy, reform in -- in -- in 2010, 2011, I know Professor Coates and I debated the opt-in versus \nopt-out. I think we haven't heard about opt-in yet rather than mandatory systems, but I think opt-in should be a part \nof the discussion.\n\nAnd then thirdly, I talked to a lot of investment advisors and I asked them, do you have -- do you feel that you could \nadopt a -- a voting system in which you defer to management in the absence of red flags? And they say, no, we \ndon't feel like we could. And I talked to SEC folks who say that's not prohibited. There's a disconnect there and I \nthink guidance would be helpful. So those are three ideas I'd offer for your consideration coming.\n\nSHEEHAN: So, panelists, who would like to address any of the questions that -- David?\n\nKATZ: Thank you, Professor. I -- there -- there are good points and obviously business roundtable versus SEC has \nto be taken into account any of this. And I -- I do think that there is a distinction between the mechanisms that need \nto be used and the state law considerations. There will be times where the SEC may need to certify an issue. I think \nthe Delaware process works well when it's been used, and there would be no reason not to use it in appropriate \nsituations.\n\nI think most of the proxy situations though don't entail now. On shareholder proposals, that could be an area where \nthe staff obviously gets competing legal opinions. That may be an area where they would want somebody to weigh \nin.\n\nAs far as the -- the -- the opt-in, opt-out, you know, it's certainly something that can be considered. I -- you know, I \nthink you could debate both sides of that issue as you -- you two have in the past, but the -- the -- the third one on -\n- on -- you know, providing guidance generally, you know, I -- I think -- I think that there is a -- there -- there are \nways to fashion something that works here.\n\nMy big concern though is that, you know, the system is so broken that it's not a question of trying to have an \nidealized social democracy intake, it's trying to get an accurate vote without giving one side or the other a -- a real \nadvantage. And the mechanisms that deny certain groups of shareholders, like retail shareholders and others, the \nability to really have a role at the table, I think, that's -- that's problematic.\n\nSHEEHAN: Any of the other panelists want to address any of the issues that you had?\n\nBERTSCH: Yeah, maybe I'll just second ...\n\nSHEEHAN: Okay.\n\nBERTSCH: ... David's comments. I -- I think for our members it's really -- on this issue it's not trying to analogize to \nsocial democracy, it's just there is this process and they -- they perceive that s broken sometimes and they're not \nconfident that their votes are cast the way that they intended or the number of shares are cast. And so when you \n\n\n\nhave overvoting because somebody else was lending shares, but it's your broker and you are arbitrarily cut in your \nvoting power with having nothing to do with you, that's just a -- that's a process issue and -- and I -- I don't think it \nis over -- overdoing the democracy element to say that that disrupts the process. We do look to corporate elections \njust to answer some of these things.\n\nSHEEHAN: Heidi?\n\nSTAM: Yes. Thank you, thank you for your very informative presentation. I appreciate it. I feel a lot of consensus \namong all of you about the need for improvement in this area, but it's a big systemic lead. And so my question, I \nthink, investors depend on progress in this area, it's vitally important. Are there things that the Commission can \nthink about doing which would not require the time and energy of a huge systemic overhaul, which I think we \nshould work towards but we need to acknowledge it's going to take a long time? Is -- are there things that can be \ndone relatively quickly that would make the process better for investors and -- and also better for issuers?\n\nAnd if there's -- I heard about the universal proxy and obviously, that's been a very important step forward. I hear a \nlot of support for that with minor tweaks. Anything in addition to that that anybody would suggest that the \nCommission could focus on?\n\nSHEEHAN: David?\n\nKATZ: I mean, I -- I think promoting -- promoting the use of technology you have some private ordering that's going \non now where you have some competing systems that are coming out. I think that the SEC has to decide right now \nit's -- it's a virtual monopoly that -- that's in the -- in the middle there and, you know, whether competition would be \nhelpful or whether the -- you know, you could have different providers providing the same service, but using \ndifferent types of technology that -- that companies and issuers and -- could -- could use and can work together. \nThere should be a common solution with that.\n\nI think the difficulty has been that the SEC has tried to step back because it's been very concerned about interfering \nhere. And the problem is the technology is just overtaken where we are. And I think, you know, from discussions \nwith -- with Chairman Clayton and -- and others at the Commission, it seems that, you know, there's a recognition \nthat we can't continue to -- you know, if there's technological solutions here, we have to try to embrace them as \nopposed to push them off.\n\nSHEEHAN: Deborah?\n\nMAJORAS: One -- one of the things I would say about the -- the technology piece Heidi and -- I always get a little \nbit nervous when I start down an avenue like this where lots of people, including some sitting behind me know a lot \nmore about this than I do. But when we talk about technological solutions here, it can sound like what you said \nbefore, which is there's got to be, you know, really this very large multiyear effort. And some of that may be true, \nand so we got to get started on it, but you're asking for some of the more low hanging fruit.\n\nAnd I -- and I would say, you know, I'm very interested in some of these blockchain proposals and others don't how \nquickly that could all be implemented. But we do have what will spice up be considered low-level technology today, \nright? Things like -- things like email notifications and -- and online ways of communicating, which again that's how \neveryone communicates in the world. And so while there are security issues, it's hard to imagine that those are \nworse than the security issues in -- you know, when you're communicating with your bank or your doctor. That \nseems to me that trying to look for some of those solutions even, as we said communicating with retail \nshareholders, the Commission has said through Chairman Clayton -- Chairman Sheehan has said we really have to \nthink about the retail shareholder and how we engage them further.\n\nAnd so one of the things that we saw is that retail shareholders are screaming, \"I don't want to communicate with \nyou. This way, I can tell you that. And so if we know that they'd like to communicate with us to the extent they want \nto communicate with us at all in ways that they're used to in their daily lives, can we explore some of that and try to \n\n\n\nmake that a little bit easier? It just seems to me that -- that that's at least a -- a short-term, if not intermediate step \nthat -- that we ought to explore.\n\nSTAM: Yeah, that -- that sounds, you know, very appropriate. And if there's anything that the Commission can do to \nhelp facilitate that, I think, you know, it would be an investor's best interest to support. Thank you.\n\nSHEEHAN: Any -- would you -- I know Ken wants to address this.\n\n(UNKNOWN): That's right.\n\nSCHORR: Anne, I ...\n\nSHEEHAN: So Brian and Ken want to address this, Okay.\n\nSCHORR: ... I would just echo one point that -- that remain and then that one other one of that is I -- I do agree that \nthere needs to be a focus on -- on the retail. You know, there was some allusion to the fact that in a contested \nproxy contest you have to send out the hard copy proxy statements. And -- you know, and as was said, I mean, it's \n-- it's a real problem that that, in this day and age, is the only way you can communicate, right, whether it's sending \nsix copies or 12 copies of proxy statements. And if you have multiple accounts, if you have an account in your son's \nname and your daughter's name, and you have one in -- an IRA and another one in 401(k), all of a sudden instead \nof getting six, you get 24 copies of the materials. I mean, it's -- it's just -- you know, when you -- when you get home \neach day and you see it on your doorstep, it's -- it's not something you look forward to do. That's number one.\n\nNumber two, you know, one of the issues that we touched upon was the whole question of reconciliation overvoting, \nundervoting. David mentioned transparency. I mentioned the fact that there was no reconciliation done before there \nwas a -- you know, the -- the preliminary certified results, there's no requirement for that reconciliation to be done. \nSo, there's -- there must be some way that, you know, before results -- before certified results, whether they be \npreliminary or final, you know, are -- are put out that the overvoting/undervoting voting reconciliation is completed. I \nmean, it -- it's just -- it makes no sense to have a called certified result come out.\n\nAnd putting aside the -- any review, any challenges, any mistakes that are found, but the fact that the part of the \nprocess doesn't include the -- the reconciliation that you know has to take place. So I -- I think that's -- that's a very \nsimple thing that can be taken care of.\n\nSHEEHAN: Okay. Ken?\n\nBERTSCH: Yeah, I would just comment. I appreciate your comments and Art Crozier similarly suggested and as did \nBrian, just now there are some steps. But I do think we should spend some time thinking about what the bigger \nlong-term solution to this may be that the whole system is so archaic.\n\nAnd I think we do now see the outlines of vastly different technological solutions that could be much better. So I -- I \n-- I think it's -- and I know this issue is never the most important issue, but it's -- there's always something else \nthat's more important.\n\nSTAM: No, we'll never catch up if we don't start working on it now.\n\nBERTSCH: Right, exactly. So I think we should think about the big solutions.\n\nSTAM: Absolutely. Thank you.\n\nSHEEHAN: So, Damon, before I recognize you, I know Commissioner Stein had a question.\n\nAnd then, Commissioner Roisman, I'll see if you have any questions at this point.\n\nSTEIN: Well, I actually -- I have two comments. One is Chairman Clayton asked me before he left if someone on \nthe panel could define naked voting so people could understand what that was. And then on my own part, I \n\n\n\nthought it'll be great to go through the panel and say what's the low hanging fruit that you think the Commission \nshould focus on in the next six months, right? The next year, what would you recommend?\n\nSHEEHAN: So, why don't we just go right down the -- the panel. So, Arthur, we'll start with you if -- well, do -- who \nwants to address the naked voting issue?\n\nCROZIER: I mean, I'll ...\n\nSHEEHAN: Arthur?\n\nCROZIER: ... I'll start. You know, naked voting is essentially a process whereby someone holds shares on the \nrecord data and is entitled to vote at the meeting. But whether it's through some sort of derivative positions or \notherwise, they actually have no economic interest in the company. And so they are casting a vote without having \nthe underlying economic interest because perhaps their -- if, you know, there are holders on another side or \nwhatever that they are trying to manipulate a vote on that side to benefit another position that they hold.\n\nI think in terms of the things to be done quickly or perhaps not so quickly, again as I mentioned in my remarks, \nlooking into NOBO situation to -- to -- to -- to rethink that process to encourage more people to become NOBOs and \n-- and also see if there's ways as we suggested to permit issuers to contact those NOBOs directly and take their \nvotes directly.\n\nOne of the other issues that people have commented on a couple of different times is the problem of \novervoting/undervoting, a lot of which is attributable to share lending, which is never going to go away. But \nunderstand that the problem of share -- that the voting problems caused by lending shares is largely in the hands \nof the institutional investors themselves, the folks who are were lending out their shares.\n\nAnd a lot of times, I think, their concern is they don't -- they need to do it for economic purposes and while they \nwould like to be able to call back the shares into their account on the record date in order to be able to vote them \nbecause if they're not actually in their account in a long position on the record date, they can't vote. They don't \nknow when the record date is. And if there was a process that companies needed to push out the record date in a \nmore public way, insufficient time for investors to make the choice whether they want to pull back the shares, call \nback the shares to be able to vote them or leave them out on one.\n\nMAJORAS: Thank you. I won't repeat anything that's been said here. Either one of mine was this issue around \nbeing able to use electronic delivery email systems and so forth, which I think is one.\n\nTwo, I think if the Commission could look at the rule that requires a preliminary vote to be certified in -- in an 8-K to \nbe filed because again that -- maybe it wouldn't always be the case, but just fomented more drama and -- and \nconfusion, I think, among shareholders than was needed and -- and certainly wasn't very helpful. So that would be -\n- that would be number two.\n\nAnd then three, this is a -- this is a little bit more process for how we get there, but I really do think getting all of the \nrepresentatives in one room so that people can see all of the intermediaries that things go through and -- and what \nrules each of them have created, some of which are required by state law or SEC rules, some of which, you know, \nthey have required because of their experience which is -- which is very valid. But on the other hand, all this stuff \nstacks up to the point where I remember one point during the proxy contest saying, can I put on here so that the \nvoter will understand? Can I put these words just -- you know, and the answer is no. You're not allowed to do that. \nYou can't put anything there to -- you know.\n\nAnd so -- so I think -- I think there are smaller things that we can look at. And -- but I think it requires really truly \nlooking at this from an end-to-end perspective and reminding ourselves what's really required under the law, which \none of the things the professor mentioned and -- and what -- what are we just doing out of practice or habit that we \nreally could change. So that's more process than an individual thing but ...\n\n\n\nSCHORR: As I mentioned before I think again transparency and -- and dealing with the overvoting/undervoting \nreconciliation and -- and being able to reach out to retail shareholders in a way other than just sending the paper -- \npaper proxies.\n\nKATZ: I don't think there's a need to echo a lot of comments they have made, but I think that by exploring the \nblockchain technology used not just here but I think there are other opportunities that the staff is already looking at \nin trading and -- and other enforcement mechanisms and other things, I think that the same technology can easily \nbe transported into this area, and it's not -- would not be reinventing the wheel.\n\nI think the biggest issue is going to be are we going to, you know, have a single provider, are we going to allow \nmultiple providers and what's the benefit and detriment of doing that.\n\nBERTSCH: And obviously I mentioned universal proxy already. I do like Art's idea, which I haven't really heard \nbefore of much better earlier notification of record dates at one of the asset managers I worked for. This was a -- a \nvery difficult issue to wrestle with. When did we want to recall ...\n\n(UNKNOWN): Yeah.\n\nBERTSCH: ... shares with -- with the early record date system prevalent in the U.S.? It's -- it's just -- it's very hard \nto know. But we did not know we had companies that are portfolio management team or teams had very serious \nconcerns about. And so just an early record date system so we could know much more clearly what we had to do \nby one would be helpful.\n\nCROZIER: I would just comment -- I would just comment that the Commission's rules right now and particularly for \nan annual meeting require the issuer to publicly note as a record date 20 business days in advance of the meeting \ndate -- a month for all intents and purposes. But that notice goes only to the voting intermediaries, Broadridge and \nthe others, and it's not really a matter of public dissemination.\n\nSHEEHAN: Yeah. And the -- the issue of calling back shares, I personally went through that at CalSTRS because \nwe did lend our shares, and we wouldn't -- you would want to call them back to vote them. But because of the \nrecord date, during the BofA-Merrill Lynch thing you missed it. And, you know, there were huge consequences on -- \nyou know, have -- 10 years ago for those of us who remember that, and it was really problematic in terms of that. \nSo we actually became overly conservative in pulling things back looking at last year's and just kind of making a \nguess, but it made it very difficult because it -- it was foregone revenue in terms of that.\n\nSo, anything -- all right, Damon?\n\nSILVERS: All right. Well, like, I think, everyone else, I -- I found this very helpful and I appreciate everyone -- \neveryone coming. There is, I think, shall we say that some of these conversations have been going on a long time. \nAnd I just want to make sure that sort of -- I think maybe in the spirit of our -- of the -- Chairman Clayton's question \nabout -- about naked voting that we just get a few things on the table, make sure everybody agrees that these \nthings are so.\n\nSeveral people talked -- several of you talked about the problem of getting individual investors to a vote. And I think \nthere's a lot of confusion about who -- about how individual investors sort of interface with the proxy voting system. \nObviously, it's people who are actually on the share register, often employees are on the share and retirees are on \nthe share register, you had -- and then you have individuals who invest through brokerage accounts who turn up in \nthe -- in the -- the beneficial owner -- the various beneficial owner list.\n\nAnd then you have people who are investing actually through large institutions, sometimes referred to as individual \ninvestors. But if -- the way I individually invest is -- is through a Vanguard or a Fidelity Mutual Fund, I don't have any \nvoting rights, right? And actually Fidelity or Vanguard is voting.\n\n\n\nWith all that in mind, everybody agrees, right, that -- that -- that there was a collapse in -- in the participation of \nindividual investors who had individual voting rights following the decision to allow companies to communicate with \nthem exclusively by web, by the Internet, right? That as a factual matter, nobody disagrees with that, right?\n\nOkay. Because it seems to me, A, that which -- what this panel has been talking about if we want to get individual \ninvestors to participate we got to -- we've got to reckon with that fact. And that -- that if you're -- if you're concerned \nabout that, perhaps that decision was a mistake. So nobody disagrees with that.\n\nSecondly, I think it's already been established that there's kind of a consensus that there's some way to do \nuniversal proxy that -- that maybe everybody could live with. I -- I think we kind of -- I think we kind of get that on the \ntable. Is that right? Well, sort of. There was some way, right? I don't want to get into all the details of each person's \nparticular views, but there is some way to do that because I think if we've established that then to Heidi's point, \nwe've established some path of -- of -- of improvement. I don't know. Maybe -- maybe some of us wouldn't agree, \nbut -- based on JW's comments, but at least the panel agrees.\n\nAnd -- and I want to establish a third thing that everybody agrees on or it's going to come up later today, but I think \nit's critical in terms of this panel, which is there have been several panelists talking about the need to try to orient \nthe system toward long-term investors. And I just want to make sure people agree that, in fact, the long -- where \nthe big money is in long-term investors is in index mutual funds and -- and indexed -- large indexed DB plans like \nCalSTRS and CalPERS and so forth. When you're talking about long-term investors, that's who you're talking about \nas a -- as a -- just as a factual matter.\n\nNow, what I'm really concerned about and I want to -- and I have a specific question to David about this because, \nDavid, I know you and your colleagues at Wachtell and the person whom your -- and the person whom your Chair is \nnamed after, my friend Marty Lipton, have thought about this a lot, which is this, this conversation has presumed \nthat the problem that the -- that the fundamental tension in our corporate governance system is the tension \nbetween investors and managers. And I know that that's how people often experience it, the good people in the \nbusiness of proxy solicitations.\n\nMy concern is that, in fact, what I'm worried about is the collusion between investors and managers, meaning that \nwe have a ton of evidence that our corporate governance system, our capital market system is encouraging short-\ntermism. The most dramatic piece of evidence we have is the fact that an enormous amount of money was just \nhanded over to our public companies from the public fisc in the Republican tax bill, $1 trillion of which -- with the \nexplicit purpose, as President Trump said, have encouraging investment, and $1 trillion of it was handed out in -- in \ndividends and in stock buybacks.\n\nAnd that involved the -- in -- in my view, cooperation between short-term interests in the capital markets and \nmanagement. And so with that in mind -- and, David, what in your view would transfer -- is what steps, in your \nview, in the proxy system -- and I want to confine myself to proxy process -- to the -- to the proxy -- proxy process, \nthe -- the infrastructure we were talking about just now. But what steps, in your view, would most effectively actually \nempower long-term investors and get them to behave like long-term investors?\n\nKATZ: I think it would require significant change in the system, but I think that there are abilities to change. I mean, \none of the things obviously is the whole focus on short-term reporting, quarterly reporting. Now, you know, quarterly \nreporting, many investors will say increases accountability, but by the same token, if you are reporting quarterly \nresults you tend to be focused on those and be making decisions that impact those directly.\n\nI think if you're looking at the proxy process specifically, you know, while it would not be a universally held view by \nany stretch of the imagination, I think that you would find that companies that have staggered the words even \nthough they have gone out of -- out of vote so to speak, you know, are more focused on the long-term because \nthey don't have the same short-term pressures than an activist can necessarily bring in those types of stipulations.\n\nBeyond that, I -- I don't think that there is collusion. I think that there is enormous pressure that shareholders can \nbring to bear, especially activist shareholders but other shoulders as well. I think that there are oftentimes where \n\n\n\ncompanies are caught in between making investment decisions or dividend or doing stock buybacks. Part of that is, \nin fact, because of the benefits to individuals when they -- when they can cash out in that manner. Part of it is that \ntax laws, as they exist, don't necessarily promote that investment the way they did 20 years ago.\n\nAnd I think that when you have shareholders who are pushing for something more immediate, especially when they \nthink that they can invest those funds themselves for a better return than letting a company make that investment \ndecision as long as that's driving a lot of these decisions, it's -- can be very, very problematic. And you're seeing \nthat in a lot of situations where people say you short play companies instead of conglomerates or, you know, we \nhave seen arguments being made in the E&P industry that company should be focused on single basins and \ncompanies are focused on multiple basins are not going to be as efficient. And -- and therefore you should split \nthese companies up and do other things.\n\nI don't think that makes enormous sense, but part of it is -- it's a -- it's a much bigger issue. It's not a simple proxy \nfix.\n\nCROZIER: Can I just clarify one thing? I don't mean to imply by using the term collusion because, of course, it'll \nbecome very prevalent ...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n... in our political discourse. I don't mean to imply anything anybody doing anything improper. Cooperation would -- \nsubstitutes for that in my mind.\n\nSHEEHAN: Lisa? And then I have something.\n\nFAIRFAX: Thank you. Right? And thank you for all of your remarks. I actually was on the panel that focused on \nuniversal proxy. And my recollection of that conversation was that it was very different from the one that we are \nhaving here today, and that there were some significant pushback around whether or not it made sense to adopt a \nuniversal proxy card and around whether or not it made sense to engage in an effort at changing the proxy system \nwithout doing it wholesale like that we got -- I felt like there were a lot of questions about don't we have to do it all at \nonce.\n\nSo, I guess the first thing I would say is I'm heartened by the notion that it seems like we've come to a place, \nnumber one, where people feel like we need to start taking steps, that we need to start, you know, getting the low \nhanging fruit and -- and create, I think as Heidi suggest some short, medium and long-term strategies about how \nbest to -- so I guess a little bit of what I'm doing is what Damon was trying to do is to say so have we come to a \nplace of consensus around let's try to get some movement around changes to the proxy system and not kind of wait \nfor the wholesale solution.\n\nI guess, the second I would say on the universal proxy card piece because I -- I do think this is a very different \nconversation. I feel like both from industry side and from regulators side, and so now maybe it's just a level-setting \nexercise as Damon was trying to do. I guess, I felt like people listen to this conversation today. They will walk away \nwith the assumption that everyone was on board, right? This is not something, yes, there are doubles in the details, \nbut this is not something that's going to require some significant overcoming of obstacles in order to move forward.\n\nAnd I just want to make -- get your understanding of whether or not you think that is true, that is are we out of place \nwhere we really can move forward on this issue and focus on the details, right, 10, 20, 75 percent, or should we \nexpect that there will be some type of significant pushback and, you know, what would that look like. That's s my \nfirst question really.\n\nAnd then my second is on the OBO/NOBO. My -- my research suggest that most people don't understand this \ndistinction. Most people ride -- don't -- like the defaults don't appear to be working because most people are \ndefaulting into places. They do not understand they're defaulted into. And even the ones who have some \n\n\n\nunderstanding that they have defaulted into this don't fully appreciate what it will mean come proxy voting and \nproxy contest voting.\n\nAnd what I -- when -- so when you got started and we need to change the system, we need to get more, I'm \nwondering is that is true or is it case that we need to get to a place where we recognize that at some level maybe \nthat distinction is not useful in some circumstances. And that, you know, when it comes particularly to contested \nelections and the need to communicate with voters, that it's not about trying to encourage more NOBOs, but it's \nanother workaround. We need to figure out just how do we get to people regardless of their status.\n\nSHEEHAN: Deborah and then David?\n\nMAJORAS: Thank you, Lisa. To your first point, look, I can't pretend that I speak for all issuers. My only concern on \nuniversal proxy is -- is the devil really is in the details. In other words, it's not -- it's not just, oh, details, details. They \nreally do matter. And let me -- let me give you an example of it from -- from -- from my perspective.\n\nSo, in -- in the current proposed -- the 2016 proposal, which would require that dissident to only communicate with \n50 percent of the shareholders, in Procter & Gamble's case, that would mean that -- that a shareholder would only \nhave to communicate with 124 shareholders. Procter would communicate with three million. So, we're -- if we think \nabout -- and then -- and then if you would take -- you know, I was very interested in Ken's proposal, move it 75. \nThat does change it. And it -- it will look like a bigger number, but it's still only two percent of our shareholders.\n\nSo -- so the -- so my only point is let's not -- we also want to solve the problem of not disenfranchising our retail \nshareholders and so if what we're saying is I want to get elected, but you don't count enough for me to send \nsomething to, I mean, we just have to look at that. We have to look at of all I think together. And as David, I think, \npointed out earlier, if you look at the fairness, too, to the -- to the issuers in terms of -- of piggybacking on the \nexpense and -- and -- and so forth, so I just wanted to put that out there when I -- because I kind of whispered to \nDavid's point, well, sort of, and it wasn't fair of me to do that. So I wanted to say ways to that.\n\nSo just -- I do think that the details matter here and that we need to think of them. And then on -- what you said \nabout the OBO/NOBO, I like it because what I think -- partly what I heard you saying is let's understand what the \nfacts are and what's going on. And -- and there may be -- there may be easier fixes to that that really involve just \neducation, making sure -- because let's face it, we all have defaults opt-ins/opt-outs in our life today, and we just -- \nwe just breeze right through them, so it's probably a good idea to start there.\n\nSHEEHAN: Yeah.\n\nKATZ: And I was also on the roundtable with -- and I do think that there are still issues. I am heartened, you know, \nfrom the discussions that have happened in the last two years that there is more receptivity to the changes that, I \nthink, would -- would level the playing field. I still strongly believe that you need to reform the whole system \nbecause the universal proxy is going to be working within it, but are we better off by taking that step if you make the \nmodifications that you need to make.\n\nI think that we would have a better system. I have also seen two more years of, you know, bad outcomes on votes \nbecause a proxy advisory firm recommends, you know, one dissident out of four, but all four end up getting elected. \nAnd people say, \"Well, I didn't have a choice, I could only vote on that one card.\" And so by voting on that one \ncard it has a contrary result.\n\nAnd when -- you know, that can happen much more easily than people suspect, and it does happen -- I mean, I \nhave now seen it in -- in more than a dozen cases and different situations, and it's very hard to explain to the \nmanagement team. It's also very hard to explain to the management team, you know, how you're going to visit a \nlarge shareholder and you find out that they only -- you know, because they've lent out the shares, frankly, they \ndon't tell you but they are voting nowhere near what that ownership is -- is going to be. And that -- that can also \nimpact.\n\n\n\nOn the NOBO/OBO thing, to me -- to me, I don't think you're ever going to be have to really educate the -- the \nperson that you're most interested in educating the retail shareholder on this because, you know, when they sign \nup for whatever they're signing up or however they invest, it's not really well-explained. I do think that this is an area \nwhere, as part of an overhaul the rules, this is something that's really worth looking at whether in particular \nsituations it make sense or not. You also have to deal with privacy issues that exist.\n\nAnd I think a lot of people still make their distinctions about whether they want to be an OBO or not because they -- \nthey perceive it as a privacy issue and there are ways to deal with limiting what that information to use for and when \nthat information can be used. And I think it's a mistake to sort of say, \"Well, let's educate people on what the \nsystem is because I think even if you educate them, you know, much the same way as I have enormous promise \nthat only 25 percent of retail holders are voting, it's a big issue to me. That's why I think that, you know, both sides \nin order to use universal proxy they should have to go out to all shareholders. All shareholders should be given the \nsame amount of information.\n\nI don't think that is a big change to be honest with you. I -- I think it's more of a fairness issue. But, you know, to \nme, those are the types of details so that I think can -- can be done serially although you really do need to fix the \nsystem because if you just fix pieces of it, you're going to create different tactics and -- and proxy contest issues.\n\nSHEEHAN: Thanks. Okay. So we've got Allison -- oh, Arthur, go ahead.\n\nCROZIER: Just to follow up on something David said. I mean, I think on the NOBO/OBO, at least from our \nexperience, I mean, we have to recognize there are individual holders who do not care and they will not vote no \nmatter what you do or what process you set-up. I mean, that's just the reality. We can't get 100 percent \nparticipation.,\n\nSHEEHAN: Okay. So we've Allison, John Coates, Lydia, and then I'll see if folks on the phone. I know we -- we've \ngot a couple of more folks who are going to testify, and I'll have the -- you folks just stay at the table and bring up \nthe others, and then Ed Rock is coming in video -- video conference.\n\nSo, Allison, you are up next.\n\nBENNINGTON: Thank you, Anne. Really all I wanted to do was back up here for a second and underscore why this \nreally matters and why this is so important. We've been talking about a lot of detail here. I just want to sort of remind \neverybody the -- the basic corporate governance concept here that we're really talking about, you know, which is \naccountability. And it's accountability all the way up the chain in corporation employees being accountable to \nmanagement, manageable management being accountable to the board, and the board members being \naccountable to the shareholders. And how does that happen was the mechanism that -- that the relationship \nbetween the shareholders -- and we're talking about all the shareholders, whether we're talking about somebody \nthat holds one share, somebody that holds a million shares, and that's the ability to elect the directors of the \ncompany.\n\nSo -- and this is the mechanism that it gets done by. It is the proxy process. So I -- I just want to make sure that, \nyou know, in all the detail we don't lose the fact that this is a really, really important topic and to make sure that the \npeople who actually own the shares are the ones that are electing the directors and, therefore, that chain of \naccountability is intact.\n\nSo I only have one question that's really simple. And I want to ask Deborah and actually want to ask the same \nquestion of Matt, so -- yeah, you're on the hot seat ...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n... as representative issuers. What percentage of the -- of your corporate business communications do you think \noccurs -- and I will say your important business communication occurs through U.S. mail? I'm surprised you have to \nthink that much.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYeah.\n\nMAJORAS: The reason I'm thinking that much is because I'm trying to think of any.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n(UNKNOWN): I was going to ask there still is the U.S. mail. I didn't realize that.\n\nMAJORAS: You know, I am very, very little ...\n\nBENNINGTON: Yeah.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Yeah.\n\nMAJORAS: ... very little.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Same, same.\n\nBENNINGTON: So that's -- that -- that's obviously the second point I wanted to undersscore. Thank you.\n\nSHEEHAN: Great. John Coates, did you -- Okay.\n\nCOATES: Yeah, real quick. So first business roundtable was wrong than it was decided and it's even more wrong \ntoday, so nobody should pay any attention to it. Honestly, I really do think the current D.C. Circuit wouldn't even \ngiven it a serious view as precedent and create legal advice.\n\nE-communication, if permitted, and we heard about the fact that I guess, Broadridge bans it. How do they do that? \nWhy don't the issuers all band together and tell Broadridge they can't do that. In any event, I don't think it's an SEC \nrule unless I'm missing something. If you have that capacity, that would reduce the asymmetry that David and \nDeborah were flagging from universal proxy, right? So the need to reach all shareholders becomes much less \nasymmetric if you can use electronics to do so. So there's a linkage between those two things, aybe universal proxy \ncoupled with the change, and that would be much more.\n\nAnd then, I guess, just -- you know, more broadly given that Broadridge is a monopoly as we heard, do we like \nmonopolies? Does anybody like a monopoly? Would there be appetite for there being, too?\n\n(UNKNOWN): Yes.\n\nCOATES: Would there be a role -- I realize the SEC is not an anti-trust regulator, but the rules that structure this set \nof interactions do create barriers to entry and, therefore, perhaps entrench monopolist. And I guess therefore \nshould the SEC, as part of this, be thinking hard about ways in which its rules make it hard for someone to compete \nwith Broadridge. Anybody want to take that one?\n\nBERTSCH: Right. I think we should be very clear on what part of the utility function may be a natural monopoly. \nAnd I -- and, you know, David suggested more -- there maybe opportunities for more competition. I suspect there's \nmaybe a core function that is very utility-like and probably should be regulated like a monopoly. So at least we can \nbe clear on what -- what that is. I don't know if that helps.\n\nSHEEHAN: Well -- and, Lyell, I know you'll have the opportunity when you come up to address the issue ...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n... so I think you've got your questions ready. So, we will call on you because I -- you know, you are going to get the \nquestion on the mailing just we can recognize that.\n\n\n\nLydia, you've got a question.\n\nMASHBURN: Thank you, Anne. My question follows a little bit on what John Coates was just discussing, but to \nwhat extent could we -- this is a very complex problem, complex system we're talking about very specific details \nthat are causing challenges with the way the whole proxy system is working. To what extent could we move to a \nmore principles-based approach in the rules and regulations governing the system such that whether it's the SEC \nor other involved regulators could say, \"Here are the goals of the system and then allow the marketplace to figure \nout multiple solutions.\" Usually the best way to find the best solutions is to put multiple ones out there, and let there \nbe a competition of types of solutions to the proxy process.\n\nAnd there could be multiple technologies, different technologies, David, you were mentioning. What are the things \nwe can do to help us move in a direction where we could actually try to solve this problem creatively and bring in \nthe right players who are incentivized to solve this problem? Because I do think it's hard for a group of us in -- in a \nroom here to say, \"Oh, we're going to fix it this way.\"\n\nThere are lots of solutions to this problem. It's not just about disclosures, how to change the way in which we \ncommunicate with investors, et cetera. There could be tons of things we could do differently. So how do we make \nthat? How do we open up that process?\n\nKATZ: I think -- and -- and responding somewhat to John's question as well, I think there is a way to open up the \nprocess. The -- the key though is if, for example, the SEC mandated some type of blockchain technology tracking \nand et cetera so that you could actually confirm the vote and -- and -- and follow it, I think you could allow \ncompetition to see which system work best.\n\nMy concern though is you have to be very careful that, you know, if -- you know, issuers may move towards one \nsystem and activists may move towards another, if you're going to have competing market models of how it would \nwork in practice and the cost frankly will be borne, at the end of the day, by shareholders, not necessarily \nmonetarily, but you're going to have some outcomes that are sub-optimal. And I'm just not sure that it's worth that. I \ndo think we are in a sub-optimal area right now and there are some fixes that we make, but I think that there are -- \nby mandating some technologies and letting the best technology prevail and -- and things like that, I think that you \ncan go a long way.\n\nAs far as, you know, dealing with monopoly, et cetera, and dealing with the communications, you know, if it's part of \na brokerage account and -- and systems like that you could be mandated to give an email address or something \nlike that or we could come up with a better system, you know, that -- and people would have to re-up annually or \nsomething like that to make sure that they were getting the materials, you know, maybe something like that can \nthen allow there to be a competitive situation. But I think you be very careful because there's a -- you know, at the \nend of the day, the SEC is going to step back and it's going to be a state law issue where it's (inaudible) are fighting \nthat whether it was a good vote or a bad vote, and -- and how -- and you just have to have the right steps taken to \ndo that.\n\nNow, Art, I don't know from your perspective whether that's complicate matters so much that you think the system \nbreaks down or you think that, in fact, you know, will maybe a little bit of competition will help raise the bar.\n\nCROZIER: No, I -- I do think a little bit of competition would help raise the bar. I mean -- but, you know, the problem \nI think is -- as somebody alluded to earlier, there are so many different participants in the process that I think you \nreally need some kind of central regulatory system to get all of those participants in the process onboard and \nmoving in the same direction. And state law is going to complicate things.\n\nMost -- most companies are -- most publicly-traded companies are headquartered in -- in Delaware. There are \nalways still going to be issues about validity, but you also have a number of companies who are incorporated in \nother states that have laws that are different from Delaware and will have to be applied separately.\n\n\n\nMAJORAS: I think I just want to clarify that my question is more about could we move to a regulatory framework \nthat is more principles-based instead of mandating a technology because I think evidence has shown that when we \npick one technology, technology changes and it's outdated. Snail mail used to be efficient.\n\nKATZ: Look, I would love to say that you could -- that a principles-based system could work here. I just think that a \nprinciples-based system without the specificity and the rules that would -- you know, isn't going to work at the end of \nthe day. And if we're going to -- the difficulty is if you really want to have a level playing field for both, you know, that \ntreats issuers and shareholders and different types of shareholders the same, unfortunately, you're going to have to \nget beyond the principles.\n\nMAJORAS: Okay. And I -- I agree with David to some degree that -- that some rules may be necessary beyond the \nprinciples. But Lydia, I do agree with you that -- that it tends to be bad business for federal agencies to dictate a \nparticular type of technology that should be used, right? And there -- there should be some broader terms that can \nbe used about electronic means or -- or whatever as opposed to -- because you're right, we'll be sitting here five \nyears from now and with technology moving as quickly as it is we may be talking about blockchain, we may be \ntalking about something else and we haven't conceived that yet. So, I -- I do want to say that I -- I at least agree \nwith that -- with that point a little more narrowly.\n\nSHEEHAN: Do any of the IAC members on the phone want to ask a question at this point in time? Okay, it doesn't \nsound like it.\n\nSo, what I'd like to do is call up the next panel. The current panel can stay. I don't know. Stephen, you want to put \nthem on there. And then we also should have Professor Rock. So while we're checking the technology link, why \ndon't I go ahead and introduce the second panel quickly, and then turn it over. Professor Rock will be our first \nspeaker.\n\nSo, Ed Rock is the Martin Lipton professor of Law at New York University School of Law and also the director of the \nInstitute for Corporate Governance and Finance at the same university. Long ...\n\nROCK: (Inaudible), right, right.\n\nSHEEHAN: Long history in the corporate governance area and really one of the experts. I think the Committee got \na copy of his hanging chad paper sent around, which for some was sort of the seminal work on this whole issue. \nSo, and then ...\n\nROISMAN: (Inaudible).\n\nSHEEHAN: ... Lyell Dampeer from Broadridge, President of Investor Communication Solutions at Broadridge \nFinancial, responsible for Broadridge's U.S. regulatory communication services and its issuing transfer agency. So \nI -- Lyell, I know you're going to have a lot of questions. And then finally Alexander Lebow, cofounder of SAY. He is \nthe Co-founder and the Chief Legal Officer of SAY, Inc. SAY is a New York-based technology company, speaking \nof technology, built -- that is building tools for shareholder voting engagement and education. So we look forward to \nhearing about that.\n\nUnfortunately, our NASDAQ witness John Zecca is unable to attend. He came down ill last night and is not able to \ntravel, but we do have his statement and it'll be posted on, you know, our website and the committee members. So \n-- and it's unfortunate because NASDAQ did have an experiment. They had done some work in both Estonia and \nSouth Africa on the very issue of blockchain. So I would prefer the members of the committee, as well as others, to \nthe statement that they had submitted and the experience they had there.\n\nSo, let's -- while -- while we're checking to see where Professor Rock is in terms of -- Stephen, do you know if \nAlex's -- Okay.\n\nSo, Lyell, why don't ...\n\n\n\n(UNKNOWN): Five minutes.\n\nSHEEHAN: Five minutes, Okay. So, Lyell, why don't you go ahead and do your statement? And then if he comes \non at the conclusion then we'll go to Professor Rock. And then, Alex, we'll go to you. Thank you.\n\nDAMPEER: Well, good morning.\n\nSHEEHAN: Thank you.\n\nDAMPEER: And thank you for -- thank you to the Investor Advisory Committee and the SEC for allowing me to \nparticipate in this roundtable. I must say it's very exciting for me to be in a room full of people that are actually \ninterested in what I do. It doesn't happen very often. And I look forward to the robust discussion. And in my \n(inaudible) ...\n\nROISMAN: (inaudible) I ...\n\nDAMPEER: ... I have modified them or will modify them to try and answer some of the questions and issues that \nhave been raised particularly around the issue of low hanging fruit and our perspective on that.\n\nI do want to start by saying the U.S. equity markets are incredibly robust, powerful and they're also complex. And \nthe shareholder communication and proxy voting process must reflect some of that complexity. Understanding that \ncomplexity, I think, ends up being very, very important to understand how the process accommodates that. So we \nwelcome this opportunity to provide some insight as to how the process works and data as to the functioning of that \nunderneath that.\n\nI will touch on some of the comments around empty voting, share lending, chain of custody and so on. The -- I -- I \ndo want to say that the aspects of the shareholder communication proxy voting process that Broadridge, with its \nbank and broker clients, has been administered over the last 30 years is accurate, secure and efficient. For over 30 \nyears, the system is proven his flexibility to handle expanding needs of participants and regulators. Thirty years \nago, probably none of the questions raised today were even in anybody's mind. They're very, very important \ntoday.\n\nWe have willingly subjected ourselves over 25 years to independent third party oversight of our activities starting \nthe suggestion by the SEC itself in 1993. They instituted the Independent Advisory Committee -- Steering \nCommittee. We've had that in place for 25 years. It's shared by an independent chair. It has representatives of the \nbank, broker, the shareholder and investor communities. it oversees our activities. It also has participation now from \nthe CII and the -- it's formerly called the Society of -- well, now the Society of Governance Professionals.\n\nWe have independent audits performed by Deloitte & Touche annually on the process and compliance with NYSE \nand SEC regulations in the proxy process. And we provide quarterly vote accuracy reports for the process for \nstreet voting. We do that also for registered voting. When we do that, the information is made available to the \nNYSE. It's made available to the SEC. It's made available to our steering committee and to anyone else upon \nrequest.\n\nWe also are subjected to hundreds of individual audits annually by banks, brokers and issuers who visit and/or \nquestion our capabilities around processing, accuracy, timeliness, and also security, data security, physical security \nand vote security. We're probably unique and that we're (inaudible) probably more than any other financial or \nfinancial services institution in the world because of that relationship. And I do want to mention that Broadridge has \nno economic interest in the outcome of any of the meetings or contests that we're involved in.\n\nWe estimate that the investment that we, with our bank and broker partners, have made in this process over the \nyears is well over $1 billion. We are continuing to invest particularly in cybersecurity at a fairly high rate. It's \nincredibly important. Some data points that support the benefits of investment and technology, as we report in our \nproxy -- ProxyPulse paper that we published this past proxy season, we eliminated the need to send physical \nmaterial to 76 percent of all Street positions. Seventy-six percent of all Street positions were not communicated by \n\n\n\npaper, notice or full package. We estimate the annual savings to issuers as a result of the elimination of print \npostage annually exceeds $1 billion, and that number has continued to grow fairly substantially over time.\n\nAnd lastly, I want to note that 95 percent of all shares voted this past proxy season were voted on electronic \nplatforms. Ninety-five percent of all shares are voted electronically.\n\nWe've been involved in technology and the application of technology as rules have allowed and as technology has \nevolved. I'll give some examples of those. We implemented phone voting. For those who remember what that is, \nit's 20 or so years old. We used to support that touchtone -- I'm sorry, rotary phone dialing up phone voting at one \ntime. None of you would know what that is, probably I do.\n\nInternet voting, mobile voting with responsive design, meaning that it renders properly on whatever device you \nhave. We've implemented QR codes. For those of you who know what a QR, quick response reader on your phone. \nWe have integrated directly into broker websites so that when you log into your broker site you can access all \nshareholder communication. You can vote on that site. The control number is embedded in that communication.\n\nWe've done e-delivery for many, many years. Again, the control number is embedded in that. You do not need to \ntake another step. You can vote right there on your phone or wherever you happen to receive email. We integrate \ndirectly into broker apps. So if you use an app instead of the broker website, we integrate directly and can present \ncommunications and allow you to vote through the broker's app.\n\nWe now -- we can do distribution true cloud channels as they evolve. Examples are Google Drive and Dropbox. We \ncan distribute communications directly to those digital channels based on the investor preference.\n\nWe do support universal ballot. We have processed universal ballots, so technology supports that. I think perhaps it \nwas Arthur noted that the technology allows, in -- in electronic form, the prevention of voting for more directors \nthan you're allowed to, for example. It's still a problem if you do vote on paper. We've built very robust portals for \nbanks, brokers and issuers to allow them to access information real-time necessary to the performance of their \nmeeting duties and/or their regulated responsibilities.\n\nWe are, right now, in -- in beta doing text distribution and text voting. There's some security issues, but we're \ndoing that. We have allowed the use of social media now for issuers to communicate during a solicitation on social \nmedia. We'll continue to explore that.\n\nAnd some of you -- some of you may know, we have built production, distributor ledger or blockchain environment \nfor proxy voting. We have done proxy voting in U.S. and non-U.S. meetings over the last two years. We will \ncontinue to do so. And I'll comment on that in a few minutes. That said, we do think that there continue to be \nsignificant opportunities to enhance the process through technology, but I think also through education. I'll comment \non four of those though.\n\nThe first one is a reconciliation of voting entitlement prior to the meeting date. Now there's been a lot of discussion \nabout that this morning. The reason that this is complicated and it mirrors the U.S. equity market process. There are \nmultiple record-keeping systems in the U.S. There's the transfer agent, the bank and broker record-keeping system \non behalf of the clients. You have the central depository like DTCC, and you will have investors as well, particularly \ninstitutional investors, will also have record-keeping systems. Those do need to be reconciled on a real-time basis \nfor this process to work well.\n\nI think what's not clear, but I do want to make very clear, that information to do that reconciliation is available today. \nIt is available to tabulators and it is available to solicitors in the case of contest. You have a tabulator in all regular \nannual meetings. You have solicitors representing both sides in the case of a contest that ultimately -- the \ninformation that eventual ultimately aggregated at the inspector level. But the information on all of those cases \ntoday to determine who has voting entitlement, whether or not shares have been lent, whether those rights have \ngone and whether or not the chain of custody is broken, all of that information is available today.\n\n\n\nWe led an industry pilot two years in a row to demonstrate that, in fact, this is possible regardless of the \nconstituents involved. It's not a Broadridge-specific process. It -- some people in this room, I think, participated and \nwere aware of that. We demonstrated that through the information available today, all of those things can be \nidentified and they can be remediated in advance of the meeting.\n\nAll of this is possible today. We did build at our expense where we called a communication tool that provided the \nconstituents. This would be transfer agents, tabulators, DTCC, issuers and so on to not only identify, but then pass \ninformation between those various entities to attempt to remediate brakes or clarification around entitlement. That's \nall possible.\n\nThe thing that I -- I do want to point out, the information is available. I think most people that are in the -- in the \nplumbing as I am understand that. That information is not used today. I don't know why it's not used. It is only used \nafter the fact to point out that there are problems with overvoting. That seems disingenuous at least because the \ninformation is available, can be used, and you can get that reconciliation.\n\nThe information is available shortly after record date. The average solicitation in the United States is about 45 days. \nThere's plenty of time to do this.\n\nThe industry pilot has demonstrated, in fact, it's possible but you need all players to participate. It's not just a \nBroadridge, it's not a monopoly kind of discussion. Everybody simply needs to participate. The fact that it's not \nused -- again, I'm -- I'm -- say again I think this is ingenuous. This can be accomplished today through cooperation \nand does not require any regulation.\n\nThe second thing I'll talk about is vote confirmation. We have been providing vote confirmation for 10 years or \nlonger. So this idea that vote confirmation doesn't exist is not true. It's just factually not a true statement. We do \nprovide confirmation. We are only able to do it though today when we are the tabulator, so we have the information \nnecessary. We do tabulate U.S. meetings, not just on the Street side.\n\nWhen we do that tabulation for over 10 years, we provide confirmation to our institutional users on our proxy edge \nplatform. It can be done, and we have also provided confirmation to retail and registered shareholders at the \nrequest of the issuer. Technology allows that. It's a very straightforward process. It does require this reconciliation \nto take place.\n\nAnd in the industry pilot that we ran, we were able to do confirmation across the industry for all constituents. It is not \na process depending on a single actor. That's very, very important for me to know here. That should be done. We \nbelieve confirmation should be done. It does require everybody to agree to participate. It's not that complicated. It's \na very straightforward reason -- a very straightforward process.\n\nAnd I want this group to understand that this is easy to do. If there's anything this group could do or the SEC could \ndo it is to encourage or perhaps require that the constituents that participate in this process, in fact, engage in \nreconciliation and engage in vote confirmation.\n\nTechnology allows it. It can be more sophisticated than it is today. When we do provide confirmation today, we're \ndoing it electronically so that nobody is paying to send out something in the mail. That's a the possibility, but that \nincurs significant incremental expense. So we do support confirmation. We think it should be done.\n\nThe third comment I would make is around shareholder engagement participation. I think there is sort of a balance \nbetween how do shareholders do they want to be communicated with, particularly retail holders? And if so, how do \nthey want to be communicated with?\n\nCertainly, we would all agree that the technology today through multiple channels, and there's paper, there's \ntraditional email, you have text, social media and cloud channels and probably other ones evolving in the near-\nterm. But technology can create innovative and customized experiences to communicate right down to the \nindividual shareholder. Just like you go on Amazon, they'll tell you what you should buy. The same kind of idea, \n\n\n\nalthough a little spooky may also apply in this case. Technology allows that today, so it creates really exciting \nopportunities to drive engagement and participation through technology, but the shareholder today must consent to \nreceive things in electronic form.\n\nThat's not the case. Registered shareholders are consent to receive materials electronically. Maybe 25 percent of \nthe time is more like 15 percent of the time that shareholder -- registered shareholders even consent to receive \nthings electronically. On the Street side, it's probably north of 65 or 70 percent. The brokers have done a much \nbetter job of encouraging participation for receipt of electronic materials. That needs to be dealt with simply saying \nthat technology will solve it, but the shareholder not willing to receive it that way prevents that from being an \navenue.\n\nWe think incentive fees, the regulator incentive fees are on preference management and enhanced broker and a \nplatform fee that was instituted in 2014 have had an impact because it's incented brokers to -- to gather consent, \nnot only email address but the actual consent currently required so that all issuers collectively benefit from that \nability to communicate.\n\nI want to point out that when you send some comments about having to get control numbers, all of that is exactly \nright. If you get something in the mail, you can vote on the VIF. You can send it back. You can go to a website.\n\nIf you get a notice in the mail, you have to go to the Internet and enter your control number. If you lose that notice, \nyou don't have a control number. If you receive something, an email email or the other digital channels, it's an -- the \ncontrol number that you need is encrypted and embedded in the email, so you don't need to do anything other than \nclick. It takes you right to the voting site. The unique identifier presents you with the agenda and so.\n\nSo I think understanding that the investor needs to be persuaded and the ones that have been most successful, the \nbanks and brokers in persuading investors to receive material electronic -- certainly, it's in their own interest as well \nso they don't have to send your physical statements. But it is not universal. This idea that it is universal is actually \nthe facts don't support that right now.\n\nThe fourth comment I'd make is around distributed ledger or blockchain. There's certainly been comments about \nthat. We believe that it's an ideal use case. The annual meeting process for the reason I already cited around \nreconciliation. It requires for the process to work real-time reconciliation of disparate record-keeping systems. It \ndoesn't require all the systems themselves, the record-keeping systems to move the blockchain. It does require that \nthose participants that have those records agree to operate on a shared distributed ledger. If that were done, you \nwould get the reconciliation, and again all constituents can participate.\n\nThere are other service providers in our space. We are not the only one in here, so I -- I won't accept the M word \ntoday. But there are other service providers. If all are willing to participate, blockchain is a solution.\n\nWe have processed U.S. meetings and non-U.S. meetings starting in May of 2017, so the technology works. \nPeople have access to that. You create immutable record of entitlement of voting and results. All of that is correct, \nall of that is true. We're going to continue to invest in this.\n\nBut the value is only going to be recognized when all the constituents, in fact, agree to participate on the ledger. \nAnd that's -- that's technical work for people. Those of you that are familiar with the technology, you need to \noperate a node. Even on a private chain, you need to do -- excuse me, do work in order to validate, build the blocks \non the shared ledger.\n\nTo date, unfortunately, Broadridge is the only in these meetings that has actually done that. So while it is distributed \nledger technology, the ledger, frankly, is only distributed to Broadridge\n\nWe need other people to participate and we would encourage that to happen again. It doesn't require regulation for \nthis to take place. It requires encouragement. People could be mandated to use that.\n\n\n\nI will comment from a retail shareholder point of view, which is a little different than the use case in Estonia that \nNASDAQ would have spoken about, but there you have a digital ID. If you can imagine now as a shareholder that \nyou have a digital ID and it could be provided by different service providers and you need to get that particular \nsecure digital ID because it's not going to be sent to you because it needs to be secure. You need to go find that in \norder to vote.\n\nThere's a -- there's a challenge there. If you think about retail participation, you may potentially be adding another \nstep to that. That needs to be understood and do the current voting platforms continue to exist, but perhaps the \nrecordkeepers and the issuer contribute directly into the ledger, meeting date, record date and so on.\n\nI also want to comment on this -- the record date comment share lending. The -- the record dates in the majority of \ncases the United States, in fact, are known in advance. Now we provide that information today to our custodian \nbanks and brokers. That -- that information, the record date is known in advance. In almost all cases, I'm sure there \nare small-cap companies where it's not true.\n\nWe -- we have -- we do provide this information, particularly the custodian banks. They have large institutional \ninvestor -- the large institutional shareholders because they do need to know this to manage their share lending \nactivities. That said, our experience has been that absent the agenda, which is not known in virtually any case \nbefore the record date, not knowing the agenda, it doesn't do a lot for institutional investors to say, Okay, here's the \nmeeting date, I want to call my shares back, but do I want to call them back if there's nothing of substance on the \nagenda.\n\nAgain, you had cited the example of calling back in all cases because you don't know what's on the agenda. So, \nthe timing is still a little mismatch. Record date is known in advance of record date. Agenda is known after, so \nmaybe there's a way to think about that.\n\nThe comment about electronic delivery on contest, and I'll say certainly shame on us that that's not available. It's -- \nthe reason it's not available -- because they had never been asked. In 30 years of doing this, there was never an \ninstance where an issuer or solicitor asked us to send contested material electronically because, as Arthur said \nearlier, the -- if you want somebody to vote, historically, you sent the holder a retail or a registered holder a full \npackage. The likelihood of voting is substantially higher.\n\nNo one, issuer or solicitor, until the ADP and P&G contest had ever asked us to do this; we didn't build them. We \nare building it now. We'll absolutely have it. We didn't build it because there's no demand. There is the demand \nnow.\n\nArthur's point, I think, is very important though. Notice an access on the retail shareholder participation has been \nreduced significantly. E-delivery is not necessarily driving that to new heights. It's not driving participation to new \nheights. They are voting actively and they -- e-recipients voted a higher rate than mailed notice recipients.\n\nBut there is a knowledge that mailed notice recipients don't vote. I think something like under five percent of all \nretail holders that receive a notice actually vote. It's been known that -- that -- that was the information we had \nprovided in advance of the rulemaking in 2007, and that's still the case. I think issuers know that, so it -- I think \nknowing those facts that people can modify the way they wish to solicit and communicate with the shareholders, the \ntechnology is not an obstacle.\n\nI'll stop there and be happy to answer other questions.\n\nSHEEHAN: Thanks. Thank you. Professor Rock, I believe should be with us. I know he's on the phone and he \nshould be also on the (inaudible).\n\nROISMAN: (inaudible). Can you guys hear me out there?\n\nSHEEHAN: We can hear you. You may want to speak up a little bit.\n\n\n\nROISMAN: Okay, Okay. It is -- it's a pleasure to -- to be with you today unfortunately because of (inaudible) of \ngood technology, I can actually see you, but I've been listening in. And -- and I know a bunch of my friends is out \nthere, so hello everybody.\n\nThis is -- this is a topic that we're so converted I have been working on for a long time. We published an article back \nin 2008. What's so interesting is that none -- none of the problems we identified then have been solved in the -- in \nthe interim.\n\nWhat -- what's really interesting to me is the sort of story that we never took different periods for -- for the earlier \n(inaudible), story about the overvoting and (inaudible) where there are 80 million votes cast even though there are \nonly 60 million shares outstanding as a (inaudible). This (inaudible) a story, simply a story that I heard from Brian \nSchorr about Procter & Gamble about the investor with a large bank who casted votes, and they weren't counted. \nAnd they weren't counted because there was a problem with the custodian having changed its name or having \nmerged. And it turns out they hadn't been counted for 10 years that nobody had told the investor that the shares \nwent up the accounting.\n\nAnd when you think about the system, I wouldn't really think of the point (inaudible) in the discussion earlier. I think \nshe's right that we don't want to be talking about what technology is the right technology to use because none of us \nknow very much about technology and technology changes.\n\nI think the (inaudible) is sad to say what do we want from the voting system. What's the minimum that we want won \nin terms of a building system. And that's something I think a lot of us could contribute to, but my -- my basic sort of \n(inaudible) in the back of an envelope of what I would like for the voting system it starts with a preliminary \nshareholder list the week before the record thing so that shareholders would be able to check their positions to \nmake sure that they are what they thought so there's time to fix things such as a wrong name to recall shares that \nare out on loan or whatever. And I think Lyell makes a good point though, you don't get to have the agenda prior to \nthe record date so you could make an intelligent decision whether to call back shares.\n\n(Inaudible) record date, shareholders should receive a unique voting code. There are obviously security \nconsiderations and making sure that we can do that in a secure way. And then the voting code should allow \nshareholders to go online and cast their votes using the code is an immediate indication that the vote has been \naccepted or rejected by the tabulator.\n\nIf a shareholder changes his or her mind, the shareholder should be able to go back online and change their vote. \nAnd if the vote isn't counted, the investor should be paid back and given a concise reason so that he or she could -- \ncould fix it going forward.\n\nThese are -- this is a lot to add. In a central security depository service system, this is a pretty straightforward to \ndeliver. We have the system we have (inaudible) people know. And (inaudible) but it's not that hard. We buy things \non Amazon every day. And the technology is there. It's a question of figuring out how to apply the technology to this \n-- to this day and age.\n\nThere is something we clearly one company out there that have delivered this if they are also providing the \ntabulation service. And you heard from Lyell a minute ago that -- that Broadridge can be delivered. I have absolutely \nno doubt that it was (inaudible) integrated into the tabulation and in the sector of election (inaudible) that they could \ndeliver this.\n\nThe problem, of course, is a problem that John Coates raised is that Broadridge is a monopoly. I don't have -- \nanybody has their favorite story for how Broadridge has abused its monopoly position. I don't have particularly \n(inaudible), but I -- by -- one of my other subject is antitrust and I -- I am not a friend of monopoly, and it's -- it's a \nproblem.\n\nThe one question going forward is -- is if we set-up a system on which Broadridge does become the engine for \nproviding us that there's minimal level of -- of voting system robustness to deliver what we think it needs, how we \n\n\n\nhandle the problem is monopoly? And (inaudible) serious problem because I think a problem the SEC should worry \nabout historically. Remember the SEC's first chairman or second -- the third chairman has been manipulated, but \nthe second chairman is William Douglas who was a -- a (inaudible) of antitrust and authored many of the great \nantitrust opinions.\n\nAnd antitrust is the fourth pillar of the SEC's -- the SEC's mission, so the SEC should pay attention to the \ncompetitor concerns and figure out how consistent with fixing the voting system which may require at least at this \npoint using Broadridge to provide the service to figure out how to open up the space through competitive solutions \nusing alternative technologies because, you know, they are out there. There are people who know a lot more about \ntechnology than many of us who, if given an opportunity, to compete in this space would.\n\nIt's not I think technologically a hard problem to solve, so not as hard as a lot of what we take for granted today. \nAnd I think it seems that Douglas had pointed out requires for its basic legitimacy that we let people vote and that \nwe know what they know that they have voted and their vote is not counted. And if there's a problem in the system \nbecause of some merger of some custodian that leads to a problem that they're voting they should find out about it \nand they can (inaudible).\n\nSo let me stop there and yield it there.\n\nSHEEHAN: Thank you. Despite our technological challenges, we appreciate the testimony, speaking of technology.\n\nAlex, I will turn it over to you. Thanks.\n\nLEBOW: All right. Thank you very much and thanks for having me. It's great to be here.\n\nIt's been just over a year since my partners and I started SAY. And when we -- we would talk to people about we \nare working on -- proxy voting, shareholder communications -- people would frequently remark about what a -- \nwhat a complex eye glazing arcane corner of the financial system you've chosen to focus your efforts on to which \nwe would reply exactly, that that's exactly right and that's -- that's exactly the point and that's exactly part of the \nproblem that needs to be solved, that this is a system that's long overdue for reform. It lacks transparency. It lacks \naccountability, auditability. It's extremely complex and -- and perhaps, worst of all, extremely costly.\n\nAnd despite all that, to echo Allison's point, it's actually a really important system, really important that it works well \nbecause it's the principal avenue for the exercise of the shareholder franchise in the United States, which is \nsomething that is -- is very important. To quote -- quote from Chancellor Bill Allen, \"It is the ideological underpinning \nupon which the legitimacy of directorial power rests,\" which is a great theoretical quote -- then Chancellor Bill Allen, \nI should say. It's a -- it's a great theoretical quote, but it has important practical implications, particularly with respect \nto mainstream investors who -- who don't participate in the proxy voting system to any meaningful extent as it is \ntoday. And so the question is what is to be done. And I'm very pleased to be hear today to offer a few observations \nand suggestions informed by my experience dealing with the system firsthand and helping to lead a new entrant \ninto the proxy processing and investor communications market.\n\nSo I'll start with a little bit of good news and people have used the term low hanging fruit a bunch today. I do -- I do \nbelieve there is a -- a lot of low hanging fruit to be had in the form of first basic technological improvements and -- \nand second, simple rule changes. And so I'll start with basic technological improvements.\n\nI think we all agree and we've all heard today there's a -- a shocking deficiency in the types of technology, really \nlack of technology that's being employed in the system. And I'd say we have the opportunity to look anew at the \nsystem and do things like utilize APIs as opposed to older, slower methods of communication between entities. \nWe've develop directly for mobile environments, employed basic principles of user experience and design.\n\nAnd the -- the returns have been promising that we've seen increased engagement, things like lower delivery \nfailures and hence, lower costs. And there's a lot more that we're doing and a lot more to be said on that point -- on \n\n\n\nthat point, but I also want to mention the opportunity for -- what I think are simple rule changes to encourage \nmarket-based reforms in the system.\n\nAnd one thing that we haven't talked about today is the -- the processing fee schedule and the incentives that it \ncreates, which I think frankly are bad incentives for the market and that it incentivizes distribution over voting and \nengagement. Just take an example, imagine a -- a mutual fund doing a -- a shareholder vote to amend its \ngovernance structure in some way. It's well-known this is a -- a pretty painful and expensive process for mutual \nfunds, particularly with a lot of retail ownership.\n\nAnd if you think about what's happening here, you know, the more that needs to be sent the higher the total cost in \nthe fund, obviously. So the lower -- the likelihood of people actually opening and voting, the more reminders need \nto be sent, the more mail needs to be sent, and then the higher total cost on the -- on the fund will be, which \ndoesn't really make sense. Those incentives should be realigned to encourage voting.\n\nFor example, this is just a proposal. Take a portion of the current fee schedule and have it only be collectible upon \nreceipt of a vote and leave it up to the -- the market participants, to people who create the voter instruction forms \nand so forth to figure out what -- what methods and care can be taken to actually encourage, incentivize their \npresumably desirable behavior of people -- of people voting. So I'll move on. There's a lot of other line, so I'll move \non from that. But I do think most of us would agree there's still some big reform that's needed in the system. And -- \nand some of you maybe wondering, so I'm going to talk about blockchain. And the answer is yes.\n\nBut I'll say -- I'll say this, I would be aware of the -- the blockchain silver bullet. I think there's no doubt that the \ntechnology holds great promise for its potential applications in the space. But I keep two of the question in mind. \nFirst question, how will the blockchain be governed? And second question is what -- what advantage does \nblockchain technology have over pre-existing database technology?\n\nSo, first question, how will -- how will it be governed? When -- when people hear the word blockchain, they -- they \npicture this decentralized trust list egalitarian system where anyone can join and participate and there's no central \nauthority. And that's sort of public blockchain is exactly what underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum \nand it's certainly a great innovation.\n\nBut for -- for enterprise applications like proxy voting, that doesn't really work because of the need to validate \nparticipants to ensure that only the right entities, brokers, banks, intermediaries and so forth are actually taking part, \nand that necessarily requires some degree of centralized management, unified single entity or -- or consortium of \nentities or perhaps a regulator to create and manage permissioning protocols, so this close ecosystem. And this is \nwhat's known as a permission blockchain as opposed to a public blockchain.\n\nAnd that's -- you know, a big big question is who or what will have the power of creating and managing these \npermission protocols, in other words, of running the proxy voting blockchain. And in answering that question, I \nthink it should be a top priority to distribute power and control and promote competition as opposed to allowing a \nsingle entity to retain control or take control over a new system and -- and perhaps be able to charge for access to \nthat system.\n\nSecond big question about blockchain, what advantages blockchain have over preexisting database technologies? \nYou know, when we go through all the technical qualities of blockchain, it's -- you know, it's decentralized, it's \ntrustless, robustness, performance. I think there's no clear technological argument over -- for its superiority over \npre-existing database technologies in this context. So the big -- big question is what is it about blockchain that \npeople find so appealing apparently so enticing?\n\nYou know, I -- I referred back to Vice Chancellor Laster's great speech on that subject from 2016, and I found \nmaybe the kernel of an answer if you allow me to quote two Delaware jurists in one speech. He said, quote, \"The \ntechnology could reunite legal and beneficial ownership. Custodians become unnecessary. Ownership lies only with \nbeneficial owners. A single distributed ledger would allow straight through accounting, a utopian vision of share \nownership where there is only one type of owner, record owners.\"\n\n\n\nSo if you think about it, I think -- I think what -- what people are grasping for here has -- has little or nothing to do \nwith distributive ledger technology itself and everything to do with what its adoption would mean for breaking this \ndisjointed market of intermediaries, and Street name ownership, and NOBOs and OBOs, and the misalignment of \ninterest and lack of competition that it has created. The prospect of changing that, I think, is -- is what's so exciting \nabout blockchain.\n\nSo, think back to that mutual fund doing a shareholder vote and imagine that it chooses a proxy services provider \nbased on the services that they provide from a healthy competitive market and it pays that service provider a rate \ndetermined by the forces of the free market. We don't need blockchain to make that a reality. It could come in the \nform of what Professor Rock has proposed a dematerialization scheme, a central aggregator scheme.\n\nBlockchain is one -- one solution, but we don't need that -- we certainly don't need that to get there. And there -- \nthere are other reforms that are much simpler, much more likely to be adopted expeditiously and they're based on \ntechnologies that have been in the financial system for decades.\n\nSo my final word for you to suggest to the -- to the Committee and -- and to everyone listening to is would be think \nabout, you know, what it is we're really after and when we talk about blockchain and -- and think about this market \nand -- and just go after that directly. Thank you.\n\nSHEEHAN: Thanks. Before I turn it to questions for the folks here, I'm going to ask our committee members on the \nphone if any of them have questions for the -- either the last two panelists or last three panelists or any of the \npanelists. Nope, Okay.\n\n(UNKNOWN): None for me. Thank you.\n\nSHEEHAN: All right. Okay. So ...\n\nWALTER: None for me.\n\nSHEEHAN: Not -- Okay. Thanks, Elisse. All right. So then we will go to the Committee members here. So, Matt, \nwhy don't I start with you and then we'll go to Damon and then Mina, and then J.W.\n\nFURMAN: I'm curious, you know, that the Commission has lots of things on its potential agenda, lots of potential \npriorities and limited resources. Where would you put the -- the very significant changes that would be required to \nget to some of the -- the angles we're talking about? Where would -- some of the participants put that on the list of \npriorities that the Commission should have? Should this be, you know, very much near the top and have a -- a real \npush from the top to get done or is this or are we fixing a problem that is a very significant problem in the very \nunusual cases where you have a close vote, but maybe is fine, you know, other parts of the times. So just get -- \none, get a sense of prioritization.\n\nSHEEHAN: Lyell?\n\nDAMPEER: Sure, awesome. Let me speak to that. If you think about reconciliation and confirmation, that's two of \nfundamental ideas that have been discussed on both of the panels this morning. I would suggest again that both of \nthose are possible and they're doable today and they should be done today. I don't know if that requires -- it \ndoesn't require new rules. It may require encouragement. It may -- it may be requirement that, in fact, the \nconstituents participate in reconciliation and confirmation, but it does not require other rules to allow that to happen.\n\nIt should happen. It's -- I think that should be at the top of the list to address the point that shareholders have a \nfundamental right to vote and to know that their vote counts. And it's easy to do today. And this idea that it's very \ncomplicated and everything needs to be changed -- things can be changed. I'm not saying that there can't be \nchanges, but it would be a mistake, I suggest, that we don't get after those two things today because they can be \ndone now.\n\n\n\nIt's been demonstrated in industry pilot with lots of participants. It's not that complicated. Yes, there's work to be \ninvolved in that. It should be done. It should be encouraged or required.\n\nReconciliation and confirmation does not require changes in underlying technology. Those could be used or not. It \ndoesn't matter. And I think that's important for this group to understand.\n\nIt doesn't require new technologies. New technologies can be involved. It doesn't prevent them. It doesn't entrench \nanyone service provider, which I think is a concern here. I understand that. And all people can do this and \nshareholders do have that right. We support that.\n\nAs I said, we've been providing vote confirmation for over a decade. It's not that complicated. We do it. We'd be \nhappy to continue doing it and we've demonstrated with industry pilot that people can do this and should do it.\n\nBERTSCH: So ...\n\nSHEEHAN: Ken ...\n\nBERTSCH: Yeah.\n\nSHEEHAN: ... and then Alex.\n\nBERTSCH: So I agree with that. I think there are some things that could be done that are not that difficult that we \nshould go ahead and do. Allison made the point about how important this is. I mean, this undergirds the whole \nsystem. So I think we should be doing the thinking about long-term solutions, as I said -- said earlier as well as \naddressing things we can do in the short-term.\n\nAs a fairly high priority, I would definitely prioritize it over a number of things like thinking about eliminating quarterly \nreporting, onerous regulation of proxy advisors that's intended to put them out of business. A -- a few other things \nthat I think that Nancy should not waste his time with, but, you know, the -- the -- the transaction fee pilot that \nyou're, I think, talking about over lunch, I think that's -- that's fair. There are a number of important issues that need \nto be addressed at once, I think so.\n\nSHEEHAN: Alex?\n\nLEBOW: I -- I think it's really very important and the reason why is -- is you have a generation of -- of new investors, \nyoung investors who are coming into their own and becoming larger investors. And they -- they don't participate in \nthe system at all. And it's -- it -- long-term the risk is that their -- their faith in the capital markets is eroded. They \ndon't feel like they're participating. There's an entire second half of investing. You know, there's the financial rights \nthat are associated with equity ownership and the -- the governance rights, the voting rights. This whole half of \ninvesting is missing for a generation of people.\n\nAnd I think over the long-term, what that means for society, what it means for -- for the country is -- is significant. So \nit's -- I think it's quite important it should be the top of the list.\n\nSHEEHAN: Any of the other panelists?\n\nROCK: Can I jump in here?\n\nSHEEHAN: Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.\n\nROCK: So we called -- well, (inaudible) an article in 2008 \"The Hanging Chads\" of corporate voting, obviously, a \nreference to the 2000 presidential election. You know, the hanging chad ballot in Florida worked really well long \ntime, and it didn't work one year. But, you know, who knows that there'd be another year that it didn't work. But the \nproblem is that when it doesn't work, it's really awful. And voting played such a fundamental role in both the \npolitical context and the corporate context that if our technology is not up to what we needed to be up to, we need \nto fix it.\n\n\n\nSHEEHAN: Thank you. Let's see, Damon?\n\nSILVERS: So -- so I wanted to -- I wanted to pick up on a question that came up both in the last panel and in this \npanel. It's from -- from a number of different people in different ways, which has to do with the -- the -- the question \nof the desire of issuers to have access to the -- to direct access to beneficial holders. But before I do, I'm -- I'm just \ntaken by what Ed just said, and I think it's worth noting in this conversation that the -- the -- the legal -- the legal \nfoundations of the idea that this is a process that where -- where shareholders' suffrage and idea of one share, one \nvote very different than a political context with one person, one vote. The -- the -- the legal foundations of these \nconcepts and what they have real bite is not here at the Commission and its rules, but rather in state law.\n\nAnd -- and -- and so I think there's -- there's some irony in the notion that somehow the Commission is -- the \nCommission is -- I mean, the Commission has the authority to make sure the proxy solicitation processes is -- is not \nwith fraud and is fair and accurate to everybody. That's the -- that's where there's been a -- a federal preemption. \nBut going back to state law and going back to Delaware, and this area is actually going back to a tougher regime in \nrelationship to the fundamental principles that a number of people have raised.\n\nNow with that idea in mind and this sort of notion of sort of fundamental fairness, I want to come back to this \nquestion that -- of the -- of -- of direct access to beneficial holders because I think it's a conversation that's \nhappened many, many times in the space. And -- and I want to note that at least it's the position of, I think, many \ninstitutional investors that Broadridge, in this respect, is a kind of -- is a kind of benevolent monopoly, meaning that \nit's obviously a monopoly. Broadridge may charge too much.\n\nIt's regulated by the SEC much as other types of monopolies. And Ken alluded to this before, natural monopolies \nare. But the key thing that Broadridge does is that it's a -- is that it's a -- a neutral arbiter of communication and has \n-- and has been that way in a fairly -- I mean, everybody is unhappy one moment or another, but that it's -- it's a \nfairly -- a fairly neutral party.\n\nThe promise of blockchain in this area, some people may be amused to -- to -- to hear that I -- I think this is quite \npossible. The promise of blockchain is that it could sort of substitute a neutral technology for a neutral -- for a \nneutral firm. But my question is -- so my question is this, for those people who have advocated that in some form or \nanother through some technology or other that that registrants -- I mean, that issuers get direct access to beneficial \nholders, and -- and the argument that -- that -- that doing this through Broadridge somehow doesn't -- doesn't work.\n\nWhat would -- what would your review be on how to ensure that shareholders got that -- that equal access to that \nlist and -- and equal opportunity to communicate with -- with -- with beneficial holders in the -- in the world that -- \nthat you would be advocating that -- that Commission moved to. And in this respect, I'm asking those. I know that \nDeborah said this. I think that -- that David may have said it. Those who are advocating for this notion that there be \n-- that issuers have direct access, how would you propose maintaining a level playing field?\n\nDAMPEER: I mean, that level -- that level playing field essentially exist right now. I mean, as -- as the system is set-\nup and again this is at least for Delaware companies. If a company requests a list of NOBO holders and a \nshareholder under state statute, Delaware statute, requests shareholder records, the issuers obliged to turn that \nNOBO list over to the shareholder.\n\nSILVERS: I'm -- I'm asking a different question, which is in the -- are you suggesting that -- are you suggesting that \nyou think that the current system is biased against the issuer that the issuer can't communicate with that list?\n\nDAMPEER: No, I'm not -- I'm not suggesting that the system is biased.\n\nSILVERS: Right.\n\nDAMPEER: I mean, what I am suggesting is that if the goal is to encourage more individual holders to vote, one of \nthe ways that we think that can happen is to permit direct communication from an issuer or for a dissident in a proxy \nfight to ensure a level playing field that there's direct -- direct communication with them.\n\n\n\nSILVERS: All right. So you'd be in favor of extending that. I'm not -- in some ways I'm not surprised that you are, \nbut -- given your business model. But -- but ...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n... but you'd be in favor of both sides having equal access to -- to beneficial holder list?\n\nDAMPEER: Absolutely. I don't see how you can conduct what would be considered a fair election by having access \nto only -- giving only one side access to a significant group of shareholders.\n\nFURMAN: What -- just clarifying for me at least, my understanding is -- is that you are right that, in fact, there is \nequal access to the list, but how up-to-date and how current that list is -- is within the control of the issuer.\n\nDAMPEER: And whether or not they get a list in the first place.\n\nFURMAN: Right. So if the issuer doesn't have a list or the list is outdated, the shareholder, the dissident -- there's \nnothing the dissident can do to say, Okay, can you update it to the list from two years ago is not really helpful.\n\nDAMPEER: But -- but it's also something that at least certainly with respect to Delaware is a matter of state law.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Right.\n\nDAMPEER: Can I just make one comment on that please? It's not -- and I know there's the view of Broadridge sort \nof perhaps coming up the works in the middle. I just -- I also need to comment on the fees. The fees are the \nbroker's fees. Broadridge doesn't have fees as they're not Broadridge fees whatever whether you think they're too \nhigh or too low, the fees -- regulated fees of the banks and brokers.\n\nAll shareholder proponents, management opposition can communicate with shareholders. What the current set of \nregulations prohibit is the disclosure of names and addresses and share positions, in some cases, particularly if \nyou're a NOBO. So the current policy is that you do not have to disclose identity as a condition of share ownership. \nThat's the current policy and hence you have this OBO/NOBO distinction.\n\nThat could certainly be changed and there are markets around the world where, in fact, as a condition of ownership \nyou need to disclose identity. That could be a policy change. There certainly very strong views on both sides of \nthat, but it could be accommodated.\n\nThat said, dissidents for a proponents or issuers can communicate freely with issuers. So -- I mean, I'm sorry, with \ntheir shareholders ...\n\n(UNKNOWN): Right, yeah.\n\nDAMPEER: ... to simply say distribute this material and the banks and brokers are obligated to onward -- work \nforward that information to their underlying clients and hold that security. And has been discussed, commonly is a \nsubset of shareholders that are communicated with particularly in the contest. But the policy could be changed to \nrequire disclosure across the board and the strong views on that. We don't have a dog in that fight.\n\nSILVERS: And, Lyell, this is the question I was asking, which I said, are those who -- are those on this panel who \nhave been asking that the issuer be given access to the identities and whole and positions of beneficial holders, are \nthey comfortable with that -- with -- with that information being made available to everyone with an interest in the \nelection and in the vote or they're asking exclusively for themselves.\n\nFURMAN: I, as a matter of state law, and this is what others were getting at, you could not restrict that to just the \nissuer. The question I would have is, I think, you would need to make sure that, you know, the SEC or some other \nagency had very strict limitations on what that information can used for and had penalties for misuse of it.\n\n\n\nSILVERS: I would add just on top of that. I think it was said before, there certainly would be -- we would need to \nconsider -- you would need to consider how the underlying shareholder would feel about their information, name, \naddress and position being made generally available. Even if the purposes of use were severely restricted, the fact \nthat the information would be out in the public some place. It would be a significant concern, and that's a policy \nissue that I suggest would have to be dealt with.\n\nROPER: Anne, can I just jump in ...\n\nSHEEHAN: Barb, yeah.\n\nROPER: ... really, really quickly, just quickly on your point, Damon. I mean, oh, you're absolutely right. We agree in \nfairness in -- in these.\n\nThe one thing though that I would say that goes to the point Lyell just made is in circumstances with registereds \nwhere -- where, you know, Trian could reach out and contact them directly, we did get flow back from that, right, \nwith shareholders contacting us and saying, \"What do you think you're doing giving my information out to them?\" \nYou know, my relationship is with you, not with anyone else.\n\nAnd so I'm not saying that's governing, but I just say it to Lyell's point. There -- there are a bundle of issues here \nthat -- that -- that -- that have to be addressed if in -- and I wouldn't argue otherwise.\n\nSHEEHAN: Okay. We're good. All right. Mina and then J.W., and then I think Jennifer had her card up, yeah.\n\nNGUYEN: Great. I have a point of clarification. I think, Lyell, you said vote confirmation is 100 percent available and \nthat you've piloted this.\n\nI think, David, you mentioned in your remarks that it is not available unless I missed that.\n\nKATZ: I can't speak to whether the technology is available. I can tell you it's not used to -- I mean, people can't \nconfirm that their votes have been counted. They can't -- you know, the example Brian gave a -- a significant fund \nthat's been voting for 10 years and has an added shares counted. You know, somebody knew that, but it was \nnever communicated back to the holder. And -- and the holder had no way of knowing, you know, that there was a \nway to find out because it has in the past.\n\nI mean, I've had investors actually say, \"Look, I've tried to confirm that my shares have been voted and all I know is \nthat, you know, it's been -- it's going through the electronic system, but I don't know anything more than that. I don't \nknow whether it was counted or not counted, et cetera.\"\n\nBERTSCH: Yes, I would just say in addition to that, our -- our members do not feel like they actually have vote \nconfirmation, in most cases. So setting aside a proxy contest and the -- and the inspector in that whole process \nwhere you don't have that.\n\nIt's only true if Broadridge is the tabulator. I'm -- I'm not sure how much of the market Broadridge has for tabulation, \nbut the -- other -- other folks have not been cooperative for whatever reason. I'm not going to get between them, but \nit doesn't actually work in practice from the -- from a institutional investor standpoint.\n\nDAMPEER: I would (inaudible) Ken just said. So we are -- both confirmation is available today full stop. It is not \navailable in all cases full stop, and I think that's where the problem is. The opportunity to provide it in all cases, \nconfirmation or not confirmation, is absolutely doable and possible today. And it should be encouraged or required, \nso we have been doing it. It does exist. It is not universally available.\n\nNGUYEN: What percentage of the market do you have?\n\nDAMPEER: A trick question.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nWe tabulate about 50 percent of U.S. meetings as the agent of the issuer, approximate 50 percent of the meetings. \nWe provide a confirmation for our ProxyEdge users a proprietary platform that institutional investors use to manage \ntheir voting process, and they receive confirmation through the whole chain. We perceive their vote, we've \naccepted their vote. It's been voted in the final tabulation as instructed or not.\n\nBERTSCH: Yeah. Oh, just to be clear, I think what Brian talked about where it goes into the inspector of large \n(inaudible) in the snake pit, you can't really confirm that.\n\nDAMPEER: Well, because this contest is interesting and I think of P&G is a little bit different. Maybe I'll make a \nmore general comment here. But in a contested election there is no tabulator. It ends up being that, in some sense, \nthat two sides with their solicitors tabulate what they have, the cards that have been returned on their -- for their \nslate or their card. And the inspector's job is then to match those off and determine whether or not a shareholder \nhas voted on both sides, in which case, which is the last one that was in. That is a manual process.\n\nThat does not take place for street holders. That three holders, in their automated way, there's -- we went for the \nstreet positions. We tabulate in a contest. We are real-time determining if Lyell Dampeer voted, which card did he \nvote on? If he voted on multiple times or on multiple cards, what's the last one? We have a record. Every -- every \nsingle time Lyell voted, I mean, record of the last one and that's the one that gets aggregated.\n\nWe provide that information as -- on a daily basis to both sides. It's -- and the soldiers have that information. It ends \nup in the inspector to take the physical proxy cards, not the vote instruction forms distributed to beneficial holders. \nIt's the retail holders that voted on proxy cards that have to be matched off. And that's where the problem comes \nup. And this -- this will sound perhaps self-serving or dangerous that -- because there's not a central processor in a \ncase of a contest, you end up in this position where it cannot be resolved without significant manual intervention in \nthe stories we've just heard today of weeks and weeks and 100,000 cards having to be physically matched off and \nmissing paper clips.\n\nIf there were a central recordkeeping system, it could be a distributed ledger, it could be an entity like Broadridge or \nsomebody else. In that case, you would not have that problem. You still have the challenge around looking at things \nlike chain of custody and someone forgetting to change their name. That persists for 10 years because nobody \ngoes back and tells the entity.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Yeah.\n\nDAMPEER: We don't see that you have voting rights. That's a tabulator obligation in our mind to go back and tell \nthe entity. You don't have voting rights. Through the chain, you've never been given and issued an omnibus proxy \nin your favor for the shares that you hold.\n\nKATZ: Wouldn't it be a simple SEC action to require that, you know, there'd be some type of transparency between \nthe vote in the tabulations somehow?\n\nSCHORR: I -- I think a number of us have said today it's -- something is wrong with the system where you cast \nyour vote, you think it's being counted, and yet somehow along the process, without any fault of your own, that \nvote is either thrown out because of overvoting or undervoting or alternatively, it's thrown out because of some sort \nof other deficiency and no one comes back and says -- it gives you an opportunity to cure. I mean, most things, if \nsomething goes wrong, you get opportunity to cure especially for not voting the night before the election. But if \nyou're voting a week or two before, as many people do, as many institutions do, you should have an opportunity to \nbe able to fix something.\n\nAnd someone should say, you know what, your vote didn't get counted, it got kicked out of the system. And a red \nlight should go on. There should be a flag and -- and, you know, you go back and fix it.\n\nSHEEHAN: Okay. So we've got -- I'm going to have to wrap-up. J.W., Jennifer, Heidi and then Jerry so.\n\n\n\nVERRET: Yeah, I just wanted to offer a -- a thought to kind of expand the discussion. We've talked a lot about \nblockchain technology with respect to tabulation, record-keeping and the promises there. And -- and that's an -- \nthat's an exciting piece of that technology. But it -- we can think much bigger than that.\n\nI -- I -- you know, I've had some fascinating discussions with folks in the Silicon Valley kind of world about using \nblockchain to -- to -- to change the nature of corporate governance in ways that will transcend our current \nunderstanding of corporate governance. And I think we can expect that's a -- that's a vision of the future not only in \n-- in ways that will make current technologies obsolete. Current -- current -- current large portions of the current \ninfrastructure potentially obsolete.\n\nI'm talking about things like on -- on one end of the spectrum, you know, public benefit corporations that use a \ndifferent idea about stakeholder-based focus to more pure, you know, shareholder maximization systems that have \na lot of defrence. But, you know, the problem is you have these exciting discussions with innovators, with \nacademics and then you sit down and talk to a securities lawyer and they say, \"Yep, that violates (inaudible). It \nviolates the Williams Act. It violates the listing requirements.\" Sorry, none of that is possible. Not -- not a single \npiece of that is possible.\n\nAnd you look at something like I want to raise -- at the -- at the risk of raising the temperature here, I want to -- I \nwant to throw out a crypto example, and I want to set aside the 33 Act Registration issues, set that aside. I mean, \nlet's -- let's assume the law is right and let's assume you already have hard and fast views about 33 Act \nRegistration.\n\nThere were some exciting things going on if you study the case of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization, the \nDAO, in corporate governance reform. They were facing problems, they were dealing with problems, they were \nfiguring out new ways for members of that community to communicate with the centralized governance mechanism \nof that entity.\n\nThe SEC came down with a -- with a, you know, interpretation that that fund had violated 33 Act, and it's true and \nthat's fine. But even when we get past that -- those registration issues, they're going to be all kinds of Williams Act \nissues, and -- and proxy solicitation issues and -- and disclosure issues. The SEC and the rules are not ready for \nand weren't made for. Despite the fact that I think, in the end, after some messy growth that can solve a lot of \nproblems we're talking about today. So I hope -- I hope as part of -- of this, as part of the SEC's response to this, \nwe'll get some -- some kind of at least a concept release about doing some big think about the future of -- of \ncorporate governance and -- and how blockchain can not only change reporting and -- and tabulation, but also the \nnature of corporate governance itself.\n\nThere's flexibility in the underlying Delaware LLC law to -- to allow for this now, but there's not if we don't change \nlisting requirements. Maybe that supported the discussion of bringing to venture exchanges or crowd funding \nreform, but also directly allowable we're talking about here Williams Act reform and proxy reform to facilitate \nblockchain innovation and governance. Our hope is going to be a part of this discussion where the SEC does \nsimilar work here. So I just throw all of that out there.\n\nIf you want to comment, that's great. If not, I just put in the record for something that I hope continues to be a part \nof the discussion.\n\nSHEEHAN: Great. Any comments on that one?\n\nBERTSCH: Just certainly, all of these things are related. And so, for example, there's been a fair amount of talk \nrecently about time phase voting, we get extra voting rights or holding for a long period. We don't particularly like \nthat idea, but it hasn't worked on a practical level in the past. And so if -- if you have a blockchain system or \npossibly some of the other systems, you can actually make it work in a way that's not onerous. So -- so I agree that \nthese things are all related to each other.\n\nSHEEHAN: Thanks. Jennifer, and then Heidi.\n\n\n\nMARIETTA-WESTBERG Thank you for your presentations today. I was formerly an economist at the commission, \nso (inaudible) the perspective of if the Commission chooses to engage in rulemaking, they will need to do \neconomic analysis. And so I think it could be helpful to guide them in thinking about how to translate voting \ncomplexities or over (inaudible) economics. Some of the direct costs and benefits such as paper mailings are \n(inaudible) measure than the indirect costs of people not being able to vote or the (inaudible).\n\nMy question is do you think that the Commission has the data that they need to study this issue? Where would you \nsuggest that they look (inaudible) relevant studies, et cetera that could be helpful?\n\nDAMPEER: I'll make a comment just on some of the data, which certainly wouldn't have all the data, but we do \nhave and have provided many times at the exchanges request data that looks at distribution channels, paper \nelectronic platforms like Proxy Edge, also voting response rates by channel and how people do respond. You can \nreceive something on paper and still vote electronically, for example, so there's a crossover there.\n\nWe'd be happy to continue to provide that information. We have information around costs associated with the actual \npostage for things that are physically mailed. We have that and can provide that. We -- there's other pieces of \ninformation we don't have. We do have a very large data set, which was -- we touched on something. It was \nmentioned earlier, but we would be happy to share that.\n\nWe have been instructed or asked to do that. We do it on behalf of our clients and we would be able to provide that \ndata either as large file. It could be sorted different ways or in a structured way that would facilitate that from that \nperspective, so we could provide and we have provided some of that data before.\n\nBERTSCH: I'll just say some of this is challenging for -- for Deborah and Brian. The benefit or cost of having Nelson \nPeltz on the board of P&G, I -- I think that's really hard and I suspect you have different views so.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n(UNKNOWN): (Inaudible).\n\nSCHORR: I'm not sure we have different views. Seriously, oh, obviously it's -- it's hard to quantify. But, you know, if \nyou -- if you take -- if you take the view that having additional voices on the board -- of any board and diversity of \nviews and -- and the ability to have robust conversations and discussions in a boardroom is a good thing. I mean, \nthere's a positive. And how do you measure all that? I mean, you can look at different metrics whether it be TSR or \nEPS growth, you know, EBITDA, you know, whatever -- whatever metrics you want to use, stock price, and you \ndecide which ones you think are important.\n\nBut at the end of the day, you know, you have to start with the assumption that having -- having another voice in the \nboardroom is important and -- and whether it's a dissident shareholder or whether it's a -- having board \nrefreshment, which leads to new views and -- and new faces in the boardroom and new ideas, you know, if you -- if \nyou buy into that theory, then that's all positive.\n\nSHEEHAN: Thanks. Heidi and then Jerry.\n\nSTAM: Just quick comment. I mean, we've heard a lot today about opening up the market to greater competition, \ndo ideas potentially disruption. I'd like to ask Alex if you could just tell us you've been in this business now for just a \ncouple of years, are there barriers to either your firm or to other firms like yourself who would be looking to cause \ntrue change in this environment? And if so, are there of any that are particularly within the purview of the \nCommission to address?\n\nLEBOW: Yeah, I'll just say it's -- it's not a healthy competitive market. We -- you know, there's a -- another thing we \nhaven't mentioned, there's a price, you know, in this market, an artificially enforced price ceiling, which is an \nindication of a market that is not healthy. To run amok would -- would not be good for consumers.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, there's -- there's -- there's a lot where we're competing. We feel pretty good about it, but, you know, \nthere's -- there's quite a bit and I'll let go Ed Rock's comment about competition being one of the Commission's \noriginal mandates and the 33 Act. So yeah, there -- there is.\n\nDAMPEER: Just to clarify, I think Alex' comment is an interesting comment. The fees -- just to clarify again, the fees \nare charged by the banks and brokers and saying Broadridge act as an agent under contract for banks and brokers. \nThe NYSE with SEC provo sets the maximum rate the brokers are going to be reimbursed by issuers for performing \nthe services that are required to perform. So it -- the -- I think some of the consolidation overtime is a direct result of \nthe fees having come down significantly over a long period of time for understandable reasons so we need to \nunderstand that. So it's not as though we're competing on price with the issuers when we compete with SAY. The \nissuer isn't involved in that discussion at all.\n\nSTAM: Right. And I -- I would suggest that this is an area that needs to be addressed because it is also broken. \nAnd I'm not sure that the investors getting the value from -- you know, for what it's costing in the overall system. So \nI would put that on the list of topics to be addressed and, you know, maybe NYSE is not the place for these rules to \nlive.\n\nDAMPEER: It did come -- the last -- the proxy fee advisory committee began work in 2011, I believe concluded their \nwork in 2013 for fees that were changed under -- with their -- their direction approved by the SEC effective Jan. 1, \n2014. It was recommended the fees be reviewed periodically, and we certainly support that.\n\nSTAM: Terrific. Thank you.\n\nSHEEHAN: Right. Okay, Jerry, you get the last.\n\nSOLOMON: Great. Thank you. Thanks to all the panels for coming because I learned a lot today.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Yeah.\n\nSOLOMON: It's not what I do on a daily basis. So, two things, one is I get my proxy email or I get my proxy card \nwith the control number, and I put it in. And it says \"Thank you. Your vote has been registered.\" Furious if that's \nreally to say, well, it's sort of been registered and may not be actually a valid vote.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nThat's the first thing. And the second thing is this for you, Alex. You made a comment saying about mutual funds \nthat they can't get shareholder votes. They should -- part of their fee should be held back. Where is that coming \nfrom? Am I understanding correctly why pick on mutual funds? Why not pick on corporations? And then -- or is it \njust another thing saying maybe mutual fund is a third party? Anybody who's using they should be looking at what \nthird party they use to maximize voter participation. So there are two questions there.\n\nLEBOW: Yeah, the -- so the point is that mutual -- it's -- it's actually in the interest of mutual funds. I think certainly -\n- certainly, the point is that fees are not going up, no new fees. Take a percentage of the current fee and have it \nonly be collectible upon a vote -- receive of a vote, which is presumably what the fund wants, which require them to \ndo what it needs to do.\n\nAnd the -- the reason -- the reason for the suggestion is that it would incentivize the people producing the voter \ninstruction forms who generally keep a -- a portion of the fees to actually encourage voting, just to get the system \nin line with encouraging voting. That's the -- because right now 100 percent of the fees are collected upon \ndistribution and reference management and a few other complex things that have evolved over -- over the years.\n\nWe think -- if we talk about incentive fees, there was an incentive fee to incentivize paper, I would note, as an \naccess. How about an incentive to -- incentive fee to incentivize voting?\n\n\n\nDAMPEER: Just a quick comment and after I -- I understand the point. Today, it's the bank and broker that have \nthe obligation to (inaudible) for the material and collect aggregate voting instructions because they have the -- the \nnominee has the voting rights by law. The beneficial owner has voting rights by contract normally, so why it would \nwork.\n\nAnd if -- if the bank or broker were required to do this and banks or brokers used to do this, so weren't people like \nBroadridge or SAY, if you go back in time, all the banks and brokers did this themselves. And if they were being \nreimbursed to perform the service based on the outcome, you know, you have to have banks and brokers in that \nconversation. They are currently the ones that are regulated and obligated to perform this, and the -- the fee is the \nmaximum. They're allowed to charge for distribution, collection and handing off of the vote to the designated entity \nof the issuer. So I think that -- that would have to be brought into the conversation.\n\nLEBOW: But I guess, to your point though is it -- just -- just thinking about it, we -- the mutual fund or anybody can't \ndo anything unless they get the proper majority to do something. So if nothing is going to happen once they get the \nmajority, which is the -- you want to maximize participation.\n\nDAMPEER: Right, yeah. And I think, you know, you have to model it and think about what the specifics of it. I think \nfee -- total fees would go down under the system. It would be the idea because not 100 percent of people are \nvoting. You'd have to get this since I think it would lower fees overall is what I have in mind.\n\n(UNKNOWN): I still don't get it, but thank you.\n\nSHEEHAN: Okay. I want to thank our panelists. We're running a little bit late for the Committee, but thank you. It \nwas a great discussion and we look forward to continuing the discussion and seeing what can be done on the \ninfrastructure. The goal of this, and I think for our Committee definitely is the proxy plumbing the infrastructure \nsystem itself. There are a lot of other issues that have been mentioned. Both the advisors as well as some of the \nother things, but I think trying to keep a focus right now on the infrastructure is very important because as someone \nsaid, we have been studying this. I think the concept release came out in 2010. This has been an issue that the \nevents have overtaken and it's long overdue to have a look at this system. So, we appreciate your input and will \nfollow up on as the committee moves forward on perhaps a recommendation in this area.\n\nSo, thank you all. The Committee were going upstairs for lunch, and then we will reconvene as a Committee at 1:30 \nback into public session. Thanks.\n\n(RECESS)\n\nSHEEHAN: I'm going to call the Investor Advisory Committee back into order. And we have Commissioner Jackson \nwith us to make some comments.\n\nAnyway, while our members are sort of filtering back in, but nice to see you, Commissioner Jackson. We missed \nyou this morning. Want to say a few things (inaudible)?\n\nJACKSON: Sure. Well ...\n\nSHEEHAN: They'd love to hear from you.\n\nJACKSON: Thanks so much. I'm delighted to be here. And, well, folks, circle back in, I wanted to start by saying \nhow much I appreciate all your work on the issues you're considering today and the questions you discussed this \nmorning, the voting system for corporate elections and how best to ensure that American investors can hold \ncorporate management accountable, these are crucial questions to the future of our markets. And I'm delighted to \nbe here with you.\n\nLet me start by joining my colleagues, and I wasn't here this morning so I really want to make sure I say how \ndelighted I am to welcome our newest Commissioner Elad Roisman to our team here at the SEC. You know, I first \nmet Elad in his capacity at the Senate Banking Committee during my own nomination and confirmation process. \n\n\n\nAnd I discovered what really everybody in Washington already knows, which is he has earned a reputation as a \nfair, thoughtful public servant who puts investors at the forefront of all that he does. I'm truly delighted to have the \nopportunity to work with Elad and his expertise, judgment, and really most of all, his commitment to our mission will \nserve investors well.\n\nAs I say I'm am pleased that the IAC is considering how the voting system can be improved to make sure that \nAmerican investors finally get a better say in how the companies they own are run, and that work is made all the \nmore important by today's announcements from the Office of the Chairman and the Division of Investment \nManagement, which suddenly raised questions about long resolved issues in this area.\n\nBecause the IAC's important work in this area is ongoing, it's important to clarify the path ahead for those of us \ninterested in giving American shareholders real access to the levers of corporate democracy. It's time to get \nsomething done in this area rather than dedicate the staff's time to politically contentious questions about regulating \nthe few firms who advise shareholders how to vote.\n\nThe first thing I want to say today is that the law of proxy advisors is no different today than it was yesterday. The \nCommission has long recognized their proxy advisors, the companies that develop recommendations regarding \nhow investors should vote on corporate questions that they serve an important role in the shareholder voting \nprocess. And today's statements do nothing to change that.\n\nOur staff stands as ready today as they ever have to give investors guidance regarding their use of proxy advisory \nfirms. And investors themselves who have long taken different approaches to how they handle that advice should \nrest assure that the Commission remains committed to giving shareholders a voice at American companies.\n\nSecond, there is broad agreement about the issues you all discussed this morning. The Byzantine system that \nmakes it impossible to know whether shareholder votes are counted must be fixed. Over the last decade, while our \nvoting technology has made enormous leaps forward, ordinary American investor participation in corporate \nelections has declined.\n\nToday, less than one in three investors has their vote counted in corporate elections. Now we at Commission have \nknown this for years. We issued a deeply thoughtful concept release on the subject in 2010, and it's time to act. \nAmerican investors shouldn't have to wait any longer for their votes to be counted in corporate elections. That's \nwhy I'm delighted that the Chairman has announced roundtables on the subject to be conducted later this year. But \nI'm troubled that rather than focusing on getting the -- the voting system fixed, making sure that every American \ninvestor has a chance to participate in corporate elections, the roundtable in today's announcements emphasize \ncontentious issues regarding the regulation of proxy advisors.\n\n(Inaudible) proxy advisors has long been a top priority for corporate lobbyists who claim that these advisors have \ntoo much power in corporate elections. There is, of course, little proof of that proposition and the empirical work \nthat's been done in the area for the better part of the decade makes clear that the claim is vastly overstated, which \nis why moving too quickly in this direction have little basis in the evidence.\n\nMore generally, it's hard to imagine that upon a survey of all the problems that plague corporate America today, the \nCommission should conclude that investors getting too much advice is one that deserves our immediate attention. \nIn fact, the lack of competition among proxy advisory firms is itself reason for pause. As regulation in the area risks \nfurther deepening the moat around the incumbents that we have, empowering the very firms that somewhere we \nalready have too much influence.\n\nLook, whatever one thinks of these questions might plea to my colleagues and to this committee is to not allow \ncorporate lobbyist priorities to sidetrack our important work in fixing the American system for corporate voting. We \nall know too well that the entrenched interest in this area can delay the repairs to the voting system, which is why \nin the eight years since the staff issued this incredibly thoughtful concept release, the system is virtually \nunchanged.\n\n\n\nAlmost all market participants agree that that system is broken, a fact that experts around the table today saw and \nstart relief when few even large shareholders could tell whether their votes were counted in a crucial corporate \nelection. The only question is whether we, at the Commission, can focus on that problem and solve it without being \nsidetracked by politics.\n\nThat's why I'm so pleased that today the committee has focused its attention strictly on the voting system and how \nwe can and should be fixed in a fashion that'll make sure that every American investor has their vote counted in \ncorporate elections. I hope that the Commission, too, will focus on our obligation to all investors to get that system \nfixed.\n\nThank you all for the important insights you've offered today. I so look forward to your recommendations and to \nhelping give American investors the corporate voting system they deserve. Thanks again to all of you for your time, \nand I look forward to the conversation.\n\nSHEEHAN: Thanks. Thank you, Commissioner Jackson.\n\nSo, continuing on our agenda, the next item is the discussion of the recommendation regarding the Commission's \nproposed transaction fee pilot in NMS stocks.\n\nMatt, your subcommittee had done some work. We all have a draft letter. I think it's been posted for comment. I \nknow we've received a lot of comments from folks on the -- on the recommendation.\n\nIs Paul Mahoney on the phone?\n\nMAHONEY: I am here on the (inaudible). Can you hear me?\n\nSHEEHAN: We can hear you, yes. So, Paul was kind enough to be the -- was the first one who put pen to paper on \nthis recommendation, so he's been kind enough to say he will share a little bit of the background on this and then \nwe can open it up to questions and comments from the Committee members on the recommendation.\n\nGo ahead, Paul.\n\nMAHONEY: Sure. So what we start with the (inaudible) the pack that for a long time exchanges impose a fee on \neach transactions, and that might have been in the range of five mils, meaning five 100 (inaudible) and more \nrecently exchanges have moved to a so-called maker-taker pricing, which I think is best illustrated by a simple \nexample.\n\nLet's imagine that a particular stock at a particular moment in time of national (inaudible) offer $10 bids. $10, of \ncourse, is offered. Customer A comes to Broker A and says, \"I'd like to buy 2,000 shares, but I'm not in a big hurry \nand so I'd like to see if I can do better than $10.04. Why don't we put in a limit order for me to buy $2,000 shares at \n$10.02?\" So the broker takes that order and post it at Exchange A.\n\nI want to make three observations about that. First, Broker A has quite a bit of discretion about which then you \nwould take that order to. Second observation is in my hypothetical, there's no seller at that point that's willing to sell \nat $10.02, so that order does not execute immediately. It's what we call a resting limit order.\n\nFinal observation, if something else happens, that $10.02 now becomes the national bid that improves over the \nprevious $10 bid, so that narrows the spread $0.04 to $0.02. And in that sense it adds liquidity to the market \nbecause the spread is one dimension of liquidity.\n\nNow, let's assume that Customer B comes along and tells its broker -- Broker B, \"I want to sell 1,000 shares \nimmediately with available price,\" so Broker B takes that order to the exchange and execute (inaudible) A that's the \nlimit order. Again, a couple of observations. Broker B has less this fraction with that order because in my \nhypothetical this $10.02 limit order is the best available price, and so the broker, under the order of protection rule \nhas to go towards changing.\n\n\n\nAnd the second observation is that by removing 1,000 shares of demand at $10.02 that market order has reduced \nthe market down and in that sense has taken liquidity some step as another dimension of liquidity.\n\nNow, understanding the maker-taker pricing, Broker B, the one who represented the market order will pay 30 mils of \nwhich 25 would be rebated to Broker A, the Broker B osted the (inaudible) against which that order executed.\n\nHere, another observation, if both customers A and B are retail customers, their votes probably have some \n(inaudible) schedule, say the customer paid $5 a tray. And that means that Broker B is going to pay the 30 mil \naccess fee out of his Commission revenue, and Broker A is going to add the 25 mils to her commission revenue. So \nthat sounds the fee structure is visible to the customer. It's really the broker that -- that pays or receives the fee.\n\nAnd the question (inaudible) of the pilot is how does this pricing structure (inaudible) broker (inaudible). Now, in my \nsimply hypothetical, there's no issue at all because A's limit order is the only order to buy at $10.02. The next best \nbid is $10, so the next market order necessarily goes to Exchange A where that $10.02 bid is posted.\n\nBut in the more typical case, let's imagine that we've got other customers who are coming in with limit orders at the \nsame price. And to further complicate matters let's imagine we've got an exchange with maker-taker pricing that \nalready has a bid $10.02 at another exchange the traditional pricing that is to say just the five mil transaction. Well, \nafter Broker A enters a limit order for Customer A, and now another customer -- we'll call Customer C -- comes \nalong and wants the (inaudible) limit order of $10.02, it would clearly be in that customer's best interest to go to the \ntraditional pricing exchange because if it goes to Exchange A, it ends up being second in line behind the existing \nlimit order (inaudible) different (inaudible) it goes first in line, moreover because that exchange has traditional \npricing but the extra limit order (inaudible) market order, excuse me, is going to go to that exchange in order to \navoid paying the take fee. But that's not what's best for the broker. What's best for the broker is to go to the maker-\ntaker exchange when there's the possibility of capturing the make fee.\n\nSo the question is what if the broker tells the customer, I'm going to take you to the maker-taker exchange, a lot of \nyou bump up your price by a cent and that gets you to the front of the line. That's a direct conflict between the \nbroker's interest and the customer's interest. And the question is did that actually manifest itself and how often did \nthe bank (inaudible) itself? Are we really seeing the others are routing orders to capture the fees rather than based \non what's best for the customer. And that's really what the pilot is all about. It's designed to gather information \nabout (inaudible) based on different pricing structures.\n\nThe market structures (inaudible) believe that it would be extremely useful to get data on -- on -- on that issue and \ntheir -- and -- and that then would help the Commission decide whether it should regulate access fees in a different \nway from its current regulation, which simply caps the access fee and doesn't say anything about rebates.\n\nSHEEHAN: So, let's -- why don't we open it up for discussion? I think most of you, J.W., have seen and have \ncommented on the recommendation to see, but I think the idea is to sort of put it into a little bit of context as to \nwhere this came from and why we feel that this would be a good thing for the committee to make a \nrecommendation on.\n\nSo, J.W.?\n\nVERRET: Yeah. I -- I support the letter and -- and -- and appreciate Paul's work in drafting the letter and was \ngenerally supportive of the various tweaks suggested along the way, so happy to go along with the will of the group \non that. And for my part, commend the Commission for its deliberative approach here. And I offered a separate \ncomment letter to the rulemaking regarding assertions made by a couple of large exchanges who have implicitly \nthreatened to sue the Commission if it goes forward with the pilot. And I have offered my own perspective on \nbusiness roundtable versus SEC and the Chamber versus SEC and how those arguments would play out. I \nanticipate they would lose.\n\nI just want to note that part of the reason why they would lose under the ruling of Chamber versus SEC is that one \nof things courts look into when they review rulemaking is deliberative process. And the fact that we got a \n\n\n\nrecommendation from the MSAC, the fact that we've got a -- a open comment period on a -- what will be a pilot and \nthat will involve subsequent possibly rulemaking relative -- related to the pilot. And effective now if we got up \nrecommendation from the IAC, there'll be a long list of things. They want precedent cases like the Chamber versus \nSEC. So in any event, today's suggested letter is -- would be relevant to a subsequent litigation if we go there. So I \nwant to note that, and it's another important benefit of what we're doing today.\n\nSHEEHAN: Perfect, terrific. Lydia?\n\nMASHBURN: I also want to thank Paul for his work in drafting this and all the other members of the Market \nStructure Subcommittee. I have to admit I actually (inaudible) there are areas of the letter that I would not \nnecessarily be able to support. I think the goals of the pilot are really laudable, trying to do rulemakings with data \nand information.\n\nI'm not sure that the pilot is the best way of going about collecting that data. That data technically already exists. It's \njust hard to get to. I am not sure that putting 3,000 companies into a test experiment is the best way of trying to \nfigure out if the rebates are really affecting order routing. And I also think you're going to end up with a set of data \nthat is not complete because you are not capturing a full set of areas where workers are routing their orders. And, of \ncourse, you're referring to alternative trading systems or other dark pools.\n\nSo I -- I -- I laud the goals of the Commission trying to put forward this pilot and the idea of trying to have databased \nrules and regulations. I think that we should always look at where our sources of data that already exists before we \nstart basically playing around with a bunch of companies that have, you know, whole payrolls to fill in people's \nactual livelihood is kind of on the line in the long run. So I feel like we should just be very cautious before we make \nan experiment of 3,000 companies.\n\nI also think that there -- there are challenges that the rebate problem is a -- it's a symptom of a larger problem \nrelated to Regulation NMS. And I think that going in the direction of trying to solve this one tiny tree problem when \nwe have a forest problem and subjecting so many people to -- so many firms to what really does look like an \nexperiment for -- for reasons that you're not even going to get full data from is just, in my -- my view, not the best \nway of going about it.\n\nBut again, I agree with the goals of data-driven regulation. I agree with the -- that there is a problem with the way \nsome of the rebate structure is affecting markets and might even be affecting order routing and all of the other \nissues that Paul referred to. I just don't know if this is the best way of going about finding out exactly what the \nproblem is and giving us the most accurate information to make the best rules and regulations off of so it's where I \nwould stand on that.\n\nSHEEHAN: (Inaudible)?\n\nSILVERS: I wonder -- would you -- would you be able to explain a little bit more your comment about the -- that \nthere's something more systematic wrong with NMS?\n\nMASHBURN: The -- my understanding of it, which I will admit that my -- my field of expertise is not securities \nmarkets. My field of expertise is monetary policy, but I like to look at systems as a whole. And we'll -- in my field of \nwork we're always looking at where are the root problems.\n\nIn my admittedly limited understanding of the situation, Reg NMS has put on a number of restrictions related to \norder routing and best execution and forgetting what is it four, five different ones. And in combination, looking at the \nway they interact with one another, it has created some perverse incentives in the way in which orders are \nexecuted. And so I think that we should be looking holistically at the marketplace and trying -- and I know the \nCommission is doing work on broader issues related to Reg NMS.\n\nSo, to me, it's -- you should be looking at how these things are interacting, what are the incentives that are being \ncreated and sowed in my mind. It's that loose combination of rules and restrictions from Reg NMS that cause this -- \n\n\n\npart of it is the best execution, issue pushes orders into certain marketplaces, which then means that they could \ncharge astronomical fees so then we put a cap on the fees so that they can exploit the fact that that's the order of \nbest execution. And then we -- in order to make up for some of those costs, then the exchanges are competing by \ntrying to rebate to brokers and incentivize them to use their exchange.\n\nAnd so you've created this whole domino effect of problems and challenges. And we're looking -- I think with this \npilot, we're looking at one little tiny bush, and in reality it's the whole -- the whole force we need to be looking at \nbecause they're all interacting with one another. So that's what I mean. And I apologize that that's not ...\n\nSILVERS: No.\n\nMASHBURN: ... as expert as it should be, but ...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n... that's my limited understanding at the moment.\n\nSILVERS: I was -- I was going to say I suspect if you went around this table, you -- you'll be right in the top 10 \npercent of understanding.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nI would just -- I just observed something. I have said on this -- on this Committee many times that I think that an \naftermath of Reg NMS that this fundamental problem is in terms of the fairness -- in terms of the fairness of the way \nthat trading markets are structured and who has access to preferential execution and -- and -- and that -- that really \n-- that really undercuts sort of the fundamental Commission missions.\n\nI looked at this proposal and it seemed to me like, hey, it's a start, right, at trying to unpack some of that stuff. I \nwould be supportive of a more comprehensive approach. I'm not really supportive of doing nothing. And -- and I \nwould look to -- again, you know, to other people who understand better what -- you know, what would be involved \nin a more comprehensive approach.\n\nBut I feel like, in this area, there's been so little action in response to such egregious problems that I'm really \nreluctant to -- that -- that as a body, we -- we not endorse even partial solutions if they are -- you know, if they -- \nthey get -- if we get past the do no harm kind of -- kind of -- kind of principle, right?\n\nMASHBURN: (Inaudible).\n\nSILVERS: Right.\n\nSHEEHAN: Yeah. And the one thing and I know we've got a couple other questions in response, I -- and I think \nwhen you brought the issue up on one of the calls and we added some language about asking the Commission, \nyou know, that Reg MNS -- NMS was adopted more than a decade ago and it'd be useful for them to look at sort of \nthe bigger issue because I think when that discussion was brought up on the telephone, everybody agreed. You \nknow, as Damon said, it's time to take a look at this.\n\nSo we did add the language, I think, in response to your issue that we don't want to take it out of context kind of \nbuilding on, you know, some of the other comments, I -- there's people who've known me, I have an adage, perfect \nis the enemy of good. You know, it isn't ideal, but we're moving the ball forward. This will give them good data. You \nknow, I know people have views about pilot projects, but, you know, we're responding to what they had done and \nwe'd like to encourage them to move forward on this. And as we have also done, encourage them to move forward \non the review of NMS.\n\nSo, I have got John, Jennifer, Mina and then I don't know if J.W. has another. Okay. So, John Coates?\n\n\n\nCOATES: Yeah, real quick. So, since this was distributed, I was asked why am I against the order of protection rule. \nAnd I said, what are you talking about? And apparently this is being read as an attack on the order of protection \nrule, which is an interesting feature of our fishbowl life.\n\nSo I -- so I -- I want to both embrace, Lydia, your suggestion and -- which is, I think, was intended to be reflected in \nthis paragraph and -- and also maybe address the -- the reading of this as -- as critical of the order of protection rule \nby making a friendly amendment suggestion to the language, which would just be to say more simply it would be \nuseful to conduct a broader study of the effects of Regulation NMS as -- you know, as well as pursue the pilot. And \nthat then takes out the bit about unanticipated not in the best interest and linking it to the order of protection rule. So \nI'm happy to reread that, so delete everything in the -- in the second sentence -- in the third sentence and replace it \nwith, \"It would be useful to conduct a broader study of the effects of Regulation NMS in addition to the pilot.\"\n\nAnd I think it conveys the same intended semantic meeting and remove some of the suggested prejudgment \nbecause although Damon may be right that -- and -- and Lydia may be right that there are perverse things going on. \nI -- I haven't engaged that yet, and so I would rather have it be more neutral if we could do that.\n\nDo you mind? (Inaudible) is the official author of this, yeah.\n\nSHEEHAN: I think that's Mr. Furman's subcommittee.\n\nCOATES: Okay.\n\nFURMAN: Yeah.\n\nCOATES: (Inaudible), Matt.\n\nFURMAN: It sounds reasonable. I ...\n\nCOATES: Great.\n\nFURMAN: ... Paul with the pen has the final call on that.\n\nCOATES: Okay. So, Paul, you're on.\n\nMAHONEY: Yeah, that's fine.\n\nCOATES: Right.\n\nMAHONEY: Yes, I mean, the -- and then certainly the (inaudible) prejudge the issue.\n\nCOATES: Right. Great. So I think -- yeah.\n\nFURMAN: Yeah.\n\nCOATES: And if you didn't get those exact words I'll give them to you after. Great.\n\nSHEEHAN: Okay. Jennifer, Mina and then J.W.\n\nMARIETTA-WESTBERG I just want to say that there has been some recent discussion in the public press about \nthe potential cost that could be significant of pilots in general. So I would be in favor of the most parsimonious \nmodel, most parsimonious methodology that the Commission can put forward on this pilot that would still allow the \nresults to be broadly applicable and allow them the statistical confidence that they need.\n\nSHEEHAN: Mina?\n\nNGUYEN: I know you want to move on, so I just wanted to make a -- the same comment. There is, I think, kind of \nburdensome responsibility on these pilot tests. I think it does wear on the companies and whether or not both the \n\n\n\nCFTC, SEC and others are looking holistically at some of these fundamental challenges in market structure and \nwhether or not there's a way to prioritize what data we're looking for and how many pilots they like to run to test the \necosystem would be a little (inaudible), and people could then understand and prepare for it rather than, you know, \nannouncing these pilot haphazardly, it feels.\n\nSHEEHAN: And then J.W., did you have -- John, do you -- Okay.\n\nCOATES: I'm good, thank you.\n\nVERRET: Yeah, just to -- just to share a little bit of my sort of evolution in thinking in market structure why I support \nthe pilot because, I guess, I probably say no more often than I say yes and -- and probably will in these meetings, \nbut I -- I view this -- this area as having a great deal of analogy to -- to government-sponsored enterprises in the \nhousing sector and to credit rating agencies in their own sector. And by that I mean, there is a great deal of \nconcentration, and that concentration is not a result of natural market forces, it's a result of government intervention \nand government regulation, and certainly going back all the way to certainly you can (inaudible) parts of the '75 Act \namendments in -- insofar as they made choices about where property rights and trading information rested that \nwere not a result of natural market forces, but sort of just the fiat of the statute saying the -- the property right rests \nhere with exchange and Reg NMS and -- to the consequence as post NMS.\n\nAnd so I -- you know, I -- I think I view the -- the pilot as addressing issues of market concentration created by the \nlarge exchanges in their relationship with the Commission and -- and barriers to entry and other regulatory just -- \njust -- just the fact that this -- their business models are so enmeshed in -- in regulation.\n\nI think that the -- the claims of a few issuers about effect on spreads are just not -- I -- I don't find them particularly \ncompelling because in part first, you know, the -- the -- we didn't hear issuers complaining particularly this group of \nissuers complaining about tick-sized pilot, which directly change spreads. And so their Johnny-come-lately \nconcerns about spreads, I think, are a result of communications we've have seen from the large exchanges to a few \nissuers using their market power to encourage issuers to do a couple of last-minute letters into the pilot.\n\nI just don't find those arguments particularly convincing. And I would also say that those pilot, I don't know where \nthis is going to go and whether I'm going to agree with the Commission. And I don't know there's a whole range of \ndifferent possibilities where this could be a post pilot. And I know one that a lot of people discussed this pairing the \nidea of a -- of a -- of regulation rebates with changes or complete rescission of the order of protection rule, pairing \nthose things together as a way to find a good policy and find bipartisan consensus on the Commission.\n\nWill it work? I don't know. I'm not even I agree with them or not, but just to suggest there's a whole range of \noutcomes that could happen post pilot. So, supporting the pilot doesn't -- I hope it doesn't mean being wedded to \nwhat comes after it. So this is a very small modest step and I support it in that respect.\n\nAnd the other thing, too, I would put in a plug next Wednesday 10 a.m., Commissioner Jackson is going to come \nand give speech at Scalia Law School. And then after there's going to be a debate between me and Ty Gellasch \nfrom Healthy Markets. You all should all come because this is part two of the discussion we have today. So come \nto Scalia Wednesday 10 o'clock or tune in. Listen to Commissioner Jackson who's never shy or Ty or I either in \ndiscussing all of these issues. So thank you for putting up with me.\n\nSHEEHAN: Well, if -- if that's going to be webcast or whatever ...\n\nMAHONEY: Anne?\n\nVERRET: Yes?\n\nSHEEHAN: ... that would be great.\n\nMAHONEY: Anne, could I -- could -- could I make one (inaudible)?\n\n\n\nSHEEHAN: Absolutely. Go ahead, Paul.\n\nMAHONEY: So, I -- I just want to -- to make a quick point that we have data at the moment about how orders are \nbeing routed on that system in which we cap the access fee. But that's it, we cap the access fee. And what the pilot \nwould (inaudible) is what happens if we say rather than they're being just a cap, no rebates. And, you know, I think \nthat's are actually an important new piece of information that we would learn.\n\nSHEEHAN: Yeah, good point. So, Matt Furman and then we're going to entertain a motion because we knew -- oh, \nDamon has a -- Okay, so Matt and Damon.\n\nFURMAN: To, Paul, if you can maybe just briefly explain why if you're an issuer you -- in your view you shouldn't be \nvery concerned about being in one of the -- the test groups versus the control group because I -- I do know this is \nsomething that, you know, was raised you thought about before you -- you put in the letter. And I know it's been -- \nbeen raised more generally.\n\nMAHONEY: Sure. The -- the argument that some (inaudible) have made is that if you're in a group -- if you're in \none of the buckets with a lower fee cap, then your stock may be less liquid because what's going to happen is they \n-- marketmakers are going to be less interested in quoting that stock because they don't pick up the -- the make \nfee.\n\nBut I think that (inaudible) is that (inaudible) provided at some price, and whether you -- and the way you split that \nprice between the nominal spread and access fee or rebate is not as important as the net number. And that net \nnumber is going to be set by the market. So I don't really agree with the view that somehow there is going to be a -- \na dramatic change in -- in realized liquidity for companies that are in one bucket versus another.\n\nSILVERS: So under -- what's flying underneath? Let me explain what I mean. My concern about Reg NMS is that \nReg NMS offered a particular solution to the question of -- of sort of preferential treatment in the securities markets, \nwhich is the order of flow rules.\n\nI'm not at all -- I have -- do not have the expertise of some of -- of -- of our colleagues here on this, but I'm not at all \nconvinced by what I've seen over the last 10 years that this has been at all an effective way of achieving that goal. \nThat goal of -- of -- of fair and equitable treatment of -- of securities markets participants who do not have billions of \ndollars to play with is the core -- is the core reason why this Commission exists. It's why the Securities Act of '33 \nwas written and -- and the '34 Act, which is absolutely more relevant to this. Why -- why these acts are written and \nwhy this agency exists?\n\nIn that respect, if the -- the existence of this agency is premised on the notion that there's no such thing as a \nnatural market order, that the existence of -- of corporations, the publicly-traded corporations of securities markets, \nall these things are the product of the interaction of economics and -- and policymaking. And the question is not \nwhether or not we're seeking natural orders here, but whether or not we are effectively ensuring that suit -- that -- \nthat our markets are fair and equitable to all participants and particularly towards smaller investors, which is after all \nwhat the pre- what it was -- what it was demonstrably true, the pre SEC securities markets were not.\n\nWith that in mind, I come around to -- to -- to believing that as long -- that with John's additions, this proposal is -- \nyou know, is a good effort to try -- to try to get at these goals. You know, J.W. and I may not agree about -- on -- on \nsort of legal philosophy, but I think we're both open to the notion that we ought to do something here because what \nwe have in place is not really working in -- in -- in the -- in the manner that sort of fair-minded investor advocates \nwould like it to work.\n\nAnd so -- so that -- so that leaves, that -- that -- I wanted to explain sort of where I come from here. I definitely am \nnot in favor of the notion that we ought to let these markets that the Commission ought to withdraw from trying to \nprotect small investors in these markets. I think that would be a terrible idea. And -- and -- and so anyone who \nwants to read, you know, my -- you know, sort of -- sort of somewhat hedge support for this proposal as an attack \non -- on the order rules, understand that's not -- that's not my intention, but my intent. But -- but it's clear that what \n\n\n\nwe've got right now in total is not -- is not producing, in my view, the -- the -- the type of fair and equitable market it \nwas intended to produce.\n\nAnd that's a big problem, and this is a small step in trying to do -- in trying to, you know, address an aspect of it. \nThat seems to me like, you know, what we ought to be supporting.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYes, I guess, suppose it is.\n\nSHEEHAN: Right. All right. So I don't want to cut off, but I think everybody who wanted to give 30 seconds.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Just that we have a lot of data, but we don't have much data about the really important question that \nthe impact of rebates on best execution and FINRA D.C. I heard them say it best trying to -- right now trying to \nenforce best execution like trying to nail -- nail Jell-O to a wall, so this solidifies it turns at least into pudding \nperhaps, but that's the key (inaudible).\n\nSHEEHAN: Okay. So without any further ado, then I will call the question. We have a motion and second to \napprove the recommendation from the Subcommittee with the John Coates amendment, which we will circulate \naround the wording to him.\n\nSo, all those in favor say aye.\n\nGROUP: Aye.\n\nSHEEHAN: Any opposed?\n\n(UNKNOWN): Aye.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Aye.\n\nSHEEHAN: Any abstentions?\n\n(UNKNOWN): I'm going to abstain from this one.\n\nSHEEHAN: Okay. Yeah, the phone votes were -- was it Barbara and Elisse? Is that correct?\n\n(UNKNOWN): And Paul.\n\nSHEEHAN: And Paul.\n\nMAHONEY: Assuming an aye also.\n\n(UNKNOWN): And Stephen.\n\nMAHONEY: And Stephen is (inaudible) though.\n\nSHEEHAN: Oh, Stephen, Okay. All right, very good. So for the minutes, we're going to have that reflected. Great. \nWell, thank you all. Thanks for the discussion.\n\nMatt, thank to you Subcommittee.\n\nAnd, Paul, especially thank you for all the hard work on this because I know we sort of grouped you into action very \nquickly on this. So, very nice job and we look forward to -- we look forwared to seeing what happens with the pilot \nproject and hopefully move forward quickly.\n\nOkay. The afternoon session is going to be facilitated by my colleague, John Coates.\n\n\n\nCOATES: Great.\n\nSHEEHAN: So, John, why don't I turn it over to you to introduce our guests? I apologize for being a little delayed on \nthat. Certainly, you can give us reviews on Reg NMS if you want to add it to -- your thoughts on passive investing.\n\nCOATES: Right. Thank you. And I am mindful of time and so I'm going to keep my introductory remarks to \nessentially introduction other than to say that I'm delighted that our panelists have been willing to participate \nbecause I do think the increase of passive investing overall is one of two or three of the most important overall \ntrends affecting the context in which the SEC has to function and in which the rules that it passes and implements \nare -- are being affected enormously and lots of ways that we don't know yet. And so this is very much viewed as \nan early-stage informational panel and not one that's geared at any particular policy outcome.\n\nI've been thinking about it long enough to know that I really don't have any great ideas. Otherwise, I have already \npresented them. So, I'm hoping to learn from you guys.\n\nSo, to that -- to that end, let me -- we're going to start with Jeb Doggett who's a managing director at Casey Quirk, \nwhich is -- is it of Deloitte, by Deloitte, with Deloitte? By Deloitte, what does that mean?\n\nDOGGETT: (Inaudible).\n\nCOATES: Okay, you're independent, got it. Okay. Thank you. Take this away. There's a little light over there that \nwill warn you when you're getting near the end of your time. Here we go.\n\nDOGGETT: Okay. So thank you for having us here. I think that passive investing is probably one of the most \nsignificant trends going on in asset management today. It's disrupting the -- the overall asset management \nbusiness and changing the way millions invest.\n\nAnd while it has grown very dramatically, we believe the significant growth is likely to continue for a number of \nreasons, which I'll talk about. So I wanted to kind of set the stage for the panel that -- and -- and provide some \nperspective on the size of passive investing, the source of growth, market demand, and then provide a forecast of \nwhere we see the market, you know, out five years.\n\nSo today, when we look at the global passively managed assets, they have grown to about $15.6 trillion, and that's \n-- that's -- they've grown at a compounded annual growth rate of about 20 percent. And they have grown at about \ntwo and a half times the growth rate of what I'll call traditional active investments. So, passive today now \nrepresents 23 percent of the globally professionally managed assets up from about 15 percent five years ago, so \ntremendous growth.\n\nWhen we look at sort of net new money coming into the -- the market, which we would call organic growth -- growth \nor net new flow, over the last three years, 50 percent of the -- of that organic growth has gone into passive \nstrategies. So, it's really the dominant sort of choice in the -- in the business -- in the business today.\n\nIf we just focus on the U.S. for a moment, the world's largest market passive strategies have grown to $11 trillion \nand represent 31 percent of the professionally managed assets. This is significantly above other global market, so \nthe number in Europe is about 19 percent. In Asia ex-Japan, it's only about five percent. Japan is a special case \nwhere passive investing is really dominated by the GPIF and the Bank of Japan. And over 50 percent of the assets \nin that market are -- are managed passively.\n\nSo, what are the sources of this growth? You know, it starts out by looking at what's been going on with institutional \ninvestors in the pension market. So they started investing passively, you know, 20 years ago and grew their \nallocations in passive investing to about 25 percent. And -- and that number, that level of passive investing \nessentially plateaued there.\n\nThen we have the defined contribution system, which is dominated by the system in the U.S. And what we saw \nthere was -- what we see there is more and more because of the simplicity, and the low fees, and the desire by plan \n\n\n\nsponsors to have a kind of a low-risk solution sort of not taking manager's election risk, the adoption of, you know, \nproviding passive options came to dominate the landscape. And then when we had the -- the target date funds \ncoming in as the default option, on many of them are driven purely by passive underlying investments. And those \nthat aren't, it's interesting a number of leading firms are now -- are now offering hybrids where they have some \npassive and some active products within their -- their target date funds. So that continues to be a major source of \nnew money going into passive investing.\n\nThe next big development was the creation and launch of ETFs. And today, ETFs have become a $5 trillion \nmarket, and they now represent the majority of passive assets in the U.S. And when we look at the organic growth \nrate and net flows over the last three years, two-thirds of the money has gone into the ETF vehicle. So a major -- a \nmajor innovation in a major disruptor.\n\nSome of the reasons for the broad adoption have been kind of the tax benefits of ETFs, as well as access to new \nasset classes, like gold or real estate where individual investors really couldn't get access to those kind of betas or \nmarket exposures in the past. So, I left off the biggest segment of passive investors, which is individuals -- \nindividual asset on behalf of individuals. They have invested over $7 trillion in asset passive strategies representing \n30 -- 38 percent of their overall portfolio.\n\nWhat are the reasons for that? Well, I think there are three. First of all is performance. Over the last one, three, five \nyears you can -- you can pick. Active strategies has -- have a -- have a -- as a group, have generally outperformed \npassive. And you can -- you can look at, you know, multiple time frames, different asset classes, but the vast \nmajority of active managers have underperformed.\n\nThe second big theme is fees. Fees have risen an importance to the gatekeeper, so the big intermediaries of \nfinancial advisors, even the institutional gatekeepers are putting more emphasis in their screening and selection \nprocess on the area of fees. And so while we're seeing fees in general across the industry declining, they're \ndeclining fastest in the passive sector across passive strategies as -- as their providers really take advantage of \nscale, and -- and continue to lower the fees.\n\nAnd then the third driver is what I would call solutions where investors have really -- after the financial crisis have \nrefocused on thinking about their portfolios in the context of the objectives they're trying to achieve as opposed to \nsimply filling a stylebox and trying to beat a -- a specific benchmark. And in that context, more investment advisors \nare taking on the role of truly advising their clients in building, you know, holistic portfolios and their value-added is \nshifting to be more aligned with the asset allocation.\n\nAnd as result, they are using less expensive, in some cases, you know, generic exposures as building blocks, i.e., \npassive -- passive building blocks, whether that's a fund or an ETF. So, for those reasons, you know, we've seen \nmassive growth of passive within the indictment marketplace.\n\nLooking forward, you know, where do we see continued demand? Well, the first is the intermediaries that I spoke \nabout, you know, there's a whole generation of financial advisors that, as a business practice, use ETFs as the \nprimary vehicle and -- you know, and they're not going away. Secondly, when we look, as I mentioned outside the \nU.S., individual investors still have a significantly lower level of passive exposure, and so we believe over time in \npart due to regulation like RDR and MIFID II in -- in the U.K. and Europe, they will begin to use more passive \ninvesting. We continue to see the upward trend in allocation to passive among defined contribution plans. And then \nfinally, we see a lot of innovation in the passive arena like alternative-weighted indices and fundamental indexing.\n\nSo, just one last point, which is when we look out across the horizon over the next, you know, five years, we think \nthat the -- the share of passive investing will grow from 30 percent today to 35 percent of the professionally \nmanaged assets. And that would be a -- a passive market greater than $25 trillion.\n\nCOATES: Right. Thank you very much for that overview. Next, we have Rodney Comegys. Am I getting that close? \nRodney ...\n\n\n\nCOMEGYS: Comegys.\n\nCOATES: Comegys, thank you, who has been the -- a Principal and Head of Risk Management at Vanguard but \nwas just recently appointed Head of Equity Index Investing, so the perfect person to comment from industry's \nperspective.\n\nCOMEGYS: Thank you to Chairwoman Sheehan. Thank you to Professor Coates for chairing the panel and to the \nwhole Investor Advisory Committee for taking the time to listen to all of our remarks about such an important topic.\n\nThe title of today's presentation or discussion is the Implications of Passive Investing. Plain and simply, the \nbiggest implication of passive investing has been the benefits to the retail investor. The mom-and-pop investor \nbuys total market fund for his or her retirement, the 401(k) participant using an index-based target fund or the \nfinancial advisor who builds a balanced portfolio of broad-based market ETFs. Indexing over the last 40 years has \nbrought extraordinary benefits to the everyday investor to include diversifying portfolios, globalizing portfolios, \nenabling parents to save their children's education, coming the go-to vehicle for 401(k) plans, and overall \ndemocratizing professional investing.\n\nIt's also saved a lot of money. Our estimate is since the early 90s, $186 billion in fees have been saved or the \nchoice of index investing over a higher cost active alternative. It's the $142 million since the global financial crisis.\n\nIt's always worth a minute when we talk in a panel like this to remind ourselves why this ocurs. It's simply the zero-\nsum game. All investors together give the the market return -- asset-weighted market return. It means half of \ninvestors are going to do better and half are going to do worse.\n\nOnce you account for fees, active investing -- excuse me, passive investing outperforms roughly 80 percent of \nactive investing. You see that in many number of studies. The most recent, which I read was the SPIVA study by \nS&P, but it's well-covered in the academic literature and by market participants. It doesn't however mean that active \ncan outperform. It's just a challenging and difficult thing to do.\n\n(Inaudible) this is magical. They're getting an above-average return for lower risk and without the chances of \nselecting the wrong active manager. Furthermore, we believe that passive investing has also pushed the price of \nactive management down. It's been competitive in that regard. It gets also -- and you're going to hear it today. You \ncan certainly read it in the press and -- and other places. There's some things index investing or passive investing \nhasn't done.\n\nIt is by no stretch creating a market bubble or a momentum strategy. Index funds don't determine the price of \nsecurities. In fact, with a slightly different statistic than Jeb, I'll just remind you that index investors in the U.S. only \nmake up as an ownership about 15 percent of market capitalization, and globally only 10 percent. But the key \nstatistic to us is it's only five percent of the trading volume. That means 95 percent of the participants are, in some \nways, actively setting a price.\n\nWho are those folks? They're active managers, they're hedge funds, they're activist investors, company stock \nprograms or high-frequency investors, retail participants. There's a plenty of price discovery in the market. The \nindex fund is not the price maker, it is the price taker.\n\nSecond thing we would say that index investing is not going to cause nor has caused this market volatility. Market \nvolatility is largely in a broad-based driven by geopolitical events, by monetary policy, by economic conditions. It's \nnot driven by the choice of investors. In fact, I'll just point out, in 1929, we had a market correction nearly 50 years \nbefore the index fund was even invested. We'll have market volatility in the future. We've had in the past, it's not \ncaused by index funds or passive investors.\n\nThere are some things we do worry about in the passive space. There's certain products that are probably \ninappropriate for retail investors, leverage product, inverse product. They may perform properly, but there's just not \nproper for a retail or an everyday investor.\n\n\n\nFinally, and this was referred to by Jeb a minute ago, there are some products that are active in nature, but are \npassively constructed. A simple example is that what's referred to as a smart beta product. It's either smart or beta. \nIt's an active position. It will perform differently than the market and therefore, by definition, it's neither smart and \nalways going to win or beta and represent the market. I think those are couple things to think about as we think \nabout the marketplace.\n\nFinally, in conclusion, we just thank the Committee for taking the time to listen and discuss the implications of \npassive investing. As you go forward, I would suggest keep in mind the enormous benefits that passive investing \nhas had to retail investors and be skeptical of what you might hear as some of the causes of this trend.\n\nCOATES: Great. Thank you. And as a Vanguard investor, I thank you. I -- such a small amount, I have no conflict \nhere, but anyway.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nNext, we have Robert Sharps, Chief Investment Officer for T. Rowe Price for a different perspective, I suspect.\n\nSHARPS: Good afternoon. And I'd also like to thank the IAC for focusing on these issues. I think they are very \ntimely. I would agree that the rise of passing -- passive and I would say broadly, rules-based investing, so not only \npassive but factor-based investing, quantitative investing, momentum investing has been one of the most important \ntrends that we've seen the course of the last decade.\n\nObviously, while functioning markets are essential to efficient capital allocation and beneficial both to issuers and to \ninvestors so, you know, I think it's great that you're having a -- you're having this -- this discussion. My role on the \npanel today is to bring the perspective of an active investment manager. T. Rowe Price manages over $1 trillion in \n-- in assets on behalf of its clients, and over 95 percent of that is actively managed.\n\nI have basically been asked to speak to whether T. Rowe Price has observed any market developments that might \nbe attributed to the proliferation of passive investment strategies or other rules-based investment strategies. And \nthe short answer to that question is yes. It's always difficult to prove causality. And I think you can generally find \nstudies to support either side of this debate. I think you're kind of many of the numbers with regard to the percent of \ntrade volume or the percent of AUM market capital float are, you know, kind of really determined on how you \napproach it. And there is a numerator and denominator impact that, you know, can lead you to very different \nconclusions depending on what approach you take. This issue is most acute in U.S. equity, although it is a trend \nthat's becoming increasingly prominent across asset classes.\n\nLook, I think common sense would -- would suggest that any shift of this magnitude is bound to ultimately have \nconsequences. I'd characterize the observable impacts today as either temporal or minor, but you heard the -- the \nmagnitude and persistence of the trend. And, ultimately, I think if those trends persist, the impact is likely to become \nmore prominent.\n\nIt honestly is our sense or my sense that we will get a clearer picture of the impact of the shift to passive investment \nstrategies and indexation during the next bear market. There are alpha cycles. I think we've been in a particularly \ndifficult market environment for active investment -- active investing relative to passive. Not to make excuses, but \nthere have been periods of time where the statistics have been much more favorable to active.\n\nSo, specifically, what are those observations? And I'll group them into market structure and price discovery as well \nas corporate governance, which I think was meant to -- to be included in the scope of this.\n\nFrom the perspective of market structure and price discovery, I'd say that -- that our -- our investment professionals, \nour portfolio managers and analysts note several concerns that are likely attributable at least in part to the trend \ntowards indexation and other rules-based investment strategies. The first is that we do see evidence that strategies \ndelivered in exchange-traded products can increase the correlation among constituent securities and periodically \ndistort the price of those securities. And this is going to get a little technical, so bear with me for a second.\n\n\n\nBut we basically observed this distortion is particularly acute and trading volumes are elevated in exchange-traded \nproducts, particularly downside trading volumes and oftentimes when there's a shift in market sentiment. We \nobserve these conditions in downside volume in the high-yield bond market in early 2016, and again in upside \nvolume in the small cap stock Russell 2000 market post the presidential election in late 2016. In each of those \ninstances, our portfolio managers noted measurable distortion in the performance of underlying constituent \nsecurities.\n\nI think the clearest example that I can share with people occurred about three years ago. In the fall of 2015, there \nwas substantial -- substantially elevated downside volume in the shares of the healthcare spider -- healthcare \nselect spider front, so actually you got a health care sector ETF. Basically, it look like the downside volume was \nbeing driven by intensifying political debate around pharmaceutical pricing. And in the aftermath of this we did a \nstudy and basically looked at the performance of the underlying securities.\n\nWhat we found is heightened constituent correlation that all of the securities underlying the health care spider were \ndepressed as you would -- as you would imagine, but there were several securities that had very limited exposure \nto human drug pricing. There are a lot of names that had, you know, kind of what statistically could be shown as \nvery limited historical beta to this ETF.\n\nDespite that fact, these stocks went down during a brief period of time much more than their historical betas would \nsuggest and, ultimately, they recovered a third bit of that, which, you know, again suggested to us that the \nproverbial baby was thrown out with the bathwater. These conditions present themselves relatively frequently. We \nobserve them happening dozens of times of year over the course of the last 10 years, which was the scope of our \nstudy. Although in some instances, they're broader and more intense than others.\n\nA few other comments with regard to market structure. I would say we're seeing a continued concentration of \ntrading volume late in the day. Passive strategies generally seek to transact at or near a securities closing price in \nan effort to replicate the performance of an index. And I would just say it's worth taking a step back and in saying \nthat active management basically drives price discovery and also provides liquidity. Trading volume simply seeks to \nmatch the closing price, leaves less volume engaged in the price discovery process necessary to actually set that \nprice as opposed to just trying to replicate it.\n\nIf -- as active managers, we choose to engage with that volume. We are basically forced to trade later in the day. \nAnd what we find is that concentrating volume late in the day limits intraday liquidity. It's well-documented. The \nspreads tend to be wider during the middle part of the day, and intraday volatility can be heightened as a result.\n\nOne emerging concern we have is that increased volume on a close, coupled with higher fees from the exchanges \nto -- to trade on the close to their market on closed facilities is leading to the rise of so-called broker sponsored \nmarket on closed facilities. These are now competing for end of the day volume. This is an emerging trend, so I \nwouldn't say that it's having an emerging current impact, but I do believe that it bears monitoring as it's diverting \nvolume from the exchanges and ultimately risk fragmenting the market.\n\nLast, what I'll make on price discovery is that in certain cases it's become more challenging for active managers to \naccumulate or liquidate positions in small and mid-cap stocks due to passive strategies holding 20 percent or more \nof the float of many, many small and mid-cap names. The vote turnover of passive strategy naturally limits the \namount of volume that we can engage with if we're trying to build or trying to exit a opposition.\n\nI see I'm running short on time based on the yellow light here. A few words on -- on -- on governance. I'd say our \napproach to governance as an active manager is unique in the sense that we have a -- a -- a governance \ncommittee, a proxy committee that focuses on the top-down issues, but our votes are also informed by our bottom-\nup fundamental perspective and intimate knowledge of each of the investments that we're making.\n\nI'd I say we recognize, as a firm, the many of the passive investment managers have invested heavily in their ability \nto assess and evaluate governance issues and we'd say that broadly we believe that they vote their proxies \nresponsibly. We actually think that the -- the -- the top-down approach that many of the passive sponsors take and \n\n\n\nthe bottom-up approach that we take tend to -- to -- to work quite nicely. That said, I would say as passive continues \nto become a greater share of the market, it can be quite frustrating when you do have some of the major passive \nsponsors being swing votes in contested situations.\n\nStatistically, Vanguard tends to vote much more frequently with management than -- than many of the active firms \nand even some of their peers. And oftentimes in contested instances, they do -- they do end up determining the \noutcome, which can be somewhat frustrating.\n\nSo I would say, in conclusion, look, I think the -- the role active management plays in price discovery, governance \nand capital formation is absolutely essential. We believe markets function best with diverse perspectives and \napproaches and that active and passive can coexist in reasonable balance. We do believe there are periodic \ndislocations that eventually are bound to get worse particularly in extreme market environments to the extent that \nthe -- that this persists. And we would caution the IAC with respect to policy recommendations that include a default \nto passive investment strategies and resist any type of regulatory policy recommendation that promotes one \nstrategy, either active or passive over the other.\n\nSo, I see I'm out of time and thank you.\n\nCOATES: Great. Thank you very much. Stephen, do we have Professor Kahan available? How do we make that?\n\nKAHAN: Yeah, can you hear me?\n\nCOATES: We can hear Marcel. Are we going to have visual or just a -- just phone? But, Marcel, why don't you go \nahead while we figure out how to get your -- your picture up? In any event, next is Professor Marcel Kahan who \nwas among the first people to encourage me to teach. So, thank you, Marcel, for that. And he's currently the \nGeorge Lowry Professor of Law at NYU and a colleague of Ed Rock who we saw earlier today.\n\nKAHAN: Thank you all for having us here. In my remarks today I want to address the implications of passive \ninvesting (inaudible), the (inaudible) of capital markets (inaudible). But before I (inaudible) I want to (inaudible) asset \ninvestment into context.\n\nFor (inaudible) we have seen a very substantial decline in retail holdings of shares and most of the institutional \nholding. Within the institutional sector, (inaudible) passive investing comparatively smaller and more (inaudible). \n(Inaudible) further management by hedge funds.\n\nIn considering the implication of passive investing, we need to consider all these trends. This is particularly evident \nwith respect to the degree (inaudible) reflect available information that is stock market efficiency. One important \nfactor that contributes to stock market efficiency (inaudible) analysis could not (inaudible) as we heard by the \n(inaudible).\n\nActive (inaudible) investors (inaudible) to make stock market efficient. But for the most part, we (inaudible) retail \ninvestors, so a shift from retail to industry investors (inaudible) from stock market (inaudible). (Inaudible) could \n(inaudible) from the stock market efficiency, but the shift towards hedge funds (inaudible) efficiency (inaudible) \nhedge funds from one (inaudible) mutual funds. Taken together, it is unclear (inaudible) among the (inaudible) \nanalysis.\n\nMoreover, even if it turns out (inaudible) has declined and look for two (inaudible). First, (inaudible) will be \n(inaudible). As stock prices become less efficient, the (inaudible) increases and for those (inaudible), right? \n(Inaudible) will just keep growing and growing and growing.\n\nSecond, in our current market structure (inaudible) substantially more on (inaudible) obstacle from a financial \nperspective. A lot of research has been able (inaudible) on the market, which is effectively (inaudible). Stock market \n(inaudible), but despite this (inaudible), stock market efficiency (inaudible) in secondary markets is very different \nfrom economic efficiency, the (inaudible) production, allocation (inaudible).\n\n\n\nFrom the economic perspective -- economic efficiency perspective, (inaudible) take 10 seconds, 10 minutes, 10 \nhours or 10 days to reflect new information. So securities (inaudible) make information available for market \nparticipants (inaudible) on a legal basis, but the (inaudible) basis for our fund (inaudible) for the SEC to encourage \nadditional expenditures (inaudible) analysis (inaudible) make the stock market (inaudible).\n\nAnd also with the second issue in terms of passive investing on corporate governance, if we (inaudible) information \n(inaudible) through superior performance (inaudible) portfolio manager (inaudible) and cast their votes.\n\n(Inaudible) investment (inaudible) predominant (inaudible), it is predominant for (inaudible). First, we determine the \namount of (inaudible) is a value increasing (inaudible).

(Inaudible) I \nshould say (inaudible) because of the outcome of the (inaudible).\n\nWhat about the (inaudible) because (inaudible) the (inaudible) the company. I'll also make two quick (inaudible) that \nI'm happy to elaborate later. First, (inaudible) of shares of commercial fund (inaudible) substantially will completely \n(inaudible) of the investors (inaudible) are established. There are some slight differences (inaudible).\n\nAt the fund family level, the (inaudible), they are paid (inaudible) fund. At the fund family level, the (inaudible), they \nare paid (inaudible) fund in order to decide (inaudible) fund. Index funds that doesn't have the effects (inaudible) \nfund.\n\nAnd second, (inaudible). And there is strong evidence (inaudible) that even (inaudible) funds (inaudible) (AUDIO \nGAP) shareholders (inaudible) problems and (inaudible) conflict of interest. Index funds are not all alike, but there's \nno basis of (inaudible) or having some (inaudible). Thank you very much.\n\nCOATES: Professor Kahan. And last but not at least, Bob Pozen, also an old friend who's now a senior lecturer at \nMIT, but more importantly, I think, for our purposes has a long career both at Fidelity and MFS, and has been a \nclose observer of these markets. So, Bob?\n\nPOZEN: Thank you, John, and thank you, Madam Chairman. Let me focus on the potential regulatory actions that \nthe Committee might consider are non-actions. I think the others because have done good job at reviewing the \neconomic and financial issues. So I'll make six points. The first one is that I would urge the Committee and the \nCommission to be neutral between passive and active. And I would urge that partly because of what people have \nsaid, index funds are price takers, so we do need active managers and active (inaudible) to set the price.\n\nAnd second of all related to that, while, on average, active managers don't do as well as index funds, some actually \ndo -- Peter Lynch at Magellan being the best example. But we also have asset categories that are less efficient \nwhere index managers may lose to active managers. And so we will let the market determine that.\n\nSecond of all, picking up on what Rodney said is I believe there is a class of index funds that are -- where there is a \nlabeling problem and they're mainly ETFs, which as we know are mainly indexed. But we have leveraged. We have \nshort in ETFs and they're usually high cost. They usually involve considerable conflicts of interest.\n\nWe have a lot of them in pretty niche markets, but I don't think they should be called ETFs indexes because they're \nreally so different than what people have come to expect as an ETF index that we ought to try to label them \ndifferently because otherwise, I think investors really have very little idea about how differently they behave and \nhow much more costly they are.\n\nThe third -- third point, which is maybe even more provocative is, you know, we saw today in The Journal Ron \nO'Hanley and Bill McNabb, two friends of mine, wrote a nice piece saying we should encourage IPOs more \nbecause we need more public securities for retail investors to buy, and we don't want all these securities to be in \nthe private market.\n\n\n\nSo, I note that index funds don't buy IPOs, but that's the way it is now. It -- I don't believe it's necessarily has to be \nthat way. You could think of an index fund with appropriate disclosure that said, \"We're going to buy IPOs of \ncompanies that are likely to qualify for index,\" or you could even have an index fund that said, well, we have a sort \nof side pocket of two or three percent or five percent, which buys IPOs. So as long as there was appropriate \ndisclosure, I think that the idea of having an index fund that buys IPO is reasonable, and it would be an important \nfactor in terms of bringing to bear this huge pool of capital to the IPO market. And I think it's really worth serious \nconsideration on the Committee's part.\n\nFourth point is on the corporate governance side, I would agree with Rob who made their position that we shouldn't \n-- we should again be neutral. We shouldn't be taking away. I know that John wrote the Chicago schools somehow \nthink we should take away votes from index funds. And then there are other people who think we should add votes \nbecause they're long-term. My view is we should be neutral and that's the way we ought to be.\n\nA fifth point is picking up on something Marcel said is I think we have to understand the voting of index funds and, \nin most cases, can be general. And I'll talk about that in a second. But when we come to activist, index funds are \nimportant fast followers. They don't initiate anything, but once an activist comes into a stock and proposes a \nprogram, essentially, what the activist is doing -- think about it, they're not making a tender offer. They're not \noffering you money. They're offering you a program, which they think will increase the longer-term value of the \nstock.\n\nAnd the answer I believe is sometimes it -- the program is good and sometimes it's not so good. But what we need \nis an intelligent and diligent group of large investors who are really analyzing this very carefully and hopefully \ncoming up with the best answer. And I believe that places like Vanguard, and State Street, and BlackRock and \nFidelity do a pretty good job partly because they're so big and partly because many of them have active funds that \nfollow these companies.\n\nBut these are very specific proposals. You can't evaluate them on the grounds whether this is good for corporate \ngovernance or not. These are very company-specific proposals.\n\nYou think about the DuPont case. It was a proposal to split the company in a certain way and, you know, you could \neither think that was a good thing or not such a good thing. The vote was very close, but what we want to make \nsure is that index funds managers are diligent and are willing to be company-specific when it comes to activist vote \nbecause those are the most important. Those of the cases in which the shareholders are really deciding whether to \nhave this management team or a different one, whether to have one strategy versus the other.\n\nSixth point, last point I want to make is about the more general proposition that index funds will promote generally \ngood corporate governance because they can't buy and sell individual stocks. And this is a position which most of \nthe big index managers take. And I guess, my view is it depends. In part, this may be true if the practice that's \nbeing supported is systematically going to lead to higher value. The problem is that some of the practices that are \nbeing supported may or may not lead to higher value. The evidence is mixed.\n\nThe best example is having an independent share of the work. So we know that the evidence is mixed, so we really \nshould be reluctant to have an index fund to say we do this to promote better corporate governance and \npresumably better performance of these companies.\n\nEverything that I just raise is a -- the similar thing, but probably even more controversial is to the extent that index \nfunds get into ESG, I think again they need to be able to say that -- that sort of ESG they're interested in and there \nare lots of definitions are -- is ESG that promotes long-term value systematically across the board if that's what \nthey're saying.\n\nIf, on the other hand, they want to -- some index funds want to pursue ESG for, let's say, social reasons, I think \nthat's Okay, too. You can -- you could have an index fund that says this is what we do. We're an index fund, but we \nvote in a way that promotes ESG. We're not sure whether it will learn -- lead to higher financial returns, but this is \nwhat we have. And then if you decide as an investor, you want to do that? Great.\n\n\n\nSo those are my six points. I can see I'm in the red light zone, so I will stop.\n\nCOATES: Terrific. Thank you all for that. And I'm happy to take questions from the Committee. I have many \nquestions. So if we -- nobody has any, but so far I saw Damon first then J.W., then Heidi.\n\nSILVERS: Thank you, John. Before I ask my question, John, I want to acknowledge Marcel Kahan who -- who \ntaught me bond law a long time ago. And I am just completely mystified as to how it is that I aged 20 years and he \ndidn't.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nAnd so it's just a great pleasure to see -- to see him even on the screen. You know, speaking about long-ago \nexperiences in education, 20 years ago I was in the Harvard Business School classroom at the end of my Harvard \nBusiness School education in a -- in the most advanced finance class. I had some fancy title. And one of the \nstudents in the last class asked the professor whom I'm going to leave nameless in case he's doing any consulting \nwork these days. They asked him how should I manage my money personally and -- oh, how should we manage \nour money? What advice would you give us as we leave Harvard Business School and go on to great wealth? How \nwe should manage our money?\n\nAnd so keeping in mind that this is about a sophisticated crowd of people as you could kind of imagine short of, you \nknow, a group of actual active traders, what what the professor said who, at that time, was, in fact, a consultant to a \nnumber of a very large and lucrative financial houses, what he said was, \"You have two choices.\" He said, one \nchoice is you -- and again this is the technology of the 90's, he said you could buy a Bloomberg terminal and install \nin your den and spend eight hours a day in front of it.\n\nHe said, \"I think that you're a smart guy and that if you do that, you outperform the market.\" He said, \"But if you're \nnot going to do that. my advice to you was the same advice I give my great aunt, which is buy -- buy Vanguard \nfunds.\"\n\nI haven't seen a single piece of data that -- that in the -- in the ensuing 20 years that suggest anything -- anything \nhas disproved that proposition. And it's one of the reasons why I'm a fan of big institutions as -- as investors \nbecause they can buy Bloomberg terminals and have smart people sit in front of them all day.\n\nMe, personally, I invest in index funds. And so I'm skeptical -- deeply skeptical about the notion that there's any -- \nthat -- that particular in light of the fact that what index funds have done is save a lot of people a lot of fees. I'm just \nsort of deeply skeptical that there's any problem here. The -- the -- at all. And -- but I -- but I would like to ask the \npanelists about the one problem that does bother me a little bit about index funds.\n\nWe are, after all, in that period of time when we are celebrating the 10th anniversary of the -- of the financial crisis. \nAnd one of the things that happened in the financial crisis that has kind of been forgotten now is that various \nclasses of securities didn't do what they were supposed to do and various styles of investment management didn't \ndo what they were supposed to do in the crash.\n\nThere were problems with money markets. There were problems -- very severe problems with lifestyle funds that \nwere did -- were not designed with the people were told they were designed. And there were problems with hedge \nfunds that just ended up performing exactly like an index fund.\n\nThe money market funds, in particular, the problems with the money market funds raised disintermediation issues \nthat the -- the funds could form as -- as -- as promised in terms of keeping the dollar. And so what I'm concerned \nabout and some of the testimony here sort of brought it to the floor, what I'm concerned about here is the question \nof under stress, are the -- are the structures we have in the index space, both ETFs and mutual funds, are they -- \nand are there significant differences between the two in terms of raising disintermediation problems under stress? \nAnd is this something that the -- that we should at all be concerned about as the -- as the assets -- as the -- as the \nasset class grows. So, I put that to you all.\n\n\n\nPOZEN: I'll be glad to talk, but I think Rob should really elaborate. I think there is a much greater problem under \nstress with ETFs than index funds because of the mechanism that ETFs use with these authorized people. And so \nthe evidence he gave is ETFs, and it's not surprising because there can be quite a big gap between that.\n\nOn index funds, you don't have that sort of gap, but I think probably just blue skying it, we haven't really had a time \nin which there would be huge redemptions of index funds. I mean, part of the tax efficiency of index funds is that \nthey're gradually buying a little. So we don't know that much. It's probably true that the S&P 500 is a deep enough \nmarket that there'd be relatively little, you know, side effects.\n\nBut now that we have indexes on almost anything, I noticed that there was an ETF now. I think it's called the \ncountry music ETF that has only companies in the Nashville area.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSo, I hesitate to ...\n\n(UNKNOWN): It's (inaudible) ...\n\nPOZEN: ... understand what would happen in the time of stress for country music. But I think we have lots of \nindexes now that have lots of smaller and midsized stocks.\n\nAnd so Rob may have more sense of what -- what happens in those markets.\n\nSHARPS: I think there -- there is an issue. I think it tends to present itself more in less liquid asset classes during \nperiods of stress or meaningful sentiment shifts. And I'd say probably most prevalent in sector or thematic \nexchange-traded product, but not entirely limited to that. In some of these instances, look, the vast majority of \npassive flows are going into exchange-traded funds, right, much more so than open-ended funds.\n\nAnd in some of these instances, the exchange-traded funds does -- it does a poor job of replicating the return \nstream of the underlying index, and it creates an illusion of liquidity. As long as you're buying and selling between \npeople that are interested in the exchange-traded product, that's great. When you have a meaningful imbalance \nfrom a supply-demand perspective, you've got to either redeem or create certificates and you've got to sell or buy \nthe underlying security.\n\nIn instances like early 2016 in the high-yield bond market or late 2016 in the small cap U.S. equity market, the \ndemand that was being channeled through those index products created dislocation in the underlying securities. It \nraised the -- the -- the correlation among those underlying securities and distorted the prices for a period of time. \nUltimately, it resolves itself, right? But you -- you have, as a result, the sentiment, fear and greed distorted prices in \nthe security markets all the time. The question is how extreme do they get and how long do they last? Because the \none thing that I would say is, given the magnitude of the shift, $2 trillion plus over, you know, kind of the decade \nplus period of time, I think it -- it will become more prominent and will become of a greater magnitude.\n\nIf you have fewer people endeavoring to tether the value of an individual security to the underlying stream of cash \nflows that it's entitled to or represents, you're likely to have dislocations that last a longer period of time or are \ngreater. Again, I think that they're -- they're, I guess, relatively infrequent in the big scheme of things today and for \nthe most part relatively minor is the point is and I -- I wouldn't contest some of the claims with regard to their \nbenefits of indexation. I mean, I think they're -- they're pretty clear for people who either don't have the resources or \nthe interest to identify an active manager that can -- that can outperform.\n\nBut I do think in -- in the interest of thinking about liquidity, market, depth and price discovery, there is a point \nwhere there is too much of a good thing, right? And, you know, the statistics that -- that Rodney gave with regard to \nfive percent in terms of passive trading volume, you contrast that to report that came out from J.P. Morgan last \nweek where they say only 10 percent of trading volume and equities right now is security to security and really \nengaged in price discovery, right? Those are pretty extreme, right? Five percent versus 90 percent.\n\n\n\nThe truth, I'm sure is somewhere in between and it really depends on the nature of how you structure it. But I -- I -- I \nthink this is something that should be on your radar and bears -- you know, kind of it bears watching, particularly in \nareas of the market where there -- where the underlying security is much less liquid than the ETF creates the \nillusion of.\n\nVERRET: I was surprised when I got here, but I -- I was glad to hear that the tenor of the conversation has been \nmostly, I think, about a need for the SEC to stay ambivalent about the difference between passive and active. And \nalso I should say, you're talking about the heritage and legacy. I'm honored to sit next to my corporate law professor \nand then next to him was my securities law professor.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCan you imagine what a treat that was? And now I teach corporate and securities law. It must have been because \nthey were pretty good at -- at that. So that was a real treatment. I'm glad you're all here.\n\nSo I -- I'm hopeful the Commission stays ambivalent between -- between strategies, both active or passive between \ntypes of passive products in the same way that I've hoped though. Unfortunately, the Commission is not always \ndoing the best job of staying ambivalent between long and short or ambivalent between long-term traders and \nshort-term traders.\n\nPOZEN: Let's call it neutral rather than ambivalent.\n\nVERRET: Well, Okay, either way, either way. It's not the Commission's job to make those determinations, it's the \nmarket's job. And I -- I think that we have to appreciate. I think that if we brought in, you know, some of the folks in \nthe active trading world, they would say that the returns to active trading generally tend to correlate with \nopportunities when we're active trading, which are created by the increase in passive investing.\n\nBut back to the specific recommendations, there -- there are a number of good ideas raised, I think, along the way \nthat would be good ideas beyond a -- a -- a comparison between active and passive like taking another look at \nsmall companies. And -- and I think what -- what Mr. Sharps was alluding to was the -- was the portfolio restrictions \non smaller companies that -- that '40 Act firms face.\n\nAnd I guess, my first question is is that a good recommendation contained in the Treasury Department's report on -\n- on capital markets reforms? Do those portfolio restrictions make sense anymore in light of other things that \ndisincentivize large mutual funds from taking large positions in firms? So I think -- I think it's a 10 percent \nrequirement where limitation we're talking about.\n\nAnd then secondly on ESG, I appreciated the -- Bob's thoughts about disclosure. Do this discussion about ESG run \ndeeper with respect to -- to the often unclear, but still ever present fiduciary obligations of investment advisors to the \nextent that recommendations are made beyond those that are economically defensible. Is it just a disclosure issue \nor are there some fiduciary obligations (inaudible)? Two questions.\n\nCOATES: And I -- I apologize. Anne waived to get maybe me to notice that Rodney might have wanted to respond \nlast time. You have to give your -- yeah, go ahead.\n\nCOMEGYS: So again, I think one thing I just like to say is about the ETF structure, the ETF structure itself again the \nquestion. I think, in general, the ETF structure, as liquidity, is the second place of the market. It adds secondary \ntrading volume, so ETF trader -- ETF trader actually makes up the majority of ETF trading. Alternatively, and I'm \ncompletely agreeing with Bob that ultimately though even with that extra liquidity, it's only as good as it's underlying \npositions. I'd also point out in sometimes there is an illusion of liquidity that may not be there in a point of stress or \ntime.\n\nSecond thing we've always told investors is to make sure you can stand the volatility of what you're buying, so \nwhether it's a narrow niche ETF, that may not be appropriate nor able to withstand the time period, and it's the \nworst time to sell is in a depressed market with stress.\n\n\n\nThen finally, I would say just 2008 tested the ETF market. ETFs performed exactly mechanically how they should. \nUnfortunately, for equity markets, that was a very large loss, but they remain liquid and they are made able to meet \nthe needs of investors. That is a little bit because I think we sometimes lose sight of the fact while we talk about the \nthings that are very small. The majority of index flows and the majority ETF flows, top 20 ETFs are all large-cap \nbroad-based equity or bond-type vehicles. There are small high-yield in there, less liquidity, but these are very \nliquid vehicles.\n\nBy the way, in the time of stress and active manager also has to sell. They have to make two choices. They have to \nchoose to -- how to sell and raise liquidity. They also choose whether to leave a less liquid position in their portfolio \nbecause they don't like price. That's a tougher ask. In expense simply goes proportionally across its portfolio \nliquidating 503,000 securities whatever it might be.\n\nCOATES: Right. Bob, you want to answer J.W.'s first question if you -- if you can? Robert, sorry. There's two Bobs.\n\nSHARPS: With regard to placing restriction or limitation on the amount of a -- of a smaller mid-cap company that an \ninvestment company can own ...\n\n(UNKNOWN): I think (inaudible).\n\nSHARPS: Yeah, I'm -- I'm not familiar with that, right? I mean, I don't believe there's a 10 percent ceiling as it exists. \nI mean, we -- we -- we own north of 15 percent of many, many companies. There are industries -- banking, \ninsurance, gaming where there are regulatory restrictions that might limit you to 10 percent ownership. There are \ninstances where there might be a poison pill, but I'm not aware of any existing regulatory restriction on an \ninvestment company's ability to own more than 10 percent of a company on behalf of its clients.\n\nCOATES: Great. Then Bob on ESG?\n\nPOZEN: On the ESG, I think you're -- I would say that fiduciary and disclosure come together. They don't always \ncome together. But since ESG is a very diffused term, it means lots of things to lots of people. I think the key is that \nwhatever the fund is doing, whether it be an index fund or not an index fund on ESG that I just disclosed to the -- \nthe shareholders so that they can feel comfortable with the fund.\n\nAs we know, you know, if -- if investors are there because they want to maximize financial return that you can have \nan ESG strategy that's consistent with that, you just say that. But you can choose to -- we know there are social \nfunds, and there's no reason why you couldn't have a index fund with the social voting agenda as long as it's \ndisclosed. So, my view is that sort of a -- there isn't as -- as long as we're disclosing the shareholders, what we're \nactually doing, why we're doing it, what we expect to do, if they buy in, you know, for a mutual fund that's Okay.\n\n(UNKNOWN): You think the big guys need some work on that (inaudible)?\n\nPOZEN: Well, I -- I think -- I think that it's too -- it's too quick to say we take an ESG approach because it's going to \nbring about long-term financial returns. It may in certain types of ESG different, and if that's what you're holding out \nto investors then you ought to deliver. But you don't necessarily have to do that, but if you're going to do that, you \nought to spend some time to make sure that what you're doing is systematically going to promote long-term \nfinancial return if that's what you've told investors.\n\nCOATES: Heidi?\n\nSTAM: Yes, thank you to all the panelists for contributing to our education here. And as I listen carefully, I -- I do \nhear in a couple of different camps that there's not a lot to do here, but we do need to be smarter and understand \nthese markets.\n\nOne thing that I observed just in the commentary, I think we paint with too broad a brush when we say passive. I \nmean, that can -- that means a lot of things. It means different things to different people. There's obviously a place \n\n\n\nfor active and passive investing. They all contribute to the marketplace. But as I listen, I hear things, well, index \nfunds don't invest in IPOs. Well, they do.\n\nIndex funds follow activists, well, so do active managers follow activists in various activities. So I just would caution \nthe group and ask for comment from our experts about, you know, how we might think about this over time and not \nfall into the trap of bundling this entire market together, but looking at it where the problems, if they arise, they may \nbe because they're in a very small illiquid market or because there is something else that's going on. I -- I just worry \nabout whipping everything together. So any comments on that would be (inaudible).\n\nPOZEN: Well, I would agree with you, Heidi. I think one important distinction we've been making is between ETF \nindex and index funds because I think they do operate differently. Second one, which we've talked about is index \nfunds, which are the bulk of the assets that are in these very deep asset classes versus ones that are in thinly \ntraded. And so I think those are two very important distinctions.\n\nAnd then, you know, as you say passive includes lots of different strategies, some of them very complicated \nderivative strategies, et cetera. I don't think that's what we're really talking about here. We're -- so far we have been \ntalking mainly about mutual index mutual funds and index ETF.\n\nDOGGETT: I would just going to make a comment about the ESG point. In some sense, that's a little bit like a \nfundamental index, right? It's something a little different. And to the extent that a manager wants to put forth that \nthey have a kind of commission-based portfolio and that's consistent with the values of the investors, and they \nmake that choice and it's disclosed, and there's been -- it's really -- that's -- that's just a choice that the investor has \nto make. They're not really making a promise about what the return is, it's just more about invest along the lines of \nyour values and its best efforts.\n\nCOATES: Great. Lisa?\n\nFAIRFAX: Thank you. So, thanks to the panelists, I want to echo that as well. I teach a seminar on shareholder \nactivism and influence. And just last week we were talking about the rise in passive, so this is right on target that I \ncan now bring back to my students so they can know I'm telling them the truth.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nI just wanted actually -- and this follows, I think, very nicely on to what Heidi just said, but wanted to -- specifically \nwith regard to both Robert's observations regarding corporate governance. And for me, I -- I think I was a little \npuzzled as to what exactly you wanted the takeaway to be with respect to that. And -- and I feel like maybe that is \nbecause I was feeling like maybe you were bundling all of -- kind you are using passive and its relationship to \ncorporate governance in a way that suggested no differentiation.\n\nSo I guess, two questions. The -- the first is is it your view that the corporate governance strategies associated with \npassive is somehow different that there is a kind of fundamental distinction there that we should be concerned \nabout?\n\nAnd -- and then the second is it's really, Robert Sharps, when you -- and he said something and maybe I just didn't \ncatch it about corporate governance. And the concern we should at least be starting to think about, I was trying to \npuzzle through, should we be concerned because they're not voting with management? Is it because you think \nthey are not voting responsively? Is it a disclosure point? I just wanted to kind of unpack and get a little bit more \nclarification around kind of what you think we should be thinking about in relation to the corporate governance \nissue.\n\nDOGGETT: I'll try to address both of those briefly. To some extent to further Rodney with regard to how Vanguard \napproaches the governance process and how they vote their proxies, my understanding is that most of the large \npassive investment sponsors -- Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street -- have invested very heavily in their \ngovernance teams and their ability to analyze and assess high-level issues, issues with regard to shareholder \n\n\n\nrights, issues with regard to compensation -- compensation and incentive structures, issues with regard to \nstaggered boards -- all of the sorts of things that -- that, you know, kind of generally come up.\n\nI do believe that our process is different. And I think the point that I was trying to make is I actually think that the \nactive -- that the approach that we take and the more top-down issue-oriented approach that the passive folks take \ntends to work reasonably well together.\n\nWe actually delegate proxy voting responsibility to our portfolio managers. We actually believe that voting proxies \nis an investment decision, that they are the fiduciaries that are representing our client's interest and they're best \npositioned to decide on, you know, kind of all of the issues. In many instances, it -- you know, it's kind of relatively \nstraightforward. There is not something that's contested or controversial and it will be -- you know, kind of the vote \nwill be very consistent with what our standard policies are from our proxy committee.\n\nIn instances where there is something that requires more nuance, lead independent director or, you know, kind of -- \nyou know, or -- or, you know, independent chair, it depends on the situation. And I think our investment \nprofessionals, our research analysts and portfolio managers are very well-equipped to determine the right way to \nvote in those sorts of instances.\n\nSo, I think the question basically to me was do I view the way active investors vote proxies as being different than \nthe way passive investors do? And I do. I think most active investors look at governance as a question of \ninvestment decision-making at the security level. And I would say, you know, without speaking on behalf of the \npassive votes that, in general, they tend to view it from a top-down policy level. What are our governance policy is \ngoing to be? And I would say that there -- there are more uniformly applied, maybe not entirely uniformly applied, \nbut more uniformly applied than they would be at your price.\n\nPOZEN: Yeah, I just want to follow-up and say that I think I agree with what Rob -- Rob said. I think the activists \npresent sort of difficult situation for some index funds that don't follow individual companies because these \nprograms of these activists are very company-specific, they're very detailed and usually management disagrees. \nAnd so having analysts who know the company deeply and followed it for several years gives an insight. And as I \nsaid, place like Fidelity and BlackRock happen to have active, you know, analysts itself. But if you had an index \nfund that didn't have someone who say covered DuPont, well, then they have to make a decision to get up to speed \non the very specific things.\n\nNevertheless, the index funds are the arbitrator on a lot of these activists, so we really do want them to get up to \nspeed on the specific issues. And for the smaller index funds it could be a resource issue. I'm just not sure.\n\nCOATES: Rodney?\n\nCOMEGYS: I think it's important we just take a minute and talk about what an index firm like Vanguard does and \nhow we do proxy voting. So, first of all, we are a passive investor when it comes to investing in the market. We're \nnot devono (ph). We have a responsibility for the long-term value of our shareholders. We have fiduciary \nresponsibility very seriously. And as Robert mentioned, we put a lot of resources to it.\n\nOn many issues, such as governance, we are top-down and we are philosophically trying to find the ways in the \ngovernance system and in the way companies report to ensure that we have the -- that the world has the best \ninformation to the long-term value. However, when it comes to something like a shareholder activist versus \nmanagement, we have to take possession and we take that position very seriously. We take a ton of inputs in every \ninput that we can take, including, I'm not sure people recognized that Vanguard has over $1 trillion of active \nmanagement assets and 30 different sub-advisors that we use. We're certainly going to take their input as we \ndecide a controversial or a tight vote.\n\nWe'll even take the information of T. Rowe Price's active managers as an input. We're glad to take it. We're a \npassive investor, we take information very well. We want to make the best decision. We have an obligation.\n\n\n\nThere is a nuanced difference, though, between any active investor and a passive investor. And sometimes our \nvote may be different for simply this reason. The active investor has the opportunity to increase value. It may be in \na short-term like an activist typically would next the position or even a good active manager with this time period \nthat's not indefinite. We have an indefinite holding period for our companies and, therefore, sometimes we can have \na good decision that's a different decision. And so that's how we go about voting our proxies and we take it very \nseriously in a very active way.\n\nCOATES: Great. Jennifer, last question.\n\nMARIETTA-WESTBERG: Thank you for your time and expertise in talking to the panel today. When I hear about \nthe rise of passive investing, sometimes it seems that that trend is being extrapolated that the rise of passive funds \nwill continue unabated. And as J.W. noted, the rise of passive funds should create opportunities for active funds. \nAnd in thinking about the need for regulatory intervention, we're often looking to what is the market friction or the \nmarket failure that drives that need. So, is there a market friction that is stopping the market from finding its own \nequilibrium, active and passive investments?\n\nDOGGETT: In -- in the long run, I don't think so. In -- in the short run right now, you know, I think the -- the -- we \nhave bid in an environment that heavily favors cap-weighted indices in U.S. equities. And as a result of that, the -- \nthe -- I'd say fundamental case for passive has been further reinforced by what I'd call kind of a recency bias. The \nstatistics in terms of the percent of active managers that outperform the benchmark are at a cyclical lower point \nthan they have been if you look at them in the fullness of time.\n\nThere is, I think, a very prevalent narrative in the marketplace that passive is always the right solution because it's \nlower cost. And also because you don't -- you won't underperform a benchmark.\n\nUnderperformance is not risk. You know, I -- I think if you look there have been periods of time where there -- the \nmedian active manager has outperformed passive for an extended period of time, it tends to happen after inflection \npoints when the cap-weighted indices lead to concentrated exposures. So, Japan got to be about half of the weight \nof IFA in the late 80's. And for an extended period of time in the 90's, active management, you know, was able to \nfeast on that reversal by simply being underweight Japan.\n\nTechnology, media and telecom, as an aggregate, at the -- at the end of the 1990's became a very large portion of \n(inaudible) basically half of the market cap of the S&P 500 an extended period of time in the 2000s where the \nmedian active manager -- large-cap active manager outperform. I also think there's a bit of a generalization on \nbehalf of -- or the -- to the benefit of passive. I think people take the statistics that are broadly looking at S&P 500 \nrelative to active domestic equity and extrapolate them to a lot of different asset classes. The success rate away \nfrom large-cap U.S. equity is lower and, in many instances, the success rate of active management actually beats \npassive. And in many instances, the cost of passive are much higher than what are promoted.\n\nI think the Vanguard folks are much more transparent. They do do, you know, cover a very good job, and I think \nthere are some passive sponsors, and there are some passive products, whether it's emerging market equity, \nemerging market debt, bank loan where the index replication is very poor, where the costs are high and, ultimately, \nan active management product, an active solution is better.\n\nAnd right now I think the narrative is so strong in the favor of passive that people are really, really afraid almost in \ncertain instances, fiduciary instances to consider an active alternative even if it is in their own best interest or the \nbest interest of their client.\n\nPOZEN: I think we have no reason to believe that the market won't reach an equilibrium. It may very likely be a \ndifferent equilibrium point for different types of indexes and different types of asset classes. But presumably if 90 \npercent of the S&P 500 were an index then active managers would easily find a great opportunity. So I think there \nis, but we have no idea what it is. We have no idea whether it's 50 percent, 40 percent, 60 percent, but my strong \nintuition is it's a a different number, different percentage for different asset classes and different indexes, different \nconstructions.\n\n\n\nCOATES: Rodney?\n\nCOMEGYS: Yeah, so I do think there is probably one structural impediment that makes it tough or active. It's the \nfees, so the fees of an active fund, I apologize, for 2016 it's 75 basis points on average. It's not a reflection of the \nfolks over here, but that gives you over 50 basis points headwind right off the bat, so as active funds come down in \nprice, they'll compete better. They'll have less of a headwind to overcome.\n\nActive management is really hard. We believe we have a trillion dollars of assets under management that we want \nto outperform every day. It's a competitive world, very smart people.\n\n(Inaudible) the example earlier of just great technology, great thinkers trying to outperform the market, activists \ncompeting with other active, and the fees actually make indexing work well. So I think that's the structural \nimpediment. As fees come down, you might see equilibrium hit sooner.\n\nCOATES: Great. Terrific discussion. Did Damon put his tag back up? Okay, very quickly, I hope.\n\nSILVERS: Yeah.\n\nCOATES: Yeah.\n\nSILVERS: A very brief question that was raised by something that Bob said earlier and then that Rodney said just a \ncouple minutes ago about the -- the tension perhaps between -- and time horizons in active and passive. And the \nquestion I have is what does that mean in term -- what are the implications of that and should we be concerned \nabout that in context where mutual fund complexes have the actives driving the corporate governance decision-\nmaking when -- when the tail is wagging the dog, so to speak?\n\nPOZEN: I know -- I think that complexes are very capable of having different votes for index funds versus active \nmanagement if they have a different objective and a different time frame.\n\nSILVERS: I mean, I -- you said earlier that you thought that it was a good thing, so to speak, that -- that the -- that \nthe analytic shop that the active fund ...\n\nPOZEN: You know, they -- they have -- so that gives ...\n\n(Crosstalk)\n\nSILVERS: ... the decision-making.\n\nPOZEN: Yeah. Well, that gives them all the input that they need, but they can -- they could choose to make a \ndifferent decision if they felt that the time horizon was really important, but they -- in order to do that they need a \nhuge amount of information.\n\nSILVERS: Yeah. I think this is an important outgrowth of this conversation to point out, as Rodney did, that there is \na tension here and time horizons going active and passive funds. And by the way, I just note something, Bob, you -- \nI really appreciated what you said earlier about the ESG issue.\n\nIn -- in my experience there's someone in the -- who's been involved in ESG stuff, there's no major sort of, you \nknow, return-oriented index fund that doesn't not apply to exactly the kind of criteria to these -- to corporate \ngovernance decisions that you suggest they should. It's a very -- they are -- the index fund complexes are all, in my \nexperience, extremely value-oriented. You -- you got to make that pitch on ESG. They are not running a cohort \nagenda as I have witnessed many times.\n\nCOATES: Any last? Great. Thank you all for that. I will -- I'll just leave since I didn't ask any questions , I'll leave you \nwith one last thought. And I take Jennifer's point that past trends don't predict future trends, but I understood the \ndata presentation earlier to suggest that the trends driving the trend right now, the underlying factors driving the \ntrends right now are not changing anytime soon.\n\n\n\nAnd I do think the major friction is retail investors took -- how long did it take for Vanguard to get to work out? They \nwere (inaudible) in 1976 ...\n\nCOMEGYS: Seventy six, '74.\n\nCOATES: ... four or six, somewhere in there. And they didn't really -- they didn't become the top ...\n\nCOMEGYS: Six (inaudible) passive fund except for the complex.\n\nCOATES: ... they didn't become the top bond fund until just recently, and they didn't become the topic equity fund \nuntil 20, 30 years after the invention. The idea hasn't changed. It just takes a long time for that idea to penetrate the \nretail markets. And then having penetrated it's getting a lot of momentum even past equilibrium point that almost \ncertainly will eventually happen.\n\nSo to that reason, heres my last thing to leave you with, I think we're going to go pretty soon already if you look at \nIBM's top three, the big three, you know, 20 percent. I think you add in the other indexes, they're not above five so \nwe don't know where they are. It's probably more like 25 or 30. I think we're going to be at 50 plus percent of votes \nheld by five funds soon for a lot of the S&P 500.\n\nAnd I think even if you believe everything you heard about good governance, and investments, and different ways, \nand -- and -- and (inaudible) thing about it, that's a very different world to imagine having five people at least in \nprinciple sitting around being able to sway every vote for every major public company. And that's one thing to keep \nour eyes on, so I'll stop there.\n\nThank you, Anne. Turn it back over to you.\n\nSHEEHAN: On that happy note, thank you all. This was a great panel and I appreciate you presenting to us. I really \ndo. It was -- it was terrific.\n\nSo, for the Committee, last couple of things, I'm going to ask Matt to take about a couple minutes and just give an \nupdate on what your subcommittee is working on.\n\nJohn Coates, I'm going to have you also talk about yours. I guess, I'll channel Barb Roper. Really it has been the \ndiscussion we had a lunch and look -- look to -- for an email from me about continuing further discussion on the -- \nthe Reg BI recommendation.\n\nSo, Matt, why don't you take it away and then we'll turn over to John, and then we'll adjourn.\n\nFURMAN: I'll just note for the Committee that, at our last meeting, the Committee adopted a set of \nrecommendations on -- on retail protections in the corporate and municipal bond markets. One of the \nrecommendations actually has come to fruition already, but the SEC didn't adopt amendments to Rule 15c2-12. \nAnd that was -- if you read the adopting release, you'll see a number of references to -- to the -- to the \nrecommendations that we made.\n\nWe -- we continue to look at -- at issues related to small-cap liquidity and market structure impediments to -- to that. \nAnd we will continue to do that and may -- sometime have some of recommendations on that front. And those are \nthe two main things we're looking at.\n\nSHEEHAN: John?\n\nCOATES: Great. So, in our Subcommittee, we -- I have a draft that's been circulated, but we have not yet had time \nto discuss on possible additions to Reg SK related to human capital, which now, broadly speaking, represents a \nmuch bigger share of the value of large companies than certainly was when SK was written and even when it was \nless substantially revised. This is an invitation to some extent of Bill Hinman and others to help them think about \nhow to respond to that shift, so that's something we're working on, but it's in early stages.\n\n\n\nAnd then we have a cyber risk, which this Committee has previously discussed in -- in public forum, which we'll \ncome back to in light of that discussion. So those are our (inaudible).\n\nSHEEHAN: Great. So, just a couple of things, as I say, look -- look for an email from your first staff and follow-up on \nour discussion on the recommendation.\n\nAnd then, J.W., actually for December one of our panelists is going to be what is going on on ESG report and what \nare investors asking for from companies, what are companies reporting on, what are some of the models, you \nknow, that are reporting, what's going on at SASB, what's going on at the TCFD, the -- you know, and what is the \nstate of play.\n\nThis Committee had a hearing two years ago, I believe, on integrated reporting, and so I think it's time to sort of \ncome back and say, Okay, how has the market changed in this? So apropos of your comments on the ESG.\n\nAnd then we are also looking at the FINRA arbitration award issue and some of the issues surrounding that, you \nknow, the collection of those legislation that's pending and some other ideas in that regard. So that will probably be \nour -- our two panel discussions for December in addition to whatever issues the Subcommittees want to bring \nforward.\n\nWhat I would do is we're always looking for, you know, topics going forward sort of strategically setting our schedule \nfor next year. I think you all got the dates for our meetings for next year. Myself and the exec committee as we set \nthe agenda are always open to ideas, so please do not hesitate to send me an email or send a note or whatever if \nyou have some suggestions for like the topics today, you know, sort of big issues that we could tee up, perhaps \nsome that may result in recommendations.\n\nI'm not sure the second panel. This is more of a -- it was sort of an education, you know, just kind of watching \nwhat's going on and what are the trends. I could see perhaps on the first, the proxy plumbing looking to maybe hear \nfrom the Commission if they have their roundtable and perhaps this group could come up with something on that. \nBut I welcome any ideas that anyone may have in terms of topics that'd be of interest to the Committee.\n\nSo, any other comments, questions from the Committee members, either those here present or those on the \nphone? If not, then we will see you in December and we'll be chatting in the meantime. Thanks.\n"}
