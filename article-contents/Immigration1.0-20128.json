ACTION: Notice of proposed forms revisions. --------------------------------------------------------------\n--------- SUMMARY: This document contains proposed changes to the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report forms, \nincluding the Form 5500, Annual Return/ Report of Employee Benefit Plan (Form 5500 Annual Return/Report), and \nthe Form 5500-SF, Short Form Annual Return/Report of Small Employee Benefit Plan (Form 5500-SF). The annual \nreturns/reports are filed for employee pension and welfare benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The proposed revisions in this Notice reflect \nefforts of the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation \n(collectively Agencies) to improve employee benefit plan reporting for filers, the public, and the Agencies by \nmodernizing financial information filed regarding plans; updating fee and expense information on plan service \nproviders with a focus on harmonizing annual reporting requirements with the Department of Labor's final disclosure \nrequirements enhancing mineability of data filed on annual return/reports; requiring reporting by all group health \nplans covered by Title I of ERISA, including adding a new Schedule J (Group Health Plan Information); and \nimproving compliance under ERISA and the Code through selected new questions regarding plan operations, \nservice provider relationships, and financial management of the plan. These revisions, which are being proposed in \nconjunction with a recompete of the ERISA Filing and Acceptance System (EFAST2) contract, if adopted, generally \nwould apply for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2019. EFAST2 is expected to begin processing the Plan \n\n\nYear 2019 Form 5500 Annual Return/Report beginning January 1, 2020. The proposed revisions would affect \nemployee pension and welfare benefit plans, plan sponsors, administrators, and service providers to plans subject \nto annual reporting requirements under ERISA and the Code. DATES: Written comments must be received by the \nDepartment of Labor on or before October 4, 2016. ADDRESSES: To facilitate the receipt and processing of written \ncomment letters on the proposed regulation, EBSA encourages interested persons to submit their comments \nelectronically.

For further information on an item not mentioned above, contact Ms. Blumenthal. The telephone \nnumbers referenced above are not toll-free numbers, except as otherwise provided. Customer service information: \nIndividuals interested in obtaining information from the DOL concerning Title I of ERISA may call the EBSA Toll-\nFree Hotline at 1-866-444-EBSA (3272) or visit the DOL's Web site (           www.dol.gov/ebsa). SUPPLEMENTARY \nINFORMATION: Sections 101 and 104 of Title I and section 4065 of Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 (ERISA) and sections 6057(b), 6058(a), and 6059(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n(Code), and related regulations, impose annual reporting and filing obligations on pension and welfare benefit \nplans, as well as on certain other entities. Plan administrators, employers, and others generally satisfy these annual \nreporting obligations by filing the Form 5500, Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan together with any \nrequired schedules and attachments (Form 5500 Annual Return/Report), or Form 5500-SF, Short Form Annual \nReturn/Report of Small Employee Benefit Plan (Form 5500-SF).\\1\\ Specifically, filing of the [[Page 47535]] Form \n5500 or, for eligible filers the Form 5500-SF, with any required schedules and attachments in accordance with the \ninstructions and related regulations, constitutes compliance under Title I of ERISA with the applicable limited \nexemption, alternative method of compliance, and simplified reporting prescribed in 29 CFR 2520.103-1, et seq. \nSuch filings will also satisfy an applicable plan administrator's annual reporting obligation under section 4065 of \nTitle IV of ERISA. Filing of a Form 5500 or Form 5500-SF, together with the required attachments and schedules in \naccordance with the instructions, by plan administrators, employers, and certain other entities also satisfies the \nannual filing and reporting requirements under Code sections 6057(b), 6058(a) and 6059(a).\\2\\ ---------------------------\n------------------------------------------------ \\1\\ Certain one-participant plans and foreign plans that are not subject to the \nrequirements of section 104(a) of ERISA are required to file Form 5500-EZ with the IRS on paper, or voluntarily file \nelectronically using Form 5500-SF to satisfy certain annual reporting and filing obligations imposed by the Code. \nBeginning with the 2015 plan year, however, some filers are required to file their annual returns electronically using \nForm 5500-SF instead of filing a paper Form 5500-EZ if the filer is required to file at least 250 returns of any type \nwith the IRS. See Treasury Regulations section 301.6058-2 for more information on mandatory electronic filing of \nemployee retirement benefit plan returns. \\2\\ Some filing requirements under these provisions are not within the \n\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nmailto:e-ORI@dol.gov\nmailto:e-ORI@dol.gov\nhttp://www.regulations.gov/\nhttp://www.dol.gov/ebsa\nhttp://www.dol.gov/ebsa\n\n\nscope of this Notice. For example, multiple employer welfare arrangements and certain entities claiming exception \nare required to file with the DOL the Form M-1 (Report for Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangements (MEWAs) and \nCertain Entities Claiming Exception (ECEs)). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Form \n5500 Annual Return/Report serves as the principal source of information and data available to the DOL, the IRS, \nand the PBGC (collectively the Agencies) concerning the operations, funding, and investments of approximately \n806,000 pension and welfare benefit plans. These plans cover roughly 143 million workers, retirees, and \ndependents of private sector pension and welfare plans \\3\\ with estimated assets of $8.7 trillion.\\4\\ Accordingly, the \nForm 5500 Annual Return/Report is essential to each Agency's enforcement, research, and policy formulation \nprograms. They are also an important source of information and data for use by other federal agencies, Congress, \nand the private sector in assessing employee benefit, tax, and economic trends and policies. The Form 5500 \nAnnual Return/Report also serves as the primary means by which the operations of plans can be monitored by plan \nparticipants and beneficiaries and by the general public. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\\3\\ Source: U.S. Department of Labor, EBSA calculations using the March 2014 Current Population Survey Annual \nSocial and Economic Supplement and the 2013 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. \\4\\ EBSA projected ERISA \ncovered pension, welfare, and total assets based on the 2013 Form 5500 Annual Return/Report filings with the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor (DOL), reported SIMPLE assets from the Investment Company Institute (ICI) Report: The U.S. \nRetirement Market, Second Quarter 2015, and the Federal Reserve Statistical Release Z.1 Financial Accounts of \nthe United States (Sept. 18, 2015). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Generally, the \nAgencies have conducted a notice and comment rulemaking initiative to implement significant overhauls of the \nstructure of the forms and schedules coincident with changes to the EFAST system. Past revisions to the forms and \nschedules have addressed changes to applicable law, changes in employee benefit plans and financial markets, \nand corresponding shifts in agency priorities and needs. The Agencies have also made changes to reduce costs \nand make filing and processing more efficient. In interim years, the Agencies have made other discrete changes as \nset forth annually in the ``Changes to Note'' section in the instructions, some of which have involved targeted \nrulemaking activity to implement reporting changes required by law.\\5\\ The Agencies' last major tri-agency revision \nto the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report was proposed in 2006, 71 FR 41615 (Jul. 21, 2006), and finalized in 2007, \neffective for the 2009 form series. 72 FR 64731 (Nov. 16, 2007). -------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------- \\5\\ See, e.g., Revisions to Annual Return/Report--Multiple- Employer Plans, Interim Final Rule, 79 FR 66617 \n(Nov. 10, 2014); Filings Required of Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangements and Certain Other Related Entities, \nFinal Rule, 78 FR 13781 (Mar. 1, 2013). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This forms \nrevision proposal generally is being coordinated with a recompete of the contract for the ERISA Filing Acceptance \nSystem II (EFAST2)--the wholly electronic system operated by a private-sector contractor for the processing of \nForm 5500 Annual Return/Report. The majority of proposed forms revisions are currently targeted for \nimplementation in the Plan Year 2019 Form 5500 Annual Return/Report. Development of EFAST changes pursuant \nto a new contract could begin in spring 2018, with processing under the new contract starting on January 1, 2020. \nHowever, this planned implementation timeline may be impacted if there are modifications to the recompete \ncontract acquisition plan. As a result, some forms revisions may be implemented in earlier or later form years, \nincluding but not limited to the IRS and PBGC changes for 2016 as shown in the proposed data elements in \nAppendix A. To the extent changes are made separately from a more general implementation of the proposed \nrevisions, the Agencies will seek appropriate clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) to \nimplement the changes in connection with any given year's forms. The Agencies expect that the EFAST2 \nrecompete would continue to deliver a user-friendly Web site, filing applications and web services, and contact \ncenter services similar to what is currently being provided. The existing EFAST2 web-based filing search application \nis expected to be enhanced and provided by EBSA. The Agencies expect that EFAST2 would continue to have the \nsame or improved functionality and web services and is expected primarily to rely on existing EFAST2 software, \ncomponents and logic. EFAST2 would continue to include a user-friendly web portal that provides registration, filing \nsubmission, filing acceptance, filing data dissemination, and help desk services. As part of the comprehensive \nreview of how well the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report serves to implement the existing employee benefit plan \nfiling requirements under Titles I and IV of ERISA and under the Code, the Agencies have considered intervening \nchanges to the legal and regulatory environment for employee benefit plans, plan sponsors, plan service providers \nand others since the last major revision of the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report. This includes implementation of \nthe Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Public Law 111- 203, 124 Stat. 1376, (Jul. 21, \n2010); statutory changes to ERISA and the Code relating to defined benefit pension plans in the Moving Ahead for \n\n\n\nProgress in the 21st Century Act (MAP 21) (Pub. L. 112-141); the Cooperative and Small Employer Charity Pension \nFlexibility Act (CSEC Act) (Pub. L. 113-98); the Highway and Transportation Funding Act (HATFA) (Pub. L. 113-\n159); the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014, Division O of the Consolidated and Further Continuing \nAppropriations Act, 2015, (Pub. L. 113-235) (MPRA), and various regulatory actions adopted by the Agencies since \nthe last major changes to the forms and instructions, including the DOL's final regulations at 29 CFR 2550.404a-5, \n404c-5, and 408b-2. In addition, the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care \nAct) \\6\\ expanded DOL's already growing oversight responsibilities with respect to the provision of group health \nbenefits to workers in private sector employer-sponsored plans that provide group health benefits (also referred to \nherein as ``group health plans''). In that regard, [[Page 47536]] the DOL has re-evaluated the existing reporting \nscheme for group health plans, which scheme was established well before the enactment of the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act of 1996, Public Law 104-191, 110 Stat. 1936 (Aug. 21, 1996); Title I of the Genetic \nInformation Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, Public Law 110-233, 122 Stat. 881 (May 21, 2008); the Mental Health \nParity Act of 1996, Public Law 104-204, 110 Stat. 2944 (Sept. 26, 1996) and the Mental Health Parity and Addiction \nEquity Act of 2008, Public Law 110-343, 122 Stat. 3881 (Oct. 3, 2008); the Newborns' and Mothers' Health \nProtection Act of 1996, Public Law 104-204, 110 Stat. 2935 (Sept. 26, 1996); the Women's Health and Cancer \nRights Act of 1998, Public Law 105-277, 112 Stat. 2681-436 (Oct. 21, 1998); and Michelle's Law, Public Law 110-\n381, 122 Stat. 4081 (Oct. 9, 2008), as well as the Affordable Care Act. -----------------------------------------------------------\n---------------- \\6\\ The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public Law 111-148, was enacted on March 23, \n2010, and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, Public Law 111-152, was enacted on March \n30, 2010. These statutes generally are collectively known as the ``Affordable Care Act.'' ------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------- After reviewing the existing reporting scheme and the DOL's experience with \noversight and enforcement, the DOL determined that, in order for it to more effectively fulfill its responsibilities under \nthe expanded requirements under these laws, all plans that provide group health benefits should be subject to \nsome level of annual reporting, with a focus on compliance issues. As described in more detail below, under the \nproposal, those plans that provide group health benefits that are already required to file a Form 5500 Annual \nReturn/Report-- generally all large plans and small plans that are funded with a trust or that are otherwise not \neligible for the annual reporting relief for unfunded and insured plans--would have to file group health plan \ninformation on a new separate schedule (Schedule J (Group Health Plan Information)), as well as complete those \nelements of the Form 5500 and schedules that those plans are already required to complete, as modified by this \nproposal. Plans that provide group health benefits that have fewer than 100 participants currently exempt from filing \nan annual report under 29 CFR 2520.104-20 because they are either completely ``unfunded'' or partially insured \nand partially unfunded now would be required to file a Form 5500 (except for those questions applicable only to \npension plans) and the new Schedule J. Under the proposal, plans that provide group health benefits that have \nfewer than 100 participants that currently are exempt from annual reporting under 29 CFR 2520.104-20 because \nthey are fully insured would be required to file with answers to certain questions on the Form 5500 and the \nSchedule J. Certain information collection requirements imposed under the Code, but not required under ERISA, \nhad to be removed from the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report when DOL implemented its EFAST2 electronic filing \nrequirement beginning with the 2009 Form 5500 Annual Return/Report. The Code did not permit the IRS to \nmandate electronic filing of ``IRS- only'' components of the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report with respect to filers of \nfewer than 250 returns, and regulations did not mandate such electronic filing with respect to any filers. Specifically, \nSchedules E, P, SSA, and T were not included in the 2009 Form 5500 Annual Return/ Report. Some of those \ninformation collection requirements can now be added back to the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report. On \nSeptember 29, 2014, the Treasury Department issued final regulations under Code sections 6058 and 6059 \nmandating electronic filing of the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report (including actuarial schedules) for certain filers. \nT.D. 9695, 79 FR 58256 (Sept. 29, 2014). In general, 26 CFR 301.6058-2 provides that, in order to satisfy the filing \nrequirements of Code section 6058, a Form 5500 Annual Return/Report must be filed electronically if the filer is \nrequired to file at least 250 returns of any type during the calendar year that includes the first day of the applicable \nplan year. Similarly, 26 CFR 301.6059-2 provides in general that, in order to satisfy the filing requirements of Code \nsection 6059, actuarial reports filed with a Form 5500 Annual Return/Report must be filed electronically by filers \nrequired to file at least 250 returns during that calendar year. The regulations are generally effective for plan years \nbeginning on or after January 1, 2015, but only for filings with a filing deadline (not taking into account filing \nextensions) after December 31, 2015. Finally, the Agencies took into account recommendations in reports from the \nGovernment Accountability Office (GAO), the DOL's Office of Inspector General (DOL-OIG), the United States \n\n\n\nTreasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), and the ERISA Advisory Council that have been issued \nsince the last major revision of the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report information collection requirements in \nconnection with the 2009 return/report.

The DOL also is publishing elsewhere in today's Federal \nRegister a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking with proposed amendments to the annual reporting regulations at Part \n2520 of Chapter XXV of Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations to implement certain proposed Form 5500 \nAnnual Return/Report changes under Title I of ERISA. To avoid unnecessary duplication of effort, public comments \nsubmitted in response to this Notice of Proposed Forms Revisions will be treated as public comments on the Notice \nof Proposed Rulemaking to the extent they include information relevant to the proposed regulatory amendments. \nAlthough the Agencies' historical practice of undertaking major updates of the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report \ngenerally has coincided with the move to and upgrades of the EFAST processing system, the Agencies also \nengage in an annual update process of the forms, schedules, and instructions. Some annual changes that are \nanticipated to be implemented by the IRS and the PBGC in connection with the 2016 plan year forms are discussed \nbelow. Those changes and other annual updates have involved, or may in the future involve, separate public notice \nand comment processes, for example, under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). The Agencies intend that any \nannual update changes adopted during the pendency of the changes proposed in this Notice will be incorporated \ninto what is published as part of the Notice of Final Forms Revisions as part of this process.\\7\\ ----------------------------\n----------------------------------------------- \\7\\ Minor changes not requiring notice and comment rulemaking or system \nchanges or changes required by enactment of new laws may also be made between the publication of the Notice of \nFinal Forms Revisions and the date when the revised forms, schedules, and instructions are available for e-filing \nthrough EFAST2. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As with previous major forms revisions \ncycles, the Agencies anticipate actively engaging in outreach and education regarding the forms revisions well in \n\nhttp://www.gao.gov/assets/300/298052.pdf);\nhttp://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14-441);\nhttp://www.dol.gov/ebsa/publications/2013ACreport2.html);\nhttp://www.oig.dol.gov/public/reports/oa/2014/05-14-003-12-121.pdf);\nhttp://www.gao.gov/assets/660/659211.pdf);\nhttp://www.gao.gov/assets/660/659211.pdf);\nhttp://www.oig.dol.gov/public/reports/oa/2013/09-13-001-12-121.pdf);\nhttp://www.gao.gov/assets/650/648285.pdf);\nhttp://www.oig.dol.gov/public/reports/oa/2012/09-12-002-12-121.pdf);\nhttp://www.oig.dol.gov/public/reports/oa/2012/09-12-002-12-121.pdf);\nhttp://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-12-325);\nhttp://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-08-692);\nhttp://www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2011reports/\nhttp://www.dol.gov/ebsa/publications/2011ACreport3.html);\nhttp://www.dol.gov/ebsa/publications/2013ACreport3.html#2);\nhttp://www.dol.gov/ebsa/publications/2010ACreport2.html);\nhttp://www.dol.gov/ebsa/publications/2008ACreport1.html\n\n\nadvance of the plan year for which the majority of the revisions would be effective. II. Appendices A. Data Elements \nfor Forms and Schedules Appendix A shows the questions/data elements that are on each form and schedule in the \nline-by-line sequence the items would appear on that form and schedule, as well as newly ``structured'' \nattachments, rather than showing mock-ups of ``final'' forms, schedules, and structured attachments. The Agencies \nexpect that the final forms and schedules will have substantially the same format as the existing forms and \nschedules.\\8\\ The lists of data elements for each individual form, schedule, and ``structured'' attachment to the \nSchedule H, show all of the questions that would appear on that form, schedule, or attachment-- current questions, \nrenumbered questions, revised questions, and new questions. The data elements are numbered in the sequence \nthat the Agencies would expect to use in the final version of the forms and schedules. Next to the data elements, \nthe Agencies have, to the extent feasible, indicated in brackets: --------------------------------------------------------------------\n------- \\8\\ The Agencies intend to publish mock-ups of the forms on the DOL's Web site as part of the third party \nsoftware developer certification process and in furtherance of public education efforts about the changes to be \nimplemented. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) ``[Current]'' if it is the same question with \nthe same line number on both the proposal and the current form or schedule; \\9\\ ``[Current (2016)]'' indicates IRS \nchanges and/or PBGC changes that would first be made part of the forms and schedules for the 2016 form year, \nrespectively. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\9\\ The Agencies used the 2015 forms, \nschedules, and instructions as the ``current'' form version. With respect to IRS- only changes, the changes for 2016 \nthat appear in the notice published by the IRS under the PRA, 81 FR 18687 (Mar. 31, 2016), are used in the \nproposed data elements and instructions and are so labeled, instead of showing the changes in the information \ncollection under the Code that appear on the 2015 Form 5500 series, which the IRS has directed filers not to \nanswer.

Proposed Instructions for Form 5500-SF Appendix C to this document shows the \nproposed instructions for the Form 5500-SF. III. Request for Comments The Agencies believe that the \nmodernization and restructuring of the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report being proposed in this Notice would \nsupport the Agencies' ability to implement strong and effective enforcement programs and better respond to \ninquiries from plan participants and beneficiaries, employers, other plan sponsors, and the public regarding \nemployee benefit plans. Further, the Agencies believe that the proposed revisions would help them more effectively \ndevelop and implement regulations and other compliance assistance guidance, and use data for purposes of \neconomic research, policy formulation, and monitoring benefits related developments and activities among ERISA- \ncovered employee benefit plans. The Agencies generally invite comments and suggestions as to other alternative \nsolutions and whether and how such alternatives would be more, or less, beneficial compared to the proposed \nchanges to the forms, schedules, and instructions. Commenters are asked to take into account the costs and \nburdens to plans, participants and beneficiaries, plan fiduciaries, plan service providers, and other affected parties, \nin commenting on the proposed annual reporting changes, including any suggested alternatives. The request for \ncomments includes areas on the existing forms, schedules, and instructions that the Agencies have not proposed \nchanging, but which may benefit from further guidance, especially with regard to how an existing provision or \ninstruction would apply for a particular segment of the filing population. IV. Discussion of Proposed Changes The \nproposed revisions in this Notice reflect priorities of and efforts by the DOL, IRS, and PBGC to improve reporting for \nfilers and the public, other governmental users, as well as the Agencies by: (1) Modernizing financial information \nfiled regarding plans; (2) updating fee and expense information on plan service providers, with a focus on \nharmonizing annual reporting requirements with the DOL's final disclosure requirements at 29 CFR 2550.408b-2; \n(3) enhancing mineability of data filed on annual return/reports; (4) requiring reporting by all group health plans \ncovered by Title I of ERISA, including adding a new Schedule J (Group Health Plan Information); and (5) improving \ncompliance under ERISA and the Code through selected new questions regarding plan operations, service provider \nrelationships, and financial management of the plan. The changes in this proposal to the forms, schedules, \ninstructions, and DOL regulatory exemptions and requirements are intended to further these objectives. A. \nModernize Financial and Plan Operations Information An overriding objective of these proposed forms revisions is \nto modernize the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report financial information collection so that the presentation of plan \ntrust financial and balance sheet information better reflects the investment portfolios and asset management \npractices of employee benefit plans. The basic objective of general purpose financial reporting is to provide \ninformation about the reporting entity for the Agencies' enforcement, research, and policy formulation programs; to \nassist other federal agencies, Congress, and the private sector in assessing employee benefit, tax, and economic \ntrends and policies; and to assist plan participants and beneficiaries and the general public in better monitoring the \nactivities and investments of employee benefit plans. The financial statements contained in the current Schedule H \n(Large Plan Financial Information) and Schedule I (Small Plan Financial Information) are based on data elements \nthat have remained largely unchanged since the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report was established in 1975. Over \nthe past four decades, the U.S. private pension system has shifted from defined benefit (DB) pension plans toward \ndefined contribution (DC) pension plans, often participant-directed 401(k)-type DC pension plans. The financing of \nretirement benefits has changed dramatically coincident with the shift from DB to DC pension plans. In 1978, when \nlegislation was enacted authorizing 401(k) plans that allow employees to contribute to their own retirement plan on \na pre-tax basis, participants contributed only 29 percent of the contributions to DC pension plans and only 11 \npercent of total contributions to both DB and DC pension plans. ``In the years following 1978, employee \ncontributions to DC pension plans steadily rose to a peak of approximately 60 percent in 1999, where it has \nremained.'' See Dep't of Labor, Private Pension Plan Bulletin Abstract of 2012 Form 5500 Annual Reports, at 1 \n(2015). Simultaneously, the number of single-employer DB pension plans has decreased from 92,000 in 1990 to \njust under 29,000 single-employer pension plans in 2009. See U.S. Gov't Accountability Office, GAO-09-291, \nDefined Benefit Pensions: Survey Results of the Nation's Largest Private Defined Benefit Plan Sponsors Highlights \n(2009) (available at            http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09291.pdf). The shift from DB pension plans to DC \npension plans has led to increased responsibility for participants to manage their own retirement savings, which \nincludes having to select among investment options in their retirement plans. See Private Pension Plan Bulletin \nAbstract Of 2012 Form 5500 Annual Reports, at 2 (Of the 516,000 section 401(k)-type plans in 2012, 87.8 percent \nallowed participants to direct investment of all of their assets, and 3.1 percent allowed participants to direct \ninvestment of a portion of their assets.) The need for more relevant and comparable financial information is not \nlimited to 401(k) and other DC pension plans; it also extends to DB pension plans. Reports from GAO, the DOL-\n\nhttp://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09291.pdf\n\n\nOIG, the ERISA Advisory Council, and the TIGTA also have focused on the need for increased transparency and \naccountability generally in connection with employee benefit plan investments in hard-to-value and alternative \nassets, as well as assets held through pooled investment vehicles. 1. Changes to Schedule H (Financial \nInformation)--Balance Sheet and Income Statement Section 103 of ERISA requires plans to include in their annual \nreport a statement of assets and liabilities of the plan, aggregated by categories and [[Page 47539]] reported at \ncurrent value. It also requires plans to report a statement of earnings (losses) and expenses. Although the Form \n5500 Annual Return/Report has undergone major revisions since its initial implementation in 1975, there has been \nlittle change to the basic balance sheet and income statement information on the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report \nsince the return/report was first established. Under the proposal, Schedule H, Parts I and II, would retain the \nessential asset/ liability and income/expense structure of the current reporting requirement. The Agencies are \nproposing, however, to modify the asset breakouts on the balance sheet component of the Schedule H to enable \nmore accurate and detailed reporting on the types of assets held by a plan, including alternative investments, hard-\nto-value assets, and investments through collective investment vehicles. The proposed changes take into account \nthe fact that many of these more sophisticated and complex investments do not fit neatly into any of the existing \nreporting categories. As a result, filers inconsistently report on the various existing categories, and important \nfinancial information is obscured by consolidation of many diverse investments into the catch-all ``other'' category \non the balance sheet on the Schedule H. The proposal would also update the income/expense statement of the \nSchedule H to get a better picture of earnings and expenses associated with plan investments and operations. In \naddition to the Agencies' assessment that Form 5500 Annual Return/Report financial reporting would benefit from \nimproved transparency and accountability, the proposal to change the asset categories on the Schedule H balance \nsheet is supported by recent reports from both the GAO and the DOL-OIG. The GAO has noted that the plan asset \ncategories on the Schedule H are not representative of current plan investments and provide little insight into the \ninvestments themselves, the level of associated risk, or the structures of these investments. GAO-14-441, Private \nPensions: Targeted Revisions Could Improve Usefulness of Form 5500 Information, at 11-12. The proposed \nchanges to the Schedule H also are consistent with the DOL-OIG recommendation that the Form 5500 Annual \nReturn/Report be revised to improve reporting of hard-to-value and alternative investments. U.S. Dep't of Labor \nOffice of Inspector Gen., 09-13-001-12-121, Employee Benefits Security Administration Needs to Provide Additional \nGuidance And Oversight to ERISA Plans Holding Hard-To-Value Alternative Investments, at 4, 19. Accordingly, the \nAgencies are proposing the following changes to the Schedule H balance sheet and income statement. Current \nLine 1a, ``total noninterest bearing cash,'' would be reported as a breakout element under General Investments. \nThis would also result in Line 1b ``Receivables'' and Line 1c ``General Investments'' being renumbered as Lines 1a \nand 1b respectively. Participant loans would continue to be reported as a separate line item, but would be reported \nas a breakout element under renumbered Line 1a as a ``receivable'' rather than under its current reporting \nclassification under the heading ``General Investments.'' This change is responsive to amendments made to \n``Generally Accepted Accounting Principles'' (GAAP) by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which \nrequired participant loans to be classified as notes receivable from participants. See Financial Accounting \nStandards Board, No. 2010-25, Plan Accounting--Defined Contribution Pension Plans (Topic 962) (2010). As notes \nreceivable, participant loans would continue to be reported at their unpaid principal balance plus any accrued but \nunpaid interest. Under proposed Line 1b (currently Line 1c) ``General Investments,'' the Agencies would add both \nnew categories and new breakouts within existing categories. Cash and cash equivalents would be the first \ncategory under ``General Investments.'' As indicated above, ``noninterest bearing cash (such as cash on hand or \ncash in a non- interest bearing checking account)'' would no longer be separated from ``General Investments.'' \nInstead it would be a sub-breakout under ``cash and cash equivalents.'' The category would also have sub- \nbreakouts for interest bearing cash (assets that earn interest in a financial institution account such as interest \nbearing checking accounts, passbook savings accounts, or money market bank deposit accounts). While the \nbreakouts are new, the information is already required to be reported on current Line 1c(1). The next category \nunder ``General Investments,'' would continue to be for reporting ``Debt Interests/Obligations.'' The Form 5500 \nAnnual Return/Report currently provides little in the way of detail or transparency about the range of plan \ninvestments in bonds, loans, and other debt instruments and obligations. For example, a single line item for ``other \nloans'' on the Schedule H currently covers, as indicated in the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report instructions, the \nvalue of loans for construction, securities loans, commercial and/or residential mortgage loans that are not subject \nto Code section 72(p), and other miscellaneous loans. See, e.g., 2015, Schedule H, Form 5500 Annual \nReturn/Report Instructions. The general debt heading, as proposed, would keep the existing breakout for corporate \n\n\n\ndebt instruments. Breakouts under that category, however, would be investment grade debt and high-yield debt, \nrather than ``preferred'' and ``all other,'' as on the current Schedule H. This change is intended to have the \nSchedule H financial information for all reporting plans regarding corporate debt instruments correspond to the \nmore detailed financial information on Schedule R for defined benefit pension plans that have 1,000 participants or \nmore. In addition, U.S. government securities would be broken out from other government securities. The \ninstructions for the current forms advise filers to report such investments on the Schedule H financial statements in \n``Other'' debt instruments. This proposal, however, includes more investment categories on the Schedule H to \nimprove transparency from the current ``other'' categories. For example, there would be a breakout for other loans \n(other than loans to participants), exchange traded notes, and asset backed securities (other than real estate),\\10\\ \nand debt obligations associated with real property would be reported under the real property category, rather than \ngenerally under ``Other Debt Obligations.'' Thus, with respect to reporting such leveraged or collateralized \ntransactions on the balance sheet portion of Schedule H, filers would be advised in the instructions to account for \nsuch transactions in the appropriate asset category in accordance with the individual characteristics of the \ninvestment. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\10\\ The SEC similarly is working towards \nmore transparency with regard to some of these assets. See Securities and Exchange Commission, Asset-backed \nSecurities Disclosure and Registration, 79 FR 57,184 (Sept. 24, 2014). FINRA has also published an Investor Alert \nrelated on exchange traded notes to increase investor awareness of the associated risks. See Exchange-Traded \nNotes: Avoid Unpleasant Surprises, FINRA,            \nwww.finra.org/Investors/ProtectYourself/InvestorAlerts/TradingSecurities/P131262. See also U.S. Gov't \nAccountability Office, GAO-12-324, Recent Developments Highlight Challenged Of Hedge Fund And Private Equity \nInvesting (2012) (discussing plan investment in distressed debt). -------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------- The next category under ``General Investments'' would continue to be ``Corporate Stocks.'' Under the \ncorporate securities category, filers would still distinguish between ``preferred'' and [[Page 47540]] ``common'' stock \nfor reporting direct holdings of corporate securities. There would be new breakouts, however, for ``publicly traded'' \nand ``non-publicly traded'' securities under both the ``preferred'' and ``common'' stock elements. This proposed \nchange is intended to present a more complete picture of plan investments in hard-to-value assets. The existing \nreporting line items for certain collective investment vehicles that are treated as holding plan assets under the \nDOL's plan asset regulation at 29 CFR 2510.3-101 (i.e., bank common or collective trusts (CCTs), insurance \ncompany pooled separate accounts (PSAs), entities meeting the conditions of DOL regulation 29 CFR 2510.103-12 \n(103-12 IEs), and master trusts) generally would be retained, but grouped together for reporting under a new \ncategory entitled ``Eligible Pooled Investment Funds (Other Than Registered Investment Companies).'' To increase \ntransparency and improve the quality of data collected across various components of the Form 5500 Annual \nReturn/Report, the proposal would significantly reconfigure existing reporting of assets held through the various \ntypes of pooled investment vehicles that have plan assets. Under the proposal, a plan's investments in CCTs and \nPSAs would be reported in the aggregate on single line items for each vehicle type on the Schedule H Line 1b \nbalance sheet information regardless of whether the CCT or PSA files a Form 5500 Annual Return/Report as a \nDFE. This is a change from the current rule that has filers break out the underlying assets in the respective line \nitems on the Schedule H balance sheet under ``general investments'' if the CCT or PSA has not filed a Form 5500 \nAnnual Return/Report and in the aggregate on the CCT or PSA line if the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report has \nbeen filed. Instead, as discussed in more detail below, the Line 4i(1) Schedule of Assets held for Investment of \neither the plan or the CCT or PSA, depending on whether the CCT or PSA has filed, would be where the breakout \nof underlying assets would be reported. With respect to 103-12 IE reporting on Schedule H, the proposal generally \ncontinues the existing reporting requirements. Specifically, similar to the requirements for plans that invest in CCTs \nand PSAs, a plan that invests in an entity that files as a 103-12 IE would, in identifying each individual 103-12 IE on \nthe Line 4i Schedules of Assets, have to include the value of the plan's investment in each 103- 12 IE. Reporting \nregarding investments in master trusts by plans and reporting by master trusts, as described in more detail below, \nwould be substantially revised, including reporting on the plan's asset and liability statements on Schedule H, Part I. \nSpecifically, as they did prior to 1999, plans would report their total holdings in master trusts on Schedule H, Line \n1b, on an aggregate basis, and the reporting concept of the master trust investment account (MTIA) would be \neliminated. The participating plans' fractional interest in the various holdings of the master trust (which currently are \nreflected in the MTIA Form 5500 Annual Return/Report) now would be shown on the various plans' Schedule H, \nLine 4i(1) Schedule of Assets Held for Investment at End of Year and Line 4i(2) Schedule of Assets Disposed of \nDuring the Plan Year, as well as on the filings by the master trust itself. The DOL views the proposed changes to \n\nhttp://www.finra.org/Investors/ProtectYourself/InvestorAlerts/TradingSecurities/P131262\n\n\nannual reporting regarding these pooled investment vehicles as important and necessary in light of the large \namount of plan assets (an estimated $1.1 trillion) held by CCTs, PSAs, master trusts, and 103-12 IEs. See U.S. \nGov't Accountability Office, GAO 12-121, Limited Scope Audits Provide Inadequate Protections To Retirement Plan \nParticipants, at 1 (2014). As part of the focus on better reflecting and understanding how plans are investing, the \nAgencies also propose to replace the single line existing category entitled ``Value of Interest in Funds Held in \nInsurance General Accounts (Unallocated Contracts)'' by adding breakouts of various types of unallocated \ncontracts. The proposal would add to the existing general category breakouts for deposit administration, immediate \nparticipation guarantees, guaranteed investment contracts, and ``other'' unallocated insurance contracts. These \nclasses of contracts parallel the existing Schedule A reporting on insurance contracts with unallocated funds. \nComments are specifically solicited on whether this breakout is sufficient or whether the value of investments in \nother or additional classes of insurance contracts, such as variable annuity contracts,\\11\\ should be listed on the \nSchedule H. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\11\\ As discussed below, the proposal would \nadd new questions to Schedule A regarding variable annuities. ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n------ The Agencies are also proposing changes to the existing category entitled, ``Partnership/Joint Venture \nInterests.'' To clarify the reporting of these general partnership and joint venture investments, new sub-categories \nare being added to report the value of interest in ``limited partnerships,'' ``venture capital operating companies \n(VCOCs),'' ``private equity,'' ``hedge funds,'' and ``other partnership/joint venture interests.'' The Agencies' proposal \nwas informed by the GAO's findings that there was a need for more detail on plan investment in hedge funds and \nprivate equity funds due to substantial increases in the percentage of plans investing in hedge funds and private \nequity. U.S. Gov't Accountability Office, GAO-12-324, Recent Developments Highlight Challenges With Hedge \nFund And Private Equity Investing, at 19 (2012). In making this recommendation, GAO acknowledged that although \nthere is no universally accepted definition, the term ``hedge fund'' is commonly used to describe pooled investment \nvehicles that are privately organized and administered by professional managers who engage in active trading of \nvarious types of securities, commodity futures, options contracts, and other investment vehicles, including relatively \nilliquid and hard-to-value investments. Similarly, ``private equity fund'' is commonly used to describe privately \nmanaged pools of capital that invest in companies that typically are not listed on a stock exchange. See, e.g., 2011 \nERISA Advisory Council Report: Hedge Funds and Private Equity Investments (noting that plan sponsors have \nincreased investment of defined benefit pension plan assets in hedge funds and/or private equity funds due to the \nneed to increase diversification, decrease volatility, and enhance the plan's overall performance). The Agencies \nspecifically invite comments on whether these definitions are adequate for purposes of Form 5500 Annual Return/ \nReport financial reporting. In addition, because investments in the ``Partnership/Joint venture interests'' may or may \nnot be holding plan assets under the DOL's plan asset regulation at 29 CFR 2510.3-101, the Agencies are \nproposing an off-balance sheet item in this category where filers would indicate the total value of such investments \nthat are plan asset vehicles and those that are not. The real estate category on the Schedule H balance sheet \nwould be expanded and include sub-categories to include investments in particular types of assets or pooled \ninvestment funds designed to invest primarily in real estate or real estate mortgages. In the Agencies' view, the \ncurrent reporting requirements do not accurately reveal the extent and type of a plan's real estate and related \nholdings. The [[Page 47541]] proposed new breakouts are: Developed real property (other than employer real \nproperty), undeveloped real property (other than employer real property), real estate investment trusts (REITs), \nmortgage-backed securities (including collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs)), real estate operating \ncompanies (REOCs), and ``Other'' real estate related investments. Adding these breakouts is consistent with the \nAgencies' objective of improving reporting on investments that constitute alternative or hard-to-value assets. See \nOECD/IOPS Good Practices on Pension Funds' Use of Alternative Investments and Derivatives, OECD, (available \nat            http://www.oecd.org/finance/private-\npensions/oecdiopsgoodpracticesonpensionfundsuseofalternativeinvestmentsandderivatives.htm.) Creating more \nspecific categories also should help address concerns about inconsistencies in real property reporting cited by the \nreport, GAO Targeted Revisions Could Improve Usefulness Of Form 5500 Information, at 10. A significant new \nreporting category is for investments in derivatives. The sub-categories in the derivatives category would be futures, \nforwards, options, swaps, and ``Other.'' As in the other general categories, filers would enter a description for \nassets listed as ``Other.'' Obtaining more specific information about the extent to which plans are engaged in \nhedging or in the listed types of derivative transactions would help address concerns raised by the GAO about \nlimitations on usefulness of data on investments in derivatives under the current reporting structure. See generally \nU.S. Gov't Accountability Office, GAO-08-692, Defined Benefit Plans: Guidance Needed To Better Inform Plans Of \n\nhttp://www.oecd.org/finance/private-pensions/oecdiopsgoodpracticesonpensionfundsuseofalternativeinvestmentsandderivatives.htm\nhttp://www.oecd.org/finance/private-pensions/oecdiopsgoodpracticesonpensionfundsuseofalternativeinvestmentsandderivatives.htm\n\n\nThe Challenges And Risks Of Investing In Hedge Funds And Private Equity, at 25, 42-43 (expressing specific \nconcerns about the way in which pension plans report investments in derivatives and suggesting that plan sponsors \nare currently reporting these types of investments in various different categories on the Schedule H, limiting the \nusefulness of the data.) The Agencies are also proposing a new category for foreign investments with breakouts to \nseparately report holdings of foreign equities and debt interests. The Agencies propose that, for this reporting \npurpose, foreign equities would include American Depository Receipts, U.S.-traded foreign stocks and stocks \ntraded on foreign markets. Foreign debt would include both long-term and short-term foreign debt investments, but \nwould not include for purposes of a Form 5500 Annual Return/Report such foreign securities held through U.S. \nregistered investment funds or exchange traded funds, CCTs, PSAs, 103- 12 IEs, or master trusts. There also \nwould be subcategories for foreign real estate, currency, and ``Other,'' with a description required for anything \nreported in the ``Other'' category. The Agencies also are proposing a new asset category on the Schedule H, \n``Tangible Personal Property,'' which category currently appears on the Schedule I, but not on the Schedule H. \nUnder the proposal, the Schedule H would list on its face the main types of assets as reportable in this category, i.e. \ndirect investments in tangible personal property, with sub-categories for collectibles, precious metals, and ``Other.'' \nThere would also be a separate breakout category for commodities, which would be divided into ``Precious Metals'' \nand ``Other.'' Moving this category from the Schedule I to the Schedule H for all filers required to complete the \nSchedule H, including former Schedule I filers, would add transparency to these plan investment holdings. To the \nextent plans have direct investments in tangible personal property and commodities (as opposed to futures \ncontracts or exchange traded funds), they are likely to be reported unhelpfully from a transparency perspective as \n``Other'' on the existing Schedule H. Finally, the Agencies propose making reporting more transparent for assets \nheld through participant-directed brokerage accounts. The proposal generally follows the same breakout \nrequirements as the current rules. The current rules provide that assets held through participant-directed brokerage \naccounts may be reported either: (1) As individual investments in the applicable asset and liability categories in Part \nI and the income and expense categories in Part II, or (2) by including on the ``Other'' lines (Line 1c(15) on the \nbalance sheet and 2c on the income statement) the total aggregate value of the assets and the total aggregate \ninvestment income (loss) before expenses, provided the assets are not loans, partnership or joint venture interests, \nreal property, employer securities, or investments, including derivatives, that could result in a loss in excess of the \naccount balance of the participant or beneficiary who directed the transaction. Under the proposal, filers would \nprovide the total current value of all assets held through participant-directed brokerage accounts, except there \nwould be separate sub-totals for brokerage account investments in tangible personal property, loans, partnership or \njoint venture interests, real property, employer securities, and investments that could result in a loss in excess of the \naccount balance of the participant or beneficiary who directed the transaction. The current Form 5500 Annual \nReturn/Report reporting rules already require that these types of assets be reported separately from other \nparticipant- directed brokerage account assets, similar to the reporting rules for investments in CCTs and PSAs that \ndo not file their own Form 5500 Annual Return/Report. On the proposed Line 4i Schedules of Assets, assets held \nthrough a participant-directed brokerage account would be permitted to be reported in the aggregate as a single \nasset held directly by the plan. The broker would be identified as the issuer/ borrower/etc. In the element requiring \nthe filer to indicate on what line the assets were reported on Line 1b, the filer would enter all the subcategories for \ntypes of investments held through a participant- directed brokerage account. The Agencies considered requiring \nfilers to break out all assets held through a participant-directed brokerage account on the Line 4i Schedules of \nAssets. The Agencies also considered continuing to require filers to break out those specific assets that are \ncurrently required to be broken out on Line 1c. For example, the Agencies considered requiring a breakout of \ninformation on whether participants are investing in alternative and hard-to-value assets through participant- \ndirected brokerage accounts. The Agencies determined, on balance, considering the benefits to the information and \nthe relative potential burden, that having on the proposed balance sheet (Line 1b) a general breakout of asset types \nheld through participant-directed brokerage accounts would be sufficient, and that details of each individual asset \nso held would not be required. The proposal to continue to allow filers to report assets held in participant-directed \nbrokerage accounts in the aggregate is intended to be responsive to comments on the DOL's Request for \nInformation, Question 38, 79 FR 49469, 49473 (Aug. 14, 2014) (RFI), which specifically asked whether changes \nshould be made to the Schedule H to require more detail about investments made through brokerage windows. \nWhile some commenters on the RFI thought it made sense for the DOL to consider changes to the Form 5500 \nAnnual Return/Report with respect to brokerage windows, others were concerned about the burden and costs such \nchanges would impose on sponsors and participants and were unclear about the relative benefit of [[Page 47542]] \n\n\n\nmore information. The Agencies do not believe that there would be a substantial additional burden imposed by \nrequiring aggregate participant-directed brokerage account assets to be reported separately instead of the current \npractice of reporting such assets in the catch- all ``Other'' category. Similarly, the Agencies believe that there would \nnot be a substantial burden change in the proposed requirement to break out, on the Line 4i Schedules of Assets, \nthe types of investments held in participant-directed brokerage accounts that are not eligible for aggregated \nreporting under current annual reporting rules. One of the goals of the proposed change is to get better information \non securities lending \\12\\ practices and how they impact plan finances and operations. As indicated in the Financial \nStability Oversight Council's (FSOC) Annual Report for 2014 (available at            \nhttp://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Documents/FSOC%202014%20Annual%20Report.pdf), the global value of \nsecurities loans was approximately $1.8 trillion in 2013. Pension plans are a large segment of the entities engaged \nin such transactions. Accordingly, the Agencies believe that more precise information is needed to understand how \nthese transactions impact plans and how plans fit into the overall markets. The Agencies explored adding new \nbreakout line items on the asset/liability and income expense statements to identify in more detail securities lending \ntransactions. It is the understanding of the Agencies, however, that filers are reporting securities lending \narrangements and similar transactions on the financial statements in various different ways, depending on whether \nthe plan is borrowing or lending securities and the structure of the arrangement or transaction, including \ntransactions such as repurchase agreements and sell/buy-back transactions where, technically, the plan no longer \nowns the securities. Accordingly, the Agencies believe that the best way to get information on securities financing \ntransactions, without creating particularized line items that might not work for all types of transactions, is to instruct \nfilers to report assets in the appropriate categories on the Schedule H and then identify the transactions in response \nto the newly proposed compliance questions. The new compliance question would ask whether the plan has \ninvestment acquisitions that are leveraged, including assets subject to collateralized lending activities (e.g., \nsecurities lending arrangements, repurchase agreements (repos), etc.). If ``Yes,'' the plan would be required to \nidentify whether the plan engaged in securities lending arrangements, including repurchase agreements or sell/buy-\nbacks, or other transactions that subjected plan assets to a mortgage, lien, or other security interest, and to \ndescribe the arrangement. The plan would then have to report, as a total, the amount of cash obligated in \nconnection with collateralized lending activities at end of year, the value of securities obligated in connection with \ncollateralized lending activities at end of year, the value of other assets obligated in connection with collateralized \nlending activities at end of year, and the approximate ratio of collateralized/leveraged investments to total plan \nassets at end of year. The Agencies specifically request comments on whether there could be effective breakout \nline items on the balance sheet that would more clearly show assets that are subject to securities lending or similar \narrangements or whether there are specific instructions that would be helpful for filers to know where to categorize \nthe various components of such transactions on both the balance sheet and earnings statements on the Schedule \nH. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\12\\ The term ``securities loans'' generally refers to the \ncollateralized loan of a security from one party to another. Such a loan can have a pre-specified term, such as one \nbusiness day, one week, or one month, or it can be ``open.'' An open loan is ongoing until one of the parties to the \ntrade decides to end it. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Under the ``Income and Expense'' \nstatement in Part II of the Schedule H, the Agencies propose retaining the same basic structure for reporting \nincome as on the current Schedule H, but with additional breakout categories. Notably, the ``interest'' income \ncategory includes a new breakout for government securities other than U.S. government securities, and the \nunrealized appreciation (depreciation) of assets category would be broken out to report separately partnership/joint \nventure interests, commodities investments, derivatives, employer securities, foreign investments (other than those \nheld through U.S. registered investment funds), and employer real property, in addition to the existing breakouts for \nreal estate, CCTs, PSAs, MTIAs, 103-12 IEs, and registered investment companies. These proposed changes are \nintended to better support investment monitoring by asset class and provide more consistent data for research and \npolicy purposes. The proposal would also add new breakout categories to the ``Administrative Expenses'' category \nof the Income and Expenses section of the balance sheet. The Agencies have determined that to get a better \npicture of plan expenses, particularly those related to service providers, more detail in this category is warranted. \nAccordingly, data elements would be added for ``Salaries and allowances,'' ``Independent Qualified Public \nAccountant (IQPA) Audit fees,'' ``Recordkeeping and Other Accounting Fees,'' ``Bank or Trust Company \nTrustee/Custodial Fees'' ``Actuarial fees'' ``Legal fees,'' ``Valuation/appraisal fees,'' and ``Trustee fees/expenses \n(including travel, seminars, meetings.'' \\13\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\13\\ Other than \nIQPA Audit Fees and Bank or Trust Company Trustee/Custodial Fees, these questions were on the Form 5500 \n\nhttp://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Documents/FSOC%202014%20Annual%20Report.pdf\n\n\nprior to 1999. See 1998 Form 5500, Line 32(g). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The \nAgencies are also proposing to change administrative expense reporting to identify when participant accounts are \ncharged directly. The Agencies believe that this information is important to better understand how compensation \narrangements impact participants, especially in defined contribution pension plans. The Agencies considered \nrequiring filers to break out direct expenses on a service provider by service provider basis on Schedule C to show \nhow and when they are charged to participant accounts rather than at the plan level. To minimize reporting burden \nunder the proposal, however, the information would be reported only in the aggregate. Therefore, instead of \nrequesting this information on the Schedule C, the Agencies have proposed revising the expense information on \nSchedule H. Specifically, the ``Total'' administrative expense line item on Schedule H would now require that \nadministrative expenses charged directly against participant accounts be separately reported from those direct \nexpenses charged to other plan asset sources. Filers would separate transaction- based charges to individual \nparticipant accounts and plan level expenses apportioned among participant accounts. With respect to the latter, \nfilers would indicate whether the expenses were apportioned per capita, pro rata by account balance, or ``Other'' \napportionment method that they would describe. This would give the Agencies and other users of the Form 5500 \nAnnual Return/Report data a better idea of how and when participants are being charged administrative expenses, \nwhich is particularly important for defined contribution pension plans. [[Page 47543]] 2. Proposed Changes to \nSchedule H, Line 4i Schedules of Assets As indicated above, the proposed modernization of the financial reporting \nrequired on the Schedule H would include structural, data element, and instruction changes to the Line 4i \nSchedules of Assets. The current Line 4i Schedules (``Schedule of Assets Held for Investment at End of Year'' and \n``Schedule of Assets Acquired and Disposed Within Year'') are required under section 103 of ERISA to be included \nin the annual report, as currently implemented in the DOL's regulations at 29 CFR 2520.103-11.\\14\\ These \nschedules are filed by plans required to file the Schedule H and by certain DFEs. The schedules are a central \nelement of the financial disclosure structure of ERISA because they are the only place in the Form 5500 Annual \nReturn/Report where plans are required to list individual plan investments, identified by major characteristics, such \nas issue, maturity date, rate of interest, cost, and current value. Accordingly, these schedules are the only part of \nthe Form 5500 Annual Return/Report that can be used to evaluate the year-to-year performance of a plan's \nindividual investments. The reported information, however, suffers from several shortcomings. ----------------------------\n----------------------------------------------- \\14\\ To see the proposed changes to the DOL's regulations to implement these \ndata element and instruction revisions, please see the DOL's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking--Annual Reporting, \npublished elsewhere today in the Federal Register. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nPerhaps most fundamentally, this information currently is not reported in a data-capturable format. Thus, although \nan image or picture of the attachments that are currently filed as non-standard attachments to filers' electronic Form \n5500 Annual Return/Report filings is available through the EFAST2 public disclosure function, it is not viewable as \npart of the Schedule H, nor is the information included in the data sets that DOL prepares from the return/report \nfiling data and publishes on its Web site (           www.dol.gov/ebsa/foia/foia-5500.html). Also, the Line 4i Schedules \nof Assets are not always found in the same place in each Form 5500 Annual Return/Report filing. For example, the \nLine 4i Schedules of Assets are often incorporated in the larger audit report of the plan's IQPA that itself is filed as a \nnonstandard attachment to the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report.\\15\\ The schedules also do not require \nstandardized methods for identifying and describing assets on the Line 4i Schedules of Assets. Under the current \nreporting rules, the same stock or mutual fund may be identified with various different names or by use of different \nabbreviations. The creation of more detailed and structured Line 4i Schedules of Assets is a specific \nrecommendation of both the DOL-OIG and the GAO. See DOL Inspector Gen. EBSA Needs To Provide Additional \nGuidance And Oversight To ERISA Plans Holding Hard-To-Value Alternative Investments, at 4-5; GAO Private \nPensions: Targeted Revisions Could Improve Usefulness of Form 5500 Information, at 37. ---------------------------------\n------------------------------------------ \\15\\ See EFAST2 FAQ 24a, (available at            www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq-\nEFAST2.html) (advising filers of options in EFAST2 for filing the accountant's opinion and accompanying financial \nstatements, indicating that they do not need to be ``tagged'' separately for filing purposes.) ---------------------------------\n------------------------------------------ The first proposed improvement would require filers to complete standardized Line \n4i Schedules of Assets in a data-capturable format. The Agencies anticipate that EFAST2 would have separate \n``structured'' locations for entering the data into the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report filing, using a standardized \nformat that would enable incorporation of the Line 4i Schedules of Assets information into the datasets that EFAST \nand EBSA make available from each year's Form 5500 Annual Return/ Report and Form 5500-SF filings and \nenable DOL to more readily disclose the information, as required under Title I of ERISA. As under the current \n\nhttp://www.dol.gov/ebsa/foia/foia-5500.html\nhttp://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq-EFAST2.html\nhttp://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq-EFAST2.html\n\n\nreporting structure, there would continue to be two separate schedules of assets.\\16\\ The first would be the existing \nSchedule of Assets Held for Investment at End of Year. The second would modify the existing ``Schedule of Assets \nAcquired and Disposed of Within Year'' to a ``Schedule of Assets Disposed of During the Plan Year.'' The objective \nof the current Schedule of Assets Acquired and Disposed of Within Year was to ensure that the Form 5500 Annual \nReturn/Report (which generally captures financial information at the beginning and the end of the plan year) \ncaptured information on assets that may not have been held either at the beginning of the year or end of year \nbecause they were bought and sold within the same year. That structure, however, suffers from a significant gap in \ninformation about alternative investments and hard-to-value assets because neither of the current Schedules of \nAssets provides information on the sale of such assets if purchased in one year and sold in the middle of a \nsubsequent year. The change in the Schedule of Assets Disposed of During the Plan Year to cover all investment \nassets disposed of during the plan year would close that gap, while continuing to capture transactions that involve \nthe purchase and sale of investment assets within the same plan year. -----------------------------------------------------------\n---------------- \\16\\ The current Line 4i question generally asks whether the plan held assets for investment, referring \nto both Schedules of Assets. Because all filers, except filers for terminated plans, answer ``Yes'' to indicate that \nthey have assets held at end of year, answers to the current question do not reveal whether the plan also had \nassets acquired and disposed of during the plan year. The proposal would separate the question into two parts: \nLine 4i(1) asking whether the plan held investments at the end of the year; and Line 4i(2) asking whether the plan \ndisposed of assets during the plan year. If the answer was ``Yes'' to either question, the corresponding Schedule of \nAssets would need to be attached. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Both of the proposed \nLine 4i Schedules of Assets would continue to require filers to enter, as applicable, the existing data elements (1) \nidentifying the issuer, borrower, lessor, or similar party; (2) describing the investment and identifying, as applicable, \nthe issue, maturity date, rate of interest, par, or maturity value, including whether the asset/investment is subject to \nsurrender charge; (3) reporting the cost of the asset; and (4) reporting the current value of the asset. A new data \nelement on the Line 4i(1) Schedule of Assets Held for Investment would require the filer to indicate whether the plan \nor reporting DFE held the investments directly, through a master trust, CCT, PSA, or a 103-12 IE. If the assets are \nheld through a DFE, the filer (whether a plan or an investing DFE) would be required to list each DFE as an \ninvestment and enter for each DFE in which the filer was invested, the name, employer identification number (EIN), \nand plan number (PN) used by the DFE on its own Form 5500. If a PSA or CCT in which the reporting plan or DFE \ninvests has not filed a Form 5500 Annual Return/Report, the filer would have to check a box to indicate that the \nCCT or PSA has not filed a Form 5500 Annual Return/Report, and the investing plan or DFE would have to break \nout the underlying assets of the CCT or PSA on its own Line 4i(1) Schedule of Assets Held for Investment at End of \nYear. This aspect of the proposal is intended better to coordinate the information currently reported by plans and \ninvesting DFEs on Schedule D and on the Line 4i(1) Schedule of Assets Held for Investment at End of Year. The \ncurrent instructions tell filers to use an asterisk to identify investments that involved a party-in-interest on the Line 4i \nSchedule of Assets Held for Investment at End of Year. Review of Form 5500 Annual Return/Report data, however, \nsuggests that many filers may not be aware of the requirement, which is currently explained only in the instructions \nfor Schedule H of the Form [[Page 47544]] 5500 Annual Return/Report. Identification of the involvement of a party-\nin-interest, therefore, has been inconsistent and incomplete. To address the issue, the proposal would replace the \ncurrent requirement to include an asterisk with a check box to indicate whether the investment involved a party-in-\ninterest. To indicate the type of asset generally, filers generally would be required to indicate on the Line 4i \nSchedule of Assets the category under which the value of the asset was included on the Schedule H asset \nstatement (proposed Line 1b), or if held through a CCT or PSA that has not filed, where the individual assets would \nhave been included on Line 1b if not held through the CCT or PSA. The proposal would add to the Line 4i(1) \nSchedule of Assets Held for Investment at End of Year a requirement to report investment identifiers such as \nCUSIP (Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures), CIK (Central Index Key), and LEI (Legal Entity \nIdentifier), if applicable, for each asset. Filers would also be expected to provide any other uniform number \napplicable to the entity or asset being reported, such as the Financial Instrument Global Identifier (FIGI), which is \nnow coming into more common usage.\\17\\ The use of CUSIP in particular has been recognized by the GAO as a \nway to improve end-users' ability to aggregate analyses of the information contained on the Schedules of Assets. \nGAO Private Pensions: Targeted Revisions Could Improve Usefulness Of Form 5500 Information, at 17. --------------\n------------------------------------------------------------- \\17\\ See U.S. Bank Adopts Bloomberg's New Industry-standard for \nTrustee Reporting, Bloomberg, (available at            http://www.bloomberg.com /company/announcements/u-s-bank-\nadopts-bloombergs-new-industry-standard-for-trustee-reporting/) (reporting that U.S. Bank is the first corporate \n\nhttp://www.bloomberg.com/\n\n\ntrustee to adopt Bloomberg's transparent, open-source methodology.) ------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------- The Agencies recognize that some identifiers, particularly the LEI, are not yet widely used. The LEI is \nincluded in the proposal in anticipation of increased use by the time the rule becomes final. The LEI is intended to \nidentify legally distinct entities that engage in a financial transaction. It has support from both industry and \ngovernment agencies who view having a universal identifier of parties to financial transactions, such as the LEI, as \nan important response to the 2008 financial crisis and the best way to track and understand the true nature of risk \nexposures across the financial system. See, e.g., Statement on Legal Entity Identification for Financial Contracts, \n75 FR 74146, 74147 (Nov. 30, 2010) (noting that precise and accurate identification of legal entities engaged in \nfinancial transactions is important to private markets and government regulation); Executive Office of the President \nof the United States, Nat'l Science and Technology Council, Smart Disclosure and Consumer Decision-making: \nReport of the Task Force on Smart Disclosure, at 13 (2013) (noting that the Administration is working to promote a \nLEI system). The use of LEI to identify pension plan transactions is particularly important because pension plan \ninvestments make up a large percentage of all investment assets and, as previously discussed, plans are \nincreasingly invested in alternative investments that involve complicated financial structures and transactions. \nUnder the proposal, filers would continue to be required to set forth the current value of each investment asset \nlisted on the Line 4i Schedules of Assets. To improve reporting on hard-to-value assets where the current value is \nby definition not readily available, filers would be required to check a box for each individual investment listed to \nindicate whether the asset is ``hard-to-value.'' This requirement is meant to supplement the current compliance \nquestion on the Schedule H that asks whether the plan held any investment assets whose value was not readily \ndeterminable on an established market or set by a third party independent appraisal. See, e.g., 2015 Form 5500 \nAnnual Return/ Report Instructions for Schedule H. The aggregate compliance question, by itself, does not provide \nparticularly useful information on hard-to- value assets. An examination of Form 5500 Annual Return/Report filings \nsuggests substantial non-compliance or inaccurate reporting in the ways plans answer the question. See also DOL-\nOIG EBSA Needs To Provide Additional Guidance And Oversight To ERISA Plans Holding Hard-To-Value \nAlternative Investments, at 4-5, 18, and 19 (recognizing that the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report has a ``limited \nability to capture information on hard-to-value investments'' and recommending that EBSA ``improve Form 5500 \n[Annual Return/Report] data collection, analysis, and targeting of plans with hard-to-value investments.''). The \nAgencies believe that the requirement for filers to indicate for each specific investment asset whether the asset is \nhard-to-value is in keeping with the goals of obtaining better information regarding plan assets. The instructions \nwould also include a clearer definition of hard- to-value assets for this purpose. Specifically, assets that are not \nlisted on any national exchanges or over-the-counter markets, or for which quoted market prices are not available \nfrom sources such as financial publications, the exchanges, or the National Association of Securities Dealers \nAutomated Quotations System (NASDAQ), would be required to be identified as hard-to-value assets on the Line 4i \nSchedules of Assets. CCTs and PSAs that are invested primarily in hard- to-value assets must themselves be \nidentified as hard-to-value assets, regardless of whether they are valued at least annually. Similar to the existing \ntreatment in the instructions for registered investment companies, CCTs, and PSAs under the current rules, those \nregistered investment companies, CCTs, and PSAs that are valued at least annually and are invested primarily in \nassets that are listed on any national exchanges or over-the-counter markets, or for which quoted market prices are \navailable from sources such as financial publications, the exchanges, or the NASDAQ, however, would not need to \nbe identified as hard-to-value assets on the Line 4i Schedules of Assets. A non-exhaustive list of examples of \nassets that would be required to be identified as hard-to-value on the proposed Schedules of Assets includes: Non-\npublicly traded securities, real estate, private equity funds; hedge funds; and real estate investment trusts (REITs). \nThe Agencies believe this definition is generally consistent with the FASB audit and accounting requirements \ndefining assets with a readily determinable fair value. See, e.g., FASB Accounting Standards Codification TM (ASC) \n(Topic 820). As discussed above, filers generally would be permitted to aggregate participant-directed brokerage \naccount reporting on the Line 4i Schedules of Assets by indicating the value of all the brokerage account \ninvestments as a single entry (identifying the brokerage account information). In the element requiring filers to \nindicate the location where the asset was aggregated for purposes of balance sheet reporting on Line 1b, the filer \nwould have to indicate all of the following applicable categories of investments: Tangible personal property, loans, \npartnership or joint venture interests, real property, employer securities, investments that could result in a loss in \nexcess of the account balance of the participant or beneficiary who directed the transaction, and any asset that \nwould be categorized as ``Other.'' For the second of the Line 4i Schedules of Assets, which would correlate under \nthe proposal to Schedule H, Line 4i(2), as noted above, [[Page 47545]] the Agencies propose to change ``Schedule \n\n\n\nof Assets Acquired and Disposed Within Year'' to ``Schedule of Assets Disposed of During the Plan Year.'' Filers \ncurrently report some information regarding the disposal of hard-to-value assets and alternative investments either \non the Schedule H, Line 4i Schedule of Assets if the assets were both acquired and disposed of during the plan \nyear, or, if the value of the transaction was five percent or more of total plan assets, on the Schedule H, Line 4j \n``Schedule of Reportable Transactions.'' The Agencies believe, however, that requiring reporting of hard-to-value \nassets and alternative investments acquired in one year and disposed of in another year, including investments that \nfall under the five percent limit of Line 4j,\\18\\ would provide the Agencies with a more complete report of the plan's \nannual investments. The limitations on what assets need to be reported on the Schedule of Assets Disposed of \nDuring the Plan Year would remain unchanged from the current exceptions from reporting on the Schedules of \nAssets not held at the end of the plan year. Thus, the following would continue to be excluded from the Line 4i(2) \nSchedule of Assets Disposed of During the Plan Year: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\18\\ \nTitle I of ERISA contemplates reporting transactions involving three percent or more of plan assets. ERISA section \n103(b)(3)(H). By prior rulemaking, the DOL has limited that reporting requirement to transactions involving five \npercent or more of plan assets. The Agencies continue to believe that generally keeping the limit at transactions \ninvolving five percent or more of plan assets, with this change to the Line 4i schedules, will provide sufficient \ninformation about significant transactions during the plan year. ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n----- 1. Debt obligations of the U.S. or any U.S. agency. 2. Interests issued by a company registered under the \nInvestment Company Act of 1940 (e.g., a mutual fund). 3. Bank certificates of deposit with a maturity of one year or \nless. 4. Commercial paper with a maturity of 9 months or less if it is valued in the highest rating category by at least \ntwo nationally recognized statistical rating services and is issued by a company required to file reports with the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission under section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 5. Participations in \na bank common or collective trust (CCT). 6. Participations in an insurance company pooled separate account \n(PSA). 7. Securities purchased from a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and \neither: (1) Listed on a national securities exchange and registered under section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of \n1934 or (2) quoted on NASDAQ. Likewise, assets disposed of during the plan year would continue to exclude any \ninvestment that was not held by the plan on the last day of the plan year if that investment is reported in the annual \nreport for that plan year in any of the following schedules: 1. The schedule of loans or fixed income obligations in \ndefault required by Schedule G, Part I; 2. The schedule of leases in default or classified as uncollectible required by \nSchedule G, Part II; 3. The schedule of nonexempt transactions required by Schedule G, Part III; or 4. The \nschedule of reportable transactions required by Schedule H, line 4j. The new proposed Line 4i(2) Schedule of \nAssets Disposed of Within Year, generally would have the same data elements as the current Schedule of Assets \nAcquired and Disposed of Within Year. To implement the change in the schedule from ``acquired and disposed of \nduring the plan year'' to ``disposed of during the plan year,'' however, filers would have to indicate the acquisition \ndate. Basic parallel changes would be made to the Line 4i(2) Schedule to keep it generally consistent with the Line \n4i(1) Schedule. Under the proposal, the Line 4j Schedule of Reportable (5%) Transactions would remain essentially \nunchanged. The current schedule of reportable transactions requires the filer to include information on the identity \nof the party involved in the reportable transaction or series of transactions. Consistent with the Line 4i Schedules of \nAssets, a checkbox is being added to this schedule to indicate whether the reportable transaction or series of \ntransactions involved a person known to be a party-in-interest. Under the proposal, the Line 4j Schedule of \nReportable (5%) Transactions would be structured in a standard format for data input and collection purposes; filers \nwould not be able to use a nonstandard attachment. 3. Proposed Changes to DFE Reporting As described in parts \nA.1 and A.2 above in the context of the new Schedule H balance sheet information and the updated schedules of \nassets, respectively, the proposal includes changes as to what information about DFEs and their underlying \ninvestments needs to be reported by both the plan and the DFE. The proposal includes correlative changes to the \nSchedule D that are described below, including the elimination of the requirement of plans to complete Schedule D. \nThe Agencies considered a number of alternatives in developing a proposal to address problems and concerns with \nregard to the consistency and quality of the reporting of assets held through collective investment vehicles, \nincluding DFEs. The Agencies considered whether both DFEs and plans should be required, on their Line 4i \nSchedule of Assets, to show the underlying investments of DFEs. The Agencies also considered eliminating filings \nfor PSAs, CCTs, and 103-12 IEs and simply requiring plans to report on the Line 4i Schedules of Assets the plan's \nproportionate share of each of the underlying assets held by each PSA, CCT, or 103-12 IE in which the plan is \ninvested. The Agencies invite comments on the most effective and efficient way to address the inconsistent and \nlimited reporting of information invested through DFEs. The Agencies are particularly interested in information on \n\n\n\nhow investments in DFEs relate to investment alternatives in participant-directed accounts and how much of the \nunderlying assets of DFEs consist of hard-to-value and alternative investments. This revised reporting structure for \nboth the Schedule H and the Line 4i Schedules of Assets for reporting investments through pooled investment \nvehicles is intended to enable the Agencies, plan fiduciaries and service providers, and other users of the data to \nhave a better and more complete picture of the investments of plans. For nearly 44 percent of all assets held by \nlarge pension plans, the public information on plans' investments on the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report is limited \nto the class of the pooled investment arrangements rather than the financial class of the underlying investments \n(including hard- to-value and alternative investments). See Dep't of Labor, 2010 Form 5500 Direct Filing Entity \nBulletin: Abstract of 2010 Form 5500 Annual Reports (2013), at 6. The proposed changes to reporting information \nabout assets held through DFEs on the Line 4i Schedules of Assets, as well as the proposed changes to the \nSchedule H balance sheet information, is also supported by the GAO's recommendation that the Agencies take \nsteps to reduce the difficulty associated with matching a plan's investments with those reported in the DFE's filing. \nGAO Private Pensions: Targeted Revisions Could Improve Usefulness of Form 5500 Information, at 14-15. The \nproposed filing requirements for master trusts, CCTs and PSAs, 103-12 [[Page 47546]] IEs, group insurance \narrangements (GIAs), and the plans that invest through these vehicles and the proposed revisions to Schedule D \nreporting are described more fully below. a. DFE Reporting--Master Trusts Some plans participate in certain trusts, \naccounts, and other investment arrangements that file the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report as a DFE. In general, a \nmaster trust for Form 5500 Annual Return/Report filing purposes is a trust maintained by a bank or similar institution \nto hold the assets of more than one plan sponsored by a single employer or by a group of employers under \ncommon control. Unlike CCTs and PSAs, not every plan participating in the master trust necessarily has a \nproportionate share of all of the assets of the master trust. To get information about each plan's holdings within the \nmaster trust, the annual return/report has historically asked for information about so- called MTIAs. The Agencies \nunderstand that the MTIA reporting requirements are unique to the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report, do not fully \ncorrespond to actual trust accounting practices used for master trusts, and may not be well understood or \nconsistently complied with by plans that use master trusts for investment and reinvestment of assets. Accordingly, \nthe proposal would eliminate MTIA reporting and replace it with what is intended to be a simpler approach. Under \nthe MTIA reporting concept, each pool of assets held in a master trust is treated as a separate MTIA if: (1) Each \nplan that has an interest in the pool has the same fractional interest in each of the assets in the pool as its fractional \ninterest in the pool, and (2) each such plan cannot dispose of its interest in any asset in the pool without disposing \nof its interest in the pool. Under this test, it is possible for a single asset to be an MTIA if ownership of the asset \nmeets the above test. Currently, a separate Form 5500 Annual Return/ Report must be filed for each MTIA, among \nother things, listing the underlying assets of the MTIA on Schedule H and the aggregate value of each investing \nplan's ownership interest in the MTIA on Schedule D. The filing of each MTIA is deemed to be part of the Form \n5500 Annual Return/Report of the investing plan, and the plan administrator is, therefore, ultimately responsible for \nMTIAs filing their Form 5500 Annual Return/Report, even if the bank or other third party is the person that files for \nthe MTIA. According to GAO, MTIAs account for roughly 20.4% of the total assets of large defined contribution \npension plans. See Private Pensions: Targeted Revisions Could Improve Usefulness Of Form 5500 Information, at \n14. Accuracy of filings showing investments in master trusts (regardless of reporting structure) is therefore \nimportant to have a complete picture of plan investments. To facilitate consistent reporting, the Agencies now \npropose to eliminate the concept of a separate MTIA filing as part of the changes to Schedules D and H and the \nLine 4i Schedules of Assets. Prior to 1999, master trusts were required to file the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report; \ninformation about MTIAs was provided in an attachment to the consolidated master trust filing. See, e.g., 1998 \nForm 5500 Annual Return/Report and Instructions. Under the proposal, master trust filing would return to something \ncloser to the pre-1999 structure. Specifically, a Form 5500 Annual Return/Report would be required to be filed for \neach master trust in which a plan has an interest. The master trust, like a MTIA under the current rules, would be \nrequired to include as part of its Form 5500 Annual Return/Report, a Schedule D to list all participating plans. The \nSchedule D listing of participating plans would include the requirement to report the total value of each participating \nplan's investment assets in the master trust. Plans would report their investments in master trusts in detail on their \nSchedule H, Line 4i(1) Schedule of Assets Held for Investment at End of Year, including the name and EIN of the \nmaster trust used on the master trust's Form 5500 Annual Return/Report. Plans would also list the aggregate value \nof their investment in master trusts on the Schedule H balance sheet. The proposal also would change the \ninstructions to address what the Agencies understand to be inconsistency in the way master trust expenses are \nreported. Specifically, under the proposal, the master trust's report would include expenses that are allocable \n\n\n\nequally to all plans investing in the master trust. All other expenses would have to be allocated to the individual \nparticipating plans and reported at the individual plan level. Finally, the regulations and instructions would provide \nthat to be a master trust for reporting purposes, either the master trust must operate on a calendar year or the \nmaster trust and all of the plans invested in the master trust must operate on the same fiscal year. Where the \nmaster trust is on a calendar year and a participating plan on a fiscal year other than a calendar year, similar to \nSchedule A reporting of insurance contracts, the information reported by the plan would be for the master trust year \nending within the plan year. The combined changes for reporting by both investing plans and master trusts on both \nthe Schedule H balance sheet and the Line 4i Schedules are intended better to effectuate the purposes underlying \nthe current combination of MTIA, Schedule H (including the Line 4i Schedules), and Schedule D reporting. This \nshould make it easier to understand the finances of the master trust as a whole, as well as the finances of the plans \ninvesting through a master trust. The Agencies invite comments to provide alternative suggestions on how to \nimprove the transparency and accuracy of reporting plans' proportionate ownership of interests in assets held \nthrough a master trust. b. DFE Reporting--CCTs and PSAs As with the existing rules, under the proposal, a Form \n5500 Annual Return/Report may be, but is not required to be, filed for a CCT or a PSA. The proposal would change \nthe filing requirements with respect to CCTs and PSAs as follows. As discussed above, regardless of whether a \nCCT or PSA in which the plan invests files a Form 5500 Annual Return/ Report as a DFE, the plan would report the \ninterests in the CCT or PSA on the CCT or PSA line of the Schedule H balance sheet (Part I, Line 1b), although \nthere would be breakouts within those categories to give a general idea of the types of assets held through the CCT \nor PSA. The changes should result in a clearer statement of total plan assets invested through these collective \ninvestment vehicles. The current requirement to break out the assets of non-filing CCTs or PSAs would be retained, \nbut the proposal would shift the details of the underlying investments to the newly structured Line 4i(1) Schedule of \nAssets. Under the proposed revisions, investing plans, on their own Line 4i Schedules of Assets, would be required \nto list each underlying investment, identifying that the investment was held through a non- filing CCT or PSA, \nincluding the CCT's or PSA's name and other identifying information, as well as the information on the underlying \nasset.\\19\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\19\\ As discussed above, if the CCT or PSA \nfiles a Form 5500 Annual Return/Report, the holdings in the CCT or PSA could be listed on the plan's Line 4i(1) \nSchedule of Assets at the CCT/PSA level (corresponding to the breakout categories on the balance sheet \nstatement). Thus, the PSA or CCT filing of a Form 5500 Annual Return/Report, including the Line 4i(1) Schedule of \nAssets Held for Investment, would relieve each participating plan from reporting detailed information regarding the \nunderlying investments. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- [[Page 47547]] In this regard, the \nAgencies note that under current DOL regulations CCTs and PSAs are required to provide information about the \nunderlying assets of the CCT or PSA to participating plans and provide plans with relief from reporting the \nunderlying assets of the CCT or PSA if the CCT or PSA files the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report, but that CCTs \nand PSAs are not required themselves to file the Schedules of Assets. The regulation would be amended to provide \nthat plans are relieved from breaking out the individual assets on the Schedule H, Line 4i Schedules of Assets, if \nthe CCT or PSA instead files its own Form 5500, including the Schedule H and the Schedule of Assets Held for \nInvestment. Also, the regulation would indicate that providing the information needed for a plan to complete the Line \n4i Schedules of Assets constitutes compliance with the requirement to transmit information regarding the assets \nheld by the CCT or PSA. With this change, information regarding the underlying investments of CCTs and PSAs, \nwhich have been provided only to plan fiduciaries, will now be part of the annual return/report data set; it will be filed \neither by the participating plans or by the CCT or PSA. c. DFE Reporting--103-12 IE The DOL's regulation at 29 \nCFR 2520.103-12 provides that an entity in which two or more unrelated plans invest that is not a CCT, PSA, or \nmaster trust, and which is deemed to hold plan assets under the DOL's regulations at 29 CFR 2510.3-101 that \nvoluntarily chooses to file a Form 5500 Annual Return/Report for itself on behalf of its investing plans, is treated as \na ``103-12 IE'' filing entity for Form 5500 Annual Return/Report reporting purposes. Under the proposal, reporting \nfor these pooled investment vehicles generally remains unchanged, except to the extent that the data elements for \nthe existing forms and schedules have changed for all filers. For a plan to be able to report investments in such \nentities as a single investment on the balance sheet portion of Schedule H, as under the current reporting rules, the \nentity in which the plan invested would have to complete its own Form 5500, together with a Schedule H and Line 4i \nSchedules of Assets, as well as Schedules A, C, D, G, as revised in the proposal, and the entity's own IQPA report. \nUnder the proposal, similar to reporting assets held through participant-directed brokerage accounts, filers would \nhave to indicate all the Line 1b balance sheet breakout categories for types of underlying investment of each 103-\n12 IE, but would not have to identify each individual investment. d. DFE Reporting--GIAs The reporting \n\n\n\nrequirements for GIAs would generally remain unchanged, except GIAs would be subject to the same changes in \nreporting as comparable welfare plans, including the new requirements for welfare plans that provide health \nbenefits. As under the current rules, welfare plans that are fully insured, including group health plans, would still \nhave the exemption from filing the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report if they participate in a GIA that has filed its \nForm 5500 Annual Return/Report. GIAs would continue to be required to file all the same forms, schedules, and \nattachments as a large group health plan funded with a trust. GIAs that provide group health coverage would be \nrequired to file a separate Schedule J for each separate employer's participating plan. e. DFE Reporting--Changes \nto Schedule D The Agencies propose to continue the Schedule D requirement for DFEs in which plans invest, but \nnot for plans participating in DFEs. DFEs would continue to report identifying information about the participating \nplan and the dollar value of each investing plan's interests in the DFE as of the end of the DFE reporting year. \nParticipating plans, because they would now be reporting detailed information about investments in DFEs on their \nLine 4i Schedules of Assets, would no longer have to complete the Schedule D. 4. Better Information on Plan \nTerminations, Mergers, and Consolidations The Agencies propose revisions to existing Schedule H and Form 5500-\nSF questions on plan terminations, mergers, and consolidations. First, the Agencies propose expanding the \nquestion that asks whether the plan has adopted a resolution to terminate so that it also asks for the effective date \nof the plan termination, the year in which assets were distributed to plan participants and beneficiaries, and whether \nthe plan transferred assets or liabilities to another plan. Second, the proposal would add a question asking filers to \nindicate whether another plan transferred assets or liabilities to the reporting plan (other than pursuant to a direct \nrollover). If the plan received a transfer of assets or liabilities from another plan, the filer would be asked to provide \nthe date and type of transfer (merger, consolidation, spinoff, other). This new information is intended to provide \nbetter information on transfers of participant benefit obligations over the years. Third, if the plan is a defined \ncontribution pension plan that terminated and transferred plan assets to a financial institution and established \naccounts in the name of missing participants, the filer would be asked to provide the name and EIN of the financial \ninstitution, the date the assets were transferred to the institution, the number of accounts established, and the total \namount transferred. Although the question would not ask the filer to identify individual affected participants or \nbeneficiaries, this requirement is designed to help missing participants locate information about their accounts, in \nsome cases years after the plan termination when the plan or plan sponsor may no longer exist or have records of \nthe accounts it established. Asking for information about accounts created for missing participants after plan \ntermination would also be responsive to the ERISA Advisory Council's recommendations that the DOL use the \nForm 5500 Annual Return/Report to obtain more consistent reporting on accounts that hold missing participant plan \nassets. See 2013 ERISA Advisory Council Report: Locating Missing and Lost Participants, Dep't of Labor (available \nat            www.dol.gov/ebsa/publications/2013ACreport3.html#2). In this 2013 report, the Advisory Council noted \nthat another issue with ``lost'' or ``missing'' participants for ongoing plans as well as terminating plans, especially \n401(k) plans, is ``uncashed'' checks, particularly checks sent to participants who have left employment where the \nCode permits the plan to ``cash out'' the participant. Id. The report noted that a plan was not necessarily able to tell \nwhether uncashed checks were sent to the wrong address (a ``lost'' or ``missing'' participant issue) or whether a \nparticipant received the check but had not cashed it. To get better information about the magnitude of the problem \nwith respect to defined contribution pension plans and to make plan fiduciaries aware that they should, at a \nminimum, have procedures in place to verify that a participant's address is good before a check is mailed and to \nkeep track of the number of uncashed checks and the amount involved, the proposal would also add to both the \nSchedule H and the Form 5500-SF a compliance question for defined contribution pension plans asking whether \nthere were any uncashed checks at the end of the plan year. If there were any uncashed checks at the end of the \nyear, filers would be required [[Page 47548]] to report how many uncashed checks there were and the total dollar \nvalue of the uncashed checks. Defined contribution pension plan filers would also be asked to describe briefly in an \nopen text field the procedures that they followed to verify a participant's address and with respect to monitoring the \nuncashed checks. The proposed instructions provide that for Form 5500 Annual Return/Report reporting purposes, \nan uncashed check is one that is no longer negotiable or is subject to limited payability. In proposing to add a \ncompliance question instead of telling filers how to account for the assets associated with uncashed checks on the \nSchedule H, the Agencies recognize that the ERISA Advisory Council indicated that there are questions regarding \nhow the underlying assets represented by uncashed checks should be reported on the Form 5500 Annual \nReturn/Report. Because of the variety of situations that might result in uncashed checks and the different ways \nuncashed checks might be accounted for in an ongoing plan, the Agencies have chosen to add a compliance \nquestion, leaving flexibility in the balance sheet reporting on Schedule H and on the Form 5500-SF and, where \n\nhttp://www.dol.gov/ebsa/publications/2013ACreport3.html#2\n\n\napplicable, the IQPA report. The ERISA Advisory Council and some of the witnesses who testified recommended \nthat the DOL publish guidance to advise plan fiduciaries how to handle uncashed checks, among other issues \nregarding missing or lost participants and beneficiaries and how to address the assets associated with those \nparticipants or beneficiaries. In making this recommendation, it was recognized that there was a tension between \nthe mandatory distribution requirements under the Code and fiduciary responsibilities. In the absence of further \nguidance with regard to how to handle uncashed checks, the DOL notes (as stated above) that plans should at \nleast have policies and procedures in place to verify participant addresses, for searching for missing participants \nand for fiduciaries to keep track of or be made aware of the number of uncashed checks and the total value of such \nchecks that remained uncashed at the end of the plan year. Depending on the type of plan, the terms of the plan, \nand the status of the plan sponsor, there may be actions needed to satisfy fiduciary obligations with regard to \nbenefit payments. 5. Changes to Financial Reporting for Small Plans a. Changes to Form 5500-SF In general, small \nplans that are invested only in ``eligible'' plan assets and otherwise meet the existing requirements for eligibility to \nfile the Form 5500-SF would continue to be able to file the Form 5500- SF.\\20\\ Welfare plans with fewer than 100 \nparticipants that do not provide group health benefits and that are required to file an annual return/report and that \nmeet the eligibility requirements for the Form 5500-SF will still be able to use the Form 5500-SF to satisfy their filing \nrequirement. Welfare plans with fewer than 100 participants that provide group health benefits are not eligible to \nuse the Form 5500- SF.\\21\\ For Form 5500-SF filers, there would be a modest additional breakout on the balance \nsheet information to give a basic picture of the types of eligible assets in which Form 5500-SF eligible small plans \nare invested. Specifically, filers would have to categorize the plans' investments into one of the following categories: \n(1) Cash/cash equivalents; (2) money market funds; (3) publicly traded stock (preferred/common); (4) publicly \ntraded bonds, including government securities; (5) interests in registered investment companies (mutual funds, unit \ninvestment trusts, closed end funds); (6) interests in PSAs; (7) interests in CCTs; and (8) interests in insurance \npolicies/ contracts other than PSAs, e.g. annuity contracts. In contrast to the Schedule H balance sheet financial \nbreakout categories, there would be no ``Other'' category for the balance sheet financials on the Form 5500-SF. If a \nsmall plan were to be invested in any assets other than those in the eight listed categories, it would not be eligible \nto file the Form 5500-SF. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\20\\ The Form 5500-SF was \ndeveloped and adopted for 2009 Form 5500 Annual Return/Report in part to provide a simplified report required \nunder the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The DOL continues to believe, as discussed when implementing the \n2009 forms revisions, 72 FR 64731 (Nov. 16, 2007), that the requirement in the PPA to provide ``'simplified'' \nreporting for plans with fewer than 25 participants is satisfied by making available the simplified reporting in the \n5500-SF only to those plans invested in eligible assets--generally easy to value assets. Section 1103(b) of the \nPension Protection Act of 2006, (PPA) 120 Stat. 780, 1057, requires the Secretary of the Treasury/IRS and the \nSecretary of Labor to provide for the filing of a simplified annual return for any retirement plan which covers fewer \nthan 25 participants on the first day of the plan year and which (1) meets the minimum coverage requirements of \nsection 410(b) of the Internal Revenue Code without being combined with any other plan of the business that \ncovers the employees of the business; (2) does not cover a business that is a member of an affiliated service group, \na controlled group of corporations, or a group of businesses under common control; and (3) does not cover a \nbusiness that uses the services of leased employees (within the meaning of section 414(n) of the Code). The PPA \nprovision does not include specific requirements as to the form or content of the simplified filing. \\21\\ Currently \nwelfare plans with fewer than 100 participants, including those that provide group health benefits, that are not \nexempt from the requirement to file an annual return/report (e.g., those that are funded with a trust) are permitted to \nfile the Form 5500-SF, if otherwise eligible. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As discussed \nin more detail below, the proposal would eliminate the current Form 5500 and Form 5500-SF line items that require \nthe filer to input ``plan characteristics codes'' onto the form from a list in the instructions. Instead, the filer would \ncomplete a series of separate questions. In general, those changes involve requesting information about plan \ncharacteristics as a series of ``Yes''/``No'' and check box questions to make the forms easier to complete, make the \nforms more straightforward as a disclosure document, and improve the quality of the data. In addition, as with Form \n5500 Schedule H filers, the proposal would require that the Form 5500-SF filed for a participant- directed individual \naccount plan must include an electronic copy of the comparative chart of designated investment alternatives (DIAs) \ncurrently required to be provided to participants of such plans under 29 CFR 2550.404a-5. The Agencies believe \nthat although this information would not be filed in a data captured structure and, thus, would not be as readily data \nmineable, attaching the already required 404a-5 comparison chart would allow participants and beneficiaries in \nparticipant-directed individual account plans to access the most recent and prior year comparative charts through \n\n\n\nthe EFAST Form 5500 Annual Return/Report public disclosure feature. It would also enable the Agencies to monitor \nmore effectively compliance by participant-directed individual account plans with this important disclosure \nrequirement. It also would provide important information regarding investment features and investment fees and \nexpenses. We also understand that private third parties would be able to use the copies of the comparative charts \nto develop more individualized tools to help plan sponsors, plan fiduciaries, and participants and beneficiaries \nevaluate and compare their plans' investment options. The Agencies believe that a requirement that the plan \nadministrator of a participant-directed individual account plan attach an electronic copy of an existing document \nshould be less burdensome than adding new questions that would require the same data to be entered onto the \nform or schedules to collect the information. [[Page 47549]] The Agencies seek comment as to whether there would \nbe any real additional burden, other than transition costs to move to the new method, to enter the data in a \nstructured format rather than attaching a copy of the existing document. b. Changes to Filing Exemptions and \nRequirements for Small Plans Not Eligible To File the Form 5500-SF As discussed above, various oversight and \nadvisory bodies have identified a significant need for better information regarding employee benefit plan \ninvestments, in particular regarding plans invested in hard-to-value and alternative investments. In that regard, the \nAgencies are proposing a number of changes for small plans that are not Form 5500-SF eligible filers. First, the \nSchedule I would be eliminated. Like the Form 5500-SF, the Schedule I does not require small plan filers to provide \ndetailed plan asset information. Since small plan filers are the majority of annual return/report filers overall (taking \ninto account both Form 5500-SF and Form 5500 filers), this shortcoming impairs the utility of the Form 5500 Annual \nReturn/Report as a tool to obtain a meaningful picture of small plan investments in hard-to-value and other assets. \nAs the GAO has noted, the limited financial information provided on the Schedule I creates a challenge for \nparticipants, beneficiaries, oversight agencies, researchers, and other users of the Form 5500 or Form 5500 data. \nGAO Targeted Revisions Could Improve Usefulness of Form 5500 Information, at 18. Accordingly, under the \nproposed change, small plans that are not eligible to file the Form 5500-SF and that currently file the Schedule I \nwould be required to complete the Schedule H and the applicable Line 4i Schedules of assets. Small plans with \nsimple investment portfolios would not see a significant increase in their annual reporting burden. Although this \nwould result in additional reporting details for those small plans with complex portfolios that include hard-to-value or \nalternative investments, the Agencies believe that such small plans should have more transparent financial \nstatements. In light of changes in the financial environment and increasing concern about investments in hard- to-\nvalue assets and alternative investments, the Agencies continue to believe that requiring small plans invested in \nsuch assets to report separate financial information regarding hard-to-value investments is important for regulatory, \nenforcement, and disclosure purposes. Although such small plans would be required to complete the Schedule H \ninstead of the Schedule I, including the Line 4i(1) and 4i(2) Schedules of Assets, to minimize increased burden, \nsmall plans that meet the specified requirements, as they can under the current rules, would continue to be eligible \nfor a waiver of the annual examination and report of an independent qualified public accountant (IQPA) under 29 \nCFR 2520.104-46. As is currently the case, under the proposal, all welfare plans with fewer than 100 participants \nthat are required to file an annual return/report are eligible for a waiver of the annual examination and report of an \nIQPA under 29 CFR 2520.104-46(b)(2). The Agencies are also proposing to change the rules for determining when \na plan is exempt from the requirement to include an IQPA report with its filing. In that regard, the Agencies are \nproposing to add to the Form 5500 a new question, for defined contribution pension plans only, asking for the \nnumber of participants with account balances at the beginning of the plan year. Defined contribution pension plans \nwould determine whether they have to file as a large plan and whether they have to attach an IQPA report based on \nthe number of participants with account balances as of the beginning of the plan year, as reported on the face of the \nForm 5500 or Form 5500-SF. Currently, the IQPA requirement is based on the total number of participants \n(including those eligible but not participating in a Code section 401(k) or 403(b) plan) at the beginning of the plan \nyear. With the changes in the reporting requirements for small plans (for example, the elimination of the Schedule \nI), this would minimize burden, but would still provide a picture of the types of investments and fees of small plans \n(plans with fewer than 100 participants that have an account balance) without requiring them to cover the cost of an \naudit. For first plan year filings, the plan would have to have fewer than 100 participants with account balances \nboth at the beginning of the plan year and the end of the plan year. The proposal would also require a Schedule C \nto be filed by small pension plans that are not eligible to file the Form 5500-SF, small welfare plans that provide \ngroup health benefits that are not unfunded or insured (e.g., funded using a trust), and other small welfare plans \nthat are not unfunded or insured plans and are not eligible to file the Form 5500-SF. Currently, only large plans \nmust file a Schedule C, thus excluding a large portion of plans from having to disclose service provider fees. The \n\n\n\nAgencies recognize the burdens small plans face in complying with disclosure obligations, but requiring certain \nsmall plans to file a Schedule C would address some of the GAO's concerns that not all critical information on \nindirect compensation is being reported to the Agencies. See GAO Targeted Revisions Could Improve Usefulness \nof Form 5500 Information, at 25-26 (``Given these various exceptions to fee reporting requirements, Schedule C \nmay not provide participants, the government, or the public with information about a significant portion of plan \nexpenses and limits the ability to identify fees that may be questionable.''). In addition, the rule would better align \nfinancial information reporting with recently adopted disclosure rules to broaden the fees that are reported by the \naffected plans. Id. at 50. 6. New Information on Employer Matching Contributions, Employee Participation Rates, \nand Plan Design for Defined Contribution Pension Plans The Agencies are proposing changes that are intended to \ncollect better information on pension plan coverage and performance as retirement savings vehicles. The focus is \non participant-directed defined contribution pension plans, which are becoming the primary source of retirement \nsavings for many of America's workers. Specifically, the proposal would add new questions to the Form 5500, Form \n5500-SF, and Schedule R on participation, contributions, and asset allocation by age, and participant-level \ndiversification. The questions ask for the number of participants making catch-up contributions, investing in default \ninvestment options, maximizing the employer match, and deferring compensation. Also, questions would be added \nto the Form 5500 and Form 5500-SF to collect information on the number of participants in defined contribution \npension plans with account balances as of the beginning of the plan year and on the number of participants that \nterminated employment during the plan year that had their entire account balance distributed. There are also new \nquestions about whether the plan uses a default investment alternative for participants who fail to direct assets in \ntheir account and which type of investment alternative is used. 7. Changes to Reporting on Schedule G (Financial \nTransaction Schedules) The proposal would reconfigure Schedule G's reporting to require more uniform and \ndetailed information on loans, fixed income obligations, and [[Page 47550]] leases in default, including \nswaps/options and derivative transactions. By creating specific data elements on the existing Schedule G line items \nfor plans to identify specifically swaps and options that would otherwise generically have been reported as loans or \nfixed income obligations in default or uncollectible, the proposed Schedule G is intended to provide a more \ncomplete picture of issues of default, uncollectibility, or conflict of interest (nonexempt) transactions with respect to \nplan investment in these types of hard-to-value assets. 8. Re-introduction of Schedule E To Improve Information on \nEmployee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) Prior to 2009, the Schedule E (ESOP Annual Information) was an IRS \ncomponent of the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report used to collect information regarding ESOPs. As with the other \n``IRS-only'' schedules that are part of the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report, the Schedule E was removed from the \n2009 Form 5500 Annual Return/Report when DOL mandated electronic filing of the Form 5500 Annual \nReturn/Report as part of EFAST2 due to statutory limits on the IRS's authority to mandate electronic filing of such \ninformation for filers of fewer than 250 returns. A limited number of the questions on the Schedule E were moved to \nthe Schedule R beginning with the 2009 Form 5500 Annual Return/ Report. The Schedule R is not an ``IRS-only'' \nschedule nor were the questions that were moved to the Schedule R IRS-only. Accordingly, filing of the current \nESOP information on the Schedule R was subject to DOL's electronic filing mandate under Title I of ERISA. The \nAgencies propose to bring back to the Form 5500 Annual Return/ Report a revised version of the Schedule E, \nwhich now generally would be required reporting under both Title I of ERISA and the Code and thus would be open \nto public inspection. The new version would include some of the questions on the pre-2009 Schedule E, revisions to \nother questions, and additional new questions. The questions moved to the Schedule R for the 2009 revisions \nwould be removed from the Schedule R and instead be included on the new and revised Schedule E. The Agencies \nbelieve the use of a single schedule for all ESOP questions would simplify the filing of Form 5500 Annual \nReturn/Report for both ESOP and non-ESOP filers. In addition, a single schedule for ESOPs would also be a more \neffective and efficient information collection tool for the Agencies. The questions on the proposed Schedule E are \ndivided into sections based on whether the ESOP stock was acquired by a securities acquisition loan, whether the \nstock is readily tradable on an established securities market (including stock acquired by securities acquisition \nloans), whether the ESOP has an outstanding securities acquisition loan, and some miscellaneous questions. Part I \nof the proposed Schedule E would apply only if the ESOP acquired common or preferred stock with the proceeds of \na securities acquisition loan. Several questions relate to the valuation of the stock acquired by the ESOP and, in \nparticular, cases where a premium is paid for a controlling interest in a company where, in fact, a controlling interest \nis not acquired. Questions would also be included regarding the release of common stock from a suspense account \nand its allocation. For example, a question would ask for the method used when stock is released from the \nsuspense account (similar to Line 5 of the 2008 Schedule E) in accordance with Treasury regulations. See 26 CFR \n\n\n\n54.4975-7(b)(8). As with Line 4 of the 2008 Schedule E, the proposed Schedule E would also ask if the ESOP holds \npreferred stock and further ask for the method by which the preferred stock is convertible into common stock. Part II \nof the proposed Schedule E would ask questions related to compliance issues when stock that is not readily \ntradable on an established securities market is acquired by an ESOP. Specifically, with respect to each acquisition \nof stock, the proposed schedule would ask for information on the relationship of the seller of the stock to the plan or \nto the employer, and whether the seller is a party-in- interest or a disqualified person under the prohibited \ntransaction rules of Title I of ERISA and the Code, respectively. Further, the proposed schedule would ask for the \ntotal consideration paid and the date of the transaction. The proposed schedule would also ask if the stock was \nvalued by an independent appraiser and, if not, the identity of the person who valued the stock. Lastly, Part II would \nask for the valuation method(s) used to value the stock. Each of these questions would assist the Agencies in \nidentifying possible issues in the acquisition of stock, including whether the stock was properly valued and whether \na prohibited transaction may have occurred. Part III of the proposed Schedule E asks questions applicable to \nESOPs with outstanding securities acquisition loans. Unlike the 2008 Schedule E which only asked whether the \nESOP had a securities acquisition loan, the proposed Schedule E would ask for more information regarding these \nloans. The proposed schedule asks for basic information regarding the amount and date of the loan, as well as the \ninterest rate on the loan. In order to address possible prohibited transactions and situations where the ESOP may \nhave paid too much for the stock, the proposed Schedule E also would ask for the lender's relationship to the plan \nand the plan sponsor, whether the lender is a disqualified person or a party-in-interest, and whether the loan was \nguaranteed by a disqualified person or a party-in-interest. Part III also would ask questions regarding whether the \nloan is in default and whether the loan has been refinanced. A loan that is in default raises issues as to whether the \nplan sponsor is making substantial and recurring payments to the ESOP and whether the ESOP has been \nterminated, in which case all of the ESOP shares should be distributed. Part IV of the proposed Schedule E would \ninclude miscellaneous questions. Specifically, to address compliance concerns under Title I of ERISA, the proposed \nschedule would ask whether employee elective deferrals were used to satisfy any securities acquisition loan. With \nthe exception of the elective deferral question, which addresses a DOL compliance issue and not an issue under \nthe Code, the Part IV questions are carried over from the 2008 Schedule E and continue to address significant \ncompliance issues under the Code, including whether the amount of the dividend is reasonable and whether the \nrequirements of 26 CFR 1.404(k)-3T are satisfied. Specifically, the proposed Schedule E would ask whether the \nESOP is maintained by an S corporation and whether there are any disqualified persons under Code section \n409(p)(4) (lines 1a and 1b of the 2008 Schedule E), whether any unallocated securities (or proceeds from \nunallocated securities) were used to repay an exempt loan (Line 6 of the 2008 Schedule E), and whether the plan \nsponsor paid dividends deductible under Code section 404(k) (Line 2b of the 2008 Schedule E). This last question \nis further broken down on the proposed schedule to include information as to the amount of the deduction, the \ndividend rate, and whether the dividends were used to reacquire stock held by the ESOP. As described above, \nseveral of the questions on the proposed Schedule E would be IRS-only questions. These questions are subject to \nthe electronic filing rules imposed by Treasury [[Page 47551]] regulations, but they are not subject to the DOL \nelectronic filing mandate. The IRS-only questions would be identified on the Schedule E itself or in the Schedule E \ninstructions. Accordingly, although filers would be required to answer most questions on the proposed Schedule E \nelectronically using EFAST2, some filers who are not subject to the IRS electronic filing requirements and elect not \nto answer the questions through EFAST2 would have the option of answering the IRS-only questions on the IRS's \nForm 5500 SUP ``Annual Return of Employee Benefit Plan Supplemental Information,'' which is a separate paper \nbased IRS-only information collection system maintained by the IRS outside of the EFAST2 system. B. Improve \nFee and Service Provider Transparency (Schedules C and H) The Agencies continue to make efforts to improve the \nreporting and disclosure of service provider compensation. The key focus of the proposed changes in this regard is \nto harmonize Form 5500, Schedule C, reporting of indirect compensation with the disclosures required under the \nDOL's final regulation under Title I of ERISA on service provider compensation at 29 CFR 2550.408b-2. As \ndiscussed above in the section on small plan reporting changes, the proposal would also expand Schedule C \nreporting to those pension plans required to file the Form 5500, regardless of size.\\22\\ The current Form 5500, \nSchedule C indirect compensation reporting rules, including the exception from reporting of ``eligible indirect \ncompensation,'' were implemented for the 2009 forms. See 72 FR 74731 (Nov. 16, 2007). Those changes were part \nof a three-pronged regulatory initiative that included the DOL's plan-level disclosure regulations under 29 CFR \n2550.408b-2 and participant-level disclosure regulations under 29 CFR 2550.404a-5. At the time the Schedule C \nrules were finalized, the 408b-2 disclosure regulations had not yet been promulgated. Some elements of the \n\n\n\nSchedule C, for example, the eligible indirect compensation provisions, were adopted in light of the fact that it was \nnot certain at the time what the 408b-2 final rule would require. Those provisions were also meant to respond to \nconcerns from the regulated community, especially large service providers with many ERISA-covered plan clients, \nabout having to create two different record-keeping systems to meet the various requirements of Form 5500 Annual \nReturn/Report and 408b-2 disclosures should the later promulgated 408b-2 provisions differ from the Form 5500 \nAnnual Return/Report reporting requirements on indirect compensation. With the service provider disclosure rules \nnow final at 29 CFR 2550.408b-2, the Agencies are proposing various changes to the Schedule C to better \nharmonize it with the disclosure requirements under the 408b-2 final rule. -------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------- \\22\\ Form 5500-SF filers would not be required to file the Schedule C, but small defined contribution \npension plans filing the Form 5500-SF, as well as any defined contribution pension plans required to file the Form \n5500, Schedule H, would be required to attach the comparison chart required to be disclosed to participants and \nbeneficiaries under the DOL's regulation at 29 CFR 2550.404a-5. Form 5500-SF filers also would continue to be \nrequired to answer a question on total insurance fees and commissions, that parallels the total insurance fee and \ncommission question on Schedule A. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- First, the Schedule \nC would be changed to require reporting of indirect compensation only for ``covered'' service providers and for \ncompensation that is required to be disclosed, as defined in 29 CFR 2550.408b-2(c)(1). The Agencies expect that \nthis change would improve Schedule C reporting because it would essentially require the pension plan \nadministrator to report the actual compensation paid to or received by covered service providers based on the \nexpected compensation included in the 408b-2 disclosures that the service provider furnished to the plan as part of \nthe process of establishing and maintaining the service contract or arrangement with the plan. The instructions \nsimilarly have been clarified to track more closely the language of the 408b-2 regulation. In making this an across-\nthe-board Schedule C change to provide for consistency in the annual return/report requirements, the Agencies \nrecognize that the changes proposed to the Schedule C would also apply to certain welfare plans that are not \nsubject to the 408b-2 regulation. The principal consequence of the proposed changes for those welfare plans is to \nnarrow the classes of service providers that would be required to be reported and more clearly define the types of \ncompensation that must be reported on the Schedule C. Thus, we believe that the proposed changes will be \nimprovement for welfare plan reporting. Another key element of the proposed changes to Schedule C consistent \nwith the final regulations at 29 CFR 2550.408b-2 is the elimination of the reporting concept of ``eligible indirect \ncompensation.'' Under the current reporting rules, the types of indirect compensation that can be treated as \n``eligible indirect compensation'' are fees or expense reimbursement payments charged to investment funds and \nreflected in the value of the investment or return on investment of the participating plan or its participants, finder's \nfees, ``soft dollar'' revenue, float revenue, and/or brokerage commissions or other transaction-based fees for \ntransactions or services involving the plan that were not paid directly by the plan or plan sponsor (whether or not \nthey are capitalized as investment costs). Under the current requirements, rather than disclosing the identity of the \nservice provider and reporting information about the services provided and compensation received by the service \nprovider, the plan administrator must merely confirm that the plan received certain written disclosures that describe: \n(1) The existence of the indirect compensation; (2) the services provided for the indirect compensation or the \npurpose for payment of the indirect compensation; (3) the amount (or estimate) of the compensation or a \ndescription of the formula used to calculate or determine the compensation; and (4) the identity of the party or \nparties paying and receiving the compensation. The GAO has been critical of the concept of ``eligible indirect \ncompensation'' and other limitations on Schedule C reporting of indirect compensation received by plan service \nproviders. See GAO Private Pensions: Additional Changes Could Improve Employee Benefit Plan Financial \nReporting. In its response published with that report, the DOL generally agreed that reporting indirect compensation \non Schedule C should be coordinated with the implementation of new requirements in the then proposed regulation \nunder section 408(b)(2) of ERISA. Part of the reason for the concept of eligible indirect compensation was the \ntiming of the move to the electronic filing system and attendant forms changes relative to the timing of the 408b-2 \nregulation. There is no counterpart to ``eligible indirect compensation'' under 29 CFR 2550.408b-2. In this regard, \nthe proposed Schedule C would eliminate current Line 1 (which enables plans to acknowledge that they had service \nproviders that received only eligible indirect compensation). Current Line 2, used for reporting both direct and \nindirect compensation, would be made new Line 1. To effectuate the elimination of the ``eligible indirect \ncompensation'' reporting concept, there would no longer be a corresponding element to current Line 2(f), which \nasks whether a listed service provider that received other direct or indirect compensation also received eligible \nindirect compensation. [[Page 47552]] In changing the reporting requirements to better track the 408b-2 regulation, \n\n\n\nthe Agencies recognize that part of the reason for having developed the concept of ``eligible indirect compensation'' \nwas concern expressed by commenters that it would be difficult to generate specific dollar amounts at the plan \nlevel, especially in the case of omnibus level charges. In that regard, the proposed Schedule C instructions borrow \nfrom instructions in the Schedule A on determining plan-level allocation of insurance contract fees and \ncommissions. Specifically, the Schedule C instructions permit any reasonable method of allocation to be used to \nestimate plan level fees for the Schedule C, provided the method is disclosed to the plan administrator. This \napproach provides a substantial amount of flexibility for service providers in determining the amounts to report. The \nDOL invites comments on this proposed method for plan level allocation of indirect compensation generated at an \n``omnibus'' level, including whether there are particular types of indirect compensation for which it would be unduly \nexpensive or burdensome to report a dollar amount or estimate at the plan level. To further conform the Schedule C \nreporting rules to the disclosure requirements in 29 CFR 2550.408b-2, filers would be required to report ``covered'' \nservice providers who have received $1,000 or more in total direct and indirect compensation (i.e., money or \nanything else of monetary value in connection with services rendered to the plan or the person's position with the \nplan during the plan year, including payments from participants' accounts). As on the current Schedule C, plans \nwould only need to report other service providers (e.g., an accountant that received only direct compensation) who \nreceived $5,000 or more in direct compensation in connection with services rendered to the plan or the person's \nposition with the plan during the plan year, including payments from participants' accounts. To make reporting of the \ninformation specific to each service provider more straightforward, instead of having repeating line items on \nSchedule C, the proposal would have filers use a separate Schedule C for each service provider required to be \nreported. With this formatting change, the proposed Line 1 of the Schedule C generally would retain the same \nidentifying elements as the current Line 2, with the following changes. Similar to the proposal to amend the \nregulation at 2550.408b- 2, see 79 FR 13949, 13962 (Mar. 14, 2014), this proposal seeks to add to Schedule C a \nrequirement to report contact information for service providers that are not natural persons. Filers would be required \nto identify a person or office, including contact information, that the plan administer may contact with regard to the \ninformation required to be disclosed on the Schedule C. The proposal would also clarify and expand the existing \nquestion that asks the filer to indicate generally whether the service provider has a relationship to the employer, an \nemployee organization, or a person known to be a party-in-interest. The proposal would now state that filers should \nindicate any relationship of the service provider to the plan, for example, employer, plan sponsor, plan sponsor \nemployee, plan employee, named fiduciary, employee organization, and ``Other,'' with a description. With the \nprevalence of revenue sharing arrangements, the Agencies believe that better information on the relationship \nbetween service providers and the plan, various fiduciaries and parties-in-interest, including relationships among \nplan service providers, is important to understand the relationship between compensation and services to the plan. \nUnder the proposal, filers would be required on Schedule C, as in the 408b-2 disclosures for pension plans, to \nindicate (by checking a box) whether the service providers receiving compensation are fiduciaries within the \nmeaning of section 3(21) of ERISA. As noted in the GAO report, GAO Private Pensions: Targeted Revisions Could \nImprove Usefulness Of Form 5500 Information, some filers have expressed confusion about how to answer the \ncurrent question which requires filers to identify both service and fee codes in the same line item, despite the \ninstruction that requires entering all codes that apply. To address this concern and to improve quality of the data, \nthe proposal clarifies the required reporting on the types of services provided and the types of compensation \nreceived by individual service providers by separating the existing compound question into two separate reporting \nelements, one line item to indicate service codes and the other to indicate compensation codes. To minimize both \nburden and potential confusion, filers would need to report service codes for all service providers, regardless of the \ntype of compensation received, but would only have to indicate compensation codes for indirect compensation. A \nnew service type would be added for information technology/ computer support. ``Information technology/computer \nsupport,'' for the purposes of Line 1c, would include computer office automation, information processing, local and \nwide area network support, services supporting hardware, software, telecommunications systems, including \nautomated telephone response systems and systems security. The proposed Schedule C instructions would \ncontinue to permit filers to offset from the total amounts of direct compensation the amounts received from a so-\ncalled ERISA recapture or ERISA budget account or similar account. Because filers are permitted to report a net \nfigure, however, it is not possible to determine whether such an account has been used. With the increasing use of \nsuch accounts, see generally Advisory Opinion 2013-03A (Jul. 3, 2013), DOL believes it is important for the Form \n5500 to indicate whether such accounts are being used as part of the plan's fee and revenue sharing structures. \nThe proposal thus includes a ``Yes''/``No'' question on Schedule C's revised Line 1, to ask whether any such \n\n\n\naccount or arrangement has been used by the plan during the plan year. The proposal would also add a question \nasking whether the service provider arrangement includes recordkeeping services to a plan without explicit \ncompensation for some or all of such recordkeeping services or with compensation for such recordkeeping offset or \nrebated in whole or in part based on other compensation received by the service provider, or an affiliate or \nsubcontractor. If so, the filer would be required, using the same methodology used in the service provider's estimate \nof the cost to the plan of recordkeeping services, to enter as a dollar figure the amount of compensation the service \nprovider received for recordkeeping services. The Agencies believe that this information will better enable a cost \ncomparison in an environment where there are different fee structures and methods of calculating compensation. \nThe proposed Line 1 would also include a data element that asks whether the service provider listed on the \nSchedule C was also identified on Schedule A as having received insurance fees and commissions. Filers are not \nrequired to report on Schedule C insurance fees and commissions that are already reported on Schedule A. The \nquestion is designed to help users of the Form 5500 Annual Return/ Report data identify service providers where \nsome fees and commissions are reported on Schedule A and some on Schedule C. In the proposed Line 2, filers \nwould report direct compensation paid to the service provider by the plan. The [[Page 47553]] Agencies considered \nhaving filers break out payments as follows: Direct payments by a plan out of a plan account, charges to a plan \nforfeiture account, charges to fee recapture accounts, charges to a plan trust account before allocations to \nindividual participant accounts, direct charges to individual participant accounts, and ``Other,'' with a description. \nRather than requiring that detailed breakout on the Schedule C, the Agencies concluded that they could still obtain \na better picture of how the plan pays direct compensation by instead adding a breakout of how participant accounts \nare charged to the Schedule H ``Administrative Expense'' line and requiring information regarding recapture \naccounts in the form of a ``Yes/No'' question on Schedule C. On proposed Line 3, filers would report the total \namount of compensation received by the covered service provider identified in Line 1a in connection with services \nprovided to the plan from sources other than the plan or plan sponsor, including charges against plan investments. \nThe amount of compensation reported would include compensation received by an affiliate or subcontractor in \nconnection with the services rendered to the plan, where the compensation is reported as part of a bundled service \narrangement. Total indirect compensation would now be required to be reported as a dollar amount. The Agencies \nrecognize that service providers accustomed to disclosing fees by way of a formula may not be able to quantify \nexactly the dollar amount of the compensation received during the plan year. Thus, although a dollar amount would \nbe required, the proposal would permit reporting an estimated dollar amount. If the dollar amount is an estimate, the \nfiler still would be required to indicate that a formula was used in determining the actual compensation paid to or \nreceived by the service provider. As with the current Line 3, filers would continue to identify the source(s) of the \nindirect compensation received by the covered service provider identified in Line 1, and would also identify the type \nof fee or compensation. For each source, filers would be required to enter a dollar figure or estimate of the amount \nof compensation, and, if a formula was used to calculate an estimate, a description of the formula. To increase \noverall fee transparency, as well as to identify potential conflicts of interest in related party transactions, a new \nquestion would be added that would require filers to indicate whether the arrangement with each covered service \nprovider required to be reported on Schedule C involved any related party compensation. If ``Yes,'' the filer would \nbe required to indicate the services for which the compensation was paid, the names of the payor(s) and \nrecipient(s) of such compensation, status as an affiliate or subcontractor (indicated by checkbox), and the amount \nof the compensation. To further ensure consistency between 29 CFR 2550.408b-2 and Schedule C, the proposed \nrule would also modify the instructions. The instructions, as proposed, would increase the threshold for reporting \nnon-monetary compensation in Schedule C from $100 to $250. A corresponding change also would be made to the \nSchedule A instructions for reporting fees and commissions. The proposed instructions also would clarify the \nrequirements for reporting the travel or educational expenses of plan employees or trustees, including \nreimbursement, on both Schedule C and Schedule H. This clarification is being made in response to requests for \nfurther guidance following the issuance of Supplemental FAQs About the 2009 Schedule C (available at            \nhttp://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq-sch-C-supplement.html). The FAQs state that for Schedule C purposes, \nreportable compensation includes money and other things of value, such as gifts and trips, received directly or \nindirectly by a person from the plan in connection with services rendered to the plan or the person's position in the \nplan. In addition, they explain that disbursements to a plan trustee for transportation, lodging, meals, and similar \nexpenses incurred while engaging in official plan business are considered reportable compensation. The requests \nfor clarification argued that the DOL should not treat as reportable compensation expense reimbursements that are \nnot treated as taxable under the Code by the IRS. The DOL continues to believe that getting information on the \n\nhttp://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq-sch-C-supplement.html\n\n\nvalue of trustee expenses, including expense reimbursement, is important for compliance purposes. It is persuaded, \nhowever, that amounts that are not taxable to the trustee need not be identified as ``indirect'' compensation. \nTherefore, the instructions would be clarified to provide that trustee and employee expense reimbursements are \nrequired to be reported on Schedule C only if the amounts are taxable compensation for trustees or employees. \nShould trustees receive from the plan travel, education, conferences or similar expenses, or reimbursements \ntherefore, that exceed the limits under the Code, they would have to include them as threshold expenses for \nSchedule C and include the ``fee code'' for ``reimbursement'' when identifying trustee compensation. For reporting \nthose amounts paid for or reimbursed by the plan regardless of whether they are taxable to the trustee, a proposed \nnew breakout line item under the ``administrative expenses'' category would be added to Schedule H to report \naggregate plan expenditures on trustee travel, meetings, education and similar expenses, whether paid directly by \nthe plan or as a reimbursement to trustees.\\23\\ Non-monetary compensation in the form of travel, conferences, \nentertainment, etc., provided by parties other than the plan, that is not de minimis, as defined in the instructions, \nwould continue to be reportable indirect compensation. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\\23\\ The proposed question is similar to a question that was on the Form 5500 prior to 1999. See 1998, Form 5500, \nLine 32g(8). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The proposed Schedule C still would ask \nfilers to identify service providers who fail or refuse to provide information to the filer, including a description of the \ninformation that the service provider failed or refused to provide. The instructions would continue to provide that \nfilers, before identifying a fiduciary or covered service provider as a person who failed or refused to provide \ninformation on indirect compensation, should contact the fiduciary or service provider to request the necessary \ninformation. For these purposes, if a ``covered'' service provider has failed or refused to provide information \nregarding indirect compensation, that service provider would be presumed to meet the $1,000 reporting threshold. \nThe Agencies also continue to believe that it is important to have filers identify the termination of service providers \non the annual return/report. That question, however, would be moved to the Schedule H from the Schedule C to \nassociate it with a new compliance question, described below, asking whether any service providers were \nterminated. Although it would be moved to the Schedule H, the proposal would remain substantially unchanged, \nretaining the requirement to provide information for all terminated accountants and actuaries regardless of the \nreason for termination because of the importance of the involvement of actuaries and accountants in the \npreparation of the annual return/ report. The proposal would change the questions to add a check box for the filer to \nindicate whether it was an accountant or actuary that was terminated. The instructions for this section would also \n[[Page 47554]] be updated to provide a ``Tip'' stating that if the only reason for a change of appointment of an \nenrolled actuary was a temporary leave of absence due to non-work circumstances of the enrolled actuary, the filer \nwould so indicate in the ``explanation'' field. Along with moving the existing Schedule C question on termination of \nactuaries and accountants to the Schedule H, the proposal would also add a question on the Schedule H regarding \nthe termination of any service provider for a material failure to meet the terms of a service arrangement or failure to \ncomply with Title I of ERISA, including the failure to provide required disclosures under 29 CFR 2550.408b-2. \nAlthough not requiring identification of all service providers in all circumstances, the Agencies believe that there are \nservice providers other than actuaries or accountants, such as fiduciaries, recordkeepers, third party administrators, \nand custodians who play a sufficiently important role in plan operations that information on their termination is \nsignificant. The Agencies specifically seek comments on whether the proposed new question should be limited to a \nnarrower class of service providers or specific termination circumstances. C. Better Quality, Accessibility, and \nUsability of Data (Data Mineability) Another key component of the proposal is to make the Form 5500 Annual \nReturn/Report more data mineable and accessible for research, policy analysis, and enforcement purposes. EBSA \nis responsible for collecting the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report, in part, to fulfill the statutory requirements under \nSections 104 and 106 of ERISA, which require that DOL make annual reports filed under Title I of ERISA available \nto the public. Section 504 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, Public Law 109-280 (PPA), requires DOL to \ndisplay certain annual report information on the Internet within 90 days after filing. EBSA must also make the data \nfrom all of the reports filed under Title I of ERISA available to those seeking the information under the Freedom of \nInformation Act (FOIA). EBSA fulfills its FOIA responsibilities by making the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report data \navailable for downloading in bulk (see            http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/foia/foia.html). These bulk data files, which \nEBSA updates at the end of each month with the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report data collected during that \nmonth, are downloaded by private-sector organizations that, in some cases, also make the data available on the \nInternet. Thus, most returns/reports are currently open to public inspection, and the contents are public information \nsubject to publication on the Internet. Mandatory e-filing, which was implemented for the 2009 Form filing year, \n\nhttp://www.dol.gov/ebsa/foia/foia.html\n\n\nstarting January 1, 2010, has changed both the regulated community's and the government's ability to use the Form \n5500 Annual Return/Report data. The data sets developed from e-filing information has been helping researchers, \nbusinesses, and other plan professionals. The Form 5500 Annual Return/Report data sets can be one of the major \nbuilding blocks for a private organization to use in developing information for employees and employers on plan \nadministration. In addition, the government can provide much more timely and complete data as a result of e-filing \nmore cost effectively. For instance, the data sets are posted on the Internet and updated monthly. In addition, the \nimages of the filings (facsimiles) and the scanned and uploaded attachments are made available at no cost to the \nrequester. As indicated in the White House Report of the Task Force on Smart Disclosure, in commenting on the \nForm 5500 Annual Return/Report, ``[s]mart disclosure is also helping employers and employees make decisions \nabout 401(k) and other workplace retirement plans. These data sets can help employees better understand their \nretirement options and employers better understand the quality of the plans they offer, with the help of third parties \nthat analyze the data.'' Id. at 13. The SEC has also acknowledged the importance of innovative approaches to data \ncollection and use, citing its enhanced data mining as the basis for improvements in its enforcement efforts. See \nNew Investigative Approaches and Innovative Use of Data and Analytical Tools Help Drive Successful Enforcement \nYear, SEC, (available at            http://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370543184660). The \nAgencies generally plan to continue the data publication processes currently in place and provide an even more \nrobust Form 5500 Annual Return/Report web-based search application. This application would allow users to \ndevelop more custom queries to better target desired data. Further, this enhanced dissemination service would \ninclude options to download data in various machine-readable and open formats (such as Excel or comma \nseparated value [CSV] files), as specified in the President's Open Data policy. Expanding the downloadable options \nwould facilitate researching and comparing plan information. The dissemination could also support predefined \nqueries presented in a dashboard format to graphically illustrate individual plan performance as well as \nperformance in comparison to plans of similar size or features. Part of the goal of the proposal is to change the \nstructure of the data filed as part of the Form 5500 Annual Return/ Report in order to facilitate those applications \nand expand the use and usefulness of the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report data generally, as well as to make the \nForm 5500 Annual Return/Report a better disclosure tool.\\24\\ -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n---- \\24\\ The Agencies believe that the proposed changes intended to improve the quality of the data, for example, \neliminating compound questions, using simpler language, moving attachments into text fields that show on the face \nof the form or schedule when completed, and adding more definitions and instructions, would also help make the \nForm 5500 Annual Return/Report a more readable disclosure document. The GAO has recommended broadly that \nthe Agencies work to improve the clarity of required disclosures. See generally GAO Private Pensions: Clarity of \nRequired Reports and Disclosures Could Be Improved. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. \nStructured Data Attachments A critical way in which the Agencies propose to enhance the mineability of the Form \n5500 Annual Return/Report data is by structuring and standardizing the schedules required to be attached to the \nform. Currently, for example, the Line 4i attachments to Schedule H (Schedule of Assets Held for Investment at End \nof Year, Schedule of Assets Disposed of During Plan Year and the Schedule of Reportable Transactions) cannot be \nsearched electronically because they currently are not filed in a standardized electronic format. As a result, \npolicymakers, the Agencies, and the public have difficulty accessing key information about the plan's investments. \nThe Agencies' proposal to standardize the Schedule H, Line 4i Schedules of Investments is intended to be \nresponsive to the OIG's recommendation that the Agencies create a searchable reporting format for the Schedule \nH, Line 4i Schedules of Assets and otherwise increase the accessibility of Form 5500 Annual Return/Report \ninformation, particularly information on hard-to value assets and multiple-employer plans. See DOL-OIG EBSA \nNeeds to Provide Additional Guidance and Oversight to ERISA Plans Holding Hard-To-Value Alternative \nInvestments, at 17. See also Private Pensions: Targeted Revisions Could Improve Usefulness of Form 5500 \nInformation, at 37; see also U.S. Gov't Accountability Office, GAO-12- 665, Federal Agencies Should Collect Data \nAnd Coordinate Oversight of Multiple Employer Plans (2012), at 30. [[Page 47555]] Other currently unstructured \ndata or new elements would also be collected as structured data under the proposal, including the lists of \nemployers participating in multiple-employer and controlled group plan members required to be attached to the \nForm 5500 Annual Return/Report or Form 5500-SF; the Schedule H, Line 4a Schedule of Delinquent Contributions; \nand the Line 4j Schedule of Reportable Transactions. The proposal also would eliminate the instructions for \nSchedule A that permit filing as an attachment ``appropriate schedules of current rates filed with the appropriate \nstate insurance department or by providing a statement regarding the basis of the rates in an attachment, in lieu of \ncompleting information on ``Contracts With Allocated Funds.'' The instructions would instead direct the filer to enter \n\nhttp://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370543184660\n\n\na statement regarding the basis of the rates into an open text field on the Schedule A. Information on contracts with \nallocated contracts would therefore be completed on the Schedule A as structured data. The Agencies specifically \ninvite comments as to whether entering a statement in an open text field on the Schedule A, relative to attaching a \nrate schedule(s) or statement regarding the basis of the rates, would create a significant burden or make it difficult \nto provide accurate information. 2. Move Information Collection From Attachments to Open Text Fields on Face of \nForms and Schedules This proposal also increases the accessibility of data by replacing some of the attachments \nto the schedules with text fields. Similar to the proposed specific data elements for the Schedule H Line 4i \nSchedules, which replace the existing suggested format for an unstructured attachment, the Agencies believe that \nshifting to use of text fields on the face of the schedules instead of having information be supplied in non-standard \nattachments concentrates information on the Form 5500 and the schedules and thus improves data mineability. For \nthe Schedule G (Financial Transaction Schedules), the nonspecific requirement to provide ``detailed descriptions'' \nin an open text field, including a variety of elements to report loans and leases in default or uncollectible, has been \nreplaced with individual questions on each of the elements originally required to be in the detailed description. In \naddition, attachments to the Schedule G in the form of ``Overdue Loan Explanation'' and ``Overdue Lease \nExplanation'' for loans and leases that are overdue or uncollectible would be replaced with open data fields on the \nface of the Schedule G. The purpose of these changes would be to standardize the information, to make the data \nless subject to individual variation where unwarranted, to simplify reporting on the Schedule G transactions for \nfilers, and to make it easier to search and use the data. The Agencies also are proposing expanded data elements \non the actuarial schedules (Schedules MB and SB), including information previously reported on PDF attachments. \nUnder the proposal, single- employer and multiemployer plans that are currently required to provide a Schedule of \nActive Participant Data as a PDF attachment would be required to input the data into Schedules MB and SB. \nSupplemental information required by enrolled actuaries who have not fully reflected regulatory requirements under \nERISA or the Code in completing the Schedule MB or SB would be reported on the schedules rather than on PDF \nattachments. A number of questions on the Schedule SB would be required to be reported on the schedule rather \nthan on PDF attachments. This would include reporting of information on the plan's late election to apply funding \nbalances to quarterly installments; an adjustment to the amount of the credit balance reported in the prior year in \nthe first year a plan is subject to the minimum funding requirements of Code section 430 or ERISA section 303; use \nof multiple mortality tables and substitute mortality tables; a change in non-prescribed actuarial assumptions and a \nmethod change for the current plan year; and a schedule of amortization bases. The Agencies also propose to \nconsolidate certain data reported on the Schedule SB on PDF or other similar attachments. The discounted \nemployer contribution PDF attachment would be consolidated with the list of contributions currently included on the \nSchedule SB. Also, for plans in at-risk status for the current plan year, the PDF attachment describing the at-risk \nassumptions for the assumed form of payment would be consolidated with the attachment describing the other \nactuarial assumptions. Withdrawal liability payments will be reported separately from plan year contributions on the \nSchedule MB. In addition, for both Schedules SB and MB, the schedule of all amortization bases currently filed as a \nPDF attachment would be consolidated with the schedule of new amortization bases. New questions would be \nadded requiring multiemployer plans and single-employer plans that input data into the Schedule of Active \nParticipant Data to report on the Schedules MB and SB the average age of active participants, and the average \ncredited service of active participants as of the valuation date. Also, multiemployer plans and single-employer plans \nthat have retired participants and beneficiaries as of the valuation date and terminated vested participants as of the \nvaluation date would be required to input data into two new schedules on Schedules MB and SB--the Schedule of \nRetired Participants and Beneficiaries Receiving Payment Data and the Schedule of Terminated Vested Participant \nData. This information on retired participants and beneficiaries and terminated vested participants would be \nreported according to age bracket, but information would not be required to be reported for an age grouping \nconsisting of 10 or fewer participants. Additionally, all plans would report the average age and average in-pay \nannual benefit for retired participants and beneficiaries receiving payment. Plans with terminated vested participants \nwould report the average age and average annual benefit, and assumed form of payment and the assumed first \nage of payment. Expanding the data elements to require that new information and information previously reported \non PDF attachments be reported in a data mineable format would allow for more refined projections of the financial \npositions of multiemployer and single-employer plans. This is especially critical for PBGC's multiemployer program, \nas well as for its single-employer program. Information reported in a data mineable format would also facilitate more \nrefined projections and calculations for individual plans. Computer programs could be written to read the data and \nprovide estimated funding calculations and projections for plans. This would provide information essential to the \n\n\n\nAgencies' enforcement efforts and for their ability to target plans with likely compliance issues. Furthermore, the \navailability of the data would assist private-sector auditors and auditors in validating a plan actuary's calculations. \nThe data would also provide new opportunities for research. Currently, there is no source of system-wide data on \ndefined benefit pension plan participants with age, service, and average benefit levels. The availability of such data \nwould allow for more refined projections of future coverage and benefits adequacy for plan participants and \nbeneficiaries. As more of this data is collected over the years, the data could be analyzed to identify trends in plan \ncoverage and benefits. [[Page 47556]] Also, proposed system-wide changes in legislation and regulations could be \nmore effectively modeled. As discussed in more detail below, the Agencies also propose to allow the plan actuary \nto sign Schedules MB and SB electronically. The plan actuary can access the EFAST2 Web site at            \nwww.efast.dol.gov to register for electronic credentials to sign or submit filings. 3. Plan Characteristics Codes and \nOther Identifying Codes Replaced With Yes/No Questions and Checkboxes on Face of Forms In addition, the use \nof ``codes'' appearing in the instructions would be limited and refined to the extent feasible. New ``Yes''/``No'' and \ncheck box questions would replace most Form 5500 and Form 5500-SF questions that currently require filers to list \nPlan Characteristics Codes. These changes are intended to refine how data will be collected and overlay all of the \nother changes being proposed here. On the Schedule C, rather than entering, multiple codes to identify both types \nof fees/compensation and kinds of services, the filer would check as many boxes as are applicable to indicate all \ntypes of services for each provider identified. In another element that is for reporting only sources of compensation \nfrom parties other than the plan or plan sponsor, filers will separately indicate all types of fees/ compensation. This \nis intended to improve the quality of the data, and make the Schedule C easier to read from a disclosure \nperspective. It is also intended to address concerns raised by the GAO about the fee and service codes. See GAO \nPrivate Pensions: Targeted Revisions Could Improve Usefulness of Form 5500 Information, at 27. Comments are \nspecifically invited regarding whether additional or different types of services or fees should be listed in order to \nimprove the picture of service providers to the plan. 4. Compound Questions Separated The Agencies would \nseparate out reporting for the various types of direct filing entities to make clearer what the precise reporting \nrequirements are for each type of entity. They would also clarify the instructions to the forms and schedules by \nseparating compound questions. In this regard, the Agencies recognize that putting one question on each line \nrather than asking filers to complete multiple subsections, while streamlining the completion process, would \nnevertheless make some schedules appear longer, even though no additional information is actually required to be \nreported. This is particularly evident for Schedules C and G, both of which currently contain multiple compound \nquestions. 5. More Detailed Identifiers, Instructions, and Definitions The proposal adds clarifying definitions and \ninstructions to improve the consistency of responses. For example, the proposal clarifies conventions for identifying \nfilers by name and identifying number(s). The proposal also requires plans to use legal entity and other industry and \nregulatory identifiers whenever possible. These changes are intended to help the Agencies compare plan \nparticipation, investment options, and investment performance from year-to-year. It should also help mitigate \nconfusion about the legal entities with which the plan transacts. These changes are intended to address the \nconcerns raised by the GAO in recommending that ``the Agencies develop a central repository for Employer \nIdentification Numbers (EINs) and Plan Numbers (PNs) for filers and service providers to improve the comparability \nof form data across filings.'' GAO Private Pensions: Targeted Revisions Could Improve Usefulness of Form 5500 \nInformation, at 37. The proposal would add more explicit instructions, for example, on reporting delinquent \nparticipant contributions and completing the Line 4i Schedules of Assets. In addition, because filers would be asked \nto identify plan characteristics and type through questions on the face of the Form 5500/5500-SF instead of using \ncodes in the instructions, there are proposed instructions for various questions in this information category. These \ndefinitional changes and additions are intended to help ensure that data would be reported consistently and would \nbe more accessible, thus improving the usefulness of the data. D. New Group Health Plan Reporting Requirements \nand Information The DOL proposes to expand reporting to all employee benefit plans providing group health \nbenefits, including plans that claim grandfathered status and retiree-only plans.\\25\\ Currently, generally most plans \nthat provide group health benefits that have fewer than 100 participants meet the conditions in existing regulations \nat 29 CFR 2520.104-20 to be exempt from the requirement to file the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report because \nthey are fully insured, unfunded, or a combination of unfunded and insured.\\26\\ Although there may be sources of \naggregate estimates regarding group health plans, the current lack of plan level information for employee benefit \nplans that provide group health benefits, especially those that have fewer than 100 participants, complicates not \nonly DOL's ability to enforce regulations, but also diminishes the effectiveness and efficacy of EBSA's ability to \ndevelop health care regulations. The Affordable Care Act also requires the Secretary of Labor to provide Congress \n\nhttp://www.efast.dol.gov/\n\n\nwith an annual report, see, e.g., ``Self-Insured Health Benefit Plans 2015,'' \\27\\ containing general information on \nself-insured employee health benefit plans and financial information regarding employers that sponsor such plans. \nThat report is supposed to be based on data contained in the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report. However, as noted \nabove, many self-insured health benefit plans currently are not required to file annually with the DOL and, even for \nthose that do file, the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report currently collects only limited information. ------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------- \\25\\ All ``group health plans'' that meet the definition in 733(a) of the Act, \nincluding plans that claim ``grandfathered'' status under 29 CFR 2950.715-1251, would be required to file a Form \n5500 and applicable schedules, including the proposed Schedule J, regardless of whether such plans are exempt \nfrom certain market reform requirements under ERISA Sec. 732(a) (exemption for certain small group health plans \nthat have less than two participants who are current employees) or ERISA Sec. 733(c) (group health plans \nconsisting solely of excepted benefits). Employee welfare benefit plans as defined in ERISA Sec. 3(1) that do not \nmeet the definition of ``group health plan'' under 733 of the Act (i.e., they do not provide medical care) are not \nsubject to the proposed enhanced reporting requirements applicable to group health plans. \\26\\ ERISA 733(a) \ndefines a ``group health plan'' as ``. . . an employee welfare benefit plan to the extent that the plan provides medical \ncare (as defined in paragraph (2) and including items and services paid for as medical care) to employees or their \ndependents (as defined under the terms of the plan) directly or through insurance, reimbursement, or otherwise.'' \n(Emphasis added). ERISA 3(1) defines an ``employee welfare benefit plan'' as ``any plan, fund or program which \nwas . . . established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization . . . to the extent that such plan, \nfund or program was established or is maintained for the purpose of providing for its participants or their \nbeneficiaries . . . medical, surgical, or hospital care or benefits.'' \\27\\ Available on the DOL's Web site at:            \n\nbe required to answer only certain questions on the Form 5500 and on the Schedule J. This limited filing, which \nwould be similar in scope to the limited pension plan reporting for plans established under section 408 of the Code \nthat requires such plans to complete certain Form 5500 questions and no schedules, see, e.g., 2015 Form 5500 \nInstructions, Limited Pension Plan Reporting, is intended to serve as an annual registration statement with basic \nidentifying and insurance information. The DOL considered whether to have small, fully insured group health plans \nfile a separate registration statement either annually or based on certain events following the establishment of the \nplan (e.g., initial, final, change in insurance carrier). However, we believe that it will be less burdensome to have \nsuch plans file limited information through EFAST2, using the Form 5500, particularly for those small employers that \nalready use the system to report for their pension plans. Comments are specifically solicited in this regard. In \naddition, sections 2715A and 2717 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), as added by the Affordable Care \nAct, established new reporting requirements for non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers \noffering non-grandfathered group or individual health insurance coverage.\\30\\ The DOL is considering whether a \ngroup health plan could satisfy its reporting obligations under PHS Act section 2715A and 2717, as incorporated \ninto section 715(a)(1) of ERISA, by filing a completed Form 5500 and Schedule J, and providing that information to \nthe parties as required under PHS Act section 2715A and 2717 (generally HHS, DOL, Treasury, State insurance \ncommissioners, enrollees and the public).\\31\\ Much of the information required to be reported under PHS Act \nsections 2715A and 2717, for example, data on enrollment, claims payment policies and practices, and claims \ndenials is information that is to be included in the proposed Schedule J. In an effort to reduce duplicative reporting \nand the attendant costs to plans subject to ERISA, the DOL is specifically soliciting comments on the feasibility of \nsuch an approach as a means of compliance with PHS Act sections 2715A and 2717 as incorporated into section \n715(a)(1) of ERISA.\\32\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\30\\ Section 2715A of the PHS \nAct extends the transparency reporting provisions set forth in section 1311(e)(3) of the Affordable Care Act \n(applicable to issuers of ``qualified health plans'' offered through Exchanges) to non-grandfathered group health \nplans and health insurance issuers offering non-grandfathered group or individual health insurance coverage. In \nparticular, section 1311(e)(3) of the Affordable Care Act requires disclosure of: claims payment policies and \npractices, periodic financial disclosures, and information on enrollment, disenrollment, number of denied claims, \nrating practices, out-of-network cost-sharing and payments, rights under title I of the Affordable Care Act, and other \ninformation as determined appropriate by the Secretary of Health and Human Services Section 2717 of the PHS \nAct requires non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers offering non-grandfathered group \nor individual health insurance coverage to report on quality of care metrics, for example, reporting on effective case \nmanagement, care coordination, chronic disease management, and medication and care compliance initiatives. \nAlthough sections 2715A and 2717 of the PHS Act do not apply to grandfathered group health plans, the proposal \nis to require all group health plans subject to ERISA, including grandfathered group health plans, to file Schedule J. \n\\31\\ Nonfederal governmental plans (as defined in PHS Act section 2791(d)(8)(C)) and health insurance issuers (as \ndefined in PHS Act section 2791(b)(2) and ERISA section 733(b)(2)) are not required to file annual reports pursuant \nto ERISA sections 103 or 104. Accordingly, any reporting required of such plans and issuers to satisfy PHS Act \nsections 2715A and 2717 will be addressed separately by HHS in future rulemakings and/or guidance. \\32\\ \nSections 2715A and 2717 of the PHS Act are also incorporated into section 9815(a)(1) of the Code. The Treasury \nDepartment and the IRS intend to publish proposed regulations in 26 CFR 54.9815-2715A and 54.9815-2717 \nclarifying that group health plans required to file an annual report pursuant to section 104 of ERISA that comply with \nthe reporting requirements in 29 CFR 2520.103-1 (including filing any required schedules to the annual report) \nwould satisfy the reporting requirements of sections 2715A and 2717 of the PHS Act, as incorporated in the Code. \nGroup health plans that are not required to file an annual report pursuant to section 104 of ERISA but that are \nsubject to sections 2715A and 2717 of the PHS Act as incorporated in the Code, will not be required to do any \nreporting to comply with sections 2715A and 2717 of the PHS Act, as incorporated in the Code, unless and until the \nTreasury Department and the IRS issue subsequent further guidance or rulemaking regarding any such reporting \nby such plans. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. New Schedule J (Group Health Plan \nInformation) The proposed Schedule J (Group Health Plan Information) would report information about group health \nplan operations and ERISA compliance, plus compliance with certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act.\\33\\ \nGroup health plans that are part of a GIA and subject to the exemption from filing under 29 CFR 2520.104-43 would \nnot be required to file the Schedule J. A GIA's Form 5500 Annual Return/Report filing, [[Page 47558]] however, \nwould have to include a separate Schedule J for each group health plan participating in the GIA. -------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------- \\33\\ The Schedule J does not relate to the employer shared responsibility \n\n\n\nprovisions under section 4980H of the Code, the related reporting requirements under section 6056 of the Code, or \nthe reporting requirements for providers of minimum essential coverage under section 6055 of the Code. --------------\n------------------------------------------------------------- The proposed Schedule J would collect information on the \ncharacteristics of the plan that is providing group health benefits, including the approximate number of participants \nand beneficiaries covered under the plan at the end of the plan year, and the number of persons offered and \nreceiving coverage under the plan through COBRA, Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (Pub. \nL. 99-272, 100 Stat. 82), 29 U.S.C. 1161, et seq., whether the plan offers coverage for employees, spouses, \nchildren, and/or retirees, and what type of group health benefits are offered under the plan, for example, \nmedical/surgical, pharmacy or prescription drug, mental health/ substance use disorder, wellness program, \npreventive care, vision, dental, or various other types of benefits. With respect to the collection of COBRA coverage \ninformation, the DOL requests comments regarding the costs and feasibility of providing this data, whether the \nproposed data elements would effectively show the annual take up rate and the total number of participants electing \nCOBRA coverage, and whether any additional data elements regarding COBRA coverage would be helpful for the \nregulated community to evaluate COBRA's impact on plans and participants. The DOL also proposes that plans \nthat provide group health benefits provide information on whether their health plan funding and benefit arrangement \nis through a health insurance issuer and whether benefits are paid through a trust or from the general assets of the \nemployer. Schedule J would also ask whether there were participant and/or employer contributions.\\34\\ With \nrespect to plans that use a prototype health insurance policy or arrangement (sometimes referred to as ``off- the-\nshelf'' plans/policies), the DOL is also requesting that such plans provide, if applicable, the relevant unique \nidentifying information (such as a state assigned policy identification number) of the prototype/off-the-shelf policy or \narrangement. The DOL requests comments on this proposed data element and whether there are specific health \ninsurance policy identification systems employed by States or issuers that would most accurately and cost \neffectively provide information about usage of such policies to provide plan benefits. -----------------------------------------\n---------------------------------- \\34\\ For purposes of Schedule J reporting, ``participant contributions'' include all elective \ncontributions under a cafeteria plan (arrangement under Code section 125.). ---------------------------------------------------\n------------------------ Additionally, plans that provide group health benefits are asked to report whether one or more of \nthe plan's benefit package options are claiming grandfathered status under the Affordable Care Act,\\35\\ whether the \nplan is a high deductible health plan,\\36\\ a health flexible spending account (FSA) (or includes a health FSA as a \ncomponent), or a health reimbursement arrangement (HRA) \\37\\ (or includes an HRA as a component). Please \nnote that due to PHS Act section 2711 (prohibition on annual dollar limits) and 2713 (preventive services \nrequirements), HRAs that are subject to the market reforms (that is, those that cover two or more active employees \nand do not consist solely of excepted benefits) are considered to comply with the annual dollar limit prohibition and \npreventive service requirement if the HRA is ``integrated'' with another group health plan that complies with the \nannual dollar limit prohibition and the preventive services requirement.\\38\\ ------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------- \\35\\ ``Grandfathered'' health plans generally are those that were in existence on March 23, 2010, \nand haven't been changed in ways that substantially cut benefits or increase costs for participants. For regulations \naddressing grandfathered status, see 29 CFR 2950.715-1251. \\36\\ A ``high deductible health plan'' is defined under \nsection 223(c)(2) of the Code and generally is a plan that has a higher annual deductible than a typical health \ninsurance plan and a maximum limit on the sum of the annual deductible and out-of-pocket medical expenses that \nan enrollee must pay for covered expenses. \\37\\ An HRA typically consists of a promise by an employer to \nreimburse medical expenses, including insurance premiums, for the year up to a certain amount, with unused \namounts available to reimburse medical expenses in future years. See IRS Notice 2002-45. \\38\\ An HRA is a group \nhealth plan and is subject to the market reforms, including the prohibition of annual dollar limits for essential health \nbenefits and the requirement to provide coverage of certain recommended preventive services without cost sharing. \nRegulations addressing these annual and lifetime limit prohibitions state that a stand-alone HRA offered to active \nemployees violates these prohibitions but that an ``integrated'' HRA does not violate the annual limits prohibition, as \nlong as other group health plan coverage offered with the integrated HRA complies with the market requirements. \nSee 80 FR 72192 at 72261 (Nov. 18, 2015) and DOL Technical Release 2013-03 (Sept. 13, 2013) for a description \nof the lifetime and annual limit requirements applicable to HRAs, including the ``integration'' requirements. ------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------- The proposed Schedule J also would ask whether the plan \nreceived rebates, refunds, or reimbursements from a service provider such as a medical loss ratio (MLR) rebate \nunder the Affordable Care Act and offset rebates from favorable claims experience. If so, filers would be required to \nreport the type of service provider, the amount received and how the rebates were used (e.g., returned to \n\n\n\nparticipants, premium holiday, payment of benefits, or other). In addition, the proposed Schedule J would request \nthat group health plans identify any service providers to the plan (not already reported on Schedule A (Insurance \nInformation) or Schedule C (Service Provider Information)) by providing the name, address, telephone number, \nemployer identification number, and, if applicable, the National Insurance Producer Registry--National Producer \nNumber (NPN) as established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). Such service \nproviders include a third party administrator/claims processor, including an issuer subject to an ``administrative \nservices only (ASO)'' contract, mental health benefits manager, wellness program manager,\\39\\ substance use \ndisorder benefits manager, pharmacy benefit manager/drug provider, or independent review organization. Schedule \nJ also asks for the total premium payment made for any ``stop loss'' coverage, as well as information on the \nattachment points of coverage, individual claim limits, and/or the aggregate claim limit contained in the policy. --------\n------------------------------------------------------------------- \\39\\ A ``wellness program'' is defined in 29 CFR 2590.702(f) to \ninclude ``any program designed to promote health or prevent disease'' and includes programs that condition \nbenefits (including cost-sharing mechanisms) or the premium or employer contribution amounts on an individual \nsatisfying a standard that is related to a health factor as well as those programs that do not include conditions for \nobtaining a reward that are based on an individual satisfying a standard that is related to a health factor. ---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------ For group health plans that are not required to complete a Schedule \nH (generally, fully insured, unfunded plans, or combination insured/ unfunded plans), the proposal would require \nthat information regarding employer and participant contributions be reported on the Schedule J, including employer \ncontributions received, participant contributions received, employer contributions receivable, participant \ncontributions receivable, other contributions received or receivable (including non- cash contributions) and the total \nof all contributions. Filers would also be required to report whether there was a failure to timely transmit participant \ncontributions to the plan. The proposed Schedule J also would seek claims payment data, including information on \nhow many post-service benefit claims (benefit claims) were submitted during the plan year, how many benefit \nclaims were approved during the plan year, how many benefit claims were denied during the plan [[Page 47559]] \nyear,\\40\\ how many benefit claim denials were appealed during the plan year, how many appealed claims were \nupheld as denials, how many were payable after appeal, and whether there were any claims for benefits that were \nnot adjudicated within the required timeframes. The proposed Schedule J would also seek data on how many pre-\nservice claims were appealed during the plan year, and how many of those appeals were upheld during the plan \nyear as denials and how many were approved during the plan year after appeal. With respect to group health plans, \nthe DOL claims procedure regulation subdivides claims for benefits into various categories, including pre-service \nand post-service claims. A pre-service claim is defined as any claim for a benefit under a group health plan with \nrespect to which the terms of the plan condition receipt of the benefit, in whole or in part, on approval of the benefit \nin advance of obtaining medical care. A post-service claim is defined as any claim for a benefit under a group health \nplan that is not a pre- service claim. See 29 CFR 2560.503-1(m). As used throughout this proposal, ``claims'' \nincludes both pre-service and post-service claims. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\40\\ A \ndenial as referenced in this notice is given the same meaning as ``adverse benefit determination'' as defined in 29 \nCFR 2560.503-1(m)(4). Accordingly, a denial or adverse benefit determination is a denial, reduction, or termination \nof, or a failure to provide or make payments (in whole or in part) for, a benefit, including any such denial, reduction, \ntermination, or failure to provide or make payment that is based on a determination of a participant's or beneficiary's \neligibility to participate in a plan, and including, with respect to group health plans, a denial, reduction, or termination \nof, or a failure to provide or make payment (in whole or in part) for, a benefit resulting from the application of any \nutilization review, as well as a failure to cover an item or service for which benefits are otherwise provided because \nit is determined to be experimental or investigational or not medically necessary or appropriate. --------------------------\n------------------------------------------------- In addition, plans would be asked to report whether the plan was unable to \npay claims at any time during the plan year and, if so, the number of unpaid claims. Plans would also be asked to \nreport the total dollar amount of claims paid during the plan year, and if the plan provides benefits through an \ninsurance policy, to identify any delinquent payments to the insurance carrier within the time required by the carrier, \nand whether any delinquencies resulted in a lapse in coverage. The proposal would add a similar question to \nSchedule A; delinquencies identified on Schedule A would not need to be reported again on Schedule J. In an effort \nto collect more robust data on claims adjudication practices and policies, the DOL is considering, in addition to the \ninformation requested in the new Schedule J, whether to require plans to report more information on denied claims, \nsuch as the dollar amount of claims that were denied during the plan year, the denial code, and/ or whether the \nclaims were for mental health and substance use disorder benefits or for medical/surgical benefits. Proposed \n\n\n\nSchedule J requires plans to report the dollar value of claims paid during the plan year. Analyzing this data in terms \nof claims adjudication practices would be limited if the dollar amount of claims denied during a plan year is not also \nreported. The DOL understands, however, that reporting information on denied claims may present definitional and \ndata classification challenges, e.g., possible need for a more uniform classification of denial codes for Form 5500 \nAnnual Return/Report reporting than may currently be in place across plans and issuers. In addition, there may be a \nneed to establish a uniform measure for ``dollar amount,'' for example, should it be based on a provider's point-of-\nservice fees, the schedule of fees the plan has negotiated with service providers, Medicare reimbursement rates, or \nstate-published prevailing fees, or some other ``reasonable'' method for determining the dollar amount of denied \nclaims. Therefore, the DOL is specifically seeking public comments on whether this is reasonable information to \ncollect and, if so, the methodology a plan would employ to determine and report the ``dollar amount of claims \ndenied'' during a plan year, denial code, and type of claim. Further, as noted above, the Notice of Proposed \nRulemaking that is being published with this Notice includes proposed conforming amendments in 29 CFR \n2590.715-2715A and 29 CFR 2590.715-2717 to clarify that compliance with the proposed annual reporting \nrequirements by plans subject to ERISA that provide group health benefits would satisfy the reporting requirements \nunder PHS Act sections 2715A and 2717 incorporated in ERISA through ERISA section 715(a)(1). The DOL is \nspecifically seeking public comments in this Notice on the proposed annual reporting requirements for plans that \nprovide group health benefits, including the new Schedule J, in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision in \nGobeille v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 136 S.Ct. 936 (2016). The proposed Schedule J would also request \ncompliance information from plans providing group health benefits. The proposed compliance section of the \nSchedule J asks if all plan assets were held in trust, held by an insurance company qualified to do business in a \nState, or as insurance contracts or policies issued by such an insurance company consistent with section 403 of \nERISA and 29 CFR 2550.403a-1 and 2550.403b-1, whether plan assets are not held in trust based on reliance on \nTechnical Release 92-01, whether the plan's summary plan description (SPD) and summaries of any material \nmodifications (SMM), and summary of benefits and coverage (SBC) are in compliance with the applicable content \nrequirements, whether coverage provided by the plan is in compliance with applicable federal laws and the DOL's \nregulations thereunder, which may include the portability and nondiscrimination provisions of the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act of 1996, Title I of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, the \nMental Health Parity Act of 1996, the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity \nAct of 2008, the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act of 1996, the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act \nof 1998, Michelle's Law, and the Affordable Care Act. The DOL believes that self-reporting compliance information \nwill help inform future compliance studies. Furthermore, the DOL believes that the inclusion of such compliance \nquestions will encourage plans to evaluate whether or not they meet the group health plan requirements of ERISA, \npotentially increasing the voluntary compliance by ERISA plans. Finally, the DOL would move the current questions \non the Form 5500 that ask all welfare plans to report on whether they are subject to, and if so, have complied with \nthe Form M-1 filing requirements, to the Schedule J.\\41\\ This would limit these questions to welfare plans that \nprovide group health benefits. Form 5500/Schedule J filers that must file the Form M-1 would not be required to \nanswer on the Schedule J those compliance questions answered on the Form M-1. ------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------- \\41\\ Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangements that provide health benefits must file the M-\n1 with the Department. The M-1 questions, which would be unchanged under the proposal, ask whether the plan \nwas subject to the Form M-1 filing requirements during the plan year, whether the plan is currently in compliance \nwith the Form M-1 filing requirements, and for the filer to provide the Receipt Confirmation Code for the most recent \nForm M-1 that was required to be filed under the Form M-1 filing requirements. ------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------- [[Page 47560]] 2. Limited Form 5500 Annual Return/Report Reporting for Small, Fully Insured \nGroup Health Plans The DOL proposes to eliminate the current exemption from filing for small, fully insured group \nhealth plans and proposes to require only a very limited Form 5500/Schedule J filing. As noted above, the DOL has \nnot previously collected annual report data on small welfare plans that qualify for the exemption under the \nregulations at 29 CFR 2520.104-20. For small fully insured plans that provide health benefits, the DOL is proposing \nto replace that exemption with a new limited exemption as an alternative form of reporting. Specifically, these small \nplans would be required to complete Lines 1-5, i.e. basic identifying information, on the Form 5500, and Lines 1-8 \non Schedule J, i.e., basic participation, coverage, insurance company, and benefit information. Requiring small, fully \ninsured plans that provide group health benefits to file very rudimentary identifying and health benefit and coverage \ninformation would ensure that the DOL obtains basic information on all ERISA covered group health plans. Because \nthese small, fully insured group health plans are subject to separate regulatory oversight indirectly by reason of \n\n\n\nstate insurance regulation of the insurance provider and insurance contract, the DOL is seeking only basic plan and \ninsurance information to be filed annually and is not seeking the broader Schedule J annual information requested \nof small self-insured and large plans regarding plan administration and benefits. This information would allow the \nDOL to track total health plan counts, and coordinate its enforcement efforts relating to plans providing benefits \nthrough common issuers. For example, fully-insured plans using the same insurance provider often have \ndocuments containing provisions that are similar. Through these new filings, the DOL would be able to better \nidentify those plans that may be affected by noncompliant provisions and better coordinate its enforcement efforts \nwith affected service providers and other Federal and State agencies. Also, this information would enhance the \nDOL's policy analysis and research with respect to participant trends. E. Proposed Changes To Enhance \nCompliance and Oversight One of the critical purposes of the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report is to promote \ncompliance both by requiring plan administrators to review particular aspects of plan operations in order to meet \ntheir annual reporting requirement and by enabling the Agencies to review basic plan compliance issues in an \nefficient manner. Accordingly, the Agencies propose adding a series of compliance questions on the Form 5500 \nand on the Form 5500-SF, and also the Form 5500-SUP for those filers who are not subject to the IRS electronic \nfiling mandate in 26 CFR 301.6058-2 and elect to answer these questions on a paper return. 1. IRS-Only Changes \na. IRS-Only Questions for 2016 Plan Years and Form 5500-SUP For certain years prior to 2009, the Schedules E, \nP, SSA, and T were required to be filed to meet annual return requirements under the Code and IRS regulations, \nbut they were not information collections of the DOL or the PBGC. The DOL electronic filing mandate applied \nbeginning with the 2009 Form 5500 Annual Return/Report and resulted in the last of these ``IRS-only'' schedules \nbeing dropped from the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report because the IRS could not mandate that these schedules \nbe filed electronically. As ``IRS-only'' schedules, they were not covered by the DOL electronic filing requirement. \nAccordingly, with the exception of a limited number of questions on the Schedule E that were relocated to the \nSchedule R, the questions on these schedules were no longer included on the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report. \nThe questions were either eliminated altogether or, in the case of questions on the Schedule SSA, added to a new \nIRS form, Form 8955-SSA, Annual Registration Statement Identifying Separated Participants With Deferred Vested \nBenefits. The 2011 TIGTA report, The Employee Plans Function Should Continue Its Efforts to Obtain Needed \nRetirement Plan Information, notes that the lack of information contained on Schedules E, P, and T can negatively \nimpacts the IRS's ability to effectively focus on specific factors of noncompliance when selecting retirement plans \nfor examination. This lack of information may result in the IRS selecting relatively compliant plans, which increases \nthe burden on these plans and affects the IRS's ability to identify and focus on potentially noncompliant plans. This \ncould result in participants receiving an incorrect amount of benefits. The IRS has decided to make changes to the \nForm 5500 Annual Return/Report to address these issues. The IRS added IRS-only compliance questions to the \n2015 Form 5500 and the 2015 Form 5500-SF, but subsequently directed filers not to answer the questions for \n2015. The IRS is modifying some of these questions and intends to make these IRS-only questions mandatory on \nthe 2016 Form 5500 and Form 5500-SF. See the Federal Register Notice ``Proposed Collection; Comment \nRequest for the Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan'' published by the IRS on March 31, 2016 (81 FR \n18687). Other IRS-only questions may be added prior to the form year in which the EFAST2 contract recompete \nand other forms revisions are implemented. Regardless of the timing of implementation of any of the IRS-only \nquestions on the annual return, any comments received in response to this notice with respect to these questions \nwill be considered in future revisions of these forms. The IRS added to the 2016 forms and schedules various \nquestions related to common compliance problems that will make it easier for the IRS to administer the filing \nprogram. Two of the IRS-only questions added for 2016 are questions that were optional on the 2014 Form 5500 \nand 2014 Form 5500-SF. Both 2014 forms request information regarding the preparer of the annual return/report \nand the plan's trust. IRS intends that both the 2016 Form 5500 and the 2016 Form 5500-SF include a box in the \nsignature block of the form for information regarding the preparer's name and address. Similarly, line 6 of both \nSchedules H and I of the 2016 Form 5500 Annual Return/Report, and line 14 of the 2016 Form 5500-SF, would \nrequest information regarding the name of the plan's trust, the trust's employer identification number (EIN), the \nname of the trustee or custodian, and the trustee or custodian's telephone number. This information will enable the \nIRS to more efficiently monitor the compliance of the retirement plan trusts exempt from tax under Code section \n501(a). The IRS also included several other compliance questions on the 2016 Forms 5500 and 5500-SF that are \naddressed in the 2014 Forms 5500 and 5500-SF and that require entry of plan characteristics codes. The IRS has \nfound that characteristic codes result in inadequate responses and are commonly misunderstood by filers, and \nbelieves it would be better to enhance these codes with separate questions. For example, the IRS replaced \n\n\n\ncharacteristic code 2J, which identifies the plan as including a cash or deferred arrangement under Code section \n401(k), with a line item on the 2016 Forms 5500 and 5500-SF. Similarly, Code 3D, a characteristic code that \ncurrently applies to pre-approved [[Page 47561]] pension plans, is replaced with a separate line item on the 2016 \nForms 5500 and 5500-SF. The IRS also added two questions for 2016 that were questions on the Schedule T, \nQualified Pension Plan Coverage Information, before it was eliminated. Specifically, line 4b of the Schedule T asked \nif the employer aggregated plans in testing whether the plan satisfied the nondiscrimination and coverage tests of \nCode sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b). Also, line 4f of the Schedule T asked whether the plan satisfied the coverage \nrequirements of Code section 410(b) on the basis of either the ratio percentage test or the average benefit test. \nThese questions were added to the 2016 Forms 5500 and 5500-SF. These questions are helpful to the IRS when \nperforming pre-audit analysis and allowed the IRS to narrow any inquiries when information was requested from the \nplan. The return of these questions also reflects the elimination of optional coverage and nondiscrimination \ndemonstrations in the IRS determination letter process. See Rev. Proc. 2015-6, 2015-1 I.R.B. 198 and \nAnnouncement 2011-82, 2011-52 I.R.B. 1052. The IRS also added other IRS-only questions to the 2016 Forms \n5500 and 5500-SF in order to address various compliance issues. Specifically, there are new questions as to \nwhether the plan sponsor used the design-based safe harbor rules, the current year ADP test, or prior year ADP \ntest for nonhighly compensated employees in accordance with 26 CFR 1.401(k)-2(a)(2)(iii) to satisfy the \nnondiscrimination requirements of Code sections 401(k)(12), (13). The IRS also added questions as to whether the \nemployer is an adopter of a master and prototype plan or a volume submitter plan that is subject to a favorable \nopinion or advisory letter from the IRS, and the date of that favorable letter. This question will help determine the \nplan's remedial amendment period and remedial amendment cycle under Code section 401(b) and Rev. Proc. \n2007-44, 2007-28 I.R.B. 54 (as modified by Rev. Proc. 2008-56, 2008-2 C.B. 826; and Rev. Proc. 2009-36, 2009-2 \nC.B.304); Notice 2009-97, 2009-2 C.B. 972; and Notice 2010-48, 2010-27 I.R.B. 9. The IRS added a similar \nquestion for individually-designed plans as to whether an individually designed plan received a favorable \ndetermination letter from the IRS. The IRS has found that issues have arisen regarding the failure of plan sponsors \nto make timely amendments to their plan document to reflect changes in the law. The IRS also added a question to \nthe 2016 Forms 5500 and 5500-SF as to whether any distributions during the plan year were made to an employee \nwho attained age 62 and had not separated from service for defined benefit plans or money purchase pension \nplans. The IRS has found various qualification and taxability issues related to such distributions. Those filers who \nare required by the electronic filing regulations to file the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report electronically will be \nrequired to answer these IRS compliance questions electronically using EFAST2 for the 2016 and later plan years. \nThe IRS will provide a paper- only form containing these IRS compliance items for use by filers who are not subject \nto the electronic filing requirements of the Treasury regulations and who elect not to answer the questions through \nEFAST2. A draft of the paper-only form, Form 5500-SUP, Annual Return of Employee Benefit Plan Supplemental \nInformation, was released for public comment in October, 2014. The 2016 Form 5500-SUP is expected to be \nmodified to reflect the changes proposed for 2016 plan year. b. IRS-Only Questions for Later Plan Years In addition \nto the questions the IRS included on the 2016 Forms 5500 and 5500-SF, the IRS proposes to add new questions \nfor later plan years. Some of these additional questions were previously included on the 2008 Schedule E (ESOP \nAnnual Information). Specifically, Line 1a of the 2008 Schedule E asked whether the ESOP is maintained by an S \ncorporation and, if so, whether any prohibited allocations were made to any disqualified persons. Line 2b of the \nSchedule E asked whether the employer maintaining the ESOP paid dividends deductible under Code section \n404(k). Line 4 of the 2008 Schedule E asked if the ESOP held any preferred stock and under what formula that \npreferred stock was convertible into common stock. Line 6 of the 2008 Schedule E asked if any unallocated \nsecurities were used to pay an exempt loan and, if so, asked for the method used. Line 16 of the 2008 Schedule E \nasked if the employer made payments in redemption of stock held by an ESOP to terminating participants and \ndeducted them under Code section 404(k). All of these questions will be added to the new Schedule E, ESOP \nAnnual Information. The IRS notes that any questions added to the proposed Schedule E with respect to Code \nsection 404(k) will be included pursuant to Code section 6047(e) rather than Code section 6058 (the section \npursuant to which the other IRS-only question are included on the Form 5500). Thus, the disclosure rules of Code \nsection 6104(b) are not applicable and a separate process will need to be in place so that any information provided \nwith respect to Code section 404(k) will be compliant with the appropriate disclosure rules. The IRS also proposes \nto add three questions to the Forms 5500 and 5500-SF that will insure that the filers are aware of certain Code \nrequirements in areas where the IRS has found significant noncompliance. In the first area, the IRS proposes to \nadd a question for defined benefit pension plans as to whether the plans comply with the participation requirements \n\n\n\nof Code section 401(a)(26). In the second, the IRS proposes to ask whether minimum required distributions were \nmade to 5% owners in accordance with Code section 401(a)(9). This question addresses issues as to the \nqualification of the plan, the taxability of distributions, and the possible imposition of excise taxes under Code \nsection 4974. In the third, the IRS proposes to add a question as to whether hardship distributions were made \nduring the plan year for a section 401(k) plan. The IRS has found various qualification and taxability issues related \nto such distributions. The IRS also proposes to add a question to the Forms 5500 and 5500- SF as to whether the \nplan provides for designated Roth contributions under Code section 402A. The question would identify plans that \nhave added Roth contribution features. Designated Roth contributions and Roth conversions add a new layer of \nrecordkeeping and tax reporting for plan administration, and the IRS has found various issues related to \nrecordkeeping and reporting. As noted previously, because the plan characteristics codes sometimes provide \ninadequate responses and are commonly misunderstood by filers, the IRS proposes to replace these codes with \nseparate questions to the Forms 5500 and 5500-SF. For example, the IRS proposes to replace characteristic codes \n2L and 2M regarding Code sections 403(b)(1) and 403(b)(7) arrangements with separate line items. Also, \ncharacteristic code 1I currently applies to frozen defined benefit pension plans that do not provide any new benefit \naccruals as of the last day of the plan year. Neither the Form 5500 nor the Form 5500-SF, however, currently \nrequests similar information regarding frozen defined contribution pension plans. The IRS proposes to add a \nquestion to these forms for defined contribution pension plans asking whether the plans are frozen. [[Page 47562]] \nThe IRS also proposes to add a line item to the Forms 5500 and 5500-SF for plans electing non-church plan status \nunder Code section 410(d). 26 CFR 1.410(d)-1(c)(3) provides that a plan administrator may elect non-church plan \nstatus by attaching a statement to the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report. Although such statements can be attached \nto the EFAST2 filing as a PDF, the proposed change would facilitate the process by which the IRS determines \nwhich plans have elected non-church plan status and thus allow the IRS to apply the appropriate criteria in \ndetermining compliance. There also is a new IRS question on the Schedule H and Form 5500-SF regarding \nunrelated business taxable income (UBTI) under Code sections 511 and 512. Although qualified plans are generally \nrequired to report UBTI on Form 990-T, Exempt Organization Business Income Tax Return, the IRS has found it \ndifficult to get timely information regarding this taxable income. Lastly, a trustee's signature would be added in the \ntrustee information section on the Schedule H and the Form 5500-SF. The signature is intended to satisfy the \nrequirements under Code section 6033(a) for an annual information return from every Code section 401(a) \norganization exempt from tax under Code section 501(a). As discussed in more detail below, because this is an \nIRS-only signature, filers who file fewer than 250 returns during the year will be able to satisfy this signature \nrequirement by filing the Form 5500-SUP. c. New Schedule for IRS-Only Compliance Questions As noted above, \nthe IRS proposes to add various IRS-only questions to the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report and to the Form 5500-\nSF and also issue a Form 5500-SUP for those filers who are not subject to the IRS electronic filing mandate in 26 \nCFR 301.6058-2 and elect to answer these questions on a paper return. These new IRS-only compliance questions \ndo not apply to welfare plans. With respect to the Form 5500 and the Form 5500-SF, the IRS is considering whether \nthese questions should be added to these forms individually based on subject matter or whether they should be \nadded collectively on a single IRS-only schedule. If the questions are added individually, they would appear on the \nforms and schedules based on subject matter. Thus, for example, ESOP questions would appear on a new \nSchedule E while other compliance questions may appear on Form 5500-SF and revised Schedules H, MB, R, and \nSB. On the other hand, if these IRS compliance questions are added collectively, they would appear on a \ncompletely new IRS-only schedule. Comments are specifically requested as to whether a separate schedule that \nwould include all of the IRS-only questions should be made part of the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report 2. New \nSchedule H and Form 5500-SF Compliance Questions An area of particular recent focus for DOL has been \ncompliance with ERISA section 411. Accordingly, the proposal would add a new question under Part IV of Schedule \nH asking whether any person disqualified under ERISA section 411 was permitted to serve the plan. ERISA section \n411 disqualifies people who have been convicted of certain crimes from serving as an administrator, fiduciary, \nofficer, trustee, custodian, counsel, agent, employee, consultant, or adviser of any employee benefit plan for a \nspecified period. The statute also prohibits people who are currently disqualified from representing a plan in any \ncapacity, and from having any decision-making authority or custody or control of the monies, funds, assets, or \nproperty of an employee benefit plan. This proposed question on disqualification would facilitate competent plan \nadministration and improve due diligence by encouraging the plan administrator to determine whether any of the \nplan's fiduciaries, employees, and service providers potentially participated in an act prohibited by ERISA section \n411. Another proposed compliance question, which also supports the Agencies' goals in obtaining better \n\n\n\ninformation on investments and related fees for defined contribution pension plans, involves whether the plan is a \nparticipant-directed account plan, and, if so, whether the plan provided participants with the fee disclosures required \nby 29 CFR 2550.404a-5. As discussed earlier with respect to the Form 5500-SF, the proposal also requires \nadministrators to attach the comparison chart to Schedule H. These questions would help plan administrators \ncomply with 29 CFR 2550.404a-5. This proposed question is also responsive to the GAO's recommendation that \nthe Agencies seek specific information on QDIAs. GAO Targeted Revisions Could Improve Usefulness of Form \n5500 Information, at 18. A plan that is a participant-directed account plan also must report the number of DIAs \nunder the plan, the number of DIAs that are index funds, and whether a designated investment manager (DIM) was \nmade available to participants and beneficiaries. These new questions appear on both Schedule H and on the Form \n5500-SF. The proposal also would add a new compliance question asking whether the employer sponsoring the \nplan paid administrative expenses that were not reported as service provider compensation on Schedule C or a \nplan administrative expense on Schedule H. Where the only compensation received by a service provider in \nconnection with a plan is direct payment from the plan sponsor, the information is not required to be reported on \nSchedule C. To minimize burden, while still providing a clearer picture on the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report of \nall service providers to plans, regardless of who pays those service providers, the Agencies are proposing only to \nask whether the plan has any such service providers rather than require identification and other Schedule C \ninformation for such service providers. The Agencies are requesting comments on whether there should be a \nminimum threshold compensation amount for this question and, if so, what the amount should be. The proposal \nalso would add a question asking whether the plan sponsor or its affiliates provided any services to the plan in \nexchange for direct or indirect compensation. This information would help the Agencies obtain a complete picture of \nthe relationship between the plan and the plan sponsor, including the extent to which the sponsor may also be \nacting as a fiduciary or service provider. An affirmative answer may indicate potential conflicts of interest and would \nbe useful for DOL enforcement. Another proposed compliance question would require filers to indicate whether the \nplan had any leveraged investment acquisitions, the total amount of those acquisitions, and the ratio of the \nleveraged investments to total plan assets. In addition to helping ensure that the plan administrator has a complete \npicture of the potential risk and reward associated with the plan's assets, these questions would improve the \nAgencies' understanding of plan operations. Plans with a high ratio of leveraged investments, such as options, \nfutures, and margin-type investments, may be at greater risk. By identifying these plans, the Agencies would be \nbetter able to target and track performance of high- risk plans. This question would only be added to the Schedule \nH, and not the Form 5500-SF. Leveraged investments are not ``eligible plan assets'' for purposes of the Form 5500-\nSF. Small plans that have such investments must file the Form 5500. [[Page 47563]] In the existing section \nregarding the IQPA report, filers would be required to indicate whether the accountant orally or in writing \ncommunicated various governance issues discovered during the audit, including errors or irregularities, illegal acts, \nmaterial internal control weaknesses, and the existence of plan qualification issues. This question is intended to \nenhance compliance by highlighting the existing duty of the plan administrator to read and review the audit report \nand, if necessary, to engage in a discussion with the auditor about the report's contents. In addition to helping the \nplan administrator ensure that the audit is comprehensive, the answers to these questions would provide \nparticipants with information about potential problems with the management of plan assets. Also, in situations \nwhere the plan administrator reports that the auditor has identified problems with the audit, the Agencies would \nhave an opportunity to conduct a closer review of the plan's finances. In addition to the existing question asking \nwhether the IQPA has relied on the limited scope audit provisions in 29 CFR 2520.103-8, the proposal would \nrequire filers to attach the certification of investment information created by certain banks or insurance companies \nto ensure the plan is qualified to be subject to a limited scope audit. This change would also encourage plan \nadministrators to maintain documentation consistent with the limited scope audit requirements. The change is being \nmade in conjunction with revisions to the DOL's regulation at 29 CFR 2520.103-8 to set forth specific requirements \nfor the attachment, including the requirement that the certification appear on a separate document from the list of \nplan assets covered by the certification, which list generally would be required to be reported on the Schedule H, \nLine 4i Schedules of Assets, using the structured data entry format through EFAST. The required attachment of the \nproposed, updated certification would also make the Agencies' review of limited scope audits more robust by \nenabling them to follow up on plans that use the limited scope exemption but fail to attach the necessary \ncertification. See DOL-OIG: Changes Are Still Needed in the ERISA Audit Process to Increase Protections for \nEmployee Benefit Plan Participants at 17 (EBSA should improve the quality of its audit documentation reviews by \nadding procedures to ensure that ``all plan assets are either certified by a qualifying financial institution or tested by \n\n\n\nthe IQPA''). Obtaining the certification would also allow EBSA to better determine which of the plan's assets are \nsubject to a limited scope audit and which require a full IQPA report. Id. at 4 (``EBSA's review guide did not \nspecifically address audits in which the plan custodian certified some, but not all, plan assets in limited scope \naudits.'') The Agencies also propose standardizing information reported on Schedule H, Line 4a, to foster filers' \ncompliance with regulations and guidance governing delinquent participant contributions and loan repayments. \nUnder the proposed changes, filers would complete a standardized, structured attachment that includes information \nabout whether the correction of the delinquency was made within or outside of the Voluntary Fiduciary Correction \nProgram (VFCP) and Prohibited Transaction Exemption 2002-51. As under the current requirements, filers must \ncontinue to report the deficiency until correction is made. The proposed changes also facilitate accurate reporting \nby requiring the delinquent contribution information to be included in supplemental schedules. Including such \ninformation in supplemental schedules would help ensure that IQPAs address delinquent contributions and loan \nrepayments in their audit reports, consistent with generally accepted auditing standards. The proposal also includes \nnew questions on Schedule G (Financial Transaction Schedules). To gather additional information about the plan's \ntransactions and relationships, especially nonexempt prohibited transactions, the Agencies propose asking for more \ndetailed information about the nature of nonexempt prohibited transactions engaged in by the plan. In addition to \nthe current requirement to provide the name and contact information for the parties involved with the nonexempt \ntransaction, and their relationship to the plan, employer, employee organization, plan sponsor, or other party-in-\ninterest, the proposal asks filers to check a box indicating the nature of the nonexempt transaction. The check \nboxes generally follow the prohibitions of ERISA section 406 and Code section 4975 and include, for example, sale \nof any property to/from the plan, exchange of any property, lease of any property to/from the plan, lending of money \nto/from the plan, other extension of credit to/from the plan, furnishing of goods to/from the plan, etc. The proposal \nalso asks a new question about whether the transaction is discrete or ongoing and whether the transaction has \nbeen fully corrected, either through or outside of the VFCP. The proposal also asks for the date the transaction was \nfully corrected, a description of the corrective action and whether, if a nonexempt transaction occurred with respect \nto a disqualified person, and the person was notified, a Form 5330 was filed with the IRS to pay the excise tax on \nthe transaction. The proposal would add new line items on Schedule A for reporting whether any premium \npayments were overdue and, if so, the amount delinquent, and whether there was a policy or contract reported on \nthe Schedule that was issued by an insurance company wholly owned by the plan or the plan sponsor. An \naffirmative answer to questions on delinquent premium payments and whether the plans holds a contract issued by \nan insurance company that is wholly owned by the plan or plan sponsor would alert DOL to potential insurance \ncancellation and other conflict of interest issues. The DOL issued new guidance in 2015 regarding economically \ntargeted investments (ETIs) made by ERISA-covered retirement plans. ETIs are investments that are selected for \nbenefits they create in addition to the investment return to the employee benefit plan investor. The DOL previously \naddressed issues relating to ETIs in Interpretive Bulletin 94-1, 29 CFR 2509.94-1 (IB 94-1) and Interpretive Bulletin \n2008-1, 29 CFR 2509.08-1 (IB 2008-1). IB 94-1 had corrected a misperception that investments in ETIs are \nincompatible with ERISA's fiduciary obligations. On October 17, 2008, the department replaced IB 94-1 with IB \n2008-01. However, the DOL concluded that in the seven years since its publication, IB 2008-01 had unduly \ndiscouraged fiduciaries from considering ETIs and environmental, social and governance (``ESG'') factors under \nappropriate circumstances, and issued Interpretive Bulletin 2015-01, 29 CFR 2509.2015-1 (IB-2015-1). IB-2015-1 \nconfirmed the DOL's longstanding view from IB 94-1 that fiduciaries may not accept lower expected returns or take \non greater risks in order to secure collateral benefits, but may take such benefits into account as ``tiebreakers'' \nwhen investments are otherwise equal with respect to their economic and financial characteristics. IB- 2015-1 also \nacknowledges that ESG factors may have a direct relationship to the economic and financial value of an \ninvestment. When they do, these factors are more than just tiebreakers, but rather are proper components of the \nfiduciary's analysis of the economic and financial merits of competing investment choices. [[Page 47564]] Changes \nin the financial markets, particularly improved metrics and tools allowing for better analyses of investments, are \nenabling plan fiduciaries to make better and more evidence-based decisions on ETIs and ESG factors in evaluating \nthe merits of competing investment choices. Some private sector sources are developing structured ESG research \ndata for evaluating corporate performance. The DOL is interested in public comments, including analysis on costs \nand benefits, on whether collecting information related to ETI and ESG investment activities of ERISA-covered \nplans on the Form 5500, such as whether plans incorporate ESG factors into their investment analysis, would add \nvalue to this growing data source and allow ERISA fiduciaries to more easily consider the role ESG factors could or \nshould play in their investment decisions. The DOL requests comments regarding the best way to use the Form \n\n\n\n5500 to collect information with respect to ESG investment activities that is standardized, comparable, and reliable \nFor example, public companies are already subject to requirements to disclose material risks, including relevant \nrisks associated with climate change, per Securities and Exchange Commission Interpretation: Commission \nGuidance Regarding Disclosure Related to Climate Change [Release Nos. 33-9106; 34-61469; FR-82]. The DOL \nspecifically requests comments on whether we could use the SEC disclosure requirements for public companies as \na basis for a Form 5500 information collection. 3. Schedules MB and SB--New Questions and Identifying \nInformation for Attachments The Agencies are proposing to add new questions to the actuarial schedules \n(Schedules MB and SB) to enhance compliance. On the Schedule SB, reporting of the target normal cost would be \nrevised to separate out the plan-related expenses. By requiring this breakdown, the Agencies and other users of \nSchedule SB data such as firms conducting actuarial research would be able to more accurately project liabilities \nand future required contributions. The Agencies also propose to add a new question to the Schedule SB to require \nsingle-employer plans with 500 or more participants as of the valuation date to report projections of expected \nbenefit payments to be paid for the entire plan (not including expected expenses) for each of the next ten plan years \nstarting with the plan year to which the filing relates. For this purpose the plan would assume that there were no \nadditional accruals, experience (e.g., termination, mortality, and retirement) consistent with the plan's valuation \nassumptions, and that no new entrants would be covered by the plan. The requirement would not be applicable to \nplans with fewer than 500 participants as of the valuation date. This information would enable the Agencies to \ndetermine how much of a plan's assets are needed to pay benefits to participants. This information would also help \nin assessing the adequacy of current assets and contributions to satisfy the disclosed benefit commitments. In \nMarch 2015, PBGC asked OMB to approve, and in June 2015, OMB approved adding a similar question for the \n2015 Schedule MB, to be reported on a PDF attachment. The Agencies are now proposing that the question be \nadded to the Schedule MB itself. 4. Form 5500 and Form 5500-SF PBGC Compliance Questions For 2016, PBGC \nis proposing to add a question to the existing question on Schedules H and I, Line 5c, that asks, if a plan is a \ndefined benefit plan, whether it is covered by the PBGC insurance program. The new question would ask filers that \nchecked the box ``Yes'' to enter the My PAA generated confirmation number for the PBGC premium filing for this \nplan year. In this proposal, PBGC is proposing moving the questions to the Form 5500 and Form 5500-SF. In \ncomparing Form 5500 Annual Return/Report data to PBGC premium filing data, the agency has found PBGC-\ncovered plans for which no premiums have been paid and filers incorrectly claiming that they have PBGC-covered \nplans. By requiring reporting of the My PAA generated confirmation number on the Form 5500 and Form 5500-SF, \nPBGC will be better able to match Form 5500 Annual Return/Report filings to PBGC premium filings, bring in new \npremium filings, as well as improve the data collected on the Forms. Also, for the 21st Century initiative changes, \nthe Agencies are proposing to move Line 5c on Schedule H and I to Line 9a(4) of the Form 5500 and Line 12a(4) of \nthe Form 5500-SF. The new question described above about PBGC premium filings would be added to these lines. \nF. Miscellaneous Technical and Conforming Changes for Forms and Instructions Various other technical and \nconforming changes to the forms, schedules, and instructions are being proposed as part of the substantial \nrestructuring of the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report described in this notice. Several of the more significant of \nthese changes are as follows. On both the Form 5500 and the Form 5500-SF, filers that check the ``single-\nemployer plan'' box in accordance with the instructions, but which have multiple employers obligated to contribute \nto the plan that are members of a controlled group, would be required to file an attachment identifying the \nparticipating employers. This requirement would be similar to the requirement, effective with the 2014 annual \nreturn/report forms, to attach a list of participating employers with a good faith percentage of the contributions to the \nplan of each participating employer, for plans that file as ``multiple-employer'' plans. To implement ERISA section \n103(g) resulting from the Cooperative and Small Employer Charity Pension Flexibility Act (CSEC Act), Public Law \n113-97, 128 Stat. 1101 (April 7, 2014), the DOL published an interim final rule in November 2014, 79 FR 66617 \n(Nov. 10, 2014). The DOL intends that the CSEC Act reporting changes will be made final effective with the \nimplementation of final forms revisions following this proposal. Under the CSEC Act interim final rule, filers that \ncheck the ``multiple-employer plan'' box are required to provide a list of participating employers and a good faith \nestimate of the percentage of total contributions made by each participating employer during the plan year. The \nDOL received four comments on the interim final rule and six additional comments on an emergency PRA \nsubmission published separately. A central concern of the commenters is that the list of participating employers is \nessentially the client list developed by entities that sponsor multiple-employer plans for professional employer \norganizations (PEOs) or other associations. The commenters asserted that the publication of the participating \nemployer information could negatively affect their business model by enabling competitors to target client \n\n\n\nemployers. These commenters suggested that the DOL could not implement the CSEC Act law change by asking \nfor the required information to be reported on the Form 5500 because the list of employers is proprietary \ninformation. Certain commenters suggested, in the alternative, that if the information was required to be reported, it \nshould not be publicly disclosed. One commenter suggested that the DOL should not apply the requirement to \ndefined contribution or welfare plans because the CSEC legislation focused on ERISA [[Page 47565]] minimum \nfunding requirements which do not apply to the majority of defined contribution pension plans or to any group health \nand welfare plans. That commenter suggested that the DOL could instead obtain the participating employer \ninformation through the use of its subpoena authority or could limit the requirement by providing an alternate \nmethod of compliance. The commenter also suggested allowing plans that are multiple employer welfare \narrangements (MEWAs) that fund benefits through VEBAs to satisfy the employer list requirement by submitting the \nVEBA information and either removing the contribution requirement entirely or clarifying that the filers need only \ninclude gross contribution information rather than break out the information by employers and employees.\\42\\ --------\n------------------------------------------------------------------- \\42\\ The DOL notes that the CSEC Act reporting requirements \nonly apply to multiple-employer plans and thus the requirement only applies to those MEWAs that are in fact plans. \nIndividual plans participating in a non-plan MEWA must file their own Form 5500 Annual Return/Report unless \notherwise exempt. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The DOL has considered these \ncomments but has decided not to make changes to the multiple-employer plan reporting requirements described in \nthe interim final rule. The CSEC Act makes provision of participating employer information a reporting requirement \nunder section 103 of ERISA. Section 104(a)(1) of ERISA provides generally that the contents of the annual report \nmust be open for public inspection. The DOL continues to believe that the reporting requirements made effective for \nthe 2014 form year by the interim final rule are a reasonable and appropriate way to implement Congress's directive \nin the CSEC Act. Furthermore, the Agencies believe that this information is important for plan oversight, research, \nand enforcement purposes. Because participating employers generally are not otherwise identified on the Form \n5500 or its schedules,\\43\\ the Agencies have no other information on the number or identity of participating \nemployers in multiple-employer plans. The Agencies also believe that similar information would be helpful for \nparticipating members of a plan that covers members of a controlled group that files under the reporting rules as a \n``single-employer'' plan. Accordingly, under the proposal, a new check box would be added for a plan to identify \nthat it covers members of a controlled group. Plans checking that box would be required to provide the same basic \nidentifying and contribution information as are multiple-employer plans under the CSEC Act changes. ------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------- \\43\\ In a requirement added under the PPA, filers are required to \nprovide certain information on Schedule R, for each employer that contributed more than 5% of total contributions to \na multiemployer defined benefit pension plan during the plan year (measured in dollars). ------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------- The Form 5500, as proposed, would ask filers to identify and provide contact \ninformation for the ``named fiduciary'' under ERISA section 3(21). The Agencies note that as for any other address \nand identifying information required on the annual return/report, named fiduciary addresses and phone numbers \n(and those of the employer and plan administrator) should be the actual addresses and phone numbers for those \nentities/individuals and not the address of a service provider or entity that is completing the filing. This has been an \narea of inaccurate data entry as the entity that fills out the form has not always entered correct data in correct \nboxes. As a result, the data is misleading for participants and beneficiaries and for the Agencies. New breakout \nquestions would be added to both the Form 5500 and the Form 5500-SF, for defined contribution pension plans to \nreport the number of participants with account balances as of the beginning of the plan year; the number of \nparticipants that made contributions during the plan year; and the number of participants that terminated \nemployment during the plan year that had their entire account balance distributed. The following new information \nwould also be required to be reported on the Form 5500 or Form 5500-SF in the questions that are intended to \nreplace the current plan characteristics code structure: 1. The current requirement for defined benefit pension plans \nto identify whether the filing is for a frozen plan would be extended to defined contribution pension plans. 2. Defined \ncontribution pension plans would now be required to identify whether the plan is a SIMPLE 401(k) plan under Code \nsections 401(k)(11) and 401(m)(10). 3. Defined contribution pension plans would now be required to identify \nwhether the plan has a designated Roth feature. 4. Defined contribution pension plans that have participant- \ndirected brokerage accounts would now be required to enter the number of participants using such accounts during \nthe plan year. 5. Defined contribution pension plans would have to indicate whether the plan has an intended \nqualified default investment alternative(s) (QDIA) and, if so, to indicate the type(s) of alternative(s). 6. Pension plans \nwould be required to report if the plan is an eligible combined plan under Code section 414(x). 7. Pension plans \n\n\n\nwould be required to report if a rollover from a plan was used to start up the business sponsoring the plan (a \nRollovers as Business Start-Ups or ROBS transaction). 8. Pension plans would be required to report if the plan is \nelecting church plan status under Code Section 410(d). 9. Defined contributions pension plans would be required to \nindicate whether they provide financial education and/or financial advice for participants. 10. Plans would be \nrequired to report if the plan provides long term care insurance. 11. On the Form 5500, plans that provide group \nhealth benefits would have to indicate, more specifically, whether they provide medical/surgical benefits, pharmacy \nor prescription drug benefits, mental health/substance use disorder benefits, wellness program, preventive care \nservices, emergency services, and pregnancy benefits. The signature section on the Form 5500 would be revised \nto add a checkbox to indicate whether the plan is a Taft-Hartley plan and to provide a dedicated signature area for \nboth a ``management'' and a ``labor'' trustee. In addition to the changes described above, the Schedule A and its \ninstructions would be clarified to specify that the plan is required to report the insurance carrier's NAIC ``Company \nCode,'' when reporting the ``NAIC number.'' Plans that provide group health benefits through an insurance contract \nwould also be required to provide the insurance carrier's required health plan identification number (HPID) under \nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Schedule J would require filers to provide \nthe NAIC Producer Code if there is a stop loss policy associated with the plan's obligation to pay health benefits. \nThe Agencies invite comment on whether a particular NAIC type number or other identifying number, as well as the \nHPID, would be best to produce the most consistent and accurate identifier of insurance companies required to be \nidentified on the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report. On new Line 2 of the Schedule A, plans would be required to \nreport if the policy or contract was issued by an insurance company that is wholly owned by the plan or the plan \nsponsor. The current questions and instructions on Schedule A for persons covered under an insurance contract \n[[Page 47566]] that reported on Schedule A would be clarified and expanded. The instructions are clarified to make \nexplicit that the existing requirement to report the approximate number of persons includes participants, \nbeneficiaries, and dependents covered under the contract. For welfare benefit contracts, the question has also been \nparticularized to require the approximate number of persons covered for each type of benefit. To improve the data, \nthere would be new checkboxes on the Schedule A to enable filers to indicate whether the contract covered \naccidental death and disability (AD &D) or long term care insurance. The existing element on the Schedule A to \nidentify that plan assets are in insurance company ``pooled separate accounts'' would be broken into ``pooled \nseparate accounts'' and ``other'' separate accounts. If ``other,'' filers would be required to enter a description of the \nseparate account. Plans that provide life insurance would be required to indicate, on Schedule A, whether a life \ninsurance contract is ``term life'' or ``other.'' If the life insurance contract is other than ``term life,'' the filer would \ncontinue to have to enter a description. The Schedule C instructions with regard to exceptions for reporting \nemployees whose compensation is less than $25,000 would be clarified to provide that, for Schedule C purposes, \ncompensation does not include the employer portion of FICA and FUTA taxes as part of the total compensation of \nan employee. It does, however, include salary, bonuses, overtime, and all indirect compensation from persons other \nthan the plan received in connection with the person's position with the plan or services provided to the plan. As \ndiscussed above, the instructions would be modified to specify that expenses for travel, education, conferences, \nmeals, etc., whether paid directly by the plan or reimbursed to the employee, have to be included in determining \ntotal compensation of plan employees, but only if such payments would be reportable as taxable income to the \nemployee. As with similar clarifying changes to Schedule C and the Schedule H, Line 4i Schedules of Assets, plans \nwould now be required to report on Schedule A the relationship to the plan, employer, employee organization, \nsponsor, fiduciary, or other party-in-interest of the agent, broker, or other person to whom commissions or fees \nwere paid. When reporting on Schedule A that an insurance company failed to provide the information needed to \ncomplete the annual return/report, if it is ``fee and commission'' information that is not provided, then filers would \nonly need to check a box to so indicate. Filers would continue to have a place to describe other types of \ninformation. In addition to the changes described above to the Schedule H, filers would be required to report, in the \nexisting section on the IQPA report on the Schedule H, the state in which the IQPA report was issued. The existing \nquestions for Form 5500 Annual Return/Report filers to indicate plan funding and benefit arrangements would be \nadded to the Form 5500-SF. In response to the concerns of certain practitioners regarding their ability to comply \nwith filing requirements where PBGC has trusteed a plan and there is no longer a plan administrator to complete \nthe filing or the ability to pay a service provider for the work necessary to fulfill the filing obligation, the Agencies are \nproposing to simplify the final filing requirements for plans trusteed by PBGC that have 500 or fewer participants. \nSpecifically, the question on whether the plan has come under the trusteeship of the PBGC would be moved from \ncurrent plan characteristic code 1H on the Form 5500 and part of Line 4k on the Schedule H and Line 13b on the \n\n\n\nForm 5500-SF to a checkbox on Part I of the Form 5500. Form 5500 Annual Return/Report filers that, as of the date \nthe return/report is filed but not later than the due date of the return/report with automatic extension, have been \ntrusteed by PBGC under section 4041(c) or 4042 of ERISA, would be required to check that box and enter the date \nof PBGC trusteeship in the space provided. Plans with 500 or fewer participants (see Part II, Line 6, asking for \nparticipant count) that check this box would be required to complete all of Part I and Lines 1, 2, 3, 6, 9a(3) and \n9a(4) of Part II; this would be the last Form 5500 Annual Return/Report they would need to file. Form 5500 Annual \nReturn/ Report filers with plans with more than 500 participants (in Part II, Line 6) would be required to complete the \nForm 5500 in the same manner as they have in the past and would need to file a Form 5500 for a following short \nplan year (depending on when the plan was trusteed). Similarly, Form 5500-SF filers with plans that, as of the date \nthe return/report is filed but not later than the due date of the return/ report with automatic extension, have been \ntrusteed by PBGC under section 4041(c) or 4042 of ERISA, would be required to check a box in Part 1A and enter \nthe date of PBGC trusteeship in the space provided. Plans that check this box would be required to complete all of \nPart I and Lines 1, 2, 3, 5 (if applicable), 6, 9a(3) and 9a(4) of Part II. The proposal to simplify final filing \nrequirements is limited to PBGC-trusteed plans with 500 or fewer participants for a number of reasons. PBGC \ngenerally needs the information contained in the final annual return/report to calculate its claims for underfunding \nand unpaid minimum funding contributions, to prepare its financial statements, and to value participant benefits. \nLarger plans tend to have more complex asset structures and include hard-to-value assets, while smaller plans are \nmore likely to lack the resources needed to meet their actuarial and filing obligations for the final plan year and final \nshort plan year. It has been primarily representatives of small plans that have contacted PBGC and DOL to request \nrelief from filing requirements for PBGC-trusteed plans. In PBGC's experience, larger plans usually comply with the \nfiling requirement for the final plan year and the final short plan year. The companies that maintain these larger \nplans typically build the cost of plan administration into their balance sheets, even if the plan is terminated in an \ninvoluntary or distress termination. Moreover, in PBGC's experience, for most larger plans, the cost of filing the \nannual return/report is paid from plan assets. Even when paid by the plan sponsor, PBGC believes that the cost of \nfiling for a larger plan is a relatively insignificant component of the sponsor's overall business expenses. PBGC also \nbelieves that exempting larger plans from completing certain schedules or sections of the annual return/report \nwould not result in a meaningful cost savings to the plan sponsor and could result in the inability to compile \nimportant information in the event that the plan is terminated. An involuntary or distress termination involves a \ncomplex actuarial and economic analysis by PBGC that may continue for a year or more and does not always result \nin termination. The process of preparing the annual return/report continues through and beyond the plan year. \nPBGC believes that limiting the reporting obligations for larger plans anticipating termination might cause a plan to \nstop the ongoing process that culminates with the filing, even though a termination is not ultimately approved. This \nwould significantly impair PBGC's actuarial and financial analysis for the ongoing plan. The Agencies also propose \nto accept the electronic-signature by the plan [[Page 47567]] actuary on the Schedules MB and SB, and the \nelectronic-signature by the plan trustee for trust information on the Form 5500-SF and Schedule H. The plan \nactuary or plan trustee can access the EFAST2 Web site at            www.efast.dol.gov to register for electronic \ncredentials to sign or submit filings. If a plan actuary or a plan trustee chooses not to sign electronically, then the \nactuary or trustee must sign the schedule or Form, and an electronic reproduction must be attached to the Form \n5500 or Form 5500-SF. This electronic reproduction must be labeled ``Trustee Signature'' for trust information on \nthe Schedule H or Form 5500-SF, and ``Actuary Signature'' for the plan actuary on the Schedule MB or SB, and \nmust be included as a Portable Document Format (PDF) attachment or any alternative electronic attachment \nallowable under EFAST2, if it is not electronically signed. G. Electronic Filing of Certain IRS-Only Forms The \nAgencies propose to enable filers to file IRS Forms 5500-EZ and 5558 through EFAST by creating an electronic \nversion of each of these forms. The Agencies believe that the anticipated increase in electronic filing resulting from \nthe creation of an electronic version of these forms would have various beneficial effects. For example, the \nelectronic filing of these forms would benefit the filers and the Agencies by reducing errors that are more likely to \noccur during the manual preparation and processing of paper returns and reports. Electronic filing also results in \nfaster settling of accounts and better customer service. See Private Pensions: Targeted Revisions Could Improve \nUsefulness of Form 5500 Information. 1. Form 5500-EZ The Form 5500-EZ, Annual Return of One-Participant \n(Owners and Their Spouse) Retirement Plan, is generally used by one-participant plans and certain foreign plans to \nsatisfy their filing requirements with the IRS under Code section 6058. The Form 5500-EZ is currently filed on paper \nwith the IRS. Although the Form 5500-EZ cannot currently be filed electronically, one-participant plans and foreign \nplans (beginning with the 2014 plan year) may elect to electronically file the Form 5500-SF using the EFAST2 \n\nhttp://www.efast.dol.gov/\n\n\nsystem instead of filing the paper Form 5500-EZ with the IRS. One-participant plans and foreign plans that file the \nForm 5500-SF rather than file the Form 5500-EZ are required to complete only certain lines on the Form 5500-SF. \nThese lines are the same as, or are similar to, lines on the Form 5500-EZ. Accordingly, one-participant plans and \nforeign plans filing the Form 5500-SF are required to answer only those questions they would have been required to \nanswer if they had filed the Form 5500-EZ. The IRS's electronic filing mandate regulation described above applies \nto filers of the Form 5500-EZ as well as to filers of Form 5500 and Form 5500-SF. One- participant plans and \nforeign plans that file at least 250 returns during the applicable calendar year generally are therefore now required \nto file the Form 5500-SF electronically using the EFAST2 system beginning with the 2015 plan year. See T.D. 9695, \n79 FR 58256 (Sept. 29, 2014). The IRS proposes to provide an electronic version of the Form 5500- EZ to be filed \non the EFAST2 system. This electronic version would be in addition to the paper version. Accordingly, except to the \nextent they are subject to the electronic filing mandate, one-participant plans and foreign plans subject to the filing \nrequirements of the Code would be able to elect to file either the paper version of the Form 5500-EZ with the IRS or \nfile the electronic version through EFAST2. These filers would no longer be allowed to file the Form 5500-SF. One- \nparticipant plans and foreign plans that are required by 26 CFR 301.6058-2 to file electronically would be required \nto file the electronic version of the Form 5500-EZ. Currently, less than 15 percent of one-participant plans file the \nelectronic Form 5500-SF instead of the paper Form 5500-EZ. The IRS believes that creating an electronic version \nof the Form 5500-EZ to replace the Form 5500-SF for one-participant and foreign plans would encourage these \nfilers to file electronically because they would no longer need to deal with the longer Form 5500-SF and its \ninstructions. The IRS further believes that filers would be more likely to file an electronic Form 5500-EZ instead of a \nForm 5500-SF because, unlike when filing the Form 5500-SF, they would not need to make a separate \ndetermination as to which questions to answer. As with any Form 5500-SF currently filed by a one-participant plan \nfor purposes of the Code, the information filed on the electronic version of the Form 5500-EZ on the EFAST2 \nsystem will not be published by the DOL on the Internet. 2. Form 5558 Filers may currently obtain a one-time \nextension of time to file a Form 5500 Annual Return/Report and a Form 8955-SSA, by filing IRS paper Form 5558, \nApplication for Extension of Time To File Certain Employee Plan Returns, on or before the normal due date of the \nreturn/report. The IRS proposes to create an electronic version of the Form 5558 to be processed through EFAST2, \nwhich would enable filers to use the same system to request an extension that they use to file Form 5500 Annual \nReturn/Report. The electronic filing of this form would benefit the filers and the Agencies by reducing errors that are \nmore likely to occur during the manual preparation and processing of paper returns and reports. Electronic filing \nalso results in faster settling of accounts and better customer service. Under this proposal, the paper Form 5558 \nwould continue to be filed with the IRS by those filers who wish to file the Form 5558 on paper. The Form 5558 is \nalso currently used for extensions of time to file Form 5330, Return of Excise Taxes Related to Employee Benefit \nPlans. It is anticipated that the extension of time to file Form 5330 could not be filed electronically using EFAST. \nThe Form 5330 is used to report various violations of the Code related to retirement plans and requires a payment \nof excise taxes to the IRS. The instructions to the Form 5558 state that any tax due to be paid under the Form 5330 \nmust be paid with the Form 5558 and that interest is charged on taxes not paid by the due date even if an extension \nof time to file is granted. Accordingly, the IRS proposes to create a new paper form for extensions of time to file the \nForm 5330. It is anticipated that this new extension form would have provisions similar to those in the Form 5558 to \nthe extent they apply to the Form 5330. H. Regulations Relating to the Proposed Form As noted above, certain \namendments to the annual reporting regulations are necessary to accommodate some of the proposed revisions to \nthe forms. The DOL is publishing separately today in the Federal Register proposed amendments to the DOL's \nannual reporting regulations. That document includes a discussion of the findings required under sections 104 and \n110 of ERISA that are necessary for the DOL to adopt the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report, including the Form \n5500-SF, if revised as proposed herein, as an alternative method of compliance, limited exemption, and/or \nsimplified report under the reporting and disclosure requirements of Part 1 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA. I. \nPaperwork Reduction Act Statement As part of continuing efforts to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, the \n[[Page 47568]] general public and Federal agencies are invited to comment on proposed and/or continuing \ncollections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)). \nThis helps to ensure that requested data will be provided in the desired format, reporting burden (time and financial \nresources) will be minimized, collection instruments will be clearly understood, and the impact of collection \nrequirements on respondents is properly assessed. Currently, the DOL is soliciting comments concerning the \nproposed revision of the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report, which is an information collection request subject to the \nPRA. A copy of the ICR may be obtained by contacting the person listed in the PRA Addressee section below. The \n\n\n\nDOL has submitted a copy of the proposed forms revisions to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in \naccordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507(d) for its review of the DOL's information collection. The IRS and the PBGC intend \nto submit separate requests for OMB review and approval based upon the final forms revisions. The DOL and OMB \nare particularly interested in comments that:  Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is\n\n necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the Agencies,\n\n including whether the information will have practical utility;\n\n      Evaluate the accuracy of the estimate of the burden of the\n\n proposed collection of information, including the validity of the\n\n methodology and assumptions used;\n\n      Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the\n\n information to be collected; and\n\n      Minimize the burden of the collection of information on\n\n those who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate\n\n automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection\n\n techniques or other forms of information technology, e.g., permitting\n\n electronic submission of responses.\n\n     Written comments must be submitted to the office shown in the PRA\n\n Addressee within 75 days of publication of the Notice of Proposed Forms\n\n Revision to ensure their consideration.\n\n     PRA Addressee: Address requests for copies of the ICR to G.\n\n Christopher Cosby, Office of Policy and Research, U.S. Department of\n\n Labor, Employee Benefits Security Administration, 200 Constitution\n\n Avenue NW., Room N-5718, Washington, DC 20210.

If the activity is\n\n performed for any reason other than compliance with the applicable\n\n federal tax administration system or the Title I annual reporting\n\n requirements, it was not counted as part of the paperwork burden. For\n\n example, most businesses or financial entities maintain, in the\n\nhttp://www.reginfo.gov/\n\n\n ordinary course of business, detailed accounts of assets and\n\n liabilities, and income and expenses for the purposes of operating the\n\n business or entity. These recordkeeping activities were not included in\n\n the calculation of burden because prudent business or financial\n\n entities normally have that information available for reasons other\n\n than federal tax or Title I annual reporting. Only time for gathering\n\n and processing information associated with the tax return/annual\n\n reporting systems, and learning about the law, was included. In\n\n addition, an activity is counted as a burden only once if performed for\n\n both tax and Title I purposes. The Agencies also have designed the\n\n instruction package for the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report so that\n\n filers generally will be able to complete the Form 5500 Annual Return/\n\n Report by reading the instructions without needing to refer to the\n\n statutes or regulations. The Agencies, therefore, have included in\n\n their PRA calculations a burden for reading the instructions and find\n\n there is no recordkeeping burden attributable to the Form 5500 Annual\n\n Return/Report.\n\n     The DOL solicits comments regarding whether or not any\n\n recordkeeping beyond that which is usual and customary is necessary to\n\n complete the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report. Comments are also\n\n solicited on whether the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report instructions\n\n are generally sufficient to enable filers to complete the Form 5500\n\n Annual Return/Report without needing to refer to the statutes or\n\n\n\n regulations.\n\n \n\n J. Paperwork and Respondent Burden\n\n \n\n     Estimated time needed to complete the forms listed below reflects\n\n the combined requirements of the IRS, the DOL, and the PBGC. The times\n\n will vary depending on individual circumstances.
