{"title": "Official's Asylum Request Could Complicate Saudi-U.S. Diplomacy", "body": "\nMohammed Khilewi knew nothing would be the same for him after May 17, when he told top Saudi officials by cable \nof his bitter opposition to the Saudi government's human rights policies. Khilewi, a Saudi diplomat at the United \nNations, recalls that associates urged him over the next day not to go public with his criticisms and to come to \nWashington to meet the Saudi ambassador, Prince Bandar Bin Sultan.\n\nThen, Khilewi says, a man he knew to be a Saudi intelligence official came to his Manhattan apartment. The agent, \nwho works as a Saudi diplomat, he said, offered him money to keep quiet, and then told Khilewi to see Bandar \nimmediately. \"You have to go today or your life, your wife and kids' lives will be in danger,\" Khilewi said the man told \nhim in Arabic. \"Don't destroy this opportunity.\"\n\nA tape that Khilewi says he made of the conversation -- using a recorder hidden under his bed -- is now a prop in an \ninternational drama that could prove embarrassing to the Saudi regime and has created a diplomatic dilemma for \nWashington.\n\nKhilewi, 31, who was a first secretary at the Saudis' U.N. mission, has asked the Immigration and Naturalization \nService (INS) to grant him political asylum. He said in his application to the INS that he has a \"well-founded fear of \npersecution\" if he returns to his country, adding that he didn't visit Bandar here because he feared being kidnapped.\n\nKhilewi has gone into hiding with his wife and three children and has gone public with his criticisms of the Saudi \ngovernment.\n\nIf the INS grants Khilewi asylum, it would insult the closest U.S. ally in the Persian Gulf. Khilewi, the highest-\nranking Saudi official to criticize the regime openly, wants King Fahd to abdicate. He also wants the Saudi \ngovernment to give its citizens civil rights and to end what Khilewi calls the royal family's corruption. In the past, \nU.S. officials have not made a public issue of Saudi human rights abuses.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the alleged threat against Khilewi and other claims by him, his lawyer said. The FBI \ndeclined to comment.\n\nKhilewi said in a telephone interview that he has collected 14,000 pages of Saudi documents that illustrate \ngovernment wrongdoing. Some of the documents, he said, show that Saudi Arabia finances Islamic terrorists, spies \non Jewish activists in the United States and smuggles bombs and firearms across international borders.\n\nThe Saudi Embassy strenuously denies his allegations and points out that Khilewi has shown only a few pages to \nreporters.\n\n\nOn ABC's \"20/20,\" when Bandar was shown one of Khilewi's documents purporting to describe the Saudis' \nelectronic monitoring of militant U.S. Jewish groups, the ambassador said it was forged by \"someone who has \naccess to a pad\" of paper with Saudi government letterhead. The Saudi government wishes no harm to Khilewi, \nBandar said. \"We're not after him,\" he said. \"We want to help this guy\u2026 . He can come back to his job if he drops \nthis nonsense.\"\n\nPublicly the Saudis brush off Khilewi as a minor nuisance. \"I don't think this young man could lead eight ducks \nacross the street,\" Bandar said. Added Saudi Embassy spokesman Osama Nugali: \"This is not a big deal to our \ngovernment.\"\n\nSaudi representatives say privately that Khilewi is unstable and point to his theory -- apparently lacking any \nevidence -- that King Fahd was involved in the murder of his half-brother, King Faisal, in 1975. Khilewi also has \nstoked some reporters' suspicions by demanding money for security guards as a condition for face-to-face \ninterviews.\n\nAziz Abu Hamad, associate director of the New York-based Human Rights Watch/Middle East, a private group, said \nhe does not think Khilewi is unbalanced. \"He's passionate, but reasonable and cautious, careful in what he says,\" \nHamad said. But mostly, Hamad said, Khilewi is brave.\n\n\"Considering the persecution of Saudi people who voice the mildest dissent,\" Hamad said, \"it takes a lot of courage \nto say half the things Khilewi says\u2026 .The royal family is deeply concerned about his dissent.\" Several princes have \narranged telephone calls and visits to Khilewi in New York by at least six of his relatives, who failed to persuade him \nto return home, Hamad and another source said.\n\nKhilewi said Abdulrahman Rassi, the Saudi man who supposedly threatened him, is an intelligence agent who had \nmoved into his apartment building to monitor his activities after Saudi officials came to suspect his loyalty. Khilewi \nsaid in an affidavit to the INS that during their talk Khilewi gave Rassi, as a sign of good faith, his 9mm pistol and \n\"the security file,\" not otherwise described.\n\nRassi did not return telephone messages left for him at the U.N. mission; the Wall Street Journal has quoted him as \nsaying he worked only as a diplomat.\n\nLast month another Saudi diplomat joined Khilewi. Ahmed Zahrani, vice consul at the Saudi consulate in Houston, \napplied for political asylum in London and also is denouncing the Saudi regime.\n\nKhilewi said his distaste for Saudi abuses grew as he gained access to more documents while at the United \nNations. Four of his cousins had been jailed for activities in an underground movement protesting the royal family's \npolicies, and another was jailed in 1991 for being one of the first Saudi women to drive a car, a violation of Saudi \nlaw.\n\nKhilewi, while not religious, said he was impressed by a group of Saudi Islamic scholars who set up a group in \nLondon to protest the Saudi government's civil rights record. He also disagreed with the Saudis' signing of the \nnuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1988 -- thinking it precludes Third World nations like Saudi Arabia from \ndeveloping weapons the great powers have.\n\nHis lawyers, the father-son team of Leon and Michael Wildes, who filed his asylum application on June 14, said the \nUnited States rarely grants asylum to citizens of U.S. allies. In the 1980s, they said, Washington granted asylum to \nabout 3 percent of those requesting it from U.S.-allied El Salvador, while granting asylum to 30 percent of those \nfrom Nicaragua, whose leftist government the United States opposed.\n\n\"U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia aside, we hope the U.S. government will look to the merits of this case, particularly \nbecause our client has corroborated the threats against his and his family's lives,\" Michael Wildes said.\n\nWildes, a former federal prosecutor, said he is concerned that U.S. officials may not aggressively investigate \nKhilewi's claims. Wildes said he met twice with FBI agents a month ago and told the agents about his client's \nallegations of Saudi complicity in spying and terrorism -- including possible assassination attempts against foreign \n\n\n\ndiplomats in the United States, and allegations that some U.S. officials knowingly allowed terrorists to enter this \ncountry.\n\nYet Wildes said the FBI agents expressed little interest in the information and did not keep any of Khilewi's \ndocuments. The bureau reversed itself and started the probe, Wildes said, only after news reports on the case.\n\nFor years groups such as Amnesty International have charged the Saudis with a wide array of abuses, including \narrest of dissidents, torture of criminals and political prisoners, and a ban on political parties and unions. The State \nDepartment has acknowledged Saudi abuses in annual reports to Congress, but U.S. policymakers avoid public \ndiscussion of the issue because of the Saudis' oil and their strategic importance.\n\nA State Department official said, \"We have no credible evidence of Saudi government support for terrorism.\" The \ndepartment declined to comment on Khilewi's asylum request.\n\nA 1994 State Department report on terrorism said that \"some private Saudi citizens probably provide private funds \nto Hamas and other radical Palestinian groups throughout the region, as well as to extremist elements in Somalia, \nSudan and Yemen. Saudi benefactors also sponsor paramilitary training for radical Muslims from many countries in \ncamps in Afghanistan, Yemen and Sudan.\"\n\nSpecial correspondent Yasmine Bahrani contributed to this report.\n"}
