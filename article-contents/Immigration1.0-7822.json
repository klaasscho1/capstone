{"title": "CITIZEN STRUGGLES FOR PROOF LOST PAPERS: NATURALIZED AS A CHILD, PALO ALTO WOMAN'S ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN PASSPORT LED TO BUREAUCRATIC NIGHTMARE.", "body": "\nDianne Bradley is certain there are other immigrants out there about to stumble onto the citizenship nightmare she \ndid.\n\nShe tells her cautionary tale for those who go through life thinking they are American citizens and one day discover \nthey don't have the legal paper to prove it.\n\n\"My life is kind of on hold until I get some kind of proof of who I am,\" said Bradley, a mother of two who lives in \nPalo Alto. \"I feel kind of like a nomad right now.\"\n\nBradley immigrated to the United States with her parents from the Netherlands in 1957. She was 3 years old.\n\nIn 1962, her parents became naturalized citizens. Because she and an older sister were minors, they \nautomatically became naturalized citizens, too. \"My whole life is in the United States, where I've lived, had my \nchildren, made my place,\" said Bradley, an account coordinator for Intuit. \"This is my home. It's absurd that after all \nthese years, I don't have the right to travel, come and go as I please.\"\n\nBradley, 46, had planned a cruise to the Caribbean with her daughter for her 17th birthday in June. After four \ndecades in the country, Bradley needed a passport for the first time. The cruise would cross into international \nwaters, the travel agent told her.\n\nThat's when Bradley learned she can't get a passport because she can't prove she's a U.S. citizen: She's missing \nher citizenship papers.\n\nA search through old files of her parents, now deceased, yielded no help.\n\n\"Every single document exists except for the naturalization papers,\" she said.\n\nNot knowing where to turn, she started with the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n\n\"That's when the nightmare really began,\" said Bradley, a patient and organized woman who has kept a mini-diary \nrecording her interactions with the immigration office.\n\nAfter standing in line for two mornings at the immigration office in San Jose, she had been given three different \nversions of what she needed to do: get a green card, get an application for citizenship and get a verification \napplication of citizenship.\n\n\nThen there was the G639, the Freedom of Information-Privacy Act Report. Andyet another form to seek \nconfirmation from the New Jersey court that naturalized her family.\n\nThis week, she logged on the Internet and downloaded the N565, an application for a replacement of a citizenship \ncertificate.\n\nTime, however, has run out and Bradley has canceled the birthday present. The cruise would have started on her \ndaughter's 17th birthday, June 24.\n\n\"We were just so psyched for this,\" she said. \"This ship was just huge, the ship we were going on.\"\n\nImmigration attorney Robert Mautino said it's hard to say how many other child immigrants, now grown, may not \nhave hung on to their citizenship papers. \"There are a lot of children who are naturalized at the time their parents \nare,\" said Mautino, of San Diego, who specializes in citizenship laws.\n\nWhile many families recognize the importance of keeping naturalization records in a secure place, some may have \nlost track of them over the years because they were rarely asked to furnish them, he said.\n\nAlthough there is a heightened awareness of immigration issues today, immigrants who arrived in the 1940s and \n'50s came by boat and their legal status to stay was rarely questioned, said Mautino.\n\n\"Once people got here, there was no need for documents inside the country,\" Mautino said. \"So people could live \nand work and do everything they wanted to do here without any need for documents.\"\n\nBradley knows she was naturalized with her parents because her older sister has a copy of her citizenship \ncertificate, dated May 25, 1962.\n\nShe's not the first to have lost her paperwork. The INS Northern California district office gets more than 1,000 \napplications for replacement of citizenship papers a year, said INS spokeswoman Sharon Rummery.\n\n\"This might pose a cautionary tale for parents who have naturalized to be certain to hand the papers down to their \nchildren,\" she said.\n\nWhat has held up Bradley's request is that the INS computerized its database only as far back as the mid-'60s. Her \nfiles likely were archived and those searches can take more than a year, Rummery said.\n\n\"If a person entered in the '60s or before, it's possible there is no record of that reflected in the computers,\" she \nsaid.\n\nMeanwhile, Bradley has sought assistance from Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Palo Alto.\n\nEshoo's chief of staff, John Flaherty, said Friday the congresswoman \"got the (INS) logjam unjammed. Dianne is \nexpected to receive a letter some time next week confirming she's a naturalized citizen,\" Flaherty said.\n\n\"There are probably more than a few people who take the evidence of their citizenship for granted,\" he said. \"They \nhaven't had to produce the documents, haven't had to apply for a passport. Our advice is everyone reading this \n(should) go look for their papers.\"\n\nNotes\n\nSHORTER VERSION: page 2B, Morning Final edition\n\n\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPhoto;\n\nPHOTO: RICHARD KOCI HERNANDEZ -- MERCURY NEWS\n\nAs a child, Dianne Bradley of Palo Alto became a naturalized citizen with her immigrant parents, but without her \npapers, she has had trouble finding proof to obtain a passport.\n\n[000501 LO 1B]\n"}
