{"title": "AUTOMATIC CITIZENSHIP ISN'T UNIQUE", "body": "\nThe statement\n\n\"Why do we have automatic citizenship upon birth? We're the only country in the world that has it.\"\n\nGlenn Beck on June 10 on his Fox News program\n\n* * *\n\nThe ruling - FALSE\n\nFox News' Glenn Beck raised an immigration hot button that has gained some legislative traction, the issue of \nwhether the United States ought to continue to grant citizenship to any child born in this country, even if the \nparents are illegal immigrants.\n\n\"You know, the anchor baby thing has always really hacked me off,\" Beck said. \"You know the anchor baby. You \nknow what that is. It's when a child that is born here becomes a citizen and they help the illegal parents become \ncitizens, right?\"\n\nIn April, Rep. Nathan Deal, a Republican who is also a candidate for governor of Georgia, proposed H.R. 1868, the \nBirthright Citizenship Act of 2009. It seeks to amend immigration law so that babies born in the United States \nwould be granted citizenship only if one of the parents is a U.S. citizen or national, is a legal permanent resident or \nis serving in the U.S. armed forces. The legislation currently has 77 co-sponsors, 76 Republicans and one \nDemocrat.\n\nEvery year, about 400,000 babies are born to mothers who are undocumented immigrants in the United States, \naccording to Jon Feere, a legal policy analyst at the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nOur aim is not to enter the fray over the proposed legislation, but to check Beck's claim that the United States is the \nonly country that grants automatic citizenship to anyone born in the country.\n\nAnd to that end, we refer to a report from NumbersUSA, a group dedicated to reducing immigration levels, and \nwhich backs Deal's bill. The group found that in addition to the United States, 33 other countries offer automatic, \nunconditional citizenship to children born within their borders.\n\nThey offer several qualifiers. No Western European nations grant birthright citizenship. Canada is the only \ndeveloped nation other than the United States to do so. No nation in the group, other than the United States, has \nmore than 200 million people. Only the United States, Pakistan and Mexico have 50 million or more.\n\n\nWe might be inclined to cut Beck some slack if the only other countries were St. Lucia, Antigua and Lesotho. But \nCanada, Brazil, Romania, Argentina? It might be surprising to Americans that automatic citizenship isn't more \ncommon, but the bottom line is that Beck made a blanket statement that is wrong. We rate it False.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPHOTO (2)\n"}
