{"title": "Haitian Group to Be Released", "body": "\nImmigration officials agreed to release a group of children and pregnant women who were among 411 Haitian \nrefugees brought ashore by the Coast Guard a week ago.\n\nThe 10 women -- including one with two small children -- and 12 unaccompanied children will be placed with \nrelatives or sponsoring families by church groups in the area.\n\nThe women and children are the first Haitians released from the group that was found April 22 on a crowded boat \nthat had drifted within four miles of the U.S. coast. The United States typically turns away such boats. But President \nClinton made an exception because authorities said they feared the Haitians were being abused.\n\nEarlier, eight Haitian men were moved to jail facilities in Broward County after authorities said their interviews \ndetermined they belonged in criminal facilities. Another man escaped by walking away from Jackson Memorial \nHospital.\n"}
