{"title": "OUR OPINIONS: SUPREME COURT: Worker protections diminished", "body": "\nIn rejecting back pay for an illegal immigrant who was among a group of workers wrongfully fired for their \nunionization efforts, the U.S. Supreme Court did not discourage illegal immigration; it made illegal immigrants even \nmore attractive as employees.\n\nThe high court ruled 5-4 that Jose Castro, an undocumented Mexican who had used a friend's ID to get his job, \nwas not entitled to the back pay awarded to three other laid-off workers because Castro had violated the \nImmigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 by using fraudulent documents to get a job.\nAJC\n\nIn other words, since Castro was working here without legal authorization, he was not entitled to the legal \nprotections that are the right of American workers.\n\nWriting for the majority, Chief Justice William Rehnquist remarked: \"Indeed, awarding back pay in a case like this \nnot only trivializes the immigration laws, it also condones and encourages future violations.\"\n\nHardly.\n\nDesperate undocumented workers will continue to seek employment here, and there will always be someone \nwilling to look the other way when work authorization documents are produced. Companies now have an additional \nincentive to hire undocumented workers, given that the ruling is tantamount to immunity from universal fair labor \npractices. Expect more reports of employers shorting earnings, ignoring work-site hazards and occupational \ninjuries, sexually harassing female workers and thwarting unionization without fear of reprisal --- all abuses from \nwhich U.S. workers are protected by law.\n\nThe court has placed the ball squarely in Congress' court, where legislation needs to be expedited to ensure there \nis no loophole in workers' rights. Congress designed the immigration laws to protect our borders, not to allow \nemployers to abuse and exploit undocumented immigrants.\n"}
