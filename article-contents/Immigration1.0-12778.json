Pages 2,3\n\nMark McGhee was last  night spat at as he walked from the dugout to the dressing room following Aberdeen s exit \nfrom the Active Nation Scottish Cup at the hands of first division Raith Rovers.\n\nThe Pittodrie manager, stunned and shocked by the vitriol of the home support at the end of what he described as \nthe worst result in more than 800 games as a coach on both sides of the border, said that he was prepared to \naccept the criticism as the club once more limped out of a cup competition to a team from the lower leagues.\n\nMcGhee, disgusted by his side s ineptitude against the Fifers, understood how the fans felt considering that in \nrecent years Queen s Park, Queen of the South, Dunfermline Athletic and Dundee have all beaten Aberdeen in \neither the Scottish or Co-operative Insurance Cup tournaments.\n\n This is without any shadow of a doubt, the worst result   and I don t mean this with any disrespect to Raith Rovers, \nthey firmly deserved their win    in the 800-odd games I ve had as a manager,  he said.   I ve lost play-offs and all \nthat, but I ve lost doing well. \n\n This was the worst result of my managerial career and that walk from the dugout to the tunnel was the most \nhumiliating experience of my life. In any circumstance it was awful and I told the  players they set me up for that. It \nis unacceptable.\n\n There was stuff getting thrown, a couple of scarves and bits of paper. I took my time walking down there because I \nwanted them to have their say. I felt they deserved to vent their anger and they deserved the opportunity to vent it \nto me. I s not something I m going to dwell on. I m going to use it as an incentive and I don t want to accuse anyone \nnor do I want any inquiries or post-mortems as to who spat or who threw paper or who was shouting. \n\n We deserved it. I had a part to play in it as well, of course, so I m not innocent.  As much as I wasn t out there   not \ngoing for headers or not going for tackles   I still had a part to play because before the game I had an opportunity to \ntalk to them. Clearly, I didn t get my message to them right so I was part of it and I deserve the stick the players \ndeserve.  I am prepared to accept it.\n\n Will the players bring me down? That won t happen. \n\nMeanwhile, John McGlynn, the Raith manager, was ecstatic with his side s deserved win through Gregory Tade s \ngoal on the hour mark.\n\nHe said:  I am so proud of  the players. In the build-up to this game we had blow after blow with the car accident to \nMark Campbell then in the warm-up Dougie Hill getting injured. Then, 25 minutes into the game Johnny Russell \nhad to come off. It s amazing what our players have achieved.  It was my best-ever result. \n\nAlly McCoist has urged Rangers  players and staff to put the club s interests ahead of their own.\n\nAs the Ibrox outfit remain \u00a331m in debt and in search of a new owner, several key  players are out of contract in \nthe summer.

Of course that s important to us as individuals, but we have to accept that \nit s not the most important thing.\n\n Some of the boys have got contracts up and they never mention it; they just get their work done.

The future is so uncertain at Ibrox that the greater concern is why a buyer has so far not made \na serious bid for the club.\n\n It mystifies you up to a point but, at the same time, there would be legitimate reasons,  McCoist says.  The current \n[financial] climate we re just coming out of would be a major factor. Four or five years ago, there might have been \npeople queueing up to buy it. \n\nRangers v St Mirren.

The Unite \nunion is  very concerned  at the proposals. \n\nJob cuts Page 4 \n\nLady Gaga s a Brit over the top\n\n Ally McCoist s career at Rangers has brought distinction, but he does not always seek prominence. In discussing \nthe club s financial plight, he stresses that his concerns are those of a supporter, rather than the team s assistant \nmanager. As ever with McCoist, without being mawkish, his sentiment is provocative.\n\nHe can remember a time when the best that Rangers could aspire to was qualifying for the Uefa Cup by beating \nMotherwell in the final game of the season. That was May 1986, just as the Graeme Souness revolution was about \nto begin in earnest. The championship then was a nostalgic ambition.\n\nWalter Smith was concerned enough about Rangers  immediate prospects, if a buyer does not emerge for the club, \nto speak out recently. He warned, with gravity, of the team s situation worsening in the summer. With several \nplayers nearing the end of their contracts, the threat is of a form of asset-stripping that would leave the squad \ndeeply compromised.\n\nThe future at Ibrox is uncertain, and McCoist is cautious about imagining how it might unfold. His natural ebullience \nis enough to keep the bleakest thoughts at bay. But then his association with the club stretches back beyond the \ntimes when it has been his employer, so he applies a perspective that is solemn.\n\n It s only a worry for me because it s my football club,  he says.  It has been since I was a wee boy and it s \nthousands of other people s football club and it s the same concern to them. The most important thing is the club, \nnot what s going to happen to myself or Kenny [McDowall] or indeed, any of the players whose contracts are up. Of \ncourse that s important to us as individuals, but we have to accept that it s not the most important thing. I ll survive. \n\nAlmost 24 years ago, Rangers needed the audacity of Souness s haughty aspiration, and significant funds, to \ndrastically redefine the club s limits. McCoist was part of the team that had been languishing in mediocrity before \nthe radical impact of the new manager, with Smith at his side, led to the arrival of such established players as Terry \nButcher and Chris Woods.  I remember those days, I was involved in those days, I was probably the reason for \nthose days,  McCoist grins as he recalls the 85/86 season when Rangers finished fifth.\n\nThe humour is, as always, waggish and selfless. There is poignancy in the recollection, though, because of fears \nthat Rangers  circumstances   Sir David Murray seeking a buyer and Lloyds Bank wishing to recoup their \u00a331m \ndebt   could return the club to a position of such indifference. The scenario is daunting, but remote since the gap \nbetween the Old Firm and the rest of Scottish football is now more pronounced.\n\n\n\n I couldn t see that [situation recurring], but to be brutally honest that s maybe because I don t want to look at that \nbigger picture,  McCoist says.   It s not through ignorance, I just think we ll be okay. I m half-full rather than half-\nempty. You don t know what the future s going to hold, but I would be hopeful that it didn t become that. \n\nIf there is agitation in the minds of the players and staff at Murray Park, it is suppressed by a profound sense of \npurpose. Having endured the consequences of economic upheaval, the squad has reduced in size and so become \nconcentrated in its motivations.\n\nThe intent of the players can sometimes seem a little devout, but then it is a form of diversion. Significant figures \nsuch as Kris Boyd, Nacho Novo, Kirk Broadfoot and DaMarcus Beasley are all out of contract in the summer, but \nthere have been no histrionics at Ibrox. Rangers have lost only one league match all season, are 10 points clear at \nthe top, play in the Co-operative Insurance Cup final next month and face St Mirren tonight in the Active Nation \nScottish Cup fifth-round replay.\n\n Some of the boys have got contracts up and they never mention it, they just get their work done,  McCoist says.  \nThey ve got to be concerned about it, it s natural, but they re handling it really well. The welfare of the club is the \nmost important thing, all the players will tell you that. In an ideal situation it would have been sorted out sooner \nrather than later. But the most important thing is that when it does get done, it s done right and done properly, so \nthe club is in a better state and far healthier. As impatient as we all might be, we have to accept it, because it s so \nimportant to so many people. \n\nThere is a touching superstition to McCoist, so that he avoids talking of a potential treble, or even directly \naddressing his own prospects of succeeding Smith. The Rangers manager is thought to be considering the summer \nas the right time to leave and many believe his assistant is the likely replacement. Such an outcome depends upon \nwho is in charge of the club, of course, and McCoist is content enough to praise the job Smith is doing now.\n\n I ve got ambitions to be a manager,  he says.  But if you had to be under anybody in these unfortunate \ncircumstances, Walter would be the one. \n\nThe heartfelt sincerity, and sheer irrepressibility, of McCoist is vital, too.\n\n Somewhere amid all the excitement surrounding the arrival of Robbie Keane et al, Shaun Maloney has become the \nforgotten man of Parkhead.\n\nThe willingness of Tony Mowbray to adopt a more fluent approach to the game should have given Maloney fresh \nimpetus, but injury has again contrived against him, limiting his first-team appearances under Mowbray to just 16.\n\nHis absence extended beyond five months and despite suffering a setback on his recent return to training, his \nformer team-mate, Steve Guppy, believes he will yet breathe fresh life into Celtic s ailing title challenge.\n\n  It has been hard and I do feel for him,  Guppy told The Herald.  He is the most dedicated footballer I have played \nwith or worked with so I hope that sooner or later he can put all these injuries behind him and get back to the player \nhe was. \n\n I have no doubt he will come back stronger. Everyone gets injured in the game, it just comes with it. Shaun has \nmaybe been unlucky in that they have all come at once, but there is no doubt in my mind he will put all that behind \nhim and he will be a big player for Celtic this season and in the future. \n\nGuppy, who moved to Celtic from Leicester City in 2001 to rejoin Martin O Neill and collected a league winner s \nmedal during his stay, also has sympathy for the challenges that Mowbray is facing in his debut season in the \nClydesdale Bank Premier League. \n\nWhile Mowbray s promise of an easier-on-the-eye method of winning games has come to fruition, defensive frailties \nhave undermined his challenge. Guppy urges the Celtic fans to have patience and continue to buy into the \nMowbray mantra.\n\n\n\nHe said:  Everyone must understand that it is not an easy job. It is one of the toughest jobs in football. When I met \nhim, you could tell he was a guy with class and I really hope that he gets it right. It is such a difficult job but you earn \nthe right to manage such a team and he did that at West Brom so he knows what he is doing. I am sure before long \nthey will be exactly where everyone wants them to be. \n\n At a massive club like Celtic there are always expectation levels, you have to win every game. Tony is a successful \nmanager; otherwise he wouldn t be in charge of Celtic. Sometimes it just takes time to work. I wouldn t have \nthought Robbie Keane would have gone to Celtic so he obviously believes in what is going to happen there. \n\nGuppy is taking his first tentative steps into management with Major League Soccer side Colorado Rapids. He is \nassistant to the former Wycombe midfielder, Gary Smith, and after a  19-year career during which he was capped \nfor England, he is enjoying life on the other side of the fence.\n\nFormer players often talk of how they miss the game once they have been forced to hang up their boots but Guppy \nis enjoying an unexpected new lease of life.\n\n  I hadn t given a lot of thought to it to be honest,  he said.  I sort of stumbled into it in many ways. I have only been \ndoing it for two years now, so I am still learning my way but I am really enjoying it. The prospect of working with \nprofessionals every day is a good one. \n\n I played until I was 39 so I had a good crack at it, to be fair. There is nothing like playing, but the coaching side of \nthings is very involved, it takes up a lot more of your time than playing so you don t really have time to stop and \nthink about anything. I don t miss it as much as I thought I would because there is just so much to do. \n\nHistory, it seems, is not on St Mirren s side. You have to go back to 1926 to find the last time the Paisley club beat \nRangers in a Scottish Cup tie   they went on to win the tournament for the first time   and back to 1991 to find the \nlast time they triumphed at Ibrox. \n\nAn opportunity to end both those records presents itself this evening when the sides meet in an Active Nation \nScottish Cup fifth round replay, with St Mirren perhaps a touch aggrieved at not having progressed in Paisley 11 \ndays ago having enjoyed the better of the chances. \n\nEven with reduced gate prices, including free entry for under-16s, tonight s replay provides a much-needed \nfinancial boon for both clubs. Of greater incentive, though, is the chance to make it through to a quarter-final tie at \nhome against Dundee United. \n\nThere will be many who will feel St Mirren s chances of doing so may have already passed. Rangers, after all, have \nlost only once domestically in the best part of a year and survived a tricky away tie at Hamilton in the previous \nround only to prosper in the replay on home soil   albeit requiring extra-time to do so. \n\nWalter Smith s side will be strong favourites but can expect to be pushed all the way by a St Mirren side who \ndominated against Dundee United last weekend only to lose two late goals and all three points. Gus MacPherson \nhopes his side can take heart from that performance and from their encouraging display in the original tie. \n\n We have to play like we did in the first game,  insisted the manager.  We need to show the same type of attitude \nand we have to play with a belief that we can get a result.  \n\nMacPherson was at Ibrox on Sunday to take in Rangers  3-0 defeat of Hibernian and, while impressed with what he \nsaw, the St Mirren manager preferred to keep his focus on his own team. \n\n In every game we play it s about St Mirren, not about the opposition,  he added.  We have to perform, no matter \nwhat system we play and we have to compete in order to get a result. But we trust our group and in the last five or \nsix weeks I can t fault them in terms of their effort and commitment. I m sure we ll get all that in abundance again.  \n\nMacPherson hopes to have Steven Robb available this evening after the winger turned in arguably his finest \nperformance in a St Mirren shirt against United at the weekend. Robb limped off towards the end of that game but \n\n\n\nshould be available.  I picked up cramp but hopefully I ll be all right,  he said.  It s just down to a lack of games \nbecause my last start was a few weeks ago, so it took its toll a bit but I should be okay for the games coming up. \nNow it s a case of trying to get more consistency into my game.  \n\nRangers, undefeated domestically since losing to Aberdeen in November, will provide stiff opposition but Robb \nremains optimistic that St Mirren can somehow pull off an upset. \n\n Rangers are on a good run and I think they are 19 games unbeaten,  he acknowledged.  I watched them on \nSunday and they are an impressive side. All we can do is concentrate on our own jobs but if we can create enough \nchances against them, then you never know. \n\nSEX And The City star Sarah Jessica Parker arrives at a New York Fashion Week event as the newly appointed \nchief creative officer and president of the US fashion label Halston.

The animation is sublime, and the story a gentle, \nmoving fable about a man whose traditional trade as a magician, even in the late 1950s setting, is becoming \nanachronistic. \n\nAdapted from a script by Jacques Tati, this starts in Paris, where the illusionist Taticheff is struggling to find an \naudience. He packs his top hat and tricks and heads to London, only to find that audiences there are more \ninterested in the new rock * roll than his rabbit out of a hat. When Billy Boy and the Britoons take the stage, \nTaticheff heads for Scotland. \n\nThough the magician s performance in an island pub goes well, the appearance of a juke box prompts another \nmove, to Edinburgh. \n\nIt is in these sequences that the film s pastel-shaded animation soars to amazing heights, Chomet and his team \npresenting a city at once recognisable and with a period hue that makes it particularly magical. \n\nA convicted sex attacker will no longer face prosecution for allegedly breaching a court order aimed at stopping him \noffending.\n\n\n\nJohn Bermingham was due to face two charges of breaching an interim Sopo by using public service vehicles \nduring school travel times.\n\nBut judges at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh were told yesterday that there would be no further \nproceedings against him over the charges.\n\nBermingham, 43, had planned to mount a human rights challenge against the restrictions. But advocate-depute Iain \nMcSporran told the judges:  There shall be no further proceedings on that indictment. \n\nHe said the decision followed a change in the conditions applied to the order on Bermingham, which no longer \nincludes the public transport ban he was alleged to have breached, and taking into account the time he spent on \nremand prior to being released on bail last year.\n\nBermingham was jailed for nine years in 2002 for attempting to rape an 11-year-old girl  in Edinburgh.\n\nAN animated film that evokes the spirit of late 1950s Scotland has been hailed by critics as a potential classic after \nits premier.\n\nSylvain Chomet s The Illusionist, about an old-fashioned entertainer in Edinburgh who struggles to find his place in \nthe world as his public deserts his act in favour of rock  * roll, was described by one member of the audience at the \nprestigious Berlin International Film Festival as a  beautiful  and  affectionate  portrayal of the era.\n\nChomet, whose last feature Belleville Rendez-Vous was nominated for an Oscar, is based in Edinburgh and spent \n\u00a38 million on the project.\n\nThe reaction in Berlin was that it was money well spent.\n\nHannah McGill, artistic director of the Edinburgh International Film Festival and former film critic of The Herald, \nsaid:  The film is a joy and I think Chomet is a genius. The charm and detail that people loved in Belleville is all \nthere.\n\n What s more, I felt incredibly touched and proud to see Scotland presented so beautifully and affectionately. \n\nThe film, animated in hand-drawn 2-D, was primarily made at Chomet s animation studio Django Films, above a \npub on Edinburgh s George Street. \n\nAdapted from an unproduced script by the legendary French actor and director Jacques Tati, the storyline takes \nplace in Edinburgh and Iona after the lead character arrives from Paris in an attempt to change his luck.\n\nHowever, the director revealed Edinburgh almost didn t feature at all   as the original script  sent him to Prague. \n\nChomet said:  The story originally took place between Paris and Prague. And I wanted that changed to Paris and \nEdinburgh. I fell in love with Edinburgh when I presented Belleville Rendez-Vous there. I found the city a magical \nplace   there s something about the constantly changing light. And so my wife Sally and I decided to move to the \ncity and set up a studio. \n\n I had lived in Montreal when making Belleville Rendez-Vous and, as a result, there is a very Canadian feel to that \nmovie. I believe it s important to live in the same environment you are trying to animate, because your inspiration is \nthen all around.\n\n There is a story strand that takes place in a remote village, where the community gets electricity for the first time. I \nthought that isolation would fit one of the Scottish islands. I initially looked at Mull, which led me to the isle of Iona, \nits small neighbour in the Inner Hebrides. \n\n When I read the island s local history I was astounded to discover that at exactly the same period in which the Tati \nstory is set, the islanders had a party to celebrate the arrival of electricity from the mainland. So it was 100% \n\n\n\nhistorically accurate. It also made perfect sense for the illusionist to be playing in these last outreaches of \nvaudeville. \n\nChomet s insistence on hand-drawn 2-D graphics stems, the director said, from his love of the classic Disney \nmovies of the 1960s, such as One Hundred and One Dalmations. Some viewers in Berlin suggest that his film is a \nfable that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath. \n\nA sex offender has claimed in court that a ban on him watching pornography is a breach of his human rights.\n\nMartin Jones, who is deemed to be a high risk to women and children, is accused of violating the strict terms of his \nsupervised release order after being caught viewing pornography.\n\nHowever, Jones, who is also known as Miller, claimed the order banning him from using any computer or watching \npornographic material was not valid.\n\nHe had his bail continued and the case   the first of its kind to challenge the terms of a supervised release order   \nwill be heard at Perth Sheriff Court in two months  time.\n\nJones was jailed for 18 months last July for stalking a 12-year-old girl and leaving her traumatised. \n\nHe was also placed on a supervised release order for nine months after release. The order is said to have been \nbreached.\n\nAnd he was also placed on a Sexual Offences Prevention Order (Sopo) for the next five years and banned from \nbeing alone with any child under the age of 17.\n\nThe Sopo also bans him from living in a home with any child, living with any other sex offender and entering parks \nor school grounds for the same period.\n\nThe case comes just days after The Herald revealed that the number of sex offenders returned to prison for \nbreaching Sopos between 2007-8 and 2008-9 has almost doubled.\n\nNew research found that there has also been an increase in the number of convictions for serious violent or sexual \noffences in every community justice area in Scotland. \n\nJones was on supervised release upon being freed from jail and social workers   who said there is nothing they can \ndo to prevent him posing a danger to the public   imposed a ban on porn and computer usage.\n\nSolicitor John McLaughlin, defending, said:  This presents as a fairly straightforward matter where it is a breach of a \nsupervised release order.\n\n The problem identified is whether the conditions imposed are reasonable in terms of the powers contained in the \nlaw for the social worker to order Mr Miller to comply with.\n\n There may be an attack on it in terms of Human Rights legislation or by way of a Devolution minute. I don t think \nthis has raised its head in any other set of circumstances.\n\n We have written to the social work department asking for information about certain information they had which led \nto the condition being imposed.\n\n There is no mechanism for one to review a condition which has been imposed. It must be a  reasonable  condition \nso the position is that, from a human rights or devolution point of view, you can attack it as unreasonable. \n\nMr McLaughlin said the  issue only came to light  after the condition was imposed and then breached by Jones, \nwhen he was allegedly found viewing pornography.\n\n\n\nIT was the type of hubris that deserves to be captured in a song. Businessman Sir Ian Wood has been left red-\nfaced after a picture of Annie Lennox appeared in a glossy brochure promoting plans for a  new civic heart  for \nAberdeen.\n\nThe oil tycoon has pledged \u00a350 million of his own cash to kickstart the City Square project which will see Union \nTerrace Gardens turned into a  mini-Central Park .\n\nBut the former Eurythmics singer is publicly opposed to Sir Ian s  \u00a3140m proposals to raise the city centre gardens \nto street level.\n\nEarlier this month, Ms Lennox blasted the idea, claiming Aberdeen had already lost too much of its cultural heritage \nto bulldozers and urged residents to save the gardens. She said the people of the north-east should prevent the \ngreen space  being ripped out and concreted over .\n\nIt has since emerged that Ms Lennox s image has been used in a brochure which describes the project. An image \nof her performing is used to illustrate the idea that the square could be used to stage concerts.\n\nOn Tuesday, the City Square project team admitted that the brochure was being  phased out  following the \nembarrassing gaffe.\n\nHowever, Ms Lennox branded the so-called endorsement  ironic . She said:  They clearly  assumed  it would be \nfine by me, as it makes it look as if I m endorsing their vision   when I wasn t even asked, they just went ahead in \nany case. \n\nNicola Moore, who is running the City Square consultation, confirmed the leaflet was being replaced.\n\nShe said:  We certainly didn t intend to suggest that Ms Lennox supported the City Square project.\n\n We used an image we thought showed the type of venue that the new civic space could host. \n\nAberdeenshire Council was given a special audience with Sir Ian on Monday at its Woodhill House headquarters \nduring which he talked through his plans and answered questions on the project.\n\nIn a separate interview, Sir Ian hit out at Ms Lennox s earlier comments. He said:  In Annie Lennox s young days, \nUnion Terrace Gardens probably was very different to how it is now.\n\n I would ask her to come and see how under-utilised it is and the unsightly views there. It is a real architectural \nblight. \n\nArsene Wenger has no intention of using Arsenal s injury crisis as an excuse should his side fail to achieve a \npositive result against  FC Porto at Estadio do Dragao this evening.\n\nThe Frenchman is without five first-team regulars for the trip to Portugal, with goalkeeper Manuel Almunia, Russian \nplaymaker Andrey Arshavin and centre-half William Gallas the most significant absentees, leaving the 18-man \ntravelling party somewhat lighter than usual.\n\nAlex Song, the Cameroon midfielder, and the Croatia striker, Eduardo have also stayed in London but Wenger \nclaims being low on numbers should not be an issue for the Barclays Premier League side, who did not have a \ngame at the weekend.\n\n It is difficult to say how long they will be out,  said the Arsenal manager.  But it is not a serious concern. The \nconcern is that the players who are here perform at their best tomorrow. It is part of the season that you do not \nalways have all the players available to select the team but I am not bothered by that. \n\nWith Gallas unavailable because of a calf problem, veteran former captain Sol Campbell could be in line for his first \nEuropean appearance for the club since captaining them in the 2006 Champions League final against Barcelona.  \n\n\n\nThe 35-year-old has been used just twice since returning to the club but Wenger believes the former England \ninternational still has plenty to offer.\n\n Sol s experience can be important,  said the Arsenal manager.  For a central defender, it is a bit special [to still be \nplaying at 35] but, as long as you are hungry to work hard to keep yourself fit and you are not bothered by injuries, \nthen a central defender can play three or four years longer than a striker. \n\nArsenal s domestic title hopes have been reborn after Chelsea and Manchester United dropped points in the last \nset of Premier League matches.\n\nWenger, though, knows full well his depleted team face a stern test of their European credentials against the \nPortuguese champions, beaten 1-0 here by Chelsea in the group stages and by Cristiano Ronaldo s wonder strike \nfor Manchester United in last season s quarter-final.\n\n It is always difficult in Porto   they always have a team who is committed and technically very good,  said Wenger, \nwhose side have yet to win in Porto, following  a 2-0 defeat when they had already qualified in December 2008 and \na goalless draw four  seasons ago.\n\n You respect a team like Porto because you know they will always give you a good game. It is the last 16, a cup \ndraw, so it is always tight. We have 180 minutes where  we have to be on top and  no-one can predict what will \nhappen. \n\nDavid Moyes expects to be without midfielder Marouane Fellaini for the rest of the  season and to add to the \nfrustration of the Everton manager their Europa League hopes are hanging in the balance.\n\nMoyes  side seemed to shrug off the loss of Fellaini, who needs ankle surgery, by racing into a two-goal lead \nagainst Sporting Lisbon, thanks to Steven Pienaar and Sylvain Distin. However the game took a dramatic twist with \nfour  minutes remaining when Miguel Veloso scored from the spot in this round of 32 first leg match.\n\nThe penalty was awarded after Distin had floored Liedson as he tried to surge forward, and the defender was sent \noff in the process. It means Everton now face a difficult return match in Portugal a week on Thursday after looking \nso comfortable for so long.\n\nFellaini will again be looking on from the sidelines after being hurt in a challenge with Liverpool s Sotirios \nKyrgiakos, who was sent off in the derby.\n\n Fellaini is not good,  Moyes said.  He has an injury similar to Robin van Persie and that could keep him out for six \nmonths. We will not be sure until the operation takes place. He has played really well this season and been part of \nthe reason behind our improvement. He has been a big miss to us already. \n\nMoyes could not hide his disappointment at the way they let Sporting back into the tie. Pienaar made the \nbreakthrough in the 35th minute with a good finish after being set up by Tim Cahill, who came off with a calf injury. \nDistin extended Everton s lead in the 49th minute after goalkeeper Rui Patricio flapped at Leighton Baines  corner.\n\n The perspective of the game changed,  Moyes said.   I thought we were more liable to win 3-0 than 2-1. We looked \nas though we were trying to conserve our energy rather than going for another goal.\n\n We did enough to be 2-0 in front and I did not see a goal coming. But it was not to be. We are disappointed we \nhave not seen the job through, which we should have done. We gave Sporting an opportunity when it looked as \nthough they might not have one. \n\nDavid Beckham had to  settle for second best as the team he loves overcame the one he plays for in the San Siro.\n\nTwo second-half goals from Wayne Rooney installs last season s beaten finalists as favourites to book a place in \nthe Champions League quarter-finals. Not even the concession of a third-minute opener for AC Milan, created by \n\n\n\nBeckham for Ronaldinho, could stop Sir Alex Ferguson s troops, although they were forced to endure a nervy  finish \nafter Clarence Seedorf hauled Milan back into the tie five minutes from time.\n\nIt took a fortunate Paul Scholes effort to bring United level before the break. But after surviving another spell of \nMilan pressure after half-time, Rooney stamped his class on the contest, scoring his first two European goals of the \nseason to take his tally to 25.\n\nIt hadn t started well for United, Patrice Evra s attempt to clear setting Ronaldinho up, although Edwin van der Sar \nhad the shot covered before it deflected off Michael Carrick and ended up in the opposite corner.\n\nFor an old team, Milan clearly had something left. Their passing had United twisting and turning, looking for all the \nworld like a team on the edge of a very big cliff, not knowing precisely where the bottom was. Ronaldinho, Luca \nAntonini and Klaas Jan Huntelaar twice came close to finding Van der Sar s net again. If a couple of them had gone \nin, Ferguson could not have complained.\n\nAs it was, apart from  Beckham, the only other  Class of 92  graduate on the pitch was about to make a decisive \ncontribution. Scholes has peppered the intervening years with a number of goals that will be admired decades from \nnow. This was not among them. Swinging at Darren Fletcher s low cross, Scholes missed the ball completely with \nhis right foot, the ball striking him halfway up the shin of his standing left. What could only be described as a \nfreakish deflection not only took it the six yards to Dida s goal, but right in the bottom corner, giving the Brazilian no \nchance of keeping it out.\n\nMilan s response was  admirable, given what a blow that away goal was, United s first in five away games against  \na European heavyweight.  Andrea Pirlo forced a one-handed save out of Van der Sar with a 30-yard free-kick, then \nthe 39-year-old Dutchman required every inch of his  massive frame to flick a goalbound Ronaldinho effort round \nthe post.\n\nYet in that one stroke of good fortune for Scholes, it seemed the destiny of the tie had been shaped and a minute \nafter what turned out to be an inspired substitution, Rooney broke his European duck.\n\nAntonio Valencia, who had just replaced Nani, was the provider, sending over a cross from the right that allowed \nRooney to steer a header back over Dida into the opposite corner.\n\nNow the age in Milan s legs began to tell. And when Fletcher chipped another delightful ball into the area, Rooney \nstole between the centre-backs to head home once more.\n\nIt seemed a win and progress was assured, so Ferguson will be livid at the Seedorf effort five minutes from time \nthat ensured an uncomfortable ending and gives Milan a flicker of hope for the return in three weeks  time, when \nCarrick will be unavailable  following his dismissal deep into stoppage time.\n\nLaryea Kingston could make his Hearts return this weekend but only if he matches word with deed and convinces \nmanager Jim Jefferies that his attitude has changed.\n\nThe Ghanaian is poised to play in a bounce match tomorrow after missing two months with a hamstring problem. \nThe 29-year-old last played for Hearts in mid-December due to a hamstring problem and a combination of injury \nand a fall-out with Csaba Laszlo, the former manager, has restricted his appearances  to just five this season.\n\nHowever, Jefferies insists every player has a clean  slate but he wants to see renewed commitment  from the \nplaymaker.\n\n I ve had a chat with Larry and we know the problems,  Jefferies said.  He s got to remember that I m one of these \nmanagers who will soon know, with the experience I ve got, if he s genuine. I m sure he is.\n\n It will be good for everyone if he complies with the demands. It s about playing for the team and working hard. He \nseems keen enough to do it and forget what s gone on.\n\n\n\n He s like the rest of them who are out of contract. They have this period to show me they want to play for the club \nand that they ve got something to offer. \n\nBilly Reid, the Hamilton Academical manager, has received mixed news ahead of Saturday s trip to Hearts. \n\nWhile captain Alex Neil and James Wesolowski are both expected to return from hamstring problems, new signing \nDougie Imrie will serve a one-match suspension after collecting a sixth booking of the season in the 1-0 defeat to \nMotherwell 11 days ago.\n\nThe loss of the 26-year-old compounds Reid s attacking problems, with top scorer Mickael Antoine-Curier out \nfollowing knee surgery, but confidence is high among the New Douglas Park side after a narrow defeat on their last \nvisit to Tynecastle.\n\n We lost a penalty and the second goal straight after that the last time there but it s a game we feel we can go there \nand take something from,  he said.\n\nSuch optimism is helped by the return of midfielders Neil and James Wesolowski. The Australian has played only \nhalf an hour in and aborted comeback attempt last month since being injured in the 2-0 defeat to Celtic on Boxing \nDay, while  Neil has played just eight league games this season because of separate hip and hamstring injuries.\n\nReid added:  I m fairly hopeful both will be ready. It s been really disheartening for me that they have been out \nbecause they are the engine room of the team. \n\nPeter Houston is hoping to have his cake and to eat it. \n\nCraig Levein s decision to leave Dundee United to become the new Scotland manager could have left his former \nassistant out of work and wondering where the next pay cheque was coming from.\n\nInstead, Houston is now facing up to a possible future that includes combining the manager s role at Tannadice \nwith a part-time position as Levein s assistant with the national team. No wonder he could barely keep the smile off \nhis face at Hampden yesterday.\n\n That [outcome] would be perfect,  he said. After showing initial reluctance to step into Levein s shoes, Houston is \nthriving as interim manager at United. Should they continue in a similar vein and finish the season in at least fourth \nplace in the Clydesdale Bank Premier League, Tannadice chairman Stephen Thompson may offer the 51-year-old \nthe job on a permanent basis in the summer, while also graciously permitting him to join up with Levein for \ninternational matches.\n\nAll that will need to wait, however. For now, Houston s Scotland contract stretches to just one match, the friendly \nagainst the Czech Republic on March 3. As a passionate Scot, he hopes that his role will be extended to take in the \nforthcoming qualifying campaign for the 2012 European Championships, the fixtures for which will be decided in \nMadrid on Friday.\n\nThere is a frisson of excitement surrounding the national team just now following the acrimony and apathy prevalent \ntowards the end of the George Burley era. Houston, a modest player who flitted around the lower leagues in an \nunderstated career, can feel it too, and hopes to be a part of the management team that leads Scotland to a major \nfinals for the first time in 14 years.\n\n I was never good enough to play for Scotland,  he said matter-of-factly.  As a Falkirk player in the first division for \n10 years you re never going to make the Scotland team. If I get into the Scotland set-up and am able to help with \nthe European Championships that would be the pinnacle.\n\n People always say coaching and management is a poor second to playing, but that s not how I m feeling just now. \nI m very excited and very pleased to hopefully be involved with Scotland in the long term.\n\n\n\n If we qualify for the Euros I know how much it will mean to the nation being a Scotland fan myself. I remember \nwhen Scotland qualified for finals. It s been a while now so it would be great to do it again and I don t think it s \nbeyond us. \n\nLevein has joked that being Scotland manager is a cinch as long as you don t have to play any games, but even \nthose who did not initially support his appointment will surely have been impressed with the methodical, thorough \nmanner in which he has gone about his business.\n\nHouston, who was Levein s assistant at Hearts, Leicester City and United, gave further insight into the man many \nare hoping can lead Scotland from the wilderness. Any repeat of the Bevvygate scandal seems highly unlikely.\n\n There s no chance the players will mess with him,  he insisted.  In the early stages of us working together I quickly \nlearnt what he wanted and made sure it was done. He s not shy in telling his staff if they re not doing something \nright, including myself. If I was ever slack in the past he wasn t long in telling me. \n\n So I think players will want to play for him and he ll quickly gain their respect. There won t be any nonsense. There \nis a huge challenge ahead and with the Tartan Army cheering them on they ll get a team that gives 100%. \n\nHouston was a youth coach at Hearts just as the national manager s injury-plagued career was coming to an end. \nEven then, Levein s leadership skills were starting to become apparent.\n\n I was in charge of the youth team and used to take them up to the gym. Craig s knees were knackered but he used \nto punch a speedball for 45 minutes at a time. Have you ever tried that? See if you can do it for a couple of minutes.\n\n When I took the youth players up Craig showed them how to do it and guys like Robbie Neilson, Scott Severin and \nKenny Milne couldn t wait to get up to the gym to see Craig. In many ways he was coaching even then, not in a \nfootball sense but teaching others good habits. \n\n* Tickets for Scotland v Czech Republic, at Hampden Park, on March 3 are available now.

I would love nothing more than being 100% and \nchasing down players but some days are good and some days are bad. The manager knows that and that s why \nmaybe I might not train until Tuesday and won t train on Friday. \n\n I will fight tooth and nail to do my best for him; It s something I might be able to manage until the end of the season \nbut it s not ideal by any stretch of the imagination. \n\nfinal ad if required for Kirk funding story \n\nThe Scottish Storytelling Centre employs 12, although some posts are jointly funded by partners including the \nScottish Arts Council.

That s not cuisine   it s sensationalism. \n\nThe chef, who moved to England in 1972, is currently sharing his tips, techniques and recipes on BBC2 in his new \nseries, Raymond Blanc: Kitchen Secrets.\n\nAsked why he was doing a cookery series, he said:  I want to promote pure food and I think the time is right. People \nare moving away from the fast-food lifestyle and are becoming more responsible consumers and cooks. \n\nThe last season of The Restaurant, in which couples competed for the opportunity to go into business with Blanc, \nwas criticised by viewers over the choice of winner, while the couple who won the first series handed over control of \ntheir restaurant after just six months.\n\nTHE mystery of the human body s ability to protect itself against cancer and genetic disorders has been uncovered \nin new research.\n\nA study of cell reproduction by scientists at the University of Dundee revealed a clever mechanism which ensures \nhealthy chromosomes are passed on effectively to prevent disease.\n\n\n\nThe 46 chromosomes that make up human cells all carry vital genetic information and must be precisely copied and \nseparated as we grow.\n\nIf the process is disturbed it can cause disorders such as Down s syndrome.\n\nResearchers describe a  blindfold handshake  between microtubes   or threads   which capture chromosomes and \npull them apart into new cells.\n\nProfessor Tomo Tanaka said that scientists previously had little idea how the process was carried out so efficiently.\n\nSONY Ericsson breached advertising rules during the launch of a mobile phone which exaggerated its ability to use \nFacebook, a watchdog has ruled.\n\nThe TV ad showed a woman using the Satio phone to take photos and then showed the screen displaying icons for \nseveral applications, including the networking site Facebook.\n\nBut a viewer complained after buying the phone and finding it did not come with the Facebook application, which \nseemed incompatible with the handset.\n\nThe Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld the complaint, ruling that Sony Ericsson s use of the Facebook \nlogo was likely to mislead viewers.\n\nSony Ericsson said software problems meant the phone could not run Facebook when launched.\n\nSTAFF are to be axed at the Church of Scotland body that recruits new members and is behind Christian education \nas the fallout from the Kirk s financial woes continues. \n\nThe Church is trying to reduce its \u00a31.2 million deficit and the 44-strong department has been warned it will be \nreduced to just 24 after the revamp.\n\nThree regional offices in Glasgow, Perth and Inverness are to close with eight job losses and the number of posts \nacross the council will also be reduced although the Church declined to say which other areas would be hit.\n\nThe consultation comes as a separate review into the long-standing magazine to  investigate the meaning and \nplace of an editorially independent Life and Work in relation to the mission work of the Church  continues.\n\nConcerns over the review and consultation have already been raised internally as the magazine does well for the \nKirk, with a circulation of over 30,000, and is the best-selling monthly religious title in the UK with a six-figure net \nsurplus last year.\n\nHowever insiders said despite it being a key tool for communication with congregations, it is not gaining any new \nreaders.\n\nSt Andrew Press is the publishing house of the Church of Scotland, with a catalogue of around 200 titles, ranging \nfrom books that explore the Christian faith to histories and biographies.\n\nPart of the role of the Scottish Storytelling Centre, which is owned by the Kirk, is to teach people how to interest \nchildren and adults in Biblical studies.\n\nThe Church s director Dr Donald Smith courted controversy earlier this year when he insisted Robert Burns is a \ngreater Scottish icon than Kirk founding father John Knox at a time when religious commentators had raised the \napparent lack of commemoration of this year s 450th anniversary of Knox s Reformation of 1560.\n\nA recent review of the department, called the Council of Mission and Discipleship, found that  its core objective of \ndefining the overall mission of the Church was not being achieved effectively and efficiently .\n\n\n\nDepartmental convener Reverend Mark Johnstone said:  There is a need for Mission and Discipleship to have a \nclear vision and purpose and we feel that has been lost in recent years. Too many of our areas are operating in \nisolation from each other, with a repetition of work taking place as a result.  \n\nThe Kirk said employees of the council were informed of the consultation process and all will have the opportunity \nto comment on the proposals before any final decisions are taken.\n\nThe trade union Unite has also been invited to take part in the consultation.\n\nMr Johnstone added:  The proposals involve a reduction in the number of employees we have across the board. At \nthe moment we have 44 posts and under the proposals that would reduce to 24.\n\n I recognise that this will be a difficult and uncertain time for many of our employees but we are committed to \nworking with them to ensure that any changes are managed sensitively.\n\n It is important to state that this is not about the performance of individual people or posts but about the overall \nshape and effectiveness of the council. \n\nGordon Casey, regional officer for Unite, said:  We are formally involved in the consultation.

One option under consideration is to Merge the New \nPyjamas campaign into the main body of the hospital.\n\nDavid Reith, current chairman of the trustees of the SKFF, said:  We want to thank the staff who worked on the \nNew Pyjamas campaign for their dedication, effort and hard work.\n\n However, it became clear to the trustees that the New Pyjamas campaign would not, under its current structure, \nmeet the targets initially set out. \n\n\n\nSTAFF at an animal rescue centre were amazed when a lost cat found its way there   despite having its head stuck \nin a food can.\n\nThe pet was discovered by workers at the centre in Fife with a Whiskas tin lodged up to its neck.\n\nThe Scottish SPCA, which runs the unit, said the female must have been scavenging and got her head stuck. They \nsay she was lucky not to have been hit by a car.\n\nColin Seddon, manager at the centre in Middlebank, Dunfermline, said:  Luckily no damage was done and the little \ncat was very pleased to be freed from the discomfort that comes with having your head stuck inside a tin can. We \nthink it s likely that she was scavenging and came across this discarded tin of cat food. \n\nThe cat wandered into the centre on Sunday morning and, after being checked over, was transferred to the Scottish \nSPCA s rescue unit in Balerno, Edinburgh.\n\nThe animal charity said it is possible she was dumped by someone who thought the unit was a re-homing centre. \nLocal inquiries have not tracked down her owner. \n\nMr Seddon said:  She is a friendly and well-looked after cat and she was wearing a distinctive black collar with \nbright green cats  eyes imprinted on the material.\n\n Because she s in such good condition, we d hope that she s simply lost.\n\n If that is the case, then we d encourage her owner to contact our animal helpline (03000 999 999) to get their lucky \nblack cat back. \n\nThe charity said the incident highlighted the threat posed to animals by discarded cans and other litter.\n\nTHE MacNeil of Barra, the 46th clan chief who could count US President Barack Obama among his former \nstudents, died  yesterday at the age of 80.\n\nIan Roderick MacNeil was a former law professor  at a university in Chicago.\n\nHe lived in Edinburgh, but kept a house on Barra, where his clan had been for over a thousand years.\n\nIn 2004 he gave 9000 acres of the island, as well as fishing and mineral rights, to Scottish ministers with a view to it \nbeing passed on to the community.\n\nIT is the music awards ceremony which   unlike its more sedate transatlantic cousin the Grammys   has earned a \nreputation for drawing out the anarchic side of pop.\n\nLast night s 30th Brit Awards marked a coming of age for the star-studded ceremony with a spectacular round of \nlive sets and (relatively) well-behaved stars.\n\nLady Gaga swept the board, but ditched plans to turn up on stage in a wrecked car to   perform her hits   including \nPoker Face   in favour of a low-key performance that included a tribute to her friend, the late fashion designer \nAlexander McQueen.\n\nThe only serious blip during the two-hour live show came from Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher who took to the \nstage determined to take a swipe at his brother and former bandmate Noel.\n\nAccepting Oasis s award for the Brits album of 30 years for their record (What s the Story) Morning Glory?, he \npointedly avoided thanking Noel, who forced the band s split last year when he walked out, blaming Liam s  violent \nand verbal intimidation .\n\nGallagher told the crowd:  Listen kids ... the best bands in the f****** world live forever , before hurling a microphone \ninto the audience. As he left the stage, host Peter Kay remarked:  What a k***head. \n\n\n\nCheryl Cole provided one of the high points of the evening as she braved the stage following allegations about her \nfootballer husband Ashley Cole to perform her hit Fight for this Love.  \n\nMeanwhile, after being introduced by Kay as  New York s answer to Sue Pollard , Lady Gaga took the stage \nwearing a huge white wig and veil to perform a low-key version of Telephone on the piano, which she dedicated to \nMcQueen.\n\nMeanwhile, one-time enfant terrible of British pop Lily Allen showed no sign of nerves as she opened the night by \ndescending on to the stage on a replica bomb to the sound of air raid sirens.  \n\nThe 24-year-old went on to take the award for British Female Solo Artist.\n\nAlthough Allen s performance went smoothly, the show suffered minor teething problems when the audio faltered \nas host Kay arrived on stage.

We \nthink it s likely that she was scavenging and came across this discarded tin of cat food. \n\nThe cat wandered into the centre on Sunday morning and, after being checked over, was transferred to the Scottish \nSPCA s rescue unit in Balerno, Edinburgh.\n\nThe animal charity said it is possible she was dumped by someone who thought the unit was a re-homing centre. \nLocal inquiries have not tracked down her owner. \n\nMr Seddon said:  She is a friendly and well-looked after cat and she was wearing a distinctive black collar with \nbright green cats  eyes imprinted on the material.\n\n Because she s in such good condition, we d hope that she s simply lost.\n\n If that is the case, then we d encourage her owner to contact our animal helpline (03000 999 999) to get their lucky \nblack cat back. \n\nThe charity said the incident highlighted the threat posed to animals by discarded cans and other litter.\n\nIT is the music awards ceremony which   unlike its more sedate transatlantic cousin the Grammys   has earned a \nreputation for drawing out the anarchic side of pop.\n\nLast night s 30th Brit Awards marked a coming of age for the star-studded ceremony with a spectacular round of \nlive sets and (relatively) well-behaved stars.\n\nLady Gaga swept the board, but ditched plans to turn up on stage in a wrecked car to perform her hits   including \nPoker Face   in favour of a low-key performance that included a tribute to her friend, the late fashion designer \nAlexander McQueen.\n\nThe only serious blip during the two-hour live show came from Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher who took to the \nstage determined to take a swipe at his brother and former bandmate Noel.\n\nAccepting Oasis s award for the Brits album of 30 years for their record (What s the Story) Morning Glory?, he \npointedly avoided thanking Noel, who forced the band s split last year when he walked out, blaming Liam s  violent \nand verbal intimidation .\n\nGallagher told the crowd:  Listen kids ... the best bands in the f****** world live forever , before hurling a microphone \ninto the audience. As he left the stage, host Peter Kay remarked:  What a k***head. \n\nCheryl Cole provided one of the high points of the evening as she braved the stage following allegations about her \nfootballer husband Ashley Cole to perform her hit Fight for this Love.  \n\nMeanwhile, after being introduced by Kay as  New York s answer to Sue Pollard , Lady Gaga took the stage \nwearing a huge white wig and veil to perform a low-key version of Telephone on the piano, which she dedicated to \nAlexander McQueen.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, one-time enfant terrible of British pop Lily Allen showed no sign of nerves as she opened the night by \ndescending on to the stage on a replica bomb to the sound of air raid sirens.  \n\nThe 24-year-old went on to take the award for British Female Solo Artist.\n\nAlthough Allen s performance went smoothly, the show suffered minor teething problems when the audio faltered \nas host Peter Kay arrived on stage. He was followed   perhaps ominously   by former glamour model Sam Fox, \nwhose notorious presenting skills with Mick Fleetwood in 1989 spelled the end of its live broadcasts.\n\nFox, who presented the award for most memorable performance of 30 years to the Spice Girls, said:  I better get it \nright tonight. I don t want you to hold it against me for the next 20 years,  before the show appeared to suffer a \nsecond technical hitch.\n\nThe event was a far cry from the first ever Brits in 1977, when Michael Aspel handed the Best British Male to Cliff \nRichard and Best British Group to The Beatles.\n\nBritish Female Solo Artist: Lily Allen\n\nBritish Male Solo Artist: Dizzee Rascal\n\nBritish Breakthrough Act: JLS\n\nBritish Group: Kasabian\n\nMastercard British Album: Florence And The Machine, right, Lungs\n\nBritish Single: JLS, Beat Again\n\nCritics  Choice: Ellie Goulding\n\nBrits Album of 30 Years: Oasis (What s The Story, Morning Glory)\n\nThe Brits Hits 30: Spice Girls, Wannabe/Who Do You Think You Are?\n\nInternational Female Solo Artist: Lady Gaga\n\nInternational Male Solo Artist: Jay-Z\n\nInternational Album: Lade Gaga, The Fame\n\nInternational Breakthrough Act: Lady Gaga\n\nOutstanding Contribution Award: Robbie Williams, left\n\nA CHARITY that raises funds for a children s hospital is expected to cut staff after a row that resulted in a director \nbeing suspended.\n\nThe Sick Kids Friends Foundation, which benefits the Edinburgh Royal Hospital for Sick Children (SKFF) has \nannounced that it is to enter a period of consultation on the future of its New Pyjamas campaign.\n\nAs a result, the charity s 10 New Pyjamas staff will be consulted on  the best way to move the campaign forward  \nand redundancies are expected.\n\nThe hospital suspended New Pyjamas director Elaine McGonigle two weeks ago amid claims only a fraction of its \ntarget sum to help the hospital move to a new site had been raised. \n\nThe foundation s chairman Graeme Miller also resigned at the same time.\n\n\n\nMs McGonigle was suspended from the campaign for the 2013 relocation, which boasted support from former first \nminister Jack McConnell and Labour peer Lord Foulkes.\n\nThe New Pyjamas campaign was launched in 2008 to raise \u00a315m to go towards a new \u00a3100m premises.\n\nSo far the \u00a360,000 raised is a long way short of the target, although supporters of Ms McGonigle insist she has \nsecured pledges of up to \u00a35 million.\n\nThe hospital now claims it will make the original target. One option under consideration is to Merge the New \nPyjamas campaign into the main body of the hospital.\n\nDavid Reith, current chairman of the trustees of the SKFF, said:  We want to thank the staff who worked on the \nNew Pyjamas campaign for their dedication, effort and hard work.\n\n However, it became clear to the trustees that the New Pyjamas campaign would not, under its current structure, \nmeet the targets initially set out. \n\nDUMBARTON   2\n\nSTIRLING ALBION   4\n\nStirling albion bounced back from a nine-goal defeat in their last outing at Ross County to move back into second \nplace after a cracking encounter at Strathclyde Homes Stadium. \n\nAllan Moore s men took the lead after a lightning raid in the first minute which ended with Scott Robertson side-\nfooting  David McKenna s cross into the net. The lead lasted for only two minutes when Mick Dunlop lobbed the ball \ninto the box and Ben Gordon rose to nod home.\n\nThe game continued in an open fashion and Albion took the lead on 11 minutes with a stunning strike from Chris \nAitken, who volleyed in from  22 yards after a McKenna cross had been headed clear.\n\nAitken rattled the bar shortly afterwards and he added a third on 34 minutes when the ball broke to him at the edge \nbox.\n\nDumbarton got back into it right on half-time when Roddy Hunter ignored claims of offside to blast home from close \nrange but Stirling restored their two-goal advantage four minutes into the second period when Robertson picked his \nspot  from the edge of the box.\n\nGRANT Smith, son of SFA chief executive Gordon, yesterday joined first division club Ross County. The 29-year-\nold midfielder had been playing in Singapore and Australia since leaving Dundee United in 2007.\n\n He s a very experienced player who is comfortable in a number of positions and adds something different to the \nsquad already in place, which is exactly what we need,  said manager Derek Adams.\n\nDunfermline are facing a striker crisis after top scorer Andy Kirk tore his hamstring. The 14-goal Northern Ireland \ninternationalist is facing at least two weeks out. Jim McIntyre is already without long-term injured pair Graham \nBayne and Steven McDougall, leaving only himself and David Graham as forwards. \n\nJim Leighton, the former Scotland goalkeeper, has joined ambitious Highland League side Huntly as goalkeeping \ncoach.\n\n When the opportunity arose, I didn t have to give it too much thought,  he said.  I m delighted to get involved. I will \ngive the position 100% commitment and try to impart some knowledge and help the club s three goalkeepers \nimprove. \n\nGregory Tade wrote  himself into the Raith Rovers history books with a stunning strike to dump Aberdeen out of the \nActive Nation Scottish Cup last night.\n\n\n\nThe French striker, a cult hero with the Stark s Park fans, bulleted his 58th-minute strike into the roof of the net to \ngive book his side a quarter-final tie at Dundee and send a sizeable visiting support home in joyous mood to Fife.\n\nThe defeat was greeted at the end with boos from the home support, incredulous that this was the team that put \nfour goals past Celtic just three days earlier. It is now the fifth time in three seasons that Aberdeen have exited the \ndomestic cup competitions to lower-league opposition.\n\nIn truth, it was no more than they deserved. Their performance bordered on pathetic and while they pummelled the \nRaith defence for long spells in the second half, they lacked the cohesion of the visitors who looked considerably \nmore comfortable on the ball.\n\nJohn McGlynn didn t have his troubles to seek in the  build-up to this tie. Three of the players who participated in \nthe first game at Stark s Park 10 days ago were unavailable to him for last night s game. Mark Campbell is \nrecovering from a car accident, Laurie Ellis was injured, and Dougie Hill, already nursing a back problem, \nexacerbated the injury during the warm-up. Midfielder Stephen Simmons moved back to compensate for Hill s \nabsence. He looked decidedly uneasy in the early stages, however, as the hosts exerted pressure and showed an \neagerness to prove that their failure to go through to the quarter-finals when these sides last met was a fluke.\n\nSteven MacLean, who hit two Aberdeen goals in last weekend s 4-4 draw against Cetic, came close to firing his \nside into an early lead with a ferocious volley which David McGurn, the Raith goalkeeper did well to stop.\n\nThe visitors refused to be flustered, preferring instead to adopt a patient approach. Their 1000-strong support \nseemed reasonably content in the driving rain and sub-zero temperatures to go along with such tactics. They did, \nthough, have to accept an early blow when Johnny Russell, hurt in a challenge with Darren Mackie, was forced off \nafter just 25 minutes, Darren Smith replacing him and causing concern in the Aberdeen defence with a thundering \nshot from the edge of the area and offering Jamie Langfield the chance to show his worth with a diving save on to \nhis left-hand post before it was. Moments later, Tade cursed his luck as he failed to connect with Smith s cross to \nthe back post.\n\nMackie headed wide shortly before the break and that was as good as it got for Aberdeen in the first half. And, \nwhile they upped the tempo at the start of the second, it was the Fifers who struck with a blistering goal in the 58th \nminute.\n\nThe Smiths, Kevin and Darren linked up down the right and when the latter skipped past a ponderous Jerel Ifil and \nfired a low ball across the six yard box, Tade was first to pounce bulleting his shot into the net.\n\nThere was the inevitable onslaught from Aberdeen, though their work lacked the control of Raith, and hinted at \ndesperation as they sought an equaliser. There was, though, a decided lack of discipline and shape to their play \nwith too much emphasis on high balls into the penalty area, not the hallmark of would-be Scottish Cup finalists.\n\nQUEEN OF THE SOUTH    3\n\nAYR UNITED   0\n\nQUEEN of the South rekindled their faltering title hopes with this easy win against 10-man Ayr.\n\nThe Somerset Park side had started brightly but their hopes nosedived when Craig Samson was red-carded in 16 \nminutes for a foul on Paul Burns who was about to pull the trigger. Mark Roberts was sacrificed to make way for \nsubstitute goalkeeper Stephen Grindlay, who had no chance as Stewart Kean doubled the punishment from the \nspot.\n\nThe Dumfries outfit went on to dominate possession and a patient build-up almost brought reward when Rocco \nQuinn and Bob Harris created an opening for David Weatherston whose shot was deflected wide. Weatherston, \nwho had earlier rattled the bar with a header, was then denied by Grindlay.\n\n\n\nThe depleted visitors struggled to get out of their own half and frustrations spilled over when Steven Bowey was \nbooked for scything down Burns.\n\nAt times Queens players were queuing up to take pot shots at Grindlay but a lack of composure in front of goal kept \nthe visitors in contention.\n\nUnited almost made their hosts pay for missed chances when a Tam McManus header was well saved by Scott \nFox. Instead Queens made the points safe when Stephen McKenna s header trickled over the line.\n\nAnd Weatherston added the goal of the game when he beat two defenders before drilling a left-foot shot low into \nthe net.\n\nannan ath v albion rovers\n\nThe hosts will welcome back Mike Jack and Scott Anson as they go in search of a first win in five matches and the \nthree points that would move them into sixth place above the Cliftonhill side.\n\nAlbion Rovers, meanwhile, have more concerns with defenders Phil McGrath and Mick O Byrne suspended, and \nSteven McKeown and Chris Boyle are sidelined by injuries. Todd Lumsden, the player/assistant manager, could  \nstart in a recast back four.\n\nLAST NIGHT\n\n* UEFA Champions League\n\nKnockout Round 1 first leg\n\nAC Milan 2 Manchester United 3\n\nRonaldinho 3   Scholes 36\n\nSeedorf 85   Rooney 66, 74\n\nAtt: 80,000\n\nAC Milan Dida, Bonera, Nesta, Thiago Silva,\n\nAntonini (Favalli 38), Beckham (Seedorf 72), Pirlo, Ambrosini, Pato, Huntelaar (Inzaghi 77), Ronaldinho.

he need look no further than his manager for inspiration as he bids to emulate John Hughes  rise \nfrom Hibernian supporter to player and then manager.\n\nMurray has agreed a new two-year deal to stay with his boyhood heroes and, at 28, should still have many years \nleft in his career when that draws to an end in 2012.\n\nHowever the former Rangers player already has his sights set on a move from pitch to dugout when he does hang \nup his boots.\n\nHe has begun coaching one night a week at East of Scotland side Coldstream and has been backed by Hughes to \nenjoy future success in management \n\n I eventually want to go into management but, hopefully, I ve got as many years as possible still in football,  he \nsaid.  I would hate to cut short my playing career to go into management because I still believe playing is the best \nthing and management is second best.\n\n So I want to play for as long as I can, keep myself fit and train as well as I can and if I can keep myself in and \naround a first-team at SPL level then  I would be delighted.\n\n At the same time, I m helping out down at Coldstream in the East of Scotland League once a week and, hopefully, \nthat is with a view to maybe helping out here at the start of next season with one of the younger sides.\n\n There s no doubt Hibs would be the club you would want to manage if you were a Hibs fan, the same goes for any \nfan of any club. \n\nHughes was delighted to secure his vice-captain on a new contract and urged the remaining first-team players \nwanting deals to prove they deserve to join him.\n\nHughes is still to make up his mind on whether to offer striker Abdessalam Benjelloun, midfielder Patrick Cregg and \nkeeper Yves Ma-Kalambay new terms.\n\n It s absolutely fantastic that we ve got Ian Murray tied up because he s Hibs through and through and he s got the \nqualities to take us where we want to go,  Hughes said.\n\n He s had a wonderful season up until now and, in the next two years, if he keeps giving me what he s given me \nthis year then great.\n\n We ve also got Benji, Maka and Cregg out of contract in the summer but at this moment in time we re not looking \nat that. You re saying to them,  Go and show me what you ve got .\n\n I felt Benji on Sunday revelled in playing at Ibrox and he s maybe found himself a little bit unfortunate, along with \nPatrick Cregg, to find himself out of the team. But the two of them are everything you want at the club and there \nwon t be too many leaving this club, not after what they ve given me. \n\nSt Johnstone midfielder Liam Craig will always hold Hughes in high regard after he brought him back to Scotland \nto kickstart his career, but that certainly won t be on his mind tonight.\n\n\n\nEdinburgh-born Craig began his career at Ipswich Town and captained the youth side to victory in the 2005 FA \nYouth Cup final over Southampton. But after he found it difficult to break into the first team, Hughes brought him to \nFalkirk in January 2006.\n\n John Hughes was great with me,  he said.  I still speak to him when I see him. I still have a good relationship with \nhim and Chipper [Hughes  No.2 Brian Rice]. I never say a bad word against the two of them because it was those \ntwo who brought me back up to Scottish football and gave me my chance to play.  \n\nHibernian can move to within two points of second-placed Celtic if they win, but the hosts are seeking to increase \ntheir seven-point lead over Falkirk at the other end of the table.\n\nCraig added:  We want to build on our league position [ninth]. We ve got a great team spirit and we want to finish as \nhigh up the table as possible.But I think this season if we were to finish 11th it would be a success   your first year \nin the SPL is always the hardest, especially when we ve been out of it for so long.\n\n Hibs have shown this  season what kind of team they are. Having worked with John, they ll be definitely up for the \ngame tonight. It will be a hard match for us. \n\nTHE Scottish Government yesterday defended its stewardship of higher education in the wake of a report which \nwarns of growing financial pressures on the sector.\n\nA spokesman for Michael  Russell, the Education Secretary, said increases in public funding, higher student \nnumbers and greater student support were all benchmarks of the Government s support for the university sector.\n\nThe comments came after The Herald revealed a raft of financial concerns identified following the economic \ndownturn.\n\nThe Scottish Funding Council document highlights fears over reductions in public funding, a decline in income from \ncharities and business corporations and lower returns on investments.\n\nIn addition, it details increasing pressure on support funds, an increase in pension scheme liabilities and a collapse \nin the value of property as key factors.\n\nThe report states:  The economic conditions are already starting to impact on the university sector and ... the \nfinancial prospects are less certain. The challenge for institutions is to maintain financial and institutional \nsustainability. \n\nYesterday, the spokesman for Mr Russell said:  This Government believes access to education should be based on \nthe ability to learn, not the ability to pay, and that universities are a crucial engine of economic growth.\n\n That s why, despite Labour s cut of \u00a3800 million in the Scottish budget next year, we are delivering an extra \u00a335m \nfor universities   a real terms increase of 2.1%, on top of the real terms increase we delivered in 2009-10.\n\n What s more, we have expanded the number of university places, with an additional 7,500 this year alone, and \nabolished the back-door fees students in Scotland had to pay under Labour. \n\nHowever, opposition politicians said the warnings from institutions made it  absolutely clear  the SNP s current \napproach was unsustainable.\n\nClaire Baker, higher education spokeswoman for the Scottish Labour Party, said:  Under this SNP Government we \nare seeing a crisis develop in higher education with universities likely to be forced to turn away talented students, \nstruggle for funding and have to make redundancies.\n\n We urgently need a full independent review of the sector to find a way out of this crisis. \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Murdo Fraser, Scottish Conservative Party higher education spokesman, called for an independent \nreview:  There are real and serious challenges ahead for higher education in Scotland and, perhaps, some people \nare only now realising the extent of the problems we face. \n\nAlistair Watson (ex-chair)\n\nGlasgow City Council\n\nCouncil salary: \u00a315,797\n\nSPT salary: \u00a320,295\n\nMileage: 21,818\n\nExpenses: \u00a310,756\n\nDavie McLachlan (vice-chair)\n\nSouth Lanarkshire Council\n\nCouncil salary: \u00a315,838\n\nSPT salary: \u00a311,163\n\nMileage: 35,650\n\nExpenses: \u00a317,544\n\nDavid Fagan (vice-chair)\n\nNorth Lanarkshire Council\n\nCouncil salary: \u00a316,036\n\nSPT salary: \u00a311,163\n\nMileage: 2749\n\nExpenses: \u00a31355\n\nTHE latest controversy over mileage claims by top officials at Strathclyde Partnership for Transport comes just two \ndays after its chairman Alistair Watson resigned.\n\nBut it s not the first time  officials in Scotland s largest transport quango have hit the headlines for reasons not \nconnected with running the transport system.\n\nIn October 2008, they were criticised after an investigation by our sister paper, The Sunday Herald, revealed they \nhad been accepting thousands of pounds worth of junkets from bus companies, train operators and consultants.\n\nIn the preceding three years Mr Watson, who quit on health grounds on Monday, accepted around 55 items of \nhospitality including football matches.\n\nChief executive Ron Culley, who has been off work for six weeks with a heart condition, accepted 40 items of \nhospitality over the same period including  a France v Scotland match in Paris and a Neil Diamond concert.\n\nBetween 2006, when the body was set up to replace the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive, and last year, \nofficials raked in more than \u00a3520,000 in expenses.\n\n\n\nOf that \u00a3117,573 was spent on foreign trips by a handful of top officials including Mr Watson and Mr Culley. This \nincluded \u00a349,195 to destinations including China, India, Italy and the United States.\n\nMr Culley, who is paid \u00a3129,000 a year, flew to New York at a cost of \u00a32,450 where he stayed in the Algonquin \nHotel, a favourite with film stars.\n\nThe role of the publicly-funded organisation, which runs Glasgow s Subway, is according to its website, to deliver  \ntransport solutions for all modes of transport across the region  and is  at the centre of the region s transport \nplanning, analysing all travel needs and developing the transport system for now and the future .\n\nHowever, although it helps subsidise buses, deregulation of the buses and the creation of Transport Scotland and \nregional transport partnerships means it has much less responsibility than its predecessor.\n\nAnd while its officials have been globetrotting at the taxpayers  expense, it asked the 700 staff it had in January last \nyear to apply for redundancy and it is also cutting some services. Last month it announced it would stop running the \nRenfrew Ferry to save \u00a3400,000 a year.\n\nIn September, figures showed the number of people using the Subway fell by 14% in the previous two months.\n\nSPT says 96% of trains run on time but it is regularly criticised for trains running late or breaking down.\n\nLast spring Mr Culley said a \u00a320 million improvement plan for the network was a case of  fur coat and no knickers . \nThe plan was to give five stations a makeover in time for the 2014 Commonwealth Games.\n\nThe Subway needs \u00a3100m for new carriages and signalling but does not have the money.\n\nHowever, it is due to put forward modernisation plans which could cost up to \u00a3400m.\n\nAlthough a prime mover in the attempt to build the Glasgow Airport Rail Link (Garl), which it had taken from  \nconcept to design stage, it lost responsibility for it and the project was taken over by Transport Scotland.\n\nDuring the row over the cost of Garl, Transport Scotland claimed that SPT had not factored in major aspects of \nwork to relocate infrastructure at the airport. It was also criticised for delays and cost over-runs on the Partick \nInterchange rail and underground project in Glasgow.\n\nIt may now be facing its greatest test as there are said to be growing tensions between the body and Glasgow City \nCouncil over the pace of progress in preparing transport links for the Commonwealth Games.\n\nNICOLA Sturgeon indicated to patients at a Glasgow clinic yesterday that she will not be resigning over  fraudgate .\n\nAs she ploughed on with official commitments after her toughest week in office, the Deputy First Minister and \nHealth Secretary visited the Revive MS Support centre in the north of the city.\n\nDuring a meeting with centre clients, multiple sclerosis sufferer John Munro, of Kirkintilloch said to Ms Sturgeon:   I \nhope you have not written a letter, a resignation letter.  Ms Sturgeon replied:  No, don t you worry. \n\nIt may have been an off-the-cuff remark during an informal tour of the centre, which will benefit from \u00a336,000 in \nGovernment funding this year, but it is the first time that Ms Sturgeon has publicly referred to last week s \ncontroversy. \n\nThen, it emerged that she had urged a sheriff not to give a custodial sentence to a constituent, Abdul Rauf, who had \nbeen convicted of conning the benefits system of \u00a380,000.\n\nRauf was jailed in the 1990s for stealing \u00a358,624 in pension and benefits payments while he was a sub-postmaster \nin Edinburgh.\n\n\n\nLabour is calling for Ms Sturgeon to resign over what leader Iain Grey has described as an  appalling  error of \njudgment, although First Minister Alex Salmond has backed his deputy  110% .\n\nYesterday, she declined to answer questions on last week s drama, saying only that she was due to make a \nstatement to parliament next week. Although she appeared pale and slightly subdued during the visit, she happily \nchatted with patients who gave her a warm welcome.\n\nInstead, the Health Secretary pressed on to meet those at the centre. Tom Friel, 54, an MS sufferer, said:  I think it \ns disgusting the way this has all been blown out of proportion. The man admitted his guilt and she was drawing \nattention to his health condition. That s what her job is. Is she not supposed to help a constituent because she is \nthe Health Secretary? \n\nMPs could face paying back thousands of pounds in profits on taxpayer-funded second homes, but this will not \napply at Holyrood where action was taken sooner to end the perk.\n\nSir Ian Kennedy, chairman of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, said gains from rises in second \nhome values  should not be retained  by MPs from outside central London who are permitted to claim back the \ninterest on second home mortgages.\n\nThey have been able to pocket any profit when they sell their homes, although they have to pay capital gains tax if \nthe property is classed as a second home, something which led to so-called  flipping .\n\nLast November s report by Sir Christopher Kelly recommended an end to the perk and the claw-back of any \nsubsequent profits. Now Sir Ian has indicated that he agrees.\n\n Gains made in that way should not be retained. The mechanism for doing it is the only question we have to decide,  \nhe said, although he indicated it would be a matter for tax authorities to decide whether this should be \nretrospective.\n\nHolyrood acted much sooner to end the practice of paying mortgages on second homes and the rules were always \nmuch tighter in Scotland. The perk on new mortgages ended in October 2008 and all benefit will be phased out by \nMarch next year, but it was decided that  due to legal and practical issues  no clawback would be sought.\n\nOver the past five weeks, IPSA has held public meetings and received 2,703 responses.\n\nSir Richard Branson has boosted the Tories by calling for public spending cuts to start this year.\n\nHe said the UK s huge borrowing was a  serious risk  to the economy and action could not be put off.\n\nThe comments will be welcomed by the Conservatives on what is a key General Election battleground.\n\nAt the weekend 20 leading economists called for spending cuts to start in 2010-11, and for the deficit to be tackled \nfaster.\n\nDavid Cameron has demanded immediate reductions, but the Government insists acting too early would harm the \nrecover.\n\nSir Richard said:  I believe the UK s record budget deficit does pose a serious risk to our recovery.\n\n It would be damaging if we lost the confidence of the markets through delayed action and saw interest rates have \nto go up steeply. \n\nGERRY Adams s wife has undergone surgery for cancer, it was revealed last  night.\n\nThe Sinn Fein leader said he and Colette received news of the disease a month ago.\n\n That was a huge shock,  he told a party selection convention in west Belfast.\n\n\n\nHe said last Thursday s operation went well and she was in good spirits.\n\n I want to take this opportunity to thank the medical and health staff and our own doctor for their good work,  he \nadded.\n\nThere were no other candidates standing and he was unanimously selected to represent the party at this year s \nWestminster elections. He led a campaign for his brother Liam to hand himself in to face sex abuse allegations and \nhis family has also been rocked by revelations that his own father, Gerry Snr, was an abuser.\n\nTHE latest controversy over mileage claims by top officials at Strathclyde Partnership for Transport comes just two \ndays after its chairman Alistair Watson resigned.\n\nBut it s not the first time  officials in Scotland s largest transport quango have hit the headlines for reasons not \nconnected with running the transport system.\n\nIn October 2008, they were criticised after an investigation by our sister paper, The Sunday Herald, revealed they \nhad been accepting thousands of pounds worth of junkets from bus companies, train operators and consultants.\n\nIn the preceding three years Mr Watson, who quit on health grounds on Monday, accepted around 55 items of \nhospitality including football matches.\n\nChief executive Ron Culley, who has been off work for six weeks with a heart condition, accepted 40 items of \nhospitality over the same period including  a France v Scotland match in Paris and a Neil Diamond concert.\n\nBetween 2006, when the body was set up to replace the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive, and last year, \nofficials raked in more than \u00a3520,000 in expenses.\n\nOf that \u00a3117,573 was spent on foreign trips by a handful of top officials including Mr Watson and Mr Culley.

Ms Sturgeon replied:  No, don t you worry. \n\nIt may have been an off-the-cuff remark during an informal tour of the centre, which will benefit from \u00a336,000 in \nGovernment funding this year, but it is the first time that Ms Sturgeon has publicly referred to last week s \ncontroversy. \n\nThen, it emerged that she had urged a sheriff not to give a custodial sentence to a constituent, Abdul Rauf, who had \nbeen convicted of conning the benefits system of \u00a380,000.\n\nRauf was jailed in the 1990s for stealing \u00a358,624 in pension and benefits payments while he was a sub-postmaster \nin Edinburgh.\n\nLabour is calling for Ms Sturgeon to resign over what leader Iain Grey has described as an  appalling  error of \njudgment, although First Minister Alex Salmond has backed his deputy  110% .\n\nYesterday, she declined to answer questions on last week s drama, saying only that she was due to make a \nstatement to parliament next week. Although she appeared pale and slightly subdued during the visit, she happily \nchatted with patients who gave her a warm welcome.\n\nInstead, the Health Secretary pressed on to meet those at the centre. Tom Friel, 54, an MS sufferer, said:  I think it \ns disgusting the way this has all been blown out of proportion. The man admitted his guilt and she was drawing \nattention to his health condition. That s what her job is. Is she not supposed to help a constituent because she is \nthe Health Secretary? \n\nTRIBUTES have been paid to an  inspirational  university principal who died suddenly yesterday.\n\nProfessor Mike Pittilo MBE, principal of Aberdeen s Robert Gordon University, passed away in the early hours of \nTuesday morning.\n\nMr Pittilo, 55, had been ill but had continued to work up until last week.\n\nHis sudden passing was said to be a shock to colleagues and students on the Aberdeen campus.\n\nProf John Harper, acting principal, said his late colleague brought direction to the institution and had nurtured a \nwarm rapport with staff and students alike.\n\nHe added:  We ve lost an inspirational leader who will be sadly missed.\n\n Our thoughts are very much with his wife, Carol, at this time. \n\nMr Pittilo joined the university in 2005 following a career in life sciences and was awarded an MBE last year for his \nservices to health.\n\n\n\nTHE raven   a bird branded an omen of death   has been cleared of being responsible for declining numbers of \nwading birds in the uplands.\n\nA study by the RSPB and the Aberdeen University s Centre for Environmental Sustainability (Aces) found the \nraven, forever linked with the Tower of London, was not to blame for a fall in the numbers of many species of \nthreatened wading birds, including lapwing, dunlin, golden plover, snipe and curlew, which have declined by up to \n50% in the past 25 years. \n\nThe raven was blamed because at the same time its population has recovered in many parts of the UK.\n\nThese patterns, together with the fact that ravens will eat the eggs and chicks of upland waders, led some to \nsuggest ravens are the cause of wader declines.\n\nThe dwindling numbers of breeding waders and wild game birds means that, in 2007 and 2008, 15 sporting estates \napplied to Scottish Natural Heritage for licences to kill ravens to protect wild game birds.\n\nHowever, Professor Steve Redpath, director of Aces, said:  This research found no strong evidence to suggest that \nravens were responsible for changes in wader numbers. \n\nA businessman who set up a secret tryst with a female wedding guest faces being placed on the sex offenders \nregister after making a pass at a stranger in a bizarre case of mistaken identity.\n\nCompany owner John Harkess bombarded a woman with sexually suggestive chat as she paid for her shopping in \nTesco.\n\nHe thought she was the guest he had arranged to meet in the supermarket.\n\nBut he was so drunk he did not realise the woman he was chatting to was a total stranger.\n\nHarkess, 42, who runs a tiling company already has long-term partner.\n\nPerth Sheriff Court was told that Harkess had sidled up to Catherine Young and said:  I m going to give you one. \n\nBut he was unaware she  was a stranger and the woman he was meant to meet was elsewhere in the supermarket.\n\nSolicitor John McLaughlin, defending, said:  He is extremely embarrassed by the incident.

He has also caused some difficulty \nwith his partner because that aspect of this meeting has not gone down well at home.

And the 22-year-old \ncould soon be assuming a similar role for Glasgow, after confirming he will begin training with Sean Lineen s side at \nthe conclusion of the RBS 6 Nations, when the Warriors began planning for life without Cardiff-bound Parks.\n\nIndeed, with the 48-times capped Australian edging ever closer to the exit, it should provide solace to Scots that the \nwheels are already in motion for Climo to advance to the professional ranks and the Magners League next season. \n\nBoth Lineen and Andy Robinson have been in regular contact with Kenny Murray, the Ayr coach, about the \nemerging No.10. Although he might not be eligible to represent Scotland until 2012, he is exactly the sort of player   \nblessed with an all-round attacking game and sound grasp of tactics as well as being a robust tackler and \nredoubtable kicker   whose abilities will surely benefit Glasgow in the future.\n\n I have been in Scotland for more than 18 months now and I regard  it as my second home,  said Climo,  a product \nof the New Plymouth  Old Boys club in his native land,   But I know I have to prove myself to the Glasgow coaches \nbefore I can even think about anything higher.\n\n It s flattering to be linked with Scotland but I owe it to Ayr to repay the faith they have shown in me by trying to \nhelp them retain their Premiership title for the rest of the season and that is my first priority. \n\n The people at Millbrae have been fantastic, and we have a tremendous community spirit, and a lot of the credit for \nthat is down to Kenny.  He is a top bloke, with loads of ideas, he constantly thinks outside the circle and he is 100% \nhonest, so you always know where you stand with him. Ever since I touched down,  he has backed me to the hilt \nand  that has been very important. \n\n\n\nThat symbiosis has proved instrumental to Ayr s recent heroics, both in domestic competition and amid the \ninaugural British & Irish Cup, where Murray s charges have gained commendable victories over Rotherham and \nBirmingham   the latter a comprehensive 49-14 triumph last weekend, with Climo dominating proceedings by \nclaiming 24 points.\n\n In the first half, we probably played as well as we have done during my time at the club and we put more than 30 \nunanswered points on the board, so this new tournament has been a really good innovation,  said Climo.  It has got \nfolk at the club looking forward to more big games against non-Scottish opponents and we have Pontypridd up here \nnext, and I gather that there are hundreds of Welsh fans planning to travel up,  so it should be a great experience. \n\nAn engaging character with a vibrant personality, it can only be hoped that Climo s candour isn t viewed as a \nnegative the closer that he gets to the professional set-up. On the contrary, whether discussing his ambitions or \nfocusing on the significant progress he has made since 2008, what burns through is  his unbridled passion for \nrugby.\n\n I just want to be playing, whether it s at stand-off, full-back, the wing . . . whatever, so even being associated with a \nside such as Glasgow is a fantastic opportunity,  said Climo.  I ve done a lot of training in the gym during the winter, \nand we have a heavy backlog of fixtures in the next few months   as many as 13 or 14 games between now and the \nstart of May   but things are going really well and the more challenges there are, the better. I didn t know what to \nexpect when I first arrived, but I love being here and I want to keep aiming to raise my standards. \n\nHe is named after the boxer, not the comedy psychiatrist. Yet, whatever offers may be placed on the table by the \nScottish Rugby Union, Climo s response is:  I m listening. \n\n* Melrose players Ben Allen and Nicola Halfpenny model a one-off Army-style camouflage jersey which the club will \nadopt during the sevens season in support of British Forces serving overseas.

It is a question Barclay cannot yet answer, for any \npride he might take from Scotland s performance over the first 70 minutes is heavily qualified by the gruesome \nreality of what happened thereafter. In his struggle to reconcile the game s two overarching themes, sleep has not \ncome easily for the 23-year-old flanker.\n\n I ve been trying not to think about it, but I haven t slept well since the game,  Barclay explains.  I just can t stop \nthinking about it. I can t figure out what happened. In the end, I think it was a combination of injuries and the fact we \nhad just 12 guys on the pitch at the finish. We just couldn t get our hands on the ball. We had a lot of guys playing \nout of position. But we were our own worst enemies to some extent. \n\nIn acknowledging that Scotland might have played smarter rugby in the last few minutes, Barclay refuses to dwell \non the decision to put the restart that followed Wales  equalising penalty into play, rather than Row Z of the stand.  \nThere s no guarantee that we would have got the ball out because we didn t really have a kicker on at that point,  \nhe shrugs.\n\nhttp://www.melroserugbyshop.co.uk/\n\n\nLike the rest of Scotland s home-based players, Barclay has been giv en this week off. In the heart of the hectic \nschedule of the Six Nations these days are vital for resting bodies bruised and battered by two fierce Tests, but the \nmental wind-down is just as important.\n\n It s probably a good thing that we have this time,  says Barclay.  I think the mood might have been quite low at \ntraining if we had had to go in. This has given the guys a chance to go away for a few days and get their minds right \noff rugby because what happened at the weekend was such a massive, massive disappointment. \n\nAnd yet, it was still an effort that had critics purring over Scotland s overall performance, the individual display of \nDan Parks at fly-half and the collective contribution of Barclay, Beattie and Brown. Those aspects of the game \nmight not have surprised Glasgow supporters who have watched them at work at Firhill this season, but Barclay \nadmits to satisfaction that they could take their recent form into the Test arena.\n\n I haven t actually  watched a video of the  game yet,  Barclay admits.  I felt I was involved pretty heavily throughout, \nbut it was one of those games where everyone in the team played pretty well.\n\n I thought Kelly had a particularly great game, as good as I ve ever seen him play. Johnnie has being playing well \nsince autumn, he s just in this really rich vein of form right now. It s great fun playing alongside guys who are \nplaying so well, especially when they re my clubmates. \n\nAnd just a little poignant, too. Scotland might have found a back row of uncommon quality, but Glasgow are on the \npoint of losing one. Already, it has been confirmed that Brown will be leaving to join Saracens at the end of this \nseason, while rumours continue to swirl that Beattie will also be taking his leave  of the city before too long. \n\n We re all quite different players and we do quite different things on the pitch,  say Barclay of the loose forward \nblend.  When you know what each person is going to be doing it allows you to get on with your job  a bit better. \n\n It is a wee bit sad that  it s breaking up, but it was never going to go on forever. It was always going to happen at \nsome point. It s sad that Kelly is going, but then there are other guys at Glasgow who have been champing at the \nbit to get their chances and maybe they ll come through now. \n\nLeonardo Ghiraldini last night warned Scotland their Six Nations fortunes are about to slide from bad to worse.\n\nThe Italy captain thinks he could not have picked a better time to lead his men into battle against Andy Robinson s \nside who, he believes, will be on a physical and psychological low in the wake of their heartbreaking defeat by \nWales in Cardiff and the resulting horrendous injury list.\n\nHe is also convinced the Italians earned a major confidence boost by going so close to beating England last \nSunday.\n\nThe tough Treviso hooker said:  We have great belief in our potential and strength, which was underlined at the \nweekend. Against Ireland in Dublin we were disappointed with our performance, but against England we \nworked hard.\n\n And now we can go into the match against Scotland with genuine hope that we can get the result we want and \nsteer ourselves clear of the Wooden Spoon.\n\n Scotland were involved in an amazing game against Wales, but after what happened in the last few minutes it will \nbe very difficult for them to be in the right frame of mind to face us.\n\n They will also be without Thom Evans, Chris Paterson and Rory Lamont, three of their most dangerous players. \n\nGhiraldini was backed up by the Italy coach, Nick Mallett, who said:  The team has never changed their positive \napproach, despite the long-term injury to first-choice captain Sergio Parisse.\n\n\n\n Leonardo has done a good job in his absence and we have a very special group of guys. I was very proud of the \nway they performed against England and although there is still a lot of work to do, we can go into the game against \nScotland with real confidence. \n\nAlun-Wyn Jones is to undergo surgery on an elbow injury today and has been ruled out of Wales  Six Nations \ncampaign. The lock  suffered a chipped bone and ligament damage during Wales  victory over Scotland on \nSaturday and will be out for six to  12 weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, Andy Powell has vowed to fight to get back into the Wales team after he was dropped from their squad \nyesterday. The 28-year-old was suspended after he was arrested and charged for driving a golf buggy  while unfit \nthrough drink  after the weekend win over Scotland.\n\nThom Evans will undergo a second operation on his neck. The 24-year-old wing suffered a serious injury after \ncolliding with the Wales full-back, Lee Byrne, during Scotland s 31-24 defeat at the Millennium Stadium on \nSaturday.\n\nHe had surgery that evening but surgeons have decided a second procedure will be required later this week before \nhe is released from University Hospital, Cardiff.\n\nThe Scotland team doctor, James Robson, has played down fears Evans  career might be under threat.  Thom has \nbeen heartened by the many messages of support he has received from around the world. The surgeons are \ndelighted with his progress. Thom and his mum met with the surgeons last night and has opted to undergo a further \nprocedure later this week, which will enhance the surgery that has already taken place and provide further \nstabilisation to his neck.\n\n This procedure is optional and Thom could have decided to have it done at a later point, or not at all. He s decided \nto go ahead now and that should help with the whole recovery process. The same surgeons who performed the \ninitial operation will undertake this procedure. \n\nKenny Baillie, Glasgow s chief executive, said:  We are all delighted that Thom is improving and in good spirits. \nMany messages of support for Thom have been sent to the Warriors over the last 48 hours and I would like to thank \neveryone who has taken time to call and write in. \n\nEvans was one of three players to suffer tournament-ending injuries on Saturday, with full-back Chris Paterson and \nfellow wing Rory Lamont also requiring hospital treatment.\n\nPaterson picked up a kidney problem that was expected to sideline him for eight to 10 weeks. Dr Robson, who will \nreturn to Cardiff today, said:  Chris is continuing to make a good recovery. He is hopeful of being released from \nhospital either later today or tomorrow. Then he would remain in Cardiff for a few days  rest before travelling home. \n\nLamont has been seen by an orthopaedic surgeon to assess his knee ligament injury and has undergone a scan at \nan Edinburgh hospital. He will be re-assessed in light of the results later this week.\n\nJerry Flannery s participation in the remainder of the RBS 6 Nations championship will be decided at a disciplinary \nhearing in Dublin this morning.\n\nFlannery has been charged with an alleged kick on the France winger, Alexis Palisson, 23 minutes into Ireland s \ndefeat in Paris on Saturday.\n\nIf the citing is upheld, the Munster hooker faces a minimum four-week suspension which would rule him out of \nIreland s games against England and Wales.\n\nA NEW online TV streaming service which brings shows from the BBC, Channel 4 and Five together on a single \nsite has been launched.\n\n\n\nSeeSaw went live with more than 3,000 hours of content   including The Apprentice, Shameless and Neighbours   \nand with presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Trisha Goddard and Gordon Ramsay appearing side by side under one \nbrand.\n\nUnlike services such as BBC s iPlayer or Channel 4 s 4oD, which broadcast their own content, SeeSaw has \npartnerships with BBC Worldwide, Channel 4, Five and independent production companies.\n\nSeeSaw s controller  John Keeling  said:  It s like having an enormous buffet ... you can either just snack on it and \ncatch up on what you ve missed or gorge yourself with an entire season   it s absolutely at your fingertips and your \ncontrol. \n\nSeeSaw was born after a similar venture by the BBC, ITV and Channel 4, under the working title Project Kangaroo, \nwas blocked by the Competition Commission. SeeSaw s parent company  Arqiva, paid \u00a38m last July for \nKangaroo's assets.\n\nMr Keeling, with more than 20 years in the industry working for Sky, MTV and UKTV, reckons this year will see the \nbreakthrough of TV on demand.\n\nHe said:  This is the tip of the iceberg. It feels to me like it did 20 years ago when I was at Sky and multi-channel TV \nwas just beginning and you saw satellite dishes sprouting on people s homes like mushrooms.\n\n This way of watching television will be on TVs from this year. One of the fastest-selling electronic goods is an \nHDMI cable which connects a laptop to the back of the TV and, bingo, you re online and your TV has become an \nenormous monitor for your laptop. \n\nThe service is currently free, funded by adverts.However, SeeSaw plans to introduce a pay model for high-profile \nUS dramas.\n\nA FATHER campaigning for a better deal for disabled children has failed in a bid to challenge the law.\n\nA judge at the Court of Session in Edinburgh rejected Stephen Meek s claim that denying mobility payments to \nanyone under three years old is a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nLord Brodie ruled it was for the Westminster Parliament to decide age limits and picking the third birthday as a cut-\noff point was not irrational.\n\nAn earlier hearing heard how Mr Meek and his wife, Wendy, gave up work and exhausted savings  to look after \ntheir son, Justin.\n\nThe Lanark couple claimed that if the law restricting the \u00a345-a-week mobility payments was fairer, as many as 7000 \nchildren in the UK would benefit.\n\nWITH his long grey, hair, busker Matthew Dyet was well known for playing the guitar and mouth-organ. However, \none year ago today he vanished and has not been seen since.\n\nNow police have released video footage in the hope it will help jog memories of people who may have seen Mr \nDyet since he went missing from his  home town of Eyemouth in Berwickshire.\n\nThe 58-year-old was last  seen at 5pm on Tuesday, February 17, 2009, when he and his cross-collie dog, Jack, \nwere caught on CCTV leaving Costcutters on the High Street of the coastal town.\n\nJack was found in Mr Dyet s back garden on the day his owner went missing. \n\nSince then there has been no trace of Mr Dyet, and he has not made contact with any relatives or friends.\n\nMr Dyet was originally from Edinburgh and started living in the Berwickshire area around 2003. \n\n\n\nInspector Janice Etherson of Lothian and Borders Police said yesterday the renewed appeal formed part of a wider \nongoing investigation into his disappearance.\n\nAlthough there has been no suggestion of foul play, the case involving Mr Dyet is being taken seriously.\n\nAn extensive sweep of the rugged coastline was carried out at the time.\n\nPolice were joined in searches by units from the coastguard, including two lifeboats, as well as an RAF rescue \nhelicopter from Boulmer in Northumberland, and the Border Search and Rescue Unit, the south-east of Scotland s \narea mountain team.\n\nInitial searches concentrated on the shore, cliffs and shore paths, and later moved inland.\n\nInspector Etherson said:  This is by no means a closed case, and it is disappointing to have no new leads, one year \nsince Matthew Dyet disappeared. His disappearance is very much out of character, but there have been no \nconfirmed sightings since last February, despite extensive investigation and media coverage.\n\n This case will not close until we can provide some answers for Matthew Dyet s family and friends.\n\n He was well known locally as a busker, so we are trying to jog people s memories today to find out if anyone has \nany more information that could be helpful to us.\n\n We won t give up hope of finding out exactly what happened a year ago, and will continue to do all we can until  we \ndo.\n\n We would appreciate any information at all, no matter how insignificant they might think it is. It could be that piece \nthat we are looking for. \n\nMr Dyet is described as being around 5ft 9in, with long, grey hair, and was wearing a blue jacket and a grey or \nbeige jumper with faded jeans when he was last seen.\n\nHe was well known in the Killies area near his home, and regularly walked his dog at Killies Green which is close to \nthe coastal cliffs.\n\nPolice said he was regularly seen busking, playing mouth-organ and guitar, in Berwick, Galashiels and other \ntowns.\n\nMr Dyet s dog has since been found a new home.\n\nDuring the investigation police have conducted door-to-door inquiries, and followed up initial contacts from \nmembers of the public, as well as conducting leaflet drops around the Scottish Borders and with other police forces \naround Scotland and England.\n\nA NEW price comparison website has been launched to raise money for Oxfam.\n\nThe Compare for Good website enables users to search for the most competitive deals on a range of products, \nsuch as insurance, loans and utilities.\n\nBut at least two-thirds of the commission the site raises when people take out a product through it will go to fund \nOxfam s work, with the rest of the money covering the site s running costs.\n\nOxfam believes it is the first time a not-for-profit organisation has entered the billion-pound price-comparison site \nmarket in this way.\n\nEarlier this year, the group said it had seen a 15% drop in the level of goods donated to its 700 charity shops \nacross the UK, blaming the economic downturn for the slump in donations.\n\n\n\nActress Joan Collins, who launched the website, said Compare for Good offered people a win-win opportunity, as \nthey could save themselves cash, while also raising money for charity.\n\nAn Asian tycoon who promised to donate more than \u00a38 million to help fund a new state-of-the-art medical school at \nSt Andrews University has failed to come up with a single penny towards the pioneering development.\n\n The pledge by Malaysian Vinod Sekhar, one of the Far East s most successful entrepreneurs, was anno-unced in \na blaze of publicity, but more than two years on, Scotland s oldest university has received nothing.\n\n The multi-millionaire    he counts actors Mel Gibson and Bruce Willis as good friends   vowed to fund the new \nSchool of Medicine and Sciences to the tune of \u00a38.25 million as a memorial to his late father, Dr B C Sekhar, who \nwas an iconic figure in Malaysia's history, and the pioneer of the country s rubber and palm oil industries.\n\n Yesterday, the university said it was still getting assurances from Mr Sekhar that he would honour the promise of \nthe largest single donation ever made to a Scottish university.\n\n A spokesman said,  We continue to receive assurances from Vinod Sekhar that he will honour the long-standing \npromises he has made to the university.\n\n  We are now moving to commission and fit out the building ahead of its scheduled opening in September of this \nyear. \n\n The new \u00a345 million school will lead collaborative research in areas  such as cancer, health psychology and \ninfectious diseases.\n\nBLOOD, sin and the power of sound will be major themes at this year s Edinburgh International Science Festival.\n\nThe festival, from April 3-17, will include a Blood Bar for children at the City Arts Centre where they will be able to \nindulge their fascination with the red stuff by enjoying gruesome activities such as making  blood-curdling scabs .\n\nThere will also be a state-of-the-art sound lab on St Andrews Square, Sonic Dreams, where visitors will be able to \nrelax surrounded by 3D sound.\n\nVisitors are also invited to an evening of audience participation focusing on the seven deadly sins, during which \nthey can find out for which of those they have most natural talent.\n\nDAMIEN HENDERSON\n\nTransport Correspondent\n\ndamien.henderson@theherald.co.uk\n\nCOUNCILS  efforts to keep roads ice-free during the recent cold snap have met with a frosty response from \nmotorists and pedestrians who believe

The AA warned of our concerns over salt supplies in the autumn and we would like to see more resilient \nwinter weather plans for the future.

Its president, Pat Watters, said:  It has to be remembered that what we were dealing with was an \nextraordinary spell of weather   the longest and coldest sustained period for 30 years. \n\n Scotland s councils did a fabulous job during difficult times and did everything they could to keep the roads network \nopen, people safe and to maintain services to the public.  \n\nTransport Minister Stewart Stevenson has also rejected accusations there was an inadequate response to the \nrecord temperatures and that rapid responses had ensured that salt was delivered to council areas where stocks \nwere running low.\n\nLauren Laverne apologised to listeners after up-and-coming indie band Freelance Whales swore live on air during \nher daytime BBC radio show.\n\nThe New-York based group were taking part in what was billed as their  very first live UK radio session  on Laverne \ns BBC 6 Music programme.\n\nBut during the segment one band member used the phrase  f****** awesome  when describing what audiences \ncould expect when the group play.\n\nLaverne, who also fronts the BBC s Culture Show, told the group:  You can't say that,  and apologised to listeners, \nbefore getting the band to play their session.\n\nA BBC spokeswoman said:  During the show a member of the band used inappropriate language for which Lauren \nimmediately apologised. \n\nMOTORISTS and pedestrians who believe gritting during the recent cold snap left out  well-used roads and \npavements have given council efforts to keep routes ice-free a frosty response.\n\nIn a poll of more than 20,000 of its members, the Automobile Association found three-quarters thought local \nauthorities had dealt with the cold weather not very well or not at all well, while only a quarter rated efforts to clear \nminor roads of ice as acceptable or better.\n\nThe view of work carried out to make pavements safe was even worse, with 86% of respondents expressing \ndissatisfaction with councils  performance.\n\nBut there was widespread praise for the response to ice on the main roads in the council network during the cold \nspell in December and January, suggesting efforts to combat the lowest temperatures in 30 years and utilise over-\nstretched stocks of gritting salt had concentrated on these key routes.\n\nA quarter of those polled said councils had responded very well on local main roads, with a further 55% saying \nthey had performed reasonably well or satisfactorily.

The 26-year-old Londoner, in her second tournament back after a six-month lay-off with a \nknee injury, overcame Barrois 6-1, 6-3 to set up a second-round clash with the Portuguese teenager, Michelle \nLarcher de Brito,  who saw off the American qualifier, Madison Brengle, 6-3, 6-3.\n\nRoyal Troon has been pushed back on the Open Championship rota because of a clash in 2014 with the \nCommonwealth Games in Glasgow and the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles, and the Open that year has been awarded \ninstead to Hoylake.\n\nWith St Andrews hosting the Open every five years and likely to be the venue in 2015, that means 2016 is the \nearliest Royal Troon, which last staged the world s oldest major in 2004, could play host again.\n\nIt is the second time in recent years that the Open rota has been altered because of another sporting event, with \nRoyal St George s taking the 2011 Open instead of Royal Lytham to avoid  a championship at the Kent course \nclashing with the Olympic Games in London in 2012. Lytham, much more distant from London, is to take the 2012 \nOpen instead.\n\nDavid Hill, the R&A s director of championships, said yesterday:  Royal Liverpool is a  fantastic Open \nChampionship venue and it has always been the intention of the championship committee to return swiftly following \nthe success of 2006.\n\n Recognising that the Commonwealth Games and the Ryder Cup add to a busy Scottish sporting calendar in 2014, \nwe took the view that the Open would return to England that year. \n\nIt means that after the Open at St Andrews this July, the Open will be held in England in three of the following four \nyears, broken by Muirfield  in 2013.\n\nGiven that the Open  generally comes to each of the nine venues once every 10 years with the exception of St \nAndrews taking it every five years, it is possible to take an educated guess that the running order after Hoylake will \nbe: 2015 St Andrews, 2016 Royal Troon, 2017 Carnoustie, 2018 Royal Birkdale, 2019 Turnberry, and 2020 St \nAndrews.\n\nKen Arthur, the captain at Royal Troon, said yesterday:  We are not in any way upset or surprised because it was \nextremely unlikely that the 2014 Open would be held here or, indeed, anywhere else in Scotland due to other major \nsporting events taking place that year.\n\n There is no fixed cycle as far as I am led to believe and, hopefully, we will see the Open back here soon after \n2014. \n\nIt will be the 12th time that Royal Liverpool Golf Club, alias Hoylake, will host the Open. It returned to the rota in \n2006 after an absence of 39 years when Tiger Woods became the first back-to-back Open champion since Tom \nWatson in 1983 in front of 230,000 people, a record attendance for the championship in England.\n\nIt was a victory memorable for the way Woods, with just one exception, kept his  driver in the bag and played for  \nposition on the fast-running, sun-baked brown fairways.\n\n\n\n We are delighted that the Open is returning to Royal Liverpool after a relatively short period of time,  added Hill.  In \n2006, Hoylake showcased links golf at its best and players, spectators and officials were united in their praise for \nthe course, and for the venue as a whole. \n\n Colin Montgomerie has identified the big-hitting Spaniard, Alvaro Quiros, as the kind of player he would love to \nhave in his European Ryder Cup team that will try to regain the trophy from the US in Wales in October.\n\nThe 27-year-old will meet Canadian former Masters champion Mike Weir in today s first round of the WGC-\nAccenture Matchplay Championship in Arizona in a tournament which captain Montgomerie said he would be \nwatching every shot of as his team starts to take shape.\n\nMontgomerie noted that Quiros had been present on the leaderboards of all three tournaments in the recently \ncompleted Gulf Swing   11th in Abu Dhabi, second in Qatar and sixth in Dubai   and although he had risen to world \nNo.30 he was still not in an automatic selection position for the 12-man team.\n\n He is someone I want to see mature into a Ryder Cup player and I have to say that every time I see him play, he is \ndoing just that,  said Montgomerie in his latest captain s blog on the European Tour website.\n\n I m delighted with his progress and his form in the Gulf is exactly the sort of consistency I m looking for.\n\n Because of having to go  in the envelope  at last season s Vivendi Trophy after the injury to Anthony Wall, he was \nbitterly disappointed not to be able to play in the singles because I know he wanted to show me his potential in that \nrealm and he wasn t allowed to do that. However, trust me, he is someone that everybody should watch. \n\nThis will be the only matchplay event in which Montgomerie s would-be Ryder Cup players will be involved before \nthe team is finalised in August at the conclusion of the Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles, and because \nof that he has a burning interest.\n\n We had a finalist last year in Paul Casey while Ross Fisher made the semi-finals and Rory McIlroy the quarters, so \nlet s hope this year we can again have a good representation into the latter stages,  said Montgomerie.  This is a \ngreat opportunity for all European players to show me, in a matchplay format, just exactly what they can do and I \nwill be watching every shot hit. I ll be looking out for the results of all of the European players but also, and perhaps \neven more importantly, how they achieve those results.\n\n I want to see guys who show guts and determination, guys who are maybe two or three down with four or five \nholes to play but who battle back to win. It doesn t matter if that s in the first round or the final, trust me, I ll be \ntaking note of it.\n\n Don t get me wrong, the 8&7, 7&6 wins are great and show a player is playing well, but it is the matches which are \ntight and where a player comes out the other side that are crucial, and the ones which could be key in shaping my \nteam. \n\nMontgomerie enthused about the form of European players in the Middle East, particularly the winners, Germany s \nMartin Kaymer, Swede Robert Karlsson, and Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez, the last named who in the past has \ninsisted on an espresso coffee machine, and a ready supply of Rioja and cigars in the team room.\n\n For Martin and Robert, it was great to see them back in the winners  circle after spells out in 2009 with injury. \nMartin had shown a bit of form towards the end of last season with a couple of top-10s but I know Robert was a little \nworried, not having been near a top-30 since he came back from his eye problem,  said Montgomerie.\n\n And what can I say about Miguel? Some players just seem energised in a Ryder Cup year and he is definitely one \nof them. I already have an espresso coffee maker on standby for the team room at Celtic Manor because I have a \nfeeling I might just need it. \n\n\n\nMontgomerie noted players like Lee Westwood, McIlroy and Ian Poulter coming into form and he was especially \npleased at seeing Casey back to fitness after his injury of last season. Intriguingly, if he and Quiros win their first-\nround matches in Arizona they will go head-to-head in the second round.\n\nToday features three all-European matches   Luke Donald against Graeme McDowell, Westwood against Chris \nWood and Oliver Wilson against Jimenez. In a format of play that identifies only winner and losers it will be dog-eat-\ndog   just like it will be in the Ryder Cup.\n\nNo Tiger Woods, no Phil Mickelson. Surely then no better opportunity for Lee Westwood to win his first World Golf \nChampionships title. Except for one thing. \n\nIn nine previous attempts in the Accenture Match Play he has never been made it beyond the second round, let \nalone all the way to a title now worth almost \u00a3900,000. So poor is Westwood s record that when five-year-old \ndaughter Poppy asked when he would be back home from Tucson, Arizona, the world No.4 had to laugh.\n\n Historically Thursday, optimistically Monday,  he said, adding that both Poppy and eight-year-old son Sam then \nlooked at him  quizzically. \n\nNever before, though, has Westwood been the second seed. He has been lifted to that lofty perch not only by his \nown stellar form, but also by Woods staying out of sight of the world since his private life went into meltdown and \nthen Mickelson deciding he was not going to play this week either.\n\nIt is only a couple of years since Westwood, who faces Chris Wood in the opening round tomorrow, considered \nskipping the event as well because the long journey had yielded so little reward.\n\n It s debatable, but I had no tournament on the week before and nothing the week after,  he said.  I think it s worth \nbeing here because  it s a prestigious title, there s plenty of world ranking points and we don t get to play much \nmatch play.\n\n Everybody s capable of shooting a 63 or 62 out there and that can happen against you, so you need a few breaks. \nYou re going to play poorly one round this week and hopefully when you do the other guy plays a little bit worse. \nBut on the reverse side of the coin you can shoot 65 and lose. \n\nWestwood s main target for this season is, of course, a first major but, asked where he would rank a World Golf \nChampionship win, he said:  Just behind a major and the money list. I like the money list [he won that for a second \ntime in November] because it shows consistency over a whole year. But it s certainly only just a tier below that. \n\nRICKY BURNS claims he never doubted his capacity to aspire to the level of world champion against Roman \nMartinez. But the Commonwealth super-featherweight title-holder was mightily relieved all the same when he \nlearned promoter Frank Warren was trying to broker a deal to stage his contest with the WBO champion in \nGlasgow.\n\nThe Coatbridge fighter s sense of relief was understandable, given past history and litany of complaints made by \nBritish boxers that they were the victims of  dodgy  refereeing and biased judging on their  travels abroad.\n\nGiven that Burns had originally seemed destined to challenge Martinez in Puerto Rico   the champion s backyard   \non March 20, any concerns were justified, based on the memory of  the misfortune which befell Ken Buchanan, the \nformer world lightweight champion. Older devotees will recall that Buchanan was the  victim of a blatant low blow by \nRoberto Duran in their 1972 contest which went unpunished and contributed largely to his demise as champion.\n\nBut Burns should have far fewer concerns if, as is hoped, Warren is successful in persuading Martinez s handlers \nto accept a tempting offer to travel to Scotland. \n\n I am delighted because home advantage is a big thing and if the fight happens in Glasgow so much the better,  \nBurns said yesterday.  I would be quietly confident of beating him wherever we fight but  I think it will turn out to be \na much fairer contest.\n\n\n\n If I had been forced to fight in Puerto Rico I would probably have had to knock him out to earn a draw. You hear \nstories about how hard it is for British fighters to get the decision abroad, no  matter how well they box, and that was \na concern.\n\n I knew in my heart I would have to win just about every round in Puerto Rico, which I believe I am capable of \ndoing, to get the decision and even then it might go against me and that was worrying. So this is a huge boost and I \njust hope the deal can be done because it would be great for me and for Scottish boxing. \n\nHowever, Burns concedes that it will be the toughest test of his career.  I will have to produce the performance of \nmy life, but I am more than capable of doing that,  he said.  The classier the opponent the better I fight.\n\n I have been training hard but due to the original switch in dates I had to take my foot off the gas or risk burning out. \nBut I will step up my sparring again as soon. \n\nMeanwhile, Alex Morrison, Burns  manager, has been tasked with finding a suitable venue, with the Kelvin Hall the \nlikely preferred choice.\n\nTHE Government s chief law officer has decided not to challenge the sentences handed down to two brothers who \nsadistically tortured two young boys.\n\nLast month the attackers, now aged 11 and 12, were sentenced to indefinite detention with a minimum term of five \nyears for the brutal assault in Edlington, South Yorkshire.\n\nThe Attorney General, Baroness Scotland, was urged to refer the sentences to the Court of Appeal.\n\nBut in a statement she said:  The judge was clearly correct to impose indeterminate sentences of detention and I \nagree with his analysis and with the minimum terms he set. \n\nThere was public outcry over the sentences, with commentators and children s charities suggesting it was wrong \nthat the boys could be released before their 16th birthdays.\n\nLady Scotland called in the case papers, but rejected the suggestion that the jail terms were unduly lenient.\n\nIn a statement she accepted the case was  truly shocking , but she said five years was the  very least  the boys \nwould serve.\n\nThey will only be released when the risk they pose to the public is seen as  acceptable , she said.\n\nSentencing the pair at Sheffield Crown Court, Mr Justice Keith described  the crimes as  truly exceptional .\n\nThey were carried out  for no reason other than that you got a real kick out of hurting and humiliating them , he \nsaid.\n\nTHE grandfather of a Scout leader killed during a mountain expedition has said that the teenager died doing \nsomething he loved.  \n\nStephen Young, 18, was on an walking trip on Creag Meagaidh, between Spean Bridge and Newtonmore, when he \nfell through a cornice   an overhanging ridge of snow on the mountain   on Monday afternoon. \n\nThe youngster, who had previously raised almost \u00a32,500 for charity by spending 365 nights camped out in the \ngarden of his home in Borough Green, near Sevenoaks, was airlifted to hospital in Fort William but was \npronounced dead on arrival.\n\nA fatal accident inquiry into Stephen s death is now expected to be held. \n\nHis grandfather James, 70, said:  It s a complete and utter disaster. It s an awful blow, he was only 18. I can t \nbelieve it s happened, it s absolutely horrendous.\n\n\n\n He was a very active lad, very outgoing. These things happen, I m afraid. At least he died doing something he \nloved. \n\nStephen s mother Judy, 42, a teacher, and his uncle, Andrew, 45, who is in the Royal Air Force, were part of the \ngroup on their annual trip to the Cairngorms, but were further down the mountain and are not thought to have seen \nthe accident. \n\nStephen, an assistant Scout leader and the youngest trustee of Kent Scout County, hoped to pursue a career in \nfilm production. \n\nMessages of condolence were left on the Facebook page of Kent Scouts, with one poster saying Stephen was a  \ntruly great guy and an inspiration to Scouting .\n\nIn another online tribute page, one user wrote:  In a world where we are quick to condemn the younger generation, \nStephen was someone who disproved this generalisation in spades. He was everything that others should be and \nthe world is a poorer place without him. \n\nSimon Carter, a spokesman for the Scout Association, said:  For his age he was a great leader. He was doing the \nthings he loved with the people he loved.\n\n I have spoken to the people who are with his mum, who is obviously devastated. It is still so raw for her that she \ndoesn t want to say anything at the moment. \n\nEarlier reports had suggested that Stephen was swept away by an avalanche but it later emerged he fell through \nthe shelf of snow. \n\nMark Diggins, of the Scottish Avalanche Information Service, based at Glenmore Lodge, said:  It is a tragedy. My \nunderstanding is that they were on the tops coming down from the Creag Meagaidh and as they were approaching \na place called  the Window , which is a sort of exit, he fell through a snow cornice. \n\nStephen spent all of 2007, including his holidays, sleeping in a tent to raise money for the children s hospice \nDemelza House in Kent. \n\nTed Gladdish, chief executive of Demelza Hospice Care for Children, said yesterday:  Our heartfelt condolences \ngo out to his family and friends. \n\nMeanwhile, police in Iceland will investigate an accident in which a Scots mother and her 11-year-old son became \nlost during a trip to the Langjokull glacier. They had become separated from the group amid worsening weather \nconditions and temperatures as low as -10C. \n\nThe woman flipped over a snowmobile and used it to shield them from the blizzard until rescuers arrived. She was \ntreated in hospital while the boy returned to a hotel with his father and brother. \n\nPolice and the travel agency which organised the tour are to investigate the incident.\n\nA SNIFFER dog which has been involved in high-profile cases in the UK and abroad located the grave of a missing \nman on the Orkney island of Sanday, a murder jury was told yesterday.\n\nFBI consultant Martin Grime told the High Court in Glasgow that he and his springer spaniel dogs, Eddie, Keela and \nMorse, were called in by Northern Constabulary in the hunt for Bob Rose, who disappeared on June 6 last year.\n\nMr Grime told prosecutor Alex Prentice QC that one of the dogs, Eddie, who is trained to detect dead bodies, \nreacted when he was taken to sand dunes at Sty Wick on June 24 last year.\n\nHe said:  His normal reaction is to bark. On this occasion he started to dig. As soon as he started to dig I called him \nback. \n\n\n\nThe jury heard that a thin metal probe was then put into the spot Eddie  indicated before a forensic anthropologist \nwas called in to excavate the scene.\n\nThe jury was told that a body was found at the spot Eddie had indicated.\n\nMr Grime, 52, who described himself as a forensic canine consultant, is an adviser to the FBI in America and \nlectures and trains sniffer dogs there.\n\nHe has also been involved in high-profile cases in the UK and abroad.\n\nMr Grime told the court that Eddie s nose is so sensitive that if someone touched a dead body and then touched a \npiece of paper before hiding it, Eddie would be able to locate the paper using his sense of smell.\n\nNote to desk: Just found out that PA got the ages of Stephen s family wrong. Can we correct it in the copy please?\n\nAndrew is 45 and Judy is 42. \n\nends\n\nPLANS to overhaul Glasgow Housing Association s complicated rent system have been put  on hold,  it has been \nrevealed.\n\nThe association said last August that it was going to change the way it sets rent for its tenants, promising to make it  \nsimpler, fairer and easier to understand .  \n\nThe move, which would affect 60,000 tenants, prompted protests from tenants who would have been left worse off.\n\nAfter four months of consultation, the GHA board now says it needs to do  more work  on the plan after  listening to  \nand  taking on board  views of its tenants and stakeholders.\n\nThe GHA Board says it has decided to  further review the rent structure after assessing feedback from intensive \nconsultation carried out last year. \n\nDuring that consultation period hundreds of concerned tenants signed a petition calling for the plan to be binned.\n\nBut GHA maintained its position that the restructure would leave a majority of tenants better off.\n\nMore than 9,000 people responded to the consultation, with most agreeing with the restructure s aim of making \nrents fairer, simpler and easier to understand.\n\nGHA s original proposals to change the rent structure in 2011 would have put properties into 11 bands, based on \ntheir size and type. The rents of 51% of tenants would have decreased, with 49% increasing. \n\nTHE UK S first dedicated consultant for teenagers suffering from blood cancers including leukaemia has been \nappointed in Glasgow.\n\nDr Nicholas Heaney will take on the role of consultant haematologist for adolescents, dividing his time between two \nTeenage Cancer Trust units at the Beatson and the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill. \n\nThe post was created by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde in response to demand from teenage patients who said \nthey wanted a service tailored to their age group as opposed to being treated alongside much younger children.\n\nTeenagers can develop some of the rarest and most aggressive forms of cancer and experts say the emotional \nupheaval of adolescence can make a diagnosis even more difficult to cope with.\n\nSpecialists say young people have a much better chance in their fight if they are treated by teenage cancer \nexperts, in an environment tailored to their needs.\n\n\n\nDr Heaney, 36, a Glasgow University graduate, said the post would allow him to lead research into teenage forms \nof cancer, which is lagging behind research involving paediatric and adult cases.\n\nHe said:  One of the things we would be looking at is to see whether teenagers are eligible to enter new trials.\n\n At the moment there is a gap between paediatric and adult trials and there is recognition that we need to look at \nthis age gap. For example, it is recognised that adolescents can suffer more side effects from treatment than \nchildren. \n\nAccording to the Teenage Cancer Trust, there are more than 2,000 new cases of cancer in people between the \nages of 13 and 24 each year in the UK.\n\nSimon Davies, chief executive of the trust, said:  We know young people have a much better chance in their fight \nagainst cancer if they are treated by teenage cancer experts, in an environment tailored to their needs. \n\nl Scottish NHS patients wait five weeks on average for cancer treatment from the time the illness is first suspected, \nofficial statistics showed yesterday.\n\nThe amount of patients who began treatment within two months (62 days) of an urgent referral was 96% between \nJuly and September last year. This is slightly up on the previous quarter and above the Government target of 95%   \nwhich has now been met for a year.\n\nBRIAN DONNELLY\n\nTHE first Ceilidh Culture Street Fair is to be held this year in the Scottish capital as the traditional arts festival \nenters its eighth year.\n\nThe Ceilidh Culture events celebrate traditional arts, including music, song, dance and storytelling, in Edinburgh \nand this year expands to run from March 26 to April 18, the festival will this year include its very own street fair.\n\nCastle Street will host to a wide range of stalls with food and drink, crafts, fashion and music, all celebrating \nScotland, From Friday April 2 to Monday April 5, \n\nThe programme features some of Scotland s most accomplished musicians and was launched at Whiski (CORR) \nBar in Edinburgh s Royal Mile yesterday.\n\nThe line-up includes singer and musician Mairi Campbell, who shot to international fame when her haunting \nrendition of Auld Lang Syne featured on the soundtrack of the 2008 Sex and the City movie; folk singer/songwriter \nCaragh Nugent; and celebrated city piper Louise Marshall Millington.\n\nOne of the top acts on the programme is English folk star Kate Rusby, who is making her Ceilidh Culture debut this \nyear. Kate will appear at the Usher Hall on Sunday April 18.  \n\nAnother highlight is four-piece Scottish band Hobotalk, who have toured across Europe, appearing on the bill with \nThe Verve, Madeleine Peyroux, Gomez and Don McLean, to name a few. Hobotalk will play The Voodoo Rooms on \nFriday April 16. \n\nMeanwhile, the popular Ceilidh Club will host acts such as accordionist Sandy Brechin and his band the Jimi \nShandrix Experience at The Lot on Tuesday April 13. \n\nSteve Cardownie, Festivals and Events Champion for the Edinburgh, said:  Ceilidh Culture is a real celebration of \nall that is wonderful about the traditional arts in Scotland.\n\n The festival brings together a dazzling line-up from more than 30 contributors, proudly showcasing homegrown \ntalent alongside international acts.\n\n\n\n This year we are delighted to announce the first ever Ceilidh Culture Street Fair, which will be held over the Easter \nweekend. \n\nMairi Campbell, who hopes to launch her first solo album at The Voodoo Rooms on Friday April 16 and will perform \nwith choir Sangstream at Augustine United Church on Friday March 26 said:  I love this festival, it truly is a people s \nfolk festival and I can think of no better place or time to showcase my first solo album. \n\nScottish NHS patients wait five weeks on average for cancer treatment from the time the illness is first suspected, \nofficial statistics showed today.\n\nThe level of patients who began treatment within two months (62 days) of an urgent referral was 96% between July \nand September last year.\n\nThis is slightly up on the previous quarter and above the Government target of 95% - which has now been met for a \nwhole year.\n\nAn Aberdeenshire Council spokesman said:  We can confirm we have received a masterplan for the Menie \ndevelopment, along with a related application for the championship golf course element of the scheme.\n\n These documents are required as part of conditions outlined in the original planning consent, and will now be \nassessed by planners in consultation with various statutory bodies and others. Members of the public will also have \nthe chance to view and comment on the plans. \n\nCREDIT card interest rates have hit a 12-year high despite historically low Bank of England base rates, new \nresearch has found.\n\nThe average APR on plastic now stands at 18.8%, up four percentage points since the recent low of 14.8% in \nFebruary 2006, according to figures just released by personal finance website Moneyfacts.\n\nIt comes as another report indicates the reliance placed on credit cards by British consumers   a survey by price \ncomparison firm moneysupermarket.com suggests that one in five adults have three or more cards.\n\nFurthermore, around 14 million people use credit cards to pay for day-to-day expenses, a survey of more than \n2,000 Britons indicated.\n\nIt means borrowers could be hit by heavy interest repayments over the coming year   a time when many are \nsuffering as a result of the economic conditions.\n\nMoneyfacts  research found that credit card rates have steadily crept up despite the Bank of England slashing its \ninterest rate since the onset of the economic downturn.\n\nIn February 2008, the average APR charged on cards stood at 16.8%, at a time when the base rate was set at \n5.50%.\n\nThis jumped to 17.7% a year later, with providers adding a further percentage point on average rates in the \nfollowing 12 months. \n\nThe current rate   the highest since February 1998, comes at a time when the Bank of England base rate is \nrecorded at 0.50%.\n\nDONALD Trump has lifted the lid on detailed plans for the Scottish golf course development that has sparked so \nmuch controversy. \n\nMembers of the public will, for the first time, be able to see how the American billionaire proposes to transform \nMenie estate in Aberdeenshire into the resort. \n\n\n\nThe masterplan, which has been submitted for consideration by Aberdeenshire Council, includes an 18-hole golf \ncourse built amid the sand dunes   which the course designer said would provide the  most dramatic, stimulating, \ninvigorating stretch of golf anywhere I have seen in my career . \n\nAn aerial view of the development shows a hotel, holiday homes and a residential village in addition to the course \nitself. \n\nMr Trump said:  This is another significant step towards our goal of building the world s greatest golf course and \nresort in Aberdeenshire. \n\nThe billionaire has already set his sights on turning the golf course into an Open venue and has recruited \ngroundsman Paul O Connor, the driving force behind Carnoustie for 20 years, as the first manager of the \nchampionship resort on the Menie Estate. \n\nDr Martin Hawtree, who has worked on Carnoustie and Muirfield and designed the 18-hole course on Menie, said:  \nThe golf course will lack for nothing. The landscape framework of the site comes close to an ideal. There is nothing \nmissing and the layout as conceived would contain no weak holes.  \n\nMr Trump, whose mother was born on Lewis, selected the Menie Estate in March 2006. Environmental activists \nfeared the project would have an adverse effect on the dunes, which are designated a site of Special Scientific \nInterest. \n\nResidents who face being removed from their homes to make way for the development have objected, but the \napplication has received unprecedented support from the business community. It was given the go-ahead after a \npublic inquiry. \n\nA spokesman for Trump International said yesterday that detailed plans for environmental, landscaping, \nconstruction and infrastructure were now complete.  \n\nGareth Hoskins, director of Glasgow firm Gareth Hoskins Architects, added:  The masterplan establishes a \nframework for both the resort and residential community that is about creating well-designed places and ensuring \nease of movement and accessibility both for the surrounding communities and the wider public. \n\n A spokesman for Aberdeenshire Council said:  We can confirm we have received a masterplan for the Menie \ndevelopment, along with a related application for the championship golf course element of the scheme.\n\n These documents are required as part of conditions outlined in the original planning consent, and will now be \nassessed by planners in consultation with various statutory bodies and others. Members of the public will also have \nthe chance to view and comment on the plans. \n\nThe masterplan can be viewed at an exhibition at the Udny Arms Hotel in Main Street, Newburgh, on March 12 and \n13.\n\nSO Donald Trump has taken  another significant step towards our goal of building the world s greatest golf course \nand resort . You sure can t accuse the great man of hiding his light under a bushel.\n\nWith erstwhile Carnoustie groundsman Paul O Connor  on board in Aberdeenshire alongside architect Martin \nHawtree, who has involvement in four Open Championship courses on his CV, it is not difficult to see where The \nDonald is going. He wants the Open there. Oh, and the Ryder Cup as well. \n\nWith barely a sod cut, the course is being hailed, breathtakingly, as better than Muirfield, Turnberry, Carnoustie,  St \nAndrews Old Course,  Royal Troon, Loch Lomond, Gleneagles: places all oozing with history and tradition, and that \ns just in Scotland.\n\nFrankly, I can t see the understated body that is the R&A taking the Open to a course called Trump International \nGolf Links any time in the current geological period, even if it does fit all requirements.\n\n\n\nMr Trump wants to dedicate the links to the memory of his mother, Mary MacLeod. That being the case, he could \nhave called it The MacLeod, instead of making it a monument to himself.\n\nI have no doubt it will be a very good golf course, but the world s greatest? Let s see the course finished first, and \nplease start looking at something more modest and realistic for an opening event, like the Tartan Tour s Northern \nOpen.\n\nDouglas Lowe is The Herald s golf correspondent\n\n1968 Jean-Claude Killy of France, one of the greatest alpine skiers of all time, won his third gold medal at the \nWinter Olympics in Grenoble.

Musgrave took 36:32.4 minutes to complete the course and has enjoyed only 48 hours \nrest before returning to the start line for the dash.\n\n The opening round showed that I have improved but it was nowhere near my best,  said the 19-year-old.  I think I \nam going to need more time than I have to get myself to where I want to be. While I performed better than I have \nbeen it did confirm what I suspected.  I am still not in my best shape but hopefully by the longer distance races later \nnext week I can get back up to my best. \n\nAndrew Young, his fellow Huntly competitor, used his 48-hour break to redraw his blueprint after admitting his \ntactics failed in the opening event. The 17-year-old son of British cross-country team coach Roy Young started in \n71st but slipped back into the field and finished in 74th position in 38.45.1 minutes.\n\n It wasn t too great in the first event   I worked on tactics and stuck to them but I don t think that worked out,  said \nYoung.  I don t know what it was maybe I got a cold or something but I just couldn t ski as fast as I wanted to and \nthat is a little bit annoying. I ve had a look though and I ll change what needs to be changed. \n\nBen Kilner, the Banchory snowboarder, will make his Olympic bow four years later than first planned in the men s \nhalfpipe qualifiers this evening.

I m still just aiming to enjoy the whole event but the further I can go then the more races I \ncan do and the more experience I will gain,  said the Livingston skater .  If I can keep getting through then I stand \nas good a chance as anyone else. \n\nBritain s brightest alpine skiing medal hope Chemmy Alcott will make her long awaited start today in the downhill \nevent. Bad weather had delayed the start of the event and the six-time national champion admits she s desperate \nto get going.\n\n We ve had a really busy schedule and then we ve been hanging about a bit,  said Alcott.  It isn t ideal but I m just \nlooking forward to starting,  she said.\n\n* Lloyds TSB, proud partner of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games and supporter of Team GB. Visit \nLloydsTSB.com/London2012\n\nDavid Murdoch and his world champion team had a disappointing start to their Olympic campaign yesterday, going \ndown 4-6 to Sweden s Niklas Edin in their opening round-robin game.\n\nAfter they took the lead with a single in the second end, the GB quartet   Ewan MacDonald, Pete Smith and Euan \nByers, as well as Murdoch   never dominated and allowed the Swedes to dictate play.\n\n\n\nThey let the Swedes score two in the third end and then, after blanking the next two ends, Murdoch went further \nbehind in the sixth when his attempted double take-out just failed, leaving a Swedish stone counting for a steal of \none and a score of 3-1 to Sweden.\n\nThe British team scored a single in the seventh and then two in the ninth to close the score to 4-5, but Edin took out \na British counter in the tenth for a 6-4 win.\n\nMurdoch said,  I think we were half-an-inch off making a hell of a lot of shots today, and that was pretty much the \ntale of the tape. If I had made my double in the sixth, it would have been a different game; we would have been two \nup and cruising. But it wasn t going to be today, we rubbed a few guards and we didn t get our rocks in the places \nwe wanted them to be to put them under pressure .\n\nThird player MacDonald agreed with his skip s appraisal.  That was absolutely not how we wanted to start, it was \none of those games . . . an inch or two here or there and it s different. We didn t play that badly, but things just didn \nt run for us today. We had two or three good chances, and that would have made a big difference. We ve just got to \nregroup and come back firing tomorrow .\n\nAlthough disappointed to lose his opener, Murdoch tried to put the result in perspective.  It s pretty much the norm \nfor us to lose the first game in a championship . . . maybe it s a good thing .\n\nLooking forward, he added:  We re not even looking at what the other teams are doing just now, it s all about \nourselves and this is a long event. We didn t play as offensively as we wanted to there, we just need to be sharper, \nget a few more rocks in play, and trust our skill.\n\n Our goal is to get to the semi-final, and if that means being in first place or fourth we don t really care, but it s going \nto be a tough week, with a lot of good teams .\n\nThe British men now sit out the second round-robin session before facing France in their next game this afternoon.\n\n In the women s event, Eve Muirhead s rink face China, the world champions, this morning having been given a \nbye in yesterday s opening round-robin.\n\nThey are then back on  the ice against the Olympic champions, Sweden, in what is a very tough initiation at this \nlevel for 19-year-old Muirhead and her team of Jackie Lockhart, Kelly Wood and Lorna Vevers.\n\nathletics \n\nCross Country\n\n* Speyside Runner North District League.

If I had made my double in the sixth, it would have been a different game; we would have been two \nup and cruising. But it wasn t going to be today, we rubbed a few guards and we didn t get our rocks in the places \nwe wanted them to be to put them under pressure .\n\nThird player MacDonald agreed with his skip s appraisal.  That was absolutely not how we wanted to start, it was \none of those games . . . an inch or two here or there and it s different. We didn t play that badly, but things just didn \nt run for us today. We had two or three good chances, and that would have made a big difference. We ve just got to \nregroup and come back firing tomorrow .\n\nAlthough disappointed to lose his opener, Murdoch tried to put the result in perspective.  It s pretty much the norm \nfor us to lose the first game in a championship . . . maybe it s a good thing .\n\nLooking forward, he added:  We re not even looking at what the other teams are doing just now, it s all about \nourselves and this is a long event. We didn t play as offensively as we wanted to there, we just need to be sharper, \nget a few more rocks in play, and trust our skill.\n\n Our goal is to get to the semi-final, and if that means being in first place or fourth we don t really care, but it s going \nto be a tough week, with a lot of good teams .\n\nThe British men now sit out the second round-robin session before facing France in their next game this afternoon.\n\n In the women s event, Eve Muirhead s rink face China, the world champions, this morning having been given a \nbye in yesterday s opening round-robin.\n\nThey are then back on  the ice against the Olympic champions, Sweden, in what is a very tough initiation at this \nlevel for 19-year-old Muirhead and her team of Jackie Lockhart, Kelly Wood and Lorna Vevers.\n\ngolf\n\nWallace Booth s quest to gain a foothold in the pro game has led to the Comrie rookie entering the PGA EuroPro \nTour s qualifying school in April, writes Nick Rodger.\n\nThe Eisenhower Trophy winner, who joined the paid ranks after last September s Walker Cup, has already failed in \nhis bid for both a European and an Asian Tour card over the past few months and will now have to build his career \non the third-tier circuit.\n\nBooth is on US mini-tour duty in South Carolina this week at the Palmetto Hall championship where he is joined in \nthe field by former Scottish Youths  champion Joel Hendry and Inverness exile Russell Knox.\n\n* Denis Durnian, the former Scottish Senior Open champion, has revealed that he his fighting cancer.

Musgrave took 36:32.4 minutes to complete the course and has enjoyed only 48 hours \nrest before returning to the start line for the dash.\n\n The opening round showed that I have improved but it was nowhere near my best,  said the 19-year-old.  I think I \nam going to need more time than I have to get myself to where I want to be. While I performed better than I have \nbeen it did confirm what I suspected.  I am still not in my best shape but hopefully by the longer distance races later \nnext week I can get back up to my best. \n\nAndrew Young, his fellow Huntly competitor, used his 48-hour break to redraw his blueprint after admitting his \ntactics failed in the opening event. The 17-year-old son of British cross-country team coach Roy Young started in \n71st but slipped back into the field and finished in 74th position in 38.45.1 minutes.\n\n It wasn t too great in the first event   I worked on tactics and stuck to them but I don t think that worked out,  said \nYoung.  I don t know what it was maybe I got a cold or something but I just couldn t ski as fast as I wanted to and \nthat is a little bit annoying. I ve had a look though and I ll change what needs to be changed. \n\nBen Kilner, the Banchory snowboarder, will make his Olympic bow four years later than first planned in the men s \nhalfpipe qualifiers this evening.

So goes the motto of Israel s overseas intelligence service   Mossad.\n\nShould the agency turn out to be responsible for the killing in Dubai of Hamas commander Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, \nit will remind many of the story depicted in Steven Spielberg s movie Munich. \n\n\n\nBased on true events, the film tells of a Mossad assassination squad sent out to retaliate for the kidnap and murder \nof 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics by Palestinian terrorists. \n\nLike the film, recent events in Dubai have once again highlighted the controversial issue of state-sponsored killings \nas part of a counter terrorism strategy. \n\nWhile Israel has never officially acknowledged having a policy of targeted assassinations, in the years since the \nMunich massacre, Mossad is said by intelligence analysts to have continued its policy of striking back overseas \nwhenever and wherever it deems  necessary. \n\nIt s unlikely that such strikes would be restricted by international borders, or the territorial and legal constraints of \nany foreign state. Many such Israeli missions are said to be undertaken by the  Metsada , a highly secret \ndepartment within Mossad that operates  combatants. \n\nSecurity experts say that within the Metsada is the  Kidon  (a Hebrew translation of the word  bayonet ): a specially \ntrained elite  assassination unit. \n\nEach hit team is said to comprise four members. One acts as the  target locator  and is tasked to keep tabs on the \nvictim s movements. Another is the  transporter , charged with getting the team safely away from the killing area. \nThe remaining two will be the  shooters , or those that will execute the  hit . \n\nTHE recording studio immortalised by The Beatles  album of the same name has been put up for sale by its \nowners.

Officers discovered the youngster s body at a property in Milverton Road in the Erdington area \nof Birmingham at 5.30pm on Saturday.\n\nMEMBERS of a suspected hit squad blamed for the assassination of a Hamas commander in Dubai used fake \nBritish and Irish passports.\n\nPolice in Dubai named 11 Europeans   including six on British passports and three Irish   they hold responsible for \nkilling Mahmoud al-Mabhouh. But the Foreign Office said yesterday the UK documents were  fraudulent  and \nofficials in Dublin said they hadn t issued passports in the names.\n\nDubai police released the names and photos of the alleged gang, along with their apparent nationalities according \nto the passports. They also did not rule out involvement from Israeli intelligence service Mossad. \n\nThose travelling with UK documents were named as Michael Lawrence Barney, James Leonard Clarke, Jonathan \nLouis Graham, Paul John Keeley, Stephen Daniel Hodes and Melvyn Adam Mildiner.\n\nThe Foreign Office launched an inquiry after revealing the passports of the suspects were fake, raising the \npossibility they were using stolen identities. A spokesman said:  We believe the passports used were fraudulent \nand we ve begun investigating. \n\nMelvyn Adam Mildiner, 31, one of the men identified by the Dubai police as a suspect, was shocked when a \njournalist reached him on the phone in Israel and read him the information released by Dubai officials.\n\n\n\nMildiner, who said he holds a British and an Israeli passport, confirmed the name and the passport number \nmatched his but said the date of birth was a few days off.\n\nHe said he did not know how anybody obtained his UK passport, which was issued in 2001 and never reported \nlost.\n\nThe Irish Foreign Office said they had no record of passports being issued under the names released in Dubai   \nGail Folliard, Evan Dennings and Kevin Daveron. A spokesman added the passport numbers appeared to be \ncounterfeits as they had the wrong number of digits and contained no letters.\n\nAl-Mabhouh, a founder of Hamas s military wing, died in his luxury hotel room near Dubai International Airport on \nJanuary 20. It is claimed he was suffocated. Hamas pointed the finger at Israel, blaming Mossad   the country s \nsecret service   for carrying out the hit.\n\nAl-Mabhouh was wanted by Israel for his role in the 1989 kidnapping and killing of two Israeli soldiers.\n\nIsraeli officials also pointedly accused al-Mabhouh of helping smuggle rockets into the Gaza Strip, the coastal \nPalestinian territory ruled by Hamas.\n\nBut officials outside Dubai said at least two Palestinians linked to the case were in Dubai custody, leaving Hamas \nand its rivals trading bitter accusations.\n\nLUCY Mack was in the Argyle Street branch of bookseller Waterstone s when the heavens opened outside, and \nfolk were running in all directions to get shelter from the rain.\n\nTwo ned-like chaps ran into Waterstone s, stopped in their  tracks, looked around, and one declared:  Aw, naw, it s \na bluidy bookshop,  before both ran back out into the rain.\n\nCLASSROOM conversations, continued.

A regular user of Linlithgow railway station found his nerves \nbeing frayed by a damaged door on the waiting room which constantly slammed shut and flew open at regular \n\n\n\nintervals, and so he set up the Facebook group  Will somebody at Linlithgow station please fix the door that keeps \nbanging? \n\nAfter attracting 61 members, the group can now report that the door has just been fixed.\n\nOr as one of the group posted:  If only the Burmese generals were members of Facebook, maybe they would \nrelease Aung San Suu Kyi. \n\n WHY do folk who run television companies,  asked the philosopher  in the golf club the other day,  assume that \npeople who are deaf are also insomniacs. \n\nWarming, soothing tea. A social event, a pick-me-up, a comforter. Tea is a great social leveller, given to both vicars \nand builders alike. \n\nIt is a cure-all and a cause for celebration on its own, but hitch it to the wagon of afternoon cake and you have an \naltogether brighter star.\n\nThere is something innately civilising about afternoon tea. One, for it must be  one  and not  you , cannot slouch at a \ntable set properly for tea.\n\nOne cannot wear jeans or sneakers, sport ragged nails or unkempt hair. Not in the face of delicate china, weighty \nsilver, a tablecloth like a bride s skirts and a three-tier cake stand.\n\nEven stripped bare of all its frippery, afternoon tea is a winner for that one central reason: cake. Cake is one of life s \nquiet glories. I, for one, have never met a cake I did not like. Chocolate cake, carrot cake, Victoria sponge and \nhummingbird. Mmm. Cake s one downfall is that, in polite company at least, you cannot have it all.\n\nWith cake comes choice. Chocolate or carrot. Victoria or hummingbird. Just one slice. Not so afternoon tea. It is the \nswitherer s delight. A three-tiered tower of pure pleasure.\n\nSandwiches? Try a finger of each. Scones? Crumpets? Sultana bread? Have a wee taste of all. \n\nAnd, then, top tier. Glorious, tooth-melting, stomach-plumping top tier of cake in many varieties and no need to \nfeign restraint. Time for tea is an apt phrase indeed. Afternoon tea comes in miniature courses that cannot be \nrushed but plead to be savoured. The tea itself is a hot punctuation, slowing the meal to take an hour   even two.\n\nIf I had the skill to arrange my words into neat stanzas, I would write sonnets for the ritual of scones, cake and tea.\n\nThis is not in praise of afternoon tea; it is a love song.\n\nThis is intriguing. Ms Pauline Hanson, formerly an adornment to Australia s House of Representatives, has said \nshe fancies retracing ancestral footsteps by moving to Britain. It seems that  our way of life , Australian-style, is no \nlonger to her taste. So another hopeful immigrant could soon be heading this way. \n\nThe intriguing part is that Hanson once had a unique selling point as leader of the briefly electable One Nation \nparty: she didn t care for immigrants. In fact, in her maiden parliamentary speech in Canberra in 1996, she claimed \nthat Australia was  in danger of being swamped by Asians . There was as much chance of that, in fact, as there \nwas of  Hanson being overwhelmed by a sense of irony. \n\nNevertheless, she is thought to hold dual citizenship. She says she loves England and Ireland, particularly   having \noften attacked multiculturalism    the culture . She, meanwhile, hopes to escape  over-regulation, increasing taxes \nand lack of true representation    in Britain?   and anticipates no problems. She is probably right about that. \n\nA good old family welcome for an anti-immigrant immigrant would be no more surreal, after all, than our own \ngovernment s border policies. Hanson doesn t seem to be hard up, she speaks the language, after a fashion, and \nshe hails from what was once called the white Commonwealth, otherwise  our kith and kin . It would make her the \nperfect supporter for all our tough-but-sensible immigrant incarceration measures. \n\n\n\nJim Murphy, the Scottish  Secretary, would find that piece of  whimsy deplorable, no doubt.  After all, he has just \ntold BBC Radio Scotland that he  didn t come into politics to remove families who come to our country seeking a \nbetter life . One day he will tell us why he did come into politics. Meanwhile, with a heavy heart, he finds himself \nendorsing the dawn raids, the incarceration of children in the Dungavel camp and the casting of families into peril. \n\nMurphy feels really bad about it: let there be no mistake about that. He does not  enjoy  the fact that families are \nremoved when they fail to meet  the criteria . When he has time in his next major Glasgow speech on immigration, \nhe will no doubt explain and justify those criteria. For now, it seems, there is a more pressing problem. \n\nThat would be those unnamed persons who believe we  can operate an open-door policy . Or, as one of those ever-\nshy  sources close to the minister  told the Times, these are people who seem to believe  that they must take the \nside of every failed asylum-seeker. They do not seem to believe that you need to maintain public confidence in an \nimmigration system . \n\nThat would be the SNP, then. It is, after all, the only party capable of containing reckless ministers who never, it is \nalleged, support forced deportations. The Nats are the target and this, it appears, is to be the flavour of Scotland s \nGeneral Election campaign. First, Murphy advocates cash prizes for anyone informing on benefit fraud, now he puts \nin a good word for Dungavel. Inspiring. \n\nWe shouldn t pick on the Scottish Secretary, necessarily. Some might have thought the election would turn on the \neconomy, recession, unemployment and the boring old public finances. But the appearance of immigration on the \nagenda when polling day approaches is an old British tradition. If nothing else,  it has the effect of destroying any \nhope of rational   therefore, inconvenient   debate. \n\nWestern Europe needs immigrants. The demographic trends   birth rates steady or falling, populations ageing   are \nclear. History shows, meanwhile, that those  seeking a better life  will generally work damned hard for it, and instil \nthe virtue in their children. They also have a habit of enlivening the culture in ways that Pauline Hanson might fail \nto appreciate. But as to swamping those already here, themselves often the descendants of immigrants? Hardly. \n\nAgainst those benefits stand some hard facts. A great many people in Asia and Africa would grab that new life in \nEurope if they could. As the climate goes to hell, their numbers will increase. The continent can cope easily enough, \nbut if one country becomes easier to reach than the others   the cry of anti-immigrant campaigners in every country   \nthere would be problems. There is no point in pretending otherwise. \n\nRecession, equally, is liable to alter calculations. Before the crash, Britain was accommodating an influx of migrant \nlabour   though not asylum-seekers   with no great fuss. Most soon understood that those workers were needed, \nand that they were doing jobs for which there were few takers among the indigenous population. There was ample \nevidence, nevertheless, that wages in some sectors were being suppressed as a result, though I don t remember \nministers fretting over that. \n\nIn any case, the east Europeans had another advantage: they were  as white as Pauline Hanson. That category \ncontains precious few of the asylum-seekers who fail to meet Murphy s criteria. Race, not economics or national \nsecurity or social planning, is what makes immigration potent in Britain. Ask yourself: how long would Dungavel \nstay in operation if its inmates were poor white New Zealanders? \n\nSo the Scottish Secretary gives us his very thoughtful speech with its unimpeachable bullet-point: you can t let \neveryone in. True. But to avoid misunderstandings, particularly as an election approaches, you can distinguish \nbetween those seeking asylum and economic migrants. You can say why your criteria are calibrated to political \ncalculations. You can stop excusing racism as  misgivings . You could even say why Scotland is an ideal second \nhome for those fleeing misery. \n\nBut here s an authentic irony. Most of those who seek asylum  here would jump at the chance to pay their \u00a3720 and \nsit New Labour s citizen test for the sake of that prized passport. Native-born, with all the trimmings, I need not ever \nsubmit to such very British indignities. The Queen will have to wait for my loyalty oath. \n\n\n\nAs to the reality behind the euphemisms, the facts behind all the fear-mongering and the coded speeches? \nMuslims, those demonised folk, at present constitute 2.7% of the population of these islands. Pauline Hanson \nwouldn t even notice them.\n\nFINAL TEST Vangipurappu Laxman crafted an  unbeaten 143 to put India in position to retain the world No.1 \nranking and revive memories of his epic innings against Australia in 2000-1.\n\nLaxman shared in India s record seventh-wicket stand of 259 against South Africa with captain Mahendra Singh \nDhoni (132 not out), which put India in sight of a series-levelling victory in the second and final test at Eden \nGardens.\n\nIndia posted 643 for six declared to take a lead of 347 on the third day after resuming on 342-5. South Africa were \nsix without  loss at the close.\n\nLaxman hit a 281 at the same venue to help India script a sensational turnaround after following on to end Australia \ns  16-match winning streak.\n\n I really feel happy whenever I do well and bail the team out of tough situations,  Laxman said.\n\nNewcastle\n\nSouthwell\n\nIN SCOTLAND Plans for an SPL-style split have been abandoned after feeder clubs voiced concerns over the idea, \nwrites William Dick.\n\nThe Scottish National Cricket League had hoped to introduce a 14-team Premiership and a Championship featuring \n16 sides with both divisions dividing into smaller groups. However, clubs from the Western Union, East and Border \nLeagues and Strathmore Union have forced a rethink.\n\nStewart Oliver, the league secretary, explained:  There was a lot of concern expressed that clubs would not know \nwho or where they were playing later in the season. Many SNCL clubs have 2nd and 3rd XIs who play in the feeder \nleagues and their fixtures are determined at the start of the season.\n\n Clearly what we were planning would have had an effect on ground availability and made life impossible for some \nclubs to plan ahead. We have taken on board these concerns and come up with another solution. \n\nThe new proposal involves two divisions of 16 teams, all playing each other once. However, the season will be \nexpanded to 18 games using a complex seeding system based on the previous season s performance.\n\nClubs voted 18-12 in favour of change last year and have been given until Friday to comment on the latest \nproposal. However, there will be no further vote and it is understood the current plan will be implemented from \n2011.\n\nDavid Coulthard has tested for the Mercedes DTM team, fuelling speculation he could return to racing in the \nGerman series this year.\n\nThe 38-year-old Scot, Britain s highest pointscorer in F1 history, hinted last year he could be tempted to return to \nracing, in the prestigious DTM championship.\n\nCoulthard retired from Formula One at the end of the 2008 season and has since been working for the BBC as a \nrace commentator. Despite attempts by series chiefs to play down Coulthard s two-day test in Spain at the end of \nlast week as  non-binding , clearly a role with Mercedes is an option.\n\nCoulthard drove the AMG Mercedes C-Class at the Monteblanco circuit in Southern Spain, re-establishing a link \nwith his previous employees.\n\n\n\nThe Twynholm-born driver raced for the manufacturer in F1 between 1996 and 2004.\n\nInterestingly, if he was to pen a deal, he would team up with fellow Scot, Paul di Resta. He combines duties as F1 \ntest and reserve driver for Force India with driving for Mercedes in the DTM.\n\nSpeaking of the Scot s involvement in Spain last week, DTM officials stated:  Coulthard s test shouldn t be \nregarded as a hint to potential involvement of the Scot in the 2010 DTM series. \n\nAt the Autosport International show in January, Coutlhard himself commented that the DTM  might be a possibility \nfor the future. \n\n* Top drivers are not expecting another Brawn-like phenomenon of the kind which stunned Formula One last year. \nFerrari, Mercedes, Red Bull and McLaren will be the forces to be reckoned with in 2010, they forecast on Tuesday.\n\nLast year Brawn, which has become Mercedes, rose from the ashes of the departed Honda to conquer the \nconstructors  championship and help Jenson Button to the drivers  title. But this year the new  big four  appear to be \nahead of the rest.\n\n I think McLaren, Mercedes and Red Bull are the teams which we have to pay the most attention to,  new Ferrari \ndriver Fernando Alonso said ahead of the third official pre-season testing session starting in Jerez today.  It s \nimpossible to choose one, we just hope none of the three are as competitive. \n\nSeven-times champion Michael Schumacher, who has come out of retirement to race for Mercedes, is pleased with \nhis team s progress in testing so far.\n\n I am fully convinced that we have a car that is able to fight for the championship,  he told www.formula1.com.\n\n Where we are exactly is hard to say. This is especially true for me as I don t have the data from last year s car,  \nadded the 41-year-old. \n\nFellow German Sebastian Vettel is hoping for drier weather this week than at last week s Jerez test.  I felt pretty \nhappy in the car,  said the Red Bull driver.  The weather was too changeable, so we did a little bit of work, but there \ns a lot more to come. \n\nTHE two horses who fought out a great duel that was forgotten in the Denman drama in the Aon Chase at Newbury \nmade their own headlines yesterday after bookies  made them joint favourites for the Grand National at Aintree.\n\nTricky Trickster, trained by Paul Nicholls, and Niche Market, handled by Bob Buckler, were separated by a head \nhaving taken over the lead following Denman s blunders on Saturday.\n\nThey are locked together again at 11st 4lbs in the weights announced yesterday for the National, and Ladbrokes \nand Boylesports make them equal favourites at 12-1.\n\nNicholls, who has never won this prize, despite sending out 44 runners since 1992, has four other candidates this \ntime but Trickster is most fancied.\n\nHe declared himself happy with the seven-year-old s weight, saying:  He s gone up 3lb but that won t make any \ndifference. He s a big, strong horse and he should improve. In the Grand National, 3-5lb won t make a difference \nand a lot more it is down to luck. \n\nBuckler was less satisfied about Niche Market s weight.  He has gone up 4lb for his run in the Aon, which seems a \nlot,  said the trainer.  The plan is to go to Aintree but the owner is keen on the William Hill Chase [at Cheltenham] \nfirst so he could take that. \n\nAlbertas Run, Madison Du Berlais and Notre Pere top the weights on 11st 10lb, while last year s winner Mon Mome \nis allotted 11st 7lb, a 7lb rise on his winning weight.\n\nhttp://www.formula1.com/\n\n\nComply Or Die, successful in 2008, is on 11st 5lb and 2006 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner War Of Attrition, who has \nbeen successful over hurdles recently, was handed 11st 1lb.\n\nHowever, he will miss the race as trainer Mouse Morris is unimpressed by the weight his former Cheltenham Gold \nCup winner has been asked to carry.  I think with that weight they are basically saying they don t want us to run,  \nhe said.\n\nMorris had hoped to take in the Ladbrokes World Hurdle at Cheltenham before going on to the National, but he was \ndisappointed with the handicapper.\n\n If [joint top-weight] Albertas Run is rated 164 and we are getting 9lb, that means he s rating us 155. I entered our \nhorse in a handicap chase at Sandown the other week and they rated him 149, so I don t know how they ve come \nup with 11st 1lb. \n\nMore immediately,  if Musselburgh passes a 7.00am inspection, there is some decent fare to be seen at the East \nLothian meeting this afternoon. \n\nIn The Scottish Racing Handicap Hurdle, Palomar (3.50) looks to have a big chance following a good second in the \nScottish Triumph Hurdle on this track.\n\n* Selection \n\nMusselburgh 3.50 Palomar\n\nTHE Howard Johnson trained Quwetwo is set to take on Zaynar as he makes his return in tomorrow s Morebattle \nHurdle at Kelso.\n\nThe seven-year-old won two of his three starts over timber last season, his only defeat coming in the Ballymore \nNovices  Hurdle at Cheltenham.\n\nJohnson had hoped to go novice chasing with Quwetwo this season, but the weather has halted his progress.  He ll \ngo to Kelso, all being well, as we ve decided it s too late in the season to go chasing with him,  said Johnson.\n\n He must have missed 10 entries over fences this season because of the weather and we ve decided we might as \nwell save him so he s a novice next season. He ll obviously be taking on Zaynar at Kelso and we ll just see how he \ngets on there before we decide where we go next with him.\n\n At the moment I wouldn t want to be going beyond about two and quarter miles with him as he s all speed. \n\n1972 Volkswagen broke the record held by the Model T Ford by selling the 15,007,034th production model of the \nBeetle.\n\n1982 Death of jazz pianist \n\nand composer \n\nThelonious Sphere Monk, instrumental \n\nin the development \n\nof  bebop .\n\n2009 President Barack Obama signed into \n\nlaw a $787bn (\u00a3553bn) stimulus package aimed at pulling the US economy out of recession.\n\n Let the train take the strain,  disc jockey Jimmy Savile used to intone in the iconic 1970s TV advertisement for \nBritish Rail. Two men who do not appear to have followed his advice are Labour councillors Alistair Watson and \n\n\n\nDavid McLachlan, despite holding positions as chair and vice-chair of Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT), \na body dedicated to encouraging the use of public transport. \n\nNow they have been rumbled,  thanks to information obtained by The Herald. The councillors, who live in Glasgow \nand Hamilton respectively, have claimed more than \u00a328,000 for car use in connection with SPT over three years. In \na single year, Mr McLachlan managed to chalk up more than 15,000 miles at a cost to the  public purse of nearly \n\u00a37500. (Mr Watson resigned on Monday on  health grounds, after being caught up in a row about overseas trips.)\n\nThese claims are not illegal but they imply a culture of entitlement that is abhorrent at a time when drastic spending \ncuts are costing hundreds of public sector jobs. There is an onus on elected politicians to make every penny count \nunder such circumstances. Audit Scotland must examine these claims and ask why they were not challenged, \nespecially when other board members, including the other vice-chair, were billing the public purse for less than one-\ntenth of what Mr McLachlan was claiming. Were all these journeys really necessary?\n\nIs this the remnant of a culture that tends to develop when one party   in this case, Labour   has held sway in  an \narea for so long that it begins to treat it as its fiefdom? \n\nWhen councillors were unpaid, turning a blind eye to small perquisites was understandable but that no longer \napplies. These men receive around \u00a316,000 as councillors and additional payments of \u00a320,295 and \u00a311,163 \nrespectively for their SPT work. \n\nThese revelations merely add grist  to the mill of those who argue that  SPT has outlived its usefulness. It is  a mere \nshadow of the body from which it emerged (Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive), having been shorn of both \ncontrol over buses and responsibility for rail. \n\nThis left SPT with the subway and a rather strange assortment of other remits, including bus shelters and school \ntransport. It has been much criticised for cost overruns on the interchange between rail and underground at Partick \nStation, and  questions remain over the quality of SPT management. \n\nThe most obvious question to ask these councillors, charged with encouraging others to use public transport, is why \nthey so conspicuously failed to take their own advice. One good thing about taking public transport is that it gives \none time to think.\n\nhere s a question: is  Barclays  \u00a311.6bn annual profit good or bad news? Answer: both. On the plus side, it should \ngenerate a Barclays cheque for \u00a3225m made out to the Treasury to pay the one-off 50% levy on bonuses \nexceeding \u00a325,000. In turn, this suggests Chancellor Alistair Darling s estimate of a total take of \u00a3550m from this \nwindfall tax was uncharacteristically conservative. Good news for taxpayers. Secondly, yesterday s figures show \nthat the bank s capital cushion of rainy day money is in a much healthier state than a year ago.\n\nOn the downside, most people  will regard the news that Barclays  22,000 investment bankers will enjoy an average \n\u00a395,000 each in annual bonuses as profoundly bad news.  Plus ca change?\n\nWhere is the justice when reckless bankers are largely to blame for the global recession that has dealt misery and \nunemployment to so many? To rub salt in the wound of Joe Public, the inflated profits from Barclays  investment \nbanking arm, BarCap, are largely the result of the economic climate created by government rescue packages. \n\nThough Barclays chose not to take a bailout from the UK Treasury, its share price was in the doldrums and it was \npart of the concordat on interbank lending that kept the global banking system going last January. Also, with rock-\nbottom bank lending rates and much of the previous competition uprooted or pruned back, it has rarely been easier \nto generate fat profits.\n\nThe facts that CEO John Varley will once again manage to get by on his basic annual salary of \u00a31m or so and some \nof the investment bankers  bonuses are deferred are hardly relevant. What is to stop the conditions that created the \ncurrent recession recurring? Precious little. \n\n\n\nBarclays  stated ambition is to become the world s biggest investment bank. If such a bank foundered, what is to \nprevent it doing to the UK economy what Icesave did to Iceland? Mr Varley strove last week to convince the \nTreasury Select Committee that big banks are no riskier than little ones. But the potential burden on the taxpayer of \nsaving the former is unsustainable, while the failure of a small bank would not threaten the entire banking system. \n\nIt is also time to reconsider the  issue of banking structures. In the  19th and early 20th centuries, bankers and \nbrokers were often indistinguishable, facilitating the sort of uncontrolled speculation that resulted in the Great \nDepression. \n\nLast month US President Barack Obama suggested reinstating parts of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act that separated \ncommercial and investment banking. To date in Britain, only the Liberal Democrats have supported the idea. There \nare big issues to consider. Would plain  vanilla  banking attract the investors it would need? \n\nHow would taxpayers retrieve the stakes they were obliged to take in UK banks? Would old-fashioned banking \nmean the return of old-fashioned queues for mortgages and other loans? \n\nThese are big considerations but, as the LibDem peer Lord Oakeshott observed yesterday:  British taxpayers are \ninsuring a boy racer in a Ferrari when it should be just a careful driver in a family saloon. \n\nPatricia Routledge, actress, 81; Baroness (Ruth) Rendell of Babergh, crime novelist, 80; Barry Humphries, alias \nDame Edna Everage, 76; Julia McKenzie, actress, 69; Rene Russo, pictured, actress, 56; Lou Diamond Phillips, \nactor, 48; Michael Jordan, basketball great, 47; Michael Bay, film director and producer, 45.\n\nI read with some puzzlement what purports to be a reasoned argument  from Labour s health spokesman, Dr \nRichard Simpson (Letters, February 15) on the proposed minimum pricing  for alcohol. \n\nFirst, we have a series of selective quotations from health professionals  all supporting minimum pricing, yet all,  in \nDr Simpson s view, undermining their own arguments. \n\nOne wonders why the entire health lobby is so supportive of minimum  pricing. Is it part of the evil teetotal  world \nconspiracy or could it just be that they have looked at the evidence and made up their minds overwhelmingly on \nthat evidence? \n\nDr Simpson then bangs the drum for  effective measures  while carefully proposing precisely none. \n\nAnd what is one of those measures? It is price. The very measure which he has repudiated in his opening. \n\nLet us reiterate once again: minimum pricing may not be ideal or, indeed, the sole method by which alcohol \nconsumption can be regulated but it is the only one within the power of the Scottish Parliament. \n\nDr Simpson s only proposals seem to be a continuation of the policies that have led us to our current mess.\n\nIt is these incoherent mumblings of  the  make me pure but not yet  sort  that would have a barman sternly  pouring \nDr Simpson into the street at closing time. \n\nHugh Andrew,\n\n10 Newington Road, Edinburgh.\n\nThere will be an attempt this week on the world record for stealing mobile phones. The Mobile World Congress is \nbeing held in Barcelona and thieves will be working round the clock to relieve delegates of their iPhones   indeed \nany phones.\n\nSerious efforts will also be made to separate the 50,000 visitors of wallets, money clips, laptops, suitcases and \nanything that isn t nailed down. There is a legend that if you drink from the Canaletes fountain on Las Ramblas you \nwill always return to Barcelona. The new version is that once you have been robbed more than half a dozen times \nyou will definitely give the Catalan capital a miss.\n\n\n\nThieves, pickpockets and muggers form a long queue to predate upon guiris, which is the local name for tourists. \nThey wait for you on the train from the airport and on the metro. \n\nBarcelona is a centre of excellence for train robbers. I escaped this week s attempt on  my pockets. A bruiser with \nan array of chib marks tried to corral me against the metro carriage door. His wee pal approached, with a plastic \nshopping bag covering his hand to disguise his planned dexterous emptying of my pockets.\n\nI managed to scarper before they could jostle me when the train stopped at the next station. In Barcelona, when \nyou ve been jostled, it s a fair chance you ve been pickpocketed.\n\nLater, walking down the main street of my own quiet and safe barrio, I was stopped by a bloke who held out a euro \nand requested change for the phone. I gave him the change. He buggered off without giving me the euro. Mugged \nfor less than  a quid.\n\nThere are many scams of which the most outrageous is to pull down a guiri s shorts, take advantage of the \nconfusion and make off with his wallet. \n\nBarcelona city council seems impervious to the visitors  misery. It is a horrible feeling to be robbed. It is worse to \nsee children in tears after father has been rooked of credit cards and holiday money. Sadly, there is not a lot you \ncan do against Barcelona s thieves. They will get you eventually.\n\nOne risk is avoidable: don t sit down for a coffee or beer on Las Ramblas. \n\nThe caf\u00e9s are more efficient robbers than the pickpockets.\n\nThe headline on your editorial ( Public sector must share the pain , February 15) is part of a widespread call from \nthe three main political parties and others to ensure that ordinary public sector workers pay for a financial crisis not \nof their making. \n\nMy union rejects any suggestion that public sector workers should pay for this crisis. The Public and Commercial \nServices Union (PCS) has consistently pointed out that tax avoidance, both legal and illegal, amounts to as much \nas \u00a3120bn per year. If New Labour focused its energies on closing tax loopholes and allowing staff in the Inland \nRevenue to pursue fat-cats for these sums instead of cutting jobs in HMRC, this would go a long way to solving the \nnation s financial problems.\n\nPCS members have already suffered significantly under New Labour, with 80,000 jobs shed in the civil service, \ndamaging public services in the process , and pay rates have fallen alarmingly. \n\nOne in five PCS members earns less than \u00a315,000 and last year many government departments were forced to \nincrease staff wages in order to comply with minimum wage legislation. \n\nThere are plans to freeze pay and intensify the pain further. Civil servants carry out vital public work and another \nround of job losses will damage services, particularly for pensioners, the sick and disabled.\n\nOf course we could all make different choices. Figures published recently showed the gap between rich and poor at \nits widest since 1945. This government could take real action by levying meaningful taxes on the wealthy who have \nenjoyed a bonanza since New Labour came to power. It could also bring an end to the damaging and expensive \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and cancel the planned renewal of the Trident missiles. \n\nIf these choices were made, and the fat-cats were pursued for their unpaid taxes, then the public finances of UK \nPLC would be radically different.\n\nGerry McMahon,\n\nAssistant Secretary, \n\nPCS DWP Glasgow North Branch,\n\n\n\nGranite House, 4th Floor,  31 Stockwell Street, Glasgow.\n\nIn many ways, J S Morrison s letter ( Cuts illustrate the levels of over- manning , February 16) raises a number of \npertinent points. What is not clear from the present round of cuts is how many of those leaving are in jobs that have \nvanished and how many of those leaving are deemed to be no longer fit for purpose.\n\nEvery effort should be made to retain staff whose raison d etre is public service. Where it exists, the attitude  If you \ndo not like the service, then tough  must be eradicated. I would suggest that council officers who cannot come to \nterms with being public servants should be invited to seek new challenges.\n\nHopefully, after this round of cuts the quality of the services provided by local authorities will improve year on year. \n\nIt is not the number of workers but the quality of the staff that determines the level of service.\n\nThomas L Inglis,\n\n7 Menzies Avenue, Fintry.\n\nAccording to Archbishop Mario  Conti ( Conti speaks out against Margo MacDonald s assisted suicide Bill ,  \nheraldscotland.com, February 15), assisted suicide should remain a criminal offence  as  the good of society \ndemands that it be not changed  . \n\nI do not understand what good to society would result in the refusal of an individual s request for assisted suicide \nwithin a strict legal framework. \n\nThe archbishop contends that Ms MacDonald s assisted suicide Bill is wrong  in principle. It may well be wrong in \nhis opinion. I am sure the Abortion Act  was wrong in principle to him. We do, however, have a well-established \nlegal abortion framework which works with little, if any, abuse. \n\nWhy should a similar legal framework  for assisted suicide not function equally well for those individuals who may \nchoose to use it?\n\nNone of us can be guaranteed  as a right  a dignified death, as the daily toll of war, illness, murders, road traffic \naccidents and natural disasters attest to. \n\nSurely, for the good of society, we should have the right to a life with dignity as defined by the individual. \n\nWe should have the personal choice  to have our life terminated by assisted means when we know that our destiny \nis to live a life that would be physically tortuous and undignified. \n\nMost of us know at what stage we personally would rather be dead than live an inhumane existence. \n\nThe archbishop used the old phrase:  Hard cases make bad law.  \n\nI would argue that it s not the hard cases that make bad law   rather, it s the lack of reasoning, logic and context in \nwhich the legal decisions/norms/principles/rules were arrived at. Another old phrase springs to mind:  The law is an \nass. \n\nTeresa Crawford,\n\n131 Shuna Street, Glasgow.\n\nParis police say the daughter of Kiev s mayor was robbed of \u00a34m worth of jewellery as she travelled to Paris \nCharles de Gaulle Airport.\n\n\n\nAn official with the Paris police says a man broke into the luxury car that Kristina Chernovetska was in as it stopped \non a highway north of Paris and then stole her purse. The official says Ms Chernovetska reported the Monday \nincident to police and said the bag contained the valuable rings and earrings.\n\nThe police official was not authorised to be named, according to police policy.\n\nThe Ukrainian embassy was contacted by French police about the incident but neither the embassy nor Kiev office \nof mayor Leonid Chernovetsky would comment on the situation.\n\nHow many of us have not made an error of judgment, even when we believed we had carefully considered all the \nrelevant factors? How many of our political leaders have done this, and continue to do it, to the detriment of their \nconstituents? How many of our Westminster MPs have made these errors intentionally and benefited financially \nfrom their acts? \n\nWe are still suffering from the errors of judgment made by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. How many of our MSPs in \nthe opposition benches have done such a good job at Holyrood as Nicola Sturgeon? Your columnist Brian Currie \ncorrectly states that it is time to move on ( Sturgeon s mistake: it is time to move on , The Herald, February 16).\n\nIt seems Ms Sturgeon feels she has made a mistake with her letter in regard of Abdul Rauf, and, after Holyrood \nreconvenes, I expect she will admit it was an error of judgment she will remember and regret for the rest of her life.\n\nI am sure she has learned her lesson and that her future actions will be very carefully assessed prior to \nimplementation. However, she does not require to resign from her post as either Deputy First Minister or Health \nSecretary. \n\nPerhaps politicians at all levels of government should learn from this and ensure such lapses become a rarity.\n\nIan F M Saint-Yves,\n\nDunvegan, School Brae, Whiting Bay, Arran.\n\nIn his letter (February 16), Brian Fitzpatrick he states:  Ms Sturgeon provided [Mr Rauf] with a character reference, \nand urged a particular disposal on the sheriff: a non-custodial sentence. \n\nI have read Ms Sturgeon s letter several times, as helpfully published in full by The Herald. I can find no sign of a \ncharacter reference, only a brief description of Mr Rauf s poor health and family situation. Nor is there any evidence \nof urging a non-custodial sentence, only a polite request to consider alternatives, as the sheriff is presumably bound \nto do in any case. \n\nThis is clearly a trivial matter blown  out of all proportion by the opposition parties desperate to capture the scalp of \na highly successful government minister. As Brian Currie suggests in his column, it is now time to move on.\n\nBy the way, is this the same Brian Fitzpatrick who is a leading member of the Scottish Labour Party and the \nparliamentary candidate for Strathkelvin and Bearsden in the forthcoming election? Perhaps he was too modest to \nmention this when signing his letter.\n\nIain A D Mann,\n\n7 Kelvin Court, Glasgow.\n\nIT IS time we moved on and considered for a change all the good deeds done by the hard-working Deputy First \nMinister. For the past two weeks, Nicola Sturgeon has been castigated by the press, lawyers and others.

Should she go, it will be a major loss to the NHS.\n\nDonald J Morrison, \n\n\n\n20 Haig Street, Portknockie, Buckie.\n\nOne had thought that the attacks on Nicola Sturgeon were over until the letter from advocate Brian Fitzpatrick. This \nis surely not the same Brian Fitzpatrick who is a former failed Labour Party candidate.\n\nMarion Anderson,\n\nStation Road, Langbank.\n\nFar from being a sign of recovery and a cause for celebration, reports of house price rises should act as a warning \nfor the problems yet to come ( Housing market begins recovery , The Herald, February 16).\n\nWhile many homeowners may welcome an apparent boost to their property values, they may find it increasingly \ndifficult to realise any benefit. Taken alongside stagnating wages, increasing unemployment and a collapse in \nhouse-building, price rises are an indication of housing scarcity, rather than recovery.\n\nLow interest rates and lender forbearance are only temporary measures. Without proper leadership, Scotland and \nBritain will sleepwalk into a second wave of repossessions and evictions, and sow the seeds of the next boom and \nbust cycle. \n\nAs we look towards the General Election, politicians of all parties must be challenged on how they will deliver the \nrecovery we need, rather than the recovery we are getting. A bolder vision for an equitable housing market is \nneeded: one that lets people choose an affordable home to rent, supports first-time buyers into sustainable \nhomeownership and views housing as a place to live rather than an investment.\n\nGraeme Brown,\n\nDirector, Shelter Scotland,\n\n6 South Charlotte Street, Edinburgh.\n\nWhat a contrast in two items in The Herald (February 15). One young man is, rightly, applauded by Ron Ferguson ( \nDevil s in the detail on keeping the Sabbath ) for taking a stand in defence of one of the great institutions that \npreserved family life and gave hard-working people a charter of liberty to relax and recharge for another strenuous \nweek. Euan Murray, the Scotland prop forward, has rediscovered the Sabbath rest.\n\nA pity Mr Ferguson had not taken issue with the exploitation of our bin men by forcing them to work on Sundays. \nGlasgow City Council is creating social problems instead of solving them.\n\nOn another  page, George Monbiot called for the resignation of Sir Ian Byatt as chairman of the Water Industry \nCommission for Scotland because he questioned statistics being officially advanced ( Calls for sacking of climate \nchange sceptic from water regulator board ). Are the inmates indeed taking over the asylum? \n\nAs more and more evidence comes to light of the crooked science and political pressure behind the global warming \nhysteria, men such as Mr Monbiot need to show a bit more proportion in their statements if they don t want to \ndiscredit totally their green agenda.\n\nWhen we now know of the false claims and manipulation of dubious statistics by many climate change advocates, \nwe begin to think that these apostles of green fundamentalism do not deserve our respect. Sir Ian could be \nconsidered less than competent if he did not exercise his freedom and seek all well-based views of climate change.\n\nDavid S Fraser,\n\n191 Sandyhills Road, Glasgow.\n\n\n\nI feel there is a positive picture emerging with councils close to reaching the Scottish target of 40% by the end of \nthis  year ( Councils failing on recycling target , The Herald, February 16). Your report highlights that the average \nrate across Scotland is already at 39%, with still quite a few months to go before the deadline. \n\nHowever, there is a concern regarding some of the consistently poor performing councils. It is understandable some \nisland authorities may have particular issues with dispersed populations, but it is difficult to understand why \nGlasgow performs so poorly. I can only imagine that it was a political decision by the current leadership not to invest \nin recycling and to continue to slash essential services while making money available for landfill tax fines.\n\nMags MacLaren, \n\n2 Avondale Drive, Paisley.\n\nThe jigsaw is finally coming together. With the appointment of Andrew Dixon, Creative Scotland has at last got its \nchief executive, and, by the sound of it, one with a decent pedigree and no unnecessary Scottish baggage. He is \nnot a man who will have to spend much time wondering how to fill his day. \n\nThere is a massive job to be done managing the change from the surviving component parts of Scottish Screen and \nthe Scottish Arts Council to an entirely new agency that will also incorporate the creative industries and require to \nforge meaningful partnerships with bodies as disparate as Scottish Enterprise and Cosla. It s not a task for the faint \nof heart. And, because of the blood already spilled and the assorted delays in the start date, he ll also have to deal \nwith unwelcome levels of impatience and cynicism. \n\nNevertheless, the possibilities in the new structure remain exciting. Dixon has already indicated that he sees the \nagency s role as being a rallying cry for the cultural sector in Scotland and there is currently a huge amount of \nvibrancy across all the art forms worth shouting about. But there is another piece of that jigsaw that is almost as \ncrucial and mustn t fall victim to the dead hand of bureaucracy. \n\nOne of the most important relationships Dixon will make is with the incoming chair of the new Creative Scotland \nboard. (The advertisements for that post, and for board members, are due within days.) \n\nHow that second major appointment is handled is vital to Dixon s success. The last thing he needs is a chair \nselected on the basis of forms tidily filled, boxes neatly ticked and a history suggesting their interest in the arts is \nmore about getting their moniker on the right letterheads or pitching for a gong than rolling up their sleeves. Yet \nthere s a danger the process normally employed to appoint to public sector boards could attract the irretrievably dull \nand repel the interestingly dynamic. \n\nWe have a system overseen by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments in Scotland (Ocpas) \ndesigned to ensure fairness, transparency and competency, and to screen out numpties and nepotism. Admirable \nambitions, but not necessarily appropriate for every appointment in every case. \n\nDixon emerged via a search that included the use of head-hunters, and arguably the same should be true of his \nchair. At the least, in tandem with self-referring applicants, there should be a trawl of other likely contenders based \non their track record, passion for the arts and likely chemistry with the chief exec. \n\nTo be brutal, the kind of person and personality required for this absolutely pivotal role is not likely to list sending for \napplication forms as his or her hobby of choice. Once identified and wooed, they can be subject to the necessary \ndue diligence and, ideally, should be part of the interview panel for the rest of the board. Ocpas has a number of \nbuilt-in safety mechanisms, one of which is the use of skilled assessors to ensure proper processes have been \nfollowed. \n\nFair enough. But there are times when the process seems to be the administrative tail wagging the dog of ambition; \nmore geared to anticipating and avoiding complaints from failed applicants than identifying originality   the corollary \nof our risk-averse culture. For instance, you might assume that any assessor would examine the interview process \nfollowing the panel s recommendation. \n\n\n\nBut no. The assessor is actually on the panel. How do you assess your own judgment objectively? \n\nWhat Creative Scotland needs is a chair with drive, charisma, strategic talent and good interpersonal skills. What it \nneeds is a board not picked to cover every possible cultural base   you can always access expertise when you need \nit   but a lean body whose members display knowledge and commitment and can leave any personal hobby horses \ntethered outside the door.

This was due \nin large part to the late completion and inadequate time for rehearsals. \n\nPuccini then revised the opera, splitting the second act into two parts and making other changes.

They are even going to court, laying \nsiege to traditional male bastions and accusing the International Olympic Committee of being  like the Taliban .\n\nThe IOC professes to encourage female participation, but a reputation for chauvinism was reinforced when they \nblocked the introduction of women s ski jumping at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\n\nA group of female jumpers took the organisers to court in a bid to have a women s event introduced, or the male \none cancelled. When they lost, they appealed, citing Canada s charter of rights and freedoms. British Columbia s \n\n\n\nSupreme Court ruled it was discriminatory and contrary to the charter, but not illegal. Then a suit in the Canadian \nSupreme Court failed, when a judge ruled the court had no jurisdiction.\n\nSo interest shown in the opening Olympic event on Friday had more than the usual edge. For the record on the K95 \nhill was held, whisper it, by a woman: American Lindsey Van. Male honour was salvaged, marginally. Only two of \nthe 51 competitors beat Van s record.\n\nOne of the prime movers in the lawsuit, Van said she was  disappointed but not surprised  by the court verdict. The \ninaugural women s world champion claims the IOC are in breach of their own charter, and characterised them as  \nlike the Taliban of the Olympics .\n\nThe IOC has made a concession, however. Women s ski jump will be included at the Winter Youth Olympic Games \nin 2012, and Innsbruck will consider full inclusion for 2014.\n\nThere were just 11 women among the 258 competitors at the first Winter Olympics in Chamonix, in 1924. An \nAustrian, Herma Planck-Sabo, won the the first women s winter gold, in figure skating. A Norwegian, Sonja Henie, \nwas eighth. She went on to win the event three times, collecting more Olympic and world titles than any other skater \never, before becoming a millionaire Hollywood film star.\n\nHenie had to go to the edge of the ice and ask her coach what to do next when she was an 11-year-old competitor \nin Chamonix in 1924. But sport granted her entry to a world in which she set an earnings benchmark that today s \nsport competitors, male or female, still struggle to match.\n\nWhen she died in 1969 she left $47.5m, worth something in excess of $370m today. That s roughly double the total \ncombined career prize money to date of the two biggest male and female sports earners: Tiger Woods, Rodger \nFederer, Serena Williams and Annika Sorenstam.\n\nHowever, serious wealth based on sport has its roots in the first Winter Games, and women s growing role in sport \ncan be charted through their participation.\n\nFifty years ago, at Squaw Valley in the US, there were 144 women among 665 athletes, and 301 from 1423 when \nthe Winter Olympics were last in Canada (Calgary, 1988). In Turin four years ago there were 960 women among \nthe 2508 entries. Total figures for Vancouver are not yet available, but with the addition of ski cross for women, they \ncould top 1000.\n\nTo grasp the scale of change, consider this: in 1906 Home Secretary Viscount Gladstone attempted to enact a bill \nin the all-male parliament, banning women from dangerous sports. It was prompted by the death of Lily Cove, a \nfemale parachutist. The notion of curbing women s sporting horizons seems preposterous today. There were some \n30,000 first-time parachute jumpers in Britain last year, of whom some 40% are believed to be female.\n\nWomen have made their mark in bullfighting and rodeo riding. Tanya Streeter   voted the world s perfect athlete   \nand Ellen MacArthur have surpassed men in free diving (without oxygen) and endurance sailing respectively, and \nwhen Paula Radcliffe set the women s world best in the marathon, she was faster than any UK male all that year.\n\nJane Couch won five world boxing titles, but only after beating the British Boxing Board of Control in a restraint of \ntrade action. And Muriel Naughton, first woman to ride over National Hunt fences, used the Equal Opportunities Act.\n\nRecent British teams have drawn close to parity of the sexes, something inconceivable even 20 years ago. The 51-\nstrong British Olympic team in Vancouver contains 24 women, 28 of the 60-strong GB athletics team at last year s \nworld championships in Berlin were female, and 17 out of 40 at the last world swimming championships, in Rome.\n\nScotland s three recent highest ranked athletes are female: Steph Twell, Elidh Child and Lee McConnell. They \nwere all in the Berlin team, but there were no Scottish men.\n\n\n\nThree of the major Glasgow Sportsperson of the Year awards went to women: Sportsperson of the year Catriona \nMatthew   first Scottish woman to win a golf major   young sports person Kirsty Gilmour (badminton) and student \nathlete Laura Bartlett (hockey).\n\nYet the nation s sport pages reflect a huge bias towards towards male sport. We re happy to make this small \ncontribution to balancing the account.\n\nVan claims the IOC are in breach of their own charter and characterised them as  like the Taliban of the Olympics \n\nVatican putting wartime archives on Internet  Eds: UPDATES with details, background, ADDs byline.  By VICTOR \nL. SIMPSON, Associated Press Writer  VATICAN CITY (AP) - The Vatican plans to make some of its World War II \narchives available on the Internet soon to calm down the controversy over Pope Pius XII's actions during the \nHolocaust.  The Vatican's newspaper announced the plan, saying it will \"render service to the historic truth,\" and \nofficials said Tuesday the material will be accessible soon.  However a panel of Jewish and Catholic scholars who \nexamined the 11 volumes of material a decade ago concluded that more information was required to decide \nwhether Pius did everything he could to head off the Nazis' efforts to exterminate European Jews.  Some Jews and \nothers contend Pius should have done more, and are angered by Pope Benedict XVI's recent decision to move \nPius closer to sainthood.  The Vatican's daily newspaper L'Osservatore Romano said Gary Krup, an American who \nheads the Pave the Way Foundation, which seeks to strengthen Catholic-Jewish relations, was behind the online \ninitiative. It quoted him as saying that the Pius XII papacy \"has become a source of friction.\"  Benedict sparked \nrenewed outrage among Jewish groups in December when he signed a decree on Pius' heroic virtues, paving the \nway for him to be beatified once a miracle attributed to his intercession is confirmed.  During a visit to Rome's main \nsynagogue last month, Benedict didn't mention Pius by name but said the Vatican \"itself provided assistance, often \nin a hidden and discreet way\" to Jews during the war. Benedict said Catholics acted courageously to save Jews \nduring World War II.  The panel of Catholic and Jewish scholars that examined the material said it suspended its \nwork because the Vatican had not released all of its archives from the World War II years.  The Vatican has said \nthose archives won't be catalogued and ready until 2014 at the earliest.\n\nAdviser to Americans admits link to Salvador case  Eds: RECAPS previous. For global distribution.  AP Photo \nXLAT101  By BEN FOX, Associated Press Writer  SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) - The former legal \nadviser to a group of American missionaries jailed in Haiti on child kidnapping charges is now the focus of a \nmanhunt in the Dominican Republic.  Dominican police and U.S. agents are seeking to detain Jorge Puello, who \nacknowledged Monday that he is wanted in El Salvador for alleged involvement in a human smuggling ring in the \nCentral American country.  In a call from an unknown location, Puello told The Associated Press he was innocent of \nthe accusations and that he and his Salvadoran wife had taken in young women from the Caribbean and Central \nAmerica who had been abandoned by smugglers.  Salvadoran authorities want to prosecute Puello and his jailed \nwife for allegedly luring women and girls into prostitution with bogus offers of modeling jobs.  \"I'm planning to go to \nEl Salvador to tackle this problem,\" Puello said in a phone call arranged by his mother at his childhood home in the \nDominican Republic. \"I am not afraid to face the music.\"  Each new detail emerging about the past of the 32-year-\nold seems to add to the embarrassment and discomfort of the American missionaries that Puello volunteered to \nhelp, and who are still awaiting release from a Port-au-Prince jail.  On Monday, a Haitian prosecutor said a power \noutage delayed his printing of a recommendation to release the 10 Americans charged with child kidnapping. \nBecause Tuesday is a national holiday, he doesn't expect the judge to issue a decision until Wednesday morning.  \nIn the phone call with the AP, Puello said he had fled the Dominican Republic to avoid arrest.  The Dominican \nNational Police, working with Interpol, said it had conducted several raids and interviews Monday in an attempt to \nlocate Puello and detain him on the Salvadoran warrant.  U.S. federal agents also went to his mother's house over \nthe weekend. Dave Oney, a Marshals Service spokesman in Washington, said authorities are trying to determine if \nPuello is a man with a similar name and physical description wanted for a 2002 parole violation.  Puello's statement \nthat he had left the Dominican Republic was immediately cast in doubt by his mother, Ana Rita Puello, who refused \nto vouch for her son's whereabouts.  Informed that Puello said he had left the country, she looked surprised. Asked \nif she believed he fled, she shook her head and smiled.  \"I don't want to answer,\" she said.  Puello's recent \nbehavior has only stoked doubts about his identity and other aspects of his life.  He falsely portrayed himself as a \nlawyer in the Dominican Republic. He wrongly claimed to be the leader of the country's Sephardic Jewish \ncommunity. And he initially told reporters he had never been to El Salvador, but now says he has deep connections \n\n\n\nto the Central American country, including five children there.  Arrest warrants identify him as Jorge Anibal Torres \nPuello. Around Santo Domingo he was also known as Jorge Torres, Yoram Torres and Jorge Migdal.  The \nAmericans in Haiti, detained for allegedly trying to take 33 children out of the country without proper documents \nafter the earthquake, knew him as Jorge Puello.  Puello says his role in the case is as a misunderstood do-gooder \nwho volunteered to help the detained Americans after reading about their case on the Internet.  \"If you see \nsomebody dying and you can help you can't just not help because you have a past,\" he said. \"I have been helping \npeople since I was a kid.\"  Born in Yonkers, New York, Puello spent his early childhood years in the Dominican \nRepublic and Puerto Rico after his parents divorced, according to his mother, a 49-year-old activist with a small \npolitical party and the operator of a preschool at the family home.  Later, Ana Puello married Franco Cerminara, a \nbusinessman from Italy, and they moved to South Florida.  \"That's when Jorge began to go wrong,\" said \nCerminara, now retired.  The couple showed a photo of a young Jorge in a starched white military academy uniform \nin the Dominican Republic. But as a 15-year-old in Miami, they said, he began dating a stripper, who was a single \nmother and 10 years older than him. He soon left home for Philadelphia, where Cerminara said he was convicted of \nbank fraud and later moved to Puerto Rico to work as a hotel receptionist.  At some point, he apparently served in \nthe U.S. military. A family photo shows him in fatigues standing next to two Army trucks. Puello said he served in \nthe Army from 1996-2000 but gave no further details.  About four years ago, he emerged in Santo Domingo saying \nhe wanted to establish a Sephardic Jewish community. Cerminara and Ana Puello said everyone in their family is \nCatholic and that Jorge Puello converted on his own. \"He is Jewish by conviction,\" she said. \"He practices the \nreligion and believes it in his heart.\"  The Dominican Republic is home to about 50 Jewish families, a tightly knit and \nlow-key community that includes Sephardim and Ashkenazim, and some had doubts about the new arrival, said \nIsaac Lalo, secretary of the Centro Israelita de Republica Dominicana, the main synagogue.  Jorge Puello began \nidentifying himself as the \"newly elected president of the Jewish Communities of Dominican Republic\" in a Jewish \nnewsletter and elsewhere even though he was never elected to any such role and had no congregation.  \"This guy \nhas nothing to do with our community,\" Lalo said. \"Sephardic Jews don't just set up a community out of the blue.\"  \nPuello at some point moved to El Salvador with his Salvadoran wife, Ana Josefa Galvarina, who is jailed in El \nSalvador. He said that he ran a business converting cars to run on propane gas.  He said in the interview that he \nand his wife took in young women abandoned by smugglers, with the cooperation of the immigration ministry, but \nthat the migrants tired of the house rules and he dropped them off at a bus station with money for a ticket home.  \nHe said they told police they had been trafficked by Puello to punish him. \"They made it all up,\" Puello said of his \naccusers. He says he's eager to go back and fight the charges and join his children, now staying with their \ngrandmother.  It was his Salvadoran lawyer, he said, who told him to leave the country and avoid arrest. \"He said \nnot to get in trouble right now, not to get arrested until he can fix everything.\"  ---  Associated Press writers Dionisio \nSoldevila in Santo Domingo and Mike Melia in San Juan, Puerto Rico contributed to this report.\n\nTHE main development bank for Latin America says the January 12 earthquake that ravaged Haiti might have \ncaused $14 billion (\u00a39bn) in damage.\n\nThe preliminary study released yesterday says the earthquake could be the deadliest and costliest disaster on a list \nthat dates back four decades.\n\nEconomists with the Inter-American Development Bank used figures including death-toll estimates of 200,000 to \n250,000 to calculate that damage could be worth anywhere from $7.2bn to $13.9bn, figures higher than the country \ns gross domestic product.\n\nThe authors also warn that in past disasters, personal wealth remained 30% lower 10 years after the events even \nwith large amounts of international aid.\n\nMeanwhile, a Haitian judge has said he will deepen his inquiry into the actions of 10 American missionaries \naccused of kidnapping children following media reports that a legal adviser working with them was under \ninvestigation in El Salvador for suspected human trafficking.\n\nThe questions surrounding Dominican Republic national Jorge Puello appeared to be complicating the case against \nthe Americans, despite initial indications they would be freed.\n\n\n\nEl Salvador authorities are reportedly investigating whether Puello is the same person suspected of running a \ntrafficking ring that recruited women and girls and forced them to work as prostitutes.

The scan also \nrevealed the broken leg. \n\nTutankhamun, who became pharaoh at the age of 10 in 1333BC, ruled for just nine years at a pivotal time in Egypt \ns history. \n\nIt is believed his father was Akhenaten, the pharaoh who tried to revolutionise ancient Egyptian religion to worship \none god   while his mother was a  sister of Akhenaten.\n\nThe newest CAT scans and DNA tests revealed a pharaoh weakened by congenital illnesses who died after \ncomplications from the broken leg aggravated by severe brain malaria. The team said it isolated DNA of the malaria \nparasite   the oldest such discovery.\n\nIn an article published by the study team in the American Medical Association, the researchers said:  A sudden leg \nfracture possibly introduced by a fall might have resulted in a life-threatening condition when a malaria infection \noccurred.\n\n Tutankhamun had multiple disorders.

AP\n\nAFGHAN and US forces yesterday traded gunfire with insurgents shooting from haystacks in poppy fields as Nato \nforces progressed against increasingly fitful resistance in the Taliban stronghold of Marjah.\n\nInsurgents tried but failed to bring down an aircraft with rocket-propelled grenades as attack helicopters fired \nmissiles at enemy positions, including a machine gun bunker. \n\nMarines and Afghan troops, who pushed through four days of sniper fire and homemade bombs, finally linked up \nwith units that had been airdropped into the town in the first hours of the offensive.\n\nThree more Afghan civilians were killed in the assault, Nato forces said.\n\nThe deaths   in two separate incidents   come after two errant US missiles struck a house on the outskirts of Marjah \non Sunday, killing 12 people, half of them children. Afghan officials said three Taliban fighters were in the house at \nthe time of the attack.\n\nIn the first of two fatal incidents yesterday, Afghan men came toward Nato forces and ignored shouts and hand \nsignals to stop, Nato said. Troops opened fire and killed them. The third death occurred after two Afghan men were \ncaught in the crossfire between insurgents and Nato forces. Both were wounded but one survived and received \nmedical treatment.\n\nAbout 15,000 Nato and Afghan troops are taking part in Operation Moshtarak, the massive offensive around \nMarjah.

We re not seeing co-\nordinated attacks like we did originally,  said spokesman Captain Abraham Sipe.  We re still getting small-arms fire \nbut it s sporadic, and hit-and-run tactics.  \n\nHowever, a Taliban spokesman claimed that insurgents retained control of the town and coalition forces  \ndescended from helicopters in limited areas of Marjah and now are under siege .\n\nUS forces continued with house-to-house searches, removing bombs and booby-traps as they moved through town. \nInside some compounds squads found small doses of heroin, a Taliban photo album with fighters posing with AK-\n47s, and large propaganda wall paintings of insurgents shooting down helicopters.\n\nAs the Nato offensive aims to break the Taliban influence in southern Afghanistan, the militant group received \nanother blow with the news of its top military commander s arrest in Pakistan.\n\nMullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the group s No. 2 leader behind Afghan Taliban founder Mullah Mohammad Omar \nand a close associate of Osama bin Laden, was captured in the port city of Karachi.

That s quite a coup for the GFF, given it s the first film in five years from the \nman who charmed the world with his wonderfully quirky 2001 romantic comedy, Amelie. That film, of course, \npropelled not only Jeunet but also his gamine star, Audrey Tautou, to international fame. It was, however, Jeunet s \nfeature debut, the post-apocalyptic comedy Delicatessen, made way back in 1991, that originally made cinema-\ngoers  sit up and pay attention to this gloriously inventive filmmaker. \n\nSpeaking in advance of his expected appearance at the GFF s opening night gala, Jeunet, 56, tries to clarify the \ntricky to translate the title of his new film thus:  It s hard to explain, but, depending on context, it means a mixture, a \nmish-mash, but it is also a little bit shady. You know   underhand, intrigue, scheming, like a shady concoction. But it \ns always used in a humorous way. \n\nThe exact meaning of the title might remain elusive, but mish-mash is quite a good way to describe the film, which \nJeunet has peppered with references to the old movies and classic cartoons that have inspired all of his films. The \nBogart and Bacall film noir The Big Sleep is in there, as are Disney s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Jeunet \nalso invokes his own films, recreating the memorable saw-and-cello musical duet from Delicatessen and splicing in \na blink-and-you ll-miss-it appearance from Tautou in Micmacs  final moments. Micmacs comes across like a \nhomage to both Delicatessen and Amelie, something which will, no doubt, prove to be a particular delight to Jeunet \ns legions of fans.\n\n Yes that s true,  Jeunet says in response to the suggestion that Micmacs recalls his first film and his most popular \none.  I suppose because Guillaume [Laurant, Jeunet s regular co-writer] and I approach each subject in the same \nway, by filling up this box with our own experiences and locations and things we loved as kids and characters and \nnotions. Our projects might always overlap a bit, because they come from within. \n\nJeunet first had the idea to make a film about weapons dealers back in 1995 when he was editing his second film, \nthe dark Dickensian fantasy The City of Lost Children. Finding himself sitting in a restaurant one lunchtime next to \na group of pleasant, smartly-dressed engineers from a nearby arms firm, Jeunet couldn t help thinking of all of the \npain and suffering they were responsible for.  They all claim to work in the defence department,  Jeunet says,  and \nnot, as I say, the attack department, which is an incredible way to keep their conscience clear. But even though \nthese men, this industry, intrigued me, I wanted to make a comedy, and so the story of this gang of scavengers \nagainst the businessmen of death appealed to me. \n\nMicmacs  scavengers are seven oddballs who live in a cave built from rubbish on a Paris garbage dump. Their \nnames, Calculator, Elastic Girl, etc, describe a special ability each is endowed with, and this motley crew is led into \nbattle against the killer barons by the film s hero, a hobo named Bazil, whose father was killed by a mine built by \none of the arms firms and in whose brain is lodged a bullet made by the other. Intent on making the chairmen of the \n\n\n\nfirms pay for what happened to him and his father, Bazil sets about playing a series of pranks on each aimed at \nprovoking them to declare war upon one another.\n\nJeunet initially wanted the diminutive, cherub-faced Moroccan-French actor Jamel Debbouze (who had a supporting \nrole in Amelie) to play Bazil. However, the hard-working star of Days of Glory dropped out of Micmacs shortly \nbefore shooting was due to commence, citing a need to take a break from work. So Jeunet approached the French \ncomedian, actor and writer-director Dany Boon, whose south of France-set regional comedy from 2008, Welcome \nto the Sticks, made him a huge star in his home country.  Although Dany is totally different from Jamel,  Jeunet \nsays,  I knew he would be perfect. As soon as he put that big brown woollen jumper on, he was like a big teddy \nbear and I knew it would work. \n\nIn any event, Jeunet continues, it s not the first time he s turned a casting crisis into a golden opportunity.  The \nsame happened with Audrey [Tautou] for Amelie,  he reminds me.  Originally we wanted Emily Watson, but she \ndeclined and Audrey stepped in. Now,  Jeunet says,  who could imagine anyone else other than Audrey as \nAmelie? Luckily, fate always seems to smile on me and lead me to the right place. \n\nJeunet s not wrong there. Delicatessen and The City of Lost Children led him to Hollywood, where he was hired to \ninject some new life into the ailing Alien franchise. His Alien: Resurrection turned out to be the least memorable \ninstalment of the sci-fi/horror series, but its very mixed reception did send him straight back to France, where he \nand Laurant set to work on the film, which would later earn him five Oscar nominations.  Amelie is my favourite film,  \nJeunet says proudly.  I put my soul into that, my own life, and my own story. \n\nAfter the two films he made with Tautou, Jeunet was offered Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. This time, \nhowever, he declined to sign on to a franchise.   It was to be a lot of work and not my vision. A film takes a long time \nout of your life and you have to be totally convinced to take that journey.  Thankfully, Jeunet wasn t. If he had been, \nwe might not now have Micmacs.\n\nMicmacs premieres at Glasgow Film Theatre tomorrow. Read Alison Rowat s review in The Herald tomorrow.\n\nON stage, rehearsals have reached a crucial phase and decisions have to be made. Do the dancers want to wear \nsocks? If so, do they want black socks or white socks? Is that a voice asking for odd socks? It s not a trivial matter, \nbecause   as everyone involved in getting this new Scottish Dance Theatre (SDT) piece ready for its premiere \nknows  when an audience is on the look out for visual clues, such details can t be left to chance. Especially when it \ns a work like NQR, with its provocative exploration of  difference . \n\nNQR, by the way, is the medical acronym for Not Quite Right. And, as you might expect with a company as attuned \nto issues of dance and disability as SDT, the socks are really just a footnote. What s going to challenge the whole \nconcept of a  right  aesthetic is the presence of Marc Brew and Caroline Bowditch, both of them professional \ndancers and both of them wheelchair users. It s not, in fact, the first time that SDT has staged an integrated \ncompany piece. In 2007, they commissioned Angels of Incidence from choreographer Adam Benjamin, a co-\nfounder of the pioneering CandoCo company. The piece toured extensively as part of the company s mixed \nprogramme: this meant that  audiences who might have shied away from watching dancers in wheelchairs found \nthemselves having to adjust their preconceptions as new dynamics in partnering only became possible because \none of the performers had wheels to put in motion.\n\nBowditch was, herself, a key part of this production. At one schools workshop, in Eastleigh, a young primary pupil \nhailed her as being  this queen in a throne, with everyone wanting her to notice them   and let them ride on it with \nher . It was a gorgeous description of Bowditch and the way she can totally command a space, not because of her \nwheelchair but because of her personality, her focus and her presence. Since then, she s become part of SDT s \noutreach programme as the company s Dance Agent for Change, using her own considerable experience as a \nperformer and choreographer to encourage others   not just audiences, but people with disabilities   to think in \nterms of possibilities, not limitations.  Frankly it can be hard enough to get audiences in to see contemporary dance,  \nsays Bowditch with a decidedly cheeky grin.  They probably have an idea what ballet looks like, even if they never \ngo   but contemporary? They re not familiar with it, so why bother? And that s even before we ve got on to the bit \nabout the wheelchairs. \n\n\n\nAs for persuading other disabled folk to join in movement classes? That was yet another challenge that Bowditch \nsuccessfully confronted with customary energy and panache. As a dancer with brittle bone disease, Bowditch had \nfirst-hand knowledge of the risks involved in pushing your body in new and demanding ways. But you only have to \nsee Bowditch on stage, and in her element, to realise that dancing is her gift. \n\nFor Janet Smith, SDT s artistic director, that gift   with all its connotations of difference,  challenge, resourcefulness \nand grit  makes Bowditch and now also Marc Brew, the company s recently appointed associate director fellow, \ninvaluable as collaborators on NQR.  I love collaborations anyway,  she says.  Watching someone else s work, \nbeing part of a collaborative process   it s really a chance to see the world through someone else s eyes. And both \nMarc and Caroline are bringing so much that is fresh and new to us. Caroline has these ideas that are thrillingly \ntheatrical   but she s also wonderfully questioning about things. She ll look at something and be asking , what are \nwe showing? What are we telling here? It s keeping us out of our comfort zone   and that s true, too, of the \nexplorations we re making with Marc s movements. What he does, in a couple of the sections, is on the floor   and \nin one sense it is a limitation in terms of what the non-disabled dancers can do. But limitations are what feed \ncreativity. Instead of dancers assuming that they re going to be dashing everywhere, they re having to feel their way \ninto a different kind of physicality. Instead of the dancers with disability having to imitate movements that weren t \nreally made for them, we ve looked at things from their perspective. So sometimes it s their vocabulary that takes \nthe lead. \n\nNonetheless, with NQR, Smith and her two collaborators didn t want to make a piece that, in her words,  headlined \ndisability. We were taking on the questions about who can dance?   and those questions include issues of quality. \nDisabled dancers rarely enjoy the same advantages of professional training that non-disabled dancers can access, \nso there is always the pressure of, is it good enough? But then you have to ask, is the audience watching this in the \nway they would if the dancers weren t in wheelchairs? Or are they watching through a veil of condescension?  \n\nWith these thoughts racing through everyone s mind,  Not Quite Right  as a phrase moved away, to encompass \nsome of the everyday stuff that, as Smith laughingly points out, has us picking on all kinds of aesthetics and \ndeciding that what we see, or hear or taste, isn t just so ... it s not quite right. Cue those sock choices and canny \ncostume designs that will underscore the choreographic themes. NQR is one half of a double bill of new work that \nwill tour extensively this spring   Ben Duke s intriguing dance-theatre piece, The Life and Times of Girl A is the \nother.\n\nScottish Dance Theatre premieres both works at Dundee Rep tonight, running until Saturday.\n\nWHEN Alasdair Beatson invited violinist Pekka Kuusisto to join him in his four-concert series in Perth, the pianist \nknew exactly what he was getting into.

With five of their number \nsporting beards and checked shirts prominent, an evening of Lady GaGa-esque vaudeville pop seemed unlikely. \nThat proved true, yet Midlake s  well-crafted paeans to 60s  and 70s rock were mostly full of quality.\n\nIf their breakthrough record, The Trails of Van Occupanther, paid homage to the 70s, material from the recently \nreleased Courage of Others called to mind a folksier approach, particularly as vocalist Tim Smith spent part of the \nset seated. However, there were still flurries of hard drumming and lengthy, Led Zeppelin-styled guitar work too. \nThey were stamped all over the robust The Horn, and Young Bride was another  stand-out, taking full advantage  of \nthe drummer McKenzie  Smith and his varied, sometimes subtle, often thunderous,  playing.\n\nThere were other highlights too. The chugging Roscoe, their most well-known number, was a foot-tapping trek \nthrough Fleetwood Mac rock, but it was the exhilarating instrumental climax to Core of Nature and the strident \nChildren  of the Grounds that resonated  the most. \n\nYet while the bulk of the Courage of Others numbers were fine, they also proved somewhat similar, blending into \neach other. The group also proved prone to delving into lengthy, workmanlike jams too often, which proved that \nyou can sometimes have too much of a good thing, while their lack of showmanship also ensured it was easy for \nthe mind to wander. \n\nThe majority, however, may not have been flashy but was still effective.\n\nHHH\n\n\n\nSCOTS playwright DC Jackson (The Wall, The Ducky) has earned a reputation for producing the noughties \nequivalent of the sort of big-hearted, tweeless and very funny Caledonian comedies that made John Byrne, Liz \nLochhead, Bill Forsyth and Rab C Nesbitt creator Ian Pattison such household names. His latest play, an office \nfarce set in the unisex toilets of a company called Jiffy Corps, is no exception.\n\nThe set-up is as old as the hills   the Hollywood Hills that produced a raft of American screwball comedies from the \n1930s on, that  is.

He presents evidence dating back to the 17th century.\n\nShrink Rap\n\nMore4, 10pm\n\nA NEW series of Australian clinical psychologist Dr Pamela Stephenson s compulsive talk show kicks off with an \nencounter with Heather Mills, surely the most irritatingly self-promoting subject on earth. Mills exclusively reveals \n(huh?) details of her unhappy childhood, the accident in which she lost her left leg below the knee, and   surprise!   \nher divorce from Paul McCartney.\n\nBut perhaps we should be more sympathetic. After all, Mills s mother abandoned her when she was just nine years \nold, and died at 47. Distressing enough for anyone, but Mills and her siblings were left to cope with being brought \nup by an unpredictable and obsessive father. She becomes visibly emotional when she tells how her mother died \njust after they were briefly united. \n\nIn previous series of the  televised therapy  show Stephenson (wife of Billy Connolly) has interviewed a variety of \ninteresting (aka perplexing) personalities for the purpose of offering her expert advice, and hoping they ll go away \nbetter prepared to face the world. These include Stephen Fry, Sharon Osbourne, Sarah Ferguson, Robin Williams \nand Chris Langham. Here she valiantly attempts to explore how Mills s childhood has influenced her subsequent \nlife. She probes Mills about her sexuality and the power it has given her over men, her career as a glamour model \nand her ill-fated marriage to McCartney.\n\n\n\n As much as those who didn t know us want to dismiss it, those who were really around us know we were very, very \nin love,  Mills says.  I was pursued for quite a few months. It was very flattering. How could you say no?  Aha. So \nthe ghastly and all too public fallout from that famously ill-fated union was not her fault, then? \n\nRamsay s Kitchen  Nightmares USA\n\nChannel 4, 9pm\n\nGogsy (he of the newly line-free chin) is back for a third series of the American reality show, so he must be doing \nsomething right, even though the launch of this series was postponed due to US President Barack Obama s State \nof the Union address. \n\nIn this episode, he spends his usual week at a failing restaurant, this time in rural Whitehouse, New Jersey.

Although a \nstrong family person she always thought of others and was the first to offer assistance to any in distress or trouble. \nHer first charity work was helping to raise funds for the Western kidney unit.  \n\nSeventeen years ago, she was diagnosed with breast cancer but, due to the care she received at the Western \nBreast Care Unit and the Beatson Oncology Centre, she overcame the disease.\n\nInitially, she became a committee member of the Bearsden charity The White Lily Fund, where she assisted \nfundraising. Her desire was to give something back to the units that treated her and in March 2000 she set up \nBreast Cancer 2000. \n\nAs chairperson, she was a driving force and, next to family, it was her life. Her ambition was to donate \u00a31m to fund \nresearch into breast cancer and for patient care. Some \u00a3700,000 has been raised to date.\n\nOnly three months ago she was devastated when she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She bore the illness \nwith dignity but realised that on this occasion she would not be able to overcome the disease. Despite this, she \nremained focused on the efforts of the charity. \n\nShe is survived by her husband, Alistair, her son and daughter, and four grandchildren. \n\nMaybe Edward Thomas s observations are a little premature for this time of year, though there are some \nintimations of spring.

The government s plans were attacked by Councillor Ken Fagan, vice-\npresident of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, who claimed Mrs Thatcher and her ministers were  \nideologically obsessed  with theories of privatisation. \n\n50 YEARS AGO\n\nALTHOUGH excess demand may be avoided, it will be more difficult to keep prices stable this year, according to a \nsurvey of economic conditions in Britain published by the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation. It was \nunlikely that Britain s economy would again benefit from falling import prices. \n\nPsychiatrist; \n\nBorn November 2, 1929; Died January 4, 2010. \n\nDR JOHN Hope Henderson, who has died aged 80, was a distinguished psychiatrist and mental health pioneer. \n\nBorn in Galashiels, his secondary schooling was at Central Secondary School in Aberdeen and Melville College, \nEdinburgh. His medical training at Aberdeen University and subsequent postgraduate work led him to become both \na member (then fellow) of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and a Fellow of the Faculty of Public Health Medicine \nand the Royal College of Physicians. \n\nThroughout his career he managed to combine both perspectives, being a highly regarded psychiatrist, but also \nhaving the vision to put this in the context of mental health and wellbeing within the community. Dr Henderson s \nadoption of a holistic approach was radical. \n\n\n\nAfter completing medical training in 1955, he was sent on National Service to Kenya with the Royal Army Medical \nCorps. On his return he concentrated on his psychiatric training, spending six years in Aberdeen under the \nguidance of Prof Malcolm Miller. From 1963-69 Dr Henderson was consultant psychiatrist and physician \nsuperintendent at Bilbohall Hospital in Elgin. \n\nHe moved to a similar post at Bangour Village Hospital in Broxburn, where he contributed to the post-graduate \ntraining programme at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital. His humane approach, his wit and his broad perspective \ninfluenced and inspired many juniors.\n\nDr Henderson moved away from direct clinical practice into an advisory role, becoming principal medical officer in \nmental health at the Scottish Home and Health Department. Here he helped develop the special unit at Barlinnie \nPrison. \n\nHis expertise took him further afield as World Health Organisation regional adviser on mental health, working first in \nsouth-east Asia, based in Delhi (1976-80), then in Europe, based in Copenhagen (1980-85). \n\nHis most important work in this period was to advise on the psychiatric de-institutionalisation programme in Greece \nand Romania, following the revelation of horrendous conditions and practices, and he continued to contribute to this \nproject over the next 20 years.\n\nIn 1985, he returned to the UK as medical director at Saint Andrews Hospital, Northampton, until his retirement in \n1993. \n\nFor the next 16 years, he dedicated his life to improving the rights of the mentally ill across Europe. \n\nHe started his retirement as an active member and then president of the European Council of the World Federation \nfor Mental Health and then becoming a co-founder of Mental Health Europe, an umbrella organisation for NGOs. He \nremained active as special adviser to Mental Health Europe until a few months before his death. In Scotland, he \nchaired InterMinds, a charity helping to support organisations working with service users in developing areas, \nespecially Romania and the former Soviet Union.\n\nDr Henderson helped change the direction of public mental health in Europe, broadening the horizons away from \nillness to include anti-stigma work, suicide prevention and mental health promotion. Scotland has been commended \non its work in this direction over the past few years and he was very proud to give a presentation at the WHO \nministerial conference on mental health in 2005. \n\nThis impressive career was matched by three other passions. First, his love of sport (rugby, as  player, referee and \nfollower; mountain-climbing; and watersports). He also had a love of gardening, cooking and fine wine, and meeting \nfriends and colleagues. \n\nMost importantly he was close to his family: Toshie, his wife of 52 years, four sons, 10 grandchildren and two step-\ngrandchildren. \n\nSANDRA GRANT\n\nBRITAIN S top shares closed sharply higher yesterday as Barclays led a banking sector rally after its 2009 \nforecast-beating results while oils and miners were buoyed by firmer commodity prices. The FTSE 100 ended up \n76.59 points, or 1.5%, at 5,244.06, extending gains into a second consecutive session after closing 0.5% higher on \nMonday.\n\nBarclays was the top blue-chip riser, up 6.8%, after saying it had started the year well and beating expectations \nwith a 2009 profit of more than \u00a311.6 billion following strong performance at its investment banking unit.\n\nLloyds Banking Group rose 4.7% and Royal Bank of Scotland added 5.3%. Both are scheduled to report results \nnext week.\n\n\n\nRBS said it was selling the non-US assets of its RBS Sempra Commodities joint venture to JPMorgan for $1.7 \nbillion.\n\nHSBC and Standard Chartered also gained, they put on 1.6 and 2.5% respectively.\n\n At the moment equities are still providing a decent return compared to other instruments, which is why the market s \nstill well supported,  said Philip Gillett, sales trader at IG index.\n\n Whether or not this rally still has further to go I am not sure. I still think we are in for a sideways period. \n\nA gauge of manufacturing in New York state rose in February as inventories jumped, the New York Federal \nReserve said in a report on Tuesday.\n\nThe news added to the feel-good factor and boosted demand for commodities as prices in metals and crude oil \nsurged as the US dollar weakened.\n\nMiners Eurasian Natural Resources, Vedanta Resources, Randgold Resources and Fresnillo were among the best \noff, rising 3.9 to 5.2%.\n\nAnglo American climbed 3.8% after selling its Tarmac construction businesses in France, Germany, Poland and the \nCzech Republic to Eurovia, a unit of France s Vinci.\n\nBHP Billiton put on 3.1%, also helped by an upgrade to  buy  from ING, while Rio Tinto added 2.5%.\n\nOil and gas producers Royal Dutch Shell, BP and BG Group climbed 1.6 to 2.2%.\n\nSelected defensive stocks were lower as appetite for risk remained strong. Imperial Tobacco was among the top \nFTSE 100 fallers, dropping 1.7%, while British American Tobacco was down 0.9%.\n\nInterContinental Hotels was the biggest blue-chip faller, off 2.9% after the world s biggest hotelier said trading \nwould stay tough until business travellers returned in greater numbers.\n\nJP Morgan Chase has agreed to buy the non-US assets  of RBS Sempra Commodities for $1.7 billion (\u00a31.4bn) in \ncash in a deal that will challenge the dominance of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Barclays Capital in raw \nmaterials trading.\n\nThe New York-based invevstment bank said it would purchase RBS Sempra s global oil trading unit, its profitable \nmetal trading business and European power and gas assets. RBS Sempra Commodities will retain its North \nAmerican natural gas and power, Edinburgh-based Royal Bank said. The deal is set to be completed in the second \nquarter of the year.\n\nThe sale of RBS Sempra Commodities   a joint venture between Royal Bank of Scotland, which was rescued by the \nUK Government, and US utility group Sempra Energy   was sparked by a European Commission state-aid ruling \nlast year ordering Royal Bank to divest its stake.\n\nJP Morgan had initially considered buying the whole joint venture for about $4bn, but dropped the plan because of \nthe large overlap between RBS Sempra s business in America and its own current trading activity. On top of this, \nthe Obama administration s clampdown on banks  proprietary trading pushed JP Morgan to buy only the non-US \nactivities.\n\nThe commodities operations will become part of JP Morgan s global commodities business, which is headed by \nBlythe Masters.\n\nDEVRO, the Scottish company that makes sausage skins and other products for the food processing industry, has \nannounced sizzling preliminary results for the year that ended on December 31, 2009.\n\n\n\nThe business reported a 76% surge in pre-tax profit, as global demand for edible collagen casings grew by more \n5% in the year, particularly in the developing economies of China and Latin America.\n\n I am very pleased to report a second year of profit growth,  chairman Steve Hannam told The Herald.  The \nperformance improved throughout the year and resulted in an increase in operating profit before exceptional items \nof 33% compared to 2008. \n\nPre-tax profit surged to \u00a326.94m, from \u00a315.34m a year ago. Profit before tax and exceptional items was up 33.6% \nto \u00a325.1m from \u00a318m in the previous year. Earnings per share, before exceptional items, were 11.5p, up from 8.2p \na year earlier. Full-year revenue grew 20.4% to \u00a3220.41m from \u00a3183.13m in the previous year.\n\nIn the year, sales volumes of edible collagen casings increased by 6% year-on-year. Volumes of distributed \nproducts increased, but other products, including collagen gel, were down, the company said.\n\nThe firm has achieved price increases during the year averaging 3% on a constant currency basis.\n\nOperating profit for the year increased to \u00a329.19m from \u00a317.12m in the previous year. Operating margin improved \nto 12.4% from 11.2% reflecting increases in sales prices and the improvement in manufacturing. \n\nThe Moodiesburn-based company is a geographically diversified, solid performer. Its market has held up better than \nother consumer-focused areas and it seems to be dealing effectively with the challenges, such as rising raw \nmaterial and energy costs, that have come its way while continuing to seek out new markets.\n\nThis has driven investor enthusiasm. Its shares yesterday rose 1.5%, or 1.25p, to 150p,\n\nDevro dominates the UK market for collagen food products used in casing for sausages, salami, hams and other \ncooked meats and also owns businesses in the Czech Republic, Australia and the United States.\n\nThe company closed an old factory in the Czech Republic that was built in the 1930s and opened a more efficient \nplant, saving  about \u00a32m annually, the firm said in previous results. \n\nDevro employs about 1,000 people in the Czech Republic.It has seen strong growth in developing economies such \nas China and Latin America, where Mexico is its biggest market. The company is also in a strong position in Brazil \nand Chile. It has, however, made little headway in India where many people do not eat meat but performed well in \nJapan, Hannam stated. He said the group s two Scottish factories at Moodiesburn and Bellshill were working flat \nout to meet demand.  We have seen really good performance there,   he said.\n\nCommenting on the outlook for 2010, Peter Page, chief executive, said:  Devro s markets are resilient at a time of \neconomic uncertainty, and we view 2010 with confidence. \n\nThe board is proposing a final dividend of 3.575p, bringing the total for the year to 5p, which is 12% higher than \nlast year.\n\nCRAIG Wilson sold 356 light prime hoggs at Ayr on Monday to average 179p/kg, 779 medium weights to average \n187.2p, and 439 heavy ones to average 173.1p.\n\nFour hundred and ninety-three cast ewes averaged \u00a352.46.\n\nLawrie & Symington sold 28 dairy cattle at Lanark on Monday to a top of \u00a32080 (twice) for Holstein heifers in milk to \naverage \u00a31350.\n\nTwenty-eight prime heifers sold to 199p/kg and averaged 176.6p (+10.6p on the week). Assuming Scottish beef \ntype cattle kill out at 58% that average price equates to 304.5p/kg dead weight. To convert any of the prime cattle \nprices quoted divide them by 0.58.\n\nThe 26 prime bullocks forward sold to 184p/kg and averaged 157.8p (-0.6p).\n\n\n\nTwenty-nine beef cows sold to 153p and averaged 105p, while 66 dairy cows sold to 112p and averaged 91p. 2082 \nprime hoggs sold to 229.8p/kg and \u00a3100/head to average 189.3p (no change). 212 light ewes averaged \u00a350.43 \n(+\u00a37.13), while 196 heavy ewes averaged \u00a378.14 (+\u00a310.47).\n\nCraig Wilson sold 24 prime heifers at Ayr yesterday to average 167.1p/kg and 27 prime bullocks to average 151.9p. \n\nFifty-six dairy cows averaged 107.7p, whist 107 beef cows averaged 88.9p.\n\nWallets Marts had a plainer show of 1592 prime hoggs at Castle Douglas yesterday that sold to 213.9p and \naveraged 181p. Three hundred and seventy-four cast ewes and rams saw horned ewes especially in demand and \nsold to \u00a387 for Suffolks, \u00a383 Texels, \u00a378 Mules, \u00a376 Cheviots and \u00a370.50 for Blackfaces.\n\nFollowing Monday s successful sale of pedigree Simmental bulls it was the turn of the pedigree Charolais to go \nthrough United Auctions ring at Stirling yesterday. They sold to a top of 26,000gns and averaged \u00a36072 for 163 \nsold (+\u00a310).\n\nTHE annual pace of retail sales growth in Scotland slowed sharply from 4.3% in December to 2.8% last month   the \nworst rate recorded in any January for four years.\n\nThe 2.8% growth rate recorded by the Scottish Retail Consortium was, however, more than double the 1.2% year-\non-year increase in January in the UK as a whole. This was the first time since August last year that the year-on-\nyear pace of sales growth north of the border exceeded the UK-wide rate of increase recorded by the British Retail \nConsortium.\n\nAnnual growth in Scotland of non-food sales, the more discretionary element of spending, slowed from 3.3% in \nDecember to 0.9% last month.\n\nThe Scottish Retail Consortium said that the coldest January since 1979 ensured the clothing category had its \nstrongest month since last April, when sales were boosted by sunny weather around Easter. Winter coats, jackets, \nknitwear and warm accessories all sold well last month.\n\nHowever, there was much less interest in homewares and do-it-yourself projects.\n\nRichard Dodd, head of media at the Scottish Retail Consortium, said:  After a decent December, this is a \ndisappointing result but not a disaster. Generally, people just didn t want to go out shopping in the extreme weather \nif they didn t have to. Food sales did well early in the month as people stocked up and demand for winter wear took \nclothing to its best result since last April but there was much less interest in things like homewares and DIY. \n\nNoting the impact of the return of the VAT rate to 17.5% from the temporary 15% rate on January 1, Dodd said:  \nThe VAT increase had pulled some sales forward to December but the good news is (that) total sales in Scotland \nstill grew twice as fast as for the whole of the UK. \n\nHe added:  Customers are nervous about their own finances but Scottish retailers will be hoping January s weaker \nperformance is mainly about the weather rather than anything more fundamental. \n\nOn a like-for-like basis, which strips out the beneficial impact of expansion of space and signals how retailers are \nfaring as opposed to the state of overall consumer spending, Scottish retail sales value in January was down 0.6% \non the same month last year. This was, as with total sales, the poorest year-on-year comparison for any January for \nfour years.\n\nSTAGECOACH, whose Scottish bus operations include Highland, Bluebird, Strathtay, Fife, and West Scotland, has \nappointed a new Scottish director for its bus division.\n\nSam Greer began his career in 1984 as an apprentice mechanic with the then Scottish Bus Group.\n\n\n\nHe also worked for London Metroline and Strathclyde Buses before joining Western Scottish in 1992 as depot \nengineer.\n\nFollowing Stagecoach s takeover of Western Scottish, he was appointed engineering director of Stagecoach West \nScotland in 1997, and in 2006 became managing director.\n\nThe 41-year-oldd will take over at the beginning of May as regional director Scotland following the retirement of \nTom Wileman, and will have overall responsibility for the entire Stagecoach network, including the Scottish Citylink \njoint venture.\n\nHis appointment means he will join the Stagecoach UK Bus management team with responsibility for health and \nsafety, environment, engineering and purchasing. \n\nWileman began his career in the industry with the Scottish Bus Group in 1972.\n\nAfter joining Stagecoach in 1990, he went on to become managing director of six Stagecoach companies  around \nthe UK   including Bluebird   before being appointed to head up Scotland in 2008. \n\nWileman said after hearing of his new appointment:  I m extremely proud of the success Stagecoach has achieved \nin attracting more people on to greener, smarter bus travel. \n\nhave had jobs. They owe the UK community big time. \n\nVarley said:   As an industry, and indeed as a global economy, in the autumn of 2008, we were right on the brink \nand governments and central banks and supervisors intervened in a way that saved the system. We should never \nforget that fact. \n\n When we think about remuneration it s important that we acknowledge those things and it s clear to me that the \nbond of trust between banks and their customers and stakeholders has been damaged by the experience of the last \nthree years.\n\n So banks have to be sensitive to the issue of how they lend and they have to be sensitive to the issue of how they \npay.\n\n It s important in those circumstances, and recognising also that governments have helped the banking system as \nmuch as they have over the course of the last couple of years ... that banks and bankers show that they understand \n... and behave accordingly. \n\nVarley said Barclays had committed to lend \u00a311bn to UK businesses and households in 2009 but had lent \u00a335bn. \n\nExcluding a \u00a36.3bn gain on the sale of Barclays Global Investors to Blackrock and other one-offs, underlying profits \nmore than trebled to \u00a35.6bn, 5% ahead of analysts  expectations.\n\nBarCap increased profits 89% to \u00a32.5bn, helped by the acquisition of the US operations of Lehman investment \nbank.\n\nUK retail banking profits fell to \u00a3612m from \u00a31.369bn.\n\nUK commercial banking profits fell by 41%, to \u00a3749m, due to rising defaults and falling asset values. Barclaycard \nprofits fell by 4% to \u00a3761m.\n\nBarclays paid a 2009 dividend of 2.5p and signalled future annual payouts would be over 4.5p per share.\n\nShares in Barclays closed up 7%, 18.7p, at 293.75p.\n\nJAPAN may be renowned for an economic  lost decade  which began in the early 1990s but, when it comes to \ntechnological advancement, it continues to waste absolutely no time.\n\n\n\nSuch obsession with developing technology is obvious at the Panasonic Centre in the Tokyo Bay area and during a \nvisit to electronics giant Sony s gleaming glass-and-metal high-rise headquarters in the Japanese capital s \nShinagawa quarter.\n\nThis focus on technology is, however, as much a necessity as an obsession. Successful development of new ideas \nwill be crucial to the future of a Japanese economy which depends heavily on exports and is facing increasingly \nfierce competition from its Asian neighbours.\n\nLong established players such as Panasonic and Sony are facing intense competition these days from South \nKorean manufacturers Samsung and LG, at the top end of the flat-screen television market for example.\n\n Japan, much like Scotland, has seen this emerging excellence from South Korea in decades gone by in the \nshipbuilding sector.\n\nAll the while, China and Taiwan are producing huge quantities of cheaper, flat-screen televisions under a mind-\nboggling variety of brands. The strength of the yen against the Chinese renminbi is not helping Japan s efforts to \ncompete against China in the electronics arena.\n\nFaced with the South Korean challenge at the top end of the market, and the emergence of ever-greater price-\nbased competition from China and Taiwan, Panasonic and Sony \n\nhave no choice but to strive to continue a reputation for delivering the most advanced and reliable technology which \nJapan earned in the 1980s.\n\nJapanese car giant Toyota s recent troubles are not helpful to the reputation of the country s technology, and are \ncurrently causing some angst in this regard. Toyota has had to recall hundreds of thousands of its environmentally-\nfriendly 2010 Prius cars worldwide because of a glitch in the braking system and millions of other vehicles recently \nover problems with accelerator pedals.\n\nHowever, if anyone is tempted to think Japan is going to yield its now decades-long reputation for producing some \nof the world s finest technology without a fight, a tour of the Panasonic Centre would likely change this view.\n\nThe centre features the  future living room . You might think you ve seen it all before, and even that Disney s Epcot \ntheme-park in Florida did it decades ago but, even in today s environment in which technology advances at \nbreakneck speed, Panasonic s vision of the future is some-thing of a jaw-dropper.\n\nGuided to a seat in this future living room, a seat much like any other seat, you face a wall. A wall like any other \nwall, not surprisingly, with a television screen on it.\n\nThe female guide notes that the television is part of the wall, and not separate. At this point, things still seem fairly \nunremarkable.\n\nThen things begin to become impressive. With a wave of the arm, the screen extends across the entire wall.\n\nThere is then a demonstration of how a member of the household can operate the life wall from a distance by hand \nmovements, being recognised as a specific user and being able to choose from a personalised menu. \n\nThis might enable this person to play video which she downloaded previously, for example, or to view photo-graphs \nwhich can be uploaded from a digital camera to the  life wall  in seconds. \n\nAnother gesture at the wall brings up a bookcase showing the covers of various titles, again taking up the entire \nwall. An animal picture book is selected, and the pages turn using a touch-activated table in front of the seat.\n\nAnimals are selected using the same touch-table. \n\nAfter about half a dozen are selected, they are put in order across the entire wall by order of size, then speed, and \nfinally life span.\n\n\n\nThere is also a demonstration of instant video communication on the giant screen, with a person in another room, \nwith no time-lag and remarkable clarity. A picture of Mount Fuji is put up as a backdrop in the other room, to \nhighlight the fact that this communication could be with another user many miles away.\n\nWindows are created on the life wall to show different views, and different patterns of wallpaper are displayed with \nfurther gestures of the hand.\n\nACROSS town at Sony, the technological wizards are also trying to anticipate or even shape future lifestyles as \nthey dream up the consumer goods of the future.\n\nHoward Stringer, the first non-Japanese leader of Sony, has highlighted the raft of competition faced by the \ncompany because of its presence in a wide range of market sectors. He compares Sony with a department store.\n\nAs well as the challenges which Sony faces in the flat-screen television market, the company must compete with \nUS innovator Apple in areas such as personal computing and music. In cameras, Sony faces competition from \nmanufacturers including fellow Japanese company Canon and in the computer games market, Sony has to take on \npioneering Kyoto-based giant Nintendo.\n\nA visit to Sony s headquarters highlights the Japanese company s energetic attempts to make technology better, \nbigger or smaller depending on whether you are talking about hand-held televisions or cinema-style, high-definition \n3D images.\n\nSony is at the cutting edge of improving television coverage of baseball, an extremely popular sport in Japan, with a \n40-kilogramme  home run  camera which uses air pressure for ease of movement. It has developed HD  super-\nmotion  camera technology which takes 90 rather than the normal 30 frames per second and thus provides better \nslow-motion replays. Sony s cameras will also be used to shoot 3D footage at the forthcoming football World Cup in \nSouth Africa this summer.\n\nSony also makes movie cameras, for George Lucas of Star Wars fame among others.\n\nIts cameras are also used to record operations in medical theatres, albeit with a few adaptations. The light on the \ncamera which shows filming is in progress must not be the conventional red colour, so it is not confused with a \ndeveloping emergency during an opera-tion. The television screen and the controls around it have been adapted to \nensure an entirely flat surface which can be wiped clean easily. \n\nSony has developed a line speaker, a transparent cylinder with what looks like a wire or string, to ensure the quality \nof sound is the same regardless of your position in a room, although these do not come cheap. And its  4K  cinema \nprojection offers a picture with five times the number of pixels which are in full HD technology on new television \nsets, at 4096 x 2160 instead of 1920 x 1080.\n\nHowever, it is not only in the electronics sector that tomorrow s world is being pursued today. Japan has been at \nthe forefront of emerging green energy technology.\n\nThe Tostem Housing Research Institute s  eco house  on the outskirts of Tokyo boasts zero carbon dioxide \nemissions and features solar-panel power and an electric car in the garage. \n\nTostem, which plans in time to roll out such homes across Japan through a franchise system, is even proposing \nthat the electric car will eventually double as the battery which stores energy for the house during periods of peak \nsunlight.\n\nThis model home is branded  Eyeful    a name which is aimed at portraying transparency of pricing.\n\nThe house combines the ancient and modern aspects of Japanese culture. It features a Japanese tea ceremony \nroom but also a small desk space just off the kitchen which might enable a person preparing a meal to check a \nrecipe online.\n\n\n\nJapan knows it must adapt to survive in the new world economic order in which it has to deal with the inevitability of \nbeing overtaken by China as the world s second largest economy. The challenges ahead are significant.\n\nBut the slew of innovation such as that which can be seen from a whistlestop tour of Panasonic, Sony, and Tostem \nwill be vital to Japan s efforts to maintain its reputation as a technological leader in the face of intensifying \ncompetition. So will a turnaround by Toyota.\n\n  \n\n  \n\nTHREE Turkish oil company executives have been fined \u00a31.16 million for insider dealing in shares of London-listed \nHeritage Oil, the Financial Services Authority said. Genel Enerji chief executive Mehmet Sepil was fined \u00a3967,005   \nthe largest fine handed to an individual for market abuse.\n\nCORPORATE governance at Optos, the Scottish eye-care group, has come under fire from watchdog Pirc for the \nfourth successive year, writes Simon Bain.\n\nPirc has refreshed previous concerns about remuneration, director independence and a \u00a3560,000 pay-off to former \nchief executive Thomas Butts, ahead of the company s annual meeting.\n\nPirc says Optos s performance share plan has only one performance measure, encouraging undue focus on one \naspect of performance; the vesting targets are not sufficiently challenging; and there is a  risk of excessive \npayments being made for average or indeed below average performance .\n\nIt also notes no disclosed requirement for executive directors to build up a shareholding in the company.\n\nPirc says two directors are entitled to full vesting of share awards before any change of control, subject to targets in \nservice agree-ments being met, and the payment to Butts amounted to 165% of his 2008 salary,  far in excess of \nour view of best practice of one year's salary and benefits .\n\nIt says non-executives Anne Glover and Patrick Paul together own 26.5% of the shares, which means the board \nmay not safeguard all shareholders.\n\nOptos has said it main-tains high levels of com-pliance through accurate disclosure, and the non-executives in \nquestion are regarded as independent.\n\nANNUAL UK consumer prices index inflation surged from 2.9% in December to 3.5% in January   forcing Bank of \nEngland Governor Mervyn King to write an explanatory letter to the Chancellor.\n\nKing told Alistair Darling that the Bank s latest inflation report  suggests that the underlying pressures are on the \ndownside .\n\nAnd the Bank Governor attributed the pick-up in inflation to the return of the VAT rate to 17.5% from a temporary \n15%, surging oil prices, and the impact of the weaker pound.\n\nKing must write to the Chancellor when benchmark annual inflation moves more than one percentage point in either \ndirection from the 2% target set by the Treasury.\n\nThe 0.6 percentage point jump in the annual CPI inflation rate between December and January was the second-\nlargest monthly increase since comparable records began in 1996. The largest monthly jump in the annual CPI \nrate,  of one percentage point, occurred between November and December last year.\n\nHowever, the annual CPI inflation rate in January was in line with City forecasts.\n\nCore annual CPI inflation, excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, edged up from 2.8% in December to 3.1% \nin January.\n\n\n\nJonathan Loynes, chief European economist at consultancy Capital Economics, noted that the CPIY measure of \ninflation, which excludes the impact of indirect taxes such as VAT, plummeted from 2.8% in December to 1.9% in \nJanuary.\n\nHe declared:  It looks like retailers offset much of the effect of the tax increase by cutting ex-VAT prices. \n\nLoynes believed the January inflation data might actually  be the first sign that the vast amount of spare capacity in \nthe economy is starting to weigh down on underlying price pressures .\n\nHe added:  While it is clear that worries about the inflation outlook are not about to disappear, January s figures \nshould help to reassure the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) that the current upward pressure will prove to be \nshort-lived and that inflation will eventually drop back sharply. \n\nBARCLAYS chief executive John Varley acknowledged the massive support given to the banking sector as the \ncompany unveiled bumper profits and huge bonus payouts for its investment bankers.\n\nThe giant lender announced that pre-tax profits surged by 92% to \u00a311.6bn in 2009, from \u00a36.1bn in the previous \nyear, and said it had made a strong start to 2010.\n\nBarclays will pay bonuses averaging \u00a395,000 to staff in its BarCap investment banking arm for 2009 and much \nmore to some people.\n\nThe bonus pot includes \u00a31.5bn for discretionary cash payments and a further \u00a31.2bn for awards that vest over three \nyears, which can be clawed back.\n\nNoting that the share of BarCap s revenue distributed as bonuses fell to 38% from 44% in 2008, Varley claimed \nBarclays had exercised appropriate restraint. Varley and Bob Diamond, who heads BarCap, have waived their \nentitlement to a bonus for 2009.\n\nHowever, the results announcement stoked fresh controversy about banks  activity amid the credit crunch and the \nrelated recession.\n\n Barclays super-profits show that banks win in both good times and bad,  said Brendan Barber, general secretary \nof the TUC. \n\n Paying huge bonuses when people are still losing their jobs and business cannot get the loans they need because \nof a crash made in the finance sector goes against every concept of fairness. \n\nPeter Hughes, chief executive of Scottish Enginering, said just because Barclays did not receive a direct bail-out \nfrom the Government did not mean it could be exempt from cricism for paying lavish bonuses.\n\nThe bank had benefited from massive taxpayer bail-outs that involved the Government taking stakes in rivals like \nRoyal Bank of Scotland.\n\nIt has also been helped by official measures to boost liquidity including \u00a3250bn official guarantees of interbank \nlending by eligible insitutions such as Barclays.\n\n Barclays certainly benefitied from the the bail out of others,  Hughes told The Herald.\n\n If it had not been for the \u00a3250bn bail out not only would they not have had bonuses they would not\n\nsubdeck in here and here and here and here and here please\n\nBANKS are still failing to provide affordable funding for Scotland s engineering businesses despite repeated official \nattempts to help kick-start lending.\n\n\n\nPeter Hughes, chief executive of Scottish Engineering, said the organisation had been  inundated  with complaints \nfrom members regarding  extremely unhelpful  behaviour by banks.\n\n Our industry has been reassured so often that the banks, which we recently bailed out, would be more than willing \nand able to loosen their purse strings so that funding would be available to help Scotland s businesses. \n\n I am hearing from company executives who are working their socks off that this is not happening. \n\nThe Institute of Directors said six in 10 businesses seeking loans in 2009/10 were rejected by their bank.\n\nSingling out Bank of Scotland for criticism, Hughes said banks were charging bloated fees and overdraft rates.\n\nHe said some companies  felt that banks were inter- fering with running their business and requiring them to \nprovide unnecessary information.\n\nA spokesman for Bank of Scotland said:  We strongly dispute these allegations.  As part of our SME Charter, we \nhave made pledges to help ensure firms have clear information and certainty about the finance they receive. \n\n These include a pledge that the margins we charge over our cost of funding will only increase where there has  \nbeen a material increase in risk.  \n\nThe bank said that arrangement fees on loans and overdrafts will not be greater than 1.5% of the overall value of \nthe facility. \n\nTHE value of decrees against Scottish businesses reached record levels in 2009, according to figures from the \nRegistry Trust   the not-for-profit company which maintains judgment and decree information in the public interest.\n\nThe total value of commercial decrees rose by 74% to a record \u00a311.5 million. Similarly, the number of decrees \nagainst businesses shot up by 53% to reach 7946.\n\nROYAL Dutch Shell, the big UK-Dutch oil group, announced yesterday that it has frozen pay for its chief executive \nPeter Voser and other top managers following a shareholder revolt last year, writes Douglas Hamilton.\n\nIn May, 60% of Shell s shareholders voted against its remuneration report at its annual meeting.\n\nShell said the salaries for its chief executive and chief financial officer were being frozen until 2011, adding that  it \nwanted to  demonstrate appropriate restraint in the current economic environment . \n\nHans Wijers, chairman of Shell s Remuneration Committee, told its investors of its new measures in a letter that \nhas been published on its website. The company said Voser (pictured), and chief financial officer Simon Henry, had \nsalaries that were 20% lower than their predecessors.\n\n We will require a mandatory deferral of 25% of any annual bonus into the firm s deferred bonus plan,  Mr Wijers \nsaid, in addition to a voluntary deferral of up to a further 25% it had previously outlined. \n\nShell will also award bonuses based on how well projects are delivered, rather than its previous measure of total \nshareholder return. \n\nLast week, the company reported a sharp fall in profits between October and December last year because of falling \ndemand for oil from a weak global economy.\n"}
