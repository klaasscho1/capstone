And now federal immigration officials are looking at his \ncase, too.\n\nThe 57-year-old, who had been arrested in Oakland on Dec. 28 on burglary charges, is now in custody without bail \non a federal immigration hold, according to jail records. Officials still are not sure how he escaped Monday.\n\nSpecifics of the immigration hold were not available Tuesday, but it means federal authorities believe Franco is \n\"deportable,\" said Virgina Kice, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nKice said she could not comment specifically on Franco's case, including the reason for the hold and why it came \ninto effect the day after his escape attempt, even though he had been in jail since December.\n\nAdditional charges relating to his escape have not yet been presented to the Alameda County District Attorney's \nOffice, said Sheriff's spokesman J.D. Nelson.\n\nHe could be charged with escaping from custody and theft, for the bicycle he was found riding when he was \ncaptured Monday evening in Dublin, not far from the jail, Nelson said.\n\nThe Sheriff's Office is still investigating how Franco escaped over a wall as he arrived back at the jail after a \nmorning court hearing, Nelson said.\n\nA jail employee saw the inmate running away from the jail about 2 p.m., sparking a hunt by officers on foot, \nincluding some with dogs, and by helicopter.\n\nContact Paul Thissen at 925-847-2122.
