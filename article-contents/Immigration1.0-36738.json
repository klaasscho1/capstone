{"title": "WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING;Helping the World Bank", "body": "\nCongress sometimes works in mysterious ways. Thanks to new immigration legislation, for example, the World \nBank may now find it easier to carry out staff cuts and reorganization plans.\n\nThe key is a provision of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 that permits foreign nationals who are \ninternational civil servants to maintain their United States residence should they lose their jobs, provided they have \nlived in this country 15 years.\n\nPreviously, these foreign nationals and their dependents had to pack their bags within 30 days of a notice of \ndismissal. And so the bank and other international organizations based in the United States were reluctant to press \nreorganizations plans that would to impose such hardship, Barber B. Conable Jr., after taking over as president of \nthe World Bank last July, pushed for the change. But lobbying seeds in fact had been sewn five years earlier, \naccording to Lester Nurick, a lawyer at the firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering.\n\nMr. Nurick, an alumnus of the bank, was retained as a lobbyist by a coalition of civil servants from that institution \nand such others as the International Monetary Fund, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Organization of \nAmerican States and the United Nations.\n\n''With their pensions and education these are very desirable people to have around,'' Mr. Nurick said.\n"}
