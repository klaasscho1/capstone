{"title": "HAITIANS BOLT SHIP, SWARM CAUSEWAY", "body": "\nHundreds of Haitian refugees jumped from a crowded wooden freighter that ran aground near Miami and swarmed \nonto a freeway yesterday.\n\nSome of the 200 or so boat people reported having been at sea for eight days, police said.\n\nMany were dazed and could hardly speak to ask for food and water. Others scrambled onto the highway and tried \nto hitch rides as police rushed in to round them up.\n\nAt least one pickup truck was seen driving off jam-packed with immigrants.\n\nThe Coast Guard said the refugees' 50-foot boat was dangerously overcrowded when it ran aground off Key \nBiscayne.\n\n\"They were all over the front of the boat, the top of the boat, the back of the boat. They were all over it,\" said \nwindsurfer Ovidio DeLeon. \"Then they started jumping.\"\n\nAs the boat approached the shore, many jumped overboard and swam. Later, small children were passed to \nrefugees standing in knee-deep water.\n\nPolice rounded up dozens, put them in plastic handcuffs and bused them to an Immigration and Naturalization \nService jail in Miami-Dade County.\n\n\"You saw the desperation written all over these people's faces,\" said prominent Haitian-American activist Gepsie \nMetAllus. \"And because of immigration policies, I just don't see how we can make the case for them to stay.\"\n\nUnder a Bush administration policy change in December, Haitian immigrants are detained pending hearings, unlike \nCuban refugees, who are released and allowed to stay.\n\nSome of the refugees spoke Spanish, so authorities speculated Dominicans were among the refugees.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nAP NO WAY OUT Haitians are held on Rickenbacker Causeway near Hobie Beach, Fla., yesterday after their \ncrowded wooden freighter ran aground near Miami.\n\n"}
