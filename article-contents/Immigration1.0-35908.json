{"title": "AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS WHO COME AND GO", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\n In a March 13 news article, ''Some Greeks Find Promise of U.S. Fades,'' you say that ''for the first time, a growing \nnumber of Greek immigrants are thinking about leaving the United States and returning to Greece. . . .''\n\nFor centuries, Greeks have been migrating to all parts of the world - and for centuries, they have been returning \nhome in droves. Oscar Handlin, who wrote of this tendency among Greek and other immigrants nearly three \ndecades ago (''Immigrants Who Go Back,'' Atlantic, July 1956), noted that ''from the start, the currents of trans-\nAtlantic migration has flowed in both directions.''\nIndeed, during the first three decades of this century, nearly four million immigrants left the United States for \nEurope.\n\nBut the return home was not necessarily permanent. The process of migration and transplantation transforms \nGreek immigrants into Greek-Americans, Greek-Australians or Greek-Canadians, and the memory of the new land \npulls them back like a magnet.\n\nI have an aunt who has crossed the Atlantic eight times in the last 15 years, each time believing she was making a \npermanent move. Her latest crossing, made last August, took her back to Athens.  In her most recent letters to me, \nshe wrote of how she longed for Astoria (New York).\n\nHer plight - the vain search for the best of both lands - is by no means unique. A word for Greeks who go back: \nGreece won't be what you think it is, anymore than the United States was what you expected it to be.\n\n \n\nNICK A. KOMONS Potomac, Md., March 13, 1984\n"}
