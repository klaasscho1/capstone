Most of this growth comes \nfrom countries outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and this growth is \nfocused in regions where strong economic growth is driving demand, especially in Asian regions.The present \nenergy review tries to put light on few of the important topics that have been researched in a concise way by \nsummarizing the key facts from the reports published in 2019. This Research Review include portions of several \nmarket research studies and is an efficient way for market professionals to keep up with the general market \ndevelopments of 2019.SummaryEnergy industry greatly impacts the lives of everyone, and every nation strives to \nachieve energy independence by utilizing the natural resources, be it conventional fossil fuels or renewable \nsources.Advancements in technology has changed the landscape of the energy industry, for example the shale \nrevolution has made US a net exporter of oil from being one of the largest importers of the commodity.Likewise, \nconcerns about the depleting resources in the form of oil reserves, gas reverses, and ill effects of dependence on \nfossil fuels like coal has given a renewed thrust on researching renewable energy technologies to reduce the \nharmful impact on the environment as well as create energy sustainability for long term.In 2018, according to EIA, \nthe global energy consumption increased to twice of the average consumption in 2010.The increased energy \nconsumption is driven by a robust global economy and increasing needs of heating and cooling in some parts of the \nworld.As per EIA, the world energy consumption will grow by nearly 50% between 2018 and 2050.
