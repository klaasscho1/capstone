An attorney for Fierle, who resigned as a guardian statewide July 25, filed \ntwo petitions asking the state's 5th District Court of Appeals to reverse the ruling from Orange County Circuit Judge \nJanet C.

'Florida insurance companies took months to pay Hurricane Michael \nclaims[17]' via Lawrence Mower of the Tampa Bay Times \u2014 Florida insurance Commissioner David Altmaier told \nlawmakers that he hadn't seen 'even an instance' of insurance companies breaking the law following Hurricane \nMichael. But records show his office was notified of at least four cases of insurers failing to pay their claims on time, \nwith the companies paying penalties in each instance. The notices came from employees at the Department of \nFinancial Services, which operates an insurance complaint line that has fielded more than 1,700 complaints \nfollowing the storm. The department sent the most serious cases, including at least four involving companies \nviolating the 90-day statute, to Altmaier's office. 'State officials promise legislation to speed up payment of hurricane \ninsurance claims[18]' via Lawrence Mower of the Tampa Bay Times \u2014 Consumer Advocate Tasha Carter told state \nSenators that she and her boss, Florida Chief Financial Officer Patronis, are working on a consumer protection-\nfocused package of ideas that lawmakers could vote on when the next Legislative Session starts Jan. 14. \n'Insurance consumers are very frustrated with their insurance companies,' Carter said.

'Dorian estimated insured losses at $19 million[19]' \nvia the News Service in Florida \u2014 Only 5,764 claims from Dorian had been filed in Florida as of Oct. 4, with \nestimated insured losses at $19 million, according to the information posted on the state Office of Insurance \nRegulation. By comparison, Hurricane Michael, which devastated parts of Northwest Florida last year, has \ngenerated about 150,000 claims and $7.16 billion in estimated insured losses. Hurricane Dorian flattened parts of \nthe Bahamas and threatened Florida before staying off the state's East Coast.

'Florida's lack of dental care hurts low-income and rural residents[20]' via Lloyd \nDunkelberger of Florida Phoenix \u2014 As of Sept. 30, 5.46 million Floridians \u2014 about one in four residents \u2014 lived in \nareas lacking dentists, according to the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration's latest report on \n'designated health professional shortage areas.' It would take an additional 1,230 dentists to resolve that unmet \nneed in Florida. Many of those people without access to regular dental care are poor or live in rural communities, \naccording to The Pew Charitable Trusts. Additionally, Pew found that the more than 55 million children and adults \nnationally who have some dental coverage through Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program 'also face \na scarcity of care' because many dentists don't accept public insurance. \u2014 FLORIDA'S SOBRIETY INDUSTRY \u2014 \nSouth Florida has 478 licensed facilities for drug treatment, notes Colton Wooten in The New Yorker[21]. That's \nmore treatment centers than elementary schools. Wooten describes his experiences in the Florida drug treatment \n'shuffle,' cycling between addiction and recovery \u2014 and the industry that keeps the cycle going. For years, South \nFlorida has been known as a 'haven for 12-step programs.' Wooten writes: 'In 2007, the Times described the \nconstellation of sober homes in Delray Beach as 'a funky outpost of sobriety,' and 'the epicenter of the country's \nlargest and most vibrant recovery community.'' One of the factors is Delray Beach's appeal to private residential-\nrehab facilities, offering their own outpatient treatment plans \u2014 which developed into the so-called Florida Model, a \nless expensive option for those seeking recovery who have either bad credit, criminal records or lack the resources \nto live alone. By 2010, the Affordable Care Act changed the landscape of addiction treatment, mandating that \ninsurance companies cover services for substance-use disorders \u2014 and prohibiting limits for preexisting conditions. \nWhile addiction alone is not a preexisting condition, relapse \u2014 which is common among addicts \u2014 could count as \none. This made it easier for treatment centers to bill insurance, making it fall within the reaches of the middle class. \n'Little in medicine is as ill-defined or as anecdotal as addiction treatment,' Wooten writes. 'Like any industry in a \nperiod of explosive growth, addiction treatment attracted wrongdoers. Insurance fraud became rampant.' Along with \nrehab centers, urinalysis for drug use is also became profitable \u2014 a 'liquid gold mine' \u2014 despite the lack of \nregulation defining best practices. 'The kids who arrived for treatment soon saw that their insurance policies could \nbe used as expense accounts for detox or sober living,' Wooten notes.  \u2014 NOTES FROM ELSEWHERE \u2014 What \nJeff Brandes is reading \u2014 'Illinois drivers have paid $1 billion in red light camera tickets in last 10 years[22]' via \nCBS2 Chicago \u2014 Illinois drivers have forked over an astounding $1 billion in red light camera fines in the past 10 \nyears, according to a new study. Now, some lawmakers in Springfield are reviving a push to ban the cameras. At \nleast two state representatives have introduced proposed legislation to eliminate red-light cameras in Illinois, \nalthough both proposals remain in the infancy stages.

Those areas were designated 'opportunity zones.' In Pennsylvania, however, early \nsigns suggest the program is not living up to the claims of transformative change, and is unlikely to be a cure for \ncommunities most in need.            https://wearegeo.com/ \u2014 PEACHY \u2014 'Nancy Pelosi holds often vote to authorize \n\n\nTrump impeachment inquiry \u2014 for now[25]' via John Bresnahan, Sarah Ferris and Heather Caygle of POLITICO \u2014 \nDemocratic leadership sources caution, however, that the decision could be 'reassessed at some point.' Trump, \nWhite House official and Republicans on Capitol Hill have seized on the absence of such a vote as an unacceptable \nbreak with House precedent and have vowed to resist what they describe as an illegitimate probe. Democrats \ndefended their current impeachment process, which has multiple House committees interviewing witnesses in \nprivate and gathering evidence related to allegations that Trump and his personal lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, pressured \nUkrainian officials to begin an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son or risk losing U.S. \nmilitary aid.           https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/pelosi.jpg Nancy Pelosi is holding off a House floor vote on impeachment. 'Trump's \nimpeachment barricade crumbles[26]' via Kyle Cheney and Andrew Desiderio of POLITICO \u2014 The President's \nformer top Russia adviser, Fiona Hill \u2014 the first White House official to cooperate in Democrats' investigation of the \nUkraine scandal \u2014 has detailed for lawmakers a trail of alleged corruption that extends from Kyiv to the West Wing. \nIn dramatic testimony, she roped in some of Trump's top advisers as witnesses to the unfolding controversy. And \nTuesday, a senior State Department official, George Kent, appeared on Capitol Hill to testify about his knowledge of \nthe episode despite an attempt by Trump administration lawyers to block him. It's the latest evidence that the White \nHouse's stonewalling against congressional requests for documents and testimony is crumbling \u2014 and Democrats \nare feeling a new sense of momentum. 'John Bolton's eruption shows that Trump's defenses are collapsing[27]' via \nGreg Sargent of The Washington Post \u2014 Trump's explicitly declared position in the scandal consuming his \npresidency is that pressuring a foreign power to 'investigate' a leading domestic political opponent absolutely falls \nwithin his rightfully exercised authority. But this defense is cracking up. That's because we're now learning, one \nafter another, that all the people around him knew that it was grievously wrong \u2014 that is, all except for those who \nwere carrying out Trump's corrupt scheme. The latest domino to fall is John Bolton, who grew so alarmed by efforts \nto pressure Ukraine to launch 'investigations' into Biden and his son that he instructed an aide to alert White House \nlawyers. That aide is Fiona Hill, a former senior White House adviser on Russia and Europe. 'Lara Trump: \nImpeachment 'hysteria' will die down[28]' via Scott Powers of Florida Politics \u2014 'Impeachment hysteria, as I \ncontinue to call it, will ultimately die down,' said Trump, who is married to Trump's son Eric and is an adviser to the \nPresident's reelection campaign, Donald J. Trump for President. She was speaking in one of two briefings the \nTrump campaign held for journalists, essentially offering the 'Stop the Madness' protests as a short-term response \nto pressure moderate Democrats in swing districts, such as U.S. Reps. Charlie Crist and Stephanie Murphy, while \nthe long-term strategy focuses on organizing ground operations nationally, while pushing the messaging of a \nbooming economy. \u2014 D.C. MATTERS \u2014 'Republicans buckle to Trump on Syria[29]' via Burgess Everett, Melanie \nZanona and Marianne Levine of POLITICO \u2014 Republicans unleashed perhaps their most aggressive outcry of the \nTrump era after he abandoned the U.S.'s Kurdish allies and ceded northeastern Syria to Turkey. But now GOP \nlawmakers are dialing back their direct criticism of the President \u2014 instead working with Trump, dinging Democrats \nand trying to move forward. Senior Republicans are coordinating with Trump's top officials to try to rein in Turkey \nwith sanctions and protect the Kurds, and while they're still dissatisfied with the situation, they've shifted gears away \nfrom confrontation with the President.            https://www.flchamber.com/event_post/future-of-florida-forum/ \u2014 \n2020 \u2014 'Elizabeth Warren wins big in Broward Young Democrats straw poll, far ahead of Joe Biden and Bernie \nSanders[30]' via Anthony Man of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2014 The U.S. Senator from Massachusetts received \n27 first-choice votes (her closest competitor received 15).

Gancarski of Florida Politics \u2014The Congressman raised $49,410[32] in the 3rd quarter of \n2019, which ran through Sept. 30. This is nearly two-thirds of the $76,614 he has raised this cycle. Of that money, \njust two checks totaling $5,000 came from Florida political action committees, with one more individual contribution \nfrom Florida. Yoho's campaign committee has nearly a quarter-million dollars on hand. This is factoring in third-\nquarter spending of over $26,000, including a $318 tab at a Trump Hotel in D.C.           \n\nYoho keeps fundraising but does not explain precisely why. 'Ross Spano (barely) digs himself out of the red in \nlatest campaign finance activity[33]' via Janelle Irwin Taylor of Florida Politics \u2014 He's out quite a bit of cash thanks \nto loan repayments to his botched 2018 campaign loans. Reports show Spano raised $117,000 from July through \nSeptember, bringing his total amount raised this year to $400,000. But he repaid $110,000 to loans that fueled his \n2018 campaign that Spano admitted amounted to illegal campaign contributions. That leaves nearly $60,000 in \nloans that still need to be paid, which means Spano's campaign still owes almost as much as it's worth. 'DCCC \nroasts Spano in 'here I fixed it for you' news release rewrite[34]' via Janelle Irwin Taylor of Florida Politics \u2014 After \nSpano's campaign sent out a news release morning defending its 3rd quarter fundraising, the Democratic \nCongressional Campaign Committee wasted no time in picking it to pieces. The DCCC offered a simple edit, \nstriking through the campaign's words and replacing them with 'worst quarter of 2019' and 'historically weak.' \nSpano's release said the campaign had repaid loans, which the DCCC added were illegal, at the advice of 'staff \nfrom the Federal Election Commission,' which resulted in nearly zeroing out Spano's campaign's worth. With loans \nstill owed, Spano's campaign is worth just $10,000, a fact the DCCC noted in its edit was 'one of the lowest account \nbalances of any member of Congress.' 'Adam Hattersley rakes in six figures in first congressional campaign finance \nreport[35]' via Janelle Irwin Taylor of Florida Politics \u2014 State Rep. Hattersley raised $115,000 during the third \nquarter report period for his Congressional campaign. That quarter covers July through September. Hattersley \ndidn't enter the race until the end of July. Hattersley's earnings came from more than 1,800 individual contributions. \nNone of his funding came from corporate political action committees. Hattersley is running for Florida's 15th \nCongressional District, which represents eastern Hillsborough County. He faces fellow Democrat Alan Cohn in the \nprimary. The winner will take on incumbent Spano. Laura Loomer raises $154K for CD 21 bid \u2014 Far-right activist \nLoomer has raised $154,000 for her bid to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. Lois Frankel in Florida's 21st \nCongressional District, Gary Fineout of POLITICO Florida reports. Loomer is one of several Republicans \nchallenging Frankel in the reliably Democratic congressional district. 'Despite the radical left, big tech tyrants and \nthe fake-news media doing everything they can to hinder my campaign, this early showing puts career politician \nLois Frankel and the do-nothing-Democrats in Congress on notice that no seat is safe and that I'm running to win,' \nLoomer said. Frankel has posted her third-quarter fundraising numbers, but she raised nearly $328,000 in the first \nhalf of the year.           https://3o15h033zmpwracwx2i00rqx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/loomer.jpg Laura Loomer raises $154K, but compared to her opponents, she has a rough \nroad ahead. 'Maria Elvira Salazar brings in $504K in 3Q, topping Donna Shalala[36]' via Ryan Nicol of Florida \nPolitics \u2014 That hefty haul was helped in part by a $50,000 loan from Salazar to her campaign. But even just looking \nat outside contributions, Salazar's $454,000 number tops Shalala's third-quarter figure by about $140,000. Indeed, \nShalala's biggest quarter this year, her second quarter, showed Shalala raising $422,000. Salazar's number tops \nthat as well. This is, however, Salazar's first filing with the FEC this cycle. Candidates typically shoot for a \nsignificant number in their first fundraising report, so it remains to be seen whether Salazar will keep up the \nfundraising pace as she continues her challenge against Shalala. 'Joe Harding takes fundraising lead in HD 22 \ncontest[37]' via Drew Wilson of Florida Politics \u2014 Republican Harding added more than $13,000 to his campaign \naccount last month, putting him ahead in the contest to replace term-limited Rep. Charlie Stone in House District \n22. Harding's haul brought him past the $85,000 mark. With candidate loans included, he has raised more than \n$99,000 and has about $97,000 in the bank. Also seeking the Republican nomination is Russ Randall, who \nreported $1,075 in September receipts. The report was his lowest of the cycle. All told, Randall has raised $81,225 \nand has about $79,600 on hand. Harding's campaign called the month a 'turning point' in the race, citing the exit of \nformer Republican Rep.

The first-time candidate, born and \nraised in Puerto Rico, sees his youth and recent move into the district as assets more than liabilities.

You might get higher taxes[41]' via Scott Maxwell of the Orlando \nSentinel \u2014 You could argue Universal \u2014 whose parent company posted $11.7 billion in profits last year from \nfamilies like mine \u2014 should pay for its own darn road, since the park is clearly the prime beneficiary. (So much so \nthat Universal is in charge of construction. That's unusual.) Second, if we're going to subsidize businesses, I'd \nrather subsidize businesses with high wages. Third, there's the price tag. After the state throws in another $16 \nmillion and Universal pays $174 million, it's more than $300 million for a 1.7-mile stretch of pavement. That's more, \nper mile, than the mammoth 10-lane, I-4 Ultimate project. Fourth, if construction comes in under budget, the theme \npark \u2014 not taxpayers \u2014 get most, if not all, of the savings. 'Orlando drivers among best in U.S., survey finds[42]' \nvia Tiffani Theisen of the Orlando Sentinel \u2014 That's according to QuoteWizard, an online insurance comparison \ncompany owned by LendingTree. The company admitted 'our study analysts haven't driven in Orlando,' but said \nthey derived the rankings from incidents reported by QuoteWizard users, including the number of accidents, \nspeeding tickets and other citations, and DUIs. So, while it may not be as comprehensive as Florida Department of \nTransportation database, still, Orlando is right there \u2014 at No. 23 out of 35 \u2014 under a bold heading '2019 best \ndriving cities in America.' 'F-1, Hard Rock strike deal to hold race in Miami Gardens. Will county give green \nlight?[43]' via Adam Beasley of the Miami Herald \u2014 A race months in the making is one step closer to reality. \nFormula One has finalized an agreement in principle with Hard Rock Stadium to bring annual F-1 racing to South \nFlorida beginning in May 2021. Now it's up to Miami-Dade County commissioners. There has been pushback from \nMiami Gardens residents, Commissioner Barbara Jordan, whose district includes Hard Rock Stadium, and the \nMayor running to replace her, Oliver Gilbert. Both Jordan and Gilbert have come out publicly against holding the \nevent. Jordan proposed legislation to require a commission vote before Formula One could win county approval for \nthe temporary closure of Northwest 119th Street during race weekend. A decision on the legislation could come \nlater this month.            http://yoursearchisdone.com/ \u2014 MORE LOCAL \u2014 'Jury recommends life without parole for \nSigfredo Garcia, the gunman who killed Dan Markel[44]' via Blaise Gainey and Regan McCarthy \u2014 During the \nsentencing hearing, Assistant State Attorney Georgia Cappleman pointed to aggravating factors she said made the \ndeath penalty warranted \u2014 including that she says the crime was committed for financial gain, and that it was \ncalculated and premeditated. 'Calculated means having a careful plan or a prearranged design to commit murder. \nIn this case, they were careful enough to follow and stalk their victim,' Cappleman said. But Garcia's defense \nattorney argued Katherine Magbanua was controlling Garcia, which he says is a mitigating factor. Police say \nMagbanua was the link between Garcia and Markels in-laws in an alleged murder-for-hire plot.           \nhttp://yoursearchisdone.com/\n\nthe show called 'Intersection' from 2007 until 2016.            http://www.flaports.org; \u2014 OPINIONS \u2014 'Ron DeSantis \nalready a winner even if he loses on teacher raises[48]' via Mac Stipanovich for the Tampa Bay Times \u2014 DeSantis \nknows a good first impression is proof against a multitude of subsequent sins. DeSantis went on a press tour \ntouting a proposal for a statewide minimum salary for teachers of $47,500. His proposal is, however, so light on \nspecifics that it is more of a sketch than a plan at this point. But regardless of whether DeSantis achieves all, some, \nor none of his stated goal, he has already won. He is now an education governor. And even his continued \ncooperation with the Republican-controlled Legislature in vandalizing traditional public education in the name of \n'school choice' is unlikely to alter this good first impression. At least in the short term. 'Jos Oliva: in policy debates, \nthe public should speak up, not 'shut up'[49]' via the Orlando Sentinel \u2014 In a recent piece supporting the proposed \nteacher pay raise, Orlando Sentinel columnist Lauren Ritchie fired off a literary cluster-bomb into the public debate. \nShe does deserve credit for having titled her work with 'shut up.' That is precisely what she would have everyone \ndo. It is not difficult to see why I would take exception to being told to 'shut up,' but to be told to 'shut up' for the \nspecific reason of lacking a college degree requires a response. It requires a response as 60 percent of our nation \nis made up of such citizens, and they ought not to believe they should 'shut up' on just the basis of not having \ncompleted college.             \nhttp://www.tgh.org?utm_source=floridapolitics.com..._medium=display..._campaign=usnews \u2014 MOVEMENTS \u2014 \n'DeSantis appoints one circuit, two county judges[50]' via Florida Politics \u2014 Gov. DeSantis' office announced he \nhad appointed Stephen M. Whyte to be a circuit judge in the 12th Judicial Circuit, named Bruce Carney a Citrus \nCounty judge, and made Andrea Totten a Flagler County judge. The three new judgeships were created by a \ncourts-related bill (HB 5011) passed in the 2019 Legislative Session. \u2014 ALOE \u2014 'Former Buc Warrick Dunn \nsurprises St. Pete single mother with new home[51]' via Monique Welch of the Tampa Bay Times \u2014 As a single \nmother to her 18-year-old son, AnTrez, LaToya Reedy worked hard as a certified nursing assistant to provide a \nstable lifestyle for him. 'I got tired of paying the high rent,' she said. Thanks to Habitat for Humanity of Pinellas and \nWest Pasco Counties and its partnership with furniture company Aaron's, health care provider Cigna, and former \nBuccaneer Dunn's nonprofit, Warrick Dunn Charities, Reedy and her son received a fully furnished two-bedroom, \ntwo-bathroom home at no cost. Habitat for Humanity bought an empty lot near Childs Park and built the home, \nwhich spans nearly 2,000 square feet, while Aaron's donated $10,000 toward furniture, appliances, and interior \ndesign, and Cigna donated $10,000 toward down payment assistance and groceries.           \nhttp://www.flaports.org/\nhttp://www.tgh.org/?utm_source=floridapolitics.com..._medium=display..._campaign=usnews\n\nstory.html [ 9]:            \n"}
