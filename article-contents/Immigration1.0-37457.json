{"title": "92 Captive Aliens Are Rescued in a Raid", "body": "\nLos Angeles County sheriff's deputies raided a house here Wednesday night and rescued 92 illegal aliens who \nwere being held captive by nine smugglers demanding ransom from the aliens' relatives, the authorities said \ntoday.\n\nThe deputies said that the aliens, from El Salvador and Mexico, had been kept at the house for several days and \nthat dozens of them had been locked inside one 8-by-20-foot room.\nOthers were locked inside three small bedrooms, the authorities said.\n\nThe deputies raided the house, about 25 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, after receiving word from one of the \ncaptives' relatives about the ransom demand. Nearly $19,000 in cash was also found, said Sgt. Bob Olmsted of the \nSheriff's Department.\n\nThe nine captors were taken into custody, and the illegal aliens were turned over to the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service.\n\nInvestigators believe that the captors, whose identities were not immediately disclosed, were ''coyotes'' - people \nwho make a clandestine business of bringing aliens across the border illegally. Sergeant Olmsted said the \nsmugglers had demanded up to $1,000 from each of the captives' relatives for their release. Many of the aliens \nhad already paid the smugglers similar amounts to be transported to Los Angeles, he said.\n"}
