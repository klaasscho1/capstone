{"title": "ALIENATED BY FEDSEMIGRES RALLY, RIP AID CURBS", "body": "\nWASHINGTON Some 6,000 immigrants marched in the nation's capital yesterday to protest new welfare \nrestrictions, charging that they unfairly target newcomers to this country.\n\nThe changes being phased in this year will mandate, in most cases, that immigrants become citizens to receive or \ncontinue receiving Supplemental Security Income benefits and food stamps.\n\nProtesters said many immigrants would find learning English to pass a citizenship exam an insurmountable \nobstacle. They called for allowing immigrants to take the exam in their native language.\n\nThe demonstration drew immigrants from across the country, including many New Yorkers. Among them was Isaac \nZeyfman, 76, of Brighton Beach, Brooklyn.\n\nZeyfman, who came to the U.S. from Ukraine in 1994, survived five bullet wounds as a soldier in World War II. He \nworries that his difficulty in learning English will prevent him from becoming an American citizen.\n\n\"If I don't pass the exam, I will be cut off. That's a tragedy for me,\" he said.\n\n\"I study English every day,\" he added in broken English before lapsing into Russian, \"but you can see it's not really \nsticking.\"\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler (D-Manhattan) said immigrants like Zeyfman \"believed in the American promise of freedom and \nopportunity and equality, and now they find themselves discriminated against.\"\n\nDan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American Immigrant Reform, said the march was \"eroding the \npublic's already eroded views on the value of immigration. What is the purpose, if it produces a steady stream of \nimmigrants clamoring for benefits?\"\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nHARRY HAMBURG DAILY NEWS A RALLY FOR THE AGES: Aliza Abramowitz, 3, shows her fervor for the U.S. \nduring rally in Washington to protest regulations on federal aid to immigrants.
