{"title": "Letters: All Rocker did was voice perceptions of many in U.S.", "body": "\nWe are witnessing a story that involves much more than John Rocker, the Atlanta Braves relief pitcher. Some of \nthe statements Rocker made in the Sports Illustrated interview obviously were insulting, but he also expressed \nsome concerns shared by many who are silent now because it is thought to be \" politically incorrect\" to \nspeak.JOURNAL\n\nOne thing he said was, \"You can walk a whole block at Times Square and never hear anyone speaking English.\" It \nis notable that \"English-only\" debates are going on in various parts of the country and there are legitimate concerns \non the part of many that immigration, particularly the illegal kind, is out of control.\n\nThere is a perception that when someone comes to America to enjoy all the benefits thereof, we who were born \nhere are supposed to accommodate them and learn their customs, etc., instead of the other way around. There also \nis a perception that many illegal immigrants are supported by U.S. taxpayers and are recipients of all kinds of \ngovernment help such as preferences for business loans, etc., and all because they are from somewhere else.\n\nThere is a perception that politicians, particularly liberal Democrats, use immigrants to further their own causes \nand to increase the numbers of voters who are most likely to support them. This concern is fed by such acts as the \nswearing-in of a large number of new citizens just before the 1996 elections and revelations of campaign donations \nfrom citizens of other countries.\n\nNo one knows whether these perceptions are correct. But it is for certain that our precious freedom of speech \napplies to all Americans, not just those who say \"the right things.\"\n\nCHARLIE HOLLOMON\n\nHollomon, a technical writer, lives in Stockbridge.\n"}
