{"title": "Quake aid for illegal immigrants is newest fault line", "body": "\nThe California earthquake has produced new political shudders in Washington over the issue of disaster aid to \nillegal immigrants.\n\nAnti-immigrant resentment is at an all-time high in California, and Congress this week was forced to respond.\n\"There is no taste for even the appearance of providing scarce federal resources for people with no legal right to be \nhere,\" says Dan Stein, head of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which wants to reduce \nimmigration.\n\nThursday, the House approved a $ 8.6 billion aid bill that denies such benefits as free housing, cash grants and \nlow-interest loans to undocumented immigrants - the first time a disaster-relief bill has been so restricted. They can \nreceive emergency medical aid, food and temporary shelter.\n\nThe restriction was offered by conservative California Republicans. Democrats - pressed by fed-up constituents at \nhome - revised and reluctantly voted for the amendment out of fear something more onerous would pass.\n\nA similar restriction was offered for the flood-aid bill last year but failed.\n\n\"It's an easy political message,\" says Republican consultant Eddie Mahe. \"This gives (politicians) the opportunity to \nbe tough. And, in these days, toughness is in and simpatico is out.\"\n\nRaul Yzaguirre of the National Council of La Raza said the aid restriction was made easier because so many \nvictims are Hispanics.\n\n\"Immigrants are good scapegoats . . . because they're powerless, voiceless,\" says Mario Moreno of the Mexican \nAmerican Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n\nRep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., and other conservatives vow to attempt to attach an anti-illegals amendment to \nevery appropriations bill that comes up.\n\nNotes\n\nTHE NATION\n\nGraphic\n\n\n \n\nPHOTO, b/w\n"}
