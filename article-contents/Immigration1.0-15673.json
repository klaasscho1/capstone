Another founder, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, will be Sunday's \nkeynote speaker.\n\nShankar is known around the world as His Holy Happiness, an international humanitarian and a spiritual master \nwho offers self-empowerment messages mixed with breathing and yoga techniques.\n\nLocal panelists include Raka Ray, chair of the University of California-Berkeley's Center for South Asia Studies, \nRona Popal, president of the Afghan Women's Association International, Syed R. Mahmood, president of the \nAmerican Institute of International Studies, and Tony Lin, adviser to the North American Chinese Educational \nFoundation.\n\nFor information on tickets, which are $5 and $10, click on www.iahv.org. \n\nThe symposium will be 2 to 4 p.m. at Ohlone College's Smith Center, 43600 Mission Boulevard.\n\nNotes\n\nBay Area Briefing\n\nNew From Around The Region\n\n"}
