{"title": "ALIENS LEAVE THE SHADOWS AS YEAR OF AMNESTY DAWNS", "body": "\nThousands of illegal aliens stepped out of the shadows yesterday, lining up at Government centers around the \ncountry to apply for legal status under the new immigration law.\n\nIn New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and other major cities, small groups of aliens began lining up before dawn at \nnew legalization centers, which opened for business at 8 A.M. and will continue taking applications for amnesty \nuntil May 4, 1988.\n\n''I want to be the first,'' said Isabel Isamit, a 74-year-old native of Santiago, Chile, who has been living in Chicago \nsince 1969 and arrived at one of that city's 15 legalization centers at 3 A.M. yesterday.\n\nAt a legalization center in Long Island City, Queens, Reshad Lata and his wife produced income tax returns, gas \nbills and an apartment lease to show that they had lived in Brooklyn since 1981.\n\n \n\nChance for a Reunion\n\nFor the Latas, the amnesty program means a chance to reunite their entire family. One of the Lata children, who is \n5 years old, was born in New York City, and has American citizenship. But another child, now 7, was left behind \nwhen they moved to Brooklyn from Yugoslavia in 1981 and has been living with Mr. Lata's parents.\n\n''He doesn't know us,'' said Mr. Lata, a security guard, whose status as an illegal alien had prevented him from \nbringing the older child to New York. If his application for amnesty is approved, however, he said he hopes to \nreunite his family within 18 months.\n\nGovernment officials had been scrambling under tight deadlines to staff, equip and open the legalization centers on \ntime. And when they opened yesterday, most of the centers operated in an atmosphere of uncrowded calm.\n\n''The Government is more than prepared for this program,'' said Alan C. Nelson, the Commissioner of the \nImmigration Service, who attended the opening on West 24th Street of one of the New York City legalization \ncenters. ''Given six months to get ready, we have accomplished an amazing task.''\n\n \n\nOnly 173 Apply in New York\n\nStill, the number of people applying for amnesty on the first day of the program fell far short of the crush that some \nhad expected. In New York, for example, where the new centers are equipped to process 1,150 applications a day, \nonly 173 applicants turned up. Officials attributed the light turnout nationally to a reluctance among many illegal \naliens to identify themselves to the Immigration Service, even if they are qualified for amnesty and resident status.\n\n\nAlthough uncrowded, many of the the legalization centers took on an atmosphere of shared optimism.\n\n''I will never be afraid again,'' said Shakia Hydri, a Chicago bartender, came to the United States from Pakistan in \n1977, and who presented immigration officials in Chicago with his documents yesterday. ''We are in a free country - \nwith all its benefits.''\n\nThe amnesty program is also a family matter for Maquel Morales, a native of the Dominican Republic who moved \nto New York in 1978. A cook at a Manhattan restaurant, Mr. Morales said he and his wife have been in court five \ntimes since 1980 to appeal a deportation order, even though two of their children were born in the United States \nand are citizens.\n\n \n\nLooking for a Photographer\n\nAs he was awaiting an interview with Immigration Service officials, Mr. Morales spoke for a moment of the \nDominican Republic. ''My kids are Americans,'' he said. ''How could I take them back?''\n\nAnd in New Jersey, where dozens of aliens showed up at a legalization center in Paterson, Chac Boi Kwan, a 32-\nyear-old native of Vietnam, was less well prepared than most. After arriving at 8 A.M., he realized he had forgotten \nto bring a photograph of himself, as required, and had to scramble to find a photographer.\n\n''Despite this, I feel pretty good,'' said Mr. Kwan, who works as an actuary. He finally found a photography shop that \nopened hours after he arrived at the Paterson Center.\n\nAmnesty ''will make life easier for me,'' he added. He said legal status will help him in his career and allow him to \nvisit his mother, who lives in Hong Kong, without fears of violating the immigration laws.\n \nShort Lines in West\n\nIn San Francisco, where the turnout of amnesty applicants was light and orderly, 100 demonstrators, many of them \nassociated with immigrant rights groups, marched in front of the Immigration Service offices to protest the new law, \nwhich they said unfairly discriminates against aliens who arrived in the United States since 1982. In that city's \nMission District, a largely Hispanic neighborhood, the waiting area in a newly opened processing center was half \nempty.\n\nChicago's legalization centers began emptying out at mid-day.\n\nIn Los Angeles, where officials say there are more illegal aliens than in any other city, the lines at 15 new \nlegalization centers were short or nonexistent.\n\n''There is going to be a need for trust building,'' said Muzaffar Chisti, director of the Immigration Project of the \nInternational Ladies Garment Workers Union in New York. He added that illegal aliens ''distrust the system, and \nthey are not going to take a chance the first day.''\n\n \n\nNumber Expected to Grow\n\nThe amnesty program, signed into law by President Reagan last November, provides legal status to aliens who \nare able to demonstrate that they have been living in the United States since Jan. 1, 1982.\n\nSome New York officials said they were not surprised by the light first-day turnout because neither the illegal aliens \nnor a host of nonprofit groups that are guiding them through the application process have had sufficient time to gear \nup.\n\n''We expect the number of people being processed to increase very soon,'' said Charles C. Sava, director of the \nImmigration Service's New York District.\n\n\n\nIndeed, the level of activity yesterday was more hectic at churches, union offices and other nonprofit centers around \nthe country that have established programs to counsel aliens on their rights, help them collect documents, and \nguide them through the amnesty process.\n\n \n\nScores of Telephone Calls\n\nAt the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, which has been assisting its members and their families \nthroughout the nation, Mr. Chisti said more than 100 phone calls were coming in each hour from aliens seeking \ninformation about the new immigration law. ''We're going crazy over here,'' he said.\n\nAnd at an office set up last month by the Congress of Racial Equality in Brooklyn, volunteer workers said more than \n150 aliens walked in yesterday to seek advice and assistance, far more than any previous day.\n\n''At this point, we are the ones feeling the crush,'' said George Holmes, a CORE official. ''As word of the program \nspreads, and as the aliens get their documents together, the INS will have a crush of its own.''\n\nBut some officials who have been counseling aliens said their fears of the Immigration service are difficult to break \ndown, and the amnesty program is unlikely to attract anywhere close to the 3.9 people the Government estimates \nhave been living illegally in the United States since January 1982 and may qualify for legal status.\n\n''It's the kind of thing where one mistake might take years to correct,'' said Mary To, a director of a counseling \ncenter run by the International Institute of Los Angeles. She added that illegal aliens ''are in no rush'' to step \nforward.\n\nAmong those who applied yesterday, many had looking forward to the amnesty program for months. Most were \ninterviewed briefly by Immigration Service officials, and presented the officials with stacks of rent reciepts, medical \nbills, pay check records, and other documents necessary to prove that they qualify for legal status.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nphoto of Isabel Isamit (NYT); photo of aliens checking their amnesty applications (NYT/Steve Kagan); photo of a \nlawyer explaining forms to Chinese applicants (NYT/John Sotomayor)\n"}
