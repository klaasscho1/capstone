{"title": "HOUSE OKS TOUGH IMMIGRATION CURBS", "body": "\nWASHINGTON The House voted 305 to 123 yesterday for a bill to crack down on illegal immigration and cut \nspending on legal immigrants.\n\nWith Senate action still due, the White House sought changes to strengthen enforcement against employers who \nhire illegals and to soften curbs on government benefits for immigrants here lawfully.\n\nThe bill would:\n\nDouble the size of the Border Patrol to 10,000 agents.\n\nAuthorize new fences on the Mexican border.\n\nSet up a system for employers to voluntarily check the status of employes.\n\nMake it harder for aliens to fight deportation, and for refugees to win political asylum.\n\nBar Americans from sponsoring spouses, children and other family members for entry unless they earn well above \nthe poverty level.\n\nToughen sponsors' financial responsibilities.\n\nDeny legal immigrants' access to many public benefit programs, and allow deportation of those who use other \nprograms for over a year.\n\nThe bill's chief sponsor, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.), said it tells legals they are welcome \"to contribute and work \nand produce, but you can't come to take advantage of the taxpayers.\"\n\nRep. Nydia Velazquez (D-Brooklyn) charged legal aliens \"who play by the rules and pay taxes\" were being unfairly \nbranded \"untouchables.\"\n\nRep. Tom Manton whose west Queens district has a large illegal population was the only New York City Democrat \nto vote for the bill. Overall, 76 Democrats voted yes.\n\nRep. Pete King (R-L.I.), one of five Republicans opposing the bill, said it \"violated the American tradition\" of asylum \nfor the \"politically persecuted.\"\n\nThe House voted 254 to 175 for a separate bill letting states expel illegal aliens' kids from schools.\n\n\nBut with President Clinton pledging a veto, and Congress itching to adjourn within a week, no Senate action was \nexpected.\n"}
