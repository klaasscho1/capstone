{"title": "National Briefing  New England: Maine: Limit To Questions On Citizenship", "body": "\nGov. John Baldacci has signed an executive order limiting the circumstances in which state employees can ask \nabout the immigration status of residents seeking services. The order allows employees to ask about the status only \nin specific situations: when such disclosure is required by law, for example, or when the resident is suspected of \nunlawful activity other than being in the country illegally. Mr. Baldacci, a Democrat, signed the order after meetings \nwith social service, civil rights and community organizations. The sessions were held to help ease relations between \nthe groups and state officials after Border Patrol agents swept through stores, restaurants and a homeless shelter \nin Portland in January.
