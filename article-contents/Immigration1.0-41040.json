{"title": "SECOND JUDGE BLOCKS CALIFORNIA MEASURE AGAINST ILLEGAL ALIENS", "body": "\nA federal judge blocked on Wednesday California's voter-approved measure to deny almost all state services to \nillegal aliens. The judge said the measure appeared to conflict with the federal government's authority.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer granted a preliminary injunction blocking almost all of Proposition 187's bans \nagainst allowing illegal aliens to use public schools, public health services and public social services.\n\nPfaelzer let stand two of the proposition's more minor provisions: one prohibiting illegal immigrants from attending \nstate colleges and another banning the sale and use of false immigration documents.\n\nThe judge said the measure, approved by 59 percent of California voters on Nov. 8, denied health and social \nservices to some immigrants who might be entitled to receive them under federal law. It could also pressure some \nimmigrants into leaving the country when they had the right to remain, Pfaelzer said.\n\nThe judge said only the federal government had the authority to determine who could enter and remain in the \nUnited States.\n\nMost major provisions of Proposition 187 were already on hold as a result of a temporary restraining order issued \nby another federal judge last month. But Wednesday's decision goes one step further: She issued a preliminary \ninjunction, which remains in effect until a trial can resolve disputed facts in the case.\n\nThe judge said the health care provision, in particular, had serious implications because it could put the public \nhealth at risk.\n"}
