{"title": "United States/Cuba: Trump Administration Ramps up Deportations to Cuba", "body": "\nAfter seeking asylum in the United States at the Mexican border, Pablo Sanchez was placed in a detention center \nand is now facing what has become an increasingly common scenario under President Donald Trump: deportation \nto Cuba.\n\nSince the end of the Obama administration, the number of Cubans deported from the U.S. has increased more \nthan tenfold to more than 800 in the past year as the Trump administration enforces a new policy inked just days \nbefore it took over. It is also imposing its own sharp limits on who is eligible for asylum. That's an unwelcome \ndevelopment for growing numbers of asylum-seeking Cubans who had long benefited from a generous U.S. \napproach and their government's unwillingness to take its people back.\n\nFor decades, Cubans fleeing the communist-governed island had for the most part enjoyed unique privileges. Even \nafter the cold war ended, they were given a certain path to legal residence once they touched U.S. soil through the \npolicy known as wet foot, dry foot.\n\nNo more wet foot, dry foot\n\nBut an agreement reached during the final days of the Obama administration ended that and required Cuba to take \nback citizens who receive deportation orders going forward and consider on a case-by-case basis the return of the \nthousands of other Cubans who had received such orders over the decades but remained in the U.S. because their \ncountry wouldn't take them back.\n\nSince Trump took office, more Cubans arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border have encountered new limits, including a \npolicy introduced last month that denies protection to asylum seekers who have passed through another country \nbefore reaching Mexico and have not sought asylum there.\n\nDespite the new agreement, Cuba remains reluctant to take its people back, and is one of 10 countries that the U.S. \ngovernment labels recalcitrant. That makes it difficult for the administration to enforce its aggressive measures \nagainst asylum - and leaves many Cubans in limbo.\n\nMany, like Sanchez, are baffled by their predicament.\n\nSanchez is married to Barbara Rodriguez, a naturalized U.S. citizen who lives in Miami, but was unable to apply for \na visa in Cuba to join his wife in the U.S. because the Trump administration pulled most of its embassy staff out, \noutsourcing family-related visa petitions to consular services in Colombia or Guyana. Rodriguez claims Sanchez \nwas facing increasing political persecution after having brushes with local authorities over such episodes as \ndamaging a referendum ballot as a sign of protest.\n\nThe couple agreed he had to get out of Cuba, saying they had learned he was being investigated and could face jail \ntime. Feeling they had no time to waste - and with no visa services available in Cuba - Sanchez traveled to \n\n\nNicaragua and through Mexico to seek asylum in the U.S., at a port of entry where authorities detained him and \nlater sent him to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for long-term custody.\n\nThis is plain cruel, despite arriving in this country and demonstrating that you are persecuted and that you have \ncredible fear. After all, this gets thrown away, said his wife, Rodriguez, who talks to Sanchez on the phone daily. \nThe worse thing is that now I feel all that is left for him is deportation.\n\nCuban welcome mat?\n\nIt is unclear how the Cuban government treats people who are deported from the U.S., but rights advocates and \nlawyers say they could face retaliation for claiming asylum, especially those who claimed they were being \npersecuted. By contrast, deportees to Mexico and Central American countries typically get a warm welcome home.\n\nCuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla told The Associated Press the increase in deportations stems \nfrom the country diligently fulfilling its commitments outlined in the accord with the Obama administration, but at the \nsame time he blasted the U.S. for cutting consular services in Havana.\n\nIt is a shame to politicize the human bond between people and between nations, he said.\n\nA chartered U.S. government flight landed in Havana on Sept. 27 with 96 Cubans aboard, and another with 120 \narrived Aug. 30. U.S. officials say Cuba's acceptance of this limited number of deportees is a small step, but they \nbelieve the nation is still largely unwilling to work with the U.S. on repatriations. They note 39,243 Cubans living in \nthe U.S. with deportation orders.\n\nCuba is kind of a thorn in their side in this area, said Julia Gelatt, senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration \nPolicy Institute.\n\nCuba remains on a U.S. government list of recalcitrant nations with nine other countries: China, Vietnam, Iran, \nBhutan, Cambodia, Eritrea, Hong Kong, Laos and Pakistan.\n\nThousands seeking asylum\n\nAbout 21,000 Cubans have presented themselves to officials at U.S.-Mexico crossings since last October, triple the \nnumber seen the previous 12 months, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection statistics.\n\nThousands more Cubans have been stranded in northern Mexico cities on wait lists to request asylum and through \na program that forces migrants to wait south of the border for their asylum cases to play out.\n\nOf the Cubans who have been allowed into the U.S., many have been released from custody while they await court \ndates for their asylum cases, but hundreds have been turned over to ICE custody.\n\nAbout 5,000 Cubans have received deportation orders since the new U.S.-Cuba agreement, and 1,300 of them \nhave been deported, according to ICE data.\n\nLuis Dayan Palmero left Cuba in April, traveling from Guyana to Brazil and Colombia, before passing through \nCentral America and arriving in northern Mexico in August.\n\nHe crossed the Rio Grande and surrendered to Border Patrol agents, who sent him to Matamoros, Mexico. He now \nhas a U.S. court appearing set this month.\n\nI plan to ask for asylum, and whatever happens is what God wants, Palmero said. - VOA\n"}
