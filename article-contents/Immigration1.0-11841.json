{"title": "PROFESSOR TALKS ABOUT FREE SPEECH", "body": "\nDavid Cole, above, a professor from the Georgetown University Law Center, spoke Thursday night at the \nUniversity of South Florida about free speech, academic freedom and civil liberties in a post-Sept. 11 world. He \ntold the audience of about 75 people that America seems willing to sacrifice the rights of immigrants, especially \nArab immigrants, in the name of increased security.\n4*BRIEFS29Even Arabs with no alleged link to the Sept. 11 attacks, such as former USF instructor Mazen Al-Najjar \nand suspended professor Sami Al-Arian, have been caught up in that wave, he said. \"We have not sacrificed our \nown liberties but the liberties of immigrants,\" said Cole, who helped represent Al-Najjar during his ongoing battles \nwith the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Al-Najjar is currently in prison.\n\nCase over Tampa adult video settled\n\nAdam Glasser, the California pornographer who faced obscenity charges for a video he made in a Tampa hotel \nroom, will not go to jail.\n\nLast week as the case was set to go to trial, the Los Angeles County City Attorney's Office agreed to drop obscenity \ncharges against Glasser and his mother, who acts as his bookkeeper.\n\nIn exchange, Glasser's company, Big Brown Eyes Inc., pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of creating a public \nnuisance. Glasser also agreed to pay a $ 1,000 fine and put a warning label on the film, said George Cardona, chief \nof the criminal division of the Los Angeles city attorney's office.\n\nThe charges stemmed from the film Tampa Tushy-Fest, Part I, which Glasser made. Glasser and his mother could \nhave faced 720 days in jail.\n\nGraphic\n\n \n\nPHOTO, THOMAS M. GOETHE; David Cole, a professor from the Georgetown University Law Center\n"}
