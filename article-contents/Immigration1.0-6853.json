{"title": "7 JORDANIANS HELD AT CANADIAN BORDER ARE CLEARED OF TERRORISM", "body": "\nSeven Jordanians were arrested at the Canadian border on what officials Monday called routine illegal \nimmigration charges - not terrorist suspicions, as originally announced.\n\nThree men, two women and two children were taken into custody by U.S. officials Sunday afternoon near the \ncheckpoint at Blaine, Wash.\nThe crossing was shut down for more than two hours.\n\nOne of the women, who was with a toddler and was in Canada legally, had left her car at a duty-free shop on the \nCanadian side and walked across the border without stopping at a checkpoint, authorities said.\n\nU.S. Border officials picked her up and then found five other people who were waiting to meet her - three men, a \nwoman and a baby, said Sharon Gavin, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. They were \narrested for overstaying their visas, authorities said.\n\n\"She was apparently coming over to meet up with her husband,\" Gavin said. \"It now looks like a routine smuggling \ncase and trying to reunite a family.\"\n\nHours after the arrests, Constable Archie Alafriz of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police reported that at least one \nof the men who was arrested \"had an affiliation with a known terrorist group.\"\n\nBut the FBI said Monday that authorities had misinterpreted a criminal record in Philadelphia.\n\n\"It looks like, in reviewing that record, it is in connection with assault or domestic violence,\" FBI agent Roberta \nBurroughs said.     \n"}
