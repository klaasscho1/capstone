{"title": "When Parents Are Deported", "body": "\nTo the Editor:\n\n''Deporting Parents Hurts Kids,'' by Hirokazu Yoshikawa and Carola Suarez-Orozco (Op-Ed, April 21), highlights \nthe trauma of children whose parents are deported. Every day, thousands of detained and deported immigrant \nparents live in fear of permanent separation from their children. This is especially true when children enter the child \nwelfare system because their parents are in immigration custody.\n\nI have talked to countless detained parents with children in child welfare care, and most tell me that they would \naccept deportation if they knew they could preserve their relationship with their children. But immigration and child \nwelfare laws and practices do not facilitate this, prompting many parents to return to the United States after \ndeportation in an effort to reunite with their children.\n\nCongress and the administration must enact policies that uphold immigrant parents' parental rights. Such policies \nwould be both humane and effective, while honoring the family values that this country holds in high regard.\n\nEMILY BUTERA Senior Program Officer, Detention and Asylum, Women's Refugee Commission Washington, April \n22, 2012\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com\n"}
