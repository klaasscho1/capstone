He told the judge he was addicted to \npornography and had a \"sexual problem.\" He later said he had been a sexual abuse victim as a child, but the judge \ncut him off.\n\nThe deal comes more than a month after a statement issued on behalf of the women said they were \"hopeful for a \njust and prompt resolution\" and had \"great faith in the prosecutor's office and the court.\"\n\n- Associated Press\n\n          California          Mayor to get therapy but will stay in office          \n\nApologizing for \"intimidating conduct,\" embattled San Diego Mayor Bob Filner (D) on Friday said he plans to enter a \n\"behavior counseling clinic\" for two weeks of therapy beginning Aug. 5. But he vowed to remain in office, even as \nhe faced a flurry of calls from top Democrats to step aside, amid allegations he sexually harassed several women.\n\nFilner apologized in general terms for inappropriate conduct toward women without acknowledging any specific \nbehavior. \"I apologize to the women I have offended,\" he said.\n\nThe brief news conference was halted temporarily by what appeared to be audio trouble. Filner restarted his \nremarks minutes later, but fielded no questions.\n\n- Sean Sullivan\n"}
