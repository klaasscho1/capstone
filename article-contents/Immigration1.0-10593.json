The IOC issues Olympic identity cards, which are accepted in place of \nvisas.\n\n\"We understand that after such a tragedy the authorities of the United States review all the security plans, \nincluding access,\" Carrard said. \"We have recalled that the universality of the Games should be respected . . . and \nthat those athletes who are bona fide athletes, who are qualified, should be granted access.\"\n\nRomney briefed the IOC on security changes for the Feb. 8-24 Games that likely will include more fences at venues \nand tighter security at athletes' housing and the IOC's headquarters hotel.\n\nSalt Lake safety commanders are fully reviewing plans after the Sept. 11 attacks in New York and Washington.\n\nIn Lausanne, the IOC expressed confidence in Salt Lake's \"very robust\" security plans and said no major changes \nor substantial amounts of money are needed. The group also gave its approval to add women's wrestling for the \n2004 Olympics in Athens.\n\nRomney said he did not want to spend time contemplating the scenario of an airliner loaded with fuel crashing into \na stadium during Olympic ceremonies. That scenario, IOC officials revealed Tuesday, has long been a part of \nOlympic safety planning.\n\nThe IOC has ordered a report on whether it could be held financially or legally liable for any terrorism during the \nOlympics. It appears liability would fall on Olympic cities and organizing committees, which take full responsibility \nfor staging the Games, Romney said.\n\n\nThe Salt Lake Organizing Committee is \"on the hook for any terrorism act that we have not prepared for,\" Romney \nsaid, but \"we're not spending our time worrying about it.\"\n\nUtah safety commanders plan to establish a no-fly zone over the Olympic venues, and Romney said the U.S. \nmilitary had the capability to \"intercept\" any errant flights.\n\nRomney was reluctant to contemplate the possibility that the Games might have to be called off if the United States \nand allies find themselves in a sustained war against terrorism or rogue states.\n\n\"It's our job to plan for the Games,\" Romney said. \"I don't even want to think about the unthinkable.\"\n\nAlthough the IOC approved adding women's wrestling for the 2004 Athens Games, the move is not a certainty \nbecause the addition is tied to a cut in men's wrestling events.\n\nThe action reflected a drive by new IOC President Jacques Rogge to control the size of the Olympics. Under the \nprevious president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, the number of sports and athletes grew steadily without any \nsignificant cuts.\n\n\"This is the first time we don't increase the number of events on the program,\" IOC sports director Gilbert Felli said.\n\nIn the continuing effort to increase female participation in the Olympics, the IOC gave its approval to the addition of \nfour women's events in wrestling. But, in return, two men's wrestling events would have to be cut.\n\nFelli said the international wrestling federation may not agree to the reduction.\n\nOf the 28 sports on the Olympic program, boxing and baseball would be the only ones left without women's events. \nHowever, women's softball has been played since 1996.\n\nThe most significant cut proposed was in boxing, with the elimination of one weight division, a total of 26 boxers.\n"}
