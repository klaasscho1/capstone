{"title": "Washington: PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3003, NO SANCTUARY FOR CRIMINALS ACT", "body": "\nWashington: The Library of Congress, The Government of USA has issued the following house proceeding:  \n\n Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 414 \nand ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: H. Res. 414 Resolved, That upon \nadoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3003) to amend the \nImmigration and Nationality Act to modify provisions relating to assistance by States, and political subdivision of \nStates, in the enforcement of Federal immigration laws, and for other purposes. \n\nAll points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All points of \norder against provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and \non any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally \ndivided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary; and (2) one \nmotion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. \nCOLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the \ngentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. General Leave Mr. COLLINS of \nGeorgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise \nand extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on House Resolution 414, currently under \nconsideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There \nwas no objection. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to bring this rule forward on behalf of \nthe Rules Committee. The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. The \nrule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided between the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee. The rule also provides for a motion to recommit. Yesterday, the Rules Committee had the opportunity to \nhear from my fellow Judiciary Committee members Mr. Johnson of Louisiana and Ms. Lofgren of California. H.R. \n3003 received consideration by the Judiciary Committee as part of a larger bill, the Michael Davis, Jr. and Danny \nOliver in Honor of State and Local Law Enforcement Act. That legislation was marked up and ordered reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee on May 24. As a cosponsor and strong advocate of the Davis-Oliver Act, I supported the \npassage of legislation before the full House. Today we have the opportunity to move an important piece of that bill \nforward and to strengthen our policies against jurisdictions that flout America's laws. Mr. Speaker, the No \nSanctuary for Criminals Act is just simply common sense. John Adams said that we are a government of laws, not \nof men. As we approach the Fourth of July week, we recognize that America's foundation is that of the rule of law. \nYet too often we have seen local jurisdictions ignore Federal immigration law and declare themselves sanctuary \n\n\ncities, as though their actions have no consequences for their law-abiding neighbors. The reality, however, is that \nthe localities that refuse to enforce Federal immigration law undermine public safety and break the democratic \ncontract. Mr. Speaker, the sanctuary cities do not act in a vacuum. They endanger lives and set dangerous \nprecedent. {time} 1230 To many people, it would seem obvious that local and State law enforcement should comply \nwith Federal immigration laws and cooperate with its fair enforcement by communicating openly with Federal \nofficials. It would also seem clear that jurisdictions that ignore these laws should forfeit the Federal funds set aside \nto support compliance with those same laws. Despite this, sanctuary cities oppose Federal immigration officials \nroutinely. These men and women find themselves handicapped by local officials implementing obstructionist \npolicies. In light of this, Mr. Speaker, I believe we need to better protect our communities by ensuring our laws are \nfollowed. H.R. 3003 takes steps do that. I thank Chairman Goodlatte, Congressman King, and Congressman Biggs \nfor their work on the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. These Members are colleagues of mine on the Judiciary \nCommittee, and they recognize the need to respond to the continuing problem of sanctuary cities with resolve, \nwith confidence that Federal immigration laws safeguard every American community and apply equally to every \nAmerican community. The underlying bill provided for by this rule also includes legislation offered by Mr. King--\nSarah's and Grant's Law. Sarah's and Grant's Law is named after two individuals, Sarah Root and Grant \nRonnebeck, who were tragically killed by unlawful immigrants. The unlawful immigrants were released and remain \nat large, and the Root and Ronnebeck families were left to grieve unspeakable losses while the lawlessness \ncontinues. It is past time for us to take action to combat dangerous sanctuary policies. We are a nation of laws and \nwe need to act like it. While there is no uniform definition of sanctuary cities, and no comprehensive or official list \nof these jurisdictions, we have, regrettably, become all too familiar with them. So-called sanctuary cities are those \njurisdictions that obstruct immigration enforcement through noncompliance with detainers. They construct \nunreasonable hurdles to compliance and create barriers to communication between Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement and local personnel. We understand that ICE has a job to do and that its officers took oaths to uphold \nthose duties. Opponents will claim that this bill is unnecessary because ICE has the jurisdiction it needs. The truth \nis, sanctuary policies make the ICE agents' jobs more difficult, more dangerous, and endanger communities. While \nthe previous administration frequently flouted immigration laws and, for far too long, took a rain check on holding \nsanctuary cities accountable, even former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson agreed that \nsanctuary cities shouldn't simply be allowed to decline to cooperate with Federal Government authorities. In fact, \nhe said in 2015 that it is ``not acceptable to have no policy of cooperation with immigration enforcement.'' Mr. \nSpeaker, faithfulness to the law isn't like being offered a cup of coffee. You can't look at the Federal statutes and \nsay: You know, no thanks, but I appreciate you offering. H.R. 3003 confirms that this option is not on the table. \nWhile I agree with former Secretary Johnson that we must have a policy of cooperation, the policies of the former \nadministration too frequently didn't indicate a commitment to that goal. In fact, State and local jurisdictions ignored \nmore than 12,000 Federal detainer requests in 2014. Now is the time for action. Thankfully, President Trump issued \nan executive order directing the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and ICE to ensure \nthat sanctuary jurisdictions are ineligible for Federal grants and are subject to enforcement actions. The President \nalso charged these agencies with reporting on jurisdictions that have refused to comply with detainers to hold \ncriminal aliens. The first week this report was issued, it showed 206 known instances in which local personnel \ndeclined ICE detainers and released criminal aliens. These aliens reentered the communities after they had \ncommitted crimes such as assault, aggravated assault or battery, driving under the influence, or domestic violence \nabuses. The reports indicate that we have work to do, but it helps us by identifying jurisdictions where personnel are \n[[Page H5245]] thwarting Federal law. It throws into relief the glaring problem of sanctuary cities and provides \ninformation that law enforcement and lawmakers can use as we assess the problem and develop meaningful \nsolutions. Mr. Speaker, I was in the Georgia State House when we took action there to address the issue of \nsanctuary cities. In 2009, we in Georgia outlawed sanctuary cities in our State. Last year, the legislature went \nfurther by requiring local governments to certify their cooperation with immigration officials in order to receive State \nfunds. Today we have a chance to take a step in a positive direction on the Federal level. The No Sanctuary for \nCriminals Act prohibits States and localities from implementing policies that restrict law enforcement agencies from \ncooperating with immigration laws and officials. It gives teeth to that restriction by tying eligibility for certain \nDepartment of Justice and Homeland Security grants to State and local compliance with existing immigration \nlaws. The bill requires that there will be probable cause before ICE can issue a detainer, and focuses on grant \nprograms reasonably related to the scope of the bill. Importantly, this bill also calls for aliens to be detained if the \nalien is engaged in a crime that caused death or serious injury to another person. Had this provision been law at \n\n\n\nthe time, it could have helped prevent what happened in the heartbreaking death of Sarah Root, where an alien \nwho caused her death was freed on bond and remains at large. The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act also takes the \ncommonsense step of allowing DHS to withhold aliens rather than transferring them to sanctuary jurisdictions, \neven if the jurisdiction has a warrant. It simply doesn't make sense for DHS to transfer aliens who are removable \nunder the law to jurisdictions that are looking for opportunities to let them go. Mr. Speaker, I cannot talk about \nholding sanctuary cities accountable by strengthening our laws without mentioning the work of Chairman John \nCulberson. In 2016, Chairman Culberson successfully convinced the Department of Justice to update guidelines in \norder to disqualify sanctuary cities from receiving DOJ grant money should they be found in violation of title 8 U.S. \nCode, section 1373. Attorney General Sessions has reiterated that Federal law enforcement grants are contingent \non compliance with existing law, and that the DOJ will deny fiscal year 2017 grant funds to jurisdictions that have \nrefused to share information regarding illegal aliens in their custody. Chairman Culberson's efforts made clear that \nState and local law enforcement agencies are expected to work with Federal law enforcement agencies on \nimmigration matters. Through his diligent work, meaningful steps have been taken to restore accountability. The \nNo Sanctuary for Criminals Act builds on these efforts and ensures that jurisdictions comply with the detainers \nwhile strengthening our law to ensure that aliens who have been committing crimes such as drunk driving are \ndetained pending their removal. H.R. 3003 permits the Secretary of DHS to issue a detainer for any individual \narrested for violation of a criminal or motor vehicle law upon probable cause that an individual is an inadmissible or \ndeportable alien. In this critically important step, the bill grants immunity to State and local entities for compliance \nwith any detainer. Jurisdictions that want to act in good faith and follow the law should be able to cooperate without \nbeing held liable for their compliance. The protections provided in this bill are a major step forward to effective \nenforcement. Finally, this bill gives victims and their families a private right of action against a State and local \ngovernment whose noncompliance and release of an alien results in a murder, rape, or serious injury of the victim. \nThis measure, were it law, would have allowed Kate Steinle's family to sue after her tragic murder at the hands of a \ncriminal and unlawful immigrant. Sanctuary cities and jurisdictions ignore the law. They do it at the expense of the \nAmerican people. Our citizens surely deserve better. They deserve to live in communities that don't let dangerous \ncriminals back out into the streets. They deserve to see the law upheld rather than ignored. Law-abiding citizens \ndeserve to see individuals who break our laws--not only by entering and residing in our country illegally, but by \ncommitting crimes once here--to be removed. This rule provides for the consideration of legislation to strengthen \nthe rule of law and to protect our neighbors and communities. It demands that jurisdictions comply with our Nation's \nimmigration laws and enforcement or face penalties. Today we can take action to turn off the spigot of Federal \nfunds to those jurisdictions that obstruct ICE efforts at the expense of Americans. We demonstrate that Members of \nthis House will not sit idly by while sanctuary cities continue flouting the laws of our land with impunity. We \nstrengthen our detainer policy, enable ICE to do its job, and, at the same time, help protect our communities. Mr. \nSpeaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nCollins) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. (Mr. \nMcGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I \nrise today in strong opposition to this closed rule, and in strong opposition to the underlying bill, H.R.\n\n 3003. Mr. Speaker, today the House will consider its 37th closed rule for the year, and tomorrow it will take up \nnumber 38. My Republican friends are breaking all kinds of records here. While I often wonder just why the \nRepublican leadership is so afraid of open debate in the United States House of Representatives, I do recognize \nthat it goes right along with the Republican majority's complete rejection of regular order. The House of \nRepresentatives, I am sad to say, has ceased being a deliberative body where important issues are debated freely. \nThe Republican leadership has shut this place down, and this is yet another example of it. Look up the history of the \nbill the House will debate later today or tomorrow, H.R. 3003, the so-called No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. It was \nintroduced on June 22. That was last Thursday. Like its 2015 predecessor, it has had no hearings, no markup, no \ninput from local law enforcement, no regular order. No one had a chance to testify about this bill. Not the U.S. \nConference of Mayors that includes the mayors of over 1,000 cities and towns, Democrat and Republican alike, \nwho represent over 150 million people. Not the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic Charities, Church \nWorld Service, and religious and faith leaders from all across the land. Not the National Fraternal Order of Police, \nthe Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force, or the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence. \nNot the NAACP, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the YWCA, or hundreds of national civil rights, human rights, \nlabor, immigration, and humanitarian organizations. Mr. Speaker, on a bill that would affect hundreds of cities and \n\n\n\ntowns and counties across America, why wouldn't we want to hear the views of these important law enforcement, \nState and local government, religious, civil society, and victims' organizations? The answer is simple, Mr. Speaker. \nBecause they all oppose this legislation. All of them. It is much easier for Republicans to close down the process \nand steamroll this terrible bill through Congress than to actually get feedback from the American people and the \nleaders charged with keeping them safe. If you are going to pass a bill that has so much public opposition, I guess it \nmakes sense to do it quickly and with as little debate as possible. Welcome to the House of Representatives, Mr. \nSpeaker, where the voices of the American people are shut out as Republicans continue to ram through their \nradical agenda. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3003 does nothing to advance cooperation between local law enforcement with \nthe Federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement. [[Page H5246]] Cooperation between local and Federal \nagencies to apprehend, try, and punish serious criminal offenders, and in the case of foreign nationals, to imprison \nand then deport them, has always been a high priority. These are matters of national security. But instead of \ncontinuing to foster cooperation and strengthen this priority, this bill chooses to blackmail, coerce, and penalize \nlocal law enforcement agencies and demand that they potentially violate the Constitution of the United States, in \nparticular the Fourth Amendment, the 10th Amendment, and the 14th amendment. I wish my Republican friends \nwere as faithful to the rights enshrined in these amendments of the Bill of Rights as they are to the Second \nAmendment, but then that is a whole other debate. And let's think about this for a minute. What are they proposing \nto do? For communities and local law enforcement that believe that doing what this bill asks them to do would \nmake it more difficult for them to do local policing, and would make it more difficult for them to have the trust of \nmembers in their community to report crimes. What my Republican friends propose to do is take away important \nFederal funding to help keep these communities safe. What are we talking about here? I think it is important for \npeople to understand this. Programs like the COPS programs, the Community Oriented Policing Services; the \nState Criminal Alien Assistance Program; the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant program; and national security \nprograms, those things would be taken away from local communities. It doesn't make any sense. For example, the \nBynre JAG is a major source of criminal justice funding for local law enforcement and provided $275 million in fiscal \nyear 2016 for prevention and education programs, drug treatment and enforcement, crime victim and witness \ninitiatives, and other community- based programs. Other funding programs and grants that are threatened under \nthis bill are used to address sexual assault, gang violence, and trafficking such as the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, \nthe Violent Gang and Gun Crime Reduction Program, and the Reach and Evaluation on Trafficking in Persons \nprogram. Maybe nobody read what this bill does before they brought it to the floor. I just don't understand the logic \nof basically trying to blackmail communities by taking away important funding that is designed to protect the citizens \nof various communities across this country. Mr. Speaker, this so-called sanctuary cities bill, as I mentioned, \nthreatens to strip local jurisdictions of Federal grants and funding. It specifically targets law enforcement, \ncounterterrorism, and national security grants when they prioritize working with immigrant communities to keep our \nneighbors and cities and towns safe. {time} 1245 I don't think Washington knows best all the time, unlike my \nRepublican colleagues. I trust my local police departments on this issue more than I trust my friends on the other \nside of the aisle. Republicans would rather demonize these cities, towns, and local police agencies and force them \nto squander scarce local resources on immigration enforcement instead of local policing, making our cities and \nour communities less safe, not more safe. This is why law enforcement and city governments oppose this bill. It \ndeliberately and cynically undermines their ability to protect their communities, nurture public trust in the police and \nour legal system, and strengthen public safety. Mr. Speaker, this bill reeks of prejudice. It isn't meant to solve any \nproblem. It is meant to punish cities that don't embrace the radical views of the anti-immigrant rightwing of the \nRepublican Party. It is meant to demonize all immigrants as criminals. It is meant to turn our local police into the \nlackeys of ICE. Mr. Speaker, this House continues to wait and wait and wait for the Republican majority to show \nsome leadership and bring up a comprehensive immigration reform bill. It has been more than 4 years since the \nSenate passed a strong, bipartisan immigration reform bill, and we are still waiting for House Republicans to step \nup and act, to actually try to solve a problem rather than continue to divide our country and continue to act in a way \nthat is polarizing. What we need is a way to bring 11 million of our neighbors, friends, colleagues, small-business \nowners, and hardworking residents out of the shadows. That is what makes America stronger. That is why 9 out of \n10 Americans support immigration reform that creates a path to citizenship for the undocumented, according to a \nMarch 2017 poll by CNN/ORC. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the article about the poll. [From cnn.com , Mar. \n17, 2017] CNN/ORC Poll: Americans Break With Trump on Immigration Policy (By Tal Kopan and Jennifer \nAgiesta) Washington (CNN).--Americans disagree with President Donald Trump's immigration priorities, according \nto a new CNN/ORC poll, with nearly two-thirds of Americans saying they'd like to see a path to legal status for \n\n\n\nundocumented immigrants rather than deportations. Trump has made tough border security and strict enforcement \nof US immigration laws a focal point of his campaign and presidency--using some of his first executive orders to \npave the way for far more deportations and detentions as well as ordering the construction of a Southern border \nwall. But a CNN/ORC poll released Friday finds that the public is actually moving in the opposite direction since \nTrump has won election. Americans are more likely to say that the nation's top immigration priority should be to \nallow those in the US illegally to gain legal status--and six in 10 say they are more concerned that deportation \nefforts will be overzealous than they are that dangerous criminals will be overlooked. All told, 60% say the \ngovernment's top priority in dealing with illegal immigration should be developing a plan to allow those in the US \nillegally who have jobs to become legal residents. In contrast, 26% say developing a plan to stop illegal border \ncrossings should be the top priority and 13% say deportation of those in the US illegally should be the first priority. \nThe number who prioritize legal status for those working in the US illegally is up from 51% who said so last fall. \nThat shift comes across party lines, with Democrats and independents each 10 points more likely and Republicans \n8 points more likely to choose a plan for legal status now compared with last fall. While Trump campaigned heavily \nagainst ``amnesty'' for undocumented immigrants, he has avoided rescinding an Obama administration program \noffering protections and work permits to those who were brought to the US as children, and in a recent meeting with \nreporters a senior administration official indicated Trump could be open to a compromise that included a path to \nlegalization, if not citizenship, if it came to his desk. Trump told Congress in his joint address last month that he \nsupported the idea of an immigration reform compromise, but offered few details. Offering citizenship to those \nimmigrants who are living in the US illegally but hold a job, speak English and are willing to pay back taxes is \nimmensely popular, with 90% behind such a plan. That's consistent across party lines, with 96% of Democrats, 89% \nof independents and 87% of Republicans behind it. The President has described his immigration policies as \nfocused on removing criminals, though critics of his administration say enforcement agencies' definition of criminal \nis too expansive and sweeps up people who only broke immigration laws. He has also ordered the creation of \noffices and reports focused on publicizing victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. Americans \nsay, however, they are more concerned about the effects of deportations than they are about immigrant crimes. \nOverall, 58% say they're more concerned that deportation efforts will go too far and result in deportation of people \nwho haven't committed serious crimes, while 40% say they're more concerned that those efforts will not go far \nenough and dangerous criminals will remain in the US. That number is largely driven by Democrats--more than two-\nthirds of Republicans say they are concerned efforts won't go far enough. As for deportation priorities, seven in 10 \nsay the government should not attempt to deport all immigrants living in the country illegally, up from 66% in the fall. \nA wide majority, nearly eight in 10, support deporting undocumented immigrants who have committed other crimes, \nhowever, an area Trump says is his focus. There has been a small uptick, nevertheless, in the share who say the \ngovernment shouldn't be deporting those living in the US illegally who have been convicted of other crimes, from \n15% to 19%. Opinions vary by party on both of these questions, though majorities across party lines are on the \nsame side of both arguments. Among Republicans, 55% oppose attempts to deport all people living in the US \nillegally, below the 86% of Democrats and 71% of independents who feel that way. Considering deportation of \nthose in the country illegally [[Page H5247]] who have been convicted of other crimes, 64% of Democrats favor that, \nbelow the 79% of independents and 93% of Republicans who say the same. CNN/ORC interviewed 1,025 \nAmerican adults by phone from March 1 to 4 for the poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage \npoints. Results by party have a margin of error of plus or minus 6 points. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, instead of \nworking together to find commonsense solutions to immigration, the Republican leadership offers extreme, \ndeportation-only bills that undermine public safety and hurt our communities. Let them register; let them pay a fine; \nlet them be documented and not fear talking with the police; and let us recognize their many contributions to \ncommunities across America. These are our friends, our colleagues, and our neighbors. Our kids go to school \ntogether. We shop at the same grocery stores and eat at the same restaurants. We serve together on the PTA and \nworship together at church. Our country is strongest when we lift up our neighbors. This bill will only drive us apart. \nMr. Speaker, this bill is just more of the same old divisive Republican anti-immigrant formula. It will sow fear among \nthe immigrant community, regardless of their status; it will tear families apart; it will subvert public trust of local law \nenforcement and police; and it will undermine the Constitution of the United States. Mr. Speaker, America is better \nthan this. I urge my colleagues to reject this closed rule and to oppose the underlying bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the \nbalance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. \nSpeaker, again, I respect my friend from Massachusetts a great deal. I am not sure what is subversive to the \nConstitution in upholding the law. When we deal with this issue, it is about a choice. We can talk about local law \n\n\n\nenforcement and we can talk about cities that do not want to do this, but they are making the choice here. It is time \nwe hold people accountable for choices. I think it is really interesting that we mentioned the State Criminal Alien \nAssistance Program, which, by the way, was meant to reimburse localities for holding illegal immigrants. If they are \nnot holding them, then why do they need the money to start with? So let's at least put it in perspective here. I can \ntalk about immigration reform. I believe there is a lot that we can do in that. I agree with the gentleman. However, I \ndisagree in the part here, why don't we enforce the law that is here? By the way, that is currently the law under \nboth President Obama and President Trump. Under U.S. Code section 1373, in order to get Federal money, they \nhave to comply with this section. This simply builds upon what we have already done. So I think it is a choice here. I \nthink making it out to be anything other than a choice that the localities have made is really trying to subvert the \nprocess and discuss another issue. We can do that all we want. That is what ended up, a lot of times, happening in \nthis rule debate. But at the end of the day, this is about simply enforcing the law. I think if you go to places all over \nthe country and you begin to ask them just a simple question and start it off with this, ``Don't you think we ought to \nenforce the law?'' the answer you get over 90 percent of the time is yes. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. It is clear that the laws aren't \nworking. That is why we need comprehensive immigration reform, and that is why it is so unfortunate that the \nRepublicans in this House have stalled on that issue. We had bipartisan support a few years ago for \ncomprehensive immigration reform, but people here, for some reason, would rather just demagogue the issue than \ndo something about it. As I said before, I actually trust my local officials, my local police, more than I do my \nRepublican friends who are speaking here today and who spoke in the Rules Committee last night. Mr. Speaker, I \ninclude in the Record a letter to all of us from the National Fraternal Order of Police, which is strongly opposed to \nthis bill; a letter to all of us from The United States Conference of Mayors, which is strongly opposed to all of this; a \nletter to all of us from the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force, which is strongly opposed to this bill; and a \nletter to all of us from Cities for Action, which is strongly opposed to this bill. National Fraternal Order of Police, \nWashington, DC, June 27, 2017. Hon. Paul D. Ryan, Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, \nWashington, DC. Hon. Kevin O. McCarthy, Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. \nNancy P. Pelosi, Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Steny H. Hoyer, Minority Whip, \nHouse of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Speaker and Representatives McCarthy, Pelosi and Hoyer: I \nam writing on behalf of the members of the Fraternal Order of Police to reiterate the FOP's opposition to any \namendment or piece of legislation that would penalize law enforcement agencies by withholding Federal funding or \nresources from law enforcement assistance programs in an effort to coerce a policy change at the local level. The \nHouse will consider H.R. 3003 on the floor this week and Section 2 of this bill would restrict the hiring program \nadministered by the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice \nAssistance Grant (Byrne-JAG) programs, as well as programs administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity. The FOP has been very clear on this issue: we strongly believe that local and State law enforcement \nagencies should cooperate with their Federal counterparts. That being said, withholding needed assistance to law \nenforcement agencies-- which have no policymaking role--also hurts public safety efforts. Local police departments \nanswer to local civilian government and it is the local government which enacts statutes and ordinances in their \ncommunities. Law enforcement officers have no more say in these matters than any other citizen and--with laws \nlike the Hatch Act in place--it can be argued they have less. Law enforcement officers do not get to pick and choose \nwhich laws to enforce, and must carry out lawful orders at the direction of their commanders and the civilian \ngovernment that employs them. It is unjust to penalize law enforcement and the citizens they serve because \nCongress disagrees with their enforcement priorities with respect to our nation's immigration laws. The FOP \nissued a statement in January of this year regarding the approach of the Administration on sanctuary cities as \noutlined in President Trump's Executive Order. The President recognized that it is unfair to penalize the law \nenforcement agencies serving these jurisdictions for the political decisions of local officials. It allows the U.S. \nAttorney General and Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to make an informed decision about \nthe public safety impact without an automatic suspension from Federal grant programs. In Section 2 of H.R. 3003, \nthere is no such discretion and it countermands the Administration's existing policy. The FOP opposed several bills \nin the previous Congress, which were outlined in a letter to the Senate leadership, and we will continue to work \nagainst proposals that would reduce or withhold funding or resources from any Federal program for local and State \nlaw enforcement. If Congress wishes to effect policy changes in these sanctuary cities, it must find another way to \ndo so. On behalf of the more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police, I want to urge the House to \nreject H.R.\n\n\n\n      3003's punitive approach and work with law enforcement to find a better way to improve public safety in our \ncommunities. Please feel free to contact me or my Senior Advisor Jim Pasco in my Washington office if I can be of \nany further assistance. Sincerely, Chuck Canterbury, National President. ____ The United States Conference of \nMayors, Washington, DC, June 26, 2017. Dear Representative: I write to register the strong opposition of the \nnation's mayors to H.R. 3003, a partisan bill that seeks to punish so-called ``sanctuary cities,'' which is expected \nto be considered by the full House this week. The U.S. Conference of Mayors represents well over a thousand \nmayors and nearly 150 million people. Today, we concluded the 85th Annual Meeting of The U.S. Conference of \nMayors and adopted policy that reinforces and builds on previous positions we have taken which oppose provisions \nin this bill. Specifically, the nation's mayors: urge members of Congress to withdraw legislation that attempts to cut \nlocal law enforcement funding necessary to ensure the safety of our communities, indemnify conduct that violates \nthe constitutional rights afforded to both United States citizens and immigrant populations, and further criminalizes \nimmigration and infringes on the rights of immigrant; [[Page H5248]] oppose punitive policies that limit local control \nand discretion, and urge instead that Congress and the Administration pursue immigration enforcement policies \nthat recognize that local law enforcement has limited resources and community trust is critical to local law \nenforcement and the safety of our communities; oppose federal policies that commandeer local law enforcement or \nrequire local UN authorities to violate, or be placed at risk of violating, a person's Fourth Amendment rights; expend \nlimited resources to act as immigration agents; or otherwise assist federal immigration authorities beyond what is \ndetermined by local policy. HR 3003 would do all of these things and more: It would jeopardize public safety by \nwithholding critical public safety funding from jurisdictions that tell their police officers not to ask an individual their \nimmigration status. Many departments have such policies to encourage crime victims and witnesses to report \ncrimes and to build trust with immigrant communities. It would put jurisdictions at risk of violating an individual's \nFourth Amendment rights by establishing probable cause standards for ICE's issuance of detainers that do not \nrequire a judicial determination of probable cause. Numerous federal courts have found that continued detention \nunder an ICE detainer, absent probable cause, would state a claim for a violation of the Fourth Amendment and \nsubject the detaining officer or jurisdiction to civil liability. While it says it would provide immunity to jurisdictions \nwhich comply with detainers and hold them harmless in any suits filed against them, they would still be subject to \nFourth Amendment challenges. Further compelling and expanding compliance with certain enforcement provisions, \nsuch as immigration detainers, and cutting off federal funding to jurisdictions which do not comply with these \nprovisions likely conflict with the Tenth Amendment. H.R. 3003 is a bad bill for our cities and their residents and for \nour nation. It would jeopardize public safety, preempt local authority, and expose local governments to litigation and \npotential findings of damages. America's mayors call on you to do the right thing and vote against H.R. 3003 when \nit is considered on the floor. The U.S. Conference of Mayors urges you instead to focus on positive legislation that \nwill fix our broken immigration system and make our cities safer. The nation's mayors pledge to work with you on \nbipartisan immigration reform legislation that will fix our nation's broken immigration system. We need to move \nbeyond punitive bills like H.R. 3003 and develop an immigration system that works for our nation, our cities and \nour people. To make our cities safer we urge you to consider legislation that will help us to fight crime and prevent \nterrorism. The U.S. Conference of Mayors and the Major Cities Chiefs Association agree that to make the streets of \nAmerica safe, Congress must act to strengthen bonds between communities and police, expand homeland security \ngrants, invest in mental health and substance abuse services, reduce gun violence, and reform the criminal justice \nsystem and strengthen reentry services. Sincerely, Mitchell J. Landrieu, Mayor of New Orleans, President. ____ \nLaw Enforcement Immigration Task Force, June 28, 2017. Dear Member of Congress: As law enforcement \nleaders dedicated to preserving the safety and security of our communities, we have concerns about legislative \nproposals that would attempt to impose punitive, ``one-size-fits-all'' policies on state and local law enforcement. \nRather than strengthening state and local law enforcement by providing us with the tools to work with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) in a manner that is responsive to the needs of our communities, these \nproposals would represent a step backwards. Attempts to defund so-called sanctuary cities regularly sweep too \nbroadly, punishing jurisdictions that engage in well-established community policing practices or adhere to federal \ncourt decisions that have found federal immigration detainers to violate constitutional protections. We oppose \nthese approaches and urge Congress to work to encourage-- rather than compel--law enforcement agency \ncooperation within our federal system. We believe that law enforcement should not cut corners. Multiple federal \ncourts have questioned the legality and constitutionality of federal immigration detainers that are not accompanied \nby a criminal warrant signed by a judge. Even though the legality of such immigration holds is doubtful, some have \nproposed requiring states and localities to enforce them, shielding them from lawsuits. While this approach would \n\n\n\nreduce potential legal liability faced by some jurisdictions and departments, we are concerned these proposals \nwould still require our agencies and officers carry out federal directives that could violate the U.S. Constitution, \nwhich we are sworn to follow. Immigration enforcement is, first and foremost, a federal responsibility. Making our \ncommunities safer means better defining roles and improving relationships between local law enforcement and \nfederal immigration authorities. But in attempting to defund ``sanctuary cities'' and require state and local law \nenforcement to carry out the federal government's immigration enforcement responsibilities, the federal \ngovernment would be substituting its judgment for the judgment of state and local law enforcement agencies. Local \ncontrol has been a beneficial approach for law enforcement for decades--having the federal government compel \nstate and local law enforcement to carry out new and sometimes problematic tasks undermines the delicate federal \nbalance and will harm locally-based policing. Rather than requiring state and local law enforcement agencies to \nengage in additional immigration enforcement activities, Congress should focus on overdue reforms of the broken \nimmigration system to allow state and local law enforcement to focus their resources on true threats-- dangerous \ncriminals and criminal organizations. We believe that state and local law enforcement must work together with \nfederal authorities to protect our communities and that we can best serve our communities by leaving the \nenforcement of immigration laws to the federal government. Threatening the removal of valuable grant funding \nthat contributes to the health and well-being of communities across the nation would not make our communities \nsafer and would not fix any part of our broken immigration system. Our immigration problem is a national problem \ndeserving of a national approach, and we continue to recognize that what our broken system truly needs is a \npermanent legislative solution--broad-based immigration reform.

Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Nancy Pelosi, Minority \nLeader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Members of Congress: Cities for Action (C4A) is a \ncoalition of over 150 mayors and municipal leaders that advocates for policies and programs that promote inclusion \nof foreign-born residents. Our coalition has a deep commitment to promoting public safety and building trust \nbetween law enforcement and immigrant communities. We are writing to you today to urge that you oppose the No \nSanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003. Cities and counties are united in our opposition to Representative \nGoodlatte's bill, which would undermine local public safety efforts. Nearly 600 jurisdictions have a variety of policies \nthat would put them at risk of losing millions of dollars in federal funding for local law enforcement, national security, \ndrug treatment, and crime victim initiatives. These policies were adopted due to constitutional concerns and \njudgements made on the best use of limited resources. Rather than empowering localities to adopt measures \ndesigned to enhance the general welfare of their residents, H.R. 3003 would strip localities of the ability to enact \ncommon-sense crime prevention policies that ensure victims of crime will seek protection and report crimes. Among \nthe types of grants that would be at risk are: the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, which addresses the growing number \nof unsubmitted sexual assault kits in law enforcement custody and aims to provide help for victims; the Violent \nGang and Gun Crime Reduction Program, which is designed to create safer neighborhoods through a sustained \nreduction in gang violence and gun crime; and the Research and Evaluation on Trafficking of Persons, which helps \nsupport cities' efforts to respond to the challenges that human trafficking pose in their jurisdiction. This bill also \nraises serious concerns by undermining local laws and criminal prosecutions. It would prevent states or localities \nfrom establishing laws or policies that [[Page H5249]] prohibit or ``in any way'' restrict compliance with or \ncooperation with federal immigration enforcement. This intrudes into local policies that help foster a relationship of \ntrust between law enforcement officials and immigrants that will, in turn, promote public safety for all our residents. \n\n\n\nThis also raises serious constitutional concerns. The Tenth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution limits the federal \ngovernment's ability to mandate particular action by states and localities, including in the area of federal \nimmigration law enforcement and investigations. The federal government cannot force states or localities to enact \nor administer a federal regulatory program, or compel state or local employees to participate in the administration of \na federally enacted regulatory scheme. In addition, this bill permits DHS to ignore validly issued state or local \ncriminal warrants, which would prevent jurisdictions from completing their prosecution of criminals. The provisions \nof this bill undercut local law enforcement and will jeopardize public safety efforts. Local governments have a strong \ninterest in protecting all residents and maintaining public safety. Therefore, we urge you to oppose the No \nSanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003, and ensure it never becomes law. Thank you for your time and \nconsideration in this matter, Cities for Action. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I know my friends think Washington \nknows best, but I trust my local police more. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. \nLofgren), the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security \nMs. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, there is no debating that our immigration system is in need of reform. The system \ndoesn't meet the needs of our Nation, its businesses, or its families. There are sensible steps we can take to ensure \nthat it works better and that the rules are followed. But rather than work in a bipartisan and top-to-bottom fashion to \nfix our broken laws, today we consider a one-sided and enforcement-only approach that is rejected by the majority \nof Americans. This bill would drastically expand and, indeed, compel local involvement with Federal immigration \nenforcement. Even though the majority often professes its fondness for states' rights and local governance, the bill \nactually prohibits States and cities from policing themselves as they think best, including by having community \ntrust policies that disentangle local policing from Federal immigration enforcement. These are policies that have \nproven to engender trust in law enforcement and drive down crime. The bill prohibits jurisdictions from declining \nimmigration detainer requests, even when compliance would violate binding court orders. In fact, a lot of Federal \ndistrict courts have found that, when it is time to release an inmate because their sentence has been served, it \nviolates the Fourth Amendment to hold that individual upon a mere request by the Federal Government. If you want \nthat person, the answer is simple: Get a warrant. It is the Fourth Amendment. Indeed, the bill also likely violates the \n10th Amendment by commandeering States to engage in Federal enforcement. The bill, as has been mentioned, \ncuts off critical law enforcement funding, and that is why the Fraternal Order of Police has written its letter in \nopposition to the bill. Taken together, the provisions of this bill undermine law enforcement's ability to keep \ncommunities safe, hurt victims and witnesses of crimes, and likely violate the U.S. Constitution. It is no surprise this \nbill is a priority for the Trump administration. Anti-immigrant sentiment may have become the hallmark of the Trump \nadministration, but it does not represent the values of our Nation, and, indeed, the majority of Americans strongly \noppose President Trump's agenda. Mr. Speaker, I urge our colleagues to oppose this rule and to oppose the bill. \nMr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, again, just going \non this, immigration is an interesting issue, and we can discuss this. There probably are not a lot of folks that I \nrespect more than the gentlewoman from California, but this is a constitutional issue. Immigration is a national \nissue. If we are willing to reverse this out and let the States and localities determine immigration, I think we settled \nthat way over 200 years ago. This is where this belongs. So, as we look at this, Washington is not saying it knows \nbest. But on this issue, it is our domain; it is where we are supposed to be. This is our role. We believe, simply, that \nenforcing the law is what we need here. If the gentleman believes that States ought to have more control in a lot of \nthings that we do, then I think maybe I am getting him closer to agreeing with us on healthcare that we need to \nreform and replace ObamaCare and let States have a little bit more information in that. But one of the things is that \nthere is no affirmative action on the cities here. I think there is sort of a point to make here. There is no affirmative \naction on cities or localities to comply with this issue. They are simply, again, as I said earlier, making a choice. If \nthey choose not to work through it the current way, then they are giving up Federal funding. That is their choice. If \nthey choose to do it, they are giving up Federal funding. They are not being forced and coerced. They are simply \nsaying: You actually look at it; you make the choice in how you want to do it; then explain it to your population. If \nthey are agreeing with that, that is your choice. One of the things that often is said here is we trot out letters from \nassociations. And I agree. I respect the National Fraternal Order of Police and mayors. They have a great thing. \nBut they also represent members who are, right now, actually, not in compliance with this, who dislike this law. So, \nnaturally, you would say part of their membership is going to be supportive of them. But, also, growing up in the \nhousehold of a Georgia State trooper, I also know a few things about law enforcement as well. Law enforcement \nwants to protect the communities they serve, and they want to enforce the law. What is happening right now is that \nlocal law enforcement is deciding how they are going to do this. They are not cooperating with ICE to find a better \n\n\n\nway to work in their communities. They are simply saying: We made a political choice to do something. Well, Mr. \nSpeaker, I think with the Constitution, this body has the political choice to say: That is your choice; just do it without \nFederal funds. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume. The gentleman, my friend, says that this is a constitutional question. We agree that the \nConstitution is an important document, and it goes to the heart of why we are opposed to the bill that the gentleman \nis supporting here. The reason why we say that is because we have had Federal courts that have decided in ways \nin the past that cause great concern that much in this bill may be unconstitutional. Now, that is why we should have \nhad hearings, that radical idea that we keep on bringing up, like hearings where people come and testify. But I \nguess that is too much to ask. One of the reasons why we are opposed to this is because we are concerned that it \nmay undermine the Constitution, and that is a pretty big deal. I am happy to give the gentleman my copy of the \nConstitution and references to court cases if he would like to do a little research, but, boy, it would have been nice \nto have a hearing. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter on behalf of 407 local, State, and national immigrant, \ncivil rights, faith-based, and labor organizations in strong opposition to H.R. 3003. June 28, 2017. Re Vote NO on \nthe No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003, and Kate's Law, H.R. 3004. U.S. House of Representatives, \nWashington, DC. Dear Representative: On behalf of the 407 undersigned local, state, and national immigrant, civil \nrights, faith- based, and labor organizations, we urge you to oppose the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003 \nand Kate's Law, H.R.\n\n      3004, and any similar legislation that jeopardizes public safety, erodes the goodwill forged between local police \nand its residents, and perpetuates the criminalization and incarceration of immigrants. H.R. 3003 would strip badly \nneeded law enforcement funding for state and local jurisdictions, runs afoul of the Tenth and Fourth Amendment, \nand unnecessarily expands the government's detention apparatus. H.R. 3004 unwisely expands the federal \ngovernment's [[Page H5250]] ability to criminally prosecute immigrants for immigration- based offenses, excludes \ncritical humanitarian protections for those fleeing violence, and doubles down on the failed experiment of \nincarceration for immigration violations. Over 600 state and local jurisdictions have policies or ordinances that \ndisentangle their state and local law enforcement agencies from enforcing federal immigration law. The No \nSanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003, seeks to attack so-called ``sanctuary'' jurisdictions (many of whom do not \nconsider themselves as such) by penalizing state and local jurisdictions that follow the Fourth Amendment of the \nU.S. Constitution by refusing to honor constitutionally infirm requests for detainers. H.R. 3003 penalizes jurisdictions \nby eliminating various federal grants, including funding through the Cops on the Beat program, the Edward Byrne \nMemorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, and any other federal grant related to law enforcement or \nimmigration. Importantly, using the threat of withholding federal grants to coerce state and local jurisdictions likely \nruns afoul of the Tenth Amendment's prohibition on commandeering, a position supported by over 300 law \nprofessors. ``Sanctuary'' policies are critical to promote public safety for local communities. Fearing referral to U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, victims and witnesses of crime are significantly less likely to communicate \nwith local law enforcement. Local law enforcement authorities have repeatedly echoed this sentiment, \nacknowledging that community policing policies are paramount to enhancing public safety. Indeed, ``sanctuary'' \njurisdictions have less crime and more economic development than similarly situated non- ``sanctuary'' \njurisdictions. Withholding critically-needed federal funding would, paradoxically, severely cripple the ability of state \nand local jurisdictions to satisfy the public safety needs of their communities. Kate's Law, H.R. 3004, would further \ncriminalize the immigrant community by drastically increasing penalties for immigrants convicted of unlawful reentry. \nOperation Streamline encapsulates our nation's failed experiment with employing criminal penalties to deter \nmigration. Under Operation Streamline, the federal government prosecutes immigrants for reentry at significant \nrates. By all practical measures, Operation Streamline has failed to deter migration, wasted billions of taxpayer \ndollars, and unfairly punished thousands of immigrants who try to enter or reenter the United States to reunite with \ntheir children and loved ones. We fear that H.R. 3004's increased penalties for reentry would double down on this \nfailed strategy, explode the prison population, and cost billions of dollars. Instead of passing discredited \nenforcement-only legislation, Congress should move forward on enacting just immigration reform legislation that \nprovides a roadmap to citizenship for the nation's eleven million aspiring Americans and eliminates mass detention \nand deportation programs that undermine fundamental human rights. Legislation that erodes public safety, \ndisrespects local democratic processes, and raises serious constitutional concerns represents an abdication of the \nCongress' responsibility to enact fair, humane, and just immigration policy. In light of the above, we urge you to \nvote NO on the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003 and Kate's Law, H.R. 3004.

Mr. \nMcGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell). Mr. \nPASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, this is an interesting issue with the canvas in the back of the entire immigration laws \nthat need to be addressed. This body--not the body at the other end of the building, this body-- didn't have the guts \nto address it 4 years ago, 3 years ago, 2 years ago, nor this year. This is something that we need to address, even \nthough it is not the bill itself. I am a strong supporter of law enforcement. As co-chair of the Law Enforcement \nCaucus, I rise in total opposition to this bill and the rule. Here is what the misguided goal of this bill would do: You \nare going to prove a point by penalizing law enforcement for immigration policies politicians in their city have to \nimplement. That is what you want to do. So it absolves us down here in Washington. This bill threatens the central \nFederal funding streams for law enforcement. You have heard all of those programs that are being endangered. \nAny grant administered by the Department of Justice or the Department of Homeland Security that is substantially \nrelated to law enforcement, terrorism, national security, immigration, or naturalization you are putting on the \nchopping block if this bill becomes law. This bill would not make our communities safer. In fact, it undermines public \nsafety. The funding this bill puts at risk allows local police departments to purchase equipment and hire and provide \ntraining for officers. This actually jeopardizes the security--read my lips--of communities in order to perpetuate a \nfalse narrative about immigrants. {time} 1300 I just received a letter from the New Jersey State Policemen's \nBenevolent Association. I think it says it better than anything I could say. It says: ``Politics should not interfere with \nthe safety of our members or our ability to do our job.'' The police are telling us that, and you are asking them to go \nout and do the job of protecting our citizens day in and day out--which we all are, I hope--and then you are telling \nthem: But I am sorry, because we have a disagreement on this issue, you are going to suffer the consequences. \nMr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the New Jersey State Policemen's Benevolent Association. New \nJersey State Policemen's Benevolent Association, Inc., Woodbridge, NJ, June 28, 2017. Re H.R. 3003. Hon. \nWilliam Pascrell, Jr., Paterson, NJ. Dear Congressman Pascrell: The New Jersey State Policemen's Benevolent \nAssociation (NJSPBA) represents over 33,000 law enforcement officers throughout our state. It is no secret that \nlaw enforcement officers risk their own safety every day to keep our [[Page H5252]] communities safe. And as a \nstrong supporter of law enforcement on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, we would like to thank you \nfor all your efforts on behalf of the men and women that serve within the law enforcement community. It is our \nunderstanding that this week the House is voting on H.R. 3003, the ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,'' which adds \nadditional obstacles to funding for the hiring of additional police officers in certain communities throughout our \n\n\n\nstate. Specifically, the bill restricts municipalities from receiving grants administered by the Department of Justice or \nthe Department of Homeland Security if municipal officials fail to notify the federal government with regard to the \npresence of individuals as it relates to information regarding citizenship or immigration status. While we strongly \nagree that state and local law enforcement should work closely with federal law enforcement, cutting off funding for \nlaw enforcement to already underfunded and understaffed police departments and law enforcement entities \nundermines our collective efforts to keep our members and the communities they serve safe. Politics should not \ninterfere with the safety of our members or our ability to do our job. On behalf of our membership, we appreciate \nyour ongoing efforts and hope you will continue to work with your colleagues in Congress to assure funding for law \nenforcement and prevent our government from punishing our membership for something that is completely out of \nour control. I am available to discuss our opposition to H.R. 3003 further, at your convenience. You can reach me at \nour NJSPBA offices, if you have any questions. Thank you for all your efforts on behalf of the men and women of \nlaw enforcement. Sincerely, Patrick Colligan, State President. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the \ngentleman has expired. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman. Mr. \nPASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, congressional Republicans are doing that right here. They are playing politics with our \nNation's security. To quote the New Jersey State Policemen's Benevolent Association again--these words are from \nthe police, not me--`` . . . punishing our membership for something that is completely out of our control.'' Why are \nthe police opposed to this legislation? The Fraternal Order of Police you have heard about. Some of my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle like to talk the talk when it comes to supporting law enforcement until it either costs \nmoney or we are going to have to deal with the bigger factors. That is a fact. You may laugh all you want, but that is \na fact. I can cite you chapter and verse if you want. This is no laughing matter. This is business. This is the lives of \nthe police. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are advised to address remarks to the Chair. Mr. COLLINS of \nGeorgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I will address my remarks to the \nChair, but I also will not stand here and let it be said from some political angle that the son of a Georgia State \ntrooper has anything less than respect for law enforcement or wants anything more than to have law enforcement \nagencies do their job. And this is exactly what we are talking about. Do your job. If you want to make a political \nstatement, then work it out politically. But this is: Do your job, keep the law. I mean, what else--are we going to get \nanother letter from another police association saying: Well, we decided we are not going to enforce Federal \nwhatever else? This is an issue that needs to be discussed, and I will just simply say, from this perspective, of one \nwho has lived it for 50 years and who lived it under the same house for 21 years, no, there is no one that respects \nlaw enforcement and their role more than this Member. And this Member is simply reflecting a lot of views of law \nenforcement. This says: Let us do our job. We will work on these issues, but you are making a choice. If you don't \nwant to enforce it, then don't take the money. Do what you want to do. Just don't take the money. Mr. Speaker, I \nreserve the balance of my time. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Pascrell) in order to respond. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I think that is a very pathetic way to look at \nour police officers in this country. ``If you don't like it, don't take the money.'' You must be kidding me. I urge my \ncolleagues to find a different tactic to penalize political decisions that you don't like. I urge my colleagues to oppose \nthis bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are, again, reminded to address their remarks to the Chair, not to \nindividuals on the floor. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to defeat the previous question. And if \nwe do defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to this rule to bring up Representative Bobby Scott's \nRaise the Wage Act, H.R. 15, which would finally give workers the raise they deserve, and increase the Federal \nminimum wage to $15 an hour within 7 years. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. \nThe SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no \nobjection. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. \nEllison) to discuss our proposal. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, America needs a raise. We have not raised the \nminimum wage in 10 years, and people who work hard every single day have seen their pay erode again and again. \nMr. Speaker, people who are working full time at $7.25 an hour can't make it. And if we can defeat this previous \nquestion, we can actually bring up something that the American people really need, which is to get a raise. Mr. \nSpeaker, this is not something we are going to dump on top of business all at once. There is a ladder up. It takes 7 \nyears to get to that $15, but, Mr. Speaker, make no doubt that we need to do it. Mr. Speaker, right now, today, \npeople working full time qualify for food stamps, housing assistance, and medical assistance because their \nemployers don't pay them enough to make it. And I know that everybody in this House knows that, when people \nwork hard, they ought to be able to make it in America. If you work full time, you shouldn't be in poverty. You should \n\n\n\nbe able to afford a good apartment. You should be able to have good scheduling for your job. You should have \nsome benefits. This is all the American Dream is about, being able to work hard and get paid fairly for it. Now, Mr. \nSpeaker, I just want to let you know that between 2009 and 2013, we saw the top 1 percent of income earners get \n85 percent of the income growth in this country. That means we have historic inequality not seen since the Great \nDepression. It is wrong, Mr. Speaker. And if we can defeat this previous question, we should do everything we can \nto pass this excellent piece of legislation that Ranking Member Bobby Scott has authored in this body. Mr. Scott \nand I, as well as many other Members, have been all over this country, and right here in D.C. standing with workers \nexplaining to us their struggles, how they haven't seen a raise, how they haven't seen their pay go up. And they are \nserious, Mr. Speaker, about wanting to be part of this economy, too. Pass this minimum wage increase. Give \nAmerica a raise. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. \nSpeaker, the reason why we are trying to bring this to the floor by way of defeating the previous question is \nbecause the Republican majority in this House had basically locked everything down so we can't get important bills \nto the floor. We can't even get amendments to the underlying bill that we are debating here today. It is really \nunfortunate and sad for this institution. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett). \nMr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, this bill wrongfully endorses political interference with professional law enforcement \nleaders. With no legal authority, both President Trump and his Texan look-alike, Governor Greg Abbott, want to \ndeny funds and intimidate [[Page H5253]] local governments, who rightfully refuse to place politics above public \nsafety. I will tell my Republican colleague from Georgia, and his colleagues, that the only lawlessness that exists \nhere is the lawlessness of President Trump in trying to do this to such an extent that a Federal court order stopped \nhim. And they will also, I believe, stop Governor Abbott on his outrageous Senate Bill 4. Our police chiefs in San \nAntonio and in Austin, our courageous Sheriff, Sally Hernandez, like many law enforcement professionals from \nTexas to New Jersey, they say that maintaining the trust and confidence of the immigrant community to report \ncrime, to be witnesses concerning crime, that this makes us all safer--immigrant and nonimmigrant alike. Any \nproper arrest warrant presented by ICE will be honored everywhere. Detainers, which are merely a bureaucratic \nmessage saying the bureaucracy is suspicious of someone who should be imprisoned based on that suspicion, will \nnot be kept imprisoned--and Federal courts have said they should not be--under the Constitution. I would say that \nthe only sanctuary that this bill provides is a sanctuary for prejudice. It is a sanctuary that defies the reality of the \nAmerica we have today, particularly in the Southwest. We should reject this bill and affirm welcoming cities, like \nmine, that are a refuge from anti-immigrant hysteria, but have a strong commitment to safety and to effective law \nenforcement, and looking to our local law enforcement, not political interference from Washington telling us how to \nprotect our families. This very week, four years ago, an overwhelming bipartisan United States Senate majority \napproved comprehensive immigration reform. And like the amendments that are being blocked today, these \nHouse Republicans were so fearful that that bill might become law that they will not even permit us to even debate \nit four years later on the floor of this House. Instead of this anti-immigrant hysteria, instead of this sorry piece of \nlegislation, what we need is broad immigration reform, and we need it now. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members \nare reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, \nI yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), our former chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. \nSMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank the gentleman from Georgia, a member of the Rules \nCommittee, for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the underlying bill, H.R. 3003, No Sanctuary for \nCriminals Act; and I thank the chairman, Bob Goodlatte, and Representatives Steve King and Andy Biggs for \nintroducing it. This legislation keeps dangerous criminal immigrants off our streets and out of our neighborhoods, \nand it holds sanctuary cities accountable for breaking Federal immigration laws. I have a special interest in this \nlegislation because it enforces a bill I sponsored in 1969, which was enacted into law and made sanctuary cities \nillegal. The American people sent a clear message to Congress last November when they elected a President who \npromised to enforce our immigration laws. A recent poll shows that 80 percent--80 percent--of voters want cities \nthat arrest illegal immigrants for crimes to be required to turn them over to immigration authorities. Eighty percent. \nThat is a Harvard-Harris poll. The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act is a down payment on our pledge to protect \ninnocent Americans from criminal immigrants who deserve to be jailed or sent back to their home countries. We \nneed to enact this legislation. There is simply no excuse for local governments to ignore immigration laws at the \nexpense of American's safety and well-being. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter to the entire Congress from the American Immigration \nLawyers Association in opposition to this bill; a letter from Amnesty International in opposition to this bill; and a letter \n\n\n\nfrom Church World Services in opposition to this bill. Statement of the American Immigration Lawyers Association \nOpposing the ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act'' (H.R. 3003) and ``Kate's Law'' (H.R.\n\n                          3004), June 27, 2017. As the national bar association of over 15,000 immigration lawyers and law \nprofessors, the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) opposes ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act'' \n(H.R. 3003) and ``Kate's Law'' (H.R. 3004). AILA recommends that members of Congress reject these bills which \nare scheduled to come before the House Rules Committee on June 27 and to the floor shortly thereafter. Though \nJudiciary Chairman Goodlatte stated that the bills will ``enhance public safety,'' they will do the just the opposite: \nundermine public safety and make it even harder for local law enforcement to protect their residents and \ncommunities. In addition, the bills which were made public less than a week before the vote and completely \nbypassed the Judiciary Committee, include provisions that will result in violations of due process and the Fourth and \nTenth Amendments to the Constitution. At a time when over 9 out 10 Americans support immigration reform and \nlegalization of the undocumented, Republican leadership is asking the House to vote on enforcement-only bills that \nwill lead to more apprehensions, deportations, and prosecutions of thousands of immigrants and their families who \nhave strong ties to the United States. Instead of criminalizing and scapegoating immigrants, Congress should be \noffering workable reforms that will strengthen our economy and our country. The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, \nH.R. 3003 H.R. 3003 would undermine public safety and interfere with local policing: H.R. 3003 would amend 8 \nSec. U.S.C. 1373 to prevent states or localities from establishing laws or policies that prohibit or ``in any way'' \nrestrict compliance with or cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The bill dramatically expands 8 \nU.S.C. Sec. 1373 which is more narrowly written and prohibits local law enforcement from restricting the sharing \nand exchange of information with federal authorities, but only with respect to an individual's citizenship or \nimmigration status. Rather than empowering localities, the extremely broad wording of H.R. 3003 would strip \nlocalities of the ability to enact common-sense crime prevention policies that ensure victims of crime will seek \nprotection and report crimes. The bill would also undermine public safety by prohibiting DHS from honoring criminal \nwarrants of communities deemed ``sanctuary cities'' if the individual being sought by local law enforcement has a \nfinal order of removal. Under H.R. 3003, localities that fail to comply with federal immigration efforts are penalized \nwith the denial of federal funding for critical law enforcement, national security, drug treatment, and crime victim \ninitiatives, including the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), Community Oriented Policing Services \n(COPS), and Byrne JAG programs that provide hundreds of millions of dollars to localities nationwide. In an effort to \nforce localities to engage in civil immigration enforcement efforts, including those against nonviolent \nundocumented immigrants, the bill would make it far more difficult for many localities, including large cities, to \narrest and prosecute potentially dangerous criminals. The bill could even offer criminals a form of immunity, \nknowing that any crimes they commit in a designated sanctuary city would result, at most, in their removal from \nthe country as opposed to criminal prosecution. H.R. 3003 would run afoul of constitutional safeguards in the Fourth \nAmendment: By prohibiting localities from restricting or limiting their own cooperation with federal immigration \nenforcement, H.R. 3003 effectively compels localities to honor ICE detainer requests--a controversial and \nconstitutionally suspect practice that is nonetheless widely-used by ICE. Federal courts have found that ICE use of \ndetainers violates the Fourth Amendment, and that localities may be held liable for honoring them. The bill also \nexpands detainer authority by establishing that ICE may issue detainer requests for localities to hold undocumented \nimmigrants for up to 96 hours--twice what is currently allowed--even if probable cause has not been shown. Courts \nhave concluded that localities cannot continue detaining someone unless ICE obtains a warrant from a neutral \nmagistrate who has determined there is probable cause, or in the case of a warrantless arrest, review by a neutral \nmagistrate within 48 hours of arrest. The expansive provisions in H.R. 3003 would force localities to choose \nbetween detaining people in violation of the Constitution or being punished as a ``sanctuary city.'' Furthermore, \nthis bill provides government actors and private contractors with immunity if they are sued for violating the \nConstitution. Provisions in this bill transfer the financial burden of litigation by substituting the federal government \nfor the local officers as the defendant. If H.R. 3003 becomes law, American taxpayers would be stuck paying for \nlawsuits brought by those who are unjustly detained. The bill goes even further by creating a private right of action \nallowing crime victims or their family members to sue localities if the crime was committed by someone who was \nreleased by the locality that did not honor an ICE detainer request. H.R. 3003 would violate the Tenth Amendment: \nH.R. 3003 would compel states and localities to utilize their local law enforcement resources to implement federal \ncivil [[Page H5254]] immigration enforcement in violation of the Tenth Amendment's ``commandeering'' principle. \nThe Tenth Amendment does not permit the federal government to force counties and cities to allocate local \n\n\n\nresources, including police officers, technology, and personnel, to enforce federal immigration law. The federal \ngovernment also cannot withhold funds from localities refusing to participate in federal efforts if the programs \naffected are unrelated to the purpose of the federal program, or if the sanctions are punitive in nature. H.R. 3003 \nwould expand detention without due process: H.R.\n\n      3003 would increase the use of detention without ensuring those detained have access to a bond \ndetermination. Under the bill, nearly anyone who is undocumented, including those who have overstayed their visa \nwould be subject to detention without a custody hearing. The bill also establishes that DHS has the authority to \ndetain individuals ``without time limitation'' during the pendency of removal proceedings. These provisions would \ndramatically expand the federal government's power to indefinitely detain individuals, and would likely result in ever \ngrowing numbers of undocumented immigrants held in substandard detention facilities. Kate's Law, H.R. 3004 H.R. \n3004 would expand the already severe penalties in federal law for illegal reentry (NA 276; 8 U.S.C. 1326). The \nnumber of people prosecuted for illegal reentry has grown steadily to about 20,000 prosecutions each year, and \nsuch cases comprise more than one quarter of all federal criminal prosecutions nationwide. H.R. 3004 adds \nsentencing enhancements for people who are convicted of minor misdemeanors and people who have reentered \nmultiple times but have no criminal convictions. This bill will not improve public safety and will undermine due \nprocess and protections for asylum seekers. H.R. 3004 would waste American taxpayer funds by imposing severe \nprison sentences upon thousands of people who pose no threat to the community and who have strong ties to the \ncountry and are trying to unite with their loved ones. H.R. 3004 would impose severe sentencing enhancements \nupon people with minor offenses: H.R. 3004 would add sentencing enhancements for minor misdemeanor \nconvictions, including driving without a license and other traffic-related offenses. Under the current version of INA \nSec. 276, if a person is charged with reentering the U.S. after being removed, their punishment is enhanced by up \nto ten years only if they have been convicted a felony or three or more misdemeanors involving drugs or violence. \nUnder H.R. 3004 someone who has been convicted of any three misdemeanors regardless of severity would be \nsubject to a term of up to ten years. This expansion would unfairly target large numbers of people who are not a \nthreat to public safety but instead are trying to reunite with family members and have other strong ties to the United \nStates. Currently half of all people convicted of illegal reentry have one child living in the country. Increasing \nsentences for illegal reentry would also waste taxpayer dollars, costing huge amounts of money to lock up non-\nviolent people. H.R. 3004 would punish people who attempt to seek asylum at the border: H.R. 3004 expands the \nprovisions of INA 276 to punish not only people who reenter the U.S. or attempt to reenter the U.S., but also people \nwho cross or attempt to cross the border. The bill goes on to define ``crosses the border'' to mean ``the physical act \nof crossing the border, regardless of whether the alien is free from official restraint.'' That means that people who \npresent themselves at ports of entry to request asylum and are taken into custody by CBP to await a fear screening \nwould be subject to criminal charges based on a past removal, even though they are seeking refuge in the U.S. \nH.R. 3004 would impose severe sentencing enhancements for people with multiple entries: The bill would also \ncreate new sentencing enhancements for people who have reentered the U.S. multiple times, even if they have no \nother criminal convictions. If someone has been removed three or more times, and is found in the United States or \nattempts to cross the border again, H.R. 3004 law would provide for sentencing enhancements of up to ten years. \nThe bill makes no exception for bona fide asylum seekers, which means that people who are seeking refuge in the \nU.S. from atrocities abroad could be subject to a lengthy prison sentence under these provisions. H.R. 3004 would \nundermine due process by blocking challenges to unfair removal orders: The bill will prevent an individual from \nchallenging the validity of a removal order, even it was fundamentally unfair in the first place. The Supreme Court \nheld in U.S. v. Mendoza-Lopez,481 U.S. 828 (1987) that due process requires that a challenge be allowed if a \ndeportation proceeding is used as an element of a criminal offense and where the proceeding ``effectively \neliminate[d] the right of the alien to obtain judicial review.'' This provision in H.R. 3004 is likely unconstitutional and \nwill cause grave injustice to defendants, such as asylum seekers who were deported without the opportunity to seek \nasylum. ____ Amnesty International, June 28, 2017. Amnesty International USA urges a vote ``NO'' on H.R. 3003 \nand H.R.\n\n                                   3004 Dear Representative: On behalf of Amnesty International USA (``AIUSA'') and our more \nthan one million members and supporters nationwide, we strongly urge you to oppose the No Sanctuary for \nCriminals Act (H.R. 3003) and Kate's Law (H.R.\n\n\n\n      3004). Both bills are scheduled for House floor votes as early as June 28. If passed, both bills would pave the \nway for and accelerate the implementation of policies that increase the criminalization and detention of immigrants \nand asylum seekers, thereby violating the United States' obligations under international law. AIUSA will be scoring \nthese votes. I. The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act (H.R. 3003) would prevent municipalities from determining how \nlaw enforcement agencies are engaging in immigration enforcement, and would dramatically expand indefinite \ndetention and mandatory detention of immigrants in jail-like facilities with subpar dangerous conditions, in violation \nof international human rights standards. H.R. 3003 would prevent localities from enacting community trust policies \nthat instruct local police not to carry out federal immigration enforcement, thereby undermining policing practices \ndesigned to build trust and confidence between local law enforcement and the communities they serve. This bill \nwould open the door to racial profiling against Latinos and other communities of color, including U.S. citizens. \nInternational law firmly prohibits discrimination, and the United States' commitment to those obligations applies to \ncitizens and non-citizens alike. States that have passed anti-immigrant legislation that requires local law \nenforcement to cooperate with immigration agencies or to inquire about immigration status regarding any \ninteractions with law enforcement have compromised the right to justice for immigrant communities by discouraging \nimmigrant survivors from reporting crimes. The U.S. government has an obligation to prevent and address abuse of \nimmigrants and ensure that all immigrants are able to access available remedies. This includes acting with due \ndiligence to investigate and punish criminal conduct committed by private individuals, and guaranteeing access to \njustice for immigrant victims of crime. Amnesty International has also documented how the increased involvement \nof state and local law enforcement agencies in immigration enforcement, without adequate oversight and \naccountability to prevent abuses, contributes to the rise in reports of racial profiling for Latino communities and \nother communities of color. Numerous studies have demonstrated that programs that integrate the criminal justice \nsystem and law enforcement as an entry point for immigration enforcement have led to racial profiling and other \nabuses. In addition, H.R. 3003 would dramatically expand the Department of Homeland Security (``DES'') \nimmigration detention powers by authorizing mandatory detention ``without time limitation.'' This would empower \nthe DHS to detain untold numbers of immigrants for as long as it takes to conclude immigration court removal \nproceedings, even if that takes years. Section 4 would also authorize indefinite mandatory detention Without \nproviding the basic due process of an immigration judge bond hearing to determine if the immigrant's \nimprisonment was justified in the first place. Finally, section 4 would expand mandatory detention of immigrants with \nno criminal record whatsoever, including immigrants who overstayed a visa or lack legal papers. The mandatory \ndetention system, which provides for the automatic detention of individuals, amounts to arbitrary detention, and is in \nviolation of international law, which requires that detention be justified in each individual case and be subject to \njudicial review. The expansion of offenses which would fall under mandatory detention as demonstrated in H.R., as \nproposed by H.R. 3003, amounts to arbitrary detention, and is in violation of international law, which requires that \ndetention be justified in each individual case and be subject to judicial review. U.S. federal courts have also \nconsistently held that detaining immigrants for months and years without bond hearings raises serious problems \nunder the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. The proposed dramatic expansion of immigration detention \npowers envisioned in H.R. 3003 comes at a time when immigration detention has already hit record-highs, with the \naverage daily population (``ADP'') exceeding 40,000 in comparison to a 34,000 ADP for the preceding seven years. \nThis sharp escalation in the number of detained immigrants also comes at a time when Human Rights Watch \n(``HRW'') has reported new evidence of dangerously subpar medical care in immigration detention, including \nunreasonable delays in care and unqualified medical staff that are likely to expose a record number of immigrants \nto dangerous conditions. This recent HRW report is only the latest of a series of shocking reports documenting \nDHS's failure to provide care to ill or injured immigrants in its custody. The International Covenant on Civil and \nPolitical Rights (ICCPR), which the United States has ratified, guarantees all people the rights to be free from \ndiscrimination and arbitrary arrest and detention, and the right to due process, including fair deportation procedures. \nFinally, noncitizens who are detained have a right to humane conditions of detention and are entitled to prompt \nreview [[Page H5255]] of their detention by an independent court. The mass expansion of mandatory detention and \nimmigration detention proposed by H.R. 3003 violates all of these international human rights standards. II. H.R. \n3004 would increase mass incarceration of immigrants, including survivors of persecution or torture, by increasing \ncriminal penalties for the mere act of migration-- in violation of international human rights standards. Current law \nalready criminalizes illegal reentry in violation of international law and standards under 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1326, \nimposing a sentence of up to 20 years on anyone convicted of illegal reentry after committing an aggravated felony. \nAccording to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, in fiscal \n\n\n\nyear 2016 federal criminal prosecutions for illegal entry, reentry, and similar immigration violations made up 52 \npercent of all federal prosecutions nationwide--surpassing drugs, weapons, fraud and thousands of other crimes. \nCriminal penalties for unauthorized entry are obstacles for identifying the victims of human rights abuses, and \nprevent victims from seeking justice. They undermine human rights protections afforded in international law, \nincluding the right to seek asylum. The Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of Migrants has repeatedly \nstressed that where detention is used as a punitive measure, it is disproportionate and inappropriate, and \nstigmatizes undocumented immigrants as criminals. The criminal prosecution of illegal reentry has grown \nexponentially over the past decade. In 2002 there were 8,000 prosecutions for illegal reentry; in 2012 these \nprosecutions had increased to 37,000. Nearly 99 percent of illegal reentry defendants were sentenced to federal \nprison time, ranging from a few days to 10 years or more for felony reentry before they are eventually deported. \nBeyond the trend towards more aggressive criminal prosecutions for illegal reentry, a 2015 U.S. Sentencing \nCommission report found nearly 50 percent of people sentenced in fiscal 2013 for illegal re-entry had at least one \nchild living in the U.S. Many of the individuals charged with illegal reentry previously resided in the U.S. for many \nyears and are desperate to return to their family in the U.S. On top of this longstanding trend of harsher criminal \nprosecution for illegal reentry--the sponsors of H.R. 3004 would seek to expand the category of individuals subject \nto illegal reentry prosecution to include people who surrender themselves at the southern border to seek protection \nin the U.S. The bill would also expand sentencing enhancements for illegal reentry, and would prosecute people for \nillegal reentry even if their previous removal orders were unlawful or deprived them of the opportunity to seek \nprotection. For example, the bill would criminalize asylum seekers who return to the U.S. after being previously \ndenied the opportunity to present their claims for protection. While all sovereign states have a legitimate interest in \nregulating entry into their territories, they can only do so within the limits of their obligations under international law. \nThe U.S. government has an obligation under international human rights law to ensure that its laws, policies, and \npractices do not place immigrants at an increased risk of human rights abuses. Specifically, individuals have a right \nto seek asylum from persecution and protection from refoulement, and prosecuting asylum seekers prior to \nadjudication of their asylum applications violates U.S. obligations under the Refugee Convention. Similarly the \nConvention Against Torture prohibits a State from expelling, returning, or extraditing a person to another State \nwhere there are substantial grounds for believing that s/he would be in danger of being subjected to torture. Finally, \nall individuals, regardless of immigration status, have a right to family unity which can include limits on the State's \npower to deport, as recognized by the Human Rights Committee's interpretation of ICCPR obligations All of these \ninternational human rights standards are violated by H.R. 3004. AIUSA strongly urges you to oppose both H.R. \n3003 and H.R.\n\n      3004. Sincerely, Joanne Lin, Senior Managing Director, Advocacy and Government Affairs. ____ CWS \nStatement to Opposing H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and H.R. 3004, Kate's Law As a 71-year \nold humanitarian organization representing 37 Protestant, Anglican, and Orthodox communions and 34 refugee \nresettlement offices across the country, Church World Service (CWS) urges all Members of Congress to support \nthe longstanding efforts of law enforcement officials to foster trusting relationships with the communities they \nprotect and serve. As we pray for peace and an end to senseless acts of violence that are too prevalent in this \ncountry, CWS encourages the U.S. Congress to refrain from politicizing tragedies or conflating the actions of one \nperson with an entire community of our immigrant brothers and sisters and oppose H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary \nfor Criminals Act, and H.R. 3004, Kate's Law. H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, would target more \nthan 600+ cities, counties, and states across the country and threaten to take away millions of dollars in federal \nfunding that local police use to promote public safety. Communities are safer when they commit to policies that \nstrengthen trust and cooperation between local law enforcement, community leadership and institutions, and all \nresidents, regardless of immigration status. The Federal government should not hurt intentional, community-\nbased policing efforts that are vital in communities across the country. Many cities have already recognized that \nrequests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to hold individuals beyond their court-appointed \nsentences violate due process and have been found unconstitutional by federal courts. This bill would raise \nprofound constitutional concerns by prohibiting localities from declining to comply with ICE detainer requests even \nwhen such compliance would violate federal court orders and the U.S. Constitution. Local police that refuse ICE \ndetainer requests see an increase in public safety due to improved trust from the community. It is precisely this trust \nthat enables community members to report dangerous situations without the fear of being deported or separated \nfrom their families. When local police comply with ICE detainer requests, more crimes go unreported because \n\n\n\nvictims and witnesses are afraid of being deported if they contact the police. This bill would also undermine local \ncriminal prosecutions by allowing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to ignore state or local criminal \nwarrants and refuse to transfer individuals to state or local custody in certain circumstances. This bill would reduce \ncommunity safety by preventing state and local jurisdictions from holding people accountable. The United States \nalready spends more than $18 billion on immigration enforcement per year, more than all other federal law \nenforcement agencies combined. H.R. 3004, Kate's Law, would expand the federal government's ability to \nprosecute individuals for ``illegal reentry'' and impose even more severe penalties in these cases--even though \nprosecutions for migration-related offenses already make up more than 50% of all federal prosecutions. Yet, this bill \ndoes not include adequate protections for individuals who reenter the U.S. in order to seek protection, which would \nplace asylum seekers at risk of being returned to the violence and persecution they fled. We have seen how Border \nPatrol's current practices violate existing U.S. law and treaty obligations by preventing viable asylum claims from \nmoving forward. DHS has found that in some areas, Border Patrol refers asylum seekers for criminal prosecution \ndespite the fact that they have expressed fear of persecution. In May 2017, a report was released highlighting that \nmany asylum seekers, who had expressed a fear of returning to their home countries are being turned away by \nGBP agents. New barriers to protection are unnecessary and would dangerously impede our obligations under \ninternational and U.S. law. Federal, state, and local policies that focus on deportation do not reduce crime rates. \nIndividuals are being deported who present no risk to public safety and who are long-standing community members, \nincluding parents of young children. Immigrants come to this country to reunite with family, work, and make \nmeaningful contributions that enrich their communities. Several studies over the last century have affirmed that all \nimmigrants, regardless of nationality or status, are less likely than U.S. citizens to commit violent crimes. A recent \nreport found a correlation between the increase in undocumented immigrants, and the sharp decline in violent and \nproperty crime rates. Immigration is correlated with significantly higher employment growth and a decline in the \nunemployment rate, and immigrants have high entrepreneurial rates, creating successful businesses that hire \nimmigrant and U.S. citizen employees. As communities of faith, we are united by principles of compassion, \nstewardship, and justice. CWS urges all Members of Congress to oppose H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for \nCriminals Act, and H.R. 3004, Kate's Law. What we need are real solutions and immigration policies that treat our \nneighbors with the dignity and respect that all people deserve and affirm local law enforcement officer's efforts to \nbuild trust with their communities. Mr. McGOVERN. Again, Mr. Speaker, our objection is that Washington doesn't \nalways know best. We ought to trust our local law enforcement officials, our local police as to what is effective in \nterms of protecting the citizens of our community. To introduce legislation that would essentially punish our local \npolice for doing what they think is in the best interest of their communities, this bill should be renamed ``punish our \nlocal police,'' because that is what it does. I can't believe that we are going down this road. Maybe it is a nice sound \nbite, maybe it is a nice press release, maybe it fits in with the Trump campaign rhetoric on immigrants and \nimmigration; but this is just a lousy idea. And I think if we did hearings on this bill, if we actually spent some time \nbeing thoughtful about this issue, my colleagues would come to that conclusion. Again, I would say that what we \nshould be talking about is fixing our [[Page H5256]] broken immigration system. We need comprehensive \nimmigration reform. The Senate, in a bipartisan way, stepped up to the plate and did it. It is about time Members \nof this House have the guts to bring a comprehensive immigration reform bill to the floor and fix our broken \nimmigration system. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield \n2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher). Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support \nof H.R. 3003. This is a very positive first step toward coming to grips with an issue that has divided this country \nbecause it is causing great damage to so many Americans. What we are talking about is not immigrant hysteria. \nThat type of mixing legal immigrants with illegal immigrants, that is the true racism because it hurts those people \nwho have come here legally. Now, what we have got here are legal immigrants who are being cast into the same \npot as illegals, with the opposition to this bill. People who are here legally understand that we need protection for \npeople who are here in this country against, especially, criminals who come from overseas and illegal aliens who \nare criminals, at that. Working Americans of every race, religion, and ethnic group have seen that their families are \nless secure, and they are even sometimes being murdered by the insane lack of action on the part of our \ngovernment to protect our citizens. Our number one responsibility is to make sure our own people, legal \nimmigrants, and all Americans of every race, creed, and color are protected. And what do they see? This massive \nflood of illegals coming into our country, taking jobs, bidding down wages, lowering the education standards and the \nhealthcare that most Americans rely upon. {time} 1315 No wonder the American people want action. But then, when \nthey are faced with a city saying even criminals who have committed acts of aggression, murder, et cetera, upon \n\n\n\nour citizens, that we are going to let them just stay, and that there is going to be a block. Whose side are you on is \nwhat this amendment is all about. Are we on the side of the American people? Are we on the side of those victims \nwho work hard every day and try to raise their families; or are we on the side of a massive flow of people, many of \nwhom, and most of whom, are good people? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. \nMr. COLLINS of Georgia. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Most of the people \nwho come here, most of the people flooding here, even the illegals, are basically wonderful people. But that doesn't \nmean that we can bring in more than that, 1 million-- By the way, we need to understand, don't condemn America \non its immigration policy. We let a million legal immigrants into our country every year, and that is more than the \nrest of the world combined. We can be proud of that. But, at the same time, we have to make sure that our people \nare protected, that they don't lose their jobs, or they don't have to accept less money for the same work because \nyou have got somebody here who will work for nothing. We want to make sure when they need their healthcare, \nthey get their healthcare. That will bankrupt our system. Are we going to have a sanctuary healthcare system, too, \nso anybody in the world can come here and use up our scarce health dollars? No, it is time for us to strike a blow \nfor the protection of Americans and legal immigrants of every race and religion and ethnic background, not to show \nthese things. Immigrant hysteria; shame, shame, shame. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume. I include in the Record a letter to every Member of Congress from The Leadership Conference on \nCivil and Human Rights in opposition to this bill; a letter to all of us from the ACLU in opposition to this bill; a letter to \nevery Member of Congress from the National Task Force to End Sexual & Domestic Violence that is in opposition to \nthis bill; as well as a letter to Members of Congress from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and \nCatholic Charities USA in opposition to this bill; and a letter from NETWORK, which is a lobby for Catholic social \njustice in opposition to this bill. The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, Washington, DC, June 27, \n2017. Oppose the ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act'' (H.R. 3003) and ``Kate's Law'' (H.R. 3004) Dear \nRepresentative: On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of more than 200 \nnational advocacy organizations, I urge you to oppose H.R.\n\n      3003, the ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,'' and H.R. 3004, ``Kate's Law.'' These two bills may sound ``tough,'' \nbut they would ultimately make the problems with our national immigration system even worse than they already \nare. H.R. 3003 would unnecessarily and unwisely penalize states and municipalities that are attempting to strike the \ndelicate balance between cooperating with federal immigration authorities, on one hand, and respecting the \nconstraints imposed on them by the U.S. Constitution, on the other. At the same time, it would do nothing to \naddress the constitutional concerns raised by the use of immigration ``detainer'' requests, concerns that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) itself has recognized in the past. Among its provisions, H.R. 3003 would \neliminate various federal law enforcement grants to states and municipalities, such as the ``Cops on the Beat'' \nprogram, unless jurisdictions comply with all DHS detainer requests. It aims to overturn local policies adopted by \nover 300 jurisdictions across the country that have determined, as a matter of constitutional law and sound public \npolicy, including community policing efforts, that they cannot hold individuals beyond their release dates solely on \nthe basis of a DHS detainer request. The senseless and tragic 2015 killing of Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco has \nrenewed the debate over so-called ``sanctuary cities.'' Yet the term suggests, incorrectly, that certain states and \nmunicipalities are refusing to work with federal immigration enforcement authorities. The truth is that state and \nlocal law enforcement agencies (``LEAs'') throughout the country already aid in the identification of individuals who \nare subject to immigration enforcement action through the sharing of fingerprints of those who are taken into \ncustody. LEAs with limited detainer policies have determined, however, that they cannot continue to detain \nindividuals for immigration enforcement purposes, under the Fourth Amendment and pursuant to numerous court \nrulings, unless DHS obtains a judicial warrant, as all other law enforcement agencies are required to do. H.R. 3003 \nwould not address the Fourth Amendment concerns raised by the use of DHS detainers. Instead, it would leave \nmany state and municipal governments in an untenable position: either they must disregard their constitutional \nresponsibilities and erode the trust they have built between the police and the communities they serve, or they will \nface the loss of vital federal law enforcement funding that helps them fight crime in their jurisdictions. Congress \nshould not force such an arbitrary and unwise choice on cities. H.R. 3004, the other immigration-related bill \nexpected to come to the House floor this week, would significantly increase sentences for previously-removed \nindividuals who reenter the country. While the bill is an improvement over other bills by the same name, in that it \ndoes not include mandatory minimum sentencing provisions, it would still lead to a likely increase in the federal \nprison population without any tangible benefits. The Department of Justice's ``Operation Streamline'' program, upon \n\n\n\nwhich this bill would build, has already shown that increased criminal prosecutions do little but waste resources \nwhile failing to deter unauthorized border crossings. It should be ended, not expanded. For these reasons, I urge \nyou to vote against H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004. Sincerely, Vanita Gupta, President & CEO. ____ American Civil \nLiberties Union, Washington, DC, June 27, 2017. Re ACLU Opposes H.R. 3003 (No Sanctuary for Criminals Act) \nand H.R. 3004 (Kate's Law). Hon. Paul D. Ryan, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. \nNancy Pelosi, Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority \nLeader Pelosi: On behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union (``ACLU''), we submit this letter to the House of \nRepresentatives to express our strong opposition to H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and H.R. 3004, \nKate's Law. no sanctuary for criminals act (h.r. 3003) H.R. 3003 conflicts with the principles of the Fourth \nAmendment. H.R. 3003 defies the Fourth Amendment by amending 8 USC Section 1373 of the Immigration and \nNationality Act (``INA'') to force localities to comply with unlawful detainer requests or risk losing federal funding. \nThis is despite the fact that an ``increasing number of federal court decisions'' have held that ``detainer-based \ndetention by state and local law enforcement agencies violates the [[Page H5257]] Fourth Amendment,'' as \nrecognized by former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson in 2014. Disturbingly, H.R. 3003 \nseeks to penalize the 600+ localities that abide by the Fourth Amendment. These jurisdictions have recognized that \nby entangling local authorities and federal immigration enforcement, immigration detainers erode trust between \nimmigrant communities and local law enforcement. In this way, immigration detainers ultimately undermine public \nsafety, as entire communities become wary of seeking assistance from police and other government authorities \nthat are supposed to provide help in times of need. Thus, by forcing jurisdictions to comply with unlawful detainer \nrequests, H.R. 3003 will only make communities less safe, not more. H.R. 3003 would also amend Section 287 of \nthe INA to allow the Department of Homeland Security (``DHS') to take custody of a person being held under a \ndetainer within 48 hours (excluding weekends and holidays) ``but in no instance more than 96 hours'' following the \ndate that the individual would otherwise be released from criminal custody. This, again, raises serious Fourth \nAmendment concerns, as the Supreme Court has stated that the Constitution requires a judicial finding of probable \ncause within 48 hours of arrest. This provision would disregard the Court's ruling entirely and allow a local law \nenforcement agency to hold a person for up to 7 days before requiring DHS intervention--and never requiring the \nperson be brought before a judge for a probable cause hearing. Protection against unreasonable detention by the \ngovernment is the bedrock of the Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which provides that the government cannot \nhold anyone in jail without getting a warrant or approval from a neutral magistrate. This constitutional protection \napplies to everyone in the United States--citizen and immigrant alike. Immigration detainers, however, do not abide \nby these standards. Detainers are one of the key tools that DHS uses to apprehend individuals who come in contact \nwith local and state law enforcement agencies. An immigration detainer is a written request from DHS to that local \nlaw enforcement agency, requesting that they detain an individual for an additional 48 hours after the person's \nrelease date, in order to allow immigration agents extra time to decide whether to take that person into custody for \ndeportation purposes. DHS' use of detainers to imprison people without due process, without any charges pending, \nand without probable cause of a criminal violation flies in the face of our Fourth Amendment protections. Policies \nthat allow DHS to detain people at-will are ripe for civil and human rights violations and have resulted in widespread \nwrongful detentions, including detentions of U.S. citizens. That is why many of the 600+ localities targeted by H.R. \n3003 have decided not to execute a DHS immigration detainer request unless it is accompanied by additional \nevidence, a determination of probable cause, or a judicial warrant. Unfortunately, H.R. 3003 does nothing to \naddress the fundamental constitutional problems plaguing DHS's use of immigration detainers. Rather than fix the \nconstitutional problems by requiring a judicial warrant, the bill perpetuates the unconstitutional detainer practices \nand forces the federal government to absorb legal liability for the constitutional violations which will inevitably result. \nThis is irresponsible lawmaking. Instead of saddling taxpayers with the liability the federal government will incur \nfrom Fourth Amendment violations, Congress should end the use of DHS's unconstitutional detainer requests. H.R. \n3003 violates the Due Process Clause by allowing DHS to detain people indefinitely without a bond hearing. \nSection 4 of H.R. 3003 radically expands our immigration detention system by amending Section 236(c) of the INA \nto authorize mandatory detention ``without time limitation.'' This empowers DHS to detain countless immigrants for \nas long as it takes to conclude removal proceedings--even if that takes years--without the basic due process of a \nbond hearing to determine if their imprisonment is even justified. This is a clear constitutional violation, as the \nfederal courts have overwhelmingly held that jailing immigrants for months and years without bond hearings raises \nserious problems under the Due Process Clause. Although the bill claims to provide for the ``detention of criminal \naliens,'' it massively expands mandatory detention to people with no criminal record whatsoever, including \n\n\n\nimmigrants who lack legal papers or who overstay a tourist visa. The ``lock `em up'' approach to immigration \nenforcement is cruel, irrational, and unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has permitted brief periods of mandatory \ndetention only in cases where individuals are charged with deportation based on certain criminal convictions. The \nCourt has not endorsed the mandatory lock-up of people who have never committed a crime. Kate's Law (H.R. \n3004) H.R. 3004 is piecemeal immigration enforcement that expands America's federal prison population and lines \nthe coffers of private prison companies. Increasing the maximum sentences for illegal reentrants is unnecessary, \nwasteful, and inhumane. H.R. 3004 envisions a federal criminal justice system that prosecutes asylum- seekers, \npersons providing humanitarian assistance to migrants in distress, and parents who pose no threat to public safety \nin returning to the U.S. to reunite with children who need their care (individuals with children in the United States are \n50 percent of those convicted of illegal reentry). Current law already imposes a sentence of up to 20 years on \nanyone convicted of illegally reentering the country who has committed an aggravated felony. U.S. Attorneys' \nOffices aggressively enforce these provisions. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, immigration \nprosecutions account for 52 percent of all federal prosecutions--surpassing drugs, weapons, fraud and thousands of \nother crimes. Nearly 99 percent of illegal reentry defendants are sentenced to federal prison time. H.R. 3004 would \ndrastically expand America's prison population of nonviolent prisoners at a time when there is bipartisan support to \nreduce the federal prison population. It offends due process by cutting off all collateral attacks on unjust prior \ndeportation orders, despite the Supreme Court's contrary ruling in United States v. Mendoza-Lopez. Profiteering by \nprivate prison companies has been the main consequence of border-crossing prosecutions, which the Government \nAccountability Office and the DHS Office of Inspector General have criticized as lacking sound deterrent support. \nH.R. 3004 is an integral part of this administration's mass deportation and mass incarceration agenda. Longer \nsentences for illegal reentry are not recommended by any informed federal criminal-justice stakeholders; rather they \nrepresent this administration's anti-immigrant obsession and would expensively expand substandard private jail \ncontracting despite the life-threatening conditions in these facilities. In conclusion, H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 are \nfraught with constitutional problems that threaten the civil and human rights of our immigrant communities, undercut \nlaw enforcement's ability to keep our communities safe, and would balloon our federal prison population by \nfinancing private prison corporations. Rather than taking a punitive approach to local law enforcement agencies that \nare working hard to balance their duties to uphold the Constitution and to keep their communities safe, Congress \nshould end DHS's unconstitutional detainer practices or fix the constitutional deficiencies by requiring judicial \nwarrants for all detainer requests. Congress should also repeal mandatory detention so that all immigrants receive \nthe basic due process of a bond hearing and reject any attempt to unfairly imprison individuals who are not a threat \nto public safety.

Lorella Praeli, Director of Immigration Policy and Campaigns. \n____ National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence, June 27, 2017. The National Taskforce to End \nSexual and Domestic Violence (NTF), comprised of national leadership organizations advocating on behalf of \nsexual assault and domestic violence victims and representing hundreds of organizations across the country \ndedicated to ensuring all survivors of violence receive the protections they deserve, write to express our deep \nconcerns about the impact that H.R. 3003, the ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,'' and H.R. 3004, or ``Kate's Law,'' \nwill have on victims fleeing or recovering from sexual assault, domestic violence, or human trafficking, and on \ncommunities at large. This year is the twenty-third anniversary of the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act \n(``VAWA'') which has, since it was first enacted, included critical protections for immigrant victims of domestic and \nsexual violence. H.R. 3003 and H.R.\n\n      3004 will have the effect of punishing immigrant survivors and their children and pushing them into the shadows \nand into danger, undermining the very purpose of VAWA. Specifically, the nation's leading national organizations \nthat address domestic and sexual assault oppose H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 because: Community trust policies are \ncritical tools for increasing community safety. Laws that seek to intertwine the federal immigration and local law \nenforcement systems will undermine the Congressional purpose of protections enacted under VAWA and will have \nthe chilling effect of pushing immigrant victims into the shadows and undermining public safety. Immigration \nenforcement must be implemented in a way that supports local community policing and sustains community trust \nin working with local law enforcement. H.R. 3003 runs contrary to community policing efforts and will deter \nimmigrant domestic violence and sexual assault survivors not only from reporting crimes, but also from seeking help \nfor themselves and their children. While H.R. 3003 does not require that local law enforcement arrest or report \nimmigrant victims or witnesses of criminal activity, the language in the bill provides no restriction prohibiting such \n\n\n\npractices. Perpetrators use fear of deportation as tool of abuse. Local policies that minimize the intertwining of local \nlaw enforcement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement [[Page H5258]] (ICE) help protect the most \nvulnerable victims by creating trust between law enforcement and the immigrant community, which in turn help \nprotect entire communities. Abusers and traffickers use the fear of deportation of their victims as a tool to silence \nand trap them. If immigrants are afraid to call the police because of fear of deportation, they become more \nvulnerable to abuse and exploitation. Not only are the individual victims and their children harmed, but their fear of \nlaw enforcement leads many to abstain from reporting violent perpetrators or seeking protection and, as a result, \ndangerous criminals are not identified and go unpunished. As VAWA recognizes, immigrant victims of violent \ncrimes often do not contact law enforcement due to fear that they will be deported. Immigrants are already afraid of \ncontacting the police and HR 3003 proposes to further intertwine federal immigration and local law enforcement \nsystems will only exacerbate this fear. The result is that perpetrators will be able to continue to harm others, both \nimmigrant and U.S. Citizen victims alike. Since January of 2017, victim advocates have been describing the \nimmense fear expressed by immigrant victims and their reluctance to reach out for help from police. A recent \nsurvey of over 700 advocates and attorneys at domestic violence and sexual assault programs indicate that \nimmigrant victims are expressing heightened fears and concerns about immigration enforcement, with 78% of \nadvocates and attorneys reporting that victims are describing fear of contacting the police; 75% of them reporting \nthat victims are afraid of going to court; and 43% reporting working with immigrant victims who are choosing not to \nmove forward with criminal charges or obtaining protective orders. In addition, according to Los Angeles Police \nChief Charlie Beck, reporting of sexual assault and domestic violence among Latinos has dropped significantly this \nyear, possibly due to concerns that police interaction could result in deportation. According to Chief Beck, reports \nof sexual assault have dropped 25 percent among Los Angeles' Latino population since the beginning of the year \ncompared to a three percent drop among non-Latino victims. Similarly, reports of spousal abuse among Latinos fell \nby about 10 percent among Latinos whereas the decline among non-Latinos was four percent. The Houston Police \nDepartment reported in April that the number of Hispanics reporting rape is down 42.8 percent from last year. In \nDenver, CO, the Denver City Attorney has reported that some domestic violence victims are declining to testify in \ncourt. As of late February, the City Attorney's Office had dropped four cases because the victims fear that ICE \nofficers will arrest and deport them. Both the City Attorney and Aurora Police Chief have spoken on the importance \nof having trust with the immigrant community in order to maintain public safety and prosecute crime. HR 3003 Will \nUnfairly Punish Entire Communities. H.R. 3003 punishes localities that follow Constitutional guidelines and refuse to \nhonor detainer requests that are not supported by due process mandates. H.R. 3003 likely covers more than 600 \njurisdictions across the country, most of which do not characterize their policies to follow constitutional mandates as \n``sanctuary'' policies. H.R. 3003 penalizes jurisdictions by eliminating their access to various federal grants, \nincluding federal law enforcement grants, such as the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, \nand other federal grants related to law enforcement or immigration, such as those that fund forensic rape kit \nanalysis. Withholding federal law enforcement funding would, ironically, undermine the ability of local jurisdictions to \ncombat and prevent crime in their communities. In addition, the fiscal impact of both H.R. 3003 and H.R.\n\n      3004 will result in limited federal law enforcement resources being further reduced as a result of shifting funding \nfrom enforcing federal criminal laws addressing violent crimes, including those protecting victims of domestic \nviolence, sexual assault, and human trafficking, to the detention and prosecution of many non-violent immigration \nlaw violaters. H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 Will Unfairly Punish Victims. By greatly expanding mandatory detention and \nexpanding criminal penalties for reentry, H.R. 3003 and H.R.3004 will have harsh consequences for immigrant \nsurvivors. Victims of human trafficking, sexual assault, and domestic violence are often at risk of being arrested and \nconvicted. In recognition of this fact, existing ICE guidance cites the example of when police respond to a domestic \nviolence call, both parties may be arrested or a survivor who acted in self-defense may be wrongly accused. In \naddition, if the abuser speaks English better than the survivor, or if other language or cultural barriers (or fear of \nretaliation from the abuser) prevent the survivor from fully disclosing the abuse suffered, a survivor faces charges \nand tremendous pressure to plead guilty (without being advised about the long-term consequences) in order to be \nreleased from jail and reunited with her children. In addition, victims of trafficking are often arrested and convicted \nfor prostitution-related offenses. These victims are often desperate to be released and possibly to be reunited with \ntheir children following their arrests or pending trial. These factors--combined with poor legal counsel, particularly \nabout the immigration consequences of criminal pleas and convictions--have in the past and will likely continue to \nlead to deportation of wrongly accused victims who may have pled to or been unfairly convicted of domestic \n\n\n\nviolence charges and/or prostitution. H.R. 3003 imposes harsh criminal penalties and H.R. 3009 imposes expanded \nbases for detention without consideration of mitigating circumstances or humanitarian exceptions for these victims. \nIn addition, HR. 3004 expands the criminal consequences for re-entry in the U.S. without recognizing the \ncompelling humanitarian circumstances in which victims who have been previously removed return for their safety. \nVictims of domestic and sexual violence and trafficking fleeing violence in their countries of origin will be penalized \nfor seeking protection from harm. In recent years, women and children fleeing rampant violence in El Salvador, \nGuatemala and Honduras, have fled to the United States, seeking refuge. Frequently, because of inadequate \naccess to legal representation, they are unable to establish their eligibility for legal protections in the United States, \nresulting in their removal. In many cases, the risk of domestic violence, sexual assault, and/or human trafficking in \ntheir countries of origin remain unabated and victims subsequently attempt to reenter the U.S. to protect themselves \nand their children. Other victims of domestic and sexual violence and trafficking may be deported because their \nabusers or traffickers isolate them, or prevent them from obtaining lawful immigration status. They are deported, \nwith some victims having to leave their children behind in the custody of their abusers or traffickers. Under H.R. \n3004, these victims risk harsh criminal penalties for re-entry for attempting to protect themselves and their children. \nOn behalf of the courageous survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, stalking and human \ntrafficking that our organizations serve, we urge you to vote against HR 3003 and 3004, and to affirm the intent and \nspirit of VAWA by supporting strong relationships between law enforcement and immigrant communities, which is \ncritical for public safety in general, and particularly essential for domestic and sexual violence victims and their \nchildren. Sincerely, The National Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic Violence (www.4vawa.org). ____ June 26, \n2017. Dear Representative: We write on behalf of the Committee on Migration of the U.S. Conference of Catholic \nBishops (USCCB/ COM), and Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA) to express our opposition to H.R. 3003 and H.R. \n3004. The Catholic Church holds a strong interest in the welfare of migrants and how our nation welcomes and \ntreats them. Our parishes include those with and without immigration status, unfortunately some who have \nwitnessed or been victims of crime in the United States, including domestic violence, armed robbery, and assault. \nWe understand the importance of fostering cooperation and information-sharing between immigrant communities \nand local law enforcement. We oppose H.R. 3003 because it would impose obligations on local governments that \nwe fear--and that many of them have warned--would undermine authority and discretion of local law enforcement. \nThis, in turn, would hamper the ability of local law enforcement officials to apprehend criminals and ensure public \nsafety in all communities. Furthermore, Section 2 of H.R. 3003 would deny to jurisdictions vital federal funding \nrelated to law enforcement, terrorism, national security, immigration, and naturalization if those jurisdictions are \ndeemed to be non- compliant with H.R. 3003. The Catholic service network, including Catholic Charities, works in \npartnership with the federal government on a number of Department of Justice and Department of Homeland \nSecurity initiatives, including disaster response and recovery, naturalization and citizenship services, and services \nfor the immigrant, including victims of human trafficking, and domestic violence. These services are incredibly \nvaluable to the protection and promotion of the human person and in some instances life-saving. Cutting grants \nrelated to these important national objectives, or threat of such cuts, is not humane or just, nor is it in our national \ninterest. Also, we oppose H.R. 3004 as it would lead to an expansion of incarceration and does not include \nadequate protections for people who re-enter the U.S. for humanitarian reasons or seek protection at the border. \nWhile H.R. 3004 makes notable efforts to protect us from those convicted of violent criminal offenses, the legislation \ngoes far beyond this goal by expanding the government's ability to prosecute illegal re-entry cases and heightening \nthe criminal penalties in these cases. In an era of fiscal austerity, it is vital that important judicial resources are \nefficiently utilized to prosecute and convict the most violent offenders of violent crimes. Expanding who is eligible to \nbe prosecuted for entry or re-entry as well as enhancing sentencing requirements does not advance the common \ngood nor will it ensure that communities are safer. Furthermore, we are concerned that, as introduced, H.R. 3004 \nwould also prevent vulnerable asylum seekers and unaccompanied children, (who have presented themselves \nrepeatedly at the U.S. border in the flight from violence), from being able to access protection, and instead face \nfines, imprisonment or both. [[Page H5259]] We respectfully urge you to reject these bills in favor of a more \ncomprehensive and humane approach to immigration reform; an approach that upholds human dignity and family \nunity and places a greater emphasis on balancing the needs and rights of immigrants with our nation's best \ninterests and security. The United States has a long and proud history of leadership in welcoming newcomers \nregardless of their circumstances and promoting the common good. We stand ready to work with you on legislation \nthat more closely adheres to this tradition and appreciate your serious consideration of our views in this regard. \nSincerely, Most Rev. Joe Vasquez, Bishop of Austin, Chairman, USCCB Committee on Migration. Sr. Donna \n\nhttp://www.4vawa.org/\n\n\nMarkham, OP, PhD, President & CEO, Catholic Charities USA. ____ June 27, 2017. Dear Representative \nMcGovern: NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice stands in strong opposition to the ``No Sanctuary for \nCriminals Act'' (H.R. 3003) and ``Kate's Law'' (H.R. 3004) to be considered this week by the House of \nRepresentatives. We urge Congress to reject these bills. In a country that prides itself on being the land of welcome \nand opportunity, we must ensure that our immigration laws reflect our shared values. As Congress continues to \ndelay comprehensive immigration reform and a permanent solution for the nation's 11 million undocumented \nimmigrants, we are left with the status quo--an enforcement-only approach that tears apart families and keeps \npeople in the shadows. Despite the gridlock in Congress, localities across the country still have the responsibility to \nuphold safety and peace in their communities. To fulfill this goal, local police and residents have fostered mutual \ntrust to root out crime and promote public safety, encouraging community members to cooperate with local \nauthorities. The ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act'' (H.R.\n\n      3003) does nothing to promote public safety and instead will make communities more dangerous while striking \nfear in the hearts of our immigrant families. Likewise, ``Kate's Law'' (H.R. 3004) would criminalize immigrants who \nsimply want an opportunity to succeed in the United States, and often are simply trying to be reunited with their \nfamily. Punishing immigrants for wanting to provide for their families with fines and imprisonment is harsh and cruel-\n-we, as a nation, are called to be better than that. Again, we ask Congress to abandon the ``enforcement first'' \npolicies that have been the de facto U.S. strategy for nearly thirty years, yielding too many costs and too few \nresults. Our antiquated system that does not accommodate the migration realities we face in our nation today does \nnot serve our national interests and does not respect the basic human rights of migrants who come to this nation \nfleeing persecution or in search of employment for themselves and better living conditions for their children. Pope \nFrancis cautions that ``migrants and refugees are not pawns on the chessboard of humanity'' and he asks political \nleaders to create a new system, one that ``calls for international cooperation and a spirit of profound solidarity and \ncompassion.'' This is a holy call to embrace hope over fear. Congress should recognize the God-given humanity of \nall individuals and uphold our sacred call to love our neighbor and welcome the stranger in our midst. Any action \nthat further militarizes our borders, criminalizes assistance to immigrant communities, or weakens legal protection \nof refugees is neither just nor compatible with the values that we, as Americans, strive to uphold. Sincerely, Sr. \nSimone Campbell, SSS, Executive Director, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. \nSpeaker, I, again, would simply say that if we really want to do something about immigration, we ought to come \ntogether, like the Senate did not long ago, and pass comprehensive immigration reform. But, apparently, that is \nnot in the DNA of the current leadership of this House. Instead, we have bills that demagogue the immigration \nissue, that demean immigrants, that cause hysteria, and I find that very unfortunate. This bill is a bad idea. It falls in \nthe same category as that other bad, stupid idea of building a wall across our country. What we ought to be doing is \nserious legislating, enough demagoguing, and let's get back to doing the people's business, and that includes \ncomprehensive immigration reform. Mr. Speaker, as I said, we need to fix our immigration laws. When a mother \nin the Philippines has to wait 25 years or more for a visa to reunite with her son in the United States, is that system \nworking? No. To lose the entire childhood and young adulthood of your son? What mother wouldn't try to enter the \nUnited States some other way, in fact, any way that she could in order to be with her child? When your daughter is \nthreatened with rape and murder if she doesn't become a sexual slave to gang members; when your son and the \nentire family is threatened with death if the boy doesn't join the gangs, wouldn't you run away and try to find safety \nsomeplace else? And when the family arrives at the U.S. border and they actively seek out the U.S. Border Patrol \nand voluntarily surrender to them and ask for safe refuge and asylum, is that really entering our borders illegally? \nYou know, when you have been an upstanding member of the community for 10, 15, 20 years or more in the United \nStates, and you get pulled over because the tags have expired on your car, or your license, do you really deserve to \nbe deported, to tear apart your family, to leave behind the businesses that you have spent a lifetime creating? And \ndoes anyone in this Chamber honestly think that if this father or mother is deported, that they won't do everything \nthey can to try to come back to be with their kids? I mean, these are real stories. It is not fiction. They are not \nfantasies. It is real. And if you listened to people in your community, you would know these stories. If you paid \nattention to your local police, you would know why it is so damaging to turn them in to ICE, because they rely on \nthese community members to inform them of criminal activities in their community. The police don't want to do what \nyou are asking them to do. Why would you force this on them? And why would you punish them by taking away \nessential Federal funding to help them protect the citizens of this country? This is a bad idea. I guess, maybe it is a \ngood press release. Maybe Steve Bannon thinks it is a good idea. Maybe it is a good sound bite for Trump. Who \n\n\n\nknows what the rationale behind this is. But it is not sensible. It is not thoughtful. So if you want to get serious about \nthese issues, you know, come together, like the Senate did, in a bipartisan way, and come up with comprehensive \nimmigration reform. That is our duty. That is our job, as Members of Congress, not this garbage. This is a waste of \ntime. This is an insult to the American people. We ought to be able to do better. So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my \ncolleagues to reject this. I urge them to defeat the previous question so we can have a debate and vote on whether \nor not to increase the minimum wage to $15 to give people a raise. Again, we have to do that because this House \nis being so tightly controlled that you can't get anything to the floor. I would remind my colleagues that the \nunderlying bill that we are talking about here today on immigration is under a closed rule. We will have another \nclosed rule tomorrow. So much for democracy. So much for deliberative process. So much for openness. There is \nno such thing here. I mean, the Rules Committee has become a place where democracy goes to die, where \neverything gets shut down. We need to do better. This process stinks, and this bill is lousy. I urge my colleagues to \nvote ``no'' on the previous question, vote ``no'' on the rule, and if it gets to the point we have to debate this, vote \n``no'' on the underlying bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. \nSpeaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I do believe that in just a little bit we will be \ndebating this bill. I do believe in just a short time it will pass. I think what was very interesting, Mr. Speaker, is the \nfrustrations of my friend, and I believe they are true frustrations, and the stories of folks coming from terrible places \naround the world wanting to get here. We are the light on a hill. We are the ones that everybody wants to come to. I \ngrant you that. But I do have a question. For these folks who are leaving disaster, places in which law and order are \nnot enforced, in which people are dying, and they are striving to get someplace else, [[Page H5260]] why in the \nworld would we want to get to here to find that we have a situation in which local law enforcement can sort of \ndecide what they want to do, where law and order is not followed? You are leaving one area to get to an area in \nwhich what they say is law and order is what is needed and what is followed and why they come here, but yet we \nare saying no. I think it has also been, possibly, Mr. Speaker, a vast mischaracterization to say that all police are \nagainst this. In fact, if we have seen, there was 200 that was identified earlier, the vast majority of police \ndepartments in this country uphold the law. So let's don't make a blanket assessment of police here. I think it is just \nan interesting development here. I think you can talk about laws. You can like laws, you cannot like laws, you can \ndo something about immigration. But I do think we also need to address something else. It wasn't a part of this \nbill, but we wanted to make it a part of this bill, and that is comprehensive immigration reform. I do agree with my \nfriend. There needs to be immigration reform. I think it needs to start with security and safety and protection. It \nneeds to start with actually enforcing law, and then begin the foundation of finding a way to get workers here--our \nguest worker program, our ag worker program, the things that we need to make our expansion so that we do it \nproperly. I agree completely. But, Mr. Speaker, I do find it has been amazing here because, just in the context of \nthis debate, these were words that were used: We're demagoguing this issue. We didn't have the guts to address \nthis issue. Our DNA of leadership is to obstruct or to not bring this forward. Well, I think the one thing that I do need \nto remind is, this body, Mr. Speaker, if you are very familiar with this, over the last few weeks, we have been dealing \nwith a very difficult issue--we passed it out of the House--that is healthcare, which was passed when this body was \nfilled in a majority of a different party, my friends across the aisle, when they had, at times, filibuster-proof \nmajorities. They worked to pass healthcare. They worked to pass Dodd-Frank. They worked to pass their priorities. \nMy interesting question is, they did not work to pass comprehensive immigration reform. I am not sure why now \nwe decide that it is such their issue that they are now blaming us, many of us who want to find a way forward. But I \nthink the answer is plain and obvious in history. They chose not to do it. I repeat, they chose not to do it. So I think \nin the discussion of this battle, we will continue these discussions. We will continue to have differences of opinion. I \nthink it is sort of amazing though that we do have to have a discussion here on telling police to enforce the law and \nwork out the details as we go, work out what is in this bill. But it also is about priorities, Mr. Speaker. For those of \nus who have had to look at the tragedies left behind as a result of some of these decisions that they have made to \n``better'' their community, the deaths, the tragedies, then it is a pretty interesting choice. Is the death more \nimportant or less important than your policy? All we are simply saying is: just don't take the money. Look at it from \nthat perspective. And we will continue to have these debates. My friend and I will continue to be passionately \ndifferent on this, and that is okay. That is what this floor is for because, at the end of the day, we are going to have \na vote. One side is going to win and one side is going to lose in this vote. And the debate is going to happen, and \nthe bill is going to come forward. There will be another vote. And then it will go to the Senate. I disagree with my \nfriend from Massachusetts, respect his opinion, but, in this case, I believe the debate is fairly clear to most \nAmericans. All we are asking is, and what the current law already states, follow the rules. And all we are simply \n\n\n\nsaying is, follow the rules. The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows: An Amendment to H. \nRes. 414 Offered by Mr. McGovern At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: Sec. 2. \nImmediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the \nHouse resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.\n\n      15) to provide for increases in the Federal minimum wage, and for other purposes. All points of order against \nconsideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour \nequally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and the \nWorkforce. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of \norder against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the \nCommittee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The \nprevious question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without \nintervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises \nand reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, \nimmediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the \nWhole for further consideration of the bill. Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. \n15. ____ The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means This vote, the vote on whether to order the \nprevious question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question \nis a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative \nplan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \nRepresentatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \ncontrol the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the \nprevious question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the \nSpeaker's ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the \nprevious question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to offer an amendment. On March \n15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a \nmember of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph \nG. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. \nFitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.'' The \nRepublican majority may say ``the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \nimmediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications \nwhatsoever.'' But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the \nLegislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here's how the \nRepublicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally not possible to \namend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an \namendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \nmotion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to \nordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the \nrule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.'' In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the \nsubchapter titled``Amending Special Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a \nspecial rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.'' \n(Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \nresolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the \nprevious question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.'' \nClearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \navailable tools for those who oppose the Republican majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \nopportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, \nand I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore.
