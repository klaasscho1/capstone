{"title": "FLIP-FLOPPING DOBBS LOSES ANTI-IMMIG GROUP BACKING", "body": "\nA LEADING anti-illegal immigrant group said adios to Lou Dobbs yesterday, now that the ex-CNN anchor is \ncasting himself as a true amigo to undocumented aliens as he mulls a run for office.\n\nThe Americans for Legal Immigration PAC announced it was yanking its support for Dobbs, who in recent days has \nbeen trying to deny his record as a leading foe of immigrant rights.\n\n\"A large segment of his base feels betrayed,\" said ALIPAC President William Gheen.\n\nThe dustup began Nov. 20, when Dobbs expressed shock that anyone would consider him anti-immigrant.\n\n\"Whatever you have thought of me in the past,\" Dobbs told Telemundo, a Spanish-language TV network, \"I can tell \nyou right now that I am one of your greatest friends.\"\n\nHe then endorsed considering citizenship to the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S., saying, \"We \nneed the ability to legalize illegal immigrants under certain conditions.\"\n\nThe abrupt flip-flop comes as Dobbs mulls a run for U.S. Senate in New Jersey in 2012, and possibly even a run \nfor President.\n\nHis most recent comments are a long way from Dobbs' earlier tirades as a host on CNN, where he once claimed \nthat \"an invasion of illegal aliens\" had caused a spike in U.S. leprosy cases - a report later dismissed as flatout \nwrong.\n\nHe aired conspiracy theories suggesting the U.S. was eager to form a \"North American Union\" with Canada and \nMexico, and that a key interest of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce was \"Mexico's export of drugs and \nillegal aliens to the United States.\"\n\nDobbs declined to comment, but a spokesman insisted his immigration views have always been \"right down the \nmiddle.\"\n\ndsaltonstall@nydailynews.com\n"}
